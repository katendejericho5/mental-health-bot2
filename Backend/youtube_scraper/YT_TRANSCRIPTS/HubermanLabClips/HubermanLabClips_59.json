    "transcript": "I have a question about mentors.\nI'm a big believer in mentors,\neither mentors that know\nus and we know them,\nor people that we assign as mentors\nwithout them realizing it,\nthis sort of thing.\nDo you have mentors at this stage of life\nfor particular areas of life?\nOr are you mentoring yourself?\nAre you flying with a\nfew voices in your head\nthat serve you well?\nWho are your mentors?\nI definitely have people\nI consider mentors.\nIt's, I think at this point,\nrarely one way in the sense that\nthey tend to be friends I spend time with.\nThey get something from it.\nI get something from it.\nNot in a transactional way,\nbut they find it fun, or\nbeneficial, or amusing,\nin some way redeeming\nto spend time with me.\nThat's the hope.\nBut how is that different\nfrom traditional friendship,\njust sort of standard friendship?\nAre you spending time with\nsome orientation toward\nthey're embodying areas of life\nthat you would like to emulate?\nTotally.\nI mean, I spend time around\npeople I hope to be more like\nin some way,\nbecause guess what?\nYou're going to average into,\nsay just the sum, holistic\nwhole of the five or six people\nyou spend the most time with,\nso you should choose that very carefully.\nThat includes virtual\nparasocial relationships.\nOkay, if you're listening\nto fill in the blank person\nfor four hours a week, five\nhours a week, two hours a week,\nwhoever that group is comprised of\nis going to influence who you become.\nAnd for me then I think\ncarefully about my friendships.\nAnd they could be older,\nlike Kevin Kelly has become a good friend\nwho has a wealth of life\nexperience that I don't have.\nAnd so I might just call him and say,\n\"Kevin, I have a question for you.\"\nBut I do that with my younger friends too.\nAnd they could be younger than I am,\nand I might still view them\nas a mentor in X, Y, or Z\nI think mentor has a heavy weight to it.\nIt has a connotation of\nmaybe never ending, time\nconsuming obligation.\nSo I would never, for instance,\nand I know a lot of people try this,\nask someone to be my mentor.\nIt's like,\n\"Would you like to be my\nfree life coach forever?\"\nYou know, that's kind of how\nit sounds to the recipient.\nSo it it sounds very formal.\nYeah, it sounds very formal.\nAnd so for me,\nI would say there have\ncertainly been mentors.\nI've had wrestling\ncoaches, I've had teachers,\nI've had resident advisors\nwho are reverenced\nwho had a huge impact on my life,\nand followed up with me,\nand paid attention to me and cared for me\nin more of a one-directional sense, right?\nI view myself as the beneficiary.\nOf course, they certainly\ngot something out of it\nif they had that job.\nI mean, they probably found it\nto be very gratifying in its own way.\nAnd teachers like Professor\nEd Chao at Princeton\nI feel incredibly indebted to.\nThese days, and for a long\ntime I've believed that\nyou can learn something\npowerful from almost anyone,\nprobably anyone you interact with.\nCould be an Uber driver,\ncould be someone taking\ngarbage out of a restaurant.\nIf you really take the time to\ndig, you can find something.\nAnd before you can, I think, as an adult,\neffectively think about who\nyou would like to learn from,\nif I put it that way,\nit's helpful to have a\nbaseline of self-awareness\nthat you know what you\nmight want to work on\nto either amplify\nstrengths, develop skills,\naddress weaknesses.\nAnd so, for instance,\none of my close friends,\nMatt Mullenweg, is younger than I am.\nHe's the founder of Automattic,\nwhich runs wordpress.com.\nHe was the lead developer of WordPress.\nAlthough it was an open\nsource project, of course,\nwith many, many contributors,\nhe was one of the lead developers,\nnow powers something\nlike 32% of the internet,\nand he exemplifies a\ncool and calm temperament\neven in the most chaotic\nperiods imaginable,\nduring the most chaotic events imaginable.\nAnd when I find myself\ngetting dysregulated,\nto use a fancy term, losing my shit,\nor getting carried away by emotion,\ngetting righteously angry,\nor whatever it might be,\nand I recognize at some point\nthat it's really not serving me,\nand that I am being owned\nby the emotion, right,\nlike I'm the dog on the leash,\nnot the other way around,\nthen I think of Matt.\nI'm like, what would Matt do?\nWhat advice would Matt give me right now?\nHow would Matt act in these circumstances?\nAnd I do that with many friends.\nI also think a lot about,\nand this is borrowing from\nsomeone named Kathy Sierra\nfrom a long time ago,\nfocusing more on just in time information\nas opposed to just in case information.\nSo just in case information is like,\nI'm going to read these 20 books\n'cause in two years I might\nbe interested in X, Y, and Z.\nThat, I think, is often a waste of time,\nbecause if it ever becomes relevant,\nyou're just going to have\nto reread those books.\nPeople do the same thing with humans.\nThey're like, \"I want to meet so and so,\nand have them as my mentor,\nbecause maybe five years\nfrom now I'll do X, Y, and Z,\nand then they'll be useful for A, B, C.\"\nThat's too speculative,\nand I think it ends up in\na lot of wasted energy.\nSo the podcast for me,\nwriting the books and doing the interviews\neven prior to the podcast,\nbecoming involved with startups,\ndelving into the world\nof science and scientists\nall helps me to develop a confidence that\nalmost any question I could ask,\nI can find some semblance of an answer for\nby just reaching out to\na few people and saying,\n\"Who do you know who might\nbe able to answer this?\"\nAnd that's very reassuring.\nAnd it relieves some of\nthe anxiety or pressure\nthat people might feel to assemble\nsome personal board of directors\nof like X-Men and women\nwho can help them with everything.\nAnd then there are people I\nhire to be accountable to.\nSo I might work with coaches,\ntherapists, and so on\nwho I would view as mentors.\nThey just happen to get\ngetting paid for it, right?\n[Music
