    "transcript": "How do you suggest parents\ndeal with retorts and rudeness?\nAnd again, let's extend\nthis to all relationships.\nSo you get in your best mindset,\nand by the way, I love this I am thing,\ntwo of the most important\nwords in any language,\nwhen translated to other languages.\nI am blank, I am a good this,\nor I am whatever role\nidentity is key to the brain.\nWe know this.\nYou go in and you say, \"I'm really sorry.\nI struggle to regulate my emotions.\nI believe that you're really upset.\"\nAnd the kid says, \"I hate you.\"\nNow, earlier you said\nthat good boundaries are\nabout not expecting a change\nin behavior from someone else,\nthey're about our own boundaries.\nOr maybe the I hate you\ncomes from, you know,\nlisten, we're not going\nto go to so-and-so's house\nfor a play date today.\nGreat example.\nI hate you, yeah.\nI hate you.\nSo is there ever a case for no response?\nI mean, to me, the most\nunderutilized parenting strategy\nis doing nothing, literally.\nIt's one of my most-used\nstrategies 'cause,\nand there's like really\ngood reason for it,\nespecially in this situation.\nSo I always, to me, like I always say,\nwe have to understand before we intervene.\nSo I know every parent's like,\n\"What do you do in that situation?\"\nBut it's like trying to\nfix someone's tennis swing\nbefore you like look\nat their tennis swing.\nThere could be a lot of problems.\nSo again, why is a kid saying I hate you?\nAnd I would ask every parent\nto just keep this in mind,\nit's a tool, and you\ncan't use it in real time.\nEventually you can, but we have to say it\nat like the end of a night.\nWhen my kid said, \"I hate you,\"\nwhat is my most generous interpretation\nof why he would say that to me?\nAnd if you're like any human,\nme included, by the way,\nlike your least generous\ninterpretation is immediate.\nYou're like, because he's a sociopath,\nlike that's what we say all\nthe time, we're like, wow.\nOr because he's like a horrible kid,\n'cause he's spoiled, 'cause he's nasty.\nIt comes easily. So that's fine.\nBut what is my most\ngenerous interpretation?\nAnd when I don't know,\nI'll push myself to say,\n\"Okay, well if like I was in\na situation with my husband,\nwhat would lead me to say that?\"\nI dunno. What would lead\nyou to say that to someone?\nThat I hate them?\nYeah, they like say something to you like,\n\"Hey Andrew, we're not going\nto be able to do this dinner.\"\nIt would have to be some sort\nof deep betrayal of trust.\nAnd when I'm, and I have to\nacknowledge that if I said\nthat to somebody that I\nreally care about or love,\nas I'm saying, \"I hate you,\"\nwhat I'm really saying is,\n\"I love you so much and\nthat hurts unbelievably,\nsuch an unbelievable intensity\nthat what's coming out of\nmy mouth is I hate you.\"\nBecause if you didn't love them.\nThat's right.\nIt would have null effect.\nI think it would be a meh, it would be,\nit would be a meh, but\ninstead it's a ugh, it hurts.\nSomehow, there's a neural\ncircuit in there that goes,\nyou know, I whatever,\ninsert expletive, hate you.\nThat's right.\nBut what you're really saying\nis, \"I love you so much,\nand as a consequence,\nthat thing you did or said hurts so much.\"\nThat's right, and so I\nthink that's like exactly\nwhat's going on for a kid.\nOr like, to me, my most\ngenerous interpretation,\na simple way, is my kid,\nwhen I said we couldn't go\nto this friend's house that\nhe thought we were going to,\nhis friend, he was going to sleep over,\nhe had like so built it up in his mind.\nHe'd like, probably like kids do,\nlike they have this whole image,\noh and then we're going\nto do this and this.\nAnd like the let down was so intense.\nAgain, I go back to kids have\nall the feelings we have,\nand they're born with none of the skills.\nSo it takes a lot of,\nit takes like a pretty\nwell-developed skill\nto be really disappointed, by the way,\nand surprised in the moment,\nand like manage it in like a mature way.\nI'm sure we both know adults\nwho aren't really capable\nof doing that, right?\nSo the fact that my\n7-year-old is doing that.\nSo if I think about it that way,\nwe latch onto our kids' words\nas if they're the truth.\nThey're not the truth.\nIt's not to say that they don't matter,\nbut they're not the truth.\nThe truth is whatever\nworld is under the words,\nlike I'm disappointed and I\ndon't know how to manage that.\nSo if I think about the\noutcome, like what would,\nwhere do I want to be?\nWhat I would love in that situation,\n'cause the truth is when I say to my kid,\n\"Sorry, we can't go to Bobby's\nhouse,\" I wouldn't even want,\nit's not normal for my kid\nto be like, \"Oh, no problem.\"\nBecause like I would,\nI'm just picturing my 25-year-old\nlike trying to get a job,\nand being like, \"Mom, oh I didn't get it,\"\nand then he's like, \"No problem.\"\nI'm like, that's kind\nof weird. Like really?\nLike that's weird, like I'd\nwant you to be disappointed.\nAnd so what I want my kid to\nbe able to do is to be like,\nI dunno what's the best it gets,\nit's like, oh man, I was\nreally looking forward to that.\nThat's like ultimate maturity.\nSo how do I get from, I hate you\nto oh man, I was really\nlooking forward to that?\nAll the things we want to do\njust like don't even make sense.\nLike sending my kid to their room,\nsaying like, \"You're such a nasty kid.\nI've never seen any of your friends\nsay that to their parents.\"\nAnd I'm good at acting these things out,\n'cause of course I say these things too.\nBut all I'm doing is\nbasically telling my kid\nthe version of themselves\nI don't want them to be,\nso now I'm further away from that outcome,\njust not effective.\nMy kid obviously, literally needs\nto learn some of those\nskills and practice them.\nWe don't think about simulations\nwith kids nearly enough.\nWe know that in sports,\npeople practice all the time.\nWe don't do that with emotion regulation.\nSo what do I do in the moment?\nI think the best question\nhere is what do I do\noutside the moment to help\nmy kid build the skills\nso they actually have more of a skill\nthe next time that moment comes.\nStill, I'm a pragmatist,\nwhat do I do in the moment?\nI hate you.\nI probably would do nothing first.\nWhen someone is rude to you\nand they say something nasty,\nI don't know, I just like, this is one,\nthis is my son, this is me,\nmy son just hurled I hate you,\nit's like sitting between us.\nWhen we say back to\nthem like, \"I hate you,\"\nor like, \"Go to your room,\"\nwe take all the energy from what they said\nand we just like throw it,\nand then like we have\nthis ping pong match.\nWhen you do nothing, I always picture,\nif this is like the I hate\nyou, it just sits between us.\nMy kid has a much higher chance\nof kind of reowning what they just said\nbecause I'm just kind of\nsturdy in that moment,\nbecause I didn't just take it from them\nand say something to them,\nwhich just gives them the opportunity\nto like take what I said\nand have no responsibility\nfor the first thing they said.\nIt's always true in adults,\nwhen someone says to you,\nlike something nasty, if you\nactually just stay there,\nthey're kind of like, oh shoot,\nlike I shouldn't have said that,\nbecause like it's right there.\nSo I'd probably say nothing.\nNow, a couple, I dunno\nif I'd really do that,\nbut I'd want to do that, let me be clear.\nSomething else you can say in that moment,\nwhich takes a lot of presence,\nso it's not going to happen right away,\nis just something like, \"Whoa.\nClearly you're disappointed, I get that.\nI believe you and I\nknow there's another way\nyou can say that to me.\"\nThat's actually right back to family jobs.\nI'm validating and I'm\nsetting kind of a boundary\nin some ways, like I know,\nmaybe there's a hope there too,\nlike I know there's another way.\nIf my kid keeps saying,\n\"I hate you, I hate you.\nYou're the worst, you're the worst,\"\nI'm going to say, \"Listen, I love you.\nYou're a good kid.\nYou're having a hard time.\nI really won't stay in your room\nwhile you keep saying this to me.\nAnd part of that is 'cause\nit's not good for you either.\nLike, this isn't a good dynamic.\nI'm going to step outside,\nI'm going to come back,\nand we can talk about it when we're both\nin a place where we can be\na little more respectful,\"\nor something like that.\nYou don't have to be a punching bag.\nBut at least now I'm helping my kid see\nthat he is having a\nfeeling under these words.\nIf I can't differentiate the\nfeeling from the behavior,\nhow can I expect my kid to ever learn\nto differentiate those two,\nwhich is how my kid can actually get\nto a more regulated place.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full\nlength episode by clicking here."
