    "transcript": "I'd like to ask you about another area\nwhere you really have seemed\nto see around corners,\nand this is one that\nactually carried with it\nsignificant risk,\nnot necessarily risk\nto health and to life,\nbut risk in terms of outside perceptions,\nand that's psychedelics.\nAs you know,\nI've substantially\nchanged my view on this.\nWe don't need to go into\nmy former stance on it.\nI talked about that when\nyou were gracious enough\nto host me on your\npodcast for a second time.\nDone some psychedelics\nrecreationally as a kid.\nIt was correlated with not\nso great times in my life.\nStayed away from them,\nthen eventually revisited,\nMDMA, in particular, from\na therapeutic standpoint,\nfound tremendous benefit,\nagain, therapeutically,\nwith a medical doctor.\nAgain, these drugs are illegal.\nSoon to change, perhaps, hopefully,\nand we'll talk about that.\nBut it's becoming clear\nfrom the controlled studies\nby Robin Carhart-Harris,\nthere are many others, okay,\nNolan Williams, others,\nthat these drugs have enormous potential\nto help relieve depression, trauma,\nhelp people explore\ntheir psyche, their mind,\nfor sake of feeling better,\ndoing better in the world,\nfor leaning into life.\nNot tune in, drop out,\nbut to really lean into\nlife with more purpose\nand more satisfaction.\nIn some cases, they've really\nhave saved lives, I think.\nWhat was your mindset around psychedelics\nwhen you first started exploring them?\nWhat led you to overcome the\ninevitable fear gap there?\nBecause you do seem like somebody\nwho takes value in your health,\nright, you're not reckless.\nYou may have been more\nadventurous in the past\nwith things like, I hate the word,\nbut biohacking and self\nexperimentation, than you are now,\nbut you obviously have\nsome self-preservation mechanism intact.\nWe learn, we learn.\nWe learn.\nWhat was your mindset\naround it at the time?\nAnd then I want to get to\nwhat you've learned from it,\nand frankly, the tremendous\nefforts that you've put,\nthat are now translating\nto tremendous value\nfor really millions of\npeople, and ultimately,\nI think it's going to\nbe billions of people,\nby establishing funding\nfor the pioneering research in this area,\nhelping to promote the\nmovement of these compounds\nfrom illegal to legal in\nthe therapeutic setting,\nso on and so on.\nSo take us back to your\nfirst thoughtful exploration\nof psychedelics.\nWhat'd that look like?\nYou're like, \"Oh,\nmushrooms, I'll eat 'em.\"\nWas that it or was it,\nor was it a dedicated research process?\nAnd who'd you talk to,\nwhat was it all about?\nSo let's go way back to\nmy undergrad experience,\nand there were many reasons\nthat I ended up going to Princeton.\nI think I was very lucky to get in.\nMy SAT scores, because I could\nnever finish the damn test.\nI was so much of a perfectionist,\nI would get stuck and ended\nup not doing terribly well.\nBut through essays and other things,\nultimately, was able to go.\nWell, let me interrupt you and just say,\nI think at this point we can say,\nthey were lucky to have you.\nWell, thank you for saying that.\nANDREW: Yeah, yeah.\nThank you for saying that.\nGreat institution and you've done great,\nand you're a great poster\non the wall for them.\nYeah, I hope so.\nReally, really, really.\nI just want to say it\n'cause you're not going to,\nand I think it's important\nthat these are great institutions,\nhave great minds go through there,\nand Einstein went through there.\nYeah, he did, he did.\nAnd their success rests\nnot just on the Einsteins,\nbut also on the student body\nand what they go out\ninto the world and do.\nAnd not just in the realm\nof science, so really,\nthey're lucky to have had you.\nYeah, thank you, Andrew.\nI studied Chinese in a room\nwhere Einstein used to teach.\nIt's pretty cool to set foot\nand spend time weekly in a space\nthat was shared by some of these people.\nAmazing.\nIt really gets the imagination firing.\nIf we go back to that chapter in my life,\nI was initially a psychology major\nwith a focus on neuroscience,\nso I wanted to be a neuroscientist.\nAnd there are many reasons for that.\nI have neurodegenerative disease\non both sides of my family,\nso Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,\nso that was certainly a\npersonal driving interest,\nin terms of looking at mechanisms,\nunderstanding what therapeutics\nexisted or did not exist,\nhow things were developing\nin the research.\nAnd while I was there,\nwhich later, I ended up switching gears\nand transferring to focus\non language acquisition\nand East Asian studies,\nhence the Chinese that\nI mentioned earlier,\nand Japanese and Korean.\nBut on the neuroscience side,\nthere were a lot of\ncool breakthroughs also\nthat came out of Princeton\naround that time,\nlooking at the amazing\ndiscovery of say neuronal,\nI don't want to say regenesis,\nbut neurogenesis in the hippocampus.\nIt was Gould's work.\nExactly, exactly.\nVery familiar with that.\nSo there was\nquite a bit happening at that time.\nI was a subject.\nI loved volunteering for studies,\njust to try to get an inside\nlook at how things were done\nin some of Daniel Kahneman's experiments.\nSo, it was a cool time to be there.\nAnd within the first two\nyears, I want to say,\nI had my first experience\nrecreationally with mushrooms.\nAnd looking back now, I mean,\nI'm horrified by just the lack of control,\nand meaning, not control, but\nlack of supervision, right.\nI mean, the setting,\nthe set and setting ended up being fine,\nnothing terrible happened,\nbut there were a lot of ways\nit could have gone sideways.\nBut that first experience,\nand I must have consumed in retrospect,\njust a dizzying amount of mushrooms.\nI mean.\nWould this be\nin excess of five grams?\nIt would've been more, yeah,\njust knowing what I know\nnow, it would've been.\nKids, don't do this at all.\nDon't do that.\nI'm not going to say don't do it at home.\nDon't do it at all.\nYeah, yeah.\nPlease, I actually don't think\nthe young developing brain\nshould be exposed to psychedelics.\nWe could talk about that.\nALEXANDER: We can talk about that.\nYeah, we can talk about.\nI'm going to take my stance.\nI'm going to take my stance for now.\nI mean, in the world in\nwhich we live in the US,\nI would totally agree with you.\nThere are some interesting\ncultural exceptions\nin other places,\nwhere things are more set up\nto provide for that type of use,\nbut I certainly would not recommend it.\nBut coming back to my\nrecreational experience,\nmy subjective experience was so bizarre,\nand my experience of time so non-linear,\nmy experience of self so\ndifferent from anything\nI had experienced up to that point.\nAnd therefore, my construction of reality\nbeing so completely unlike\nanything I had experienced\nwas enough to make me want to\nlearn about these compounds.\nAnd very early on, I still\nhave a scan of it somewhere,\nI think it was in 1998 or\n'99, I actually wrote a paper,\none of my junior papers was focused on\nexamining potential similarities\nbetween REM sleep and LSD, LSD 25,\nand looking at some of the\npatterns of neural activity.\nOf course, we can do a lot more now\nwith the tools that we have available,\nbut from a scientific perspective,\nI was very curious about how much we knew\nand how much we didn't know.\nAnd I would say that latter category\ngets me more excited in a way.\nI'm like, okay, how much room\nis there for growth here?\nRight, because,\nif we're just putting\non the finishing touches\nwith marginal, incremental improvements\non something that we feel like\nwe've largely figured out,\nthat's less interesting to me\nthan something that baffles\nmost people examining them on some level.\nAnd there was a professor\nnamed Barry Jacobs,\nwho was doing some very interesting work.\nHe did a lot of work looking\nat the serotonergic systems\nand did a lot of work with cats.\nUltimately, I could not do personally\nthe animal work required\nof the sort of indentured\nservitude that I would.\nI think you wrote\nsomeplace once, you said,\n\"When confronted with the\nprospect of installing\n\"a computer printer into the head of cat.\"\nA printer jack on the back of a cat head.\nOn the back of a cat head.\nThey literally had those,\nlike those little VGA ports,\non the back of these cats' heads,\nbecause cats sleep a lot,\nand so they're interesting to study.\nYeah, a lot of that cats,\nvery few laboratories\nwork on cats any longer.\nIt's mostly a mouse, still\nsome non-human primate work.\nMy laboratory has essentially shut down\nor is in the process of shutting\ndown even our mouse work.\nI much prefer to work on humans.\nThey can give consent,\nand they house themselves,\nand the animal research thing is tough\nfor any sentient being.\nYeah, it's tough.\nThe cat, for what it's worth,\nthe cats seemed pretty happy.\nLike, they were just sleeping,\nand the ports were for tracking.\nSo the cats were pretty, I mean,\nthey were just normal cats.\nThe cats were fine, but I would've been,\nwe would've been injecting\nretroviruses into rats\nand then perfusing them, which\nmeans bleeding them to death,\nto avoid bruising of the tissue.\nBecause then if you're going\nto take thin slices and scans,\nyou didn't want to have bruising.\nAnd I just couldn't do it.\nI think it's important.\nI do think.\nI do think there's a place\nfor it, but I couldn't do it,\nso that's why I transferred out.\nBut the point I was trying to make is\nthat I had the experience\nand then I had that drive,\nthe scientific interest,\nand then I had probably\none experience per year\nfor a few years after that.\nAnd what I noticed for myself personally,\nbecause I've suffered from\nmajor depressive disorder\nand extended depressive\nepisodes, let's just say,\non average, three to four a year.\nAnd by extended.\nEven before you had started?\nEven before.\nFrom a young age.\nYeah,\nfrom a very young age.\nAnd I would say,\nso let's just call it three\nto four on average a year.\nThose could last each a\nfew weeks or a few months.\nI mean, this is a very high\npercentage of my total year,\nand when I had these higher\ndose experiences with mushrooms,\nso we're talking about\npsilocybe mushrooms,\nand then if we're looking at\nthe molecule that's being\nexamined scientifically,\npsilocybin.\nI noticed this afterglow\neffect that was really durable\nand that was an antidepressant effect\nor a mood elevating effect,\nthat lasted far longer\nthan the half-life could explain, right.\nBecause four to six hours,\nyou're kind of on the other side,\nand I would experience\nthis afterglow effect\nfor three to six months.\nAnd that raised all sorts\nof interesting questions.\nWhat the hell is going on here?\nIs it the content?\nIs it some structural change?\nThere were a lot of\nunanswered questions for me.\nAnd then I had a very,\nvery scary experience\nthat led me to completely\nstop use of psychedelics,\nwhere again, uncontrolled environment,\nended up in rural New York,\ncoming out of my trip,\nstanding in the middle of the road\nin the middle of the night\nwith headlights coming at me.\nGoodness gracious.\nSo you don't want to do that,\nand I was like, okay, too dangerous.\nWere you taking them alone?\nIs that how that is?\nI was taking them with two friends,\nand my two friends without telling me,\njust went for a walk and left me alone.\nSo don't do that.\nWell, points to the,\nI mean, these are powerful compounds.\nYeah, you're playing with nuclear power.\nLike, this is the nuclear power\nof like psychological or\npsycho-emotional surgery\nis the way I'd encourage\npeople to think about them.\nAnd I stopped using any\npsychedelics completely.\nI was still very interested in them,\nbut I basically hit pause,\nand I didn't revisit that\nuntil, let's call it 2012, 2013,\nwhere I was still struggling\nwith major depressive disorder,\nand I saw my girlfriend at the time\ncompletely transformed by\nsupervised, facilitated use\nof, in this case, ayahuasca,\nwhich was not quite as common\nas it is in conversation at the time.\nAnd she did that in South America.\nBut she not only explained her experience,\nbut I was able to see\nthe transformation in her\nthat seemed to have some\ndurability over time.\nAnd that is when I started stepping back\ninto researching psychedelics,\nlooking at what had been published\nin the last, let's just call it 10 years\nas of that point in time,\nand thinking about how I would\napproach it systematically,\nwith safeguards, with proper supervision,\nbasically approaching it the way\nI would've approached any of the topics\nin \"The 4-Hour Body.\"\nAnd that is what led me back into,\nalong with a number of other\ninterventions, I should say,\nso I wasn't betting the\nfarm on psychedelics.\nI also started TM at that point.\nI was, I was.\nCan you just,\nsome people might,\ntranscendental.\nTranscendental meditation.\nThese are like four to 10\nday meditation retreats.\nThis was actually much shorter.\nIt was a two or three day training,\nand you're visiting the instructor,\nI want to say it's once or twice\na day, probably once a day,\nand getting up to speed.\nAnd I did this because\nI was going through a\nperiod of acute stress.\nThis was finishing \"The 4-Hour Chef.\"\nThis was actually probably\nin the years preceding that.\nAnd I had one friend who\nI'd seen really change from,\nlet's just call hyperkinetic\nhigh anxiety to low anxiety.\nAnd he said, \"You have the\ntime, you have the money,\n\"pay for the course, just take it.\n\"Yes, there are all\nthese criticisms of TM.\n\"Yes, there are all these\nweird historical anecdotes\n\"of people trying to levitate\nand all this weirdness.\n\"Just ignore that.\"\nTrying to levitate, nothing against that.\nIf you actually levitate, then\nwe got to have a discussion,\nbut trying to levitate seems like a,\nevery kid tries all sorts of things.\nGive it a go.\nHe's like, \"Just put that aside,\"\nbecause I kept coming up with pushback.\nAnd he's like, \"Look, all I'm saying is\n\"it's like a warm bath for your mind\n\"that you take twice a day,\n\"and it'll chill you the\nfuck out, so try it.\"\nAnd I was like, \"Okay, fine.\"\nThat's a good endorsement.\nI was like, at this point I was,\nI had been burning the candle\nat both ends so intensely,\nit's like, \"Okay.\"\nSo there's TM,\nand then I began examining\nhow I might approach.\nNotice, I didn't just\njump into using them.\nI was like, how could I\napproach taking psychedelics\nin a sequence,\nin a logical sequence\nwith proper protections,\nwith safety assurances?\nAnd that took me probably a month or two,\nand I was right in the middle of things.\nIn Northern California,\nyou have access to a lot.\nAnd only then did I start looking at\nhaving my own experiences.\nAnd lo and behold, I mean,\nI'll cut to the chase,\nbut the personal outcome,\nand there are many different\nbenefits and risks,\nI should make very clear.\nThese things can be extremely\ndangerous in certain ways,\ngenerally, not physiologically,\nbut they can be dangerous.\nI would say instead of\nthree to four times per year on average,\nI probably have one depressive\nepisode every two years.\nThat's a significant improvement.\nThat, right.\nI mean, from a quality\nof life perspective,\nthose are two different people.\nAnd that then led me to,\nand as I did with all my workouts, right,\nI took copious notes over the span.\nI mean, now we're\nlooking at 10 plus years,\nso if I were to ever write another book,\nit would probably be related\nto all of the really fine details\nof the experiments and my learnings,\nincluding some of the more bizarre things\nover the last 10 years.\nBut it would be just\na beast to create, so.\nWith psychedelics,\nexperiences with psychedelics?\nPsychedelics and sort of\npsychedelic adjacent\nnon-ordinary experiences\nof consciousness,\nwhich I think often are touching\nat edges of the same thing,\nwhich is going to be\ncontroversial for some folks.\nBut to come back to the storyline,\njust to put a bow on that,\nwhen I saw the personal outcomes for me,\nthe anec data from friends\nwho are facilitators,\nwho've worked with\nthousands of people, right,\nwhich is a pretty good\nsample size, still anecdote.\nBut these are people who are\nvery smart, who keep records,\nand I believe that these\npeople have spotted patterns\nthat are only going to be\npossible to test and verify\nover the next five to 10 years.\nSo, at least as a means\nof generating hypotheses,\nI take these people very seriously.\nAnd then I started to connect\nwith scientists whose work I had read,\nlike Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins,\nbegan looking at the most compelling data\nrelated to say MDMA assisted psychotherapy\nand complex PTSD.\nI made the commitment to myself,\nthat as soon as I had enough\nmoney to move the dial,\n'cause I really felt like these tools\nwere so outside of the normal paradigm\nof psychiatry and pharmacology,\nand that made me very excited.\nBecause it was uncrowded,\nthere's very little funding\ncoming into the space.\nIt was high leverage,\nand I looked at it\njust as I've looked at my\nmany startup investments,\nlimited downside risk,\nreally high upside potential.\nAnd I should say before that,\nI had already been funding\nin a very small way, science,\nso the first check I\never wrote was personally\nto Adam Gazzaley's lab at UCSF.\nYeah, great lab.\nWhich at the time, was\nlooking at software.\nHe's not going to like this description,\nbut I'm going to simplify it.\nSoftware that might attenuate\nor reverse age-related\ncognitive impairment,\nspecifically related to\nvarious aspects of attention.\nAnd that was my first foray\ninto funding early stage science,\nwhich was very analogous to me\nto funding early stage startups.\nAnd then later on, to touch\non the reputational thing,\nI know this is a TED talk,\nso thank you for listening.\nNo, this is great.\nPlease, you're always so\ngracious on your podcast,\nthis is what people want.\nThis is certainly what I want to hear, so.\nSo on the reputational side,\nyou're right that at the time, especially,\nlet's just call it 2013 to 2015,\nthis was not a comfortable\nnational conversation\nof any type.\nYeah, I wouldn't have had\nthis conversation back then.\nNo way.\nI'd lose, I don't know that\nI would've lost my job,\nit just would've raised a lot of eyebrows,\nbut now, such studies are\nhappening at Stanford too.\nYeah, the perception.\nYeah, the perception was\nthat these are a professional third rail,\nat the very least, right.\nAlso illegal, therefore,\nif I talk about them,\nam I giving someone probable cause?\nAm I going to get myself in some type\nof really tricky legal\nsituation, et cetera?\nThere are a lot of considerations.\nBut I tested that, just like I was saying,\nI like to capture my assumptions on paper\nso I can stress test.\nAnd I was like, okay, I\nthink that might be true.\nMost people I know think\nthat is true, but is it true?\nHow could we test to see\nif that is true or not?\nAnd I decided to crowdfund\nfor a Hopkins pilot study\nlooking at psilocybin for\ntreatment resistant depression.\nAnd I thought to myself,\nokay, we have a couple of,\na couple of things\nfalling in our favor here.\nNumber one, depression\ndoes not discriminate,\nso across socioeconomic\nclasses, across gender,\nacross race, this is a problem.\nAlmost everyone knows\nsomeone who takes antidepressants\nwho is still depressed.\nTreatment resistant depression\ntherefore is the indication,\npsilocybin is the intervention.\nLet me crowdfund,\nand I did that throughout\nthe time through Crowdrise,\nwhich was co-founded by Edward Norton,\nwho had become a friend and was.\nThe actor, Edward Norton?\nThe actor,\nwho's very smart, very, very, very smart.\nAlso one of the best\ninvestors I've ever met,\nwhich a lot of people don't know.\nVery bright guy, and so crowdfunded.\nAnd I also like to put my\nmoney where my mouth is.\nI said, \"Okay guys,\nI'm going to seed this,\n\"like I'm putting in X,\nthe goal is to raise,\n\"I think it was 80,000,\nsomething like that,\n\"for the following study,\"\nand then I was like,\n\"Let's see, let's see what happens.\"\nAnd there was basically\nzero negative blowback,\nand not only was there no\ndiscernible negative blowback,\na number of people, and\nthis was deliberate,\nI wanted to see this.\nA number of people came\nout of the woodwork\nto support in a bigger way,\nand I was like, oh, okay, I see you,\na bunch, a handful of folks I knew.\nAnd I was like, oh, interesting, okay,\nthere are at least a half a dozen folks\nwho are studying the same thing\nor paying attention to the same thing.\nAnd then I just got bolder.\nI was like, okay, if I\ntested that, let me push,\nand then let's see what\nhappens and I'll wait.\nAnd lo and behold,\nI realized that the perception\ndid not match the reality.\nThe reality was, if you're\ntalking about indications,\nthat cause an incredible\namount of suffering\nfor a very large number of people,\neven those who are anti-drug per se,\njust say no to drugs, want solutions.\n[Music Playing]"
