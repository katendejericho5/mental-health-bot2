    "transcript": "When people who have\ncommon interests decide\nto get together and talk\nand listen and brainstorm\nand I'm yet to do that in a,\nyou know, with good people\nand not have something really\nincredible come out of it.\nNot necessarily that day.\nTIM: Yeah.\nBut looking five years,\nlooking back, five years later\nand just going, God, that\nwas really worthwhile.\nTIM: Totally.\nANDREW: Yeah.\nFew thoughts in no particular order.\nI would say the first is, it depends,\nmy recommendations depend a lot on\nwhere you are in the arc\nof your career and life.\nIf you are in full growth\nhyper drive mode and you are trying to\nbuild both yourself\nand your capabilities in\na very concentrated way\nwhere you're not necessarily\nfocused on family,\nyou maybe have fewer obligations,\nthen if you're serious,\nI think many people should consider moving\nto an area of high density\nfor a period of time.\nIt could be three months,\nit could be six months, could be longer.\nBut putting yourself\nin a New York or in LA\nor San Francisco or Chicago\nor as new places develop,\nI'll give you one you might not expect,\nsay in Ottawa, Canada,\nwhere Shopify is based\nand the presence and growth of Shopify\nhas spawned an entire\necosystem of startups.\nSo there may be options\noutside of the usual\ncast of characters,\nPittsburgh and Duolingo, similar effect.\nSo there are more options\nthan people might recognize.\nBut taking a journey\nand placing yourself in a place\nwhere you can be in a very\nactive pinball machine\nwhere you may interact serendipitously\nwith many different people\nfrom many different worlds,\nI think is hard to overstate the value of\nand my drive\nand my filtering function, let's just say.\n'Cause when I first got to the Bay Area,\nnobody cared about me.\nI was nobody.\nI was driving, my mom's used minivan\nhand-me-down that had the seats stolen out\nof the back.\nIt looked terrible.\nWere you in the, were\nyou in the South Bay?\nI was, I was working in San Jose, yeah.\nI mean, no disrespect to San Jose.\nI'm from the South Bay.\nTIM: Yeah.\nBut there's a, there's a\nbleakness to the South Bay.\nThere is, there is a\nlittle bit of bleakness.\nAnd then I lived across the\nstreet in this tiny apartment,\nlived across the street\nfrom the Jack in the Box\nin Mountain View.\nSo it's not like I was\nstrolling onto the big stage\nand just blowing people away.\nOh, I grew up right near Mountain View.\nI'm very familiar.\nI probably skated the curves\nat that Jack in the Box.\nYou probably did.\nDid you train at the Gold's\nGym in, off Rengstorff?\nI did actually.\nAmazing.\nTIM: Yeah. Yeah.\nThat was a great gym.\nTIM: That was a great gym.\nThat was a great gym.\nI don't think it's still there.\nI would go there super late\nbefore my writing sessions.\nAnd it had the benefit of being open\nreally, really late and wow\nRengstorff, I haven't thought\nabout that in a long time.\nSo the point is, I also\nstarted where a lot\nof people are starting\nand what did I do?\nI put myself in a high\ndensity environment.\nNext, what did I do knowing no one?\nI started to volunteer at events\nwhere they had interesting speakers\nand interesting people coming\nto hear those speakers.\nSo I put myself in Silicon Valley\nand then I began volunteering\nfor groups like SVASE\nI don't know if it exists anymore.\nThe Silicon Valley Association\nof Startup Entrepreneurs,\nI think it was.\nTiE the Indus Entrepreneur,\nwhich is a very sort of Indian\nor Indian American focused organization\nthat does a lot in the realm of startups.\nAnd I would carry water,\nI would take out garbage,\nI would check name badges,\nI would check people in.\nNothing was too low for me.\nAnd I'll give you guys a tip\nthat will be obvious to some,\nbut non-obvious to many,\nwhen you are volunteering,\na lot of folks who volunteer\ndo the absolute bare minimum\nbecause they're not getting paid.\nThis is not going to get you noticed,\nbut it sets a very low bar so\nthat if you volunteer at these events\nand someone's dropping the ball\nor there's something\nhappening that needs fixing\nand you just proactively do it,\nthe producers of these\nevents will notice you.\nAnd this is what happened over time,\nover a few months.\nAnd then I got invited\nto join in on meetings\nthat were planning future events.\nAnd I eventually got to the point\nwhere I was recruiting speakers\nand able to set the agenda\nfor an entire main event.\nAnd then that's how I got\nto know, say Jack Canfield,\nwho is the co-creator of\nChicken Soup for the Soul\nand many others who\nintroduced me to my book agent\nmany, many, many, many\nyears later, Jack Canfield.\nBut I was a nobody then.\nYou have to play the long game.\nBut you can be methodical\nin how you play that.\nAnd that is one approach,\njust as an example\nfor how to build your network,\nwhich snowballs over time.\nDon't hump every VIP's\nleg within 10 minutes\nof meeting them.\nPlay it cool, you know,\nAnd the gatherings where that person is,\nhas a lot of demands on them,\nis the last place you\nwant to do that, right?\nYeah, the way you're going\nto make yourself memorable...\nANDREW: No saliency to that.\nYeah, the way you're going\nto make yourself memorable\nwith people like that is\nto be very professional,\nalways on time,\npredict what they're going to need\nor problems they'll run into beforehand\nand address them before\nthey even think of them.\nAnd be easy to deal with.\nAnd people like that,\nhigh performers notice these things.\nThey will make note of it.\nYeah, the being easy to\nwork with is something that\nI used to tell my graduate\nstudents, postdocs,\nI mean it, because the opposite of that\nnobody wants.\nTIM: Yeah.\nRight? Nobody wants that.\nYeah, especially in the beginning,\nlike later, okay great.\nYou're Steve Jobs, you want to\nbe difficult here and there,\nor a lot, no problem.\nANDREW: Yeah.\nRight? But in the beginning,\nthat can be a real liability.\nYou can make up for that\nif you're the best in the world.\nBut in the very beginning\nyou probably won't be.\nSo try to stack the deck in your favor.\nVolunteering is a shortcut.\nAnd that would be one way of doing it.\nAnother, now, especially given\nthe virtual communities that exist,\nso you have subreddits, you\nhave online communities,\nyou have Twitter groups,\nyou have Clubhouse,\nyou've got a million different options,\nwhich can be overwhelming.\nIs Clubhouse still going?\nMaybe not, I have no idea.\nOh no, I don't know, I'm\nnot saying it's gone.\nI just, I remember during the pandemic,\nthere were some Clubhouse gatherings,\nI hopped on there and,\nbut I've sort of forgotten\nto, to get on there.\nMaybe not,\nthe platform Affinity is really fickle,\nwhich is why I think\nto the extent possible,\nif you want to build a world class,\nand I use that term very deliberately,\nnetwork in record time,\njust to give you a nice headline,\nI would say focus on\nthe uncrowded channel,\nwhich is in person, it's out of fashion,\nit's out of vogue.\nGoing to a conference\nand actually interacting\nwith humans in the hallway,\napproaching panelists.\nThis is another thing that I did.\nI'll give it, I'll give another tip.\nSo very early on I\nwould go to conferences.\nNobody cared who I was,\nnobody knew who I was.\nFine.\nAnd I would study the panels.\nLet's say I'm going to a big\nevent like South by Southwest.\nAnd I would, this is what I did in 2007,\nwhich was just prior to\nthe first book coming out.\nAnd I would go to these\nvarious in-person events.\nI was focused mostly\non events that had the,\nthe thematic focus of blogs.\nWe could come back to that.\nBut blogs were what podcasts\nwere a few years ago, right?\nThey drove incredible traffic,\nbut they were undervalued\nby mainstream media,\nundervalued by mainstream\npublishers, et cetera.\nWhich meant there was an\narbitrage opportunity, in a way.\nAnd I would pick say a handful of panels\nwith topics I thought\nwere super interesting.\nAnd then the panel would\nend and what would happen?\nThe panelists would get rushed\nby various folks because\nmany of 'em were well known.\nWho was not getting rushed?\nThe moderator.\nI would go straight to the moderator\nand I would talk to the moderator.\nI'd thank them for the panel.\nI would be very genuine.\nNone of it was made up\nand talk to 'em for a bit.\nThey would generally ask why I was there,\nwhat I was interested in.\nI would mention whatever\nthat happened to be.\nIn this case it was, I'm\nfinishing my first book\nor I had my first book coming out soon.\nI'm here to hopefully meet people\nwho are involved with A, B, or C.\nAnd then if we hit it off,\nwhich was not true every time,\nbut if it seemed to be going well,\nI would say, I don't know anyone here.\nI'm really sort of orphaned here\nmaking my way through this entire event.\nIs there anyone else here you\nthink I would get along with,\nwho maybe I could buy a drink or a coffee?\nAnd the vast majority of\nthe time they'd be like,\noh yeah, you should meet so and so.\nAnd then I get the introduction\nand then I would meet that person.\nI would have a genuine\ninteraction with that person.\nAnd if it made sense,\nif things were going well,\nI'd do the same thing.\nIs there anybody else here you think\nI should just say hi to?\nAnd that I'd get along with?\nNot who I can ask for something.\nAnd that wasn't deception.\nI was being honest, like\nsomeone I could actually\nvibe with.\nAnd if so, would you\nmind making the intro?\nYeah, sure, no problem.\nMany of those people are still my friends.\nAnd by being surgical in that way,\nnot trying to gather business cards,\nto use a really antiquated\nmetaphor at this point.\nPeople still hand 'em out.\nYeah, people still hand 'em out,\nI guess depends on where you are,\nespecially like Boston.\nBut if, rather than\ntrying to collect people\nas Pokemon cards.\nDeveloping say five, three\nto five, deeper relationships\nthrough longer conversations at an event,\nthat is what directly led ultimately\nto the hockey stick\nfor the 4-Hour Workweek\nwithin tech within\nspecifically San Francisco.\nSo those would be a few approaches for,\nfor building your network\nwhen you don't have the ability\nto just walk up to say a Kevin Kelly\nand have a conversation.\nThat came over time.\nYeah whether or not it's health practices,\nor nutritional practices,\nor at meetings, seems\nyou're oriented toward\nthe uncrowded, but very\ninteresting people in spaces.\nMhmm.\nBut the key word there\nI think is uncrowded.\nAnd of course the other key\nword is interesting, right?\nI mean it's not like you're\nstanding in the parking lot\ntalking to whoever happens to be there.\nAlthough that can be interesting, right?\nThere's a serendipity there.\nAnd you know, there's always\nthings to learn from people,\nbut in terms of career advancement and,\nand building new ideas,\nand foraging for information,\nI'm just struck how you've\ndone that over and over.\nAnd again, thank you for giving us some\ninsight into the process.\nI've got another one.\nPlease.\nAlright, here's another one.\nSo I think there's a\ntendency among people who\nwant to develop their networks\nor their relationships to be starfuckers.\nNot to get too technical, but...\nThat's a technical term.\nYeah, yeah.\nYeah.\nAnd they want to tell other\npeople they are friends\nwith someone more than they want\nto develop skills or learn from someone.\nThis puts you in a very\ndisadvantaged position.\nBecause then that means,\nalright, you want to become friends\nwith Elon Musk, good luck.\nOr you want to become friends\nwith this A-lister celebrity\nwho everyone else wants to meet?\nGood luck.\nIt's going to be a crowded,\nbloody path to get there.\nAnd by the way, they've\nalso certainly developed\nreally attuned defenses\nagainst people like you.\nSo it's going to be hard on the other...\nYeah, they have staff to\nprevent that from happening.\nOh yeah, they have a phalanx of protectors\nto prevent you from ever\ngetting to that person.\nOn the other hand, if\nyou're approaching it from\nthe standpoint of developing skills,\nlearning, and actually\nbecoming potential friends\nwith someone, I'll give you an example.\nYou could go after, you\nwant to become better\nat boxing.\nLet's just make that up.\nAlright.\nMaybe not the greatest example,\nskiing would be another one.\nBut let's stick with boxing just\nbecause of the way I'll explain it.\nIf you wanted to say,\nget personalized lessons\nfrom Floyd Mayweather,\nain't going to happen.\nOkay, let's go then\nmaybe a step down out of the\npro ranks to gold medalist.\nOkay, if it's a brand new gold medalist,\nlet's just say like Oscar De La Hoya,\nwhen he was really the golden boy and\nhad just thrashed everyone,\nstill going to be hard.\nWhat about the silver medalist\nwho just had a bad day\nwhen he had that last about\nagainst Oscar De La Hoya?\nPotentially, right?\nFrom a technical perspective.\nFrom a personal, connection perspective,\nyou may have more in\ncommon with that person\nor a bronze medalist and they can get you\n70, 80, 90% of the way there.\nAnd by the way, you probably\ndon't have the physical\nattributes to make it to\na hundred percent anyway,\nif you're coming to it this late.\nAnd you could get, in many cases,\none-on-one lessons,\nwhether in person or virtually\nwith someone who is of that caliber.\nThey're in the same front of the pack as\nthe names I just mentioned,\nmaybe not as famous.\nA hundred bucks, 200 bucks per hour?\nFor a lot of people that is within reach.\n[Music Playing]"
