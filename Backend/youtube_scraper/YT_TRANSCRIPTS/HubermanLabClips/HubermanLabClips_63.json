    "transcript": "What was your mindset around the time\nthat you wrote \"4-Hour Body.\n4-Hour Work Week.\"\nbut in particular Four Hour Body?\nBecause the protocols in that book\nare so very useful.\nThey were at the time it was published,\nthey still are now.\nAnd so many of the things, like ice baths.\nThe discussion around\nbrown fat thermogenesis.\nResistance training in its you know,\nkind of basic form\nof just providing enough\nprogressive overload\nto get an adaptation,\nnot excessively long workouts.\nWeight loss.\nSlow carb diet and on and on and on.\nWhat were you thinking at that time?\nLike what, if you can\nthink back to them like,\nwhat were you foraging for?\nWhat were you thinking\nabout when you woke up\nin the morning thinking,\n\"Oh, I'm going to go find all this stuff\nthat the time was really esoteric\n'cause it has all played out very well.\nWhat I'm basically saying is,\nif you want to know what's going to be\nhappening hot and useful in five years,\n10 years and onwards,\njust look at what Tim's\ndoing at any moment.\nSo there it is.\nWell, thank you for the very generous\ncomparison and intro.\nI'm thrilled to be here.\nSo thanks for having me.\nAnd the 4-Hour Body\nrepresented an opportunity\nfor me to do a few things.\nThe first was to diversify my identity\nfrom outside of the realm of\nthe say business category.\nSo it was a deliberate\nmove since the success\nof the first book book\nbought me permission\nto do something else that publishers\nwould still want to gamble on.\nI wanted to see if I could maybe like\na Michael Lewis take my audience with me\nto other topics.\nSo that was a lateral move\nthat was very deliberate\nfrom a career optionality standpoint.\nAnd then I was doing,\nI think what I've done\nfor a very long time,\nand what I enjoy doing which is,\nlooking at the most prevalent beliefs,\nand maybe dogmatic\nassumptions in a given field,\ncould be anything.\nIf anyone says always,\n\"Never should I pay attention,\nand take note of that.\"\nThey may very well be right.\nBut if anything is said in absolutes,\nI like to stress test.\nAnd in the case of say,\nphysical performance\nor physical manipulation, tracking,\n2008, 2009 was a very interesting time\nbecause a number of different technologies\nwere coming online,\nmeaning being adopted by small groups.\nYou had the very early stages\nof say accelerometers as wearables.\nYou had a number of different innovations,\nand means of tracking\nthat had never been available before.\nYou had for instance,\nand this took a bit a\nferreting on my side,\nit wasn't immediately on the roadmap\nfor our body,\nbut continuous glucose monitors.\nAt the time that was,\nI want to say ex exclusively limited\nto type one diabetics\nor maybe type two diabetics,\nbut largely type one diabetics.\nAnd what captured my interest,\nand I can't recall how I came across it,\nbut it was probably through\nthe very earliest iterations\nof what later became the quantified\nself-movement.\nAnd I remember attending the very first\ngathering at Kevin Kelly's house\nin Pacifica, California.\nThis was around 2009, 12 people, 13 people\nto discuss quantifying health.\nBut the example of\na professional race car driver,\nI can't remember the form factor,\nwhether it was F1 or NASCAR or other\nwho was using this\ncontinual glucose monitor\nfor paying attention\nto glucose levels while driving.\nAnd I thought to myself,\n\"Would that not be useful\nfor healthy normals?\nWould that not have other applications?\nIf this is being used by a high performer\nin this type of context,\nmight it have other types of applications?\nWhich then led me to use\nthe very early versions\nof Dexcom, which were\nreally painful to implant?\nNo longer the case.\nOf course that's changed a lot.\nAnd I wanted to see\nhow I might be able to find\na handful of different\ncategories of things.\nThere's the new, like the genuinely new.\nLike CGM at that point was genuinely new.\nThe very old that might have\nsome room for scientific investigation.\nAnd I would say, when I say scientific,\nI don't necessarily mean\nrandomized control trials at a university.\nI do think as an N of one,\nif you think about study design,\nand you can even blind,\nyou could even placebo control.\nAnd I knew people in the small subculture\nof quantified self who did this.\nYou can, I think approach things\nin a methodical way\nwhere you can make a lot of progress,\nand trying to determine causality\nor lack thereof.\nLooking at very old things,\nLooking at orphaned things.\nSo for instance, there are many examples\nin the world of doping where you have say,\nBalco back in the day where famously\nBerry Bonds and others purportedly\nused things like the cream and the clear.\nAnd these were based\non anabolics that were\nsourced from Soviet literature\nor older literature from the 50s and 60s\nthat might not be on the radar\nof say the anti-doping groups\nthat would administer the testing.\nSo all of these different buckets\nwere of interest to me,\nand I begin where I usually do,\nwhich is interviewing folks.\nSo I would interview one or two people\nin a given field,\nand I might ask them\nany number of questions.\nSo one is,\n\"What are the nerds doing\non the weekends or at night?\"\nThis is also really good for investing.\nIt's like, All right.\nWhat are the really technical nerds doing\nat night or on the weekends\nafter they've put in a really long workday\nor a work week?\nLet's take a really close look at that.\nAnother one is,\nand I'll create a flow for this, but,\n\"What are rich people doing now\nthat everyone or tens\nor hundreds of millions\nof people might be doing\n10 years from now?\"\nAnd an example of that would be,\nlet's just say full-time assistant,\nvirtual assistant, AI.\nRight?\nSo we've seen the needs,\nand wants being addressed\nby different technology,\nbut it's an iteration of the same thing\non some level,\nin the case of say using ChatGPT\ntied into Zapier for various functions,\nand then where are\npeople cobbling together\nawkward solutions.\nSo where are people piecing together\nawkward solutions,\nand is there room for some type of\ninnovation there?\nThese are a few of the questions\nthat I would not only ask myself,\nbut ask experts in different areas.\nSo if I end up spending time\nsay this was a few years prior\nto writing the \"4-Hour Body\"\nI spent time at NASA Ames,\nand was interacting with\na number of scientists,\nsome people who were working on\nall sorts of biological tests,\nand looking at genomics,\nand had a very frank discussion\nabout where they thought.\nIf they had to push, right?\nSo I'll ask questions like,\npush a little bit into the realm\nof science fiction and speculation\nbecause I'm sure you can't support\nany type of projection like that\nwith the literature, with\nscientific literature.\nBut what do you think\nsome of the risks are\nof say publishing your genome?\nBecause at the time,\na number of high profile folks\nhad just made their\nfull genomes available,\nand they're like, well,\nI think in the near future it'd be\npossible to reconstruct\nsomeone's face based\non their genetic data.\nAnd they're like, high\ndegree of confidence.\nThey're like 0 to 100% how confident.\nThey're like, \"Yeah,\n\"80, 90%.\nI'm like, \"Okay.\"\nI should pay attention to that.\nBecause if you're making\nyour data available,\nlet's just say,\nand it's anonymized per se,\nyou still might be identifiable.\nIt's like, okay.\nThat raises some interesting questions.\nLike, okay.\nWell then, how might you get around that?\nHow might you put in safeguards\nso that you are the one and only keeper\nof your data, so to speak.\nBrought up all sorts of targeted weaponry,\nSort of bio weapons possibilities\nthat I was interested in.\nAnd then I would ask that person\nwho's clearly like willing\nto step outside of the box\nof whatever he's working on day-to-day,\nwho are two of your close friends\nor two thinkers\nyou really pay a lot of attention to,\nor kind of at the bleeding edge\nof something and unorthodox.\nAnd then I would just continue\nto have these conversations\nover and over again.\nAnd the stream of development\nthat I paid a lot of attention to\nis something along the\nlines of the following.\nSo the very beginnings are usually\nin some type of extreme case.\nAnd I think the extremes,\nand this goes for product design as well,\nbut the extremes inform the mean,\nbut not vice versa.\nSo you can actually learn a lot\nby studying the edge cases.\nSo race horses for instance,\nyou'll often see things start with say,\nraces horses\nor people with wasting\ndiseases for instance,\nor any type of chronic\nor terminal illness who are willing to try\nsome more experimental interventions.\nThen let's just take one step further,\nbodybuilding.\nSee a lot of interesting behavior\nin bodybuilding and high-level athletes,\nthen billionaires, then rich people,\nthen the rest of us, right?\nSo my assumption is,\nand was for the 4-hour body that,\nalong the lines of William Gibson's quote,\nyou know, \"The future is already here,\nit's just not evenly distributed.\"\nSo I'm never predicting the future,\nI'm just finding the seeds\nthat are germinating\nthat I think are going to bloom,\nand end up spreading\nreally, really widely.\nSo that's generally where I start.\nAnd I assume the\npractitioners are going to be\nahead of the papers.\nSo studying, say the coaches whose jobs\nare on the line,\nwho are getting paid\nbased on athlete performance,\nand assuming that a lot\nof that will eventually,\nif it holds up,\nmake its way into say the peer reviewed\nexercise science papers,\nbut it's going to have\na lag time of three to five years.\nAt least?\nAt least.\nYeah.\nAt least.\nIt takes a long time.\nYeah, science is often\nvery slow to catch up.\nYeah.\nYou mentioned many things\nI have questions about.\nYou mentioned paying attention to the new,\nthe very old or the orphaned.\nSo interesting.\nAnd I just thought I'd tell you\nthat when you sit down\nwith a graduate student or a postdoc,\nand they're trying to\ncome up with a project,\nrarely do you say you know, like,\nwhat do you want to work on?\nAnd they fire back like\na really interesting question.\nSometimes they do, but\nthat's the rare person.\nMore often than not,\nyou'll send them to the literature,\nand they'll come back with like,\n\"Okay, there's this new technique\nthat we can use to answer\na set of questions better than ever before\nwhere there's a very old\ntheory I want to revisit,\nor there's this theory\nthat no one pays attention to.\nIn fact, we had one guest on here,\nOded Rechavi who is studying it.\nEssentially inheritance of traits,\ntransgenerational inheritance of traits.\nIt's a little bit,\nalthough different from\nLamarckian evolution,\nbut it's a lot like that in some ways,\nand you know these orphan theories\nthat everyone assumed were wrong,\nand that there is a basis for them.\nSo I think there's real\ngenius in that analysis.\n[Music Playing]"
