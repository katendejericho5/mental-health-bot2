    "transcript": "So one of the pillars of strength training\nis eccentric strength,\nwhich is breaks.\nSo...\nyou're going to hurt yourself\n10 times more likely,\nI'm making that number up by the way,\nI don't know if it's 10 times,\nbut experientially it seems to be.\nYou are 10 times more\nlikely to hurt yourself\nstepping off something then\nstepping onto something, right?\nStepping down versus stepping up.\nBecause when you step up onto something,\nyou are concentrically\ncontrolling a muscle.\nWhen you step down, you\nhave to apply the brakes,\nand that's where most people falter.\nMuch harder to walk downhill than uphill.\nUphill is taxing your\ncardiovascular system,\nbut if you slow down enough, you're fine.\nBut a lot of people don't have the ability\nto slow themselves down when\nthey're walking downhill.\nAnd so, when an older\nperson steps off a curb\nand can't fully stop themselves,\nand that results in a fall.\nSo, I like doing things like a broad jump.\nBroad jump's a fun little\ntest set I like to do\nevery once in a while.\nI always want to make sure\nI can broad jump six feet.\nThat's kind of my arbitrary\nnumber that I've chosen.\nAnd the reason is on the takeoff,\nthat's a very explosive movement.\nBut the landing is just as important.\nIf I can't stick that landing,\nit means I don't have the brakes.\nSo those are kind of some of\nthe tests I want to be able\nto do to make sure that\nI'm utilizing that system.\nBecause I do think, look, I've watched,\nI've watched my mom fell,\n[clears throat] gosh, probably\nbeen about four months ago.\nJust fell in a typical\nway that people fall.\nBy the way, it could\nhave happened to anybody.\nIt's not like my mom walks around\nand moves around just fine.\nBut on this particular day,\nshe just tripped on a\nuneven stone and fell,\nand landed and broke her hand.\nAnd she's really lucky\nshe didn't break her hip.\nAnd I told her that because my mom was\nprobably in her mid seventies,\nand I said, \"look, if that was your femur,\nI'd give you a 30% chance\nof dying in the next year.\"\nI mean, it's just an un,\nthose are such difficult\nto recover from injuries.\nBecause first of all, you're dealing with\nthe immobility of the hospitalization\nand immobility that follows that.\nAnd the amount of muscle loss that occurs\ncould easily be\nfour or five pounds of lean tissue lost\nthat for most people that age\nbecomes almost impossible to get back.\nAnd that says nothing\nabout sort of the acute\ncauses of death, like a\nfat embolism that results\nfrom a broken femur, a blood\nclot from laying in bed.\nThose things are also catastrophic.\nBut what happens is a\nlot of these patients\njust never get back to the\nsame level of mobility.\nAnd now I think, in many ways,\nwe're kind of pivoting from\nwhat kills you to what\nruins your quality of life.\nAnd we've spent so much time\ntalking about what kills you,\nbut I think you might as\nwell be dead in some ways\nif you can't do the things you want to do.\nAnd if playing with your\ngrandkids, or gardening,\nor playing golf, or going\nfor a walk with your spouse,\nor think of any of the\nthings that we all do today\nand take for granted,\nif you can't do those\nthings, I don't know.\nYou sort of lose the reason to be around.\nAnd, oftentimes, the\ninability to do those things\nis associated with pain.\nPETER: Mm hm.\nThat which is psychologically\nand obviously physiologically\nso distressing.\nYou mentioned the four pillars of health.\nMaybe just list those off for people.\nOf lifting?\nOh, well, the four pillars of\nlongevity through physical...\nOh, yeah, yeah.\nSo, sort of the exercise pieces of them.\nYes.\nYeah, so strength, stability,\naerobic efficiency,\nand aerobic peak output.\nOkay, so aerobic peak would be\nlike V max?\nSo V O two max.\nYup, mm hm.\nIn zone two.\nThat's, in my analogy, that's\nthe V your zone two is the,\nis how wide the base of your pyramid is,\nand your V O two max is how tall\nthe peak of the pyramid is.\nANDREW: Oh, I like that.\nSo the best pyramid has a\nwide base and a high peak.\nSo you could have a reasonably\nwide base and a shallow peak.\nIf you just did zone two training,\nyou're going to get a reasonable peak,\nbut it's not going to be that high.\nYou have to do some of\nthat specific training.\nIf you just focus on high\nintensity, you might drive up\nthat V O two max, but you're actually\ngoing to have a relatively\nwide, a narrow aerobic base.\nSo you think about just\nmaximizing the area of\nthat triangle, widest, tallest.\nStability and strength.\nStability, of course,\nencompasses everything we're\ntalking about in terms of reactivity.\nI dedicate a chapter in the book\nto this concept because it\nis so foreign to most people\nand for understandable reasons.\nIt's just, it's not sexy, it's not,\nit's the hardest one to train.\nIt's the hardest one to understand.\nBut it's so important\nbecause it's the thing\nthat I think differentiates\npeople who age well\nand people who don't age well.\nAnd I should, perhaps, throw in there,\nplease correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut also most of the machines that are in\ntypical commercial gyms that allow people\nwho are not very experienced\nto start doing some resistance training,\ndon't really tap into the\nstability factor terribly much.\nSo while there's value to\nleg extensions and leg curls\nand chest presses and shoulder\npresses done with machines,\ncertainly, for a number\nof reasons and can often\nbe safer than free weights,\nespecially for people who\nare approaching it a later\ntime or new to the whole thing,\nthey don't really lend themselves\nto real life stability.\nWalking down, as you\nmentioned, walking down stairs\nthat in the absence of a handrail.\nRight.\nOr movements in kind of odd planes,\nhaving to step aside to avoid a bicycle.\nPETER: Right.\nAt an angle as opposed\nto just moving linearly.\nYeah, and by the way, a lot\nof things that don't involve\nmachines still don't give you that, right?\nLike, I mean, doing a\ndeadlift, you have to be stable\nto lift a heavy weight like a,\nyou would a deadlift\nwithout hurting yourself.\nThat requires an unbelievable capacity\nto harness intraabdominal\npressure and to be connected.\nEspecially if you're giving\nlift 500 pounds off the ground,\nyou're stable, but that\nstill doesn't prepare you\nfor what you just described.\nSo, stability is multifaceted\nand it involves doing a lot of things.\nToday, for example, I\nfinished my, today was a\ncardio zone two day, so\nI did my cardio zone two\nand...\nI had an extra 10 minutes\nbefore I needed to kind of get moving.\nAnd so all I did was\nstep ups for 10 minutes.\nI just did single leg,\nvery slow\nstep up\nand insanely slow step\ndowns off a box in a gym.\nSo two second up, four\nsecond down, two second up,\nfour second down with,\nand I would do them with\nipsilateral loads, contralateral loads,\nall sorts of different things.\nAnd basically, that's just\na stability game for me.\nIt's like I'm building\nthat concentric strength\nin a movement where it's easy to cheat,\nbut can I do it without cheating?\nThat's terrific and it's terrific that you\ncover all of that in the book.\n[Music Playing]"
