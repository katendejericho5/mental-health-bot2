    "transcript": "When I was in medical school,\nand I think I even write\nabout this in the book,\nwe had a pathology lecture\nwhere the professor stands up there\nand he says, \"What is the\nmost common presentation\n\"of a heart attack,\"\nand you know, us keener,\nfirst year med students\nhands shoot straight up,\nChest pain.\nNo, that's not the most common.\nOh, shoulder pain radiating\ndown the left arm.\nNo.\nNausea, shortness of breath.\nNo, no, no.\nWe rattled this off for a few\nminutes and he goes, \"death.\"\nThe single most common presentation\nfor a myocardial infarction is death.\nNow, I would say today,\nthat was 25 years ago.\nToday it's probably not the most common\nbecause advanced cardiac life\nsupport is so much better.\nBut it's still strikingly common.\nWell, you could say\nthat the best predictor\nof a heart attack is still a heart attack.\nThis is just one of those things where\nwe're going to spend a lot\nof time talking about things\nthat feel good and feel bad\nwhen you change them, right?\nLike if you take a person\nwho's not sleeping well,\nbut who thinks they're sleeping well\nand you ask them for a\nleap of faith, which is,\nhey, gimme a month to help\nyou sleep really well,\nyeah, you're going to feel better.\nYou might not know it now\nbecause you don't know\nhow bad you're sleeping.\nNow you've become acclimated to this.\nBut this is not one of those\ndomains, you know, exercise,\nnutrition, sleep, all those things.\nWhen you do those things\nbetter, you feel better.\nBut you know, I don't want\nto overpromise on this.\nYou're not going to feel\nbetter in the moment\nwhen you fix your lipids,\nbut you'll feel better\nwhen you don't have a heart attack.\nSo by all this logic,\neverybody should get their ApoB measured.\nHow early in life should people do that?\nStarting in their twenties,\nin their thirties?\nCertainly if you have a family history\nthat is of any concern,\nlike if I could live my life over again,\nif I knew everything you\nknow, then that I know today,\nyeah, I would've had mine\nmeasured in my twenties.\nYou know, I didn't get my ApoB measured\nfor the first time, probably\ntill I was in my forties\nbecause, you know, well\nyeah, maybe late thirties,\nearly forties, right?\nI had my first calcium scan when I was 35\nand I had to beg, borrow,\nsteal to get it done\n'cause everyone was like\nwhy does a 35 year old want to do this?\nBut I just felt something was wrong\ngiven my family history.\nAnd I'm glad I did.\nI'm glad I did that\n'cause I learned something\nthat completely changed\nthe direction of my life.\nOkay, I know my ApoB numbers\nand that I might be that guy\nwho's up in the you know,\nabove 100 so I'm going\nto get this treated.\nThat's a promise to myself.\nWe covered the three major risk factors,\nwhich were blood pressure,\nkeeping that in check,\ndon't smoke, and ApoB.\nAnd we've now talked about the\nthings to adjust ApoB levels.\nWe did not really talk about things\nto adjust blood pressure.\nI'm assuming exercise sits\nas one of the foremost -\nExercise, nutrition.\nYeah, weight management\nis a huge one here.\nSo you know, you take a person whose\nand this is one of those things\nwhere we don't immediately\njump on the pharmacotherapy\ntrain with blood pressure\nbecause here there are\nside effects sometimes,\nand you do have to worry\nabout overshooting.\nYou don't really have to\nworry about overshooting\na person's lipids.\nWe do back off if we overshoot,\nbut it doesn't cause a symptom.\nThere's not a short-term\nimmediate risk from doing that.\nIf you overshoot somebody's\nblood pressure medication,\nyou trade one problem for another problem.\nThey become lightheaded when\nthey get up to pee at night,\nthey fall and bang their head.\nThat's a devastating consequence.\nTotally unacceptable.\nSo our goal is to see how much\nwe can lower blood pressure\nwithout medication before\nwe turn to medication.\nAnd let's be clear, the meds\ntoday are so much better\nthan they used to be.\nAgain, there was a day\nwhen the side effects\nof these medicines were miserable.\nThat's simply not the case today.\nI mean ace inhibitors,\nangiotensin receptor blockers,\nI mean, these things\nare very well tolerated,\nespecially the ARBs.\nSo again, almost anybody\ncan be on these things,\nbut if we could get a\nperson to lose 10 pounds\nand exercise every day,\nwe see great effects\nwith zone 2 stuff, right?\nSo kind of the low intensity cardio.\nAnd your recommendation there,\nI know you talk about this in the book but\nI've thrown out numbers about\n150 to 180 minutes per week.\nYou go a bit higher.\nYeah, we go 180 to 250, 240.\nYeah, I'd like to see three to\nfour hours a week of zone 2.\nSo that's an important piece.\nAnd sleep is an important piece.\nSo get the sleep right,\nget the exercise right.\nIf you're over nourished,\nlet's correct that problem.\nAnd if all of that doesn't work,\nand by the way that\nworks a lot of the time.\nThat works most of the time.\nIf that doesn't work, then\nwe've got pharmacotherapy.\nThere is still a true phenomenon\nof essential hypertension,\nwhich is in individuals for whom\nall the fixable stuff has been fixed\nand they still have high blood pressure,\nwe still have to medicate those folks.\nBy the way, there's something\nthat I want to mention here\nthat doesn't get much attention\nbut it's so important,\nwhich is the effect of high\nblood pressure on the kidney\nand also the brain itself.\nWe've talked about the brain,\nwe've talked about the heart,\nbut the kidney doesn't\nget enough attention.\nThe kidney is a remarkable organ.\nAnd I think if you're really in this game\nof trying to live longer, right?\nIf you think, hey, you know,\nmaybe we'll live 80, 85 years,\nbut if we kind of start doing\nall of these other things\nand really optimizing our\nbehaviors, that could be 95.\nWell, you have to start thinking about\nthe capacity of the kidney.\nAnd once the glomerular filtration rate\nfalls below a certain level,\nyou have to be very careful\nwith how you live your life.\nAnd unfortunately, this\nis one of those things\nthat is another sort\nof mistake that's made\nin kind of modern medicine,\nwhich is we don't pay enough attention\nto how to measure kidney\nfunction correctly.\nWe rely very heavily on\nsomething called creatinine\nas opposed to looking at another\nbiomarker called Cystatin C\nwhich is far more accurate.\nAnd we also tolerate too low\nof a kidney function for a person's age.\nSo we look at, you know, we\nmight look at someone who's 50,\nwho's kidney function is at 65%\nand say, you're totally fine.\nBecause it's true that at\n65% there is no problem.\nBut you're not thinking, well,\nif this person has to live\nanother 40 years and this\ncontinues to go down,\nthey're going to potentially\nbe staring down the barrel\nof needing dialysis the last\nfive years of their life.\nAgain, you want to die with\ncompromised kidney function,\nbut never from compromised\nkidney function.\nIn fact, the hazard ratio\nof all cause mortality\nassociated with\ncompromised kidney function\nis even greater than\nthat of heart disease.\nOnce you cross that\nthreshold, I mean lights out.\nonce you are needing dialysis, I mean,\nyour risk of death is\nhigher than that of someone\nwith high blood pressure, smoking.\nEven someone who has cancer,\nyou have a higher risk of death\nhaving end stage renal disease\nthan you do having cancer.\nSo the kidney is so\nsensitive to blood pressure.\nThis is a tiny organ that\non every pump of your heart\nis getting 20% to 25% of your blood.\nWow.\nSo just imagine how sensitive\nand susceptible it is to\nelevated blood pressure.\n[Music Playing]"
