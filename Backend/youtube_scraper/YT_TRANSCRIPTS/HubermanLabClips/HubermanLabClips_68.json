    "transcript": "Since sometimes your\nrecommendations deviate from\nthe standards that one would find online\nor in the typical doctor's office,\nat what point do you get concerned?\nWell, I actually find myself quite in line\nwith the most recent available\ndata on blood pressure.\nAnd this has been, obviously\nit's a topic that's\nof high concern to any doctor\nwho's taking care of patients\nwho even pays a fraction of attention\nto the available literature.\nWhich is that basically\nwith each subsequent blood pressure trial,\nthe data are becoming clearer and clearer\nthat the more aggressively\nyou manage blood pressure\nto be within the 120 over\n80 range, the better.\nSo there's a recent study\nthat even looked at going from what used\nto be considered acceptable,\nwhich was 130 to 135 over 80 to 85.\nWe used to basically say,\nthat's kind of the first\nlevel of hypertension.\nAnd we would say, well,\ndo you really need to be better than that?\nAnd the answer turns\nout to be, yes, you do.\nIf you want to reduce heart attacks\nand strokes, it's better to be\n120 over 80 than 135 over 85.\nNow, this is a whole other rabbit hole\nthat we don't need to go down,\nbut it's a total obsession of mine,\nwhich is how do you measure\na person's blood pressure?\nI think this is potentially,\nI'd have to give it thought,\nbut honestly I could say\ntop three underdiagnosed\nfixable problems in the\nUnited States today,\nand probably globally.\nIn other words, there are too\nmany people walking around\nwith high blood pressure\nwho don't know it.\nAnd I think part of the\nproblem is it's something\nthat is mostly done in\nthe doctor's office,\nand the readings that you\nget in the doctor's office\ncan be often misleading.\nYou've heard of this phenomenon\nof white coat hypertension.\nSo you go to the doctor, your\nblood pressure is virtually\nnever measured correctly\nin the doctor's office.\nThat cuff they put on, and that.\nPETER: Yeah.\nThat little squeeze bulb,\nthat's not accurate.\nYeah, if you look at the\nrigor with which you need\nto measure a person's blood pressure,\nthe right way to do it is\nthe person has to be sitting\nlike this for five minutes doing nothing.\nOkay, folks, so when you\ngo to the doctors now,\nyou don't let them take\nyour blood pressure.\nDon't let them take your blood\npressure out of the gate.\nUntil you've been\nsitting for five minutes.\nAnd that doesn't include\nin the waiting room\nbecause if you walk from the waiting room.\nRight, because then you\nget up and walk over.\nRight.\nOkay, so make them stand there.\nRight.\nSo you want to be sitting there like this.\nA manual cuff is better\nthan an automated cuff,\nbut not enough people use\nmanual blood pressure.\nSo a manual blood pressure\nmeans they put a cuff on you\nand they actually put a\nstethoscope on the brachial artery\nand they're using the human ear to listen,\nwhich believe it or not,\nyou would think a machine\nis better, but it's not.\nThe machine can be misled\nby different sounds.\nNow, I don't want to suggest\nthat automated cuffs are\nuseless, they're not.\nBut when an automated\ncuff gives you an answer\nthat is potentially suspect,\nalways back it up with a manual.\nI'm pretty relentless about\nchecking my blood pressure.\nAnd so I'll do side to side\nmanual versus automated every day.\nAnd there's easily a 10 to 15\npoint difference between them.\nMaybe this is a silly question,\nbut can people check\ntheir own blood pressure?\nMeaning manually?\nYeah, just could I get a cuff and a bulb\nand learn how to do it?\nYeah, I think so.\nI mean, I can do it,\nbut honestly, I usually\nhave my wife do it.\nShe's a nurse.\nBut it's not rocket science\nto check blood pressure.\nI guarantee you there's\na great video on YouTube\nthat explains the physiology of it.\nAnd if you're willing to\nsplurge on a good enough\nstethoscope and cuff,\nlike the cuff I have\nis really easy to use.\nOnce you put it on,\nit's in a single thing.\nI'm squeezing the bulb and\nlooking at the pressure gauge\nwhile I've got the\nstethoscope on my artery.\nI mean, given the\nimportance of blood pressure\nand this arteriosclerosis\nbeing at the top of the list\nof risks for dying,\nit seems to me it might\nbe worth the expense.\nWhat's a typical range\nof costs for the quality?\nI don't, it's not inordinate.\nI feel like my blood\npressure cuff is 40 bucks\nand the stethoscope is\na couple hundred bucks\nif you're getting a good one.\nAnd a good automated cuff,\nI have no affiliation with\nany of these companies.\nI use two automated cuffs,\none's called Withings,\nand the other one's made\nby a company called Omron,\nO-M-R-O-N.\nAnd they're both decent, but\nagain, they tend to run high.\nAnd I have yet to find\na credible explanation\nfrom cardiologists as to\nwhy everybody acknowledges\nthat the manual one when\ndone correctly is the answer.\nBut I've heard wonky answers about why\nautomated ones are sometimes incorrect.\nAnd again, it's just made me\nrealize we're not checking\nblood pressure often enough on people.\nWe're overly relying on blood pressures\nin the doctor's office, which\nare not being done correctly.\nSo we basically have our\npatients do this relentlessly.\nSo how often, let's say someone buys this.\n'Cause I think for $240, I mean,\nI realize that's\nprohibitive for some people,\nbut given the cost of\nsome of the other things\nthat are discussed on this\nand many other podcasts.\nFirst of all, I would\njust have people start\nwith an automated cuff to begin with.\nOkay.\nAnd just start with there.\nWe generally have people\ndo it for two weeks.\nWe give our patients a little spreadsheet\nthat automatically calculates averages\nand stuff like that, tells\nthem what to record and where.\nAnd we just say, look,\nfor two weeks we want to\nsee two recordings a day.\nAnd do a morning and an\nafternoon/PM recording\ntwice a day for two weeks\nand let us see those numbers\nand we'll scrutinize them further.\nAnd if those numbers come in\nfine, let's revisit in a year.\nWill a day ever come when a watch\nor a wristband can do this really well?\nSo I hope so, and I'm investigating it.\nI'm actually going to be\ntrying one out in a couple\nof weeks with a company\nthat I tried two years ago.\nTwo years ago when I tried\nit, I was not impressed.\nSo I kind of punted on it.\nThe company, which I guess\nI'll not share the name\nof the company just yet,\nbut they claim that it's\nsignificantly better.\nSo I'm going to put it to the test again,\nand it's basically a continuous monitor.\nSo it's a wrist device\nthat about every 15 minutes\nthroughout the course\nof the day will check your blood pressure.\nTo me, this would be, honestly,\nprobably more important.\nYou know how much emphasis I place on CGM\nas a great thing to be able to test.\nContinuous glucose monitoring.\nRight.\nI would argue this\nwould be more important.\nWhen the day comes that\nwe can continuously\nassess people's blood pressure,\nit would be an integral part of a person's\nhealth checkup once a year is do two weeks\nof continuous blood pressure monitoring.\nRight now to do that,\nwhich I've done as well,\nis so cumbersome that\nit borders on absurd.\nYou actually have to wear\na blood pressure cuff\nthat is attached to a\nclumsy device that goes\nthrough the whole insufflation\nexercise every 15 minutes,\nincluding while you're sleeping.\nIt provides some insight,\nbut it's so disruptive that\nit's not what we really want.\nThe dream would be like a\npatch that you could put,\nI don't know, over your chest\nthat can somehow impute\nchanges in blood flow\nor something like that and regulate.\nBut we'll see.\nBetween optical sensors\nand things like that,\nI hope that we're getting\ncloser to having something.\n[Music Playing]"
