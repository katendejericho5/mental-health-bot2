    "transcript": "What is the relationship\nbetween stress and eating\nand eating and the opioid system?\nStress and eating is an interesting one.\nSo most people, when they feel stressed...\nOr, I'm just going to\nask you, do you eat more\nor less when you're stressed?\nLess, definitely.\nI feel like I can go two,\nthree days without food\nwhen I'm really stressed.\nBut I came up in a profession\nwhere, sadly for me,\nall-nighters were part of the\nregular until pretty recently,\na couple years ago when I\njust called an end to that.\nAnd no, it wasn't just\nbecause of procrastination,\nit was just work overload.\nYep.\nBut I can go a long period\nof time without eating,\nalthough I love to eat,\nso I do point out that I do love to eat.\nAnd what does the body feel like\nwhen you're in that stress state\nwhen you're not even hungry,\nyou're kind of shut\ndown in your digestion?\nThat I have enough energy\nfrom my neural resources,\nfrom adrenaline.\nAnd generally, those periods of time\nwhen I'm not hungry\ncoincide with a hyperfocus\non the stressor, the deadline,\nwhatever it is in life\nthat needs tending to,\nand food just doesn't\nappeal to me as much.\nIt doesn't taste as good\nand it's not as enticing.\nYeah.\nSo we think that either your type\nof body temperament is high sympathetic,\nand so when you have\na big stress response,\nyour digestion is pretty much shut down.\nLike it would be the opposite.\nEating would be the opposite\nof what your body's telling you to do.\nI'm just going to...\nForgive me for interrupting.\nFor those of you hearing sympathetic,\nwe're not talking about sympathy.\nWe're talking about the sympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nwhich is the so-called\nfight or flight arm,\nas opposed to the parasympathetic.\nIn any event, sorry to interrupt,\nbut want to make sure that...\nSometimes people hear sympathy\nand then think emotional sympathy.\nI like to think I have that too, but...\nOkay, so I tend to lean more\ntowards the sympathetic,\nmeaning more alertness arousal...\nELISSA: Yeah.\non the seesaw of the\nautonomic nervous system.\nRight. And I'm a high sympathetic reactor.\nI lose weight when I go through...\nLike writing my dissertation,\nI looked like a skeleton at the end.\nBut that's not what most\npeople complain about.\nIt's not weight loss.\nMost people complain about\novereating or binge-eating\nwhen they're emotional,\nwhen they're stressed.\nAnd so that's the more common pattern.\nAnd that looks different,\nboth in the brain and biologically.\nAnd so what it looks like\nis that the stress response\nis driving cravings and\nalso, let's say, high insulin\nor an insulin-resistance state.\nAnd what goes along with that is tending\nto be overweight or have obesity.\nAnd so, whether it's through\nconditioning or genetics,\nhaving that kind of larger body\nwith a big stress-eating temperament,\nthat is a challenge in life.\nAnd I've worked with people\nwith different eating conditions,\neating disorders, binge-eating,\nand what's hard about it is,\nnumber one, it's very common and normative\nto just feel like you can't feel satiated.\nSo it's this compulsive eating tendency\nthat stress brings you to.\nAnd so what it mean...\nWe measure this, it's\nvery easy to measure.\nIt means that people feel\nlike they can't control their eating,\nthey don't get full, they\nthink about food a lot.\nAnd so stress kind of\nexacerbates that tendency.\nAnd that is a...\nIt's a common phenotype.\nLike we've studied it,\nand maybe 50% of people\nwith obesity have that.\nDo lean people have that?\nSome, not many, like less than 20%.\nBut what they also have is this tremendous\nkind of what we call dietary strain\nor control over their eating.\nSo they're able to not overeat\neven though they're\nthinking about food a lot.\nSo that explains that unusual body\nof someone who's really more...\nStill has those compulsive traits.\nSo why does this matter?\nThis makes it really hard to eat well,\nbecause when you're\nstressed, you're craving\nthe comfort food, the high\nfat, high sugar, high salt,\ndepending on your temperament.\nAnd that means, with\nrepeated bouts of stress,\nyou're just going to be gaining weight,\nand particularly in the\nintraabdominal area.\nThat's what we've seen. We've\nseen it cross-sectionally.\nWe've seen it in rat\nstudies and mice studies,\nand now we've seen it in people in many...\nFor about 10 years I studied this\nand the question was, is\nwhat's happening in people\nthe same thing that's happening in mice?\nIf you stress them out\nand you give them Oreos,\nthe mice develop binge-eating,\nthey get really compulsive,\nand they get this terrible\nmetabolic health profile,\nmetabolic syndrome, where they're round...\nTheir belly fat basically\nexpands like a cushion.\nAnd that's 'cause that's this really good\nimmediate source of energy during stress.\nSo we're really well wired to...\nIf our body thinks we're\nunder chronic stress,\nwe're going to store stress\nfat or abdominal fat,\nso that we can just\nmobilize that in a second.\nAnd then the second\nquestion we've asked is,\ncan you reverse that, with\ndifferent interventions,\ncan you block the compulsive eating?\nSo I can tell you what we found there.\nBut the opioid system that you mentioned\nis certainly involved, and\nin studies with people,\nlean people and people with obesity,\nmy colleague Rajita Sinha at\nYale, it's basically found\nthat when you stress them out,\npeople with obesity are having\na different reward response.\nAnd the more insulin-resistant they are,\nthe more their reward center\nlights up during stress.\nAnd what's causal there?\nWhat's the chicken, what's the egg?\n'Cause I can imagine these were people\nthat at one time were not\nobese who got stressed.\nThe opioid system reacted\nin a particularly potent way\nto food, and they were\nable to clamp their stress.\nAnd so then they become\nbinge-eaters in the context stress.\nYeah.\nAnd that leads to insulin insensitivity.\nExactly.\nI could also imagine that\nthey were insulin-insensitive,\ntherefore they need to\neat more in order to feel\nkind of an increase in satiety.\n'Cause we know this now, based\non brain and body mechanisms.\nAnd then that set off a cascade\nof things leading to obesity.\nNot that it necessarily\nmatters, but what's causal?\nDo we know if...\nOh, I think it really does matter.\nI think there's been a\nmistake of kind of confounding\nall obesity with food addiction\nand metabolic disease.\nAnd it's completely heterogeneous.\nSo I think it's the developmental path\nthat you're describing, which\nis that there's a tendency\ntoward having a bigger reward response\nand hunger during stress.\nSo it becomes a way of\ncoping, a lifestyle,\nand that is a pathway toward obesity.\nAnd so some obese people have\na dysregulated stress\nresponse, but not all of them.\nI mean, it really is a\ncertain type of person,\nso that's why we target\npeople with cravings.\nIn all of our intervention studies now,\nwe want to know who has more\nof the compulsive eating type\nbecause they need a different\nset of skills to cope\nwith stress and to lose\nweight, if that's their goal.\nThere's a drug, I'm sure you're\nfamiliar with naltrexone,\nwhich can block the opioid receptor.\nIt's used to block the opioid receptor\nin the context of different\ntypes of addiction.\nHave people tried to use naltrexone\nin the context of binge-eating?\nAnd does it help people lose weight?\nBecause it presumably reduces\nsome of the rewarding properties of food.\nThat's one of the very\nfew drug combinations\nthat has been used for binge-eating.\nSo it was a combination of\nnaltrexone and Wellbutrin.\nAnd I'm not sure at this\nmoment how much that's favored\nfor binge-eating, but certainly\nthe early trials showed\nthat it really does damp down\non the compulsive eating.\nInteresting.\nSo is that a commonly\nprescribed kit of drugs now\nfor obesity?\nI know there's a lot\nof excitement nowadays\nabout these semaglutide...\nYeah.\nanalogs, because they\ndo seem very effective\nin blocking hunger, especially\nin type-two diabetics.\nI don't know if you're familiar with it.\nBut, right, they're sort of all the rage,\nmostly because people saw\nthe before and after photos\nof Elon.\nHe had his shirt off on a boat\nand there were some not so\nnice comments made about him.\nAnd then sometime later\nhe was quite a bit lighter\nand he announced that he had been taking\none of these semaglutide agonists.\nELISSA: Yeah.\nYeah.\nI really hope that we come up with safe\nand effective drugs.\nAnd one thing to think\nabout is that the challenge\nthat we all have, particularly\nif we're prone to obesity,\nis the toxic food environment,\nand particularly the refined sugar.\nAnd regardless of what we're on,\nmetformin or one of these drugs,\nwe override it with our diet.\nAnd really, the improved\nnutrition is the only way\nto solve it as a public health problem.\nI mean, the drug companies are saying\neveryone with a certain BMI should be\non one of these new drugs,\nand it's just rubbish\nand it's not going to\nlead to long-term health.\nWell, I know you have a\ncolleague there at UCSF,\nDr. Robert Lustig, who's\nbeen talking about sugars\nand hidden sugars for years\nand the problems with that.\nAnd we don't want to demonize\nsugar as the only cause\nof the obesity epidemic, but\nit's certainly one of them.\nAt least that's my belief,\naccording to the data.\nYes, and Rob is the biggest\nproponent of helping people\nunderstand the big problem and the root\nis in the processed food and the sugar,\nand that the drugs don't touch that.\nWe override effects of\nany drugs with our diet.\nAnd so it's been a losing battle really,\nbecause of the force of\nbig food and big pharma.\nSo let me go back to\nthe compulsive eating.\nSo there are some clues about\nhow to break that cycle.\nSo one is, in our weight loss trials\nor healthy mindful eating trials,\nwe find that mindful eating\nis not going to cause\na lot of weight loss, period.\nBut the people who benefit\nmost from learning this kind\nof calm self-regulation where\nyou check in with your hunger,\nyou slow down, you increase\nyour awareness of your body,\nso in interceptive\nawareness, that type of skill\nis really critical for people\nwith compulsive eating.\nAnd so in our trials we find that if they,\npeople with compulsive\neating, if they get randomized\nto the mindful eating,\nthey do better in terms\nof their insulin-resistance\nand their glucose\nand their long-term weight loss.\nSo that's one good clue.\nAnother is the positive\nstress pathway looks important\nfor breaking the compulsive eating cycle.\nSo high-intensity interval training,\nor maybe some of these other ways\nthat we've been talking about,\nto increase the bodily stress\nin these short-term ways\nto metabolize stress in our\nbody can help with the cravings.\nSo what would that look\nlike in the context of...\nLet's say somebody has the\nopposite phenotype to me,\nthey get stressed and they\nfind themselves reaching\nfor snack food or that they\nsimply can't reach satiety.\nThey just want to eat and eat and eat.\nWhat are some of the, aside\nfrom naltrexone and Wellbutrin\nand some of these\nprescription approaches...\nBecause I always say\nwhile I certainly value\nprescription drugs in certain contexts.\nI always feel like\nbehaviors should come first,\ndo's and don'ts, then\nnutrition, then supplementation,\nand then, if and only\nif it's still needed,\nprescription drugs.\nBut that's just my bias\nbased on my observation.\nPretty reasonable. [laughs]\nI like to think so.\nIt also starts at a zero cost endeavor.\nI mean, behaviors require time,\nbut it certainly includes everybody,\nnot just those that have\ninsurance or that live\nin a particular region\nof the US or the world.\nSo anyway, that's my bias,\nand at least for the time\nbeing, I'm sticking with it.\nIt's the basis of a lot\nof what we talk about\non this podcast.\nBut nonetheless, if somebody\nis finding themselves\nin that category of binge-eating\nor heading towards binge-eating\nor using food to comfort\nor alleviate stress,\nhow should they intervene\nin their own thoughts and behavior?\nWe talked about the binge,\ntop down strategies,\nchanging the body, changing the scene.\nWe need all of those.\nI mean, the compulsive drive to eat\nis one of our strongest impulses\nif we've developed that pathway.\nAnd so we train people, for\nexample, in mindful awareness\nof separating out emotions from hunger.\nSo they get really wrapped up together,\nso just labeling how you're feeling,\nlabeling your hunger from one to 10\nand figuring out, \"Am I really\nhungry or is it boredom?\"\nThat helps people.\nAnd if you do that check-in\nright before you eat,\nthat helps the most.\nSo that's the top down mindful check-in.\nThe other thing we help people do\nis ride the craving, surf the urge.\nSo we deal a lot with soda\ndrinkers, and it is addictive,\nand there is nothing worse\nthan drinking sugar soda for our body.\nSo we help people by having\nthem watch their craving pass\nand knowing that it's a matter of time\nthat they can surf the urge\nwithout jumping to consuming.\nAnd so that practice helps some people,\nespecially with practice.\nThe pushups, the taking a\nwalk, the changing the scene,\ngetting away from food\nis always going to be\na huge strong strategy if you\ncan get yourself away from it.\nThe problem is, as you know,\nis that the cravings get you\nto the buffet, they drive\nyou to the soda, et cetera.\nAnd so just creating safe environments,\nboth at home and in the workplace,\nwhere you don't have\nsoda is really important.\nSo we try that at UCSF.\nMy colleagues and I, including Rob Lustig,\nthe anti-sugar doctor,\nwe just saw the absurdity\nof being a medical center,\npeople come with these chronic diseases,\nand what are they served in the cafeteria\nor even at their bedside?\nSugared coke.\nIn the hospital.\nIn the hospital.\nYeah.\nAnd so my colleague Laura Schmidt,\nwho's partly responsible for the soda tax,\nshe rallied all the...\nWe went top down to administration,\nbut bottom up to vendors,\ngot rid of all the soda\nin all of our hospitals and campuses.\nAnd we found two things.\nNumber one, people who were heavy drinkers\nlost weight in the most\nimportant place, their waist.\nHeavy soda drinkers?\nSo when we took it out of the workplace,\nactually their health improved.\nAnd number two, those\nwith compulsive eating,\nthey score high on our little\nscale for reward-based drive,\nit didn't help them.\nSo then we randomized half of\nthem to get some extra boost,\nwe call it motivational interviewing,\nwhere we're really supporting\nthem more and helping them\nthink of goals, like being\nwith their grandchildren\nand not getting diabetes.\nAnd that little bit of support\nhelped them tremendously.\nAnd so now we are trying to roll that out\nin a big controlled trial.\nBut at least a hundred\nhospitals have adopted the...\nStopped selling sugary drinks.\nBecause people don't want to be sick,\nbut they can't help it if\nthey have the reward drive.\nAnd if they have the compulsivity\nand it's right there at work,\nwe're just working against health.\n[Music Playing]"
