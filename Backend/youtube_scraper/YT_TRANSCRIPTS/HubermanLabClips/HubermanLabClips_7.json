    "transcript": "What about rewarding kids?\nAnd here, rather than start off by asking,\n\"What are the best ways to\nreward kids in healthy ways?\"\nand I will ask that in a moment,\nhow can we evaluate the notion of rewards\nor incentives through\nthis lens of sturdiness,\nboundaries, and empathy?\nYeah.\nBecause I could imagine,\na reward that's outsized in\ncomparison to what a kid did.\nOkay, great.\nYou took your plate to the\nkitchen sink after dinner.\nNow you get $10,000,\nobviously out of scale, extreme example,\nbut just by way of example,\nyou going to screw up their\nreward mechanisms for life,\nif you ask me.\nEverything I know about reward\nand neuroplasticity says\nthat that would occur.\nBut this idea that you incentivize kids.\nIf you turn off the TV now,\nthen you definitely can\nwatch tomorrow night.\nWhereas if you don't, you can't, right?\nSo you're sort of merging\nreward and potential punishment.\nUh-huh.\nHow do we bound rewards?\nAnd how do we take into account\nthat when we start adding\nrewards to scenarios\nthat we're mixing and matching\nlife experience for them, you know?\nOkay, so now doing what I'm told,\ndo I always expect a reward?\nIf the reward doesn't come next time,\nwe know based on reward prediction error,\nwe tend to be worse off emotionally\nthan had we never received a reward-\nYup.\nIn the first place.\nAgain, pretty vast parameter space,\nbut what are your thoughts\non best ways to reward kids\nfor standard good behavior-\nYeah.\nVersus achievement versus\nelimination of bad behavior.\nYep.\nMaybe. So three categories.\nSo I think you're asking\na much bigger question,\nor I'm going to, I think you are.\nWhich is like,\nwhy do parents think\nwe need to reward kids?\nI think that's, why do we\nthink we need to punish kids?\nAnd this is actually where\neverything I work on started from\nbecause the way I was\ntrained to work with parents,\nI went to the best gold\nstandard, evidence-based program,\nand it was all about timeouts\nand punishments and rewards\nand stickers and ignoring and praise.\nAnd honestly, during the training\nfor the years after I kind\nof practiced this way,\nI feel like that,\nyou know this better than I am\nso I shouldn't even say this,\nbut like that left part of my brain,\nlike logic and linearity.\nI was just like, \"This is amazing.\nOh my goodness, we're going to\nget more of the good behavior\nand we're going to not\nget the bad behavior.\"\nAnd I'd start teaching this to parents\nin my private practice.\nAnd there was this little thing in me.\nI don't even know, I was like,\n\"I dunno about this. I don't know.\"\nAnd I get louder and louder\nto the point that in a\nsession I literally said\nto a parent in front of me,\nI was just like telling\nthem how to do a timeout.\nAnd I said, \"I'm sorry,\nI don't believe anything\nI've been telling you.\"\nThat's literally what I said.\n'Cause it was so loud.\nAnd it was obviously super\nawkward, but it led me to,\nI feel like from this\nfirst principle's way,\nbe like, there are a million\nassumptions that we have\nabout raising kids, and I\nthink about relationships.\nAnd if I just stripped them\nback, what would I be left with\nand what would be a new\nbuilding from there?\nAnd rewards and like punishments to me\nare these assumptions that\nwe have somehow converted\nfrom like the fiction shelf\nof the library in my mind\nto like the nonfiction\nshelf as like truths.\nAnd I kind of rail against all of them.\nSo I think the question,\nif that's okay to go in that direction,\nto me is like, why do we\nthink we need to reward kids?\nAnd is there actually a better system,\nboth short term and long term.\nI'm incredibly long-term greedy\nin my parenting approach.\n'Cause at the end of the day,\n18 and up is where things really matter.\nNot really matter, I mean they all matter.\nBut I'd rather,\nI want to help my kids become\nsturdy, resilient adults.\nBut I'm short-term greedy\ntoo 'cause I'm a realist.\nLike I just can't deal\nwith like all these difficult moments.\nYou get both, for sure,\nwithout rewards and punishment.\nSo I don't know,\nwhat might someone tell\nme they give a reward for?\nDo you want to use the like\nclearing the table example?\nLet's start that there.\nIt kind of goes back\nto like believing kids are\ninherently good inside.\nI really think it goes back to that.\nIf you really believe kids\nare inherently good inside,\nwhich by the way, when I\nstrip back every assumption,\nthe only thing I was\nleft was that, literally,\nthe only thing.\nAnd then I started to think,\n\"Okay, so if they're good inside,\nwhy do they do so many annoying\nthings like all the time?\"\nBut that gave me a gap.\nAnd I feel like that is\nvery exciting to have a gap.\nLike why do people who are good inside\ndo such bad things, right, adults or kids.\nAnd to me, right, kids are\nborn with all the feelings\nand none of the skills to\nmanage those feelings, period.\nAnd we've often thought,\ntherefore, when feelings,\nfeelings without skills\ncome out in behaviors.\nI think that's what bad behaviors are.\nFeelings or urges or something\nwithout a skill to manage them\nor without access to the\nskill maybe in that moment,\neither way.\nAnd then we end up punishing behavior.\nBut the behavior was just a\nsign of the lack of skill.\nSo I can't imagine anyone\nthinking I could teach my kid to swim\nby punishing them for not swimming.\nLike I think someone\nwould say that was crazy.\nBut that's kind of how we raise kids.\nAnd then we think rewarding\nthem is going to be effective,\nbut it actually leads over\nand over to what you said.\nI've seen these parents\nover and over in my private practice.\nMy 14-year-old literally\nwon't pick up their clothes\nfrom the floor unless I give them $5.\nLike, \"How did I get here?\"\nAnd I'm like, \"Yeah, that's a problem,\nbut I saw how they got there.\"\nSo let's take clearing their plate.\nI know this is going to sound cheesy,\nbut kids do have something in them\nwhere they want to feel like a purposeful,\nmeaningful part of society.\nThey do.\nImpact drives adults and it drives kids.\nIt's not the same type of\nrewarding as playing \"Fortnite.\"\nIt's a totally different system.\nBut I think the question is like,\nwhy do we think we have to bribe kids\nor kind of trick them into doing things\nthat are kind of like\nbasic parts of human life?\nAnd so if we take that\nand my kid chronically\nisn't clearing their plate.\nI could say to them,\n\"Look, every time you clear a plate,\nI'm going to give you a sticker.\nAfter five stickers,\nyou're going to get, I\ndon't know, whatever it is.\"\nTo me like a much more just effective way\nis I'd say to my kid,\n\"Hey, I know you know clearing a plate\nis just one way of being\npart of this family\nand taking care of stuff.\nI know you know that\nwe're on the same team.\"\nI say that phrase, \"We're on\nthe same team, right? We are.\"\nSomething's getting in\nyour way of remembering.\nI'm going to assume I like the\nmost generous interpretation.\nThat to me allows you to\nseparate someone's bad behavior\nfrom their good identity.\nThen I might say, \"What\nwould help you remember?\"\nWe literally did this with my son\nwho always had his towel on the floor.\nAnd I was just like, I bet\nhe just doesn't remember.\nHe literally doesn't see it.\nAnd we talked about it and he's like,\nwe talked about him putting\na post-it, literally,\nsomething simple like a post-it on my door\nthat just says, \"Pick up my towel.\"\nHe wrote it in his own handwriting, right?\nTrying to facilitate him like\nsolving his own problems.\nAnd now he has a much higher\nrate of picking up his towel.\nLike I guess I could have said,\n\"Every time you pick up your\ntowel you'll, I don't know,\nget $1 or whatever it is.\"\nBut again, it makes me think\nI'm not building the\ngeneralizable skill that way.\nI'm just kind of offering\nsomething at the end,\nwhich sets me on this kind of awful cycle\nthat I think kind of misses the point.\nI love the idea that kids want purpose.\nAnd am I correct in wondering\nif that goes back to this,\nam I real component of\nthe am I real, am I safe?\nYes.\nLike one way that we know we are real\nis our ability to impart\nchange on the world around us.\nI don't want to get too abstract here,\nbut as a neuroscientist,\nI've often sat back and reflected\nlike all the emotions we feel,\nlike no one sees that or knows that.\nExactly.\nUnless we say something,\nwe write something,\nwe sing something, we shout something,\nall the forms of expression,\njust like none of our\ndreams are creative insights\nor wishes exist, except inside us,\nunless we transmute them into\nsomething in the real world.\nSo there does seem to be something\nabout having this nervous system\nfrom a time we're really young,\nlike it's seeing our effect on the world\nthat really makes us real and on others.\nAnd I love the idea that,\nwell, and I must say I\nabsolutely believe in my heart,\nand I just feel it as a feeling,\nthat kids are inherently good inside.\nLike I can't imagine any\nother version of that.\nBut does that mean that\nthere are people out there\nwho believe that kids are inherently bad\nor at least not good?\nI don't-\nI mean, like how could that be?\nBut then again, maybe I'm just naive.\nI don't know if anyone\nconsciously believes that.\nBut when I go back to that\nsystem I was first trained in,\nrewards and punishments.\nIt feels like a system\nof behavioral control.\nAnd to me, like I've always\nthought about control\nand trust as opposites.\nSo I only control what I don't trust.\nSo nobody said to me in that program.\nBy the way, Becky, everything\nyou're learning here,\nwe believe kids are bad inside,\nand so we do this thing.\nBut, well, if I don't trust my kid,\nand if I don't trust they\ninherently have the things in them\nto do good.\nBy the way, that's not\ngoing to happen naturally.\nThat's why we have a big job\nas a parent to coach our kids,\nto bring that out, to set\nboundaries when they can't do it,\nand so many other things.\nBut I don't believe anyone would say,\n\"Yeah, it's 'cause they're bad inside.\"\nBut there is a nature\nwhere you're constantly\ninteracting with your kid\nfrom that other system,\nlooking at them like,\n\"I don't trust you. I don't trust you.\nAnd when you do bad things,\nI cannot hold on to the fact\nthat you have a good identity.\nThat's why I am giving you a punishment\nthat's I'm sending you away to your room.\nAnd so if I'm reflecting\nback to you constantly\nthat you are just your latest behavior,\nthat I don't trust you,\nthat I kind of have to bribe you\nto do very basic human things.\"\nWell, our kids formed their identity\nfrom our reflection of them.\nAnd so then, this is what\nreally compelled all of this.\nI'm like, \"We're raising\ngeneration after generation of kid\nkind of saying to them like,\n'You're kind of a bad untrustworthy kid.'\nAnd then we wonder why\nwe have such high rates\nof like massive mental health problems.\"\nWell, I'm like, \"There's\nsome linearity there.\"\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full\nlength episode by clicking here."
