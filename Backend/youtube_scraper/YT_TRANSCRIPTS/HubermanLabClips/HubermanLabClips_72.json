    "transcript": "I'd love for you to tell\nus about some of the work\nthat you're doing more recently\non the relationship between\nsleep and opiate use,\nwithdrawal, relapse.\nRelapse.\nAnd craving, just addiction generally.\nI get a lot of questions\nabout people trying\nto come off benzodiazepines\nor people's challenges with benzodiazepine\nand other types of addiction.\nYeah, what is the role\nof sleep in addiction\nand recovery from addiction\nand opiates in particular?\nYeah.\nWell, this is a very young area\nand in fact, my laboratory\nhas just started.\nI have a graduate student\nwho's been in my lab\nfor just one year.\nShe's done amazing work already,\nbut completely groundbreaking work.\nAnd what she has discovered already,\nwe don't have the paper out yet,\nbut we're working on it,\nis that when animals\nwithdraw from opiates,\nand this has been sort of\nreplicated in other ways\nwith other types of things,\nour sleep is disturbed,\nour sleep is terribly disturbed,\nand the amount of sleep disturbance\npredicts relapse behaviors.\nAnd you might think, well, of course\nyou're going to relapse if you can't sleep\nbecause opiates calm you down.\nWell, one of the reasons\nwhy opiates calm you down\nis because the locus\ncoeruleus again, loose spot,\nis covered with opiate receptors\nthat are normally really responsive\nto our endogenous opiates.\nAnd so what happens when\nwe're pleased, for example,\nor laughing or whatever,\nour endogenous opiates\nactivate those receptors\nin the locus coeruleus and calm it down.\nIt actually suppresses\nlocus coeruleus activity.\nIt makes us happy and relaxed.\nOne of the things, reasons\nwhy opiates are so addictive\nis because it also calms us\ndown and makes us relaxed.\nBut the problem with exogenous opiates\nis that they really strongly\nbind these receptors\non our locus coeruleus.\nAnd if you take exogenous\nopiates again and again,\nlike you're recovering\nfrom surgery, for example,\nand take these pain medications,\nis that our locus coeruleus struggles\nto do what it's supposed to do,\nwhich is keep us awake and learning\nand concentrating on things.\nSo it will down-regulate,\nit will internalize these receptors\nthat are normally only\noccupied by endogenous opiates.\nAnd it will do this, it\nwill change our genes\nthat are associated with\nproducing these receptors.\nSo you actually have\nvery many fewer receptors\nso the locus coeruleus, at\nleast during wakefulness,\ncan fire and help us to\ndo these things like learn\nabout our environment.\nAnd so if you long-term\nreduce the number of receptors out there,\nthen when you withdraw\nthe exogenous opiates,\nthere is not enough of\nyour endogenous opiates\nto be able to reoccupy those\nfew receptors that are there.\nAnd our locus coeruleus has nothing\nto calm it down anymore, no pacifier.\nAnd it just fires and fires and fires.\nAnd that phasic and tonic\nhigh activity stresses us out\nbecause it's normally\nassociated with stress.\nAnd so, any exogenous\nstressor that adds to that,\nand it also activates our locus coeruleus,\nthere's nothing to calm it down again.\nAnd so, it just keeps firing.\nIt disturbs our sleep.\nAnd that's why maybe sleep\ndisturbance is an indicator\nof a hyperactive locus coeruleus\nand such a good predictor\nof relapse behaviors\nbecause nobody likes to live\nin that high-stress state\nand they'll do anything\nto get back to normal.\nSo the problem with taking these drugs\nis that it leaves you excited,\nor sorry, relaxed and happy,\nbut then when you come off of it,\nyou're worse than when\nyou were at baseline.\nYou take it again, it only\nbrings you up this far\nbecause you have fewer receptors.\nWhen you come off it,\nyou're down even more\ndepressed and anxious.\nAnd depressed is a word I\nuse loosely, and that's not-\nIt's certainly central\nnervous system depression,\nI mean sleepier, less\nmotivated, lower mood.\nYeah, I mean, our locus\ncoeruleus is actually,\nit's the anxiety kind\nof depression, actually,\nthe anxiety-related depression.\nSo, yeah.\nSo we don't know yet what,\nand there's some good\nresearch going on right now,\nwhat could restore our\nown endogenous receptors\nso that our endogenous\nopiates can properly\ncalm our locus coeruleus\nonce they have been tamped\ndown by exogenous opiates.\nBut that would be really one way\nthat you can access the sleep disturbance.\nSo we talked about sleep\nand the importance of sleep in\nterms of learning and memory,\nthe importance of the structure\nof the 90-minute cycle for all of that.\nSo you can imagine if\nyour sleep is disturbed\nby too much locus coeruleus activity,\nthe structure and the function\nof those sleep spindles\nand that theta during REM sleep\nand the lack of norepinephrine,\nall of those structures,\nall those functions for\nlearning something new,\nlike a new behavior that\ndoesn't involve the drugs,\nbecomes compromised.\nAnd so that's something that Tanya Lugos\nin collaboration with\nPamela Kennedy at UCLA,\nthat we're looking at.\nHow is learning and memory affected\nby the sleep disturbance?\nIs there are a way we can in animals\nthat are coming off of opiates,\ncan we restore their sleeps to normal\nso that then they are less likely\nto duly relapse kinds of behaviors.\n[Music Playing]"
