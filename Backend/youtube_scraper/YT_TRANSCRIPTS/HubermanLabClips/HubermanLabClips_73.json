    "transcript": "There's a number of different hormones\nassociated with the\ndifferent stages of sleep.\nWe know that melatonin is a hormone-\nGINA: Of nighttime.\nOf nighttime that makes us sleepy.\nWhat about growth hormone release?\nWhen does that occur during sleep?\nSo, growth hormone release\nhappens all day long\nand all night long.\nBut the deep slow wave sleep that you get,\nthe very first sleep cycle\nis when you get a big bolus\nof growth hormone release\nand in men and women equally.\nAnd if you miss that first\ndeep slow wave sleep period,\nyou also miss that big bolus\nof growth hormone release.\nAnd you might get\nultimately across the day\njust as much overall\ngrowth hormone release,\nbut endocrinologists will tell you\nthat big boluses do different things\nthan a little bit eked out over time.\nSo, that is when we know there's also\na big push to synthesize proteins.\nSo, that's when the protein synthesis part\nthat builds memories, for\nexample, in our brain,\nhappens in that first cycle of sleep.\nSo you don't want to miss that,\nespecially if you've\nlearned something really big\nand needs more synaptic\nspace to encode it.\nHow would somebody miss\nthat first 90 minutes?\nSleep depriving themselves, yeah.\nSo, let's say I normally\ngo to sleep at 10:00 PM\nand then from 10 to 11:30 would\nbe this first phase of sleep\nand that's when the growth hormone,\nbig bolus of growth\nhormone would be released.\nDoes that mean that if\nI go to sleep instead\nat 11:30 or midnight that I\nmiss that first phase of sleep?\nYeah.\nWhy is it not the case that I get that\nfirst phase of sleep just\nsimply starting later?\nIt is a beautiful clock\nthat we have in our body\nthat knows when things should happen\nand it's every cell in\nour body has a clock\nand all those clocks are\nnormally synchronized.\nThose circadian clocks are synchronized.\nAnd so our cells are ready\nto respond to that growth hormone release\nat a particular time.\nAnd if we miss it, and\nit's a time in relation\nto melatonin also, so if you miss it,\nyeah, you might get some\ngrowth hormone release,\nbut it's occurring at a time\nwhen your clock has already\nmoved to the next phase.\nAnd so, it's just a clock thing.\nYeah, I don't think we can\noverstate the importance\nof what you just described.\nAnd to be honest, despite knowing a bit\nabout the sleep research\nin circadian biology,\nthis is the very first time\nthat I've ever heard this,\nthat if you normally go to\nsleep at a particular time\nand growth hormone is released\nin that first phase of sleep,\nthat you can't simply initiate\nyour sleep about later\nand expect to capture\nthat first phase of sleep.\nYeah.\nThat's incredible and I think important\nand as many listeners\nare probably realizing\nalso highly actionable.\nSo what this means is that we should have\nfairly consistent bedtimes.\nYes.\nIn addition to fairly\nconsistent wake times.\nIs that right?\nYes, exactly.\nAnd in fact, one of the best markers\nof good neurological\nhealth when we get older\nis consistent bedtimes.\nWow, okay.\nI don't want to backtrack,\nbut I did write down\nsomething that I think is\nimportant for me to resolve\nor for you to resolve.\nSo I'm going to ask this.\nPeople that sleep nine hours or more,\nperhaps that reflecting an issue,\nsome underlying issue perhaps.\nIs being a teenager or an adolescent\nand undergoing a stage of development\nwhere there's a lot of\nbodily and brain growth\nan exception to that because-\nYes.\nI don't recall sleeping a\nton when I was a teenager.\nI had a ton of energy.\nBut I know a few teenagers\nand they sleep a lot.\nGINA: Yeah.\nLike they'll just sleep and\nsleep and sleep and sleep.\nShould we let them sleep\nand sleep and sleep?\nYes, let them sleep.\nANDREW: Okay, so that's the one exception.\nJust like babies.\nANDREW: Okay.\nWhen you're developing\nsomething in your brain\nor the rest of your body,\nyou really need sleep\nto help organize that.\nI mean, sleep is doing really hard work\nin organizing our brains\nand making it develop right.\nAnd if we deprive ourselves of sleep,\nwe will actually also, just like I said,\nwe have a daily clock, we also\nhave a developmental clock.\nAnd we can miss a developmental window\nif we don't let ourselves\nsleep extra like we need to.\nWhat other things inhibit\ngrowth hormone release\nor other components of\nthis first stage of sleep?\nIn other words, if I go to sleep\nreligiously every night at 10:00 PM,\nare there things that I perhaps\ndo in the preceding hours\nof the preceding day, like\ningest caffeine or alcohol\nthat can make that first\nstage of sleep less effective,\neven if I'm going to\nsleep at the same time?\nAlcohol definitely will do that\nbecause alcohol is a REM sleep suppressant\nand it even suppresses some of that\nstage two transition to REM\nwith those sleep spindles.\nAnd those sleep spindles,\nwe didn't talk about their function yet,\nbut they're really important\nfor moving memories to our cortex.\nIt's a unique time when our hippocampus,\nthe sort of like the RAM of our brains\nwrites it to a hard disc,\nwhich is the cortex.\nAnd it's a unique time\nwhen they're connected.\nSo if you don't want to miss that,\nyou don't want to miss REM sleep,\nwhich is also a part of\na consolidation process\nand schema-changing process.\nAnd alcohol before we go\nto sleep will do that.\nUntil we've metabolized alcohol\nand put it out of our bodies,\nit will affect our sleep badly.\nSo probably fair to say,\nno ingestion of alcohol\nwithin the four to six\nhours preceding sleep?\nYeah.\nGiven the half life?\nOr at all would be better,\nbut I know some people\nrefuse to go that way.\nMaybe a little bit is okay.\nI don't know what the dose response is,\nbut there are studies out\nthere you can look at.\nGreat.\nSo we're still in the first stage of sleep\nand I apologize for slowing us down,\nbut it sounds like it's\nan incredibly important\nfirst phase of sleep.\nGINA: Yeah.\nWhat about the second and third\n90-minute blocks of sleep?\nIs there anything that makes those unique?\nWhat is their signature,\nbesides the fact that they come\nsecond and third in the night?\nThere's more and more REM sleep\nthe later the night we get.\nThere's also a change in hormones.\nThe growth hormone and melatonin levels\nare starting to decline, but\nother hormones are picking up.\nSo it is a really different stage\nthat you also don't want\nto shortchange yourself on.\nAnd I think that's the stage.\nMany studies are showing that\nthose are the times in sleep\nwhen the most creativity can happen.\nThat's when our dreams can\nincorporate and put together\nold and new things together into a new way\nand our schema are built during that time.\nSo yeah, we can change our minds best\nduring those phases of sleep.\n[Music Playing]"
