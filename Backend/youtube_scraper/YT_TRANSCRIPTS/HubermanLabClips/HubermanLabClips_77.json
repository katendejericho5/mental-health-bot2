    "transcript": "So it sounds like any\nform of cold to the skin\nthat people register as\nwhat you called a cold shock\nor an uncomfortable like,\noh, like this is kind\nof jarring, activates the brown fat.\nDo we know what the pathway\nis from cold receptors\non the skin to the brown fat?\nI mean, how does the brown\nfat know that we're cold?\nCHUCKLES: Yeah, really good question.\nAnd it seems that I think\nthat of course in the future\nwe will know much more\nabout these pathways,\nbut what we do know is\nthat the cold receptors\nwill send a signal to our\ntemperature regulating center\nin the brain, so hypothalamus,\nand that's going to be\ntaking in this message.\nAnd we have so many cold\nreceptors in the skin,\nso it's going to be\nvery fast, you can say,\nif you immerse the body into cold water,\nthis is going to be so rapid.\nSo it will have a rapid\nincrease in neurotransmitters\nin the brain, so noradrenaline,\nadrenaline and cortisol,\nwhich is not that much,\nbut it's still there.\nSo you have this increase\nin noradrenaline,\nwhich will then immediately\nactivate the brown fat\nbecause the, you can say the activator\nis the most potent one,\ncold and noradrenaline,\nthat's going to activate the brown fat.\nBut there's also a direct\npathway from the cold receptors\nin the skin to the brown\nfat, which really shows\nthat if, because of these\ndifferent pathways, it shows that,\nthat it could be that this\ntissue to keep us warm\nwas developed in our evolvement as humans\nto keep us warm and to save\nus whenever the temperature\non our skin varies just\na little bit to keep us\nin that right homeostatic\nbalance so we don't get\nhypothermic, but also so\nwe don't get hyperthermic.\nBut because it seems that the\nbrown fat is also activated\nwhen we get warmer on our skin.\nSo it's also maybe a temperature regulator\nin our body, but the pathway is different.\nI think it's also a third pathway\nfrom directly from the muscles.\nSo the brown fat is also activated\neven though the muscles\nare starting to shiver.\nSo there's an extra pathway that way\nto keep our temperature up.\nSo muscles and brown\nfat are working together\nto keep us warm so we\ndon't suffer too much\nin the cold water.\nIt's super interesting and\nwhat I hear you pointing to\nis the existence of\nthree parallel pathways\nand this notion of\nparallel pathways comes up\nover and over again in\nbiology, as you and I know,\nand I think it's important\nfor people to know about\nbecause as you said so, so eloquently,\nwhen something is very\nimportant to our survival\nand our evolution, the\nbrain and body install\nmultiple mechanisms for it, not just one.\nAnd so it sounds like it's cold skin,\ncold on the skin triggers an a\nresponse in the hypothalamus,\nwhich then activates brown fat,\ncold receptors in the skin\ndirectly to the brown fat\nand then shivering in the\nmuscle to the brown fat.\nI want to talk about brown fat in depth\nand learn from you more about brown fat.\nBefore that, however, I\nwant to ask about shiver.\nI've heard that shiver causes\nthe release of succinate,\nwhich then activates the brown fat.\nIs it known whether or not\ninducing shiver is important\nand when should people shiver?\nI mean, I've gotten into cold plunges\nand shivered while I was in there,\nand then I've also had the experience\nof getting into a cold\nplunge or a cold shower,\nthen getting out, but\neven standing outside\non a warm day after swimming in a pool\nand then starting to shiver.\nSo the shiver comes later.\nSo how important is shiver\nand does it matter when shiver happens?\nYeah, well, shivering is good\nbecause that increases your metabolism\nand that's going to burn\nsome calories in your body.\nYou shouldn't be so afraid\nof shivering, I think.\nbecause the shivering, as long as\nyou don't get too hypothermic,\nso if you don't sit in the\ncold water for too long.\nAnd what you just said by shivering\nafter you get up that is\nbecause of the after drop.\nSomething called the after drop is when\nyour core temperature decreases even after\nyou get out of the cold water.\nAnd it always does that, your body,\nbecause it, as soon as you get\ninto the cold water, all the,\nyour blood vessels is going to constrict\nbecause you need to keep\nyour blood in your core\nand keep your vital organs warm.\nSo as soon as you get up\nthose blood vessel would open again\nand the warm blood would\nflow out and get colder\nand then flow back again into the core.\nAnd that's going to decrease\nthe temperature in your core, of course.\nSo that's the drop.\nGot it. Oh, I'm so glad\nyou explained that.\nI've heard years ago, Wim Hof,\nI heard him talk about the drop\nand I've heard colleagues\nof mine talk about the drop,\nbut that's the first time I've ever\nheard it explained clearly.\nLet me make sure I understand this.\nSo I get into cold water,\nobviously I'm cold,\nvessels constrict to keep\nblood near the center\nof my body, keep me alive.\nI get out, the warming up of\nmy body allows those vessels\nand capillaries to dilate\nagain, the blood goes out\nto the surface, but the\nsurface is still cold,\nand so that blood is cooled\nand then my core body temperature drops.\nAnd that's what you're\nreferring to as the drop\nand that's what induces shiver.\nExactly.\nAnd then am I right in thinking\nthat then the shiver activates brown fat,\nwhich then warms me up again?\nYes.\nGot it.\nThat's why you should end on the cold,\nbut we can get back to that.\nYeah, let's talk about, yes,\nending on cold is, you know,\nit's what I refer to as and\nwhat has now become known as\nthe Søberg principle,\nwhich is a really important\nprinciple about the\nimportance of ending on cold\nand not doing what I do, which\nis to get into a hot shower\nor back in the sauna.\nBut we'll, we will get back\nto that in a few minutes.\nSo that's wonderful that you\ncan explain that so clearly\nbecause I think that shiver is something\nthat a lot of people do avoid.\nPeople think, \"Oh, I don't want that.\"\nYeah.\nYou know,\nthe chattering of the\nteeth and it feels like\na loss of bodily control,\nwhich really it is.\nIt's an autonomic response.\nYeah, but I don't think\nthat people should avoid it that much.\nIt's just like seeing\nshivering as a way of your body\nin a, like it's training,\nit's training for your,\nfor all your cells, it's\ntraining for your muscles,\nit's training of your metabolism.\nAnd that's going to increase your,\nwhat's called the insulin sensitivity.\nSo if you can, like, in your\nmind, get used to the thought\nof shivering is just like\nwhen you go exercising\nin the training center and\nget that feeling of like,\noh, this is tough, now\nit hurts a little bit.\nYeah, it's going to hurt because that's\nwhat shivering also does,\nbut it's just a different way\nof training your cells in your body.\nIt's going to create\nwhat is healthy stress,\nit's called hormesis in the cells.\nAnd the more you expose your muscle cells\nor your brown fat cells\nto these kind of like\nhealthy stresses, exercise,\ncold and heat exposure,\nit's going to make them\nbetter at like activating\nand also at keeping you healthy.\nSo as long as the the\ncells get exposed to this,\nit's going to keep them\non its toes, you can say,\nbecause it becomes more robust,\nincreasing these heat shock\nproteins and culture proteins in the cells\nto make you more robust for the next time.\nAnd that is also what happens\nwhen you go to the training center.\nAnd I keep like drawing that parallel\nbecause people today know more about,\nwe know more about exercise\nand what that is going to\ndo to your muscle cells.\nBut the same kind of like\ntraining is also what you do\nwhen you go out and into\nthe cold water and submerge\ninto cold water because\nthat is just your cold\ntraining center, you can say that.\nAnd also your heat training\ncenter going into the sauna\nbecause the cells are getting\nstronger with hormetic stress.\nSo it's the same process,\njust different practice.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
