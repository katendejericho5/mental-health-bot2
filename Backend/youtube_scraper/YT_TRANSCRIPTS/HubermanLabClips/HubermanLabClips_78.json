    "transcript": "Let's talk about psilocybin,\nand again, today we're going to focus\nspecifically on psilocybin\nand we're going to set aside\nall the other psychedelics\nfor future episodes.\nPsilocybin is what's called a tryptamine.\nThat refers to its chemical composition,\nnot to the so-called psychedelic trip.\nIn fact, it's spelled differently.\nTryptamine is T-R-Y-P,\ntrip, T-R-I-P, of course.\nTryptamines include psilocybin,\nbut also things like DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.\nThe tryptamine psychedelics\nvery closely resemble serotonin itself.\nThat's right, most of\nyou have probably heard\nof the chemical serotonin,\nand serotonin is what's\ncalled a neuromodulator,\nwhich means your brain and\nbody naturally make it,\nand that it modifies\nor changes the activity\nof other neurons and neural circuits.\nAnd it does that generally\nby either increasing\nor decreasing the activity\nof those neural circuits.\nIf I were to show you a picture\nof the chemical structure\nof psilocybin, or its\nactive derivative psilocin,\nand I were to also put right alongside it\nan image of the chemical\nstructure of serotonin,\nprovided that you weren't a chemist\nwho really likes to focus\non the detailed differences\nbetween things, you would say,\n\"Those look very similar.\"\nAnd indeed, psilocybin and\nits active form psilocin\nare very similar\nstructurally and chemically\nto serotonin itself.\nNow, as I mentioned before,\nserotonin is something\nthat you naturally make.\nAnd yes, it's true that\nabout 90% of the serotonin\nin your brain and body is\nmanufactured in your gut.\nHowever, contrary to popular belief,\nthe serotonin in your\nbrain is not manufactured\nfrom the serotonin in your gut.\nYou have separate independent\nsources of serotonin.\nThat is you have particular neurons\nthat make serotonin in your brain.\nYou also have serotonin in your gut,\nand those work more or less\nin parallel separately.\nNow, what does serotonin do?\nThis is really important to understand\nbecause of the similarity\nbetween psilocybin,\nand its active form\npsilocin, and serotonin.\nSerotonin, in that it's a neuromodulator,\nchanges the activity of other neurons,\nand the net effects of those changes\nare things that you're familiar with.\nFor instance, satiety,\nor the feeling that we've\nhad enough of various things\nsuch as food or a social\ninteraction or sex\nor pleasure of any kind.\nSerotonin is involved in all of that\nand an enormous number of other things\nsuch as mood regulation,\nsuch as our sense of pleasure itself\nor lack of pleasure,\nsuch as whether or not we feel\nmotivated or not motivated.\nIt works in concert with\nother neuromodulators\nsuch as dopamine and\nepinephrine and norepinephrine.\nIn fact, if this were an\nepisode about serotonin,\nwhich it is not, you would soon realize\nthat serotonin is involved in\nso many different functions\nthat impact our daily life.\nAnd that is one reason\nwhy certain antidepressant\nmedications which alter,\neither increase or decrease,\nthe amount of serotonin\ntransmission in the brain\nwill often have a lot of side effects\nrelated to things like mood, libido,\nappetite, sleep, et cetera.\nIt's because serotonin is involved\nin so many different things.\nAnd serotonin is involved\nin so many different things\nbecause there are a lot of different\nso-called serotonin receptors.\nSerotonin is a chemical\nthat we call a ligand,\nand the chemical ligand\nis simply the thing\nthat plugs into the receptor\nfor that chemical or ligand.\nThe receptors, in this\ncase, serotonin receptors\nhave the opportunity to do\nall sorts of different things.\nThey can change the activity of neurons,\nmaking them more active or less active.\nThey can cause growth\nfactors to be released,\nmaking sure that those neurons reinforce\nor even build up stronger connections\nso that they're more likely\nto be active in the future.\nSerotonin binding to particular receptors\ncan even change the gene\nexpression in particular cells\nmaking those cells proliferate,\nso make more of them,\nmaking those cells more robust,\nmaking those cells\ninteract with new elements\nof the brain and body.\nBasically, serotonin and all\nthese different receptors\nthat it binds to has\ndozens if not hundreds\nand maybe even thousands\nof different functions.\nSo, the fact that psilocybin\nso closely resembles serotonin\nleads to a very important question\nthat we should all be asking ourselves,\nwhich is why is it that psilocybin,\nwhich looks so much like serotonin,\nwhen one takes it in the\nform of magic mushrooms\nor some other form,\nmaybe the synthetic form\nof psilocybin itself,\nwhich nowadays is\nmanufactured in laboratories\nand placed in different\npsilocybin containing foods\nand pills, et cetera.\nWhy that leads to complex,\nyet fairly circumscribed\nsets of experience,\nlike visual and auditory hallucinations,\nchanges in particular thought patterns,\nand neuroplasticity that in many cases\nin the clinical setting provided\nthings are done correctly,\nimprovements in mood,\nrelief from depression,\nrelief from various compulsive\ndisorders, et cetera, right?\nThis is really what you need to understand\nif you want to understand\npsilocybin and how it works\nand how to make it work optimally\nfor a given condition or goal.\nYou have to understand\nwhat it's actually doing.\nAnd what allows psilocybin\nto do fairly specific things\nin comparison to serotonin,\neven though psilocybin and\nserotonin are so similar,\nis that psilocybin mainly binds to\nand activates the so-called\nserotonin 2A receptor.\nThe serotonin 2A receptor\nis one of, again,\nmany different serotonin receptors,\nbut serotonin 2A is expressed\nin particular areas of the brain\nand even on particular areas\nof neurons in the brain\nthat allow for very\nspecific types of changes\nin neural circuitry to take place,\nnot just when one is under\nthe influence of psilocybin,\nbut afterwards as well.\nSo really, in order to\nhave a useful discussion\nabout psilocybin,\nwe need to talk a lot about\nthe serotonin 2A receptor.\nBut you know, fortunately for you,\nunless you're somebody really interested\nin structural biology or cell biology,\nthat discussion is not going\nto be about the binding pocket\nfor serotonin on serotonin 2A receptor,\nor a lot of the downstream signaling\nof the serotonin 2A receptor.\nWe'll talk a little bit about\nthat where it's relevant,\nbut more importantly,\nat least for sake of today's discussion,\nwe're going to talk about\nhow the serotonin 2A receptor\nis really the one responsible\nfor triggering all the\nchanges in neural circuitry\nthat lead to the changes,\nthat is the improvements in mood,\nthe relief from compulsive\ndisorders in many case.\nBut really it's the serotonin\n2A receptor selectivity\nof psilocybin that is\nleading to all the excitement\nthat you hear about in terms of psilocybin\nas a therapeutic tool.\nLet me say that from a\nslightly different angle.\nThere are data that I'll talk about today\nwhich show that one,\nalthough in most cases,\ntwo psilocybin journeys\ndone with particular dosages of psilocybin\nlead to maximal binding, or occupancy,\nof those serotonin 2A receptors\nin ways that lead to significant\nand unprecedented relief\nfor major depression.\nIn fact, you'll soon learn\nthat the clinical trials\nfor psilocybin are\noutperforming standard therapy\nand outperforming so-called SSRIs\nand various other antidepressants\nin terms of providing depression relief\nin ways that are, frankly, staggering,\nnot just to me, but to the\npsychiatric community at large.\nAnd this is where so much of\nthe excitement is coming from.\nNow, that statement\ncould be taken one way,\nwhich is to just say,\nokay, well, here's a compound psilocybin\nthat outperforms SSRIs,\nand therefore all the attention\nshould be on psilocybin.\nBut SSRI stands for selective\nserotonin re-uptake inhibitor.\nIn other words, the SSRIs\nof which there's now a lot\nof controversy, things like\nProzac, Zoloft, et cetera.\nAnd I'm sure you've heard\nsome of this controversy.\nThere are people who are very pro-SSRIs,\nalthough there are a\ngrowing number of people\nwho really feel that the SSRIs\nare probably most appropriate\nfor things like obsessive\ncompulsive disorder,\nwhere they, in fact,\ncan be very beneficial.\nBut there's a lot of kind\nof leaning back from SSRIs\nas the be-all end-all\nfor the treatment of depression nowadays,\nbecause of the side effect profiles.\nAnd the fact that it's\nnot even really clear\nthat serotonin deficiencies\nare the major cause of\ndepression in the first place.\nNow, again, we're talking about\npsilocybin, not about SSRIs,\nbut you should be\nthinking, \"Wait, how is it\n\"that two molecules, psilocybin\nand some particular SSRI,\n\"both of which look like\n\"and or increase serotonin\ntransmission in the brain\n\"are leading to either incredibly positive\n\"and interesting outcomes\n\"or to kind of troubling side\neffect riddled outcomes.\"\nAnd again, it all boils\nback down to the selectivity\nof psilocybin to bind that\nserotonin 2A receptor.\nAnd so in order to understand\nhow psilocybin works\nand in order to understand\nproper dosing profiles\nand spacing of sessions, AKA journeys,\nwe really need to talk a little bit more\nabout the serotonin 2A receptor,\nwhere it is in the brain,\nwhat sorts of things happen\nwhen psilocybin binds the\nserotonin 2A receptor,\nand how those things set in motion\nthe various changes, the neuroplasticity\nthat allows people to feel\nbetter in terms of their mood,\nand as you'll soon learn,\ncan experience more pleasure\nand joy from things like\nmusic and enhanced creativity.\nAll the things that I do believe\nwhether or not people are thinking about\nor maybe even exploring psilocybin\nfor recreational or therapeutic purposes,\nall the things that people want\nand are really talking about,\nand perhaps even doing\npsilocybin in order to obtain.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
