    "transcript": "The serotonin 2A receptors\nare located in multiple brain regions,\nbut they have a tremendous\namount of expression\nin the so-called neocortex,\nthe outside of the brain.\nThat includes things like\nour prefrontal cortex,\nwhich is involved in\nunderstanding context, right?\nWhich behaviors, thoughts,\nand, you know, speech patterns,\nare appropriate for certain circumstances,\nhow to switch context, and\ncategory switch when you go from,\nyou know, playing sports to\nhanging out with friends,\nto being in a professional\nsetting, you change your behavior\nand the way that you speak,\nand perhaps even the way that you think.\nYou might think some things\nthat are out of context,\nbut you probably keep those to yourself,\nand your ability to keep those to yourself\nare dependent on a\nfunctional prefrontal cortex.\nThere are a lot of 5HT-2A,\nand by the way, 5HT is the\nabbreviation for serotonin.\nSo, there are a lot of\nserotonin 2A receptors\nin the prefrontal cortex, also\nin other areas of the cortex\nthat are associated with\nsensation and perception.\nThat is hearing of sounds,\nthat is seeing of particular things.\nAnd, in particular, there\nis a very, very, very high\nexpression of serotonin 2A\nreceptors in the visual cortex,\nand that is one of the reasons\nwhy psilocybin triggers\nvisual hallucinations, and\nprovided psilocybin is present\nat sufficient enough concentration,\nthat is taken at a sufficient dosage,\none will experience profound\nvisual hallucinations,\nregardless of whether or\nnot their eyes are open,\nor their eyes are closed.\nNow, that's an important fact,\nbecause it explains one of the\nmajor effects of psilocybin\nthat people experience\nwhile they are on the drug.\nNow, as I'll talk about\na little bit later,\nin terms of what constitutes\na useful psilocybin session,\nuseful meaning that it's\nleading to adaptive improvements\nin mood, adaptive improvements\nin creativity and cognition,\net cetera, is that people\nnot have their eyes open\nfor at least the majority\nof the psilocybin session.\nThis is something I've\ndiscussed with several experts\nwho are running clinical\nstudies on psilocybin\nin their laboratories, some\nof whom are going to be guests\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\nin upcoming episodes,\nand I can't underscore this enough,\nbecause your visual cortex contains\nso many of these serotonin 2A receptors,\nand because psilocybin binds so strongly\nto that serotonin 2A receptor,\nyou're going to experience a\nlot of visual hallucinations\nwhen you are under the\ninfluence of psilocybin,\nthere's no surprise there.\nThis has been known for hundreds,\nif not thousands of years.\nIt's one of the main reasons\nwhy people take psilocybin.\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier,\nthese hallucinations occur\neven when the eyes are closed,\nand it's now fairly well established\nthat if people are to take psilocybin,\nand have their eyes open,\nmuch of their cognition,\nmuch of their thinking,\nmuch of the time spent in\nthat psilocybin journey\nis focused on the altered\nperceptions of things\nin the outside environment.\nSometimes this looks like\na, sort of a fracturing\nof the outside world, into\nkind of geometric shapes.\nSometimes it appears as a, kind of,\nmelting of things in\nthe visual environment,\nincluding people's faces, or\na morphing of people's faces.\nAll of that has a strong,\nlet's just call it a draw,\nfor a lot of people who are\nlooking for a highly unusual\nexperience inside of\nthe psilocybin journey.\nBut, I think if one's goal\nis to derive the long lasting benefit\nfrom the psilocybin experience,\nit's very clear that having an eye mask,\nor some other eye covering,\nor something that ensures\nthat one's eyes are closed\nfor the majority, if not the\nentire psilocybin session,\nis going to be very useful,\nbecause it's going to\nlimit the extent to which\none is focused on those outside changes\nin visual perception, AKA, hallucinations,\nand rather will allow\nthe person to go inward\nto combine whatever it is\nthat they happen to be seeing\nin their mind's eye,\nwith the different thoughts, and memories,\nand changes in their\nemotions that are occurring.\nAnd, that going inward, by\nstaying in the eye mask,\nat least for the majority of the time,\nseems to be a very, if\nnot the critical feature\nof making the psilocybin journey effective\nin the therapeutic sense.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
