    "transcript": "I read a paper this last year,\nand I think it was covered\nin a bit of popular press,\nthat during rapid eye movement sleep,\npeople can solve problems or\nrespond to external stimuli.\nLike for instance, they would\ngive them math problems,\nthey'd whisper in their ear\nwhile they were in REM sleep.\nYou know, what's two plus two?\nAnd people would say, even\nthough they were paralyzed,\napparently they could\nstill move their mouth\nbecause they'd say four\nor something like that.\nOr they'd say, you know, what's your name?\nAnd people could respond.\nAnd so that in REM sleep,\nperhaps people, some elements of cognition\nare still active.\nI'm glad you brought that up.\nWhat do you think of, and\nI don't know the authors\nof that study, and listen, if\never I say something wrong,\nit's great on this podcast\nbecause someone will tell\nus in the YouTube comments.\nIt's one of the great\nuses of YouTube comments.\nBut I'd love to know your\nthoughts on that study.\nI mean, is that just\nkind of an odd feature,\nor does this have meaning,\nshould we actually care about this result?\nThere's no just about it.\nIt's really actually\nintriguing and interesting,\nand might relate to this\npaper that I talked about\nwhere we said different areas\nof the brain can be in different\nstates at the same time.\nSo lucid dreaming is another thing\nwe can't ask animals to do\nor can't ask them if they've done it,\nbut we can certainly ask humans to do it.\nAnd some people can do it really well.\nAnd it would be really\ninteresting to see in those people\nwho could lucid dream really well\nwhether they spend more or less time\nin this asymmetrical state,\nwhere one area the brain is in one state\nand another area of the\nbrain is in another.\nAnd it might be that those people\ncan respond to questions\nduring REM sleep best\nare those that have the most\nasymmetry or dissimilarity\nor dissociation between subcortical\nand cortical structures.\nOr it might be that they're the\nones with the most symmetry.\nWe don't know.\nI do worry a little bit\nabout lucid dreaming\n'cause people are, it's a fad,\npeople are really excited about it.\nAnd to be able to remember\none's dreams is fun often,\nunless they're nightmares.\nAnd, but it's really interesting.\nOr to be able to direct one's dreams,\nif they are in nightmares is\nreally wonderful power to have,\nto be able to redirect a\nnightmare that has been repeated\nto something else, and\nthen kick yourself out\nof that repetitive\nnightmare is really nice.\nBut I worry a little bit about it\nbecause we know so little\nabout what's actually\ngoing on in the brain.\nAnd if this lucid streaming\nstate is preventing us from,\nfor example, from the locus\ncoeruleus from calming down,\nor the serotonergic system\nfrom silencing like it should.\nAnd maybe what we're doing\nduring this state is,\nyeah, we're activating the\nlearning and memory structures,\nbut in a way that's maladaptive\nin terms of the erasure\nthat we need to do.\nSo maybe one of the\nreasons why most people\ndon't remember most of their\ndreams is for good reason,\nyour hippocampus is in a state\nwhere it's not writing new memories.\nIn fact, it's writing out\nthe memories it learned\nduring the day to the cortex,\nand it's immune from\nincoming new information.\nSo maybe lucid dreaming is bad\nbecause you're activating\nthe hippocampus in a way\nthat's writing new memories.\nAnd it might be really\nmaladaptive for things like,\nyou know, PTSD on the other hand.\nLet me just argue myself\nright out of this.\nWhen I used to have a repeated\nnightmare when I was a kid,\nmy mother, who's so wise, would tell me,\nwell listen, just next time\nyou're in that dream, you know,\nsay hey, I'm in a dream.\nAnd then change something about it.\nSo she and I rehearsed\nwhat the horrible dream,\nthat it was a big monster,\nyou know, running after me.\nAnd my legs were like mud\nand I couldn't run away.\nAnd it was just terrifying.\nAnd that was a dream I\nwould have, you know,\ntime and time again.\nShe said, okay, next time,\nwhat are you going to do\nwhen that monster comes after you?\nI said, I'm going to run away.\nNo, that's what you do every time.\nAnd it's always the same outcome.\nYou can't run, so let's\ndo something different.\nLike, what could you do that's different?\nSo I came up with, well,\nI could turn around\nand punch it in the nose.\nShe said, yeah, that's great.\nAnd so the next time I had that dream,\nI did recognize, this is that\nsame old dream, which means\nthat there's part of my\nbrain that's conscious enough\nto know that I'm in a dreaming state.\nAnd then I didn't have\nthe courage in my dream\n'cause I was still terrified\nto punch, you know,\nor touch the monster in any way.\nBut I did have the courage to turn around\nand look at in the eye and say, no.\nThat was enough, I said, no.\nAnd that was enough to knock me out\nof that rut of that dream so\nthat I never had it again,\nI never had that same dream again.\nAnd in fact, it gave\nme peace about dreaming\nbecause I knew that if\never there was a nightmare\nthat was just too scary,\nI could probably do something to change it\nand knock myself out of it.\nSo even though I don't\nrecommend lucid dreaming\non a normal, day-to-day\nbasis, if it's enough\nthat can knock you out of a rut,\none thing that happens with\npeople with PTSD is they have\nthe same repeated, horrible\nnightmare, which is often\na reliving of the day's\ntrauma that they had.\nSo maybe lucid dreaming\ncan be used on occasion\nto be a powerful tool,\nbecause there's so much plasticity\nthat happens during REM sleep,\nto knock you out of that\nrut of reliving that event,\nand just change it.\nAnd you could probably practice\nthat during wakefulness,\nrehearse the event that happened\nthat was so traumatic, and then\njust introduce a new element\nlike, you know, now I'm safe.\nNow, you know, the sound\nthat was associated\nwith that really traumatic\nthing, I should now associate\nwith something else,\nand next time I have that\ndream, I'm going to change it.\nSo that sound is now this new thing\nthat it should be associated with safety.\nAnd that might be enough, maybe, I hope,\nto knock you out of\nthat repeated nightmare\nand maybe even start you\non the path to recovery.\nBecause if you can calm down\nabout those nightmare states of sleep,\nthen maybe your locus coeruleus,\nwhich is involved in\nstress, can also relax\nand you can do the erasure\nparts that need to be done.\nI love it.\nI seem to recall a paper,\nand I'll have to find the\nreference and send it to you,\nwe will also put in\nthe show note captions,\nthat described a protocol\nthat essentially matches this idea.\nAnd, well, I think what they had people do\nwas either cue themselves\nto a particular smell\nor tone in wakefulness,\nthen to try and recall\na recurring nightmare.\nThen during the night's sleep,\nthey had the tone playing\nin the background,\nwhich would then cue them\nto the wakeful state.\nThey're still asleep, mind you,\nbut in the pseudo lucid or lucid state.\nAnd then try and change some\nvariable, as you're describing.\nSome either look the predator in the eyes\nor do something different.\nAnd then in the waking state,\ntake a little bit of time\nto try and script out a\ndifferent narrative altogether.\nAnd it took several nights,\nas I recall, or more,\nbut that they were able to\nescape this recurring nightmare.\nYeah, it was like a week or something.\nOh, so you're familiar with the study?\nYeah, that's a beautiful\nstudy, I loved it.\nWe will put a reference to that.\nI need to revisit that study.\nIt's pretty recent, but I\nneed to dive into it again\n'cause I think I didn't go as\ndeep into it as I should have.\nNo, no, but the one thing that you,\nwell, you said many right things,\nbut one of the things you\nsaid is that they were able to\ncue the dreamer.\nThey knew when were going into REM sleep,\nand then they played the\nsound or had the odor.\nNow, when you're normally\nasleep alone in your bed,\nyou're not going to be\nable to cue yourself.\nBut it might be that rehearsal\nenough before you go to sleep\nis enough to, you know, help cue you\nto that repeated nightmare,\nremembering what the nightmare\nis, and then figuring out\nhow to cue yourself to\ndo something different.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
