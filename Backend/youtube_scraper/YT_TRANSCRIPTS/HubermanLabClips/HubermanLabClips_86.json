    "transcript": "So how can we overcome procrastination?\nWell, it turns out that there are findings\nfrom within the addiction literature\nthat turn out to be very powerful\ntowards leveraging our way\nout of procrastination.\nAnd it has to do with this,\nyou already know,\nbecause I've told you\nprobably a dozen times now,\nthat the depth of the trough\nafter a dopamine peak is proportional\nto how high that peak\nwas and how steep it was,\nhow quickly that peak occurred.\nIt turns out that not only is the depth\nof the trough proportional to that,\nbut the rate at which you\nget out of that trough\nis proportional to how\nsteep that trough is.\nLet me explain this for\nyou in as clear terms\nas I possibly can.\nImagine you're in an amotivated state,\nyou're just not feeling motivated,\nyou're procrastinating.\nYou may think, \"Okay, the\nthing to do here is something,\nI'll clean the house, I'll\ntake care of some bills,\nI'll do something,\nor I'll just wait.\"\nThose approaches, as\nwe talked about before,\ngenerally don't work,\nor at least don't work quickly,\nor they lead you right up to the deadline\nand that's the deadline that forces you\nto get something done or\nyou just don't get it done\nand you don't succeed in your goal.\nThat happens a lot as well.\nHowever, if you were to take\nthat state of being unmotivated\nor procrastinating\nand actually do something that's harder\nthan being in that amotivated state,\nin other words, doing something\nthat's more effortful, even painful,\nyou can rebound yourself\nout of that dopamine\ntrough much more quickly.\nSo what do I mean you want\nto put yourself in a state\nthat's worse than or harder\nthan the state that you're in,\nor do something, quote\nunquote \"more painful\".\nAnd here I want to be very clear.\nI'll say this three times,\nbut I'm going to say it\nfor the first time now.\nWhen I say more painful,\nI do not mean doing any kind\nof tissue damaging or\npsychologically damaging behavior\nor anything of that sort\nthat's going to render\nyou injured or not well,\neven in the short term,\nthat's not what I'm referring to, okay.\nLet's just get that one out of the way.\nWhat I'm referring to is\nthe fact that, for instance,\nif you're feeling amotivated,\nbut you find yourself cleaning the house\nas a way to procrastinate, you can say,\n\"Well, cleaning the house is harder\nthan sitting down and doing nothing.\"\nBut actually in that moment\nor in those moments, that's not the case\nor else you wouldn't be doing it.\nThe reality is that the\ndopamine system works\naccording to what feels\nhard or easy in the moment.\nIn other words, if you're\nfeeling amotivated,\nyou need to do something\nand put yourself into\na state that's harder\nthan the state you're in.\nSo for instance, if you're\nsitting around feeling amotivated\nor you find yourself tending\nto tasks that are irrelevant\nto the goal that you really\nshould be focused on,\nyou need to put your body\nand mind into a state\nof discomfort quickly.\nAnd the way to do that is to either engage\nin some tangential activity,\nmeaning an activity not\nrelated to your goal\nthat puts your body into\na very different state.\nSo here again, I'll\ndefault to the obvious one,\nwhich is something like cold shower\nor cold immersion,\nwhich not only increases\ndopamine long-term\nor over several hours rather,\nbut for most people is\nexperienced as pain.\nThat pain causes a rebound\nout of that dopamine trough\nfaster than it would occur\nif you had just stayed\nin that amotivated state\nand waited for it to go away\nor done something like cleaning\nup that for whatever reason,\nfelt like it required less friction.\nWhen I say friction, I\nmean limbic friction.\nYour limbic system is\nalways in this dialogue\nwith your forebrain and\nlimbic friction goes two ways.\nLimbic friction can be you're tired\nand you don't want to do something,\nand so you have to quote\nunquote, \"motivate to do it\",\nenergize yourself to do it,\nor limbic friction can be\nthat you're nervous and scared\nand anxious to do something,\nand you have to calm yourself\nin order to lean forward into action\nin order to do that thing\ndespite the anxiety.\nI realize this can be a little\nbit confusing as a concept,\nso I want to go into a bit more detail.\nLet's imagine that you\nor somebody else does\nnot like to exercise.\nYou don't want to exercise,\nand you're trying\nto get your minimum of\nfive days per week exercise\nand you're just not motivated to do it.\nThere are a couple of different\ntechniques to doing this.\nAssuming you've taken care\nof all the baseline stuff,\nall the foundational stuff\nwe talked about earlier,\nand you're just not getting in gear\nand you find yourself checking your phone\nor maybe you're tending to some tasks,\nobviously those things are\nquote unquote \"easier for you\",\nmeaning they cause less limbic friction\nthan engaging in exercise.\nThe typical advice would be\njust exercise for one minute, okay.\nJust get one minute of\nexercise or five minutes\nand then use the successful completion\nof that one or five minutes as a milestone\nthat allows you to then\nmove to the next milestone.\nAnd indeed, that approach can work.\nAnd it's exactly what I'm describing here\nwhen I say that you're in a\nstate of lack of motivation\nor procrastination or both,\nand you need to put yourself\ninto a more painful,\nnot less painful state.\nSo what do you do?\nYou push up against that friction\nand you exercise for a short while\nand then that pops you out of that trough.\nThat's possible, but for a lot of people,\neven that won't be possible\nbecause they just can't get motivated.\nOr they do that one minute or five minutes\nand then they're just like,\n\"Okay, I'm still in the trough.\nI'm not actually feeling that great.\"\nIn those circumstances, it\nmakes sense to do something\nthat's tangential to the whole path\nthat you're trying to pursue,\nthis goal that you're trying to pursue\nthat is, believe it or not,\nmuch worse than just being amotivated.\nAnd when I say worse, I\ndon't mean picking some task\nthat normally you don't like to do,\nbut now you're willing to do.\nI mean, literally thinking about\nwhat would be worse than\nbeing in this state,\nagain without causing yourself tissue\nor psychological damage,\nwhat would be worse?\nWell, cold water would\nbe worse for many people,\nvery cold water.\nSo the key is to figure\nout something that,\nfor lack of a better way\nto put it really sucks,\nreally sucks, and yet is safe.\nAnd by doing that, you steepen the trough.\nYou steepen the slope of the trough,\nwhich we know brings you\nback to your baseline level\nof dopamine more quickly.\nNow, for some people, that will\nbe deliberate cold exposure\nthrough cold shower ice bath.\nAnd I have to tell you\nthat if you're cringing as I say this,\nwell then there you go.\nYou now have a tool\nthat you know you cringe\neven when you just think about,\nand therefore represents\na great tool for you.\nSo if I'm procrastinating\nto do something I really need to do,\nshould I just simply wait\nfor that procrastination to evaporate?\nNo.\nWill it eventually evaporate?\nMaybe.\nWill a deadline eventually surface\nthat will trigger me into an\nanxious or activated state\nthat will allow me to complete\nwhat needs to be done,\nmaybe, hopefully.\nBut better would be to get\nout of that amotivated state,\nthat state of procrastination quickly.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
