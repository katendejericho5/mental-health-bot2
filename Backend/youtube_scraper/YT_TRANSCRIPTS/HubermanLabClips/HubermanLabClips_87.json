    "transcript": "I love to exercise.\nI know to some people\nthis might seem foreign,\nbut I love to exercise.\nI love to do resistance\ntraining, I love to run.\nI am not one of those people\nthat doesn't like the\nexperience of exercising,\nbut likes the feeling\nafterwards, quote unquote.\nI hear that a lot.\n\"I don't like to exercise,\nbut I love the way I feel afterwards.\"\nI love physical training,\nand I love the way I feel afterwards,\nbut I mostly love the feeling during.\nI don't know why I'm wired that way.\nI can't say that I'm somebody\nwho likes to do hard\nthings across the board.\nThere are plenty of difficult\nthings in life that I dread\nor that I'm sort of meh about,\nbut for me, hard exercise,\nintense exercise of a particular kind.\nResistance training and\nrunning in particular,\nboth give me a yum.\nYes, I love this kind of feeling.\nAnd yes, it persists for me\nquite a long while afterwards,\nboth for sake of the way that\nit changes my neurochemistry,\nbut also, my sense of satisfaction.\nBut I just simply love it.\nNow, years ago, I discovered that\nif I drink a cup of black coffee,\nor an Americano or a double\nespresso, or some yerba mate,\nthat my workouts can be\nquite a bit more intense,\nI can run further.\nAnd then I also discovered that,\nif I were to take a\npre-workout energy drink,\nor I took say 300 milligrams of Alpha GPC\nand 500 milligrams of phenethylamine,\nand perhaps even 500\nmilligrams of L-tyrosine,\nand perhaps did that alongside\nthe caffeine and the yerba\nmate, then yes, absolutely.\nI really liked those workouts.\nI could be like a laser in terms of focus.\nI could exert even more\neffort, put on some music,\nand I could achieve\neven better performance.\nAnd then I also discovered that\nI could export that protocol\nof caffeine, yerba mate,\nand various supplements\nto my cognitive work.\nSo, when I was studying,\nor writing papers,\nor writing grants, or in the laboratory,\nwhen I was doing experiments\nwith my hands in those days,\nyou know, cutting brain\ntissue and staining it\nand working really long hours.\nAnd I discovered that all of those things,\nall of those behaviors compounded\nwith my love of exercise\nand my love of doing science\nand gave me these big peaks\nin what to me felt like\neven important experiences.\nThey felt that, you know,\nunlike anything else.\nThey were just so, so\npeak in their nature,\nwhich was great, and it did\nindeed enhance my performance.\nHowever, while it did\nnot create a dependency\nfor those different substances,\ncaffeine, supplements, et cetera.\nWhat I noticed was that in the days\nand sometimes weekends afterwards,\neven though for much of\nmy career, I confess,\nI've worked weekends as well,\nbut I would notice that I'd experience\na real trough in energy.\nI just would not feel that good.\nAnd then if I kept up those\nbehaviors consistently,\nand I was consistently\nadding in these other,\nlet's just call them what they are,\ndopamine-releasing or stimulating\nbehaviors and substances,\nthat my enthusiasm for\nphysical training, or running,\nor for doing experiments,\nactually started to diminish.\nAnd this was really\ndiscouraging to me at the time,\nbecause I started to think,\nokay, maybe I'm burnt out.\nMaybe I have adrenal burnout,\nwhich by the way, doesn't exist, folks.\nYour adrenals don't burn out.\nThere is something called\nadrenal insufficiency syndrome.\nYou can overstimulate your system\nby way of too much adrenaline,\nepinephrine, and norepinephrine.\nBut that's a separate thing.\nThere's no such thing as\nadrenal burnout per se,\nbut I didn't know that.\nSo I thought, gosh, I'm really burnt out.\nWhen in fact, it's now obvious\nto me what I was doing.\nI was combining too\nmany dopamine-releasing\nor stimulating behaviors and substances\nfor things that I already\nenjoy doing as behaviors,\nnamely exercise and doing experiments.\nAnything related to science actually.\nSo, what this means is\nnot to avoid taking things\nor doing things that amplify\nyour amount of dopamine,\nbut to be very cautious about\nhow often one does that,\nand how many different\ndopamine-stimulating\nbehaviors or compounds, one stacks.\nEspecially, in terms\nof taking those things\nor stacking those things\nin and around behaviors\nthat you already really enjoy doing.\nI was essentially just creating\nanother version of the\nkids in nursery school\nor first grade with the\ngold star experiment.\nI was basically, just\ndoing the exact same thing.\nAnd when I realized that,\nand I changed my relationship\nto those compounds,\nI didn't eliminate them all together.\nBut I started realizing, for instance,\nthat I didn't need to\ndouble up on yerba mate\nand coffee every workout.\nSometimes I would do one,\nsometimes I would do the other.\nFrankly, I always do one or the other.\nIt's rare that I ever do any\nkind of physical training\nwithout some caffeine first.\nAnd I do my physical training,\ntypically in the early part of the day,\nso that's fine, doesn't\ninterfere with my sleep.\nI might do a hike without caffeine,\nbut if I'm in a weight\ntrainer, I'm in a run,\nI tend to drink coffee\nbeforehand or have yerba mate,\nor if I occasionally meaning\nabout once every third,\nsometimes every other,\nbut usually, about every third workout,\nI'll take 300 milligrams of Alpha GPC,\nmaybe occasionally, maybe\nevery third or fourth workout.\nAnd these are resistance workouts.\nMind you, not running,\nI'll take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine\nor more typically, 500\nmilligrams of phenethylamine,\nand very, very rarely, maybe\nonce every two or three months,\nI might stack all of those things together\nprior to a workout.\nBut of course, I'm always\nmindful to also include\nworkouts, or runs, or\nbouts of cognitive work.\nSo, that could be grant writing,\nprepping for a podcast, et cetera,\nwhere I don't do anything prior.\nMaybe just my caffeine,\nbecause I have a baseline\nlevel of caffeine\nthat I use each day to\nfunction like many people.\nThere's a baseline level of\ncaffeine that just allows us\nto function if we're a\nperpetual user of caffeine.\nI talked a lot about this\non the episode in caffeine.\nBut the key here is be cautious.\nI would say be very cautious\nabout stacking and layering in too many\ndopamine peak-inducing behaviors\nall at once on a regular basis.\nThe key point here is,\nif you are somebody that can engage\nin these intrinsically\njoyful activities for you,\nthese activities that you're\nreally motivated to do,\nwhether or not it's skiing,\nor playing music, or dancing, et cetera,\nwithout the need to layer in\nadditional dopamine-releasing mechanisms,\nor compounds, or activities,\nwell then I highly recommend you do that.\nBecause then you are essentially\nmaking yourself one of those fortunate few\nthat does not require additional stimuli\nand therefore can hold onto that pleasure,\ncan hold onto that intrinsic\npleasure and motivation\nto engage in these behaviors over time,\nwhich frankly, there\nis no replacement for.\nThere is no pill, or bottle, or potion,\nor motivational speech,\nor podcast, or book\nthat can replace intrinsic motivation.\nIntrinsic motivation is\nperhaps the holy grail\nof all human endeavors and behaviors,\nbecause it encompasses so much\nof what brought us to this\npoint in our species' evolution,\nand also, what brings\neach and every one of us\ncloser and closer to our goals.\nAnd if it's happening with enjoyment\nwithout the need to layer\nin additional tools,\nwell then you have really\ntapped into the source.\nAnd when I say the source,\nI don't mean it in any\nkind of mystical way.\nI think it's quite clear by now\nthat when we hear about\nqi from Eastern medicine\nor we talk about motivation\ndrive and pursuit\non Western neurobiological languages\nthat relates to dopamine,\nor we hear about the source\nmaybe in my podcast episode\nwith the one and only Rick Rubin,\nincredibly productive music producer,\nwho's as just an unbelievable track record\nin terms of creative endeavors.\nAnd he talks about the source.\nWe're really talking about the same thing,\nwhich is this set of circuits within us\nthat allow us to identify what we want\nand then lean into effort,\nand then to do that in a persistent way\nthat allows us to reach our goals.\nAnd if we can do that with an\nintrinsic sense of pleasure,\nwell, that is nothing short of magic.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
