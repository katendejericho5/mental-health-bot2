    "transcript": "If we are going to feel motivated at all,\nthat is, if we are going\nto wake up in the morning\nor have any period of time during our day\nin which we feel like we are\ncapable of pursuing goals,\nwe are going to have\nto have a healthy level\nof baseline dopamine.\nIn other words, we are\ngoing to have to have\nenough dopamine in the wave pool,\nenough water in the wave pool, that is,\nbefore we can generate any\nwaves or peaks in dopamine,\nlet alone troughs and the rest.\nSo how do we achieve a healthy\nbaseline level of dopamine?\nWell, there we can really look\nto some foundational practices,\npractices that perhaps you've heard about\non this podcast before,\nand that to some of you\nmight seem a little mundane,\nalthough some of them are\na bit more sophisticated,\nmaybe even esoteric.\nThe good news is that we can\nall control these things,\nand they don't require\npurchasing anything,\nbut they do require some degree\nof regular upkeep and effort.\nThose things include what\nI call the very basics.\nNow, the very basics,\nput in the context of today's discussion,\nare the things that put\nwater in the wave pool.\nThose are going to be\ngetting sufficient amounts\nof quality sleep each night,\nsomething that we've\ndone several episodes on,\nand then have online toolkits for us.\nYou can see the \"Master\nYour Sleep\" episode,\nthe \"Perfect Your Sleep\" episode,\nthe \"Light and Health\" episode.\nIf you want to skip all that\nand just get right to the tools,\nwe have a sleep toolkit,\nor it's actually called\nthe Toolkit for Sleep,\nthat you can access at hubermanlab.com.\nCompletely zero cost.\nYou just go there and\ndownload that toolkit.\nGetting sufficient sleep each night\nliterally restores your dopamine reserves.\nIt allows dopamine to be present\nand for you to have a\nlevel of baseline dopamine\nthat will allow you to\neven consider your goals\nin any kind of meaningful\nor reasonable way.\nSecond, there are practices\nthat are supported\nby the scientific literature\nto increase your baseline\nlevel of dopamine\nthat are independent of sleep\nbut are similar to sleep.\nAnd I like to refer to these\nas non-sleep deep rest.\nThis is not meditation.\nThere's actually very little evidence\nthat meditation of the\ntraditional kind of,\nyou know, sitting, eyes closed,\nfocusing on your a third eye center,\nwhich is this area behind your forehead.\nThere is very little evidence\nthat that increases levels of dopamine.\nThere is a place for meditation\nin the context of today's discussion.\nBut I'll repeat.\nMeditation itself is a focusing exercise.\nIt is not known to increase dopamine.\nHowever, non-sleep deep rest,\nso-called NSDR, very similar,\nalthough different to what's\nsometimes called yoga nidra,\nwhich is where you lie there,\nyou do a sort of body scan,\nsome long exhale breathing.\nNSDR is very similar.\nYou can find a link to a\nzero-cost NSDR on YouTube.\nIt's a 10-minute-long one.\nThere are also 20 and\n30-minute ones out there\nalso on YouTube,\nbut I'll provide a link\nto the 10-minute one.\nThose have been shown to\nincrease the amount of dopamine\nin your dopamine reserves by up to 65%,\nwhich is a remarkable number.\nSo quality sleep, non-sleep\ndeep rest, aka yoga nidra,\nvery powerful ways to keep\nyour baseline level of dopamine\nat a sufficient level.\nIn addition to that,\nnutrition, no doubt, plays a role\nin your baseline level of dopamine\nbecause tyrosine, the amino acid,\nis the rate-limiting enzyme\nfor the synthesis of dopamine.\nTyrosine is present in varying\nlevels in different foods.\nYou can look those up online.\nYou just simply put in a search\nfor tyrosine levels in different foods.\nEverything from particular cheeses,\nlike, Parmesan cheese has\nhigh levels of tyrosine,\ncertain meats, certain\nnuts, certain vegetables.\nWithout getting into\ndetails and specifics,\nyou can find those there.\nBut you need proper nutrition\nand, therefore, nutrients,\nin particular tyrosine,\nin order to have sufficient\nlevels of baseline dopamine.\nThe third thing on the list,\nand again, these are\nthings that we come back to\nalmost every episode,\nbut I don't think they\ncan be repeated enough\nbecause these are really\nthings that we need to focus on\nevery 24 hours.\nYou might be able to\nskip a day here or there\nif you get sick or you're traveling,\nor you have some major life event.\nBut really every 24 hours,\nwe need to re-up our sleep.\nWe need to re-up our nutrients.\nEven if you're fasting, you're\nre-upping your nutrients\nfrom stored sources within your body.\nThe third thing is sunlight.\nMorning sunlight in particular.\nI've done extensive episodes about this.\nCheck out the episode on\n\"Lighting your Health\"\nif you want all the details.\nBut you want to try and view sunlight\nas early in the day as possible,\nfive to 10 minutes on\na clear day, minimum,\n10 to 20 minutes on a cloudy day, minimum,\n20 or 30 minutes on a very\novercast day, minimum.\nWithout sunglasses,\ndon't stare at the sun.\nPlease don't damage your eyes.\nLook off slightly off from the sun.\nBut yes, you want to face\nthe eastward towards the sun.\nAnd on those cloudy days, that's\nespecially important to do.\nWhy?\nWell, viewing morning\nsunlight increases cortisol\nearly in the day, which is excellent\nbecause you want cortisol\nelevated early in the day,\nand you want it lower later in the day.\nAnd because of the relationship\nbetween the cells in your\neye that sense sunlight,\nspecifically morning sunlight,\nbelieve it or not, that happens,\nand signal to your hypothalamus\nand the relationship\nbetween the hypothalamus\nand the pituitary and\nother endocrine organs,\nit sets in motion a\ndopamine-related cascade\nin neuromodulators, dopamine,\nand hormones that lead\nto states of wellbeing,\nelevated mood, alertness,\netc., throughout the day.\nIt also helps your sleep at night.\nBut today we're talking about dopamine.\nSo yes, believe it or not,\nthat morning sunlight exposure\ndoes increase your levels of\ndopamine, not just cortisol.\nAnd fourth on the list\nis going to be movement,\nexercise of varying kinds.\nIt could be resistance training.\nIt could be cardiovascular training.\nThat does increase levels of dopamine.\nHere we're not talking about\nachieving peaks in dopamine.\nThat could be accomplished\nthrough setting a personal record, a PR,\nor through sprints or heavy lifts\nor learning some new dynamic movement.\nWhat we're really talking about here\nis getting into a regular\nexercise program of,\nif not every day, at\nleast five days a week,\na mixture of cardiovascular\nand resistance exercise,\nthat we also know is known\nto elevate and maintain\nan elevated level of baseline dopamine.\nSo it's not just about\nthe euphoria you feel\nduring or after exercise.\nIt's also about the\nbaseline level of dopamine\nthat's achieved through regular movement\nand engaging in movement.\nAnd if you're asking, \"How could that be?\"\nWell, you already know the answer.\nThe circuits in the brain and\nbody that generate movement,\nnot just goal seeking,\nbut movement itself,\nas I mentioned earlier,\nthat nigrostriatal pathway.\nAnd yes, that circuit is separate\nfrom the VTA nucleus\naccumbens to cortical circuit,\nthe mesocortical circuit\nthat we've mainly been focusing on today,\nbut they interact.\nAnd so by engaging in regular movement,\nyou ensure that you're\nmaintaining elevated levels\nof baseline dopamine,\nwhich is what you want\nif you're going to be able to engage\nin any kind of motivated\npursuit behavior of any kind.\nSo those are the fundamentals\nthat will set the level of\nbaseline dopamine in your system.\nA couple of key points.\nYes, there is variation\nbased on both genetics and circumstance\nin baseline levels of dopamine.\nIf someone's going through\na particularly hard time,\nor if somebody inherited a gene\nin the dopamine synthesis pathway\nthat simply affords them higher\nlevels of baseline dopamine,\nwe likely know these people.\nThey seem hyper motivated all the time,\nnot just based on prior success,\nbut they just seem to have a lot of energy\nand a lot of go drive.\nYou know, you talk\nabout activation energy,\nsome of you may know what that term means.\nOthers of you won't.\nHaving low activation energy is great.\nI mean, the amount of energy that it takes\nto get into action to pursue\nadaptive and meaningful, healthy goals.\nSome people just seem to\nhave lower activation energy,\nand higher levels of dopamine\nare probably associated with that.\nSome of us have lower\nlevels of baseline dopamine.\nRegardless, everyone needs to engage\nin the foundational things\nthat I just mentioned a few moments ago,\nevery 24 hours, or at least strive to.\nThere is no escaping that.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
