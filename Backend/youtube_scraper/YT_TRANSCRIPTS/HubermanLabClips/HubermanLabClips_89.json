    "transcript": "Let's think about dopamine peaks\nand baselines.\nLet's remember that for every peak,\nthere's a trough.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, when you have a wave,\nyou also have the bottom of the wave.\nWhen you have a mountain,\nyou have the bottom of the mountain.\nWhen we think about dopamine peaks\nand dopamine baselines,\nwe have to include that trough\nbecause that trough,\nthat is the level\nof dopamine below baseline,\nreally dictates whether\nor not you are going\nto feel motivated\nto pursue something or not.\nI'm going to give you\na visual in your mind.\nThe visual in your mind is\nan increase in dopamine that's triggered\nby your desire for something,\nand really could be\nyour desire for anything.\nIf you're hungry\nand you're thinking about,\n\"I really want a sandwich,\nI really want a...\"\nLet's think, what sandwich\nwould I want right now?\nA really nice roast beef sandwich\non sourdough with a slice of Swiss,\ntomatoes, slice of pickle.\nHere I'm describing\nthe sandwich that I would want.\nIf you're hungry and you're thinking\nabout that, dopamine starts rising.\nThis is crucially important to understand.\nDopamine is not just released\nwhen we get the reward,\nwhen we get the thing that we're pursuing.\nDopamine is released\nin anticipation of what we want.\nThat increase in dopamine is\nby no happenstance, no mistake,\nrelates also to our propensity\nand desire to move.\nRemember earlier I told you there's\na separate circuit of dopamine\nthat triggers movement and that when it's\ndepleted is causing things like deficits\nin movement related to Parkinson's\nor other movement disorders?\nWell, that's not pure coincidence.\nThat's because desire and the need to move\nin order to pursue and reach goals\nare one in the same process.\nIf I desire a sandwich\nor I desire a cup of coffee\nor I desire some water when I'm thirsty,\nthere's an increase in dopamine that we\ncould call a little mini-peak in dopamine.\nBut then here's the key thing.\nVery soon after I realize\nmy desire for something,\nthat peak that was caused by the desire\ncomes down and drops below baseline,\nbelow the level of dopamine that it was\nprior to even thinking about the sandwich\nor the coffee or the glass of water.\nIt's that drop below baseline\nthat triggers my desire to go out\nand find that sandwich,\nthat coffee, that water, or that blank.\nInsert whatever it is\nthat you happen to desire,\naction or substance\nof any kind or person, et cetera.\nThat drop below baseline is fundamental\nto the whole process,\nand that drop below baseline\nwas triggered by the preceding peak.\nLet's say that I desire a sandwich,\nthere's an increase in dopamine,\nthen very quickly it comes down\nbelow baseline just a little bit,\nnow I'm in pursuit of the sandwich.\nI'm looking for where\nI can get that sandwich.\nI can order it, perhaps, to be delivered.\nI can go out and find it.\nNow is the stage in which I have to think\nabout what are the different stimuli,\nthat is the things in my environment\nthat signal whether or not\nI'm likely to get that sandwich or not.\nFor instance, if I were to go to my phone\nand order food on an app,\nor walk down the street\nand see the sign for a Deli,\nthat's a cue that I'm likely\nto relieve that drop in dopamine\nand get not just back to baseline,\nbut then I'll get a peak in dopamine.\nIndeed, that's what happens.\nIf I find that Deli,\nI go into the Deli, they're open,\nthey're making the sandwich that I want,\nthey make my sandwich,\nand great, I get that sandwich.\nThat sandwich will have some degree\nof inherent reward to it,\nsome degree of my liking it\nor not liking it.\nLet's say I like it.\nIt's not the best sandwich I've ever had,\nbut all I'm doing is comparing my desire\nfor that sandwich to the sandwich\nthat I actually got and ate.\nChances are it's going\nto relieve that craving,\nmeaning it will take that dopamine\nthat had fallen below baseline,\nup, up back to baseline,\nand if I like the sandwich,\nit's going to indeed increase\nthat dopamine again to another peak.\nNow, if I love the sandwich,\nlike it's the most delicious thing\nthat I've ever tasted in my entire life,\nwell, then I'll get a big peak\nin dopamine when I consume that reward.\nHowever, chances are that the sandwich is\nmore or less as I expect it to be,\nwhich is pretty good.\nI'll eat it and I'm fine.\nWhat do I mean by fine?\nWell, there's a concept\ncalled reward-prediction error.\nReward-prediction error says\nthat the dopamine that it has experienced,\nthat is, that's released from the VTA\nand nucleus accumbens,\nis going to be of a certain value.\nThat value is going to be compared\nto the desire and expectation\nof what I thought I was going to get.\nIf you take what you actually got\nminus what you expected,\nthat's reward-prediction error.\nIf the sandwich is basically\nwhat I expected to get, fine,\ndopamine comes down basically\nto a baseline level\nthat's pretty standard for me\nand is basically the baseline level\nI had before I ever thought\nabout the sandwich at all.\nIf the sandwich completely surprises me\nand is completely amazing,\njust an amazing sandwich, well,\nthen the level of dopamine\nthat I experience when I consume\nthat sandwich is going to be even greater,\nand it's going to be\nthat minus what I expected.\nThere it's a bigger\nreward-prediction error\nin the direction of higher peak\nby consuming the sandwich.\nThen, of course,\nthere's the other possibility,\nwhich is the Deli is closed\nor the sandwich they make me is lousy\nor doesn't taste good,\nor something happened\nin the consuming of that sandwich\nthat just makes it a bad experience.\nIn which case, if we take\nthat reward-experienced\nminus reward-predicted\nfrom the initial craving,\nwell, then it's going to be\nless than what I expected,\nand therefore the baseline drops\nbelow where it was\nprior to even desiring the sandwich.\nAll of this might seem\na little bit complicated,\nbut it's all very simple.\nDesire for things increases dopamine,\nbut then our level\nof dopamine drops below baseline,\nand it's that drop below baseline\nthat triggers the motivation\nto bring that dopamine level back up\nby going and pursuing the thing\nthat you wanted in the first place.\nNow, of course, as this is happening,\nyou're not conscious\nof your dopamine levels.\nYou experience this\nas context-dependent craving and pursuit.\nBecause remember, the prefrontal cortex\nis involved in context setting\nand craving and pursuit\nbecause it relates to action and movement,\nwhich is one of the general features\nof the dopamine system.\nYou can start to see how this is\na beautifully designed system.\nYou can also see how it's a perfect system\nfor desire and pursuit of anything,\nnot just sandwiches, as I'm giving you\nin this somewhat trivial,\nbut everyday and therefore,\napplicable example.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
