    "transcript": "Let's talk about tap water.\nAnd here I have to take a\ndeep breath, not a deep gulp,\nbut a deep breath because\nin researching tap water\nand what's contained in tap\nwater in different regions,\nnot just in the US but around the world,\nI confess the picture\nis a pretty scary one.\nI want to be clear, I'm not\nsomebody who naturally orients\ntowards fear or conspiracy theories.\nHowever, in researching\ntap water for this episode\nby way of looking at the\npeer-reviewed research,\nmeta-analysis, reviews,\nspecific research articles\nwhere specific hypotheses were tested,\nand in talking with experts\nin toxicology and so on,\nit's a pretty grim picture, frankly,\nwhen one looks at what's contained\nin most tap water and\nwhether or not the compounds\nthat are contained in\ntap water are present\nin sufficient concentrations\nto negatively impact our health.\nAnd the bad news is that\nmuch, if not all tap water,\nbelieve it or not,\nmuch if not all tap water contains things\nthat are bad for the biology of our cells.\nThere is a silver lining, however,\nand the silver lining is\nthat very simple steps\nthat are very inexpensive can be used\nto adjust that tap water to\nmake it not just safe to drink,\nbut that makes it perfectly fine to drink.\nSo that's the good news, and\nwe'll get to that in a moment.\nIf you are somebody who is interested\nin whether or not tap\nwater contains things\nlike endocrine disruptors,\nhormone disruptors\nthat can negatively impact\nreproductive health in males\nor females or both,\nthere's a wonderful review,\nwonderful because it's so thorough.\nAlthough the news isn't\ngreat, it's very thorough,\nwhich is great, which is\nentitled \"Endocrine Disruptors\nin Water and Their Effects\non the Reproductive System\".\nThis is a review from 2020\nthat analyzes water from a\nbunch of different sources\nwithin the world and essentially focuses\non a few key components.\nFirst of all, it focuses\non the concentration\nof minerals that is magnesium\nand calcium within water.\nMany people don't realize\nthis, but so-called hard water.\nSounds terrible, right?\nBut hard water is water that\ncontains magnesium and calcium,\nwhich turns out to be a good thing.\nSome water contains more\nmagnesium and calcium.\nOther water contains less.\nThey looked at the presence of magnesium\nand calcium because that is\ngoing to impact the pH of water.\nIn general, the higher concentrations\nof magnesium and calcium in\nwater, the higher the pH.\nThat is, the more alkaline that water is.\nAnd the lower levels of\nmagnesium and calcium,\nthe more acidic or lower\npH that water tends to be.\nThe other thing that this review addresses\nis the concentration of so-called DBPs,\ndog bulldog porcupines, DBPs,\nwhich are disinfection\nbyproducts contained in water.\nSo obviously, local governments,\nthe government wants your\ndrinking water to be clean.\nThey don't want contaminants in it.\nThey don't want sewage in that water.\nThey don't want chemical contaminants\nthat are going to make\npeople immediately sick,\nso they treat water.\nWater treatment plants treat water\nwith disinfection products\nand those disinfection\nproducts create things\ncalled disinfection byproducts.\nAnd the presence of those DBPs\nor disinfectant byproducts\ncan strongly impact the pH\nof water by way of\nchanging the concentrations\nof magnesium and calcium.\nPut differently, I do believe\nthat governments are trying\nto provide people with clean water,\nbut in doing so, oftentimes,\nwe'll introduce things\nto that water that are not good for us.\nNow, it's very clear\nthat DBPs can cause endocrine disruption\nin ways that are not good\nfor reproductive health.\nI did a very long, in fact,\nfour and a half hour episode\non fertility and vitality.\nThat was male and female\nfertility, by the way,\nand vitality.\nThat, again, you can\nfind at hubermanlab.com\nthat talks about all the\nbiological processes involved\nin the generation of\nhealthy eggs and sperm\nand creating a healthy\nembryos, implantation embryos,\nand so forth.\nIt's very clear\nthat DBPs have been shown\nto disrupt ovarian function,\nspermatogenesis, and fertility outcomes,\neven at concentrations\nof DBPs that are present\nin drinking water that comes from the tap.\nNow, does that mean that you\nshouldn't drink tap water?\nWell, the answer to that is a it depends.\nWhat does it depend on?\nWell, it depends on several things.\nFirst of all, I highly recommend\nthat everybody go online\nand put in your ZIP code\nand ask for a water analysis\nof water that comes out of\nthe tap in that ZIP code.\nThis is something that is\nreadily available online,\nat least to my knowledge.\nAnd unfortunately, there's\nno specific one site\nthat I can send everyone to\nto get an in-depth analysis\nof the drinking water\nthat comes out of your tap.\nHowever, I highly recommend\nthat you go online\nand put in your ZIP code\nor municipal area code\nand figure out whether or not\nyour water contains X amount\nof DBPs or Y amount of DBPs.\nNow, of course, you're going\nto get a bunch of values back\nand unless you're a toxicologist,\nprobably not going to know\nwhat those values mean.\nBut what you're really looking\nfor is whether or not there are high,\nlow, or moderate levels of\nfluoride in that drinking water.\nWhy do I say that?\nWell, there are studies that show\nthat the concentration of fluoride\nin drinking water is of particular concern\nfor the thyroid hormone\nsystem of the body.\nNow, thyroid hormone has\na lot of different roles\nin brain and body, and thyroid\nhormone is very important\nfor everything from metabolism\nto levels of energy.\nWhen thyroid levels are disrupted\nor if thyroid receptors are disrupted,\nit can lead to depression.\nWhen thyroid hormones are optimized,\nit can lead to optimal mood,\nif there is such a thing.\nBut in other words, it helps\nkeep your mood elevated.\nIt relates to everything\nfrom sleep to reproduction.\nThyroid hormone is involved in many,\nmany things including bone health\nand tissue health generally.\nSo essentially every biological process\nin your body is impacted\nby thyroid hormone.\nAnd there's a study that\nI'd like to highlight\nwhich was published in 2018\nand the title of the study is\n\"Impact of Drinking Water Fluoride\non Human Thyroid Hormones\".\nThis was a case control study\nso this is not an extensive\nanalysis of many individuals.\nHowever, what it shows is\nthat fluoride negatively impacts\nthyroid stimulating hormone\nand so-called T3 levels.\nSo you have thyroid hormone T3 and T4.\nEven in the standard\nconcentrations that are present of,\nand here's an important number,\n0.5 milligrams per liter, okay?\nSo if you can get a hold\nof the fluoride concentrations\nin your tap water\nand find out whether or\nnot the concentrations are\nat, below, or exceed 0.5\nmilligrams per liter,\nwhat you'll find is\nthat even just 0.5 milligrams per liter\nof water can disrupt thyroid function\nand this is going to\nbe a particular concern\nfor people to have familial,\nso genetically related thyroid\nissues, or that are concerned\nwith keeping your thyroid\nhormone levels healthy,\nwhich I think is everybody.\nSo I am telling you that you\nshould try and get a hold\nof some data about the water\nthat comes out of your tap\nif you intend on drinking\ntap water, and probably even\nif you don't, just know\nwhat's in your drinking water.\nYour local government should\nprovide that information\nand/or it should be\nreadily available online.\nAnd in particular, I think it's worthwhile\nto address how much fluoride is present\nin your drinking water.\nAgain, I don't want to\ncreate a lot of scare.\nI'm not trying to trigger fear here.\nI do think, however, by\nway of reading this review,\nby way of reading the\npaper that I just referred\nto a moment ago,\nagain, links to these\nare going to be provided\nin the show note captions,\nthat there is extensive\nevidence that elevated levels\nof fluoride in drinking water\nare simply not good for us.\nNow, that could open a whole\ndiscussion of why fluoride is\nin our drinking water in\nthe first place at all.\nBut leaving that aside, it seems to me\nthat most everybody should\nknow how much fluoride is\nin their drinking water.\nAnd ideally everybody,\nyes, everybody is filtering\ntheir drinking water.\nNow, that raises the question\nof how best to filter drinking water.\nAnd that brings an answer\nof it depends on a couple of things.\nFirst of all, how healthy\nor unhealthy do you know yourself to be?\nOkay, so if you're somebody\nwho has no health issues,\nyou have plenty of vigor,\nyou're sleeping well at night,\nyou have no autoimmune disease,\nyou're not aware of any health\nconcern, minor or major,\nwell then, perhaps you're somebody\nthat doesn't want to filter your water.\nI would argue that why wouldn't\nyou employ some very low\nor even zero-cost approach\nto filtering your water?\nThere are going to be other individuals\nwho are suffering\nparticular ailments of brain\nor body or both\nthat absolutely should be\nfiltering their drinking water\nif they're getting their\ndrinking water from their tap\nbecause it is pretty well established now\nthat tap water contains a lot\nof these disinfectant byproducts\nas well as, in most cases,\nexceeding the threshold of fluoride\nthat we know to be healthy for us.\nHow should you filter your tap water?\nWell, you have everything ranging\nfrom the so-called Brita type filters.\nThese are going to be carbon type filters\nor other filters that you\nessentially put over a container\nor a compartment where\nyou can pour the water\nover it and it goes into\nthe compartment below.\nWill those work?\nAre they sufficient to filter\nout the disinfectant byproducts?\nThe general answer is yes,\nprovided you change the\nfilters often enough.\nHowever, it is not thought, unfortunately,\nnot thought that they filter\nout sufficient fluoride.\nSo what I highly recommend is depending\non your budget that you\ngo online and you search\nfor at-home water filters\nthat can filter out fluoride.\nThere are a number of straightforward\nand inexpensive tools to do that.\nAnd here I don't have any relationship\nto any of the water filters\nor things that I'm going to mention now.\nI want to be very clear about that.\nThere's no brand coder affiliation here.\nI'm simply trying to direct you\nto resources that will allow\nyou to filter your tap water\nfor it to be more safe for you to consume\nin a way that meets your budget\nwith the understanding\nthat people have very\ndifferent disposable incomes.\nSo the range of costs here is\ngoing to be pretty tremendous.\nI just want to get that\nout of the way first.\nYou know, there are water filters\nthat you can use repeatedly.\nSo these are what I'll refer to\nas pitcher filters that\nare less than $100.\nNow, keep in mind that\nthat's a one-time purchase,\nexcept for the replacement of the filters,\nwhich fortunately, doesn't\nhave to be done too often.\nSo there are different filters.\nI'll provide a link to one that I found\nthat is, at least by my read,\nof the lowest possible cost.\nSo this is the so-called\nClearly Filtered water pitcher\nwith Affinity filtration.\nSo this is a filter\nthat can adequately remove fluoride,\nlead, BPAs, glyphosates, hormones,\nand some of the other harmful things\nthat are contained in most tap water.\nAgain, I do realize that for some people,\neven an 80 US dollar cost\nis going to be prohibitive.\nBut do realize that\nwhat you're doing here is\nyou're purchasing a unit\nthat can be used repeatedly over and over.\nThe reason why it's lower cost than some\nof the different filtration approaches\nthat I'll talk about in a moment are\nthat you can't really put\nall the drinking water\nthat you would use,\nsay, for an entire week\nor for an entire month in one pitcher.\nYou're going to have to\nrepeatedly pour water\ninto the pitcher in order to filter it.\nNow, as I mentioned before,\nthe range on water filter costs\nfor filters that can\nadequately remove fluoride\nand all the other things that you want\nout of your top water is immense.\nIn fact, you can find, you know,\nwhole house water filters that are,\nyou know, $2,000 or more.\nAgain, these are going to be filters\nthat are going to be in your garage\nor in a laundry room\nthat are going to basically pull\nfrom the piping system of your house\nand deliver purified water.\nTechnically, it's not purified,\nbut that's removing these contaminants\nand fluoride from all\nthe sinks in your house.\nSo you could effectively drink\nfrom any or all sinks in your house.\nThat's what explains the higher cost.\nI think most people are probably not going\nto have the disposable income\nor have the opportunity to include one\nof these whole house filters.\nAlthough if you do have the means\nand it's important to\nyou, you could do that.\nAnd then there are going\nto be what I would call\nintermediate systems.\nSo systems that cost somewhere\nbetween 200 and $500.\nProbably one of the more common ones\nor popular ones is a so-called\nBerkey filter system.\nThese are filter systems that,\nagain, remove the things\nthat you want removed\nfrom your tap water\nand they can do it at higher volumes.\nAnd they're typically countertop units.\nThey don't require any plugin, typically,\nor they only require brief\nplugin and electricity\nand they're going to filter\nout many, many liters\nor tens of liters of water\nso that you can always have access\nto that clean filtered\nwater anytime or day\nor night without having to\npour over into the pitcher.\nSo I mention these different options\nbecause again, I realize that\npeople have different levels\nof disposable income.\nAs far as I know,\nthere's no tablet or simple\nmechanism that can be purchased\nas a transportable, you know,\npill that you can just\nsimply throw in water\nand remove the contaminants.\nIf anyone is aware of one\nthat can adequately remove\nfluoride and other contaminants,\nplease put in the comment\nsection on YouTube.\nThat'd be the best place\nso that I and everyone else can see it.\nBut hopefully the mention\nof the different filtration systems\nthat I mentioned will\ngive you some choices\nthat I would hope would\nfall within the range\nthat one could potentially afford.\nAn important note about\nfiltration, just as in our body,\nthere are mechanisms to\nsignal mechanical changes\nand chemical changes that\noccur in our gut and our brain,\net cetera, elsewhere.\nAnd in general, both mechanical\nand chemical changes are signaled\nacross the body to\ninvoke different changes\nwhether or not those are, you know,\na response of the immune system\nor to make us more alert\nor more asleep, et cetera.\nSo too filtration capitalizes\non mechanical and chemical filtration.\nWhat I mean by that is\nwhen you run a fluid,\nwater or any other fluid through a filter,\nthose filters are doing two things.\nThey are physically constraining\nwhich molecules can go\nthrough by creating portals,\npores that allow certain\nsize molecules to go through\nand not others.\nAnd almost always,\nthey contain certain\nchemicals themselves, right?\nThose filters have been\ntreated with certain chemicals\nthat neutralize certain\nother chemicals, okay?\nSo you may be wondering\nhow when you filter water,\nyou know, magnesium and\ncalcium can get through\nbut fluoride doesn't.\nAnd that's because these filters\nhave been very cleverly designed\nin order to neutralize fluoride\nor to prevent large molecules\nsuch as sediment and dirt,\nwhich is kind of easy to\nimagine being filtered,\nbut also to allow certain\nsmall molecules like calcium,\nwhich is small-ish, or\nmagnesium, which is small-ish,\nto still pass through\ninto our drinking water.\nAnd this is wonderful\nbecause what it means is that\nby filtering our water\nusing any of the methods\nthat we talked about before,\nyou're still going to\nget whatever magnesium\nand calcium was present in that water\nwhile still adequately\nremoving the fluoride\nand other disinfectant byproducts.\nNow, what if you can't\nafford any of those options?\nOkay, well,\nhere you have an interesting\nzero-cost option.\nIt's not as good as the other\nones at filtering that water\nbut it is an option\nand I do think it's\nimportant to give options\nto people who don't have\nany disposable income\nfor the purpose of filtering their water,\nwhich is to draw a gallon or five gallons\nor maybe even more tap\nwater out of the tap\nand put it into some\ncontainer, some vessel.\nSo it could be one gallon, five\ngallon, 10 gallon container\nand then to let that tap water sit\nfor some period of time\nto allow some of the sediment\nto drop to the bottom.\nNow you might say, well,\nthere's no sediment.\nThere's nothing contained\nin that tap water\nand isn't fluoride diluted in the water?\nAnd indeed, the answer to that is yes.\nHowever, there is some evidence\nthat letting tap water sit\nout at room temperature\nand outside the pipes that deliver\nthat water can help remove some,\nnot all of the contaminants in that water.\nIf however, you are\nfiltering the water using any\nof the methods that I talked\nabout a few moments ago,\nyou do not need to do this, okay?\nI realize there's a whole world out there\nof people who insist\non putting their water\nin the sun or only keeping\nit in certain containers\nand putting it out for a few\ndays before they ingest it.\nThat, to me, seems a bit extreme.\nIf you want to do that, be my guest.\nBut I don't think most\npeople need to do that.\nHowever, I do believe that\nfor people who have zero\ndisposable income to devote\nto paying for any kind\nof filtration system\nfor their tap water, that\ntaking that tap water\nand putting it into some\ncontainer at room temperature\nand keeping it room\ntemperature for a half day\nor a day or more, and then\npouring off the top two thirds\nof that water into another\ncontainer and consuming the water\nfrom that second container\nis going to remove some,\nnot all of the contaminants\nthat one would need to be concerned about.\nAnd here I should mention something\nthat I neglected to\nmention a few moments ago.\nIf you're going to do\nthis zero-cost option\nand let the water sit out for a bit,\nyou would want that water to sit uncapped.\nSorry, I should have\nmentioned that before.\nUncapped, of course, trying to keep things\nfrom falling into that water.\nIn fact, you could even put a\nlittle bit of cloth above it.\nSo you don't want things\nfalling into that water\nbut you want certain things\nto be able to evaporate off.\nAnd you also want some of\nthe sediment to drop down.\nAnd the reason why this process\nof letting water sit\nout would work at all is\nbecause many of the contaminants contained\nwithin water are not present\nbecause of the source\nof that water or even the\ntreatment of that water\nbut rather because of the\npipes that that water arrives\nto your glass or the pot\nthat you have from, okay?\nAnd here again, there is an\ninfinite number of variables.\nSo some people are living\nin buildings for which the pipes are very,\nvery old, but very, very\nclean, believe it or not.\nSome people are living in newer buildings\nand structures that have new\npipes, but for which the seals\nbetween those pipes contain\nthings that are not good\nfor you to consume.\nSo by letting water sit out for a while,\nyou are able to remove some\nof the contaminants present\nwithin the pipes of your\nhome and the building\nand even the pipes that lead\nto your home or apartment.\nNow, some people get really obsessed\nwith this whole tap water thing\nand really want to find\nout all the details\nabout the pipes and\nwhat sorts of, you know\nhard metals and how much magnesium\nand how much calcium are\npresent in their water.\nThere are ways that you can\ntest your drinking water\nfor those sorts of things.\nMost people, I realize, including myself,\nare simply not going to do that.\nIf you want to know what I do,\nI tend to drink water that is filtered\nthrough one of these lower cost filters.\nOr if I'm going to be\nconsuming a lot of fluid,\nI will drink certain kinds of fluid\nthat later I'll tell you,\nI've been doing an experiment\nfor the sake of this episode looking\nat so-called molecular hydrogen water,\nwhich sounds very fancy and esoteric\nand almost a little wacky,\nbut it turns out has largely to do\nwith the amount of magnesium and calcium\nand the pH of that water.\nSo if you are somebody\nwho has a very low budget\nor simply just wants to\nspend a very small amount\nof money and try and\nstill drink tap water,\nthere is absolutely a\nway to do that safely.\nBut it does require a few of these steps.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
