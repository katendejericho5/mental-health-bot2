    "transcript": "You need about eight ounces\nor 240 milliliters of fluid\nper hour for the first 10\nhours of your day after waking.\nNow, why did I say for the first 10 hours?\nWell, it turns out that the filtration\nof fluids from your body, which\nis accomplished, of course,\nby your kidneys, and\nby way of your bladder,\nand the excretion of fluid out\nurethra, so-called urination,\nis strongly, strongly circadian dependent,\nmeaning the cells of your kidney,\nand the cells even of your gut,\nin fact, all the cells of your body,\nbut especially the cells of your kidney,\nwhich filter the fluid\nthat comes into your body,\nand that make certain\nhormones like vasopressin,\nwhich is antidiuretic hormone,\nall of that functioning of the kidney\nis under strong regulation\nby so-called circadian clock genes.\nCircadian clock genes are\ngenes that are expressed\nin every cell, but that in\ncertain cells of the body,\nvery strongly impact\nwhether or not that organ,\nin this case, the kidney,\nis going to be activated,\nmeaning functioning at a very high level,\nor at a reduced level.\nAnd we can make all\nof this very simple by simply\nstating what's contained\nin this beautiful review\nthat I'll provide a link to\nif you want to learn more,\ncalled \"Circadian Rhythms in the Kidney.\"\nAnd basically what is known\nis that for the first\n10 hours after waking,\nyour kidney is filtering fluid\nwithin your body at a very rapid rate.\nThere are a number of different\ncell types that do that,\nbut they are basically taking that fluid,\npulling out any contaminants,\nusing hormones such as\nantidiuretic hormone, vasopressin,\nto adjust whether or not\nyou're going to hold onto fluid\nor release more fluid from your body\nin the form of urine, depending\non the salt concentration,\ndepending on how much fluid\nyou need, your work output,\nthe conditions you're in, all of that.\nHowever, at about 10 hours after waking,\nyour kidney really starts to reduce\nits overall level of functioning.\nNow, that doesn't mean that your kidney\ncannot filter fluid 11 or\n12 or 16 hours after waking,\nbut it becomes far less\nefficient at doing so.\nAnd thank goodness it does,\nbecause you do not want\nyour kidney filtering fluid\nat the same rate at midnight,\nassuming you wake up at say,\nseven or eight or 9:00 AM,\nthat it was filtering fluid at 10:00 AM.\nIn fact, we can say that if you want\nto reduce your nighttime\nwaking in order to urinate,\nwhich is a common, common\nquestion and concern\nthat many people have,\nhow can I avoid waking up\nin the middle of the night to urinate?\nAnd there I say it's perfectly\nnormal to wake up once,\nmaybe twice each night to urinate.\nBut if you want to reduce\nthe number of times\nthat you wake up in order\nto urinate across the night,\nmaybe even make that number zero times,\nyou will greatly benefit\nby doing three things.\nFirst of all, make sure that\nyou're hydrating sufficiently\nduring the daytime.\nThat will ensure that you\nare not excessively thirsty\nin the evening, and therefore,\nconsuming a lot more fluid.\nSecond, and related to that first point,\nis that you do want to reduce\nyour fluid intake at night,\nprovided you hydrated\nsufficiently throughout the day.\nAnd believe it or not, the\nrate at which fluid moves\nfrom your gut and into the\ncells and tissues of your body,\nand then from your bladder\ninto urine is determined\nnot just by the volume\nof fluid you ingest,\nbut also the rate at which\nyou ingest that fluid.\nNow you might be thinking, that's crazy.\nThat makes no sense at all, right?\nIf I drink a ton of fluid slowly,\ndoesn't it still mean that\nI'm going to urinate a ton?\nYes and no.\nIt also stands to reason\nthat you might ask,\nif I ingest very little\nfluid, but I do it very fast,\nis it going to be the case\nthat I'm going to urinate it\nout very quickly?\nWell, yes and no.\nThe point is that the\nfluid filtration systems\nof your body that range\nfrom the gut to the bladder,\nand include the kidney, of course,\ndepend not just on the volume,\nbut on the rate of fluid that you ingest\nbecause of those mechanosensors\nthat we talked about earlier.\nIf you gulp down a bunch of fluids,\nyou are going to excrete\nthose fluids more quickly\nthan if you sip them slowly,\nexcuse me, sip them slowly.\nSo here's what I recommend.\nThroughout the day,\nwhen you're trying to get\nyour adequate yield of water\nor other beverages, feel free\nto gulp that fluid or sip it.\nI'm a gulper, not a sipper,\nbut many of you are going\nto be sippers, not gulpers.\nConsume fluid at the rate\nthat feels right to you,\nbut feel comfortable gulping that fluid.\nHowever, in the evening,\nif you are somebody who has challenges\nwith waking up excessively\nin the middle of the night,\nreduce your fluid intake,\nprovided you've hydrated\nproperly throughout the day,\nand I suggest consuming no more than five,\nmaybe eight ounces of fluid\nbetween the time of 10 hours after waking\nand when you go to sleep.\nAgain, if you're very thirsty,\nor you underhydrated, or it's very hot,\nfeel free to ingest more fluid, please.\nBut most people will find that\nif they reduce their fluid\nintake to about five ounces\nor less of fluid in that\nlater part of the day,\nafter 10 hours of having\nwoken up, and before sleep,\nand they sip those beverages\nas opposed to gulping them,\nthat they will have fewer bouts\nof waking up in the middle\nof the night to go to the\nrestroom, and ideally zero.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
