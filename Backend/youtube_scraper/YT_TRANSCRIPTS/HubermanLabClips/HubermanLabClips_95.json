    "transcript": "How do we actually measure dehydration?\nNow you hear different things\nlike if you pinch the skin\non the top of your hand\nand it takes more than three seconds to\nlay down again flat,\nthen you're dehydrated.\nYou hear that.\nYou hear, okay, if you are\nto press on your fingernail\nand see a change in\nthe color of the tissue\njust below your fingernail,\nwhich indeed does happen,\nand it does not go back\nto its original color\nwithin one to three seconds,\nthen you're dehydrated.\nYou hear things like this.\nIf your ankles are swollen\nwhen you're wearing socks,\nyou take off the socks\nand you can see the imprint of the socks\non your lower limbs, that\nmeans you're dehydrated.\nYou hear this kind of stuff,\nand you should probably be\nwondering, is any of that true?\nTo some extent, it is true,\nalthough it can vary quite\na bit by how old you are,\nwhether or not the skin\non the top of your hand\ntends to be looser or not,\ndepending on whether or\nnot you're leaner or not.\nSo, in other words,\nthose are not absolutely\nobjective measures of dehydration.\nNow, it is true that if normally\nyou can pinch the skin\non the top of your hand\nand it returns to its\nnormal flattened position\nwithin about one to two or three seconds,\nand it does not do that\nwithin five or more seconds,\nthere's a decent probability\nthat you're a little bit dehydrated,\nthat you need to ingest some fluid,\nor that if you press down on your nail\nand you see the depression\ncauses a transition from\nkind of a pink color to a white color,\nand then you release\nand it doesn't go back to\nits original pinkish color\nwithin a few seconds,\nwell, then there's a chance\nthat you're dehydrated.\nBut again, these are not\nperfect measures of dehydration.\nYou may be surprised to learn,\nand I was surprised to learn,\nthat most of the basis\nfor these statements,\nlike even a 2%\ndehydration state can lead\nto significant reductions\nin cognitive physical or performance\nare based on not direct\nmeasures of hydration,\nbut rather on measures of\nreductions in water intake,\nwhich is a different thing, right?\nIt's saying that ordinarily\na person of a given body weight needs\nX amount of fluid per day,\nand when they get even just 2% less\nthan that amount of fluid,\nthen their cognitive and or\nphysical performance is impaired\nrather than focusing on\ndehydration of tissues.\nNow that might seem like\na subtle distinction,\nbut it's actually a meaningful distinction\nwhen you think about it.\nHowever, it's a meaningful distinction\nthat we can leverage toward understanding\nhow much water or fluid\nwe need to drink each day.\nNow, there we can really\npoint to some solid numbers\nthat, believe it or not,\nare fairly independent of body weight.\nNow, I say independent of body weight,\nI'm referring to the amount of fluid\nthat most healthy adults need at rest.\nWhat do I mean by at rest?\nI mean when not exercising\nand when not in extremely\nhot environments.\nSo I'm leaving aside you\ndesert ultra marathoners\nor people that are doing\nany kind of movement\nor living in environments\nthat are very, very hot.\nHere, I'm mainly referring to people that\nlive most of their daily\nlife in indoor environments,\ncould be air conditioned\nor not air conditioned,\nheated or not heated.\nWhat we're trying to arrive\nat here are some numbers\nthat can work across the board\nbecause of course there\nare an infinite number\nof different conditions\nthat each and all of you are existing in.\nSo I'm not going to attempt\nto give you a body weight\nby activity, by environment, by humidity\nformula calculation.\nIn fact, no such calculation exists.\nHowever, there are formulas\nthat can put you into\nvery stable frameworks.\nThat is levels of water intake\nfor periods of rest when\nyou're not exercising\nand for when you are exercising\nthat will ensure that you are hydrating,\nwith the one exception\nbeing if you are exercising\nor if you are living in\nvery, very hot conditions\nand you're not heat adapted\nto those conditions.\nSo what are those numbers?\nIn other words, what is the\nanswer to the question of\nhow much fluid do we need each day?\nAnd here I'm referring to fluid.\nI'm not distinguishing between\nwater, caffeinated beverages,\nsoda, tea, and so on.\nI'll discuss that in a moment.\nWe can reasonably say\nthat for every hour that you are awake,\nin the first 10 hours of\nyour day, this is important.\nIn the first 10 hours of your day,\nyou should consume on average\neight ounces of fluid.\nNow, for those of you that\nare using the metric system,\nnot ounces,\neight ounces of fluid is approximately\n236 milliliters of water.\nAnd for those of you that\nexist in the metric system\nand aren't used to thinking\nabout ounces and vice versa,\njust think about a typical can\nof soda in the United States,\nit's 12 ounces.\nIn Europe, sometimes the cans of soda\nare a little bit smaller.\nThat's a whole discussion unto itself.\nBut eight ounces of fluid, that is\n236.\nSo let's just say 240 milliliters,\n'cause we don't need\nto be too precise here,\nof fluid\non average\nevery hour\nfor the first 10 hours of your day,\nwhich translates to an\naverage of 80 ounces of fluid\nfor the first 10 hours of your day,\nor\n2,360\nmilliliters of water.\nIn other words, approximately\ntwo liters of water\nplus a little bit more for the\nfirst 10 hours of your day.\nNow, I want to be very clear\nthat this does not mean that you need to\ningest eight ounces or\n236 milliliters of fluid\non the hour every hour for the\nfirst 10 hours of your day.\nI'm certainly not saying that.\nAnd in fact, most people are going to find\nthat they're going to\ningest water in boluses.\nThat is, they're going to have\nperhaps 16 ounces of water,\n500 milliliters of water\nat one portion of the day,\nand then maybe a couple hours of later\nthey'll drink some more water\nor some more coffee or\nsoda or some other beverage\nin another portion of the day.\nI do think, however, it's\nimportant for most of us\nto take a step back and ask ourselves\nwhether or not independent\nof any other activity\nor environmental conditions,\nwhether or not we are in\nfact ingesting 80 ounces,\nor\nbasically 2.4 liters of water\nfor that 10 hours of the day\nthat spans from the time we\nwake up until 10 hours later.\nNow, why am I setting\nthis 10 hour framework?\nThe reason I'm setting\nthis 10 hour framework\nis that it turns out that\nyour fluid requirements,\neven just at rest,\nare vastly different in the\ntime from when you wake up\nuntil about 10 hours later\nas compared to the later\nevening and nighttime.\nAnd here I'm referring to people\nthat are not doing night shifts,\nbut if you are requesting a number\nof how much fluid to drink\nindependent of our needs\nfor fluid for exercise,\nthat's going to be eight ounces of fluid\nor 240 milliliters of fluid\non average\nfor every hour from the\ntime when we wake up\nuntil 10 hours later.\nThat's the simple formulation\nthat should basically ensure\nthat you're getting\nsufficient baseline hydration\nfor the cells and tissues of your body.\nNow, if you are engaging in exercise,\nwhether or not it's endurance exercise\nor whether or not it's\nresistance training exercise,\nyou are going to need additional fluids\nin order to maximize the\neffects of that exercise\nand to avoid dehydration.\nAnd there too,\nwe have some excellent\nnumbers that we can look to,\nexcellent because they\narrive from research.\nAnd this is largely\npeeled from the episode\nthat I did with Dr. Andy Galpin,\nProfessor of Kinesiology\nat Cal State Fullerton.\nWe did a six episode\nseries all about exercise,\neverything from strength\ntraining, hypertrophy, endurance,\nnutrition, supplementation, recovery,\neverything related to exercise.\nYou can find all of\nthat at hubermanlab.com.\nAnd one of the components\nof those episodes that was discussed,\nbut that some of you may have not heard,\nis that there is a simple formula\nfor how much fluid to ingest, on average,\nkeep in mind this is on average\nwhen you are exercising,\nand I refer to this as the\nso-called Galpin Equation.\nThe Galpin Equation states that\nyou should take your\nbody weight in pounds,\ndivide that by 30,\nand that will give you the\nnumber of ounces of fluid\nto ingest every 15 to\n20 minutes on average\nwhile exercising.\nYour body weight in pounds divided by 30\nequals the number of ounces\nof fluid to consume on average\nevery 15 to 20 minutes.\nWhen I say on average, what\nI mean is it is not the case\nthat you need to stop\nevery 15 or 20 minutes\nand consume that volume of fluid.\nYou could sip it from moment to moment.\nYou could wait half an hour or an hour\nand then consume a larger bolus\nof fluid, a larger amount,\nalthough it is recommended\nfor performance sake\nthat you\nsip or consume beverages\nfairly consistently\nthroughout your training.\nOne's ability to do that\nis going to depend on a number of things\nlike gastric emptying time,\nwhether or not the particular\nexercise you're doing,\nwhether or not it's running or jumping,\nis compatible with ingesting\nfluid on a regular basis,\nor whether or not you need to\ndo it at different intervals\nthan every 15, 20 minutes.\nMaybe it's every five minutes,\nmaybe it's every half hour,\nyou have to adjust for you.\nBut if you were to take\nthe hour of exercise\nor the half hour of exercise\nor the three hours of exercise\nand ask how much fluid to ingest,\nit's going to be that Galpin Equation\nof body weight and pounds divided by 30\nequals the number of ounces\nfor every 15 or 20 minutes.\nAnd of course, I can already\nhear screaming from the back.\nWhat about for those of us\nwho follow the metric system?\nAnd there there's a simple translation\nof the Galpin Equation,\nwhich is that you need approximately\ntwo milliliters of water\nper kilogram of body weight\nevery 15 to 20 minutes.\nAgain, the Galpin Equation\nconverted into the metric system\nis going to be two milliliters of water\nper kilogram of body weight\nevery 15 to 20 minutes on average.\nI'm sure a number of you\nare asking whether or not\nhydration prior to\nexercise is also important.\nIt absolutely is.\nAnd if you follow the numbers\nthat I talked about before,\napproximately eight ounces\nor 240 milliliters of\nfluid intake per hour\nin the first 10 hours of waking,\nthat should establish a\ngood baseline of hydration\nheading into exercise,\nwhich then prompts the next\nquestion I often get which is,\nis the amount of water\nthat needs to be consumed\naccording to the Galpin Equation\nduring exercise on top of\nor separate from,\nthat is does it replace the\namount of fluid that one needs\nat a basic level, that eight\nounces or 240 milliliters?\nAnd there the answer\nsort of goes both ways.\nI think if you're going to exercise,\nthen obviously follow the\nGalpin Equation in some way.\nAgain, you don't need to be\nultra specific about this.\nThese are ballpark figures\nthat will ensure hydration.\nSo we've set them a little\nbit higher perhaps than needed\nto ensure more hydration\nrather rather than less.\nBut basically the short answer is,\nif you're exercising for about an hour,\nmost people are exercising\nfor an hour or two,\nprobably not more than that.\nMost of my workouts are,\ncertainly the resistant training workouts\nlast about an hour.\nWell, then you can\nreplace the eight ounces\nor the 240 milliliters of water\nthat's required at baseline\nwith what you consume according\nto the Galpin Equation\nduring that about of exercise.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
