    "video_title": "Is Alkaline Water Better for Hydration? | Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "If you go into the store or\neven a convenience store,\nyou will see pH water.\nNow, every water has a pH, right?\nLower numbers mean more acidic.\nHigher numbers mean more\nalkaline or more basic.\nYou'll see pH water that is 7.4.\nYou'll see 7.8, you'll see 9.8.\nYou'll see a huge range of these things,\nand there are many, many different claims\nabout how the pH of water is important\nfor regulating the pH of the body.\nHere's the real story.\nThe pH of your body,\nthat is, the pH of the cells\nat different locations in your body,\nis strongly, strongly\nhomeostatically regulated.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nIt means it doesn't change that much,\nwhich means that you have\nvery specific biological mechanisms\nthat ensure the pH is\nmaintained, for instance,\nin the skin cells of your skin,\nin the retinal cells of your\neye, in your brain cells.\nNow, it is true that across the body\ndifferent cells and tissues\nhave fairly widely varying pH.\nYou know, it has been said\nthat the pH of bodily tissues\nis generally between 7.2 and 7.4.\nHowever, if you were to\nlook at the pH of your gut,\nand keep in mind that your\ngut is not just your stomach\nyour gut is the entire pathway\nranging from your throat\nall the way down\nto where you excrete\nthings out of your body,\nthat entire pathway\nhas different pH levels\ndepending on where you are\nalong the gut and intestinal pathway.\nAnd in fact, having much lower,\nthat is, more acidic pH\nat certain locations\nalong your gut pathway\nis what allows those gut microbiota,\nthose little microorganisms\nof which you have trillions\nthat are important for regulating\neverything from\nneurotransmitter production\nto hormone production,\nthat allow them to flourish and do well.\nThat said, except under\nconditions of hemorrhage\nor changes in blood volume\nthat are of a dangerous level\nthat can lead to seizure or even death,\nthe pH of the rest of\nthe cells of your body,\nand also those gut cells,\ndoesn't change that much on\na moment to moment basis.\nSo if somebody tells you\nthat you should drink alkaline water,\nor alkalized water as\nit's sometimes called,\nin order to keep your body\nmore alkaline and less acidic,\nthere is essentially no basis for that\nat a macroscopic level\nor even at a local level.\nNow, what that does not mean\nis that the pH of the water\nthat you drink is not important.\nIn fact, if the pH of the water\nthat you drink is too low,\nthat is, if the water that\nyou consume is too acidic,\nit will not move as quickly from your gut\ninto the other regions of your body,\nand therefore the other cells of your body\nthat require that water\nwill not be able to access it as readily.\nYou've probably experienced this\nif you've consumed certain water\nand it feels like it's sloshing\naround in your stomach,\nor it feels like it's just\nsomehow staying there,\nor you feel its presence more,\nnot just as volume but it's\nalmost as if you can feel\nthe little waves of water\nalong the inside of your gut.\nNow, sometimes that can\nrelate to temperature,\nbut oftentimes that can relate\nto the pH of that water.\nAnd it turns out it is true\nthat water that is more alkaline,\nthat is, pHs of 7.4 or higher,\ncan move more readily across\nthe aquaporin channel.\nAnd in terms of absorption of water\nfrom the endothelial lining\nand the other cell type lining of your gut\ninto the rest of your body,\nit is true that higher pH water,\nprovided that pH isn't too high,\nis going to be absorbed more quickly,\nwhich partially explains why some people\nhave an affinity for this higher pH water.\nNow, this is not to say\nthat you need to consume\na high pH water in order to\nhydrate your body properly.\nI want to be very clear about that.\nHowever, if you are interested\nin what the value of elevated pH water is,\nit largely has to do with\nthis accelerated absorption.\nThere is also growing evidence\nthat it can adjust the\nfunction of certain cells\nthat are within your immune system,\nand thereby reduce certain\ninflammatory responses.\nSo I realize as I'm saying this,\nsome people out there probably think,\n\"Oh no, this guy's like\na pH water proponent.\nHe's saying we have to\ndrink alkaline water\nor buy very fancy water.\"\nNow, I want to be clear\nthat is not what I'm saying,\nand I'm also not saying\nthat you need to purchase\nvery expensive water\nin order to derive the maximum benefits\nfrom the water that you drink.\nIt turns out there are a\nfew things that you can do\nby way of temperature and\nby way of filtering water\nand a few other tricks that\nI'll tell you a little bit later\nthat will allow you to increase\nthe absorption rate of water in the gut,\nwhich turns out to be a very interesting\nbut also potentially important thing to do\nfor not just reducing inflammation,\nbut also making sure that\nyou're getting proper hydration\nof different cell types in your body,\nincluding rapid hydration\nof your brain cells\nwhich can greatly enhance\ncognitive function.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
