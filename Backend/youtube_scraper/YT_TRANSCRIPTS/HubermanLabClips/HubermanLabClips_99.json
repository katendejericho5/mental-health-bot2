    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what\nare some tools that we can\nuse to enhance our recovery?\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\nlet's start off\nwith that acute overload phase.\nSo in other words, I just did a\nworkout, and I'm feeling awful\nor I just did one, two days\nago and I'm super sore.\nHow do I get rid\nof that right now?\nWell, there's a couple of\nthings you can do immediately\nafter your workout,\nand then others\nthat are maybe more actionable\na day later or two days later.\nAnd we'll just cover\na handful of them.\nWe'll do some nutrition, and\nhydration and supplementation.\nIn the next episode, I'm going\nto cover everything else not\nin that category right now.\nSo a couple of things.\nNumber one, you can actually\nkick start that recovery\nprocess at the end of your\ncurrent training session.\nAnd I guess I should\nsay it this way,\nI strongly suggest you\nstart this recovery process\nimmediately after the workout.\nYou mentioned earlier\nabout this idea of,\nyou got to get a really\nhigh peak of stress\nto cause adaptation.\nBut I actually didn't\nexplain that correctly,\nbecause what has\nto happen is, you\nneed that extremely\nhigh peak, but then you\nhave to be met with an extremely\nsharp recovery back down.\nAnd so you've talked\nabout this before in some\nof your neuroplasticity stuff.\nAnd in terms of what has to\nhappen that cause the insult,\nand then you\nimmediately need to be\nable to recover to make\nsure that causes changes.\nBut the same thing\nhappens here, so we\nneed a really sharp and\nhigh inflammatory response.\nAnd then if you do not meet\nit with an immediate recovery\nperiod, the signal won't be\nthere to maximize your results.\nSo what's that mean?\nYou can actually do\na couple of things.\nNumber one is, actually\nlistening to slow paced music.\nThere is evidence to suggest\nfast paced music may have\nslowed down your\nrecovery, and slow pace\nwould actually enhance it.\nSo if you just change\nfrom your maximum,\nget you up and get going\nmusic during the workout\nto a slower, lower\ncadence, that will\nhelp you kick start the idea.\nOf a similar note, you can\nalso use what we call down\nregulation breathing.\nYou could do them in\nconjunction, or one\nor the other,\nwhichever is up to you.\nSo my personal\nfavorite method here,\nis somewhere between\n3 to 10 minutes\nof finishing your training\nsession, laying down.\nI like to be in that position,\nyou can certainly do it\nin the Lotus position, but\nI think laying on your back\nis generally more effective,\npersonal preference,\nthere are no sides.\nI like the eyes being covered.\nGetting into this dark,\nquiet sort of area.\nAnd then just breathing\nthrough your nose\nin a structured cadence.\nThere's a lot of different\nthings you can try.\nAn easy example is\njust box breathing.\nAnd you can imagine box\nhaving four squares.\nSo what you're going to do is,\nInhale for somewhere between 3\nto 8 seconds.\nAnd then whatever\nnumber you choose,\nyou keep that same tempo.\nAnd so let's say you chose to\ndo a five second inhale, that's\ngoing to take you up vertically.\nAnd then horizontally for your\nbox, is a five second hold.\nAnd then a five second exhale,\nand then a five second hold.\nAnd you just need to repeat\nthat for the time domain.\nI typically honestly,\ndon't use a timer.\nYou'll actually\nnotice a lot of people\nwill fall asleep or get\nreally close to falling\nasleep in this period.\nAnd you could do a triangle\nversion of that, where\nyou do an inhale, hold,\nexhale, and then go right back\ninto your inhale or there's\na bunch of different tricks\nyou can try here.\nYou need to play\naround and see what\nactually works best for you.\n10 minutes is probably\nbetter, but if you can just\nat least give me\nthree, that'll work.\nIf you're really,\nreally resistant,\nyou can actually do\nthat just in the shower.\nAnd so if you're going\nto finish your workout,\nget in the shower.\nAgain, just close your\neyes in the shower,\ngive me three\nminutes of focused,\nrelaxation breathing and that\nwill accelerate the recovery\nprocess.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love\nit, and I particularly\nlove it because my\nlaboratory works\non stress and respiration, aka\nbreathing and the interactions\nbetween the two.\nAnd I'll just mention\na result that was just\naccepted for\npublication, so it should\nbe out by the time\nthis episode airs.\nANDY GALPIN: Hey, congrats.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank you.\nThis is the beautiful\nwork of, not me directly,\nalthough it took place in\nmy lab, but as we know,\nit's the student, the\npost-docs who really\ndo the heavy lifting of\nDr. Melis Balban in my lab,\nis a phenomenal researcher.\nThat showed that a short\nperiod of five minutes of box\nbreathing, of exactly the\ntype that you described\nor cyclic sighing,\nso two inhales\nfollowed by an extended\nexhale to lungs empty.\nIdeally, the Inhale is\ndone through the nose,\nthe exhales are done\nthrough the mouth.\nAlthough it can all be done\nthrough the nose or the mouth\nfor that matter, but probably\nnose, nose for inhale, inhale,\nmouth four exhale.\nOr inhales through the nose\nand exhale through the nose.\nCyclic sighing as we refer\nto it, done for five minutes,\nboth of those produce\nvery significant decreases\nin resting heart rate.\nThey over time will\nincrease things\nlike heart rate variability,\nand so on and so forth.\nSo provided that there\nare extended exhales,\nit seems like the calming\nresponse and the reduction\nin overall stress occurs.\nThe only thing that really sends\nthings in the other direction,\nwould be something like\ncyclic hyperventilation.\nI'm sure you've observed that.\nAnd interestingly,\nwhen we had people just\ndo five minutes of meditation,\nduring which of course, they\nare breathing, but they're\njust allowing their breathing\nto progress however it happens\nto be in that moment or moments\nacross the five minutes,\nthere were reductions\nin the same sorts of markers\nof stress that I described,\nbut not as significant\nas breathing.\nSo I love the box breathing\ntool, post workout.\nAnd there are some other\nalternatives there too\nthat I'll just mentioned,\nbut I think people greatly\nunderestimate the\npotency of breathing,\nfor shifting one's nervous\nsystem function away\nfrom stress or if one\nwants, toward more alertness\nand stress.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
