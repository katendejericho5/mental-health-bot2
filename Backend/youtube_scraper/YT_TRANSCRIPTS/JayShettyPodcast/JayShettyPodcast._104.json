a company you\ncan't have two CEOs you have to have\nthat moment of who is leading and who is\nfollowing hey everyone I've got some\nhuge news to share with you in the last\n90 days\n79.4% of our

world subscribe right now the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nshett J shett the one the only\nJett these are confidence is such a\nimportant and Powerful topic I wanted to\nask you because I think there's so much\nmaterial and you do so many interviews\naround confidence and what it means and\nwhat it feels like how do you define\nconfidence for you and what does it mean\nto you and what is something that people\ncan think of because I think everyone\nhas a different view of the word\nconfidence yeah I think most people\nactually have the misinterpretation of\nwhat confidence actually is because they\nusually and I was of this when I was a\nstay-at home wife for8 years I thought I\nneeded it to get started and I thought I\nneeded the confidence to live out my\ndreams to actually go towards my goals\nand I was waiting to have the confidence\nand that I think is a complete\nmisconception is what actually is\nholding so many of us back from trying\nanything and what I realized was in my\nown journey I actually just need to take\naction I needed to go into something\nvery insecure not knowing what I was\ndoing practicing practicing practicing\nyou know wax on wax off my favorite\nmovie Karate Kid and and get so damn\ngood that I build the competence to then\nlead to confidence so the truth is the\nconfidence is the byproduct of taking\naction and a lot of us don't think of it\nlike that we think it's going to be the\nMagic Bullet that's going to get us to\nactually take that action at the\nbeginning um and so that's where I\nactually reshaped and how I rethought of\nthe word confidence and then also for me\nconfidence is like a muscle if you don't\nkeep practicing it you won't actually\nget strong at it and if you stop\npracticing you will get weaker and just\nlike when you go to the gym you may\npractice like your biceps or your legs\nit's a different mechanism to practice\nworking your calves then practicing your\nbicep so that is what confidence is it's\nnot like you get confidence in one area\nand you're good to go yeah it's like you\nget confidence maybe in being in front\nof the camera but being in front of the\ncamera as you know Jay is very different\nthan being on stage so when someone sees\nmaybe you've got confidence in one area\nit doesn't mean that you got confidence\neverywhere else and I think people if\nit's you and you're thinking about it\nyou may then think that you're\nincompetent or you're no good or like\nit's just well I don't have the gene so\nI may as well not get started but the\ntruth is identify where you want the\nconfidence get started build that\ncompetence and then eventually it will\nbreed confidence yeah absolutely I I can\nagree with you more I remember once\nlooking at the definition of confidence\nin the dictionary and one of the\ndefinitions is an\nappreciation of One's Own abilities\nskills and\nqualities I was like I really like that\ndefinition like it's actually self-\nvalidation like confidence is being able\nto look at yourself and say I'm good at\nthis I'm actually a kind of person I'm a\nthoughtful person I am a good public\nspeaker I am a bestselling author\nwhatever it may be and you're almost\nvalidating a skill quality or attribute\nyou have by yourself and I think it's so\ninteresting and you're right I think\nwe've viewed confidence as how do other\npeople feel about us so we look at as\nlike oh that person looks so confident\ncuz they're like walking out their car\nthey got that swag they're like dripping\nin great clothes or whatever it may be\nand we see that as confidence but we\nknow that that person could be sitting\nin there going oh I'm I'm not the right\nsize I'm overweight underweight I'm\nwhatever else it may be and criticizing\nthemselves I was wondering what is\nsomething that took you the longest in\nyour life to build confidence around oh\nI'm ever evolving but I think it really\nwas to believe in myself that I'm\ncapable and that all started from\nbecause I was the stay-at home wife for\neight years and I want to just make sure\nthat I say this though there's nothing\nwrong with being a stay home wife at all\nit's actually one of the hardest jobs\nthat was for me but I didn't want it\nthat actually wasn't my dream it was I\nfelt like it was sucking the life out of\nme so as that staying home wife I didn't\nmake any change because I didn't feel\nlike I was capable of anything because I\nwas so insecure that voice in my head\nwas so negative Jay telling me all the\nreasons why I was no good to try\nanything and so in order for me to build\nmy confidence to move forward I was like\nwell what if I am bad who cares you have\nto actually practice why do I think that\nI can be amazing at something right if\nsomeone looks at you and they're like oh\nmy God he's such an amazing podcaster\nhow long have you been doing it years\nand years and years and years so when\nsomeone looks at you and let's say\nthey're comparing they beginning to your\nmiddle or your end you will feel\nincompetent and so for me I had to stop\nlooking outside of myself at all the\namazing people because I believed I\nwasn't good enough to try and so I had\nto build the internal confidence to take\nthat action to actually just try and\nunderstand that it's going to be a\nprocess and without that I never would\nhave got out of what I call Purgatory\nthe mundane where my life is just\nmundane enough and so I'm just stuck\nthere day in and day out and that idea\nthat even if you don't feel good enough\nyou can still take action I think was\nthe biggest thing that was the hardest\nfor me because I didn't want to get\nbullied I was already bullied as a kid\nfor my lks from other women so you can\nimagine me trying anything that fear of\nbeing bullied from other girls was so\npetrifying that I didn't even want to\ntake a chance and so realizing a I have\nto build that Within Myself and you said\nthe word validate actually earlier that\nword really sticks with me with me\nbecause I think a lot of us wait for\nvalidation external validation we wait\nfor someone to tell us that we're a good\nGreek wife or an amazing husband or a\nfantastic wife and that can actually\nhold us where we are because I was so\nseeking validation from everybody else\nand at the time I was getting validation\nfrom being that stay-at-home wife and so\nyou can imagine I have low self-esteem I\ndon't believe in myself I don't think\nI'm good enough and everyone's\nvalidating me for this one thing even\nthough I don't like that one thing that\nvalidation that feeling good about\nyourself is what kept me there so I\nthink the trick is is how do you make\nsure that you validate yourself and that\nbecame the path for me building my\nconfidence every single day what am I\ngoing to do today to validate myself not\nget validation from my partner from my\nboyfriend from the ex how many likes I\ngot on Instagram no no how can I\nvalidate myself and that became my North\nStar versus everyone else making me feel\ngood about myself absolutely I mean how\ndid you get the courage to admit to your\nyourself that you weren't happy in that\nmoment because I feel like a lot of\npeople friends that I know people have\nin my life will kind of tell themselves\nthe story and we have to because you\nhave to survive and you need a coping\nmechanism and we'll just be like no I'm\nall right I'm okay no you know this is\nlife like it's all right this is this is\nmy you know this is my uh lot in life\nand this is what I have to do and this\nis just how it is and we say these\nthings because we're scared of what\nmaybe on the other side of admitting to\nourselves that actually where I am is\nnot where I want to be and we kind of\nsupplement it with oh everyone thinks\nI'm doing all right so of course I can't\nbe doing that badly how do you kind of\nget the courage to say you know what I\ndon't want this life because I think\nthat statement requires a lot of courage\nand I know I was scared to admit it to\nmyself when I was I'd already left the\nmonastery I was in a corporate job it\nwas safe it was stable it was sturdy\ncareer progression was obvious and here\nI was going and by the way I was so\nscared I would never get a job after\nleaving the monastery so even having a\njob I was very grateful because no one\nwould give me one so now for me to be\nlike okay I need to break this away and\neveryone's like wait a minute you're\nlucky to have a job bro you didn't work\nfor three years like so how do you how\ndid you get the courage to admit to\nyourself I'm not happy here yeah so I\nlove this question because it's such a\nsmall dripping effect and I liken it to\nwater dripping on a stone a couple of\ndrops is not a big deal over time you do\nthat year after year after year what\nhappens to that rock it actually starts\nto change its shape and that's what I\nstarted to realize me ignoring my\nhappiness ignoring what I actually\nwanted started to change change the\nshape of how I saw myself and after 8\nyears I didn't look like what was\nlooking back at me in the mirror I\ncouldn't recognize myself because I\nwasn't speaking up I wasn't having my\nvoice and so there were a couple of\nthings I realized that really um became\nlike the straw that broke the camels\nback if you will one of them was I was\nusing gratitude which I love right it's\nlike be grateful for things you have\nbecause there are other people out there\nthat don't have that so the first couple\nof years from in in uh my marriage I was\nusing gratitude even though I didn't\nwant to be the stay home wife now that\nlooked like my God I don't like being a\nstay I don't like cooking and cleaning\nbut actually I'm so grateful I have a\nhusband that loves me my God the amount\nof people that don't have that healthy\nrelationship I'm so grateful I'm so\ngrateful I've got a roof over my head\nI'm so grateful fill in the blank and\nthat was wonderful but come year four\nyear five year six year seven that\ngratitude started to really turn its\nhead into almost toxic gratitude which\nevery time that voice that was speaking\nare you happy Lisa like you don't seem\nhappy I would use the Gratitude to shut\nher down and that looked like how\nungrateful are you how ungrateful are\nyou that you want something else when\nyou've got a husband that loves you how\nungrateful are you you Leisa that you\nwant to go out in the workforce when you\ndon't have to so that voice that\ngratitude started to come really toxic\nand so identifying that allowing the\nvoice in my head to just turn up the\nvolume allow her to actually speak\nbecause we've been taught especially For\nMe growing Up Greek orthodoxes you live\nin service of everybody else you live in\nservice of the family the husband the\nkids and so you put yourself last and I\nstarted to realize this voice is getting\nlouder what happens if I actually start\nto listen to her what does that look\nlike because I'm such a self- ownership\nperson and so if I'm unhappy what am I\ngoing to do about it what choices am I\ngoing to make different that's going to\nlead me to a different outcome and I\nstarted to realize it was all on me I\nhadn't spoken up and told Tom my husband\nthat I was unhappy so let let's just\naddress step one acknowledge Lisa you're\nunhappy without shame and guilt\nacknowledge it to myself that was step\none then acknowledge it to my husband I\nlove you more than life itself babe but\nI don't want to cook for you and clean\nfor you anymore voicing that having the\nthe strength the courage you said that\nearlier Having the courage to really own\nwhere you are instead of sitting in the\nshame was a massive thing and then the\nfinal thing is just project your your\nlife out what does it look like if you\ndon't make a change in a year in 5 years\nin 10 years in 20 years and the truth\ntruth is I would have been doing the\nsame thing I would have then slipped\ninto being a mother I would because\nthat's what my culture told me and then\nI would have slipped into giving over to\nthe children and and the husband and in\n10 20 years I'm exactly where I am just\non a different scale and those elements\nwere the things I'm like oh well no\none's coming to save you no one's going\nto come and change your life for you so\nwhat am I going to do right now to make\nthat change that that resonates so\ndeeply and I love that you brought up\nthat top a gratitude point because it's\nso interesting how we somehow deep down\nbelieve we deserve so\nlittle right like and whether it's\nconditioning where we grew up there's\nthere's a sense inside of us and by the\nway I can relate to all of that we we\ngrew up in the same area we've talked\nabout this before a block away from each\nother literally literally and you know I\nkind of like when people ask me now like\nyou know how how does it feel and\neverything I'm like I actually never in\na million years\nbelieved that any of this would ever be\npossible or even that I even had a dream\nfor it I don't even think I dreamed this\nbig and there was a part of me that just\nwas okay with whatever would have come\nand whatever would have been and what\neveryone around me was doing and now I\nsee that that was because somewhere deep\ninside of myself I was hampering my\npotential I was restricting my desire\nbecause it's almost like you're so\nscared that it may never happen that\nyou'd rather not allow the possibility\ndoes that make sense yeah the fear of\nfailure is actually or failing is\nactually worse than the fear of failing\nso you're like well I may as well sit in\nthe fear of failing than actually fail\nand have everyone see it yeah exactly so\nfor you what was that like like I guess\nhow have you dealt with that like you've\nbeen on both ends now like you've been\nin a place where you didn't even feel\nlike you were allowed to deserve a\ndifferent life you've now built one of\nthe most successful companies you've\nbuilt another incredible Media company\nlike you know it's like you've now seen\nthe other end how is your belief system\nchanged around what you deserve and\nwhat's possible yeah I think it starts\nwith frame of reference so people don't\nactually realize that they have a frame\nof reference and just to kind of explain\nframe of reference is just the way you\nsee the world the way you think it ought\nto be not the way it necessarily is and\nso my frame of reference is going to be\nvery different than your frame of\nreference and so take for instance the\nvery first time I introduced Tom to my\nfamily so I've got a very big loud Greek\nfamily and everyone talks over each\nother everyone yells at each other and\nso Tom comes and meets them and that's\nthe family everyone's yelling and so we\nleave and I'm like oh my God they\nclearly loved him cuz they're clearly\nvery comfortable around him so I can't\nwait to hear how much he loves my family\nso we get in the car and like babe what\ndo you think and he's like they were so\ndisrespectful and I was like what and\nhe's like I can't believe Lisa if\neveryone's just screaming and yelling\neach other they ask me a question they\ndon't listen frame of reference my frame\nof reference when someone yells and\nscreams like in a happy way it's\nactually a a sign of greeting you being\ncomfortable around you but Tom's frame\nof reference is when someone's yelling\nit means disrespect so that just gives\nan example of what frame of reference\nmeans so you don't actually question\nyour frame of reference and I think that\nwas the massive thing is I still right\nnow to this day when now every day\nquestion my frame of reference on the\nway that I see things because maybe I'm\nmissing something so being the\nstay-at-home wife my frame of reference\nwas well this is what a woman does\nyou're going to have children you will\nget married it didn't even dawn on me\nJay that I could question whether I want\nkids or not it didn't dawn on me and so\ngoing from that to where I am now is\nbecause I literally will question my\nframe of reference every day because\nit's your frame of reference that gets\nin the way of you doing having the dream\nhow many people say I can't I remember\nonce I was coaching somebody and they\nwere saying about how they're building\nthis business and this is woman she's\njust had a baby and she freaking loves\nthat she's building this business she\nfeels so good about herself and her dad\nevery day would has a key comes in her\nhouse and would sit down at dinner and\nbasically say that she was a neglectful\nmother and she's like I don't know what\nto do Lisa and I said okay well he's got\na key to your house either tell your dad\nthat he has to set boundaries or he\ndoesn't get the key to your house she's\nlike I can't do that I'm like yes you\ncan you just don't want to your frame of\nreference may be that I'm a terrible\ndaughter if I take the keys away from my\ndad but how is it serving you and so\nthat I think was the massive thing that\nI realized that I had a frame of\nreference about life belief system\nwhatever you want to call it and\nsometimes it doesn't serve my dreams my\ngoals and where I want to go and so\nhaving the\nself-awareness to ask myself where am I\nwhere do I want to go how am I going to\nget there and what belief system do I\nhave that's either going to propel me\nforward or hold me back what did you do\nin this in this I think another thing\nthat and I know a lot of women\nespecially struggle with this what had\nyou and Tom done before the point that\nyou could actually have the courage and\nconfidence to go and say to him I love\nyou but I don't want to cook and clean\nanymore because to me that kind of a\ntransition in most marriages or\nlong-term relationships it could look\nlike I love you I don't want to live\nhere anymore I love you I don't like\nthis thing that you do I love you but\nwhatever right fill in the blank what\nhad you and Tom done before that you\nfelt confident enough to say that that\nyou knew it would land or did you\nactually take a risk and you didn't know\nat that point whether he'd react\npositively or negative obviously now\nyou've been together and all the rest of\nit but in that moment did you know that\nhe would react well to it or did you\ntake a risk because it was so true to\nyou yeah everything's a risk you never\nhow many times have you spoken to\nsomeone you're like I know exactly what\ntheir answer is going to be and then\nlike or you go to R right and you're\nlike all right and then she gives you a\ncompletely different response than you\never expected but you still know him for\nso many years so I didn't and there's\nnever a guarantee but really I went into\nit going okay how would I want him to\ntalk to me about this because here's the\nthing I need to be very self aware that\nI'm about to make his life more\ndifficult so just to paint the picture\nhe would wake up his clothes were next\nto him literally by his bed Jay he would\nput them on he would go to the gym he'd\ncome back his work clothes were ready\nhe'd get changed I would hand him lunch\nto take to work so he didn't have to do\nanything in the house so I knew I can't\npretend that his life isn't going to be\nworse it is I'm making his life more\ndifficult so a have give him the grace\nthat of course he's going to have an\nopinion of course it's actually going to\nmake his life more difficult so give him\neven though it's unfair exactly for you\nyou still are being empathetic in giving\nGrace of course and even with the unfair\nthough I agreed to it it wasn't like he\nwas like forcing me to do it so that's\nanother thing I said yes I also chose\nthat life so I had to take ownership\nover I chose this as well he didn't\nforce me to but now I want to make a\nchange so how do I do it so giving him\nthe grace that of course he's going to\nhave a feeling and then understanding\nthe idea of G grief grief is where you\nhave to let go of something someone\nsomething that you didn't expect and so\nhe had an idea of the wife that I was\nbecause I had painted that idea for\neight years so I know he's going to have\nto grieve the wife that I was so giving\nhim the space to grieve is super\nimportant and then the last thing is\nalmost like I to say but like a drug\naddict where you like wean them off I\nwas like he's addicted in some way or\nhabitual to the fact that I would do\nthis every day and just like any habit\nyou cannot change that overnight and so\nwhat I said to him is look here's a game\nplan maybe this will help what if next\nweek I'm just going to cook and clean\nfor you six days a week and then the\nweek after that I'm going to do five\ndays four days three days right and so\nwhat that did was show him I was willing\nto work with him on the\ntransition and then the final piece is\nletting him know I'm not\nhappy babe I'm profoundly unhappy this\nisn't your fault this is because I made\ndecisions but now I need your help right\nso I'm asking to be a part of this and\nneed your help because I'm not happy and\nI don't think I can do it alone now as\nmy husband he has the opportunity to be\nthere for me instead of him being in his\nown in his own head selfishly like I\ncan't believe he's like oh my God my\nwife is actually asking for help so that\nhelp piece was a big deal as well and\nthen overall I think when you're\napproaching anything like this how do\nyou see your relationship I think\nrelationships are like a game of tennis\nyou're playing a sport you're playing\nthe same sport but are you playing\nsingles or doubles if you're playing\nsingles you're both on each other side\nof the net and you're just hitting the\nball back and forward and ultimately\nonly one of you can win and you seej I'm\nsure you've seen a lot of relationship\nwhere someone's just trying to make a\nlittle jab at them and it's like it's\nliterally this back and forth It's not\ncoming together but a game of doubles\nyou're on the same side you either win\ntogether or you lose together and if I'm\nweak I tell you I'm weak and that's\nwhere you get stronger and vice versa so\nin this moment I'm saying to my husband\nI don't know what I'm doing I don't know\nwhat the future looks like but I'm not\nhappy I am weak metaphorically I need\nyour help and so he turned around in\nhaving laid all that out being honest\nwith each other that's also the\nfoundation is is your relationship\nbuilding on honesty once you had that\ndiscussion his response was what kind of\nhusband would I be if I put clean\nunderwear ahead of your happiness and\nthat became the moment where he realized\nwe were in it together I wasn't happy\nand he could help me navigate out of it\nand it C came to that one day where he\ndoesn't have clean underwear Jay I\ndidn't do laundry for like a month and\nhe turns around yells from in the other\nroom babe I don't have any underwear and\nin that moment I paused and I was like\noh no is this where the truth comes out\nand he's like I can't believe as my wife\nyou don't give me clean underwear and he\nturned around he like so I guess I'm\ngoing to work Commando and he goes to\nwork with no underwear on now what that\ndid was the way that I handled it\nbrought him in we did it together made\nthat moment was like a makeup break he\ncould have been mad he could have been\nlike see I knew it the resentment and\ncontempt is like the two things that\nwill identify I think by 90%\nguarantee that a couple won't last is if\nyou see resentment and contempt in a\nrelationship and so that would that is\nexactly what would have happened he\nwould have built contempt day by day\nthat my wife isn't cooking for me my\nwife isn't cleaning and one silly moment\nlike I don't have underwear could be\nthat breaking point of that relationship\nbut because we'd set up that Foundation\nthat moment that could have broken us\nactually brought us closer together yeah\nI mean that but that is literally an\nemotional maturity master class like\nthat it's it's incredible that you had\nthat emotional maturity then and that\nTom did too and obviously you know you\nyou see it in your continued success of\nyour relationship and marriage but I\nwish everyone would have a conversation\nlike that because here's how it usually\nwould go you'd have the realization that\nyou're not happy you'd probably suck it\nup and live with it for a bit longer\nthen you'd go up to me and be like I\ncan't believe you've controlled me for\nthe last 8 to 10 years I can't believe\nthat you've dominated me I can't believe\nthat you've made me this submissive\nperson and I'm not happy and I'm never\ngoing to cook for you again I'm never\ngoing to clean for you again do it\nyourself grow\nup and you could have said it like that\nand then he'd turn around and go get\nover it that's what you signed up for\nand I think a lot of people end up\nhaving that version of it and it's\nreally interesting I I say this to a lot\nof people it's almost like when you\nshare something are you sharing in a way\nthat is looking at the 360 of what you\njust said like well what did I sign up\nfor what did they sign up for how does\nthis change affect\nthem the change will never be seamless\nand smooth that now that I've said it\nfrom Tomorrow everything's going to be\nperfect and it's incredible to me to\nhear the M emotional maturity\nsurrounding that and I hope that\neveryone who's listening and watching my\ncompassion goes out to people who I do\nfeel are with someone who may not have\nthe emotional mat to receive it even if\nit's shared with the maturity that you\njust shared it I think I do know a lot\nof people who have tried to share\nsomething similar with their partners\nand the partners will be like oh just\nget over it oh you'll be fine tomorrow\ndon't worry about it like you know how\nwould you have dealt with if that was\nthe case How would how would you guide\npeople with radical confidence how would\nyou deal with that yeah God that's such\na great question because there's no\nguarantee that your partner is going to\nrespond the same way Tom did even if you\ndropped it perfectly right like that's\nthe point I think we live in a world\nwhere we think if I say everything\nperfectly then someone and we know\nthat's not true so let's say you dropped\nit perfectly and Tom had it's right babe\nthat that's what women are meant to do\nthat's what wife's meant to do that's\nwhat um or that's what you signed up for\nwe both signed a contract that's what it\nwas what would you what would you have\ndone and that's really important because\nthat's the thing it's like was it a\nnon-negotiable for him because even to\nwhere I said I originally wanted four\nchildren and I don't want any that idea\nof um that non-negotiable if he was the\ntype of person where one of his\nnon-negotiables were having children and\nhaving a stayhome wife I actually\nunderstand that we're not meant to be\ntogether then because I don't want to\nforce my opinion on you you need to live\nthe life that you actually want and if\nthat life means that you really want\nchildren you need to go and find that\nbecause we're going to make each other\nunhappy no matter how much I love you\nand so if Tom turned around to me and\nsaid yeah no that's what you signed up\nfor I think in that moment I would have\nbeen shocked I wouldn't have expected it\nI would have had to go back and be be\nwith myself and be in silence and start\nto write out what my value systems are\nwhat my morals are and how I want to\nshow up every day and then check to see\nif then what Tom is saying aligns with\nthat because I had been going along with\nthe flow for so long and thinking other\npeople's opinions were mine and so we\ndon't really know what is our own\nthoughts until we are still until we\nwrite out what we actually care about\nand so our value systems happen to very\nmuch align our value system is is I will\nsupport you even in spite of things that\nmay make my life more uncomfortable\nright my value system is is that you\nhave you are an ambitious man I will\nprotect you and support you in your\nambition even if it makes my life more\ndifficult so if he's working which is\ntrue two years ago he was working 120\nhours a week two years ago yeah like for\nlike uh 18 months that was very hard and\nso for 18 months I was supporting him\nuntil it started to become detrimental\nto us and that's where it's like support\neach other know your value systems but\nnever let your own values diminish your\nown wants and need diminish and that's\nwhat I did for eight years and that's\nkind of what I talk about in the book\nabout how a relationship can be\nliterally the the winds beneath your wi\nyour wings that can help Propel you\nright it can it can make you feel better\nabout yourself as you're on that Journey\nbut it also can be that anchor around\nyour ankle that can if you dropped into\nthe ocean would just take you deeper and\ndeeper\nand so who are you with do they want to\nsee you shine do they want to actually\nsee you thrive and what are their\nnon-negotiables but I think ultimately\nif Tom had said that I don't think we\nwould have stayed together and that's\nthe key cuz when people say you and Tom\nare so lucky you're so lucky to have\nsomeone like Tom and I said no no no no\nI've got Tom because we communicate and\nhe's the person that is okay with a wife\ngoing from a stay-at-home wife to now an\nentrepreneur and I'm okay with having a\nhusband that Works 100 hours or 120\nhours a week most people aren't and that\nthere's no judgment there but that's\nwhat makes us beautiful dance partners\nand so never I just did it too long Jay\nnever anyone listening don't ever\ndiminish your dreams don't ever uh um\nnegotiate your boundaries for somebody\nelse know what they are first and then\nideally find somebody that respects and\ncomplement them yeah it's such great\nadvice and it's you know and I know you\nmean it and and it's funny because\nI I think I resonate strongly with that\nas well is that when I think about me\nand\nrad it's it's very we obviously we no\nlonger have been together as long as you\nand Tom have but I see a lot of\nsimilarities in how we're growing in\nthat way and and your your relationship\nis a beautiful example of that like you\nand Tom and how long you've been\ntogether and and all the Transitions and\nand I love seeing it it's it's really\ninspiring for us and I think it's it's\nsimilar for us like I always I genuinely\nbelieve it that the reason why me and Ry\nwork is because we communicate and is\nbecause we're both able to respect and\nadapt and know what the other person\nneeds I think what's really interesting\nthough Lisa is that a lot of the time\nwhat we want we've got to really think\nabout that word because I wonder whether\nsometimes we've always it's so funny\nbecause I'm going the other way but we\nstarted off talking about like we we all\nbelieve we deserve less but sometimes in\nour relationships we can be really\ndemanding in a way that isn't taking\ninto account who the other person is so\nI'll give you an example let's say what\nyou wanted and and I know Tom so I'm\ngoing to speak for him a bit and you can\nedit the parts I don't get right if you\nhad said Jay I'm excited to get married\nand the guy I want I want him to be\nsomeone who um every evening spends time\nwith me every weekend is free and\navailable I want him to think about\nplanning a vacation four times a year or\ntwice a year or once a year I want him\nto be someone who just wants to cuddle\nup and watch a movie every\nnight even if you wanted all of that Tom\nwas not the right guy like that's not\nTom like he's he may be some of those\nthings but not really not really yeah\nexactly from from my perception Tom's\nnot that guy you guys know each other\nyou know I know Tom yeah yeah like Tom's\nnot that guy and and and I'm not saying\nthat makes him a good or bad I'm just\nsaying that's not Tom and it was similar\nwith me and rad like you know like I I I\nthink I said something ridiculous to to\nrad when we first started dating and I\nwas like look if you want the guy who's\nalways free every weekend to hang out\nwith family and goes to a movie on\nFriday night and then goes like I don't\nknow like house shop Furniture shopping\non the weekend I was like I'm not that\nguy like I'm just that's not me like I\nhave a mission I'm I'm excited about\nstuff like I'm I'm passionate I want to\nlive a purposeful life like this is my\npriority and so sometimes what we want\nand who we're attracted Ed\nto don't mesh yeah like you can be\nattracted to Tom for his intelligence\nhis brain his looks whatever else it is\nand he can be attracted to you but then\nyou're like but wait a minute I actually\nwant someone who's ambitious or not\nambitious I want someone who's this or\nthis and so sometimes I think we're\ntrying to force someone to be something\nthat they're not and I see that a lot I\nhave a lot of friends who will say to me\nlike I wish he was just a bit more\nambitious I'm like but he's not and he's\nnot suddenly going to become that like\nhe's he's he may become that because we\ncan all change but obviously he's not\nshowing you that two years where someone\nwill be like you know I wish didn't work\nso hard like I you know like but you\nknow his goal is to be a billionaire\nlike as in do know I mean and he's\ndedicated to that so I'm like where does\nthat want and attraction kind of go\ntogether yeah I\nthink it's such a great question yeah\ncuz here's the thing though Jay is of\ncourse we want everything of course we\ndo everyone does so just accept that\nokay you're not going to necessarily be\nable to have everything so what's what's\nthe cost so I find ambition extremely\nsexy and attractive and so I'm attracted\nto someone that has ambition and so what\ncomes with that what is the cost of\nbeing attracted to someone that has\nambition it means they're not going to\nbe there every night at 7:00 p.m.\nthey're not taking time off on the\nweekends they're not filling the blank\nokay well what's more important to you\nlike now just look at those facts and go\nif you're ambitious this is actually\nwhat comes with someone ambitious if you\nwant someone that is a stay-at home\nagain freaking love it but just know\nthat probably means they're going to\nwork a 9 to 5 that that that way they\nhave the time to be open to them\nspending date night with you but are you\nokay with that what life do you want\nwhat's more important like actually\nalmost prioritize them and so for me\nthat was a very early wakeup call with\nTom where it's like I know who I married\nand so just because I've got a ring on\nmy finger doesn't mean now all of a\nsudden he has to change in order to fit\nall the things I'm looking for in life I\nactually know that the cost of being\nwith him is that I don't see him on a\nSaturday night or a Friday and then that\nextends to children when we were even\ntalking about kids he said babe I love\nyou I'm not going to wake up in the\nmiddle of the night and clean the baby's\ndiaper because I am ambitious and I will\nbe resentful going back to that word\nI'll be resentful if I give up my\nambition for my children and my wife I\nwon't be able to be the man that you\nlove and you want me to be because I'm\nyou are literally strip stripping me\naway of the fundamental person I am and\nwhen you can respect someone for being\nthat honest and that transparent I only\nreceive it with utter gratitude to be\nhonest like thank you for telling me\nbefore we have children what type of\nFather you're going to be and so he said\nI'm going to be working really hard I'm\nnot going to be coming home at 7: p.m.\nevery night and I'm not going to get up\nwith the kids because I need to make\nsure that my cognitive load is like on\nfire when I'm in my business but then on\nthe weekends the truth is that I want to\nbe an amazing father and so I'm going to\nbe on the weekends taking my kid to\nsoccer practice and doing all these\nthings those are the reality of who\nfundamentally he is and how that shows\nup in our relationship cool now that I\nknow that do I still want children\nknowing that pretty much Monday to\nFriday I'm a single mother because when\npeople don't have these conversations it\nends up being the biggest thing that\nbreaks that relationship because you you\nare now judging the part I can't believe\nhe's not waking up and I'm I'm left all\nby myself or did you have the discussion\nso that you knew again there's zero\njudgment but you knew what the mother\nwants and what the father wants and this\ngoes both ways right it's not just Tom\nwhat do I want out of life and how did\nchildren fit into my lifestyle but those\nare the things that we spoke about every\nstep of the way so that we can always\ngive each other the utter respect in\nbeing the person they are because when\nyou strip away that you can't bring your\nwhole self you know you've written in\nyour book about how you have to have a\nrelationship with your purpose your\npartner has to have a relationship with\ntheir purpose and then you come together\nbut if you're stripping each other of\ntheir purpose you can't have that\nbeautiful dance and that relationship so\nknowing all of those factors is exactly\nwhere I was like I still love you I\nappreciate it I still find this very\nsexy and now the understanding is is\nthat he's not going to be home in the\nevening and that was actually part of\nwhat made me decide that I didn't want\nchildren because I don't want to be a\nsingle mother Monday to Friday I\nfreaking love my work so I actually\ndon't want to give give that up either I\ndidn't want to have children and have\nnannies bring them up no shame just my\ndecision and then on the weekends I'm\njust going to be utterly transparent and\nhonest with you is that I don't want to\nbe second or third on his priority list\nwhen is there going to be time for me\nand him if he's working all week and on\nthe weekends he's with the children yeah\nand the thing that I will protect the\nmost is my relationship with my husband\nmhm so knowing that now what decisions\ndo we make to protect our relationship\nand I understand people especially with\nkids like you won't know what it's like\nuntil you have kids I bet you get that\nall the time especially in your culture\nthe truth is no I don't know what it's\nlike because I don't have them but I\nthere's nothing that I'm missing or\nlosing because I don't know what I'm\nmissing out on it's kind of like a dog\nmaking fun of us humans for our sense of\nsmell it's like their sense of smell is\nfreaking amazing but I don't know what\nit's like so I don't look at a dog in\nlongingness I just go know my sense of\nsmell and it is what it is so but I do\ntreat it as fact that I bet you nature\ntakes its course and make sure that\nbiologically especially as a woman that\nyou then prioritize your children so\nthen again asking Tom are you okay with\ngoing down on my priority list when we\nhave kids because nature will make sure\nthat that child is the Center of My\nUniverse I don't pretend otherwise and\nbeing able to have that type of honest\nconversations with zero judgment giving\neach other the grace to just be who they\nare then allows us to say do we have\nchildren do we still stay in this\nmarriage without that growing contempt\nthat then ends up breaking all couples\nit turns you into a person you're not\nproud of you start arguing you start\nsaying things you don't like you start\ndoing things you're not proud of\nyourself you're using potentially their\nvulnerabilities against them in\narguments because you haven't had that\ntruth conversation from the get-go yeah\nI mean there's so much to unpack there\nand I I love the first point you made\nthis idea of if you're attracted to\nsomething that's a non-negotiable or a\npriority first of all just draw a line\nas to what the cost of that is so if you\nwant someone ambitious naturally they'll\nhave less time if you want someone less\ntime naturally they'll be less ambiti\nthat's just how life works and neither\nof those are good or bad but if you go I\nwant someone who's really ambitious and\nhas loads of time that's just not\nhappening and so you need to know your\ndeal breakers and you need to know your\npriorities and I I love the way put that\nbecause I do think that we do want it\nall and we want it all now and when\nsomeone doesn't give it to us all we\nthen think it's their fault and that's\nwhat creates this resentment and\ncontempt because we're like well wait a\nminute like don't you want to work a bit\nmore and it's like no but the thing you\nlove about them is that they're always\navailable like I have friends who's like\ntheir Partners will come on them with\ntheir work trip and then they'll be like\noh but don't you have something to do\nand it's like but but you love the fact\nthat they're always with you and then\nthere's this break you know this this\nbreak does that make sense or or even\nthis idea of like I have someone my\nfriend say to me like oh you know my\npartner's just a bit boring and I'm like\nbut you wanted someone who didn't do\nanything like you wanted someone who was\nyou know like didn't have interest was\nalways around was always always\navailable now you're calling them boring\nfor it it's like but you've never really\nyou know you've never encourag them to\nor you've never been attracted to\nsomeone who wanted to explore it's it's\nfascinating to me can we take it even go\nfor it yeah go for it all right so think\nabout women in the workforce now so a\nlot of women are which I freaking love\nright I want to empower women I think\nit's incredible that now we have the\noptions to really be able to go into the\nworkforce instead of be stayhome wives\nor mothers but what I'm noticing is\nhappening is a lot of some women I would\nwould say a lot are really building that\nconfidence and I freaking like it and I\ninterviewed somebody I won't say their\nname but she's a really big Powerhouse\nand she's successful and she's wealthy\nand she had just got divorced and so\nshe's telling me the story about how\nshe's like yeah I'm I'm owning my\nsexuality I'm owning who I am and I'm a\npowerful woman so she chats up this guy\nin a bar and she's like and he became my\nboyfriend he's younger than her so he\nmoves in with her and she's like I\nfreaking love it no gu's ever going to\ncontrol me again so she and I'm like\namazing I respect that you know what you\nwant you go after it halfway through the\ninterview she's just like yeah and I\ncan't believe he doesn't like book any\nvacations he never pays for dinner he\nnever takes the lead on something and\nI'm like because you didn't set up your\nrelationship for that to be like that\nand I think ultimately this is something\nI'm really playing with new that's\nreally Weighing on me is that I think\none of the things people don't ask each\nother and they're worried especially in\ntoday's society but I think it's\nimperative when you get into a\nrelationship before you commit who leads\nand who follows MH and the having that\nactual conversation and here's the thing\nfollowing someone doesn't make you\nweaker it doesn't make you submissive it\njust has a way think about dancing I've\nbrought up dancing for some reason this\nconversation I'm not quite sure why dip\nyeah it's a dip exactly um think about\nin dancing you can't have two leaders\nyou just can't think about running a\ncompany you can't have two CEOs you have\nto have that moment that's such a great\npoint you have to have that moment of\nwho is leading and who is following but\nif you can remove the stigma that maybe\nyou have against the word follow then\nyou can have that H conversation and\nthat's what Tom and I did is babe I want\nyou to to lead he wants to lead and I\nwant him to lead that doesn't make me\nless of a powerful Confident Woman it\nactually makes me stronger in my eyes\nbecause I'm strong enough to know I can\nstill be strong in my own conviction my\nideas my boundaries my standing up for\nmyself and I can still have faith in\nsomebody else is going to lead me now of\ncourse if he goes up step I'm going to\nhave the confidence to speak up But\nultimately I'm not challenging him for\nthat role and in today's society again\nit's just weird to for people to say\nabout roles in a relationship and I\nthink there's no right or wrong what do\nyou want in your relationship but you\nhave to have that role discussion yes no\nmatter what gender or person is going to\ntake the lead you have to have that\ndiscussion first yeah and and one thing\nthat Ry and I found is also that we lead\nand follow in different areas so when it\ncomes to our health Ry needs she decides\nwhat snacks we have in the house she\ndecides what we eat for breakfast lunch\nand dinner she decides where we go to\neat for restaurants if we're going out\nshe decides what we eat when we're\ntraveling because I trust her that she\nknows more about the body than I do as a\nnutritionist and dietitian and all of\nher expertise and so I'm going to follow\nher when it comes to working out I\nfollow her she she's the one who's like\nsetting the paces to like all right you\nknow when I met her I didn't even work\nout just played a bit of sport or\nwhatever and she was the one saying no\nno no it's really great for us to be\nactive and do this together so she leads\nwhen it comes to our home I lead\ninterior design cuz that's my thing I\nlove it I love art I love aesthetic I\nlove the feel I love everything and I\nget so into it and so she let me lead\nshe was like Jay you're in charge like\nthat's your thing when it comes to\nspending time with family and vacations\nshe leads because she loves taking care\nof her family and loves traveling\ntogether and giving them experiences and\nso she'll lead then when it comes to uh\nthe direction of like should we move now\nshould we do this where should we invest\nI'm leading that conversation and I\nthink it's beautiful because there's\nleading and following across all these\ndifferent areas and all of a sudden it's\nlike you're both playing to your\nstrengths you both be feel valuable you\nboth feel significant and you both feel\nlike you get to rely on the other person\nwhich is beautiful which is what you\nwant and I think it's yeah it goes back\nto the doubles in tennis you're playing\ndoubles exactly exactly like you take\nthat shot I'll take this one and that's\na that's a beautiful analogy and and and\nI think that that the reality of what's\nhelped us as well is being humble enough\nto say you lead your better at this and\nthen being confident enough to say no\nI'll take this one because that's my\nstrength and I think that requires so\nmuch humility and putting your ego aside\nand it also requires so much\nself-awareness and by the way this isn't\nperfect we're constantly playing with it\nlike they constantly be something like I\nwant you to do this because I don't want\nto do it she be like I don't want to do\nit either right there's that stuff too\nyeah and and then there's stuff where\nyou're both arguing over who's going to\nlead because you both want to lead it I\nthink what we're both coming back down\nto is the importance of that\nconversation because I know so many of\nmy friends actually have' been scared to\ntell their Partners going back to the\nkids thing and this could be about\nanything kids is an example where\nthey're not ready for kids but their\npartner is so pushing for kids and it's\nlike no one's listening to each other\nnow it's just our desire is superseding\nthe code that your partner is trying to\nsuggest to you of I'm not ready I'm not\nsure but your desire is just like no no\nno it has to happen now it has to happen\nnow and I find that to be like I think\nI'd really me and Ry kind of went\nthrough that like before we moved to the\nplace that we're at now I really needed\nto move because we lived in a place uh\nthat we were renting that I never slept\nwell in we had people taking stuff like\nour maale would always get stolen we'd\nhave there were a lot of animals that\nwere in the floorboards it was an old\nhome so you'd hear like animals rustling\naround like it was just one of those\nhomes where I always felt uncomfortable\nand anxious and so I don't think I slept\nwell for one and a half years or I would\nbe living in fight or flight every night\nthinking what if someone's in my house\nand that is not a comfortable feeling\nand so I kept pushing I was like Ry I\nneed to get out of it I need to get out\nand she she loved that home so she\ncouldn't get it she was just like this\nplace is beautiful and I'm like yeah\nit's beautiful during the day but at\nnight trust me I'm like really anxious\nhere and I'm not really an anxious\nsleeper I sleep well and so it was very\nnew for me and I could tell she wasn't\nquite getting it and so I had to start\nlooking for new places cuz I realized\nthat I was like until she sees something\nbetter you're amazing she's not going to\nget the point and so it was literally\nlike and and that's natural right like\ncuz her she was like I'm happy here I'm\nsatisfied here I was like no but I can't\nand she wasn't getting the subtle nudges\nand so I started looking started\ndragging to house viewings we found this\nplace even then she was like no no no\nthe other place is more beautiful blah\nblah blah blah blah and then finally I\nwas like you must be kidding me and then\nwe moved and now she's grateful that we\nmoved but it was really interesting how\nlike even though there was a bit of\nconflict and friction I still knew I had\nto lead but I knew I didn't have to lead\nby like trying to convince her or make\nher feel bad for not understanding me or\nbecause I could sense it wasn't that she\ndidn't understand me or she wasn't\nlistening to me or maybe there was a bit\nof that we just weren't getting if that\nmakes sense do that yeah what's\ninteresting is I go back to the value\nsystems because the value for you was I\nneed to the value of sleeping because of\nhow I know how important your brain is\nto you in your mind and how you think\nand how you show up and run your\nbusiness and everything like that it\nactually aligns with your value system\nnow maybe um Rad's value system was\nhomemaking I want to be somewhere I'm\ncomfortable so actually both of your\nvalue systems again there's no right or\nwrong but that's where your value system\nwas colliding because she feels like\nI've made a house out of this value\nsystem your value I'm not getting what I\nneed I can't work I don't have the\nmindset value system so actually what\nwas happening is your value systems were\ncolliding but you're not talking about\nthe value you're talking about the house\nyes yes yes that's so that becomes that\neven with the kids thing it's like okay\nwell the person that wants to delay the\nchildren what's your value system there\nI haven't gotten to where I want to in\nmy career and my career right now is\nsuper important and maybe the per the\nperson is my values syst I've always\nwanted a family and so I value family\nover business so now you can see one\nperson's valuing business over family\nthe other person's valuing family over\nbusiness and you're colliding but you're\nnot actually talking about the thing\nyou're just talking about the kids but\nit's actually about the value system\nthat's colliding the silly example that\nI learned this lesson with Tom was over\nmaking the\nbed I was like what do you mean you\ndon't make the bed of course you make\nthe bed it was like the thing I was\ntaught my whole life and Tom was like no\nI won't make the bed and we would\nCollide I'm like you don't get it and\nthese and so he would get frustrated\nevery time I would make the bed cuz he's\nlike I have to unmake the bed now I'm\nlike it takes 3 seconds and I was\ndismissing and mocking him if I'm going\nto be very honest thinking he was wrong\nthat of course you make what kind of\nperson doesn't and I was literally\nputting my value system on him until we\nstarted to D what does making the bed\nmean to you and to me it was about\nneatness it was about calm I have ADHD\nso I need those moments of calmness\naround me I need things to be neat in\norder for me to be centered but I didn't\nsay that I said I need the bed to be\nmade for him his value system is time\nhe's like it's the one thing I'll never\nget back and so if you ask me to do\nsomething that doesn't actually align\nwith the vision of what I want my future\nto be don't like you're asking me to be\nsomeone I'm not so his value system is\ntime my value system is tidiness and so\nyou can see in just that silly thing of\nmaking the bed we freaking Collide and\nhow many people couples do that every\nsingle day over small little things and\nwhat ends up happening is that oxytocin\nthat you had when you first started\ndating is no longer there and all you\nhave are these collisions day in day out\nI love that and and I I feel I really\nhope everyone who's listening and\nwatching like takes a moment to to break\nthis down for themselves like we had it\nthe other way around a few couple of\nmonths ago my wife's book came out her\nfirst gr book yeah thank you I know you\ninterviewed her for it as well and it\nwas you know and it was just it was a\nreally exciting moment rad had poured\nthree years of her life into this\ncookbook I saw her work hard on it I've\nnever seen her work that hard in my life\nnever seen her just be so consistent you\nknow how much work it takes you know\nlook we're sitting here talking about\nradical confidence one year on right and\none year on two two oh my gosh it's been\ntwo years yeah two years on of radical\nconfidence and you know how much work\ngoes into this book I know how much you\npoured into this book this was your\nfirst ever book and I said to Ry I said\nto her I said you know what Ry like\nwe've been together now for 11 years\nwe've celebrated a lot of things but\nyou've never had a book out so I don't\nknow how you want to celebrate this\nbecause not every celebration's the same\nlike you don't celebrate a birthday how\nyou celebrate an anniversary and how you\ncelebrate Christmas they're they're\ndifferent celebrations and so I was\nasking and checking in with her and I\nwas like I actually don't know what\nyou'd like to do in order to like make\nthis moment feel special\nand she we were on a hike and she just\nsaid to me she goes oh we just\ncelebrated last night and I was like\nwhat do you mean what I couldn't even\nremember what we did last night I was\nlike what do you mean we celebrated last\nnight and she was like yeah like our\nfriends came over I cooked from the book\nand they love the meals this was the day\nbefore the book came out and I was like\nwait that was a celebration to you like\nit wasn't there was no it wasn't like\nthe joyful book event there was no fancy\nlike cards with it was just a few mates\ncame over and she cooked from the book\nwhich I don't even know if she told\nanyone and they loved it and they loved\nthe food and she was like that felt like\na celebration to me because I made food\nI love for people I love and I was like\nwow you just saved me this Grand idea I\nhad in my head of like throwing a big\nparty or like you know putting the\njoyful banner up or whatever which is\nwhat I would do and I was just thinking\nabout that and I was like it's so\ninteresting to me that her value of\nCelebration is that my value around\ncelebration is totally different but\nagain so many couples and relationships\ncan go wrong because we're constantly\neither celebrating the person we love or\nwe're criticizing the person we love\nbased on our value system and now all\nwe're talking about is the criticism or\nthe celebration and not talking about\nthe value yeah and and it's fascinating\nto me that it works both ways whether\nit's a good thing or a bad thing because\nsometimes you do something something\nnice for your partner and they don't\nappreciate it and you're like why don't\nyou appreciate it they're like cuz\nthat's not what I appreciate it's not\nwhat I value and I applaud you for just\nasking her because so many people either\nwouldn't ask wouldn't do anything or\njust assume and that's I think where a\nlot of couples almost get mixed up where\nit's like well if if they love me they\nshould know and it's like oh that breaks\nmy heart it's like they're not a mind\nreader like like you said we all change\nwe all evolve you would have done\nsomething with the biggest heart right\nlike I want to celebrate my wife and she\nwere looking like what do you you mean\nthere times how many times and then what\nhappens in that moment you feel\nunappreciated for having tried to show\nup and do something amazing she doesn't\nfeel seen or heard so now this whole\nthing this act that you've done to try\nand really show her doesn't achieve\nanything you and her both feel badly and\nthen again you almost like look at the\nother person like you're wrong or you're\ncrazy or how could you have done this\nand so the idea of just just asking like\nremove all the IDE of what we've been\ntaught of like if they love me they\nshould know and just say ultimately I\nwant them to feel what I want them to\nfeel loved I want them to feel seen okay\nhow do they do that I sometimes don't\nknow let me just ask so one of the\nthings actually so I stopped being the\nstay home wife I stopped cooking for Tom\nwe laid out all of our things of how we\nwant to show up for each other and we\nchanged and grow we both change and grow\nsince then so only last year Tom turned\naround to me and he said you know what\nbabe like I feel like like I have a need\nthat's unmet right now I was like oh my\nGod what's the need babe and he's like I\nactually now miss that you don't cook\nfor me right so we've been like 15 years\nhe's been fine with it but instead of me\njudging him he told me I'm not supposed\nto guess he just said that and I said\nokay babe what does that look like and\nhe's like I like you to preempt my needs\nwhen it comes to food I said okay\ninstead of just leaving it at that I was\nlike okay can I order Postmates and have\nit delivered would that satisfy the need\nand he's like yeah you can or do I have\nto cook it he's like no no you can have\npostmes okay do I need to Plate it for\nyou or can I leave it out on the\ndoorstep and just text you it's here and\nhe's like well if you can put it on like\nmy kitchen counter like his little side\nand he's like that way I know I was like\ncool now I've heard you I don't have to\nassume I now don't have to go straight\ninto oh my God he's now asking me to\ncook I don't want to cook I went there I\nwas that person I don't want to get\ntrapped no none of that we just broke it\ndown bit by bit of understanding what\nexactly that need looks like now here's\nthe other part maybe I'm not willing to\ndo it and in that moment I just would\nhave said right now that actually\ndoesn't fit my lifestyle of what I need\nto show up so how do we find a\ncompromise is there a compromise or is\nit sorry I'm unable to do it but what if\nI do it for three weeks on on a holiday\nright now come up with ways that you're\nnot just shutting the other person down\nyou're hearing their needs and they feel\nheard that you're trying to find a\nsolution because ultimately I think not\nto just stereotype but typically I think\nwomen want to feel seen they want to\nfeel safe they want to feel needed and\nthey want to feel\nappreciated it's not the money it's not\nthe height that a lot of people are\nsaying they need to be six foot and and\nseven figures no no if you really do\nstop and pause and ask your partner how\nthey can fill those roles then you can\nstart to actually create a beautiful\nrelationship on the the long term and\nthen the same for a guy obviously I\ndon't know and I'd love to hear your\nthoughts but I've tried to process what\nis it that I think a guy needs they want\nto feel appreciated they want to feel\npowerful not controlling\npowerful um and they want to be\nrespected yeah I'd agree with that and\nso knowing okay if that's actually what\nyou want I'm just going to say it people\nmay hate it but I just go to truth how\ndo I make you feel powerful that's what\nI would ask Tom how do I make you feel\npowerful what are the things that you\nneed now again I then go back to my\nvalue systems I say does this align with\nme but I'm not going to guess I want to\nmake sure that my husband's happy and\nthat we're always constantly in\nalignment and when you've been together\nfor 23 years I met him when I was 21\nwe've built multiple companies together\nso how the hell have we been able to\nstay so aligned it's these little things\nthat people may be embarrassed to do may\nbe ashamed to do or they don't want to\ndo it that's the reality that's the\nreality we want something\nbut we either feel guilty shameful\nembarrassed or uncomfortable to ask for\nit and then we take that feeling out on\nour partner for not knowing it and we\nget triggered when they say something\nlike I wish you'd cook for me again that\ntriggers all of our PTSD from that time\nand now it's like how can you even ask\nme to do that you know how hard that was\nfor me yeah not\nrealizing it's just a suggestion it's\njust an idea it's coming from a good\nit's that space that I think we've been\ntalking about today is can you kind of\ncreate a safe space to have these\nuncomfortable conversations without any\nshame or guilt right and that becomes\nthe foundation that ultimately selection\nmatters who you choose to be with will\nabsolutely dictate the outcome of your\nrelationship and so I used to say the\nkey to a relationship is communication I\ndon't actually think it is I think it's\na growth mindset because if you do not\nhave a growth mindset no matter how much\nI communicate you said that earlier\nright they may not be able to respond\nnow think of all the hurdles and humps\nthat we've been through in our\nrelationship how have we survived those\nbecause we are open to having the hard\nconversations we're open to\ncommunicating endlessly until we get to\nthe solution one of the rules so Tom and\nI have a bunch of rules one of the rules\nis never apologize if you don't mean it\nand even in the moments of I'm deeply\nupset he absolutely can say baby I know\nif I just apologize to you right now I\nknow that you're going to feel better\nbut I can't can't apologize because I'm\nnot sorry for it and what that does is\nthat absolutely elongates the\nconversation the argument it may go no\nnow for 2 days 3 days but ultimately\nwe're not brushing it under the rug we\nactually resolve it and go okay I'm\nstill very hurt by it but let me\nactually work through that hurt why am I\nhurt why was I triggered why did you say\nthat you know and then we just peel away\nthe onion peel away the onion to get to\nthat core but it all comes from that\ngrowth mindset and if you don't have it\nno matter how much you discuss it you're\ngoing to hit a wall where you cannot be\nseen or heard absolutely Lisa you are\namazing the book everyone is called\nradical confidence 11 lessons on how to\nget the relationship career and life you\nwant today we did a deep dive on\nrelationships which I loved uh but when\nyou open up this book you'll learn how\nto handle your negative voice how you\ncan overcome failure how you can\nactually work through your emotions and\nunderstanding them setting your values\nsystem is a big part of this book\nbreaking through your beliefs building\nthat growth mindset is all inside this\nbook called radical confidence if you\ndidn't get grab a copy two years ago\nmake sure you grab a copy right now uh\nif you don't already subscribe to and\nwatch uh women of impact make sure you\ngo and do that as well uh Lisa it's\nalways such a joy talking to you because\nit's so lived everything you share is\nsuch lived experience and I know you\nlive by it cuz I know you and Tom and on\ntop of that it's just so real and I love\nhaving these really\npragmatic practical conversations around\ntopics that can be very\nethereal and uncomfortable and woo woo\nand kind of a bit like oh you and and to\nbe honest manipulative and controlling\nlike oh if you want him to do this do\nthis if you want her to and it's almost\nlike you actually can't get anyone to do\nanything all you all you can do is all\nyou can do is accept them for who they\nare or not and I think when we're having\nthese conversations I'm I'm really\nhoping that everyone walks away\nwith an understanding of what type of\nquality of interaction and conversation\nto have with the individual and the\ngrowth mindset point is in a\nrelationship is huge because\nadaptability and flexibility is at the\ncore of anything long term and I've seen\nthat with me and Ry too there is just\nthere I realize it all the time it's\nthings would only never work if we lost\nour flexibility and adaptability and\nthat's all growth mindset you you have\nto and it's so interesting how so often\nwe don't want to be flexible and\nadaptable and by the way that's okay too\nso Lisa thank you so much for for\nshowing up as always and just shedding\nso much Clarity on a really difficult\ntopic thank you Jay thank you for having\nme\nyou're you're such a good dude I\nfreaking love you I love Ry like we\nconnected from day
