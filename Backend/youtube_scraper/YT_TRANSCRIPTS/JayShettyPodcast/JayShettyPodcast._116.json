shett J\nshett the one the only J\nshett you know you were saying you're\nnew to the world of podcasting but it\nseems to be something you're opening\nyourself up to where's that where's that\ncoming from well first of all I love\nwhat you do thank you for having me it's\nso beautiful um to see to see the\nmessaging you put out in the world to\nthe edge is um is the first time I've\nworked in a unscripted\nspace and I'm very proud of it and I\nthought I'd try you know like I I\nhaven't intentionally not done podcasts\nI just haven't and I and I've been\nwanting as you said to to work with you\nfor ages so I was like to at least sit\ndown and have a conversation with you\nand I I I tried to get to one of your\nyour your your speaking engagements\nwhich I wasn't able to but it's like I\njust thought this is an opportunity to\nlike have a heart-c Centric conversation\nand I love the messaging you're putting\nout and actually you know Edge is a show\nthat came up it was the the birth child\nthe brainchild of a period of time that\nI think was really challenging in the\nworld for everyone you know through\ncovid where I think fear was sort of\naround all of us we were all like wait\nwhat you know what what are we what are\nwe living through this is so unique and\nI was it was sort of palpable in in my\nenvironment and I'm not I'm not\ncomfortable with fear I'm like I'm\nalways like I run into I like I like I\nwant to transform it I want to like I\nwant to you know it's people say what\nare you afraid of right you know oh Shar\nI'm like I'm afraid of fear you know\nbecause it's like I want to confront\nanything in my life that feels\nchallenging on those levels\nso actually initially I would love to\nhave spoken to you on my show I had this\nidea where I would speak to people you\nknow and also people like in blue zones\nand spaces in the world where people\nlike have just got it figured they've\ngot it dialed whether it's through diet\nlifestyle choices and all of the things\nthat you speak about it's like I was\nlike I want to go and explore the people\nin the world that do that and I've had\nthis amazing opportunity with UNICEF for\nmany years 20 years now almost and so\nI've sort of been in communities where\nI've seen how an impact what a great\nimpact positivity can have right which I\nthink is the message of Unicef also the\nfunding that they support supp for\ncommunities so I was like I want to go\nand sort of talk to people but we didn't\nreally get we got no hits nobody was\nreally interested in me doing that I\nthink there's also a Blue Zone show that\nis is is apparently epic as well so um\nso but how about we just throw you out\nof a plane and you know see if you can\nswim to the bottom of the ocean and we\nthrow you up a mountain I was like I can\ndo that you know it also feeds into my\num sort of adrenaline sort of fueled\nsort of a ects of my life I think you\nknow as a\nkid you know I was I I think I just was\nso active and physical and sort of\napproached life with that fearlessness\nand in some ways you know that was a\nblessing but I came definitely came out\nbanged up and bruised I think I had a I\nwas diagnosed with dyslexia when I was\nlike maybe 9 10 so I had some extra\nschooling in that space and that really\nhelped me because I had I had a kind of\nunusually high IQ but I just was really\nchallenged at focus and concentration I\nthink I was probably undiagnosed early\non with like probably ADHD which I've\nsubsequently kind of come to realize\nthat was definitely something that I've\num I've been navigating and now I've\nkind of found my way through to the sort\nof magic of what that can be for me do\nyou remember your earliest fear as a kid\nit's funny because I'm an actor but I\nused to just be terrified at getting on\nstage no way I had real stage fright as\na kid I was I was actually my\nmother enrolled me into a ballet class\nas a kid so until like I think from\nprobably a toddler tiny toddler until I\nwas maybe four or five and I think at\naround 4 we did this performance in\nCanterbury at the Marlo Theater which is\nthe biggest theater in town pretty big\ntheater actually and we did a little\nballet show which was just me as there\nwas probably a whole lot going on and\nI'm for so I don't entirely remember but\nI do know that I was dressed in a monkey\nsuit I remember having a really hot\nitchy monkey suit on and having an itch\non my bottom and I was a little\nembarrassed so I turned around to\nscratch my bottom so nobody would see me\nbut the whole audience just ripped\nbecause kind of cute right this little\nso I I think my first fear was like I\nthink it like being on stage so I kind\nof you know I did um I did all the\nNational Youth Theater stuff in London I\ndid Youth Theater everything I could do\nat school was my sort of start and I was\njust constantly every time I did it like\nI used used to remember walking on stage\nand I'd be like my mom used to do this\nshe you can you know my mom had this one\nthing and she shake her fist at me says\na lot about\nmy um but she'd shake her F and say you\ncan do it you know and I so I had this\nthing and I'd sort of go and then I I\nwas quite um you know I was I was\nconfirmed in the Cathedral of Canterbury\nby the Archbishop of Canterbury because\nit was like where I from and stuff which\nkind of a big deal so religious practice\nwas always kind of a part of my life um\nso I'd always sort of say a prayer as\nwell and think and then kind of go out\nand do it and I'd like and it was like\nnever more focused than when I was on\nstage and that was a great feeling\nbecause otherwise I think I was\nstruggling in school to to to articulate\nmy thoughts or follow or continue my\nthought thread um so yeah I think fear\nfor me was that which is ironic because\nof course now I'm you know then I went\non to being an actor but but uh and also\nI have a you know I think at 16 I moved\nto London which was quite Young and I\nwas on my own to do my a levels and and\nit was when I was 16 that I met a\nBuddhist practice um so early yeah so I\nwas very young to meet a Buddhist\npractice and it was a philosophy and a\nand a and it is a religious practice but\nit's way more of a sort of philosophy\nand a almost like a Guide to Life if you\nlike for me what was it about it at 16\nthat resonated with you I\nthink that having left um the sort\ninstitutionalized schooling that you and\nI both recognized from London and\nEngland rather not London I was in\nCanterbury but I went to a private\nschool I had a pretty solid middle col\nucation but so it was like it was like\nthere was sort of uh you know Chapel\nevery morning Simson you know and so I\nhad a I had that sort of in me and I\nthink I really enjoyed that but when I\nmoved to London I didn't have I didn't\nfind a church or find a\ncommunity and it was when I was studying\nfor my a level that I realized um I\nneeded extra art for my sculpture exam\nwhich I hadn't thought thought through\nI'd given up art quite a young age I\njust didn't have a teacher that I didn't\njust it was unfortunate so I met through\nmy best friend I met an artist he\nintroduced me and I did extra classes\nand I'd sort of go back to Kent he was\nactually from Kent so I go down on the\nweekends and I'd he'd set me up in a\nroom and he'd say with an easel and he'd\nsay here just do this and I'd hear him\nin the other room and he'd be going\nnum and I'd be like just and and one day\nI just I I walked down so what are you\ndoing he goes I'm just I'm just chanting\nthat you're going to be really\nsuccessful in your exams you have a\nreally successful life I was like cool\nwell will it help he goes yeah I was\nlike great so I just got down on my\nknees I was\nlike and so David who is who I've known\nsince I'm like yeah maybe 17 16 or 17\nbut he he was he he is he he Shak abuk\nof me which is what we call in my\npractice where where somebody introduces\nyou to the practice so he is and he was\nwonderful because he he sort of at 16 I\nwas living in London and I was a real\nterror way I was like a club kid I was\nlike having a really good time\neverything was like you know I mean I\nwas I\nwasn't I don't want to mischaracterize\nmyself because in some ways I always\nknew what I wanted so I kind of had a\nsort of self discipline regulator almost\nI didn't go too far but I always pushed\nthe boundaries of what was I could do\nand I was having a really good time and\nand I was like and and I said\nwell you know he explained it in a very\nsort of simple way to me but it was like\nI was like well can I chant for these\nthings that I kind of you know like it\ncould have been anything and he was like\nyeah sure and sometimes it was like well\nI want to have a really good night and\nthis that and the other and and he was\nlike see what happens and and I would\nand sometimes I'd wake up with a really\nsore head and I'd be like oh okay so\nwords like integ Integrity wisdom\ncourage compassion things that were like\nwere started to come filtered at a young\nage into my into my thinking through\nalso the writings of isaku aada who's my\nmentor and so it was like it was just it\nwas this perfect moment for me because I\nthink I always wanted a road map I think\nthere's an art to living and for me this\nphilosophy is for me it's it's it's a\nit's a way for me to understand the art\nof living and I think it's really like\nthe law of cause and effect and I think\nall religions kind of mix and match and\nmeet the the the central core of all\npractices I think is is one of you know\ngood Goodwill I believe right but\nthere's almost like science like cause\nan effect what goes up must come down it\njust sort of it it worked for me as a as\nan idea and so yeah I became a but it\ntook me four years I I I shabuka my\nsister my best friend and it was like\nand they and one day my best friend goes\nwell I'm going to go and get gansen\ngohanson is this scroll that um we we\nchant to and uh I was like wait you what\nhe said I'm getting goano\nuh I uh and he'd been chanting for like\nmaybe I don't know 68 months and I was\nlike uh I was like okay I'll I'll join\nyou I'll do I was like I've been doing\nthis for four years and I hadn't all you\nknow years and I hadn't so yeah I became\na member of the sci which is the\norganization and that was yeah when I\nwas n a bit later because I'd started\nchanting but I just used to just I\nchanted and it was like it kept me in\nRhythm and and it and it was and that's\nreally for me it kept me in a flow it's\nlike the Rhythm of Life and\nin a way the when I was doing my uh my\nsculpture exam I remember I was painting\nlike a a whalebone and a lemon or a\npineapple like it was it was a well bur\nand and and like a some kind of piece of\nfruit and I was like I'd look at it I'd\nbe painting and it was a 15 hour still\nlife oil painting exam had a still life\ndrawing exam as well as the sculpture\nI'd go to the toilet be like come back\nand be\nlike and finished the painting and and I\nthink like yeah I I got the highest\ngrade and then and the they called and\nsaid we'd like to keep this work as the\nhighest grade for the country kind of\nthing as like like this is the bench and\nI was like I hadn't been doing art and I\nso I really tested it and it was you\nknow I think I think the power as you\nyou know you know when you set an\nintention and uh and at such a young age\nyou know for young people for young\npeople today I think having something\nlike a something that you can trust and\nI think you know I really admire I think\nit's hard to to have faith with the with\nthe chanting and with the practice or\nthe habit of that what was some of the\nmore philosophical lessons or principles\nthat kind of became anchors or accompass\nin your life at that time where there\ncertain teachings or lessons that stood\nout and you like oh these are going to\nform the principles that I'm going to\nlive by yeah um so many they Saku\nfortunately\nwell has has written extensively and\nit's very accessible for those who don't\nknow please tell us who so daaku Kor is\nis my mentor he was um he is he brought\nthis practice from Japan around the\nworld it was um you know it was in in\nthe 60s he I think he he he is when he\nleft Japan and traveled first to Hawaii\nand um the founding members of this\npractice and many of whom are wonderful\nJapanese women who have been have been a\nliving around the world and but he\nbrought this practice to\n193 countries I think now his mentor\nJose TOA and before that machuki Jose\nto's mental\nmachuki um in the 60s in Japan um\nbrought this practice forward and\ndaaka really made it accessible he wrote\nextensively he he's written a book about\nhis book about his life is written from\na uh another perspective it's like it's\nhim but it's written as a another person\nisn't would you say third person well if\nit's not the same if it's it's him but\nit's not it's he's got a pseudo name for\nwho it is yeah yeah right so he but it's\njust it's I think there are so many\nideas within the\npractice but at its core it's like I\njust find that through chanting you say\nnam I devote myself to the Mystic law of\ncause and effect through the vibration\nof sound and the sound is now\nm m is the title of the Lotus Sutra and\nas you may or may not know but yeah you\nknow shakuni or Buddha the Buddha Sid\nArthur the um he wrote sutras meaning\nteachings and in the last eight years of\nhis life it was the Lotus Sutra before\nhe passed that he sort of proclaimed as\nthe teaching that would lead all living\nbeings to Enlightenment in this lifetime\nand so that's why we chant Nam m m being\nalso the title of the Lotus Sutra and\nthen I cite two chapters from the uh\nexpedient means and the lifespan chapter\nfrom theota Sutra which is part of this\npractice which is beautifully Japanese\nbecause um it traveled from India\nthrough the silk Paws and and landed in\nJapan and it was Nishan dionin who was a\num in the in\n1270s 1270 around then so you call that\nthe 13th century um he he propagated the\nteacher and he brought this teaching to\nthe world at that time so he he he\nenshrined in Sumi Inc the gansam which\nis as I sort of said that scroll that I\nchant to he inscribed it with sui ink\nand he gave because he recognized that\nsort of humans needed uh something uh a\nmandala something to to to look at and\nreally it's like it's like polishing my\nmirror so I excuse my ADD bra but is\nlike polishing my mirror so I think\nabout when I chant I think about they in\nIndia it was like bronze mirror and you\npolish it and then you see your\nreflection right so the more I chant the\nmore I see my reflection and then I see\nthe things or or like a it's like a a\ntea leaf a GL a glass of tea and I'm\nlike stirring away and it comes to the\nsurface and you do chanting and I think\nas you get older and I have you know two\nbeautiful children and you realize that\nlike it's sort of I think death is a big\npart of life and it's something that\nwe uh some people can be very\nuncomfortable with or challenged by and\nwe're mystically you know\nhere for such a short period of time\nrelative to everything and this practice\nis like kind of constantly preparing\nyou and it's sort of so the obstacles\nthat you see in life because of\nessentially you know what the way that\nI've learned through my practices that\nwe're born We Grow Old we'll get sick\nand we'll die and so will everyone\naround us and hopefully nobody we love\ntoo soon but the truth is you will lose\nand there is and I think that when you\nyou can see the obstacles in your life\nand it may be just waking up in the\nmorning and getting a bill that you\ncan't afford to pay or you know for\nsomebody or when you when you take the\nobstacles in your life as the\nopportunities for your growth when you\nwhen you reframe it as oh wow because\nthe truth is at least my truth through\nmy practice is that we're never not\ngoing to have opportunity uh obstacles\nright and it's just how we see those\nobstacles and whether they become our\nbenefit so it's like pain a a canvas\nright like when I broke my back or when\nI had you know near-death experiences\nand or you know experiences I say about\na few kind of interesting things in my\nlife or a heartbreak or a heart reveal\nor you know something that happened in\nschool or things like those are the deep\ncolors in your canvas otherwise\neverything's sort of like plain nice you\nknow and you want those Rich textures\nright or at least I do so I find I found\nthat um that that you know the practice\nhas given me\nthe the sort of the pathway and and by\nthe way I am\nlike I I I intentionally sabotage myself\nyou know what I mean I mean I literally\nI'm like I'm like I'm not chanting I I\nhav't chanted because I'm like I get in\nmy own way you know I'm far from like\nI'm like literally you know and I get\npicked up on it by by friends I keep a I\nhave a very you know I have David and my\nbest friend Mark and Chris Chris who's\nin the show actually I call\ngibo um we all practice and so we kind\nof keep each other kind of accountable a\nlittle bit as well but but as you get\nolder you know I think you you know you\nprobably experience in in in your own\nway but it becomes so much harder you\nknow just to keep that kind of that\nfaith in everything because because but\nit's been for me that it's been I think\nI was such a young age to get it yeah\nyou know I know people who are born into\nit because you know their parents you\nknow were were so and that's like this\nyou know Fortune baby I call they it and\nthat's so bless you know such a bling\nbut um but the eight wins is something\nthat Nish shonin wrote this book I\ndidn't intend this to be a I love it\nit's beautiful I'm just like riffing\nbeautiful he wrote he wrote he wrote The\nGo show and and it's like letters to his\ndisciples and it's crazy because they're\nlike they're written in 12 20 1270s\nsomething they're in the 13th century\nbut they're so weirdly current like it's\na bit because it's like there's a\nsamurai sh shingo Kingo who I kind of\nlike see myself as like maybe I was you\nknow like I have this like nice idea of\nwho he was but like he had he had shared\nthe practice with his master and his\nmaster was like given him all these\nlands and then all these other Samurai\nwere jealous and so they're like they\ntore his character down and he was\nbanished and then he managed to kind of\ncome back because of his practice and\ncommunicate to his Lord and it kind of\nworked but it's like we know that story\nit happens in every office or in every\ncity or at least you know we've heard it\ntime and time again so they're so sort\nof current and relative but absolutely\nwhy that eight wins is a really great um\nis one that I grew up a wise man is not\nswayed by the eight wins a praise\ncensure honor\ndisgrace um pleasure suffering\nProsperity\nDecline and you know W that that is\nreally powerful you know and that was\none that just like for me it was like\nyou know just I don't think I've I think\nI've been swayed many a many a time how\ndoes one not get swayed by praise and\nwhat was the second word praise and\ncensure so the opposite yes yeah yeah\nexactly yeah so how does one not get\nswayed yeah I think I think as a as a as\na young man and I don't like I feel I'm\nyoung at heart so I kind like you look\nyoung some years ago um you know when I\nwas like when it was when I was what I\nfeel like really in the eye of the storm\nand just like my whole life was just\nlike tabloid fod in some ways it felt\nlike um constantly and anything I did I\nthink that was really challenging for me\nit was like and I I I don't think I\nhandled I don't think I didn't have any\nkind kind of major meltdowns but like I\nwas really upset about how my character\nfelt like it was being dragged actually\nit's why I started an Instagram big\naccount which I did some I started very\nlate in the game but I only did it\nbecause actually my partner Katie had\nsaid it's a really good way to gather\nthe reins and create a narrative and\nlike now I know it's like I don't know\nhow many people even really use there's\nso many different new app\nthings media platforms you know but\nin a way it kind of was able it sort of\nhelped me to kind of create my own\nnarrative at least and to put messaging\nout that I felt was you know reflected\nmy whole my my ideas and views you know\nwhich obviously are mostly very Cent\ncentered around my practice um and daak\naada really his writings I love seeing\nyou person about daada it's of my some\nhe says some one he has he has\nphenomenal well beautiful things and so\nyeah you know so I think um I just I\njust kind of my practice definitely\nhelped me with that it was definitely\nanchoring I think um I think I kind of I\ngot very good at\nhiding which I would never encourage and\nif you know but in a way I kind of like\nI got very good at putting a hat on and\ngoing moving through the world without\nand you\nknow if I could go back I would probably\nsay to that kid like you know what shine\nit bro just\nbe you're here to make mistakes and if\nthey're public or private you know\nthey're the mistakes that you will\nthat's that deep purple in your canvas\nyeah just it's it's not really how you\ngo down it's how you get up right so and\ntrust your heart you know trust that\nyou're in the in in the flow and that's\nthat's something that I don't think I\nhad a lot of you know as a kid so as you\nas you as you move on you just go well\nthe noise just eventually subsides and\nnow I'm like have a perspective on it\njust from years and I'm\nlike it's it's\nit's it's it's it's helped to know you\nknow and like I think it's but that was\nit was definitely through chanting that\nI I think and my practice and friends\nand the community that I had around me\nat the time and and also being on the\nroad and working so much I think I just\ndidn't most of it was just like uh\nhardly didn't really look at it didn't\nreally pay attention but yeah hearing\nyou say that I mean what's beautiful is\nthat it often feels like so many of\nthese lessons can only be lived and\nunderstood when they're lived but it's\nhelpful to know the lesson you're\nlearning and how it fits in it's almost\nlike you had to go through that you\ncouldn't have asked yourself to deal\nwith it better or do better at the time\nno no but the fact that you had\nthis lesson philosophy practice to yeah\nback on or to like kind of understand\nlook at give me perspective for sure\nthat was a massive blessing yeah yeah\nwhen you're talking about fears and your\nfirst fear all the way through to this\nobviously when you watch the show\nthere's this feeling of the external\nfear right like the idea of jumping out\nof a plane the idea of rock climbing the\nall of these things are naturally\ninherently scary right right what's the\ninternal fear when you're doing it like\nwhat is the dialogue that's going on\nbecause obviously you're quite a\nreflective thoughtful individual what\nwhat's really the fear because it\nobviously isn't jumping out the plane\nfor you yeah I think it comes back to\ntrust and faith right and and selfworth\nright there are protocols that you\nfollow like all of these like adrenaline\njunkie athletes that you see you know\nmaybe posting a 15c clip on on a on a\nsocial media page have spent their lives\nand potentially weeks days years\nhours\nto perect effect whatever it's you're\nseeing for a 15c\nmoment and you know like Luke\nAkins jumped from like the stratosphere\nwithout a parachute Landing in a net\nCamila Jabba who is who who was my free\ndiving uh coach along with Will tuich\nwho was who who who runs this um\nvertical blue competition in in the\nBahamas where I was diving\nSupreme athletes who you know Camila has\nSwan to she's the Mexican world record\nholder of like 18 80 plus meters now\nthat's a you know I I think I got to 37\nm in about the four days which was like\naund few and I was really struggling\nbecause of my mask I had I think I I\nwish I'd not worn a mask I wish I just\nlike had goggle like you have these I\nwish I I'd thought that through cuz but\nI had some with equalizing\nbut you know Andor mock who's this\nadaptive\nclimber who just you know was born with\none hand and uh started climbing as a\nchild and just you know is the woman in\nher field doing what she does and it's\nlike a glass heart you know it's just\nit's just overflowing these people are\njust overflowing but what it is is that\nthey are experts and they it is a life\nchoice almost right so in a way like\npeople have said to me oh have you gone\nback to doing the free the the wings\nsuiting or the and I'm like I really\ncan't wait to do that but it's like it's\nnot something you just P dip in and out\nof you know it's a real lifestyle choice\nand it's a commitment and it's it's\nsomething that gives you excellence and\nI think the so so trusting in that\nmoment that everything you trusting\nmyself for me it was about becoming\ncapable right in a way like\nlike learning to follow the protocols\nlearning to be present enough to take on\nboard everything that's being told to me\nso that I can apply it to the moment\nthat I'm in so when I'm in the plane and\nabout to jump and I'm really and I'm I\nuh you know I think the to be fair I\nthink the climbing I got such potty\nmouth on the climing because I was so\nfrustrated and terrified by the by the\ngear by the KN SPID whether I tied it\nright or whether the Rope was going to\nhold me or whether I was going to and\nmostly because actually I had Mo's life\nof my hands right like so but it was I\nthink becoming\ncapable and having that like education\nand then being accountable for myself so\nin the moment where the fear is really\nkicking in it's just trusting like kind\nof coming back to what everything I've\nlearned from my practice was trust in\nyour life having faith in your life I\nthink faith is a is so important and I\nthink misguided faith is sometimes so\nchallenging for us as a as a as a as a\nspecies because it's led to so much\nheartbreak and and conflict but actually\nI really admire people of Faith because\nmost people of faith if it's not\nmisguided are really doing everything\nthey can and because it's my Buddhist\npractice we try to be respectful of all\nFaith you know I kind of feel like I\nknow my path is the right one I wish\neveryone would join me on this but I but\nI totally respect that everybody has\ntheir path and I think that's what it\ncomes down right respect so it's like a\nbit of it the whole show was a bit of a\nhuman experiment for me and I think the\nexperiment and the lessons that I\ncontinually Learned was a bit of like\nself-respect becoming capable trusting\nmy life and trusting that this was part\nof an important and necessary part of my\nlife and I after all I'd chosen to do it\nyou know and I could find myself at\ntimes in these like super challenging\nphys physically challenging moments\nmentally physically and emotionally they\nwere all totally different so you know\nlike Wing suiting just was it's super\nunnatural to jump out of a plane and\nthen I think what Luke said to me was\nthat I'm probably the first person to\nhave jumped at 26 jumps so 25 jumps I\ngot my my my my a license for skydiving\nand my 26 jump was in a Wings suit but\nhe had me on this trajectory but he knew\nfrom what he was watching and you know\nwe were working every day for yeah you\nknow a few not even that long but um but\nhe knew that I was capable to it so the\nthe free\ndiving I just didn't know if I was going\nto come back up I was like wait what\nwhat if I because I had and I think I\nwas emotionally really challenged by\nthis idea like respecting my life you\nknow treasuring my life because I think\nin some ways in my youth treasuring my\nlife valuing my life understanding the\nvalue of life and being grateful for it\nin a very profound way like I think I\nhave you know a stadium of Angels or\nBuddhas or however whoever you want to\ncall them but um and with climbing it\nwas like I'd find myself in these\nmoments as I said I'd be like I'd be\nlike I'm really having a hard time here\nand I would with you know I'd have I had\nthis um one of my assistants who became\na producing partner who was working with\nfor so long who knew me so well but I\nwould just be like freaking out she\ncould see I was freaking out but I was\nfreaking out but about something like\nwhy am I wearing this t-shirt what does\nthis t-shirt mean you know what I mean\nit was so so interesting how the mind\nright it's like you become you know what\nI mean instead of\njust getting in your you know I became\nvery um I was like trying to control\ncontrol the control the environment\ncontrol the things because I felt so out\nof control like this t-shirt is not the\nright t-shir or whatever it might be you\nknow it was like for me it didn't it\ncould have been anything but it was like\nbecause I needed to control whatever I\nhad Poss you know on me because I felt\nso kind of out of control in some ways\nso it was a human I felt like it was a\nhuman experiment honestly I was like I\nwas like how much does it take for me to\ncrack you know how much pressure before\nI and what does that look like in some\nways um so but in a way like you know\nthat was the you know I kept coming back\nto\nNam you know you you what is meant for\nyou is not going to go away right it's\nnot and this is but it's also it was my\nfirst time in an unscripted world right\nyeah you know I think because of the\nnature of my\nupbringing dyslexia and education that\nwas such a challenge although I got it\nall did it all um this is trusting yeah\nmy heart right you're trusting your\nexperience right I mean that's what\nyou've done so well\nyouve like you're able to communicate\nfrom the heart listen be present and you\nknow what I mean and come in with the\nwith the points that like like oh wow\nyou're you're actually absorbing and and\ntaking that on and I think and and\nsharing and putting a message out but\nit's sometimes hard for people you know\nespecially I think you know when you're\nyounger yeah I mean I I think what I'm\nlistening to you right now these adap\nare great my mind is firing I'm like I'm\nhave more of this good I'm glad we'll\nget you another are you finished that\none do you want another one\nwhen I'm listening to you right now and\nI really appreciate you going there\nbecause of course the external is hard\nbut I love how you boiled it down to\nthat idea of trying to control the\nlittle you think you can control in the\nmidst of the fact that you can't control\nany of this and it's interesting how\nthat is such a great metaphor for life\nsomehow yeah because we're all trying to\ncontrol everything we can control and\nwhat we can't control not recognizing\nthat so much is outside of our control\nand that makes us in life feel helpless\nand it can often make us Retreat and\nhide and disappear but when you're\nclimbing a mountain you can't disappear\nlike you can't Retreat from that right\nit's almost like you have to sit in that\ndiscomfort and you have to sit with that\nemotion which is actually what real life\nis demanding of us but we find a way to\nkind of hide it push it away deal with\nit yeah and so it's it's the most\nphysical real way I I remember when this\nis why I think you're hopefully the show\nwill you know encourage people to do we\nall have something that's uncomfortable\nfor us whether it's internal or external\nand I think everyone needs a friend who\nencourages them to do some extreme\nsports now and again my wife needs less\nencouragement than I do I as as life has\ngone on I've become a bit more reserved\nand I had a friend a couple of years ago\nwho made me do skydiving who made me do\ncrazy things with him and I was really\ngrateful for that because it made me\nrealize how many blocks I had up here\nthat I was unaware\nI thought I'd conquered so many blocks\nbut there was still so many so much lack\nof trust and so much lack\nof that feeling of oh actually I can sit\nin discomfort I was almost trying to get\naway from discomfort because at one\npoint in my life I'd put myself through\nso much of it and now just wanted to be\nin a comfortable space which is fair\nfair but but one thing you say in the\ndocu series kind of in the beginning was\nthis idea of you say being on the edge\nmakes me feel most alive but then at the\nsame time I see you as someone who\nreally values the little things dayto\nday and obviously with your Buddhist\npractice is Mindful and present how do\nyou reconcile the two because you know\nif you're feeling all this adrenaline\nand this extreme SPO and that makes you\nfeel alive but then how do you also feel\nalive in the tiny moments and maybe\nbeing with your kids or yeah yeah being\nwith blue as we just your beautiful dog\nthat we just with now thank you yeah I\nthink you know it's such good questions\nI think to let\ntwo things and I want to come back to\nthat question but I think in a way like\nwhat are the parts of the show is like\nwhat did it take for me to\nbe remarkably present look I'm I'm one\nof the most privileged people I consider\nmyself the experiences that I've had in\nthe world at a at in life I feel just so\ngrateful all the time I wake up feeling\ngrateful and you know I feel you know\nthat partly that's my practice to giving\nme the opportunity but\nfor some people it's like look just\ngetting up from the couch and going to\nthe kitchen what does it take for them\nto do that I know through Co which was\nthe idea was like what does it take for\nthat person just to go to the park just\nstep outside take your shoes off socks\noff stand in the grass and look at the\ntrees and just that may be all it takes\nbut it may be so challenging for one\nperson for that person so like yes for\nme you know when I was kind of raw\ndogging it with my all my kind of ADD\nand just things happening I was just\nlike in it I say that because i' when I\nsay raw doggy I mean I was just like\nI've subsequently found like a really\namazing like peptide which is fantastic\nthat's helped me really kind of connect\nmy thoughts at times cuz sometimes it's\nreally disjointed but in a way I love\nthat about my thinking because it kind\nof is sporadic but um for some people as\nI said the the the hope for the show for\nme was like it took me okay for me who\nyou know\narguably throughout my life has\nreally um you know love the thrill like\nif I'm going really fast either on a\nmotorcycle or in a car or whatever it\nmight be I feel like I'm more focused\nlike I'm more likely to have an accident\nat 30 mil an hour than I am 60 mil hour\nyou know because I'm just there's a I\nswitch into some other mode and it's\nkind of true for everything I've done in\nmy life like if I'm if if the if if it's\nreally up against me then I'm going to\nI'm going to step pop in a whole other\nway like for example one the Rings where\nI was like my first movie really and I'm\nwith Ian McKellen and Ian Holm and\nChristopher Lee and Vio mortinson and\neven Elijah who I'd seen in movies and\nyou know like these amazing actors all\nof whom had so much experience and it\nwas an amazing gift but it was also like\nokay step up you know and the blessing\nof that um so I think you kind of take\nthat high of these insane things that\nyou're doing but it's all\nreally like Rel relevant to the like\nsometimes I can wake up in the morning\nand I just can't figure out even which\nway to go you know I'm like I can feel\nlike I'm like wait what I'm so grateful\nbut wait where what am I my brain is\nlike it's like trying to bring it\nonline and it can and it can be really\noverwhelming in terms of you\nknow so it's\nlike back to chance back to breath back\nto presence back to Stillness back to\ngratitude back to\nlike I had\nthis I think I I think I had this kind\nof really remarkable plant Journey\nmedicine Journey mhm and you know I I I\nset an intention around the feminine cuz\nwe touched on my mother briefly and I\nwas like you know my mother gave me this\nwhich is wonderful and loved me\nwholeheartedly and was in boarding\nschool at the age of four so was like\nshe's didn't really have a full you\nknow sense of what nurture and things\nwas but she was so love is and remains\nso loving and a great opportunity for me\nto continue to grow and evolve but I set\nan intention before I was like\nbecause I'd wanted to ask Katie to marry\nme and I was like I just need to kind of\ncheck in and I'd never done you know\nthis particular medicine and I was like\nI want to just so I I flew somewhere to\nmeet this and I and I'd set this\nintention around the feminine right and\nI was like and basically the three\npoints that came out I was like am I\nclean am I good here can I do move\nforward with this because it's important\nto me um to know that I'm clear\nright and uh\nand so it's with a right so you get this\nfeeling of and somebody had explained to\nme you have this amazing feminine energy\ncoming at you and\nuh think you're supposed to do three\ncups and I took\nfive well I wanted to have this this\nthis I was just waiting I was there and\nI didn't I was just on a couch with this\namazing room of musicians and this\nwonderful\nguide and he just looked at me at 6:00\nin the morning and he was he had been\njourneying with me and he was like you\nwant more and I was like one\nmore and then I had this like sensation\nof lightness and this I think basically\nit's like our minds right you like\nyou're exploring aspects of your mind\nthat the neurop pathways that you just\nhaven't like looked at right you\nunderstand that it's the map of your\nmind right that's kind of and you've\ndisconnected your ego enough to be\nhumble enough to take on and I and this\nmessage was well first of\nall just be grateful look at your life\nright second of\nall you don't have an issue with women\nyou know look at your life wonderful\nwomen in your life and even if even if\nthere are aspects of women in your life\nthat you have it's all been part of your\nEvolution um but maybe the feminine in\nyou it was like she was you know there\nwas this there was this like so maybe\nyou could nurture a bit more of the\nfeminine in you right and I was like\nokay but it was like nurture I guess the\ncreative artistic side the just like\npondering and poetical and things that I\nhadn't and then but the last one that I\nremember that was so it was like\nwhenever you're with somebody it may be\nthe last time you see them again you\njust don't know so make it great\nwhatever you got to lose you may never\nsee this person again we don't know life\nis like you don't know M so just make it\ngreat cuz at a young age I'd had a real\nchallenge I'd have people come at me\nconsistently right and I'd be like and\nI'd be in whatever mental state or\nmoment that I was in and sometimes I\njust like you know I mean you know and\nand all they want is this moment and\nit's so easy for me to just go hey yeah\nphoto sure yeah he that no problem and\nthen carry on but sometimes it was just\nlike you know I could it felt like\nalmost acid because I was just it didn't\nwhat it represented at a different time\nin my life was was a restriction right\nand I wanted to feel free but I think\nthat moment of that thing for me was\nlike you may never see this person again\nyou don't know life is not built like\nthat so just make it great it's not hard\nright or at least leave it with that you\nknow\nso I think that was the did I answer the\nquestion yeah yeah I know I mean so much\nyou gave me so much more to unpack that\nI love it I mean on on that point I do\nthink if we lived in a world where you\ngenuinely believed that any moment with\nanyone could be your last yeah the way\nyou'd speak to them the way you'd look\nat them the way you listen to them would\njust transform and I'm sure you have\nfriends I I have friends who've lost\nparents Partners people and they all\nregret their last conversation with them\nbecause it was conflict or it was an\nargument or it was a debate that they\ndidn't need to have theyve been in\nConflict who knows yeah yeah and they\nand they didn't know that that was going\nto be the last time and I've spoken to\nfriends who've who've held that for so\nmuch longer because it becomes such a\nhard release to know that you could have\nshould have would have said something\ndifferent might have done it differently\nmight have done it differently but going\nback to what was revealed to you and and\neven that I mean I look at relationship\nas such a area where so many of our\nfears are brought to the surface I found\nthis with my own wife like we've been\ntogether for 11 years and married for\neight what's the secret and it's this\nit's it's being comfortable with the\nidea that she is also the deepest mirror\nI'll ever have right because no one in\nthe world sees all of my flaws all of my\nmistakes all the moments when I'm not\nperfect\nyou know I always joke about how like my\nwife knows whether I meditate this\nmorning or not like no one else does but\nmy wife knows and my wife knows whether\nit was quality or whether it's\ndistracted my wife knows whe you know my\nwife knows whether I left my socks on\nthe floor you know whatever just whether\nit's silly or deep it's it's she is in a\nposition and when your partner doesn't\nabuse that Authority and doesn't use it\nas a form of control yeah right but\nactually reflects\nback some care and compassion\nit it can be a really it's it's almost\nlike you can't grow without it have you\nwhat have what have you what scared you\nabout relationships and what like you\nsaid you had no problem with women that\nwasn't a thing but what was revealed to\nyou in your\nrelationship yeah um what's been\nrevealed to you in your relationship is\na better question I think I think um I'm\nconstantly\nlearning to let\ngo okay because anything that I try to\nhold on to whether it's good or\nbad doesn't serve me not in the\nrelationship and it doesn't really serve\neither of us and that's really hard to\nkeep letting go and to keep letting her\ngo you know the idea of Cu I think when\nyou're in a deeply loving committed\nrelationship you want to you want to\ncontrol or own or have\nor and you know even just letting go of\nideas of how things should be or the\nidea of what intimacy or intimate\nmoments are to you versus them or how\nyou know whatever it may be because\neverybody because you've chosen that\nperson they're on a journey with that\nperson you know you're going to learn\nthis\nlesson and if you've chosen that person\nthen that's the person you're going to\nlearn that lesson with you I mean that's\nthe opportunity\nright\nthat's yeah that's that that really\nresonates I I feel like that's why we'd\nrather let go of the person and have a\nnew six-month period with someone new\nbecause you don't have to let go in that\nsix months like that six months is\nalmost full of holding on and every idea\nand every hope and possibility remains\nintact like you don't have to dism\nmantle it or question it or break it\ndown but you are so right that the\namount of misconceptions I've had to let\ngo of as we spend more time together and\nI think it it's going to change every\nday right absolutely it's like every day\nyou choose I choose you yeah you know\nbecause also you know your wife is\nchanging right seven years from now\nshe's be completely different human yeah\nyou have no idea right you know you can\nI mean you you you clearly have been\naround each other and you do probably KN\nknow have a sense but we don't know you\ndon't know it's the same thing as like I\nmay never see that person again yeah\nevery day may you may never see that\nversion of that person again or you know\nwhatever it may be but like yeah we're\njust you know we have we I'm\nforced I I I seize the\nopportunity every day to grow and as you\nsee from the show I'll never choose the\nuh the pass the easy path you know like\nit's just not I am yeah and you know in\nsome ways my\nrelationship is the greatest opportunity\nfor my continual growth and you know and\nI know we both see it that way so that's\nhow we grow and we do and she will not\nyou know she'll hold me accountable and\nI'll do the same and sometimes you know\nyou'll be confronted by your own self\nyou know MH and I think you know\nyeah trust right trusting your path your\njourney your faith your that this is\nwhat's meant for you mhm and then you\nknow the universe will take care of the\nrest and and making mistakes and going\nokay I did that was yeah did that\nsorry I I I sort of am\nlike there's no yeah I think I think\nI've you know seen how learning more\nlike the mistake I think like I I think\nvery early on in life actually weirdly I\ndidn't enjoy making mistakes does\nanybody I don't know maybe some people\nreally do but I I didn't I wasn't\ncomfortable with with messing it be hard\nto find someone who enjoyed making\nmistakes yeah and yet anyone any Sage\nyou're worthy will tell you it's not\nit's only through mistakes that you grow\nright so it's like going\nokay you know like that's where the\nwhere the that's where the rich stuff is\nthat's where you're going to so I just\ntry to keep growing um and you know\naccepting and you\nknow yeah how how does it feel to\nintroduce your Buddhist practices and\nteachings to the kids like how does that\nwork I'm fascinated by well yeah I\nreally I just I say to Daisy and she I\nshe sometimes on the other side of the\nworld on a movie she'll be like I\nsay um he I think and Flynn chanted you\nknow from I did the same with him and I\ndon't like so Flynn's mother has a\nbeautiful faith in life I think and I\nreally respect it and I don't challenge\nany of the things his views that he's\nobviously imbued through his mother and\num you know I I I we we we love to go on\nwalks I love to go on walks with my son\nand and we talk a lot I try to you know\nand at different stages look he's 13 now\nso it's almost like dad is getting\npushed aside I kind of know what that\nfeels like I was the same you know so\nI'm not I try not to take it personally\nand I miss him and I'm like I just text\nhim I love him and I miss him but but we\nhave these wonderful walks and talks and\nI kind of just throughout whatever we're\nsaying I try to keep reinforcing just\nthe the the the undercurrent philosophy\nand thinking of my practice and and and\nwhich is just you know are you are you\nrespecting are you are you you know if\nthere is that kid in class who's not you\nknow are you are you supporting that kid\nthat's not getting the support because\nthat's where you'll find the richness\nright because I I kind of like I know\nthat's in his heart as well I see it\nand funny he said to me dad you know I'm\nreally good at just bluffing and I think\nlike but this is him at 13 you know\nflexing a bit in his way of trying to\nlike trying to kick he was like yeah but\nDad I just knew that would that would be\nthe thing that people would I'm like\ngood well just keep working that then\nyeah because even if your thinking will\ntry and make you say you're going to do\njust keep working that even if it's even\nif you think it's like you're putting on\na show fake it till you make it you know\nwhat I mean just keep doing the just\nkeep trying to do the right thing and\neventually you'll start to realize what\nthe right thing is right but I love to\nwalk and talk with him and and and I I\njust don't overwhelm him with it because\nin in my faith I Believe by saying say\nto me Nam Namo\nyooo r\nr n\nso by saying this once you never have to\nsay it again you protected Seven\nGenerations in your past and seven\ngenerations in your future thank you for\nthat gift that's beautiful so I believe\nthat deeply believe that and I believe\nso sometimes I will just walk up to\nsomebody and say just say Nam your name\nV kill just once and I'll tell them that\nand then I'll walk away whatever and\nit'd be like I believe that it's like\nfinding a a needle in the either haast\nthat and if you so you never have to do\nit again you've done it seven\ngenerations pass I'll see every time I\nsee you now and if you ever good yeah\nand if you ever and if it was something\nthat resonated with you at the time or\nat moment then great I you know I\nencourage people to do that it's not you\nknow I'm like well this is how you do it\njust it's not a it's not a meditational\nprocess right like a meditation I do as\nwell having meditation TM practice but\nfor me it's like yoga for the mind you\nknow it's like when I'm really stressed\nout or I feel like you know that too\nmuch coffee you ever get really stressed\nout seems so like Jo yeah I'm no this\nI'm sitting here opposite Jay shed do\nyou want me to show you the other side\nof me no I mean like you can see you'll\nsee the climbing episode you'll see the\npart you see the party mouth and the I'm\nlike no I'm like a red line I'm like I\nreally like mostly I'm like I can really\nyou know I can be in the red like um and\nthat's something that that I just try to\nnavigate but I like that I embrace it I\naccept it absolutely you know what I\nmean it's like can be on in that space\nit's like it's like the difference\nbetween driving at 30 or 60 it's like\nobviously I would you know God forbid\nyou want to observe the speed limit\nbecause there are children and things\nbut like I know what you know so\nsometimes I can be really intense how\nhave you how have you accepted the parts\nof yourself that most of us judge\ncriticize or feel uncomfortable granted\nthat they're not affecting other people\nfrom I think um because of that practice\nI'm constantly looking at that but I\nthink I think it's time honestly and I\nthink it's experience MH because the\nexperiences have taught me like\nthat you\nknow shame is not my friend guilt shame\nif you spend any if you if you overly if\nyou spend too much time in that negative\nthought pattern\nyou know we're like energy we're like\nlittle planets right but if you broke\nour bodies down I was having this\nconversation with somebody who was\ngiving me a massage the other night\nshe's this amazing woman and she was\nlike but we're like little we're like\nlittle galaxies if you actually\ndissolved us the the trillions and\nbillions of you know you know cells\ncells and everything it's like a little\nit's like a little Galaxy so we're all\nlittle galaxies going around the planet\nright in a way mhh so all of that energy\nwhich as you know and talked about many\ntime but it's like it's whatever you're\nsaying you become right as we all know\nthese all these old adages are so true\nso it's not like but so yeah it's I\nthink for me it's like I the shame game\ndoesn't work I don't want to I don't\nwant to receive it from anyone I mean I\ndid this I had this amazing experience\nand I went six years ago maybe seven\nyears ago now seven years ago more than\nseven years ago nearly eight years ago I\nwent to the Hoffman Institute which is\nwonderful yes and it was um I'd had a\nreally I'd been seeing k for a year and\ni' broken up and then we sort of no we\nhadn't actually we'd broken up yet I'd\nbeen seeing her for for for a little\nwhile and then we had broken up and we\ngot back together you know the Young\nLove weirdness of trying to find things\nand but I I'd been triggered into this\nreally unique pattern of behavior that I\nfelt I'd inherited from my mom right\nthis thing of like seeing I'm here you\nknow with my I'm over here you know I\nthink why you know what I mean and\ntrying to get the attention right and I\nI I was like oh one of the worst years\ninternally I can ever remember because I\nfelt like I was playing a part instead\nof being a part and I was just cuz I had\nso many\nfeelings and I was so and I was in water\nthat was\nUncharted so um a dear friend of mine\nBuddhist had um an actor friend from New\nYork had had suggested that I do this\ntwo years ago and I hadn't picked up on\nit James leine this amazing actor human\njust wonderful\nperson and I was\nlike I sort of remembered when I we'd\nhad this breakup and I'd remembered I'd\ntaken my passport left everything else\nand walked into New York because we'd\nbeen in New York and then I was like got\non a plane home but before I got on a\nplane home I went to his house cuz it\nwas like 5 in the morning when we had\nthis rip roaring AR again and I was like\ntook my passport and walked out the door\nand I was like and he had talked about\nit and so I I did this\ncourse and I left with these three\nthinking and it was it was a wonderful\nweek where you don't have your phone you\ndon't have the email you have so you\nhave no connection to the outside world\nreally and you don't and people you know\nobviously I was me but I had this\nnobody's there for that so it's really\npeople are on their own they're all in\ntheir own form of need so I was wearing\nlike a a name tag that was my childhood\nname or whatever and then I did seven\ndays of like I guess kind of like a\ngroup therapy and it felt like three\nyears of therapy in seven days in a way\nand they take you on this beautiful\njourney through these seven days where\nyou have\nlike a Thanksgiving dinner a Christmas\ndinner a birthday and a whole thing from\nit's like it's beautiful the way it's\nconstructed and I came out with this\nthinking and I talked to James at that\ntime about this as well of feeling safe\nseen and celebrated I want to feel safe\nso in in terms of my relationship so\nwith self first right so if I look in\nthe mirror I feel safe do I feel safe\nwith you today do I feel seen by you am\nI kind of observing myself and do I feel\ncelebrated right but really it's for my\nthe people in my life like do I feel\nsafe with this person do I feel seen by\nthis person and and I feeling celebrated\nand can I do that for them obviously\nright it's a it's a it's a mirror so if\nI'm feeling that\nway then you're good it's a green light\nand if I'm not then I'm going to just\nstep back take pause until I can feel\nthat way and if I can't feel that way\nthen maybe life in the universe\nwill take us on different\ntrajectories but whilst I feel that way\nso safe scen and celebrated was\nsomething that really made\nme kind of go I came back into my life\nand into my relationship after\nthis and then I said we were SE we\nseparated it was interesting\nand I was\nlike looked off I was like okay this is\nwhat's meant you know this is some years\nago now\nyeah but this this stickiness that we\nhad this connection and she\nwas never really not a part of my\nthoughts um and she would reach out in\nweird ways like Instagram or whatever\nand I'd be\nlike processing and I was like so and\nthen I I made a sort of decision because\nI had this safe scene celebrated thing\nnot to to see her unless she would and\nthen she she actually did this this\nHoffman as well W and had an amazing\nexperience herself wow and so we just\nkind of I think it was like the it\ncreated a foundation so we're constantly\nsort of bouncing off this thing and\nsometimes the foundation's really Rocky\ncourse um and sometimes I don't know you\nknow sometimes is this are we is the\nuniverse are we still gr I I gave her\nthis picture of a tree you know and I\nwas like and it was it was just\nbeautiful bought it in India I think but\nit was this this these two trees growing\nas one I was like this is this is what\nit should be right as long as we we can\nthe dra the branches can go all over the\nplace but the roots and the and the and\nthe base of the tree is the trunk is\ngrowing together you know it's the it's\nthe pillars of the temple right yes you\nneed them to stand strong together so\nthat you can hold the you know hold that\nbut I yeah it's it's it's been a yeah\nthat's great criteria though I like that\nsafe seen and celebrated yeah it's like\na a beautiful way\nof checking and connecting wavelength\nyes the visual you just painted right\nnow of the two trees feels perfect like\nthat visual just resonated so strongly\nsometimes people are not up for that as\nwell though you know sometimes they're\nnot ready for that she like I it can be\nreally overwhelming it can be really\noverwhelming all of your good intention\nright all of your desire for the\ngreatest outcome can be super\nintimidating and overwhelming depending\non whether your wife is ready yes in\nthat day in that moment and as we as we\nknow from you know the remarkable you\nknow I I I had this thought I was like\nwhen I had Daisy my daughter I was like\nI mean I feel like every man should have\na daughter before they get married in a\nway because it's like you see every\nemotion Under the Sun yeah in a split\nsecond and it's like and you have\nnothing but love because you're there\nthere's no judgment there's just like\nI'm just like marveling at her explosion\nof emotion and she'll be like no daddy\nno dad Mommy I want and I'm be\nlike if I'd been in you know a partner a\nreflection of a partner doing that could\nhave really messed me up at different\ntimes in my life wait what see me look\nat me look at me look at me look at me\nI'm over here Mommy I'm over here you\nknow whatever it may be you know our\npatterns from from childhood whatever\nthat may be and I like and I'm\nlike and it's it's in a way it's like\nyou know so I can have those you know\nwith a powerful human you know that that\nthat I've chosen in some ways every day\nyeah it's\nlike got to keep leveling up and trying\nand making mistakes and going okay no\nthat didn't work or I'm going to do this\nand that's no I don't do that you might\nyou know but you know sometimes it's\nvery interesting isn't it I think the\nmasculine in in in in relation to the\nfeminine mhm\nyou know mhm like my mind map again you\nknow like I'd set an intention around\nthe and I was like oh no it's not women\nit's like the feminine within you it's\nlike but in this world that we live in\nit's like trying to find\nthe the the the the right level because\nit's not like obvious you know it's not\nthere's\nno it's you know I think people are\nalways you know how do you how do you\nhave the right balance it's like it's\nyou can't it's like sometimes you're\njust really you know Mass overly overly\nyou know edgy and sometimes you just\nlike you can be that you can hold that\nbig space because you because in your\nmind you're capable but you know I think\nit's just choosing right you just keep\nchoosing you choose life and you choose\nto you choose to go on a journey and you\nchoose to keep it real and you choose to\nfor me at least yeah I feel what you\nsaid about like for me I my sister's\nlike like four and a half years younger\nthan me or something and I feel like I I\nremember holding her when she was born\nlast year I got to walk her down the is\nat her wedding like and it was I've\nalways my nickname for my sister is kid\nbecause I've treated her like my\ndaughter since she was born and she's\nalways felt that way to me and you're so\nright like my wife would always say to\nme gosh when you're around your sister\nyou're just you know completely\ndifferent in this and it's it's that\nfatherly brotherly does she does she\nlike that sister no your your wife does\nshe she finds it adorable she finds it\nadorable like lean into that more is\nthat not not really not so much it's\njust like no it's just like no she finds\nthat adorable but she sees what capacity\nI have for tolerance and for what you're\nsaying that being that bigger holding\nwhen you have your own daughter yeah\nwhen you have it for that love and\nyou're so right that when you've been\nable to experience that it's so much\neasier to understand I always feel like\nI was raised by my mom and tried to\nraise my sister the best as I could and\nit was almost like that's made me a\nbetter husband than I would have been\nright because I had a different\nexperience with women that I wouldn't\nhave had if I didn't have a younger\nsister and had a younger brother or\nwhatever it may be right right and and\nso that resonates very strongly but also\nthis idea of I've seen myself act with\nmy wife with the people I love in a way\nthat I don't like at all and I've seen\nmyself act in the best way possible and\nI'll oscillate between the two depending\non where I'm at on any given day and\nit's what you said earlier that it takes\ntwo people to be able to let go it takes\ntwo people to be able to forgive it\ntakes two people to be able to not over\namplify or underreact or overreact and\nyou're constantly playing in that space\nspace if you want a loyal committed\nlong-term relationship which has very\ndifferent positives than a short easy\nquick moment and quick fix yeah yeah and\nand it's almost like it's what you said\nit's choosing what you want once you\ndecide your we have that idea in my\npractice once it's like in Sensei\ndiscusses you know once you decide your\nwhole world will move in that direction\nonce you decide you know what I mean\neverything is set up for the universe to\nsupport that decision but you must\ndecide whatever it may be and then if\nthe wheels fall off along the\nway you know you realize that you've\ndecided and there are mistakes but then\nyou set about fixing and I you know I I\nwrote this um like a mission statement\nwhen I when I first met her because I\nwanted\nto uh I wanted to try to articulate all\nthese crazy feelings I was having at the\ntime um which was like a reveal that I\nhadn't had in a long time in\nsomehow and one of the things that I\nsaid in this\nlike this this this this letter I wrote\nher was you know I want us to we're\ngoing to bring our little kids out you\nknow our inner child we're going to\nbring out and I'll duke it out with you\nas as much as you like so long as we\njust promise to keep getting up you know\nbecause it's like if we don't get\nup I need to know that like you'll duke\nit out I'll duke it out but that we'll\nget up you know and keep you know\nbecause that's because it doesn't matter\nabout you you're going to go down people\nare going to make mistakes things are\ngoing to happen life is is is set for\nthat you know there it's not you know\nit's not meant to\nbe the opportunities as we said at the\nbeginning for don't come through an easy\npath they come they're not when\neverything's going great it's when the\nshit's hit the fam right and that's when\nyou know so I kind of feel like I'm\nconstantly like when's the next one you\nnext next lesson when's the next one\ncoming you know how much how much you\nknow how much humility do I need to\nlearn today you know or what do I need\nto do and what choices have I made that\nhave led to this and and how am I going\nto own that what's the difference what's\nthe difference between that because I I\nresonate with that I always say to\npeople but when things are going bad\nwork hard and when things are going good\nwork harder right you're always pushing\nyourself to learn grow evolve more when\nactually things are good because a lot\nof us we do the opposite when things are\ngood we get complacent we get lost what\nis the difference for you between that\nmindset getting exhausting versus\nenergizing because I think a lot of\npeople would say gosh if I'm always\nhaving to figure out what to learn and\nwhat message and from the universe and\nmy partner that's exhausting but it\nseems like you're energized by that\nwhich is what you see in the show like\nyou're energized by the idea that\nthere's more to learn what's what's the\ndifference what have you found um how\nare you able to sustain that level of\nwanting to evolve and\ngrow I\nthink I think that I just came in that\nway bro that's that's that's just how\nyou're buil I think I came in that way I\nthink we all come different right when I\nreflect on all of the opportunities for\ngrowth in my life they all reinforce\nthis\nidea that this is what I need to learn\nat this time right in\nretrospect when you're younger and in\nthat moment of Crisis whatever that may\nbe and listen I didn't have a mobile\nphone till I was 20 right but there is a\nwindow of time in my life which is\nalmost like a void because of\nthe immense pressure and experience that\nlife was throwing at me at such a rapid\nPace that I I literally can like there\nare black almost feel like blank spots\nright like I can't even like my friend\nbreast friends would go but remember\nwhen we went to Japan on that Prest and\nI was like we we went to Japan together\nlike yeah I'm\nlike okay so you know\num but yeah I think that's it I I think\nthat I think starting at a young age\nwith ch with a practice like mine help\nme as well to recognize constantly\nreinforcing this idea of opportunities\nthrough obstacles or opportunities and\neven when you're in it and it's\nnightmares oh these exams this thing\nthis you know are this boyfriend or this\ngirlfriend or this situation this like I\nthink it's always simplify as well right\nsteady y like life you know is you know\nat least my experience is like I I I\nlove the high octane right and I've been\nat the at that depth I love the depth as\nwell but when I'm steady when I'm just\nwhen I just like come back to the simple\nright simplify because sometimes you\njust need a walk you know what I mean\nyou just need to go Outdoors sometimes\nyou just need to look at the sky take a\ndeep breath sometimes it's just and it's\na few little touchstones that you can\ncreate for yourself you know so that you\nhave tools right create your own toolbox\nand I think that's what I got from just\nso many different things whether it's\nHoffman or a plant Journey or so many or\nor an encounter with somebody important\nor my relationship to daaka my mentor or\nand and I think it's also we're wired\nwe're all wired differently so like you\nknow if you but if you keep leaning into\nthat area of um and not being afraid to\nlean into the discomfort of life then\nthat's what the show has given you you\nknow you're leaning into the discomfort\nyou get the benefit right and you know\nagain that might just be getting up from\nyour couch turning off the TV or not\nscrolling on your phone or putting you\nknow just deleting that app for like 24\nhours so that you're just not being\nruled by something outside of yourself I\nthink in this new age right we've been\nin the age of of the internet I think in\nthis new age of AI which we're all\nthere's so much anxiety and sort of you\nknow you know nervousness around and I\nsaw you know um Sam mman speak about\nsome of this stuff and um I thought it's\nso interesting but I think my takeaway\nfrom from what he had said and what I\nthink is true for my life and what I can\nsense is\ndiscipline\nself-discipline because it's a choice to\npick up your phone it's a choice to get\nlost in your phone it's a choice to keep\nscrolling or you can choose to put it\ndown and step outside and simplify do\nthat medit do that yoga class you could\nit's all choices right but I think the\nthe people that I think that if as and\nwhen you know we see this new chapter of\nlife it's going to be totally different\nmy son your your children when you come\ninto the world they're not going to know\na world without super intelligence\nthey're just not going to know that like\nmy son doesn't know a world without the\ninternet how's that impacted his life I\ndo yeah so do I yeah but they're not\ngoing to have a know they're not going\nto know a world without super intellig\nand it's going to bring remarkable\nbenefit to our lives no doubt I'm sure\nHealth healing you know access life but\nit's like those old adages like Devil's\nhands you know idle Idle Hands of the\nDevil's Playground so I keep thinking\nlike what's going to be my what's the\ndiscipline I'm going to create the\nroutines and disciplines to create and\nkeep working at so that I don't slip off\ninto that cuz I do it I can find myself\njust going and I and I kind of love my\nalgorithm by the way like like it'll\nsend me all of your things and other\npeople's you know and like messaging\naround it's definitely listening to me\nmessaging around oh this relationship\nperson is talking about fantastic things\nyou know and I'm like oh that would be\ngreat for the world to see or whatever\nyou know or whatever it may be so like\ndon't there's not it's not all bad but\nit is I think the discipline the\nself-mastery of discipline right self\ndiscipline and self-mastery to know\nskill needed the one is the one that\nwill\nprotect because if you're like what do\nthey call them in in games where it's\nlike non-player NPC is it right we can\nall become those we can all just switch\noff and turn on our autopilot and just\nbe like because you don't want to\nbecause it's overwhelming yeah it's\noverwhelming you're overwhelmed by the\nconsistent I mean you know if you keep\nlooking at the news you're just going to\nbe overwhelmed it's wild it's wild so\nmany friends who were like on both sides\nof you\nknow conflicts you know whether you know\nand just it's just you just go you can\njust be overwhelmed right you can just\nand that is where we're at I think we're\nwe're overwhelmed we're over consuming\nwe're we're Overexposed honestly we see\nand hear and understand we\nget so much more information than than\nthan than we need and then we continue\nto get more and then what's true what's\nnot true yeah it's a lot and and that's\nwhy it's a lot and that's why if\nanyone's not feeling disciplined or is\nstruggling there's a lot of compassion\nand amplify so much it's so hard I I you\nshow me a human I'll show you anyone\nright you know even and that's true of\nrelationships right I think one of the\nthings like Le and Gabby Hamilton were a\nbig part of my life at a period in my\nlife few years ago that were that that\nwhere I was separated from my my my\npartner um Flynn's mom and um and I was\nliving kind of on my own in Malibu and\nand they were such a really beautiful\ncouple the way they I learn learned so\nmuch from seeing how they\ninteracted um and I and I always\nappreciate that I took that away with me\nbut I think it's like I kind of respect\ncouples more than anything else almost\nalmost now today somehow as well when we\ntalk about relationship\nbecause it's the the people that have\nkind of gone the they're continuing to\nchoose and not to upgrade or think\nthey're upgrading or that the grass is\ngreener you know cuz we can all do that\nand maybe we will and there's no\njudgment there either too by the way no\njudgment on any of it but personally I\nkind of go oh\nwow you know I admire that because it\ndoesn't it's not easy man you know\nbecause as people as we age and change\nand it's like we're all being told that\nlike you can get this new handbag that\nwill go with this new car or you can get\nthis new watch and this new thing and\nyou're just going to keep and I love a\nshiny object so do I I love a shiny\nobject you know how how have you managed\nto maintain your Buddhist practice and\nphilosophy in Hollywood because I\nimagine that dude that bu's philosophy\nand products has has maintained has been\nmy anchor it's not I haven't maintained\nit it's been\nmy it's it's h it's maintained me it's\nheld me it's it's I really feel like\nit's my super Cape it's my Cape it's\nobvious it's my like it's my superpower\nyou know and it's it's available to\nanyone but I got it at a young age and\nI'm like it it it's my wings it's my\nit's my shield it's my it's my wisdom\nit's my courage it's my compassion if I\njust use it and sometimes I won't there\nare days I won't chant and I'm\nlike I mean look I'm years and years\ninto this so it's it's it's just I feel\nthat it's never gone far from me\nbut but I know when I'm not I'm like\nwait what's going on often it's been\nwhen I've been in a relationship by the\nway yeah wow often I've been in a\nrelationship and I\ndon't and I was like wait what why why\nis that why am I not when I'm because\nwhat's being so yeah but it's been it\nwas that was it was my yeah it was\nliterally my I can feel it it's it's\nvery obvious it's very evident from the\nshow and today it's very real in in your\nin your veins what's something you feel\nyou're being called right now what's the\nfear you're being called to overcome\nright now or the lesson that you're\nbeing questioned I I sat with this\nquestion last year and it was really\nreally interesting for me in my own\nmeditation it was revealed to me that if\nI really want to serve and have the\nimpact that I want to have that I'll\nhave to be okay with dealing\nwith more stress pain\nexternal kind of um energy coming at you\nto overcome so you can you can have you\ncan bigger paint a bigger canvas have it\nwill require that that's and and that\nwas a very interesting almost request or\nquestion that I was hearing from the\nuniverse or from from my own spiritual\npractice of this is what's required of\nyou are you ready for you are you okay\nwhat what have you heard that or felt\nthat you are being What Fear are you\nbeing asked to overcome or what lesson\nare you being asked to learn right now\nanything comes because you've conquered\nso many fears and the show and gone to\nthe edge what's what's an edge that is\nbeing requested of\nyou I think that our deepest\nfears are often they often lie\nin areas unknown to us subconscious in\nour\nsubconscious some of the deepest fears I\nhave are are like related\nto a historical pattern of Behavioral\nthinking which I don't know that I was\neven conscious\nof you know like I've\ninherited and possibly from\nin my mind because of my practice and\nFaith generationally\nlifetimes previous lifetimes of thinking\nMH um because that's how I kind of live\nmy life like for the next life I'm like\nthat's how I'm looking at it now I'm\nlike I'm living for the next one you\nknow it's like like the Egyptians with\nthe temples it's like they were doing\nthat because it was like and I kind of\nlike if I can live like that but I think\nthat when I allow myself it feels\nconnected\nto I think\nselfworth which I think is something\nthat like we all kind of like you know\nlike is Jay ready for that bigger canvas\nis he ready to put that message out into\nthe world does he deserve that has he\ndone enough for that am I worthy of that\nright have I have I done the work am I\ndoing am I in the flow enough am I and\nalso like\ncuz it's not it's cyclical right\nsometimes you're just not in the flight\nI had seven years of just being what\nfelt like at some of that like swimming\nup River just and I because I was just\nI'm going to swim up this River now for\nsome reason you know and that was partly\nthat time when I was separated and\nliving in mountain and like training\nwith lead and stuff and I really kind of\nput my body and my mind through a lot of\ndifferent before I did the show even\nbefore I did to the edge so I\nthink I think it really for me it's\nlike that we're enough right I think\nsomebody said it on your wall there that\nyou're enough but it's like I think we\nall struggle sometimes to really deeply\nbelieve that we are enough that we're\nvalued that we're valuable you know\nwe're imprinted by our parents from the\nage of 0 to 7 right but that's not even\ntaking into account the the the time\nthat you know you're in your mother's so\nthere's a whole heap of information that\nis just like is it yours or is it\nsomebody\nelse's I'm I'm constantly trying to go\nlike how do I detach from my this idea\nof what do is that is that my is that is\nthat my\nbaggage look like my\nbaggage I mean I know okay that's mine\nall right I take that let's unpack that\nbut all that other\nstuff you know\nand I've\nI've I think Hoffman taught me a lot in\nthat space But I think I've\ninterestingly like it's a fear of like\nbeing alone are you good to be alone I\nthink that was the biggest for me in a\nlong time am I good to just be on my\nown and I and I'm I'm constantly working\non that yeah am I good enough on my own\nbecause am I good in my own\ncompany do I feel good with me just to\nbe with just me today or for this next\nhour because I spent a lot of time in my\nyouth with people who I you know really\nlove and admire and adore and continue\nto but in a way it wasn't serving me I\nwas like it was you know we talk about\nenergy and drains and things you know\nthere were there were there were\nrelationships in my life that I didn't\neven really realize the impact that they\nwere\nhaving and then when I did I was like oh\nwait a second this needs reframing and\nuntil I'm ready to\nreframe I'm going to just take pause to\nfeel safe seen and celebrated but I\nthink that I think my so in am amongst\nall of that I think it was probably\nbeing alone and being good with being\nalone and\nrecognizing cuz we're going to be born\nand we're going to die alone right so\nit's like how how how good are you with\nbeing being alone right that's beautiful\nman I think and that you're enough right\nyou don't need all the other\nthings cuz I love a shiny object I you\nknow whatever like although this isn't\nshiny but it's the one from New Zealand\nI don't yeah it's but you know I do I'm\nlike I've got a fast car couple do I\nneed them I like the way it feels but\nyou know do we need to keep consuming\nall this\nstuff when the planet is\ngot a ticking\nclock it's interesting it's really\ninteresting I find that we're all\nparadoxes and we're almost giving\nourselves permission to be a paradox\nuntil all of it's\npurified and it's almost the permission\nis what allows you the ability to purify\nwhereas if you're living in the conflict\nof I'm only one thing you don't get the\nopportunity to dissolve the part that\nyou may not be comfortable with because\nyou have an accept it yeah but no that\nanswer was beautiful being alone and\nbeing comfortable in your own skin and\nbeing enough and and that is the\nlifelong journey I feel like that's you\nknow that is it and uh orando I I feel\nlike I could talk to you for hours we\nhave and I hope we do yeah we did I want\nto end with what we end every episode on\nwhich is called the final five of on\npurpose these are pretty much the same\nfive questions that everyone gets\nanswered and every question has to be\nanswered in one word to one one sentence\nmaximum okay so gosh I hate that kind of\npressure these are your final five and\nyou can take your time they're\nthoughtful questions uh Orlando these\nare your final five the first question\nis what is the best advice you've ever\nheard or\nreceived um my mother used to\nsay have respect from the Dorman to the\ndirector and I think respect mhm all\nlife anyone you\nmeet because we're all on that Journey\nMH and the person that's opening the\ndoor for you could be running the\ncountry you just don't\nknow great answer question number two\nwhat's the worst advice you've ever\nheard or\nreceived the\nworst\num I mean the worst of\nadvice that's a really tricky one you\ncan skip it if your mind's blocked it\nout that's pretty cool I yeah it's hard\nfor me to yeah that's good hard for me\nto the worst\nadvice yeah yeah sorry dude no that's\ngood don't be sorry that's totally great\nI mean if you blocked all out that's\nawesome because I I like to make a log\nof bad advice everyone's received\nbecause I feel like there's so much bad\nadvice that goes around I mean I like\nyeah I'm not no you blocked her that's\ncool yeah I'm like if if it doesn't if\nit's not a aha for me I'm like yeah\nleave it leave it that's what I'm saying\nI don't I skip the question don't need\nto apologize uh question number three\nwhat's the first thought you have in the\nmorning and the last one you have at\nnight so we wake up in a family\nbed and Katie usually says thank you God\nfor today I'm grateful in every way\nespecially for and Daisy will go and\nwe'll all go daddy mommy fny you know\nwe'll all do that yeah um that's\nbeautiful and that's and I'll then\nsay yeah I think gra you yeah and at\nnight yeah it's the\nsame it's it's the same because it's\nlike we woke up you know and I think\nyeah question number four um what's\nsomething that you used to value that\nyou don't value\nanymore\nwoo\num dude that's so\nannoying other people's\nopinions of me right answer uh Fifth and\nfinal question we ask this to every\nguest who's ever been on the show if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow what would it\nbe I think it comes back to my first\nanswer that my mother kind of instilled\nin me which is just\nrespect yeah you\nknow a law of respecting life all Life\nby Saku wada wrote this\namazing um letter he came to the UK I\nthink it was in the 80s to visit the\nyoung the youth\nmembers and he was there but he chose\nnot to stand before them to have a\ncommunication\nI think he could feel like the\nanticipation and the complete so he\nwrote this letter or he may have been\nbusy I but he but he was there but he\ndidn't but it was a choice is from my\nand within it he\nsaid there's a piece about I'm going to\nnot maybe land this but you'll get the\nmy point this this lifetime is about you\nknow um from the\nmaterial from the external to the\ninternal\nand making all mothers happy\nbecause I I I'd love to actually find\nthe quote to read do it do it yeah yeah\ndo it it okay so here we go I'm a member\nof a Buddhist organization since I'm 16\nand my mentor is a Japanese man in in in\nJapan a man named daaku aada and in\n1994 he wrote a message of encouragement\nto the Youth of the UK he wouldn't see\nthem\nbut he sent this message this is an\nexcerpt from the message that he sent to\nthese children to for them to listen to\nhe reserved himself from being there but\nI wanted to read it because I feel it's\nso important and I had it written for\nyou as well to read along but it says\nthe times are changing from an age where\nJustice from an age where power is\nJustice to an age in which Justice is\npower in this new age the Supreme\nguiding principle will be the benefit of\nall Humanity rather than the interests\nof one particular Nation or ethnic group\nwe will see the transformation of\nhistory from the revolution of the\nexternal environment to that of the\ninner self the inner Human Revolution it\nwill be an age in which the actions of\nleaders will naturally be based on the\nguidelines of making all mothers\nhappy the actions of leaders will be\nnaturally based on the guidelines of\nmaking all mothers happy respect right\ncuz we\ncan't us mortal\nmen really fathom you know the power\nof what it means to be a mother in the\nworld but like if we can have a little\nbit of because you know so interesting\nisn't it so interesting to see the times\nhow they've been changing and how this m\nmasculine that's been living in with us\nand we've been living with and under and\naround and for and is sort of\ntransformed and how we're\nlearning particularly as men to respect\nand understand the power of the\nMother Mother Earth Mother Mother the\nmothers and it's like and he he goes on\nto say about respecting your father and\nmother and I really think he\nmeans All fathers all mothers you know I\nwas talking about this with David who\nintroduced me to my practice just\nearlier and we were saying he was saying\nit's I've really come to understand that\nit's all\nmothers respect all mothers respect all\nfathers particularly because they\nhopefully have some sense you know of\nthe value of life and there is some\npeople that don't of course there are\nsome people that that's\nnot but yeah so I think that's that's\nthat that was beautiful idea I've never\nheard it been put that way it's a\nwonderful\nyou know and and that idea as well which\nactually\ninterestingly um I wrote a note of what\nSam said about Alman and he was like the\njourney is now because I think it's way\nmore it's not the external it's the\ninternal if we are those\nlittle galaxies right if we really start\nto understand each of us and have like\nrespect and take responsibility right\nimagine if you know I think what I what\nI kind of understood about my practice\nwas if I'm good enough and capable\nenough to just take care of my side of\nthe street right then if I get so good\nat it I can start to take care of other\npeople's side of the street because\nthere are some people that just don't\nhave the skill set they may not have had\nthe education they may not had the\nupbringing whatever it may be the\ncircumstances they were born into a life\nthat just didn't provide anything like\nthe tools necessary to be able to cope\nwith what life is like obstacles I was\ntalking about that some for some people\nit's just it's just there the whole time\nright it's like if we're all becoming\ncapable humans and able of taking care\nthen we can start taking care of your\nneighbor right you know what I mean\nstart taking care of the person next to\nyou because they can't right because\nthat's what it's going to take right in\nmy mind for this next chapter with where\nyou\nknow jobs are not what they used to be\nand people need\nyou know\nthat boundary right they need that um\nthat frame of reference that you need\nthat kind of the security through\nthrough uh through boundaries right\num so\nyeah the discipline but the respect and\nthe uh all mothers happy let's make all\nmothers happy right it's funny orando\nsometimes I don't do that though by the\nway I try we try\nyou've said it here now
