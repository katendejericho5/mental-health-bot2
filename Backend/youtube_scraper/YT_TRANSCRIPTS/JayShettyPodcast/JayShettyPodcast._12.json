volunteer program which was a\nservice day for our team we'd made a\ncommitment at the company that we wanted\nto find programs that meant of some\nimportance to the team causes that\npeople were passionate about on the team\nand yours was right up there and the\nteam wanted to get right behind it and\ngetting to be there that day and learn\nabout the incredible work you were doing\nI was totally Blown Away uh very much in\nadmiration of both of you and your\nstories and Journeys and then of course\nI got to attend your Gala which was\nphenomenal and spectacular and I can't\neven remember now how much you raised\nwas it 12 million in that g that you\nraised we\nremember we like hold on 12 yeah 12.6 to\nbe I love that Kelly good be exact it\nwas just it was incredible to see just\ntwo people who are so passionate about a\ncause active on it every day and\ncreating amazing value for him so\ncongratulations first of all and uh\nthank you for this opportunity thank you\nyeah all right well let's dive straight\nin uh noran Kelly I want to talk to you\nboth individually and collectively about\nyour respective Journeys this is not\nwhat you've done forever I believe it's\n12 years now that you've been building\nbaby to baby we just hit 13 just hit 13\namazing congratulations so let's talk\nabout your individual Journeys and I\nwant to find out when you were in your\nprevious lives was this a passion of\nyours was this something you were aware\nof or were you lost in a completely\ndifferent world whoever wants to go\nfirst I will I um I looking back I think\nthis makes so much sense that this is\nwhere I've ended up um as a kid I was\ngiving back I think it's really\nimportant when parents instill that and\ntheir children um I went to Hebrew\nschool\nand giving back was a core part of what\nwe learned we had something called\nSedaka which was bringing change every\nweek to school and whatever you could\ncollect in your your house and that\nmoney was going to go toward helping\nothers we also had a food pantry that\nwas attached to our Temple and we would\ngo on the weekends and my parents would\nbring me and we would give food to\npeople who were less fortunate fast\nforward I became a lawyer and in my Law\nFirm scenars which I love dearly it's a\nbig corporate law firm doing giant\nSecurities cases but there's an option\nto do pro bono work and pro bono work is\nobviously helping people who are less\nfortunate without charging them um and\nthat's what I gravitated to immediately\nbecause it was just to me that was so\nobvious why would you want to work on a\nbig Automotive or oil case when you got\nto help a low-income woman get housing\nso it was a no-brainer to me I was I was\nso thrilled to have the opportunity to\ndo that from the law firm and that's\njust all I wanted to do so looking back\nI was going toward this direction of\ngiving back and baby to baby is\ncertainly a huge extension of that but I\ndo think it was always there and I do\nthink it's important to teach your\nchildren about giving back from a young\nage I think a lot of the people we meet\non this journey that care they started\ncaring as a child I love that thank you\nso much kellyo it's same question well I\nwas a model so you know you wouldn't\nthink of that probably as a giving back\ncareer but it was a career that took me\nall over the world but also um when I\nwas home in my home base of New York I\nwould volunteer at a Head Start Center\nin Harlem that I knew um people who\nworked there and so I would work with\nkids in my free time I always loved\nbeing with kids I wanted to be a teacher\nwhen I was younger and so I was in the\nclassroom with these children and they\nhad no shoes that fit clothes that were\nyou know too small they would wear the\nsame clothes to school every day they\nwouldn't come to school because they\ndidn't have these basic things and so\nthat sort of instilled in me this you\nknow need to help children with Basic\nEssentials like I saw what could happen\nif they didn't have them they couldn't\nget an education they wouldn't show up\nto school so that was something that was\npart of my free time um but I loved it\nso much I was really passionate about it\nand when I moved to LA and Nora and I\nmet my father-in-law happened to\nintroduce us because he knew I had a\npassion for giving back to children in\nneed and Norah did as well so he set us\nup on a blind date and that was how we\nmet and so it all sort of happened from\nthere that's genius yeah what I'm sure\nhe's taking all the credit now he\ndefinitely is trust me that's amazing no\nwhat I love about both of those stories\nindependently and I love what you're\nsaying Nora this idea of how giving back\nhas been a part of your culture ever\nsince you were young and I can\ndefinitely identify that and recognize\nthat I remember my parents didn't have a\nlot growing up but giving back was\nalways part of their life and I think\neven when I was growing up there were\ntimes in my mind where I thought when I\nhave more I'll give more but I found\nthat that was the wrong mindset it was\nthe wrong mentality what I found is\nwhatever I have whatever I can give is a\ngreat place to start whether it's time\nor energy or money or whatever else it\nmay be and I guess did you feel like in\nyour career Nora when you were going\ndown that path and were choosing pro\nbono work did that positively or\nnegatively affect your career and and\nhow did that impact you know being a\nlawyer and navigating that world it it\nwas positive in every way because again\nI the the the big firms do take on this\npro bono commitment and they owe the\nhours and so they need some of their\nAssociates and partners to be people who\nlove it um and so I that was that was\nlucky and then you get so much legal\nexperience because at a big firm big\ncomplex cases as a junior lawyer you're\nhaving a very minor role on a big\ncomplex case and propono cases you work\ndirectly with individuals and So you\nyou're you advance that much more\nquickly you're you're in court you're in\nfront of judges you're with a client and\nso I I actually think it's a win-win for\nthe law firms because you're you're\ngaining experience and also yeah giving\nback yeah the reason I ask is I feel\nlike people always feel and I wonder\nwhether you come across this but I I\nfeel a lot of people always feel like if\nI give back I'm going to slip behind I'm\ngoing to fall behind or if I focus on\nthat and I remember I was at a\nconsulting firm Accenture and giving\nback was a big part of their culture as\nwell and we had service days in the\ncompany and uh we had something called\nADP which was accenture's area of doing\npro bono work and it was encouraged but\nI find that that's newer and growing now\nwhereas you know I I imagine like 10 20\nyears ago that wasn't the norm so Kelly\nhow have you felt about that in terms of\nlike this identity of giving back do you\nfeel like it's kind of seeing positively\nor is it always something that people\nthink oh yeah I'll think about that\nlater or how do people approach that I\nthink what we do at baby to baby is we\ntry and make giving back fun and\ninteresting and we try and make it for\nwhether you're an individual a company\nyou want to come with your you know\nwhole class from your school and you're\na teacher so we try and make it you know\nfun and trendy and we've tried to like\nyou know bring some excitement into\ngiving back and as you saw when you came\nfor your team building day I think it's\nreally working and I think we get so\nmany great um different organizations\nfrom you know your team or the Girl\nScouts come in or we'll have classrooms\nfull of kids but we also have big\nstudios come in and different companies\ncome in for their give back day and\nwe've been able to to really make that\npart of um baby to baby from day one\npeople love it people I I agree that\nit's changed but I think and I think for\num reasons for all kinds of reasons I\nthink a lot of individuals are just love\nit and love giving back I think children\norganically like to give back I think\ncompanies have to give back and so there\nare companies that have it in their\nculture because it's organic and the\nleaders want it and there are companies\nthat just have to have it because I\nthink employees demand it so what we're\nfinding is that when we you know we're\nobviously a National Organization but\neven in our headquarters our volunteer\nsessions where we have the most the they\nfill up in seconds after we put up and\nwe have two two of them we have sessions\ntwice a day and the minute they open up\nabout a month ahead of time and they are\nthey fill up immediately and people are\ncalling to get you know can they come\nlater at night can they come on the\nweekends people want to teach their they\npeople I think are desperate to teach\ntheir kids to give back and I think\nactually the more they have a lot of\ntimes people re PE you know people are\nthey recognize how much they have and I\nthink they really think it's a\nresponsibility especially if they didn't\ngrow up that way I think we talked to a\nlot of people who didn't grow up with as\nmuch now find themselves in situations\nwhere they have so much and they don't\nknow how to teach their kids the way\nthat they were taught and how could\nsomeone in a privil situation teach\ntheir kids that that is not how the\nworld lives and so I think people are\njust dying for not dying for I think\npeople are are really craving\nopportunities to give back and I don't\nthink there are that many so we have\nfound that it's often expensive to have\npeople volunteer or there's nonprofits\nthat are on a smaller scale where I'm\nsure they would want help but they can't\nalways afford to have people come in\nit's messy it's timec consuming and so\nthere aren't as many programs as there\nactually used to be and so I think when\npeople identify a place that can really\nuse them in a way where they know that\nthey're being used in a purposeful\nManner and not just doing busy work and\nwhen they're at baby to baby they're\nseeing they are folding outfits for\nchildren and putting together we try to\nmake it very specific so that people\nunderstand how they're giving back and\neven though we talk a lot about big\nnumbers and 450 million items we're\ngiving out and a million kids people\nwant to focus on individuals so when\nthey're folding an outfit and choosing\nwhat outfit to give a 2-year-old who's\nin foster care who they know is coming\nin such a horrific circumstance and\nthey're going to get to choose the\noutfit that goes to this child who's in\nsuch need people feel a lot of Pride and\nwant those opportunities absolutely yeah\nI remember when we were there that day I\nfelt your team did a phenomenal job\nobviously we met but I thought you and\nyour team did a great job of educating\nUs in what we were actually doing and\nand where it was going and how it works\nand and I found that to be you're so\nright like as a volunteer you felt so\nmuch more closely connected to the work\nthat was going on so when you both meet\nwas it Love at First Sight was it like I\nlove this person we're in sync like we\nshould do something together like what\nwas that energy like because obviously\nthis was a a warm intro I guess it was\nfrom someone you trust and respect but\nwhat what was what came out of that\ninitial meeting so we had dinner with\nour husbands um just down the street and\num we were you know probably 10 minutes\nof the conversation was about I was\ngiving back you know I was modeling\nliving in New York just moved here and\ngiving back at the Head Start Center\nNora told me about her Pro Bona work\nwith women and children so we sort of\nconnected on that and then sort of went\non a merry way and that was kind of it\nand then I think we reached out to each\nother um later on but it wasn't that it\nwasn't like the next day it was a little\nwhile later and we had coffee and we\nwere talking about like how could we\nstart something what could we do to help\nyou know women and children that was\nboth of our passion and what we decided\nto do was go and meet with different\nnonprofits in Los Angeles at the time\nand see what was missing so we went to\nhomeless shelters domestic violence\nshelters um Head Start centers schools\num and we asked what was missing where\nwhat was the need and across the board\nno matter who we talked to it was oh\nwe're doing the programming but what's\nmissing is families are struggling to\nafford diapers food these Basic\nEssentials and sort of a light bulb back\nto the Head Start Center where I saw the\nchildren who couldn't come to school CU\ntheir shoes were three sizes too small\nor they hadn't eaten breakfast or all of\nthese basic things that their needs\nweren't being met and it all came\ntogether and what happened was we um\ntalked about what we wanted to do diaper\nneed was one of the things that every\nsingle person said wow and at the time\nyou know there was this statistic that\none in three families were struggling to\nafford diapers obviously now later 13\nyears later unfortunately that statistic\nis that one in two families now struggle\nto afford diapers so we kept hearing\nthis theme of like diaper need diaper\nneed and what could we do about it and\nso it was a problem that we kept seeing\nthat we wanted to solve and so day one\nthat was sort of like okay how could we\nmake this work what could we do together\nto fix this so that was sort of like the\nlight bulb moment for both of us I love\nthat process and I want our audience to\ntake note of that because I think one of\nthe biggest things I hear from my\ncommunity is Jay I care about so many\nthings how do I choose what to focus on\nlike there are so many challenges in the\nworld and I don't know how I fit in and\nI think often those questions are very\nsincere and genuine but they stop us\nfrom making change and having an impact\nbecause we kind of get lost in decision\nmaking and choosing and and I love that\napproach that you both had of let's\nactually go and research let's go and\nlearn and let's listen to say where's\nthe Gap what's missing how can we solve\nthat and sorry go on nor I can see you\nlike also because it it is all of that\nbut it's asking the people who need the\nhelp and I think that was like the key\nthat we discovered which was that we and\nthis has helped us for 13 years is that\nwe can't assume what someone needs you\nhave to go to the community and ask and\nthat helped us on day one when we were\nasking what is the basic need so that\nyou'd understand because I don't think\nit's what we were expecting we weren't\nexpecting that they were going to say\nthe whole need is diaper need we but\nthen it made sense when we listened well\nno one's going to come to our parenting\nclass no one's going to come for a Well\nVisit no one's going to file their\ninsurance claim we can't get to these\npeople specifically moms if they have a\nbaby in a dirty diaper it just logically\ndoesn't make sense but\nthen today with when we're dealing with\nour disaster relief program and we talk\nto we're talking to or our team is\ntalking to families or the social\nservice agency that serves the families\nin a disaster again you're saying don't\nassume what someone needs in this\nparticular hurricane ask them because\nmaybe they'll say well in this case the\nwater has been contaminated and we need\nwater before we need anything else to\nmake\nformula early on when we knew people\nneeded gear like cribs and strollers we\nthought we worked with companies that\nhad big fancy strollers and we thought\nlet's get let's try to get those donated\nand then we went to the community and\nthey said no we don't want a big fancy\nstroller we want a fold up $20 stroller\nwe're getting on the bus we have\nmultiple children we're walking to\nschool and work and so again our\nassumption would have been let's get the\nhighest Tech stroller out there the\nreality was no we actually need a a\npractical stroller so I feel like we\nlearn that lesson over and over in\neverything we do listen listen to the\ncommunity you're serving and let them\ntell you what they need yeah that's such\na great Insight I feel like it's such a\nprivileged position to think you can\npredict what someone needs and what\nsomeone wants and I think even when I\ncame and you were talking about diapers\nI was like really I couldn't believe it\nlike I was I was somewhat like mind\nblown by the fact that that was the\nmissing link and then when you start\nlearning about it and how much more it\naffects as oppos do you think it's just\nthe diaper and I know we can go into\njust you know the extent of impact that\nhas and all the other supplies that you\nboth focus on providing you almost think\nwow I I would never have known that like\nI wouldn't have come to that off my own\naccord and I think sometimes a lot of us\nare trying to figure out what people\nneed right in an in a silo isolated from\nthe problem from the situation from\npeople and we're rarely going to get to\nthe right answer what did it feel like\nyou know you're both having successful\ncareers you're happy doing service work\non top of that like you're doing the pro\nbono work you're going to head start\nlike in one sense it's almost like well\nthis is great I serve I work I have a\ngood career what makes you both go okay\nno we need to do this full-time like\nthis needs to be our primary focus\nbecause that feels like a genuinely big\nleap and commitment and taking away from\ntwo great career parts to actually say\nno no no this is enough of a priority\nwas it something you were building while\nyou were working or did you both go no\nwe're going to stop working and start\nbuilding which way around did it go it\nall happened very fast so I think we\nwere um slowing down on our other on our\nother careers and projects but once we\nstarted it was it took off very quickly\nso there was immediately no room to do\nanything else um we actually had a event\nvery early on where we wanted to kind of\nannounced this that we had taken over\nbaby to baby and that we wanted to make\na really big impact and we wanted to\nwork quickly we both are I think have\nvery big ideas and dreams and so we put\ntogether a small event to just make this\nannouncement and we didn't want to spend\nany money so we went to friends and had\na publicist help get a photographer\nthere and a friend who had a hotel space\nto donate and some alcohol so if Case we\nwere asking for money we wanted to make\nsure people were in good moods and um\ndoes that work yes it's one of our big\nsecrets got\nit as you probably saw at the Galla yes\nyeah\nwe had this event talked a little bit\nabout the mission of baby to baby and\nwhere where we wanted to go with it and\ntwo of our day one board members Jessica\nAlba and Nicole Richie both came to the\nevent and had their picture taken by the\npro Bona photographer\nand the picture showed up a few days\nlater in Us\nmagazine Kelly and I at the time had one\nintern and we had a very small 600 squ\nfoot storefront\nspace and we got a phone call a few days\nlater from a big publicity company that\nrepresented Kimberly Clark who owned\nHuggies\ndiapers and they said we answered the\nphone and they said they had seen a\npicture and they wanted to know if they\ncould donate\n$100,000 and $100,000\ndiapers um again this is week two on the\njob we have we had like four boxes of\ndiapers sitting next to us and we were\nlike yeah we'll take 100,000 diapers\nthank you please send them over right\nnow and then they said well do you guys\naccept palets and we're Googling like\nwhat is a pallette we're like yes we\ntake pal law and a model not a lot of\npalletes in our and they're like do you\nguys have forklifts I'm like of course\nwe have forklifts yes and I'm like how\nwhere do you rent a forklift we're\ntrying to figure it out and we're like\nsure no problem no problem and then the\ntruck shows up the biggest truck you\nwe've ever seen taking and we were\nwearing these shoes with your heels in\ncase they're listening and we got on the\ntruck and our intern popped on too and a\nvery nice driver and we learned quickly\nwhat it meant that they were on pallets\nwhich made them difficult we were there\nwith the xacto knives getting the\nplastic off and the crates open and\ntrying to unload them ourselves with the\ntruck driver and the intern the four of\nus but we did it and we filled our small\nstorefront space and Spilled Out a\nlittle bit and the moral of the story is\nwell there are two morals of the story\nbut we gave them out in one day so we\ncalled This is 100,000 diapers it's a\nlot of diapers and we\ncalled contacts at homeless shelters\nsome schools some local hospitals and\nsaid we have diapers for free to give\nout would you like to come get them and\nit was astonishing to see they were\ntruly we say they were truly like gold\nthat people were picking up and\nhow what it meant to people and the\nrelief that it was showing again this\nwas not you know we don't serve\nindividuals directly because it's in\ngeneral en because it's has been more\nefficient for us to scale to give to\nother organizations that can give them\nout to their clients and fill the whole\nshelter or school or know who's in the\nmost need which is important to us but\nthey get they went out the door in one\nday now we can talk later that that was\n100,000 diapers now to date we've given\nout 200 million but at that time it was\nso many and I think it taught us\nprobably our two most important lessons\none diaper need was enormous and not\ngoing anywhere and two The Power of\nthese celebrity endorsements and\nsponsorships so just from two women\ngetting behind us a company wanted to\ngive us that and we have created that\ninto a Playbook where with dozens and\ndozens and dozens of amazing women\nactresses celebrities entrepreneurs CEOs\nwe've been able to take advantage of\ntheir platforms\nand that is what has catapulted us to be\nable to give away hundreds of millions\nof items yeah absolutely what a first\nweek at the job that's that's pretty\nintense and I and I could totally\nresonate with I remember I was 16 years\nold and I used to work at a grocery\nstore and I remember did you too I\nremember unloading my first ever truck\nof pallets of water and I had one of\nthose manual for Cliffs like not even I\nwas the checkout girl right yeah yeah\nthey wouldn't let me do that and so they\nwere like you're you're 16 you and\nliterally I remember putting this manual\nforklift in putting it in a pet and like\nthen pulling it out and it was one of\nthe heaviest most arduous tasks ever and\nnow that I've been to your warehouse and\nseen just how many not only diapers you\nhave but supplies you have and just the\nthe scale at which you're dealing with\nthis I wanted to read out you know I was\nlooking at some of these statistics\nbecause I just want people to understand\nuh the the problem statement or or the\nlevel of challenge I this just blew my\nmind and I want to share it because yeah\nit's super important listen to this\neveryone so Kelly already said this one\none in two families struggle in the US\nto afford diapers for their children I\njust would never think of that diapers\ncost $80 to $100 per month per baby and\nthe average low-income family pays\nnearly $1,000 a year for diapers this\npart I think was wait just\nto are all true but getting worse so\nwith inflation we're finding that our\nthe families we serve are saying the\nprices are 30% up from that in the last\nfew years so the problem is getting\nworse wow and then this one diapers are\nthe fourth highest household expense\nafter rent food and utilities for\nfamilies with diaper need child care\ncenters often require 68 diapers per day\nfor children to enroll and attend daily\nuh that's the one we want people to know\nabout yeah we talk about diapers\nperpetuating the cycle of poverty so if\nyou don't have six to eight diapers ERS\nto drop your child off at daycare you\ncan't go to work and you can't go to a\njob interview so they're stopping it's\nreally like a block for women and\nparents being able to go to work so if\nyou could don't have the money to afford\ndiapers and you can't drop your child\noff at daycare how can you go to work so\nit's really this symbol of poverty\nthat's how we look at diapers yeah let's\nyeah let's talk about that a little bit\nmore because that's what I meant earlier\nwhen I was talking about how like\ndiapers is almost like the the central\npoint of all these other\nworks is one of them that's a one what\nare the others that you are massively\naffected well we know that when we give\nfamilies diapers that they're paying\ntheir rent putting food on the table and\nkeeping their lights on and as you\nalready said by reading off all our\nfavorite stats that um that is something\nthat a diaper is stopping people you\nknow from doing anything it's really you\ncan't leave your house if you don't have\ndiapers families are using newspapers or\ntowels as substitutes so if you don't\nhave a diaper how can you go and take\nyour baby to the grocery store to even\nbuy food for your other children it's\njust diapers are this symbol of poverty\nto us that that's why every day diaper\nneed is the number one thing we're\nfocused on yeah absolutely I mean I I'm\ngoing to go on because these to me these\nwere just these were huge these were\nsome amazing starts about the incredible\nwork you've done around it so in 2021\nbaby to baby developed your own diaper\nmanufacturing system producing Diapers\nat 80% less than the retail cost in\norder to help meet meet the\nexponentially increasing demand walk me\nthrough that direction because now\nthat's like you're going from having\n100,000 diaper to you to then figuring\nout that it's too expensive well we've\nbeen getting diapers donated from\ncompanies like Huggies for example with\nthe Jessica and Nicole event and um the\nstory Nora just told but also you know\ncorporate Partners have been a huge part\nof babyto bab's growth using Jessica as\nanother example with Honest Company they\ndonated 10 million items to us a lot of\nthose being diapers but diapers are just\nthe number one thing we're you know\ntrying to get and we're doing it in\nevery which way so we're trying to get\ncorporate sponsors to donate to us then\nwe've gone to Sacramento to testify to\nhave the sales tax removed from diapers\nthat was something we were able to do um\nthen we did a goop campaign with\ngwenneth paltro where we launched a fake\nluxury diaper that was intended to make\npeople angry and it was a spoof and\ngwenith was like I I'll take the heat\nfor this and she launched a diaper and\nit had you know diamonds and fur and it\nwas made of BL alpaca fur and it was\n$120 for a pack of 10 but it was meant\nto show that $120 is what you need to\ndiaper your baby for a month and once\nshe did the Grand reveal it was like\nyeah this is meant to piss you off\nbecause diapers are taxed like a luxury\nitem how insane is that and what can we\ndo about it so then you were able to go\non to goop and baby to bab's Shared\nplatform and reach out to your state\nsenator and say like this is ridiculous\nhow can we still tax diapers like a\nluxury item and since we did that seven\nstates followed suit there are still 26\nStates left the tax diapers but we're\nstill working on that that's you know\nmore to come on that but manufacturing\nthe diapers was something we started\nbecause we were able to buy diapers for\ncost from our manufacturer so they were\ngiving us lowcost diapers but at some\npoint the manufacturer who we were\nworking with understood our mission knew\nwhat we did and we talked to them about\nlike okay what if we stripped off the\ncartoons and made these diapers plain\nand white and we just used one color for\nthe packaging how low would you make\nthem for us how you know what could we\nget the cost down to so 80% less than\nretail is how much they're we're making\nthem for now they're babyto bab diapers\nthey're plain white but they work just\nas well as any and we've been able to\ndistribute 200 million diapers because\nof this relationship and because of\nmanufacturing so it was something\nInnovative we came up with during covid\nbecause the need was so great but it's\nreally been able to you know stretch our\ndonor dollar so much further and been\nable to diaper a lot more babies I think\nwe had really kind of hit rock bottom\nwith the desperate ation for diapers\nduring Co so it was already I mean we're\nsaying it's one out of two families in\nthe United States it's just an\nimpossible statistic to digest but it\nwas seeing and hearing One By One The\nAlternatives that the families were\ntaking like using a newspaper to diaper\ntheir child like using a towel like\ntaking a diaper off a baby cleaning it\nhanging it to dry and putting it back on\ntheir baby and there was a point during\nCo where the diapers were also off the\nshelves if we you you can remember most\npeople were talking about the toilet\npaper shortage but diapers were right\nthere with them and um it was just\nso upsetting to everyone at baby to baby\nthat our team really made this really\nhad this idea to say we have to do\nsomething about this the our our need\nhad gone up 500% just at baby B to Baby\nalone in the weeks when Co started and\nso we that was when we kind of in\ndesperation went to these manufacturing\npartners and said we know we're doing a\nlot it's not enough and we talked about\nscratching surfaces earlier you know\nwe're even now we're proud that we've\ngiven out 200 million diapers it's more\nthan any organization like ours in the\ncountry but it's not enough we have this\nyear alone just from the families we\nserve we have requests for $ 1.5 billion\ndiapers so we just had to do more and it\nwas manufacturing and the manufacturing\nsystem that allowed us to really take\nthe leap because now when we get\ndonations we know they can go so much\nfurther so we're making packs families\nin our program are buying packs for an\naverage of $20 we're making packs for\n350 and of course not charging them and\ndonating them and it's it's something\nthat manufacturing is allowing us to\nmove the needle still scratch the\nsurface but move the needle absolutely\nno definitely moving the needle and I\nmean I'm blown away because it's like\nit's incredible marketing mixed with\nIncredible systems incredible management\nlike you know the campaign that you were\njust mentioning with Gwyneth and goop\nlike that is like something out of like\na movie like to be able to pull\nsomething like that off and to actually\nthink about it in that Innovative way\nand to then build a system that's\nmanufacturing your own diapers because\nyou see the value of cost I mean you're\noperating like an incredibly Innovative\nfast forward uh Fast Forward Thinking\ncompany and you're applying it all to\ndoing good in the world like has that\nalways has this strategic marketing\nbrain always been between you two like\nhow have you you know how have you been\nable to think about changing the world\nin this way because I think that like\nyou said I think change can often feel\nboring it can feel like slow it can feel\nlike it has to be done in a certain way\nbut you are willing to like push\nboundaries and maybe some people get\nupset in the beginning to get them to\nmake a point like that's a really\noriginal unique way of thinking about\nchange I think we're not scared to push\nboundaries and I think both of us you\nknow people say to us all the time like\noh did you ever think baby to baby would\nbe this big and we say yes we did we did\nbecause we saw the need we saw you know\nwhat we needed to do and we went for it\nand we do that every day and so being\nInnovative and coming up with fun you\nknow exciting marketing things or\nwhatever we're doing I think bringing\nthe community together and collaborating\nwith whether it's celebrity or corporate\nPartners is something that we love doing\nand that we will continue to do and\nwe've done it in so many ways like this\nyear you know we talk about all the time\num we partnered with the White House and\nHHS in uh 2023 last year and we launched\na pilot program that was creating\nmaternal and newborn Supply kits and we\ndid it for the three states with the\nhighest maternal mortality rates and the\nhighest child poverty rates and so it\nwas a pilot program for these three\nstates Arkansas New Mexico and Louisiana\nand W in partnership with the White\nHouse and HHS and the vice president\ncame to baby to baby to launch it with\nus this year we're now able to go to 10\nstates with Huggies back to Huggies\nHuggies came back in and their\npartnership with a multi-million dollar\npledge we're now going to take it to 10\nstates so that pilot program you know\nit's public private Partnerships it's\ncorporate Partners it's using you know\ncelebrity like we did from day one we\njust had Olivia wild Kelly Roland and\nSierra came to help spread the word that\nwe're you know now in 10 states and\nwe're bringing this P pilot program to\n10 states this year and just being able\nto do things like that I think\ndefinitely keeps our days exciting and\nyou know makes it interesting and\nInnovative and I think nonprofit can be\nso I think we're trying to like make\nthat part of nonprofit it doesn't have\nto be boring it doesn't have to be\nstatus quo you know and I think everyone\nwon in that example that Kelly just gave\nabout our uh maternal mortality\ninitiative um in\nthat the the celebrity ambassadors who\nare so amazing the three women that came\nto um get attention for the program they\ncare deeply about maternal mortality\nI'm obviously your audience is familiar\nwith how in the United States the\nmaternal mortality rates are worse than\nthey were 20 years ago and that black\nwomen are dying at three times or four\ntimes up to four times the rate of other\nwomen and I think everyone wants to come\nup with a solution I hope and so in that\nexample it really was a real public\nprivate partnership with again we had\nthe White House and the Department of\nHealth and Human Services on that end\nneeding to give it legitimacy and the\nplatform that they bring to the\ntable Huggies was such an important\npartner on the corporate end because\nthese programs need money and they need\nsupplies and so they had the diapers\nthey had the breastfeeding supplies and\nthey they were able to donate those um\nwomen like Olivia wild and Sierra and\nKelly Roland they careed deeply about\nmaternal mortality and wanted to bring\nuse their platforms use their enormous\nsocial media numbers and bring attention\ninto a problem and show that they were\ncoming up with a solution baby to baby\nhas this incredible team that is there\nto have worked for 13 years to identify\nwhich states and which organizations in\nwhich states have the most vulnerable\nmothers so we could get to the right\nhospitals these items that they so\ndesperately need so I think it it's\nreally attacking I think one of the\nthings that Kelly and I really love\nabout it is attacking these problems\nfrom multiple angles and so yes we bring\nin the like we understand um\nand can explain to people why we need\nthe help of the corporation what the\ngovernment can do to help what part the\ncelebrity or Ambassador can play and I\nthink they all appreciate that and again\nit's led to this great program yeah what\nI'm hearing is like a very deep\nunderstanding of the problem is what's\nallowing you to engage with all these\nstakeholders like the reason you're able\nto get the government involved or get\ncorporations involved or get celebrities\ninvolved is because you deeply\nunderstand the intricacies of the\nchalleng\nand I think often when we want to do\ngood in the world or when we're trying\nto do good in the world we're hoping\nthat that good intention is enough or\nwe're hoping that that passion is enough\nand actually deeply understanding The\nChallenge and the stresses that people\nare experiencing the problems people go\nthrough on a daily basis is at the heart\nof that and one of my favorite uh\nthoughts is from Martin Luther King\nwhere he said that people who love peace\nneed to learn to organize themselves as\nwell as those who love war and I love\nthat statement because I often feel that\nthose of us who want peace in the world\nor goodness in the world can be kind of\na bit woo woo about it or we can be a\nbit like you know peace and love and it\ncan be kind of like this really nice\nidea or nice ideal but it doesn't have\nsystems organization strategy and it\nseems like you've both been able to take\nyour passion and intention and bring\nthat in so wonderfully uh which is such\nan incredible example for so off for\nprofits thank you and I think we really\ndon't differentiate between nonprofit\nand for-profit in that way and so that's\nthat's something that we care about\nreminding people that again the the the\nwork is different but the way that you\nrun a company in our minds should be the\nsame and that's kind of who we model\nourselves after\num unfortunately I I we have seen a lot\nof well-intentioned people not give back\nin the right way so to your point I\nthink in disaster relief in particular\nis an area I know we talked about on\nyour tour and we see a lot of people\ntrying to be helpful in disasters and\ndoing it in an actively unhelpful way\nand that is the place that I think the\nmost we've watched people and it's hard\nto watch and we're trying to kind of\ncorrect people's behaviors in in how\nthey react to disasters\nbecause the public I think and I'm sure\nyour listeners care deeply about\ndisasters and by disasters I'm mainly\ntalking about natural dis so hurricanes\nfires floods\nmudslides people feel so helpless in\nthose moments I think people watch them\non the news they get so much attention\nthey see horrible things happening and\nthey don't know how to help and what\nwe've done at baby to baby is try to\nvery specifically help children and help\nfamilies in those instances because a\nlot of great organizations are helping\nthey're typically focused on adults and\nwe focus on children but in terms of\npeople\nhelping\nin sometimes a misguided way we often go\nto the spots where the disasters are\noccurring and we'll watch people and\nthey show up with bags of used clothing\nand used coloring books or\num unsized things or half opened games\nand toys and things again I think that\npeople care so deeply and they're\nwonderful and they're seeing a child on\nthe news and thinking I need to go I\nwant to go give that child my blanket or\nthis game or a toothbrush but what we've\nlearned is that you have to listen and\nunderstand what these families need and\ntied for as important as that is what\nthe organization who's helping them\nneeds because in an or in a disaster\neveryone is spread thin often the people\nwho are helping in a disaster their own\nfamilies are suffering from that same\nhurricane or fire or flood and so and\nthe organizations are often small\nthey're not always large scale\norganizations often they're small\nvolunteer-based groups that are trying\nto do their best to give out supplies so\nwhen you inundate them with things that\nthey don't need at that time they don't\nhave room they don't have the man or\nwoman power to accept the items people F\nfly planes into places without having a\nthe right destination or um and so we we\ntalked to to Partners who are on the\nground saying these donations are\nblocking the roads so they're not just\nnot helpful they are actively unhelpful\nthey are blocking our roads we are\ntrying to find missing people we are\ntrying to get Emergency Services out and\npeople are in their very very\nwell-intentioned ways really hurting the\nsystem so what what we have learned\norganizationally is to listen so\ncarefully and not just understand you\nneed blankets you need diapers what size\ndiapers do you need how many do you need\nbecause if your space can only\naccommodate three pallets you cannot\nsend them six in the middle of disaster\nyou have to send them three at a time\nand I think for people\nlistening you have to listen to\norganizations you trust in how to help\nit might be money it might be the most\nhelpful thing would be to send $10 to an\norganization it might be an organization\nthat allows you to say we need\ntoothbrushes but you can't guess what\npeople need you have to step back listen\nand then try to help people in the way\nthat they need to be helped absolutely\nyeah know and and it's so again it's\nsuch a alien space when you're not on\nthe ground or you're not aware like it's\nit's just something you would never know\nabout like when do you ever learn about\nwhat's needed in a disaster or how\nyou're trying to help in a\nwell-intentioned way whether it helps or\nit doesn't or or gets in the way so I\nreally appreciate that kind of Spotlight\non that topic which which you wouldn't\ncome across all walk me through like\nyou've like you said and you're both\nmodest and humble beings and so there's\nthe feeling of like there's more to do\nand I think there's a honest side of you\nthat sees that as well and that there's\njust obviously so much more work to do\nbut what goes through some of the\nresistance that came early on like\nbuilding something this big or some of\nthe challenges or pitfalls that you both\nhad days where you woke up wanting to\nmake the biggest change but things\nweren't going in your favor because I\nthink again whenever and this is why I\nlove podcasts it's whenever we hear\nabout something we always hear about how\namazing it is and the glory of it and\nyou don't really get to see like how\nmuch hard work goes into it every single\nday and the times when it isn't the big\ncelebrity turning up to the you know\nfront door and and it's not always like\nthat and yes you've had amazing support\nand I'll we'll talk about that in a\nsecond but that's not you know as we\nwere talking about earlier that's not\n364 days a year there's all of this time\nwhere there's real work happening and\nI'm sure in the and I'm sure getting\nsales tax changed is like a arduous\nprocess with so many you know I'm\nguessing and I could be completely wrong\nbut I'm guessing there's like multiple\nsteps to even get one state to accept\nthat let alone the numbers you have walk\nme through some of the key challenges\nyou've seen in trying to build an\nInnovative fast growing impactful\nnonprofit we talk about this a lot we\nhave yes days and we have no days okay\nwhat is yeah tell me about this so yes\nday is if everything's going right and\nwe're asking this celebrity to host this\nevent for this you know Corporation and\nwe're going to get a donation of 5\nmillion diapers and 5 million wipes and\neverything's going great and they say\nyes and then you're reaching out to a\ndonor and saying oh you know we need a\ngrant for formula the formula shortage\nis still continuing and we are trying to\nprovide like you know a million more\nbottles across the country because\nanother plant is shutting down or we're\nasking for uh sponsor for our holiday\nevent so we can take over Dodger Stadium\nagain this year or back to school so we\ncan take over Madison Square Garden and\nbring kids to like have the most\nspectacular day of their lives and kids\nthat never get to do those things so\nwe're asking all day long for things and\nsome days there's yes days and we get\nyeses and then a lot of days there's no\ndays so we've we got this advice very\nearly on that if you're having a yes day\nkeep asking so we keep asking we keep\ngoing and then when we're having a no\nday we're like oh feels like a no day\nand we'll give like some of our team\nmembers like no day everyone stop asking\nfor things but you know we are not\nafraid to ask and I think we learned\nthis very early on because we're not\nasking for ourselves we're asking for\nchildren who don't have diapers who\ndon't have clothing who don't have food\nfamilies who are struggling to afford\nthese basic things so never are we\nafraid to ask and even if we do get NOS\nwhich we do all the time it may from\nafar appear oh baby to baby's so\nsuccessful sure it looks text and email\nchains where we've written to the person\nlike 15 times and it's all blue or green\nwe're not hearing\nthat yeah we're used to that it doesn't\nmatter because we're not asking for\nourselves or asking for you know\nchildren who are struggling to afford\nthese basic things so it never phases us\ntwo examples of some challenges one is\nwe did not get the sales tax repealed on\nour first try in fact we got very\ndirectly rejected on our first few times\ngoing to\nSacramento trying to get California to\nrepeal the sales tax on California we\njust got big nose and we were sent home\nand packing um but we went back and\nagain I think we really don't take these\nthings personally I think we feel the\ntwo of us that is another thing we share\nwe feel so strongly that our mission\nabout our mission what it is and what\nwe're doing that it it's like well you\nlost the opportunity that's a mistake on\nyour part to the state so we just kept\ngoing back on the third try we brought\nJulie Bowen with us which was helpful\nagain we always learn sometimes an\nambassador is what is what um closes the\ndeal um governor nuum was extremely\nhelpful to us and it was a third time a\ncharm example but we were shut down and\nif we hadn't gone back a number of times\nand of course you're correct that is not\nwhat we post about and talk about the\ntwo the times that we got back on the\nSouthwest flight from Sacramento with a\nbig thumbs down not posting about the\nnose um but it you know it worked and\nthen and so that was a good story I\nthink one of the hardest decisions we've\nhad to make is that at the beginning of\nbaby to\nbaby we would allow people to drop off\nor send us and mailin gently used items\nclothing toys um cribs car seats you\nname it and it was a beautiful thing\nbecause it's really where the name baby\nto baby comes from is the idea of giving\nanother child something that you have\nused and now this other child can grow\nfrom that is wonderful and we hope that\nsmaller organizations continue to do\nthat whether it's organization or a\nreligious institution or a women shelter\nit it's wonderful when people can do it\nwhat we found was in order to scale baby\nto baby that could not be the core of\nour mission because getting tons of\npounds of people's gently used stuff as\nNoble as it sounds was not working for\nus it was expensive to go through\nbecause it's so important to us that\nthat everything we give out is something\nthat is in pristine and perfect\ncondition to these children who deserve\nthings to be in pristine and perfect\ncondition and so we had to have someone\ntouch every single item of clothing and\nsee that a onesie had spit up on it see\nthat a puzzle that was 300 pieces had\n300 pieces and not 258 because no child\nwants to do a puzzle with 258 pieces it\ndoesn't matter who you are and there\nwere expired things there were things\nthat weren't for children and people\nagain again I think they were\nwell-intentioned people but they dropped\nin their\nadults what there some things that we\ngot we got some knives imag kniv sets\nbras all sorts of things and only about\nonethird of what was donated when we\nwere accepting gently used items at best\nonethird was usable wow that's expensive\nand time consuming and not helpful so we\nhave the the lion share of what we do\nnow is all corporate donations um we\ngave out $63 million of goods last year\nuh we still we don't want to scare\npeople off with those numbers because\none a donation of four cans of formula\nis amazing for us there is truly no\ndonation too big or too small because\nfour cans of formula is many bottles for\nmany babies who need it so deeply so we\nlove small and big donations but that\nbut we take new and corporate and\npalletized donations because it's what\nit's the way we're able to give out 50\n450 million items but that was a very\nhard turning point and when you're\ntalking about lessons and challenges um\nI think it was upsetting to a lot of\npeople because I think people really\nlove the idea of passing things forward\nand again we love it too which is why we\nadopted it in the beginning but it\nproved to be not effective for scaling\nand so that was a that was a hard\ndecision to have to make yeah what I'm\nhearing is just this idea that you know\nthese things are beautiful and they are\nwonderful and when we can share what we\nhave and something that's been used in\nadvance and if it helps a community\ncenter or someone in our local or a\nfamily member or something that's\nrecycled is beautiful but when you're\ntrying to scale across a country it's\nand and also disasters as well that\nisn't necessarily the most effective way\nand I feel that that's again going back\nto this idea no wonder time 100 named\nyou one of the most Innovative companies\nlike that lesson of being able to adapt\nand be flexible and learn and grow and\nsay okay well we actually believe in\nthis but it doesn't actually work yeah\nit it's very hard to say that yeah I\ncan't imagine what that feels like\nbecause you're like wait a minute this\nobviously makes sense to us and it makes\nsense to me listening to you both but\nthen like oh I get why that isn't the\nidea that takes off and that isn't the\nidea that works in practice I mean that\nthinking that thought process goes back\nto being a a fast thinking company this\nthese challenges though they they\nhaven't like it feels like you both have\njust got more passionate more driven\nright through them yeah yeah it feels\nlike that like I mean like you know I'm\ntalking to you both today and I don't\nfeel any dwindling of enthusiasm you're\nbuilding it feels like ask us that all\nthe time too they're like oh so are you\nguys you know bored or you feel it at\nall we're like no there's we're reaching\n1 million children across the country\nthere are 10 million more children in\npoverty that we're not yet reaching we\ntalked about we've distributed 200\nmillion diapers we need 1.5 billion and\nthat's just to cover the kids we're\nserving now the 1 million children so we\nhave so much further to go and I don't\nthink either of us are stopping or done\nanytime and we have fun things happen I\nmean we do have we are we've built baby\nto baby to a place and we're so lucky\nabout this with these amazing\nambassadors where we also we we work our\nteam is the hardest working team on the\nplanet but we also get some great\nincoming calls I mean we get calls to\nsay that someone I'm thanking Julie\nBowen again but that Julie Bowen played\non it Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and\nwon $500,000 and where where should she\nsend the check we have Kim Kardashian\nraising her hand at our Gala to give us\nshe's given us over $2 million and then\nwe'll say for our Mother's Day event can\nshe donate skims and the makeup products\nso the moms feel as good as they should\nat Mother's Day we have Christy tan just\nyou know designed a wagon for us and it\nwas for hundreds of thousands of dollars\nfrom a company or we have all these like\nambassadors all day long that are doing\nthese amazing Partnerships Molly Sims\njust did a airwan smoothie to benefit\nbaby to baby just like all day long we\nhave these exciting things and some of\nthem are just incoming and some of them\nwere reaching out to people Jenna danan\nnine months pregnant just hosted our\nMother's Day event and was the\nAmbassador and aquafor gave us an\namazing donation of product and money\nand so just on and on we have these\namazing people supporting us and showing\nup these ideas like the gwena story I\nmean gwenith gets all the credit for\nthat campaign so people are coming to us\nI think once you once we um you know we\nwere saying how we had Sierra at the\nheadquarters the other day and she was\nhelping us amplify this maternal\nmortality project the next day she\ncalled us that she had just talked to a\nsponsor and she wanted to see if she\ncould they could help donate items for\nthese kits in the future she also wanted\nto tell us that she and Russell Wilson\nher husband wrote a children's book\ncould she donate thousands of books to\nput into the bag so I think when we're\nthe more we\neducate all of these women about what\nbaby to bab's doing they then they bring\nus these amazing opportunities because\nthey they want to help and I think other\npeople that haven't that don't have\ncareers in giving back they have\nextremely busy lives but they want to\ngive back they love the idea so if we\ncan give them a tangible way to give\nback and not spend a lot of time and use\ntheir platforms and use their\nconnections they're excited to help and\ndo that I think KLA Harris I think you\nknow we're so grateful she came to the\nwarehouse to launch the program she met\nwith mothers in our program who were\ngiving birth and was hearing from them\nand I think she was also proud to be\nthere so we do we have a lot\nof we have a lot of fun incoming phone\ncalls these days how how was it the\nfirst time like what was walk me through\nthe interaction of getting Jessica galba\nand Nicole Richie to get involved when\nit was just like there was nothing there\nin one sense it was beginning days like\nwhat was that conversation like why did\nthey get involved and well they were\nfriends but also I think um when you're\na mom and you they just both had babies\naround 13 years ago and I think when you\nunderstand that you know you need all\nthese things when you give birth has no\nexperience yeah and you see how much you\nneed you see how expensive it is you see\nthe wastefulness of people are giving\nyou seven strollers for your baby shower\nyou need one stroller what could you do\nwith the other six who could use them\nand it was a lot about that that I think\nyou know mothers parents people connect\nto the cause because it's such a simple\ncause children are going without Basic\nEssentials how could that be what could\nI do to help and we make it very easy we\nsay oh you know what here's what you can\ndo to help we'll make it very easy we'll\nmake it very simple we need you to show\nup here to this one event and they got\ntheir photo taken it was an US Weekly\nand that really put us on the map and\nthat really spurred on like these\ncelebrity Partnerships it taught us the\npower of celebrity what what they could\ndo to help children in need and how we\ncould help make that happen and so we've\ncontinued that for 13 years but we\nreally do look to them as the two people\nwho sort of set off that light bulb for\nboth of us and really started the whole\nthing I think that these women trust us\nand Trust babyto baby and that has been\nso important to build so now when there\nis a you know there's hurricanes going\non and hurricanes and tornadoes in the\nin the midwest when there were the fire\nin Maui when there um was the formula\nshortage when there are news headlines\nthat and people as moms and as humans\ncare about them they call us to say tell\nme how I can help ever since that day so\nthey're saying you know during covid we\nhad Prince Harry and Megan Markle and\nGwen palro and Jen Garner and Jessica\nAlba and um they they came and put\nbackpacks into cars that were driving by\nand putting lunch and backpacks with\nMask full masks putting them into\nwindows in our babyto bab distribution\ndrives because they knew we would have\none they knew we'd be set up and they'd\nbe able to help and so I think what that\ncaused on day one was this trust and\nthen they will disaster is a big part of\nit but when there is a any issue they\ncare about in any state we have\nambassadors from Texas and Oklahoma and\nNew Mexico and New York and they know if\nthere's something big or small sometimes\nit's a a building fire that impacts the\ncity and they know there were families\nthere when they see families and they\nsee babies are outside or not being\ntaken care of they know that baby to\nbab's disaster team is going to be there\nand they call us how can I amplify it\nand sometimes the answer is they can\npost on social media sometimes the\nanswer is even though this person might\nbe famous what we re what we need right\nnow is money so we need you to do one of\ntwo things we need you to ask your\nfollowers for\ndonations or if you're in the position\nwe need you to donate to us yourself so\nin the Maui wildfires for example um\nMatthew and Camila\nmccon Camila is one of our many angels\nand they had a they had a deep caring\nfor Hawaii and Maui knew that we would\nbe on the ground there knew that we\nwould\nknow how to help and what to help with\nthey called they asked how they could\nhelp and the answer there was we were\ntrying to get cargo planes in we knew\nthe exact menu of what these\norganizations needed Maui was a very\nspecific example because it was easier\nfor us our history had been in trucking\nand Maui can't truck to Maui so these\nthings now had to go on planes and it\nwas a and the fires were go ongoing and\nhorrific and they said how can we help\nand we said actually what we need you to\ndo right now is help us pay for this\nfirst cargo plane to get out cu we know\nif you do that others will follow so\nthey that was just pure funds they gave\nus the cargo plane went out it got to\nMaui we helped so many families nine\nmonths later we're still helping\nfamilies disasters do not end a week\nlater the families there's still\ndisplaced families there's families\nliving in hotels there's families that\nhave lost jobs and because of that\ninitial vote of confidence from two very\nwell-known ambassadors we had people all\nover the country sending us $25\ndonations that add up significantly and\nhave allowed us to have this long-term\nrecovery and Matthew did a video with\nhis son that went viral and it was you\nknow everywhere it was all over\nInstagram it was in people and it was\nsaying like this is what my family's\ndoing I want to help these families in\nMaui we're going to come together and\nwe're donating this amount please join\nus and because that video went viral and\nhe used his platform\nand that really took off in such a way\nthat's why we've been able to continue\nhelping for 9 months because we were\nable to raise that money in that moment\nand that really extended our you know\nfinances to be able to pay and ship and\nsend more and more pallets and pallets\nof Basic Essentials into Maui for the\nfamilies we serve there and speaking of\nMaui a quick shout out to our program\nand disaster relief teams something that\nmade us so proud during that\nhorrific period was that because of the\nyear round work we do getting to know\nthese Partners listening to them our\nteam had two days before the fires broke\nout had made a delivery on Hawaii so\nthat when it was impossible to get\nanything in from the mainland United\nStates our stuff had just landed because\nwe were helping families who were living\nin\npoverty beyond the fires and so\nimmediately we were able to start\nDistributing and talking about you know\nlistening to the community and listening\nand asking questions and seeing what's\nneeded we have these partners that are\nin Maui and we were able to say to them\ndo you need help do you need you know\nwhat do you need and the water was\ncontaminated and babies there was no\nbaby food there was no formula so we\nimmediately were able to send on that\nvery first cargo plane water formula and\nbaby food and then our team later two\nweeks later because we didn't want to\ninundate the island with you know at the\ntime I think there was such outpouring\nbut to listen and wait and talk to our\npartners and they asked us to come two\nweeks later and then we were able to do\ndistributions on the ground to families\nourselves and really see the need and\nmeet with families but we were alongside\na woman who had lost her home who worked\nfor the diaper bank that it was our\npartner she lost her home her you know\nher baby was off in the you know Office\nof the nonprofit that we were serving\nshe was there alongside us doing\ndistribution so you really have have to\nlisten to the community that you're\nserving and that was something we\ndefinitely learn with everything we do\nbut that was definitely a learning\nmoment for us this is it's such\nincredible work and it's so inspiring\nlike even hearing these stories of all\nthese different spaces and the nuances\nand the differences and the incredible\nambassadors that came on board I know\nthat a lot of my community here today\nwho's listening and watching will be\nthinking how do I help how do I get\ninvolved and I think as that culture\nthat I think you both have lived in your\nown life and one to create and something\nthat I feel is amazing is if we can\nstart helping from where we are no\nmatter where we are and whoever we are\nand every like you said everything does\nmatter and it does make an impact and\nI've seen that through fundraisers we've\ndone for Charities I've worked with what\ncan this community and audience do if\nthey want to support baby to baby today\nwhere should they go what can they do\nhow can they learn more I think we say\nevery little bit helps and when we say\nwe've distributed 200 million diapers\nthat's a big number\nbut one pack of diapers goes to a family\nwho's struggling to afford diapers or\nfood who's choosing between diapers or\nfood so if you can give one pack of\ndiapers five packs of diapers whether\nthat's $10 or $25 those things really\nmake a difference and we we always say\nno donation is too small those things\nreally matter to us and that's one\nfamily who has formula for their baby\nwho has diapers for their baby that week\nso we're not uh shying away from any\nsmall donations at all and a lot of what\nwe do is on our Instagram baby to baby\nand um or our website baby to.org but\none of the things that we talk about as\nwell is that you know follow us and see\nwhat we're doing we are posting all day\nyou know what we're doing right now\nsending um supplies we just sent 300,000\nsupplies to Oklahoma and Texas to the\ndisasters that are going on there so\nit's always you know some's happening in\nthe world climate change is really\nmaking these disasters worse and worse\nevery day and supporting our work\nhelping families in need in those\nmoments is really important to us I hope\nyou've learned getting to know us we're\nvery direct and so we'll be direct with\nour followers and I think we tell our\nambassadors and any donor or fan of baby\nto baby we will tell you what we need\nand so we'll say we right now need\ntoothbrushes and toothpaste because\nthere is a reason that there is a\nshortage of those or we will tell you in\nthe formula crisis what we need exactly\nand even though I did say that we don't\ntake you know we're not looking for big\ndonations of gently used clothing there\nare some exceptions to that and that's\nbasically diapers and formula and some\nof these top things so it might be your\nown diaper packs and formula cans that\nyou haven't opened it might be going on\nAmazon or another platform and sending\nus actual items it might be making us\nsmall or large donation it might be an\nintroduction to a company that can make\na very large donation um but it might be\nthat you have a small clothing brand and\nyou have you made some pajamas and they\ncame out in a slightly different color\nthan you intended and we would love to\ntake those and it might be that your\ntoothpaste came out a different um\nflavor and as long as it's good and\nhealthy we want those calls would you\nlike our you know these palletes of\ntoothpaste that we haven't given out\num so we we again following us means\ntrying to listen to what the disaster is\nwhat the everyday poverty is if there's\na specific city or town or um that\nyou're in we're happy to respond to\nthose questions our team is uh but we\nwant people to help in those um and and\nif someone wants to donate millions of\ndollars so we can reach our goal of\ngiving out you know we can get to all\nbillion Di\nyou know if someone has a foundation who\nwill do that we're ready for that phone\ncall as well ex we say that we've built\nthe infrastructure and we know how to\nget these items out to the community and\nto the country and we're just looking\nfor the funding to go even F further so\nthe 1 million children we're serving\nthere are 10 million that we're not yet\nreaching and we are ready to reach them\nit's just really funding that comes down\nto it we also have programs where people\ncan get involved at different ages so if\nyou live in an area that's you know if\nyou live live in Los Angeles or New York\nor somewhere where we have volunteer\nsessions obviously you can come in and\nvolunteer but we also have programs that\nthe whole country can participate in\nwhere during the holidays you can shop\nfor a child but not just during the\nholidays because a big lesson of baby to\nbaby is you children do not just need\nhelp during the holidays so we have\nprograms that are about to start this\nsummer because there is a summer slide\nand children aren't in school and so not\nonly are they not getting the meal the\nschooling during the summer they're not\ngetting the meals that they depend on\nfor schools so uh so they're they're\nlacking in Basic Essentials even more\nand so we have programs we have back to\nschool programs where you can take your\nchild out shopping or go yourself and\nyou can shop and we'll give you a list\nof what a child needs and maybe they\nwant a blue Hello Kitty backpack and\ncheit and a new pencil case with um pen\ncarts and you can really a lot of people\nlike that again that specificity and\nthat customization we will let you you\ncan reach a child on a very\nindividualized basis or you can help us\nwith a donation of 600,000 pairs of\npajamas that's beautiful I love it I\nwant to go back to where we started uh\nwhich was your personal journeys of\nservice and giving back and Nora you\nbrought this up earlier this idea of\nparents wanting their children to have a\nculture of giving back what have you\nfound works because I find like when\nyou're young giving back is not cool\nit's not the thing to do it's it it\nisn't part of our culture ordinarily at\nleast I you don't see that very commonly\nhow how do we do that how do we create a\nculture in our families to begin with a\nculture of giving a culture of service\nin young people like what is that take\nwhat have you seen Works what doesn't\nwork and what has been effective we\nwrote a book about it actually um we\nwrote a book with Jessica Alba and it is\nabout a little girl who has a teddy bear\nand it is a gently used teddy bear and\nthen she receives the same one but a\nbrand new one and she has to decide what\nshe's going to do with the second one\nwill she keep it will she give it to a\nfriend when are you g to tell that don't\nspoil it yes and then when she decides\nto give it to a friend the you know she\ngoes through the process of which one\nshould I give to him should he have the\none with no eye and missing an arm or\nshould she should he have the new one\nand he she talks about with her mom and\nthey figure out that of course someone\nwho's in need would want a new bear just\nlike one day you had one so that was\nsomething that we did because it's so\nimportant to us to teach children how to\ngive back but to give back with dignity\nbecause all of the children that we're\nserving we want to make sure that we're\ngiving with dignity and pride so that\nthey're receiving things that are new\nand just like our kids would want so\nthat was something that was really\nimportant to us I think you can teach\nyour kids at the earliest of Ages to\ngive back and you know maybe they'll\nunderstand 5% of it and then 20% of it\nwe have stories of taking your kids to\ngo shopping for another child and when\nwhen you when they're four maybe they\nstop in the store and have a and cry and\nsay I want that toy I don't want to give\nthat Barbie to someone else but you hold\nyour ground you don't give them the\nBarbie you explain the Barbie is for\nsomeone else and when they're six it\nstarts being easier and maybe when\nthey're seven or eight they're asking\nyou to go shopping for a Barbie to give\nto someone at Christmas that doesn't\nhave it because now they understand or\nthey're an adult and they look back and\nunderstand why they were doing that and\nthey start doing it as an adult but I\nthink people are afraid to\nexplain poverty to their children in\nparticular at too young of an age and\nwe've just been Amazed by the children\nthat come into baby to baby the children\nthat come to volunteer they have such\namazing questions and they understand\nand they point out things that we\nwouldn't even thought of you know you'll\nsay to them what do you think a child\nmight need if if you didn't have a home\nwhat might you need and you think\nthey're going to say\num you know food or and they'll say like\nI think they would need a nightlight or\nI think you know they just say things\nthat surprise you and they are paying\nattention and I do think they understand\nand I think you have to drive on the\nstreet and not ignore people\nexperiencing homelessness I think you\nhave to point it out to your children\nand talk about what you should do and\ntalk about how they can help and let\nthem think about do we want to can we\nhelp with money can we can we give them\nfood can we talk about why and how\nthey're suffering and why they don't\nhave a job and I think you have to bring\nyour children to any opportunity you\nhave to participate in community service\nI think it just changes people's\nperspective entirely to practice to to\nread about it yes to hear about it from\nyour parents yes to hand someone who\ndoesn't have food a a bag full of food I\nreally think changes your life and\nchanges your perspective and I think\nchildren I think children are it's a\ngreat place to start I love that about\nbaby to baby that there's a lot of\nproblems in the world I think people\neveryone can relate whether you have\nkids you don't have kids you are a kid\nyou are elderly people understand and\nresonate with the idea of children not\nhaving Basic Essentials and clean\ndiapers and they empathize with children\npeople love babies and so I think it's a\ngreat place to start is that a baby\nneeds this and you should talk early and\ntalk often and show them and teach them\nand bring them and do everything you can\nto instill it at a young age and I we've\nseen it working yeah my daughter I\nremember when I took her for the\nChristmas shopping we call it family to\nfamily because it's one family giving to\nanother family like baby to baby um and\nit was the moment where you know yes I\nwant the Barbie yes I want the pink Elsa\nnighty too but then when we got down the\nlist and I was like okay well we need\nunderwear should we get Elsa underwear\nor should we get Sleeping Beauty\nunderwear and she looked at me and she\nwas like she doesn't have underwear and\nyou want to protect your child maybe in\nthat moment and I was like no she\ndoesn't have underwear she doesn't have\nany of these things and having like the\nlight bulb for her and her understand\nlike we weren't just buying her a Barbie\nlike she didn't have underwear she\ndidn't have a blanket she didn't have a\nwarm coat and really like I think\ninstilling that into your kids or kids\naround you is just so important it's\nsomething that you know both of us want\nto make sure that baby to baby is\nteaching children about giving back what\ndo you think parents are scared of in in\ndoing that like you said like facing the\nhomelessness having that moment in\nsaying no she doesn't have underwear\nlike\nthey think they're too young to\nunderstand or it's too like scary the\nreality is too scary but I think being\nable to tell them from a young age and\nobviously in a age appropriate way but\nthat's what we try and do we try and\nkeep you know kids come in from seven\nand up and they're volunteering and they\nthey understand there's a baby who\ndoesn't have a blanket who doesn't have\na onesie who doesn't have a paci and I'm\ngoing to make this for them and I'm\ngoing to put this together for them and\nthen when I leave here it's going to get\ndeliver delivered to them and I made it\nand that Pride that kids feel in that is\nreally important and I think really\ninstills that giving back in them and\nmaybe you can consider for your birthday\nparty either having people give presents\nfor kids who need presents more than you\ndo or if that's difficult which it is\nand I'm not saying mine we're so excited\nabout it I think sometimes our kids were\nlike wait does this mean I never get a\nBarbie I just want to be clear cuz we\nare just constantly telling them over\nand over\nwe have a joke where where we would put\ntheir baby blanket in the car and they'd\nbe like is that going to baby to baby\nand we'd be like no no you get to keep\nthat right um but but the part but it\ncould be maybe you choose one toy that\nyou got out of the 12 kids that came to\nyour party and you pick one toy and you\ngive that away or you you know just\nlittle little ways to start\nincorporating it early and as far as\nwhat people are scared of I think I\nthink adults are scared of people\nexperiencing homelessness that's why\nthink they're scared to tell their kids\nbecause they're uncomfortable but I\nactually think kids are much more\ncomfortable and so if we can raise this\ngeneration to not be afraid and to think\nof ways to help I think that's our\nthat's Our obligation I know that I said\nthis but I think this concept that I\nlearned as a little girl of takuna Lum\nand Sedaka and repairing the world I\nthink it it sticks with you and you you\nhave to trust that these kids are going\nto be a generation that are going to\nthink you know you said before maybe\npeople don't think it's trendy or cool I\nI think I think most people with\ncompanies will would say that their\ncustomers feel otherwise and they only\nwant to buy from companies who have a\ngive back component and it's not just\nToms anymore and that we have companies\ncalling us all day saying we have to\nfind it we are giving back and again yes\nbecause they're have a wonderful\nleadership teams but their customers\ndemand it and so if this generation of\nchildren can grow up saying\nwe we are going to be a part of this\nchange then I think um and that's just\nbeen kind of a bonus of baby to baby\nbecause we didn't start it to teach kids\nto give back we started it to first and\nforemost we want kids who don't have\nwhat they need to have what they need\nand we want children in poverty to have\nBasic Essentials but there is this bonus\nis that in the process if it can teach\npeople who do have what they need to be\na part of the solution I think that\nthat's where the special stuff comes in\nell and Nora you're both phenomenal\nleaders truly inspiring I'm very touched\nby both your stories and even the space\nwe just got to now of hearing this deep\npersonal much more individual intimate\nversion of what it looks like in your\nfam is with your own children with with\npeople around you I mean it's it's\nreally truly moving and before we end\nthe show we always do a final five which\nis a Fast Five segment where you have to\nanswer every word\nin sorry you have to answer every\nquestion in one word or one sentence\nmaximum but before we do that I want to\nask you is there anything that I haven't\nasked you that you really feel compelled\nto share or something that's on your\nheart that you feel you want to share\nwith my community or audience that maybe\nwe didn't touch on just that um baby to\nbaby is you know growing every day 13\nyears later we are serving a million\nchildren and we've distributed 450\nmillion items and that from afar that it\nmay seem like a success but because\nthere are still 10 million children that\nwe're not reaching we have a lot further\nto go and a lot more work to do so\nlooking from afar or looking on\nInstagram may it may seem like we're\ndone or everything's great but no\nthere's a lot of work to be done and we\nneed to raise a lot more money and to\nreach a lot more kids so it's we're not\nfinished and we definitely need help\nyeah brilliant well said y nor right\nI concur we talk about that we know that\nwe get you know we're lucky to get that\nour ambassadors get attention we are so\nlucky to be on J shete we have all of\nthis these great platforms but the only\nnegative of it is that it does lead\npeople to think that we don't need help\nor that their help isn't enough because\nthey see if Kim Kardashian is\nhelping what how could I really be of\nhelp and if they on you know when we're\ntalking about $12 million well I don't\nhave $12 million to give and so I concur\nit's the same lesson of please know that\nno donation is too small celebrities are\nwonderful they are not fully funding our\nprogram we and we need we do need so\nmuch and it it really is the entire\nCommunity coming together that is going\nto allow us to keep doing more and more\nwork I think what's really beautiful\nalso is that I'm sure some of our\nlisteners inside organizations that\ncould be giving more and part of\ncommunities that could give more and\nmaybe want their school to come and\nvolunteer you know I think there's so\nmany beautiful ways to give back which\nis how I got involved with all of you\nwhich is um my team and I picked you to\ncome and volunteer at for a service day\nand it's led to a a more longer term\nrelationship and I think that I think\nyou have so many access points and I\nalso want to encourage everyone to to\nhear that message too that I think what\nwe can trust is that you're listening\nyou're learning you're adapting you're\nfiguring out what the Gap is and that's\nwhy we can all help and support in that\nwe can trust that baby to baby is\nconstantly trying to figure out what\nreally serves the need what really\ncloses the Gap what really is going to\nhave an impact well thank you and you\nknow 13 years in we view ourselves as a\nstartup still and we really have this\nstartup mentality where we are looking\nfor the phone to ring and we are looking\nfor other people to bring our team\ninnovative ideas IDE\nand we want that help we want someone to\nsay I have shoes but I have an idea um\nand so yeah Nike if you're listening\nwe're desperately in need of sneakers\ngot it all right I we we'll have to\nwe'll have to go we're ready for the\ngame no I love it yes H thank you so\nmuch all right here's your Fast Five\nfinal five same questions to both of you\nI'll just say the question and then we\ncan go for it okay so the first question\nis what is the best advice you've ever\nheard or received\nI would say we talked about it the yes\nday I think saying yes to Opportunities\nespecially in the beginning we've had to\nreel that in a little 13 years later but\nsaying yes to Opportunities was a big\npart of how we grew baby to baby from\nday one first day at my law firm scad\nand Arps in New York 136 Associates\nmanaging partner came out and said I\nwant you to assume that every single\nemail you write will appear on the New\nYork Times tomorrow morning be careful\nand I that's good it to heart great both\ngreat answers uh question number two\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nheard or received that 8 hour sleep\nisn't necessary isn't necessary I agree\nwith it is for me too I agree with you\num to that you have to go out of your\nlane I know lots of Business Leaders\nthink you have to\nkeep going outside of your lane I think\nin our case we have a very specific\nMission we are nowhere near done with\nwhat we're doing we I want our lane to\nbe as narrow as possible and then we\nwant to crush our lane nice uh third\nquestion what is your proudest\nachievement personally I guess baby to\nbaby it can totally be baby yeah I think\nbaby to baby I mean I think something\nspecific of baby to baby maybe I think\nwhen we started we were serving 500\nchildren and it was the two of us in one\nintern and looking 13 years later that\nwe're serving a million children across\nthe country and we have warehouses\nacross the country employees here in La\njust the growth of baby to baby is\ndefinitely a proud achievement for me\nbeautiful we were just honored to be\nnamed to\ntimes's most influential 100 people in\nthe world list we absolutely take that\non behalf of our incredible team of\npeople it is certainly not just the two\nof us um I read Time Magazine with my\ndad growing up and would look at the\ncovers every week and read it and um\nthat honor for baby to baby was a big\none yeah I love that too I love that\nthey honored a service-based\norganization rather than just a a\nfor-profit organization as well so\nthat's beautiful uh question number\nfour why is it important to serve and\ngive back I think the world needs it\nespecially right now and I think that if\nyou think about you know elections and\noutcomes of Elections that organizations\nlike baby to baby are so important\nbecause it's not based on the outcome of\nthat it's based on helping families in\nneed and meeting them where they are and\nmaking sure they have what is necessary\nand Basic Essentials no matter what's\ngoing on in the environment and in the\nworld I think giving back is everything\nI think it it's because it's not about\nyou so I think it is the number one way\nto learn empathy and about other people\nand to remind yourself that everyone is\ngoing through something everyone needs\nhelp and giving back is about others\nwell said and Fifth and final question\nwhich we ask to every guest who's ever\nbeen on the show if you could create one\nlaw that everyone in the world had to\nfollow what would it be mine would be\nthat people and leaders Le LED with\nempathy I would say that service is\nmandatory and not just for high school\nstudents or interns that it's mandatory\nfor people of all ages from every\nbackground and I think people if they're\nnot allergic should have\ndogs I love that nor and Kelly thank you\nso much for being such phenomenal guests\non on purpose everyone who's been\nlistening and watching I hope you go and\nfollow baby to baby right now I want you\nto look at how you can find a way that\nyou can help your communities can help\nyour company can help the schools around\nyou that can help how can you get\ninvolved D in being a part of this\nMission I think when we feel like we're\na part of the solution the problem feels\na little smaller every single day and so\nI encourage you all to become empowered\nto take on this opportunity to join nor\nand Kelly on this Mission and again\nnoran and Kelly thank you so much I'm so\ngrateful to have spent this time with\nyou thank you for being here with my\ncommunity and congratulations on all the\nwork you've done and I'm rooting for you\nand forever in your corner to see you\nsucceed so thank you so much much thanks\nfor having us thank you if you enjoyed\nthis podcast you're going to love my\nconversation with Michelle Obama where\nshe opens up on how to stay with your\npartner when they're changing and the\nfour check-ins you should be doing in\nyour relationship we also talk about how\nto deal with relationships when they're\nunder stress if you're going through\nsomething right now with your partner or\nsomeone you're seeing this is the\nepisode for you no wonder our kids are\nstruggling we have a new technology and\nwe've just Tak it in Hook Line in Sinker\nand we have to be mindful for our kids\nthey'll just be thumbing through this\nstuff you know they're their mind's\nnever sleeping"
