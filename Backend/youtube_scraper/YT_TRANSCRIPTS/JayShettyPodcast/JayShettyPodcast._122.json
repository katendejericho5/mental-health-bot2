    "transcript": "the hardest part for me with meditating\nis that I instantly fall asleep i' I can\nfall asleep very easily good so I'll\ntell you why though the reason why that\nhappens during meditation or any\npractice of that sort is your body and\nmind are finally coming into syn and so\nit's your body saying I need sleep right\nnow yeah and so if if you're falling\nasleep during meditation it's not a bad\nthing it's just you've literally because\nwhat's happening when you're not falling\nasleep is your mind saying we got to do\nmore we got to do more and then finally\nwhen you become present you fall asleep\nbecause your body saying I've done\nenough today"
