    "transcript": "don't identify with your wealth your\nfinancial wealth a lot of people they\ntheir self-identity is determined by\ntheir net worth makes me think of Jim\nCarrey we're in the land of films and\nmovie stars right here and he said you\nknow I wish everyone could be rich and\nfamous to realize it doesn't make a\ndifference and so it's almost as if\nwe're going through life we all have\nholes within us and we're looking for\nouter things to fill the holes and I\nguess what I would humbly suggest is\nnothing on the outside will ever fill\nthe holes we're trying to fill on the\ninside"
