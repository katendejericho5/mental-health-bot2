    "transcript": "I think we're born into genius and then\nwe resign ourselves into ordinary and we\nbecome busy being busy and we're playing\nwith our phones and we're doing what\neveryone else is doing but deep inside\nwe have a voice of wisdom that sees the\nself-\nBetrayal and we're in pain because\npotential unexpressed turns to pain so\nwe're in pain but we don't know it and\nso that's why we medicate ourselves with\ntoo much phone too much digital too much\nwork too much scrolling too much\ngossiping because we don't like\nourselves"
