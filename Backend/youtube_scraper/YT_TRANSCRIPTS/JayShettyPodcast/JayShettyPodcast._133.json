    "transcript": "what's the point of climbing this\nmountain that the world says we should\nclimb in order to be successful and\nhappy and realize at the end of a career\nthe end of a life we've climbed the\nwrong Mountain International\nbest-selling author 20 million plus copy\nsold one of the world's top leadership\nexperts Robin Sharma I've mentored a lot\nof super rich people and money is all\nthey have how does one balance ambition\nwithout\nattachment hey everyone I've got some\nhuge news to share with you in the last\n90 days\n79.4% of our audience came from viewers\nand listeners that are not subscribed to\nthis channel there's research that shows\nthat if you want to create a habit make\nit easy to access by hitting the\nSubscribe button you're creating a habit\nof learning how to be happier healthier\nand more healed this would also mean the\nabsolute world to me and help us make\nbetter bigger brighter content for you\nin the world subscribe right now the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nJ shett the one the only\nJett when we talk about living a rich\nlife when we talk about living a full\nlife it's a really interesting\nconversation because I think all of us\nhave grown up with definitions of what a\ngood life looks like and obviously in\nthe book you break down the eight hidden\nhabits as you call them of of the areas\nthat matter but you you have so many\namazing chapters in it that that're dive\ninto the depths of it and the one first\none that resonated with me was don't be\na resentment\ncollector and when I looked at that\nchapter I was thinking about people I\nknow in my life I was thinking about\npeople I speak to and I realized that\nactually it's very easy because life can\nbe hard because life can be challenging\nto collect our resentments to place them\non a wall almost as as art and to refer\nto them and talk about them and find\nvalidation and value through\nthem what's the resentment that you've\nseen people carry around for the longest\nperiod of time well so you said a lot of\ninteresting things in there and the\nfirst the first thing is there has been\na cultural hypnosis Jay that you are\nrich when you have a lot of money you're\nrich when you have a big stock portfolio\nyou're rich when you get to the top of\nthe financial Mountain and for 15 plus\nyears this is something I've experienced\nmentoring billionaires Sports Superstars\nCEOs movement makers a lot of these\npeople sadly are cash rich and their\nlife poor and so what's the point of\nclimbing this mountain that the world\nsays we should climb in order to be\nsuccessful and happy and realize at the\nend of a career the end of a life we've\nclimbed the wrong Mountain so this book\nis based around as you know the eight\nforms of wealth now I want to be really\nclear money is one of the forms of\nwealth money puts food on the Family\nTable it gives us freedom it allows us\nto do great things for people in need\nhaving said that there are seven other\nforms of wealth the first form of wealth\nis growth we were talking about that\nbefore we started to be in Hot Pursuit\nof your finest self is a form of wealth\nto spend your days doing a little bit of\nwork on yourself so you know more of\nyour gifts and your talents so you build\nwisdom\nso you build Wonder so you build bravery\nas a form of wealth and so in that first\nsection there's 25 chapters one of them\nis don't be a resentment collector and I\nreally do think that a lot of us go\nthrough life and people hurt us and\nrather than process through it\nmetabolize the hurt and use pain as a\npurifier we swallow it and we allow it\nto build up and it creates what I call\nin the book A resentment stack and it's\nthat old idea you know heal what hurt\nyou so you don't go out there and bleed\non people who didn't cut you and so\nmoving through as you know entrepreneurs\ndon't really talk about forgiveness and\nathletes usually don't but if we move\nthrough the forgiveness and let the\npeople who've hurt us off of our\nbacks we build intimacy with our\ncreativity we get to know ourselves\nenergy Rises Wellness Rises and and we\njust become more of the people people\nwere meant to be I find often don't you\nfeel this\nthat humans oscillate between extremes\nso often we have a culture that idolizes\nmoney and then we sometimes develop a\nmindset that demonizes money we have a\nculture that may idolize Fame and then\nwe demonize Fame we idolize success and\nthen we demonize success and we're not\ngreat at finding the neutralized the\npure ified\nversion\nwhich not only are we deeply seeking but\nseems to be the healthiest place to land\nand so you spoke about and I was very\nhappy to see that money is one of the\nforms of wealth and you're just\nexpanding that there are seven others\nbut I find that often when people hear\nlike and and I think I I've been very\nclear that I've never talked about how\nmoney doesn't buy happiness because I\nthink money is a really powerful energy\nand Powerful resource which you of\ncourse talk about in this book as well\nbut why do you think or how do we stop\nourselves from idolizing and then\noscillating to demonizing and what is\nthe middle path like what is that\nperspective that we need to develop\nthat's a beautiful question allow money\nto be your servant not your master and\nit's that old proverb be in the world\nbut not of the world so be in the world\nmake money there's 25 chapters on how\nthe billionaires do it make money have\nnice things go through life treat\nyourself treat your family having said\nthat don't identify with your wealth\nyour financial wealth a lot of people\nthey their self-identity is determined\nby their net worth makes me think of Jim\nCarrey we're in the land of films and\nmovie stars right here and he said you\nknow I wish everyone could be rich and\nfamous to realize it doesn't make a\ndifference and so it's almost as if\nwe're going going through life we all\nhave holes within us and we're looking\nfor outer things to fill the holes and I\nguess what I would humbly suggest is\nnothing on the outside will ever fill\nthe holes we're trying to fill on the\ninside so have the nice car have the\nnice house take the Great\nVacations but don't be defined by those\nand don't think those things are going\nto somehow make your wake up one Friday\nmorning feeling fantastic and that's\nwhere the other seven forms of wealth\ncome in money is one of the forms of\nwealth but there are seven others for\nexample growth Wellness family craft and\nthose kinds of things as we pursue them\nI mean for example number form of wealth\nnumber three family I've mentored a lot\nof super rich people and money is all\nthey have you know I've been to places\nwhere I remember one in particular I\nwrite about it I was asked to attend um\nan assignment to Mentor someone most\nbeautiful house I've ever seen I walked\nby his art collection walked by his car\ncollection\nindoors walked by his book collection\nwent to a Subterranean passage smelt\ncigar finally got to the room where the\nTitan of industry was and we talked for\ntwo hours and through the conversation I\nasked him I said J so who do you share\nall this with must be amazing you must\nbe able to do anything with the people\nyou love and there was just a long long\nsilence\nand he has no family and they won't talk\nto him he's all alone and so what's the\npoint of having the beautiful house and\nall the nice things if you don't have\nsomeone to share with it with you know I\nwas um recently with my parents my dad\nwill be 87 in in June\nand the more years I get behind my belt\nthe more I realize like family is so\nincredibly important uh there's a\nchapter have three great friends yeah\nbet that's one of my list right not not\na thousand or or whatever digital\nfriends three great friends that allow\nyou to be seen and you can be yourself\nwith and that's a that's a form of of\nriches in that chapter on or that\nsection on family there's also something\ncalled the 10,000 dinners\nroom and that comes from Aisha Vegs one\nof the UK's most famous divorce lawyers\nand she was asking you know look you've\nseen so many relationships fall fall\napart can you share what makes a great\nrelationship number one she said\nseparate bedrooms and number two she\nsaid 10,000 dinners if you can see\nyourself having 10,000 dinners with\nsomeone because looks and Fades lust\nmight dissolve but if you can see\nyourself having 10,000 dinners with\nsomeone hold them close because great\nlove is hard to find how does one\nbalance ambition without attachment\nbecause I feel that the natural cause of\nevents for most of us is we have\nambition or drive we then have\nachievement and then that achievement\nleads to attachment because our value\nbecomes our ability to get things or our\nability to have achieved how do you have\nbut not have the attachment is the\nquestion I think human beings are built\nto\nprogress I mean I think we are happiest\nnot when we're resting and there's\nthere's a lot in the wealth money Camp\nbuy about recovery enjoying life and all\nthose things\nhaving said that I think we are happiest\nwhen we are materializing our PL Primal\ngifts we are happiest when we are\nchasing what I call your Project X we're\nhappiest when we're moving in the\ndirection of our Mount Everest that's so\nambition is not a bad thing I would say\nwhat's the root of it though what's\ndriving you are you driving it is it\ndriving you from an un healthy place are\nyou doing it for FFA fame fortune and\nApplause are you doing it because really\ndeep inside you're overcompensating you\ndon't like yourself very much so you're\nhoping to get the Applause in the world\nto make yourself feel better but if you\nare\nambitious and creating your tajma holes\nor your catcher in the Ry or your\nMoonlight sunata because you want to\npush magic into the world if you're\ndoing it because you're in pursuit of a\ncraft the fourth form of wealth pursuing\na craft if you're doing it because you\nwant to be of\nservice mahat mandhi I know one of your\nHeroes as well he said to lose yourself\nin service in others is to find yourself\nso if that's what's driving you then I\nbelieve your ambition is absolutely\nhealthy and and and only good absolutely\nI couldn't agree more I think and what's\nreally interesting about that way you\nprocess ambition is that it's so\ninternal externally two people could\nlook like they're living the same exact\nlife but internally they're living a\ncompletely different one because one is\nmotivated by attachment and one is\nmotivated by service right one is\nmotivated by FFA as you said and one is\nmotivated by service it's it can only\nactually ever be known by the individual\nand those closest to them and one of the\nthings that I know my audience struggled\nwith I know that my friends struggle\nwith there know people in my life and I\nread this chapter I was like this is the\none that I'm going to tell them to\nlisten to and read immediately you say\nthe best way to start is to start and I\nfind that everyone I know or a lot of\npeople I know I should say struggle to\nstart because they're so scared of what\npeople will say they're so scared of\nwhat people will think they're so scared\nof rejection they're scared of failure I\nspoke to a friend the other day he said\nto me he said Jay I struggle with trying\nnew things because since I was young I\nkind of followed a path I went to\ncollege I knew I was going to study this\nparticular thing so I got that degree I\nonly applied to two jobs and I got both\nof them because I'd studied the right\ndegree and so I've never really had a\ndoor shut on me before so now that I\nwant to do something different it's\nimpossible to think that nine out of 10\ndoors May close so I find that so many\npeople struggle to start even though we\nknow it's the place to start because\nthey're so scared of re ection lack of\nvalidation or failure so how do we how\ndo we start when that's what's going on\nin our head how do you write the book\nthat'll change the world you go home and\nyou write the first\npage how do you get super fit if you\nwant to get super fit you go on the\nfirst walk how do you find true love if\nyou are all\nalone you talk to that person in the\ngrocery store as simple as it sounds if\nyou look at the great monuments Taj\nMahal 22 years one of the wonders in the\nworld it started with the first block\nanother wonder of the world the Great\nPyramid of\nGiza 2500 blocks 50,000 workers one of\nThe Monuments the world looks to it\nstarted with that first stone so I was\nin Dubai on a radio show and this\nwonderful broadcaster asked me like you\nknow this is all fantastic and so where\ndo we start and I think you're right the\nvery question\nspeaks of some degree of fear because\nunderneath it is really exactly what\nyou're saying if\nI stand in my true power if I live my\nvalues if I chase my ethical Ambitions\nif I live the life I truly want to live\nif I let go of the energy vampires and\nfill my life with people whose lives I\nwant to be living if I become all those\nthings what if I fail What If I Stumble\nwhat if I get laughed\nat and that's where I think it's really\nimportant to remember the shortness of\nlife and that's why people when they\ntalk about\nmortality they go they almost apologize\nsorry to talk about the shortness of\nlife\nor but I think talking about the\nshortness of Our Lives is inspirational\nbecause when we remember how quick a\nhuman life goes by no matter how long we\nget to live and when we make maybe every\nday in our meditations or in our\njournaling and our private conversations\nwe remind ourselves soon or late we will\nbe nothing more than a pile of dust on a\nmantle above a fireplace next to Little\nLeague trophies number one we don't take\nourselves too seriously and number two\nwe live to the point I think what we are\nas human beings is we are great\npostponers we are busy being busy we are\nmaximalists versus minimalists we put\noff we're going to do these things later\nbut accident\nillness death all those things are a\npart of life and I think it it's simple\nas it sounds it's really important one\nof the chapters in in the book is Put\nYour Last Day first another chapter at\nthe end is having have a living funeral\nbuy the cake buy the daisies invite your\nfamily hear what they would say about\nyou tell them how much you love them and\nremind yourself that life is really very\nshort what have you seen in the people\nthat you've coached people that you've\nworked with seminars for you know 25\nyears or more\nnow what have you\nseen has allowed people to give\nthemselves the permission to fail like\nwhere have you seen people become\ncomfortable with discomfort and failure\nwhat has been that habit or that\npractice that has made them go this is\nokay this is normal wow I would say\nfirst of all MVP as you know in\nathletics MVP is most valuable player\nand that's an acronym I use for\nmeditation visualization and prayer so\nyou know I wrote the 5 am. club and for\nyears I I get up at 5: and I do the\nvictory\nhour but these days I get up at 4 and\nit's really beautiful for me I I live in\nthis old farmhouse in Tuscany and I hear\nthe roosters off in the disc dist and I\nhear these dogs barking and I just lay\nthere in bed and I meditate and I\nvisualize and I pray and it really works\nnow it doesn't transform your life in a\nday what does but small daily seemingly\ninsignificant improvements when done\nconsistently over time and that practice\nof\nmeditating on becoming less fearful\nvisualizing yourself as the person you\nwant to be maybe in a scenario maybe\nit's in a business maybe it's in a\npresentation maybe it's asking someone\nout maybe it's running a marathon or\njust getting to the gym seeing yourself\nwith your eyes closed while the world is\nasleep and just feeling at a cellular\nlevel and the colors visualization is\nincredibly powerful and then prayer it's\nso easy to forget this time honored\ntruth every prayer is\nheard and if you don't believe in God or\nyou don't believe in spirit then I'm\nsure you believe in your sub\nsubconscious and so prayer MVP is a very\npowerful tool second tool I call it the\npre-performance\nparagraph So what you're right about\ndeepens commitment what you're right\nabout sets a default about how you're\ngoing to be so writing a paragraph is\npart of your morning routine in your\nJournal about who you want to be in that\nday Brave strong\nresilient positive writing out in detail\njust a paragraph is a very very powerful\ntool and then third thing I could\ncontinue but the third thing is you\nbecome your conversations the sixth form\nof wealth in the wealth money can't buy\nand it's form of wealth is your\ncommunity you become your Social Circle\nit's like I don't know if you like good\nwine but great wine comes down to a\ngreat terroir the terar is the\nsurrounding the ecosystem the wind the\nsoil the sun Etc well as human beings we\nbecome our terroir and if we are around\ntoxic people if we are around people\nplaying victim if we are around people\nwho stand for low standard we are around\npeople who minimize the power of\npersonal growth we are around people who\nare\ntakers we will become the people we\nsurround ourselves with and we could get\ninto the science of mirror neurons which\ncause us to mimic our Social Circle we\ncould talk about emotional contagion\nwhich is the scientific phenomenon of us\nadopting the dominant emotions of the\npeople we are around so those would be\nthree things the third thing is really\nclean out your Social Circle get rid of\nthe toxic people I think it can change\nthe world or be around negative people\nyou can't do both yeah the last one's\nsuch a you know we know it to be an\nageold truth yet we struggle with it so\nmuch and I always wonder why that is and\nbefore I ask you that I wanted I wanted\nto share yeah I find that I found that\nwhenever\nI'm complaining about some in my circle\nI am in that process becoming more like\nthem like I remember years ago I was\ncomplaining about someone because they\nalways were complaining and I found\nmyself becoming the biggest complainer I\nknew because I was complaining about\nthis individual and so often we're\nbecoming like them not because we're\neven mirroring them we're becoming like\nthem because we're behaving like them\nsubconsciously without knowing why do we\nfind it so hard we've heard that million\ntimes why do we find it so hard to\nchange our Circle and to transform the\nTera around us like why do we struggle\nso badly even though we know that we are\nthe average of the people we spend time\nwith why is it that we're still stuck in\nthe same circles often it's because we\nlove\nthem and I would I would say reason\nseason lifetime some people come into\nour lives for a reason some there's that\nold idea which is some people come back\ninto your life to to see if we're still\nstupid so you some people come into our\nlives for\nreason some people come into our lives\nfor a\nseason and then some people come into\nour lives for a lifetime like I think of\nmy my partner L you know she's just that\nperson who gets me that person who you\nknow I could have 20,000 dinners with so\nI think we struggle because sometimes\nthese energy vampires Jay are are\nparents or our sisters or our best\nfriends and so we say well I love\nthem that's been my friend for 10 years\nor five years but I would\nsay you know if you're growing and\nyou're reading and you're doing all\nthese Mo modalities and you want to live\na TR your richest life and you want to\nmaterialize your gifts and talents and\nlive at your best and someone isn't\ngrowing and they're always questioning\nyou or you say here's a new idea a\nproject and they're just going that\nwould never work here are the reasons\nEtc then you really have to ask yourself\nif that person is is is good for you and\nhealthy for you and I would say if you\nlove them maybe it's a parent then love\nthem from afar or practice selective\nAssociation and see them once a month\nversus texting with them or chatting\nwith them on the phone every day I'd say\nthe second reason why we keep people who\nare not good for us or who are bringing\nus down in our life is the human being\ndoesn't like to change we just don't\nlike to change and so it's so much I\nwould put it to you this way I would say\nthe the discomfort of growth is always\nless dangerous than the illusion of\nsecurity and so I would say yes it's\ndifficult to let people\ngo and yet that is always less dangerous\nthan saying I'm going to allow these\npeople to stay in my life if they're\njust bringing me down it's it's such an\ninteresting thing because I often find\nalso that we're growing in our personal\ngrowth self-development\nJourneys we're often becoming less\ncompassionate in the beginning like\nthere's a immature arrogance that\ndevelops of I'm moving faster than these\npeople I'm better than these people I'm\nI'm I'm the one doing the self-work and\nthey're not doing it and even that\nmindset in itself is a sign that we've\ngot a lot more work to do because if\nwe're working so deeply on ourselves our\ncompassion should more likely expand and\nhopefully we'd have the ability to set\nbetter barriers and boundaries with\nthose individuals and develop the idea\nthat we can have a group of people that\nwe grow around and then you have a group\nof people that you have to give too\noften right like I think that's what our\nlife is made up of like life isn't just\nwe're not just surrounded by people that\nhelp us grow because we're obviously\ntaking from them as well and we don't\nwant to be in a position where we're\nonly giving we want to be able to grow\nso it's almost like we all have we have\ntwo sets of groups in our life at any\nreal given time would you agree with\nthat that or well I would just say trust\ntrust your joy I think Joy is a great\nGPS and so yeah I'm not in any way\nsuggesting be around people only who\nfuel you and who help you become you at\nyour best yeah I'm simply saying it's\nit's about what's healthy it's about\nyour joy it's about being around people\nwho you Vibe with who understand you who\nhave similar values who support you and\nand who encourage you so I think your\ncommunity is definitely a key\nan absolutely key form of wealth the\nfifth form of wealth is the fourth\nexcuse me is your craft and I think you\nknow it's very easy to fall into the\nTrap of thinking a job is a job and not\nrealizing that our work offers us an\nopportunity to get to know who we truly\nare you know there's a there's a chapter\nin there about do your project X you\nknow which is build your and I think the\nworld right now needs more magic in the\nworld\nand I think a lot of us what we do is we\ntry to push out a lot of content put out\na lot and I would rather do one\nMasterwork than a thousand mediocrities\nand I think you know seeing your craft\nas a chance to change the world is is is\na form of wealth what would you say to\npeople who go Robin you know what I just\nwant to check into my job clock my hours\nand come\nhome is that okay is there a better way\nto live what would you say to that I'd\nsay of course I mean the Great great\nthing about a human life is we all get\nto live in the way that we want to live\ni' I've never subscribed to the hustle\nand grind culture I think that rest is\nnot a luxury it's a\nnecessity I think we have to enjoy the\nfruits of our labor having said that I\nthink almost in the world right now hard\nwork has a bad\nreputation and and I just think that you\nknow seeing your work as Noble seeing\nyour work as a chance to pursue Mastery\nseeing your work as a chance to serve\nand delight and astonish is a great form\nit's a great form of Happiness if\nsomeone wants to say I just want to\nfinish at five and go home that's\nabsolutely fantastic I would humbly\nsuggest though they might be missing one\nof the greatest sources of joy and\nwell-being and inner peace if you look\nat people really happy people a lot of\nthem say I would never retire why would\nI retire it's it's my oxygen and for me\ngot a great family life and I I think I\nhave a good lifestyle and yet I just\nwhat I do if this is year 31 in the\nfield of leadership and personal\ndevelopment and the opportunity to\ncalibrate the craft I spent one year of\nmy life on this book I did 20 different\nmanuscripts probably 10,000 little\noptimizations every version and I really\nsuffered on this book and you know I I\nhave to I it was suffering it was hard I\nfelt like giving up I could have mailed\nit in the publisher would have said\nabsolutely fine but there's a whole\nseries of values here like my family\nname is on that cover I'm only as good\nas my last book I think you know pushing\nyourself to the jagged edges of your\npotential is how you grow and and you\nknow this but I really feel I have a\nsacred trust relationship with my\nreaders mhm and you set an intention\nbefore we started I set an intention\nhere too which is you know to to\ncelebrate you for all the good that you\ndo in the\nworld and to have this this studio full\nof\nlight and also I just did a little\nvisualization and prayer before I came\nover here for all the people around the\nmillions and millions of people who\nlisten to your\nshow and you know as you know these are\nreal human beings with hopes and dreams\nand fears and inse\nSecurities and and I thought about as\nmany of them as I possibly could some\nare at the top of the mountain some\npeople are struggling some people are in\nbad relationships some people are in the\nrelationship of their lifetime some\npeople are starting a new tech company\nsome people are multi-billionaires some\npeople are entertainers some people are\nathletes what am I offering I'm I'm\nsimply saying I think through our work\nwe have a chance to change lives\nI was in London recently and I got into\nthis taxi London black\ncab and the gentleman outside it was\nalmost like he was on guard doing Noble\nwork Jay his car was shining his tires\nwere polished I walked inside the\ncarpeting on the floor was perfect and\nas we went to heo I sort of tried to\ndeconstruct his winning formula and this\nis on this fifth form of wealth the it's\na fourth form of wealth seeing your work\nas your craft and he said well you know\nI take my job seriously it gives me so\nmuch pride I get to meet interesting\npeople and when we got to the airport he\ngoes look look what I do before every\nperson comes in here and he had this\nshampooer and he goes look and he turned\nit on and he started shampooing the\ncarpet and then he had like the Windex\nand and I'm just saying you know whether\nsomeone is a CEO or a billionaire or a\nfamous tycoon or a p maker or a yoga\nteacher or an astronaut work has\nincredible potential to help us build\nintimacy with our Mastery but also give\nus incredible fulfillment so it's a form\nof wealth you know what I love hearing\nthat because I had personal experience\nof it as well just last week so last\nweek was one of my my best friend's\nbirthday he was in town and so I took\nhim and a friend to\nDisneyland uh you know which is not a\ncouple of hours away for his birthday\nand\nit was amazing we were fortunate enough\nto you know have a have a a private\nguide like a a tour tour guide her name\nwas Lexi and I have not met\nsomeone this like just for a long time\nI'd not met someone who was like that\npassionate knowledgeable smart\ncharismatic about their work she knew\nevery\ndetail of history of the Walt Disney\npark right she knew everything she knew\nwhere Walt Disney had spent time she\nknew what year that ride was built she\nknew the little Easter eggs and the\nhidden stories about every single ride\nlike it was just spectacular to be\naround her and to learn from her and\nwhen you're talking about mastering your\ncraft I was so amazed at how you know 26\nyears old like fully mastered the craft\nof hospitality tour guide entertainment\nknowledge smarts and I said to her at\nthe end of the day because we were just\nso happy with the experience I said I\nsaid you're going to run that Park one\nday like you have that energy like\nyou're going to run that Park one day\nand she said you know she said to me\nafterwards she was like it's experiences\nlike this that give me joy for what I do\nand I was just thinking how special it\nwas to experience that I love what I do\nbut to feel that from someone it was it\nwas amazing so shout out to Lexi if\nyou're listening but uh it was it was\nsuch a beautiful experience and I think\nthat what's happened I feel Robin I know\nyou work in leadership you worked with\nso many organizations all across the\nworld world like I think for so long\nbecause culture perpetuates and Cascades\ndown because you've seen the person\nabove you not love what they do and not\nmaster their craft but do the job you\nthen do the job and don't master your\ncraft and then the person who's coming\nup Beneath You sees the same thing and\nthen we repeat that culture because we\nsee it being rewarded we don't see what\nyou just said you just gave this\nbeautiful example of you know it took\nyou a while to write this book you\nsuffered to this book it was it was hard\nwork to put it together and you said I'd\nrather create a Mastery than lots of\nmediocrities but we see mediocrity being\ncelebrated and rewarded and masterpieces\ngenerally are hard to find these days\nright because of the amount of\nconsumption and the amount of creation\nand so it almost feels that we have to\nbe able to break generational Cycles or\nbreak the generational curses or break\nmultigenerational\nculture how do we get the courage to do\nthat when we see everyone doing the\nopposite around us well I I think\nthere's a few things that come to mind\nand the first thing\nis you know I I love going to art\ngalleries me too and I am absolutely\ninspired I don't know if all your\nviewers can see but there's that almost\nlooks like a Basia behind me you know so\nI'm just I'm an aesthet that's a French\nword as you know for a lover of beauty\nand this is not expensive Beauty\nnecessarily\nI love the beautiful flower I love going\nto art galleries and seeing the work of\nthe Masters and I often I here in La the\nother day I went to a whole bunch of\nGalleries and I was around\nSable yes oh I love sa I was around for\nyou know and I I just love these amazing\nwhether it's a oh I went to Basia I\ndon't know if you've seen the Basia\ninan please please go and what I'm\noffering is don't do it don't do\nbeautiful work for the Applause the\nApplause will come as a\nbyproduct do beautiful do your most\nbeautiful work work hard on it calibrate\nit make it magic see your work work as\npart of a magic shop for what it\nintroduces you to within yourself and\neven if no one sees it I think about\nVincent\nvano one of the greatest artists of all\ntime he sold two\npaintings so he didn't do it for the\nmoney he didn't do it for the fame\nfortune and adoration he did it because\nhe had to do it and he did it because he\nwas an Explorer he was a magician it it\ndid something inside him that made him\nfeel very good I think about JD Salinger\none of my favorite books is catcher and\nthe Ry Jay he only wrote one book and\nthen he checked out into a Subterranean\nPassage in New Hampshire and he probably\nwrote I think was 30 other books but he\nnever published one of them so how do\nyou develop this kind of a philosophy\nwell you stop plugging into the cultural\nmajority and doing what everyone is\ndoing and you do you take a radical act\nand you start thinking for yourself and\nI think that's the power of the eight\nforms of wealth the book is based around\nit's a framework it's a Mount Everest\nfor the eight most important elements of\na life well- lived doesn't mean you're\ngoing to do them all in a day but every\nday you advance on growth on Wellness on\nfamily on Craft on money on community on\nadventure and on service and you start\nto think for yourself and I guess what\nI'm trying to say is you start to live\nyour own life versus your neighbor's\nlife and I think that's a a powerful way\nto live no one wants to get to our last\nday and say we lived like the tribe we\nlived like our neighbors\nI there's a an acronym in the book\ncalled penum The Five forces of penum\nparents environment Nation associations\nand media these five forces program us\nand here's what they do they cause us to\nforget who we truly are and so I think\nwe're born into genius and then we\nresign ourselves into ordinary and we\nbecome busy being busy and we're playing\nwith our phones and we're doing what\neveryone else is doing but deep inside\nwe have a voice voice of wisdom that\nsees the self-\nBetrayal and we're in pain because\npotential unexpressed turns to pain so\nwe're in pain but we don't know it and\nso that's why we medicate ourselves with\ntoo much phone too much digital too much\nwork too\nmuch scrolling too much gossiping\nbecause we don't like ourselves for sure\nwell said I mean one of the it's so\nfunny to say that one of the things I\nwork on with my clients that I work with\nprivately will uh I'll ask them\nto we've write a book for them which is\ncalled their book of values and it's a\nbook of values mindsets habits that they\npractice we design the cover we print\nthe book only one copy and they carry it\naround with them in their bag wherever\nthey go so wherever they go in the world\nthey can pull it out and whenever they\nforget all the self-work they've been\ndoing they can look back at a guide book\nfor themselves and I always tell them\nwe're only ever going to publish one of\nthese it doesn't get shown to your\nfamily it doesn't go to your friends\nit's not something you have to promote\nyou don't Market it it stays with them\nand I was inspired by it because I\nremember reading uh Benjamin Franklin's\nuh 13 virtues to me that was the idea of\nit is like how could you have a book\nthat you carried around that represented\nyou that held your identity that made\nyou like yourself because that's who you\nwere but you often had to remind\nyourself of who you were while you\ncaught in the penum uh you know the the\nFive Points you just mentioned now and\nand and I think that idea that and\nanyone can do that you don't have to be\nwell known to do that you don't have to\nbe successful to know that I know you\ntalk about the value of journaling like\nthat's what a journal is it's it's a\nspace where you carry around your heart\nuh if you see it that way right you\ncarry around your thoughts and you can\nre-edit and you know systemize your\nthoughts and make sense of them uh and\nand one of the things I've been hearing\nfrom a lot of\npeople recently is this thought of like\nrealizing they need to rewire their\nrelationship with money people have\neither been trained to believe that\nmoney is bad money is evil money doesn't\nbuy happiness money is the root of all\nevil money will make you lose\nfriends there's so many statements about\nmoney that have been programmed into our\npenum whether it was our parents whether\nit was media as you said you know all\nthe others that have programed\nus and all of a sudden you get to a\npoint in life where you realize well now\nI just have unhealthy beliefs about\nmoney so whether I have it or I don't I\ndon't have a healthy relationship how do\nyou start rewiring that I if I could\nbefore I answer that you talked about\nsomething that I think is so important\nyour the book you do with your clients\nyeah and I think that speaks to\nsomething that is so essential in the\nworld right now which is Solitude I\nthink genius loves isolation I think we\nare so in the world right now and\nthere's so much noise we can't hear the\nsignal and so I think spending some time\nevery day alone is so powerful whether\nit is in a journal whether it is on a\nnature walk whether it is one of the\nchapters in the in the craft section is\ngo ghost for a year take one year go to\nBali go to Vietnam go to medin go to\nStockholm leave your\nphone take the classic read them study\nthem learn MVP meditation visualization\nand prayer take long walks and get lost\ntalk to strangers find yourself and\nafter that year or six months or three\nmonths come back to the world\nreconnected with who you truly are so I\nthink being alone and going ghost is\nimportant so you talk about how do we\nrewire our relationship with money I\nthink the DNA of transformation is\nawareness so it's it's the process of\nfirst of all realizing that my money is\nsomething but it's not everything so our\nsociety says measure your success by\nyour net worth in many ways that's how\nSociety tells us to think we pedestal\nthe billionaire we don't put the\ngardener or the teacher or the\nfirefighter on the front cover of the\nmagazine so understanding that money is\nnot everything and it won't be the\nsource of your Jo like I've I I've met\nso many people have sold their companies\nI had I think one person in particular\nhe said we we had a liquidity event we\nwere waiting for the funds to wire into\nthe account my whole family was sitting\naround the table we watch the funds go\ninto the\naccount and he goes it went into the\naccount and I didn't feel any different\nand it's that Zen proverb wherever you\ngo there you are so realizing that trap\nnumber two realizing of course money's\nimportant gets you better way to journey\nthrough life and in some ways less\nstress you can do great things for your\nfamily you can help people in need you\ncan get things that that you like\nthere's nothing wrong with material\nobjects but not defining\nYourself by your art collection not\ndefining Yourself by your net worth\nbecause then that becomes just another\ndrug of choice so it's what I was saying\nearlier which is making money Prosperity\nis a wonderful thing I mean if you look\nat the universe there's no scarcity\nthere's flowers everywhere and there's\nclouds and there's there's so much the\nuniverse is abundant so there's nothing\nwrong with abundant forms of money I\ndon't think we need to make it bad at\nall but not being not using it and\nhaving it as our God to the point where\nactually we become so busy chasing money\nwe forget about the other seven forms of\nwealth we forget about our family forget\nabout our Wellness what's the point\nthere's there's one wisdom tradition\nthey say when we are young we would\nsacrifice our health for wealth and when\nwe get old and wise we would sacrifice\nall of our wealth for one day of good\nhealth so making money is not at all a\nbad thing but let's not sacrifice the\nother seven mountaintops that are\nimportant for a truly well-lived life\nyeah having a more expans\ndefinition is so required because we're\noften also only measuring our success in\nlife and happiness based on that one\nmetric I think that measurement piece is\nso interesting because I was saying to a\nfriend a couple of years ago he really\nslowed down from his work because he\nfell in love and he found love and he's\ngone on to get engaged to that\nindividual and at some point soon\nthey'll get married and he always felt\nthat that year was such a wasted year in\nhis life because he was looking at it\nthrough the lens of the business didn't\nprogress the you know my financial life\ndidn't progress and I I've said to him\nso many times I said that was one of the\nbest investments of your life because\nyou found love like you'll look back at\nthat year as the best year of your life\nof all time but if you're only measuring\nyour success and I was like you have no\nidea how that stability is going to\nimpact your career in the next few years\nyou could have been distracted looking\nfor love for the next 5 years and your\nwork would have been distracted here you\nare you found love in one year and now\nlook you you'll have that stability and\nit's so interesting what we measure\nmakes such a difference and I like that\nyou're giving us eight things to measure\nas opposed to one thing and then you\nstart to realize how rich you truly are\nbecause no eight are going to align\nevery year anyway these are eight\npriorities of of a truly great life and\nyou talk about that love story you know\nH how rich how wealthy are those are\nthose two people I even think about the\ntimes that we are dealing with\nheartbreak you know the times we are\ndealing with tragedy the ego says this\nis a waste of time the ego says I should\nbe\nproductive what's more productive than\nnavigating hard times and using the\npainful moments to introduce us to our\nstrengths using the difficulty to make\nus wiser to teach us forgiveness to help\nus learn the great human virtues of\npatience and understanding so I think\nit's our\nego that tells us oh we're wasting time\nif we're building love we're wasting\ntime if we're healing we're wasting time\nif we're going through a hard season on\nour journey but it's all Grist for the\nmill you know I think the person who\nexperiences the most wins and work is\nimportant but let's not confuse\nproductivity with busy\nand let's not confuse movement with\nprogress and I think a great human life\nhas many different seasons and many\ndifferent elements and maybe there's a\ntime for each of them absolutely you you\ntalk about knowing your scarcity scars\nthis one really resonated with me\nbecause I think we don't realize what a\nscarcity mindset we've built up over\ntime in all of these areas I don't\ndeserve love I manifest bad health\nI must be going to get sick I'm going to\nruin this and throw it all away like\nthese are repetitive thoughts in\npeople's minds in scarcity in each of\nthese areas that you break down as the\neight priorities somewhere deep inside\nof ourselves we believe we don't deserve\nCareer Success love success Wellness\nsuccess craft I could never be good\nenough to do that that's for special\npeople that's for the Kobe Bryant\nMichael Jordan that's not that's not for\nme like those people mastered their\ncraft so these scarcity scars that\nexist how do you even develop the idea\nthat your scarcity scar doesn't have to\nbe your reality forever so there's an\nidea that I share called recruit a dead\nboard of\ndirectors and recruiting a dead board of\ndirectors is about the power of\nmentors and all it takes is one\nconversation with an interesting person\nto revolutionize the way we see the\nworld and we talked about the penm\nprogramming the five forces in so many\nways we adopt the when we're little kids\nwe have these social cues and we watch\nand listen to how our parents see the\nworld and that's what parents do they\nteach us how the world works and for a\nlot of parents they teach us scarcity\nmoney doesn't grow on trees I had one\nclient his father repeated over and over\nand over again all rich people are liars\ncheats and thieves MH how many times do\nparents say uh that's a great idea you\nwant to be in the NBA or you want to be\na painter you want to be a bestselling\nauthor you want to be a billionaire be\nreasonable makes me think of George\nBernard Shai\nsaid the reasonable man adapts himself\nto the\nworld the unreasonable one persists in\nadopting the world to himself therefore\nall progress depends on the Unreasonable\nMan\nso what is recruiting a dead board of\ndirectors all about well it's like if\nyou can't have a mentor who's a\npossibilitarian and who mentors you and\nteaches you how to do it then find some\ndead people through their books that\ninfluence you and so how do we heal\nthese these scars well we realize that\ngenius is less about genetics and it's\nmore about your daily habits you know if\nyou look at the people we put on\npedestals the hey Mars The Great actors\nthe great athletes Aristotle oases\nNelson Mandela one of my greatest heroes\nin in my\nlife and you read their biographies\nthese people are all Cut From the Same\nCloth as as we are you know the the the\nstory of human greatness is all about\npeople from ordinary\ncircumstances wiring in new habits\ntaking risks get knock getting knocked\nout so much and being and being\nresilient so I think having a dead board\nI even think of Kobe you know you\nmentioned Kobe so he actually\nsaid you know I got in the NBA and I\nthought everyone would want to be best\nin the world and want to be iconic and\nhe said I realize a lot of people got in\nthe NBA and that was their badge of\nhonor they were good and they just\nstarted partying and they might do one\nworkout every day and he said I realize\nthat if I got up at 3:00 every morning\npracticed from 4:00 to 6:00 went home\nhad breakfast Etc went back did another\nworkout 11:00 to noon went home had some\nlunch recovered rested did another\nworkout went home had dinner and did a\nfourth workout to use his words after a\nperiod of four or five years I would\ndevelop an advantage so great that no\none would ever catch up so all I'm\nsaying is people whose lives we want to\nbe\nliving they're not cut from some magical\ncloth you know scarcity scars like the\nrichest people I mentioned Aristotle\nOnasis he started with\n$250 but they're just doing a series of\npractices and they're adopting different\nways of seeing the world and they're not\nplaying victim and giving away their\npower to external things and steadily\nthrough time they build the lives that\nwe now admire well said I the reason why\nthat resonates so strongly with me I've\nI've often said and I love your language\naround it I've often said that I've been\nmentored by people I've never met\nbecause I had the fortune of reading\nMartin Luther King when I was young\nreading Steve Jobs you know when Walter\nisacson wrote His Brilliant book on\nSteve Jobs\nreading uh Einstein you know it's just\nit's\namazing that we're so obsessed with what\npeople think of us as opposed to how\npeople lived and it's we think a mentor\nis about who can give me direct advice\nand we're so interested in advice\nas opposed to you can actually study the\naction that that dead board of directors\ndid in that scenario how did they deal\nwith stress how did they deal with\npressure how do they deal with failure\nhow did they deal with success like what\ndid they do like it's so great to have a\ndead board of directors I love that\nlanguage because you can actually study\nthe actions not just the advice and we\noften get so lost in advice that we miss\nout and realizing Its Behavior change\nits action it's its habit change as\nyou're saying that really makes the\nshifts in our life and you mentioned\nthis earlier I wanted to come back to it\nwas this three great friends rule and I\nlove that you talk about having three\ngreat friends I heard recently somewhere\nI can't remember I was I was browsing on\nsocial media and someone said you need\n300 a.m. friends as well like friends\nyou can call at 3:00 a.m. and they'll\npick up the phone how do you know what\nis the quality of a great long-term\nfriend what what is a great friend I'm\nnot sure we even know anymore a great\nfriend is someone you can be yourself\nwith and they still love\nyou great friend\nis I I had a line in the book you know\nyou're in a foreign country and 3:00\na.m. they hop on a plane and they come\nget\nyou a great friend is someone who you\ncan laugh with great friend is someone\nwho you're going through your most\ndifficult times and they'll listen to\nyou for hours a great friend is um yeah\nsomeone who who accepts you someone who\nhelps you be seen a great friend is\nsomeone who when you're with them you\nfeel joyful versus\ndepleted so I think it's really\nimportant you know in this world where\nwe are maximalists we want we want to be\nall things to all people we want to have\nso many different friends focus on three\ngreat friends we want to read a hundred\nbooks Master Three Books maybe it's\nJobs's isaacson's Autobiography on jobs\nlike you mentioned maybe it's the\nProphet by KH Jon maybe\nit's The Giving Tree by shell\nSilverstein maybe it's meditations of\nMarcus aurelus one of my favorite books\nof all time you know but I think just\nbeing a minimalist is is so powerful\nbuild your life around a few things even\nin work I mentioned it rather than\npushing out a thousand pieces of\nmediocrity do one thing incredibly well\nyou know even if it takes five years 10\nyears there's a chapter called make your\nProject X in the wealth money Camp by\nand the example is the duo in\nMilan you how long they spent on it in\nthis world where we want to do something\nin an hour and they get the Rewards or\nmaybe a week maybe a\nmonth it took 600 years to create the\nDomo that these are values of a unspoken\nage 600 years of calibrating refining\noptimizing to create the Domo and so\nthat's what a Project X is rather than\ndoing lots of things you do one thing\nmaybe it's one work of\nart Michelangelo took four years of\nworking on the Chapel of the cinee\nceiling but he got the job done so\nminimalism is is very very powerful m M\nand one of the things you said that this\nidea of we're almost trying to be so\nmany things to so many people that it's\nhard to find the right friends one of\nthe things you talk about is do not be a\ndoormat and I find that that becomes\nthat peop pleasing mentality that\nability to I can mold and I can be\nwhatever you want me to be and I can be\nlots of things and we feel validated\nthat way but in the end we're just\nbecoming ad dorat everyone crosses over\nad dorat and AD dmat welcomes everyone\nin the same way so when I read that I\nwas like how do we be kind but not be a\ndoormat how do we be service oriented\nbut not be a doormat how do we balance\nthat art of Being welcoming but not\nbeing a doormat well I you know for for\nmany years like you Jay I've talked\nabout the power of just being of being\nkind you know and it sounds so simple\nbut being kind staying in a hotel\nremembering there's someone going to\nclean my room after I leave the room\nso put the bath the towels in the\nbathtub straighten out the bed leave the\nroom service tray clean little acts of\nkindness not only are a gift you give to\nsomeone else it's a gift you give to\nyourself you respect yourself more so\nthen people come sometimes say to me\nwell if I'm kind people will take\nadvantage of me and I would say people\nwill only take advantage of you if you\nallow people to take advantage of you\nlet's not confuse kindness with weakness\nthere is a time to always be kind but\nthat doesn't mean you let people walk\nover you and that makes me think of\nanother idea that I write about which is\nthe importance of you know in this world\nright now it's so easy to live the same\nyear 80 times and call it a life and\nthere's one chapter called be a perfect\nmoment Creator and the story I tell him\nthere is of Eugene\nKelly o Kelly excuse me and eugo Kelly\nused to be the former CEO of KPMG the\naccounting Behemoth and one day he\nwalked into his doctor's office to get\nthe results of a routine medical and the\ndoctor came out with an expression you\nnever want to see on the face of your\ndoctor when you go to get your\nresults and he was told he had 90 days\nleft to live he had an inoperable brain\ntumor so confronted with his mortality\nhe realized for the first time he had\nnever in all his years as a corporate\nTitan he' never taken his wife to lunch\nhe had missed so many Christmas concerts\nof his daughter he had never spent time\nwith his friends walking through Central\nPark and having conversations and so he\ndecided to re-engineer his last 90 days\nand he said I wanted to become a perfect\nmoment Creator and he spent those last\n90 days he actually died roughly 90 days\nafter um the report from his doctor but\nI think that's so powerful you know when\nyou're with your family when you're with\nyour work when you're with yourself each\nand every day find some way to create a\nperfect moment maybe it's giving a gift\nto someone through a compliment maybe\nit's taking some time to do something\nthat fills you with joy but being a\nperfect moment Creator I think is a form\nof wealth money camp byy for sure uh\nRobin I have one last question for\nyou which I think is such a interesting\nchallenge for so many people right now\nyour rule is see anothers winning as\nyour Victory and I think we live in a\nworld right now where seeing other\npeople\nwinning is we take it as a reflection of\nour losing right we see others winning\nas a reflection of us being inadequate\nwe see someone winning as a feeling of\nwe're behind we see someone else winning\nas a feeling of there's not enough space\nit's too consumed it's there's there's\ntoo many podcasts in the world there's\ntoo many books in the world there's too\nmany Instagram Reals in the world like\nhow can I do anything like if that\nperson's winning then they've taken my\nspot we live in a world believing that\nthere's a finite number of seats in the\ntheater of happiness and in the theater\nof dreams and that there isn't a seat\nwith our name on it rather than seeing\nanother's Victory as our own how do we\ntrain ourselves to do that well this is\nsuch an absolutely important point and\nyou're right a lot of us look on one of\nthe social media feeds and we see\nsomeone and as we all know a lot of that\nisn't real so that's the first thing we\ndon't know the truth of how someone's\nreally living the second thing I would\nsay is you do want to train yourself to\nsee someone's Victory as an example of\npossibility and you want to train\nyourself and how do you do it MVP\nmeditation visualization and prayer\nprayer is very powerful you know or when\nyou're writing write about your\ninsecurities write about how you're\nfeeling when you see someone else\nwinning you know metabolize the feelings\nof inferiority by noticing them by\njournaling about them simply by sitting\nwith them processing through that's how\nyou move through as you know so well how\ndo you move through a feeling of\ninsecurity not enoughness you\nacknowledge it and you don't give away\nyour power you don't make excuses you\ndon't throw rocks at those people you go\nwhat is it about their winning that is\nbringing up my in not enoughness and you\nwork through that not enoughness through\njournaling through meditation through\nprayer through silence Through Stillness\nthrough nature walks and so I think if\nwe can train ourselves to say wow that\nperson is doing so well and applaud them\nand feel good for them and say if they\ncan do what I can do it I think we're\ngoing to be much more peaceful I would\nalso say about the podcast someone is\ngoing to launch a new podcast that is\ngoing to do incredibly well why not you\nsomeone is going to write that new\nbestseller tomorrow that is going to\ndominate the list why not you someone is\ngoing to launch that new business that's\ngoing to change the world why not you\nand then the last thing I'd say about is\nwe all know but this kind of a way of\nbeing where we see someone else's\nsuccess as something that brings out you\nknow like we have resentment for it\nis coming from a place of great scarcity\nand\nfear versus\ngenerosity and if we are stuck in\nscarcity then we're never going to bring\nour magic to the world we're operating I\nmean everything we do reflects who we\nare and if we're in scarcity and we're\nreally it's it's about jealousy and if\nwe're feeling jealous at someone else's\nVictory then it has nothing to do with\nthem we need to work through our\nfeelings of jealousy until we get to our\nnext level of Consciousness and ution I\nthink it's a great opportunity to see\nwhat other people success bring up for\nus Robin Sharma everyone the book is\ncalled the wealth money can't buy the\neight hidden habits to live your richest\nlife Robin I'm so grateful for your time\nyour energy for pouring into this book\nfor us picking some of my favorites\ntoday but like I said there is so much\nin this book to unpack please tag me
