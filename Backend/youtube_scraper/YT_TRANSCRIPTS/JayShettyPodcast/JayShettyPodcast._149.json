before we\njump into this episode I'd like to\ninvite you to join this community to\nhear more interviews that will help you\nbecome happier healthier and more healed\nall I want you to do is click on the\nSubscribe button I love your support\nit's incredible to see all your comments\nand we're just getting started I can't\nwait to go on this journey with you\nthank you so much for subscribing it\nmeans the world to me the number one\nHealth and Wellness podcast J shett J\nshett the one the only\nJett you talk about mentally strong kids\nlive by clearly defined goals and I was\nthinking about that I was thinking how\ndo you set a goal for a kid and at what\nage does a goal become real well the\ngoal starts with parents what kind of\nDad or Mom do I want to be and what kind\nof children do I want to raise so in\nraising mentally strong kids I mean the\nfirst principle is you need to be\nmentally strong right you have to model\nthe message and Amen Clinics our first\ncore value is\nauthenticity and and what what does that\nmean to be mentally strong well the\nfirst principle is Clarity is you want\nto know so when I was growing up my mom\nwas great she was present but there were\nway too many of us there were seven I'm\nthird means irrelevant uh at least\nthat's what I thought uh you know Prince\nHarry's book spare well in a Lebanese\nfamily the oldest son is golden and the\nsecond son's irrelevant now there's huge\nupside to irrelevance which means I\ncould do anything I want but my mom was\npresent and fun and playful and strict\nuh all good qualities my dad was gone\nand so when I'm thinking about what kind\nof parent do I want to be is I want to\nbe\npresent uh because that caused a lot of\nbitterness in my life and if you read\nsort of the latest Neuroscience on\nchildbearing attachment is so important\nto\nprevent mental illness or mental health\nproblems and so if I want to be present\nthen that leads to the second principle\nwhich is bonding which is connection and\nhow do you connect and too many parents\nget that wrong and like oh well let me\nsolve all of my child's problems which\ncreates entitlement and disaster but the\nfirst one is what do you want and I\nthink it's a great question for kids\nwhen they're six or seven what do you\nwant in our relationship like I treat a\nlot of difficult kids and one of my\nfavorite questions to parents how many\ntimes out of 10 when you ask this child\nto do something will they do it the\nfirst time without arguing or fighting\nand seven is the average for healthy\nkids so very few kids do something every\ntime right but for the kids who see me\nit's zero or less than\nthree and when I ask the children about\nthis 78 n I'm like is that your goal to\nmake your mother cry I'm like no I'm\nlike why do you do it I don't know and\nthe fact is they don't know because it's\nnot will driven it's braind driven and\nthat one concept all by itself on top of\nwhich if a child doesn't do what you ask\nthem to do and you ignore it or you just\nrepeat it what you're doing is teaching\nthem to do that and the brain is is lazy\nso um this is going to be a fun\nconversation how about the people that\nwould say that that may make children\nobedient but it doesn't make them free\nthinkers or it doesn't make them\nindependently thoughtful I think we\nsometimes feel like these two things\nwork against each other right like if we\nfeel we're like they listen to\neverything we say and they do what we\nsay then how do they build up their own\nsense of identity how how does that work\nwell that's totally in the book on how\nto do that and that is you do not solve\nall of your children's problems that's\nthe heart of love and logic it's you\nwant kids to make mistakes and you want\nthem to pay the consequences so they\nlearn agency it's such an important word\nin lives um so I have six children three\nof them are adopted and Chloe um who's\nnow 20 she's a bit of a Helen and uh\nargumentative\noppositional and I'm a child\npsychiatrist and Chloe was two when tan\nand I met and I'm like Tana you've done\nsecond grade but they would like go at\nit in a bad way for homework for like a\ncouple of hours and I'm like and then\nTana got a program uh I co-wrote the\nbook with Charles Fay who's president of\nthe love and logic Institute so she got\nparenting with love and logic and then\ntook everything they ever created one\nnight when it finally clicked that I've\ndone second\ngrade she told Chloe she'd never again\nask her to do her homework she said hey\nI've done second grade this is on you\nand if you're okay with the\nconsequences of not doing your homework\nMrs M her teacher will be mad at you you\nwon't go out to recess and if you really\ndecide you're not going to do it you'll\nmake new friends when you repeat second\ngrade that was that Epiphany moment\nChloe got upset and said I never said I\nwasn't going to do my homework I'm just\nnot going to do it now she stormed off\n20 minutes later she came back no one\never asked her to do her homework again\nshe's going to graduate with a business\ndegree from Chapman University\nshe's bright she's independent she has\nagency she's a hard worker and a free\nthinker because she couldn't push\nagainst her mother to solve her\nproblems she had to figure it out with\nof course appropriate support and oh by\nthe way to really push on this idea if\nKhloe forgot her homework there's no way\nher mother would bring it to school cuz\nthen she'd only forget it once right if\nshe forgot her homework and we brought\nit to school we'd always be bringing her\nhomework to school if it was cold out\nand she forgot to bring a sweater\nnobody's bringing a sweater she forgot\nher lunch nobody's bringing her lunch\nwe're teaching her probably the most\nimportant skill of mentally strong\npeople I'm responsible for my life and\nif there are consequences I'm going to\npay it and you so you want them to make\nmistakes when the consequence are\naffordable and what age is that at is\nthat at a particular age or is there a\ntime when like four five six you know\nearlier the better and of course you're\nalways putting you know think of bowling\nalley you're putting bumper guards up uh\nto protect them but when I was a young\nparent I think my self-esteem wasn't\ngreat and I would get self-esteem by\nsolving my children's problems and what\nI realized is I was robbing them of\ntheir self-esteem because where do we\nget self-esteem there's this great study\nout of Harvard where they followed\n454 inner city Boston school kids for 70\nyears I mean think about that I one of\nthe longest longevity studies ever done\nand they looked at what was going you\nknow with mental illness with addiction\nwith self-esteem and the only thing that\ncorrelated with self-esteem was whether\nor not you worked as a child whether or\nnot you had responsibility at home you\nhad a paper route you had an outside job\nwhen I was 10 years old I went to work\nbecause my dad owned grocery stores and\nwork is good but for people who are\naffluent who have help at home and\neverything is done for the child you're\nreally setting the child up for\nstruggles in their life because they\nwon't develop a sense of agency that's\nso interesting hearing that I've always\nfelt that I started doing I was a paper\nboy when I was 14 years old and I\nremember going around the local streets\nand delivering the papers and it was\nraining and it was you know at some time\nof the year in England it would snow\nduring the Christmas period and it was\nhardest because I'm pulling this like\nyou know this uh trolley we call it I\ndon't know what you'd call it here but\npulling this cart that has all the\nnewspaper stacked in it and then I\nworked in re and then I worked in a\ngrocery store and then I worked in\nretail and so I've been working ever\nsince I was 14 years old and I couldn't\nagree with you more I learned so many\ninteresting skills I developed so many\namazing habits because you had to in\norder to do it and that resonates so\nstrongly with me how do you get\ncomfortable watching your child be\nuncomfortable because I can imagine\nthat's the biggest challenge right as a\nparent who loves adors cares for the\nthis child doesn't want it to be cold\ndoesn't want the child to be late for\nschool doesn't want the child to perform\npoorly your ego is somewhat attached to\nthe child's ego and success level how do\nyou get comfortable watching your child\nbe uncomfortable in a\nnon unemotional way and not in a\ninsensitive way it's hard you have to\nhave the big picture in mind and the\nlong game in mind what do I want what\nkind of parent do I want to be effective\npresent what kind of child do I want to\nraise independent competent strong um if\nI do too much I'm robbing them of their\nself-esteem of their sense of\nresponsibility and agency and that's a\ndisaster you just don't want and you\nneed to see it ahead of time and that's\nwhy you know the first principes is know\nwhat you want and all always ask your\nkids so what's the goal for this year\nwhat do you want right it's not you're\nnot telling them they goal I mean an\nexample when I turned 18 it's the first\ntime I could vote and my dad told me if\nI voted for Senator McGovern the country\nwould go to hell so 1972 Richard Nixon\nis running for re-election he's a very\npopular president even though it'll turn\nout to be a disaster against senator my\ngovern and I'm 18 and I don't have a\nrelationship with my dad I mean we're\nsort of mostly mad at each other he's\ntrying to have influence on me but\nbecause we don't have a\nrelationship I'd just as soon piss him\noff right now it wasn't my conscious\nthought but I'd just as soon piss him\noff and I voted for mover and the\ncountry went to hell but it had nothing\nto do with McGovern it was all Nixon and\nWatergate and so on but it was that lack\nof\nrelationship and if people do what I\ntalk about in the book you have more\ninfluence with them and that leads to so\nthe first principle is goal setting the\nsecond one is bonding it's attachment if\nyou want to have influence with your\nchildren if you want them to seriously\nconsider your values you have to be\nconnected with them and what does that\ntake time like actual physical time\nwhere you're not on your phone but you\nput the phone away and you spend 20\nminutes a day with a child so there's an\nexercise I talk about in the book that I\nlove so much\nthat you know all the things I've\nrecommended to my patients over the last\n45 years when I decided to be a\npsychiatrist 45 years ago special time\nit's mad magic\nand 20 minutes a day do something with\nyour child child wants to do that's\nreasonable you can do in 20 minutes so\nit's like not take me to Nordstroms and\nduring that time no commands no\nquestions no directions it's just time\nto be together and it's money in the\nrelational bank and I remember when I\nfirst figured this out my literary agent\nuh had a child later in life we were\ntalking on the phone and he's like my\ndaughter Laura doesn't want to have\nanything to do with me and she's to and\nhe said that's like a girl thing right a\nmother daughter thing they don't want\nanything I'm like no Carl you're\nignoring her what what do you mean I'm\nignor I'm like you're ignoring her do\nthis and he said that won't work I'm\nlike oh great you represent an idiot my\nown literary age won't do what I say do\nit in fact I'm going to put you in my\nschedule for 3 weeks I'm going to call\nyou get the party\nstarted and so three weeks go by I call\nhim up\nCarl Daniel she won't leave me alone as\nsoon as I walk in the door she grabs my\nleg and wants her time all she wants to\ndo is be with\nme I'm like that's the problem that's\nwhat we won right that's what we're at\nafter so actual physical time and now\nparents are so busy they're not spending\nthis oneon-one alone time listening so\nthat's the second part of it so time\nactual physical time and shut up I it's\nso important so you you love them so\nmuch you want to pour all of your\nknowledge all of your wisdom that you\nworked your whole life on and down\nloaded into their head don't do that\nlisten to them and therapists learned\nthis technique called active listening\nthat whenever someone says something you\ndon't interrupt and tell them how to\nthink you repeat it back and you listen\nfor the feelings behind the words so if\nmy son came home and said Dad I want to\nhave blue hair I don't know what your\nfather would have said but I know what\nmine would have said no when as long as\nyou live in this house you can have blue\nair but what does that do it just stops\nthe conversation or it starts a fight\nactive listening teaches you repeat back\nwhat you hear oh you want to have blue\nhair and then be quiet long enough for\nthem to like explain what's really going\non and he might say all the kids are\nwearing their hair\nblue now I've been to a school I know\nnot everybody's blue-headed\nand if I would have said that to my dad\nI don't know what your dad would have\nsaid I don't care what anybody else is\ndoing as long as you live in this house\nyou're not going to have blue hair if\nthey're going to jump off a bridge are\nyou going with them that one for sure\nI've heard that plenty of times and what\ndoes it do stops the conversation or it\nstarts a fight sounds like you want to\nbe like the other kids completely\ndifferent conversation but that's and he\nmight say dad you know sometimes I feel\nlike I don't fit in now my mother would\nhave said what do you mean you don't fit\nin of course you fit in you're a good\nboy you're a good-looking boy you're\nnice\nboy and that's not helpful either what's\njust helpful is so sometimes you feel\nlike you don't fit him and then give it\na breath so they're the ones solving\ntheir problem now at the end of a half\nan hour he says I still want to have\nblue hair I'm going to tell him no way\nin hell as long as you live in my house\nbecause it's not cool to look weird I\nmean if you look weird you're going to\nhang out with weird people right it's\nokay to have\nboundaries around Behavior some parents\nthey have like no boundaries and I think\nsome boundaries are appropriate what\ndoes No Boundaries lead to like from a\nneuroscience and from a study\nperspective of what is what happens if\nit leads to mental health problems so\nthere's um this great study out of the\nUniversity of Oregon we looked at 10,000\nfamilies and they looked at parenting\nalong two Dimensions parents who were um\nfirm versus\npermissive and then hostile versus\nloving and if you take those two\nDimensions you end up with four types of\nparents uh permissive and hostile\npermissive and firm\nloving and permissive loving and firm\nand they looked at what were the\nconsequences or the outcome of each\nparenting style do you have a sense what\nwould be worse what would be the worst\none that creates the most trouble you\nwould think that it's hostile and\npermissive hostile and permissive the\nworst what do you think is the second\nworst loving and permissive loving and\npermissive shocking wow because children\nneed boundaries and the loving and\npermissive ones had more mental health\nchallenges than the Hostile and firm now\nthat's not helpful right that creates\nanxiety but children need boundaries I\noften say God gave us parents until our\nfrontal loes develop right the front\nthird of the brain the most human part\nof the brain Focus For Thought judgment\nimpulse control and that's why you need\nparents to help guide you and the one of\nthe big mistakes we make as a society is\nwe abdicate parenting before their\nfrontal loes are developed so I'm like\nnot a big fan of sending children away\nto college because you're going to take\ntheir undeveloped prefrontal cortex and\nput them in a dorm with a whole bunch of\nother undeveloped prefrontal courtesies\nbad idea and you know I'd learned this\nas a child psychiatrist send kids away\nto school the incident anxiety goes up\ndepression goes up suicide goes up\naddiction goes up and uh it's not a good\nthing how were you able to go get around\nthat with your kids going to college as\nwell well I mean one of my daughters\nwanted to go to the University of\nVirginia always across the other I'm\nlike no you have to go to somewhere I\ncan drive to see you in three hours wow\nwow so yeah that's it's really\ninteresting this limits and rules\nbuilding mental fortitude that you talk\nabout\nbecause it's it's hard to know I think\nas a parent and it comes back to the\nearlier point that you were saying that\nwe're just dealing with so much\nourselves like people are busy they're\nstressed they are on their phone just\ntrying to decompress after a long day\nand what I liked about what you said was\n20 minutes of no questions no commands\nand no\ndirections that I think is really\npowerful and a special takeaway for\npeople because it may be really hard to\ngive quality time but I love the\ndefinition of quality time becoming no\ndirections no commands and no questions\nbecause it seems like that's what our\nrelationship becomes about with children\nand what do all of those do if your\nrelationship is just giving the kids\ncommands directions questions what ends\nup happening to the relationship they\nshut\ndown and if you're just in their space\nand and you know as a child\npsychiatrist you know I've seen\nthousands of children over the years and\noften parents go he won't talk to you he\ndoesn't want to be here he won't talk to\nyou I go yeah it's really hard to be me\nand I just sit there and I'll play games\nwith them but while I'm playing a game\nwith them in a game they choose they\nchat you know they talk about what's\ngoing on in their dreams what goes on at\nhome what goes on what game would you\nplay with them I mean we'll play cards\nwe'll play Shoots and Ladders we'll play\nMonopoly we'll play all sorts of\ndifferent games um and one of my\nfavorite games is the storytelling game\nwhere I'll they'll start a story and\nI'll they'll have a sentence all of a\nsentence all of a sentence and you\nreally get to see how their minds work\nwhy does that work why is that a great\ninteraction point that allows them to\nopen up because kids if you just say\ntell me your problem they'll have no\nidea and they'll freeze if you play a\ngame with them or you go for a walk with\nthem then they begin to open up if they\nknow you'll listen and we just we're in\na society that's talking over each other\nparents are anxious and they want to\nsolve things and they talk too much so\nif I can get people to use less words\nand be more present it's gold for them\nhow do you know if a child is becoming\nmore mentally strong or more mentally\nweak as you're practicing some of these\nmethods what do you notice what are the\nhabits or the core traits of a mentally\nstrong child and a mentally weak child\nso mentally strong kids don't believe\neverything they think this is so\nimportant before in other episodes we've\ntalked about killing the ants the\nautomatic negative thoughts actually I\nhave a child's book called Captain snout\nand the superpower questions where I\nwrote specifically to teach kids to\nquestion their automatic thoughts and so\na vulnerable child so maybe wouldn't say\nmentally weak we just say vulnerable is\nyou notice they have stinking thinking\nthat they mind read they fortune tell\nthey focus on what's wrong rather than\non what's right a strong child still\nhave those thoughts but they'll question\nthem they just won't attach\nto um what I call the different kinds of\nants and blame is like the worst ant you\nknow it's you blame other people for\nyour life you become a victim and you\nbecome powerless what is it I can do\ntoday to solve this problem and that's\nthe essence of the book along with love\nand logic what is it I can do today to\nsolve this problem yeah obviously none\nof us are perfect and I think every\nparent is already judging themselves in\nhow they are a parent I think a lot of\npeople carry that weight around and they\ncarry that stress around of I'm not a\ngood parent I wish I could have handled\nthat better I shouldn't have said that I\nshould have said that what's a healthy\nway to repair a mistake you've made\nmaybe you've said something you wish you\ndidn't say you did something you\nshouldn't have done and you've done it a\nfew times what's a healthy way to repair\nthat Bond well there's a guilt cycle\nthat people get into they\noverreact and then they feel bad about\nit so they don't react and they let bad\nbehavior go and they let it go and they\nlet it go and then they can't stand it\nand then they explode and then they feel\nguilty and so they don't react and they\ndon't react and then they don't react\nand then they overreact and so the trick\nis when their's Behavior you don't like\ndeal with it as opposed to let it go\nit's like deal with it in the moment and\nyou're going to make mistakes Lord knows\nI've made lots of mistakes but every day\nI win or I learn right I'm working with\nan Olympic athlete that I just love so\nmuch Alicia Newman she's a Canadian uh\nrecord holder for pole vating\nand um she's such a mess when I saw her\nshe did my show scam my brain and now\nshe's so mentally strong because every\ntournament she wins or she learns and as\na parent that's the mindset is you know\nwe had a really great day and when you\ndon't have a great day why didn't we\nhave a great day and you think about it\nin the book there's all sorts of brain\nreasons why you didn't have a great day\nyou didn't sleep you went too long\nwithout food um there's the time change\nyou know that has more bad days just\nbecause you know as a society we become\njetlagged all at once so if you can just\nbe\ncurious rather than being Furious it\nhelps you so much so if we have a really\ngreat day it's like okay why' that\nhappen and just be thought\nand the default is always firm and kind\nand the softer your voice the more they\npay attention to it if you're screaming\nthey tune you out and they get\nmad it's so interesting as I'm listening\nto you I'm thinking as you gave in the\nexample of the Olympic\nAthlete we need this for oursel right\nnow at this age because our child self\ndidn't probably get this kind of\nparenting or wasn't exposed to this and\nso even that statement you just said\nthat I either win or I learn I think\nthat's a habit that any of us listening\nto this right now need to develop\nbecause I think just as we're harsher on\nchildren or harsher on someone else it's\ncomes from a fact that we're harsh on\nourselves like there's this inner critic\nand this inner voice that breathes\nnegativity and as you said the guilt\ncycle that continues it seems that that\nthen becomes the externalized version is\nhow we treat the kids and then again we\nfeel guilty for doing that because we\nknow it's wrong when you're trying to\nbecome mentally strong yourself but you\nfeel like you don't have time your kids\nneed dinner cooked you need to do their\nhomework with them like I feel like\nthere's a massive loss of time balance\nthe ability to cater to this what do\npeople do when they're like Jay I'm just\nsurviving like I'm just putting food on\nthe table we just about even surviving\nfor myself to be able to switch on the\nTV in the evening after the kids were\nasleep like I get no time for myself how\ndo we balance that time that's why\nspecial time is not two hours with the\nchild it's doable you're playing the\nlong game and too often parents love\ntheir children so much it's we're going\nto do soccer and we're going to do dance\nand we're going to do music and we're\ngonna and it's like stop that you need\ntime to spend with each other and you're\nlike well but I have to do my homework\nwith the children it's like please don't\nthat's not what this want you to do they\nwant the children to do the homework and\nif they don't do it let the kids pay the\nconsequences but then what parents do is\nthey get into this fortune telling thing\nit's like well then they won't get into\nthe best preschool and they won't get\ninto the best school and they won't go\nto Harvard and their life will be\nterrible and like I went to a junior\ncollege a community college I'm actually\nin the Hall of Fame at Orange Co college\nand I actually think many people Mark\ncubin actually said that it's like most\npeople should go to a community college\nbecause it's such a low cost and it's\nthe same education right but people have\nthis idea of prestige is attached to\nmyself esteem and it's and Prestige is a\nFrench word comes from a French word for\ndeceit right that I mean I went to a\ncommunity college my life is\nawesome because I work hard right and\nultimately another point you never want\nto tell a child they're smart I mean\nparents get so proud you're so smart\ndon't ever do that go you work hard\nbecause if you tell them they're smart\nand they can't learn something their\nself-esteem drops if you go I really\nlike how hard you're working and they\ncome up with something hard they work\nharder and you also teach kids cuz\nmentally strong people ask questions and\ntoo often it's like no I want to ask\nquestions I don't want to appear dumb\nit's like mentally strong people to ask\nquestions and so when I was in\nelementary school I'd never ask a\nquestion and then I realized because I\nwas in the Army and I took three years\nbetween high school and college and I\nwas able to grow up and I'm like oh you\nhave to ask questions right I learned\nthat in the Army if you ask a question\nand somebody says no ask somebody else\nbecause they're more likely to say yes\nright so I learned that I don't just\naccept no but in school it's like oh let\nme ask questions if I don't understand\nsomething odds are people don't\nunderstand those well what are some of\nthose other statements that parents say\nto kids that they think they're saying\nthe right thing but they end up\nbackfiring because they make it harder\nfor the child to live up to that what\nare some of those other statements it'll\nbe okay like or I'll take care of it for\nyou if they're having problems with\nanother child at school they immediately\nin the principal's office they're not\nlistening to the child and going so how\ndo you think you can handle that or what\ndid they go and they fix it and that's\ndeath to their self-esteem now of course\nif it's dangerous or bullying or abuse\nyou have to step in and take care of it\nbut for the day-to-day stuff how do you\nthink you can solve this as opposed to\nwell I had that problem when you were\nwhen I was your age and this is what I\ndid and this is what you should do don't\ndo that\nbecause it steals their self-esteem it\nsteals their agency what is it you can\ndo I'm rooting for you rather than boy\nthat's a dumb decision yeah yeah wow no\nI'm rooting for I mean that's so huge in\nour friendships it's so huge in marriage\nit's it's huge with kids I think it's so\neasy to just say this is what I did this\nis what you should do this is the right\nway to do it this is easy and we think\nwe're basically doing a shortcut because\nwe're not listening we're not actually\nbonding we're not connecting and we're\ntrying to jump to a conclusion that\nhopefully we think solves the issue and\na lot of this comes back to what we've\nboth mentioned in this conversation is\nthat there's this\nsubconscious ego attachment to the child\nsucceeding is being a reflection of our\nself-esteem our self-worth our\nselfesteem gets wrapped up in our\nchild's self-worth and self-esteem and\nnow you know subconsciously we're living\nour dreams through them that's not as\nbasic as saying I want my kid to be a\ndoctor because I am but there there's\nother more subtle versions of that how\ndo people disconnect from that ego\nbecause it seems to be so subtle and so\nhidden but it's there and I think\neveryone notices it with their parents\nwhen their parents are acting in that\nway but almost when we become parents we\nwe're completely oblivious to that\nego and it's so important it's often so\ntoxic if someone is living an unrealized\nlife that they pour a lot of it into\ntheir child and it makes these kids\nmiserable and it doesn't give them a\nsense of agency it\nconstrains them um and they often rebel\nagainst it as opposed to what do you\nwant to do it'll make you a good living\nso I don't have to support\nyou\nand I love my six children but I never\nwant to have to live with them right so\nI want to\ncreate competent people who can care for\nthemselves it's like oh go Live Your\nDream whether or not you can take care\nof yourself and that's going to set them\nup to be miserable if you're dependent\non someone else uh you're miserable\nentitled people are never happy um\nanother thing is and uh I posted this on\nTik Tok and it got like 7 million views\num Hallmark of mental strength um I\ndon't do things for people who do not\ntreat me with\nrespect whoa so you know your child\nmisbehaves you love them so much it\ndoesn't matter you you know give them\neverything they want anyways\ndeath I don't do nice things for people\nwho I feel don't treat me with\nrespect it doesn't mean you don't feed\nthem of course you feed them but you're\nnot taking them to the store and you're\nnot doing nice things for them I mean\nyou need to teach them their\nconsequences so the third part so it's\ngoal setting\nbonding so much there and so many mental\nillnesses are a attached to attachments\nthat become broken could you walk us\nthrough those so uh John bul is sort of\nthe famous attachment uh psychologist\nand he said that if we're not connected\nto our moms or dads um it puts us at\nGreat risk for mental health problems\nand he's absolutely right and often the\nbreak in the bond between your mother or\nyour father or it can be any primary\ncaretaker caretaker creates this rage\ninside of you and then you feel guilt\nabout the\nrage and so you attack yourself and you\nknow many people who live with this\nnegative chatter in their head and it's\noften that specific\nDynamic that they furious at their\nmother their father you know perhaps a\ndivorce happened when they were four or\nfive or they had a sibling die when they\nwere for something happen they get\nreally angry but that's not appropriate\nbecause these are the people that feed\nme so rage guilt about the rage and then\nself attack and they live with that\ntheir whole lives I can't tell you the\nnumber of people um and when you're four\nor five or six\nyou think of yourself at the center of\nthe world and so if something good\nhappens you sort of think it's because\nof you if something bad happens you\nthink it's because of you and you end up\nwith this chronic sense of being\nbad and uh there's a specific type of\ntherapy I like it's called intensive\nshort-term Dynamic\nPsychotherapy and it's often getting\nto the feelings underneath and rage and\nattachment and guilt about the rage are\noften the significant piece of it\nsometimes it's hard because I feel like\na lot of\npeople may be feeling like you\nknow I don't understand my child like\nthey're angry they're upset they you\nknow they they kind of want to\ndisconnect what do you do in that\nsituation where do you start well I\nthink you first start with the simple\nthings\ntime and look at what they're eating cuz\nthat matters um I have one patient who\nwould go in a rage whenever he got red\ndye\nand people go red dye yeah red dye\nnumber 40 um and so like every sweet in\ncandy think of Red Vines yeah and it's\neven in cough syrup for children or hard\ncandies red dye number 40 and he would\ngo in a rage and when they would take\naway red die he'd be fine but sometimes\nhe' get it accidentally and he'd rage\nand so I actually scanned him you know\nthat's what I do I look at people's\nbrains and so we scanned him no red dye\nfor a month and his brain was healthy we\ngave him Red Vines that have red D\nnumber 40 in it and his brain went\nlike it\nexploded that dramatic hyperactivity in\nhis brain and\nso if you're really struggling with your\nchild and you use the principles Dr Fay\nand I talk about in this book and you're\nstill struggling is probably a good idea\nto get him assessed and on average it's\nyears between the time a child first has\na symptom anxiety depression OCD\nadd between they have a symptom and they\nget assessed and so many bright people\ngo I never give my kids drugs and it's\nlike if he's diabetic you give them\ndrugs if if he had heart disease you\ngive them drugs it's like and I'm not\nadvocating drugs right I mean I own a\nsupplement company um but I'm not\nopposed if I do the all the things I\nknow how to do then I use medicine to do\nit people like don't really see the\nbrain as an organ right they have to get\nthe progression your brain physical\nfunction of your brain creates your mind\nand if your brain's not right your\nmind's not right and so what are all the\nways\nthat a mind can be trouble right so if\nyou have a child that's not sleeping\nthat has nightmares that has Tantrums\nthat won't go away they don't socially\nconnect they're obsessive it's like at\nsome point you have to go what's going\non in their brain and there's a whole\nsection in the book on brain health for\nkids of course you got to model it as as\na parent but what you feed them matters\nhow much sleep they get matters I have\nanother really fun book called time for\nbed sleepy head which is a hypnotic\nbedtime story for children I actually\nused to do it with my daughter Brienne\nwhen she was three I did it from three\nuntil eight she loved the story so much\num and think of your kids in four big\ncircles they have a biology so we talked\nabout their brain they have a psychology\nhow they think they have a Social Circle\nwhat their environment like and there's\na spirit ual Circle which most child\nChrist wouldn't touch but it's sort of\nlike why do you care you know why do you\nthink you're on the planet what's your\nsense of meaning and purpose because\npurposeful people are happier purposeful\npeople I mean what am I on on purpose\nright they they live longer and so\nnurturing those four circles so\nimportant for the kids what does what\ndoes loving discipline look like because\nI think it's it sounds good like we're\nall like yeah I would I would love to be\ndisciplined but I'd love to be loving\nand often we don't even figure out what\nthat means in the workplace let alone\nwith kids we're either loving or\ndisciplined but we're not I think it\nshould be both what does it look like\nwell you know we haven't gotten to rules\nI I think families should have them\nSociety has\nrules like tell the truth uh do what Mom\nand Dad say the first time I love that\nrule uh because do you know your chance\nof abusing the child if you tell a child\nto do something five times your chance\nof abusing that child just went up\nsignificantly and so if you have the\nexpectation they'll do things the first\ntime it's like Caitlyn take you know I\nwant you to take out the trash like in\nthe next half hour and if she doesn't\nit's like sweetheart you have a choice\nyou can take it out now or you can have\nthis consequence and then you can take\nit out I don't care it's up to you and I\nlove that part of not being attached to\nit I love her I'm really clear and she's\ngetting that consequence if she doesn't\nmove like um stop threatening them and\nthen not following through uh because\nyou teach\nthem that you have to tell them and get\nangry and be a bit crazy in order for\nthem to do what you ask them to do and I\nI I like the rules and rhythms and\nroutines I remember in my home after\ndinner me and my sister would clean up\nand we had a little rotor of who washed\nup that day and who clean the table that\nday and it was just something that went\naround every day we take it in turns and\nmy sister was four years younger than me\nand we' just do it together and it\nbecame this thing that we just did and\nit became natural became a habit and it\nmade us accountable and responsible to\neach other as well as well as our\nparents and it was a really neat way of\nkind of giving us that rules and you\nknow I think sometimes we think of rules\nas like like strict rules and guidelines\nbut actually it can be just a rhythm and\na routine in and it's building\nconfidence and skill and you're part of\nthe family rather than you're\nentitled to live in that family yeah\nyeah and the earlier you start the the\nbetter it is um for kids I mean it's\nit's hard if you not spend any time with\nchildren by the time they're 14 their\nfriends are more important than you are\nand that's the heartbreaking thing I've\nlearned is if you're not spending time\nwith them their friends will take your\nplace and they may not have the advice\nthey may not have the right ear for you\nand it makes them more vulnerable to all\nthe scary stuff that's on social media\nwell I was going to ask you about that I\nthink a lot of challenges that parents\nhave today are my child is addicted Ed\nto social media they're addicted to\ntheir phone forget spending time with\nthem I can't even get them to look up\nand make I contact what have you seen\nwhat have you experienced there's a\nwhole section on technology yes is you\ncan have technology and I recommend you\ndelay it as long as humanly possible\nbecause it's not in their best interest\nbut you can have technology as long as\nit's not creating a problem in the\nfamily and if we're not connecting\nthat's a problem in the family if you're\nat dinner um now you can't be on your\nphone all dinner and tell your child\nthey can't be on theirs right so\nprobably everybody should put their\nphones away so you can connect right\nmodeling mentally strong parents\nultimately raise mentally strong kids\nbut the problem with social media and\nyou're on social media I'm on social\nmedia\nit creates this toxic level of\nself-absorption\nyou know who's looking at me who am I\nlooking at who's following me um and\nself-absorbed people are\nnever never happy but that's become such\na challenge now right that it's it's the\nthing everyone's addicted to it's the\nthing everyone wants it's like you said\nparents are on their phones they're not\ngoing to stop straight away what do you\nsee being the Silver Lining or the light\nat the end of a tunnel that's going to\nhave that breakthrough with a child like\nwhat what do you think that would\nbe well you know I'd go back to delay it\nas long as you can even you know if the\nchild's like everybody's doing it CU\neverybody's not doing it but it's it's\nlike I love you so much I'm going to\nprotect you all the studies all of them\nsay that it makes kids more vulnerable\nto bad things um\nand then what's it doing to our brain\nwhat's social media doing to our brain\nwell addicting\nthat um there's a a book I love called\nthrilled to death uh it's continually\npressing on your nucleus accumbens that\nproduces dopamine continually pressing\non the pleasure centers in your brain\nbut the problem with that is the more\nyou press on them they begin to become\nnumb and you need more and more\nexcitement more and more stimulation in\norder to feel anything at all and you\nknow I see it with the wonderful famous\npeople I've been blessed to see I see it\nin kids who are addict I mean they're\nactually\nprograms sent and I've sent a number of\nkids away to video game internet\naddiction program M and when they get\naway from it they become sweet again I\nhad one kid who parents took away video\ngames he broke up all the furniture in\nhis room and I'm like needs program well\nwe decided to do take away all the\ngadgets good and I scanned him a month\nlater and then I scanned him while he\nwas playing one of the violin video\ngames he was addicted to and it\ndeactivated his frontal loes and his\nleft temporal lobe which is an area\nthat's often involved in violence like\nit's not a good\nthing what what about parents that are\nyou know parents that are going through\na divorce going through a difficult\ntime what's the healthiest way to\ncommunicate that to to a child I know I\nknow couples that are staying together\nfor the children they don't want to get\ndivorced even though they don't have a\nhealthy relationship I know others who\nare had the divorce but they're so\nscared about how that imp imps the child\nwhat have you seen through the\nneuroscience and research around when\nyou're staying together or breaking so\nit's not good divorce is not good for\nthe child but staying in a chronically\nunhappy\nconflicted negative relationship is\nworse so neither is good I often say to\nthe people I see the best thing you can\ndo for your child is love your spouse\nthe best thing you can do model a\nhealthy relationship but you know\nthere's no education in school on how to\nhave a healthy relationship right so\nthere should be that would be\nhelpful um when you go through a divorce\nbe really careful not to talk bad about\nthe other person because that child is\nhalf you and half them if you're talking\nbad about their mother they feel bad\nabout themselves plus it increases\ncortisol in their body and makes them\nmuch more likely to be sick so bad thing\noften if you're going to get divorced go\nto counseling together and figure out\nhow we are going to parent together\nraising mentally strong kids is great\nit's like we're going to parent this way\nyou know we have goals we have time\ntogether we have rules one thing we\ndidn't talk about yet is notice what you\nlike more than what you don't right\nthere's all my whole penguin story is in\nthere which I think I probably told here\nbefore but I'd love that notice what you\nlike every day you're shaping your child\nby what you notice you're shaping your\npartner you're shaping your employees\nyou're shaping Everybody by what you pay\nattention to and so notice what you like\nmore than what you don't and that really\nsolidifies The Kind part of effective\nparenting I've also been thinking a lot\nabout I was sharing with some families\nover last week when I was doing some\nevents this idea around how mindfulness\nand meditation can look very different\nfor children and so I don't think all\nkids need to be forced to sit in one\nplace and close their eyes I also think\nthat mindfulness can be an activity of\nhey when you're outside today see if you\ncan find as many red things as possible\nlike when you go out door today come\nback and give me a list of things that\nyou found that were red or can you find\nas many leaves that look like stars or\nany stones that look like stars today\nwhen you're out and about and I think\nmindfulness can actually become alive\nwhen we're actually living it and\nbreathing it when they're out and about\nas opposed to this feeling of kids need\nto learn it in a certain way what have\nyou seen with well and they don't sit\nwell yes yes exactly that's my it\ndoesn't mean they have ADHD May mean\ntheir nervous system isn't fully\nmelinated right it's not fully\nmyelinated for people that don't know\nwhat that means when you're born you\nactually don't have much myin in your\nbrain um as we develop our neurons get\nwrapped with a white fatty substance\ncalled myelin and a myelinated neuron\nWorks 10 to 100 times faster than an\nunmated one and our when we're 2 months\nold our occipital opes in the back\nVision become melinated and so when you\nlook at a baby and smile they smile back\nthey don't do it as newborns because\ntheir visual cortex isn't working fast\nand then slowly myelination goes from\nthe back and comes to the front when\nfinishes about when we're 25 and so\nexpecting the child to act like an adult\nbad bad bad but you can teach them self\nsoothing techniques from the age of four\nI think take a big\nbreath really slow slow as you can\nbreathe it out as slow as you can and\nthat'll Cal when they get anxious so you\nknow yeah what I'm hearing from you\ntoday is that it's really helping them\ndevelop the tools that they're going to\nneed long term the challenge is we need\nto know what those tools are ourselves\ndo them for our do them for ourselves\nbelieve in them because otherwise we\nlike you said we rush to solve their\nproblems we try and make up for their\nlosses they never get to become\nindependent resilient\nindividuals and talk to us about where\nlove fits into all of this like what\ndoes love look like with your child\nBeyond Time and Beyond certain things\nyou've said today what does love really\nlook like what does love mean because I\nthink when you think about what parents\nultimately want they want to be loving\nparents that's what everyone wants to\nthey want to love their child but love\novercomes as overcompensating love often\ntranslates as overs solving over fixing\noverdoing and overwhelming and forcing\nthem to be overachievers and so even\nthough we love them we end up doing all\nthese things that cause them pain so\nlove is when you want to bring their\nhomework to school it's not because you\nlove them and you want the best for them\nwhich is becoming mentally strong that's\nlove love is putting away your phone and\nspending time with them love is when\nthey go and when they're 10 and go all\nmy friends have a phone what if a school\nshooter comes and I can't get a hold of\nyou children are manipulative quite\nfrankly all of us are manipulative and\nit's like you know they're just too many\nrisks with that that's love\nit's setting bound boundaries in a kind\nconsistent way and ultimately Love Is\nYou developing these tools so you can be\nfirm and kind at the same time beautiful\nDr Daniel aan everyone the book is\ncalled raising mentally strong kids how\nto combine the power of Neuroscience\nwith love and logic to grow confident\nkind responsible and resilient children\nand young adults if you don't have a\ncopy already go and grab yours right now\nDr D what a gift to talk to you again\nabout this subject uh like we've said\nyou've had come on many many times first\ntime that we've really Doven into kids\nand raising them uh and I'm so grateful\nthat you put this book together for\neveryone else to read and share and I\nhope that parents will develop book\nclubs around it communities around it\nbecause I think this\nconversation of\nraising mentally strong kids needs to be\nat the center of our schools our homes\nour families because it's going to set\nthem up and set our society and World up\nfor so much success so thank you so much\nfor doing this honestly thank you my\nfriend thank you if you love this\nepisode you'll love my interview with Dr\ngabo mate on understanding your trauma\nand how to heal emotional wounds to\nstart moving on from the past everything\nin nature grows only where it's\nvulnerable so a tree doesn't grow where\nit's hard and thick does it it goes\nwhere it's soft and green and vulnerable"
