    "transcript": "researchers looked at a meal and they\nfound that if participants ate the\nelements of that meal in a specific\norder they could reduce the glucose\nSpike of the meal by up to\n75% huge that's huge without changing\nwhat they're eating overall just by\nchanging the order so the research is\nfantastic it turns out that when you\nstart your meals with vegetables\nthe fiber in the veggies when you eat it\nfirst has time to coat your upper\nintestine and create a sort of\nprotective mesh okay like a shield on\nthe walls of your intestine and that\nShield then slows down how quickly the\nrest of the meal is going to access your\nbloodstream how quickly the molecules\nfrom the rest of the meal are going to\nmake their way into your bloodstream and\nso veggies first is this very important\nhack"
