    "transcript": "what is your take on as EMP listen I\nthink for a lot of people it's been kind\nof a godsend um they've really struggled\ntheir whole life with their weight and\nif for some people that's their\nobjective right so whether you take it\nor you don't take it it's not my place\nto judge but what I've found Jay is that\nif you think about it this craze has\nshown us that we live in a society in\nwhich our food system is so toxic that\nwe need to take a pill to prevent us\nfrom eating the food around us do you\nunderstand how sad that is so I just\nfeel a bit worried and a bit\ndisheartened that we've gone to we've\ngone to that place and also when people\nlose weight on OIC they don't just lose\nfat they also lose muscle mass and so\nwhen you stop taking OIC and if you um\ngain weight back you often just gain fat\nback and so overall you're in a worst\nplace so whether or not you take it it's\nimportant to learn my hacks so that way\nwhen you stop it you sustain it"
