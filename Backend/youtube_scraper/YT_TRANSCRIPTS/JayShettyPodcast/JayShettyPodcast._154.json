    "transcript": "so the hack I recommend is after eating\none of your meals a day after one of\nyour meals a day use your muscles for 10\nminutes go for a walk play with your dog\ntidy your apartment I'm a very messy\nperson so I do that one a lot tidy your\napartment do some calf raises if you're\nat your desk at work why not go to the\ngym you know go weight lift because as\nyou do this your muscles are going to be\nusing some of the glucose from the meal\nyou just ate M and if you're an athlete\nand you're doing some very intense\nexercise your body is going to use up\nmost of the glucose from whatever you\neat so the more you exercise the more\nyou can eat glucose before or even after\nactually um and you're experienc much\nless of a spike so if you want to eat a\ncookie or chocolate cake before after\nworkout is actually a pretty good time\nto do it that way a lot of the glucose\nwill go to your muscles instead of\ncausing a spike"
