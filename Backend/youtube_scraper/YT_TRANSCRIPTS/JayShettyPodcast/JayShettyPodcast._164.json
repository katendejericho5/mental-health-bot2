you thanks\nfor having well well I wanted to add\nalso like in the few moments we've spent\ntogether even just walking in you know\nif I can add to that intro you know\nextremely humble gracious kind like\nthoughtful like it's it's also nice\nmeeting that and I and I love that this\nplatform is a space that can come out\nand we were just talking about that you\nwere saying that y you know you've\nalmost been looking for a space where\nyou can share that because you don't do\na lot of press I don't I don't I you\nknow it's seasons for it you know\nobviously you know when you have a\nproject coming out or something you need\nto promote you know there it's a part of\nthat that news cycle but for me\npersonally I I I try to you know kind of\nsay to myself a little bit and and and\num very cautious of how how you want\npeople to get to know you you know when\nyou have opportunities to speak and and\nshare things about yourself um and not\nkind of you know be a part of sometimes\nother people's agenda you know so so\nthat's uh but but but been a big big fan\nof yours for for a long time and the\nwork that you've done and and you are\ncurrently doing and um and felt like\nthis was a good good time to you know to\nget out and talk and and uh you know\nshare some things about me I guess you\nknow I've uh it's been it's been a\njourney you know it's been it's been a\njourney so uh you know this a nice\nlittle check-in point I think yeah I\nlove that well I appreciate the trust\nand I love that checking point because\nit must be fascinating to look back at\nsomething and then think about where you\nwere in life what was going on in your\nmind so I wanted to start with there was\nthis one thing you said in an interview\nand we were talking about this earlier\nthis idea of written versus being able\nto explain correct and there was this\ngreat point you made that I think people\nwouldn't recognize with the amount of\nsuccess you've had had the hits you've\nhad you know I think people want to know\nabout you and learn about you but you\nsaid when you come from where I come\nfrom and everybody doesn't get those\nbreaks that luck you start the question\nwhy am I successful in life why did I go\nthis way and everybody went that way and\nI just thought that that was you know\nagain extremely humble and also\nrepresentative of where you grew up how\nyou came up like which way did everyone\ngo and where did that luck begin for you\nyou know I think coming up in in in Nork\nNew Jersey coming up in that environment\nand you know having you know when you're\nyounger you know you're living life you\nknow you're you're taking it a day at a\ntime you know you're going to basketball\npractice you're going to school you know\nyou're going to church you know you're\nuh for me it was you know taking a lot\nof trips to New York City going on\nauditions at a really really young age\nand just figuring out what what what\nthat is having having parents pretty\naware you know um and and very present\nin my life you know growing up uh you\nknow that was that was rare amongst my\nfamily yeah amongst my friend group you\nknow uh having both parents that was\nthere and very present and um aware of\nmy environment as well you know what\nwhat uh you know being told to look out\nfor these things and uh make good\nchoices to be disciplined to be focused\non things you know get your school you\nknow all the the uh you know the the\npositives in in in growing up in in an\nenvironment like that and you know hats\noff to my parents and to uh to sacrifice\nso much to make sure their kids you know\nwere safe and and grew up in you know in\nyou know grow up in that environment\nain't easy making ends of meet you know\num grew up very poor but didn't feel\nlike it you know what I'm saying it was\nvery you know think they did a good job\nat hiding those things you know I think\nas we get older we look back was like oh\nman we went through that oh oh that's\nwhy we slept in the kitchen at one time\nwith the oven open or oh that's when we\nstayed at Grandma's house for like you\nknow a couple weeks when you you know so\nyou you you get that reflection of of\nhow we kind of grew up and and I think\nfor me you know always having a you know\na bigger purpose I think or just you\nknow just that optimism you know that I\nwas a big dreamer as a kid and and I\nthink you know you start to not just to\nfocusing on the just the work of it all\nbut since I was working such a young age\nthat's the thing that I can kind of\npoint to of you know booking auditions\nand getting this job and traveling to\nthis place and experiencing these things\nand coming back home with these\nexperiences and not having a lot of\npeople who could relate or could you\nknow I could soundboard off of and and I\nthink in feeling like that you don't\nwant to alienate those those people you\nknow uh and I think and this is all I\nguess in hindsight you don't share these\nstories as much you know maybe you\nshould because you don't want somebody\nto feel like inadequate or you know not\nbeing able to have that experience that\nyou might have had and I think you know\nthat snowballs as you as you get older\nand from stepping stone to Stepping\nStone as as as I continue to be\nsuccessful at a at a at a young age um\nyou start to question why am I being so\nsuccessful and the people that look just\nlike me that are right next to me in\nthese everyday things aren't necessarily\ndoing that or not choosing to you know\njust didn't have those options that were\nlaid out to them uh and I and I think it\num you start to doubt yourself for\nwhatever reason or feel guilty for the\nthings that you may or may not have um\neven though you know my parents were\npeople of service you know uh block\nparties or you know cooking Church\ndinners or you know whenever you know my\nhouse was the house that everybody came\nto at some point whether we were going\nto get pizza that night or dad was going\nto take everybody camping or going to\nthese thing like it was that was kind of\nmy house within within my neighborhood\nand community and and um so I think for\nme being a person of service kind of cuz\nyou know just kind of comes from how I\nwas raised and and and those those are\nthe examples that I knew growing up I\nalways felt lucky too as you become more\nsuccessful and and you you see less\npeople look like you that are being\nsuccessful in this in this realm and you\nend up being the one guy that looks like\nme that's successful or the couple guys\nthat or The Usual Suspects that you see\nin the audition room or and things of\nthat nature you know you start to\nsometimes question why why why are you\nnow I can I I I feel as though it was my\nit was my path you know it was my\npurpose and spirituality and growing up\nin a in a household that was very\nfocused on you know you know church and\nspiritual and meditation and and and\njust being aware of of the world that we\nlive in you know I felt I was destined\nfor for something not knowing what that\nwas but just something wow yeah and I\nmean when I'm when I'm hearing that it\nsounds like I love what you said you\nwere like you know they they hid we were\npoor and we didn't even see that but\nthis idea of like you sound so when I\nwhen I see you talk about your family\nand for those of you watching you can\nsee it on Mike's face but there's so\nmuch joy and there's Bliss and there's\nlike a there's like a happiness when\nyou're looking back on that time like I\ncan see it's a positive experience\nbecause of how you feel you've been\nloved and cared for and supported even\nthough the resources may not have been\nthere or the access or opportunities and\nand I was wondering when I was listening\nto you like is there a memory or an\nexperience from your childhood that you\nthink defines who you are today like was\nthere a a memory or a story that you\nhave in your mind of an experience you\nwent through that you think brings out\nmaybe that service element or brings out\nthat purposeful element and I think this\nthis Bliss and this this this appr\nappreciation for how I grew up comes in\nhindsight M you know like you know the\nfirst time you have a moment where\nyou're like pick up the phone you know\none morning you just call your mom and\nbe like thank you I get it I I'm and I'm\nsorry I'm sorry for for being that kid\nat some point and I'm so sorry for not\nunderstanding I totally get what you\nguys are going through sheesh I love you\nguys you know like you you have those\nmoments when you get older you know that\nyou just can't really have that\nperspective when you're you were a kid\nand I think you know I was very\nmischievous you know as well and and and\nI think there were moments when my dad\ndisciplined me you know for for for for\nwhatever the you know whatever I did at\nthat time and then my mom would have a\nconversation me around the why and and\nthen being also forced or pushed and\nnudged into a space where you had to\nacknowledge your siblings also you know\nin that situation and and and the\nimportance of family and what that means\nyou know uh my parents have different\nupbringings you know what I'm saying\nfrom you know uh in different family\nstructures growing up but one thing\nthey've always provided us with is just\na sense of like family over everything\nyou know and how important that is and\nthat just kind of kept the groundedness\nto me throughout so I think just the\nexperiences of of just family I like\nyour point about hindsight I've\ndefinitely made that quote to my mom for\nsure like yeah yeah I've made that my we\naround the same age so for me it's like\nI made that call and I think I made it\nprobably like 25 26 probably around then\nwhen I finally made that call and not\nthat I didn't love my mom before that of\ncourse I did but it was like that honest\nunderstanding of just how hard it was to\ndo what she did cuz she was raising two\nkids she was dropping us to school\npicking us up she was the bread winner\nof the family she made us breakfast\nlunch and dinner fresh every day like\nand you don't recognize that as a kid\nyou don't realize the sacrifice the\nhustle the and and always making you\nfeel loved on top of doing all of that\nit's hard work you've talked you said\nthat now you feel like you've got to a\nplace that it's your path what was that\nswitch for you that went from like I\ndon't deserve this God like I feel out\nof place I'm lucky to being like no\nactually now I see it as this was meant\nto be my path because I think a lot of\npeople and a lot of our listeners will\nbe there like a lot of people are like\nthey're making moves and maybe they're\nfirst person in their family to go to\ncollege or maybe they're the first\nperson who started up a business as an\nentrepreneur or maybe one of our\nlisteners is trying to break\ngenerational trauma and they're the\nfirst person to spot it and but then\nthey all live in that space like can I\ndo this like am I the one to do this and\nso what was it that made that switch\nfrom like I'm not sure I'm the guy but\noh it is my path it's the sum of all\nthings leading up into that point I\nthink it's all the doubt it's the imposs\nhasta syndrome it's the the blessings\nthat you can't really accept\nfully and you listen to other people\nspeak who are successful or you see\nexamples that you kind of feel connected\nto like man that that kind of feels like\nme or what he just said or what she just\nsaid I kind of I resonate with that you\nknow I feel like that sometimes you know\num other people who are looking at you\nsaying no my\nthis is what you have this is what you\ncan be this is what you are nah n that\ncan't no that's that's too good no that\nain't me you know uh your own presence\nin a situation where you have to step\nback and look at yourself and be like am\nI this guy right now like oh man there's\na room for the people who showed up\nbecause of something I'm doing and\nthey're in service or in support of my\nidea my thing okay\nthat looks and feels like I'm the guy\nokay you're in I'm in the industry where\nyou know you're the success of your work\nand your art has been you know dictated\nand validated by other people's opinions\nand whether those opinions are factual\nor projected on you uh from their\nown uh\nindividual\nperspective I think it's it was it was a\ncombination of all those things\nand I've always been curious and walked\ntowards the how do I make myself better\nwhat are the things that I need the\ntools that I need in order to improve\nmyself the way I think the way how do I\nmaximize myself you know so from I think\ngetting a you know an executive coach\nyou know um who talks to Executives all\nday and and and you know how to create\nhealthy conversations the right type of\nconversations to have as you're building\na team team around you cuz you know as\nyou know it's not just us you know we\nhave an entire team of people that's\nsurround us that help us achieve our\ndreams and and and get the big idea done\nyou know a spiritual advisor a spiritual\ncoach that I have um who you know helps\nme uh do my energy work my spiritual\nwork and and and and help sift through\nthe noise and and and and find those\nthings and I think it wasn't until I had\nyou know roll that challenged my spirit\nand myself in a real way that that that\nthat and the weight and and where the\nattention was so loud that it was you\nknow it was deafening and it it was and\nand I couldn't you know um see clearly\nand you know these champagne problems\nyou know what I'm saying I you know you\nknow that like you know we're blessed so\nbut the weight is so heavy you know and\npeople sometimes think and they see what\nwe have or what you know are what we're\nyou know what we're doing and is like oh\njust be grateful you know or just you\nknow what are you complaining about you\nknow and and you know most people\nwouldn't be able to walk you know a\nblock in our shoes you know with with\nthis stuff and I think it was and you\nhave moments where you you resent things\nand you're angry at you know the\nfeelings that you accumulate for not\nbeing clear or or not understanding you\nknow why this there's a lot of wise and\nyou're not going to get all the answers\nbut you want to you know be able to get\nto a place where you're you're clear so\nto answer a question when did I decide\nwhen did I like you know when did I feel\nlike that maybe two years ago maybe a\nyear ago you look at where your family\nhas come from and look at your\nbloodline you know you look you look at\nyou know your community like man there's\na cycle there from generation to\ngeneration that happens mhm when you get\nto yourself you're like man can I stop\nthis can I change this I could do\nthis once you it's like once you once\nyou know better you got to almost do\nbetter once you see it you can't unsee\nit and I would I refuse to ignore it I\nrefuse to see it an opportunity that I\nhad to change things and act like it\ndidn't exist and I think that was the\nthing for me that I was like nah I I got\nto I got to if that's my purpose if\nthat's my path is to just see it and I\ncan see the pieces and if I can just\ncontinue to do this or if I stay down\nthe pathway on that and I I might be\nable to make a big difference in my\nnephew's life or my my my future\nchildren's my future grandchildren's\nlife I got to do that because there's so\nbeen so many people that might that\ndidn't that that it wasn't the perfect\nstorm for them to have that opportunity\nit\nwasn't the right time in the world\ntechnology wasn't there the resources\nthe right social\nconversations are being had for for us\nto have these platforms and speak and be\nsuccessful the way we are you know you\nyou got to you got to do it and and I I\nthink that was a big part of it you know\num you know understanding my own\nmortality you know and and understanding\nyou know that you know life isn't you\nknow isn't a forever thing and I think\nthat happens when you get older too you\nknow what I'm saying like you know just\nturned 37 and it's like wow I vividly\nremember you know 15 I remember 21 I\nvividly remember 25 30 you know and I\nused to look at 35 37 like like ancient\nyou know what I'm saying and I'm like oh\nman we're here and it's\nlike you got to do what you got to do\nwhile you're here and make an impact you\ngot to fulfill your you got to fulfill\nyourself whatever that may be you know\num and uh and I think so yes so that\nthat moment for me where it was like\nokay I can do this I can maybe a couple\nyears ago I think it was like right as I\nwas stepping into directing Creed 3 mhm\nand the weight of that and being the\ncaptain of the ship the first time being\ncaptain of the ship in a you know I've\nmade movies before you know I've I've\nI've done that I know what that's like\nbut I've never ever been the director\nyou know the the captain of the ship and\nI think that responsibility that\npressure that you know I'm not a dad you\nknow but being a everybody's looking to\nyou for the answer for the solve for the\nleadership and I think that really\nthrust me into uh um a mindset of of uh\nof leadership that I never quite had the\nopportunity to do before I I mean\nthere's so much in that it's a great I\nlike it I prefer it that way CU I'm I'm\nconnecting all the dots as you're\nspeaking and there's a I mean there's so\nmany things I want to unpack with that\none of the things that really resonated\nis this idea that you had to challenge\nyourself you had to do something out of\nyour comfort zone in order to even\nrecognize that you could become that you\ncould be and that you could develop and\noften we're waiting to become before we\ntake on the challenge but it's the\nchallenge that makes us become that\nperson and I think we resist even what\nyou said earlier about the opportunities\nthis idea that if you have opportun and\nthere's an Eastern spiritual teaching\nwhich talks about if you have\nopportunities and you don't take them\nthat's a disservice to humanity because\nthey're opening up to you without your\neven without your will sometimes right\nlike there's some of us and we'll\nsabotage ourselves because we'll say oh\nwell I didn't ask for that I I didn't I\ndidn't know that was for me and so I\nlove the idea of anyone who's listening\nor watching what Mike's saying I love\nthe idea of Leaning into that\nopportunity that is opening up for you\nand even if you don't have the skills\nand you don't have the talent yet or you\ndon't have all of the tools and the\nabilities\nit's going to you to devel them and and\nyou talking about the coaching I want to\ngo back to that and ask you about that\nbecause you want to be better mentally\nphysically spiritually it's it's a big\npart of who you are and even the\nprojects you take on which I want to\ndive into that you said roles that\nchallenge your spirit even that idea\nthat you're looking at a role not as oh\nwhat's the next movie to get me the\nthing it's like oh that's going to\nchallenge my spirit I wanted to ask what\nhas been your best habit or tool\nuniquely that you've developed for your\nbody your mind and your spirit\nindividually what have been things that\nyou've done with your coaches in\ndifferent areas that you think has\nbrought about new epiphanies\nopportunities and ideas what have been\nthose tools and hacks that maybe people\ncould lock into as well uh I think\nthere's a this woman Ramona Oliver that\nknown me my entire life you know she's\nmy spiritual adviser and coach and and\nyou know I think starting the day\nyou know in meditation you know you\ntaking a moment to clear yourself and\nprepare yourself for the day um it's so\nimportant to to to step out of your home\nwith intent and intention a lot of times\nit's what are you projecting on a\nsituation to help it manifest instead of\nnegatively thinking about things that\ncan help block your blessings that's a\nbig thing you know so so I think I think\num and we all have moments of negativity\nthat's part of it you know it's ying and\nyang you're never going to fully get rid\nof that but to practice those things in\nthe morning I think was a big help for\nme yeah huge um you know you're shooting\nmovies and you're doing things you're\nwalking out you know there's there's\nthere's you hear stories of people but\nthey just can't get a break sometimes\nand and and for whatever reason it could\nbe from stepping off the curve twisting\nthe ankle to you know the parking ticket\nto the thing to the oh I just can't get\na break and and there's certain people\nthat that carry this Cloud you know and\nI think some of that can be contributed\nto the the thought process and the\nthinking and the energy that you're\nputting into these things and and it's\nsometimes easier set than done but but\nto to stop and to reframe and to clear\nyourself and to you know no I'm walking\nin in this light today and see how much\nof a difference that can make um and and\nmore on the structurally side this guy\nDrew cougler who um no relation to Ryan\ncougler that who was uh you know um\nexecutive coach and and and you know as\nmy ambitions Grew From production\ncompany to Brand marketing Consulting\ncompanies to you know just the products\nand the businesses you know the\nconversations I need to have with the\nteam you know and Leadership and the um\neverybody's coming from different\nbackgrounds and how do you speak\neverybody's love language because\neverybody you have to speak differently\na little bit to everybody so they can\nreceive it the way you meant it you know\nand and I think having the quality of\nconversations is something that was\nreally helpful for me meaningful\nconversations um and giving people the\nspace to um hear me and also hold them\naccountable to the things that I need to\nhold them accountable for um I think\nthough the combination of the two uh\nallowed me to look at situations and\nopportunities differently for people to\nlook at me differently because it's also\na troubling thing when you're walking\naround as talent for a long time that's\nhow they see you you know and you have\nan identity have an identity that's how\nthat's what they're so there's this\nthere's these kid gloves that come along\nwith that you know what I'm saying that\nis it's not everybody's fault that's\neverybody's in a role you have to\nsometimes just step back and look at the\nthing that we're in you know like we're\nin an industry you know that has\ngenerations and generations of taught\nbehavior and practices\nthat any positive disruptor has to\nunderstand those things in order to\ndisrupt them in a way absolutely and\nevolve them you know and and things are\nevolving you see it you know that things\nare evolving in a way and if you can\nlook at it in\na you know in a higher way I think you\ncan find your way through that yeah yeah\nthat resonates there's a you reminded me\nof this beautiful statement from Mark\nTwain where he said that history never\nrepeats itself but it always rhymes and\nI find like when you were talking about\nthe industry I was thinking about how if\nyou don't study history you'll have the\nrhyme happening in your life but then\nyou can't interrupt the pattern so if\nyou were a young star what you were I\nlove the wire as well I've been a fan of\nthe show it's like so you start in this\nindustry early and then you could spend\nyears trying to figure out why you still\nhave the kid gloves on yeah because you\nhaven't studied that wait a minute\nthat's what happens that unless you\ndisrupt the pattern present yourself\ndifferent\nare always say\ntalentor what Hees opposed to oh he's a\ndirector he an entrepreneur oh he's he's\nan investor right I know you have lots\nof Investments all again in the health\nand wellness space like corre sports\nteams and we're talking about moss as\nwell so it's it's interesting how much\nif you don't study the history of our\nindustry we get locked in the identity\nof the role we've played in that space\ncorrect forever correct and and it's so\neasy for us to get used to feeling and\noften we do it to ourself because it's\ncomfortable playing the same role and\nthere's a familiar feeling of when I\nplay this role and I felt that in my own\nsmall way like when I went from having\nto create content to get my message out\nthere even though I wanted to do TV or\nfilm or whatever and couldn't get a\nbreak and so I went to content and then\nI launched a podcast and I told you\nabout why we launched this podcast\nearlier and then I wrote books and it\nwas like every time it was like oh like\noh we thought Jay was this but oh he's\nactually oh and and and I've had to go\nthrough that and I've realized the\nhardest part is you letting go of that\nidentity and Reinventing yourself and\nallowing yourself right going no no\ndefinitely like I mean have you ever\nlike you know has the podcast been\nsomething you've always wanted to do and\nthis is me just curious or is it\nsomething that you had to re you forced\nyourself to re to reinvent yourself in a\nway because this isn't it for you yeah\nyou know what I'm saying I know it's not\nyou know that this is this is a stop for\nyou this is this is a chapter in your\nbook did you ever think I have to\nreinvent myself or is that a product of\nuh the things that were telling you no\nor the things that was challenging yeah\nit's a great question I think it's a mix\nof them all but the thing that kind of\nlike supersedes all of them which I try\nand tap into which I think you'll\nresonate with because I think that's the\nconversation we're having is\nhaving a connection with your intuition\nlike for me it's I'm not looking at like\noh what's the next Trend or like how do\nI disrupt myself how do because to me\nthose things are still following other\npatterns gotcha whereas it's intuitively\ngoing like what is what is the thing\nthat I bring or what do I want to do or\nwhat is the the the missing piece of the\npuzzle that I believe I have a unique\nqualification to fill gotta because if\nI'm always looking around there will\nalways be a million things like I always\nsay to people if you go to a real estate\nconference you'll realize you don't\ninvest enough in real estate if you go\nif you go if you go to a a\ncryptocurrency conference you'll feel\nlike oh crap I didn't do this and if you\nlike if I sit with a group of actors\nI'll be like oh man I should have start\nyou always going to feel the deficiency\nof the trend that you study correct and\nso if you live that way around it gets\nreally complicated because then you're\nlike well do I do this or do I do that\nlike whereas when you when you go inward\nit's like oh I feel alignment yes with\nthis right now because it lets me\nexpress myself it lets me connect with\npeople in a certain way I feel I'm at\nthe right EV evolution in my journey\nwhere it can manifest as opposed to like\noh let me just figure out what the next\nbig thing is which if that that makes so\nmuch sense bro and I think that's what\nit is is like your alignment with where\nyou feel truthful yeah you know and and\nsometimes that always doesn't mean\nyou're going to be financially okay\ntotally as well you know you know you\ncan feel exp aligned and everything and\nmortgage is due you know rent is due you\nfeel me so so there's that element of it\nas well that you have to find your your\nway through yeah that that that\nintuition that that North Star is what\nis something that has led me all types\nof places uh that I wouldn't trade in\nfor the world you know just that feeling\nof this feels right and I I know does it\nmake\nsense probably there's probably some\nother things on paper that that seems\nlike the better option or choice but\nthis feels right and and you know more\noften than that you know it it's it's\nbeen the right move yeah I love what you\nwere saying earlier about how the\nthought process is such a powerful way\nof breaking out over the cloud over your\nhead and I think we all have moments\nwhere the cloud feels like it's never\nmoving it's constantly raining on you\nand I think a lot of people who are\nlistening may feel that way like have\nyou ever been in that place and and how\nhave you what has helped with your\nthought process has you been tuning that\nwhat's worked for you at least that's\nyour moment that's your moment it's not\nthat All Is Lost when you're feeling the\nmost trapped and and down and nothing\ncan't go right I feel like those are the\nmoments that define you those are those\ncharacter Canon moments that are like\nwhat am I going to do now you know how\ndo you respond to that and thinking your\nway feeling your way working your way\nthrough those things on the other side\nit's like you know I don't know who said\nthis saying but like usually you know\nyou're the\nclosest to getting what you want is\nalways the hardest it's always the\nfeeling when you're getting ready to you\nknow people give up right before they\nget what they've always wanted to get\npeople quit and they give up and I will\nnot be the person who quit before I got\nwhat I wanted or what I needed or what I\nfelt I was supposed to have you know\nlike and if that wasn't for me it wasn't\nfor me I'mma keep grinding I'mma keep\nknocking on the door until I get what I\nfeel that's been something I've always\nfelt since having the name Michael\nJordan and understanding that there's\nanother guy out there Nam Michael Jordan\nthat was the best ever to do something\nand being teased and picked on about\nthat and and and and and made me for a\nmore not wanting to play sports but then\nit was like nah I'm actually going to\nmake sure I'm compet I'm going to\ncompete at least I'm going to compete\nyou're going to at least see me I'm\ngoing to be somebody that it's not going\nto be oh his name is this it's going to\nbe oh no but he can play or oh no he can\noh he he he has something about him\nsomething that is formidable that is\nabove average that is that is unique to\nhim and and I it gave me a healthy chip\nyou know so so and and for the people\nwho are listening who you know who do\nhave you know that doesn't feel like\nthey can change the circumstances with\nthe way they think or they feel just\nhold on just endure endure you know uh\nlook at things differently challenge\nyourself to look at things as the glass\nhalf full challenge yourself to think\nfour steps ahead think your way through\nit like now we have so many tools we\nhave so much information there a lot of\nmisinformation out there but but there's\nso much information to to be curious\nfind something that you that does\nresonate with you even if it's not in\nthe world that you ever thought you\nwould be in find something that you\nalign with and cuz everybody aligns with\nsomething that's not an excuse I'm going\nI'm willing to take from anybody you\nknow align with something and find your\nfind your positivity find your intuition\nwithin that thing and and and be\nobsessed about it what have you been\nobsessed with lately like what would you\nsay is the thing you're most obsessed\nwith right now or or that you have been\nin the past couple of years that has\nkind of just attracted and I've been\nobsessed with getting my team right I've\nbeen obsessed with getting the right\nPersonnel on the right brain frequency\nand getting everybody on the same page\nto\nto accomplish these things that we need\nto go accomplish because I truly believe\nit's going to be better for everyone I\nthink it's really going to make an\nimpact you know um and and so there's\nthere's a there's a obsessiveness that\nyou got to have to overc communicate to\nfollow up to be redundant to be\nconsistent you know that you need and\nand I'm obsessed about it you know\nstrengthening my family mhm I'm obsessed\nover it you know uh to lead by example\nyou know and break generational trauma\nand curses I'm obsessed over it um and\nI'm obsessed over every project that I\nuh lend myself to so this next movie\nthat me and Ryan's doing I'm literally\nyou know I'm growing all my stuff out\nyou know what I mean my hair and stuff\nout now I'm becoming obsessed with it\nyou know and and that character and it's\nit's a it's an addictive feeling to have\na thought and see it come to fruition to\ncreate something out of out of you know\nout of an from an idea yeah um and to be\npersistent and to see it and to manifest\nit you know um manifestation I I just\nlove it you know what I mean it's just\ncool so so that's something that I've\nbeen I've been really really um locked\nin with and I think it's also something\nthat it's going to help people you know\nthere's there's always a I don't want\nanything that's not multi- hyen in I I\nwant I want anything that I'm involved\nin it it has to have layers to it um you\nknow how do you help how do you educate\nwhat's to leave\nbehind what blueprint am I leaving for\nthe Next Generation you know I got a\nnephew now you know that is looking up\nat me constantly yes because of height\nbut also because of the\nexample you know and he's mimicking\neverything I do he mimicking anything I\ncan say something do something I can sit\na certain type of away oh snap he's\ndoing it too it's crazy so it clarifies\nyour intention when you do things\nbecause you wanted to have you know\npurpose and intention you know um so th\nthose are the things and I'm obsessed\nwith being the best version of myself\nand that's a daily thing you know um and\nsome days are better than others finding\nmy myself in a world\nwhere there's so\nmany seen opinions about\nyourself uh when everybody's telling you\nwho and what you are you know learning\nhow to live you know growing up in then\nlike and it's so wild I've been doing\nthis for 25 years straight you know and\nthat's a wild thing to think about but\nman more than half of my life has been\nmy identity was been through the work\nthat I've been doing and and growing up\nin with you know social media what\ndidn't exist now it does at a point\nwhere I'm old enough to understand what\nthat can do so I'm obsessed with finding\nmyself\nnow uh after and and not having to prove\nanything to anybody other than myself\nand my family you know but really myself\nand realizing that that is\nenough you know what I'm saying like\nthat like giving your\nbest is enough and and sometimes we lose\ntrack of that you know and and yeah so\nfor anybody out there you know you're\nenough man absolutely let's let's toast\nto that let's toast that yeah yeah yeah\nyeah shake it up shake it up yeah man\nand this is the pure so we have three\nflavors right now the mango ginger the\npomegranate but this is the cheers ah\ncheers my appreciate you bro I'm excited\nto try this\nM oh that's good that's easy easy it's\neasy and anybody has had like fresh\nseaons in the past they might not they\nmight not had a good experience cuz they\neither they like they they kind you know\ntried to clean it and process it\nthemselves so smooth smooth yeah don't\ntaste like the ocean but it tastes a\nlittle you know it's it's a little\nheightened it's like it's refreshing\nit's smooth and it's easy that's how I\nfeel about it it's like yeah I'm like\nthis is like and it's a great mixure you\nknow you know I don't know if you know\nif you want to do a we call them Moss\nTails but like if you want to do like\nmocktails moss tails you know what I'm\nsaying or if you want to mix them like\nwith drinks like with with the spirits\nand stuff like that it's a really good\nuh yeah man I just this this is five\nyears of of obsession uh you know\nobviously when you know Health scares\nall over the place people you know not a\nlot of information on what's really\ngoing on what can help what canot help I\nwas you know finishing up a movie in\nBerlin um and you know doing my own\nstunts not sleeping a lot in a farm\nplace you know uh food was really wasn't\nreally my thing as much and I was\nlooking for something to kind of just\nhelp me get through my shoot days and um\nand I was just chug seos like I mean by\nthe jar just to I mean I I was it's got\nto be doing good I know it's doing good\nyou know just buy the jar and and and\nthen you know on the flight home it was\nlike it's got to be a better way yeah so\nI started making smoothies started you\nknow blending them in and my sister was\npregnant with my uh my nephew Linux at\nthe time so you know at that point\neverybody was in their own bubble you\nknow and you know you know wasn't able\nto kind of visit many people so we would\njust blend up smoothies drop them off at\nthe front door you know that was my\nlittle care package that I would do I\nwould do I would do seos and I would do\nlike a you know a homemade little pasta\nand that was my Act of service for my\nfamily you know so so so that that labor\nof love that that that kind of uh it\nstarted from a place of just trying to\nhelp my family just like you know stay\nhealthy during the pandemic and it\nslowly evolved in something that I\nwanted to get you know uh make it\naccessible to everyone yeah for people\nwho don't know the benefits of seos what\nare some of the things in the properties\nit's that cognitive brain you know it's\nthat Clarity uh your your your immune\nsystem so being able to harvest them in\na way that that gets those nutrients\ninside of this drink in your daily dose\nof moss is something that I was really\nreally exciting me um about just like\nmaking a beverage about it yeah the alus\nis great too there's no it's it's there\nyou know it makes you want to drink more\nof it yeah 100% yeah and um good man\nit's good man it's good and and it's\nit's uh yeah I'm proud of it yeah proud\nof\ncongratulations now we know we got to go\nto yours man what's up no we'll have to\ndo a we'll have to do a Mel now with Jun\nM yeah no but I love it cuz Asanda we\ngot Asanda in ours as well and Jin sync\nso I mean you you you got all the\nadapted in it so that's great yeah yeah\nno it's been it's been a labor of love\nfor us too it's like me and my wife\nalways talked about it as our Co baby\nit's like this is what we were working\non cuz we were the same we've been\naddicted to tea our whole lives and we\ndid a hot tea as well but we were like\nyou know for a lot of people their hot\ndrink is coffee and we're like well wait\na minute what if your soda could be\nhealthy for you and good for you and you\nknow how could we do it where it has you\nknow zero grams of sugar like how do you\nstill get it to taste great with no\nsugar CU me and my wife are both off of\nrefined sugars and trying to be healthy\nand all the rest of it and then you\nrealize that all the sodas you're\ndrinking are full of it so how do we\nmake it easy for people to understand\nthese herbs and these adaptogens and you\nknow because a lot of people we grew up\nwith it we were lucky in our culture in\nIndian culture you grow up with a lot of\nthese herbs and spices in your daily\nfood exactly and but a lot of people\ndon't have access to that so it's like\nhow do you make it easy when people may\nnot have in their kitchen so yeah man I\nI I'll send you some to try later as\nwell no please do man I say you got the\nagivey in there and everything and I\nlove this man I was loving what you were\nsaying about the building of teams\nbecause and something you said was like\nhow do you keep everyone on like the\nfree same frequency and like attract\nthose people and I went I went through a\nbig thing for that in a certain part of\nmy work around two years ago a lot of\npeople that are in my sphere today some\nof them have been around since the\nbeginning and and some of them came on\nin the last two years and it has been\nlifechanging like absolutely\nlifechanging from an energy standpoint\nfrom a spirit standpoint and from a\nproductivity Effectiveness standpoint\nhow have you been trained or what do you\nhow do you sense Beyond like someone\nbeing able to do the job obviously how\nhave you been able to learn how to sense\nor understand whether someone's on that\nsame brain wave and as you said or brain\nenergy as you are and and has that same\nvalue set that you have I think it's a a\nlot of conversations and and and\nsometimes trial and error uh I think my\nin my intuition and my gut is is the\nfirst you know litness test is the first\nkind of line of defense you know that I\nthat I have of energies Vibe you know\nwhat I'm saying like Okay that that that\nthat you feel on par how you know how\nyou answer a question what are the\nthings that you're saying you know um\nare you speaking from ego are you\nspeaking about you know what what is the\nwhat is the thing you know you you know\nwe're used to we meet so many people we\nhave to use Quick judgments and who gets\nour time you know um who do you open up\nto who do you not and I think when it\ncomes to building into a team uh\nespecially nowadays you're coming into\nsomething that's that's well oiled yeah\nyou're coming into a machine already so\nyou have to fit not just with me but you\nhave to kind of fit with everybody you\nknow you you you have to know how to\ncommunicate the things you need to know\nhow to communicate to you have to the\nego is something that can get in a lot\nof people's way when joining a team and\njoining something that's already really\nestablished and I think I think um\ncoming to a place of learning and\nlistening is really important and not\ntaking things personally um I I think I\nthink uh and then it's something to the\npeople that's already been in the team\nto understand that there's going to be\nadditions and there is a process of\nthere's a onboarding there's a welome\nthere's a thing that you have to to\nbring people into the fold in a way to\nget the best out of them so I think\nthere's been there's been those learning\nthings along the way that's really that\nreally helped me identify people who um\nthat fit and work well within the circle\nyou know um and and uh yeah I think\nthat's been my my kind of process thus\nfar um and then yeah I always want to\ncreate an environment where people want\nto be yeah you you know you're not here\nfor a check yeah you're here because you\nbelieve in what we're doing and what we\nwant to do and I'm pretty transparent\nabout those things you know so so I\nthink I think just being extremely\ntransparent and and and forward with\nthose things and and and know that\nthere's nothing personal if this isn't\nit you know like I'm I'm the best I'm\nthe I'm the Gody that's always going to\ngive you a great recommendation you know\nwhat I mean like I'm I want I want\npeople to win you know at the end of the\nday I want people to win and and seeing\nsomebody in their strengths you know and\nbeing like okay I I can use that that\nthis this this would be helpful in this\nway um and if that works out it works\nout and if not then man I man I want to\nsee you do well yeah I love that yeah we\nI remember years ago I was listening to\nEric Schmidt who was the CEO of Google\nfor a bit yeah and he was talking about\nhow they were looking for smart\ncreatives and I love that that they had\ntwo words that kind of summed up what\nthey looked for they they looked for\npeople who were smart creatives and for\nme it became humble Champions I was like\nI want humble winners I want I want the\npeople who can want to win and have that\nambition but are able to put their ego\naside because then we're going to speed\nup getting there because the thing that\nslows you down from winning is ego like\nthe thing that stops you from passing\nthe ball is ego or you know bowing out\nand saying it's your turn is ego and so\nbut but you still have to have that\nchampion mind ship because it isn't just\nabout oh yeah no no no you do it your\nthing like and that was a big thing and\nthen the other thing that worked for me\nwas I was like I need to work with\npeople that I could go to breakfast\nlunch or dinner with if we didn't work\ntogether do I actually want to go to\nbreakfast and dinner with this person\nbecause I probably will be when I'm\ntraveling or on the road that means I\nlike spending time with them which means\nI'm happy to coach them and I'm happy to\nlearn from them exactly whereas if I\ndon't want to and and initially I was\nlike that I used to just hire people who\nare great at what they did we didn't\nreally have chemistry like we didn't we\ndidn't we couldn't hang out and that\nwasn't because they were wrong it was\nalso because I wasn't aware gotta and\nand then of course yeah the mission the\npurpose is I mean that's core and\nCentral and because even for you I mean\nyou're spending time from your family\nwith you know your team becomes your\nextended family they they absolutely\nthey are your family you're eating like\nsaid breakfast lunch and dinner you know\nlike there's there's a part of you that\nyou know it has to feel like I'm getting\na little bit of my family here and if\nit's not that you know it's really hard\nfor me you know obviously like you know\nyou have a bigger company and there's\nemployees and you're not going to be as\npersonal with everybody within the\ncompany you know you're not having\nbreakfast lunch or dinner with everybody\nbut but there's a there's a there's a\nFeeling of you know I I don't mind on a\nSunday everybody at my house watching a\ngame spending time CU that's when not\nthe nine to5 time to be creative or the\nN9 to5 time to do the job that's the\nthat's the extra mile that's the oh I\nhad this idea and I was just thinking oh\noh we're looking at something together\nand this would be great though the best\nideas sometimes come from those just\nhangout moments and those moments where\nyou're just spending time with with uh\nwith people that you work with so yeah I\nthink that yeah you're right that's\nthat's really important yeah for sure\nwhen before the obsession point that\ncame up which which was fascinating I'm\nglad I asked you that and you went you\nwent into it you're talking about like\nyou know you you live in an industry and\nyou talked about social media where\npeople have an opinion of you people\npeople even an opinion it's like people\nhave a lens because they've seen you in\na particular light and I was wondering\nlike what do you think something that\npeople get right about you and what's\nsomething that people sometimes get\nwrong about you like what what do you\nfeel like when it comes to that like\nI'll tell you mine like I feel like for\nme a lot of people think that I get like\noften because of what I teach and what\nI'm sharing and what I'm guiding it's\nlike oh well Jay must get everything\nperfect all the time and like you know\nhe's like super deep and like always\njust saying profound things and and\nthat's not true obviously because as\nmuch as that is who I am and that is my\nheart I'm not always like that like I\nhave I have bad days I have bad moods I\nhave off days I have I have days when\nI'm not feeling that way right and so\nthat's that's something that people get\nwrong about me sometimes in in that\nperception because but I'm dedicated to\nthis work I'm obsessed with it I'm\nobsessed with being but that doesn't\nremove me from flaws and\nweaknesses and and so yeah you should do\na blooper\nreel you should do a blooper outtake\nreel of those moments you have your team\ncatch you in these little moments and\nyou should put one out that'll be fun\nthat would be fun that would be fun I\nthink yeah I like that I like that that\nwould be a good one I I think for me is\nlike I think I've intentionally stayed\nout the way so much where I'm not giving\nanybody any anything to go off of other\nthan what I want you to know you know I\nthink I think that's been it for a long\ntime I've always had the approach of\nlike not speaking on things and not\ngiving them life you know there's\nthere's there's going to be perspectives\nand there's things about you that just\naren't true uh do you do you care to\ncorrect somebody or not you know cuz\nmost of the time people's minds are made\nup no matter what you say it is what\nit's going to be you know stay out the\ncomment section you know I mean you get\nsome great entertainment in there but\nthen you can get a lot of Stu that is\njust people who want to\nproject the thing that's going to get\nthe most attention and the issue that I\nhave with a lot of that is they can be\ncompletely false and we have a a\nindustry of we were talking earlier the\nlack of Journalism and the skill of that\nthat will run with those things knowing\nthat there is no basis to them but now\nthat's a narrative that's attached to\nyou that you have to be strong enough\nand strong minded enough to ignore\nknowing it's not true or this human\nnature feeling of wanting to no that's\nnot true I want people to know this\nabout me and I've always walked on that\nline\nof you know not\ncaring trying not to care and knowing\nthat I'm enough and and knowing my truth\nand the people who know me know me you\nknow I am about my community and my\npeople you know\nwholeheartedly and a lot of the choices\nthat I make and the things that I want\nto do and be a part of is in service of\nthat bigger picture you know of of\nhelping that you know my community in a\nin a big way um so I think the biggest\nthing sometimes if if they ever feel\nlike that they're not my top priority is\nmaybe one of the biggest\nmisconceptions um you know the the love\nI have for my community regardless of\npeople's approach I think everybody has\na different strategy and approach to how\nthey affect and make change everybody it\ndoesn't all look the same um and because\nit may not be typical or the average\nvoice because the package is different\nand the craft and my field is different\nso I have a different set of\nboundaries that exist in my Lane that I\nmaneuver without in and out of like I\nlove playing chess I love I love I love\nstrategy I love I love rever reverse\nengineering and Building Things So I I\nthink I think that's one of the the\nbiggest things and you\nknow sometimes ignorance and a laugh or\na joke or a like or a thing we've we've\nuh encouraged Ed the\nbehavior of negativity and things and\nloudest is all is the thing and and and\nthat's just not what that's not what I'm\ninto yeah I'm into the love of things\nI'm into the the humanity and bringing\npeople together the best way and but\nalso I'm human yeah no I I appreciate\nthat I mean I I also think we've put a\nfalse pressure on the definition of\nauthenticity meaning you share\neverything with everyone and I'm not\nsure I V with that definition because I\nthink authenticity by nature is you\nsharing what you feel comfortable with\neach person like that's what it means to\nbe authentic and you could argue that\nauthentic just means being however you\nwant to be in any given situation and so\nI think there has become a false\npressure of oh you got to show your\nauthentic by showing every part of\nyourself and I don't know if that that\ntriggers anything for you is like what's\nthe definition of authenticity for you\nor for me that's what it is but what is\nit for you I think it's um but then in\nhindsight there's a there's a piece of\nit that not even just to go back but\nthere's there's also like maybe that's\nmy insecurity framing\nwhat the loudness of the things that I'm\nmost sensitive of is is this noise\nsomehow yeah it triggers us for a reason\nyou know what I'm saying there's some\nstuff that you just go oh yeah I don't\ncare yeah whatever but it's like like\nlike man like why does that why does\nthat bother me so much like there's\nsomething there's something about that\nthat because I know what that does in\nthe bigger like I'm always thinking\nbigger picture it's very rarely that I\nreally focus on the thing it's always\nabout what's the cause of that in a\nbigger conversation you know um the the\nauthenticity to\nme is being able to sleep at night being\nable to go talk to my mom and and\nknowing that the the people that know me\nevery fiber of my being every my\nintention knows my heart through and\nthrough that they see the same person\nthey're able to connect with the same\nenergy and the same Vibe and The Same\nSpirit my energy has never changed you\nknow I think being authentic to that\nfrequency is super important to me no\nmatter where I go no matter how I evolve\num and have to mature and grow up I want\nmy energy to always feel the same that's\nwhy you meet certain people and it's\nbeen years that go by and you pick right\nback up where you left off it feels like\nno time is lost that energy is never\nit's always the same and I I love when\npeople I haven't seen in a long time or\ncome at me like man whoa it feel you\nknow it's the same and and that that\njust lets me know that I'm not losing\nmyself I'm not losing track of you know\nwho I am yes and where I come from and I\nI am always going to be an Agent of\nChange trojan horse or not you know what\nI'm saying and and yeah you just and\ncontinue to lead by example you know I\nknow I know um the path that I'm on\nisn't easy you know sometimes it may\nlook easy you know uh for the successes\nor whatever but but it's uh behind\nclosed doors I'm doing I'm doing the the\nthe work so the future Generations have\nit a little bit easier or have a little\nbit more tools to use um and they can\nask for certain things that won won't be\nlike what it'll be almost standard form\nyou know and you know from my vantage\npoint I'm able to see a lot of the road\nblocks that exist within systems you\nknow and and paperwork and preceden I've\nbeen chipping away at those where I can\nin places and there's so many look I say\nI a lot in this interview there's so\nmany people out there are doing that\ntype of work you know that exist men and\nwomen in these places that are breaking\ndown doers that are chipping away like\nsha Shank Redemption you know grab rock\nat a time gravel at a time you know\neventually that hole is going to be open\nyou know what I'm saying eventually it's\ngoing to be open but just chipping away\nand unfortunately everybody can't be the\nloudest one in the room you know got to\nbe sometimes you got to be the quiet guy\nin the room you got to listen and and\nlook and pay attention and and and and\nmove how you need to move uh the chest\npieces they have different rules and\ndifferent movements for a reason you\nknow and they're on the board in\ndifferent places for a reason and and uh\nI know my place on the board and I think\nthat's that's what it comes down to\nright it's like I appreciate you\nbringing out that point around how\nthings that trigger us give us somewhere\nto focus on in our within ourselves like\nI feel like that too like I'm like\nthere's certain things that just don't\nphase me at all and I can look like the\nmost detached guy and like I'm you know\nI'm bulletproof and then there's\nsomething that gets through that vest\nit's it's just like and and you know\nit's because there's a part of it that\nfeels true and and there's a part of you\nthat you've allowed for it to feel true\nbecause it could be that you are there's\nthere's a part of your self-esteem you\nhaven't worked on there's there's\nsomething you took from your childhood\nand made true for you and now when\nsomeone else says it and you didn't even\nknow where it came from came from but\nyou know I was talking to a friend the\nother day and we were talking about how\none of his mentors was letting him down\nand we discovered in that I've been\nfriends with this guy for like 20 years\nwe're best mides and it was like 20\nyears later we figured out that he'd\nmade his mentor his father figure okay\nand he didn't really put two and two\ntogether until just now and neither did\nI for him and he was like wait a minute\nno wonder I'm feeling so much pain with\nthis mentor of mine because I'd made him\na father figure and gone through that\nfeeling of he's Superman and now\nrealizing he's not even though I'm a\n40-year-old man for him and so it's just\nso interesting how the stuff that gets\nunder our skin yeah it can just be\nhidden there and it gets stale and stuck\nand and then you don't look at it\nbecause you're like oh no no it's\nnothing it's nothing but at one point\nwhen you feel safe enough you have to\nkind of like look under the hood and go\nyou know why is that there but coming on\nto the point you were just making around\nPaving the way for others and setting an\nexample and the responsibility that\ncomes with and like you said there's so\nmany people doing that I feel like how\nwould you define your current purpose\nlike how do you define with everything\nyou're doing because you talked about\npurpose being a big thing for you and\nyou talk about the mission of your\ncompany like what is the purpose of that\nwork who which doors are you trying to\nopen which paperwork are you trying to\nshift what systems are you trying to\naffect I think I have my purpose right\nnow yeah that's what I mean yeah you\nknow I think I have a a chapter 25 years\nacting um you know producing you know\nbeing in front of the camera being\nTalent learning so much about the world\nabout myself about the industry you know\nI think being a a representative as a\nfor my community in a in a way that\nplaces that a black actor hasn't gone\nyou know um obviously you have the great\nyou have the wills and the Denzel you\nknow what I'm saying that that I look up\nto in a big way that you know that that\nthrough their talent the the the\nbusiness and The Craft\nhas extended to a New Height M so\nthey've opened up doors for me that I\ndidn't even know was possible that now\nit's like oh wow now we have this and\nthat now I could do that and do that so\nthey've kicked the door down in a way\nthat's like you know internally\ngrateful so like leading by example is\nis a big purpose you know to for people\nto be able to see it because it was big\nfor me to see it and think that I can do\nit too so there that there that part of\nit there's the um the business side of\nthings that I've got an opportunity to\nlearn from investing your money you know\nwhat do you do with the the savings and\nthe things that you do have I'm big\nSports guy you know I've always wanted\nto you know own a team I'm competitive I\nwant to be involved in that in that in\nthat environment that energy you know of\nsports and uh found a football team you\nknow in Bournemouth and a great\npar football\nyour I've literally had to like you know\nbite my I cannot say soccer anymore say\nfootball got say football yeah\nuh and and um great great partner and\nyou know Bill fool and he owns the Las\nVegas golden kns and and really trying\nto turn that program around and and just\njust amplify it in a big way but\nlearning you know how to invest in those\nthings you know uh oh there's going to\nbe a new stadium oh there's opportunity\nto invest in real estate oh wow now\nyou're investing in real estate in\nsomething that's going to be around for\nyou know however many year lease and\nthis and that okay cool I could take\nthat and oh wow uh investing in you know\nstarted a uh a JV for you know um\nunderneath an umbrella company to have\nyour own product and then from there you\ncan create another JV oh you can invest\nCapital oh you can have a venture F oh\noh snap okay wow this is a whole other\ngame this is a whole other Nuance of uh\nAcquisitions and investment and capital\nthat I never even knew exist I'm I'm\nused to you know W9 forms and taxes you\nknow like you know what I'm saying on\nthat you know on on on the talent side\nthere's a whole other game to be played\num and and taking that information just\nthe information that that exists and\nwhat that would do to you know to to the\nNext Generation you know knowing what's\navailable to him knowing that there's\nother ways to maximize my my my brand\nyou know your brand um creating things\nownership of things\num as streamers and Studios and there's\nthere's so many other platforms that are\nyou know people are content crazy you\nknow podcasts you know it's become a\nbusiness as well you know new you know a\nnew Venture that that people are be able\nto monetize their own their own\nfollowing their own their own likeness\nin a real way retirement what does that\nlook like really you know do you know\nreally a will well leaving a will behind\nlike what like I mean know I mean\nthere's things that you just don't get\ntaught you know there's nobody you know\nso so I've stumbled on it upon it these\nthings within my success and my\nintuition and my Partnerships and my\nrelationships that but again it goes\nback to like the why me this one guy you\nknow that has got has gotten access to\nall these things and my man over here or\nmy guy over there nope that you guys\nwould never know about none of these\nthings because of how whatever your Life\nPath has taken you is not been in these\nareas or nobody's had the opportunity to\nsay those things to you so I put that on\nme as a to be able to to give that\ninformation you know in a real way and\nidentify the you know people that are\nhungry enough and you know that want it\nyou know that want it they got to want\nit and they gota be a then come on let's\ngo figure it out all right let me let me\nlet me figure out how to help set you up\nwith the right people so you got the\nright conversations you know and then\nyou also got to be careful who you help\ntoo you know you can't you know you want\nto help everybody but you can't help\neverybody um but you can leave a\nblueprint for everyone you know\nsometimes that's all a person should\nneed sometimes is seeing it and and\nbeing and in in the thought then you got\nto leave it on the person to do their\ntheir part of the work to lift that part\nof the weight to put on that burden to\ngo do that for themselves their family\ntheir their their their people within\ntheir their Circle and stuff yeah for\nsure I like that man that's I mean it's\nsuper powerful because I think yeah so\nmany people don't have access to don't\nunderstand don't have the language don't\nhave the vocabulary and it's a it's a\nhuge purpose what do you do when it all\njust gets too much when you're like it's\na lot a lot you know CU you're on shoot\ndays you're busy you got this gun like\nwhat do you do when it all gets too much\nwhat's the first thing I try to go to\nJapan I I try to get on the first thing\nsmoking to Japan I'm out of here uh it's\none of the few places that I've been\nthat I I feel like I just exist yeah you\nknow what I'm why Japan I been growing\nup I've been obsessed with anime I'm a\nbig anime guy you know know so since I\nwas like you know 11 12 years old it's\nbeen anime you know and that's been my\ncartoons comic books anime I mean that's\njust like my you know uh\nescapism I'm in that and you know\ngrowing up watching those shows you they\nthere so much of their identity and\ntheir culture in the dialogue and the\nmessaging and all that stuff so I just\nhad this idea this place in my head\nthat was full of respect and it was\nhospitable and uh hard work work and\ntradition and you know I mean thousands\nof years of you know a couple thousand\nyears of tradition you know what I'm\nsaying that you know that that\nexists and and I was like man I wonder\nwhat at this place going to live up to\nthe expectation obviously the food and\nthe culture all that good stuff and uh\nyeah when I went it it was it was\neverything that I thought it would be\nand more you know um and obviously I\nwent went the right type of way I you\nknow I created anime as well you know I\nwanted to like you know CU there they're\nso loving and and and and um welcoming\nin a really big way and yeah for me\ngoing there there's not a you know a\nmillion phones being out everybody\nthey're very respectful of your space\nthey're um and people are going to\nobviously come up and say what's up you\nknow that's what's going to happen but\nit's it's in a way where you don't feel\nlike I have to hide as much I feel like\nI could walk down the streets there a\nlittle bit more Loosely and that's\nsomething that you know I don't really\nhave as much here in LA or you know New\nYork you get a little a bit more of it\nyou know what I'm saying you can kind of\nlike you know people need go sometimes\nlike whatever keep it pushing but it's\nit's it's a it's a different thing but\nsomething about Japan that was awesome\nand you know um and another place that I\ncan't wait to really go is Ghana as well\nDad's been spending a lot of time there\nwow I haven't like for my SK for\nwhatever reason every time that I'm\ntrying to go something that I cannot\nchange pops up but but that's a place\nthat people tell me stories of a similar\nfeeling of going there in the love and\nAffinity of being in that place and\nreally want to go there as well so so\nthat that's that so if I can't get to\nJapan I'm usually at the house I'm\neither cooking or playing like Call of\nDuty I'm I'm I'm playing Call of Duty\nonline you know what I'm saying uh with\nmy boys back back you know from from all\nover and uh and and you know it's a\nplace where you can you know it's fair\ngame you know it's even playing field\nyou know what I'm saying you know some\nmindless you know kind of you know you\nknow camaraderie with your boys and\nstuff you know it's I love cooking food\nis a love language for me you know so so\nbeing able to you know find a recipe or\ntry something new and combin flavors\nprobably you never thought would go\ntogether and just creating those those\nmoments is another form of art too um\nand and and I like people enjoying\npeople eating my food you know like like\nserving people and being like you know I\nnormally don't like land but have you\nhad it like\nthis and then uh and it's having people\njust you know react to that is is a is a\num is something that I enjoy doing too\nnow with Borth we're going to have to\nget you into FIFA as wellif yeah I gota\nget on that's the next\none okay that's my that's my guilty\npleasure some easy wins at first so we\nwe'll start off I'll be B you'll be bman\nokay all right cool got it you Pi you\nyeah be good dude uh you've been amazing\ntoday I've got a few more questions want\nto ask you before I let you go that this\nquestion is like what has been a lesson\nyou wish you learned earlier in life\nlike is there a lesson that you learned\nrecently like I wish I learned this one\nearlier I\nthink being\nunapologetically honest with what you\nwant and that and that goes across the\nboard I was trying to think of something\nthat kind of across the board if you can\ncommunicate your\ntruth and and and not worry so much\nabout how somebody is going to react to\nwhat you say cuz a lot of times the fear\nof how somebody's going to react to what\nyou you really want to say is what stops\nyou from saying it sometimes and you\nfind another way or you put it off or\nyou don't say it and maybe the situation\ndoesn't change and and you you get\nfrustrated and upset why this thing\ndoesn't change because you kind of maybe\nmight not have said it the way you\nwanted to say you know and I think\nthere's a you know a way to be\nunapologetically and still be respectful\nand speak your truth if I think I would\nhave done that earlier what said down I\nI I would have been further along in\nrelationships that I have with people I\ncare about and and and not intimately I\nmean I mean I mean ac across the board\nRel uh work relationships business\nfamily female friends you know whatever\nit may have been I think being honest\nwith with with where you stand and how\nyou feel it's really given another\nperson an option and opportunity to be\nas honest with you MH and whatever your\nfear of that is of that outcome is never\nreally as big as what you make it up to\nbe you know it's really not that so I\nwould say I would say maybe just being\nbeing being honest and um and living\nwith the results you know and and\ntomorrow is not promised to anyone but\ntime will move on you know you will move\npast it you know um and if tomorrow\nnever come at least you can know that\nyou said what you needed to say yeah you\nknow so I think that's one thing that I\nfeel like like earlier on if I could if\nI if I had that might have been better\nyeah that's a thoughtful answer I was\nthinking when you were saying that it's\nlike we we're so scared of our honesty\nhurting someone not re realizing that us\nholding back our honesty is hurting them\neven more and longer term it is it's a\nhard it's a hard one because when you\nhave to be honest it makes you look\nworse it makes you feel bad it makes\nthat person feel bad it gets it gets\nmessy on so many levels but what if that\nperson needed to hear it yeah you know\nwhat if that person never heard that\nthat note or that that thought or\nperspective and then they go on in life\nyou know continuing to you know move and\nact and speaking way without that you're\ndoing almost a disservice you know it\ngoes back to like knowing if you know\nbetter you got to do better right like\nso so I think that kind of maybe speaks\nto like a bigger thing with me of like\nwanting to just be better and wanting\npeople around me to be better and grow\nyou know because I guess one going back\nto you know just the other misconception\nis like you know thing of people look at\nme and think I got everything I got it\nall you know it's not true man like I'm\nflawed you know and I'm and I'm actively\ntrying to get better daily you know and\nI fail all the time and I come up short\nall the time on even how to communicate\nno matter how much coaching I go through\nand you know and practice and and and\nand and running conversations through my\nhead you know in the shower and like all\nright I'm going to say this I'm going\nsay that I want to hit that point okay\nyou know what I'm saying and you know\nI'm just in the I'm I'm trying to do my\nbest you know and and I think the weight\nto try to live up to everybody's perfect\nexpectation of me has been really really\nheavy for a long time you know and I\nthink the last couple years I've been\ntrying to maneuver out of that uh Mike\nwe end every episode of on purpose with\nthe final five okay these five questions\nhave to be answered in one word to one\nsentence maximum okay can be one\nsentence I will ask you to explore it\nfurther if if there's something that\nhits me all right so Mike these are your\nfinal five the first question is the\nfirst your ones have two parts I've\nnever done this before but with you I'm\nabout to do it because I think there's\nsome things I really want to know so the\nfirst question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever heard and the worst\nadvice you've ever heard best advice is\nuh if you're unsure about something take\na moment you know if you're unsure uh\ndon't don't don't answer right away take\na moment M think about it it's okay MH\nyou know don't answer just because you\nfeel like you got to be out and be quick\nand be fast about it you know uh cuz\nyou're end up stumbling over your words\nand and and and or or not stumbling over\nyour words saying something that you\ndon't really really mean so I would say\nthat's probably some of the best advice\nI got worst\nadvice buy it now you'll get it\nback just what just spend it now you\nyou'll make it back you know what I'm\nsaying I think I think that's I think\nthat's probably some of the worst\nsurprice I've got\nyeah I think at the time it was closed\nyeah at the time it was closed it was\nClos it was it was it was uh and I\nwasn't even really a big clothes guys at\nthe time I was like ah whatever but it\nwas like yeah you're right you I'll make\nit back don't worry about it yeah it's\ncool yeah of course I will you know like\nyeah and then and then you know we're on\n7-Eleven Diet for the next you know two\nmonths I love it good anwers good aners\nall right I'm going to give you a choice\nyeah get a pick pick one of these you\ngot to choose\nchoose whichever one yeah yeah all right\ntake look oh\nman I want to know what the other one is\nI'll let you talk about this one first\nthis one this is um how\nold dog it's my dad's dog tags from the\nMarines that linen jacket\nsays All My\nChildren I'm saying\nmaybe s 16 17 maybe like Disney like\nsuper soap weekend or something like\nthat I think it was like one of those\nthings where like the soap opers had\nthis this weekend in and at uh I think\nit was\nin California yeah yeah yeah Disney and\num I want to say this is from that is\nthat what advice would you what advice\nwould you give to\nhim uh Sav those moments of being a\nteenager I think you know looking back\nat the teenage years you\nknow we a have a worry we we what\nproblems we have you know it was high\nschool yeah complaining about homework\nyou know what I'm saying like it you\nknow I was I was working at that time\nyou know what I'm saying so but but I\nwould just say like enjoy those years\nman you know of just of just uh of the\nthe purity of it you know I looked back\nand I was like man this is like a this\nis this is a pretty pure innocent kid\nyeah what would he say back to you now\nlooking at you now maybe I know you\ncould do it you know I I think I would\ntell myself that you could do it too\nyeah I think I think you know nobody\nthought I I mean I didn't at that time\nyou know I think you know what what what\ncould have been what what is he had a\nyou know thought had an idea of what\ncould be be you know I had I always had\nthe optimism of what could be you know\nit just like it just follow that more\nmaybe I love that man this was the other\none a this is\ndope we got plenty we just picked these\ntwo these were the two that the team\nleft I don't know if this was my\nbirthday or my sister's birthday but\nthis is my grandmother's kitchen and uh\nmy sister was right there and I think\nshe was either helping me cut a cake or\nsomething but yeah that's my that's my\nmy I was that was my my my guardian that\nwas my my My Bodyguard was my sister\nit's a good one I love it I love it man\num all right question number I don't\nknow which question we want I totally\nignored my own format but it's all right\nthat's the best that's the that's when\nit's the best uh what's what's the best\npart of being Michael B Jordan and the\nworst part part of being Michael B\nJordan being Uncle\nMike man it's a feeling like with my\nnephew and my niece that I've never had\nI've never love something so much it\nlike wow like whoa like I think I think\nbeing Uncle Mike right now is is the is\nthe best part of that right now um worst\npart I love multitasking I love I love I\nlove uh the juggling the The Balancing\nAct of the things that I do I love that\nand the worst part is the the loneliness\nthat comes with that you know I think\nthere's a there's a there's a you know a\nloneliness that I have you know the the\nresponsibility that you have and is is\nis isolating and the weight is isolating\nso I think I think the worst part of\nthat is is is the the feeling like\nnobody really understands and and\nsometimes falling into the spaces of\nlike just you know being alone feeling\nalone thanks for sharing everything\ntoday I mean okay question number four\nwe're nearly that four and five question\nnumber four uh you talked about knowing\nyour team's love language this question\nis my team's love language okay okay how\ndoes being the sexiest man in life find\nlove from the girls of my team dedicated\nto dedicated to you so I revert back to\nthe last question it's very it's very\nlonely no it's uh I go back and forth\nbetween\nwanting\npartnership and then not\nknowing what's the best partner for me\nlike like bringing them into my world\nwhat I got going on isn't easy and it's\nit's not just I love you you love me\nthat should be enough right it's not\nit's not quite that simple you know I\nthink I think finding the right person\nto understand a all of me but then all\nthat comes with me as well and\nunderstanding you know that balance\nbetween wanting to be a available and\nthere for that person while I'm juggling\neverything else and feeling okay to put\nthe other part of my businesses down and\nyou know this sacrifice and compromise\nthat comes with a partnership and a\nrelationship and what is and and\nunderstanding\nhow how to make that all work is\nsometimes gives me anxiety and pause you\nknow and and and and then also there's a\npart of me that has not really lived\nlife yet m i I haven't really traveled\nas much for fun or just like Japan has\nbeen a few times that I've went where I\ndidn't have a schedule where I didn't\nhave to be somewhere for press I didn't\nhave to be these mult I had to put the\nother hats on you know uh there so many\ndifferent places and people I've never\nhad an opportunity to happily meet that\nI might connect and Vibe with that might\nbe a person that my soul connects to you\nknow um and and I think you know those\nthings I'm I'm looking forward to that\npart of my life you know I think the\nlast couple years I'm starting to get to\na place where it's like you know what I\ngot to start living yeah you know I've\nbeen I've been I've sacrificed and I've\nbeen in locked zoned in for so long it\nyou know I owe it to myself a little bit\nto do that you know um and I think\nthat's a a byproduct of being a little\nbit of a you know I'm a delayed\nsatisfaction delayed gratification\nperson like I can I've always wanted to\nlock in for the first half do what I got\nto do get to I need to get to make sure\neverything is straight and set up and\nthen be a little bit more have the\nfreedom to move how I want to move and\nor whatever so that's the long-winded\nanswer of uh of of a I'm not I'm not\nlooking but it would take a very special\nperson to understand and grow with me\nyou know just you know you want to\ncreate memories you know I want I want a\nfamily you know what I'm saying\neventually so we'll see what's up we'll\nsee what you are lucky cuz I asked you\nthat question the other question was\nwhat's his type\nso I like that I like that I I like that\nquestion I like that that one you like\nthat better no no I answer good good\nthat's the wrong question I thought I\nwas reading you I was like yeah like no\nI mean joking I don't know I I wasn't\nasking you for real I wasn't can move on\nfor that yeah I was with you uh Fifth\nand final question yeah uh if you could\nwe ask this to every guest who's ever\nbeen on the show if you could create one\nlaw that everyone in the world had to\nfollow o what would it be a law\nthat you couldn't intentionally kill or\ncause bodily harm oh to\nanyone I think that covers a lot of\nstuff I mean you still you gotta leave\nroom people for to humans to be humans\nand everybody's not going to be good you\nknow everybody's not going to have all\nthat in there but if we can eliminate\nthe senseless killing and you know the\nbodily harms you know of other people's\nbody IES in a real way I think there's\nbut then there's like the systemic thing\nI'm trying to get out of cuz like you\nknow I'm trying to I'm trying to level\nthe playing field yeah you know um so\njust the economic opportunities that the\ndisparity those those systematic\noppression the systematic oppression\nthat does exist is the thing that I I\nmost I most want to change so I'm trying\nto think of that's a good question man\nyou keep thinking about it\ncuz I I like your one cuz it also\napplies to like you couldn't develop\nproducts that like your your question I\nmean your answer applies to food drugs\nmedicine which is kind of what keeps a\nlot of people stuck in their system uhuh\ncuz if they can like bodily harm to me\nisn't just physical violence it's also\nthe kind of things we ingest and consume\nand that is what keeps a lot of people\nstuck because they're eating unhealthy\nfood CU that's all they have access to\nand that's all they can can afford and\nthat that plays with the E I mean that's\nwhat I was hearing too yeah on a sub\nlevel I don't yeah all right I with that\nI love it uh Michael be joining Mike it\nhas been such a joy and honor we got to\ndo a part two I've got I can talk to you\nfor hours I've got so many questions man\nlike that we could get into but I want\nto thank you for your honesty your\nopenness uh the fun we've had bringing\nmoss along everyone if you're not\ndrinking it already make sure you

my\ninterview with Kobe Bryant on how to be\nstrategic and obsessive to your purpose\nour children have become less\nimaginative about how to problem solve\nand parents and coaches have become more\ndirective in trying to tell them how to\nbehave versus teaching them how to\nbehave"
