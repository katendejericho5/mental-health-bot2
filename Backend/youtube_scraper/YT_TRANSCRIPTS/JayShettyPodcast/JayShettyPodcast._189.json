    "transcript": "truth I think vibrates at the highest\nfrequency and so if you want to\ninfluence somebody you have to be\nvibrating at a high frequency that's\ntelling someone the truth in the moment\nyou can tell the truth to somebody in a\nkind and gentle and generous way but\nwhen you don't address someone's\nBehavior that's toxic towards you you're\nnot operating in truth and what happens\nis you reduce your own vibrational\nfrequency and that can get worse so the\nway you rise above and shift the energy\nin the room is actually by operating in\ntruth with somebody saying look I love\nyou I believe in you and that's why I'm\ngoing to tell you the truth right now\nyeah and here's the truth this thing\nyou're doing right now this way you're\nhandling yourself is so much it's so\nbeneath who you really are you're\ncapable of so much greater and I want\nyou to know I love you and believe in\nyou enough that I'm going to share with\nyou the truth"
