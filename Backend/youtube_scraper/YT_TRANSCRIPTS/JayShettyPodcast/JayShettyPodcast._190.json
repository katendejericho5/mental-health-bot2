Subscribe\nbutton I love your support it's\nincredible to see all your comments and\nwe're just getting started I can't wait\nto go on this journey with you thank you\nso much for subscribing it means the\nworld to me the number one Health and\nWellness podcast J shett J shett the one\nthe only J shett\nEd you're so confident you're so strong\nyou're powerful but at the same time I\nknow that you are going for your own\nhealing Journey your own struggles your\nown challenges like what's what have you\nbeen working on inside wow what a great\nquestion thank you for that I have to\nsay I told you off camera I if I don't\nsay this I won't feel right you have the\nmost unique combination of confidence\nand humility about anybody I've ever met\nthose are the people I love the most I\nlove being around confident people but\nthey have these high doses of humility\nwhich keeps them\nhumble it it causes them to still want\nto learn and grow they don't think they\nknow everything those people last the\nlongest in business and in any Endeavor\nsame time if somebody doesn't have a lot\nof confidence you're feel like you're\ncarrying those folks your friends\nthrough life all the time so in my case\nyou know I grew up as a son of an\nalcoholic and I think to some extent\nthere's these this wiring that happens\nwhen you're a child and so some of the\nwiring I've recently discovered I had\nBert Cher the comedian on my podcast and\nit sort of came out of me when he was\nthere Bert's a very well-known drinker\nand it's almost a joke about how much\nthat he drinks and we I asked him I said\nBert what kind of a husband or father do\nyou think you are and he said I think\nI'm a 10 out of 10 and I think he is and\nI told him I said you know I just\ndiscovered something about myself\nbrother and it was that my dad's\ndrinking it wasn't just that I was\nworried you know is he going to get in a\nfight is he going to be mean or Mom and\nDad going to a disagreement I said what\nhappened was I worried about my dad is\nhe going to come home tonight is he safe\nis he in danger and that wired into me\nas a little boy the neurology the\npattern of worry and fear and so as I've\ngotten to be an older grown man I've\nuncovered that the last year or two I\nhave a pattern where I have a tendency\nmy emotional home so to speak as I go\nback to worry and fear and I don't want\nto I don't want to live that way and so\nI've been working on unwiring that\nthat's the thing I've been working most\non my healing journey is you know it's\nokay everything's going to be okay I'm\nblessed I'm favored and it's undoing\nthat wiring of worry and fear because we\nall have an emotional home we all have\nthree or four emotions that no matter\nwhat happens in a given week or month\nwe're going to get it so if your\nemotional home is anger or worry or fear\nfrustration no matter what the external\nconditions are you're going to find a\nway to get your hit of it because it's\nyour home conversely if your emotional\nhome is peace or Equanimity or Bliss or\necstasy passion Focus you'll find a way\non a regular basis to get that emotion\nthat you're familiar with because our\nwe're wired for it in our bodies and in\nour minds to be familiar with those\nemotions so I just chose what are the\nemotions I want do I want to live in\nworry and fear even though my external\nlife is so great I still have a tendency\nto worry and live fearfully or do how do\nI want to live I want to live in peace I\nwant some equinity I want Bliss in my\nlife and so I've been rewiring that and\nit's something I've been really really\nexcited about and proud of that I've\ndone that work at you know at 50 years\nold 52 now it's been happening oh wow\nI'm so glad I asked that question\nalready I'm like because I think you're\nso right I think everyone who's\nlistening will be able to relate to what\ntheir wiring is correct from childhood\nwhere do we go what's our emotional home\nas you just called it correct where do\nwe disappear to and it's really\ninteresting because I always talk about\nmy childhood similarly being quite\nchaotic and quite intense but my\nmother's love was like this protective\nshield you've told me that that really\nhelped me and now when I'm listening to\nyou I'm actually thinking what I want\nand I think what we're both trying to\ndevelop is peace in the storm amen it's\nequinity in the IM balance that's\ncorrect and in my case not to create the\nstorm all the time so so no but in all\nhonesty a few things I discovered a few\nyears ago I used to brag a lot I am\nunbelievable under stress I operate\namazingly under chaos which is true\nbecause I'm so familiar with it but what\nI found out about myself was to some\nextent I created a lot of it in other\nwords I wasn't comfortable in my life\nmaybe people can relate to this if they\nreally take a look at themselves I\nwasn't comfortable when things weren't a\nlittle bit chaotic because in life we\nmove towards really what we're most\nfamiliar with we keep moving back to the\nfamiliar that's why some people will\ndate the completely same person in a\ndifferent body you and I have talked\nabout with your amazing work right\nbecause we move towards what we're\nfamiliar with so I had a tendency in my\nlife to create a lot of stress and Chaos\nbecause I operated so well in it it was\na familiar state to be in even though it\ndidn't serve me and so a lot of that\nwork I've done in healing and digging\ndeep in my life it served me not just in\nhealing it's made me a better\nbusinessman it's made me a better father\nin often cases a better friend because\nI'm not constantly creating this stress\nand Chaos around the people that I love\nthe most yeah how do you stop creating\nstress and drama well one is why do we\ndo it and how do we we do it because\nwe're familiar and we wire these things\nin our bodies and so this is really\ntechnical stuff but I anchor the good\nStates and so what happened was is that\nusually where wiring happens is in a\nhighly emotional state we anchor it in\nour bodies physically that's what we do\nand so the way out of that is to begin\nto Anchor the great States so I take\nadvantage of great States so for example\njust a few weeks ago my daughter was\nhome from college and we took a walk on\nthe beach and it was just this Blissful\nexperience it was me and the you know\none of the people I love the most in the\nworld and I'm feeling this great peace\nand love from my daughters were walking\nand I anchored it I literally anchored\nit in my body I literally snapped my\nfingers as I went and I anchored that\nstate and so or when I'm walking on\nstage I'm about to you know have to\nspeak and that that adrenaline hits me\nand that Euphoria the spirit the energy\nhits me I'll anchor that state\nphysically and so what happens is I'm\nrewiring myself physically for example\nlike I pray on my knees every night and\nso I've been doing that for a number of\nyears I feel great peace when I pray\nwhat's ironic about it is not only is\nthe prayer now peaceful but the actual\nphysical move of getting on my knees\ntriggers that state so this is a very\ndetailed answer but I've rewired the\ndetail we want the detail okay so I've\nrewired so everybody you when you're in\nthat Blissful State anyone's ever heard\na song from your from a different time\nand it just triggers a state it's not\nthe words and the music it's what was\ngoing on in that moment you've anchored\nit in your body so when I'm in a good\nState a great state I take advantage of\nit I don't let it pass I anchor it in my\nbody and I sort of rewired myself so\nthat when these ones that I don't want\ncome along I have a neurology I can\nchange out of that move and do something\nphysical and it's simple it's not\ncomplicated could be tugging your ear\nfeeling something on your shirt\nsomething you do on your knees so I've\ncreated like triggers in my life to put\nme back in that state and over time\nthat's become my wiring now not the old\none this is more familiar to me than the\nold old one tendency now is to move\ntowards the familiar state of bliss of\nJoy I'd say 75 80% of the time now\nthat's where I live whereas before 95%\nof the time I live the other way I love\nthat advice and and please be as\nTechnical and as detailed as you like\nbecause you sparked so much for me I was\nthinking that actually the truth is\neveryone already has subconscious\nanchors that we're not choosing and so\nan example is when I'm working with a\nclient often they'll say to me the\nmoment their head hits the pillow yes\nall of their anxiety goes crazy what is\nthat it's an anchored State it's\nactually your head hitting the pillow\nexactly that motion is creating a sense\nof breathlessness maybe tight chested\nmental anxiety and until you retrain\nthat act of I'm going to let my head hit\nthe pillow I'm going to experience peace\nmaybe I'm going to play a sound maybe\nI'm going to feel a certain temperature\nmaybe I need to do some breath work like\nuntil you reang to that St like you're\nsaying your head hitting the pillow will\nnever change no matter what you do no\nmatter what you do the external as long\nas the external conditions of your life\ncontinually dictate how you feel you're\nan out-of-control human being so at some\npoint you have to do things internally\nthat change how you feel because the\nquality of our life you know this is the\nquality of our emotions that's the\ncaliber of our life so I remember a long\ntime ago I'll tell you a quick Story\nplease I uh I was I had not made a money\nfor a long time as a businessman I\nfinally make some money finally right\nbut my emotional home was fear and by\nthe way the other side often times of\nFear Can manifest itself as anger it\nshows up as anger but when you see an\nangry person you're seeing a scared\nperson and so I was a worrier and a\nfearful person anyway I was building my\nfirst dream home and on the way over\nthere an appointment had cancelled or\nsomething and I was du and then the\ncontractor had messed something up we've\nall had that moment and I walk into this\nMansion I'm building and I'm mad and I'm\nstressed and I'm angry and oh where's\nthe contractor and I look into the\nkitchen and there's five men there five\nor six men in there all men had come\nfrom Mexico and these men had left their\nfamilies and the reason they had come\nthere was to send money home to their\nfamilies and work and they're in there\nand they were doing work they loved that\nthey were great at working on my mansion\nand I watched them for a minute I stood\nand watched them and they had their\nmariachi music playing and they were\nlaughing and joking and Blissful and\nalso doing work they cared about that\nmattered that they were great at and in\nthat moment I stepped back and I almost\nout of my body I went if life is the\nquality of your emotions they're kicking\nmy tail they're winning at life and I'm\nlosing I have all these things to be\ngrateful for around me but my home that\nI keep going back to is fear anger and\nworry these guys who had to leave their\nfamilies to come to another country just\nto support them imagine how difficult\ntheir life was there they had to leave\ntheir country and their children to come\nhere to work to support their\nfamilies and they're joyous and Blissful\nand doing work that matters to them and\nthat they're great at and so I decided\nit's not you don't want the Mansion you\nwant how you think it'll make you feel\nyou don't want the relationship you want\nhow you think it'll make you feel you\ndon't want to be fit and sexy and jacked\nyou want how you think it'll make you\nfeel so what if I could get the emotions\nif I could have these emotions maybe\ngetting the things I want would be that\nmuch easier and so I focus now everyone\nhas goals of their physical things they\nwant but for me a lot of my outcomes now\nare emotionally driven because I think\nif I'm in the right emotional state I\ncan produce the physical things I want\nyeah you make better decisions you're\nmore clear your vision makes sense I\ncompletely agree with you it's like and\nand I think a lot of us feel like the\nmore we do the more we take on the more\namount of things we do the the more\nlikely we're going to be successful and\nI wanted to talk to you about this in\nterms of your schedule because I know\nthat that's like you and I have talked\nabout this thing yeah like walk me\nthrough your schedule what does it look\nlike right now it's busy but I have\nlearned you and I just were talking\nabout this I've learned to say no and\nI've learned this is just recent I am a\npeople pleaser and so a lot of times\nbecause I am you know have a deep voice\nand maybe I look a particular way you\nwouldn't know that inside as this person\nI just want to please people and make\nthem happy because of my childhood if my\ndad was in a good mood maybe he wouldn't\ndrink that day if I brought home an A on\nmy report card then he'd show me love so\nI've I conflated in my life brother love\nwith significance and I thought when I\nwould do something significant it felt\nlike love but they're two different\nthings most people are that way as well\nif I can just perform if I can just do\nsomething people will love me so I've\nchanged that and in my schedule so I I\nhave learned to do things that I love\nthat make me feel good that contribute\nmy schedule's busy though I mean I'm up\nvery early in the morning most mornings\nI've got a routine that I do I travel\nquite a bit just like you do but what\nI've really learned to do is to choose\nthings in my life that both are\nproductive but that also give me a sense\nof contribution and joy not just\nproductive anymore so I've said no to\nthings recently there's a TV show that\nI'm doing right now another one came up\nand I've always really wanted to do this\nparticular show it doesn't serve my\ncurrent dream so what I do is I check in\nand I ask myself I audit is that still\nmy dream is that still what I want\nthere's this great clip on social media\ngoing around right now with Jim Carrey I\ndon't know if you've seen this but I've\nwatched it and I've sent it to so many\nof our friends I thought I sent it to\nyou maybe I didn't and he says something\nin this clip I'll paraphrase it I'll\nmess it up but he basically says in this\nclip he saysi going to say something\nyou've never heard an actor say before\nand the interview say what's that and\nCarrie says I've had enough I've done\nenough I've made enough movies I've had\nenough success I've won enough Awards\nand now I want to just do things that\nbring me peace and joy that's a\ncourageous choice in life and so what he\ndid is he audited is this still my dream\nand I think a lot of times in life we\njust have this dream that was given to\nus by our parents or our friends or\nthere's an expectation and we're chasing\na dream that was maybe never ours or no\nlonger is and so now I really audit that\nI out it the fact of whether or not this\nis something that is still my dream is\nit consistent with where I want to go\nnow so but I'm busy you know I'm 12 14\nhours a day so my physiology matters my\nhydration matters my juny water matters\nall these things matter to me in my life\nso that I'm feeding my soul and my\nspirit so that I am my best when I come\ndo a a show like this today if anyone\ndoesn't know Ed was just on stage with\nour good friend Brendan bashard in La\ncame straight into the studio right and\nand you always this energy like you have\nthe ability I think I talk a lot about\nthe difference between time management\nand energy management and you're someone\nthat whenever I'm with you you're always\nhighly energetic you're always you know\nthere's that I feel that I feel your\nspirit coming through your self well I'm\nconscious Jade like you are I'm\nconscious of something I think most\npeople are oblivious to and here's what\nit is you are always making people feel\nsomething most people aren't aware of\nthis no matter what you're making them\nfeel something it could be they could\nfeel important and needed and loved they\ncould feel slighted and invisible they\ncould feel that you're demeaning to them\nbut you're making them feel something so\nI try to really focus on my intentions\nwhen I met Wayne Dyer when I was very\nyoung at that time he was writing a book\nwhat a beautiful man meet him I've only\nread you special well I got to tell you\nyou remind me a lot of Wayne a lot I me\nand that and and he was a dear dear\nfriend just your spirit is very\nsimilar and uh and I don't know a lot of\npeople that remind me of Wayne but you\ndo and he was so good to me but when I\nmet him it's a funny story it it's a\nlong time ago but I was I had luckily I\nwork out so I'd won my first trip ever\nto Hawaii with the company I was at and\nI got up in the morning before the sun\nwas up cuz that's my routine beat the\nSun up and I I ran on the beach and as\nI'm running this man's coming towards me\nI can see him bald guy sweaty hairy back\nI'm like I don't want to bump into this\nguy and as he gets closer I go oh my\ngosh that's Wayne Dy it was in Maui and\nhe gets past me we're both wearing Sony\nWalkman that's how old we both are and I\npull my Walkman I one of those too when\nI a kid you're dating yourself now and I\ngo Dr Dyer you changed my life and don't\nyou love when someone says that to you\nto this day I remember saying that to\nhim and he takes his head he had a deep\nvoice like me takes his headphones off\nrunning and he goes I highly doubt that\nhe goes I bet you changed your life but\nhow did I help you and he stops the Run\nJay and he walks walks over to me and I\nend up sitting on the beach for an hour\nand a half watching the sun come up with\nWayne Dyer and at the end of the\nconversation he says to me he says Ed I\nthink you're going to change the world\nknow at that time I thought I was\nprobably the only person he ever said\nthat to in hindsight he probably said\nthat to a bun of you but and he said and\nit's not because of your amazing brain\nor your you have a unique ability to\ncommunicate Ed but that's not why he\nsaid uh you're a good\nman listen to this what he said bro he\ngoes you're a good man he goes you have\ngreat intentions and he goes if we never\ntalk again and we ended up talking the\nrest of his life he said I want you to\nalways link your confidence to your\nintentions not your abilities because\nyou'll be chasing that tail all your\nlife head so if he goes there's a COR he\nwas writing a book at the time called\nThe Power of intention but I didn't know\nthat when I look for confidence like\nbefore this interview or that speech I\njust gave or for anybody listening\nthey're going into a sales call or a\nmeeting or a first date your confidence\nisn't your beauty or your ability it's\nyour intent and so I always that's one\nthing I know to be true about me I don't\nalways believe in my ability or my\ntalent that's fleeting or what happens\nwhen a a speech goes bad or a meeting\ngoes bad or a company goes bad I don't\nwant to predicate my confidence on that\nI predicate it on my intentions and I'll\nremind myself because I actually believe\nI'm a good person and I don't think\nenough people give themselves credit for\nbeing good and kind and that they give\npeople Grace and they want to contribute\nand help you should generate so much\nconfidence from that intent to serve\nthat you ought to walk into a room and\nown it not because you're arrogant or\nyou're amazing but because your\nintentions are so good so this a shell\nof confidence a hack to confidence\nnobody talks about is intention and I\nlearned that most from Wayne and so it's\nwhy I can bring an energy to something\nbecause I'm pretty confident and that\nconfident isn't I'm going to say\nsomething amazing it's that my intent is\nto serve and so you vibrate at a high\nfrequency yeah this is why we get along\nthis is I can relate completely I've\nalways said whenever anyone asks me what\nmy morning routine is M the number one\npart of my morning routine apart from\nthe meditation workout all that stuff is\nrefining and purifying my intention wow\nI've always said that because I feel\nlike your intention can either be a seed\nor a weed wow and a seed is growing and\na weed when it starts to grow it looks\nthe same thing as a seed very good but\nmy teachers would always tell us that\nlike a weed will\nstrangle the seed like a weed will\ncompletely destroy a great plant because\nof its intention what do you do I'm\ncurious that's so good that is really\ngood what do you do with the weeds in\nyour life when they begin to grow around\nyou is you have a strategy for that yeah\nI find that there's almost a mental\nplucking and extraction process and it\nstarts with an awareness of why am I\nmaking this decision or what is driving\nme towards this and if the intention is\nnot love service Joy\ngrowth then chances are if it's ego\nRevenge jealousy Envy greed if it's all\nthose I know those are weeds but that\nrequires me to sit still and sit quietly\nin order to really be honest with myself\nwhen it's uncomfortable to say oh Jay\nyou're just doing that because you're\nenvious and being able to say that to\nmyself and not hate myself for that but\nto realize it's just a weed in a garden\nif you see a weed in your garden and you\nstart hating the whole garden that\ndoesn't make any sense you just go and\npluck that weed out and so I feel for me\nit requires that awareness that\nStillness and then extraction that's\nreally good and it's and and I think\nthat's partly what probably why I think\nwe get along so well because of that\nintention but I want to ask you how do\nyou good develop and build and help\npeople choose an intention that lives\noff the page because I think we're all\nused to now like my intention today is\nright but that's not what we're talking\nabout how does your intention come off\nthe page and come into your day question\nI tell them all you validate your\nintention with your action so I like to\nI call it validating it and so I like to\ngive myself evidence that it's true I'll\ngive you an example one of the things\nright now that I'm really working on in\nmy life and it's not easy for me because\nI've lived another way I love to just\nshare the things that are negative about\nme because I think it gives people hope\nif this guy as screwed up as he is can\nwin maybe I got some hope and one of the\nthings that I've lived with a lot in my\nlife is I think I have judged people too\nmuch and not extended Grace and but the\nlast 10 years of my life man I'm really\nproud of myself I've extended Grace to\npeople I feel better about me brother\nwhen I extend Grace to another person I\njust I just feel good about me\nparticularly maybe when they don't\ndeserve it in the moment give you an\nexample give you a quick Story please\nthe stories are great keep them coming I\nlove it about three weeks ago my kids\nwere home for the holidays and uh so we\nwere at dinner and this is treasured\ntime with my kids cuz they're both away\nat college and so we walk into a\nrestaurant great restaurant not like an\namazing place but a good restaurant we\nwalk in and from the lobby I can hear\nthese kids screaming and I'm an\nintrovert so I like quiet meals I like\nto actually be able to hear the people\nI'm talking with I like quiet\nrestaurants this was normally a very\nquiet place is why I picked it this\nnight it was not quiet in there and I\ncan hear these children screaming and\nyou know when you're a parent like I am\nsometimes you're like what is why don't\nyou I would never let my kids act like\nthat there's easy to judge and I didn't\nso anyway we walk into this restaurant\nand guess who we sit next to the table I\ncould hear from the lobby there's five\nkids at this table with two parents and\nthe kids are yelling and screaming and\none of them's running a circle there one\nof them threw some food and the mother\nhad kind of had her head down the whole\ntime and she really the my tendency\nwould be to judge that family this is an\nextreme story but it gives you an\nexample of why I work on the validating\nso it's good enough to say my intention\nis to give people Grace but I need to\nvalidate it Y and so my kids were kind\nof looking at me because they know their\ndad you know and I went um I'm going to\nextend Grace to that family right now\nand I actually told my family I said you\nguys okay it's going to sound crazy can\nwe just say a quick prayer for them over\nthere they were like very close to us\nand the rest of the restaurant I noticed\nthem too and so I said let's say a quick\nprayer and they go Max say the prayer I\nsay it to my son so my son says a quick\nblessing for that family and my daughter\nsays daddy let's buy them dinner I'm\nlike now you're pushing me but okay but\nokay we'll get their dinner too but\nwe're not going to tell them anyway so\nwe extended Grace and the entire meal\nthey were noisy and chaotic anyway the\nend of the meal they left before we did\nand um so they left and it got very\nquiet in there and like ah but the whole\ntime I had extended Grace I didn't judge\nthem which would be a tendency I would\nnormally maybe do in my past but now I'm\nvalidating this new intention of mine\nanyway we pay the bill and we leave and\ntwo days later I'm hitting a couple golf\nballs at the golf course and the server\nthat night was hitting Balls next to me\nand he said oh Mr milet that was so kind\nof you to buy the meal for that night\nfor that family in light of the\nfuneral and I said what\nhe goes that family that night he goes\nyou know they had they had come there to\ncelebrate they had just left the funeral\nof their\ngrandmother I said you're kidding me and\nhe said no and the grandmother would\ncome in here with them they're a very\nclose family the kids don't normally\nbehave like that the mother that night\nwas so down it's her mom the kids are\nextra close to her because their husband\nwhen he was deployed in Iraq the\ngrandmother lived with them and sort of\nraised them and so they had just left\nthe funeral that night and were having\nthe dinner and I went there you go you\nnever know what someone's carrying you\ndon't know the burden they're carrying\nit hurt people hurt people people in\npain typically will create pain for\nother people and I was like what a\nblessing that I've got to this point in\nmy life that I do extend grace even when\nit doesn't seem like somebody deserves\nit because you don't know what they're\ncarrying so I validated that intention\nwith my behavior and thank God I did not\nknowing what they were going through so\nit's a really beautiful culmination of\nthe story that you just don't know what\nsomeone's carrying except send Grace\ngive people kindness do everything you\ncan not to judge yeah wow that's\npowerful man that's St yeah that's crazy\nbut it's and sometimes we don't always\nget the reward of that Loop true but we\nhave to recognize as we know in our own\nlives that we know we're always going\nthrough something we know our friends\nare going through something our family's\ngoing through something everyone on your\nteam is going through something how we\ncan't extend that is is crazy but I\nwanted to ask you something there's a\nlot of people who I know will be\nlistening and I know that our community\nand our audience are good-hearted\nloving wanting to be better people we\nall want to improve as as do I I've got\nso much more healing left to do and I\nknow our community does but they often\nfeel like even though they lead with\nlove everyone around them is causing\nthem pain is negative is toxic they\ndon't feel that around them and they\nalmost get exhausted trying to to be\nthis bigger graceful Kinder person yeah\nand I'm sure you felt that I know you're\nthe right person to ask this question to\nwhat do you do when you feel everyone\naround you is bringing you toxicity\nnegativity and poor energy MH how do you\noperate I reduce proximity to them in\nthose moments and sometimes they they\nare the weeds that needed to be weeded\nout of your garden that's the most\ndifficult decision but sometimes it's\nnot weeding them out it's reducing\nproximity and then I've created some\nHavens that I can go to to sort of\nEscape that for a few minutes and so\nsome of those are actually people I've\ngot two or three people in my life that\nwhen these other people are losing it\nand act acting in a toxic way or acting\nout or antagonistic towards me or other\npeople I've got another person or two\nthat I can go to that shifts my state\nthat is my rock that is someone that I\ncan express myself to for some people\nthat might be therapy but in my case\nI've got two or three just great friends\nthat I can go to they set me straight\nthey give me um they give me perspective\nyes what great friends give me is they\ngive me perspective this will pass\nthey're going through something Rise\nAbove This and see when some people walk\ninto a room they adapt to the energy in\nthe room greatness is walking into a\nroom and Shifting the energy and so I\nhave I believe I'm built for those\nmoments that over time I'm built to\nshift the energy in the room shift it\nand the way that you do it is to me it's\njust really speaking truth to people and\nsometimes in a kind way speaking truth\nto them about their behavior and their\nconduct and letting them know that\nyou're better than this you are better\nthan the way you're conducting yourself\nyou're better than this and here's why I\ndo that truth I think vibrates at the\nhighest frequency and so if you want to\ninfluence somebody you have to be\nvibrating at a high frequency that's\ntelling someone the truth in the moment\nyou can tell the truth to somebody in a\nkind and gentle and generous way but\nwhen you don't address someone's\nBehavior that's toxic towards you you're\nnot operating in truth and what happens\nis you reduce your own vibrational\nfrequency and that can get worse so the\nway you rise above and shift the energy\nin the room is actually by operating in\ntruth with somebody saying look I love\nyou I believe in you and that's why I'm\ngoing to tell you the truth right now\nyeah and here's the truth this thing\nyou're doing right now this way you're\nhandling yourself is so much it's so\nbeneath who you really are you're\ncapable of so much greater and I want\nyou to know I love you and believe in\nyou enough that I'm going to share with\nyou the truth and by the way there comes\nthese intentions too if someone if\nyou've sewn enough seeds into someone\nthey know your intention I think you can\nchallenge people I think great people\nare good at challenging other people and\nthe only way that you can challenge\nsomebody is they have to know you love\nand believe in them first like even in\nyour companies you're just listen Jay's\nlife is just exploding right everything\nabout that he's got going so a lot of\npeople depend on you a lot of people\nwork with you and you've got to be able\nto challenge them to to raise their\nstandard you can't do that first you\nhave to make deposits into people before\nyou can make withdraw\nbecause anytime you're challenging\nsomeone saying I need you to step up\nthat's a form of a withdrawal it just is\nyou have to have made the deposits in\nsomeone of belief and love first and\nthen if you operate in truth man your\nfrequency is vibrating real high you can\nshift an environment and shift the\nenergy oh I love that I love that I love\nthat and it's and and it's not a\ntechnique it's it's real like it's not\nlike I always find like it's not like\nyou're being nice to someone so you can\nask for something back and that's where\nyou the way you're saying it it doesn't\ncome that way and I I love that idea of\nraising and shifting frequency and I\nactually want to give more people the\nencouragement and courage to be able to\ndo that because I think we all do feel I\ncan't shift it I can't do anything I'm\nnot in control my reminder would be um\ntruth is what shifts the room and when\nyou come from a loving place in a\ntruth-telling place here's the other\nthing I said this to you one other time\nI don't know if it was on the show or\nnot but I think a lot of people feel\ninadequate about that like I'm not\nqualified I'm not what there's 's\nnothing great about me like I've never\nI've not achieved something or or the\nother thing they do is they hold their\nsins or mistakes of their life as like\nweapons against themselves like you\ndon't know about my divorce you don't\nknow that I did this thing I'm not proud\nof you don't know I had this business\nfailure I didn't I you know I've gained\nsome weight and so I I made a commitment\nto get fit and I'm not anymore I'm not\nqualified to shift the energy or change\nother people and one of the best\nexamples of that ever I've shared this\nwith you before is my dad when my dad\ngot sober it changed our entire family's\nlife I mean it just changed everything\nthat one decision my dad made and after\nI wrote my book and after my dad passed\naway I woke up one night it's like 3:00\na.m. and I was\ncrying and kind of startled my wife and\nshe's like what's going on babe I said\nbabe I just realized something here I am\n52 years old my dad had been sober for\n35 years that's never dawned on me I\nwent someone helped my dad I've told you\nthis before and I she goes what honey I\nsaid someone helped dad and that person\nchanged my entire life like that act of\nhelping one person the ripple effect is\nI'm his son and I've been blessed to\nreach millions of people around the\nworld that person doesn't know that\nhelping my dad changed millions of lives\nand and she goes my gosh that's\nincredible I said that's not the most\nincredible thing the most incredible\nthing is what qualified that man to help\nmy dad who I didn't know who he was at\nthe time she goes I don't know I said\nnot how perfect he was not how\nstupendous not his amazing achievements\nwhat qualified him to help my dad was\nthat he was also an alcoholic at one\ntime he was a drug addict he lied he\nlived in the shadows and so actually in\nlife we're most qualified to help the\nperson we used to be oh yes and so in\nlife it's not that you're better than\nthese people it's that you can help\npeople that used to be like you that you\nused to operate in a way that didn't\nserve you maybe you behaved in a way\nthat wasn't conducive with your\ncharacter because of that you're\nqualified to help people people that are\noperating that way so you're immensely\nqualified in life to shift other people\nif you're willing to be vulnerable and\nReveal Your imperfect you don't connect\nwith anybody be going I'm amazing like\nimagine the podcast say like brother be\nhonest with you I have no problems\nthere's no healing left I'm just kicking\nbutt everywhere I go you're like well me\ntoo man we're just twinging the globe in\nDubai together you know that's not the\ntruth the truth is the way you connect\nis by going here's all the things that\nAR just well we did in that cont we did\nin the car with each other right so like\nthat you're revealing your imperfections\nthat connects you with people yeah and\njust for everybody to remember you were\nborn to do something great with your\nlife and when you were a little boy or a\nlittle girl there was probably one\nperson who made you feel that way and\nyou ought to give yourself the gifts\nright now of who is that person when\nyou're a little girl or a little boy\nthey made you feel special and there's\nprobably only one maybe two maybe it was\nyour parents or your grandmother or\ngrandfather a coach a a religious figure\nthere's someone that was in your life\nand that you felt something about you\nbecause of the way they looked at at you\nor spoke to you and the amazing thing\nabout that is they were right about you\nthey were right for me it was my papa my\ndad's dad I'm named after him and used\nto drive and pick me up on Sundays we'd\ngo get donuts Jay to get for my cousins\nbefore church and he'd drive me I'd look\nup at Big Papa everyone when you think\nabout that person you'll get emotional\nfor you it's your mom right and he would\nlook down at me and he'd go Eddie you're\nmy favorite he had all gr go you're my\nfavorite you're amazing you're going to\ndo something great with your life you're\nthe special I go I am big papa I am and\nthis little boy I just could feel his\nbelief and his love he was the only\nperson who ever treated me that way the\nrest of the world's never treated me\nthat way but big papa did and then when\nother grandkids were born I remember my\ncousin Peter was born Jay you'll laugh\nat this and he called me goes hey your\ncousin Peter was born today he's amazing\nsix pound s ounces he's got our blue\neyes Eddie I go that's awesome big p and\nhe go but you're my favorite you're my\nfavorite and all my life I've carried\nthat feeling from Big Papa with me yeah\nand the truth is if you've had that\nperson in your life they were right\nabout you you're supposed to do\nsomething great with your life and the\nreason it makes you emotional when you\nthink about it now is because it's true\nand Truth vibrates at the highest\nfrequency so if you're listening to this\nor watching it like have that reminder\ngive yourself the gift maybe your Big\nPapa's gone now and not even anymore\nhonor them with who you become honor\nthem with the life you build honor them\nwith the choices you make and take that\nbelief imagine what God believes in you\nif that person believed in you take that\nbelief and use it as fuel in your life\nto have some strength and confidence to\nshift other people's lives and that for\nme that was big papa yeah I know you've\nyou I was going back with you when you\nwere saying it and there's something\nknown as a loving kindness meditation\nit's very popular in Buddhism\nin Hinduism there's a similar practice\nand I led this meditation when I was on\ntour with every audience across the\nwhole world and what you have to do in\nthis meditation is you have to close\nyour eyes and you have to allow yourself\nto re-experience a moment you felt the\nmost love for some people it's their\nwedding day for some people it's their\ncar with their grandpa for some person\nit's their mother whatever it may be and\nyou have to relive it feel it through\nthe five things you can see the four\nthings you can touch the three things\nyou can hear the two things you can\nsmell and the one thing you can taste\nreally immerse yourself in it and then\nfeel it in your heart and then feel it\nCascade from your heart all across your\nbody and then if you try and give it out\nto your friends and family to the\nstranger at the restaurant wow to the\nrest of the world it's so possible\nbecause you're feeling as you're saying\nthat will never run out amen your memory\nof your grandpa saying that to you that\nwill never ever expire wow it will\nalways be there and the amount that can\nbe recycled into giving love to others\ninto feeling loved always whereas what\nwe do is we try and search for the next\nperson to love us you're right we're\nsearching for that next person to say\nsomething amazing about us and with that\nyou're always running out you're right\nbecause it comes once and it goes and it\ncomes and it goes whereas that one\nperson you're so right that loved you\nJay this is an alltime great\nconversation right now by the way it's\ncuz we just went deep we did went deep I\nthink there's a validity to what you\njust said too a truth that's just so\nprofound it's very difficult in life to\ntransfer to somebody that which you're\nnot experiencing so in order to transfer\ntrue love and true belief in somebody\nyou have to be experiencing it so that\nyou can give it to somebody and so\ngiving yourself that gift allows you to\ngive it in abundance to other people\nthat's really good that was that's\nawesome meditation I think one of the\nreasons again why we get along but why\nwe're having this ation is that we both\nbelieve in this Paradox so we both\ntalking about currently at the beginning\nof this conversation have talked about\nvery like spiritual emotional Universal\nideas of existence but at the same time\nwe're both good at getting stuff done\nyeah just yes not all philosophy correct\nand I think that's something that I've\nalways tried to do in my work where it's\nlike I don't want anyone in the world to\njust think that oh if I change my\nmindset everything's just because I\ndon't want to fool people and I don't\nwant to mislead people because I know in\nmy life that spirituality and strategy\nhave had to go together that sincerity\nand structure have had to go together\nand I find that that combination is\nwhat's allowed me to live a fulfilling\nand successful life and continue to\ncreate it you haven't made a decision\nunless you've taken an action to\nvalidate it yes exactly that's and\nthat's the thing that you're exactly\nright people that come to our events or\nmay just hear this conversation go oh I\njust really need to sit around and\nreally vibrate high and think about\nthings no you don't you have to put your\nfeet on the ground and you've got to go\nto work and you've got to the real truth\nis if you've made a decision and it's\nreal you'll validate it with your work\nyou'll validate it with your effort and\nthe choices that you make and the truth\nis this like here's the other thing a\nlot of my confidence comes from I be\ncandid with you and I know this about\nyou I'm going to outwork you here's the\ntruth I'm going to outwork you the one\nthing I learned from my dad is that\nlisten a lot of my confidence comes from\nthe fact that I deserve to win and I\ndeserve to win because I'm working my\ntail off and I don't think enough people\ngive themselves the gift of just super\nhard work I mean I know your schedule\nyou know mine we were talking about that\nbut the truth I I've just this is just\nsomething I'm saying if I don't validate\nwith an action it's like you said with\nwith your books like I love you no\nthat's a verb there's an action that's\ntaken to validate that I love you\nthere's things I can do to give evidence\nof the fact that I love you and so no\nyou can't just sit around and think\nabout these things you've got to get to\nwork you've got to implement them and\nthen by the way when you do that all\nlisten the reason I can speak with such\nClarity on this stuff is I've done them\nI've been in situations where this stuff\nhas been tested and tried and true so\nI'm a huge huge advocate of work of\ntaking the steps necessary to do it and\nI know that that's something with you\nlike when I met you I had a notion about\nyou that wasn't accurate which was that\nyou were more of just this listen we're\njust going to get quiet and meditate and\nempty our minds here and everything we\nwant's going to come our way then I met\nyou and I said this to you off camera\nthere's a fire and an intensity and a\nwork ethic to Jay\nthat I think would surprise most people\nyou're this very\nunique combination of this very tranquil\npeaceful loving kind being who's also\nwound tight and wants to win and is\nintense and is going to make things\nhappen and wants to max out his life and\nisn't just sitting around waiting for it\nto come his way he's going to get a lot\nof it and that's one of the things I\nadmire about you absolutely walk me\nthrough how you've translated that Grace\nthat love that kindness into a plan for\nfor like 2024 like how do you translate\nthat like what does your day look like\nwhat does a quarter look like you've\nbuilt businesses that are successful I\nwant to know that part because I love\nthat that connection that I'm trying to\nmake here between this sincere heart but\nthis strategic mind it is my perception\nof time and so I have um I believe you\ncan bend and manipulate time and and so\nhere's what that looks like I don't buy\ninto a 24-hour day that's an archaic\ntime frame\nsee you and I live in an age where think\nabout it 100 years ago if I wanted to\nget something done I'd have to write it\ndown somewhere stick a stamp on it or\nput it on the back of a horse a few\nhundred years ago and you'd get it in a\nmonth and then you'd translate to get it\nback to me in a month now I can text you\nin 3 seconds but we're both going to\nmanage time in 24 hours when I was in\nschool I had to go to a library to\nresearch something in in a thing called\nan\nencyclopedia right and then write it all\ndown type it on a typewriter if you make\none key mistake you got to redo it now I\ncan Google it print it out and it's done\nyet the same time frames are managed and\nso that's insane right I can email I can\ntext I've have got all these things on\nmy phone so we're still operating the\nsame time construct as people did 50\nyears ago 100 years ago 200 years ago\nthat is insane so I have a huge\nadvantage in my life that my days are\nmanyi days and so I have 38 hour of days\nin a day I get 21 days in a week 21 days\nin a week and so my first day is 6:00\na.m.\nto noon and in that day we've all had\nthat day where we go man I've got more\nby 8: a.m. done than I've done in a week\nthat should be every day if you want it\nto be it's your expectation of time\nhere's the thing when something is\nscarce it's more\nvaluable okay so that's why a diamond is\nworth more than a piece of paper because\nit's more scarce when your time becomes\nmore scarce it becomes more valuable and\nother people treat you with more value\nso that's one benefit but my first day\nis 6:00 a.m. to noon and in there I'm\ntrying to get in there the amount of\nproductivity Joy business fitness\nwhatever it might be that I would get in\na 24-hour day compressed and manipulated\nthat time into to The 8 Hour window why\nbecause of all the technology at my\nadvantage now there may be some days\nthat's a Netflix and chill day for me\nI'm not saying you have to be\nhyperproductive that's okay that maybe\non Sundays a lot of people have that\nI'll have a day like that but it's not\nevery day and so the second day starts\nat noon and it runs all the way usually\nI sometimes I even shrink them to 6\nhours sometimes sometime I'll go 6:00\na.m. to noon so that's a 6h hour window\nI give myself a 2hour buffer the second\nday starts from noon to 6:00 p.m. and in\nthat second day I'm trying to get the\nsame amount of stuff I would get in in a\n24-hour day in my 6 to 8 Hour window\nthis year there's 6 hour days there's\n6:00 a.m. to noon noon to 6:00 p.m. and\n6:00 p.m. to midnight now I'm going to\nsleep in there I'm going to get rest I'm\ngoing to have laughter I'm going to have\nfaith I'm going to have cooling at time\nbut now what happens is at about noon\nevery day this thing goes off in my head\nand I evaluate what did I get done what\ndo I need to double my efforts on on\nwhat can I celebrate what did I learn so\nwhen an average person does it at the\nend of their day I'm doing it at noon\nand it now automatically goes off it's\nweird my my mind knows when noon is and\nit knows when 6 p.m. is and the same\nthing happens at 6 p.m. and then I'll\nrun it again and so I'm getting 21 days\na week you stack that time frame up over\na year when you get seven days and I'm\nmanaging time this way I've compressed\nin bent time I'm probably going to win\nyou stack that up over a year five years\n10 10 years and all of a sudden I've had\nall these more days and here's the other\nthing I just get a longer life I'm\ngetting multiple lives in one life\nsimply because I've taken control of\nwhat time looks like so they used to be\n8 hour days you asked about 2024 they're\nnow 6-h hour days and so I've get more\ndone oftentimes by 10:00 a.m. then most\npeople will get done in a 24-hour day\nand here's what that here's what that\nlooks like really quickly too many\npeople schedule 1 hour long meetings if\nwe're going to be tactical most meetings\ndon't need to be an hour but we schedule\nthem an hour because everybody's always\ndone that so my team knows is this a 28\nminute meeting is this a 5 minute\nmeeting very rarely are they hourlong\nmeetings cuz when you have an hourong\nmeeting now you're pacing yourself to\nfill the hour in but I've only got a 6-h\nhour day here so there's a lot of 28\nminute long meetings that other people\nare taking an hour to do we're just that\nmuch more productive that much more\nefficient in our time and so that's how\nyou actually get the day done is because\nthis one hour concept isn't it you think\nI'll meet you at 9:00 I got 9 to 10\nblocked off well why most meetings don't\nneed to be an hour long most business\nmeetings don't most conversations don't\nand that by the way will give me more\ntime maybe my lunch is now an hour and a\nhalf with a friend because I've bent to\nmanipulated time in my I call them mini\ndays that's so I'm so happy you shared\nthat because I just just even that\nconcept of us understanding how we're\nusing time in an archaic way and\nthinking about how many hours in a day\nin an archaic way it's bananas to me\nConcept in in itself is mind blown and\nyou can create your own version of a\nmini day maybe you're going to have two\nmaybe you're going to break your day\ninto two you know me it was 8 hours and\nI've moved it to six and I felt no\ndifference but I love that time clock\nthere's not enough time most people\nevaluate their goals like really\nproductive people they'll do it at the\nend of a day in the middle maybe the end\nof a month how did my January go and you\nknow this most people it's the end of\nthe year so most people's a year some\nwill do it a month really productive\npeople maybe the end of the day I'm\ndoing that three times in a 24-hour day\nnow the breakthroughs the learning the\ncourse correction the Strategic moves I\nmake that get me back on track when I'm\noff track and my bad days are only 6\nhours long right so I that gives me\npermission to shift at noon okay this is\na new day I get I get a do over I get to\nstart again so it's just a matter of\nusing a Time construct that fits with\ntechnology in these times yeah it's\nalmost like saying yeah we're driving\ncars now but it would take me a month to\nget to yeah it doesn't make any sense\ndoesn't make any sense4 wow what's been\nthe Habit because you also said you\nshifted from 8 hour days to 6our days\nwhy first of all why did you do that\nwhat what was the benefit of that the\nshift from for me was that it was the 1\nhours I'm like why am I taking these 1\nhour long meetings if I move them to 28\nminutes and and by the way it's awesome\nand and even you and I even when we\ncommunicate it's often times it's like\nyou and I have these beautiful quick\nconversations but they by the way there\nare sometimes my friends I need to go\ndeep and we need three or four or five\nhours but I also I know there's a lot of\ntimes in life like youever have that\nfriend that doesn't know when the text\nexchange is done you know that person\nyou're like all right man we've got okay\nit's over now like we're both going to\ngo now text other people or do other\nthings I've just gotten a little bit\nbetter at buttoning things up you know\nso to speak too I phraseology and\nterminology I was in a meeting a long\ntime ago with Alex Rodriguez I'll never\nforget this it was a really great\nmeeting and I know you know you know\nthem as well and so I was meeting with\nAlex and uh I'll never forget he's such\nhe's a gracious dude he's a good dude\nbut our meeting was supposed to end at\n1:00 in the afternoon and I remember we\nwere in the middle of something and I\nwas at his house and we were in actually\nwe were actually was back in the day it\nwas actually at JLo's house but Alex was\nthere anyway and I remember at about\n12:58 he looked at his watch that gave\nme a queue and at 1:00 he just stood up\nkind of in the middle of the meeting and\nthat signified the meeting was over and\nit wasn't rude his team just knows when\nthe meeting 's up we're done we're done\nand what that did is that set a context\nand a tone that when we have a meeting\nthat's this long that's how long it is\nand setting up those kind of disciplines\nand kind of barriers around your life\nguard rails around your life protects\nyour time and it's uncomfortable to do\nthat because we feel as people Pleasers\nwhich a lot of us are we're scared to do\nthat because we're thinking oh God if I\nstand up is everyone going to think like\nI'm like stuck up like you know there's\ngoing to be that sense how do you deal\nwith that discomfort and that\nawkwardness of I'm setting a boundary to\nprotect myself but I'm scared how people\nare going to perceive me it's just being\ngracious when you do it and it's also\neventually what I've found is like I\nsaid earlier people now respect my time\na little bit more I become more listen\nthere's a pace and a rhythm to success\nhere's here's something no one talks\nabout when it comes to success and being\nproductive and you know this there's a\nrhythm and a Cadence to it it's an\ninvisible thing that the people that are\nwinning somehow have found themselves\nyou know this with the actors you've\nworked with their entertainers it's hard\nto express but they found a rhythm and a\nCadence to their life that creates\nmomentum in their life momentum is a\nmajor magnifier in life when you get\nmomentum but there's a rhythm to it and\nwhen you sort of aren't disciplined with\nyour time and a meeting runs over 10\nminutes or 20 minutes you are not in the\nrhythm of success there's a pace it's\nnot hurried it's not hurried or rushed\nbut it's a little quicker than most\npeople know successful people walk a\nlittle faster they're in a little bit\nmore of a hurry they talk a little\nfaster there's a rhythm and a pace and a\nintensity a passion to the dialogue and\nthe conversation you know exactly what I\nmean and it's invisible maybe you can\nexpress it well right now too have you\nseen it and until you find that you're\nnot really in the rhythm of hyper\nproductivity or Bliss or success and\nwhen you're around people that possess\nthat Rhythm you feel it and it isn't\ndemeaning when they do it it there's a\ngraciousness to it and a respect you\nhave that they respect themselves and\nyou enough in that moment to be\norganized enough and disciplined enough\nnot to let it bleed into a place that it\ndoesn't need to go you know what I mean\nright yeah it's actually looping it's\nI'm so glad you raised that because it's\nsuch a subtle point and to me it comes\nback down to something I raised earlier\nof this energy and time balance because\nthe question I ask myself is the time\nthat I set the meeting is based on when\nI think my energy will be best and the\namount of time I give a meeting is the\namount of time I can give intense 100%\nenergy so I'm not for example when I'm\nrecording a podcast we do two podcasts a\nday maximum the reason for that is I\nknow if I did a third one I have the\ntime to do a third one but my energy is\nnot there my presence is not there I'm\nnot at a 100% intensity which means the\nquality drops so it's also not just\ndoing more as you're saying it's not\njust doing more because I can squeeze\nmore in a day I just know the third\npodcast is going to be the worst one\nthat I record and so we don't do it by\nthe way you should have told me that\nabout two years ago no seriously that\nyou're 100% right and I make that\nmistake sometimes of doing four in a day\nand it's not fair to the third and\nfourth person it's not I can't do it you\nmight a to do we all have different\ncapacities no you're right and the other\nthing I do in my schedule since we're\nbeing tactical is I like to load up my\nMondays and Tuesdays with heavy things\nearly in my week and I like the the\nlater part of my week to be a little bit\nmore peaceful and joyous so that I'm\nsort of building toward it's almost like\nmy Super Bowl almost my Mondays and\nTuesdays those are going to be heavy\ndays the other thing I do is my most\nimportant meetings I kind of know me I'm\nnot particularly a great early morning\nperson nor am I great late at night I'm\nreally in a good space about when we're\nrecording this right now that's sort of\nnoon to 300 p.m. window for me I don't\nknow if I'm the most hydrated I've\nalready worked out so my really\nimportant meetings I try to schedule in\nmy highest energy State when I know I'm\npeing in my given day so you're 100%\nright about that yeah and I think these\nare the mechanics of how you connect\nenergy and the real world because you\ncan't just say I worked out this morning\nI feel good everything's going to go all\nright now and I think we have that kind\nof we have this checklist mentality of\nif I've done these three things then\neverything else will go okay but\nactually all the other stuff needs to be\nmanaged and intentionally designed I\nthink I've been talking a lot about this\nrecently with people that I think often\nwe think if people are casual or relaxed\nor laidback then things will work out\nbetter but actually you find as you're\nsaying most success productivity and\njoyfulness is intentionally designed in\norder to create an experience and I\nwanted to get your thoughts on that like\nyou're a billion % right J the higher\nyou climb there's all this other\nstimulus happening in your life right so\nif you don't create those constructs now\nwhen you get to a point where like you\nget the things you want in your life the\ndemands on your energy and time only\nincrease and your ability to manage that\nand create structures around you that\nkeep you productive that is a huge thing\nyou've just shared I've watched a lot of\npeople climb to a point and when they\nget to that point they didn't create new\nstructures around them to support the\nNext Level every level you climb\nrequires a different type of energy and\nstructure and so some things even that\nI'm doing right now I know maybe four or\nfive years from now I'm going to have to\nre-evaluate those that'll change with\nthe conditions of my life for me right\nnow as busy as I am it requires more\nintent to structure than ever in my life\nand if I didn't create them when things\nweren't quite this busy I don't think I\nwould have continued to flow into the\nnext state and I've watched a lot of\npeople get to a place and then they\ncan't navigate that next level because\nof the structure maybe the lack of a\nteam around them quality people\nmanagement of those things and so I'm\nalways trying to be ahead structurally\nto my results yeah what most people\nthink is I'm going to produce this thing\nand then when I get there I'll figure it\nout from there that stagnates your\ngrowth you've got to be preparing and\nexpecting that growth and creating the\nstructures around you to facilitate it\nso it continues to flow so good so good\nand I think we get sentimental that we\nget sentimental like oh so good I can't\nlet go of this habit or this structure\nor this thing because it got me here\ntrue and I feel like you have to get\nreally non-sentimental like right like\nwhat you're saying about this preparing\nWell mine's my morning routine I used to\nhave a very long morning routine cold\nplunge meditate pray gratitude ritual\nstretch you know and the thing got so\nlong that I'm like my gosh I'm two hours\ninto a routine here I got to get to work\nI got to get some stuff done and so you\nkind of be and what it was is I started\nto accumulate these sentimental things\nthat man that day I cold plunged I haded\na big speech that day so I better keep\ncold plunging every day and I better\nkeep I started stacking up this closet\nfull and I had to come in it's like an\nold closet full of clothes I had to go\nwhich of these don't I wear anymore yes\nand I'm going to take this one and give\nit away like and so you're right it's\nit's the sentimental holding on to\nthings that got you where you are won't\nget you where you're going and so I have\nto constantly kind of audit my closet so\nto speak and so my morning routine now\nis nowhere nearly as sophisticated as it\nused to be it's much more brief but it\nserves me now it serves who I am now it\nserves my ambitions and goals now and so\nyou're a th% right about that yeah a lot\nof people I speak to as well they\nstruggle with and I've struggled with\nthis in the past where you know what you\nneed to do you know how much time you\nhave but then you procrastinate you\noverthink and I'm sure you get asked\nthis question all the time like but I\nstill see it again and again and again\nin the same people where they tell me J\nI'm going to have this done I'm I'm\naccountable I'm going to commit but then\nsomehow it still doesn't happen for them\nY what have you found is really useful\ninsight for someone who finds themsel\nconstantly getting stuck they know what\nthey need to do they know how much time\nthey have but they keep procrastinating\nand overthinking one you're you're\ntrying to get your life back to your\nidentity you and I talked about this\nanalogy before so I'll be quick with it\nbut your identity your personal belief\nin yourself your identity is like the\nthoughts beliefs and Concepts you hold\nto be most true about you it's a\nthermostat setting on your life we\ntalked about this before give you two\nthings so like this studio we're in I\ndon't know 72 degrees in here right now\nsomething like that the external\nconditions it's a cold rainy day here in\nLa the external condition for 50 degre\noutside that does not affect the\ninternal thermostat in this room it is\n72 degrees if it was 90° outside the air\nconditioners will come on and cool this\nroom back to 72° you procrastinate\nbecause because your results are about\nto exceed your identity and you're\nturning the air conditioner on so if\nright now you're getting 72 degrees of\nyou believe in yourself at 72 degrees of\nwealth or abundance or productivity and\nyou've started to heat it up to 85 90\n100° you subconsciously turn the air\nconditioner on of your life to cool it\nback down to what you really believe\nyou're worthy of and you deserve so the\nDeep work is you got to raise that\nidentity of what you believe your Worth\nto 85 90 100° how do you do that\ntypically proximity to people who live\nat that thermostat setting they will\nheat you up to theirs so that's a huge\none that is a Hu I just want to make\nthat you made that sound so simple and\nyou made it really easy that is the huge\none that is it it is at that gut level I\nwatch that's why you'll see somebody who\nfor example um their love thermostat is\n72 degrees and you you go on you double\ndate you they're with their dream person\nyou're like oh my gosh they're in love\nit's Blissful they're at 90 100 degrees\nof love in their life and a year later\nyou run into them and you're like so how\nis Steve or how's Janice oh it didn't\nwork out what happened was they turned\nthe air conditioner on and cooled it\nback to what they believe they deserve\noften times or wealth we've all had\nthese friends that they're 72 degrees of\nwealth and all of a sudden man their\nbusiness is kicking 85 90 100 and what\nhappens is it seems coincidental oh\nsupply chain oh this or that um a\ncustomer broke off a car broke down I\nhad to loan money to a friend no those\nwere circumstances what really happened\nwas you turned the air conditioners on\nand you cooled your life back\nfinancially to believe what you believe\nyou're worth same in your body someone 7\n2 degrees of Fitness they're getting in\nshape they've lost the 10 pounds they\nlook great and you see them in a year\nand they've come all the way back and\ngained it back and you're like what\nhappened they turned the air conditioner\non of their life and got back to what\nthey believe they're worth You' got to\nchange that thermostat setting and it's\ntypically like in my faith life if I was\na 72 degrees in my faith I started to\nsurround myself with some men in my\nfaith life who man they live in their\nfaith at 95 and 100 they heated me up by\nproximity now my thermostat setting is\ndifferent so that's a biggie the second\none with with procrastination is you've\ndeveloped a false belief system in\nyourself of what you need to know to\ntake action and so successful people are\nwilling to step into the unknown and the\nunprepared more than people who are\nunsuccessful I'm not saying I don't like\nto research like P You're super prepared\nfor today so am I but there are just\nsituations in my life of what I think I\nneed to know is much lower than most\npeople to step into the space and\nperform so procrastination is really say\nI got to know a little more I got to\nprepare a little bit more I got to get a\nlittle bit more ready a little bit more\nready a little bit more ready and you\nkeep raising the Readiness quota to a\npoint where you never take action and so\nyou got to get to this point where\nyou're like I'm going to get into the\nroom I'm going to start to write that\npaper I'm going to start the book I'm\ngoing to get into that and I'll figure\nit out when I get there and most people\nthat are successful have this internal\nbelief system that I don't need to know\neverything to take action I just need to\nknow enough to get in the room and I'll\nfigure it out from there and you've\nknown this with all the successful\npeople you've coached that is something\nthey possess in droves is the ability to\nget into a space and step into a room\nand figure it out from there and not\nhave to know everything and that's how\nmost of them discovered their passion\nthey even discovered it because they\nwere just pushed into it I remember the\nfirst presentation I ever gave uh the\nspeaker had cancelled really and my\nfriend said to me well there's no\nspeaker you've got to give the tour and\nI was just like what do you mean I've\ngot to give the talk like the speaker\nwas really like well known and like in\nthe community and all the rest of it and\nthey're like no no no but we haven't got\na backup and we can't invite someone\nlast minute cuz it would look bad on\nthem but because you're a nobody\nbasically you can give the talk wow and\nI was just like so I I started preparing\nand I had three days so I started\npreparing I started doing it I went up\nthere and I just did it and I loved it\nand I was like oh this is my this is\nthis feels right for me and I would\nnever have discussed that if I didn't\nget pushed into it very it would never\nhave happened that's a beautiful story\nnever have happened and so I think so\nmany times that you're so right and I\nlove that you addressed the first part\nabout belief of what we deserve I just\nwant that to sit with people because Ed\nthe way you like just put that out there\nlike I'm like that is exactly it that\nthere is some part of us that just\ndoesn't believe we deserve the level of\nsuccess we're striving for right and\nthose those those subtle subconscious\nair conditioners of Our Lives that cool\ndown show up as coincidences you know\nbut really they're not they're by design\nbecause you're going to cool your life\nback to what you believe you deserve\nevery when I work with athletes they're\nlike what do you do with the pro\nathletes you work with I'm mainly you\nknow this even what do most people want\nwhen someone's really successful what\nare you working on them I go usually\ntheir Identity or their confidence it's\nusually those two things and their\nidentity is the more important thing now\nthe other thing that happens for a lot\nof people with their identity is they'll\nattach their identity to the external to\ntheir beauty to their performance to\ntheir career and then when they lose\nthat career or they lose that their NFL\nfootball career they've God then they\ndon't know who they are without it so\nthis identity should be deeply rooted in\nwho you are not just what you do that's\na let's talk about that cuz I've been\nI've been playing around with that a lot\nmyself lately and in in trying to\narticulate that because I think the\nworld has convinced us that what we do\nis our value so even people's\nintroductions to themselves is oh yeah\nI'm an accountant I'm a lawyer I'm an\nauthor I'm a coach I'm a podcaster\nwhatever it is we're describing I am\nfollowed by a doing word not a being\nword and so even our value in society oh\nso and so went to that college oh so and\nso has that job like we see value and\neven in the past the way you had value\nwas someone was a blacksmith and someone\nwas a baker Y and that was their value\nand then even before that we used to\nbarter because of what we did and then\nwe could trade that so so much of our\nidentity for hundreds of years has been\ntied up in what we do by the way it's a\nyou're so brilliant bro I love our\nconversations it's a very dangerous way\nto live your life when your identity is\ntied up in what you do is a rather than\nwho you are as you say being you're in a\nvery dangerous place because if it's\ntied to those things and they then they\ndon't exist you're completely lost\nwithout them and it is a very shallow\nand I don't mean like shallow in the\nsense that like you know shallow like a\nCR I mean it's not a very there's not a\nlot of depth to that identity that is\nlong lasting when it's attached to what\nwe do or what we look like or what we've\nachieved\nyou know you'll say that you're right I\njust I just met someone the other day\nwho I knew immediately they lacked a\nstrong identity because they can they\nimmediately just resumed\nme I did this I did that I achieved this\nI was written here I was that and I went\nI actually stopped them and U CU I\nreally liked them and I won't say who\nshe was but I said you know I really\nlike\nyou I like you what impresses me is you\nwho you are your kindness she's\nbrilliant by the way this woman too\nyou're so brilliant you're so kind\nthat's your identity your identity isn't\nyour MBA your identity isn't your career\nthat's not your identity but they've\nlinked it to that and it is a dangerous\nway to live your life and it's not a\ndeep way to live your life a deep way to\nlive your life where you can make impact\nin multiple areas is to root your\nidentity and who you are those\nintentions the things that you believe\nto be true your character the way you\ncan conduct yourself your value in life\nyour value your valuable that's where\nidentity is deeply rooted not in the\nexternal it's okay to be proud of your\ndegree or your achievement or your\ncareer or your company that's different\nbeing proud of something and and having\na sense of you know gratitude for what\nyou've achieved that's great but when\nyou link your identity to it you're in a\ndangerous and shallow Place absolutely\nuh last question Ed we've talked about\npeace MH we've talked about productivity\nhow does it not lead to burnout when\nyou're trying to do all this right\nyou're working on the internal self\nyou're working on the productivity it's\nlike gosh Jay I'm I'm exhausted trying\nto do all this and exhausted trying to\nmanage like I I want to be successful\nbut I want to be spiritual I'm trying to\ndo I want to be everything and do\neverything like how do you how have you\nmanaged and what have been your\nReflections on burnout exhaustion and\nthen of course ruining relationships in\nthe process well I've done all those so\nI have experience in Burn out and\nruining relationships and messing things\nup and and here's what I've learned I\nwant all the things I want but I don't\nhave to have them right now and it's the\nright now of life I gotta be in a hurry\nI got to do it I gotta do it I gotta do\nit now now now now there's a power of\nnow some people lack the ability to\noperate in the now but for me it's I\nhave built into my life rest last night\nI slept 12 hours wow and the reason was\nis I've been getting to the point right\nnow where I'm tinkering on the edge of\ntoo much now too much now too much now\nand so I reflect back on my faith I\nreflect back on I love I mean there's\nbasic things I know you do but I'm a big\nperson on earthing and grounding I love\nto get outdoors I love to put my bare\nfeet in the ground and let that recharge\nme I'm real big on my recharge stuff now\nand sometimes that means lots of sleep\nbelieve it or not I used to brag that I\ngot five or six hours asleep and I could\noperate on that and I've learned over\ntime maybe there's a season for that\nthat's great but there's also a season\nwhere I listen to my body you're the\nbest at this but I've gotten better at\nlistening to my spirit and my body and\nmy spirit is screaming at me you need to\nrest you need to recharge I listen to my\nbody especially at 52 years old my body\nwill speak to me even more now than\nsometimes it ever has in my life and I\nlisten to it and I've given myself the\ngift I'm not afraid anymore you and I\nhave talked about this privately I'm not\nafraid anymore that I'm going to lose\nmomentum I can say no to something I can\nrest I can recharge I can reflect and it\ndoesn't mean I'm going to lose momentum\nI used to believe if I don't keep going\nI'm going to lose the momentum I've got\nand the truth is that's an insecurity in\nme that's my lack of identity screaming\nat me and there's really three things\nwhether you believe in whatever your\nspiritual beliefs are but if I if I was\nthe adversary or the devil what would I\ndo to try to get you off track what\nwould I do there's really three things\nthe first thing I would do is I get you\nto doubt 3DS I'll get you to doubt can I\nget Jay shett doubting himself doubting\nthat matters doubting his ability\ndoubting he can go to the next level I'm\ngoing to get him to doubt well that's\nbeen happening yeah if I me too me too I\ncan see it on your face right now me too\ndoubting me the second thing is I'll get\nthem discouraged I'll have a real critic\nI'll have some\nhits have them have a miss or two\nswinging a miss right if I can get them\ndiscouraged then I got him and the third\nthing if I can't do that or I'll do both\nI'll get him a bit\ndelusional delusion is believing\nsomething's worse than it is is or\nbetter than it is and you thought stack\nand you start to stack it what about\nthis what about this what about this\nwhat about this and I get you magnifying\nsomething to believe that it's a far\nbigger problem than it is far more\ndramatic than it is or far better than\nit is dude you just explained my last 12\nmonths oh my god god wow and so those\nare the 3DS and so it's it's doubt\ndiscouragement and delusion wow and what\nI try to do is when I see them showing\nup and they do I go I know exactly what\nthis is this is this is the negative\ncoming to get me this is this is trying\nto get me off course in my dreams and my\nvision and my contribution and I am not\ngoing to let other people be cheated\nbecause I doubt and I'm discouraged and\nI'm delusional and so I really focus\nwhen those things come up and I identify\nthem when they're there and I root them\nout because I know where they're coming\nfrom and they're not coming from good\nthey're not coming from God they're not\ncoming from high vibrational frequency\nthey're coming from the worst of the\nworst and so I absolutely rid them out\nwhen they show show up Ed that is a huge\ngift to me you have no idea you have no\nidea okay brother well good genuinely\nyou have no idea that you're a gift to\nme every time that is no that's a real\ngift Ed my let everyone uh follow Ed on\nInstagram if you don't already go and\nlisten to his podcast max out and books\nI mean no no no new books right now just\na power one more power one more was the\nbook we discussed last time power one\nmore hon to help anybody any way I can\nman always Ed you're the best uh thank\nyou so much for coming back love these\nconversations L they're so healing and\ntherapeutic to me I feel like I'm that\n72 spending time with the 95 it's like\nit really does heat me up

are\nvery damaged"
