it\nis that they weren't themselves they\nspent the whole life trying to please\nothers that's the top regret how do we\nfix broken\npeople before we jump into this episode\nI'd like to invite you to

to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nshett J shett the one the only J\nshett\nI've had the burning desire to ask you\nthis question so I read this quote the\nother day and it\nsays it's by Frederick Douglas yeah and\nthe quote goes it is easier to build\nstrong children than fix broken men and\nmy question was how do we fix broken\npeople there's a wonderful song by\nLeonard Koh called come heal or come\nhealing So It Begins\noh gather of to Brokenness bring it to\nme now the fragrance of those promises\nyou never dared to vow and then he says\nat some point and here's the answer to\nyour question oh troubless concealing\nand undivided love the heart beneath is\nteaching to the broken heart Above So\nthis poet Prophet poet\nVisionary saying we have two hearts\nthere the Brokenness above above and the\nundenied love that's below that's\nunderneath he's saying Do's the broken\nheart above and then is a heart beneath\nthat teaching the broken\nheart so that implied in that is that\nnobody's\nbroken then underneath the Brokenness\nthere's\nwholeness so and that's not only Leonard\nCohen\nany spiritual teacher as you know will\ntell you the same thing so it's not a\nmatter of faith see anything broken it's\nre it's finding the wholeness that's\nunderneath the\nBrokenness now Douglas is totally right\nStudies have shown that if you get\nchildren\nwho suffer for first three years and\nthen things get okay for them they do\nmuch worse than those children who are\nwell treated and have a good life for 3\nyears and then everything goes to Pieces\nthe latter group do do does much better\ncuz his words are it says the child is\nthe father of the man so so that what\nhappens early in life shapes our world\nview and our sense of ourselves so yes\nDouglas is totally right but ultimately\nwhen I look at\npeople whether they agree with me or\ndon't or whether they are suffering or\nnot or whether they even when they do\nTerrible\nThings there's there's a wholeness\nthere's undivided love underneath it\nisn't there there's a Shore right now in\nLos Angeles\nby somebody who's in a death row prison\nin\nTexas and his name is Obie sentenced to\ndeath and he's in death thr has been for\nthe last 20 years while these appeals\nwind their slow way through the\ncourts if he wins the appeal the best\nthing he can hope\nfor is life without\nparole and he's in love with life he's\nhad a\ntransformation he's dealt with his\naddictions he's dealt with his\nBrokenness\nhe he learned meditation he's an\nartist and some of his art is being\nshown in Los Angeles right now\nunfortunately I can't go see it cuz it's\nonly open certain days a week and I'm\nnot\nhere but there's somebody who came from\na totally broken childhood and found a\nkind of\npresence if you saw him you and I could\nonly Envy the kind of presence and and\nat least to speak for myself can't speak\nfor you the kind of presence and the\nkind of engagement at life that he's got\non a in a death row prison well if that\ncan be healed if that Brokenness the\nwholeness can be under discovered\nunderneath there's no be broken very\nwell said I I would agree to you at the\ncore at the root at the essence none of\nus are broken yeah and our engagement\nwith that which is broken and imperfect\noften rubs off on us but what would you\nsay are the most detrimental experiences\nthat people have in those three years\nthat end up\ncreating horrific Ripple effects long\nterm anything that makes them disconnect\nfrom themselves from their true SS from\ntheir gut feelings from their connection\nto their bodies um anything that\ndeprives them of\nhope I remember I remember taking part\nin a treat on is called an Enlightenment\nintensive where you do intensive\nspiritual work I won't go into the\ndetails but please go into the detail\nwell it's it's diads and two people at\none\ntime sitting across from each other in\nthe meditation\nposture putting a question to one\nanother first the question one person\nasks the other one listens and then they\nswitch places for four times and then\nyou get a different partner and the\nquestion is tell me who you are the\noriginal question comes from um R Raman\nMahari whose work I'm sure you know uh\none of these Indian Rishi and gurus who\njust asked everybody tell me who you are\nand the idea is that by emptying your\nmind and saying whatever is in your head\nclearing out the mental space the direct\nexperience of who you are will come to\nyou a direct experience not a thought\nnot an emotion but a direct experience\nno I never had a direct experience\nand I was embittered at the end and at\nthe very last diad person said tell me\nwho you are and it just started\nshaking and my whole body was tingling\nand instead of paying attention to that\nI I plunged into bitterness and I\nsaid is it my\nfault they turned off the light in me\nthey they killed the light in me so\nearly so I truly believed that the light\nin me had been killed by what had\nhappened to me as an infant and for much\nof my life even I had to became a Healer\nand even after I became a A Healer that\nwas\nrespected by so many people I thought I\ncould help heal everybody else but I\ncan't be healed\nmyself so to go back to your question\nwhatever early\nexperience kills your faith in your own\npossibilities that's what's so damaging\nand for that it could be evidence or\nexperiences of severe abuse it could\nalso be very sensitive\nchild who the world doesn't see for who\nthey are who the world doesn't permit to\nexpress themselves so they shut off from\nthemselves in order to be accepted by\nthe world so any early experience that\ndeprives you of yourself and that\nhappens to a lot of us so trauma is a\nhuge Spectrum but anything that break\nbreaks your connection to yourself and\nyou and your genuine not your false\negoic belief in yourself but your\ngenuine belief in your wholeness that'll\ndo it and that happens to a lot of us\nI've always personally experienced it\nas the volume of my inner voice yes so I\nfound at that at different points in my\nlife my inner voice was extremely loud\nand\nclear and\nand not only could I hear it clearly but\nthe direction was\nclear and then I've had moments in my\nlife where as you're ref referencing\ndisconnected from yourself yeah that\nvoice is extremely quiet maybe even\nnon-existent or\nit's screaming out for help it's you\nmean the voice of your inner self is\nvery quiet correct it can be well the\nBible talks about the small still voice\nthey actually call it that the small\nstill voice and it really takes\nattention to notice it because there's\nso much noise in the world and so much\nnoise in our heads and there's all these\nother voices that are much\nlouder you know the singer Cheryl Crow\nshe had breast cancer and uh she said\nafterwards and this could be and I quote\nthis in the myth of normal and it could\nbe right out of my own work but she\ndoesn't know about me she just came to\nthis\nawareness because the disease thought\nher something and she said said that she\nalways used to be serving other people\nand trying to meet other people's\nemotional needs and the breast cancer no\nshe's actually listening to herself and\nshe say there used to be these loud\nvoices inside myself telling me that\nwhatever I did wasn't right enough she\nsays no I've still those voices you know\nso on the one hand the voices of self um\ndisregard and and and self-loathing\nor self- seduction or very loud and that\ntrue voice for most of us is just so\nquiet so it takes a lot of attention to\nto notice it a lot of what you're saying\ntoday we experience\nit as this idea of people pleasing\nshapeshifting yeah\nmediating wanting to make peace often in\nour families in our friend Circle all of\nwhich are can be good Noble things but\noften we find ourselves disconnected\nfrom ourselves trying to play these\ndifferent\nroles not only does that seem to be\nstemming from a form of trauma of being\ndisconnected from yourself early on what\nsteps can one take\nto regain one's connection with oneself\nso that we're not running around\nshape-shifting people pleasing but at\nthe same time have genuine connections\nwith others in in the book we talk about\nthis tension between authenticity and\nattachment and authenticity being\nconnected to our two selves Our God\nfeelings which is necessary that nature\ngave us good feelings for a good reason\nand gave us emotions for a good reason\nuh attachment is a need to belong and if\nwe can be authentic and belong that's\nideal so\nif if you can find relationships and\nwhich you can be our two selves and be\naccepted and loved that's ideal but a\nlot of our families of origin our\nparents just could give that to us like\nthey had their own limitations they\ncouldn't see us or they had their own\ntraumas like I did as a parent and so\nkids then get the message that you can\nbe yourself or you can be accepted but\nnot both at the same time at which point\nfor sure survival stake for she\nsurvival's sake we go with what would we\nneed to do to get accepted and then we\nget that message reinforced in school\nand on the playground and with their\npeers and at our work\nand at some point you start wondering\nwho the heck are we anyway and whose\nlife am I leading anyway well how to get\nback to\nit here's the question prior to your\nAwakening and I'm sure that for your\nAwakening was probably both a series of\nunique events but also it was a\nlong-term process for me it was mostly\nprocessive rather than distinct\nexperiences but say prior to Awakening\ndid you sometimes know that you're not\nbeing authentic cuz I sure did I didn't\nknow why I was choosing not to be\nauthentic if I wasn't even choosing it I\njust was but something me knew well\nhere's the question who inside us\nknows only that authentic self that's\nalways there and so I say to people\ndon't try and look for the authentic\nself just notice when you're not\nauthentic just notice when you're not\nsaying\nno when there's a no that wants to be\nsaid just see why you're not saying yes\nbut there's a yes that wants to be said\ninside you notice the impact on you when\nyou don't assert your true self how do\nyou feel\nafterwards resentful ashamed or tired or\nwhatever so notice the difficulty being\nauthentic\nand ask yourself well what is the belief\nthat I'm carrying that if I'm authentic\nthen\nwhat so in other words not all that\nnoticing what does that do who's the one\nthat's\nnoticing is the authentic self so just\nby asking those questions you're\nstrengthening you're empowering that\nauthentic self\nand just going back to that the heart\nunderneath is teaching the broken heart\nabove well that wholeness is teaching\nthe\ndisconnection it's always\nthere I find that in between those two\nhearts and in between those two layers\nthere's almost a layer of guilt and\nshame so when we go against our\nauthentic self we do it because we're\nscared\nof whether we feel guilty or we may feel\nshame or fear yeah and if we act\nauthentically we then sometimes feel\nfor acting that way because of how it\nimpacts others or shame and fear so walk\nme through the construction of fear and\nguilt and shame which seem to be such\nlike if you thought about the emotions\nwe all experience most on a daily basis\nI mean let me ask you that actually what\ndo you think what are the emotions that\nyou believe people are experiencing most\noften most repetitively on a daily basis\nI was going to give you an easy answer\nto the shame guilt fear question but\nthen you threw a curveball uh sorry I\nwent off I was I'm following my I'm\nfollowing my authentic voice no I love C\nI love curveballs I just have to think\nabout it yeah please so what are the\nemotions people experience most often I\nthink um\nanger rage and\nresentment I think there's a lot more of\nthat than we acknowledge often\nunacknowledged experienced but not\nacknowledged for fear Fe of consequences\nI think also love that we also enough\nare often afraid to acknowledge because\nit's so\nvulnerable and we might see if I want\nyou to love\nme but I'm afraid to be\nvulnerable then I may try to impress you\nwhich may be the closest thing I can get\nso that you'll pay attention to\nme you know so that emotions shame I\nthink is very frequent for a lot of\npeople uh that's has to do with trauma\nmore than anything else\nfear is something that people experience\na lot um much more than they can admit\nto themselves Joy people are not so\nafraid of it well you know what that\nmight be Joy has been very difficult for\nme in my life and I think some part of\nactually some part of me used to say\nwhat right do I have to feel Joy when\nthere's so much suffering in the world\nnow that's logically a good question but\nit's a non sensical question why because\nthere is a lot of suffering in the world\nand there's a lot of joy in the world\nand one doesn't negate the\nother so for me it was\nlike what right do I have to experience\nJoy when my grandparents died in as I I\nquote this in the Mython normal my\nfriend and colleague and teacher Bessel\nVander psychiatrist who wrote the book\nthe body keeps the score he said to me\nonce\ngabo you don't have to drag aritz around\nwith you all the time which means that\nyou don't have to allow not to forget\nabout aritz but not to\nlet that control your Consciousness\nwhich means you do have the right to\nfeel Joy you you do have the right to be\nhappy even as the world suffers not\nbecause the world suffers and not\nignoring the suffering in the\nworld but there's no contradiction let's\ndive into some of those emotions because\nand I love how they were easy answers\nfor you and then the curveball but I\nthink as you said fear is a repetitive\ndaily emotion thought for so many people\nyeah a lack of\nsafety emotionally mentally physically\non so many levels we feel unsafe yeah\nhow does one process and\nheal through and with fear because it\nseems to be so consistent the way way\nthat fear shows up in most people's\nlives is in the form of anxiety see we\nare wired for\nfear there a great uh neuros\npsychologist died a few years ago before\nhis time Dr PP and he identified all\nthese emotional circus that we share\nwith other mammals and fear was one of\nthem we have a circuit for fear good\nthing we're not afraid we die a there in\nnature you know but that can become\nanxiety so let me tell you a story I\nwant to show you this bracelet that I'm\nwearing it's beautiful um it is\nbeautiful and I never thought I'd every\nbe wearing a bracelet but I was given\nthis just shortly after the time that I\nmet you and this comes from a place\ncalled hi guay in hau's Islands in\nNorthern British Columbia where I live\nthey used to be known as well they used\nto be known as Hau then with the British\ncolonization they became known as Queen\nCharlotte\nIslands that's really funny cuz I was\nspeaking in in London once oh actually a\ncouple of months ago to an audience of\n2100\nbritishers and I said does anybody in\nthe his audience know who the hell Queen\nCharlotte was nobody knew nobody knew\nyeah well apparently she was\nsome German princess who married King\nGeorge the Mad King George who was King\nof England when America became\nindependent anyway so the British came\nthey named it green Charlotte islands\nall of a sudden these indigenous people\nwhose ancestors have been living there\nfor something like 13,000\nyears all of a sudden they were living\non not on H anymore which means land of\nthe people but they were living in Queen\nsh land so I was giving a trauma\nWorkshop there for haer people that's\nwhen they gave me this bracelet and the\nmeaning of the carving set means these\nwords matter at the end of two days\nalmost at the very end of the trauma\nworkshop for the hi of people a woman in\nher 70s at least comes up and she said I\nused to speak perfect Haida until I was\n5 years\nold and then I forgot my language and\neven when I've gone back to school as an\nadult to learn my native language the\nwords don't stick in my brain and I said\nwhat happened to\nyou well what happened to her she went\nto these residential school residential\nschools where the Indi kids were forced\nto go\nrun by the churches mostly and she dared\nspeak her native language and the\nteacher took a stick and beat her\nmercilessly in her body and her head and\nher limbs oh native kids in in my own\nlifetime is when I was a teenager in\nBritish\nColumbia a four-year-old Indian n Indian\nthey're not indians indigenous Canadian\nFirst Nation kid spoke their own\nlanguage they'd have a pin stuck in her\ntongue so\nthey literally so I said to her look\nyou're losing your language with your\norganism protecting you it was your fear\nsystem telling\nyou that if you do that again you know\nyou might not\nsurvive cuz she hated herself for it she\nhated herself hat herself for the\nanxiety she hated herself because I was\nso passive she\nsaid I said that\npassivity was your organism's only way\nmhm to protect you cuz had you fought\nback or had you asserted your right to\nspeak your\nlanguage much worse would have happened\nto\nyou so that fear protected her but it\ntranslates into anxiety where it's no\nlonger fear of a specific thing it's\njust fear of the world MH now the the\nrate of anxiety so we have a a a system\nfor fear\nand the greatest danger to a young child\nis the loss of relationship because\nwithout relationship we can't survive I\nmean we're protect we're defenseless\nwe're vulnerable we're helpless so the\nloss of protective adults is the biggest\nfear that the child has in this Society\na lot of parents can't be there for\ntheir kids the way they need to be the\nway they want to be because of the\nstresses economic social racial\npolitical whatever they're going through\njust the nature of the disconnected\nculture that we live in parents are not\nthere for the kids the way the children\nneed to be the fear becomes chronic\nanxiety that we're never safe and now\nthat becomes part of our sense of self\nso what you say but but this lack of\nemotional safety what it actually is is\nthat early childhood fear because when a\nchild is afraid they will ask for help\nbut when repeatedly the help is not\navailable and the adults don't come\nbecause they're too busy too stressed\ntoo traumatized too preoccupied too\ndowntrodden or too propagandized by\nparenting experts to ignore their kids\ncries the child gets the message that\nthere's no\nsafety so that original fear that's\nmeant to result in a cry for help now\nbecomes chronic anxiety so fear not\ndealt with gets ingrained as anxiety\nit's no longer going about anything\nspecific\nis\njust being in the world is a source of\nfear which it shouldn't be it almost\nfeels like as you were saying that what\nshould result in a cry for help\nexternally yeah becomes a Perpetual cry\ninternally that's exactly without a\nfeeling of being able to help yourself\nexactly you know that Beatle song Help\nyeah help I need somebody not just\nanybody and John lenon sings and he was\na very traumatized child as you know\nwhose father left him when he was born\nand whose mother abandoned him a few\nyears later and then he sings in his\nsong when I was younger so much younger\nthan today I never needed anybody's help\nin anyway but now those days are gone\nI'm not so self assured so I open the\ndoor you know please help\nme no that's not the way it was when he\nwas younger so much younger than today\nhe needed everybody's help in every way\nbut because the help wasn't available he\nhad to shut himself down and make\nhimself sort of like a self-created\nself-sufficient person and only later on\nas they realize you know what I actually\ndo need help but he was never that\nperson who didn't need he just believed\nthey didn't need help why did believe\nthat as an adaptation because the help\nwasn't there so so many of\nus one of the biggest things that people\nare afraid to do is to ask for help when\nI give workshops\nand I I myself is my automatic reaction\nwhen somebody offers help oh no it's\nokay I'm fine even though the help would\nbe very welcome you know yeah how do you\nfind that because I feel so many people\ntoday have someone in their life who's\nclosed off from help yeah it might be\nyour partner it might be a child it\nmight be a parent we all have someone in\nour life\nwho in our limited capacity but a little\nbit of Awakening we can notice that\nsomeone is really closed and won't\nreceive help yeah how do you help\nsomeone who is rejecting help or not\naccepting that they may need it because\nof the position they've experienced\nbased on what you just said I myself\nused to believe I was one of these\npeople I actually used to believe can\nyou believe this I used to believe that\nevery else could be stressed but I\ncouldn't be I I used to feel like that\ntoo you know I used to believe that I\ncan help I can help everybody but I\ndon't need help myself you know there\nused to be a time when I used to feel so\nuh how do you help something like that\nyou help them by accepting that that's\nhow it is for them right now and not\ntrying to push your help on them cuz\nwhen you try and push help you're just\ngoing to get resistance so you if you\ncan handle it you can be around them and\nbe open but not insist or try and prove\nto them that they need help life will\nteach them when I meditate these days I\ndo the uh compassion meditation which\nsays you know that may I um face and\novercome all of life's inevitable\nsetbacks and challenges and failures\nwith patience understanding um strength\nand determination and May I Rise Above\nthem with um compassion and morality and\nintegrity and wisdom and and mindfulness\nif we can stare on people\ncompassionately without trying to prove\nto them that they need something that\nthey don't believe they need\nthen at some point life will bring a\nchallenge that may prove to them that\nyeah they they need help and if you're\nstill around open then they'll reach to\nyou if you try and convince them um\nbring them\nover um prove it to them force it on\nthem and I I believe me I've done that\nI've done it with my own family I've\ndone it with others you just invite\nresistance so the best way to help\npeople is not to help unless the help is\ninvited and that's almost what most of\nus don't want to hear because we want to\nagain going back to our earlier point we\nwant to fix and solve and make\neverything nice and perfect right now\nyeah and I guess that is also a form of\ntrauma there's something there as to why\nwe want that when and when I write about\npeople who are prone for chronic\nillness uh it's\noften people like like autoimmune\ndisease for example it's often and and\nthis is not just m finding other\nresearchers have found this as well that\nthere are people who tend to ignore\ntheir own emotional needs and are\ncompositely concerned with the emotional\nneeds of others and um they tend to\nbelieve that\num in the methan normal I quote an\nobituary and obituaries are really\ninteresting to me because they often\nhighlight as laudable qualities the very\nthings that I think contributed the\nperson's death let's talk about those\nyeah there was a book written by an\nAustralian\nnurse 12 years ago I the top five\nregrets of dying people mhm and she like\nI used to work in pal of care working\nwith dying people as you mentioned in\nyour introduction and um for seven years\nI was the medical coordinator of a big\npal of car and a dying dying people at\nbankar hospital and this nurse also P\nCare Health worker wrote This Book the\ntop five the top regrets of people who\ndied before that time you know what it\nis that they weren't\nthemselves that they spent the whole\nlife trying to please others that's a\ntop regret now this this obituary you\nhave to believe that I'm not making this\nup this is a physician in Canada who di\nage 72 of cancer and the obituary\nsays Sydney and his mother had an\nincredibly special relationship a bond\nthat was apparent in all aspects of\ntheir lives until her death as a married\nman with young children Sid would have\ndinner with his parents every day then\nhe would go home as his wife Roslin and\ntheir three children waited for him with\nanother yet another dinner to eat and to\nenjoy not wanting to disappoint either\nwoman in his life Sydney kept eating two\ndinners a day for years until gradual\nweight G began to raise suspicions\nnow this man suffered from two fatal\nbeliefs and when I say fatal I mean\nfatal one is that he's responsible for\nother people\nfeel and the other is that he has never\ndisappoint anybody not so many of us go\nthrough life like that you know no\nactually I'm not responsible for how I\nfeel I'm responsible for how I act for\nhow I\nspeak what I do and what I say mhm I'm\nnot responsible of how you feel in\nresponse m when you were in Vancouver\nand you contacted me and if I hadn't\nfeel like seening you but I hadn't slept\nall night say cuz I was up\nwith some other Duty or looking after\nsomebody and if I had said yes and still\ncome make you feel coffee cuz I had fear\nof disappointing\n[Music]\nyou and because I I didn't want you to\nfeel disappointed what would that have\nmeant for me it would have meant for me\nmore fatigue and probably I would have\nresented the hell out of you\neven though I was pretending to be you\nknow you\nknow and you on the other hand if I said\nno if I was authentic and I said look\nJay I'm sorry so glad you're in town but\nI was up all night I just you know now\nif he had felt\nhurt and perceived yourself as rejected\nby me that's not on me that's your\ninterpretation of my behavior nothing to\ndo with me I just said what was true for\nme so\nbut that fear of disappointment had I\nbeen afraid to disappoint you because I\ndon't want to lose your friendship and I\ndon't want to lose your friendship but\nif I believe that if I'm authentic I'm\ngoing to lose Jay's friendship that's\ngoing to keep me\ninauthentic and you'll never know\nme and even when you like me there's\nstill going to be a fear in me what if\nhe really knew me you know yeah so it\ndoesn't even work yeah but we're so\nwe're so afraid of disappointing others\nand then one day I may feel we have an\ninauthentic friendship\nbecause I can notice that you're not\nbeing fully yourself yeah and then then\nI can even feel that way you can let me\ndown even by trying to be everything I\nwanted you to be that's what I so find\nso fascinating in life is that you can\nlet someone down even after becoming\neverything you thought they wanted you\nto be well exactly well go back to the\nexample of coffee if I said to you Jay\nI'm sorry I can't do it\ntoday which honors you more mhm if I\nbelieve that you're so weak and\nvulnerable that you can't handle no or\nif I honor You by telling the truth\nwhich shows you more\nrespect you know definitely there so\nthat I can be everything you want to be\nand still not honor you yes yeah it's\nfascinating how we can be so opposite in\nour perceptions and viewpoints yeah and\na big part of that comes also we talked\nabout fear fear but I wanted to talk\nabout guilt because oh yeah guilt guilt\nwhat do you want to say about guilt no\nwell what well I want to hear from you\nabout guilt but when I think\nof guilt I think it's such a strong\ndriver for so many actions in the world\ntoday it is we're guilty of something in\nthe past and therefore we do something\nstrange in the future or the present\nyeah that we wouldn't have done we feel\nguilty right now and that makes us say\nsomething that we don't mean or\nsomething that we\nexactly how do\nwe untrap ourselves from the trappings\nof guilt great well let me tell you a\nstory so uh you know in the Bible in the\nOld Testament Moses is um um a Hebrew\nboy born at a time when the pharaoh's um\nsusers decare that some Hebrew male Bor\non this time will rise up and challenge\nthe Pharaoh so they decide to kill all\nthe Hebrew newborns by throwing them\ninto the Nile River but Moses's mother\nrather than throws the boy into the\nriver but in a wicker basket and so\nMoses floats down the river and he gets\nplucked out of the water by the\npharaoh's daughter who adopts him so\nthis Hebrew infant\nis um adopted into a Royal Court Tre\nlike a prince M that's why Walt Disney\ncould make a film called Prince of Egypt\nyou know all this happened just so Walt\nDisney could make a film as\nyou in any case um there's a extra\nbiblical Legend it's not in the Bible\nbut it's an ancient legend and you think\nwhat the heck is this guy talking about\nI just asked him about guilt and he's\ntalking about no I love this this is my\nfavorite type of answer is when I'm\ncurious and I'm foll in cuz I don't know\nwhere you're going okay great but\nbelieve me I'm going to come back to you\nI believe it I believe it I trust you so\nthe legend is that Moses is a toddler\nand the Pharaoh\nsusers\nDivine that he might be a\ndanger which eventually he proves to be\nso they decide to put him to a test they\nput in front of him two sparkling object\nI don't know if you remember but in the\nBible Moses is a speech impediment and\nit's his brother Aaron who has to do the\nspeaking for him how does he get the\nspeech impediment well the Pharaoh\nsusers say well this boy needs to be\nexamined and they decided to put him to\na test and they put in front of him two\nsparkling objects one of them is a royal\nDiamond of Egypt and the other is a\nsparkling Ember of glowing Ember of\ncoal now if Moses reaches for the Royal\nDiamond it means he's got oyal ambition\nand he needs to be killed so there's\nthis little toddler delightedly looking\nat these two scintillating\nobjects and his hand starts moving\ntowards the diamond at which point\nstanding behind him isn't is Gabrielle\nGabriel which is the Hebrew version of\nmy name Gabor by the way and and grabs\nhis hand and takes it away from the\ndiamond and puts it to the coal now\nMoses finishing the motion that kids\nwill do picks up the coal puts it to his\nmouth and burns his lips and that's how\nhe develops the speech impediment now\nhere's my question to you\nis the Angel Moses's friend or enemy\nhe's trying to be a friend but but he\nheard him had to hurt him to save his\nlife M right he a friend MH guilt is\nthat kind of a\nfriend okay guilt comes along in early\nchildhood not because you did anything\nwrong but because you sense that what of\nyou did displeased your parents and you\ncan't afford to do that so there needs\nto be an internal\nmechanism that keeps you close to your\nparents that says for example if you're\nauthentic and you show your anger you\nwon't be\naccepted there better be an internal\nmechanism to keep you on track so guilt\ncomes along as this friend that says no\ntake your hand away from where you want\nto put\nit you have to stifle your real\ndesires so guilt comes along to meain\nmaintain a relationship not cuz you did\nanything wrong cuz a 2-year-old\nthree-year-old they can't do anything\nwrong by definition M they may do things\nthat are not good and they need to be\ntaught not to do it but it's not wrong\nthere's no guilt there there's no I'm\ngoing to do something evil here you know\nso guilt is\ntotally not appropriate and there's ways\nof teaching children without guilt but\nguilt comes along to keep you in line no\nis that your friend or your enemy it's\nyour friend but it's hurting you the\nproblem with these early friends and I\ncall them some people don't like this\nword but I say call them stupid friends\nthe stupidity comes in the fact they\ndon't realize that you're an adult you\ncan make your own decisions now and look\nafter yourself you don't need to be\ncontrolled by their advice that was\nmeant for a\n2-year-old so that's where they they're\njust not educable mhm so when I say to\npeople these days now most people people\nwho feel guilty when they act a little\nbit on their own behalf I say to them\nfor God's sakes have a party celebrate\nI've done something for\nmyself call your friends you know have a\ncelebration that you were so quote\nunquote selfish like like like Cheryl\nCrow said all these voices that always\ntold her that she has to ignore herself\nand serve others now she doesn't listen\nto them anymore that's the guilt so you\nknow recognize the guilt say hello to it\nthank it no\nis that such a thing as health remorse\nyeah if I promise to meet you for coffee\nand I don't show up CU I find something\nmore pleasurable to\ndo I should feel some\nremorse so remorse is about specif\nthat's healthy remorse you know if I\nbreak my word if I hurt somebody or I un\nyou\nknow I should feel remorse but that's\nnot a long-term thing mhm it's not the\nchronic guilt that you're talking about\nmhm that's nothing what would happen a\nlong time ago and now it limits me or\ncontrols me it's a health remorse for\nsome specific\nthing that's different from guilt guilt\nis this old friend that's long outlived\ntheir usefulness and the challenge is\nthat we still treat it like a today\nfriend exactly it's almost like we're so\nscared of breaking that dependence as\nwell we\nuh thinking well I feel guilty that I'm\nnot around so I'll stay around this\nindividual this group of people whatever\nit may be but there's a part of me that\nwants to depend on them as well and I\ndon't want to break free completely as\nwell because I don't even know what that\nlooks like like you're saying like as an\nadult you can take care of yourself you\ncan walk your own path but you're\nactually scared of doing that yeah and\nso you accept the pain of guilt yeah\nbecause it allows for depend\nwell that's a good point and I often say\nto people you're going to have pain one\nway to the other yes which pain would\nyou\nlike cuz sometimes in life there's no\npainfree options MH you can have the\npain of suppressing yourself for the\nsake of being accepted or you can have\nthe pain sometimes of being yourself and\nnot being accepted\nmhm you can have pain one way the other\nmhm now I have my own\nbias that the pain of not being our El\nultimately is by far the greater and\nmore chronic pain and that the pain the\nshort-term pain of being ourselves\nbrings Liberation and genuine\nIndependence which means I can have\ngenuinely independent relationships with\nother people who are willing to accept\nme as\nindependent you know but in the short\nterm which pain do you want not there's\nno pain-free option you know yeah for\nsure that you reminded me of this\nbeautiful idea that tikn notan shares\nthat there's familiar pain and\nunfamiliar pain and these are our two\nchoices and the challenge is we're so\nscared of unfamiliar pain yeah that we\nwould rather choose familiar pain yeah\nand go through the same pain because we\nknow how it's going to feel exactly and\nwe think at least I'm aware at least I\nam conscious of how bad it can get\nexactly but hearing you speak being\nindependent or being dependent both has\npain yeah and but the pain of\ndependence far outweighs the pain of\nIndependence well just put a bit of a\nNuance in there ultimately I mean I mean\nTaran also talk about inter beinging how\nwe all inter are so in a certain sense\nwe do depend on each other you know and\nthat's okay the question is do we depend\non on each other authentically or\nauthentically the fact that I'm\nindependent doesn't mean that I'm not\ngoing to reach out for help mhm or that\nI won't offer it mhm but it does mean\nthat I will be honest with you and I\nwon't pretend to be somebody else that\nI'm not so that you'll accept me mhm you\nknow so there's anything interesting\nword difference between two phrases that\nsound very familiar one is called\nindividualism and the other is called\nindividuation now rugged individualism\nis I don't need anybody and I you know\nit's me against the world and this is\nthe North American capitalist ideal you\nknow well human beings never would have\nevolved had we been those rugged\nindividualists MH the rugged individuals\nwouldn't last more than one generation\nmhm but individuated\nmeans that we can be ourselves truly\nourselves in genuine relationship with\nothers MH mhm not rugged individualists\nMH I mean the most boring people are\nrugged individualists cuz they all look\nthe same you\nknow so so you can be um individuated\nand be truly\nyourself and still belong and\nstill vulnerably desire human contact\nyou know yeah I I can agree more I\nthink there's a lot of rhetoric around\nwell don't care what anyone else thinks\nand it doesn't matter and you just do\nyour own thing and it's almost that's\nalmost a bitter response as well because\nwe do have to care what people think if\nwe lived in a world where you didn't\ncare what anyone thought yeah it\nwouldn't be that healthy because we\nwould do all sorts of obscene horrific\nthings I'd phas it different I'm\nintrigued yeah I'm intrigued yeah I\ndon't care what anybody thinks but I do\ncare what I do and how it affects other\npeople m mhm you know\nso there's another uh spiritual teacher\ngunar Rana he wrote a book called uh\nmindfulness in plain English M which\nI've just been working through recently\nand um he's talking about a higher\nmorality that comes from being truly\nyourselves and in touch and he says well\nyou don't need rules anymore because\nit's like St Augustine said U love and\ndo what you will MH so if you actually\nlove the world you don't have to give\nyourself rules because that love will\ndictate how you act towards other people\nI can't worry about what other people\nthink look if I worried about what other\npeople think I would not have written\nany of my books CU each of my books\nchallenge the the reigning Orthodoxy in\nin say medicine you know or whether it's\nor under tension deficit or stress and\ndisease or addictions and every time I\nwrite a book I'm saying something that\nI'm not saying that I invented it but\nthat I have come to understand and\nfervently um believe and want to\ncommunicate but I can't worry about what\nother people think mhm or when I make a\npolitical statement I'm responsible for\nwhat I say how I say it but not what\nother people think about it but I but\nthat doesn't mean that I can that I\nignore other people's experience MH so\nas long as my intention is purely to\nspeak a truth and I do so with Integrity\nI can't worry about what other people\nthink I I can't but that doesn't mean\nI'm going to go around just doing\nterrible things cuz I don't care about\nwhat you think think as as long as\nI'm convinced that what I do if if I've\ndone that kind of\ninventory and I haven't always MH but if\nI do an inventory about well what is my\nintention here is there a hierarchy of\npain or hierarchy of trauma what do you\nmean by hierarchy I feel like people\nfeel like well this trauma is worse than\nthis trauma and this trauma is better\nthan this one we often hear about that\nas a conversation is that accurate so\none could say\nso uh because if you look at a child who\nsay sexually\nabused as opposed to a child whose\nparents just can't honor and accept and\nand and validate their emotions well my\nGod you're talking about two different\nset of experiences so that there\ncertainly horrific things happen to some\npeople to wound them and other people\nsuffer wounds in a very different way\nbut the question is is it useful to make\nthat distinction it's one thing to\nrecognize it but let's say let's say you\nmy four-year-old you come to me and you\nsay uh that I'm afraid of so and so and\nI say snap out of it only CS are afraid\nand to get out of here you take care of\nyourself and then you went to your mom\nand said I tried to talk to Daddy but\nyou know would it be helpful for your\nmother to say oh snap out of it think of\nall the kids that are being sexually AB\nused think of all the starving kids\nthink all the kids that are being bombed\nwhat are you complaining about would\nthat be helpful no so that it's not a\nhelpful game to play I don't compare\npeople's traumas uh trauma simply means\na wound and people are wounded in all\nkinds of ways when I try to help people\nthe least helpful thing I can do is to\ntell them that somebody else's trauma is\nmuch worse than mine or much worse than\nyours so objectively yes practically is\nnot a helpful\ndistinction uh people are wounded and\nyou have to tend to the wound whatever\nit is you know if you came to me with a\ncut on your\narm and you asked me to stitch it up it\nwouldn't be helpful for me to tell you\nthat oh what are you worried about\nthere's people with broken arms out\nthere or people with broken you know so\nno it's not a helpful thing to engage\nin even though there's truth in it yeah\nwhat's really fascinating every time I\nspeak to you Gab is that there's such\nNuance\nsubtlety and there's a quote that I want\nto share with you to get your thoughts\non I want to bring it up here yeah so\nthis quote is from F Scott Fitzgerald\nokay who famously wrote the test of a\nFirst Rate intelligence is the ability\nto hold two opposing ideas in mind at\nthe same time and still retain the\nability to function one should for\nexample be able to see that things are\nhopeless yet be determined to make them\notherwise absolutely so that's brilliant\nand what F Gerald is talking about there\nis what is called integrative\nintelligence and integrative\nintelligence is when you can say on the\none hand on the other hand both things\ncan be true and uh I need to somehow\ncome to some conclusion of about them\nwithout rejecting the one truth or the\nother now little kids are totally\nincapable of Integrative intelligence so\na three-year-old will either say I hate\nyou daddy or I love you Daddy but they\ncan't say I love you Daddy but I'm very\nangry with you which is really what's\ngoing on it's either love or hate so\nintegrative thinking is a capacity of\nintellectual and actually emotional\nmaturation a lot of people are\ncompletely incapable of it it's one or\nthe other he talked about\nthe the deadness of the heart and the\nmoral\napathy and all my life since I've been\num\nconscious of the horrors including and\nbeginning with the Holocaust that nearly\nkilled me and killed my\ngrandparents nearly killed my parents\nand I but when I became conscious of\nthat at age\n11 what happened was that my parents had\na book on a high Shelf they didn't want\nme to read and when I was 11 I climbed\nup on a\nchair and it was a book called The\nScourge of the\nswastika and it was about it was the\nfirst book about the Nazi Horrors and I\nsaw photographs and I read the\nstory and for years J afterwards\nliterally every day my head would be\ndizzy I'd spin say how is this possible\nhow is our heart not broken every day\nI'm asking you now cuz I I'm I'm\nwrestling with this question I suppose I\nhave an ual answer or more to the point\nmaybe along the lines of what Shel says\nhow can our heart be broken and not be\nbroken at the same time because I think\nboth are necessary yeah and and I find\neverything all across the world that\noccurs I feel like people's\nhearts are\nbroken but they break and ache for\ndifferent\nthings and I think that\nthat's why the words of Fitzgerald\nresonate so strongly with me yeah\nbecause just to repeat those last two\nlines one should for example be able to\nsee that things are hopeless yet be\ndetermined to make them\notherwise\nand you know what you're saying it's how\nI was trained in the monastery as well\nthe goal was\nalways how can you be a helper how can\nyou be a server how can you be useful\nhow can you help heal like that's what\nyou look\nfor in moments of tragedy whatever they\nmay be MH and I just think that not\nmuch unites us on the Heart level as\nequals across the world I don't think\nthere's many things that we look\nto globally as the human race as we were\nonce referred to or called to that\ncreates a sense of\nconnectivity and there's genuine\nfear that makes us feel well if my break\nmy heart breaks for this then what if\nwhat will happen to my heart that the\ngrief might be too much to bear yeah or\nor not not that I mean more so that well\nif my heart breaks for this\nevent some part of it is yes there's too\nmuch to think about for sure it's\noverwhelming yeah and then the other\nside is well if it breaks for this then\nis it allowed to break for that as well\nyou know this idea of holding two\nopposing ideas seems to be such a need\nin the world like just generally like\neven the belief\nof I have to work on my health but I'm\nhappy I'm alive like these are two\nopposing ideas like we're not looking at\nit from I'm unhealthy or I'm healthy\nwell you know what's interesting there\nis that when I was working paliative\ncare sometimes people would say to me\nand this is amazing I don't recommend it\nbut they'd say they'd be dying they\nactually should be dying they'd have a\ncouple of weeks left they say Doc I\ndon't to explain this exactly but this\ndisease is the best thing that have\nhappened to\nme I don't wish it on anybody but what\nwere they talking about now there's a\nguy quote in the myth normal um who\nwrote a book called blessed with a brain\ntumor blessed with a brain tumor young\nAustralian guy\nwho was diagnosed with brain tumor um\ndid have surgery did accept\ntreatment he also had a spiritual\ntransformation has lived longer than his\nprognosis I don't know what his current\nstatus is but he wrote a book called\nblessed with the brain tumor and by the\nway he developed a brain tumor exactly\nthe same spot that he used to point at\nwith an imaginary gun to shoot himself\nin the head when he was thinking of\nsuicide I said\nwhat do you mean blessed with the brain\ntumor and he said well knowing that I'm\ngoing to\ndie or that I\nmight means that every moment is\nprecious he says that means that when\nI'm talking to you or anybody else I'm\nfully aware that this may be the last\nconversation we'll ever have that means\nthat every moment is absolutely precious\nI've never been so engaged with life and\nthat's what people meant and so that\neven the disease that\nworld is going to take their lives they\nthey'd say and why because the disease\ntaught them to be authentic for the\nfirst time in their lives and they found\nout that was much more precious than\nanything else now that's not a bargain I\nrecommend to anybody totally yeah I'm\njust telling you that I've witnessed it\nand it's quite astonishing MH how many\npeople do find authenticity to go back\nto our previous theme they value that\nover anything else over even longevity\nMH now most of us would probably run the\nother way again I'm not recommending it\nyeah I'm just saying I've seen it yeah\nbut it's always those opposing ideas\nthat feeling of I'm good and I want to\nbe better yeah I'm a good husband or a\ngood dad or a good mom or I'm a good\nwhatever at the same time I'm not good\nenough like I you know whatever it may\nbe not that that's negative but the idea\nof I I I know I can do more and I want\nto do more so there's such a need for\nthis dichotomy almost to be held well is\nthere well the ability to hold those two\nopposing ideas is needed right like\nbecause you don't I don't want to live\nin a world where I think I'm perfectly\nhealthy everything's amazing because\nthen I may miss certain challenges and I\nalso don't want to live in the other\nworld of oh my God like everything's\nfalling apart and I'm dying every second\nof the day like but what if we just\nlooked at it in a unitary way then it's\na matter of growth mhm but I'm not as\ngrown as I might be mhm but there's\nnothing wrong yes you you know so you\nknow I'm I'll be 80 you know I me talk\nabout you said 80 80\nyeah yeah I know it's a big number\nyou're doing great this amazing well do\nthe numbers I was born in 44 yeah yeah I\nalways forget I forget when I'm with you\nyeah and me there's this expression I've\nbeen thinking about this recently this\nexpression growing older mhm so we we\ncould just say being older or becoming\nolder or getting older but we say\ngrowing older now that's an interesting\nphrase isn't it cuz actually as we get\nolder we shrink MH so what are we\ntalking about growing older\nwell because growth being an emotional\nspiritual process that continues that\ncan continue forever so for me it's not\na matter of I'm good but I can be better\nit's a question of can I continue to\ngrow not whe there's anything wrong now\nbut can I continue to grow which is\nreally the um essence of life as long as\nthere's life there's growth isn't there\nMH you know and uh the growth may be at\nsome point purely\nphysical at some\npoint physically there might even be\ncontraction but spiritually and\nemotionally there can always be growth\nso it's rather than a dichotomy it's\nmore like a unitary process mhm I I I I\ndo appreciate that I do feel that\nwhat is you just sparked something for\nme you were giving this example the\nstory just told about how the gentleman\nwhen he thought he was going to commit\nsuicide he would hold his almost like a\ngun to his head yeah and that's the\nplace he developed the trauma yeah the\ntumor how does trauma intercept the body\nin that way like this that feels such\nlike a physical example of that I can\ngive you other examples yeah when I was\nworking in paliative care\nI was looking after a young woman she\nwas 38 with ALS amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis which is a disease in the\nnervous system you basically get\nparalyzed the the muscles that or the\nnerves that activate your muscles you\njust die they Harden that's what scis\nmeans so they they become rigid and they\nbecome unable to move this woman she was\na dancer a beautiful woman\nand we talked a lot in her last weeks\nshe told me that all her life she used\nto have this dream of being buried\nalive boxin unable to be unable to\nmove she was a dancer and she began to\nnotice that on the Dance Floor she\ncouldn't execute the movements anymore\nsomething was wrong so she was diagnosed\nwith\nALS and she went to the office of the\nALS society and on the wall there was a\nposter that said having ALS is like\nbeing buried alive wow\nthe chist Jac and depre was a great\nclassic British classical\nchist died in her 40s she was a big\nInternational rocket M star in the\nclassical music\nworld she died of Ms multiple sclerosis\nshe couldn't move anymore by by the time\nshe was in her late 20s she couldn't\nplay a cello\nanymore when she was 8 years old she\nsaid to her sister sister Hillary don't\ntell her mommy this but when I go up I\nwon't be able to move or\nwalk now all of these people these three\npeople the guy with the brain tumor the\nwoman with the ls Jaclyn Dee they had\nbeen deeply traumatized and sheltered\nI'm not going to go into how but they\nhad been that woman's dream that she\ncouldn't Mo her\nwalk was literally an expression of\nemotional experience in her family of\nVirgin in her deathbed nobody came to\nsee her from her family she was all\nalone like she had been all her life she\ncouldn't be herself she\ncouldn't speak or move or get enough air\nto be herself so that that dream was\nmetaphoric to start with then became a\nphysical reality MH now how does the\nmetaphor how does the or how does the\nemotion how does the trauma translate\ninto physical reality that has to do\nwith the scientific little secret don't\ntell me doctors this cuz\nthey they might not know what to do with\nit but well some of them don't they're\nnot taught in medical school mind and\nbody are inseparable mhm our\nemotions our nervous system our\nemotional system in our brains and our\nbodies Our nervous system our hormonal\napparatus and our immune system are\nactually one system mhm uh all serving\nsurvival and growth and reproduction and\nso they're not separate even to say that\nthey're\nconnected is a bit false because it's\none yes yes no which means that what\nhappens emotionally can have a\nsignificant impact on the nervous system\non the gut on the heart on the in an\nimmune system and our hormones just\nobviously MH so without going into the\nmechanisms of how trauma affects but\ntrauma can affect genetic functioning\nour chromosomes function trauma can\naffect our immune system actually for\nexample study that I quote women with\nsevere post-traumatic stress disorder\nhave doubled the risk of ovarian cancer\naccording to a Harvard study a few years\nago well but that means that the severe\nemotions um endured by the woman with\nPTSD can declare themselves in a form of\nmalignancy because they affect the\nimmune system MH and uh the milder the\nsymptoms the less the risk of aian\ncancer so mind and body being one unit\nobviously our emotional lives and\nemotional traumas and wounds can show up\nin our\nphysiology which is why autoimmune\ndiseases are much more common amongst\nracialized women both in Canada and the\nUS CU they're hurt a lot more as women\nand as racialized\npeople\nso it it's just all one thing and uh\nagain is that a new finding or is that\nsomething or is that an ancient wisdom\nmhm and it's both mhm it's both modern\nscience not taught in medical schools\nfor reasons that\nare interesting but rather distressing\nand it's ancient wisdom as well MH it's\nall one and with that approach I mean we\ncan't minimize the number of steps and\nthe uniqueness of those but the hope is\nthat people can work medically and\nmentally to be able to release that\ntrauma I have photograph on my um on my\ncell phone on my computer of a woman\nthat I met U 5 years ago I gave it talk\nin London on this subject of Mind Body\nunity and how stress and Trauma can lead\nto autoimmune disease and autoimmune\ndisease is where the immune system\nattacks the body itself and this woman\nsent me photographs a year ago now when\nI met her she'd been diagnosed with\nautoimmune disease called systemic lupus\nwhich has got a typical presentation of\nwhat's called a butterfly rash so so her\nface is red like here like the wings of\na butterfly with the body of the\nbutterfly as a red rash over it's called\na butterfly rash it's typical of that\ndisease and she sent me a picture of her\nfingers when she was diagnosed they were\nlike yellow as wax because the blood\nsupply had been\nconstricted she was told that you got\nthis disease we don't know what causes\nit can't cure\nit probably will'll get worse and you'll\nbe on medication for the rest of your\nlife I could say these photographs you\ncould actually show them because she's\ngiven me permission she sent me pictures\na year ago face totally beautiful pink\nas anything no rash fingers are as Pink\nas mine yours no medication no treatment\nshe just dealt with the emotional part\nof it all her life she has suppressed\nherself just along the lines I've been\ntalking about she dealt with her trauma\nshe's become fully authentically and\nvigorously herself the disease is gone\ndoctors would say some doctors say well\nthat's just an anecdote yeah it's an\nanecdote but has to be a true anecdote I\npay attention to anecdotes not only that\nthis has been\nstudied systematically by\nothers and there are people who once\nthey deal with the emotional side of\nthings and take charge of their lives\nthey recover from diseases that are\nsupposed to have been hopeless and if\nyou just look at the example of um Step\nHawking the great physicist who was\ndiagnosed with ALS at age 20 he lived\nanother 55 years mhm now the disease\nprogressed but he live this prognosis by\na good half a century\nMH folks I hate to tell you this we\ndoctors don't know everything and\nespecially we don't fully understand I\nshould say as a profession the wondrous\nworkings of mind and body and the spirit\nand how they all interact so when you\nlook at the indigenous healing practices\nlike the North American natives that got\nthis medicine will the four quadrants\nwhich is you know the the physical and\nthe mental which which means also the\nemotional and the social and the\nspiritual and those four quadrants have\nto be in balance for us to be healthy MH\nnow they didn't have the science we do\nand they didn't have the amazing\nachievements of Western medicine which\nare truly miraculous MH but they did\nhave a wisdom that if only we adopted\nand combined it with the incredible\nachievements of Western medicine boy\nwhat a health system we could possibly\nhave you know and that's definitely the\nyeah what you're helping try and build\nfor the future and and all of our\nplatforms are dedicated to that\nhopefully we can get to a place for that\nintegrative holistic Viewpoint and there\nare more and more Physicians practicing\nthat way you know there are um people\nfunctional medicine and integrated\nmedicine not as holistic as I like them\nto be but far more holistic than\nmainstream medicine and these are\nmedically trained Physicians like I was\nso there's not like some Fly by Night\nalternative weirdo call I mean these are\njust doctors who like myself at some\npoint came to terms with the limitations\nof their education and needed to infuse\nsome more ancient wisdom into how they\npractice the Arts of healing gabo I'd\nlove to end with uh I'd love to hear\nfrom you what your wish your prayer your\nhope or however you'd like to word it\nfor Humanity is right now today at this\ntime if there's some words that come\nfrom your heart if if we could just wake\nup to our\npossibilities you know that you know the\nfamous story of the budha where he's\nwalking along the road and somebody sees\nhim with his radiant face\nand confident gate and he says who are\nyou a God and the Buddha says no I'm\nawake and if only we could be awake to\nour possibilities like in every\nconflict on the deepest human level it's\nso\nunnecessary we could could actually be a\nhuman race together we could be we could\nbe that we don't have to
