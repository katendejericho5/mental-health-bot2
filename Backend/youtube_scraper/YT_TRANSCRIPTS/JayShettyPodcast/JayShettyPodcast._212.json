for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nshett J shett the one the only J\nshett\nplease welcome to on purpose Montero Lil\nNAX thank you so much for being here I'm\nhappy to be here I'm happy to talk about\nstuff I'm happy to talk about stuff too\nand I wanted to start off with I know\nthat you love time travel yeah yeah I\nheard you were obsessed with time travel\nand when I heard that I was like that\nsounds like something I'd love to hear\nmore about where does that Obsession\ncome from where does that come from I\nlove the idea that you can go and change\nanything in the past or go to the Future\nto like to see see what's going on I\nguess\nit's it's like a form of escapism that I\njust really enjoy you know and I like to\nexplored in my art a lot yeah where have\nyou explored changing things in the past\nlike what what would be fascinating for\nyou to visit Chang in the past you know\nwhat when I was younger I always thought\nlike that's something I would want to do\nbut as I grow older I don't think I want\nto change anything in the past I guess I\nwant to go to the Future and maybe ask\nmyself like what do I do now I mean\nguess that's kind of like where I'm at\nin my life right now it's like what do\nwhat what did you do to get to where you\nare I know I'm in that place but I'm not\nthere right now yeah yeah where did the\nfascination come from where did it\noriginate from like where did it\noriginate from I say the Back to the\nFuture two movie not the first one but\nthe second one and a lot of Family Guy\nepisodes when Brian and Stewie like go\nto the Past yeah yeah yeah one of the\nthings you said in the documentary was\nyou said that Lil nzx helped you\nunderstand more about Montera uhuh and\nyou know the documentar is called Long\nLive Montera I wanted to understand from\nyou who is Montero and who's Lon\nnzx I think\nMontero was at first like this very shy\nsuper insecure kid and you know had Big\nDreams but I guess was just very afraid\nof like even being like himself and me\nbecoming L NAX it was almost a Persona\nyou know and he could kind of just do\nwhatever he wants and he can do anything\nand he can move on to the next thing and\nand not really be pige and held to like\nanything you know and he helped\nMontero morph into that\nperson if that makes sense yeah it does\nmake sense and was little nasx even if\nnot by name was that a\ncharacter and energy that you harnessed\nwhen you were young was that a feeling\nyou had when you were young or was it\nsomething that evolved through time I\nthink it's something that evolved\nthrough time like through music I think\nmy enthusiasm or just like my Hunger to\ngrow musically like pushes me to do\nthings in my personal life that I would\nnot do and it's like not even just my\npersonal life anymore because it's like\npublic now and I know if I'm not able to\ndo those things I can't continue to be L\nNAX or at least that's how it works in\nmy head yeah I mean I think a lot of\npeople can relate to that I think we all\nhave the little kid inside of us that's\ninsecure and anxious and doesn't know\nhow people are going to react and I\nthink we all feel like we wish we had an\nalter ego or a version of ourselves that\nwas stronger and Bolder and more\ncourageous what what kind of qualities\ndoes Lil nasx have that you love and\nadore I feel like Lil NAX knows how to\nnavigate any situation he knows how to\nfind his way out of things that may seem\nlike very like dark and daunting and he\nhelps Montero do that and I feel like\nthat's one of the reason why I call it\nLong Live Montero because I I still hope\nthat\ninnocent little boy inside of me\nlike remains you know because I think\nyou need that balance of you know that\ncourageous and you can do whatever and\nstill like scared like fearful but\nexcited you know yeah so it's not like\nyou're trying to remove the fear you\njust you actually want to protect that\ninnocence I want to protect that\ninnocence and I don't I think it's less\nlike removing the fear and more so being\nable to do things even when fearful and\nI it's like I'm showing the the younger\nme that exists within within me like you\ncan do this you can do this we can do\nthis it's it's going to be scary but but\nlet's go for it and see what happens so\nthere's this quote in the documentary\nwhere you said my mind is hard wired\nsince I was a kid that if you f up one\ntime you have to quit the whole\nthing and my question is when have you\nfelt that you've done that in Life or\nhave you ever felt that kind of fear and\nthen push through because little nasx\ncame through you know after the success\nof like Oldtown Road and\nwhatnot I had like this dark like period\nof like oh God like what do I do and I\nput out like my song Holiday like before\nlike right before Montero came out and\nit just wasn't living up to what I had\nhoped for and like I was in a hotel room\nand I was just\nlike telling myself like how much like I\nhate myself you know just like how do\nhow did you let this how did you mess\nthis up and wow and how did you get here\nand\nlike it's nothing we can do now like\nthere's no reason for us to be here and\nI guess that's like the childish like\nlike brat inside of me that is not\ncomfortable working from the ground up\nyou know and in my introduction to the\nmusic industry\nwas already at the top you know\nlike it's it's a hard thing to live from\nin a sense you know what I mean AB\nabsolutely yeah so it's the hardest\nthing to follow up with one of the most\nsuccessful drops of all time yeah how\ndid you process that I knew I was going\nto do it I didn't know how I didn't know\nhow I was going to continue but what it\ntook was me bringing out another side of\nmyself which was like Montero call me by\nyour name and with that though I had to\nlet\ngo of this\num this like child like innocence like\nthe public had with me I guess yeah I\nwant to dive into to your uh childhood\nactually I was going to ask you like\nwhat what would you believe would be\nyour favorite memory growing up like if\nyou were to close your eyes right now\nand think about Atlanta Georgia What's\nthe vision or the visual that comes to\nmind or your heart that resonates and\nconnects with love I went immediately to\nthis one but I don't even know if it's m\nbut it's like me in front of my like\nGrandma's\nhouse and I'm just like running around\nthe tree like I don't know that's\nbeautiful but I feel like that's one of\nmy first memories you know yeah and it's\njust like Bliss where was that like what\nwhere was the house what did it look\nlike what are you saying it was actually\nan apartment and it was um it was in\nBankhead courts Atlanta it was like\nbasically the hood you know what I mean\nbut at that time you know everything\nfelt all right so yeah yeah and how old\nare you in this memory or this I feel\nlike I was maybe like five it was right\nbefore the tree got cut down\ntoo yeah kind of symbolic in a way in\nwhat way I don't know I guess\num life\nincreasingly became more like\nreal things started to\nhappen within like you know my family\nlife and also at that time recognizing\neven at that age like you know my\nsexuality and whatnot and I feel like it\nyou know became like a rocky like ship\nfrom that moment is that when you\nstarted to become more aware of your\nsexuality was that an age that it\nstarted to become yeah I mean because\nthat was the age I be started to become\nlike aware of myself and it was also\nlike becoming aware of the world around\nme you know and it's like oh this thing\nthat's really bad that nobody seemed to\nlike I happen to be that thing but maybe\nI'm maybe maybe you know maybe it's not\nthat bad but also you know God's like\nprobably super mad at me and I don't\nwant God to think I'm like being\ndisrespectful or anything I'm and it's\nlike you know what I mean just all those\nthings that I feel like I shouldn't be\nthinking about it like six definitely\nthat's a lot that's heavy to be thinking\nabout at six yeah yeah it's a lot I\nthink for anyone to be processing at six\nyears old it's a lot of things to be\nquestioning I mean you in that memory\nyou talked about your grandmother\nand I know that your when your\ngreat-grandmother passed that was the\nfirst person that was close to you that\nyou lost yeah and that was when you\nleaned into music how old were you when\nthat happened considering that memory\nyou have that you just visualize how old\nwere you when that happened and how did\nthat make you lean into music you know I\nactually that actually happened when I\nwas maybe 18 so wow but at that time my\ndad had already had custody cuz I used\nto live with my grandmother from like\nwhen I was like like um like 5 until\nlike 11 and I was just like The Golden\nChild I was like spoiled and like I got\nso much love and I was like you know I\nwas the baby of the family so once my\ndad got cussy of us you know he played\nlike much more like hard ball kind of\nVibes and I didn't see my grandmother as\nmuch but she was still like number one\nperson in my heart when I like thought\nabout like love and you know around 16\nor so like I was told she had cancer and\nit\nwas it was like it was like this thing\nthat I was like oh it can't be true and\nI kind of just like tried to forget like\nit existed I'm like well she's still\nalive like you know maybe that was just\nlike denial yeah I think it was like a\nlot of now even like when I was around\nher like you know noticing that she was\nlike getting skinnier and\nlike like looking different and she\nwould like say\nthings like you know I'd be like Grandma\nI love you and she'd like you know like\nI don't love myself and and stuff like\nthat it was\njust it was really hard to like hear and\nlisten to this person that you have so\nmuch love for like\nlose like faith in life and just like\nthe world in general and it's like it's\nalso the person that has took on a role\nof being the back of the family for so\nmany people like you know of the the\nperson you know the grandmother like she\nhas like the family reunion she has\neverybody over for Thanksgiving she\nwatch the kids like that's like a big\nthing in the black community and whatnot\nand and now like you know she I guess\nlike feel feels cheated by life and you\nknow I guess I could feel that through\nthe way she would carry herself at that\ntime and so it was really hard when she\npassed and it was something I tried to\nlike brush\nover yeah yeah it's interesting I\nactually lost my uncle when I was around\naround your age at that time and he was\nhe also was diagnosed with throat cancer\nyeah and I was really close to my uncle\nhe was he taught me how to drive he\nhelped me get my first job he used to\nown like a new shop and you know sell\nnewspapers and stuff so he would like\nlet me work out work in the shop and\nmake a little pocket money and and then\nwhen he died it was really interesting\nfor me because I was getting more into\nspirituality at the time and he was\nreally angry that I was getting into\nspirituality and so he was so mad at me\nand like you know when he was really\nreally unwell he'd be like I hope you're\nnot going to get it spiritual and I hope\nthat's not going to be your part and so\nhe was kind of losing that positive\nspark he was always like this positive\nenergy and then towards the end of his\nlife he was more Angry than anything\nelse and it was uh yeah it was an\ninteresting experience going you know\ngoing from someone that again loved me\nso much helped me so much someone that I\nwas very close to to then feeling like\nhe actually didn't like who I was\nbecoming how did you feel your\ngrandmother's love evolved for you sorry\nfor sorry about about that I don't know\nthank you you you you inspired me to be\nvulnerable and share it back with you\nbecause yeah I guess we both lost\nsomeone that we cared about at similar\ntime um but yeah how did your\ngrandmother's love evolve for you from\nthat 5 to 11 age when you were living\nwith her like how do you how do you\nthink she loved you that stayed with you\nI guess that's like afterwards five um\noh like during the time both you know my\ngrandmothers um like one of those things\nthat that she really loved when you know\nlife I guess wasn't like great like\nwhere we lived and you know our like\nfinancial situation and just like you\nknow the what comes with you know\ngetting older in life uh you know I got\nI got all the love I got all the love\nand you know sadly my siblings got the\nother end of that stick I guess\n[Music]\nand you know around the time my dad got\ncustody of us I didn't feel like that\nspecial child anymore which is probably\ngood for my young ego you know like\nfeeling like I had to be like that one\nall the time and I guess I kind of\nstopped seeing my grandmother as much\nI'd go over there like a lot of the\nweekends and whatnot but you know it was\njust like the thing that I I can't be\nthere anymore and and then eventually\nlike she passed away and it was just\nlike just very confusing do you remember\nthe first song that you made after her\npass or anything that any music that\ncame from that I made a song called like\ncarry on and I was it was pretty much\nabout how I like felt like very selfish\nabout not being there when she passed\naway when I was supposed to be there\nthat day you know but I was so stuck on\nsocial media you know what I mean and I\nwas so like really like into Twitter and\ntrying to you know build that even\nthough I know my grandmother's like on\nher last days and it was just like I\njust felt like\nvery selfish because it was you know\nlike this person that showed you so much\nlove showing you so much love\nand you're not there because you're like\nuh trying to get these people's\nattention\nonline yeah I think a lot of people can\nrelate to that too you get so obsessed\nwith your career or a direction or a\npath and it's working and it's winning\nand there's momentum yeah and and we all\nkind of you know and you were young when\nthat happened for you but a lot of\npeople into their 30s 40s 50s will you\nknow attested that and put their hand up\nand say you know they've done that where\nthey've over prioritized their career to\ntheir relationships how's that shifted\nhow you've lived since then like that\nreflection or realization that you've\nhad I'll be honest I'll\nsay I was still kind of like that way up\nuntil these last like maybe two years of\nI guess my break from like music or\nwhatnot I've started to\nreally actually like cherish like being\nwith my family and stuff cuz it's like\nthese people are growing up so fast like\nthe like the my nieces and nephews you\nyou know you see that on TV and you feel\nlike it's like cliche or whatnot but it\nit happens like so fast and I feel like\nthe older I get the faster these years\nlike somehow go by\nand uh yeah yeah pretty much yeah that's\na wise realization to have at 24 I'll\ntell you that like that's that's early I\nthink most people that I speak\nto again like you're saying we hear the\ncliche we see it but I'd say most people\ndon't get to that realization until\nthey're like 30 40 maybe even later on\nin life you know it's it's a weird one\nbecause you kind of feel like you'll be\nthe exception yeah right like everyone\nfeels like they'll be the exception\nmaybe their life will go slower they'll\nhave time for everything uh there was\nanother line in the documentary that\nreally resonated with me there was so\nmany things I I can't wait for everyone\nto watch the documentary honestly\nbecause as someone who knew your music\nwas aware of you I felt like I got\nreally invited into your stream of\nConsciousness during it and I so\nappreciated I found your thinking out\nloud to be extremely comforting even\nthough we've never met each other and we\ndon't know each other and there were so\nmany things that you said where I was\nlike oh I can relate to that in some way\nand this was this was another one you\nsaid a lot of the times when I'm scared\nit's when I'm about to do something that\nwill change my life drastically and I\nwas going to ask you what scares you the\nmost right now or what do you feel\nfearful about right now that you think\nmight be on the verge of changing your\nlife\ndrastically I think just like my place\nright now in my actual like career in\nlike these last like couple of weeks you\nknow I've never been here like mentally\nand actually like\nphysically you know\nwhere you've like been so like focused\nand like zoned in on what you're doing\nand you push your art out into the world\nand it's kind of like received\nnegatively by like a the majority you\nknow what I mean but then like also\nunderstanding why you know and and\nhaving to like see it through so I guess\nthat's that's where I'm at right now and\nmy next move you know the things that\nI'm planning on right now I\nI feel like somewhere in here there's\ngoing to be this magical moment that I\ncan't even take credit for and yeah I\nfeel like that's that's going to sweep I\nfeel like that always happens so yeah\nthere's always magic in the messiness\nyeah but it's not\nfun no not at all it's it's been a lot\nyeah no we we'll get to that as well\nthere was there's another line that kind\nof spared what you just said now you\nsaid you talk about wanting a little bit\nof chaos like there's a part of you that\nlikes a little bit of Chaos and I was\ngoing to ask you what does positive\nchaos look like to Montero and what does\nnegative chaos look like I think the\nthing is it's usually when I can control\nit I I lost I don't I don't think I have\nthe grip on controlling it I feel like\nit does a lot of what it wants now you\nknow yeah I'm usually like strategic\nwith things and I can kind of like move\nthe conversation but that's the chaos I\nlike yeah yeah it's it's it's kind of\nlike a kid\nthat starts a fire and it's into under\ncontrol as to a forest fire like in the\njust like oh this is not this wasn't\nsupposed to this is not my chaos yeah\nbut yeah I like to keep things\ninteresting or whatnot\nand yeah lead the conversation around it\nbut yeah yeah yeah I think all I think\nall of us love that we I love and I\nappreciate the honesty like I think we\nall love chaos that's under control and\nthat we can control yeah drama that we\ncan control but then as soon as it and\nand it's funny because it always starts\nlike that right like even a forest fire\nstarts because there was a little\ncontrollable fire but then it spread\nreally really fast yeah and that feeling\nof things leaving your grip is like the\nmost uncomfortable feeling in the world\nwhen you feel something just like Thor\nit's it's the worst feeling ever yeah\nwhen when you feel that way when you've\ncreated something and then it takes a\nlife of its\nown so you've experienced it positively\nand challengingly how do you process\nthat or how do you allow yourself to\nokay with creating something controlled\nand then it becomes fully chaotic and\nout of I allow it it can get almost like\ndepressing but you know actually\ndepressing and it can you can become\nlike super angry with yourself as I said\nlike earlier or whatnot yeah and yeah I\nmean it it gets that deep yeah yeah yeah\nbecause you said recently and as you\nbrought up the last two weeks you said\nyou said you felt like you really messed\nup this time and I was like you know\nand you were saying that it affected\nyour mental health right like it really\nfelt like it affected your mental health\nand I'm\nlike why did you feel that way and and\nin what way does it affect your mental\nhealth I already kind of like explained\nthe situation you know in that video but\nit was it was this thing that\nartistically it was just supposed to be\nlike I'm returning like I'm back I'm\nback like him you know what I mean and\nit turned into this whole thing\nwhere it was me trying to dunk on\nChristians or something and that was\nnever like what it was never and then\nand then I then I looked at the video\nwith me like eating like the communion\nor whatnot and I was like okay this\nlooks really bad on paper this thing\nthat I thought was just like a little\njokey fun video I also had to think\nabout like how many of my family members\nare like cising like my grandmothers and\nstuff and you know like Auntie and\nthings like that I'm like wow like do\nthey see this as that\ntoo if they do like you know that's\nthat's really messed up and\nit you know it made me sad and then you\nknow on top of that like seeing like\nactual fans like turn and say like whoa\nwhy is he doing this why is he keep\nmessing with these people and I I think\nanother thing was messages got turned\naround because one got turned around the\nof Montero call me by name which is me\nlike taking ownership of this place\neverybody tells me I'm going to go and\nthat was just turned into oh he's\nteaching Christianity a lesson when\nthat's not the case you know and now\nthis thing was like oh I'm Jesus I'm I'm\nback like Jesus which is if anything\nit's it's it's like homage to Jesus it's\nlike this guy that made the greatest\ncomeback of all time and I'm not the\nfirst artist to do such a thing that\nmessage like turned around and I didn't\nknow I didn't know how to like do\nanything with it it wasn't my chaos\nanymore it was the worlds and anything\nanybody said was true because that's who\nI am as a person I'm I'm this Troll and\nI want to make these people\nmad and so everybody can run with that\nand there's nothing I can do about that\nI can I can say as many things as I want\nbut knowing my\nhistory they look right I look wrong\nyeah yeah well I think the way you\naddressed it and you're addressing it\nright now is is helpful and useful to\npeople because I think it came across\nvery clearly to me and it does today too\neven sitting with you like it's not\nsomething you're trying to disrespect or\nmock but for people who feel that way\nwhat would you say to them like for\nsomeone who feels that that is what it\nis how would them yeah what would you\nwant them to hear it's probably a better\nquestion you know what's you know what's\ncrazy I I I I feel like I've said you\nknow I apologized for the communion\nthing on that note everything else I'm\nnot sorry about I don't I don't think I\ndid anything wrong you know what I mean\nand it's like I've also been making like\na lot of like gospel music like to to\nlike God and and like like my spiritual\nside and I hate that this whole thing\ngets turned into like a mockery which it\nisn't you know yeah know thank you for\nsharing that I appreciate it and and I\nthink there's also like I was going to\nactually maybe maybe that's a good thing\nto talk about like obviously your\nfather's a gospel singer right yeah what\nI would love for you to talk about your\nrelationship with your father to give\nkind of context to the conversation\nwe're having right now because I'm not\nsure how many people are aware of your\ndeep Christian root so walk walk us\nthrough some of your relationship with\nyour father and how that's evolved which\ncomes across in the documentary for sure\nI feel like me and my father has have\ngrown closer as I got older cuz the\nversion of me that he saw wasn't really\nme it was the Virgin that I presented to\nhim\nso as I've like come out and whatnot\nlike even before I came out though my\ndad um well when I did initially came\nout when I initially came out to my dad\nhe was just like you know the devil\nmaybe tempting me or whatnot and it's\ndefinitely taking its own Journey\nbecause now like my dad is like yo do\nyou have a boyfriend kind of VI like you\ncan tell me about that stuff like you\ncan let me know that and you know he\neven came to me he even came with me to\nlike a gay club with like my brothers\nand sisters one time just like dancing\nand stuff it's it's been a complete like\num how does that feel like because from\ngoing from you know coming out to your\nparents and your father saying yeah you\nknow the de I mean that is a really\nextreme obviously reaction on one end\nand now coming with you to a gay club\nlike how does that transition even a how\ndoes that transition happened be how\ndoes that feel I feel like it was an\novertime thing and also him like\nlearning me as a person like I feel like\nhim seeing me in interviews and stuff\nlike that was like the same for\neverybody else like every I feel like\nthe entire world started to see me my\nbrothers and sisters my family everybody\nstarted to see me at the same time you\nknow what I mean I feel like before that\nI was just\nvery like Meek about everything so over\ntime you know with call me by name\ncoming out and and like the entire like\nMontero album like roll out and me\ninviting him and like listening to my\nsongs on my last album that's how he\nlearned about me and I feel like him\nhearing me from my own mouth and like in\nthe world and seeing me in the world\nlike help him understand me more and I\nfeel like over time he was like okay I I\nI understand now you know what I mean it\nfeels like you've also always had this\ncompassion for people who don't always\nunderstand you like even when you say\nwhen you when you when you first told\nyour father like and he had that\nreaction of maybe the devil's tempting\nyou you actually understood that like\nthere was a part of you that went oh I\nget that and then there's other parts in\nthe documentary true when you have\nprotesters outside and again you're like\nI'm actually happy that they have\nsomething that they belong to and they\nstand for like there's a there's a\ncompassion and context that you seem to\nhave even when you're the one who's\ntrying to express yourself you can see\nhow it's hard for people to digest that\nwould that be had to say for sure I mean\nthe truth is I feel like over like the\nlast couple of\nyears I've learned not everybody is\nagainst you is just like against you you\nknow there's a lot of like learned\nthings you know a lot of things over\ntime people have latch on to and in\ntheir brains is hard to let go of so\nthey see you as this way because of\nsomething that was you know far beyond\ntheir control things they've been taught\nsince they' like grew up you know like\nmy dad has been taught and like shoved\nin his head you know and and everybody\nin the world like we all have like\nideals like put into our brains and I\ndon't want to like try to be a thing\nwhere it's easy to\npaint people who don't like you as like\nhaters or just like evil and like bigot\nand whatnot but it's like these people\njust genuinely don't understand you and\ninside of their mind like it's it's like\nfear you know it's like fear and\nit's it's like discomfort and it's all\nthese things that the human mind wants\nto run from you know and I understand\nthat because I still have those things\nyeah we all we all see things in others\nthat we don't understand and as soon as\nwe don't understand something the most\nhuman emotion is to feel fear any sort\nof change makes us feel fear any sort of\nuncertainty and so if someone we look at\nsomeone and we feel uncertain about them\nit generally Sparks fear that's how\nwe've almost been conditioned as humans\nto just feel fear and so as you've said\nbefore you said some people see me as\nthe satanic devil that is going to ruin\nthe world like when you when you say\nthings like that what are you actually\ntrying to do when people see you that\nway like what I'm interested in is when\npeople see you that way what are you\nactually trying to portray that\nsometimes gets seen that way it's more\nso um taking all these\nthings that I\nbelieve have been used to like demonize\nme and a lot of other people and these\nconspiracies and it\nsays okay this is what this looks like\nis is this what you actually want to see\nyou know what I mean is this is this who\nyou think I\nam okay I'm going to do those things I'm\ngoing to do those things you think I'm\nlike this so I'm going to do these\nthings when you're building a new album\nbuilding a new song making a music video\nwhat's your artistic process like where\ndoes it start like like what happens is\nit you taking notes is it journaling is\nit working with your team your dancers\nlike how does how does new work get\ncreated in mono's world can can we pause\nfor a yeah of course we can of course we\ncan yeah yeah okay yeah I'm with you you\nI want step outside of course you can of\ncourse you can yeah absolutely of course\nyou can man of course you can let's open\nup\ntake your time got\nyou what would you like to say where is\nwhere's your H well first I'll say what\nI said out there\num I'm trying to be authentic and say\nyou know words from my heart but you\nknow I feel like it ends\nup sounding rehearsed and I guess\num yeah I'm trying to get\nthere but yeah I'm doing my\nbest but we can move from we can move\nfrom this yeah yeah yeah and and all you\ncan ever be asked for is doing your best\nso can't ask for anything more and I\nthink we're all in\nthat we're kind of all in\nthat pressure of trying to be authentic\nselves but then\nyou know there's that there's that\nfamous meme on social media that I see\nall the time that says society says be\nyourself and then society says no not\nlike that yeah and and I think you know\nwe all kind of spend some time oh that's\nso that's authentic that's\ntrue yeah\nyeah yeah you know Society doesn't\nreally want like people to be like\nthemselves and stuff like that just like\nto a\ndegree yeah we yeah we want everyone to\nbe authentic in a way that makes us feel\ngood the the truth is is if everyone was\nauthentic oh boy this world would be\ninsane what would it be like it it would\nhave some great things but definitely\nlike some terrible things too yeah yeah\nso it's probably better that everyone's\na little less\nauthentic it's an interesting\nconversation authenticity is an\ninteresting conversation I think it\ndepends on what you see is better like\npositive and light does that\nautomatically equals like better like\ncuz it's I feel like some dark things\nhelp bring light you\nknow\nbalance yeah yeah yeah it's almost like\nI feel like even internally when you're\ndoing the work Shadow work and stuff\nlike that yeah you have to go through a\nlot of Darkness you know you got to\nunderstand like what you are capable of\nand and like who you are and decide not\nto do like like that that bad that you\ncould do you know MH mhm yeah do you do\na lot of inner work is that kind of I\nknow you became spiritual and you got\ninvolved in a bit of your own\nspirituality what does what does that\nlook like exploring your own\nspirituality what does that look like in\nyour definition and your words yeah I do\na lot of like inner work\nand understanding like who I am and but\nalso like the and like trying to let go\nof the pressures of I guess what I feel\nlike Society a lot of times will want me\nto be M you know like this big Brave\nlike Champion for the community which\nyou know I can't be at all times you\nknow what I mean I just want to do me\nsometimes of course like I want to do\nwhat I can but I want it to come\nnaturally and is there a lot of pressure\nsometimes it feels like to always have\nto be I was joking about it with someone\nelse the other day like whenever I'm\naround someone I always feel the\npressure that I have to say something\nwise yeah because because that's the the\nkind of you know and so like when I'm\naround some it's kind of like being\naround a comedian and you they have to\nbe funny yeah like yeah I think it's\nexactly that I think it's exactly that\neven like with the funny thing sometimes\nyou know cuz I'm an online Troll and\nstuff I'm like I don't want to be funny\nright now I want to I want to I don't\nknow I want to eat this food and and you\nknow not really talk to you I want to\nscroll on my phone a little bit and eat\nthis food but the whole thing like even\nwith like Montero still like riding on\nmy back like we're talking about it\nright now and me like featuring the\nvideo and stuff and it's like that's\njust what I want to do it wasn't I'm not\nalways trying to like make a deep\nmessage I guess like I guess yeah if\nthat makes sense yeah so sometimes\nyou're just trying to have fun not even\njust trying to have fun it's just a lot\nof things I\ndo most things through my art are for me\nand just thankfully other people can see\nit as helping them it's coming as a form\nof self-healing and\nself-expression and then if it connects\nwith people I like I pray it connects\nwith you yes\nbut I don't know I'm not I'm not trying\nto be a martyr if that makes sense yeah\nI mean Rick Rubin was here a few months\nago and he was saying something similar\nhe was saying that he thinks that true\nart and true creativity is not made for\nconsumption yeah it is consumed and it\nis loved and it is connected with but it\nwasn't created thinking well how are we\ngoing to find the thing that connects\nit's creating something that comes from\nwithin would you agree with that does\nthat true I agree completely I like Rick\nrubben yeah yeah I like his book I only\nI only scam I only like skim through it\nbut I like it yeah yeah it's a great\nbook did you uh when when do you feel\nyou're connected to your most authentic\n360 self like what are you doing when\nyou feel that way because I know in the\ndocumentary\nit seemed like when you're with your\ndancers who are also your friends that\nfelt like a form of self-expression and\nconnectedness where you feel like you\ncan let go and be funny and be larger\nthan life and be creative would you say\nthat's where it comes through I'd say if\nanything it's when I'm creating\nmusic and I guess that's like the thing\nthat an artist should say or whatnot but\nit's the truth when I'm like making a\nsong\nand when I can completely like let go of\nhow it's going to be received I just\nfeel like one you know I feel like\neverything is come to me all my energy\nis not like all out into the world like\nevery like I feel like just one being\nlike connected to everything it's a\nfeeling like I I I Can't Describe like\nno amount of success will ever like\nequate to it I don't know if I'll ever\nlike find love that strong I hope so but\nbut yeah that's the uh I think that's\nthe thing we're all looking for right\nlike we're all searching for like and\nand it's almost like you can't\nmanufacture it like you can't engineer\nit either happens or it doesn't you\ncan't fake it yeah yeah you feel it\nsometimes and sometimes you don't yeah\nyeah you said you wanted to stay the\nacceptable gay person at first and you\ndidn't want to be the one that shoves it\ndown everyone's throats and then now\nwe're talking about again being\nauthentic I think we're all always\ntrying to we're always trying to play\nagain to what people around us wanting\nto be and then and then it comes out how\ndid you kind of go well no no no I'm not\ngoing to do that I am going to allow\nmyself to free myself I feel like it's a\npush and pull you know because of\ncourse there's still parts of me that\nyou know want to please the people\naround me you know I mean I I feel like\nthat's the whole idea of like something\nbeing successful a lot of the times we\ngot to make sure it's packaged enough to\nbe authentic but also able to be like\ndigestible at the same time I almost\nfeel like that's where we're all trying\nto exist there's this you you said\nsomething that resonated with me that I\nwas going to read something from F Scott\nFitzgerald yeah and so he has this\nbeautiful quote that I'm I'm fully\nobsessed with right now and it and it\nwhen I look at you as an individual this\nis and you can reflect on whether you\nhow you feel about it so he said that\nthe test of a First Rate\nintelligence is the ability to two\nopposing ideas in the mind at the same\ntime and still retain the ability to\nfunction in his words one should for\nexample be able to see that things are\nhopeless yet be determined to make them\notherwise but the way I'm reflecting on\nyou is this idea of like you want to be\ndoing things that are for the self but\nthen at the same time it needs to\nconnect to people like you want to be\nable to be who you are with your friends\nand your family and you realize that\nsome sometimes you got to tone down\nparts of yourself but then sometimes you\ndon't want to right we're constantly\ntrying to all of us are trying to be two\nthings almost yeah for sure why is it so\nhard then I don't know and I feel like\nthat goes back into the whole thing of\nlike we are like not in control\ncompletely of things like no matter what\nyou do how much preparation or whatnot\nit's not something you control like\npeople going to love stuff or they won't\nabsolutely you said about love there you\nmentioned how how does Finding Love play\nrole in your life when you\nknow this year is the first year since\n2021 that I'm going to be open to like\nfinding love because I was kind\nof very closed off to it it's like no no\nno I need to\nfocus I have these I have really really\nbig dreams I don't want to share with\neverybody yeah yeah I have really really\nbig dreams and it's\nlike I feel like anything that I can can\nsee as a distraction can get in my way\nbut at the same time like that whole\ncontradicting thing love can help\ninspire you to make like even greater\nart but but you know I wanted to just\nhave my like phase of being young and\nhaving fun with a lot of people you know\nwhat I mean yeah absolutely I know what\nyou mean yeah but don't you think again\nit's it's interesting right like it is\ndaunting I agree with you and yet I find\nthat most people of course everyone\nwants have a good time I'm like that too\nlike I love laughing I love having a\ngreat time and at the same time again\ntalking about the Paradox or the\ncontradiction I also want to have\nmeaningful connections because the last\nthing I want to do is have a superficial\nartificial like conversation with\nsomeone so it's like this it's funny how\nthe things we find daunting are often\nthings that even that person's kind of\nYearning For like I don't think anyone's\never had a really deeply meaningful\nconversation and then walked away from\nit going that was a waste of time right\nyou know I mean you're never going to\nsay that like you're never going to you\nknow like I I had a dinner with someone\nin London recently and it was a group of\nUs in in a similar industry and everyone\nwas being vulnerable and we were\nlaughing and connecting but everyone was\nsharing their pains and we walked away\nand no one was walking away going God\nthat was the worst dinner everyone's\ngoing yeah everyone's going that's the\none of the best dinners we've ever had\nand and I find that with artists it's\nit's it's hard to have that I guess like\nit's hard to find that and so do you do\nyou feel like the dance is a way you\nfind that like is that a place of safety\nand a place of Joy I feel like that's\ndefinitely a place of Joy yeah and I\ndon't like get super\nserious with them or barely like anyone\nfor for that matter you know it's only\nme yeah yeah for sure you know I I feel\nlike I share most of my like therapy\nsessions at home alone with myself and\nmy cats in the distance but yeah like\ntalking out loud to myself when all the\nvoices in my head are saying like the\nmost crazy terrible things you would\never hear a person say it's useful it's\nhelpful how how ridiculous can the voice\ninside your head get like what how far\nwill it go ridiculous as in like you\nknow the time that I told you about like\nthe hotel incident like it's\neasy when you're like down or in like a\nin like a hard place for all those\nvoices in your head to like gang up it's\nlike okay this is the time it's like\neverybody go go go and talking out loud\ncan be that Saving Grace of a factor\nlike no this isn't that bad this thing\nisn't that terrible we're going to get\nout of this thing we've been through\nworse we will go through worse we got to\nmake sure we get out of this thing so we\ncan know about the worst yeah you know\nwhat I mean yeah yeah so yeah like that\nthat helps a lot that's a great\ntechnique yeah I fully agree I think the\nwhen you're lost in your head and in the\nsilence oh my gosh you have no idea\nwhich voice to follow which voice to let\nlead it's the worst when you're like oh\nthis terrible voice has a point you know\nit's like this one this one saying\nsomething May maybe I should listen to\nIt's like no he's not like that's a\nterrible idea yeah have you ever used\nthat technique where you label certain\nvoices that you see as recurring and you\ngive them a name and a and a way because\nthey say that that's a great technique\nof your inner critic like giving it a\nname giving it a personality have you\nhave you noticed certain ones that keep\ncoming back I don't give them a name per\nse but as I said like I'm a spiritual\nbeing and I feel like just like me like\nI have my thoughts my wants and my\npurpose\nthat voice in my head was you know\ncreated by the universe it it has a job\nand I think its job is to give me just\nenough to fight against you know what I\nmean yeah yeah so it's like I don't hate\nthis voice it's like you're part of me\nwe're one we're together we're in this\ntogether you're doing your thing I'm\ntrying to do my thing you know but I\ncan't listen I can't listen to you on\nthis that that's powerful that that the\nability\nto not Yeah the more we\nright there's that famous saying that\nsays the more you resist it persists\nlike it just keeps persisting if you\nkeep kind of butting heads against it\nwhat you're saying is actually I don't\nhate it I just I recognize it's me I see\nI know that's that's your thing that's\nliterally why you're here I can't be mad\nat you for fulfilling your purpose like\nyeah yeah you that is that you do have\nthat quality like that ability to\nrecognize that everything has its place\nand everyone has their place where does\nthat come from the compassionate like\npart of me trying to make sense of\neverything I feel like it's so easy to\nlabel everything\nas as like a as like a demon or just\nlike a like a terrible just like dark\nthing but it's like this thing it's it\nexists it has emotions and it has\nfeelings just like you and it's just\ntrying to do its thing yeah there was\nthis one statement that reminds me of\nwhat you're saying now you said people\nfeel a lot of things about me but but\nboy do I love this kid yeah in the dark\nhow is how is that journey of I love\nthis little Mona this kid inside of me\nhow is that developed like what has that\ntaken for you to get to a place of being\nable to say that like I love this kid\nbecause I think that's a journey we're\nall on I think and it's like something\neverybody\nknows but we we forget a lot but we're\nliterally just all like the same person\nin like a different life path you know\nwhat I mean and once I can really just\nunderstand and recognize that every\nsingle person has like these thoughts or\nform of like these thoughts that I have\nin my head I know I shouldn't like feel\nbad about where I am or what I\nthink and you know what I'm doing\nbecause that's what this version of me\nis doing like that's that's where I am\nand I have to love him through it and\nlike understand that he's going to make\nthese you know mistakes and he's going\nto have accomplishments and he's going\nto have great times and he's going to\nhave bad times and he's going to do\namazing things and he's going to do\nterrible things and and it's like um I\nhave to uh allow him to grow through\nthat and me joining the world or anybody\nelse and being hard on this kid is not\ngoing to help yeah I was just saying the\nother day I was saying to someone you\ncan't guilt yourself into growth it's\nimpossible like you can't shame yourself\nor embarrass yourself into becoming\nbetter that when was the last time you\nmade someone feel guilty and they were\nlike yeah I'm going to be the best\nperson in the world now like it doesn't\nwork that way yeah I\nthink cliche as it is like you know love\nis really the the answer for that how\ndoes it feel I know you're going to go\ntoday or tomorrow to show your family\nthe documentary like how does that make\nyou feel to be a for them to be able to\nsee this I think I'm want to be very\nlike self-conscious you know the whole\ntime like yeah just just like oh my God\nlike what are they thinking about this\nand you know I've said things this\ndocumentary that they've never heard me\nwow like say you know or my perspective\non like a lot of different things and\neven them you know talking about them\nand how I\nfeel close or not close with them yeah\nit's a lot alth although it comes yeah\nit comes\nacross I'm hoping in a way that they can\ndigest it there's a lot of love you have\nfor your nephew yeah and your\nrelationship of him not wanting to see\nyou\ndifferently uh how is how is that\nrelationship like progressed and because\nhow old is he he's young he's 11 he's\nabout to be 12 this year I feel like you\nknow he's he's one of the only people in\nmy family that calls me like 247 wow and\nand I just really like appreciate that\ncuz you know before they get to like\ntheir age where they're just like too\ncool and whatnot I'm happy to have like\nthat person that's still I don't know is\ninspired by me or still like loves me\nlike all the\nsame and and yeah yeah throughout\neverything what would he say to you when\nhe's calling you up like what's the what\nwhat is he doing what's a 12-year-old\nsay you know kids like he will call and\nkind of just like say yo what's up and\nthen just be like silent for a minute\nand and then then it's like yeah I've\nbeen on fortnite and like stuff like\nthis like kid stuff and I I love that it\nit makes things much smaller cu in my\nhead where I have all these things that\nI feel like are the big grandest like\nproblems of my life and blah blah blah\nyou know he's he's like in school like\ntrying to get his grade up in science\nyou know what I mean it's like these\nthings yeah it it keeps\nme it keeps me like down to earth yeah\nyeah it's like when my mom calls me\nup and I've been doing you know whatever\ncrazy thing and then she's like have you\neaten today like that's what she cares\nabout yeah yeah she's like have you had\nyour lunch like have you taken your\nvitamins like that's what my mom would\nsay to me I'm like Mom like I'm at the\nWhite House or whatever it is she's just\nlike yeah you had your vitamins it's the\nbest thing though yeah it keeps you\ngrounded keeps you connected and you're\nright like so often we just start\ngetting lost in this you know this big\nvision of what we're doing and what\nwe're creating and it kind of just pops\nthe bubble like you know they come along\nand just yeah it's not that it makes it\nmuch like smaller and easier to meain in\nthe way yeah yeah you said something\nabout the family that really resonated\nyou said how can we get everyone in a\nhouse within five years without me\npaying for it and I was like you know\nwhat does that new level of relationship\nof desire mean to you like what is what\nare you trying to create there or where\ndoes that thought come from I feel like\nthat opens a\nbigger like question or like current\nlike problem in my\nlife I'm like not a little boy anymore\nlike like I'm a grown man and I have to\ntake on like this this like leadership\nrole and I feel like once you break\nSociety down everything is still like\ntribes and whatnot and I have tribes you\nknow like like on my family like like\nthis is my tribe or you know like my my\nteam around me in my career like this is\nmy tribe I have to get in the front of\nthis and try to figure things out and\nlike try to understand like how do these\npeople work best like how can I get you\nyou know to doing your best thing and\nhow can I get you to doing your best\nthing so we can all progress cuz of\ncourse you know I got to get myself\nright first before I do anything but\nit's like also I have to understand like\nhow can I help you I'm in this place I\nbelieve the universe s me\nhere to try to try to fix things you\nknow it's like how do I build your\nconfidence up like with my brothers and\nsisters like how do I build your\nconfidence of us all these people that\ngrew up in these places where we've been\ntold over and over now Life by even each\nother and our family members and and the\nworld that we're not like how do I get\nyou the confidence to to chase your own\ndream or if your dream's not something\nlike grand grand you know how do I get\nyou to I don't know be on my team and\njust something where you're happy and\nit's so hard to get people organized and\norganize things and realize that this is\nsomething I have to do because if I\ndon't do it it it may not get done you\nknow what I mean yeah yeah yeah and but\nyeah I'm I'm I'm at that place where I'm\ntrying to figure that out yeah I can\nunderstand that it's it's hard because\nyou got so many roles on your team then\nthere's family there's friends coming up\nI mean it's it's hard and it's hard to\nput everyone on too I mean I've spoken\nto so many people who you know today\nlike top musicians artists actors who've\nhad that years ago where friends wanted\nto move from their Hometown and come and\njoin the team and then sometimes they\ndidn't want to put in the work and some\nsometimes they did and sometimes they\nmade it like I know a friend of mine\nwho's this person used to seat people at\nhis shows 30 years ago and today she's\ndirecting documentaries with him that's\namazing right and it's like a beautiful\njourney and it's amazing for them to\nhave but then on the other end you've\nalso got friends who were given a root\nout but then they let the money and the\nfame and the drugs and alcohol and\neverything consumed them and you\nrecognize it's almost like you can only\ngive people opportunities but they've\ngot to take them for themselves yeah and\nthat's that's hard like come to grips\nwith you know like you can give as many\nlike speeches or or talks or like as\nmuch guidance as you want but it's just\nso hard to help some people up yeah it\nis it is but that's something that feels\nimportant to you yeah something that\nfeels important it's Al something that\nyou know it crushes you a little bit you\nknow back to that whole like factor of\nyou can't control this thing yeah you\ncan't there's nothing you can do about\nthis yeah I feel like this is this is\nnot a question that me and you can solve\nhere at all because it is almost the\nquestion of life but it's\nlike how do we how do we deal with our\nlack of control every day like how how\ndo we deal with the fact that we can't\ncontrol things or how do you deal with\nthe fact that you can't control\neverything in in in all of these areas\nyeah how have you have you found any\ncoping mechanisms I have oh cool okay\nand I've have one main coping mechanism\nand it's so silly but it helps me\nthrough life a lot I'm excited\nand it's like dude you're a gummy bear\nand I know it doesn't make sense I love\ngummy bears so I'm listening but it's\nlike all of\nthis is in our head it's all like a\njourney and in the grand scheme of\nthings as this individual I am just a\ngummy bear it's not that serious it's\nnot that deep keep moving forward of\ncourse it's a contradiction because it's\neverything to me it means everything to\nme it's it's it's my whole being but\nit's it's like but I'm also a gummy bear\nso it doesn't really matter if this\nthing you know it doesn't matter like\ndude relax you know so it's like a fight\nbetween those two but that me being a\ngummy bear is like one of the only\nthings that's going to get me through\nthis really hard thing that I'm fight\nfighting or facing you know what I mean\nyeah yeah yeah I like that I like that\nI've never heard it put that way so I\nlike it I like that it's silly it's uh\nyeah the idea of embracing our own\ninsignificance it's like we have our\nsignificance we know what we're doing is\nimportant but at the same time we got to\nembrace the insignificance of the\nirrelevance like yeah like relax like\nyeah it's not that serious it's super\nserious but it's not that\nserious yeah that's a funny conversation\ninside for sure yeah there's another\nthing that came up was you said that if\nI settle into a house I feel like I'll\nhave to be there forever and there's\nthis idea of like you know there's a\nshot in the documentary with all your\nsuitcases there and you're like not sure\nabout the couch and I was wondering like\nwhere does the fear of being somewhere\nforever come from I think it's like the\nwhole idea of like becoming comfortable\nyou know and of course I do have like\ncouches and stuff now I have like a new\ncouch and I have like my cats which I\nwas very like hesitant to do but you\nknow I was I was very afraid of getting\nlike super comfortable with my like\nHollywood Life you know I have like my\nhouse and stuff and now I'm going to get\nall my my Grammy's over here and I'm\ngoing to put my couch right there and\nhere's my Mona Lisa painting like stuff\nlike that I was very fearful that once I\ndid that I'm just going to like relax\nall the\ntime but now I I I see it differently\nit's like I want to relax sometimes to\nkeep myself sane and I am going to like\nput my house together because there's\nnothing wrong with that and I have to\nlive because as I said like this goes by\nso fast I'm 24 like going on 25 and I\nfeel like like two days ago I was 19 you\nknow yeah I I feel like your home has to\nbe a sanctuary for you whatever that\nmeans for you like it fills and fuels\nyou up for the crazy life you live\nbecause I'm sure you're going on tour\nagain you will go on multiple tours\nacross your lifetime like the time that\nyou are spending there you want it to be\ncomfortable you want it to be\nre-energizing what does that look to you\nwhat does rest look like for you now\nlike what is taking a break look like to\nyou because you are someone who's\nambitious and hardworking and driven but\nnow to get back up on that I think I\nhave one main thing and it's super\nsimple it's going to see a movie I like\nto go and see a movie like I don't know\nsome once maybe twice sometimes even\nthree times like a week and that's like\nmy escapism moment or like my moment of\nlike rest or away from everything you\nknow like during my time you know when I\ndropped the artwork uh for my last\nsingle and like it was like a hellscape\nI went to see this movie called\nmigration which is like this animated\nmovie about like birds like flying\nplaces and it's just like this fun like\nchildlike movie and I was there I was in\nthat movie that was my rest that was my\npeace that was my sense you know what I\nmean yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I love\nthat I love going to the movies too was\nthat the most recent thing you saw or\nwas there anything else that kind of uh\nwhat's been the best movie you've seen\nthis year with the Oscars are coming up\ntoo I I want to see like poor things but\nit was very dark great movie but very\ndark seen what was yeah what was it like\nI haven't seen it yet what was it like\nyeah it was like um Emma Stone just\ngiving like an amazing performance it\nwas also like this movie that was so\nweird nothing like what I've seen before\nlike very like AR Aster like Vibes you\nknow what I mean right yeah yeah yeah\nI'm glad you're not giving away I really\nwant to see I don't want to give away\nthat entire really want to see it yeah\nI'm looking forward to I love going to\nmovies too I'm a big big I loved\nOppenheimer last year that have you seen\nthat yet I saw Oppenheimer but it wasn't\nfor me it wasn't for me I'm a Nolan I'm\na Nolan fan Christopher Nolan fan and\nlike every movie he makes I'm like I\nlove it when well Au I got more of\ntennet was the one that was the hardest\none to get I don't know if you ever saw\nthat I like ten it I didn't get it but I\nlike it yeah yeah yeah yeah he makes\nmovies I love his movies because he's\nalways creating things where it's not\nset up to be consumed like the average\nmovie like you got to you have think\nabout it you have to look up and go on a\nform or something and try to understand\nit yeah I'm that guy like looking at\nevery little graphic explaining like the\ntime frame and and and everything that\ncomes with it uh Mona what is it that\nyou know what are what are you excited\nabout over the next you know 12 months\nfor you what's something that's\ninspiring pulling you and uh pushing you\nforward right now for the next 12 months\nI think the main thing I'm I'm focused\non\nis uh picking myself up out of\nthis this uh hole that I like feel that\nI'm in you know what I mean\nand trying to figure out which songs of\nthe hundreds or whatnot I've been\nworking on suit me best for going\nforward yeah and what does that process\nlook like like how do you how do you\nactually do that in an actionable\npractical way I guess trying to feel\nwhich ones feel real to me and back to\nthe other thing but are also like\nconsumable you know what I mean yeah and\nhow do you judge that because I guess\nlike how do you as an artist even are\nyou just trusting intuition is there\ndata is there prayer like how yeah what\nis that intuition plus like I feel like\nspiritual like\nSigns yeah walk me through the spiritual\nsigns I like that for example in my my\nlast song you know um my last single uh\nJ Christ like I I was kind of hesitant I\nwas like is this is this where I'm going\nto get me to the next place and every\ntime I would think about it I would\nmagically like see AC cross in the\ndistance or something like that I was\nlike okay this is a part of my journey\nthis is something this is a threshold I\nhave to cross through to get to the\nother side or for example um another one\nand I was worried about like releasing\ncall me by her name I was just like oh\nmy God I don't know if I should and then\ngood days by like siss it comes on the\nradio you know and I'm just like ah and\nthen the most beautiful like sun sunrise\nhappens at the exact same time I'm just\nlike okay this is you know what I mean\nand I guess it's like things that are in\neveryday life but I don't mistake that\nfor just being everyday life like this\nis meant to be yeah this has to happen\nthis way when did you start looking for\nthose or noticing those in your life I\nthink when I first moved to LA and I\nfelt like\num communicating you know I felt like I\nwas talking to my angels I it wasn't it\nwas like magic you know what I mean like\nlike seeing like angel numbers like I\nbelieve in angel numbers a lot I'll give\nyou a story so I'm like sitting at this\nCafe it's breakfast time Oldtown roll\nyou know just hit like number one on the\ncharts I'm already thinking in my head\nthough I'm moving to La I'm not going to\nreally like be super you know with my\nfamily and whatnot like I'm going to do\nmy own thing now and I started seeing\nlike this number it was and then I\nlooked up what the number meant and it\nwas like you need\nto you know bring your family together\nbasically it was like you need to spend\nmore time with your family to bring your\nfamily together I was like um I was like\num no I don't\nI don't think I'm gonna do that and I\njust started seeing that number over and\nover and over and then I called my I\ncalled my uh my siblings I was like I\nwant to have our first like uh what's it\ncalled family reunion and I did that\nthing and I started seeing a different\nnumber and I looked up what that number\nmeant and it was just like you're on the\nright path like and and I kept seeing\nthat number over and over you know what\nI mean yeah so it was it was\nsomething it was something like that\nyeah yeah wow yeah and and then that's\nand that's been almost a discovery for\nyou as opposed to something you were\ntaught or trained or heard or learned\nit's been selftaught yeah and it and\nit's also like something that felt very\nreal because you know at that time like\nI wasn't spiritual at all you know I\ndidn't believe in any of the stuff and I\nwas just like okay yeah I see I I feel\nlike you guys are there I don't\nunderstand you completely but yeah yeah\nand what do you like when you're like\ncan't see the sign or you can't find the\nanswer is there something that helps you\nkind of realign or reconnect I feel like\nat that point I just have to trust what\nI feel in my heart you know and I feel\nlike there's a there's a calm sense when\nI know something is right there's like\na there like a washing of okay this is\ngood yeah I can't explain it yeah yeah I\nget that yeah I mean that that's the\nbeauty of trying to explain in words\nthings that are experienced intangibly\nright it's it's hard it's it's it's\nchallenging but I think anyone who's I\nknow a lot of our community and our\naudience is able to see signs or knows\nwhat their signs are and their\nexperiences and what they are and I\nofficiated a wedding in\nDecember and the individual who's\ngetting married always loves the uh\ncolor blue and sees her father's\npresence as a butterfly and when I was\nleading the ceremony there was a moment\nin the ceremony that I asked everyone to\nclose their eyes and meditate with us\nand then we open our eyes and some of us\nstill had our eyes closed and a blue\nbutterfly literally just flew right\nthrough the garden it was only one it\nwasn't like we're in a butterfly park or\nor something like that and I can see\nthat you you can sense your and it was\njust it was beautiful like it was one of\nthose moments where everyone after was\nlike did you see the blue butterfly\nbecause they know how important it is to\nthe bride and it was just this magical\nmoment of you know for her to have her\nfather's Presence at her wedding who was\nno longer with us beautiful man yeah it\nwas really really special so yeah I\nthink for those for those who are on\nthat path who are aware of those things\nI'm sure they'll they'll resonate with\nwhat you're saying yeah yeah it's\nbeautiful Montero we end every episode\nwith a final five uh these are the Fast\nFive they can only be answered in one\nword to one sentence
