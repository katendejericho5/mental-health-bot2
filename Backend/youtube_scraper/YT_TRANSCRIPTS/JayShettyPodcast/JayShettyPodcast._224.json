    "transcript": "I feel like I found the\nperson who\nhas helped me continue self-\nrevaluation in a way that I would have\navoided with someone else or that I\nwould have tried to avoid if I would\nhave had multiple love stories whereas\nthis life story that I have with my wife\ncurrently is just the most\npurifying and cleansing detoxifying\nprocess in internally but in the most\nfun loving and caring way and I look at\nthat and I I think about that often\nwhere I think to\nmyself I would have had to learn these\nlessons with\nanyone but maybe someone else may not be\nable to challenge me as much as my wife\ndoes with the lack of criticism and\ncomplain and judgment in a safe space\nwith humor which actually makes\nit accessible to me"
