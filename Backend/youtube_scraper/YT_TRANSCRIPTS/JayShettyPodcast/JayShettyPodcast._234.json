    "transcript": "there's such a thing as knowing too much\nyou've been married to the president of\nthe United States who knows everything\nabout everything in the world sometimes\nyou just the phenomenally successful\nauthor please welcome a former first\nlady of these United States Michelle\nObama I want people looking at me and\nBarack like # couples goals no no there\nare some broken things that happen even\nin the best of marriages what is the\nthing that keeps you up at night\nnow before we jump into this episode I'd\nlike to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nshett J shett the one the only\nJett\nMichelle thank you so much for joining\nme on purpose this is such an honor I'm\nso grateful to have you here I'm\nthrilled to be here I'm a fan oh that's\nthat is that that means more to me than\nyou know thank you so much and I'll dive\nstraight in what is the best part about\nbeing you I have never thought about\nthat that is a great question I think my\nfamily my friendships I think one of the\nthings that Barack and I we always talk\nabout is that we're proud of the fact\nthat we've kept our community you know\npeople that we've known all our lives\nare still a part of that community that\nkeeps us solid and keeps us whole and\ngrounded it's easy to lose your head on\nthis journey that we've been on and I\nthink what keeps us focused is that\nwe've had we have some solid people in\nour lives and we make it a point to\ncultivate those relationships and to\nlearn to be in intentional about them\nand I think that that's probably one of\nthe coolest things is that you know I've\ngot this big kitchen table of people who\nkeep me focused and and keep me honest\nyeah what's the longest friendship there\nnon-family like what's the years would\nyou say the longest friendship I mean\ngosh childhood friendships I I still\nhave um I've sort of picked up friends\nthroughout every part of my life you\nknow I've got one or two I've got the\nhigh school friends that I keep in touch\nwith the college friends the law school\nfriends you know so you sort of gather\npeople throughout um and I've I've had a\nlot of people who've sort of just hung\nin there before we were the Obamas yeah\nhow how does that work I feel like so\nmany people who are on their Journey a\nlot of us don't take steps forward\nbecause we're scared of what our friends\nwill think some of us get carried away\nwith success and ego and pride goes to\nyour head and then you alienate people\nsometimes it's envy and jealousy from\neveryone else who didn't join you on the\njourney how do you navigate a multi-\ndeade level friendship when everyone is\ngoing through so much what are the kind\nof key Milestones of maintaining that\nkitchen table you know I I talk about\nthis journey like climbing Mount Everest\nyou start not that I've ever done that\nby the way but what I've heard about\nclimbing Mount Everest is that you you\nstart out at base camp and then you hit\nthese Summits along the way and\neverybody starts out the journey ready\nyou know they think I'm going to make it\nto the top and then you start the climb\nand some people are ready for it and\nsome people aren't and it's\nsurprising that you learn along the\nclimb who's really ready and there are\npeople who just emotionally physically\ncan't go the whole way run out of oxygen\nyou know they weren't fit for the climb\nright and one of the hardest things is\nlike when you discover that I mean do\nyou do you stop do you go back because\nthere was one member that wasn't ready\nor do you keep climbing and sort of\nleave them where they are and we found\nthat that's kind of been the the pattern\nright wow there are people who have been\nthey they were built for the climb like\nwe were and some weren't and I I find\nthat I I talk to young people about this\ntoo because when you're a kid coming\nfrom nothing um and I won't say that I\ncame from nothing but Barack nor I came\nfrom wealth or connection or fame or\nFortune um so we have a hodgepodge of\npeople in our lives and one of the\ntoughest things is to find out that a\ndear friend wasn't ready for the climb\nand in order to keep pressing forward we\ntell young people that sometimes you got\nto leave them there because you can't\ncarry people when you're trying to get\nto the top um it slows you down um but\nthere's you know survivors remorse that\ncomes with it and I know there you know\na lot of times when I talk to kids and I\nsee them well up I see in them that\nstruggle that they've reached a point\nwhere they've left people they love\nbehind and they struggle to figure out\nhow to whether or how to maintain those\nconnections and it becomes hard hard and\nit's draining you know kids for example\nwho got the opportunity to go to college\nwhen half their family isn't eating yes\nright and they've got a student loan and\nthey need to use that loan to pay for\ntheir books but they're trying to send\nmoney back home to pay the electric bill\nand I tell those kids like if you want\nto make it you've got to make some hard\nchoices about what to do with your life\nor you will not make the climb yourself\nand then everyone loses and then\neverybody loses and and I think that's\nhow we've had to look at it we've been\nfortunate enough that we've had so many\npeople who were ready for the climb they\nhad to adjust they had to go back and do\na little working out but for the most\npart they've made it but for the people\nwho couldn't we had to leave them behind\nand keep climbing and if once we made it\nto the top if we could reach back and\npull some others up we definitely did\nthat it is one of the greatest\nchallenges uh when you are pursuing a\nlife that is Dr drastically different\nfrom the one that you've come from is\nthere such a thing as a graceful end\nwell it depends on who's doing the\nending right yes sometimes you know\nsometimes I say there's such a thing as\nthe slow\nghost you know\nwhere you just sort of let relationships\ntake their natural course friendships\nand relationships kind of tell you when\nthey're ready yeah that's so true and\nyou have to kind of listen to it you you\nlearn as you get older you know\nsometimes you held on too long you let\nsome you know bad uh Juju stay around\ntoo too long and as you get older you\nyou can recognize right I've always\napproached life and friendships and I\ntry to tell my daughters this too is\nstay open stay open to the possibility\nof people I never want my daughters and\nI never wanted to feel so high that I\nwas closed off and suspicious you know\nnot wanting to let new people in right\nand that becomes very difficult when\nyou're the president and the first lady\nyou know you could you know close your\nlife off so much right because everyone\nmight want something from you but I\nalways felt like well that's a loss you\nknow because if you close everybody out\nthen you miss some gems we've tried to\nbe open and find ways to let new people\nin our lives and develop new\nrelationship\nships and what I tell my kids is trust\nyour gut because you'll know when people\nshould be let out but keep keep your\naperture wide open let people in but\nwhen they show you who they are let them\nout quickly and as older you get you you\nknow it's like yeah that wasn't that\nthis one isn't working out so let's just\ncut it quick but stay open and you're\nnaturally going to make mistakes you're\nnaturally going to get hurt you're\nnaturally not going to read everyone\nperfectly so true that's going to happen\nbut it's better to be aware note down\nthe lesson but be open in the first\nplace because being closed is worse you\nmiss you miss out on the goodness the\npossibility the opportunity the the new\nright and I never want to miss out on\nthe new I I'd rather keep give people\nthe benefit of of the doubt bring them\nin and and let them disappoint me it's\nlike I I can deal with disappointment I\ncan be I can I can get over hurt but I\ndon't want to lose the possibility of\nsomeone special coming in wow that's the\ngreater tradeoff so powerful and it's\nproven to be the right approach you know\nwe we've just met some wonderful people\nalong this journey and gosh if I had\nclosed myself off to that I oh I think\nof the friendships the influences that I\nwouldn't have had so I want my girls to\nstay open you know I want them to be\nopen People yes I had a mentor in London\nprobably around 10 years ago and he\ndevised this set of questions that gives\nyou your personality type and there's so\nmany tests like this but his was really\ninteresting and it's very aligned with\nyour thinking so and he also had types\nwhere we'd get locked and he'd call this\nCS C he said The more closed the more\nspecific and the more controlling you\nget the less you're able to actually\nconnect grow evolve learn and he would\nalways say as you're saying the more\nopen random and supportive you are the\nmore likely you are to be able to invite\npeople into your life at different times\nand I I love hearing that because I like\nthat yeah it was yeah that change from\nclose OH Close selective and controlling\nto open random and supportive he was\nsaying you never know you could have a\nrandom interaction with someone it could\nbe the most beautiful lesson of your\nlife and and I also felt that you know\nwhen you're the president of the United\nStates and the first lady you have to be\nopen you have to be open to all the\npossibilities you can't live in your\nFortress and govern the people right and\nI think we benefited from the fact that\nwe had to figure out how to be regular\npeople in the white house because we had\nkids in school and so we couldn't become\njust White House people we had to get to\nknow that community and go to parent\nteacher conference and make friends with\nother parents because we wanted our\nkids' lives to be normal but that in a\nway kept me connected with people and\nwhat they were really feeling and what\ntheir challenges were and it keeps me\nopen and empathetic to people because\nI'm engaged and I'm not sitting in my\ncastle looking out at everybody else\nabsolutely so I found it particularly\nnecessary\nabsolutely yeah so that's the best thing\nthat's beautiful what has been the worst\nor the hardest part about being you well\nI think it's the flip side of that coin\nof that when you're on the top of Mount\nEverest it can be isolating and uh\ndystopic in a way you know I think one\nof the greatest things that we've\nlearned to appreciate in this role and I\nI tell young people this especially\nyoung people who think they want fame\nyou know it's like do you know what that\nis you know are you grasping for\nsomething that you have no idea or your\nparents pushing you towards this thing\nis that when you become famous\nwell-known you lose your anonymity\nthat's a tough thing to lose Sur Price\nRight cost it's a huge Price Right the\nnatural\neveryday thing of of sitting and being\nable to sit in the world and observe it\nand not be observed right I mean wow\nthat's a really interesting way of\nputting it yeah yeah just sort of\nsitting in a park and watching the world\nhappen with nobody pulling you out of it\nright the simple walk through a park or\nstanding in line at the grocery store\nand overhearing life we don't have that\nyou know we don't have spontaneity in\nthe same way and that's a hard thing to\nlose now here's the thing fortunately we\nlost it we lost it in our\n40s I just think of kids who are\nreaching for it not knowing that you\nyou're about to lose a really valuable\nthing you want to you're striving to\nlose it and you're only 18 20 you don't\nwant to lose your an anonymity you don't\nwant to trade that off for anything in\nthe world because once you lose it you\nlose a lot more we've adjusted right\nbecause we're adults\nso yes I can figure out how to make one\nmove go on a walk visit a friend but I\nhave to call like 12 people and I have\nto think about the movements and\nsecurity has to be lined up we can't do\nthe ordinary things of life you know go\nto a movie theater or I joked at covid\nwhen people asked when we were all in\nquarantine how did it feel and I was\nlike well it was kind of easy for us\nbecause we've lived in\nquarantine for like you know a decade\nand so you learn to live in this smaller\nfootprint but it's that's a tough thing\nthat I don't think people think about\nwhen they think of power and fame and\nthere there's some downsides to it yeah\nand what do what do people want the most\nfrom you and because I love the idea of\nwhat you were saying of being open it's\nthat mindset is so special I guess when\nthat when you are open and then you said\nyou can get over that hurt what is the\nhurt that you usually have to get over\nor most commonly that you've had to well\nthe maybe hurt is too strong of a word\num again because we're older it's just\nthe loss of a piece of yourself right\nyou know I mean people always ask me I\nwas in Chicago the other day and every\ntime I go back to Chicago people are\nlike do you miss Chicago I miss the\nChicago that we knew before we were here\nwow it's powerful yeah that Chicago is\nis no longer available to us to you yes\nyeah you know the way we loved it in\nthat way and that's that's a loss is it\na hurt is it personal no it's just the\nway life is but it's still a loss you\nknow my husband loves New York and it\nwas interesting he thought for a second\nbecause he's been more isolated than me\nMH he thought for a minute when we leave\nthe White House we'll live in New York\nand I was like dude you can't live in\nNew York\nand it's just he cannot access the\nwonderful city of New York in the way\nthat he remembered when he was in his\n20s because guess what we can't do we\ncan't walk down the street we can't get\non the subway we can't necessarily walk\nthrough Central Park without a big plan\nyou know the things that make New York\nNew York we can't access it that's the\npart I don't you know the people part\nthe connection to people part I never\nget exhausted by that because I'm open\nright so it's not\nthe right it's just the way you want to\nlive your life especially when you're\nopen right you want to be open you want\nto be in the midst of people and we've\nlost that absolutely I think what's\nbeautiful about this book The Light we\ncarry and becoming is it shows us just\nhow many trials\nchallenges setbacks that you've had to\novercome and that you've gone through in\nyour life so elegantly gracefully\ntactfully you know with with so much\ndetermination and drive and I'm\nintrigued that after having overcome so\nmuch like you said climbing Mount\nEverest using that as our as our\nanalogy what is the thing that keeps you\nup at night now or what is is your\nbiggest fear now after having overcome\nso many it has less to do with me\npersonally and more to do with the world\nthat we're in there's such a thing as no\nknowing too much M and when you've been\nmarried to the president of the United\nStates who knows everything about\neverything in the world sometimes you\njust want to turn you know too much\nright it's like I don't know I don't\nwant to know what was in that folder\nthat you just got that made you quiet\nyou know I don't want to know why the\nsecurity just pulled you over I mean it\ncould be any range of things that comes\nacross the desk of the leader of the\nFree World right so I know a lot about\nwhat's going on and what keeps me up are\nthe things that I know um the war in the\nregion in too many regions what is AI\ngoing to do for us the environment you\nknow are we moving at all fast enough\nwhat are we doing about education are\npeople going to vote and why aren't\npeople voting are we too stuck to our\nphones I mean those are the things that\nkeep me up because you you don't have\ncontrol over them and you wonder where\nare people where are we in this you know\nwhere are our hearts what's going to\nhappen in this next election I am\nterrified about what could possibly\nhappen because our leaders matter who we\nselect who speaks for us who holds that\nbullied Pulpit it affects us in ways\nthat sometimes I think people take for\ngranted you know the fact that people\nthink that government n you know is is\nit does it really even do anything and\nI'm like oh my God does government do\neverything for us and we cannot take\nthis democracy for granted and sometimes\nI I worry that we do those are the\nthings that keep me up what what habits\nhave you developed because I think\npeople may not have access to the news\nyou do but I think people can definitely\nrelate yes yes to what you're saying of\nlike absolutely J I'm just seeing all\nthe news on my phone I'm connected to\nthe TV I'm hearing things from friends\nand family like I think a lot of people\ncan relate to you saying I feel like I\nknow too much\nrules\nyoued\nyouring to you it's not just a news\nupdate it's a folder it's the person\ncalling it's a private meeting whatever\nit may be you're in one sense it's even\nmore extreme because you're so privy to\nthe actual reality as opposed to a news\nchannel which is part of reality yeah\none of the most important practices is\nis deliberately turning that off for a\nmoment or more than a moment and I\nencourage that I think our phones are\nsort of the regular man's equivalent to\nwhat I just described we're too\nconnected all the time we're reading too\nmuch we're taking too much in we are\nconstantly being fed by images and\nthat's become the norm and it's we we've\nbeen sort of marketed that that's cool\nthat's what we should want but our\nbrains are not we are we are not that\nsophisticated a species yeah we have not\nevolved enough to be able to take in\nthat much information on a constant\nbasis and our kids certainly are not\nprepared to handle it I think that plays\na huge role in the higher rates of\ndepression and suicide among young\npeople they've got to let their brains\nrest from the noise even though you know\nwe're all trying to fix everything\neveryone needs a break from it right so\nI'm very deliberate about knowing that I\ncan't take all that in and and and we're\ngetting it in such a sort of\nmisinterpreted way right we've got you\nknow confirmation bias we're reading\nonly what we already believe and I know\nI have to be very deliberate about you\nknow understanding that a lot of the\ninformation I'm getting isn't even\ncomplete I do filter you know and then I\nI develop habits that shut my brain off\nto thinking right I I wrote In The Light\nabout knitting you know which is a a\nhabit that I I developed a hobby that I\ndeveloped over quarantine and that's\nbecause it makes you so present and so\nit engaged it it shuts your brain down\nand allows your your hands the motion to\ntake over and in that way I found that\nit is meditative right um and that's\nwhat meditation is it's quieting your\nnoisy mind and some of us can't connect\nto meditation but I think we need it I I\nthink biologically we need to shut that\npart of ourselves down to get a rest\nfrom it and I find that knitting does it\nexercise does it um learning something\nphysical shuts my mind down I mean I've\ntaken up tennis and there's nothing that\nshuts my mind down then running after a\ngreen ball and trying to figure out move\nyour feet hit the ball follow through\nit's like yeah um that shuts my mind\ndown for the hour or 90 minutes that I'm\ndoing that thing I'm not worrying you\nknow I'm breathing I'm outside I'm\nletting the sun hit my face I am those\nhabits and routines of creating\nsomething right and we're do we do that\nless and less now it's like everything\nis all in the mind it's all technology\nbut I think we need something where the\nthing I I love about knitting is that at\nthe end of it I've made something you\nknow it's it's it's just satisfying in a\nvery different way from problem solving\nor analysis yes right building creating\npainting drawing fixing putting\nsomething real into the world that came\nfrom your own hands yes something small\nyou know that's why I talk about the\npower of small in the light we carry\nbecause a lot of times our brains are\ntrying to do the Big Fix and that's when\nwe feel hopeless and we're tired\nbecause most of us don't have the power\nto fix anything at a big scale but we\ncan focus on the small things that we\nhave control over you know making a\nsweater for your daughter helping Mentor\na child in your neighborhood loving the\nchildren you bring into the world and\nmaking sure they have everything they\nneed that's where change happens right\nand when I do those kinds of activities\nI meditate into that power right that\nsmall power that there is satisfaction\nfrom hitting a stupid ball over a net\nyes you know and getting a good swing\nout of it it's like it makes the day\nbetter because I served the ball right\nor I finished a\nscarf I love no you're so right and I'm\nso glad you're using the word shutting\ndown and this switch to analog I\nremember at one point and I think\neveryone can relate to this you wake up\nto your phone I'd be brushing my teeth\nI'm on my phone I'm eating breakfast I'm\non my phone you know just your phone is\nnow Tethered to your hand in every\nactivity that you're doing throughout\nthe day and so your brain is never\nshutting down and the interesting thing\nis we all know our phones need a reset\nthey need a update they need a software\nrefresh or whatever it may be and I\nthink I saw somewhere that the human\nbrain today has to process like 74\ngigabytes worth of information a day\nyeah a day and I was thinking I remember\nwhen your phone doesn't you know it's a\nlot and when you think about it this is\na brand new technology right you know\nwhen we got into the White House we\ncould we had blackberries right wow yeah\nuh social media wasn't a thing right all\nof that came into being in the eight\nyears that we were in the white house\nand it's just gone off like a rocket\nship we don't evolve that quickly you\nknow humans it takes generations for us\nto evolve we haven't adapted to this New\nMedia we haven't we have not\nbiologically adapted MH and so no wonder\nwe're stressed yes no wonder we're we're\nfull of anxiety um no wonder our kids\nare struggling you know because we we\nhave a new technology and we've just we\nwe've taken it in Hook Line in Sinker\nwe're not even questioning how much you\nknow the more the marier right I think\nwe need to be very mindful about this\nnew Gadget yes and we have to be mindful\nfor our kids because they have no filter\nright they'll just be thumbing through\nthis stuff you know their their mind's\nnever sleeping and as parents of my\ngeneration we know so little about it we\ndon't we don't even know how to monitor\nit m it's like cigarettes right is it\ngood for us I mean at one point\neverybody smoked until we realized oops\nthis isn't really really good for us\nright I think we we have to be cautious\nabout this this new thing that we're\njust lapping up yeah an article a few\nyears ago exactly it was saying that\ntoday\nwe absorb in one day in 24 hours the\nsame amount of tragedy we would in our\nentire lifetime 25 years ago today we\nabsorb what we would in our entire\nlifetime in one day and it felt real and\nthat's why people feel more panicked I\nmean Barack my husband is a he's a\nfact-based guy he's a Science Guy\nsometimes it's not popular the days\nright having a president that believes\nin facts and Science and all that stuff\nbut he's one of those people and he\nalways says you know statistically\nspeaking especially when young people\nbemoan where we are today he says you\nknow if you look at history and\nstatistics if you were to pick any time\nin human history to be born MH you'd\nwant to be born now M crime War those\nrates are at the lowest\nbut nobody feels that people feel more\nunsafe why because they're they're\ngetting fed images of every crime that\nhappens anywhere everywhere right and\nwhen we were growing up you just heard\nyour local news you know it's just like\noh there was a fire or that kid you know\nand you know now we're getting\neverything not just from our community\nbut all over the world stuff that's\nalways been happening we just didn't\nknow about it yes we now we know too\nmuch yes and we're interpreting that to\nmean things are horrible we went through\nworld wars and depressions and famine\nthis isn't new it's just we know\neverything you it's one way to look at\nit yes yes absolutely and and I think\nyou're right because there's the\nincomplete information I like the word\nincomplete that you said I appreciate\nthat kind of subtle Point incomplete\ninformation then you have opinions then\nyou have feelings and emotions and so\nthere's there's so much more information\non every level you have the physical\ninformation the emotional information\nthe mental information of course the\nphysical experience of it and and and it\ncan be it can be too much one of the uh\nit's so interesting you use the analogy\nof climbing Mount Everest because I went\nto see a comedy show recently and I'm\ntrying to remember the comedian's name\nso I'll have to find it afterwards and\nand put him in there but he literally\nwas describing he was saying\nrelationships are like climbing Mount\nEverest and so what he said was he goes\nyou started B B camp and he goes you and\nyour partner are ready you're ready to\ngo you're being guided and then at one\npoint you're like oh we're cold but it's\nokay we'll keep each other warm we'll be\nfine and then he goes you get to the\nfirst stop and you go oh yeah like have\nyou have did you pack them the gloves\ndid you pack the gloves and then your\npartner goes oh no I forgot the gloves\nand you're like oh it's okay it's okay\nwe'll just keep our hands warm then you\nget a bit higher and then they were like\nnow it's got to a point where it's\nreally cold and you go why did you\nforget those gloves like you know it's\nlike the like come on like why do you\nforget those gloves then you get the\nnext stop and your partner says to you\nlike you pack the sandwiches right and\nthen you look at the sandwiches like I\ndon't know where the sandwiches are\nanyway and so you talk about this so\nmuch in your work in your book like\nrelationships are challenging they're\ndifficult I think you've been together\nnow for over 30 years 311 31 years\ncongratulations October yeah okay\namazing 31 years congratulations that's\nincredible and so inspiring in so many\nways my wife and I have been together\nfor 10 years and that counts counts and\nand you know definitely can see the the\nchallenges unforeseen and seen that come\nwith being together over long periods of\ntime my wife and I in 2016 we both\nchanged jobs so we got married we\nchanged jobs and moved country so we\nmoved from London to New York that year\nwe both quit our jobs in London I could\nwork here my wife couldn't at the time\nbecause of her visa and we started new\nlives and we obviously moved home and\nwe're away from our families and that\nyear was it brought us closer thankfully\nbut it was a very challenging difficult\nyear because I've heard that those are\nsome of the hardest things you can do\nthe only thing we didn't do was have a\nkid that's right you covered all the\nhard Bas apart from president and first\nlady I think that that takes it but when\nyou're going through all this challenges\nyou've talked about these many many\ntimes before has there ever been a time\nwhen you've said things or done things\nand afterwards thought I wish I didn't\ndo that I wish I didn't say what in my\nmarriage of course I yesterday right I\nlove that how how do you how do you\nbecause you've been together for 31\nyears how do you Rectify something like\nthat when you know because there's a\ndifference between being spiteful or\nbeing silly but like when you really\nfeel like I shouldn't have done that I\nshouldn't have said that how do you\naddress something that you know that's\nthe practice of relationships right\nafter 31 years yeah we still do it but\nyou know it quicker and then you you\napologize you know you you learn how to\nsay my bad right and that takes that\ntakes a second right you know that's why\nI talk about relationships in the light\nI talk about marriage because I just\nthink that number one most people don't\ntalk about it like our parents you\ndidn't talk about your marriage you\ndidn't talk about your feelings you\ndidn't talk about your parents didn't\ntell you about the challenges that we're\nfacing so why why don't we share the\nwhole experience because what happens is\nthat by not knowing you hit in in your\nrelationship some natural like\nunderstandable rough patches and you\nwant to quit and it's like oh no no no\nno no that's not quit worthy that's just\nthat's the just the nature of things you\nknow that's why I joked it's like oh\nyou're mad at your partner you you're\nmad for a year and you think the\nmarriage is over nah no you're going to\nhave Decades of I don't know if I like\nyou you know because over the span of a\n30e marriage yeah you Cobble together\nenough arguments and you got a decade\nright and that's just the way it goes\nbut you don't quit on it right you learn\nfrom it and that's what sustaining a\nrelationship is it's the choice to\nfigure it out not to quit when it gets\nhard so yeah I said something that I\ndidn't mean to say right year year five\nwe might have had hurt feelings and it\nwould have taken days to rectify it\nyou're 30 it's like ah there she goes\nagain or there he goes again I know when\nhow to talk to him about it and when\nbecause we've practiced it we've made a\nlot of mistakes we've gotten it wrong\nand after 31 years we're getting better\nat it and it gets better and better and\nbetter you know look if you lived with\nyour roommate for 30 years you would\nhate them at some point in time but it\nwouldn't be some defining thing you have\nfriendships if they last long you're\ngoing to have some falling out why do we\nput so much pressure on marriage to to\nnot be hard it's the natural hardest\nthing you will ever do which is to try\nto build a life with another person who\nwasn't raised in your shoes who has a\ntotally different temperament right and\nyou're like having other people with\nthem you know you bring other l lives\nand other personalities into the mix and\nthen life is happening of course it's\ngoing to be hard you know but I wouldn't\ntrade in my marriage for anything in the\nworld with all the ups and downs with\nall the running for president stuff I\nwas like what' you do that I mean talk\nabout that being a big\ngaping yeah transition thing in our\nlives but the good has outweighed it and\nif we hadn't hung in there we would have\nmissed all the good and that's what I\ntell young people like first of all pick\nwell pick somebody you respect and like\nstart there right and then remember that\nthat's who they are and then understand\nthat with that they are going to be and\nyou are going to be deeply deeply\nflawed and you're going to make a whole\nlot of mistakes right but in the end you\ncan look that person in the eye and you\ngo you're still the person that I like\nand love and respect and we can figure\nthis out yeah so I share that mhh\nbecause I don't want people looking at\nme and Barack like # couples goals and\nnot know that no no there are some\nbroken things that happen even in the\nbest of marriages absolutely and and you\nuse that term quit Worthy is that\nsomething that you defined for yourself\nwhat you saw as quit worthy and what you\nsaw as not quit worthy that's a good\nquestion look I think there there are\nsome objective quit worthy things like\nCriminal\nof course abuse but hey that's that's\nthat's me you know there's some people\nwho love through a whole lot of things\nso I think that has to be individual but\nif I were talking to my daughters I\nwouldn't want them in to stay in a\nmarriage that made them feel\noppressed that was an overall negative\nto who they were right I do think there\nare reasons to walk away from Marriage\nfriendship a whole jobs a whole lot of\nthings right so yeah I have a clear list\nof like the non-negotiables but\neverybody has their own yeah absolutely\nand I think that's so important that you\nknow everyone who's listening or\nwatching that idea of having our own\nquit worthy definition is is such a need\nbecause it can get really hard to find\nClarity when you get really deep into\nsomething uh a practice that I love\ndoing with a lot of my clients and even\npeople that I work with online is I ask\neveryone to write down the needs that\nthey have in their life and then write\ndown the people that filled those needs\nand it could be themselves too some of\nthem and then some of them are their\nfriends their mom their dad and of\ncourse in your book like we notice like\nyour mom's like wisdom right like like\nshe's the Buddha in your life as you say\nyou you see different people what are\nthe roles that you initially wanted\nPresident Obama to fill that you then\nrealize they actually needed to be\nfilled by other people oh that's a good\nquestion um\nI write about it the fact that we we are\ntwo very independent ambitious smart\npeople and complex you know as as\nindividuals we you know we're dynamic in\nyou know I'm not saying that as a ego\ntrip but no I know what you mean you're\nconstantly in flux that's exactly right\nand I learned it took me a while to\nlearn that you know there's no way we\ncould be everything to each other we\nhave different interests different goals\nthere was this stage in my marriage\nwhere I thought that's what a partner\nwas supposed to be you know you should\ncall me all the time we should talk all\nthe time we should be each other's best\nfriends all the time our marriage got\nbetter when I got better about that\nbecause I think he already had that\nIndependence this this notion of I love\nyou I don't even if I don't talk to you\ntoday that to me is like I don't need\nthat I felt like I needed more of that\nbut as I got older right it got more\nmature more clear about my own goals I\nrealized that I you know he can't be\nresponsible for my happiness I have to\nbe responsible for that I have to Define\nit for myself I have to learn how to\nachieve it my husband is definitely a\npart of that but he is not the he I\ncannot put him in the center of my\nhappiness that freed me up to let him be\nhim and let me be me so I have friends\nwho give me things that my husband\ndoesn't give me I have girlfriends one\ndistinction that we have is like I'm a\ntalker all right when I sit down with my\ngirlfriends we can talk for days I mean\nliterally for days we can take a break\nfor lunch but we can talk you know my\nhusband's not he he can talk but he\nhe'll come by a friendship session you\nknow 9:00 in the morning I have a friend\nstaying with me and he's like what are\ny'all talking about I like well we're\njust now getting into our kids and we're\ngoing to talk about each one of them\nseparately for like an hour right he's\nlike I I couldn't do that right he can't\nbe that for me but I have really good\nmostly girlfriends who give me that you\nknow that we will dissect life to the\nbitter we will ring everything out of\nevery subject and he's like I think I'm\ndone yes I was like well you you can go\nbe done cuz I've got her and we just got\nstarted we're going to we got 12 more\nhours to go\nright and and that's so beautiful to\nhear because I think especially when\nwe're young we think that that person\nhas to be all of that and and from the\nbeginning and or they'll become it\nthere's the other fallacy of like oh\nwell I know who they could be and who\nthey could become how much of that did\nyou feel you had to disconnect and\ndetach from of like what this person\ncould be to you obviously not in the\nworld\nI had to disconnect from all of those\nbeliefs right um and every couple is\ndifferent I found I I know people who\nare each other's best friends they like\nto travel together they walk and hold\nhands and I I have friends who are in\nrelationships where they talk like every\nhour I'm like are you talking to him\nagain nothing changed you know it's up\nto the individuals to Define that for\nthemselves that's the key word yeah for\nBarack and I and I think should be clear\nabout that because the other thing is\nthat when we hold on internally to an\nexpectation of the other person we don't\neven share it so now we're mad that you\nhaven't even fulfilled something I never\neven told you I need it you know that\ntakes time and it takes work which is\nwhy marriage is hard right because\nyou'll have the tendency to live in your\nhead and live out the image of what you\nwant them to be and you haven't even\ncommunicated that to them that's just\none little fraction of the challenge of\nmarriage and friendship and all of that\nit's hard it takes time but it's worth\nit absolutely yeah I think those those\ncheck-ins are the hardest I I know that\nthere's there's four check-ins that I\ntry and keep a good habit around with my\nwife that have really helped me one of\nthem is every day I'll ask her like what\nwas your highlight today or what did you\nlearn today something something positive\nsomething like what's what's the best\nthing that happened to you today I want\nto know because it's so easy for us to\nget so busy in our days not see each\nother all day not speak all day\nand days can go by like that too because\nwe're also traveling then every week I\ntry and ask her like how can I what can\nI help you with this week like is there\nsomething coming up that I just need to\nbe aware of sometimes it's just\ninformation and that gives me an\nopportunity to also tell her I've got a\nreally stressful week coming up just\nknow that I may not be at my best this\nweek I'm just letting you know uh every\nmonth I'm you know checking in with her\nand trying to just say to her like uh\nwhat's what's your big Focus for this\nmonth like you know what what's the big\nthing that you working on then every\nyear is easy like you know what's your\ngoal this year a resolution or whatever\nand I find that those questions and\nsometimes every quarter I'll ask a\nquestion which is the hardest one but\nit's like is this relationship going in\nthe direction you want it to and if it\nisn't what are you willing to do and\nwhat am I willing to do to get it back\non track because I find so often like if\nyou just don't talk about that deep\nintimacy you're just going on different\ntracks and that's why 5 years later\nyou're like well I don't know you\nanymore yeah yeah and so I find that\nlike staying in close contact but one of\nthe biggest things I read which I wanted\nto try with you was the Gman Institute\ntalked about how the number one skill or\nHabit in relationships and they looked\nat couples who'd stayed together the\nlongest and they found it wasn't date\nnights it wasn't vacations it wasn't any\nof this stuff it was learning how to\nfight it was knowing how to deal with\nconflict and most couples obviously we\nall go well we never fight or we're\nnever going to fight but it's inevitable\nso I came up with these three fight\nStyles and I wanted to know okay how you\nsee yourself and how you see President\nObama how he would see him himself and\nso here the three fight styles are a\nventor which means I want to fix and\nsolve it right now you like to vent\nyou're really trying to fix and solve it\nthe second one is you're a Hider you\nneed time and space to think about it\njust want to go spend time by yourself\nand then the third one is the Exploder\nwhere it's like I want my emotions to be\nheard felt and seen before we take time\napart or before wey and solve it which\none are you okay so I've changed over I\nearly on in our relationships I was more\nof an Exploder wow I think he has been\nalways been a fixer right the vent yeah\nfixer yeah so then I would be explosive\nand then want to hide right it's like I\nwant to explode let me have my emotions\nand then give me a moment yes right and\nhe's like we've got to fix this we've\ngot to you know shut this down we got to\nI will figure it out let's talk this\nthis through um and I love that about\nhim especially as a man you know he\nsomebody that is not afraid to put his\nemotions out he's smart and so he knows\nme so he's like he won't let me pretend\nlike there's nothing wrong because he\nknows I know there's something you're a\nlittle off and um but I've had to learn\nthat exploding on a fixer it doesn't\nfeel good to them right it just you know\nit feels good for me yes but it doesn't\nfeel good for him right but he's learned\nthat as a Hider that I do need a little\nmore time right if I'm exploding I can't\nbe rational enough to talk through your\nfixing and you if you want to fix it\nthen I've got to be in a rational place\nso let me hide for a minute so I can get\nmyself down to a fixer place yes I think\nthat's been the trajectory of our\nsorting through learning how to argue\nbut I like I like those but he's he's\nbeen pretty consistent yeah he is\nconsistently the fixer you know and he's\nalso much more even ke you know than I\nam emotionally um we're just different\npeople in that way and he's learned not\nto be too afraid of the explosiveness\nyes it's like I don't mean it I'm just\nsaying it right now cuz I need to say it\nyes right and that awareness that you're\njust displaying there is so powerful to\nto witness because you realize wow it's\nnot as serious as I'm making it out to\nbe it's important that's right it's\nimportant and I need to take note of it\nbut it's I don't need to deal with it in\nthis you know right well and it's\nmaturing we all say well say what's on\nyour mind you know tell it like it is\nand it's like yeah I'm that tends to be\nwho I am but as you get older you\nrealize yeah that's your heart but your\nhead tells you you want to be heard M\nand you have to think about who you're\ntalking to and what your in go is\nbecause that will dictate how you have\nto communicate to them so when you're\nyoung you just want to be heard yes as\nyou get older you have a goal you want\nto achieve something and being heard in\nthe way you say it may not get you to\nyour goal yes I mean that's at the Crux\nfor me of what going high is right I\nmean going high is being strategic if\nyou're really trying to make change you\nhave to think about whether your\napproach will allow for change to happen\nyou know going high means you're\nthinking about a broader Point outside\nof your own anger or hurt or pain you're\nthinking where am I trying to get to and\nhow do I do that with this group that\nI'm trying to move that's passion\nmatured into purpose and young people\noften they want to just act with passion\nyeah right but passion doesn't always\nsolve a thing and I've learned that in\nmy relationship you know my passion\nisn't is meaningless if my husband can't\nhear it you know if I've hurt his\nfeelings in the process well what's\nthat's not the point you know so I have\nto mature my passion you know I have to\nmature it as a mother right I have to be\nvery careful as a mother with the words\nI say I can't just say what's on my mind\nI can I have to think about how I say it\nto which child yes because they're both\ndifferent and they both need to be\nparented different right so going high\nis like to me it's the mature way to\nlive right it's the it's mature way to\nget the message across it doesn't mean\nthat how you feel isn't relevant right\nit's true it's real and true but that's\nthat's for you to deal with when you're\ndealing with external people whether\nit's your husband or your kids or your\nfriends your passion has to take weight\nof what's going to work with this person\nwhat's going to work with this group of\npeople to me that's what going high is\nyeah what a great definition I think\nyou're the best person to have this\nconversation with I love how you explain\nthe need for that and actually I don't\nthink I've heard it explained in that\nway before I really appreciate it\nbecause I think currently we've confused\nbeing authentic and being strategic what\nyou were just saying is when you're\nsharing how you feel you are being\nauthentic but maybe it won't be\nauthentically received or heard or seen\nbecause it wasn't strategically\nperceived but we sometimes today\nperceive strategy as manipulation or as\na technique as opposed to or selling out\nor selling out right walk me through\nthat because I think how we perceive we\nwe've put authenticity on a pedestal\nwhich is not wrong but we've put\nstrategy as like the thing that you kind\nof you know shun well and maybe strategy\nis too strategic or hard of a word but\nyou could replace that with empathy\nright you know if you connectivity it's\nsort of like who am I trying to move and\nwhere are they in this right and when\nyou're the president of the United\nStates or the first lady you have a big\nplatform I've always felt like I have a\nresponsibility to set my feelings aside\nand think about where are youh why are\nyou so angry where is your hate coming\nfrom because yeah I can be mad at your\nhate I can be mad that you're you know\nyou just said something racist or you\nknocked me down a peg or you misjudged\nme but if I'm trying to fix the\nrelationship I've got to understand what\nare you going through where did that\nperception come from what's your history\nwhat put you in this Spirit of hate\nbecause that's going to dictate how we\ncan even begin to have the conversation\nI don't lose my authenticity in that\nbecause I know who I am right but I have\nto make room to understand who you are\nthat's either strategy or empathy but to\nme effective\ncommunication especially if you're a\nleader if you have the power it requires\na step back yes right and I think that's\nwhat going high is and I do you're right\nI think in this day and age we've kind\nof supplanted that\nconsideration because my feelings count\nmy voice has to be heard which is also\nwhy I think we have to learn how to hear\npeople throughout right we have to give\npeople a space to be heard outside of\nthe anger right because that's where all\nthat's coming from right when people\ncan't mature their response it's because\nthey don't have a voice it's like and if\nI don't have a voice in regular\nconversation then I will make you hear\nme yes all right young people feel that\nway absolutely right oppressed people\nfeel that way people who don't have a\nstake and it feel that way which is why\nI think it's strategic to give everybody\na piece of something so that they feel\nseen and heard I think that brings that\nratchets down the anger the\nexplosiveness because people can\nguarantee that they are being seen\nthey'll be heard they don't have to yell\nthey don't have to tear something apart\nthey don't have to break it because they\nown it and we just lose sight of that\nth% these days in our policies and our\nperspectives you can't shut people out\nyou know I talk about in the light when\nI think about kids from communities that\nare underinvested in they their anger\ntheir lack of like I don't none of this\nbelongs to me so why would I protect it\nwhy wouldn't I break down your house or\nRob you or try to take your car because\nI don't own any of this this country is\nnot mine they don't see me right I think\nwe do better with kids if they feel like\nI've got a chance here this place is\ninvesting in me so I'm invested in it we\ndo that with kids in the inner inner\ncity but we you know we don't talk about\neducation we don't talk about what we're\ngiving them or whether they have music\nor or Joy or sports or activities we\njust want them to have nothing and then\nbe okay with it but they're going to\nfight to be heard yes they're going to\nfight to be seen but they're not going\nto do it in a rational way because they\ndon't have a strategic place and they\ndon't feel like they're a part of it so\ntrue so true when you're trying to go\nhigh when you're trying to have this\nview of I want to understand your story\nI want to get inside your mindset and\nand recognize why you have evolved in\nthis direction or this particular path\nif anything what does still offend you\nlike\nInjustice uh ego\ngreed it's offensive racism ignorance\nit's offensive and I've always been that\nkid I don't like unfairness I don't like\nbullies but I have to think about how I\ndeliver messages that's beautiful still\neven in my pain and my anger and my\ndisappointment so th those emotions are\nthere MH but I have to think about where\ndo where do I let that out yes in a safe\nspace and that's what my kitchen table\nis right I still have those emotions but\nin my public facing voice I have to be\nresponsible right and strategic and\nthoughtful\nabout what's going to move the needle\nwhat's going to add value my emotional\nwell-being gets taken care of at the\nkitchen table I I I can't suffocate\nthose feelings but I can't act them out\nin the Town Square yeah CU I'm just\ngoing to add fuel to the fire and that\ndoesn't help if we're trying to move the\nneedle and that doesn't make you\ninauthentic I don't believe because\nthose feelings are still mine and if you\nask me I'll tell you what I'm angry\nabout but I I'm not going to lead with\nthat and in the midst of the message\nI'll make it clear what I stand for and\nwhat I don't stand\nfor but the tone and tenor of the\nmessage matters we can't just say what\nwhat the first thing that comes to our\nminds we cannot that is not authenticity\nto me that's that's childish and we see\nchildish leadership right before us what\nthat looks like and how that feels where\nsomebody is just base and vulgar and\ncynical in a leadership position it it\ndoesn't trickle down well you know that\njust be gets more of that I think we are\nobligated to model for those of us that\nhave a platform because it\nresonates and I want to resonate good I\nwant to resonate reason and compassion\nand empathy and that's more important\nthan my feelings because my feelings I\ncan take care of those that is uh that's\nthat's a masterclass in communication\nright there genuinely that is to hear\nthat from you with so\nmuch empathy but\nenergy is so empowering for everyone\nwho's listening and watching because I\nthink I think we've approached it from\nthe other way around today I think I\nthink my personal feelings not mine but\nin general how we feel my personal\nfeelings have become more important than\nmoving and supporting and serving and\ncaring and getting to where we need to\nget to and that's because we've\nsuppressed those feelings that's why\nthat has happened it hasn't happened\nbecause people are mean or insensitive\nit's happened because people feel\nthey've been so unheard going back to\nyour point and that's why we need to\ngive space we need to get let this rise\nhow early did you start recognizing this\nfor you in your own life like where do\nyou remember like the earliest before\nthe White House like well you actually\nwere like this worked like this made\nsense and I still felt good because I\nhad my kitchen table is there anything\nthat comes to mind and do I go to\nChildhood I don't think I knew any of\nthis when I was little but I think I you\nknow I learned it on the campaign Trail\nit it was a product of one of the\nhardest moments that I had on the\ncampaign Trail but one of the best\ngrowth moments and I write about this in\nthe light when I was accused of not\nloving my country because of some\nphrasing I said I learned first of all\nthat when you have a public forum\nespecially in this day and age that in\nand you're like competing people will\ndistort you whenever they can and and if\nthey distort your words your truth even\nyour personhood which I felt like people\nattempted to do with me with us they\ntried to otherize us as the first black\nblack people accusing my husband of\nbeing a terrorist and not being born in\nthis country accusing me of being an\nangry black woman and you know the\nlabels that can easily get put on others\nthe people that are othered right to\nmake people afraid of us that that is a\nstrategy that gets played again and\nagain and again it was being played on\nme and it got me to the point where I\nwas almost ready to quit campaigning\nright but then I thought I have to be\nmore strategic than they are about how I\ndeliver my message I have to be\nauthentic but I also have to be careful\nso that I don't get\nmischaracterized I have to be smarter\nthan them that doesn't mean I stop MH\nbut I had to regroup for a minute there\nand really evaluate how am I going to\nreain control over my narrative mhm and\ncommunicate in a broad way right that\nallows me to be heard especially as a\nblack woman yes here being critical or\nbeing authentic or passionate right that\nwas a learning curve to me I I mean I\nthink my sentiments about the importance\nof communication were always there yes\nmy belief in how important it is that\nstories connect us that was there I've\nlearned that in life but learning how to\ndo that on the public stage I I learned\nthe tricks and pitfalls of it in my\nfirst campaign yes and those lessons\nstay with me yeah that's thank you for\nthat example that example definitely\nconnects you reminded me of probably one\nof my favorite set of words from Martin\nLuther King where he said that people\nwho love peace need to learn to organize\nthemselves as well as those who love war\nfor those of us who love love and love\npeace and love compassion empathy if\nwe're not organized about it if we're\nnot strategic about it if we're not\nthoughtful about it that's right it\nwon't have the impact that we all Cay\nfor it to have um Michelle we you've\nbeen so kind and generous with your time\nwe end every episode with a final five\nuh these are the first five which I\nalways ruin because I'm too interested\nand curious uh they usually answered in\none word to one sentence maximum but I\nknow I'm going I'm going to ruin it so\nit's fine uh so the first question I\nhave to ask you Michelle is what is the\nbest advice you've ever heard or\nreceived heard a lot of it from my\nwife's mom come home we like you here to\nexplain that it was like my parents\nalways taught me that the world won't\nalways like you but you can't count on\nthe World to like you you come home to\nbe liked you go out there to get your\neducation to earn a living you won't\nnever necessarily find people who will\nsee you or love you or like you you get\nthat here right that's been a piece of\nadvice that stuck oh that's beautiful\nthank you that's that's so powerful I\nknow a lot of people who need to hear\nthat right now uh second question what\nis the worst advice you've ever heard or\nreceived I don't know I don't I don't\nknow that the worst advice stays with me\nyou let it go my brother this isn't the\nworst right but it goes back to what we\nwere saying earlier you know he's like\nwhen you get into the White House you\ngot to be careful F No New Friends right\nthat's not who he is but you know it was\na short way of saying be careful I think\nstaying open MH was more important in\nthis phase in our lives than being\nclosed off I'm I'm glad we stayed open\nI'm glad too uh question number three\nyou said that the White House doesn't\nchange you it reveals more of who you\nare yeah what did it reveal to you about\nyourself that I'm pretty strategic and\nsmart and resilient the White House\ntests you in ways that you never\nanticipated and the fact that we came\nout as a family as individuals the four\nof us me and our two daughters that was\nus MH that was our values our compassion\nour our smarts our strategy that got us\nthrough you know I'm so proud of my\nhusband\nthe way he led the way his\nadministration worked the team that we\nbuilt so proud of everyone I I may have\ndiverted from the question but beautiful\num I think that's that's because of who\nwe\nare and I know that now I can I can see\nit in your eyes and and feel it from\nyour words like it's it it must be hard\nlike knowing that you know it it can't\nalways be that way in one sense it's\nalmost like great that you've been able\nto leave but there's a there's that\nfeeling also of like oh but that was\ngreat I mean the bars are different for\npeople in\nlife that I've learned this is the thing\nabout being another MH you learn how to\nbe excellent all the time because you\ncan't be less than other people can\nother people can be indicted a bunch of\ntimes and still run for for office M\nblack man can't you just learn to be\ngood and in the end you benefit from\nthat extra resilience you know you could\nbe mad about it but it also makes you\nmore equipped right but it's still not\nfair yeah definitely uh question number\nfour we got two more left question\nnumber\nfour you've obviously\nalready began living and will leave in\nin Legacy for the work that you've done\nif you could describe what that you'd\nwant that Legacy to read if someone was\nreading it or hearing it what would it\nwhat would it\nsay that she\nhelped more young people feel seen CU I\nstart with young\npeople because with one\nword we can change a kid's life we can\nlift them up but that same\nthe wrong one word can crush them\nforever and those are the building\nblocks of our Humanity how we treat our\nkids all of them right and so I hope\nthat my legacy is creating a stronger\nfoundation\nfor young people a fifth and final\nquestion we ask this to every guest\nwho's ever been on the show more more\nappropriate with guests like yourselves\nbut if you could create one law in the\nworld that everyone had to follow what\nwould it be everybody should have a a\nhome to live in food to eat a job to go\nto an\neducation period there would be the\nfundamental rights of everyone in the\nworld now there could be levels of that\nyou know we would not live in a world\nwhere so few have so much and so many\nhave nothing mhm and that law would\ncreate some kind of equity we have this\ntrickle down approach right that's the\nbasis of a capitalistic economy right\nbut that's not happening yes it's not\ntrickling the law would we it would\nrequire in whatever way if we're not\ntrickling\nvoluntarily then we need to be forced to\ntrickle how do we create that La I'm in\nhow do we get that mandatory trickling\ndown right no we so need that we so need\nthat What's blocking that what's what's\nstopping that I think\nfear yeah I mean I I write about fear\nbecause I think fear is at the source of\nso much because I think the people who\nhave a lot are afraid of not having\nenough and it's not rational right but\nwe fear the other too and so it's hard\nto give to people that you think you\nshould be afraid of\nbecause you can't connect with them\nwe're all human we're so alike I don't\ncare about skin color or how we pray or\nwho how we love we're all the same what\nkeeps us from seeing that is fear right\nI don't know you you're different so I\ngot to be afraid of you and I can't I I\nhave to make sure you don't come into my\nspace and then we live in a culture\nwhere people with power pre on fear to\nget more power I want to make you all\nafraid of each other MH and then I can\ncome in and Rule it all right I think\nfear is at the root of that Michelle I\ndeeply appreciate uh your time your\nenergy your presence the eloquence but\nalso the the Deep energy you bring to\nconversations like these and I'm\ndefinitely grateful for the light you\ncarry and I'm very deeply appreciative\nfor you sharing it on on purpose and I\nhope this will be the first of many\nconversations together together so again\nthank you so much thank you we'll talk\nagain absolutely thank you if you love\nthis episode you'll enjoy my interview\nwith Dr Daniel aan on how to change your\nlife by changing your brain if we want a\nhealthy mind it actually starts with a\nhealthy brain you know I've had the\nblessing or the curse to scan over a\nth000 convicted felons and over a\nhundred murderers and their brains are\nvery damaged sh"
