    "transcript": "we're in Los Angeles right now I happen\nto know that the average Angelino spends\n47 hours a year not just in traffic\nstopped in traffic in places that are\nwalkable where there are bike Lanes\nwhere there are nice wide sidewalks with\ntrees so they're aesthetically pleasing\ncleaned up playground the physical\nactivity level of the entire Community\nis 20% higher uh so we live in a nature\nNation where fewer than 24% of people\nget the minimum amount of physical\nactivity which is only about 20 minutes\nso just by living in a walkable\nneighborhood you're probably going to\nget more physical activity over the long\nterm than you are signing up for a gym"
