    "transcript": "it almost seems like all of our bad\ndecisions whether it's what we eat\nwhether we walk whether we work out are\nprimarily based on high levels of stress\nso when we're stressed you're going to\nreach for unhealthy food because it\nmakes you feel better when you're\nstressed you're more likely to reach for\nsugar when you're stressed you're more\nlikely to sleep in or try to sleep in or\nhave bad sleep and then you don't have\nenergy to work out you're more likely to\nskip a workout or skip walking because\nyou feel stressed you want to rush home\nin your car and just get in front of the\nTV and so so much of our choices are all\nbased on a lot of stress and obviously\nin the blue zones they don't have a\nstressful life I imagine"
