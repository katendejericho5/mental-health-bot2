best-selling author\naward-winning journalist Danner these\nfive areas where people are living\nmeasurably longer not only is there\nplenty of evidence that these approaches\nwork but also it offers a path to\nlongevity that's\nenjoyable before we jump into this\nepisode I'd like to invite you to join\nthis community to hear more interviews\nthat will help you become happier\nhealthier and more healed all I want you\nto do is click on the Subscribe button I\nlove your support it's incredible to see\nall your comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett hey everyone welcome back to onp\npurpose the number one Health podcast in\nthe world thanks to each and every one\nof you that come back every week to\nbecome happier healthier and more healed\nnow I love sitting down with people who\nhave deeply studied obsessed and\nexcavated insights and ideas for us\npeople who have focused deeply on mining\nthe world traveling the world and\nfinding wisdom finding tenets of ideas\nand Concepts that can transform the way\nwe live in the modern world and today's\nguest is someone I've had on the show\nbefore but I so excited to see him again\nafter around four or five years it's\nbeen since we were lost together I'm\nspeaking about Dan Butner an Explorer\nNational Geographic fellow award-winning\njournalist and producer and New York\nTimes bestselling author Dan discovered\nthe five places in the world dubbed blue\nzones hotpots where people live the\nlongest healthiest lives in Dan's new\nbook that I have right now the Blue Zone\nsecrets for living longer lessons from\nthe healthiest places on Earth Dan talks\nabout his travels and journeys of living\nand learning from people all over the\nworld that we'll dive into today I want\nyou to grab a copy of this book it\nbeautifully synthesizes and summarizes\nreally complex and difficult ideas and\nreally really simple and beautiful ones\nin a way that you can practice them and\nbring them to life in yours and the\npeople you love welcome to the show Dan\nButner Dan thank you for being here oh\nyou're such a master it's it's it's a\ncomplete joy to see you again and and to\nbe here in your studio yeah and\ncongratulations on your documentary too\non Netflix I mean it's been received\nexceptionally well if anyone hasn't seen\nit yet make sure you go and see that and\nget the book at the same time it's it's\nso beautiful because when we met you'd\nbeen dedicated to this work for so long\nalready and the fact that it's now\nhaving another Resurgence and you know\nit's becoming even more mainstream which\nwhich I love because I think these ideas\nneed to be mainstream talk to us just\nabout how long you've been fascinated\nand obsessed about this journey and how\namazing it is you just said a moment ago\noutside to me you said you know I\nthought the work had had its course but\nhere it is again just it's Timeless 1999\nI I did a read a study in the World\nHealth Organization finding that Okinawa\nJapan produces the longest live\ndisability-free lives in the world I\nthought aha that's a great mystery\nand it did a very quick Expedition there\nand became personally on on fire about\nthe topic and then in 2004 I got an\nassignment from National Geographic and\na grant from the National Institutes on\naging and uh wrote a cover story for\nNational Geographic and the idea here\nJay was you know so many it's very hot\nin Silicon Valley right now to search\nfor longevity hacks or anti-aging nooms\nand so forth and instead of looking for\nsecret to longevity in a test tube or\nsome sort of genetic code uh we very\nmethodically found these five areas\nwhere people are living measurably\nlonger and then because only about 20%\nof how long we live is dictated by our\ngenes 80% is something else then we took\nteams of scientists to find the common\ndenominators and the the corelates and I\nthink the reason this this the Netflix\nseries is resonating so much right now\nis because in our fast Pace world where\nwe're constantly looking for answers in\ntechnology we've overlooked this\nwonderful repository of time honor and\nwisdom that if we stop pay attention you\ncan see not only is there plenty of\nevidence that these approaches work but\nalso it offers a path to longevity\nthat's enjoyable absolutely and I I'm so\nhappy that you're shining a light on\nthat because I think it's so interesting\nhow obsessed we can get and even how\nstressed we can get about our health and\nalmost when you go back to these very\nGrassroots ways and methods and\napproaches it's so much more natural and\norganic but W us through that you said\n20% is genes what's the other 80% maybe\n10% is Health Care you know how good\nyour insurance is how much access you\nhave to hospitals and doctors but the\nother 70% or so I argue it is largely\nyour environment we spent over150\nbillion a year on diets and exercise\nprograms but if you look at the the\nduration of how long those last it's\nmeasured in months or maybe a year and a\nhalf or so and when it comes to\nlongevity there's no short-term fix\nthere's no pill there's no supplement it\nis the sum of lots of small improvements\nto your lives aggregated over decades\nthat's what works and I've been shown\nnothing else that can work in the in in\nthe in the short run so uh so that 70%\nis how you set up your environment so\nthat you are\nunconsciously nudged to do things that\nfavor longevity and nudged away from the\nthings that we know take away from\nhealth and vitality that's kind of the\ngeneral idea and I love that idea about\nenvironment I think the challenge is\ntoday that a lot of us would find that\nenvironments we grow up in or\nenvironments we live and work in are\nalmost set up against longevity yes\nwould you agree with that and what are\nsome of the ways in which we almost have\nto not fight but we have to almost\ndefend protect and create environments\nto grow and be abundant in so we're in\nLos Angeles right now I happen to know\nthat the average Angelino spends 47\nhours a year not just in traffic stopped\nin traffic in places that are walkable\nwhere there are bike Lanes where there\nare nice wide sidewalks with trees so\nthey're aesthetically pleasing cleaned\nup playground the physical activity\nlevel of the entire Community is 20%\nhigher uh so we live in a nature Nation\nwhere few than 24% of people get the\nminimum amount of physical activity\nwhich is only about 20 minutes so just\nby living in a walkable neighborhood\nyou're probably going to get more\nphysical activity over the long term\nthan you are signing up for a gym the\nother problems our food environment you\nknow we\nevolved with u uh genetic hard wirring\nto favor salt favor sugar yearn for fat\nand take rest whenever we can that\nserved us very well in in an environment\nof scarcity and difficulty like we\nevolved in but now we live in this\nenvironment where we're never more than\nfive steps away from a salty snack or\nsoda or hamburger or pizza and you know\nour jeans lust for that um and we can\ntry to deploy discipline or presence of\nmind to overcome it three or four times\nbut the sixth time you're confronted by\nit in a day you know that discipline\nmuscle wears out and next thing you're\nyou know eating that Snickers or digging\ninto that bag of chips and and uh it's\nhard to WG your finger at Americans and\nsay it's your responsibility to eat\nhealth healthy when 97 out of 100\nchoices out there for most people aren't\nhealthy well I want to dive into all the\nlessons and the insides that we can make\nshifts how have you found people being\nable to apply the blue zones work in\ntheir modern lives in these big cities\nin places where 97 out of a 100 options\nare unhealthy or toxic or whatever they\nmay be what examples have you seen what\nhave you learned about people actually\nmaking changes in transformations in\nlife so I have two answers and first\nI'll take it at the community level so\nmy daytime job for most the last 13\nyears has been working with cities uh\nwere were publicly endorsed but\nprivately funded so we don't get\ninvolved with you know people worrying\nabout spending uh tax dollars we've gone\ninto cities like Fort Worth Texas Naples\nFlorida Jacksonville the whole state of\nHawaii and instead of trying to get\npeople to try to convince people to eat\nmostly a plant-based diet and get\nphysical activity we work with city\ncouncil to help them uh identify\npolicies that favor healthy food over\njunk food that favor The Pedestrian over\nthe motorist that favor the non-smoker\nover the smoker and we don't come in\ntelling cities what to do nobody wants\nto be told what to do we bring them\nmenus and then we go through every item\non that policy menu and assess it for\nnumber one effective do people in this\nroom from the public and private sector\nthink it' be effective in this city and\ntwo Is it feasible is there enough sort\nof political Equity to get these things\ndone and in every city we're able to\nfind a half a dozen to a dozen policies\nthat float to the top and my team could\nget implement it and that's the biggest\naccording to the CDC the most powerful\nlever we have to create a healthier\nAmerica is policy it's the most coste\neffective but then we also have a blue\nzones certification program for\nrestaurants grocery stores workplaces\nand schools and over 5 years we can\nusually get 30 to 40% of those places to\nagree to optimize their designs and\ntheir policies so people mindlessly move\nmore uh eat better you know cafeterias\nare healthier with healthier choices\nsocialize more we all know um loneliness\nkills and then no one Liv their purpose\nand it only works when you're\ncomprehensive and from the time people\nwake up till the time they go to bed\nthey are nudged uh unconsciously nudged\ninto slightly better behaviors over the\nperiod of decades and in every city we\nworked in and galop measures this uh\nwe've seen the obesity rate go down life\nsatisfaction go up and Health Care go\ndown a lot and in a country where we're\nspending $4.4 trillion do on healthc\ncare uh that's an important\nconsideration yeah absolutely I mean\nit's incredible to have these very I\nlove how you're approaching it almost\nfrom a very macro level like in the\nsense of it's not just about micro habit\nchanges it's about redesigning entire\ncities or reformatting entire cities\nwhich which I was fascinated when we\nfirst met and you walked me through the\nmodels and I remember you showing us how\nyou were thinking parks and spaces could\nbe redesigned and how schools and homes\nand how they all need to be close to\neach other and I was thinking wow this\nis it's such a practical but macro level\nI want to dive into some of these areas\nbecause I want to give people a small\ntour of this beautiful book that you've\ncreated and of course highly recommend\nthat everyone grabs the book for all the\nfull details but the blue zones are\nSardinia NOOA\nlomalinda Iaria Okana and Singapore and\nso they're not necessarily the most\nthey're not predictable and they're not\nplaces that you'd go oh yeah I know that\nplace like of course those people live a\nlong time they they they're and I've\nonly been to I've been to Sardinia\nbefore and I remember going and meeting\nwith some of the people then I was\ntotally Blown Away I've been to\nSingapore before and I met some local\nindividuals but I wanted to dive into a\ncouple of is that I highlighted so I\nwant to talk a little bit about a few\nthings that may sound counterintuitive\nto people uh one of the one of these\nones was the plant-based diet because I\nthink a lot of people right now there's\na lot of debate over plant-based versus\nmeat-based Diet but this was something\nthat you saw across the board as quite a\nstrong indicator of longevity I think\npeople should eat what makes them feel\nthe best and I'm not here to tell people\nwhat to eat but I'm also right for\nNational Geographic and I'm my feet are\nheld to the fire um so if I want to talk\nabout a diet of longevity the our\nprocess was to aggregate dietary surveys\nin all five blue zones universities go\nout and find what the what the\npopulation is eating and we did that o\nfor over the past 80 years so 155\ndietary surveys over 80 years so we know\nwhat a centenarian was eating when they\nwere 20 and what they what they're\neating when they were newly retired and\nrecently I had oversight from Harvard to\ndo what's called a metaanalysis and if\nyou really want to know what a\ncentenarian has eaten most of his or her\nlife uh it is about 90 to 95% whole\nplant-based food uh contrary to sort of\nthe popular keto diets and so forth it's\nvery high in carbohydrates but complex\ncarbohydrates carbohydrates both jelly\nbeans and and lentil beans are\ncarbohydrates and obviously you know in\na way carbohydrates is the worst word in\nthe nutrition dictionary because I would\nargue simple carbohydrates like jelly\nbeans are the most toxic components of\nour diet whereas beans is the most\nhealthy the the five pillars of every\nlongevity diet in the world are whole\ngrains greens and other garden\nvegetables it's all seasonal tubers like\nsweet potatoes uh in Okinawa until 1970\nabout 65 to 70% of all the calories\nconsumed were from purple sweet potatoes\na nuts as a snack and then the\nCornerstone of every longevity diet in\nthe world is beans and if you're eating\na cup of beans a day it's probably worth\nabout four years of extra life\nexpectancy they do eat meat and I\nreadily acknowledge that the Adventists\ndon't all eat meat but in all blue zones\non average they were eating meat about\nfive times per month the average\nAmerican eats about 220 pounds of meat A\nyear which is just too much I think\nthere's plenty of evidence to show that\nthat level of meat consumption is highly\nassociated with about a doubling or\ntripling of your chances of\ncardiovascular disease and even type 2\ndiabetes in blue zones they might be\nconsuming uh 20 pounds of meat a year\nand it's a celebratory food it's usually\nuh from an animal that's had a pretty\ndecent life not to say that that\njustifies killing it but um it's just a\nwhole different way of of consuming meat\nand and much lower quantities so is\nthere room for meat in people's diet\nprobably but a lot less I think we're\nconsuming yeah and I love how you've\nconnected and I mean the amount of\nanalysis that's been done is is truly\nremarkable and obviously the amount of\nyears the fact that you know what\nsomeone was eating at 20 years old and\nand what they've eaten for their whole\nlife is is pretty phenomenal one of\nthese ones that you had here was\nlaughing with friends and you know I\nthink laughter is laughter and crying\nboth are\nsuch underestimated emotions and\nexpressions and I almost feel like I\nwonder if everyone of us who's listening\nand watching right now did a personal\naudit on how much we laughed per week oh\nyeah I would be intrigued to see how how\nmany of us and I would love that\neveryone who's listening and watching\njust for the next seven days it sounds\nlike a stupid activity and maybe this\nmakes you laugh and that's great uh\nwrite down how many times you you truly\nlaugh not just like ha haa but like\ntruly laughed every day what did you\ndiscover about the importance of\nlaughter because that sounds like such a\nsubtle soft small thing but you you put\nit in the book well it's hard to\nquantify quite honestly but where that\ncomes from the word sardonic which is a\ntype of kind of slightly biting but\ngood-natured uh humor comes from\nSardinia and it very much pervades the\nculture there there's a lot of sort of\nribbing good-natured ribbing of each\nother and um that's sort of a a social\ncurrency so when they get together at\nthe end of the day for their glass of\nwine or two it's usually they're not\nsitting around griping about politics or\nwhat the left is doing or what the right\nis doing they're poking fun of each\nother the shepherd over the hill and um\nso that was that's an anecdotal\nobservation but it just seemed to be one\nof the propellants of of a a very hearty\nand healthy uh social life I wrote that\ncover story for National Geographic in\n2005 I don't think anybody was\nconnecting social the quality of your\nSocial relations with health or\nlongevity until my first articles and\nbooks were and um I I think there's a a\ngeneral realization that transcends blue\nzones that you know if you could put the\nhealthful properties of a good social\nlife in a tablet it would be a billion-\ndollar Blockbuster drug being having at\nleast three friends who you can laugh\nwith who care about you on a on a a bad\nday is worth about eight years of life\nexpectancy over being alone and I don't\nknow of any other supplement or pill\nthat will give you anywhere near that we\ninherently know that like when someone\nhears that they sound yeah I have three\nfriends but I think like you said it's\nthe topic of conversation it's the\nenergetic exchange it's the\nvulnerability and the depth of that\nrelationship that seems to be stifled\nlike you're saying like we're all\nsearching for the magic pill but you're\nsaying actually just having three\nfriends that you can call on a bad day\nis actually going to increase your life\nexpectancy greater than any pill you\ncould take which just to think about\nthat for a second like you make it sound\nso easy but that's a really powerful\npoint but we maybe don't engage as\neffectively with three people in our\nlife where have we gone wrong in that\nsocial space what did you kind of come\nacross there's this great Harvard\nresearcher named Robert putam he wrote a\nbook called bowling alone and when he\nfirst ra wrote it in the late 80s he he\ncalculated that the average American has\nthree friends uh now he now calculates\nwe're down to under two so\nwe may think that we're socially\nconnected but as a nation we're getting\nless and less uh socially connected and\nI think you know part of it is this\nthing right here it's we're using this\nas a proxy for the face-to-face\nconversations like we're having right\nnow which isn't nearly as good part of\nit is our environment we spend about\ntwice as much time in our cars than we\ndid in 1980 if we're in our cars we're\nnot out walking interacting with people\nand having those serendipitous social\ninteractions that can lead to\nfriendships we spend four and a half\nhours a day at least uh interacting with\nour screens yet again another time taken\naway from social interaction and we are\nhumans the reason why we're successful\nover other simeons is that we have this\ncapacity to feel empathy for each other\nto cooperate with each other and at the\nend of the day most things that feel\ngood uh favor our health and our\nlongevity that's why we get hungry and\nit feels good to eat\nyou know we get that little urge and it\nfeels good to have sex these are all\nthings that sort of favor the thriving\nof our of our species yeah I want to\npick a few things that really resonated\nwith me there first is you spoke about\nserendipitous moments and I think that\nthat's such a again it's become so\nRandom or rare now to bump into someone\nat a grocery store and start a\nconversation we're in a line at anywhere\nwhether it's the doctors whether it's a\nstore whatever it may be and everyone's\non their phone and it would be rare or\nactually we'd see it as weird if someone\nsaid hello to us we'd kind of look\naround going are you okay like what do\nyou need it would be\nuncomfortable and I actually think that\nwhen those synchronous or serendipitous\nmoments happen where you kind of have a\nmoment of surprise or Delight or you\nbump into someone that feels familiar I\nhad this happen to me through a work\nthing last week we were going on a work\nproject one person on the team hadn't\ncome to an event yet we hit it off\nimmediately and it felt like Serendipity\nand it was through work and I was just\nlike I want to build a relationship with\nthis person and I often feel that way\nand because I moved country and I moved\nCity so I moved from London to New York\nto now La I've had the positive pressure\nof having to rebuild community and I\nremember when I moved to New York and\nthen moved to LA I said to my wife I was\nlike we're not just I'm not just trying\nto build my career I want to build\ncommunity at the same time because you\ncan't really have one without the other\nI could have an amazing career here but\nif I don't have Community how meaningful\nis my career going to feel and so they\nwere both Pursuits and efforts and I\nremember having this really and I still\ndo it today and I'm 36 years old and I'm\nnot shy about it if I connect with\nsomeone or if I enjoy someone's company\nI'll just say hey do you want to come\nover for dinner let's hang out and I try\nand avoid going out for dinner and I try\nand avoid going to bars and restaurants\nbecause I find them to be loud I find\nthem to be impersonal and I find them\nalso to be short like you go out for\ndinner for an hour and a half and then\neveryone look at their phone and leave\nand I almost think that if there's\nsomeone that I deeply want to connect\nwith I'd rather meet them oneon-one and\nif they can come over to my apartment or\nmy home or whatever it may be that\nintimate time and ordering food in kind\nof creates more time you're now going to\nspend three hours with someone it's\nlikely that you're going to extend that\nperiod of time and another thing that's\nbeen massive in helping me is I think\noften we hide in groups so we go out\nwith big groups we go out with 20 people\nwe go out with 30 people and you then\nend up having or you got with six people\nand you end up having five shallow\nconversations as opposed to one or two\ndeeper ones now I'm not saying I don't\nhang out in groups I do and I enjoy it\nand my wife and I throw regular game\nnights and we love that kind of stuff\nbut I also crave deep intimate valuable\nconversation as well and I know my\nfriends do and so to me I've I've tried\nreally really hard and sometimes you\nknow you wear your heart on your sleeve\nand you say to someone hey do you want\nto hang out and they're like no and and\nit's okay because I feel like if if I do\nfeel that with someone and someone feels\nit back with me that's the beginning of\na beautiful friendship as an adult and I\nfeel like we make less friends as adults\nthan obviously we did as kids and\nespecially for men especially oh yeah\ninteresting go ahead sorry no I'd\nactually like to explore this idea of\nthe positive pressure to socialize I\nthink there are a lot of Americans who\nwould love more social interaction it's\njust hard and I'm wondering what you\nlike if you're a middle-aged American\nliving in Iowa in a small town how would\nyou use this positive pressure and\nactually start to build Network or build\nmeaningful relationships I find places\nof equal value and that could be a bar a\nrestaurant a pool bar a a dots place I\ndon't know I'm thinking places that\npeople in England definitely go to\nconnect like you know I think Sports to\nme finding this has happened recently to\nme here it's like and I know this isn't\nIowa but the idea of I have made I I\nhaven't made I have made so many new\nfriends simply playing pickle ball so\npickle ball is taken over the nation I\ngo to a local park like literally 10\nminutes down the road I go there and I\nplay and if we've lost a Double's\npartner or whatever we'll go up to\nsomeone random or someone will come up\nto us and say hey are you guys looking\nfor another pair and we're like yeah\nsure and all of a sudden you're on a\ntext thread and you're all friends and\nyou're playing pickleball together twice\na week and so I found that Sports places\nof equal value I think Charities and\ngive back opportunities are amazing\nplaces I think there are so many social\nnetworks inside a city that we're not\neven aware of obviously people's schools\nand your children's schools and\ncommunities I think there are just so\nmany opportunities to meet like-minded\npeople and I think if we go there\nwanting to connect and find people of\nequal value I think it's possible and so\nI don't know I've never been to Iowa so\nI can't speak specifically for there but\nI definitely feel like yeah getting\ngetting into places of yeah finding\ntangents to connect on I don't think\nyou're going to bump into someone at a\ngrocery store I don't think you're going\nto bump into someone on the street\nanymore it doesn't work like that but\nyou will bump into someone if you went\nto a class A Course a program an event I\nwent on a world tour this year we went\nto nearly 40 cities across the world and\nI had people who turned up to my show\nSingle alone came by themselves and left\nwith a group of friends I love right\nlike and that's that I think that's\npossible but because you're going to a\nplace where you feel safe and they share\ninterests obviously exploring what\nyou're and probably sharing values\nexactly yeah it's just that you know\nwe're sort of relentlessly marketed that\nthe path to health is through this diet\nprogram or this exercise program or\nthese supplements or a longevity hack\nand the realization that quality social\ninteraction is probably better for your\nhealth than any of those things there\npeople marketers can't make money off of\nit so you so you don't hear about it to\nyour point about pickleball I think it\nis the most important social Innovation\nthat America has seen in the last three\ndecades I'm also a pickleball fale oh I\nlove it yeah and we have this place\nwhere I'll just show up at 9 o'clock in\nthe morning alone and within 10 minutes\nI'm playing a game and often because\nthere's so much kind of talking back and\nforth uh by the end of it I have the\nseeds of three new friendships and after\nthree months it's a it's a community I I\nI think it's a wonderful thing a few\nother things that have worked for me\nthis past summer I I visited Minnesota\nsome I want to expand my Social Circle\nso I started I just went through my own\ncontext just one by one and thought yeah\nthat's a person who's a healthy and I'm\ninterested in and I'd like to get to\nknow and I just made Tuesday and\nThursday afternoons lunch days because\nit was a low bar you know for me to ask\nsomebody to come to lunch with me I'll\npay you and instead of investing in a\ndiet program or something or you know\nsome supplements I you know had ate\nlunches and out of that eight lunches\nthree of those people are you know more\nof a I would say in my media Social\nCircle now so there's ways to do that is\nyeah that's brilliant super practical\nanother one that stuck out and I want to\ngo into so many more but this one kind\nof on that Community element and again\npotentially more anecdotal but but\nreally powerful and a big part of how we\nlived in the monastery and and how I was\nraised celebrating elders and I I love\nthat idea because my wife's one of my\nwife's favorite people in the world well\nher favorite person in the world is her\ngrandmother who's thankfully still with\nus and she loves celebrating her she\nloves spending time with her she loves\nlearning from her she a few years ago\nshe sat down and interviewed her just\nfor herself so she'd have those memories\nto hold on to her Grandma's experiences\nshe went and asked her grandmother to\nshare with her like old photos and all\nof this kind of stuff uh when I think\nabout my monk teachers who are twice my\nage and celebrating them and being\npresent with them and learning from them\nI think celebrating Elders is such a\npart of society that's completely been\nlost but especially in Sardinia that\nstood out uh walk us through what you\nsaw there it's very easy to map respect\nof of Elders as as a longevity strategy\nfor community so you go into these sort\nof old men uh bars up in the mountains\nand instead of seeing the Sports\nIllustrated uh swimsuit of the month you\nknow you would see the centenarian of\nthe month and um they actually have that\nyeah yes in the in U bonai it's called\nin in the cluster of the Blue Zone I\nmean that's just a outward manifestation\nbut in um in Sardinia it would shame the\nfamily to put your aging parent in a\nretirement home so they all stay nearby\nor usually living in the home and\nthey're not just recipients of care I\nthink a lot of people are afraid of that\nthey're expected to participate so the\nwomen are helping with child care they\nthey are the keepers of the food\ntradition uh the men you know they're\nstill advising when to plant when to sew\nthey know how to make that wonderful\nblue zones wine which has very high\nlevels of\nantioxidants um so it's this beautiful\nvirtuous circle where older people are\ntold they matter they're they're given a\nreason to get up in the morning to take\ntheir meds to stay physically fit to eat\nright uh so they're living long longer\nand then there's something called the\ngrandmother effect that shows that a\nhousehold with a grandmother living in\nit or at least nearby grandfather or\ngrandmother those children have lower\nrates of mortality and lower rates of\ndisease so this circle is what sort of\nthink of it an upward ratcheting of uh\nthe life expectancy of the whole\ncommunity and and that becomes harder\nlike even for us like we've moved away\nwe're not close to our our own parents\nand of course our grandparents getting\nolder as well and it's harder when\nyou've the world is growing and the\nworld is getting bigger and you're\nyou're moving and traveling more is\nthere a way of keeping that connection\nthrough phones through facetimes through\nvisits like does it can it still have a\nsimilar impact or yeah or or even more\nimmediate have a surrogate grandparent\nuh there's a Yale researcher named Becca\nLevy who found that just having a\npositive attitude towards aging lowers\nyour mortality by about 40% and and part\nof that is having older people in your\nlife and learning from their wisdom and\nhonoring it not you know forcing them to\nretire but finding a way for their\nwisdom to put work even though they\nmight not have as much fluid\nintelligence as they had when they were\n30 yeah absolutely yeah no I I have a\nlot of that that makes me feel really\ngood I'm really happy you brought that\nup as such a research point I definitely\nhave people in La that I I see as those\nElders in my in my life and in my world\nthat can replace those people that I\ndon't always have access to that's\nreally powerful\na couple of things that I want to\nsurprise people with this because this\nwas huge a couple of fun ones this ideal\nto drink seven cups of green tea a day I\nthink this was on your Tik Tok I seven\ncups of green tea to walk me through\nthat that sounds like a lot hard to do I\nwas just in kyota last week with a\nresearcher who actually very clearly\nmapped it to Frailty seven is ideal but\nas little as three cups of green tea a\nday uh is associated with about four\nextra years of healthy life expected see\nand we don't know why I mean you can you\ncan guess it's probably the antioxid\noxidants or the Catans they call but it\nor there's there's probably 1,500\ncompounds in green tea we don't know for\nsure but green tea has been around for a\nlong time and it's consumed daily in\nvolume by at least two of these blue\nzones and um you know it's one of these\nthings that you know ra rather than turn\nto the superfood or the super beverage\nwhy not drink what we\nuh learn from our our ancestors who've\nachieved the outcomes we want which is a\nlong healthy life yeah absolutely my\nwife and I created this uh sparkling\nadaptogenic tea called juny and we put\none cup of green tea in there and so\nthat's one of the seven at least I'm\ndoing this for my\nlongevity uh it's got zero grams of\nsugar in it delicious thank you it's got\nzero grams of sugar in it only five\ncalories it's all natural uh products\nit's you know it was it was part of that\nlike how do you create something that's\nfun and healthy at the same time and I'm\nglad you're that's right yes and that\ncompetes with the sugar sweeten\nbeverages much much better off grabbing\na juny than a you know a Pepsi yeah ex\nyou said no but no but that was the goal\nit was like I think it's about what what\nwhat you're doing here as well it's\nabout how do we make Alternatives\naccessible and how do we make healthy\noptions on the head and easy and you\nremove the friction of price correct you\nknow I was uh I named Singapore a Blue\nZone 2.0 and the reason is in in one\nlifetime life expectancy has jumped 20\nyears they now have the highest uh\nHealth adjusted life expectancy in the\nworld so they live the longest\nhealthiest life it's not some\ncoincidence from some ancient culture\nthey very deliberately went went about\nmaking uh unhealthy food more expensive\nand harder to get uh so for example they\ntax sugar we all know Sugar's not good\nfor us uh a Coke in Singapore has 20%\nless sugar than the same Coke in America\nso they've they've mandated it has to be\nless sugar meanwhile they they subsidize\nthings we know are good for us like\nbrown rice they know that driving\nespecially in traffic is bad for the air\nit's bad for you know kids get killed in\naccidents you don't get much physical\nactivity when you're sitting in the car\nso they've made car driving incredibly\nexpensive $100,000 just to have the\nright to drive a car 300% tax on top of\nthat therefore 89% of people in\nSingapore walk but they take 89% 89%\nyeah there's only 11% people own cars in\nSingapore but what that means is that\nthere's all this tax revenue that\nthey're able to sink into a fast\nefficient clean and air conditioned\nwonderful uh public transport system and\nnobody's more than about 300 meters away\nuh from Fast much faster than driving\npublic transportation you know what the\nside of benefit of that is everybody\ntakes about 7,500 steps a day without\neven thinking about it so they're\nalready ahead of 75% of Americans just\ngetting to work in the morning or going\nout to see their friends or going out to\neat because they're walking to the\nsubway wow that's the way American\npolicy uh makers need to start thinking\nif we really want a healthier America\nare you are you working on the policy\nshifts too is that a big part of your\nfocus or is that to work on local policy\nI'm working with the one of my favorite\nCongressman Dean Phillips about a uh\ndesign for healthier America bill that\nwould provide block grants for cities to\ndo this kind of work so designing for\nsetting Americans up for health right\nnow we're set up for ill health in in\nthis country I hate to say it so it's\njust instead of the $4.4 trillion doll a\nyear uh we spend cleaning up America's\nHealth mess uh getting getting ahead of\nit which is a much better investment and\nit it also avoids lots of suffering and\nlots of premature death absolutely I\nmean speaking on the you know one of the\nthings I wanted to ask you is what are\nthings that Americans do currently that\nare seen as healthy that are actually\ncausing us to gain weight and live a\nshorter life are there certain things\nthat you think are marketed promoted or\nfocused on for us to become healthier\nthat are having the opposite impact\nanytime anybody markets you a superfood\nyou can be pretty sure it's not um many\nif not most of them have add at sugars\nor processed ingredients which aren't\nall that good for you basically any\npackaged food that that trumpets some\nhealth benefit it's probably all not\nthat all not all that good for you in\nblue zones that the foods they eat have\none ingredient you know the high as it\ncomes out of the ground for the most\npart it's combined in wonderfully\ndelicious ways uh but it's not processed\nand it's seasonal too right it's often\nseasonal but several of the blue zones\nonly have two growing seasons so they\nstill have to get through winter right\nthe Cornerstone of all these longevity\ndiets are beans and Grains which store\nbeautifully for years at a time and\nthose sort of get people through uh the\ntimes where their Gardens aren't\nproducing by the way you know we put\nenormous burden on ourselves trying to\ntell uh Americans that they need to eat\nfresh fruits and vegetables um you go in\nthe inner city a lot of people don't\nknow what to do with fresh fruits and\nvegetables they don't have a taste for\nthem a much greater easier solution is\nbeans and rice beans and corn tortilla\nuh beans and Pasta Pasta foli whenever\nyou have a bean and a grain and you put\nthem together you have a whole protein\nthey're cheap almost every ethnicity\nknows how to cook them and make them\ntaste delicious uh they're usually fast\nto combine and cook we would serve\nAmericans much better if we sent the\nmessage to eat healthy uh to start your\njourney to perhaps living to 100\neat beans and rice what's really hard is\nI'm listening to you and and and and I\nsee this as the challenge too it's like\nit almost seems like all of our bad\ndecisions whether it's what we eat\nwhether we walk whether we work out are\nprimarily based on high levels of stress\nso when we're stressed you're going to\nreach for unhealthy food because it\nmakes you feel better when you're\nstressed you're more likely to reach for\nsugar when you're stressed you're more\nlikely to sleep in or try to sleep in or\nhave bad sleep and then you don't have\nenergy to work out you're more likely to\nskip a work out or skip walking because\nyou feel stressed you want to rush home\nin your car and just get in front of the\nTV and so so much of our choices are all\nbased on a lot of stress and obviously\nin the blue zones they don't have a\nstressful life I imagine you're right\nfundamentally that stress drives poor\ndecisions and also if we're eating a\nmeal and we're stressed you're mixing\nyou're interrupting the digestion uh\nprocess with cortisol which is not good\nfor not good for you but people in blue\nzones suffer stress just like we do they\nworry about their kids they worry about\ntheir finances they worry about their\nhealth if you're unhealthy and\noverweight in America it's probably not\nyour fault and I'll tell you why in\n1980 about 15% of Americans were uh\nobese now it's 42 going to 43% of them\nso almost tripling of the obesity rate\num there's seven times as many people\nare suffering from type 2 diabetes or\npre-diabetes that's not because uh 35\nyears ago people had more discipline or\nbetter diet programs or or they were\nbetter people or they were exposed to\nless stresses what has changed is our\nenvironment I mentioned before we're\ndriving more but also the number of fast\nfood restaurants has gone up\nexponentially over 50% of all retail\noutlets including the place you get your\ntires changed and the place you pick up\nyour diabetes medicine Force you through\na gauntlet of sugar sweeten beverages\nchips and sodas we make about 220 food\ndecisions a day only 10% of them are\nconscious the other 200 or so have been\norchestrated by marketing and by\nproximity and convenience and and really\nmindless decisions and to your point\nsome of those bad mindless decisions are\nbecause of stress but most of it is\nbecause of our unhealthy environment\nyeah I've always said that being prump\nbased has saved me from those gauntlets\nbecause I can't eat any of it because\nall of it yeah all of it has some sort\nof dairy or some sort of animal in it\nand it's like that's the only reason me\nand my wife talk about that all the time\nwhenever we walk past Donuts we past\ndonuts and pastries and we're just like\ngosh if I wasn't plant-based I would be\nbecause I I I have a massive Sweet Tooth\nI grew up eating a ton of sugar I was it\nwas I was exposed to it since I was a\nkid and so it's taken me years to curb\nthat but the thing that saves me the\nmost from exactly what you're talking\nabout right now the dut shop the the\npizza shop the whatever is on\nplant-based and that's the only thing\nthat saves me I hate to tell you there\nare plant-based donuts oh no there are\nyeah I know luckily I live so AED meal\nno so I'm going to point I'm going to\npoint it out there is an amazing if you\nlive in LA there is an amazing\nplant-based donnut place called donut\nfriend it is\nunbelievable and I am so lucky that I\nlive like over 30 minutes away from and\nso thinking about driving for 30 minutes\nthere and 30 minutes back to get a donut\nthey don't deliver to where I live is\nlike that saves me again uh van luin is\ntoo close though that's V ice cream just\nimagine if there were you you w went\ncame out your driveway every time you\ncame out your driveway there was a there\nwas a special little doughnut vendor\nright there totally and that's what most\nAmericans are confronted with that the\nconvenience stores the um it's hard no\nmatter where you shop you're tempted by\nthis stuff and yeah we're set up for\nreally a tough time time yeah one of the\nthings you mentioned again on your Tik\nTok was you've said that you believe the\nbest weight loss tool is the scale um I\nwanted to ask you about that because I\nthink for a lot of people getting on a\nscale is stressful it's like anxiety\ninducing they they look at it and it and\nit makes them more aware of a number and\nnow they get focused on a number and if\nthey don't make that number they judge\nthemselves and criticize themselves or\nthey call themselves fat or ugly or name\nyou know whatever it may be so how what\nwere you trying to get at when you were\nsharing right there is a minority of\npeople who obsess about it and it's\nanxiety inducing but for a the aggregate\npeople who step on a scale every day and\nconfront their weight and by the way you\nknow if your weight goes up yeah you're\ngoing to feel a little kick in the pants\nbut if your weight goes down there's a\nlittle endorphin surge it's a little\nreward and and setting up that system\nputting a bathroom scale in your way\npeople who self we every day after 2\nyears weigh about 8 pounds less than\npeople who never self weigh so I\nactually have one of my little social\ngroups from Los Angeles here I used to\nlive here um I still have four people\nand I hardly know I've seen them once in\nmy life but every day we email each\nother our weight and it kind of keeps us\nuh doing it we we we're accountable to\nsomebody and every one of us our weight\nhas gone down a little bit over the last\ndecade or so and for the average\nAmerican male in 10 years you can expect\nto gain an extra 10 years so even among\nmy little focus group we've been it's\nworked really quite well competition and\ncollaboration together are really\nfascinating really yeah powerful yeah\nit's why pickle ball works for me it's\nit's also why I think I have so many\npeople I know do 10,000 step challenges\nwithin their family and most of those\npeople are walking way over 10,000 steps\nsimply because they're trying to beat\nsomeone in their family and then\neveryone's average is growing up and so\nI think that making something\ncompetitive and collaborative is is the\ngenius of the social social network the\nfitness the fun in life like so much of\nit comes from that and I think we've\nlost that one of the strategies we\ndeploying our cities it it's an idea we\ntook from Okinawa uh the notion of a\nmoai a committed Social Circle and we'll\nget 4 500 people to show up to a gym uh\nwe'll have them Circle up according to\nwhat neighborhood they live in we asked\nthem a bunch of questions about um you\nknow are they religious what their\nfavorite food is what they listen for\nmusic and have them look at each other\nas these questions are being answered\nand then we have them self- select in\ngroups of five people and a lot of these\npeople are completely lonely and once\nthey self- select in these clusters we\ncall them mois we have them give\nthemselves a name and then we organize\nthem around walking together this\neverybody can walk together and then we\noffer a little prize at the end of 10\nweeks what happens during that 10 weeks\nis not only are these people walking a\nlot more than they normally would\nthey're creating a social network or a\nSocial Circle around walking that that\nuh in many cases we know about 60% are\nstill around four years later so as you\nwere starting to to latch on to it's the\npower of uh collaboration but creating a\nsocial circle around a healthy Behavior\nthat's what's going to last and that's\nwhat's going to matter over time\nabsolutely I wanted to quickly jump back\nto diet and food because there's this\ngreat technique that you have and you me\nmentioned and this was popular in parts\nof India that were teaching it from this\nperspective as well that the method you\nspoke about was being eight out of 10\nfull when you're eating and when we were\ntrained about that when we'd hear about\nit from a from an Eastern oric\nperspective the idea of how breath is\npart of feeling full and so food is not\nthe only thing that your stomach is full\non was how I was introduced to that idea\nof being 710 full or 8/10 full and the\nrest would be covered by breath of\ncourse there's water as well walk us\nthrough that idea of how we can all stop\neating at 810 full because I think most\nof us wait till 10 10 or 121 yeah 108\nyeah exactly yeah so so it it has its\nroots in a confucious the okinawans have\nthis saying har haibu which is a\nreminder to stop eating when their\nstomachs are 80% full and they'll say\nthat like a prayer before a meal so\ninstead of saying grace or whatever that\nit's a reminder I believe though much of\nit is actually done uh at the table they\nthey tend to pre-plate their foods and\nput the leftovers away at the uh\nbeginning of the meal instead of the end\nwhen you you might be mindlessly eating\nthey don't have a TV so they're not\nmindlessly eating to their favorite\ntelevision show they're they're sitting\naround with friends slowing the meal\ndown it takes about 20 minutes from the\nfull feeling to travel from your belly\nto your brain and if you're wolfing your\nfood down if you're not breathing like\nyou say not drinking water uh there's a\npretty good chance you're going to\novereat before you know it it's so\nfascinating how how have they been able\nto in these places hold on to these\nTraditions like even you were saying\nthey I I won't say it like you said it\nso the the repetition even the reminder\nof hey let's stay 8/10 full at this meal\nhow have they managed to hold on to\nthese very old traditions and ideas and\nConcepts in places that I'm sure are\nbeing you know commercialized gentrified\nand all the rest of it like how have\nthey managed to hold on to it well\nworked until about the year 2000 or 2005\nbecause there hadn't been outside\ninfluences but in all these blue zones\nthe American food culture and the\nonslaught of ubiquitous media is\nstarting to hit it's lagged by 10 or 20\nyears because these are remote areas but\nyou know as soon as the American food\nculture walks in the front door\nlongevity walks out the back and uh all\nof these blue zones sadly are\ndisappearing uh they'll be gone I I I\nfigure in about a half a generation\nokanawa is already no longer a Blue Zone\num so yeah sadly they're making the same\nmistakes that we're making you think In\nOur Lifetime that blue zones will\nprobably be gone in in about a decade\nand a half the the NOOA Blue Zone has\nshrunk to about 1if its size the okan\nBlue zone is gone except for people 90\nand over you still have a Blue Zone in\nthat\ndemographic uh Sardinia you're starting\nto see fast food restaurant s uh show up\nGreece Ikat is doing a good job and I'll\ntell you why because the recognition\nthey're they're getting as a Blue Zone\nhas created an awareness of the\nincredible Treasures that the older\npeople are and younger people in their\n20s and 30s are bringing back these\ntraditions and they're celebrating this\ndiet uh that is producing longevity and\nI have real hope for the Ian Blue Zone\ndo you think that may be the last step\nending one I think it'll be the last of\nthe of the Blue Zone 1.0 yeah of the\nsingapores I think there are more and my\ncurrent project is to track down more of\nthese areas where um governments have\nbeen successful at manufacturing blue\nzones and so I think those are the going\nto be the most relevant lessons because\nhey let's face it we live you know in\n2023 and and there are modern forces\nthat we have to contend with and the\nlifestyle that evolved beginning in 1500\nuh isn't as useful it provides lessons\nand and we can use it to I think model\nnew environments and new policies but uh\nit's not exactly an apples to Apple yeah\nat a at a government level at a\ndecision-making level what is making\npeople care or not care because I think\nthat's something people always think\nabout right like all of this makes so\nmuch sense if I was in charge I'd say\nthis is how we should be wanting to help\npeople and support people and let let's\nmake it easier because my job on a\nday-to-day basis is so much about\nempowering the individual to make better\nchoices to find healthier options to\nbuild discipline to almost deal with the\nonslaught and The Gauntlet of everything\nthat's kind of my day job right that's\nthat's what I'm focused on here but if I\nwas in charge at State levels I would\nwant to see the changes you're making\nwhat is incentivizing and enduing people\nat that level to say let's build\nSingapore 2.0 and more blue zones 2.0\nversus what's people going n it's all\nright like GDP is great like what what\nis that yeah Singapore realized a long\ntime ago that its most important\nresources it's people it's not some\nindustry or not some commodity like a\nlot of places and it has gone about a\nvery discipline way of looking at each\npolicy through the lens of does this\nincrease the well-being of people or not\nand they don't have the the uh voice of\na lobbyist speaking loudly in their ear\nsome sort of uh fundraising incentive to\nto to favor some you know some big\nbusiness I I think it it really starts\nwith electing leaders who care about who\nput well-being first Thomas Jefferson in\nfact I believe was the wor first\nAmerican to say that the charge of any\nleader is the health and happiness of of\nthe people and uh I think if if we are\nable to you know I don't know we can't\ndo much about Washington but we can do a\nlot in our own communities about the\ntype of Mayor and City councils that we\nelect uh a lot of the best government in\nAmerica right now is being done at the\nmunicipal level not the federal level\nand you can get a lot done in a hurry in\nin a in a city or even at the county\nlevel if someone wants to be involved or\nhelp or support and help their community\nin town become more of a blue Zone where\nwould you suggest they start well if you\ngo to the blue zones website there is a\nbluezones.com there's a button about my\ncommunity and you can see how other\ncities have done it and there's lots of\nof good ideas but honestly Jay it\nrequires a an orchestrated effort\ncomprehensively so many have been sort\nof Half Baked ideas or they're not\ncomprehensive enough and they get people\nreally excited about it and sponsorship\nis money is spent and then not much\nhappens so inconveniently unless it's\ncomprehensive of four or five year\neffort staffed by people know what\nthey're doing with enough intensity it's\nprobably not going to work but it yeah\nit's good it's good to have that Clarity\nI think a lot of people would want to\nsee this change I I can imagine you know\nwanting to back this change and I'm sure\na lot of those people are already doing\nit in their own lives but they'd love to\nsee it extended out to to others I do\nhave one one suggestion that most cities\ncan consider there's something called a\ncomplete streets policy bundle every\nstreet is redone on average every seven\nyears and that provides an opportunity\nto make that street constructed not just\nfor cars as most streets and roadways in\nAmerica are but for humans too so in\nother words they have to be considered\nfor narrower range which calms traffic\nto for bike lanes for wider sidewalks\nfor trees for safe crosswalks and uh if\na city council that adopts complete\nstreets it it creates an onus for them\nto make a more walkable livable\ncommunity and any City in American can\ndo that and there's by the way there's\ngreat examples Santa Barbara California\nhas done a fantastic job uh Boulder\nColorado a fantastic job Madison\nWisconsin these are places that are not\nonly walkable but they're economically\nthriving and people report the highest\nlevels of well-being they have some of\nthe lowest uh rates of obesity in\nAmerica so that's a great place uh to\nstart for for most American cities I\nwant to make sure everyone knows when\nyou get the book you're going to hear\nabout sleeps naps fasting sunlight I\nmean there are so many other topics that\nI don't want to go over here because I\nwant you to go and read the book and and\ndive into the depth of just you know how\nmuch research how much thought how much\nwork has gone into this over the last\nyou know couple of decades from Dan and\nhis team but Dan I have to ask you about\npurpose we're on on purpose and you talk\nabout purpose in the book I remember\nspeaking to you about it last time as\nbeing such a key attribute of a\nsuccessful uh centenarian was purpose\nhow did they Define or view purpose or\ncontributing to the greater good like\nwhat does that look like for someone in\na Blue Zone well I have a few things to\nsay about purpose so it begins in blue\nzones with vocabulary for purpose in in\num Costa Rica it's plita in Okinawa it's\niki guy um so it's imbued in their in\ntheir culture um but it's manifested\npurpose in in blue zones is rarely an\nindividual Pursuit it's like my my\npurpose is stamp collecting or something\nor butterflies it always has a a social\ncomponent or a philanthropic giving back\nto the community supporting the family\nsupporting my my group component to it a\nservice component to it and um you know\nI do a lot of thinking about it in our\nin our Blue Zone work uh we have this\npurpose workshop and you'd be shocked of\nhow many Americans wake up every morning\ntired they pull the breakfast together\nfor their kids get them off to School\nrush to work wait work 8 to 9 hours\nmuscle through traffic back home get\ndinner back together and the stress just\nnever goes away and only about 30% of\nAmericans uh have purpose in their work\nthat's according to a gal poll that\nsurveyed about 2 million\nAmericans I think purpose is the\nintersection between having Clarity on\nwhat your values are knowing what you\nlove to do knowing what you're good at\nand then studying those three lists for\nan outlet for him that's true purpose I\nthink that's available to all of us but\nthe founding director of the National\nInstitutes on Aging Dr Robert Butler uh\nfound that people who could articulate\ntheir sense of purpose over time were\nliving about eight years longer than\npeople who are rudderless so there's a\nreal health benefit but more so than a\nhealth benefit it's just an enjoyable\nRich way to live your life and anything\nyou can do to get more purpose in your\nlife uh including I might add listening\nto this podcast twice a week every week\nof your life uh is time well spent Dan\nthank you so much uh the book is called\nthe Blue Zone secrets for living longer\nlessons from the healthiest places on\nEarth Dan this is the book make sure you\ngo grab a copy like I said we didn't\neven Scrat the surface there are so many\nthings I could talk to down about but I\nwant you to go grab the book I want you\nto read it want you to study it I want\nyou to see these beautiful uh summary\npages that are absolutely fantastic that\ntalk about the key learnings from each\nof the blue zones that Dan's been to and\nstudied because it makes it really easy\nto just pick it up reflect have a\ndiscussion about it I hope that I hope\nthat you're going to reach out to a\ngroup of people that should listen to\nthis podcast that are going to be part\nof that try part of that Squad part of\nthat Social Circle for you all whether\nit's a book club whether it's a pickle\nball team whatever it may be uh I really\nhope that that social part is not\nunderestimated and undervalued and Dan I\nthank you again for coming all the way\nyou just flew in an hour before this\nliterally landed came from the airport\nstepped in the sea gave a beautiful\ninterview with all your energy passion\nand and uh it's it's truly remarkable\nand I'm really grateful for your work so\nthank you so much it's been an honor and\na pleasure Jay thank you thank you\nalways been a fan
