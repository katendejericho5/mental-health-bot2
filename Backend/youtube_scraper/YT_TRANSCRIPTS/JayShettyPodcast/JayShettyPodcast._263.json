    "transcript": "join Ry and I for a special onur purpose\nepisode today with BMW Ry and I love\ntaking road trips together and today we\nget to take you on a drive in the all\nelectric\nBMW first ever episode in a car together\nI know have fun we love going on road\ntrips and I thought today we just do a\nlittle spin good little chats yeah find\na nice Lookout Point enjoy the\nsunset you know you know I'm a romantic\nhopeless romantic you got questions next\nto you amazing the team chose these\nquestions let's dive in what is\nsomething you would ask my opinion of I\nwould ask your opinion of what's good\nfor my health like I'm like okay I want\na dessert what should I eat that's\nhealthy I would ask your feedback on\nI've been doing this workout I'm not\nsure I'm feeling good for it or bad from\nit like how should I change it up I\nwould ask for your opinion of I want to\nfeel like this in the morning or this in\nthe night or I've got a headache what\nshould I do that's natural and a remedy\nthat's going to help straight away my\ngut's not feeling so well what's a\nchange I can make that will make me feel\nbetter you know I think I ask your\nopinion of of me sometimes as a person\nlike I I find it really reassuring and\nit means the world to me when I know\nthat you love me and you appreciate me\nand that you value me I think that means\na lot to me because I really value your\nopinion because I think that you're an\namazing person and I think that you have\na really good moral character\nand are a very honest genuine person and\nso when you think good things of me I\nthink that if I have a choice or a\ndecision I'm making or if I'm sharing\nsomething or writing something or\nthinking about something I always like\ngetting your opinion because I feel that\nif I've checked it through with you then\nit'll be authentic and deep a thanks\nthere are like a good amount of stuff um\nthere's more there's so much more I'd\nask your opinion of I would ask you for\nadvice on people like if I've got some\nsort of discrepancy with people or\nfeeling a certain way about someone I\nknow you'll give me a really honest\nopinion about both sides like you're\nsomeone who doesn't really take sides\nabout things which I really appreciate\nyou see as the actual situation versus\nWho's involved I ask you about some of\nmy fashion things even though sometimes\nwe don't see eye to eye I'll get your\nopinion cuz may not take it all the time\nbut I will still get the opinion got it\nI would ask you about every time I need\nany motivation or I'm feeling like I'm\nlacking in trying to get through my day\nor figure out what I should do next\nyou're so good at figuring out step by\nstep of turning something that feels so\nbig into\nmanageable steps and achievable things\nso I appreciate that that's really great\nfor me cuz I feel like I always make\nthings really big in my mind and you\nreally help to break it down you're like\nactually let's drip it all back and this\nis actually what you need to do I would\nask your opinion\nabout all work stuff like it's just such\na beast in terms of work and constantly\nremind ing me to go back to a deeper\nintention and I think that's what's so\nimportant it's less about you're\nobviously so good at what you do but but\neven deeper than that I feel like the\nmotivation and the intention behind it\nis what you always remind me of and so I\ndefinitely ask your opinion on whether\nsomething feels right or wrong cuz I\nthink you're always quite aligned with\nintention there's just a few that come\nto mind thanks so much I really\nappreciate that what is something you\nwouldn't ask my opinion of I think what\nI avoid now asking your opinion of\nsometimes is my fashion\nchoices because I think I've been I've\nbecome quite adventurous you and I quite\nenjoy like pushing the boundaries trying\nnew Silhouettes and shapes and to me\nit's all about like I feel like I get to\nexpress myself feel like I get to I feel\nlike creatively I also get to push my\nown limits when I'm like oh that's what\nI thought worked and now I'm able to\nopen my mind up to a new shape a new\ncolor or new space and I enjoyed that\nnot just in fact but in all areas of\nlife and I think I get scared sometimes\ncuz I I do also want you to think I look\ncool but obviously some of the stuff I\ntry sometimes is pretty out there yeah\nand I want to be honest but I still\nthink you should do everything like for\nme it's more you should do whatever\nmakes you feel happy which is why I that\nyou want to do but then I'm not going to\ntell you I like something if I don't\ntotally totally apprciate the no asking\nis probably the best route to go really\nbecause because I'm using so much of my\nconfidence to pull it off that then if\nsome if I ask your opinion and then you\ndon't like it it's like that's really\nhard cuz I already know cuz it's already\nhad to push but I always say I don't\nlike it but you should wear what you\nlike like you should wear what you you\nfeel comfortable in you should wear what\nyou makes you happy because if you don't\nfeel comfortable or happy in what you're\nwearing then doesn't matter who likes it\nit really makes no difference so I think\nit should be a personal expression I\nthink it's so cool that you express\nyourself in that way and I think it's\ncool that you feel free to do that I\nbelieve like\nyou have to have separate people\ndifferent people in your life for\ndifferent things completely age and I\nrecommend everyone does this activity\nwhere you write down every need you have\nin your life you match that to a person\nin your life and if you have a gap often\nwhat ends up happening is you expect\nthat of your partner or you expect that\nof your sibling or you expect that of\nyour parent rather than going well let\nme be proactive and take responsibility\nfor finding the person that solves this\nGap so let's say you're like oh I don't\nhave someone to go roller skating with\nfor some for example cuz I know you love\nroller skating it's like okay well let\nme go and find that person because I'm\nhorrific at roll skating and it's it's\nan acquired taste right and so it's a\nspecific interest that other people may\nnot be talented or skilled at just like\nI like playing football and you don't\nand so I think finding that person's\nreally important you're using you know\nwhat I really like about this car it\ndoes this you can use hand gestures to\ndo things for what but so you're moving\nyour hands around cuz you're an\nexpressive talker but you're basically\nit does everything from like you can use\nso which is kind of cool because you'd\nhave to press buttons but it does it to\nchange songs and stuff see but because\nyou're so expressive it's doing things\nwithout you even knowing right so tone\nit down yeah so yeah what was your thing\nthat you would that I wouldn't come ask\nyour opinion of I know you're good with\nlike Solutions so if I don't want a\nsolution and I just want to V I'm going\nto probably won't come to you that's so\ngood I probably but I want you to feel\nComfort no no not like that I'm just\nhalf joking but yeah I know that\nsometimes if I don't want a solution I\njust want to like well I know you can\nalways tell me that you know that yeah\nyou can always come to me and say look I\ndon't want to toally what else would I\nnot ask your opinion on I probably would\nask your opinion about food definitely\nnot I like sometimes asking other people\nto pick for me but then you don't enjoy\ndoing that either so yeah I do um yeah I\nthink that's a good good good selection\nreally what is there in your life do you\nthink that you have a need need that you\nhaven't found the person yet like what\nwhat is it that you would think you'd\nneed on a weekly monthly basis in your\nlife and you're like you know what I\ndon't have that friend yet or like I\nhaven't built that relationship I\nhaven't proactively figured that out I\nhave friends to work out with I have\nfriends that I can call just a past time\nwith I have friends to have meaningful\nconversations with I have friends to do\nspiritual activities with not\nnecessarily as much here as I do in\nLondon but still yeah that's for me as\nwell um I have my mom for a lot of stuff\nshe takes a lot of boxes you take a lot\nof boxes my friends I I don't know I I\nfeel like but that's a complete Life\nThat's Good feel like my sister takes a\nlot of boxes for me no but that's good\nthat's a good place to be my niece and\nnephew for some fun and silly convos\nI've been looking for a competitive FIFA\nfriend oh yeah you I need a competitive\nFIFA friend like someone who really gets\nme to become better maybe you know why I\nmiss having a like a friend that just\ncomes and like sits and does nothing\nwith me I like having friends like that\nsomething sometimes cool we just exist\ntogether maybe take naps together maybe\njust like watch something but don't have\nto talk together right got it yeah like\na lot is said but just like nothing is\nactually said got it and I friend like\nthat next question oh and a friend who\nreally likes watching reality TV show\nbecause I that's my like little secret\nindulgent pleasure thing where I just\nlike switching off and I haven't quite\nfound a friend who likes sitting and\nbinge watching reality TV if we had to\nswitch roles for a day what's the first\nthing you do as me meditate and work out\nyeah those are the F those are the two\nnon-negotiables in R's life that in the\nlast I be late for everything 10 years\nthe thing she'll never be late for is a\nworkout and meditation she's always\nthere that's amazing it's really\nimpressive sometimes not mentally it's\nimpressive though like I I think it\ntakes a lot of dedication to have a\nnon-negotiable and I think it's amazing\nthat your non-negotiable habits are so\nimportant because they set you up for\nthe rest of the day do and it's like if\nyou compromised on those two things\ncould you imagine what life would be\nlike no I think I just really struggle\ngoing through the day without it and I\nthink what's really amazing is that you\nhaving those non-negotiables has\ninspired me to have similar\nnon-negotiables especially with working\nout in a way that I don't think I would\nhave had if someone forced me to if\nsomeone preached me to do it if someone\nmade me do it like when I see you\ndedicated every single day to your\nworkout whether it's a weekday whether\nit's a weekend whether it's two workouts\na day I look at that and go okay got it\nlike that's a really great discipline\nyeah it's nice having things that you\nreally appreciate in your life that you\ndon't feel like you need breaks from I\nfeel like they're few and far between\ncuz it doesn't ever seem like you're\nworking it's just like part of your\nbeing and it's the person that you are\non screen off screen with friends with\nfamily like I don't see a difference in\nthat because that is just what you\nabsolutely love doing it's like your\nfull nature to be that and so those\nnon-negotiables come because you just\njust feel and see the Deep Impact that\nit has on you and then you kind of can't\nlike you just know that I just know I'm\nnot going to have a great day even if\nit's not crazy workouts even if it's\njust a walk or movement it's just so\nimportant and I always see movement as\nmind movement body movement both equally\nso important and I think meditation is\ngreat mind movement and walking or\nworkouts is great body movement but both\nof them help with your emotional\nwell-being your physical well-being um\nyour communication and just get things\nflowing yeah there's an amazing zen\nteacher that says what movement does for\nyour body mindfulness does for your mind\nor meditation does for your mind and\ntrue I love that what was the question\nthough if it just roll for a day what\nwas the first thing you do as you I\nwould I would go on a Facebook live\nFacebook or like an Instagram live\nwhatever and I would fully start acting\nout like just things you wouldn't say\nthings you wouldn't do do yeah it's more\nthis is more like Freaky Friday that's\nthe point yeah I would dress\ncrazy and I would oh you know what I do\nI would get people to just realize how\nwacky and like fun you are cuz sometimes\npeople don't see that got it you know\nwhat you'd go into work and I'd be like\nyou know what today guys we're not going\nto work today we're just going to sit\naround cook something right have a\nlittle\nchat and then I want to answer that\nquestion back for you cuz that's a fun\none yeah so beautiful here look at this\namazing unbelievable I love Lookout\npoints in La they're really special ni\nthey're really special just to open up\nthe mind and I love how you can just\npull up and find a spot and yeah really\ntake it all in it's really so beautiful\nis it so nice Okay go ask the question\nfor me then wa what would I do as you so\nI like your answer for me so if I woke\nup as You Freaky Friday what would I do\nI think I'd go do I'd test out all the\nthings I think you have so much talent I\nthink you have just so much potential I\nthink you're one of the most\nentertaining people in the world not\nsinging everything about\nnot dancing everything apart from\nsinging and dancing sleeping yeah you're\ngood at sleeping great everything apart\nfrom singing and dancing and I would\nliterally just that's what I would do I\nwould just go and do everything that I\nthink I know you have the hidden\npotential for that's fine because you're\njust you're so example of thing I can't\nwait to see you host a TV show I can't\nwait to see you write more books I can't\nwait to see you I'll let you write a\nbook for me I would do that as you but I\njust see you like traveling across the\nworld studying cultures teaching that\nculture passing it on through TV through\nfilm through movies you could act you\ncould do whatever you wanted like you're\nso talented so i' all of those things on\na hard day what is the thing you will do\nto make each other start laughing\nimmediately that's a good question I'll\nstart doing my Indian accent or dancing\nor something dancing you you I still\nremember that video do you remember I\ndon't know do the baking do the bacon do\nthe bacon yeah I do remember it was so\nso good like one day this is before RI\never made content and people were\nunaware she randomly started doing this\ndance and I filmed it for fun and I was\nlike you have to post this because it is\njust pure joy and you posted it and I\nremember everyone loving it too and it\nwas just like yeah you you can literally\nburst out into dance or make a funny\nface you can make me laugh very easily\nvery easily if I was trying to make you\nlaugh I'd put on an outfit I love I I\nwould I would I would try and help you\ncook that makes me laugh\nI would what else would I do to make you\nlaugh I mean you're really good at\nfinding funny Tik toks you are wow\nthat's my L skill no you do though you\nfound really good quality right funny\nTik toks oh you know what you do\nsometimes when you're like guessing\nyourself up that makes you laugh a lot\nto make you laugh I do that yeah you get\na banner next question do you have any\nfun memories when it comes to driving oh\nmoments spent with family friends\ndriving off to University I do go I have\nsuch fun memories um in cars with my dad\nI feel like when he was dropping me to\nUniversity or when um even now when he's\ndropping to the airport they're really\nspecial times where I feel like it gives\nspace to just open up and he'll just\nshare stories about his like youth where\nthat I didn't know about we'll just talk\nabout random things and I'll just find\nso much out about him and he's usually\nquite a quiet person and so it feels\nlike the car Journeys are when things\nwere changing even when we'd go back to\nwhere his family lives in Norwich it's\nlike a two and a half hour three hour\ndrive and I always think along the way\nhe'll be like this is where this\nhappened this is where this happened or\nyeah there's always little moments where\nhe'll just suddenly start reminiscing in\nJourneys and I think that CU you're\ngoing on a journey your mind kind of\ngoes back to Journeys in your life and\nyeah definitely enjoy that and then also\nwith my grandma because I drive her and\nher friends around sometimes to like\ntake them to different places so imagine\nlike four 90-year-old women in the car\nthat are just laughing and hanging out\nand so I love doing Uber service for\nthem that's fun and singing along\nsinging along with my nephew in the car\nthat is a good one that's always fun and\nwe've done so many fun road trips as\nwell yeah I just I love being out and\nabout on the road videos of you and\norigin singing in the car they're so fun\nthey're really cute I love a good\nkaraoke moment in the car yeah he's like\nsinging his heart out singing his heart\nout to Adele I think for me I actually\nlove car time as a space for reflection\nI don't know what it is about cars for\nme you do that a lot I I will you don't\nplay music I I don't I I drive in\nsilence a lot of the time I'll listen to\nmy own thoughts I'll reprogram them I'll\ntake a moment to I find sometimes when\nI'm in the car I talk to God the most I\ndon't know what it is about that but I\nfind it a really easy way to talk out\nloud and just listen and pray and\nreflect like I do that a lot if I'm\ndriving alone beautiful I think my\nfavorite memories of road trips also\ninclude all of our road trips like our\nweekend trips\nwe're like doing a playlist when we're\nyou know just hanging out having\nconversations like this I always find\nlike when we find like even when we do\nroad trips with friends and stuff I\nfeelig like we play good games cracking\njokes it was so fun it was so fun it was\nso fun and then I think when I was young\nI remember CU my parents would drive\nfrom London to Europe so we wouldn't get\na plane we'd Drive we'd get the ferry\nfrom DOA to K and then drive through\nEurope and I always found that to be so\nincredible because we'd go through you'd\nget to see like every country in a\nreally intimate way like now when you\nfly it's almost like you don't get to\nsee the roads and the streets and\neverything where do you drive to when\nyou miss home when you're in La when I\nreally miss home it's weird because what\nI really miss is this might sound really\nodd but seeing Indian people and being\naround Indians and seeing like grandmas\nwith saries on and I feel like in LA you\ndon't we see people but I would say I\nsee a lot less brown people than I do\nwhen I'm in London on a day-to-day basis\nso as you know especially during\nfestivals or like Indian festivals I\nwant to go to aresia ceritos ceritos and\neat Indian food buy eat Indian food buy\nIndian clothes be like in a place where\nthere is just so many people that feel\nlike my community and um there's\nsomething about that that makes me feel\nnostalgic so sometimes I'll go to an\nIndian like this like veggie Indian\nrestaurant that I really like here if\nusually my missing home is like missing\nmy mom's food because when I'm feeling\nsad or I feel like I need comfort it's\nusually mom my mom's specifically my\nmom's food that brings me that comfort\nand if I can't get that then I have to\ngo see some like old Indian women in SAR\nso it feels like I'm around my grandma\nYeah I love that so yeah that's probably\nif I think about it it's either that or\nI'll sit just by myself and eat ice\ncream and watch a Bollywood movie or\nsomething nice I think for me I drive to\nplaces I can make new memories so if I\nmiss home I'm always thinking well\nwhat's a new cool fun thing I can do to\ncreate and build a new memory I think\nit's very easy for me sometimes to think\nif I miss something that I have to\nrecreate it or sometimes we think if we\nmiss something you have to remake it for\nme I just like to think okay well what\nopportunity do I have or what\npossibility do I have yeah to just build\nsomething Fresh So I think that's what I\ndo what is the thing you are most scared\nof going into this past year that you\nended up doing literally a month before\nmy world tour I was so close to pulling\nout because I was really worried about\nwhether I'd be able to stay healthy and\nfit traveling to all those countries and\nI was concerned about my well-being I\nwas thinking about work I was thinking\nabout all the things I had to put on\nhold it was like I wasn't going to see\nyou for months I wasn't going to see\nmost of my team for months I wasn't\ngoing to be able to do so much of the\nwork that I'm used to doing every single\nyear we had to tape meditations in\nadvance we had to tape podcasts in\nadvance there was so much work and like\na month before I was like okay I don't\nthink I can go on tour and the thing\nthat kept me going was Nicole and Annie\nhad worked so hard on putting the tour\ntogether and the team had worked so hard\non putting the tour together and I was\nlike I can't let them down like if I\ncancel it it's going to let down all\nthese people who worked so hard putting\nit all together and I can't just out and\nI never told them that till\nafterwards and I think I think they were\nrelieved but it was just one of those\nthings of just like when you're doing\nsomething new what I've learned is it's\nso natural to feel scared and it's so\nnatural to feel fear and what I've\nrealized is before I used to think you\nhave to wait to get over the fear to do\nsomething or you have to wait till you\ndon't feel scared so you can do\nsomething so you spend all your energy\ngoing okay well how do I take care of my\nfear how do I control my fear how do I\nmove past\nwhat I'm scared of and the truth is you\nhave to be fearful and do it anyway like\nyou're going to be scared anyway so why\nnot accept that you're scared accept\nthat you're fearful create a plan and\nthen do it like when I went on my tour I\nremember after finishing the US leg I\nwas exhausted and then when I went\nInternational we started in Australia\nagain there were some crazy highs and\nlows on tour when it came to like health\nand wellness fitness we were literally\nin a city for a Max one and a half days\nyeah and so for me yeah that was intense\nfor me that I mean you came with me for\na week and it was exhausting why am I\ngetting a massage in my CH I just found\nout that there is a massage feature in\nin this car and I am I just activated it\nwhile I was answering my question while\nI was opening my heart for some\nrelaxation this is what R's like so this\nis how Ry makes me laugh I'll be having\na really vulnerable deep open heartfelt\nconversation and then you'll do\nsomething like this can you feel it yes\nI can feel it\noo that's really amazing who doesn't\nwant a bit of a back massage when you're\ndriving around going I've never seen\nthat in a car all right um no that is\ntrue was yours oh yeah that's what\nyou'll do you'll totally distract away\nfrom my deep meaningful point and be\nlike oh yeah that was no you are no I'm\nso sorry but tell me that feature is not\nworth being distracted for it was worth\num what was the thing oh my God this was\nthe year that I literally did so many\nthings that I would normally say no to\nor was scared of I spoke on P oh yeah\nhow was that explain that process for\nyou because I think you put it up on\nInstagram and I remember everyone that\nweek being like Oh my God it amazing but\nit was such a big thing for you walk us\nthrough that it was such a big thing for\nme um why was it such a big thing for\nyou so you were invited to give a speech\nfor I was invited to give a speech for\nan organization that had like what was\nit 3,000 people right in the audience\nwhich is H audience yeah you never\nspoken to more than like what 300 people\nmaybe I've never really spoken to people\nlike that on stage I maybe done one\npanel or something back in the day but I\nremember freezing and not even talking\nand this was a keynote this was not a\nthis was a keynote where it was a full\nlike what 30 minutes speaking to the\ncrowd and then like 15 minutes of q& a\nmhm but it was I was practicing for\nmonths like I was going over and over\nagain writing it practicing it made me\nrealize how when you write something\nit's so different to when you're\nspeaking like things when you write and\nthen when you say it can feel so cheesy\nit was just such an such an weird\nexperience cuz I was literally getting\nthe day of and I was like I have to\ncancel like no the the night before you\nknow what really helped practicing in\nfront of a mirror that was really great\nbut it still didn't take away my fear\nand I have to say it wasn't something\nwhere I did it and I was like yeah I\ncan't wait to do it again it was like\nokay I'm so glad I did it and it's so\nnice to know that I can overcome a fear\nof being in front of so many people and\nworried about not sounding smart or not\nsounding like I know what I'm even\ntalking about or getting words wrong or\nnot see you always want to feel like an\nexpert before you do something I always\nhave felt like an amateur in things that\nI do and so that's always stopped me\nfrom doing things where I've been too\nscared of being seen as someone who's\nnot doing things really well or doesn't\nknow it and so then I'd hide away from\nit and so it was just interesting for me\nto do it and even though I wouldn't say\nI was an expert at it at all I still\ngave it a go and was okay with getting\nthings wrong and maybe not being perfect\nat it and so even more than feeling\nsuccessful I just felt\nliberated of like getting over that fear\nwhat do you think it is cuz I feel like\nwhen we feel fear or we feel scared we\nfeel fearful and scared of so many\ndifferent things but really there's a\nroute to where that comes from mine if\nI'm completely honest roots from always\nfeeling like I've never been smart\nenough because of grades or people in my\nfamily being smarter than me and by the\nway I'm not like oh that's so sad I'm\njust saying that is where it RS from\nbecause I've always had that and so and\nI've told myself that for so long and\nI've always tend to other people to fix\nthings or make things better or to tell\nme whether what I'm doing is right or\nwrong that I never believed me St\nstanding by myself doing something was\ngoing to be as good as other people\ndoing it with me so it definitely roots\nfrom that and then I've just realized\nthat get over it the worst things that\nhappen in life and you don't have to be\nan expert to do things that's why I\nstarted trying to do things that I'm\nreally not good at because sometimes I\nreally enjoy things that I'm not good at\nbut I stop myself from doing them\nbecause I just think that I shouldn't\nbecause I'm not good at it and I think\nthat we're just trained to feel that way\nwhen not everything has to be about\nbeing really good at things it can just\nbe because you want to try or that you\nyou want a new experience I mean it is\nabout being really good at things yeah\nfor people who are good at things no I\nthink I really appreciate your\nresilience I remember when what was it\nthat you tried when we were on vacation\na couple of years ago was itard warding\nI think it might be anyway that was like\nwatching you do that and I remember the\nnext day you felt like you'd had\nwhiplash but you just kept getting back\nup and trying it even though you'd stand\nup for like 3 seconds and fall over I\nremember timing it and it was just\namazing you're so your resilience to\nlike keep trying something even when\nit's so difficult like you do love that\ntoo pickle but yeah I really enjoyed\ntrying all those things this year um and\nrecognizing that you know lots of people\nare like oh I tried this thing and you\nknow I tried it once and then I just got\nthat you know people kept asking me they\nlike once you start actually speaking in\npublic you're going to get this bug for\nit and you're going to want to do it and\nI was like I have not got that bug for\nit and it's not something that I'm\ncraving to do again shows how different\nwe all I love it yeah you do of course I\nmean just and and the thing is you're so\ngood at it but it's taken so many tries\nand doing it from a group of five people\nto 50 people to 100 people to a th000\npeople to you know you know however many\npeople came to your show like you really\nbuilt that why are you laughing so funny\nhowever many yeah cuz like so many\nendless countless people came to your\nshow and you did that over and over\nagain and I just think that it's\nsomething which you see your comfort on\nstage I do not feel my comfort on stage\nI feel my comfort in other areas yeah\nwhich is well I thought you did amazing\nthank you incredible um what is the\nbiggest lesson you have learned this\nyear the biggest lesson that I've\nlearned this year is this going to sound\nso lame because the only thing I can\nthink of right now because I'm tired but\nlike how important sleep is especially\nbecause I've stepped up in what I\nactually do in my day what I've realized\nis how important one conserving your\nenergy and being able to have alone time\nis and also how important like\nrelationships are in terms of what you\ngain from Human connection and how\nenergetic that can feel and also how\ndraining that can feel and knowing the\ndifference between both and who gives\nyou both of those things things who are\nthe people you spend time with that\nactually help feed your energy I think\nI've had to really learn that in the\ntime that I'm expending with people\nbecause I feel so drained and then how\nimportant sleep is not in a superficial\nway but in the way that it affects your\nmood your energy levels your ability to\nwake up and even meditate in the morning\nyour ability to work during the day it\njust affects so much of your life what\nyou want to eat what you crave like it\njust impacts everything and so I've\nreally been trying to prioritize sleep\nlately of like at least sleeping earlier\nand that's that's that that's good I\nreally think the biggest thing I've\nlearned this year which I feel like the\nuniverse keeps reminding me of this but\nit's a big one is don't judge an emotion\nin others that you've never felt because\nthe universe will make you experience oh\nmy gosh yes so often we look at other\npeople's life and we go why are they so\nstressed about that that's so minor like\nwhy are they so anxious about that\nthere's nothing to do with that like why\nare they so mad about that I wouldn't be\nmad about that and then all of a sudden\nthe same thing happens to you and all of\na sudden you're like broken and I've\nseen that happen so many times to\nfriends I've seen that happen so many\ntimes to myself where you're judging\nsomeone else's pain thinking you could\ndeal with that pain and then you go when\nI'm actually going through that pain I\ndon't want to feel it anymore and so\nwhenever I find myself thinking oh I\ncould handle that better or that's not a\nbig deal or can't believe they're\nstruggling with that I've started to\nrealize just don't have that feeling\nbecause you have no idea how that\nperson's navigating it what their\ntrigger is what their trauma is what\ntheir pain is and it's so easy to be\nlike oh well I find that easy and when\nyou actually go through it it's another\nball game and so I remember you know\nlike it's it's kind of like when people\nare like oh you know and not that I say\nthis but a lot of people will say like\noh there's no such thing as depression\nthere's no such thing as anxiety like\nit's just all in your head like things\nlike that it's not actually helpful and\nI think everyone goes through something\nlike that in life that really breaks\nthem down and when I go through that\nlike when I feel like I've judged\nsomething and then I'm going through it\nmyself I go oh got it this is making me\nmore compassionate now for other\npeople's pain and I hope that I can keep\nthis feeling when I'm feeling confident\nthat even if I haven't experienced\nsomeone's pain I can still be\ncompassionate towards it because I\nrecognize that I don't understand all\ntypes of pain just because I think I do\nmentally it's so interesting how we\nthink because we are understand\nsomething\ntheoretically it should be easy\npractically when we're not going through\nthat challenge right now we underplay it\nand undermine it and then as soon as\nwe're going for our own challenge we\noverhype it yeah the next question is\nwhat is something you want to work on\nfor next year oh nice and I think my\nthing is I think that it's easy when and\nI'm sure many people have felt this in\nrelationships or even with friendships\nwhere you see someone with a specific\npurpose and like they know what they're\ndoing and you can almost either jump on\nthe bandwagon of their purpose or\nintention and try and mimic it without\nactually feeling it or doing the work it\nrequires to maintain it and I've been\nthinking about that a lot because I\nthink seeing you have your purpose and\nhave seen you do that for a long time I\nthink I kept trying to create the same\npurpose for myself or jump onto your\npurpose and make it my own but the\nproblem was I didn't have the Deep roed\nfeeling that you have with what you are\ndoing and so that's why my energy and my\ndesire for it would run out so fast and\nI would have to keep motivating myself\nto do keep motivating myself but it\nthere wasn't an actual motivation\nbecause the motivation was coming from\nyou I think for me next year it's about\nactually figuring out what my deep\nrooted purpose and intention is behind\nwhat I'm doing and everything I'm doing\nto feel like it is mine versus one what\nother people think my purpose is and two\ntrying to jump onto someone else's\nbecause it seems so amazing because\nyou're so connected to it but it's not\nmine and therefore don't have that\nconnection it's interesting how our mind\ndoes that even when we know purpose is\nindividual it's yeah it's Unique it's\nnot adopted like we always talk about\nthat famous line in the badita which\nsays that it's better to do your own\npurpose imperfectly than to try to do\nsomeone's perfect\nyeah because the point is doing your\nthing is way better than trying to do\nsomeone else's and also the other verse\nthat I love about purpose is when you\nprotect your purpose your purpose\nprotects you when we try to imitate or\nproject someone's purpose onto ourself\nit doesn't work because we actually have\nto protect the the Diamond of our\npurpose that we're holding on to and we\nhave to care for it as if it's a rare\ngem what's something you want to work on\nfor next year it's been a few things\nI've been thinking about one is that I\nreally believe that my best work for me\nat this point in my career comes when\nI'm when I have space and there was a\ntime in my life where being productive\nand efficient was what helped me achieve\nand I feel like I'm at a place in my\nlife where I feel like the more I'm\nreflecting reading being thoughtful I\nfeel like a better version of myself and\nso I think I've been re\nprioritizing from being productive\nto almost zooming out and gaining more\nperspective and that requires a lot of\nrestructuring of my life I have lots of\ncommitments I have lots of\nresponsibilities there's so many things\nI have to think about in order to do\nthat but I'm realizing that I'm better\nwith more time than less time it's not\nabout more socialized like I'm not\ntrying to create more of a social life\nthat's not really what will make me\nhappy but I'm trying to create more of\nspace to be more\nCurious and be more more even more\nreflective and thoughtful than I believe\nI already give myself time to I find\nthat I'm often putting myself in a lot\nof discomfort to operate at a high level\nand I want to give myself some mental\ncomfort and I believe that will really\ncreate some fascinating projects and\nvision for what I want to do in the\nworld I think that there's points in\nyour career where you just have to like\nput your head down and work really hard\nand then you get to points in your\ncareer where you have to look up and\ntake a step back\nand think I'm in my I to do that because\nI want to about the I want to in the\nworld I want to about the work I want to\ndo the the pathways I think are going to\nreally shift culture in the world and I\nwant to give myself time and space\nthat's not going to come from\nproductivity that's going to come from\nperspective what is something you valued\nthis past year in our relationship that\nyou did not value in the past oh that's\nsuch a great question I'd say maybe for\nme is I think in the past because I\nwasn't you always ready to give help and\nI wasn't ready to necessarily receive it\nbecause I wasn't ready to do the work it\ntook to do it and you're always someone\nwho wants to help and you always have\nthe time and space to help no matter\nwhat you have going on and I think in\nthe past I didn't value it because I\nalmost wasn't ready\nto I didn't want to waste your time\nbecause I knew I wasn't ready to put in\nthe work to actually take it on no but\nyou know what I mean like it was more me\nnot being in a place to do the stuff\nrequired because I'd get your advice and\nthen I wouldn't Implement and then it\ndidn't you know didn't make sense and it\nmade me feel bad about it whereas I feel\nlike this year because I made a decision\nto really try and understand what my\npotential was and to push myself to to\nsee and and explore that I was able to\ntake on a lot of your really great like\nadvice and time and I value that advice\na lot more now because I I was I'm ready\nto actually receive it I think for me\nthere's a couple of things I think I\nlearn to revalue every year just how\nmuch you do love me by your choice to\nyou know as we've always talked about\nit's been so hard for you to move away\nfrom family move to New York and then\nmove to LA and then and I know you go\nback often when it's nice but you still\nvase yourself here and I I think I learn\nto revalue that every year as a sign of\nhow much you love me because I realize\nthat that is the reason that makes you\ndo it you wouldn't do it if it wasn't\nfor that and I think that that is\nsomething I have to revalue I get a new\nfound value for it every year because I\nrealize it more and more and I think the\nother thing that I value that maybe I\ndidn't value before was how much again I\nthink it's a revalue too of how much\nyou're so flexible and adaptable like if\nI said to you I've got this amazing\nopportunity I need to get on a plane\ntomorrow you never make me feel guilty\nor bad about it and that is just I've\nthought about it a lot and I'm like that\nis really hard and yes we're both like\nthat with each other but I think it\ntakes a lot to just be flexible and\nadaptable life hasn't got less busy it's\ngot more busy so I think that's a new\nfound value again that I renew every\nyear of like wait a minute you're more\nflexible and adaptable I went on a world\ntour this year like I was gone for you\nknow you're really good at that I feel\nlike you're all your state of mind and\nI'm not just saying this you're very in\ngratitude you're a very in gratitude\nperson on a daily basis with not just me\nwith literally every single person\naround you and I think that that just\npours into everything that you do uh\nwhat is the change you have made this\npast year that impacted your daily life\nputting in the work it takes to complete\nthings cuz i' have the I do the work it\ntakes to start things but I didn't do\nthe work it takes to complete things\ntill this year and so I see how hard\nthat is for people I have a new found\nappreciation for people who actually get\nthings done my goodness what a life to\nlive I just want to say that basically\nbecause I've completed things this year\nI do feel like I feel more confident in\nmyself and I think that it's impacted my\ndaily life because I've started making\nlittle Decisions by myself and I've\nstarted trusting in my own voice and\nI've started being more sure about the\nthings that I actually think I should do\nin a situation versus asking a thousand\npeople or or trying to second guess\nmyself and so with committing to\ncompleting things in my life it has come\nwith a boost of confidence in my own\nvoice and that has impacted my daily\nlife in so many ways because yeah it's\njust made me a bit more secure in who I\nam definitely not fully there but it's\nlike it feels like the beginning of the\nJourney of really understanding myself a\nlittle bit more and it's all come from\nconsistency and trying to commit to\nthings for myself and I actually really\nhave appreciated that this year I think\nfor me it's uh having an amazing team\nyour team is just literally just special\nhumans and it's not cuz they're going to\nhear it or are hearing it I feel like\nbeing surrounded by people you actually\nenjoy spending time with and as people\nnot just at work and being surrounded by\npeople that you trust and that trust you\nand that being surrounded by people that\nyou feel there was a quote that I read\nthe other day that said a great\nrelationship is when both people feel\nlucky you so have that in your team and\nI feel like having that in your personal\nlife your professional life in every\narea of your life like that's what makes\nlife special so that has made a big\nchange like being surrounded by people\nwho just have wonderful values and\nqualities I feel like you've attracted\neach other because honestly I don't know\nhow your team is so as as special as\nthey are like every every single person\nhas different personalities but the same\ncare\nattention desire and and and what's\nbeautiful is there's like you feel no\ncompetition there which is really\ndifficult to create in a work\nenvironment everybody feels so secure in\ntheir roles and how they see it as\ncollaborative thing like they all feel\nlike part of a puzzle and they all work\nso well together to do that it's so\nbeautiful I just I I appreciate seeing\nyou so happy finally because I think\nthat youve worked so hard to get to this\npoint to have people who feel the same\nway it's nice being surrounded by people\nwho feel the same desire and excitement\nas you do every single day yeah it's\nbeen really special and on that note I\nwant to say a big thank you to all of\nyou because I think it's been amazing\njust the amount of love and support that\non purpose has had in the last 12 months\nthe incredible guests we've had because\nof all of you that watch that like that\nshare that recommend this podcast to\nyour friends the amazing conv ation I've\nbeen having the solo episodes that I've\nbeen recording just thank you for all\nyour love and support because I couldn't\ndo any of it without you and it's\namazing to see the growth that we're\nhaving and it's unbelievable and so\ngrateful to you all genuinely thank you\nso much and thank you Radley for doing\nthis with me of course going on this\nlittle road trip I always like these\nconversations they bring so much out\nyou're such a good conversationalist you\nare if that's a word it is a word oh\nthanks I love it love you guys if you\nlove this episode you'll love my\ninterview with Kobe Bryant on how to be\nstrategic and obsessive to find your\npurpose our children have become less\nimaginative about how to problem solve\nand parents and coaches have become more\ndirective and trying to tell them how to\nbehave versus teaching them how to\nbehave"
