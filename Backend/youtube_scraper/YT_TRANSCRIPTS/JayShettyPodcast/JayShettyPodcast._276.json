    "transcript": "number one no electronics and maybe even\nno TV before going to bed cuz that can\nkeep you thinking but keep a notebook by\nthe side of your bed if you're one of\nthese busy people that you have so many\nthings going through your head write\nthem all down and then you'll at least\nyou know download that onto a piece of\npaper and hopefully get it out of your\nhead but the third thing that I find\nthat really does this too is eating or\ndrinking a little bit too close to your\nsleep you have this kind of glucose\nsurge that happens after you get to bed\nand it just wakes you up too so really\nmaking sure those three to four hours\nbetween your last meal and going going\nto bed is okay"
