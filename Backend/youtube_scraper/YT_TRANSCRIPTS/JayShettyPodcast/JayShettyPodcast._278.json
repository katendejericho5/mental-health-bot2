    "transcript": "I love the idea that if you value a\nrelationship in your life your\nrelationship is only as good as the\nstories you've lived together and the\nmemories you've made and if you stop\nmaking stories and memories with people\nthen you're constantly living in the\npast exactly which is so unhealthy it's\nand you've seen that in so many\nfriendships right when you're no longer\ncreating together you have nothing but\nyour old memories and after a while that\njust dwindles"
