we're like\nyay we love him and it was the sweetest\nthing like and I was like how did I felt\nterrible so I logged off cuz I no no no\nwe where's he gone it was so sweet and I\nwas just like how conscious and kind and\nthoughtful and anyway I want to dive\nstraight into your incredible journey\nthat's why we're here today to\nunderstand you the human behind this\nincredible journey and incredible story\nand I want to start off with what is\nyour earliest childhood memory that you\nthink is indicative and defines who you\nare today that is such a brilliant\nquestion this is what you do right you\nask the best questions I'm so glad you\nsay why did you st an American um you\nknow it's so interesting I come from\nEast London and you know East London is\nlike you know it's like coming from like\nLong Beach Inglewood or Brooklyn do you\nknow what I mean it's like it's the\nstreet it's the part of London that when\nyou know if you go back 30 years ago\nwhen I was a kid is just not the place\nwhere you would happily hang out I had a\nfantastic upbringing there you know and\nI think it's very defining East London\nhas been very defining of me my\npersonality you were really raised to\nyou know in a in a community to have\nhuge respect for the people around you\nhuge trust actually for the people\naround you but it was pretty devoid of\nany aspiration and certainly any any\nGlamour and I was one of those kids that\njust kind of grew up like always kind of\nlooking at what could be next and what\nwas in my future and I just fell into\nthis like fashion magazine land you know\nit's like I would do my paper out I'd\nget the money from that I spend it on an\nissue of like Vogue or l or Mary Clair\nand it was that great moment sort of\nlate 80s early 90s in England where we\nhad you know so many incredible\nmovements you know Brit pop Brit art but\nall of those supermodels you know it's\nlike Naomi and Kate Moss and I saw that\nas a means of escapism I never thought\nabout it as a potential for a job but I\nwas like let me just lift out of where I\nam and aspire to something that was\nbeautiful and aspirational because I\ncouldn't see that anywhere around me and\nso when I think about my childhood I\nthink partially about this piece of like\nEast London where there's an honesty and\nan authenticity and a level of just like\nbeing the person that you say you are\nlike living by a certain set of values\nand then this other part that was like\nget me out of there do you know what I\nmean and that's the honesty of it really\nyeah and how do where do you think that\ncomes from I think some people are like\nyou know we become products of our\nenvironment and so if some people are in\na group of people or in an area that is\nunambitious or not striving it's easy to\nfold into that where did that come for\nyou personally like was it someone in\nyour life was it something you read was\nit the magazines like where did that\nbelief come that there could be more\nthere may be more there is another place\nto go to you know I think that it must\nhave come from my mom in some ways\nbecause I honestly I didn't know anyone\nthat owned their own business every\nwhere I come from everyone worked a job\nand you work for somebody else and jobs\nwere seen as exactly that there was no\ncareer there was no vocation there was\nno like purposeful doing of what you do\nis like you get up you went to work you\nprobably found it miserable and you Tred\nto get out of there as quickly as you\ncould and for me I really thought that\nyou know there has to be a better way to\nlive I was like shouldn't there be some\nexcitement and enjoyment but I don't\nknow where I got it from the sense of\nvalue and the sense of ambition has\nalways been in me and people always say\nto me you know like how did you get to\nwhere you are and I go well it's much\nmore simple than people think you know\nit's like I really value myself and I\nreally value my goals and I don't think\nit's much more complicated than that but\nI was taught that by my mom who was very\nvery much like listen Emma you're not\nbetter than anybody else but nor is\nanyone better than you and so when\npeople talk about impostor syndrome like\nI look around I'm like that that's just\nmade up like every we all feel exactly\nthe same like deep deep down and that\nsense of me feeling like I could achieve\nwas just built in like I I've never felt\na lack of confidence I've never felt\nless than I always felt like if I worked\nhard enough and I really like put\neverything into it that I could achieve\nI still feel like that today I don't\nexpect things to be easy but I I've\nnever had a sense of I couldn't yeah\nwhat a great way for your mom to set you\nup like what an amazing recipe no it's\nit's beautiful to hear that because I\nlove that perspective of no one's better\nthan you and you're not better than\nanyone like that's such a great\nequalizer absolutely and the two things\nare really important right because I\ngrew up with such a respect for\neverybody else around me regardless of\nlike where they come from or you know\nwhat they were doing and I think that\nyou know as a kid I was surrounded by a\nlot of people that were doing what they\nhad to do to get through the day and I\nnever looked down on anyone I always\nthought well you know what as long as\nyou are doing something you find an\ninterest in something and for me that\ncame at a very early age in fashion but\nit was much more a means of escapism\nthan me sitting there and like really\nappreciating the clothing or the craft\nit was like it was a means to dream yeah\nabsolutely I love that and tell me tell\nme about you touched on it there but I\nwant to talk about your first job and I\nlike doing this with people because\nwhat's really interesting to me is\npeople forget especially when someone's\nat the peaks of their careers and\nachieving incredible things like when\npeople ask you the question of like how\ndid you get to where you are it almost\ntakes away from the fact that there was\na first job that wasn't this especially\nnow right because we have this idea es\nthrough like social media that\neverything happens overnight and I think\nyou know it's I've been grafting away\nsince I was 12 years old and like boom I\nget some success at 40 and people think\nyou're an overnight success I have\nworked every job imaginable I had a\npaper round when I was 12 until I was 15\nI worked in a delicatessan I worked in\nClove shops I served in restaurants it's\nlike I've done every job in fashion that\nyou could do at the lowest possible\nlevel imaginable while not being paid\nright it's like I've done all of it but\nactually for me you know when you talk\nabout people and your point of view on\nlife like I am a naturally POS of a\nnaturally positive distribution\ndisposition I always am a person that\nthinks about the glass being half full\nand so even when I worked in that Deli\nand I was making a sandwich I was going\nto make you the best turkey sandwich\nyou've ever had in your life and I would\nwait and look at you and be like how\ngood is that sandwich isn't that an\namazing sandwich I chose the best light\namount of turkey with the right amount\nof the pickle and I'd make it look nice\nand I'd cut it beautifully like on the\nplate and do you know do you know what I\nmean so for me I can take pride in\nanything and I also take a huge amount\nof learnings from everything so for me\nit's like I used to think well one day\nlike this will be useful to me like one\nday learning how to make a perfect\ncappuccino or making a customer happy or\ndiscussing how things work in a shop or\na dessant will be useful to me and I\nactually think about all of those\nexperiences as being very formative um\nand I enjoyed all of them you know it's\nlike I've just I've really worked and I\nthink everybody talks so much about hard\nwork but they don't really talk about\nlike unenjoyable work I had a lot of\nunenjoyable jobs that I just had to get\nthrough but i' never ever let it put me\noff I always saw them as a means to the\nend you know and so I think when we talk\nabout that now like what does hard work\nactually means it means getting up and\nthinking about the end goal when you're\nnowhere even close to it right but you\ncan see a pathway and for me it was\nalways about that I could always see\nvery clearly that I'm going to do that\nto get to that to get to that and I've\nbeen quite um been quite planned I feel\nin so many ways in my life yeah and I'm\nso glad you raised that point because I\nI feel the same way that you don't have\nto love a job to learn from it no and I\nthink we all are thinking well I hate my\njob I dislike it it's the worst it's a\nwaste of time I'm in the wrong place but\nactually if you just shift that to be\nlike what can I learn what experience do\nI not have how can I interact how do I\nnot want to behave like this boss drives\nme crazy I'll never be this boss I\nremember I had a boss like that and I\nused to literally write down in the back\nof my book like you should never ever\nspeak to people like that or call\nsomeone out in that way and I think\nthat's been so formative of what type of\nleader I want to be but the two things\nfor me haven't been mutually exclusive\nright I think that you can two things\ncan be true at the one time you can be\nunashamedly ambitious and focused on\nwhat it is that you need while also\nbeing an inspiring and empathic leader\nwho lifts other people up and so I've\nbeen thinking about those type of things\nsince I've been a boss you know for the\nlast 15 years as a direct reflection of\nwhat I didn't experience when I was an\nemployee and so I actually think God all\nof those experiences were really good\nfor me because now I know what I don't\nwant to do yeah absolutely I did a paper\nround too by the way didn't you that was\nmy first ever that was Heavy work it it\nwas Heavy work but that's where I feel\nlike I got my appreciation for the\nmornings I'm such a like early bird and\nI remember doing those paper rounds in\nthe dark in England and it was kind of\namazing cuz you'd like most houses were\nQui quiet and then you'd see this like\none house where like there's a little\nglimmer happening and I thought I\nlearned the power of the mornings from\nthat particular job like getting out\ngetting a head start I'd go home I'd put\non my school uniform before any of my\nsisters I'd be sitting there with a cup\nof tea while they were all like\nscrambling around and I was like this\nearly morning stuff there's something to\nit you know wow that's interesting so I\nused to do mine in the evening oh did\nyou because I didn't have to do in the\nmorning so I do it after school what\nabout your people getting the papers\nwhat happened to them I don't know St\nbehind that's what I was told to that's\nwhat I was talk to I don't think anyone\nread the paper amazing but I would like\nI'd walk around with my uh headphones on\nI'd be listening to em& and I'd have\nlike I know that I know that paper R\nyeah and I have this like really weird\nlooking like trolley that P around and\nthen I have to take the papers into a\nbag that bag stunted my you are bringing\nme back I believe that too I have like a\nlopsided shoulder because of that bag it\nwas so bad but yeah I learned this same\nthing like for me so all the kids in my\narea what they used to do the other kids\nwho did the paper routes they used to\nthrow the papers off the edge of the\ntrain track or like in a bush or\nwhatever it was so then the guy who ran\nwhatever company it was that did the\npaper RS he said to me goes Jay you're\nthe only reliable person I have so I'm\ngoing to give you all their streets and\nyou get paid like that quits in yeah\nexactly you're out here making money\nyeah it was amazing and and it's I love\nthat you said that that you learned and\nI love the passion I wish you were at my\nlocal Delhi like and and you know that\nstuff still happens today I interviewed\num last year I was doing a show for\nYouTube and I interviewed this Tik\ntocker called marel Washington all right\nand if anyone doesn't know who he is\nhe's awesome like great energy super\ntalented young guy and he was I think he\nworked in a Subway wow and he was he\nused to dance and sing while he served\nright and not only did he used to upload\nthat to Tik Tok he got found that way\nand now he's got this incredible career\nand I love that energy of like back then\nwhen you were doing it and it took you\nmaybe a lot longer to find that success\nhe was doing it more recently he found\nit but it's interesting to see that it's\nthe same sort of what was what was the\nhardest job that you did the most\nunenjoyable the most uncomfortable where\nyou actually looked at and went maybe\nthis not worth it like was what was the\none that pushed you to the edge well you\nknow it's so interesting it was probably\nthe job that I did before starting my\nfirst company because such a part of\nthat I worked in a fashion show\nproduction company which if you imagine\nI want to be in fashion you think yes\nthe reality of that is that you're\nbuilding stages you're working on this\nlike concept of like you know whatever\nyou're producing for three months the\nshow goes up and down in 10 minutes\neverybody goes off to the Afterparty and\nyou're doing d-g and you're\nlike this is the worst job ever and so I\ntransitioned into this role of like\nsponsorship which was so formative for\nmy for the first business that I ever\nstarted because it was all about brand\nPartnerships and marketing and\ncollaboration but but my role at that\npoint when you know nobody was just cold\ncalling right so I would just have to\nlike hit the phones and the rejection\nand you know you can't help but take\nthat person you're like I haven't made\none connection today and that I found so\ndisheartening but you know I even knew\nthen I was like this will be worth\nsomething because for every like little\nknockback you got you know every kind of\nthree days you'd get one glimmer of hope\nand you take one meeting and out of\nthose 10 meetings maybe you'd start one\nand actually it was very it was just\nlike very telling about yourself like\nwhat are you good at and now I think you\nknow as I think about entrepreneurship\nand because I meet so many Founders that\nskill of sales and storytelling if you\nain't got that like you can't do this\njob right you can't you can't sell to\ninvestors you can't craft a story to\ncustomers and you certainly can't get\ninto the heart of like what makes a\nbrand successful unless you can sell and\nthrough but it was miserable getting\nthere beond miserable I I didn't realize\nhow many different similarities we have\nin our background really so I worked at\nthe business Design Center for a bit and\nI did I did like internships then I\nworked there over the summer and stuff\nand all I had to do was sit there and\ncall to sell the stands cuz you know\nthey'd have all the different stands for\nlike the bike show or the they'd be\nfashion fortive yeah it really is and I\nremember the cold and I look back at\nthen and I remember before then I was so\nI was quite introverted shy and and then\nall of a sudden when you're doing like\n300 cold calls a day it's gone it goes\naway and it's amazing how so much can be\nlike removed from not your personality\nbut this kind of fear and insecurities\nthat we often as have as a kid 100% And\nI feel like even now you know when I\nthink about fear and what that's meant\nin my career so much because it's\nactually been helpful in so many ways\nlike I always think about myself now and\nI'm like you know it's like if I am not\na little bit scared about what I'm doing\nlike even coming here today right it's\nlike then I'm not growing like I'm not\nmoving forward I'm not going in the\nright direction and so now I find myself\nlooking for the fear I'm like what can I\ndo that's going to scare me CU like I\nknow how to make jeans I can make you\nfantastic knickers all day long but\nactually like branching out and trying\nto do something else is the stuff that\nkeeps us as humans growing and I think\nabout that all the time because I spent\nsuch a huge part of my life being so\ncrippled by fear and failing and you\nknow I I was a school I dropped out of\nschool when I was 15 or 16 I can't\nactually remember it must have been 15\nbut you know that always left me with\nthis kind of inferiority complex that I\nwasn't educated in if I'd work in London\naround all of these like very Hoy toyy\nwonderful people that were fresh out of\nCambridge and Oxford and had these\nwonderful educations and I always felt a\nbit inferior for that I was like I'm\ngoing to get caught they're going to\nfind out that I don't you know have that\neducational background I don't speak in\nthe right way and you know I feel like\nfor so long that held me back until I\nrealized no no no that's my fuel that's\nwhat makes me me and if I'm not a little\nbit scared now I find myself just\nactually looking for it cuz I know I\nneed that fire in my belly like the\nwhole time did you ever feel that anyone\never made you feel inferior because of a\nlack of the formal education or was it\nan internal I'm sure they did but it was\nmuch stronger the internal voice right\nit's like I don't think anybody you know\nwhat it's like when you're in London\nthere is such a class system right and\npeople know immediately they in in this\ncountry they think you and I sound like\nthe queen and we know in reality we\ndon't babe and in London any English\npeople listening to that us absolutely\nknow that and so there is always that\nyou open your mouth and immediately\nyou're judging you know exactly where\nI'm from and you can attribute a set of\ncircumstances to that but I think it was\nmuch more about the voice in my own head\nand I I think about that an awful lot\nnow in the way that I've set up my life\nlife and my businesses and you know I\nbelieve very much in this idea like this\nrule of thirds right I think about it\nconstantly you know when you are doing\nsomething very difficult or you are\nchasing a dream you're going to be happy\nabout a third of the time you're going\nto feel okay about a third of the time\nand the other third of the time you're\ngoing to feel pretty crappy you are\ngoing to feel bad and if the ratios get\nout of whack and things are not actually\nyou're too happy you're probably not\npushing yourself hard in enough and if\nyou know you're actually spending too\nmuch time you're probably not you know\nyou're not thinking about it right but I\ndo think that that leaning that I've had\nmy whole life like the idea that I\nshouldn't be comfortable and happy all\nof the time actually really helps me so\nmuch and I think about that idea of the\nthird and the third and the third and it\ndoesn't scare me anymore I'm like oh I'm\njust having one of the days that is my\ncrappy day that's okay cuz what I'm\ndoing isn't straightforward it isn't\nwhat everybody's doing and it's supposed\nto be difficult it's supposed to be\nheavy it's supposed to not be\ncomfortable all the time and I think\nthat that for me has been a way that I\ncan actually get through those times\nthat are a bit more tricky you know I\nlove that I've never heard Zan say it\nlike that before really yeah that's such\na unique way of thinking about so you\nsaid the the thirds are okay happy and\nthen terrible and then terrible yeah and\nI that's so spot on and I've never heard\nsomeone break it down like that simply\nyeah well I am a simple girl you know\nthat's I have to break it down like that\nfor myself but you know it's really\nhelpful because I think in any in any\npart of your life like there is\nespecially now because I work with so\nmany people there is this idea and also\nyou know I'm a mom of four right so\nthere is this part of me that's like I\njust want my kids to be all right and to\nbe happy all the time and I'm like\nactually no because it's in those\nmoments and you know this more than\nanyone of challenge of difficulty that's\nwhen you grow the most but we shouldn't\nrather than like trying to remove that\nfrom my children or take those times\naway from my employees or think that's\nnot okay it's like no no no guys like\nthat's what it's about and if you're\ncoasting through life and doing\nsomething like really simplistic fine\nyou might just feel all right all the\ntime but I am so happy when the good is\ngood that I'll take the okay and the bad\nyou know it's worth it because it\nactually all comes out even in the end\nyou know sure when when you were chasing\nthe dreams back in the day or like\ntrying to build it up were you dating\ndid you care about that was that like\ncuz now OB family yeah now you have a\nbeautiful family you have a wonderful\npartner you have four kids as you said\nlike but I wondered then like I feel\nlike a lot of us spend a lot of our\nteens and our 20s thinking about love\ntotally was that how you were too or\n100% I don't think I've ever been\nwithout a\nboyfriend I'm a person that needs a\nsomeone and I you know I went around a\nlittle bit and I I'm I'm very I was very\nhappy to settle down at 25 26 I don't\nfeel like I missed out you know because\nwe started so early I feel like you know\nI was like out in the clubs when I was\n13 14 and then I had this stint in a\nbeads when I was asked to leave school\nso it's like I've had a lot of living\nbefore I got there and I I think that\nI've always been someone that has chased\nlove like I love that feeling but as you\nget older you realize you know what that\nreally means like today it's like I want\nto be loved back but it's not all about\nthat rush you know it's like I've been\nwith my husband now for years married\nfor 11 and the things that I value have\ncompletely shifted right it's like and\nwe've been on a journey together and I\nthink that in life you need chapters and\njust as the same you know like in career\nand you need you know needing\nTransitions and to transform\nrelationships need chapters like that\ntoo the first five years we traveled the\nworld we parted we got drunk we like did\nall the things that you do and then we\nwent through a period of having children\nand that that's extremely challenging on\nany relationship especially while the\ntwo of you are enormously ambitious and\nI think that what I have with my husband\nis this extremely unique partnership\nwhere he always understood that I was\nambitious and I needed to do things and\nhe's completely supported that and I\nthink that the love that I have for him\nhas grown exponentially because we've\nbeen still I've still been able to chase\nall of my dreams outside of the\nrelationship and the family structure\nwhile having someone really support me\ndo that that's yeah we won't we won't go\ndown the extin in N that no it's really\nfun G we do a calling part go go tell me\nno I just feel like it you know it's\nlike you you have there's a part of my\nlife where I think there was a Need to\nEscape you know and I found that I was a\nreal Club kid that's what I enjoyed I\nwanted to go out for me it was actually\nnever about getting smashed but it was\nlike the music and those super late\nnights and the like that whole community\nof it like I was friends with the DJs\nand the MC's and you know like I was on\nthe list and like I did that whole thing\nI think that was a huge formative part\nof my childhood like I would not or not\nmy childhood my kind of late teens early\n20s like I needed to go and get like\nremove myself from from what my kind of\neveryday life and my upbringing was and\nit kind of introduced me to a lot of\nalternative things and people and ways\nof being and you know it's like you go\nto iifa you you learn yoga for the first\ntime I was like what's this nobody I\nknew in plasto was doing yoga I didn't\nknow anyone in IA was doing yoga nor of\nthe island\nbaby but you know it was like there's\njust there's things that I think that\npart of my life really opened me up to\nand I I felt like in some ways even\nthough I saw a lot as a kid and I was\nexperienced some pretty kind of gruesome\nthings there was a whole part of life\nand sort of a a way of living and uh a a\na kind of level of peace and\nunderstanding of people that was not\never explained to me and was not part of\nmy childhood and my upbringing and I\nlearned that much later yeah I know\nthank you for sharing that it's it's uh\nit's so yeah it's so interesting again\nwe we often feel like the next chapter\nwill be better and you've just broke it\ndown and said well no actually there's\ngoing to be every chapter and every\nchapter has its reason has it\nand you just said I love that I live\nlife that way and then when I met my\npartner I knew it knew it was going to\nwork and even that's had so many\nchapters inside of it absolutely what\nwould you how would your mom describe\nwhat she saw as a little girl to who she\nsees now I think she'd say same same I\nwas always a pain for everyone around me\nyou know I literally I was that kid I I\nactually didn't you know I didn't have\nmany I wasn't like the popular kid you\nknow my sisters were all massive\nathletes hugely popular I was a bit more\nof a loner I had like you know two or\nthree really solid friends sounds\nexactly like today\nactually but you know it was like I was\nthat kid I was like in my own head I've\nalways been a dreamer but you know my\nmom would always say she was like you're\na dreamer but you're a doer and I always\nhad those two things I don't think I've\nchanged that much you know I I think\nabout myself I'm like I've been\nabsolutely same since I was seven years\nold this is how I've always felt this is\nhow I've always been that's\nthat's so cool I wonder how you see that\nwith now being a mom too like now when\nyou're looking at your kids\nand it's wild because I think like so\nmany moms especially mothers that work\nin the same way that I do right you're\nkind of played by this idea of what\nyou're supposed to be and do as a mother\nand because I grew up with a mom that\nleft the house every day that went to\nwork I have maybe a different idea of\nwhat I'm supposed to be providing for\nthose kids I think it's really important\nthat my children see me living out my\ndreams and hopefully they'll do the same\nfor themselves but you know everybody\nthe the question always kind of boils\ndown to like how do you do it all and I\nreally think it's important to dispel\nthat myth of doing it all because women\nhave been really sold a Croc of crap\nlike it's like you you can't have it all\nall the time and my life is a series of\ntradeoffs right that's just a fact I'm\nnot the mom who is at the school gate\nI'm not there for pick up and drop off\nI'm not at the school Gara hopefully my\nkids get something else for me which is\na sense of actually living out your\ndreams and what you're supposed to do\nand I think that they will see that and\nreally appreciate having that for me but\nI think it's very important that we stop\ntalking about this idea of like balance\nbecause there is no balance in my life\nlike it it's it's rubbish you know it's\nlike I have to go wherever the energy is\nthat morning and my children have to fit\naround that nothing's changed like I\nsaid I'm still the same the same person\nand for children yes it changes the the\nkind of you know uh routine of your day\nbut it doesn't change who you are\nfundamentally and I am one of those\nperson people that think you know my\nchildren have to fit around me and and\nthat's just a fact you know it just is\nwhat it is yeah and I'll say as as a kid\nwho grew up with a mom who was working\nthat hard and like had her so so my\nmom trained to be a financial advisor so\nthat she could be self-employed as we\ncalled it in she was an entrepreneur but\ntotally the language she could manage\nher own time she could manage her own\ntime so she could be there for us so my\nmom would make us breakfast drop us to\nschool pack lunch amazing and then she'd\ngo to work super pick us up feed us and\nthen go back out to work and sometimes\nI'd join her I'd go out with her in the\ncar I sit with her my son's in my office\nwhen she was with clients and then\nshould I know I know I I should have and\nand it's just I saw my mom be so active\nmy mom was never she wasn't around like\njust hanging around the house she wasn't\navailable in that way again I'm not\nsaying that's a bad thing I'm just\nsaying my mom wasn't and as someone who\ngrew up with a mom like that like not\nonly do I love and respect my mom\ninsanely insane I also just saw that it\nyou could still feel loved without\nhaving loads of time 100% because it's\nabout quality right I always think about\nthat my kids need me like in a 100%\ncapacity like not half looking at my\nphone not half doing work not surrounded\nby lots of people in the house and I\nreally try to think about them as\nindividuals because I have a boy and a\ngirl and then boy girl twins and I like\nto do things with my kids individually\nso that I can really understand who they\nare and what their needs are not like\nthis sort of like family pack you know\nbecause it very quickly becomes that I'm\nlike a like all of you in the car um but\nI think that you know again when you\ngrow up in a big family you you have\nideas and experiences of how it wasn't\nso great and what you'd want to do\ndifferently and so I try to apply that\nbut I think for for most women it's\nreally it's really important to just\nlevel like lower the expectations a\nlittle bit and be honest with ourselves\nabout what we're capable of because it's\nreally something that I think there's so\nmuch being thrown at women all the time\nabout what you should do and how you\nshould advocate for yourself and you\nknow and and it quite frankly is just\ntoo much it is not feasible it is not\nsomething that we can all cope with and\nI think that you do what you do to get\nthrough the day and we should all just\nlike lower the expectation levels a\nlittle bit that isn't to say lower your\nambition level but that's just to say\ndon't don't feel bad about what you're\ndoing at the end of it it's like we all\ndo as much as we can and our kids will\nall be right they don't need us to Usher\nthem through every experience in the day\nand they'll be who they are they'll be\nwho they are how did you make peace with\nthat because I feel like I I love that\nperspective and I'm sure it's going to\nhelp so many people but I think people\nstruggle with this we love being the\ncontroller we love making sure\neverything's right we also so hard on\nourselves as you were just saying\nbecause people were hard on us and now\nwe think we need to be super mom and\nmaybe our mom did it or maybe our Auntie\ndid it whatever I think there's a lot of\npeople who are just like I get that but\nI don't know how to make peace with that\n100% you know it's a great question and\nI always think about I'm somebody that's\nabsolutely like fixated and fascinated\nby memories right I always like go back\nand I think about like the big important\nthings in my life what what did I really\nenjoy from last year what were the\nmoments that like adhere in my memory\nand when you do that it very rarely has\nanything to do with any level of\nperfection the best moments are the\nsporadic moments that were unplanned\nwhen you're sitting there there the kids\nare a mess you're in the garden\nsomething happened that just made it so\nand it's never the moments that you kind\nof forced it's never the things that you\nplanned it's never the ones that you\nspent like all your energy on and so I\nthink that it just becomes about like\nthis great like you've got to weigh it\nup right you've got to weigh up like\nwhat is worth it and what where do you\nderive enjoyment from and I think anyone\nwho looks at their life will actually\nfind that it's in the small stuff it's\nin those moments that you just let it\nall go and so I think it's really it's\nsuch a good exercise especially for\nwomen and moms to just kind of backtrack\nand say in the last 12 months what were\nthe single best moments that you had and\nthen you will absolutely not stress\nabout whatever it is that is weighing\nyou down today because it's never what\nyou think ever it never has been for me\nyeah and don't judge the moment right\nlike we can we're so quick to be like oh\nI just I said the wrong thing totally\nand all of a sudden I said the wrong\nthing becomes I'm messed up today I\nshouldn't be here I don't belong I'm not\nsupposed to be part of it and it's so\ninteresting I remember like there's this\nbrilliant story about when Oprah was\ngoing through this like crazy crazy time\nin her life and she turns up at Quincy\nJones's house for business for dinner\nand she said to him oh my God like it's\nso terrible it's so awful have you've\nseen the press and d and he's like what\nare you talking about he hasn't seen\nanything right because at the end of the\nday no one's watching you no one's\nwatching you like you're watching you\nmost of your mistakes is in private and\nso I often think about that because it's\nlike everybody's so bothered about their\nown stuff and what's going on in their\nhead they're not thinking about you and\nso sometimes you just have to release a\nlittle bit and I always try to think\nabout like what is real and what is ego\nyou know and so much of it is ego so\nespecially around the mom part funnily\nenough right because we're all trying to\ndo and be better than what we had and\nchange things for our children and be\nthis impossible wonderful perfect mother\nand that's nothing to do with your kids\ncuz what your kids want is just a bit of\nyou in the most simple way they don't\ncare about any of that stuff and so\nagain it really is that challenge of\nreally sitting down and speaking to your\nchildren and thinking to yourself like\nwhat actually matters and I think it's\nlike those small moments yeah yeah\nthat's well said and as I said as\nsomeone who received a lot of that from\nmy mom I I felt like I never doubted\nwhether my mom loved me or not no\nwhether she could come to my\nrugby game or not or whether she could\ncome and watch me at the class\nrehearsals or dramas or whatever we were\ndoing if she was there or she wasn't\nthere that wasn't how I felt loved she\nloved you absolutely yeah because it was\nso it's it's such a core part of my life\nI feel today I have like so much love to\ngive because of how much my mom loved me\n100% And it's not that she was there\nevery 100 so yeah and and the flip side\nI'm sure there's people who would think\nGod my parents were around all the time\nand and and I didn't necessarily you\ndidn't necessarily connect exactly neily\nfeel connected yeah you've talked about\nthis before and I really like it this\nwhole idea of like you can't have it all\nand everyone's always talking about\nbalance and I agree with you I don't\nthink balance exist either even in my\nlife because I often get that oh J\nmindfulness and meditation I'm like but\nthat's not balance like you're actually\nconstantly using these tools and\ntechniques to be back at a point of\nequinity yeah exactly yeah to be back at\na point of equinity but there isn't this\nidealized balance no when it comes to\nyou know you and your partner you both\nhave great careers you do some things\ntogether lots of things individually\nlike absolutely how does that like I\nguess my question there is what is the\none thing you both need from each other\nthat allows you to stay connected whilst\nhaving Collective Empires individual\nEmpires and then a beautiful family as\nwell on top of all of that I honestly\nthink that just comes down to love\nbecause it's different things in\ndifferent moments and if you really\nreally love someone then you do what\nthey need in that moment whether or not\nit's good for you right there or what\nyou might have discussed right that\ncomes down to do I really love this\nperson and want the best for them in\nthis thing this moment this decision and\nmore than anything you know I have such\nan admiration for my husband in so many\ndifferent ways in how he thinks and how\nhe approaches things and what type of\nfather he is and you know love does lots\nof different things but you know usually\nit grows or it dwindles right it's like\nin relationships and I think that mine\nis still growing but it just comes down\nto the fact that I love him it isn't any\nmore complicated than that we have lots\nof things that we do together and I do\nthink there is a huge thing of this idea\nof chapters and having projects together\nyou know to some extent children are\nthat because you go through this like\nyou know trying to get pregnant and then\nbeing pregnant and then having the baby\nin those early days and then those\nstories about those early days and then\nbuying houses together and doing those\nhouses up and so there is this element\nand we've asked we've also had the\nbusinesses that to some degree and in\nsome businesses we've done those things\ntogether and so there have been these\nchapters and these projects that have\nbeen extremely I'd say pivotal in our\nlife and you often see that that when\nyou know couples have kids that fly the\nnest it's like suddenly they don't have\na project anymore it's like everything's\ndone and they're like okay we don't have\nanything so we have that together but I\nfeel like in my life I'm extremely\nritualistic you know that's just how I\nam and there's parts of our relationship\nthat have taken on some of those rituals\nin terms of you know how we think about\ntime just us and not with the children\nhow we think about setting up our\nmornings and those things become sort of\nbedrocks and foundations that for for\nwhat I think is like a healthy\nrelationship yeah what what I really\ngained from what you're saying right now\nand I hope everyone's listening and\ntaking notes too because there's so many\ngreat great insights that are like\nyou're just sprinkling them everywhere\nand I'm like trying to catch him and\nthere there's I love the idea that if\nyou value a relationship in your life\nyour relationship is only as good as the\nstories you've lived together and the\nmemories you've made and if you stop\nmaking stories and memories with people\nthen you're constantly living in the\npast exactly which is so unhealthy it's\nso and you've seen that in so many\nfriendships right when you're no longer\ncreating together you have nothing but\nyour old memories and after a while that\njust dwindles so you need to\nconsistently create and that can be big\nthings or small things it can be build a\nyou know shed in your back Garden but\nsomething that you live out together and\nyou see to fruition and you create and\nyou make and I think that that's a\nreally important part of of\nrelationships yeah and to keep doing\nthat and keep getting exciting together\nabout something absolutely yeah rather\nthan just like how was your day and then\nyou're talking about your own world and\nthen their world and and all of that\nseparation you know and that's how so\nmany couples I think where it goes wrong\nyou're kind of living out the most\nexciting parts of your life entirely\nseparately and I feel with us you know\nit's like we just bought a cold plunge\nand like the cold plunge has become the\nthing right we're literally just like\nhow many minutes are you going to do how\nmany minutes are you going to do oh my\nGod are you going to put your head under\nlike you know but it becomes this thing\nthat you're living out together and now\nwe'll be like cold plunge bullies to all\nof our friends you know but even\nsomething so small like that can be so\nlike magical for a relationship CU\nyou're learning and pushing and doing\nsomething together yeah we do the same\ndo you no you don't yeah we do but my\nwife so my wife will white she's so good\nin the cold she's so good I can't even\ntried to be here CU well I married a\nSwedish man so I feel like I'm at a\ndisadvantage like from the outset you\nwere basically born in the ice like come\non like of course you're better at this\nthan I am that's amazing and then we've\nbeen playing pickle ball as well that's\nour other thing oh Pi have you play I\nhave a c but I don't think I'm going to\nbe I don't think I'm going to be on it\nanytime soon you guys come over and you\ncan show us how it's done it's so much\nfun and again it's just doing taking on\na new project a you know whatever it may\nbe you I love that you were saying like\nyou love memories and that you kind of\nalmost have a memory bank I was going to\nask you do you think there's a memory in\nyour life that you've kind of like\nlocked away or hidden away that you kind\nof like it's almost have you seen that\nmovie Inception and it's like he locks\nit away in the basement and he never\ngoes there because it kind of it has\nsometimes it can be good bad it can be\nanything but do you have a memory you've\nlocked away I think I probably have a\nlot of memories that I've locked away\nand um you know it's really interesting\nuh we should have maybe done this\npodcast like in a month I'm going to go\nto the Hoffman Institute oh yeah yeah I\nthink I have an enormous amount of that\nin my life and I said to you earlier you\nknow I think if you're not I think about\nmy life in terms of like practice right\nit's like I'm practicing every day like\nwho I want to be and I think that that's\na great way to teach my children because\nthey do what they say and I never beat\nbeat myself up about my past who I've\nbeen my background where I came from\nbecause I know that I'm constantly\nmoving and evolving and I feel like if\nyou're not working on yourself then\nyou're not really living do you know\nwhat I mean I feel like the purpose of\nmy life is to explore how I can be the\nbest version of me and I don't just mean\nthat in business I mean in every single\nfacet of my life how can I be the best\nmom and the best wife and the best boss\nlike all of those things like mean a lot\nto me but it takes work and it takes\npractice and I don't get it right every\nsingle day and when I think to answer\nyour question about memories and things\nI've locked away it's when I've not been\nproud of my behavior but those are\nalways things that I am willing to kind\nof hold my hands up to and and work on\nand I feel like I've done especially now\nI live here you know you come and you do\nthe work right it's like it's just the\ngrownup thing to do and I feel like\nthat's been one of the reasons I've\nenjoyed being in La so much is because\nI've had this whole obviously all the\nsuccess with the businesses but on this\nother side I've had this huge um\nAwakening in terms of who I am and who\nI'm supposed to be and how I'm evolving\nas a person and so I really feel like\nthose are things that I'm still\nexploring and I will be until the day I\ndie you know I'm always in learning mode\nI love that and you're invited back\nafterwards as well so you don't have to\nworry about C no what I mean is I hope\nthis is not going to be the last time\nyou come but um what what's a memory\nthat you'd love to relive or you revisit\noften mentally and you close your eyes\nand you're like yeah I'm there like I'd\nlove to live that again because it was\nyou know it's so crazy I think it's\nprobably I mean feel so bad on my kids\nbut the birth of my first child like\nthat was so insane and amazing and it's\nreally funny because women like often\nsay like everything changed then you\nknow it's like and I and for me\neverything changed in that moment I\nremember having just had gray and Yen\nwas holding him on like you know the\nside of the bed and I thought I have got\nto get out of this bed and go to the\noffice and that's all I could think in\nmy head cuz it's was like all of a\nsudden I had the reason I was doing all\nof this stuff for and it had never\nbecome more clear to me than in that\nmoment I was like okay like now Real\nLife Starts wow yeah yeah that's really\nhow I felt I was like get me back like\ninto the office like immediately oh my\ngosh yeah forget the baby nothing\nnothing about going home and like\nsnuggling with my child I was I have a\nreason to do what I'm doing now and that\ncan coexist with loving your kids 100%\nbecause again like you can be so many\ndifferent things it's like I am a super\nnurturing Hands-On mom and I really\nenjoy motherhood I just have other stuff\nthat I like too yeah why do you think we\nstruggle to have those two ideas like\nSociety has set it up that you're one or\nthe other right you're either putting on\nyour heels and like banging out the door\nand like don't see your kids and put\nthem to bed or you're like this really\nsweet Mom it's like no I'm both I'm\nactually everything I am every woman\nlike just like tough it do you know it's\nlike I think that actually what it is\nthat you know there are all of these\nlike\nmisconceptions about what you are\nallowed to be and I don't think we put\nthose same things on men because men can\nbe like totally in the office and\nkilling the deal like then just be this\nincredible dad throwing like a football\non the weekend like you're fully allowed\nand it's fine but for women it's not so\nfine and so you know so much of what I\ndo in my work and my businesses and\nactually just sort of trying to be\nhonest about me and and how I operate is\nto dispel a lot of those myths because I\ndo think that we are not onedimensional\nand you can be so many different things\nand and also so many different things to\ndifferent people you know I'm one person\nto my husband and one to my kids and if\nyou were to come in my office I think\nthey give you a whole different version\nof me I like it all over\nit it's true though we all have to\nthere's all different facets to each\npart of ourselves and I but it's about\nthe level of acceptance right like are\nyou are you allowed to be there and is\nit accepted and that's why you know Jay\nit's so interesting I don't think I've\never listened to a podcast where a man\nhas been asked about impostor syndrome\nnot once it is a question that is the\nSpecial Reserve for women as is the\nquestion of balance no one says Hey yens\nhow you balancing it all the brands and\nthe business and the kids no one says\nthat to my husband I'm glad they didn't\nask both those question I just out they\nsay it to me every day every single day\nwhat is it like to be a black woman in\nbusiness I'm like what kind of question\nis that you know but there are things\nthat for women just like we're still not\nable to get over this idea that we have\nin our heads that we can't be many\nthings to many people and I just don't\nbelieve in that at all yeah no I'm with\nyou I'm with you and and and I really\nfeel that naturally all those questions\nare coming because that's what people\nare scared about and insecure about and\nworried about and it's as you said it's\ncome because it's been created in\nsociety I read a there was this research\npaper a long time ago and I won't get it\nabsolutely accurate but the point was\nthat when men and women look at a job\napplication if men can do some of it\nthey'll apply and even if if women can't\ndo one it they won't apply I see that\nevery single day in my own office right\na guy will work for me for 6 months and\ncome and ask me for a pay rise and then\nI will say to a woman I don't think\nyou've had a pay rise for like a year\nand a half like do you know what I mean\nit's like or somebody that will come in\nand say like I speak absolutely fluent\nSpanish and a woman who's pretty 90%\nthere won't even mention it on so there\nare those obvious things and that's just\nabout you know so many times for women\nthere is this natural nurturers we\nnaturally play down our skills and I\nthink that that is just something that\nSociety has taught us and so I think\nabout it all the time I'm quite the\nopposite you know I I'll go in and\npretend I can do anything in in in a\npitch meeting or it's like I'll say what\nneeds to say to get it done do you know\nwhat I mean um but I do think that for\nso many women there is this like sort of\nmagical golden moment in your life where\nyou're free of a lot of constraints you\nknow maybe you don't have a mortgage you\ndon't have children yet you're not in a\nreally serious relationship where there\nis this moment to be incredibly selfish\nand for most women when all of the\nresponsibili pile on they stop doing\nthat and I think they actually just as\nwomen we would do better to be selfish\nfor longer in our lives and that's the\ntype of thing and and so many people\nwould be like oh I just don't like the\nword like can't you find another way to\ndress it up absolutely no because I mean\nwhat I say you do have to think about\nyourself self because nobody else is\nthinking about that for you everybody\nelse is too busy thinking about this\nthemselves and so this idea of being\nselfish shouldn't feel like such a\nforeign thing for women or a dirty word\nfor women it's like you have to be there\nis no other way to get ahead and to do\nwhat you want to do you have to put your\nneeds and your uh wants and your\nambition first because no one is going\nto do that for you yeah and it's hard\nisn't it when like you were saying\nyou've tried to be the boss that you\ndidn't have\nI can identify with that I try and be\nthe boss bosses that I didn't have and I\nthink\nit is really wonderful when you see a\ngreat relationship building with people\nyou work with where they recognize\nyou're being the boss that they never\nhad as well and you are too and you're\nalso realizing there're being a great\nperson of your team that that hasn't\nbeen like other people have been how\nhave you learned to like sense that and\nknow that when you're like okay well me\nand this person can go and build\ntogether and create together or this is\nthe right person to recruit onto my team\nor like what are the things that you're\nlooking at and trying to decipher\nbecause I think right now we do live in\na world where also people are thinking\nabout a job as a paycheck and they don't\ncare whereas you're very passionate\nyou're very driven you always have been\nsince the Delhi so it's like if you've\ncared that much about the deli and the\nsandwich obviously you care so much\nabout what you do today totally how how\ndo you do that well you know I think I'm\nreally realistic because you will have\nthose people in your business that come\nto work with you literally because you\nknow a good America we are be CAU\nregistered right and people feel like\nthey want to work in a company that\ncares about the environment that cares\nabout what they're putting out and\nyou'll get people that care about the\nmission and the vision and the values\nbut I don't expect that everybody will\ncare I know that there are some people\nthat just come and they just want their\npaycheck and so for me I try to separate\nwho I am and what I might need from what\nsomebody else might need my expectation\nis that not everybody's bouncing in\nthere trying to kill it for me right I'm\npretty sure that a lot of these people\ncome in and they do their job and\nthey're working on their side hustle\nhalfway through the day and that's okay\nyou know it's like that's not for\neveryone and I think that as I've got\nolder I've learned not to put my uh my\ntype of ambition on you know or not to\ntry to reflect that onto everybody\nthat's around me and those people will\nof course they'll rise to the top\nthey'll make themselves known but it\nisn't for everybody you know it's just\nit's just a fact and and also you need\nthat when you're building a team if\neverybody was an ambitious little\nmonster it would be a disaster you know\nyou need people that happy to come in\ngrind do their job and leave at 5:00\nthat's just facts yeah absolutely how\ndid you make that leap like you just\nsaid earlier I'm just connecting the\ndots you were like I was never around\nanyone who was an entrepreneur who had\ntheir own business everyone worked a job\nyeah how did you accident J shed\naccident go on it was a total accident\nbecause you know I never set out to\nstart my own company I was frustrated\nthat I wasn't being paid enough where I\nworked and then was like all right well\nif you don't like that then you're going\nto have to do something else but I was\nalso acutely aware that no one was going\nto come and hand me a company on a plate\nlike here's this company to run you you\nperson with no experience and you know\nyou kind of jumped up 24 year old and so\nI was very like acutely aware that I'd\nhave to do it myself um and that's where\nit came from like you know I'd love to\nsay that I had this like great idea and\nthis great ambition but it came out of\nlike frustration and not being paid\nenough and feeling like I wasn't getting\nthe value back that I put in that's the\nhonest answer yeah no and I think that's\nvery relatable I think most people are\nin positions like that but that doesn't\nlead to the courage yes to go to do it\nbecause we feel like well what if it\ndoesn't work what will my friends say\nwhat you know and all those kind of\nthings that come up because we're scared\neven for me like I remember I had a\nsteady job and I was this is after I'd\nleft the monastery come back home I'd\nfinally found a steady job I was dating\nmy it's such a good sentence after I\nleft the monastery isn't it good you\nshould wind that in any I feel like so\nafter I left the\nmonastery I was just trying to give\ncontext em this is this is the British B\nsorry Em's like ful I love it I love it\nI don't have a sentence like that and I\nwant one I might just take it bang it\nout you've got ather you've got you've\ngot plenty but no the so I was in the\nsteady job and it was like I was dating\nmy now wife and I remember going this is\nnot working for me like and I wasn't\nkilling it and I wasn't doing badly I\nwas I was I was doing all right but I\njust knew it wasn't my place yes and I\nremember I probably spent two years\nthere feeling that way totally you kind\nof just you're thinking about it\nreflecting on it you're like what do I\ndo what if it doesn't work and so walk\nus through that a little bit because I\nthink a lot of our listeners may\nactually be feeling that way a lot of\nour audience is actually listening going\nyou know what I'd love to I'd love\nforget doing what Emma's done now I'd\njust love to get out where I am now\nbecause you know what I mean I think the\ntruth of it was that I've never been\nthat scared of failing yeah right and\nfor me at that time in my life I was\nmaking a a small amount of money it's\nfair to say that I didn't have any you\nknow no one was relying on me to to pay\nrent or I had a tiny tiny little I lived\nin like a highrise in East London with\nno front door and a gate on the door no\noven just a microwave no fridge I put my\nmilk on the balcony just to paint the\npicture of like where I was at that time\nin my life it was rough and honestly\nwhat I thought is that how could I lose\nlike at this point I could always go and\nget another similarly not inspiring job\nand so that idea of like fear of not\nfailing was really key but I also was\nreally I've always been very honest with\nmyself like you know everybody has a\nvoice voice in their head and some\npeople have a voice that like chaps them\nup you know it's like I do but I also\nhave that voice that's like Emma like\nknow what you don't know like don't be\ntoo silly in this situation so I think\nthat I really in that instance where I\ndecided like let's get out of this job\nand try to go and do something else it\nwas enough understanding of it wasn't\nthat good where I was if it really\ndidn't work out I could always get back\ninto something like that but also that\nthat thing that just says what happens\nif you don't do it you know like for me\nI was miserable and I really saw a\nbetter life for myself and I was like I\nwill just regret this when I'm 35 for\nexample and so it was really about just\ngoing like you know no one's going to\ntake a chance on me I have to take the\nchance on me and then maybe someone else\nwill be inspired to take a chance on me\nwhich is ultimately what happened I left\nthat role I got employed in another job\nand then when I got into that job my now\nhusband and business partner at the at\nthat time they kind of saw me and they\nwere like well this girl's like kind of\ngood she has something and they ended up\nbeing My First Investors when I was 25\nyears old that's incredible isn't it\nwhich was which was crazy which to me\neven at the time it felt crazy and I\nremember questioning I was like why\nwould anyone invest in me and then I\nthought no of course they'll invest in\nme who else you're going to invest in\nlike you might as well I'm as good as\nanybody else out there and that's when\nthat thing started ticking in so I think\nsometimes you've just got to not be too\nafraid to lose and you know the truth is\nJay I have lost and failed more times\nthan I've succeeded right we don't talk\nabout that that's not in the articles I\ndon't post that on Instagram but that's\njust the fact like I've made so many\nmistakes before I got here and had three\nvery successful companies I had a dog of\nan agency that I opened here in a very\nsuccessful business that was thriving in\nLondon and thriving in New York and I\nopened an office in LA and I embarrassed\nmyself I complet completely let the you\nknow I let the company down I let the\nboard down I let the staff down I\nunderinvested I did all of the classic\nmistakes and you know at the time I felt\nlike it was the end of like my company\nand my career but it wasn't it was just\na failure I've had lots of things like\nthat happened lots of you know public\nembarrassments and things that didn't\nwork out and it's you know sounds like\nsuch an obvious thing but it's like well\nhow do you recover from that and so for\nme it's like always been this thing of\nlike all right well I'll dust myself off\nI've survived worse you know and I think\na lot of that comes from my upbringing\nyou know it's like you see a lot of\nstuff go down and you can get through\nthings and I think I'm pretty good at\ngetting through things and this is that\nQuincy moment where I'm like I didn't\neven know like you know it's like see\nthere you go yeah it's amazing it's just\nlike you just you know you it's so\nfascinating how quickly we are it's it's\nso fascinating how quickly we point out\npeople's faults and then forget about\nthem 100% And and it's so that happens\nso fast because it's not as fun a story\nright people want at the end of the day\nI believe in you know the goodness of\nhumans we default want good good stuff\nfor each other and we want to see each\nother win and people are very happy to\ncelebrate alongside you you're much more\nconcerned about your failures you're\nmuch more concerned about your fears\nthan anybody else out there and I think\nevery now again I kind of just have to\ntune myself back into to that piece of\nit yeah and it sounds like what I really\nlike is that you've got this ability and\nI've been watching the whole interview\nand it's like you've got this ability to\nknow what the different voices in your\nhead are yes like you're very clear\nabout like this is the one that's being\nreal this is the ego this is giving me\nthe hype that I need right now 100% but\nalso you know I know their voices I know\nthey're not me yeah and I always knew\nthat because I have an ability like my\nwhole superpower in life is about being\nable to turn it on and off and so I am\nacutely aware that those are just things\nand that I have at my disposal and\nsometimes they work to my my advantage\nand sometimes they work to my\ndisadvantage but I don't think that it's\nme does that make sense like it's like I\nknow who I am like and it ain't all of\nthat it's not the chatter none of it\nit's just I'm something else yeah it's I\nmean that's a incredible distinction to\nknow and have and build did that come\nfrom did you read something did you\nlearn something or was it just you\nstarted listening to yourself did you\nspend a lot of time alone I'm intrigued\nas to what you did to gain that skill\nbecause it's a skill and you're\nobviously aware of it you know I think\nI'm just that like Oprah generation do\nyou know what I mean you come you come\nhome every day from school Oprah was on\nthe TV telling you to be grateful you\nthink what do I have to be grateful for\nif you seen my house have you seen my\ntrainers I need new shoes like you know\nand it's like I didn't get it then but I\nstarted to believe it and I started to\nread you know I am an Avid Reader I read\nso much everything and always have since\nI was 13 and again it was that means of\nescapism and so I started reading things\nlike you know the Power of Now like you\nknow like all of these things that like\nconversations with God I remember you\nknow it's like I read that book and I\nwas like like just blew my mind because\nI didn't know anybody that thought like\nthat um and so maybe I just absorbed it\nbit of Oprah bit of couple of books you\nknow and it it went in like I understood\nit and it made sense to me no it's as\nsimple as that and I the same generation\nlike we I grew up in the same way and\nit's so true how like these tiny little\nmessages just start connecting dots and\nand that's kind of what kids are built\non and and young people are built on it\nisn't you could have heard the same\nthing at school every day but because it\nwasn't simplified and easy and\ndigestible 100 you don't remember it but\nyou remember the random TV show you\nwatched that your parents had on in the\nbackground\nexactly that's amazing yeah no I love I\nlove witnessing it in an interview with\nsomeone where you're like wow this\nperson's so aware and I want to talk\nmore about hopefully this is what you\ndon't get to talk about as much or maybe\nlike you're saying like men get asked\nthis stuff and maybe women don't I'm\nintrigued but but like we were talking\nearlier you're a brand marketing genius\nlike you're you're you're super\nattentive aware conscious you have this\nability to think about products and\nbrand in a different way how do you\nselect problems to solve how do you\nchoose which problems you want to work\non and then make sure that you build\nsomething that actually solves that\nproblem I think about it in the sense of\nmyself I think it would be very\ndifficult for me and I'm not saying\nother people can't do it but to do\nthings that you can't relate to right so\nI always start with the idea that if\nit's a problem for me likelihood is it's\na problem for other people like me\nwhether that be uh other young women or\nother women in the middle of America but\nit's like the starting point is always\nwhat do I find problematic and then I\nthink the lens and the the kind of red\nthread that goes through all of my\ncompanies is this idea that and again I\nhate saying it because in the last kind\nof five years it's almost become like\nthis sort of buzzword but when we think\nabout inclusivity in business and what\nthat actually means including and\nthinking about the most amount of people\npossible when I started good American it\nwas actually a reaction to this idea\nthat so many women women of color\nplus-sized women are just completely\nleft out of the fashion conversation and\nwhy is their dollar any less valuable\nthan anybody else's and so I had worked\nin marketing for all of these years for\n15 years I grew this incredible agency\nand i' done castings and you know put\nprojects and collaborations together for\nthe biggest and best brands in the whole\nworld and I'd been part of actually\nfalsifying an image of inclusivity you\nknow it's like you have a group cast you\nneed a black girl and an Asian girl and\nthen this and this and this and actually\nwhen you thought about the product and\nwhen you thought about the senior\nmanager M of those companies it looked\nnothing like that right it just the\nproduct didn't work for anyone over a\ncertain size and the boardrooms were\njust all made up of typically like white\nmen making the decisions usually for\nwomen and I just sort of thought to\nmyself there must be a better way to\nstart a company but it came from problem\nsolving for myself and I go back to this\nidea of like you know when you think\nabout businesses it makes more sense\nthat they would be geared towards\nserving more people that's just good\nbusiness right forget de and forget like\nyou know this idea of diversity Equity\ninclusion doing some being something\nthat companies need to do now it's just\ngood business and when I talk about it\nthis idea of inclusivity and diversity\nbeing a superpower in business it's not\nsomething that I just say it's something\nthat I do that's where the process\nactually starts I'm thinking about how\ncan I best serve customers the most\namount of people and then when there's\nan acknowledgement of someone who isn't\nusually acknowledged of course it goes\nwithout saying that suddenly they feel\nseen they feel heard and they're like\nI'm going with this girl I'm going with\nthis brand because it's the first time\nanyone's spoken directly to them and I\nthink that that's such a it's such an\nunder thought about part of business you\nknow people usually bolt it on at the\nend and I'm like no no no no it's right\nwhere you start it's in the Inception of\nthose products it's in making 32 sizes\nit's in doing nine different shades it's\nin the very very beginnings of what\nyou're creating and then you can dress\nit up and make it look nice and put the\nright kind of branding on it but\nactually it starts way earlier than that\nand so I I actually think about\ncustomers in a way that I think most\npeople don't where did you not learn\nthat but where did you learn to look to\nunderstand that obviously it started\nwith yourself but I'm like why didn't\npeople do that before cuz like you just\nsaid it's better business it's better\nfinancially it makes more sense it makes\nmore people are happy what do you think\nblocks companies just comes from where\ndecisions are being made right because\nit's like you don't know what you don't\nknow and I've sat in enough rooms trying\nto pitch enough businesses to a group of\npeople that aren't my end audience and I\nhave actually said in in meetings before\nmaybe you should phone your wife or\ndaughter like literally like phone them\nbecause you don't understand this\nbecause it's not for you you know and so\nI think that decisions are made in such\na abstract way in most companies and you\nknow you see this when you know\ncompanies make mistakes right they we've\nseen a lot of like big fashion brands\nand big consumer Brands make mistakes\nthat have seemly kind of come across as\nlike uh insensitive racist completely\nmisogynistic that's just where a\ndecision is made a company isn't\ninherently racist like the whole company\nit's just the decision-making process is\nflawed I.E there's not enough people in\nthe room of a different background to\nsay hey perhaps put the t-shirt on the\nother kid like then it won't be an issue\nso I think that this just comes from the\nthe idea of like where are the decisions\nmade in that company and who's making\nthe decisions and I know that the more\npeople you bring around a table from\ndifferent backgrounds we're not just\ntalking about race here we're talking\nabout age education the full Gambit like\nthe better the company will be yeah that\nis such great I I love what you just\nsaid about asking someone to call their\npartner or their daughter or whatever it\nmay be because you're so right like I\nthink so many people sit in meetings and\nthey looking around going these people\ndon't know what they're talking about or\nlike they just don't understand totally\nhow have you maintained like I guess the\nquestion is how many of those meetings\nhave did you have to sit in until you\nfelt like I'm just going to do this or\nwe're just going to figure it out or did\nyou look for someone who agreed with you\nand had your values and did the research\nor was it kind of like we're just going\nto build it ourself like how give give\nus a bit of that because I think a lot\nof people see me you know it's so\ninteresting I'm at that point in my\ncareer now where I don't sit in a lot of\nmeetings now they pitch me which is\nlovely the shoes on the other foot I'm\nlike come over here and I'll let you\nknow if you can come in um for I love\nthat love but in the early days you know\nI I think that I sat in a lot of\nsituations feeling like um you know the\ngreat thing is I never doubted myself or\nany of those ideas I just thought I\nhadn't found the right people yet it's a\nlittle bit like you you know I'm happy\nto kiss a lot of frogs and I always have\nbeen because again I don't think it\nshould be so easy when you're doing\nsomething that is new and without so\nmuch definition and unproven like it's\nsupposed to be hard and again it's like\nanything I never let it get to me I just\nwas like poor poor chicken he doesn't\nget it yet and he will do and he'll kick\nhimself you know and that's fine you\nknow it's just it's part of it and I\ndon't mean that in a smug way but I\nnever I never doubted what I was doing I\nwas very very clear especially when we\nstarted good American I was like this\nthing people don't understand and we'll\njust get them to understand it yeah\ndefinitely yeah know and I think that's\nsuch a great mindset to have and to not\nhave the the smugness or bitterness\nbecause that person just wasn't in the\nright space you don't know what you\ndon't know right totally it's totally\ncool I feel like that all the time I'm\nlike I'm trying to find the people who\nwant to be part of this story and if\nthey don't want to be a part of this\nstory that's totally cool of course\nbecause they won't be great Partners to\nyou down the line right it's like you\neither get it and you want to be part of\nit and you are happy to know that you\ndon't know it all right because it's\nit's about new space if like if we were\nall doing the same thing and trying to\nset up the same companies we'd never\nfind a skims exactly you know it's like\nyou'd never land on it you'd be like\nthat's too complicated that's not how we\ndo things and and you skip over the\nGreat Stuff how have you managed to\ncontinue to stay hungry and also stay\nInnovative when things are good like\nbefore you talking about I didn't like\nmy job I wanted to get out you know milk\nwas outdoors I was you know like there's\na there's a pain that pushes you in a\nbetter Direction I'm not saying you\ndon't have pain anymore of course\nthere's stresses challeng I don't have\nthat much pain I have daily I have daily\ndramas but the pain is gone you know\nwhat it is you are\nfueled every day\nby a piece of it is competition right\nit's like I I look at everything there\nis no one who knows more about jeans and\nknickers than to I look at every\ncompetitor I go out in the market I see\nit I know like the promotional Cadence I\nknow everything everybody else is doing\nand I think that that that natural um\ninquisitiveness is part of what keeps me\ngood um but at the end of the day it's\nlike I just want to win you know it's\nlike I don't feel satisfied and also\nit's like how could you it's just been a\ncouple of years there's loads of people\nthat have had successes for six and for\nthree years I don't think that's the end\ngoal the end goal is to build like you\nknow generational or generationally\ndefining businesses and that doesn't\nhappen quickly and also I'm not stupid\nenough to think like or to let a few\nyear success get to me there's a lot of\npeople that had a few year success you\nknow that's not the end game and so I\nthink about now it's about you know\nreally taking the foundations of what\nwe've built not sacrificing any of your\nprinciple\nand being toow and Thrive and people but\nthat gets more and more difficult the\nbigger you get right there's one thing\nsaying oh we're going to do business\nthis way when there are 10 of you and\nyou're doing a million dollars it's very\nvery different all these years in\nbecause there's there's no model there's\nnothing that you can go out and emulate\nwe are making it up as we're going along\nyeah how do you how do you define\nwinning now like is that how you define\nwinning or you know I Define winning now\nby doing things that excite me like you\nknow it's like we just launched this\ninsane push-up bra at skims and\neveryone's talking about it it's all\nover the place and you know like that's\nexciting to me because like some one of\nmy girls in England will call me and be\nlike oh my God I need to get that BR you\nknow it's like I love that and I still\nget a thrill from you know it's like I\nlove what I do like I genuinely really\nlove it and I just want to keep getting\nbetter at it and for me it comes in so\nmany different ways it's like I love\ngiving people opportunities I love the\nhiring part of it and getting to work\nwith all different people and I think\nthat those things for me feel really\nsuccessful but if you to ask me just to\nlike boil it down it would be like to\ncontinue the growth and what we're doing\nwithout sacrificing the principles that\nwe set the companies up with right right\nright yeah I don't want to dial it down\nbecause we're you know reaching some\nkind of like critical mass yeah yeah how\nhow do you you know we were talking\nabout that you have daily dramas you\nsaid not pains nobody talks to me when\nthings are going well my life is just a\nseries of problems you know from the\nminute I wake up to you know the minute\nI go to bed like that's just a fact the\nstress level is unbelievable and I do\nthink that's important because you\nwouldn't know that looking at me or\nmaybe just speaking to me but you know\nmy my job is not all you know trying\ndifferent Fabrics out and hanging around\nwith models that that's just not what I\ndo sadly yeah what what do you find to\nbe the most stressful thing about\nbuilding a business and what do you do\nin order to deal with it I think the\nmost stressful thing is probably the\nexpectations right that that comes from\nthe outside I honestly believe you're\nonly as good as your last launch I never\never drink the Kool-Aid ever um and I\nthink that you know I happen to work in\nextremely high profile businesses where\neverything that we do is scrutinized and\nwith that comes a level of stress it\ncomes back to that thing of being very\nritualistic I you know am militant about\nthe things that work for me you know I\nsuffer with migraines I get super um you\nknow I carry stress like in my body and\nso it's like I get up very early I wake\nup I work out I meditate I make sure I\nhave to be up before my children are up\nbecause I need like quiet time I need\ntime to like Focus I'm like religiously\ngrateful like I have trained myself to\nfocus on the great stuff in my life\nbecause I feel like there is so much\nnoise you know whether I like it or not\nand so I could be overwhelmed every day\nin the things that are going on around\nme and at the end of it I'm like looking\nup going wow the ceiling in my bedroom\nlike how could you even have a SE I\ncould never imagine that I'd have such a\nbeautiful ceiling ever you know it's\nlike I am someone who truly stops to\nsmell the roses like quite literally I\ncan find good happy joy in in anything\nand I really make it a point and a\npriority to do that every day and even\nas I have my tea you know it's like I\nhave special tea from Japan and I have a\nspecial pot that I put it in and I just\nlike taste it and every day it's like\nI'm tasting it for the first time but if\nI didn't do those things I would lose my\nmind you know I would lose my mind and\nso I think I've just trained myself to\nlike enjoy the the kind of the rituals\nand the small things and be hyper\ngrateful because there is no difference\nbetween me and all of those kids that I\nwent to school with in East London and I\nshould be so lucky it's like we're here\nin the sunshine overlooking the whole of\nLa I'm chatting to you I'm going to go\ninto my office where I'm the boss and\npeople are going to film me chatting\nabout stuff like I don't have anything\nto complain about yeah but but I bet and\nfrom what I've learned today you were\nlike that even when the milk was outside\n100% I was I was like at least I have a\nbalcony yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't have\na fridge but I have a balcony yeah\nbecause because if it wasn't there then\nit wouldn't be there now 100% yeah 100%\nif you went on a walk with little Emma\nas a memory you like held hands and you\nwent on a little walk with her what do\nyou think she'd say to you I think she'd\nsay Well done\nlove you did\nit keep going keep going yeah I think so\nwhat would you say back I say I\nam I'm trying I'm doing it I'm L walking\nforward now stop putting pressure on\nme I always sit here and I think oh my\ngoodness like I'm so proud of myself but\nhonesty J when I think about what that\nmeans for me now and the level of\nresponsibility that I feel that is the\nthing that really fuels me today because\nwhen I do something I feel a weight and\nan expectation of a group of people that\nhave been historically left out and\nmarginalized from a lot lot of these\nconversations and a lot of these\nopportunities and there is this huge\nsense of responsibility that I have for\nwomen especially sort of young black\nwomen and minority women and kids that\njust grew up poor anywhere like I think\nabout all that stuff every single day\nand I think that real success for me\nwill be when I am you know able to\nreally pull what I've got and what it is\nthat I kind of like strive for and\ncontinue to achieve and and have that\naffect a lot more people and I do that\nin ways you know like through my\nchairmanship of the 15% pledge that's\nbeen like a huge undertaking and amazing\namount of work that I have been able to\ndo but for me it's like that is only\nkind of scratching the surface and I\nthink more and more of my work will be\nin how can I help so many more people\nthat are like me you know get out of\ntheir circumstances and be able to\ncontribute more because it just is\nmesmerizing to me that I've been able to\ngo so far and it ain't because I'm\nsomething special it's because there\nwere a series of circumstances and then\nenough kind of grit and determination\nthat I was able to do it and so it's\nlike how do you put other people into\nthe same circumstances so that if they\nhave the will that they can do it too\nand so that's where I'm fixated right\nnow what's been one of your favorite\nsuccess stories from that or like a\nstory from that well you know it's so\nfunny cuz it happens again in the small\nin the smallest ways right it's like\nI'll have a CH I get hundreds of people\nreach out to me to say listen I'm\nstarting a business I you know I'm\nselling $10,000 a month from this Coen\nbrand and it's like I'll jump on the\nphone and I'll give someone some advice\nlike you know I had a girl a couple of\nyears ago she was like I think I'm going\nto get into selfes and I want to know\nhow to do that how do I structure the\ncontract anyway fast forward two years\nlater I do my first ever like ask me\nanything cuz my team pressured me into\nit um I'm like soal is just not my bad\nbut anyway so I do the first ask me\nanything and all the girls are asking me\nthe same questions right how do you\nstart a business how do you thrive and\nthis girl comes up and then she says I\njust want to let you know that I now do\nhowever many tens of thousands a week at\nselfes and it was all because you helped\nme walk through that contract and I took\nyour advice and I you know I stuck to\nthe distribution plan and did it and I\nwas like oh my God you know and so it's\nalways those tiny things for me um and\nagain that's just about giving someone\nyour time so I'm really trying to think\nthoughtfully about how I can do more of\nthat in a a more systematic and a and a\nbigger way because sadly I can't answer\nevery phone call or every DM that comes\nthrough yeah what are you talking about\nno that's so beautiful and I I think\nthat that component is such a big part\nof happiness and success like course it\nis because you're so right like no one\nwho's got to the top is any more special\njust going back to what your mom said at\nthe beginning like you ain't better than\nanyone else and as soon as you start\nthinking it or people also start\nthinking it that oh yeah that person's\nthere because they're faster smarter\nbetter or when we do the opposite when\nwe go they don't deserve to be there\nexact both of those just take it away\nand uh% I I look at your journey and I'm\nI'm so I I I like really admire the way\nyou live and think oh thank like it's\nreally it's it's such a wonderful\nmindset and it's such a strong you've\nbeen able to craft something that's so\nso resilient and and you good and yeah\nit's so what you've been able to build\nand and I'm talking about almost like if\nwe were a to physically look at your\nmindset it's so resilient because I can\nhear as we've approached it from so many\ndifferent points of view it's like you\nhave such a clear philosophy on how you\nlive who you are what matters what\ndoesn't matter and I look at that\nClarity when when I see you is like\nthat's the reason you are who you are\nand where you are it's because you're\njust so clear and and I feel like no\nmatter was what would happen either way\nit's like that is what you're betting on\nand that's what you've been building and\nfocused on I think so yeah I think so\nsomeone write that\ndown I really mean it I really mean it\nit's so kind it's so kind I love that\nyou say that it makes me it makes me so\nhappy because you never think about\nyourself in such clear terms like that\nright it\nnever you are who you are in so many\nways you know and I see that with my own\nkids they're like four people that I\nthink well you got exactly the same\nupbringing we all live in the same house\nI don't do one thing different and yet\nthey are just these like four tiny\nindividuals and at six months it's like\nyou know exactly what kind of kid you've\ngot like you know if this kid is like\nsuper anxious if this kid's super\nobnoxious like you know exactly who they\nare I'm sure there's lots of things and\nchanges coming in their lives but so\nmuch of it is just in you right and you\nknow and then you layer circumstances\nonto that and you know what you're\ncapable of what you can and can't affect\nand what you should be doing and so I\nalways look at it as like I was living\nlike a very nice very privileged life in\nEngland and I moved here specifically\nfor work and it's been wonderful for\nwork but in so many other facets of my\nlife being in La has been an eye opener\nand it's actually fueled me in a way\nthat I really never expected and I\nalways think you know if you elevate\nyour health you elevate your life it's\nlike if you elevate your thinking you\nelevate you know what your capabilities\nare and so for me it's just been\nwonderful and an amazing moment to be\nhere because I've been able to elevate\nso many things that I do and I think\nthat that should only end up in like a a\nbunch of other people being able to\nbenefit from that absolutely well said\nwrite that down print it out that was\nyeah no absolutely like I think it's\nit's incredible how you know I think a\nlot of people label La as Hollywood and\nthink of it as just that yeah but it's\nlike like I feel the same way as you\nlike moving here like my eyes have\nopened up to so many more things totally\nthat are really valuable important\ninsightful I've met people who are doing\nincredible things you know what you just\nsaid now of like opening the door and\ntrying to break down we had you know\njust a few months ago we had leis\nHamilton here talking about 44 and\ntalking about how he's trying to help\nyou know trying to help people of color\nget into the world of uh Formula 1 which\nwhich is a normal which him and his\nfather were able to do like you you\nstart seeing that happen across Fashion\nsports business and and that's so\nincredible because you start thinking\nabout all those little Emma and little\nlses and and everyone else out there\ntotally who who's just trying to figure\nout whether they have a shot yeah and\n100% they do yeah Emma we we end every\nepisode with a final five which we sit\ndown and do as a Fast Five which means\nevery answer has to be one word to one\nsentence maximum one word to one\nsentence all right myself always I\nalways ruin it because I get intrigued\nso all right okay so igre these are your\nfinal five the first question is what is\nthe best advice you've ever heard or\nreceived I wish that I could make this\nsound as powerful as it was for me\nthat's the first thing to say but it's a\ngood one it was to make a decision and\nmove on because you can be so stifled by\nyour decisions and when you are just\nstuck it just does so many other things\nto you and so I think it served me\nreally well in so many ways I I used to\nthink about it just for business and now\nI don't I think it's make a decision and\nmove on yeah yeah I always say to people\nstop trying to make the right decision\njust make a decision and then make it\nright totally you know 100% you can go\nback you can go back afterwards yeah I\nlove that that's great we've never had\nthat on show love that uh question\nnumber two what is the worst advice\nyou've ever heard or received stay in\nyour\nlane what was the lane oh I don't know\nbut someone was trying to stifle me and\nlucky enough I listened to my little\nEmer side and gave her a big old\nbeep never stay in your lane I love it\nbut it's interesting cuz I think all the\ngrowth in my life has come when I have\nstepped outside of whatever Lane I was\nin at that time and so it's useless\nadvice absolutely uh question number\nthree how would someone who doesn't know\nyou that well describe you in three\nwords I wish if you're listening to this\nyou just missed out on the best facial\nexpression you need to go to YouTube\nright now it's always such a worry I\nmean goodness me the things I've been\ncalled how would someone describe me I\nthink they would describe me as like\nkind I'm a kind person\nambitious and like not to be messed\naround with got it I like it I like the\nthird one not to be messed around about\nthe one word right that's good I think\nthat's what people think about me\nthey're like tough yeah tough tough yeah\nkind but tough yeah there you and\nambitious question number four how would\nsomeone who knows you very deeply\ndescribe you in three words sensitive\nvery\nthoughtful and um\ntough love it that's brilliant we need\nto get your husband on the exactly to\nverify to verify for sure you go tough\ntough and tough I love it and Emma your\nfinal question uh fifth to final\nquestion if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be you know very\nspecifically for the time we're in right\nnow it would be to lead with\nkindness nothing else yeah we need it in\nin every little interaction in\neverything it's so powerful and it's\nwhat I teach my kids you know it's like\njust be kind like it doesn't take much\nand it goes so unbelievably far you know\nand when I say that about myself being\nkind it's like that is something that I\nthink about every single day like how am\nI treating people what do people get\nfrom me and I'm talking about\neveryone you know like\neveryone it's just a fact just be kind\nem a greed thank you for coming on on\npurpose this was incredible

setting\nboundaries to increase happiness and\nhealing your inner child you could be\nreading something that someone is saying\nabout you and being like that is so\nunfair cuz that's not who I am and that\nreally gets to me sometimes but then\nlooking at myself in the mirror and\nbeing like but I know who I am why does\nanything else matter"
