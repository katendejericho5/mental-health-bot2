you\nfor having me here I am so happy to have\nyou we've been looking forward to this I\nremember when I DMD you a while ago and\nwe got connected you came over to our\nhome we were hanging out you've got to\nknow RI and I definitely feel like\nbefore we dive into the fitness\nconversation I felt like there was a\nsoul connection when we met absolutely\nand and I think that's what made me so\nexcited to have this conversation with\nyou so thank you for making time thank\nyou so much for having me here I'm so\nexcited and like you said there was that\nspiritual connection with both yourself\nand Rie and just yeah and honored so\nthank you so much for having me\nabsolutely well 2024 is here\nwe're already a few months in and most\nlikely people have fallen short of some\nof their fitness goals some people might\nbe kind of just holding on maybe some\npeople are doing well as well if someone\nhas fitness goals if someone has\nstrength goals how do you start by\nsetting a goal how do you st how do you\nstart I actually a great statistic that\nI just reviewed from the rise app is\nthat people were on average by week\num doing three and a half workouts I was\nlike yes something is working so far as\nas about a week ago so hopefully\neverybody keeps the momentum going but\nif you're looking to start I always say\nstart small you know you want to climb\nthat mountain one step at a time versus\nyou know doing a uh a dayong trip so to\nspeak so take the smallest step you know\nstart with 20 minutes if we cannot start\nwith 20 minutes start with 5 minutes or\neven 1 minute it and then build that\nhabit because it's about creating that\nconsistent habit day after day that will\ncarry you through you know a lot of the\ntime we think that motivation is what's\nneeded and it's not it's it's that habit\nthat we create on a daily basis so start\nsmall start with what is attainable\ncreate a daily calendar and make sure\nthat you're placing hopefully that\nworkout at the same time every day\nyou're most likely to to stick to it\ncreate an environment that is supportive\nof you working out so if you are working\nout at home create a little space for\nyourself with all of your items workout\nitems and if you're going to the gym\nthen lay out your workout clothes lay\nout your shoes the night before some\npeople actually even wear their their\nworkout clothes to sleep and because it\neliminates another step so how can you\nmake it more accessible mhm and easy for\nyourself to to accomplish that and then\nwhat is the time of day that does\nactually work best for you when you feel\nmore energetic there is no specific time\nthat is you know this is the best time\nto work out um for whatever reason it's\nlike what what time is best suited for\nyour life and lifestyle I would suggest\nif possible for most beginners to to\nhave it in the morning so you you know\nkind of get it out of the way and don't\nleave it up to chance for later in the\nday things occur you know wor and kids\nand a million things that you have to do\nthroughout the day so if you leave it up\nto chance you most likely are not going\nto do it um but if you're confident if\nyou're if you you know set that time\naside even if it's in the afternoon\nwhich is when I work out myself that's\nwhen I find it that I'm most energetic\nand when I find in the afternoon for\nmyself um there is some studies that\nsuggest that the optimal time might be\nbetween 11: a.m. and uh and 5:00 p.m.\nbut again I say when is it more\naccessible to you that's that's key\nabsolutely that let's say someone I and\nI think this is the world we live in\ntoday where we look at five minutes and\ngo what's the point of working out for\nfive minutes so what's the point of\nworking out for five minutes like what\ncan you get in five minutes you'll start\nto create a habit and that's what's key\nabout making Fitness a long a\nlifelong activity because I see it as\nnot uh you know Sprint it's a lifelong\nMarathon you want to stay active\nthroughout your entire life for as long\nas you can um so five minutes is just\ncreating that habit you won't see\ndrastic results you might see no results\nfrom five minutes but five minutes today\nfor a week 10 minutes the next week for\na week and then you start building from\nthere again that makes it just more\naccessible and creates that habit and uh\nit does take some time for for for a\nhabit to be especially when it comes to\nFitness to to be St Lish somewhere\nbetween 21 days might be when you're\nlike starting to to create a foundation\nbut some research f um shows that it's\nactually around like 60 66 days when you\nreally solidify that that habit of\nworking out so while in the you know in\nthe immediate term like it doesn't\nreally provide results that five minutes\nwill just set you up for Success\nabsolutely I think that's such a good\npoint like we look at it as like oh five\nminutes isn't doesn't have any value but\nyou commit to something for 5 minutes a\nday and you keeping that promise to\nyourselfa to turn up every single day\nthat's what matters about the five\nminutes exactly it builds that\nself-confidence too in yourself you know\nyour body listens as in with meditation\ntoo five minutes might not break you\nthrough to where you need to be but five\nminutes every day and you're setting up\nthat that habit and you're also saying\nlike yes I got this I'm doing it you\nknow I'm dedicating five minutes uh to\nmyself for myself absolutely so let's\nsay someone's listening right now and\nthey say Sonata J I'm with you I only\nhave five minutes what do I do with five\nminutes what should they do in a five\nminute workout if that's all they have\nand they're starting out yeah there's\nfive minutes just jump on uh you can\nlet's start with a treadmill you know we\ncan um just warm up for a minute do\nmaybe a few squads just some of the\nbasic movements um and maybe deadlifts I\nyou know where I'm going to this it's a\nlittle bit more more strength training\nfocused for me but um you know do\nsomething to warm you up for for a\nminute or so and then go into some\nsquats going into some deadlifts going\ninto some like major movements that will\nTarget some of the biggest muscles in\nyour body maybe do some rows and then\nyou got a few movements covered there\nsomeone's at home and they don't have\nany gym equipment and don't equipment\nyou still you still utilize your body\nweight it's perfectly fine to do so even\nif you're starting out out squat to see\nso basically just squat to your seat\nstand up squat to your seat stand up um\nyou can do hip thrust back uh of your\nshoulders on the couch feet planted on\nthe ground hip thrust body weight\nperfectly fine grab a kid put him on\nyour hips the K or any object I'm a big\nbeliever that you can turn anything\naround your house into something to work\nout with add a little bit of extra\nresistance um and it's it's doable will\nyou always fit and energetic and strong\nwas that always been a part of your life\nor is it something that you had to\ndevelop at a certain point as a kid I've\nalways been active I love being outdoors\nplaying with friends whenever I could be\noutside I would I would be on trees\npicking fruit CU you know in Albania we\nhave to kind of like Forge a little bit\nfor ourselves and or like um on rooftops\num just just an active kid I played\nSports\num so I've always been active not\nnecessarily like strong fit more active\ninto the teenage years unfortunately\nthat's shifted where you know your body\nchanges so I was trying to deal with\nthis extra weight that I was like\nstarting to carry and um I started to\nwork out for the wrong reasons which I\nwould consider is you know trying to be\nas skinny as possible limiting food\nintake to be as thin as possible so it\nshifted in that fashion and that was not\na healthy way to work out um and then\nyou know I started dealing with\ndepression and anxiety at the same time\nI think everything kind of like hit at\nthe same time and um working with\nPhysicians you know they're a little bit\nquick to push medication on you which\nwhich I I did um I did take but it\nwasn't until I found a physician that\nwas running marathons herself where\nwhere she suggested you know actually\ngetting stronger and that's what what\nmade the biggest difference for me is\ngaining that strength working out for\nthe right reasons which for me at the\ntime were mental um for my mental health\nand when I saw what kind of a difference\nworking out did for my mental health\nwhenever is when everything changed now\nI was nurturing my body for health\nversus um dieting it to to be as skinny\nas\npossible so it has taken the Journey of\nFitness for me has taken a bit of uh uh\nof a of a path of a different path\nthroughout the years and then but when I\nfound strength when I found strength\ntraining is when I found the strength in\nme and um I was able to overcome a lot\nof the things that\nwere that were Weighing on me that were\naffecting me like depression anxiety Y\nand then eating disorders walk us\nthrough\nhow just you know walk us through the\ndangers of I guess the way like you said\nthe wrong reasons walk us through some\nof the dangers physically and\nbiologically of what happens to the body\nwhen we're starving the body or when\nwe're not right really helping ourselves\nin the right way of course I mean you if\nyou're working I mean there's there's\nextremes to everything so while working\nout is good doing workouts to the\nextreme for hours on end while Mal\nnourishing the body can be detrimental\nto your physique where you're not uh\nincorporating those nutrients that your\nyour body needs so you're depleting\nyourself to uh to extreme levels both\nwith the nutrition and the physical\nactivity so um it it's it is not healthy\nit's not healthy mentally it's not\nhealthy physically your your your body\nstarts to deteriorate you know you see\nyour like gums and teeth deteriorate and\nyou know everything else that goes on\ninternally um that goes with that so it\nis not healthy it is not healthy while\nbeing thin naturally can absolutely be\nhealthy it's there's nothing wrong with\nthat but when it happens in a forced\nmanner when you're starving yourself and\nwhen you're working out to to extremes\nthat's when it becomes unhealthy yeah\nwalk us through the different types of\nexercise you obviously focus on strength\ntraining I want to hear about the\nbenefits of that but you know people are\ntrying to make sense of like do I need\nto do Pilates do I need to do yoga do I\nneed to do hit workouts do I need you\nknow there's just so much on offer today\nespecially in LA but there's so much on\noffer all over the world people are just\nwondering what's going to work I was\ntelling you earlier that you know if I'm\ndoing a workout and I'm not seeing\nprogress either in strength or physique\nor whatever it may be then you get\ndiscouraged and then you let go of it so\nwalk us through the different benefits\nof different exercises and why strength\ntraining is a priority for you in my\nactual programming I also incorporate\nsome higher intensity and I try to weave\nin a little bit of fun cardio so I do\nincorporate different modalities it's\nnot strictly you know strength training\nor and it's not powerlifting by any\nmeans is is strength training but I do\nincorporate like hit sessions and and\nsome cardio because you need I value all\nof the components uh all of the\ndifferent modalities but for me strength\ntraining is sort of like the the golden\nstandard because that is what is going\nto strengthen your bones that's what's\ngoing to build muscle mass and a vast\narray of other benefits um that not\nevery modality has you know strength\ntraining is proven to to increase like I\nsaid bone bone density and muscle m w\nwhich are so crucial to longevity and a\nhealthy longevity and you know longevity\nnow has become such a buzzword and if\nyou could do one thing for your\nlongevity is strength is strength train\nwhat's actually happening when we do\nstrength training like why does it link\nto longevity the bone density is an\nimportant part what else is happening\nbecause of strength training because\nwhat I always hear about is you know as\nyou get older and if you fall over you\nneed the strength to pick yourself back\nup but like what how is strength\ntraining in other ways really impacting\nour longevity yeah I mean because it is\nin our bone our bone density Max is\nreached at about age 25 to 30 and from\nthere we start to lose bone density and\nby the age 40 and on we start to lose\nbone density faster than we can build it\nso then what happens at that point is\nthat when we do fall we break a hip or a\nwrist and then the chances of recovery\nfrom that are much less so that leads to\ndeath I think there is like 32,000\ndeaths caused from Fall injuries in\nadults like 65 and older and obviously\nif you can build and muscles the same\nway you start losing after the age of 30\nbelieve it or not you start losing um\nmuscle mass at about 3 to\n8% um every decade so that's that's an\nincredible those are incredible numbers\nI mean at the age 30 is a little bit\nslower but then it starts to pick up at\n40 50 and then by 60 is even faster so\nif you can build as much as you can in\nbone and\nmuscle as when you can that will just\nhelp you carry um it will help you carry\nyourself through and and healthier in\nthe in the older years in the in the\nlater years of life because again you\ncan either prevent yourself for falling\nor you can recover faster from an injury\nbecause your bone density um is where it\nit it is more optimal than it would have\nbeen if you hadn't been building that\nbone mass and especially for women\nwomen are more prone to osteoporosis\nwhich is bone density loss than men um\nand by by menopause the the numbers are\nstaggering as to that bone density loss\num and for men actually even though the\nostosis um instance is less than women\ntheir causality of death their death due\nto Falls is higher than women oh wow so\nI mean a lot of the time I know it's\nlike when we're in our in our 20s or\neven our 30s we think of ourselves as\nInvincible you know we've got these\namazing bodies they're they're\nincredible of course but how do we\nprepare ourselves now when it is\npossible for the future ourselves our\nfuture self will will think us this is\nreally powerful stuff Sonata this is\nreally going to connect with the\naudience to hear these reset studies and\nrecognizing the changes that are\nhappening in every decade because I\nthink so many of us like you said and I\nremember that I remember being 22 years\nold and thinking I was Superman right\nand thinking nothing could defeat me and\nI remember my dad kept telling me you\nneed to focus on your health you need to\nfocus on your health and I was like I'm\nhealthy it doesn't matter and then you\nknow when I had a couple of my own\npersonal challenges with health it\nreally kind of stuck with me as to what\nan investment it needed to be what are\nsome of the\nbiggest things that you consistently see\ngetting in people's way when they're\ntrying to get fit and stronger what are\nthe challenges the most common ones that\nyou see people that you've trained over\nthe years that you find they struggle\nwith well the first one is relying on\nfeelings a lot of people rely on\nmotivation I don't feel motivated so you\nknow how or how do you get motivated to\nwork out a lot of the time I just am not\nmotivated I don't want to necessarily\nwork out the coziness of the home is is\na lot better than you know getting up\nand getting moving but it's uh we we\ndon't rely on that you know you take\nthat you take those feelings you put\nthem aside and you put your shoes and\nyou keep going cuz that's what you do\nit's like brushing your teeth you\nthere's no there's no for me there's no\num it's a non-negotiable working out is\na non-negotiable not just for right now\nnot because of Aesthetics but for\nlongevity like we were talking about\nquality longevity um Aesthetics come\nit's beautiful once you do the things\nthe right things for your body with\nnutrition and working out\nAesthetics are a byproduct that will\ncome because a lot of people take that\napproach of like wanting to look a\ncertain way which I find can be\nmotivating but for it's it's shortlived\nespecially if the results are taking a\nlittle bit longer which could take\nlonger for some people but if you are\ndoing it again for those right reasons\nfor the reasons of like I want to be as\nstrong as I can in this body so this\nbody can carry me forward in a\nhealthiest possible way for as long as\nas uh as possible so that is the the\nbiggest one that I face is like how do\nyou how do I get motivated how do I stay\nmotivated it's like act don't wait for\nthe feelings act um the other thing is\nI'm too busy I'm too busy there's always\ntime I'm sorry but you can always make\ntime for yourself you can find that time\na lot of the time we find I'll even\nthere there's been even arguments back\nand forth with people on Instagram you\nknow I don't have time yet two hours\nlater they're still responding to that\nsame chain of communication well you had\ntwo hours right there you have time A\nlot of the time is just we we analyze\nyour day just analyze your day as to\nwhere you're you're spending time that\nyou could carve out not saying don't\nwatch TV or don't don't be on social\nmedia TV exactly do that how can you\nincorporate it I found that for me\nincorporating is so exactly and I'm I'm\na big big believer of like not doing All\nor Nothing mhm so even when it comes to\nnutrition it's like you want to eat a\nburger fine just how can you maybe take\none of the sides of the bun out you know\nwhat I mean how can you substitute half\nof the fries with a salad just like\ndon't don't completely take things out\ntry to incorporate uh in your life so\nfind out there there's definitely always\na little bit of time that you can find\nabsolutely yeah when going back to the\nfeelings Point yeah I found that things\nthat are good for me feel bad before yes\nbut feel amazing after exactly and the\nthings that are bad for me they feel\nreally good before but they don't feel\nso great after and so I'm the same as\nyou when I wake up in the morning I\noften go on a hike that's like how I\nlike to start my morning I like fresh\nair I'm going out for a walk I like\nsweating and I like being active and I\ndon't want to do something too strenuous\nbecause my day is quite bus\nexact and I found that when I wake up in\nthe morning I don't want to out I don't\nfeel like it and you're so right that I\njust have to say to myself I have to\nremind myself but I know how I'll feel\nafter and when it comes to eating a\nburger trust me I want to eat a burger\nall the time and I have to remind myself\nbut I know how it's going to feel after\nand so it's almost like you've got to\nconnect your brain to the after feeling\nabsolutely because the after feeling is\nso much more what you have to live with\nbecause the feeling before kind of comes\nand goes exactly I want to eat a burger\nI ate a Burger now I don't feel so great\nI don't want to work out I ignore\nworking out I didn't work out now I\ndon't feel so great right and you're\nliving with that feeling after for much\nlonger than you're living with the\nfeeling before very true very true so\nthat's definitely help me and and the\nbusy one is so true I mean\nI feel like if I work out while watching\nI love watching football soccer\nhighlights I miss watching soccer and I\ndon't get to watch it uh full I don't\nget to watch full games anymore because\ndifferents because I live in LA the\ngamees or in London or England and I\nwill put on a highlights of the game\nwhich are like 20 minutes and I'm like\nthis is perfect for a 20 minute workout\nI can watch the highlights I can work\nout and it's going to force me to get\nthrough 20 minutes whereas if I didn't\nhave the highlights on I know I'd give\nup in like six yeah and so when the\nhighlights are on I know that I'll be\nable to get through a full 20-minute\nworkout which is what I'm trying to do\nif I'm traveling or or moving around so\nI I love that idea of\nincorporating things incorporating\nthings and and that's true when it comes\nto creating habits that that are tough\nto to create in the beginning it how can\nyou tack on something that that is is\nenjoyable like a little bit of a reward\nsystem and a reward system doesn't have\nto be that I get to eat you know\nwhatever I want afterwards what is the\nright reward system for being fit\nbecause I think a lot of people think it\nisting getting to what you want yeah\nyeah yeah could be you know like you\nsaid you you like to watch the\nhighlights you know a show that you that\nyou enjoy or another activity that's\nenjoyable you know or if you want to\ntreat yourself find maybe when it comes\nto food find a a healthier option I'm a\ngreat believer also in substituting you\nknow a lot of the recipes that I post\nare I have a sweet tooth a major sweet\ntooth so how can I create recipes that\nare healthy that will satisfy and will\ntaste just as good as the\nnaughty uh food so it's just for every\nperson it could be it could be different\num what that reward for them is but tack\nit onto it and you know our um in in the\nWe rise app we have Dr Gina who's a\nhabits expert habits building expert one\nof the I think four leading um uh\nresearchers of habits and she has so\nmuch input and so much information on\nhow to make habits sustainable you know\nI wish I had a Dr pocket G that\nI ask yeah but yeah she she'll have such\nan amazing uh insight as to how to\ncreate and sustain these habits yeah\nwhat's the biggest misconception with\nstrength training what do you think\npeople get wrong that woman will get\nlike bulky and big and and gigantic\nthat's like the biggest thing is like I\ndon't want to get too bulky I don't want\nto get too big that's what you hear a\nlot that's what I hear hear a lot and\nthat is a huge misconception because uh\nin females our hormones are do not allow\nus to get to the levels that for example\na man's physique can get naturally it is\nnot biologically uh I there's obviously\ndifferent levels of hormones in\ndifferent women that will promote growth\nin some more or less than others but I\nalways say at the very at the end of the\nday you can just back off back off you\nif you are feeling but I guarantee you\nthat once you start gaining a little bit\nof muscle you will be addicted you will\nbecause the the the the feeling of\nstrength and confidence that it that it\ngives you like a stronger body gives you\nat least for me and for the people that\nI've worked with those feelings that it\ngives them are far outweigh any any\nnegative uh misconceptions I'm going to\nsay misconception because it is it's\nyou're not going to get big you're not\ngoing to get huge you're not going to be\nlike\nHulk I know I know Ry loves strength\ntraining like it's such a passion of\nhers and she loves that feeling of being\nstronger and loves that feeling of like\nit's it's amazing to see because I think\nyou are right that we have this worry\nthat our body's going to change and look\na way that we don't want it to look yeah\nyeah yeah yeah what should someone eat\nright before a workout and right after\nespecially a strength training workout\nso at before a workout about an hour\nmaybe 30 minutes at uh at most because\nyou don't want to eat too close I would\neat um a combination of protein and\ncarbs maybe a little bit higher in in uh\nin carbs and then afterwards um meal\nthat is higher in protein so at least at\nleast 20 grams of protein in that meal\nafter the workout I mean the the studies\nare a little bit over the all over the\nplace when it comes to this obviously\nfor somebody that's been working out for\na long time you're a little bit more\nflexible with that uh or for somebody\nthat is um trying to that is trying to\nto gain muscle mass or weight again it's\na little bit more flexible versus a\nbeginner then you have to be a little\nbit more strict with strict a little bit\nmore on top of of your nutrition when it\ncomes to not just before and after but\nthroughout the day and at the end of the\nday is what you're consuming throughout\nthe day that is most important are\nyou're reaching so not so focused CU a\nlot of people focus so much on before\nand after I would start with how do you\nfeel before a workout do you feel you\nknow if you're working out in the\nmorning and you're energized enough um\nthen feel free to work out on an empty\nstomach that's completely fine even if\nyou can carry that energy through if you\nfeel like you need to have a little bit\nof nutrition beforehand that's great too\nit's how how do you optimize for\nyourself how do you optimize for\nyourself how did genetics play a role in\nachieving your goals genetics they do\nplay a role a big role in the sense that\nwell genetics will not get you out of\nbed because a lot of the time you know\nuh people see my physique and say you\nknow it's all genetics I actually had to\nfight against a lot of my genetics to\nget out of bed and work out my I'm\npredisposed to to depression and anxiety\nso battling those uh those factors\nthat's a genetic factor that goes into\nplay but then when it comes to actual\nphysique building um yes it will you\nyou'll vary as to like the muscle mass\nthat you'll put on but you can always\nimprove you know there's not let's not\neven bother working out because I don't\nbuild bigger muscles you know you don't\neven know till you've tried to what\ncapacity you can build genetics will\nplay a bit of a of a of a factor in the\nbody that you're trying to achieve you\nknow some people will carry a little bit\nmore weight around their stomach so\ntheir abs will not be as uh easily uh\nvisible as others so they'll have to in\na healthy way potentially diet if they\ncan but uh to see the the visible\nabdominal abdominal abdominal muscles\nnot that that that is a golden standard\nof anything just hypothetically saying\nthat it will take them longer than\nothers to to do to to achieve that yeah\nbecause again genetics do play a role in\nthat talking about that what is\nthe health benefit of having a lower\nbody fat percentage like what is the\ngoal right because we know that people\nare trying to lower their body fat\npercentage in order to have abs but\nwhat's the actual health benefit of\nhaving a lower body fat percentage even\nwith that you want to maintain a\nhealthier one you so you don't want to\ngo too low you don't want to be too high\nif you're going too low then your\nhormones start to to get messed up and\nwe don't want what happens if it goes\ntoo L um if it goes too low so then we\nstart to you know women will start to\nmiss their period so it will affect them\nthat way obviously that puts the body in\na little bit of a frenzy it's not\nhomeostasis anymore um when he goes too\nhigh then you're starting to deal with\ncardiovascular issues um you know\ninsulin resistance and all of the things\nthat will then lead to an unhealthier\nindividual so there's a range there that\nwe should be talking about cardio you\nsaid that you incorporate cardio yeah\nhow much is cardio important in a\nstrength training practice and how much\nis it not needed the question would be\nwhat are the reasons for adding cardio\nso are you adding cardio because a lot\nof people think that cardio is what's\ngoing to help them lose weight and\nthat's not NE that's not true um it's\nit's all about calories in versus\ncalories out so if you're talking about\nstrictly losing weight is how many\ncalories are you putting in your body\nand how many calories you're expending\nso if you're deciding to utilize\nstrength training as a way to expend\nthose calories great if you're utilizing\nuh cardio great there is some studies\nagain that suggest that you'll get\nfaster into that fat burning phase if\nyou're doing strength training before\nand then cardio after and also cardio if\nyou're doing strength training also\nbefore and cardio after you're you're\nnot compromising your strength training\nprocess um as if you were to do cardio\nbeforehand how much\ncardio that also is an IND individual\nbasis um cardio a lot of people hate\ncardio U so what I try personally to do\nI'll incorporate it on upper body days\nso I'll do somewhat of an interval\ntraining so I'll do an exercises upper\nbody focused and then 30 seconds to a\nminute of sprinting and then another you\nknow exercise or set of an upper body\nfocused and then so that's what how I\nmake it finding my personal training and\nfor everybody in the We rise app and\nobviously if you're wanting to add more\ncardio because you feel like you know\nadding a a a steady state cardio session\nafter a separate day a separate part of\nthe day um because you're wanting to be\nat a more of a caloric deficit that's\ncompletely fine as well it sounds like\nyou don't like cardia I don't love\ncardia that's good for us to know I I so\nI ran marathons and and that was great\naround three marathons I I enjoyed it\nyou do put your body through a lot but I\nhave found personally what I've achieved\nthrough strength training when it comes\nphysically and mentally has been far\nmore rewarding than cardio there's some\nyou know benefit to cardio in the sense\nthat some people feel more of the\nEndorphin and the Feelgood hormones\nduring H sessions or cardio so there is\na benefit to that um and at the end of\nthe day what is so while so let's say\nwhile I value strength training pick\nyour poison at the end of the day or\npick your remedy I should say pick your\nElixir you know what would that be for\nyou as long as you can get some activity\nin so while there is hierarchies of you\nwhat you want to achieve so if you want\nto build muscle strength training really\nis like the golden standard right but if\nyou know you absolutely hate it um it\nwhat is your activity of choice at the\nend of the day is what I would say walk\nme through what your regime was for\nrunning the marathons like what what did\nyou how did you build up to that what\nwas your practice what was your workout\nroutine and nutrition plan I wish I\ncould say that I followed one of the one\nof the plans this was quite a few years\nago um that kind of buil\num slowly and it worked on like hill\nhill Sprints and and you know just a\ndifferent variety of of things that you\nneed to work on when you're running a\nmarathon but it basically started to\nstarted with three miles and then\nincreased to five miles and then after a\nweek or so increase so incrementally\nincreasing the length that I would run\ntill I got to the to the marathon I\nguess yeah never you never run the whole\nMarathon when you're doing when you're\npracticing it's more like up to like 18\nmiles but it was just slowly over time\nbuilding up to that yeah and definitely\nfeeding\nthat that that those calories that were\nburning almost couldn't couldn't keep\nthe weight on me at that point yeah\nbecause you're spending so much energy\nwhat would you now say is a great\nnutrition plan while someone's strength\ntraining like what kind of things have\nyou found to be really integral and\nuseful to have and then what have you\nfound to be useful to leave out\ndefinitely prioritizing protein so if\nyou're consuming about 8 to to just a\nlittle bit over one gram per pound of\nbody weight of protein per day that's a\ngood place to be and then filling the\nrest with carbs and and fats um but\nthat's what I always say prioritize\nProtein that's what's going to help not\njust building muscle but just your pH\nphysiological iCal um needs you know\nprotein is the building block of our of\nour body and what you can leave out is\nthe infamous sugars you know the refined\nsugars and um so opt more for uh for\ncomplex carbs um I still like eating\nfruit I know there's been fruit suddenly\nhas become controversial like if you're\neating fruit and vegetables you're good\njust uh fit into the macro um what\nespecially if you're starting out and\nyou want to you have a specific goal it\nis important to find out what your\nappropriate macros are for for the day\nand macros are the macronutrients so\nwhat are what is your daily intake of\nprotein carbohydrates and fats um but I\nalways prioritize protein and with the\nprotein I mean most of us are not\ngetting close to that most of us are not\num like I said for let's say 10\n20 pound person like a gram so you need\n120 grams of protein uh or around that\nper per day so you know there in a piece\nof like palm of your hand of of of uh\nlet's say chicken there's like 20 gram\nof protein so you need to be a little\nbit more um Discerning of your meals\nso always include protein with every\nmeal and maybe even with your snacks\nyeah I think for most of us if feels\nlike protein takes up probably that 20 G\nand then we're filling the rest with\ncarbs fats and everything else but I've\ndefinitely found that when I first\nlearned about that I just couldn't\nbelieve how hard it was to actually\nprioritize getting and I'm doing that\nplant-based which is even harder it even\nfor my friends who eat me even they were\nsaying just how challenging it was for\nthem like it's not easy across the board\nand so raising that up to that yeah yeah\nit is it's important especially as we\nage Believe it or not like we we need to\nintake even more protein you've shared\nso much amazing research and studies\nwith us today are there any others that\nreally come to your mind that you think\nthis is really important for women to\nknow or this is really important for\nstrength trainers to know because some\nof the studies you've shared with us\nhave really been powerful yeah I mean\nthe the the muscle loss is huge the um\nlike I said the 32,000 deaths per per\nyear which actually crazy enough has has\nalmost doubled from like 2012 to 2021 if\nI believe if I remember correctly and I\nwonder what's gone into that like why\nthere's been such a drastic increase and\nlike that's due to Falls during um this\ntime like maybe we've become less um\nwe've become less mobile uh maybe\nthere's medications in the market that\nare affecting our bone density it's\nactually when it comes to to depression\nand anxiety mood disorders it is has\nbeen found that even as little as 150\nminutes of activity per week can relieve\nsymptoms to about 40 to 60% 42 to 60%\nwhile as compared to psychotherapy and\npharmaceuticals the numbers\nare uh 20% to 30% in relief of symptoms\nso even the highest the higher upper end\nlimit of\npharmacological products and uh\nPsychotherapy doesn't even come close to\nwhat you can achieve by physical\nactivity and that's only at 150 minutes\nper week so to me like that's that's\nmindblowing what you can achieve because\nand I'm not negating the need for\nPsychotherapy or or far pharmacological\nproducts absolutely you know where it's\nnecessary but why not start with\nexercising like start there you will\nachieve results that might be even\nhigher than what you can do with with\npharmaceutical products that's like just\nover 20 minutes a day yeah exactly just\nover 20 minutes a day that's incredible\nyeah absolutely that's pretty amazing to\nknow I mean wow like yeah and the\ndifference too like you're saying\ninstead of 20 to 30% reduce 40 to 60%\nreduce so double on both the upper and\nlower and liit exactly exactly that's\nyeah and and you're right again we're\nnot telling anyone not to take things\nthat they need to take but absolutely\nthe idea that why not have the full\npackage like exactly why not have the\nfull package that's what it is because a\nlot of the time it can be that\nPsychotherapy or pharmacologics don't\nnecessarily work for for some people I\nthink there is some statistics of like\naround 40% of the people don't\nexperience the relief that they need so\neither in conjunction or starting with\nan exercise program that will provide\nsign ific relief I mean firsthand I'm\nstanding here as somebody that has um\nachieved that kind of relief without now\nbeing on any\nPharmaceuticals um I I this is why I\nwork out every day I don't want to\nexperience those symptoms of depression\nand anxiety uh any ever so this is why I\nkeep\ngoing so powerful so powerful so\ninspiring to hear that as well thank you\nso inspiring to hear that what what was\nit for you that was causing that where\nwas that coming from for you personally\nH it's been I mean there's so many\nfactors I think you when you're talking\nabout being anxiety and depression\nexperiencing that I\nthink some of it is genetic um some of\nit\nis being a teenager and moving countries\ngoing from Albania to to the United\nStates and completely in a new world a\nnew space um my family didn't know\nEnglish at the time I was the only one\nthat did so I had to support them so I\nhad to assume the role of an adult at a\nfairly young age so I was 145 at the\ntime where I had to become an adult in\nmy family so I think there's a\ncornicopia of like things that that kind\nof came together for me to experience um\nanxiety and depression and trying to fit\nin and not you know being a foreigner at\nthe time and the teenager and being\nbullied and made fun of um all kind of\nlet pave the path a little bit for me to\nexperience that and um I do feel for for\nfor teenagers and I do feel for the um\nthe the generation that is that that is\nliving through through these times it's\nnot easy it's not easy\nbut find find find comfort in that\ndiscomfort of working out and and that\nphysical activity because it will help\nabsolutely thank you for sharing that\nthank you so much I wanted to talk to\nyou a bit about steps what's your take\non the 10,000\nsteps it's a good place to start like I\nsaid like walking that's that's that's\ngreat uh 10 to 12,000 my uh my dad does\nit every day he's committed to it uh\nit's a good starting point it's a good\nstarting point but it's how you make\nthose steps Quality quality steps you\nknow do you work out every day of the\nweek most days but I do you have a rest\nday I I find that it is great to keep\nyourself active even if it's something\nlight so if I'm not working out I'll go\nfor a long walk or a hike I think it's\nso important to keep ourselves active\nbecause we do end up spending most of\nthe day sitting so even even working out\nfor an hour a day if you spend most of\nyour day sitting it doesn't negate that\nsitting so it is important even speaking\nlike throughout the day to get up and\nand and take a little bit of a walk like\nevery half an hour every hour so I do I\ndo try to keep active every single day\nso if I'm not doing a full workout I'll\ngo for a walk like I said or a hike no\ndays off no days off really no days off\nI love it a body and stays in motion\nyeah yeah no I know what you mean it's\nit's so interesting how much yeah\nstaying sedentary is the cause of so\nmany of our issues we had Dr Daran sha a\nfew months back and he talked about the\nidea of just how much our quality of\nlife changes because we're not getting\nup exact from our seats all day whether\nwe're at our desks or work or wherever\nelse it may be and so I love what you're\nsaying about the idea of moving even if\nit's not a full\nyour rest day is my best workout day\nbasically basically my ideal workout day\nshe's like I go on a hike when I'm not\nworking out and I'm like here I am going\nmy hike is my workout I love I love that\nyou do you work out my best is your\nyou're you're you you just told me you\nwere into calisthenic so yeah you work\nout yeah that's so funny I love it um\none thing I wanted to dive into you\nabout as we're coming to a close here is\nyou train some of the most well-known\npeople in the world who seem to work\nreally hard obviously Kim's been on the\nshow and we always see Kim posting you\nand and you guys training together what\nwhat have you learned about training\nwith her what have you learned about her\nfrom training with her so one thing that\nI've learned about Kim with training\nwith her it's her dedication she she\nshows up shows up on time and it's ready\nto to go never does she complain or\nbacks away from something that I put her\nthrough and I put her through a lot and\nshe never backs away she never backs\naway she always pushes through wow\nthat's very impressive I'm not surprised\nshe did say her workout was one of her\nfavorite things she's very dedicated for\nsure yeah and you guys get organized\nright if she has a shoot coming up or\nshe's got a specific outfit to wear for\nan event like you get really we we we\ndial it in we dial it in for sure I you\nmoved to LA\nfor I did and I ended up staying here\nfor a little bit longer than I was uh\nyeah was expected what was it like when\nshe first reached out you and said I\nneed you to come over what was that like\nwhat was that conversation like yes I'll\nbe\nthere um because obviously it is cim but\nI believe in working with these people\nthat have such high influence because of\nthe impact that they will have on the\nlarger population so if they can send if\nthrough them I can send a message of\nstrength for women so strength is\nbeautiful strength is confidence\nwhatever that looks like strength\ndoesn't have to to come with big muscles\nyou know but if I can send that message\nof strength to especially young women\nthen to me I've done my my purpose is\nfulfilled it's beautiful what's the\nfirst thing you ask someone when they\ncome to you anyone that comes to work\nwith you what's the first thing you ask\nthem how serious are you about this\nright yeah how serious are you about\nthis like are you know are you going to\ngive me a day here and there\nbecause that's just not going to achieve\nanything for you or or or myself so uh\nyou have to be serious about your health\num and I I'd like to make it even though\nsomebody comes to me saying that they\nneed to look look a certain way I always\ntry to make it about Health and\nLongevity yeah it's similar in coaching\nactually whenever I take on a client I\nfound that clients who are willing to\ndedicate and commit time exact see\nphenomenal results I've had clients that\nI have met\nfor 2 hours a day every day for 2 years\nand I had clients that I met twice a\nweek Thrice a week for three to six\nmonths and then I have someone who's\nlike kind of checking in once a month\nkind of checking once a quarter cancel\ndoesn't have and you just start to\nnotice and and it's hard because it's\nnot that someone is not wanting to work\nhard or it's not that they're a bad\nperson or a weak person just people have\ndifferent discipline levels absolutely\nbut it's like in order to really see an\nimpact and see the results there has to\nbe that commitment there to be that\ncommitment absolutely you talked about\nthe purpose of strength training what is\nthe purpose of workouts like Pilates and\nyoga and and other forms what what is\nthe purpose of those kind of workouts\ncompared to strength training they like\nI said I respect and utilize have\nutilized myself all modalities you know\nI love yoga but I think they're are\ngreat additives they're great in\naddition to strength stren training\nbecause they will not most likely build\nuh muscle mass in the way that strength\ntraining can MH they will build maybe\nendurance they will build some endurance\nthey'll build um flexibility and some\nstrength but not to the level that\nlifting weights uh will will will not in\nso in the way that lifting weights will\nbuild your bone density um yoga and\npilates unless you're doing some crazy\nyoga\npilat um they they will not do that so\nbut again there is a\ngreat place and time in addition I\nbelieve to strength training to\nincorporate yoga and pilates what's the\ndifference in the workout you prescribe\nto someone who wants to gain muscle\nversus someone who wants to lose weight\nthrough strength training they don't\nhave to be the same at all they they\ncould be one and the same because again\nat the end of the day um um when you're\nbuilding muscle you're you're\nchallenging yourself you're challenging\nyour muscles with a weight that you're\nyou're lifting which is expanding\ncalories and that's what you need in\nweight loss as well you need expenditure\nof calories that but at a caloric\ndeficit so that's the only changing\ncomponent is that caloric deficit so\nit's more in the nutrition versus in the\nworkouts I mean there is you know you\ncan work out um you can challenge\nyourself with the duration of the\nworkout and then maintain your nutrition\nor you can um eat less basically so be\nat a deficit in in calories and then\nlose weight so doesn't have to be the\nany difference there it's just how you\nmanage nutrition versus output got it\ngot it and if you're working out on your\nown without a trainer it's much harder\nhow do you know what to add to make it\nmore challenging to to continue to get\nstronger or to continue to sh shift\nbecause I find like most people are\nworking out with that or trying of\ncourse they can use the Weise app and\nhave that that's what the Weise app does\nright absolutely so I'll give you the\nguideline if you you'll give you the the\nworkouts what you can do on your own is\nchallenge yourself with the weights that\nyou're lifting so if for example the\nrecommended uh reps are between 8 and 12\nwhen you get to that 8 or 10 9 10 12 rep\nlike how are you challenged can you do\ncan you do 10 more if you're doing 10\nmore after that or if you can do you're\ndoing you're doing too little weight so\nyou need to increase the weight that's\nwhere you have to keep in mind I also\nvalue strongly that mind muscle\nconnection um so truly thinking about\nthe working muscle there actually\nstudies that that show that if you are\nthinking of the muscles that you're\nworking that that actually creates um\nthe muscle gets bigger uh there is there\nstudies to that so if you are slowing\ndown the movement thinking about the\nmuscles that you're working I some times\ntry to touch you know this is working it\nsends that signal from your your your\nbrain to the muscle that hey we're\nworking here we're working here and that\nwill increase strength will increase\nmuscle mass actually yeah I've heard\nabout that stud the idea of people\nalmost doing weights in their mind yeah\nyeah yeah there were studies that they\njust simply just did that without any\nweight lifting and uh they found uh\nsignificant difference yeah yeah yeah\nthat's the power of the mind is\nincredible what what else have you done\nfor the power of the mind to affect your\nbody like what other practices have you\ntaken on at a mental or spiritual level\nthat you feel have positively impacted\nyour physical health well meditation um\nis huge in my opinion for mental health\nbut also if you're wanting to visualize\ncertain results I feel like whenever\nI've been in a place where I needed to\nI've competed for example um in in in\nbodybuilding competitions in the Bikini\nlevel\nso that I found when it came strictly to\nlike the physique if you are it's it's\nbasically manifestation you know at uh\nat that cellular level when you're\nthinking about the way that you want to\nto look um or feel or present yourself\nso meditation is huge I try to\nincorporate that every day um\njournaling um also gratitude every night\nbefore going to bed I practice gratitude\nnot sure how that relates to the\nphysique but it relates to the mental\naspect for your body absolutely\nabsolutely I had to learn that I had to\nlearn that I I definitely was very\ngrateful for my mind and my intelligence\nand my abilities but I'd always feel\nlike my body was letting me down and\nthat negative approach to my own body\nonly made my body let me down more\nabsolutely it's like someone in your\nlife if you feel like that person in\nyour life always lets you down guess\nwhat they end up let they're going to\nlet you down because you're going to\nlook for that yeah exactly and so I was\nalways talking to my body subconsciously\nin that way where I was like oh my mind\nis amazing but my body lets me down and\nthat Lang the words that we use are so\nimportant you know just in the in in\nthis recent Journey that just shared\nabout before with you um that was one of\nthe big lessons that that I learned is\nthe way that sometimes uh we talk to\nourselves the words that we use whether\nthey're out loud or even just spoken in\nsilence to ourselves are are huge are\nhuge so if you tell yourself you know\nlike I hate my body like I want to\nchange this like I hate I don't know\nlike my stomach like that's not coming\nfrom a place of love you're less likely\nto achieve results if they're if that's\ncoming from a place of negative\nsentiments towards yourself I always\nthat's another thing that I always try\nto impart on whoever I'm working with\nespecially in person is like I want us\nto from a place place of love for\nourselves not from I need to lose 20 lbs\nbecause that again comes from like I\nhate this 20 lbs that's on me um but\nyeah starting from a place of love for\nwherever we're at and for I want to I\nwant to do this because I want to become\na healthier version of\nmyself fantastic Sonata has been so\ninformative talking to you today I feel\nlike there's been so many great insights\nthat we can I think I'm going to be\npulling on a lot of your insights to\ngain drive and gain Focus to connect\nback in with my body because a lot of\nwhat you've shared with me has made me\nrealize just how important strength\ntraining is especially in my 30s where I\nam now and and how important it's going\nto be long term even if I don't feel it\nright now so thank you so much uh we end\nevery episode with a final five these\nhave to be answered in one word or one\nsentence maximum and so Sonata grea\nthese are your final five the first is\nwhat is the best health or Fitness\nadvice you've ever heard or received\nwell the advice not necess well it it's\nthe best advice ever was to stay true to\nmyself and to my uniqueness so I don't\nthink it necessarily has to deal with\nthe fitness part but it's to to embrace\nyour unique self and stay true to it um\nthe advice that I would give when it\ncomes to to Fitness though um would be\nto just start just start second question\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever had\nor\nreceived stop lifting\nweights he'll get you to be masculine\nand\nbulky and that's not the case yeah yeah\nat the end of the day it's\nalso let's not judge people for how they\nwant to look you know if they want to\nappear a certain way if that's what\ndrives them that's what they they want\nlet's allow question number three what's\nyour hope for people in 2024 uh just to\ndo everything from a place of Love\nwhatever that is so whether it's working\nout nutrition or um anything in their\nlife just start from a place of love for\nthemselves and for everybody around them\nquestion number four what's the first\nthing you do in the morning and the last\nthing you do at night first thing I\nmeditate last thing I say my gratitudes\nbeautiful and Fifth and final question\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be I would say because this was\none of my biggest lesson was to allow I\ndon't know if it makes sense but one of\nthe biggest lessons for me recently was\nto allow and stop being so\nmuch uh needing to to control everything\num so maybe this is more on a personal\nlevel\nbut I think if we allow for the good in\nour life for the love for the right type\nof\ncircumstances um I think there's so much\nto gain from that it's beautiful Sonata\nthank you so much thank you for being\nhere everyone who's been listening or\nwatching sonata's app is the We rise app\nuh where
