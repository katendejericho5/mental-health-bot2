    "transcript": "if you can be triggered it means you're\nwalking around with a loaded gun 70% of\nthe emotional stress that we feel on a\ndaily basis comes from our body being\nmalnourished Dave aspey New York Times\nbestselling author he's the founder and\nCEO of Bulletproof Coffee we've all been\nshamed for being lazy talking about\nlaziness the only thing worse is talking\nabout death we are living in a world\ntoday where you can measure as 20 years\nyounger than your calendar age you don't\nhave to get old before we jump into this\nepisode I'd like to invite you to join\nthis community to hear more interviews\nthat will help you become happier\nhealthier and more healed all I want you\nto do is click on the Subscribe button I\nlove your support it's incredible to see\nall your comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett hey everyone welcome welcome back\nto on purpose the number one Health\npodcast in the world thanks to each and\nevery one of you that come back every\nweek to listen learn and grow now you\nknow that I'm curious about biohacking\nabout becoming better about improving my\nenergy my focus my strength and there's\na guest that we've had on twice before\nwho I'm so excited to have back on\nbecause he is the father of biohacking\nsomeone who has brought this movement to\nthe four helped create so many products\ninsights books that have guided us\nthrough this I'm talking about the one\nand only Dave asprey entrepreneur\nfour-time New York Times best-selling\nauthor and host of the top 100 podcast\nthe human upgrade formerly bulletproof\nradio which is more than 200 million\ndownloads Dave is the co-founder of\nBulletproof coffee and a leading voice\nin the movement to take control of our\nown biology and what I love about what\nDave does is he makes what could cost a\nlot of money extremely accessible\nrelevant and practical and he's doing\nthat in this new book called smarter not\nharder the biohacker guide to getting\nthe body and mind you want go and grab a\ncopy of this right now we're going to\nput a link in the caption so you can\norder it while you're listening to us uh\nwelcome back to the show Dave asy Dave\nthird time Jay it's always such a\npleasure to get time in person with you\nI know me too I I really love seeing you\nand I said it to you today I I see you\nlike you know whenever we're connecting\nmaybe it's at a conference or obviously\non the podcast you look better and\nyounger and fitter and healthier every\ntime over the last few years and I think\nthat's Testament to everything you say\nworking and everything you're saying\nyou're practicing it and honestly I saw\nyou today and I was just like who's this\nbig bright light in my house like you\nknow it's it's really special to\nobviously practice what you preach but\nto actually see the benefits you must\nfeel great too I mean I I feel amazing I\nI wrote a big book on longevity that I\npublished a few years ago and I went\nreally deep for 20 years I've been\nrunning a nonprofit and just working in\nthat field but I went really deep and I\nstarted doing the stuff more\naggressively and I am now let's see 11\nyears younger than my calendar age and\nlast week I just got some gene therapy\nthat'll take another N9 years off my\nmeasured age so I should test to be\nabout 30 years old even though the\ncalendar believes something different\nwhat is that measuring so I've heard\npeople talk about measuring the age\nbefore how is that calculating obviously\nwe know how your calendar age marks but\nhow are they calculating a biological\nage like what does that look like what\nare the processes you a little bit of\nblood and then they look at something\ncalled DNA methylation about 800,000\ndifferent data points and you can say\nwell normal people have this much\nmethylation in this pattern but people\nwho are younger look this way so if you\ntake two people's blood you should be\nable to tell their age but if they take\nmy blood they get a much younger age so\nthis is now the gold standard for\nmeasuring how old you are there's other\nmore affordable tests like viome has an\nage that's based on a lot of things that\nare happening in your gut bacteria and\nin your body body and then there's\noldfashioned blood teir tests that don't\nwork very well so yeah don't trust those\nones you may feel like you're 10 years\nolder but but that's that's not accurate\nwell I want to dive into this new book\nthere are so many chapters that really\nstood out to me as we were going and I\npicked out some lines here that really\nkind of hit me this one I thought was\nhuge and I love how you start the book\non laziness and you talk about tapping\ninto the power of laziness and I was\njust thinking this is so true because\nwhenever anyone's trying to shift their\nhealth whether it's biohacking whether\nit's mental Health whatever it may be\nlaziness seems to be like this big\nelephant in the room right it's like\nthat thing that slows you down it makes\nyou lack it feels like it's negative but\nyou say you're not lazy your body is and\nyou talk about tapping into the power of\nlaziness tell me how you do that and\nwhat does that mean because I think a\nlot of you're going to make a lot of\npeople happy today I will but even\ntalking about laziness it the only thing\nworse is talking about death I mean\npeople they don't want to do it so when\nI would you do an Instagram post about\nlaziness people would just not watch it\nbecause like I don't want to face that\nand we've all been shamed for being lazy\nthere's that coach like don't be so lazy\nrun around the field again and the\nteacher you know you're not performing\nor your parents so we have all this\nshame about it the reality though is\nthat your body has an operating system I\ncall the meat operating system and a lot\nof spiritual work is actually accessing\nthat and it has a very strong desire to\nnot waste energy and that is a s\nthing right imagine if we had two people\nand one of them says working hard gets\nresults and I said all right guys go dig\na ditch and woodam says I got my shovel\nand the other one says I got a tractor\nokay the guy with the tractor was done\nin 20 minutes and the other guy works\nfor three days and we somehow believe\nwithout thinking The Virtuous guy is the\nguy with a shovel because he worked hard\nand we're unconsciously believing that\nworking hard gets results so we shame\nourselves when we don't don't work hard\nand sadly when we work hard and we don't\nget results we start feeling like\nvictims which is really toxic we all\nknow people work really hard and don't\nget results maybe it's because we have a\nbelief system in there that doesn't work\nand when we say well couldn't I do this\nin an easier way we start feeling shame\nnow it's not okay to do it the easy way\nbecause the virtue comes from the\nstruggle but in the world that we live\nin The Virtue comes from getting it done\nand understanding that you will always\nalways have a desire to be lazy and\nthink about it you wake up and you say\nall right I could go to the gym or\nthere's a couch and there's donuts and\nNetflix the couch is always going to\nlook sexier and there we start well I\nshould want the gym no you shouldn't\nyour body really does want the extra\nenergy from the donuts and not using any\nenergy in case there's a famine so\nembracing that your motivation from your\nbody is to save energy and there's\nnothing wrong with that so then how do\nyou use that to motivate yourself that's\nhow to hack laziness well if you go to\nthe gym let's say you're going to do\ncardio go to span class if you did an\nhour a day five days a week that's\naggressive you're going to improve after\ntwo months you're 2% Improvement in your\nFitness if you do the lazy way the thing\nI write about and smarter not harder\nyou're going to spend 15 minutes a week\nyou will not sweat that's the amount of\ntime you spend brushing your teeth by\nthe way you'll improve by 12% six times\nmore so you wake up and you say today\nI'm going to save 50 minutes of not\nworking at the gym because I'm going to\ndo it better and all of a sudden it's\nreally motivating because the body says\nI get to save energy at the gym and then\nthe body aligns its motivation with what\nyour mind wants and then the resistance\nFades and it's a really important thing\nit's something that I've never seen\nwritten about anywhere so use the\nsavings of time the savings of energy to\nmotivate yourself but you know who does\nknow about this big food companies they\nwill send you\na 25 cent coupon and oh look I saved 25\ncents because to our body saving money\nfeels like a lot more than it really is\nright so it's about unconscious view of\nreality so since we know our body does\nthat without our knowledge or permission\nlet's just use it to our advantage\ninstead of against us yeah absolutely so\nusing a 15minute workout per day no no\nno no no no you're seeing a 15-minute\nworkup five minutes three times a week\nfive minutes three times a week how is\nthat having a 12% change well maybe\nworking hard doesn't get results when it\ncomes to exercise and I want to be\nreally clear the ability to work hard is\nnecessary for you to get things done in\nthe world but working hard without the\nright tools is a Fool's errand yes and\none of my companies it's a franchise\nwere about to be over about 30 locations\nsigned so we're opening across the\ncountry it's called upgrade Labs you can\ngo to own and upgrad labs.com and open\none in your neighborhood and\nwe have the technology to do this it\nuses artificial intelligence and it\ncauses you to move slower than you want\nand then way harder than you really\nreally want to but only for 20 seconds\nand then here's the trick as soon as\nyou're done you take some really deep\nbreaths and it guides you with the AI to\nsay breathe deeper and it brings your\nheart rate down so what your body really\nresponds to is really strong stimulation\nlike a tiger was going to catch you and\nthen a feeling of safety and calm when\nyou have enough minerals you have enough\nnutrients say oh I guess I should\nimprove my performance but if you go to\nthe spin class okay the tiger chased you\non the first Sprint and then you keep\nrunning and then you sprint again and\nyou keep running and the body believes\nI'm being hunted and it doesn't get away\nand if you're combining that with a low\ncalorie diet oh there's a famine and I'm\ncontinuously hunted for an hour a day no\nwonder it's not going to improve it\ndoesn't have any energy to improve it's\njust stressed so the precise dose of\nexercise it matters so much and the\nLiber\nthing you're going to hate me for saying\nthis so you notice I'm in better shape\nthan before 20 minutes a week as my\nentire workout regimen and I'm like I'm\ndoing all right right you're stacked\nyeah that's Epic Man and you you said it\nbeautifully on page 21 you said your\nbody does not care how much time you do\nsomething hard it cares about how\nquickly you do something hard how hard\nit is and how quickly it returns to\nBaseline there you go page 21 that is\nthat is and that resonated with me a lot\nbecause and we'll talk about this later\non I don't want to get into it now but\nyou talk about this in the book as well\nwhy the infrared SAA and why Cold\nplunges kind of ex that that explains\nexactly that process especially if\nyou're doing both back and forth and you\nthink they're getting in the cold for\nyou're like oh I'd have to sit in there\nfor a long time but it's actually how\nlong is it uncomfortable for right that\nwhere it's actually working because\nyou're saying once it becomes normalized\nonce anything becomes comes normalized\nwhether it's spin class whether it's\nsitting in the cold or whatever it may\nbe it's now not having that effect it\ndoesn't work in fact if you got in a in\na normal warm bathtub and slowly cooled\nthe water you would have no benefits\nfrom doing that and instead it's that\nyou got in and it was a rapid drop in\ntemperature and then you got out and the\nbody warmed itself up again and it's\nteaching the body that it is safe to\nwarm itself up and then it becomes\nbetter at creating heat if your body's\nbetter at creating heat it means your\nmetabolism works better and so we've\nunpacked all of this using machine\nlearning and artificial intelligence and\ntoday most people they buy gy\nmemberships and they don't go there's\n$400 million a year of ghost memberships\nwhere people pay and never show up\nbecause well if I have the membership I\nmight show up but the lazy impulse of\nthe body wins because the gym doesn't\nhave a good return on investment of your\ntime wow and I'm not saying you\nshouldn't work out no I know and if you\ngo to the gym awesome I enjoy that as\nwell but I'd frankly rather go to a yoga\nclass in my spare time and then you can\nget the muscles in about three to five\ntimes less time than going to the gym\nyou get the cardio in I don't know 15\nminutes versus 5 hours a week I don't\nknow the ratio there but it's crazy and\nit's much better cardio anyway and so\nall of a sudden you're saying wait I got\nmy strength I got my cardio and that was\nwhat led me to create upgrade Labs\nbecause people want to come in and do\nthis and what do you do with the extra\ntime well how about we train your brain\nwith neuro feedback how about we train\nyour stress response so you can be more\nresilient when things are weird at work\nor at home or things like that or how\nabout we just make it so your body\nrecovers better than it ever did and\nwhat we're dealing with now is a world\nfull of stress and never any recovery\ntime so let's use technology to handle\nthe easy stuff like muscles and cardio\nand then let's take the extra safe time\nto make our brains better and to make\nour stress handling better absolutely\nhas changed my life have you got one in\nLA upgr left there's one at the Beverly\nHilton although that hotel is about to\nget renovated and there's one in Santa\nMonica underneath Arnold schwarzer's\noffice I want to go oh absolutely you're\ngo yeah I need to come in I didn't yeah\nthis is I didn't realize that's awesome\nyeah in fact the first one opened eight\nyears ago in Santa Monica I've been\nworking on this for a long time before\nwe decided to let anyone open a business\nright at upgrade labs and part of this\nis It's a global movement now biohacking\nit it's a thing you go to Latin America\nyou go to Japan it doesn't matter\nthere's biohacking all over the world\nand it's expensive to build a million\ndooll lab like I did at my house with\nall this Advanced Tech so what if we\njust made it available for everyone\nthat's awesome I can't wait to check it\nout yeah all right let's dive back in\nthere's a couple of things that you talk\nabout so we talked about laziness one of\nthe things that you talk about in the\nbook is removing friction so you have\nthese six steps to energy success and\nI'll let people get the book to dive\ninto all of them I don't want to go\nthrough everything but you talk about\nremoving friction and I think when you\nwhen you dive into that I was like\nthat's the right word like it's friction\nthat we experience what are some of the\nsteps or some of the highlights that you\nsee of like removing friction what does\nthat look like when you think about\nsomething that you want to do often\ntimes it's the little things that feel\nreally big because your body is creating\nresistance it's like don't waste energy\nthere might be a famine don't waste\nenergy so if you can't find your gym\nshoes right because you you're not\norganized right and there's a lot of\nthings that we do that make it so that\nthere's many steps and each step is a\ndecision so you remove decisions to make\nit really easy and a big source of\nfriction is you wanted to do it you went\nto the gym and you didn't get results\none of the things that's holding you\nback is that either you're exposing\nyourself to toxins that lower your\ntestosterone things like extra plastic\nBPA um or you're just lacking minerals\nand right now we have an epidemic of\npeople who just don't have enough\nminerals our food used to be full of\nminerals because our soil was full of\nminerals we've been kind of strip\nfarming the land so even if you're\neating plants that are supposed to be\nhigh in iron they're probably not\nbecause the soil doesn't have iron\nanymore and when you get enough minerals\nin the body then the you send a signal\nthrough your exercise that says hey\nimprove the body says well I wanted to\nimprove but I have this big sticking\npoint I don't have enough zinc and\ncopper I can't improve so then you just\nfeel stress so one of the things that's\nreally helped me lean out is I focus\nvery heavily on my mineral intake\nthey're the least sexy supplements on\nEarth and to make minerals go where\nthey're supposed to go we need something\ncalled vitamin D and you can go to\nvitamind D ak.com and it's there it's\nabout 20 bucks a month for what it takes\nto do this it's a combination of vitamin\nD vitamin A vitamin K and a special form\nof vitamin E and those things when you\ntake those in combination with a\nbroadspectrum mineral supplement on the\nsame site your body suddenly has the\npower to build bones and to build muscle\nand make energy and your focus can\nimprove Pro and then I put the trace\nminerals that are just broadly lacking\nfor all of us in my new coffee brand\ncalled danger coffee so the idea is it's\neasy you're doing coffee every day\nprobably anyway and you end up going wow\nsomething different it feels different\nin this and it's called danger coffee by\nthe way you're going to like this\nbecause who knows what you might do you\nknow you might finally ask that girl out\nyou might start a company you might\nstart a podcast the idea is love that\nyou can handle it now because you got\nthe energy and mineral are the key and\nwhy are the minerals you talked about\nthis like we always talk about\nsupplements talk about vitamins we don't\nhear about minerals as much and you make\nthat point in the book are those the\nfour minerals that you're saying the d a\nk and special form of E like those are\nthe those are vitamins they're the fat\nsoluble vitamins and each of those\ndirects minerals to go to the right\nplace in the body and in the minerals\nthere's macro minerals things like\nmagnesium and potassium and there's\ntrace minerals like zinc and copper and\nmanganese and then there's Ultra trace\nminerals that are present in Earth's\ncrust you need a little bit of those so\nthere's in the coffee there's 54\ndifferent kinds of minerals at super\ntiny traces and in the supplements you\ntake it's three pills to get enough\nminerals just enough minerals in your\nday that's why one a pill thing that has\nvitamins minerals there's not enough of\nanything in that and when you do that\nthose are the first two most important\nfoundational and affordable supplements\nthat you need to take before you do B\nvitamins and I've formulated neut\ntropics and advanced anti-aging\nlongevity things I love doing that and I\ntake those too but the last thing I\nwould ever stop taking would be vitamin\nDake and minerals 101 because they're\nfoundational to everything else your\nbody does whether it's meditating better\nwhether it's running faster whether it's\nthinking better or just staying calm in\na stressful situation without minerals\nyour body cannot do what it's trying to\ndo yeah no I can agree with you more\nI've I've definitely we've talked about\nthis before and I've definitely had\nperiods in my life where I was so low on\nminerals or vitamins of course which are\nthen impact the minerals where I'm like\nwait a minute I'm sleeping right I'm\nworking out I'm eating right like what\nis going on and so often I think we make\nit a mental challenge where we're like\noh maybe I'm dealing with something and\nactually what you realize is your body's\njust not dealing with stress well and\nnow it makes it feel like everything's\nmental when it's actually biological and\nchemical H you said it so my body is not\ndealing with stress right now I believe\nthat half and maybe 70% of the emotional\nstress that we feel on a daily basis it\ncomes from our body being malnourished\nyes I agree yeah and then it feels like\nexperienced that you have so me too and\nit feels like it's your mother-in-law or\nyour boss or like like it's someone\nelse's fault or maybe it's you and your\nmind is running in circles well when the\nbody feels like okay there's not a\nfamine I've got everything I need all of\na sudden things that felt like Everest\noh that's just a photo I could walk up\nthat no problem and to create a feeling\nof peace in your tissues and then do the\nhard work on the mental and spiritual\naspects of meditation it's a lot easier\nto work on those when your body's\nworking but if if you're constantly\nfeeling that what your body's telling\nyou because it's hungry is you and it's\na flaw or something to work on you can\nspend your entire life trying to deal\nwith your emotions not knowing that it's\nwhat's on your plate that's causing them\nyes yes yes yes I want to fully double\nemphasize that that is so true and so\nreal and I think so many of us are\nclimbing up a steep hill trying to solve\nthe wrong problem first and this way\nround is going to make all of it much\neasier I think you're spot on no I'm so\nglad so glad that we addressed that I\nwanted to dive into this part like I for\neveryone who's listening and watching\nthe book goes into depth into exactly\nthe minerals exactly the vitamins you\nneed like I want you to know that the\nbook's giving you a breakdown and so\nmake sure you grab the book so that you\nactually get all that insights I just\nwant to give you the breadth of the\nInsight that Dave has so that you're\nlike oh wait a minute I need to work on\nthat I need to work on that uh something\nyou talk a lot about is picking a Target\narea and tracking it and you talk about\nthese core target areas you talk about\nstrength cardiovascular fitness energy\nmetabolism brain function and stress\nresistance and I found that that's\nprobably our biggest mistake when it\ncomes to our health is we either are\nmeasuring nothing or we're trying to\nmeasure everything you nailed it right\nwhere should one start like how does one\nI guess intuitively or datawise know\nwhat they are missing right now because\nI feel like most of us don't know most\nus live quite\nunconsciously and we may be feeling a\nbit tired we may be feeling a bit of\nbody pain but we're not really that\naware of what the challenges and what we\nneed I have a lot of data on this\nbecause we ask people this when they\ncome in to upgrade labs and that was one\nof the things that inspired me to\nstructure the book this way and it's\nkind of funny the only people on Earth\nwho are going to say when they wake up\nin the morning the first thing they want\nI want to be healthy today there are\npeople who are like me when I weighed\n300 lb I had chronic fatigue syndrome\nand arthritis\nand massive brain fog and I was a wreck\nso being healthy was a top priority for\nme and you might get there when you're\n75 right as well I just wish I was\nhealthy but when we're reasonably\nhealthy health is number 17 on the\nhoneydew list I I want it and what's\nreally motivating us oftentimes from our\nbody is we want to be powerful we want\nto be energetic uh we want love in our\nlife and those things they Trump health\nso Health never gets enough priority and\nwhat does Health even mean most people\ncan't tell you so I broke it down into\nthose five or six categories and okay\nwhat are you going to work on First and\nevery person is individual so where are\nyou today and then what's your first\ngoal and everyone says well I want all\nthose but pick one and in fact I\nencourage you in the book to pick two\nand really think about it and when\npeople come and actually use a a\nconjoint analysis survey and like we we\ngo through data to help you figure out\nyour goals but in the book I teach you\nhow to do it so if your first goal is\nyou know what I notice that I'm I'm weak\nI I I can't hold on to things long my\ngrip strength is gone I don't have the\nmuscles I want okay so you're going to\nfocus on muscle first or like a lot of\npeople I'm stressed all the time and my\nbrain doesn't work I'm going to focus on\nmy brain first so then you go to the\nsection of the book on brain and I list\nall the Technologies and techniques\nwhether they're free or cost a couple\nhundred bucks or cost thousands of\ndollars that work really well to bring\nyour brain back online and when you do\nthat that your muscles will work a\nlittle bit better as a side effect right\nso maybe that was it first I want my\nbrain then I want my muscles but someone\nelse could be totally different in their\ndesires I want to be able to run a\nmarathon I just need the endurance to\nwalk up the stairs because I can't take\ncare of my kids stuff like that happens\nall the time so you you go through the\nbook and say okay this is my goal and\nthen there's a variety of technologies\nthat will support that and some of them\nI say Technologies they're just\ntechniques and if it's muscles picking\nup rocks is the entire history of\nbuilding muscles for humans we\nconcentrate the Rocks into kettle bells\nnow but there's still rocks and then for\nendurance it's run away from Tigers like\nyou could run away from a slow tiger or\na fast tiger and that's all of exercise\nwell with machine learning and AI we are\ndoubling the amount of knowledge of\nbiology that we have every 73 days\nthere's so much magic happening right\nnow that you can use this new knowledge\nthat your doctor is probably never going\nto know and you can use that to say oh I\ncan do this in a lot less time so then\nyou get your muscles back and your brain\nworks better or you get your brain back\nand then you have the energy to do the\nmuscle work or to do the endurance work\nand then you say I'm going to work on\nthese stress management techniques and\nyou have so much wisdom that you've\noffered people on on dealing with stress\nand the meditation side of things and\nthere's a couple chapters towards the\nend of the book where I talk about you\nknow spiritual hacking which on its face\nis a bit offensive I admit it but in way\nno I knew it came from a good place it\ndid and the idea here is is what would\nhave happened in Tibet or in India or\nNepal or place like that is okay we have\na\ncave and you can go to the cave and 20\nyears later you're going to be\nenlightened and you could call that fast\npath but most of us have other things\nthat we want to do so how do we get the\nmaximum amount of meditation benefit per\nminute like hurry meditate faster it's\nan oxymoron except\nif you can say well I'm going to do\nbreath work with my meditation and\nstudies show that your brain gets into\nthese states more quickly then maybe you\nshould consider finding the kind of\nbreath work that works for your body\nbecause for every 10 minutes of work you\ndo you might get into the state faster\nand for some people well that's not okay\nthe Dal Lama years ago offered a\n$100,000 reward to neuroscientists who\ncould help him get into a special\nesoteric State he says it takes me 4\nhours of Med meditation to get there and\nI don't have 4 hours if you can get me\nthere in an hour I'll pay you $100,000\nokay this is possible today I I run a\nneuroscience Clinic called 40 Years of\nZen and in 5 days people have the brain\nwaves of someone who spent 20 years in\nthe cave and I've spent 6 months of my\nlife with the electrodes glued to my\nhead meditating every day with a\ncomputer teaching me how to not do it\nwrong and for me that was faster but I\nalso did 5 years of Art of Living um\nbreath work every single morning cuz I\nfound it work better than just sitting\nand meditating which I also did every\nmorning and I want people to understand\nany of those approaches is better than\nnot doing it and you've got to find the\none that works for you and there's a\nlist of of exercises in here including\nthe reset process which is one of the\nmost important things I teach can you\nwalk us through that the reset process\nis something that um I pioneered with\nthe Neuroscience practice because you\ncan measure when it works and what you\ndo and the whole recipes is in the book\nfor it but what you're doing is you're\nfinding something that is a trigger for\nyou and I want to be really\nstraightforward if you can be triggered\nit means you're walking around with a\nloaded gun you need to unload the gun\nit's not everyone else's job to not make\nyou shoot them it's your job to say I'm\nnot carrying a weapon anymore and so you\nfind something that triggers you and you\nsit and you think about that feeling and\nit's usually something will pop into\nyour head you were bullied uh something\na parent said someone cut you off in\ntraffic it doesn't really matter\nsomething's going to pop in your head\nyou say okay I'm going to run the reset\nprocess on that so you sit the person\nwho made you angry down across from you\nin your mind's eye visually yeah\nvisually in you're also in your mind's\neye you imagine some sort of uh\ninfallible deity some people use God or\nJesus or Buddha or you know any of the\ndeities that you like or it could just\nbe you know a a light bulb that's always\nright it it it doesn't matter but this\nis your your double checking thing and\nthen you sit there and you actually say\nyou did this\nand it made me feel this way and then\nyou tap into how bad you felt and you\nactually turn on the bad feeling like\nwhat you want me to actually yes I want\nyou to feel it and then once you're sure\nthat you've really felt the bad feeling\nyou might have tears in your eyes I mean\nit might have been a big thing then and\nthis is the key that's missing from a\nlot even of older literature before you\nwork on letting it go you have to find\ngratitude so you find one thing it\ndoesn't matter how big of a gratitude is\nyou just need a spark of gratitude and\nsay oh here's one good thing that\nhappened and all of a sudden that flips\na switch in your brain and then you can\nstep into the F-word called\nforgiveness\nand\nforgiveness depends everyone's mind went\nyeah I like yeah and the reason I call\nthe f- word is lot of I'm not going to\nforgive that person they wronged me you\ndon't have to tell them you forgive them\nthis is just you unloading the weapon\nthis is you no longer being triggered\nright and then you look at it from the\nother person's point of view and you\nrealize maybe their mom was mean to them\nyou know maybe they didn't know maybe\nthe guy who cut you off in traffic was\non the way to the hospital to see his\ndaughter being born you just don't know\nright and you start looking at that and\nall of a sudden because you did\ngratitude first you feel your heart open\nand you go oh my gosh and when you're\ndone and sometimes it takes Neuroscience\nor a facilitator or some coaching but\nwhen you're done you can look at someone\nwho wronged you greatly and and all you\nfeel is peace and love and you can no\nlonger be triggered this is very\nimportant because what we normally learn\nto do is to say well I know that every\ntime this situation comes up I'm going\nto feel triggered I'm going to notice\nthat I'm triggered and then I'm going to\ntake a deep breath and I'm going to\nchoose to behave like an adult\nHallelujah for doing that we all need to\ndo more of that it's just biologically\nexpensive because it takes a lot of\neffort and time and focus what if there\nwas no trigger so the reset process lets\nyou turn this off at a very deep and\nprofound level and when you're done you\ncan look at your greatest enemy and you\ncan say I love you I forgive you we are\none and you are done for the rest of\nyour life with that trauma and I have\ndone this on every single trauma that's\never happened I've I had a very\nsuccessful conscious uncoupling in the\nlast two years I had an employee inem\nbezel money I've had people try to ruin\nmy reputation all of it R the reset\nprocess on it and I'm absolutely at\npeace with it and to be able to get\nthere running I mean you run at a very\nbig level so do I and the amount of\nstuff that comes at us no one's ever\ngoing to know it is an enormous thing\nwhen you're leading millions of people\nand making the world a better place and\nto be able to do that without the\nconstant stress and the constant tension\nand the constant questioning in your\nmind that all comes from unresolved\nforgiveness so the reset process in the\nbook is how do you get there most\nquickly and you may say I don't want to\ndo that that sounds awful do some EMDR\nthat's another way to get to a similar\nstate but this process is so powerful\nand it leads you to amazing spiritual\nstates where you no longer are carrying\na grudge because I mean smarter not\nharder the power of laziness how\nexpensive is it for you spiritually at a\nsoul level to carry a grudge against\nsomeone who wronged you for the rest of\nyour life it life is too precious to\nwaste it that way and this is the\nfastest way I've found for people to\nlearn how to let go of something and I\nput it in a book you say well I thought\nthat was about exercise or biohacking\nlook the the biggest thing you can do\nand the hardest thing you can do is to\nlet go of something that your body is\nholding on to because it thinks it's\nkeeping you safe and I thought I was\njust worthy of including in the book\nthat's what I mean by spiritual hacking\nfind the technique that lets you fully\nlet go of something so that you can be\npresent with your family with your\nfriends with your loved one and then you\ncan be present for your mission or maybe\nyou can find your mission and your\npurpose yeah I think I I think it's so\nwell said I'm I'm so glad you included\nit because I think for the sake of\nSimplicity we talk about our body our\nmind our soul or Spirit or whatever we\ncall it but the truth is that it's so\ninterconnected in that as you're saying\nif you can't let go of an emotional\ndisconnect or a misalignment chances are\nthat's going to lead to your eating\nhabits and then that eating habit is\ngoing to link back to a lack of that\nspiritual cleansing or detoxing or\nwhatever that may be so we're kind of\njust stuck in this vicious cycle and I I\nwanted to talk to you about that because\nusing that spiritual hacking the other\nway and going what are some of the\nblocks that are created physically\nbecause of the lack of Letting Go what\nare some of the habits that you've seen\ndevelop physically in our diet in our\nyou know in our physical practices\nbecause of a lack of that I believe that\nevery cell in your body has its own\nsmall Consciousness and even inside the\ncells the mitochondria each of them is\nan ancient bacteria and ancient bacteria\nhave a Consciousness it's a pretty slow\nDumb Consciousness actually it's a very\nfast Consciousness but it's it doesn't\nhave much awareness but when you have\nbillions actually for those things\nalmost trillions inside the body they\nfunction as a distributed Consciousness\nfor your meat for your your hardware and\nthey're just trying to keep the petri\ndish alive and they think you're a petri\ndish and you realize that they're\nstoring traumas and when you do this\nreally deep forgiveness work you're\ncausing the body to relax and you're\ncausing the body to feel safe at a\ncellular level and when a cell feels\nsafe it will expand and grow and Thrive\nand it'll maintain itself and when a\ncell feels like the environment around\nit is hostile whether it's because of\nself-hate or whether it's because of a\nlack of nutrients or because you're ere\nexercising or undere exercising then\nthey don't feel safe and then they don't\ndo their job right so when your body is\nin that place your energy field gets\nbigger and stronger and we can even\nmeasure that at the Neuroscience Clinic\nwe measure brain voltage and people will\nincrease their brain voltage and when\nthat happens suddenly that injury that\nyou've had that won't heal it heals the\ncancer that you have can shrink just\nfrom doing meditation right because if\nthere's conscious or unconscious\nloathing around a part of your body like\noh you don't like your love handles\nright they're probably not going to go\naway in fact they'll probably get bigger\nright because they don't feel safe so\nthis deep loving of your body of your\ntissues and um I was working with a\nteenager recently and she said you know\nsome of my friends don't like their\nbodies uh and very common occurrence\nyeah and they think they're fat or they\nthink they're thin or they don't like\ntheir nose or whatever and she said I\nthought about it uh a lot and I realized\nI really like my body because it can do\nall these amazing things I was like that\nis the most enlightened cool thing I've\never heard from a teenager right because\nif you have that selflove for your\ntissues even if they're not working\nright and I say this as a guy who was\n300 lbs with like arthritis and a knee\nthat I couldn't trust because it would\njust like it would just fold in the\nmiddle of walking and I would fall over\nlike I was such a wreck and to be able\nto go through and and forgive yourself\nthat's actually the hardest forgiveness\nand you can run the reset process on a\npart of your body that you have an issue\nwith you can run the reset process on\nyour entire body and the feelings of not\nbeing enough not being good enough all\nof those things you can just let go of\nso you're just at peace and things are\nas they are and you don't have to have\nan emotional reaction to everything and\nthat allows you to have so much more\nenergy for your spirit when that\nspiritual lacking is draining all your\nenergy you don't have the energy to pick\nthe right foods and to do the workout\nand to put into your creative processes\nor creative Endeavors that you have\ngoing on and and I want to dive into a\ncouple of things which I thought really\nI'm glad you talked about this in the\nbook because I think the challenges as\nwe know with health and wellness there's\nalways a new fad a new trend a new kind\nof thing that comes up and Everyone Gets\nbehind it and then afterwards a few\nyears later we realized that there was\nmore research to it I think one of those\nbig areas is around let's there's two\nareas in the book that you'd cover\nreally well that I want to dive into one\nis around where we get our protein we\nknow protein is important I mean remind\nhow much protein we need to get every\nday like good protein because you need\nbetween 0.8 and 1 gram of protein per\npound of body weight so I weigh 200 lb\nand I'm about 7% body fat and I that\nmeans I need about 200 gram of protein a\nday 7% body fat yeah it's ridiculous as\na guy who is the fat computer hacker\nfrom the first Jurassic Park it's\ntotally ridiculous and in order to do\nthat if if you're obese like I was you\nmight say well if I weigh 300 lb I had\n100 lb of fat you really only need two\n200 g of protein you can subtract the\nextra fat from the number but 200 g of\nprotein it's a lot and protein isn't all\nthe same and this is something that\nthat's what yeah yeah that the big food\ncompanies are trying to tell us Cricut\nprotein or gluten is protein there's a\ncompany making keto cookies that are all\nprotein they're just gluten and canola\noil that is not food so a while ago the\nstory was oh all calories are the same\nso you can drink this you know high\nfructose corn Sy it's just calories as\nlong as you keep your calories low you\ncan drink a diet Coke and a Snickers bar\nthey cancel each other's out it doesn't\nwork like that proteins the same way so\ndifferent proteins send different\nsignals to the body and there's\nsomething called amino acid availability\nscore and it turns out that animal\nproteins score much higher than\nplant-based proteins and I say this as a\nformer vegan a former raw vegan and you\njust cannot get enough protein from\nPlants unless you're doing heavy\nindustrial processing of the plants and\nthat comes at a cost but even then the\nhighest quality plant-based protein\npowders don't hold a candle to Dairy\nprotein which is vegetarian or egg\nprotein which is a vegetarian or sort of\nthe king of proteins is beef or Buffalo\nor bison as a vegan I had a problem with\nthis because while I was a vegan I was\nin Tibet at a a monastery and Tibetan\nMonks love to argue and they're trained\nsince they're about 8 years old they\nhave an 8-year-old sitting on the ground\nsurrounded by older kids standing up all\narguing at the same time doing these\nlike aggressive things and it's to teach\nyou to be calm in the face of argument\nso that you can still be at peace and\nit's beautiful to watch so I knew this\nand so I'm kind of teasing the head\nllama I said well you tell me no killing\nbut you have a yak skin on your prayer\npole uh so I think you're a hypocrite\nand he starts laughing and he looks at\nme he goes one death feeds everyone I'm\nlike mind blown cuz I had been a vegan\nuntil I went to Tibet and I realized I\ncannot be a vegan in bet because there's\njust very little food and if there's you\nknow some Yak butter tea or there's you\nknow a little bit of meat you just eat\nit cuz there's just not enough food so I\nreally thought about it and that led me\nto think about deaths per calorie and as\na guy has built a regenerative Farm on\nVancouver Island and raised all of my\nown animals for most of the last eight\nyears I will tell you that a cow will\nfeed you for an entire year and if it's\ngrass-fed and from a local farmer no\nother animal died unless the cow stepped\non a frog I mean it is literally one\ndeath and if the cow is treated with\nrespect and ethically then you are\nkilling fewer animals than an industrial\nplant protein because when they do those\nthe tractor comes through and it chops\nup every creature that's there including\nthe bunnies and the mice and the\nbutterflies and all the ugly ones like\nworms that no one likes that are\nimportant for life so I feel really\nclean about it but the most important\nthing that I can say if you choose to\neat animal protein which I do is that\npractice gratitude before you eat um I\nbelieve because of my shamanic training\nbecause of all the spiritual work that I\ndo that humans our energetic field as a\nspecies made a sacred agreement with the\nanimals that we've domesticated and they\ncome here to nourish Us in exchange for\nour gratitude so if you are going to eat\nmeat you practice gratitude because\nthat's the deal we made and if you\ndisrespect the animal and you're eating\nindustrial meat and you're eating it\nwith mindlessly I don't think that's a\ngood practice but I do think it's\nethical to eat meat because I'm killing\nfewer lives when I eat beef than when I\neat plant-based protein and since that\nnourishes me better which gives me\nstronger energy and stronger bones and\nit gives me more energy to put back into\nthe world including building better soil\nvia farming of animals I feel like it's\na good deal and it's within Integrity\nfor me but even in some animal protein\nyou are recommending and we'll talk\nabout the plant proteins as well but\nsome of the animal proteins you were\nsaying are not as strong and reliable I\nbelieve you mentioned chicken turkey I\nthink there were a couple of others in\nthe book that I saw birds are not that\nthey're dinosaurs so they're less like\nus and the fat that's present in Birds\nis similar to soybean oil it's a lot of\nOmega 6 that causes inflammation and you\nwould know this if you're in India and\nyou're not feeling well your\ngrandmother's going to give you white\nrice and ghee which is clarified butter\nin the US you get Saltines and margarine\nor something and doesn't work very well\nbut the reason is that ghee that\nsaturated fat is very nourishing for you\nand that you actually need that you\ndon't get it from a chicken and also one\nchicken to get the amount of protein I'd\neat a chicken a day I'm killing 365\nchickens a year that doesn't feel very\ngood in addition to that real chickens\nthe kind that I grow on my farm take\nnine months to mature and their fat is\nRich and yellow and full of vitamins\neven though it's not the best kind of\nfat but the chickens they eating at the\nstore takes 6 weeks to get that big\nbecause they're they've been modified in\nbreed to have these incredibly large\nbreasts and they're terribly mistreated\nso unless a chicken is pasture raised\nand Heritage breed which point it's not\naffordable they're terribly expensive to\nraise chickens exist to make eggs eggs\nif you're not allergic are really a good\nsource of fat and protein and when you\neat eggs you want to cook the whites and\nleave the yolk runny and then you get\nthe most nutrients that way and we\ntalked about the plant protein from uh\nethical standpoint but but even from a\nnutritional standpoint I mean I as so me\nand my wife are both plant-based but\nplant protein is like not a big part of\nour diets at all my wife's like not into\neating any of the burgers or any of the\nmeat so that's probably a good the fake\nmeat is not good yeah it's yeah explain\nwhy because I think that's slightly the\nchallenge for a lot of people who try\nand make that switch and I feel everyone\nwho turns to that then goes back because\nit's not satisfying are you a cl-based\nto the exclusion of of dairy yes I am\nWii we have been for years yeah and it's\nworking for you and by the way if you're\nfrom India you probably have the jeans\nthat are going to support that much\nbetter exactly uh and so if you look at\nwhat your great grandmother ate that's\ngoing to be an indication of what you\ncan handle and if you look at you your\nskin is really good and that's unusual\nwhen most people go vegan because they\neat a lot of industrial processed seed\noils so if you're eating a diet that\nagrees with your body and I totally\nsupport doing that um then what you want\nto do is you want to make sure that\nyou're getting complete amino acids and\nyou can do it from rice and beans but\nhere's the issue to get enough protein\nit's definitely hard I'm I'm fully like\nI'm thinking about it a lot it's like\n300 grams of carbs to get 20 grams of\nprotein it's hard so then your best bet\nfor plant-based proteins have the\nhighest amino acid score it's actually\nhemp protein with the fat removed\nbecause hemp oil isn't particularly good\nfor you so then what you end up doing is\nsaying okay I'm going to do that and I\nfeel good I've also helped a lot of um a\nlot of vegans in fact this is at David\nWolf's vegan conference I explained the\nvirtues of ghee where no animals die to\nmake ghee and ghee helps to escort the\nnutrients from plants into the body so\nyou make better use of the plants so\nsometimes adding you know a tablespoon\nof ghee a day gives you like a healthier\nskin glow and it it feels more\nnourishing and people can choose to do\nthat or not choose to do that I and\npeople get mad because I tease vegans\ndude I was a vegan like it's guys it's\nit's not it's not a disrespectful thing\nit's a in my case it it actually harms\nme and some things like spinach kale\neven raspberries and almonds are very\nhigh in oxalic acid which I write about\nin the book and it causes crystals to\nform 70% of kidney stones are from\nplant-based compounds not from eating\nmeat and beer 30% are from meat and bear\nand so you can overdo either direction\nright so I want people to say choose the\nright plant\nwhen you're plant-based and I would\nconsider if I was plant-based adding\nhemp based protein powder even though it\nis a processed food it's going to be a\nprocessed food that has the best amino\nacid score that you can get absolutely\nthank you so much very useful for\neveryone who's listening and I wanted to\ndive into drinking the wrong kind of\nmilk because I think milk's been this\nyou know there's obviously there's been\nthe Almond milks and the oat milks and\nthen there's been debate on either side\nwalk us through milk because I think\nlike that's again I'd love to hear your\nside of it because again it's one of the\nI find all of this so confusing because\nyou hear something new come out Everyone\nGets behind it it works for people maybe\nit doesn't work stopping dairy milk from\nmy diet helped me with my gut but I also\ndon't drink a lot of uh oat milk or\nalmond milk that's not really that's not\nreally part of my diet I don't I don't\nhave cereal and stuff like that so I'm\nnot drinking that but then there's a lot\nof debate on that side of it as well\nthere is a lot of debate yeah dairy milk\nhas been a part of human food for at\nleast 5,000 years and it's a convenient\nway to not kill an animal and to have it\ncontinuously produce fat and protein\nwhich are the hard things for humans to\nget enough of because carbs are\nrelatively abundant in nature so what do\nyou do well normally you would just\ndrink milk but the milk we would drink\nwas from a breed of cows that makes A2\nmilk and they ate grass and that works\nwell with our biology the kind of milk\nthat you get now is from cows that are\nbred to eat grain and and corn and soy\nand that milk has the wrong kind of fat\nand it has a kind of protein called A1\nProtein that's very inflammatory so a\nlot of people who can't drink milk which\ninclude me because it messes up my gut\nroyally it just makes me it makes me\nstupid actually my brain swells up from\nit I get a lot of mucus I used to get\nthroat like I used to get more throat\ninfections like me too it's very similar\nso sometimes you can handle A2 milk but\nraw A2 milk is how we used to drink it\nand in many states it's still illegal\nand why the government thinks it has a\nright to tell you what you're allowed to\neat I don't know they don't have that\nright so it doesn't matter if they make\nit illegal they didn't have the right to\nmake it illegal so therefore it's not\nillegal in the world that I live in then\nagain if you're selling it they might\nstill try to arrest you then you got to\ngo to court but here's the deal raw milk\nfor many people is very very healing and\nfor some people whey protein especially\nif you're vegetarian but not vegan it's\na a source just get grass-fed way\nprotein because the animals are treated\nbetter and because it's a higher quality\nnutritional product but let's assume not\ngoing to drink cow's milk because for a\nlot of people it just doesn't work\nincluding me I don't touch it butter and\nghee usually are acceptable especially\nghee won't trigger allergies and mucus\nlike that for almost anyone well what\nabout the fake milks right so these are\nall Industrial Products unless you make\nit yourself and what they figured out\nwith almond milk was oh we can take\nleftover parts of almonds and you the\nones that are broken and unsightly and\nwe can use those to make milk and it's\njust a few almonds and some canola oil\nand some high fructose corn syrup some\nflavorings and we blend it up and we\nsell it for like $8 as a health food\nproduct it's not a health food product\nso almond milk is high in phytic acid\nthat sucks minerals out of your bone so\nyou have to take more minerals and it's\nalso high in oxalates which are the\nthings that are causing kidney stones\nand things that are causing gout and\njoint pain when you wake up even if you\nhave really bad skin and you're eating a\nton of these high oxalate foods like\nalmond milk and kale smoothies and all\nthis can be why because it's making tiny\nsharp calcium oxalate crystals in your\nskin that are coming out so I don't\nrecommend almond milk also if you're a\nvegan for Animals the number of bees\nabout a third of all bees die\npollinating almonds every year like it\nit is not a particularly clean product\nso then we say well oat milk okay that\nis the biggest scam on the planet right\nnow it raises your blood sugar as much\nas drinking a Coke it is not a hell food\nand it usually has glyphosate and it's\nhigh ftic acid that sucks minerals out\nof your body and I I know you might not\nlike hearing this\nbut do the math there's a tablespoon of\nOats blended into a bunch of water and\nyou spent six bucks on that like are you\ndumb right it's not a good move right so\nwhat should you drink there's two kinds\nof milk that are are okay one of them is\nmacadamia milk which is really expensive\nand you have to make it yourself because\nMacadamia have the right kinds of oil in\nthem but the other one that's abundant\nand healthy is coconut milk so if you're\ngoing to do it use coconut milk that's\nthe worst tasting one I know right it is\nthe worst tasting one but here's the the\nproblem though if you say okay I don't\nlike the taste of coconut milk and I'm\nwith you on that so I'm going I don't\ndrink any milks but yes yeah that that's\nthat's really the key you don't need to\ndrink a plant milk it's a madeup product\nthat you don't have a need for but if\nyou say I'm going to do one of these\nother things you're spending a lot of\nmoney you're getting anti-nutrients\nyou're getting mostly water and you're\nusually getting a toxic burden so like\nwhy why am I doing this again the thing\nthat milk has that's most important is\nit has protein and the second most\nimportant is it has good fats when you\nhave a replacement milk even coconut\nmilk there is no protein so the coconut\nyogurt you like it doesn't work because\nit doesn't have protein so you have to\ntake that and add way protein or add\nscoops of maybe hemp protein if you're\ndoing plant-based but you've got to add\na whole bunch of protein to it because\nNormal yogurt has that most people\ntolerate grass-fed yogurt pretty well I\nstill don't I can't touch cow's milk\nunless it's ghee for the most part or I\ncan do some butter but if I was to have\nyou know uh two tablespoons of regular\nmilk it messes me up my guts wrong it's\njust not right so that's an immune\nresponse so I just want to tell you\nyou're not getting protein in your plant\nmilks and you're getting stuff you don't\nwant in your plant milks so just don't\ndo it you've mentioned canola oil a few\ntimes as well and I feel like oils has\nbeen obviously in the biohacking world\nit's it's been known for a while but I\nthink it's finally coming into like the\nForefront of checking the back of\nsomething and going oh my gosh wow this\nsay canola oil palm oil you know the\nmillions of different oils walk us\nthrough that because I think that's kind\nof still for the majority of people like\nan under understood area like it's it's\nwe're just not aware unaware is probably\nthe right word like yeah we're unaware\nwe've been taught first calories are\nwhat matter and it turns out well\ncalories do entirely different things so\nwe've tossed that out for most people\nhave understood that's different and\nthen we say okay well it's how much fat\nare you eating but who would imagine\nthat different fats do different things\nin the body oh my gosh do you mean the\nkind of fat matters oh and different\nproteins so even saying fat carbs and\nprotein it doesn't mean anything unless\nyou know what it is so we zoom in on fat\nwell it turns out omega-6 fats which is\ncanola corn soybeans safflower even\ngrape seed\noil those are fats that when they enter\nthe body they slow your metabolism and\nthey cause inflammation because they're\nunstable fats they're called\npolyunsaturated fats and when you eat\nsaturated fats things like coconut oil\nor butter or ghee or most animal fats\nfrom like sheep or something or from\ncows but not from chickens then you end\nup saying oh the saturated fats they\ncan't oxidize because they're stable so\nyou eat those and they stimulate your\nmetabolism and they allow your body to\nmake\ntestosterone and to make other hormones\nthat your body needs and make stable\ncell membranes so we understand the\nbiochemistry of this but the food\ncompanies are saying well it's cheaper\nto do canol oil so let's fry our french\nfries in those canola oil and its its\ncousins there they're a major cause of\ndiabetes and cancer which are\nskyrocketing because they're unstable\nespecially when they're heated a lot and\nthey're pretty much in every packaged\ngood right they are but change is coming\nso before about the 1970s all French\nfriers were made with beef Tallow\nbecause it's a very stable oil that's\nfat from cows at McDonald's that's what\nthey use and then they switch to these\nseed oils and then all the diseases went\nthrough the roof so we have a problem\nfood needs to be affordable for everyone\none of the companies that I've invested\nin and that I'm backing that I'm most\nexcited about is called zero Acre farms\nand I don't work for them I did put a\nsmall amount of money in them but it's\nbecause of of the mission they found a\nway to use fermentation to make an oil\nthat is monounsaturated like olive oil\nthat is stable for frying at 25% the\ncost of canola oil for a restaurant and\nthey're scaling up to get to that price\npoint but what it's called zero acre\nbecause it'll remove millions of acres\nof corn Andoid from being grown to\nsqueeze oil out of them and they can\ntake sugar cane just the entire sugar\ncane not sugar and they can ferment it\nand make a healthy edible oil for humans\nand this is going to change the world's\nmetabolism it's a huge thing so in the\nmeantime you can go to a place has duck\nfat fries or towel fries which you\nwouldn't eat or you don't eat fries\ndon't eat fried food at restaurants is a\ngreat rule to live longer and don't eat\nthe salad dressing either tell them I\nwant real olive oil that's not cut with\ncanola oil and I want vinegar or lemon\njuice and you do that just those two\nthings nothing fried and do that and all\nof a sudden you find you lose weight\nyour brain is focused your body makes\nmore hormones it's that big of a deal\nI'm so glad you raised that because\nthat's the it's it's s it's such a tiny\nsimple change but it could save you from\nso many different things like I switch\nprobably might have been a year now but\nI traveled a lot this year on tour and\nthat was hard because my diet on tour\nwas not as easy to maintain cuz I was in\ndifferent cities every day and and I\ndidn't have a chef who was traveling\nwith me or anything like that and when\nI'm back here I've been eating like a\nWhole Foods diet only eating plants not\neating anything out of packages oh yeah\nyou know not eating pretty much no\npackage food whatsoever maybe now and\nagain and like that in and of itself has\ntransform I used to love a bag of chips\neven if they were like the healthiest\nchips that I could possibly find I love\na bag of chips I love uh you know I love\na little bit of crackers biscuits\nwhatever any of this kind of stuff\nknicknacks and just taking out packaged\nFoods has had a massive impact on how I\nfeel it's kind of life-changing to do\nthat and I real I missed an oil that\nshould get a shout out it's palm oil\nyeah so palm oil is saturated and I\nwould much rather eat something cooked\nin palm oil than canola oil the issue\nwith palm oil is mostly environmental so\nthere's deforestation and orang tangs\nand things like that but if you are at\nthe store and you want to buy some chips\nor crisps or what whatever you call\ncrisp is what I would have called it\nI've adapted bag of chips we'd call it a\nbag of crisps back in London yes so uh\nyou want to eat those look for something\nthat's cooked in coconut oil or palm oil\nMH and when you do that you're going to\nbe much healthier and they're going to\ntaste better and they're going to be\nmore satisfying because when you eat\nthose bad oils the omega-6 oils they\nmake you hungry really quickly cuz your\nbody says I got to deal with all this\ninflammation have some some sugar so all\nof a sudden you ate a a chip that felt\ngood and I don't generally eat stuff\nlike that maybe at a barbecue or\nsomething I'll bring a bag of those CU\ni' rather course I'm not perfect yeah\nand Dave I want to thank you for doing\nall this research because you know as as\nI've got older and I'm 36 now and as I\nget older every single year my health\ngoes up and up and up on the priority\nlist and I think for me it's been so\nchallenging because I grew up I would\nsay with no health education I'm\nbenefited by having a wife who's very\ndisciplined and focused and understands\nmore I'm grateful to have my podcast\nwhere I get to sit down with Incredible\npeople like you and I get introduced to\nbooks like yours that I have over the\nyears on longevity and Now smarter not\nharder and to me I'm just like I want to\nget this right to make getting older\neasier right like to get make getting\nolder like you're goals your goals suck\noh sorry that's a bad goal I want to\nmake I want to make getting old or\neasier how about I want to stop getting\nold and I want to stay how I am now or\nbetter every single want to be better I\nwant to be better let's do that let's do\nthat it's isn't that a different Vision\nit feels different right we have it so\nbuilt in that we're going to get old we\nare living in a world today where you\ncan measure as 20 years younger than\nyour calendar age I want that I want\nthat you don't have to get old right you\nmight age but the getting old thing\nthat's that's what we did in the 70s\nyeah it made me happy I was I was I've\nbeen playing a lot of pickle ball and\nthat's been like my my form of exercise\nthat I love and I enjoy and it's it's\nit's start and stop it's fast it's\ncompetitive I love every part of it and\nI just got beat by a 70-year-old a\ncouple of weeks ago and I loved it cuz I\nI just I was like I want to be like you\nand I was like it double my he destroyed\nme one person can do that and and that\nbrings up something that that's actually\nreally important it's learning from our\nelders the reason I can do all this by\nhacking is I was so desperate for my\nhealth in my 20s I started running an\nanti-aging longevity nonprofit group\nnear Stanford University so I was\nlearning how to maintain my health from\npeople in their 80s who could run\ncircles around me like that's possible I\nsaw it and I saw that in the 90s and if\nthey could do it back then we can do so\nmuch better now you thank you for\ncalling me out on that that's good I\nlike it you're welcome you're allowed to\nyeah I like that that's awesome I\nlearned from my elders you learned from\nthe guy in the pickleball court you can\nbe that guy when 70 yeah and what's\nreally going to happen when you're 70s\nyou can be that guy but look and feel\nlike you do now and we're building this\nworld for all of us and it's really\nimportant because the birth rate in all\ndeveloped Nations is so low right now\nwe're not replacing our population which\nmeans it's our job to be strong and\nYoung Forever well said well said the\nbook is called smarter not harder
