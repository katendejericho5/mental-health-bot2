    "transcript": "I grew up in a world where it's so\ncompetitive even if I'm not the most\ntalented I'm the hardest worker until\nyou're burnt out and you don't have\nanything else to give and then what look\nI'm trying to talk to you about a job\nopportunity do I look unemployed to you\nyou are emerging in Hollywood in such a\nreal way give it up for La anthy when my\nwhole marriage came crumbling down and I\nwas in that bed I was there by myself\nnobody gets married and says I'm getting\ndivorced you get married because you\nfeel like you found your person and this\nis what the rest of your life is going\nto be like what can I do I have to\nadjust before we jump into this episode\nI'd like to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett Lala thank thank you so much for\ndoing this honestly like I will always\nshow up for you you literally like you\ncame on the show when like I don't even\nknow anyone knew what the show was and\nyou I think we just connected online and\nwe'd started messaging and I was so\ngrateful when you came on and since then\nwe've stayed in touch we always stayed\nin touch and I always say you're my\nfriend and someone I could depend on and\nyou always say the right things at like\nyou just said something to me right now\nI was like I needed to hear that I\nneeded to hear that like today's been\nsome time one of those days and I was\nlike I needed that you always like know\nexactly what to say you're very sweet\nand I appreciate that and I want to\nlet's start there actually like one\nthing I've been encouraging my friends\nto do people that I love people I care\nabout is reflecting on difficult things\nthey've got through difficult things\nthey've broken through because I think\noften we do a lot of difficult things\nand I realized this through my mom\nactually so my mom is a superwoman she\nhas done so many difficult things in her\nlife but she sees them as is normal\nright so she never stops to think oh I'm\npowerful and I'm strong it's just the\npart of life just the part of life so\nwhat's something difficult or hard that\nyou've done in the last 12 months or\nrecently that you want to take a moment\nto just honor yourself for that is so\nnice I should honor myself I think you\nknow learning that healing is messy\nthat's something that I'm dealing with\nand it comes and goes it's not always\nthere but understanding that there's no\ntime limit on healing and giving myself\ncredit for healing and going through\neverything that I've been through and\nlearning that I don't always have to act\nlike everything's okay if it's not I\nhave a tendency to do that like it's one\nthing to not let people see you sweat\nwhich I do understand that and you don't\nneed to put all your business on social\nmedia or whatever but it's okay to feel\nthings and understand that healing is\nmessy so my mom sent me something\nrecently that was like you know be kind\nto yourself give yourself Grace because\nhealing is Messy as soon as you think\nlike oh I'm done with that I'm over that\nall of a sudden it's like why is this\nstill making me feel like that or you\nhear something or see something and like\nwhy am I still a little bothered by that\nand I hear you talk about this you know\nthere's no like time frame like okay\nonce it's been two months you're done\nwith whatever the difficult thing was\nyou shouldn't even be thinking about it\nanymore could be years and something can\nstill pop up and Trigger you or whatever\nand being kind to yourself during those\nperiods so I want to honor myself for\njust finally understanding healing is\nmessy and not being so hard on myself on\ncertain things to not say you should\nhave been done with that already why are\nyou still thinking about that or why did\nthat still bother you it's life we're\nhuman we have feelings things happen as\nyou said when you walked in Life Is Life\nLife Is lifing Life is lifing and you\nknow there's so many blessings in this\nbeautiful life and I'm blessed to have\nthe life that I have and I'm constantly\nyou know thanking God for this beautiful\nlife and sometimes you feel ungrateful\nor like what do you have to complain\nabout like you have a beautiful life\nyou're doing well might not have some of\nthe financial troubles or issues that a\nlot of people are going through that I\nhave had you know before in my life but\nit doesn't Shield you from feelings and\ngoing through things and I think a lot\nof time people kind of confuse that yeah\nI think different platforms and\ndifferent levels have different problems\nand they keep\nchanging the problems you have today\nweren't the problems you had then and\nthe problems you had then are not\nproblems you have today I feel like\nhealing is an interesting word because\neveryone's looking at what happens on\nthe outside but what do you think you're\ntrying to heal on the inside like what\nwhat have you discovered about what you\nare trying to heal I think on the inside\nI'm just trying to heal a person who\nprobably has dealt with feelings of like\nabandonment a person who has dealt with\nfeelings of not feeling good enough or\ndefinitely always having the questions\nof like why me why do this have to\nhappened to me why me why did I have to\ngo through this I give so much good in\nthe world I do so much for so many\npeople like why do I have to suffer or\ngo through what I feel like at times is\nsome of the hardest things to go through\nbut still keep a brave face still keep a\nsmile so understanding that like I\nreally do believe when people say you\nknow um that God gives his toughest\nbattles to his strongest soldiers and I\nremind myself of that like you went\nthrough it because you could and you\ncome out better and people can learn\nfrom you and can help somebody else and\nI just have to remind myself of those\nthings because you do get caught up in\nthe why me and like look at everyone\nelse they have this they have that why\nme why am I you know whatever it is so\njust getting better at that I think yeah\nand when you talk to people because I'm\nassuming that you know sometimes when we\nhave that view of like oh they have it\nall or they have it all I'm sure you\ntalk to people behind the scenes and\nrealize they don't have it all right\nright and so then how does that make you\nfeel when you realize oh wait a minute\nthey don't have it all yeah I mean it\ndoesn't make me feel feel good I'm not\nwishing for anyone to be struggling or\nnot happy but you just realize that\nthings are just not always what they\nseem and you know in the world of social\nmedia in the world of just constantly\nlike looking at everyone else whether\nit's how they look their bodies or their\nlives and saying oh I wish that could be\nme it's like it's not reality you don't\nknow what people are dealing with you\ndon't know what people go home to you\ndon't know what's happening on the\ninside and sometimes you do know cuz\nyou'll hear things or see things and\nyou're like oh I thought this person had\nlike the perfect life now there whatever\nyou know so it's just like really honing\nin on making yourself happy figuring out\nwhat it is that you need and not\ncomparing or always looking at something\nelse because if we do that I just feel\nlike you'll never be happy and you'll\nnever be satisfied because there's\nalways going to be somebody that looks\nbetter dresses better younger more\ntalented whatever it is like so if\nyou're looking for a reason to knock\nyourself down you're going to find it\nlike it's not that hard you're going to\nfind it so you have to behold within\nyourself and I am confident Within\nMyself I'm not insecure I'm confident\nand I do walk with a certain level of\nconfidence so that part I'm good at\ndealing with the kind of just like wow\nlike why me to certain things happen to\nI'm still you know pushing through that\nand learning every day like life is\nabout learning I don't think you're\nsupposed to ever have it all figured out\nyou strike me as somebody that has it\nall figured out but you're learning\nevery day and I think when we have these\nconversations you learn from us and vice\nversa like it's a constant learning\nexperience yeah I'm constantly trying\nit's really interesting isn't it when\nyou are in a position of influence\npeople often assume that you do have it\nall figured out right and I'm constantly\nI think people who listen to the podcast\nthey know me very deeply and intimately\nbecause they hear me say I struggled\nwith this this week or this is something\nI'm going through but if someone just\nsees a post on social media they think\noh yeah everything must be perfect and I\nfind that I encourage everyone and this\nis why you coming on the podcast is so\ngreat because I en encourage everyone to\nstudy people they follow a bit deeper\nnot to take them down or to think happy\nthat they've got problems too not that\nreason but the reason of like when you\nreally study someone or you get to know\nsomeone you start to realize we're all\nactually in a much more similar place\nit's so true and what I've learned in my\njourney of life is you start realizing\nno matter how much money how much status\nor whatever like my friends that I grew\nup with when I had you know nothing are\ngoing through similar issues as friends\nof mind who have all the money in the\nworld all the success All The People Are\nPeople what you deal with every day is\nwhat you deal with every day money\nstatus doesn't change that and I think\nwe live in a society where people\nautomatically assume money fixes\neverything or influence fixes everything\nor fame fixes everything not\nunderstanding that there's so many\namazing things that come with I'm not\ngoing to sit here and be like Oh being\nsuccessful being famous being whatever\nis like the worst thing in the world I'm\nnot that person I'm so grateful for my\nsuccess my fame my influence and I don't\nI don't take it lightly but it doesn't\nmean that it protects me or stops me\nfrom dealing with other things and fame\ninfluence comes with other sets of\nproblems you know people feeling like\nthey can criticize you people feeling\nlike your life is an open book and they\ncan say anything a lot of us when we go\nthrough things the whole world doesn't\nhave to know about it when people like\nus go through things it's open for\ndiscussion for the whole world and\neveryone has an opinion and that's not\neasy either so you just have to continue\nto kind of strengthen yourself to be\nable to deal with you know all of that\nthat comes with it yeah I love what you\nsaid there like I've thought about that\na lot too because you know last time you\ncame we were tracking your whole career\nJourney like you've done you've hustled\nyou've worked hard you've done so much\nto get to where you are today and I want\nto get to that but for me as I've been\non this journey I've been reflecting on\nwhat's changed over time as my external\nSituation's changed and what makes me\nfeel protected and you use that word\nprotection and I've realized that of\ncourse we have to have our internal\nprotection\nhow we feel about ourselves our\nconfidence our own practices but I found\nthat the thing that makes me feel the\nmost protected is knowing the people\naround me who really know me and how\nmuch closer we get through that process\nright like I have to take so much\nstrength in the fact that the people\naround me not only do they have my back\nbut they actually know me and understand\nme at a core and I kind of take a lot of\nenergy from that do you do the same I I\ntake so much energy from that I'm like\nthe people who know they know the people\nthat I need to depend on they're always\nthere I'm blessed to have an amazing\nfamily amazing group of friends that are\nlike ride or die that I know are there\nno matter what and it's something that I\ndon't take lightly so it's not about\nproving to the world anything like if my\ncore group gets it knows me inside and\nout knows my UPS knows my downs and are\nthere for me that's the energy I pull\nfrom as well I want to talk to about\nfriendship I think a lot of people feel\nquite even when you're close friends and\nI'm sure you you felt this it's hard to\nopen up about things that are going\nwrong in your life and I think a lot of\npeople who are listening or watching\nthat's something that they can relate to\nwhere it's like I have my friends but I\ndon't know how to tell them right that\nI'm going through this or I know they'd\ncare about me but I don't want them to\nfeel sorry for me that's it too or maybe\nthey're going through so much stuff that\nI don't want to put my stuff on them how\nhave you managed to keep strong\nrelationships as you've grown in life as\nyou've built your career how have you\nmanaged to keep that core\ninstead of losing it as you get more\nbusy I think that my friendships have\ngotten even stronger because of those\nmoments I don't base my friendships off\nof you know this person has only been\naround when everything's been great or\nwe only talk about sunshine and flowers\nand cupcakes like friends have to be\nthere through everything and you have to\nbe able to be okay with being raw and\nreal with people that you consider your\nfriend and don't throw that word around\nlightly if you're saying this is my\nfriend this is my go-to you should be\nable to share whatever is happening in\nyour life whether it's good or bad and\nthose are the things that Bond you you\nknow through those I remember the\nfriends that were there for me when I\nwas going through my divorce when I was\npublicly you know going through what I\nwas going through as a result of what\nhappened in my marriage like I remember\nmy friends that were there I remember\nwhen my son was really young and had to\nhave surgery and who was there in that\nmoment like I remember all of that and\nthose were the strengthening moments of\nour friendship now the fun stuff is\ngreat too I remember my friends who've\nbeen on vacation with me and got drunk\nand had had a great time but it's a\nbalance you know the real friendships\nhad a mix of all of that stuff because\nthat's what life is life is not always\njust fun in games life is up and down\nand up and down that that's that's what\nlife is was there anything that a friend\nsaid to you or guidance you heard when\nyou were going through a divorce that\nreally helped or that really stayed with\nyou or that you kind of carry around in\nyour heart just not to blame myself you\nknow this isn't your fault not to blame\nmyself that always kind of stuck with\nwith me cuz it's easy to just blame\nyourself or get down on yourself or what\nwas it you know that I did and when I\nsay not blaming yourself I'm not saying\ndon't take accountability for whatever\nyou might have had to do with the\nsituation like it's important to sit\nback and say okay where could I have\nbeen better because life is about being\nbetter and learning you don't want to\njust say oh this happened it had nothing\nto do with me you want to understand\nlike where could I have done better or\nwhere did maybe I fall short on some\nthings but that's different than blaming\nyourself for what happened and I think\nby taking accountability I was able to\ngrow and become a better person for\nwhatever happens in my life in the\nfuture you don't go through these\nexperiences not to learn then what was\nthe point like you don't go through\nthese experiences to then duplicate the\nsame issues in your next relationship or\nyour next marriage or or whatever it is\nthat's not what that was there for it\nwas to learn to get better and then to\napply that knowledge to the next\nsituation whether it's a friendship ship\nrelationship marriage whatever it is I\nlove what you brought out there and I\nwant everyone to just take note of that\nbecause I think we think we either have\nto take full responsibility or no\nresponsibility so we either blame the\nother person or we blame ourselves and\nit's only either orw and the truth is\nit's so much more balanced where it's\nlike I don't want to blame myself and\nbeat myself up because that's going to\nsend me down a ter yeah terrible spiral\nat the same time I'm not going to sit\nhere and just blame everything on the\nother\nSES look can how\ncan what is it that you think you\nlearned or what about you do you think\nhas become better or healed or what have\nyou worked on because of that shift in\nyour life um just a balance you know\nunderstanding balance I'm such a\ncareer-driven work driven person that\nthat could just take over my life and\nthat becomes what's you know the most\nimportant to me outside of my son\nthere's never been any anything that's\nmore important than cayenne and you know\nthis you just get caught up in the work\nand next thing you know friends or\nPartners or whatever are feeling\nneglected or like I just feel like you\nnever have time or you're not making\nthem feel special in their you know\nmoments and and being there for them\nbecause it's like you got to film one\nmore podcast I got to go to set I got to\nfilm one more episode I got to go do\nthis really fast but it'll be quick and\nI'll come right back you know and then\nyou realize when people friends as well\nare feeling like neglected in those\ndepartments problems can happen because\nof that you start looking for other ways\nto fulfill that void and that that need\nand that's how things happen so again\nit's not blaming myself but just being\naware of things that happen and and\nfinding that that balance and getting\nbetter at that balance and I need the\nbalance Jay for myself it's not even for\na partner for myself because I should be\nokay with having a personal life and a\nprofessional life and not feel guilty I\nwas the person that if I went on a\nvacation I felt guilty like I got to\nwork I can't be doing this like like I\ndon't want people to think I'm just\nhaving a good time I should be on set I\nshould be doing and like really beating\nmyself up meanwhile I work my ass off I\nshould be able to take a vacation if I\nwant to take a month off I should be\nable to do that I've worked I've been in\nthis industry since I was 16 years old I\nshould be able to do that I have enough\nequity in the game with all I've given\nit to be able to do that but I still\nwould feel so guilty over that so that's\nthe balance that I'm talking about yeah\nno I I'm really glad that you went that\nstep further like it's giving yourself\nto your friends a potential partner but\nalso to yourself what do you think it\nwas for you that blocked you from giving\nyourself that permission and the reason\nI asked that is because I was looking at\nthe studies in the US and it was saying\nhow so many people don't take all of\ntheir leave from work like most people\nare not taking their leave and there's\nnot even that much leave in the US to\ntake so when I was in the UK you get\nlike 30 days off a year wow and like I\nthink here yeah and here it's not that\nmany and so when I moved here and I\nremember looking at that I was thinking\nwow and still people aren't taking time\noff I think that's something people can\nrelate to that a lot of people struggle\nto think well maybe when I come back\nI'll have so many more emails oh my God\nI'm going to be so behind oh my gosh I\nwon't get promoted this year oh my gosh\nI might get let go I'm competing with\nthis person I may become irrelevant I\nhave to stay on top of stuff what was it\nfor you that kind of do you think\nstopped you from giving yourself\npermission to have a balance definitely\na fear and you and I always talk about\nfear a fear of someone's gonna come and\ntake my job or someone's going to come\nand take my place or I used to take so\nmuch pride in being like you know even\nif I'm not the most talented I'm the\nhardest worker no one can outwork me and\nthat was like my badge of honor like I\nwill outwork everyone until you're burnt\nout and you don't have anything else to\ngive and then what they move on to the\nnext person anyway so it's like you have\nto take care of yourself and I had to\nlearn that because I would just go until\nI couldn't go anymore and then not have\nanything to give to anyone because I\ndidn't have that b balance but that was\nall because of fear and not also\nbelieving in myself enough to say I'm\nenough and if someone is able to just\ncome and take this from me it was never\nmind to begin with and really being okay\nwith that um but I just think we well I\ngrew up in in a world where it's so\ncompetitive and it's like you know you\ncan't take your foot off the gas as soon\nas you do it somebody else is coming or\ndon't even give you know somebody else a\nchance to take your spot whatever that\neven means but that's the culture I grew\nup in and what I was condition and\nbrainwashed to always believe so it was\nlike go till you can't go anymore and\nnow I'm like I'm not doing that anymore\nhave I reached the place where I found\nthe perfect balance no but I am getting\nbetter at it I just told you I took a\ntrip I was at a couple different places\nprior to that I took Cayenne to the\nCayman Islands and we had a great time\nand I felt happy I felt not guilty for\ndoing that and I felt okay with posting\nabout it not thinking like oh they're\ngoing to think this girl she's always on\nvacation or something like that I felt\ngood good about that cuz I deserve it\nand I need to do that absolutely\nabsolutely and I love hearing the the\npractical ways in which it's actually\ntaking part it's really interesting it's\nso much about like what we get our\nsignificance from like what makes us\nfeel worthy and for some of us it's\noverworking for some of us it's\novergiving for some of us it's\noversharing and it's like what makes you\nfeel worthy today what makes you feel\nworthy and happy today definitely my son\nlike he makes me so happy because you\nstart really seeing the influence you\nhave over your child at a certain age\nwhere it's like wow everything I've\ntaught him or things I've tried to drill\nin his head now I'm seeing it actually\ncome to for wishing or he's repeating\nthings to me that I'm like oh he was\nlistening to me when I said that or he\nis following my guidance or advice you\nknow he's 16 years old now and he's\nmaking a career and a lane for himself\nin basketball and you know he's doing so\nwell but I just see how humble he is how\nkind he is is how he's all about you\nknow giving back to the community and\nall the things that are so important to\nme now I'm just seeing him take on all\nof that same stuff and that makes me so\nhappy because I feel like you know I did\na great job and it's not like I'm done\nbeing a parent but I did a great job\nthus far of being a parent and never\nallowing whatever was happening in my\nlife or to affect my parenting or affect\nhow I was with you know my child that's\nsomething that makes me happy and\nsomething I'm really proud of cuz not\neasy you know to deal with day-to-day\nlife and ups and downs and then come\nhome and be you know there for your\nchild and and and be willing to just\nlisten to their needs and what they have\ngoing on that's not easy what's been the\nbiggest thing you think he's taught you\ndefinitely patience everyone says like\nyou don't experience love till you have\na child and you're like what does that\nreally mean like I know what it's like\nto love someone but it definitely is a\ndifferent kind of love so just\nunconditional love patience and you know\nI always say that my son is my best\nfriend now it's interesting because\npeople say that and I don't know if\nyou've read about this Jay I'm curious\nto know your take people will say that\nyour children should not be your best\nfriend that you should be a parent and\nyour child should not be your best\nfriend I'm on the other side of it my\nson is my best friend and I'm still able\nto be a parent and have him as my best\nfriend and best friend I mean I spend\nmore time with my son than anyone else I\nlive with my child so he's the person I\nlive He's my roommate essentially and\nknows me in every shape and form the\nHappy Days the sad days everything and\nthere's nothing I don't feel like we can\ntalk about on his side on my side to me\nthose are all the qualities of a best\nfriend do I still parent him and\ndiscipline him and of course I do but\nthere's a lot of I read a lot of talk\nabout that and sometimes when I write\nlike hanging with my best friends like a\nyour son shouldn't be your best friend\nlike you should just be a parent that's\nthe problem these days parents trying to\nbe their kids friends and this and that\nI Come From a Different yeah I I mean I\ncan't obviously I'm not a parent so I\ncan't answer from that perspective but\nif I think about it with my parents I\nwould say at this point I'm good friends\nwith my parents I would say I wish we\nwere best friends growing up okay and I\nfelt that I was parented which made me\nactually not tell them stuff and and\nkeep secrets and do my own thing and not\nreally have that open relationship them\nwhich I wish I think would have been\nhealthier for me and for them and now\nI'm glad that it's evolved to where it\nhas but I agree I would have liked to\nhave been friendlier with my parents\nwhen I was younger because I think I\ncould have avoided a lot of the mistakes\nI made had I had that relationship with\nthem and felt comfortable talking to\nthem about certain yeah I was always\nscared to tell them anything to get in\ntrouble exactly and so and and I don't\nthink that that was a healthy feeling as\na child of oh I'm going to get into\ntrouble if I do not as a child as a\nteenager right uh but not a child I was\nobedient anyway but when I was a\nteenager it's like I think that's the\nage if you can be friends with your\n16-year-old that's pretty dope because\nand being friends Jay doesn't mean he\ndoesn't get in trouble because if he\ndoes something wrong he gets in trouble\nor you know I have to sit down and talk\nto him but I think it's the approach and\nthe way because sometimes just yelling\nor it's not effective at least from what\nI've seen with other people parenting\nyou know and I don't judge anyone's\nparenting but yelling screaming like\nthey're not hearing you so sometimes\njust having an honest conversation on\nwhy you shouldn't have done that or why\nthat was wrong for me that gets me\nfurther than like what the hell are you\nthinking why do like they blocking you\nout they're not hearing you anyway I\nactually went through something like\nthat the other day so I bumped into\nsomeone and I was talking to their\nteenager he was probably like maybe like\n14 15 okay and his mom was like behind\nme like telling him what to ask me and\nit was almost like she was making it out\nlike he wouldn't ask good questions\nright like not giving him the\nopportunity yeah and the thing is he was\nactually asking really smart questions\nand I was like really engaged but could\nsee that she kept distracting him and he\nkept like Mom just I'm I'm talking I got\nit I got it right and it was just really\nand I'd look back and and I'd smile I'd\nbe like he's cool like you know it's all\nright and it was just really interesting\nto me like she didn't trust that she'd\nactually been an amazing parent right\nand taught him well and put him in a\nsituation where he can handle himself\nyeah and he was doing great and I and I\nturned I said to her afterwards I was\nlike I just want you to know like you\nmust have raised your son really well\nbecause he was so present he asked me I\nwas so impressed by a 15-year-old asking\nthose kind of questions like I wanted\nher to know that too because I guess Mom\nguilt and reflecting and like kind of\nfeeling like it's never good enough must\nbe a big part of what you carry too yeah\nfor sure that's a real thing you know\nMom guilt and just everything you just\nsaid is is just so real because again we\nget in a habit of beating ourselves up\nfor everything so it's like blaming\nourselves for everything so you know my\nson's like this because of whatever so\nit is nice when I always say the biggest\ncompliment I've ever heard is when\npeople tell me your son's so\nwell-mannered he's so humble he so down\nto earth he cares about people like that\nmakes me feel better than anything any\naward any any you know high-rated TV\nshow what a movie anything like someone\nto tell me that my kid is kind and\nhumble and well-mannered that's like the\nbest thing I could ever hear yeah that's\nbeautiful I love hearing that and I I\nwant to talk about your career CU last\ntime you came we kind of did a a full\nlike biography of like all the jobs and\nlike how you started we talked about\nyour first job and how you broke through\nwhat about you're a driven ambitious\nperson still despite everything you've\nachieved what is that drive pursuing\ntoday like what does that look like\nright now I'm always trying to figure\nout what my next thing is um I'm always\nworking extremely hard I think I still\nam close enough to remember what not\nhaving felt like to continue to push\nmyself the way I do I'm not that far\nremoved from remembering what that felt\nlike and it lives in me and it's close\nto me so I'm like I don't like that I\ndon't want to go back there so that's\nthe motivation and the drive to continue\nto push forward and I enjoy it like I\nlike working I mean my mom tells me all\nthe time like you don't think you should\njust like take a break and I'm like Mom\nI like working some people like other\nthings I like working some people you\nknow rather be at home and do certain\nthings which is fine everyone has a\ndifferent motivation I like working that\nbrings me happiness that brings me joy\nso I push myself in that in that\ndepartment but for me I'm always trying\nto see what's next right now you know\nI'm I'm heavy in the acting space\nproducing space really big on my prison\nreform charity which takes up a lot of\nmy time and you know giving back in that\nway is so important to me so those are\nkind of where my immediate focuses are\nright now but there's always so many\nthings you know happening with the\nacting and production like what part of\nit right now do you feel most immersed\nand in love with because you've done\nboth for a while now it's like what's\nthe that's kind of like bringing you\nalive right now so you know just finding\nprojects that I'm interested in\nproducing is so amazing because you can\nnow bring something that you love to\nlife and you can be in control of that\nIP or whatever it is and bring it to\nlife so producing just puts you in\ncontrol for so long as an actor you're\nwaiting for someone else to give you an\nopportunity you're auditioning with 10\nother girls that look very similar to\nyou and just hoping that hey pick me\npick me I'm the right person for the\nrole and nine times out of 10 you never\nyou you don't get picked I mean you get\nthose lucky times but for the most part\nyou don't get you don't always get\npicked so by producing you're not\nwaiting now you're creating and you're\nalso putting yourself in a position to\ncreate jobs and opportunities for other\npeople and that's what I'm about opening\nthe doors for other people to come in\nand you know have these experiences and\nbe able to give them you know a piece of\nwhat I have going on so that's what I\nlove about producing and just going out\nthere and finding projects that mean\nsomething to me and it's not always\nabout like oh I want to produce this cuz\nI want it to be this huge success of\ncourse you want things you do to be a\nhuge success but sometimes you want to\ndo it for you like this I'm passionate\nabout this I want to tell this story and\nwhoever gets it gets it maybe this is\nnot the billion dollar hit or whatever\nmaybe this is just for a small group of\npeople that are into this but that\nmatters to me so it that's what gets me\nexcited from the producing standpoint\nand acting I'm I am on a show so it's\ngreat to just have steady work and I\nlove you know the people I work with I\nlove the show I'm a part of um it's it's\nincredible and it's nice to just always\nhave that kind of in the stash yeah\nabsolutely you you spoke about rejection\nthere again another thing I think people\nrelate to whether they're auditioning\napplying for jobs like it's one of those\nthings that we all face in life in\ndifferent Realms and I think people\noften think that when you get to a\ncertain level of success you don't get\nrejection anymore true how does that\nfeel like after having had you I don't\nknow how many auditions you must have\ndone in your life God more than I could\never count right like how many like\ntaped auditions like in person\nsigning the contract before thinking\nthat I definitely had the job just to\nfind out that they're not going with me\nI mean I've had everything happened to\nme it does it get easier and how do you\nreact to rejection differently today\nthan you did 16 years ago so today I\nrealized that most of the time it has\nnothing to do with you there's so many\nother factors and now being on the\nproducing side I see the other factors\ncould be anything could be height just\ncould be how you you stand next to your\nco-star could be a million things that\nare out of your control is not a\ndecision based on you weren't good\nenough or you weren't talented enough\nand once I realized that I got better\nwith dealing with it and also being\nhappy and grateful for the person who\ndid get the job because for whatever\nreason they were the right person for\nthat job not feeling like oh why they\ngive it to them and not me like actually\nleading with Grace and kindness and\nrealizing that because I started doing\nthat more good things started happening\nfor me but in the beginning it was like\noh they don't like me oh I didn't do a\ngood job oh they think I suck I\nshouldn't be doing this like I was ready\nto give up on acting 100 times I was\nlike clearly this is the one thing\nthat's never going to happen for me like\nI had to have one thing that just wasn't\ngoing to go this is it but I just kept\nbeing persistent kept learning kept\ngetting better and then realizing now a\nlot of the decisions are not based on\nTalent there's just so many other\nfactors when my videos were first seen\nlike s years ago around a year later\na TV production company had reached out\nand said we want to make a TV show about\nyour work right and I was like this is\nso cool I never imagined in a million\nyears that that would even be possible\nand so we we made the deck we went and\nlike pitched it all these companies and\nit was really interesting because no one\ntook the show I was really passionate\nabout the idea we' created I thought it\nwas really cool and different and no one\ncared like it didn't even go beyond the\nfirst meeting like from the first\nmeeting I was like we're not sure and\nit's really interesting to me because I\nwas talking about this with a friend a\ncouple of weeks ago and I was saying\nthat one thing that happened was it\nbuilt a number of long-term friendships\nso everyone I met at those pictures not\neveryone but some of the people have\nbecome long-term friends that I actually\nstill see now socially even though we\nnever did anything professional so there\nwas a massive win the other thing was it\ngave me a great experience of what that\nprocess is like I'd never done it before\nand now I actually understand what that\nlooks like and it was a complete\nlearning curve but the third one which\nis the best one is I often say people\nhad I had been given that show I\npotentially may never have started this\npodcast I potentially may never have\nwritten my book I potentially may never\nhave gone on tour this year because I\nwouldn't have had this opportunity to\nhave to build my own work that's so true\nthat's what I want to remind people is\nlike just trust in the timing as long as\nyou're moving forward that's it and I\nthink that's the mistake that we often\nmake is that our disappointment slows us\ndown or like our feeling of failure\nforces us to just just switch off and\ninstead when you're moving shifting\nfiguring things out discovering\nanything's possible yeah it's so true\nand it's funny because on our last\npodcast the I said it's been years and\nyou said that clip is still viral but we\ntalk about fear and we always say that\npeople stop because they're disappointed\nor fear right before something great is\ngoing to happen like you stop and don't\neven realize right past that if you push\npast that feeling if you push past that\namazing things are going to happen and\nbecause of our talk I realized how much\nthat resonated with people like don't\nlet the fear and disappointment stop you\nbecause you don't know what's going to\nhappen after that let it build you let\nit build your character let it build\nyour armor to be strong to go through\nthese things so that you can keep like\nyou said as long as you're moving\nforward it's just so important what What\nFear are you trying to push forward from\nright now in your life I'm such a people\npleaser and I've always wanted to even\nas a young kid I've always wanted to be\nliked by everyone I was that person like\nI wanted everybody to be my friend and\nit's funny because people say all the\ntime oh LA's friends with everybody\neverybody loves la la which is great I\ndon't think everybody loves me but\nthat's great but also being okay with\nunderstanding that you'll never be able\nto please everyone especially in this\nday and age of we talked about social\nmedia everyone now having a platform to\ncomment to tell you what you're doing\nwrong and speak about who you are as a\nperson people that don't don't even know\nyou there was a time where that would\nhave really rattled me and bothered me\ncuz it's like well\nyou don't even know me you never even\nhad a conversation with me if you knew\nme you would love me you would see I'm\nthis type person now it's like I'm\nsecure in myself like so I'm continuing\nto push through that fear of wanting to\nbe liked or the fear of someone not\nliking me I should say that the fear of\nsomeone not liking me I've gotten so\nmuch better at that and just embracing\nthe people that love me and care about\nme another thing my mom's always told me\nI I quote my mom a lot she's she's a\nvery smart person another thing my mom\nalways told me is\ncelebrate the people that are there you\nyou know you can have a party or a get\ntogether and the first thing you'll say\nis well why didn't so and so come yeah\ndamn I invited so and so why aren't they\nhere you're not even acknowledging the\n10 15 20 people that came to support you\non your birthday or whatever the\noccasion was well damn I invited so and\nso they didn't even come like I always\nremind myself of that celebrate the\npeople who are there for your moments\nwho want to be there with you and stop\nworrying about the person who wasn't\nthere say thing with comments everyone\nJay we love you you're the greatest we\nlisten to everything that one person's\nlike Jay what the hell are you talking\nabout you don't know what you're talking\nyou're like zooming in on that want to\nfind out you want to respond you want to\ngo to their page see how they look and\nall but you just had a thousand comments\nabout how wonderful you are and that one\nwill just throw people off I've just\ngotten so much better at that I won't\ngive somebody that much power over me\nand again I want to celebrate the people\nwho are celebrating me that's what I'm\ngetting better at yeah no I love that\nyou said that I I literally it was a\nhabit that I used to have where you'd\nsee all these good reviews or good\ncomments and you would literally just\nscroll past them just waiting for the\nnegative one and I've changed lit right\nlike you're just you're treating the\ngood ones like oh yeah sure of course I\ndon't you don't really mean that and\nthen when someone says something bad and\nI've trained myself now like I genuinely\ndo this and I talk about on the podcast\na lot I will sit there and I will read a\npositive review I read a comment a\npositive comment and I'll let it sit\nhere it's so important and I'll just let\nit sit there and I'll let myself accept\nit because for so long I just tried to\nlike not let myself accept it and I\ndon't mean Let It Go to your head I mean\nlike feel it in your heart like someone\nfelt like telling you that your work or\nyour words or whatever it was your life\nor that clip of you on the last podcast\nlike that that made a difference in\ntheir lives let that just let yourself\nreceive that and I wish all of us would\nallow ourselves to receive love as\nseriously as we receive hate hate true\nwhen you see hate you don't think that\nmight not be true you just accept that\nit must be true whereas when you see\nlove you think oh yeah they didn't\nreally mean that oh it probably isn't\nthat real right it's so interesting how\nwe secondes and it's interesting because\nwe'll believe the hate is true from\nsomeone who doesn't even know us yeah\nthis is coming from someone who never\nhad a conversation with you who knows\nnothing about you so it's like it's it's\nthe wrong way to think but you had to\ntrain yourself to think differently I\nhad to train myself to think differently\nfor me A lot of times it's better for me\njust not to read anything because I\nstill can get hyperfocused on so I don't\nI don't really get caught up in that I\nget caught up in more like when people\nstop me and say you know love you L\nthanks for this or whatever it is those\nare my genuine you know moments and I do\nstill sometimes you know take a peek but\nI don't go too deep that's safer I I\ndon't I don't I don't go too deep I\nthink that's safer and and of and\nsometimes when I see criticism I'll to\nallow myself if I'm in a good space cuz\nI agree with you like what I'm sharing\nis when you're in a good space if you're\nreally struggling with it just turn it\noff and get away from it I'm fully with\nyou but if I am in a good place I'll\nlook at criticism and I'll say let me\ntake the feedback and leave the\ncriticism like how do I do that like how\ndo I listen to this allow it in but then\nleave the part that that is kind of the\nVenom in it or the spite or the\nferociousness like take that out and\ntake the feedback because there could be\nsomething for me to learn I'm open conr\npart of or constructive criticism part\nof it I do understand that I don't think\nall of us are there yet NE neither am I\nI'm just I'm just I'm trying exactly\nwe're we're trying and and a lot of us\nyou know are still struggling with\nunderstanding what being loved feels\nlike or never being loved growing up you\nknow I work with so many people through\nmy charity and just people I know who\nyou realize some of the basic principles\nof just love they've never experienced\nand don't understand what that is but\nthey do understand hate being told\nyou're not good enough being ignored not\nbeing paid attention to so they\ngravitate more to that because that's\nwhat they're used to so it's just about\nchanging the narrative and I talk about\nthat with you know the group that I work\nwith through through my charity 360 all\nthe time is like changing the narrative\nchanging those negative thoughts into\npositive thoughts so those that's really\nimportant what got you involved in the\nprison reform work and what is the thing\nthat you think would surprise us to\nlearn about it because You' actually\nspent time you're working with people\nit's it's your charity it's your project\nwhat do you think would surprise us I\nthink that people would be surprised how\nsimply changing a person's environment\nand simply loving someone can be all you\nneed to actually see a complete change\nin a person telling someone you love\nthem telling someone you're proud of\nthem is sometimes enough to just\ncompletely change a person and realizing\nthat those simple words a lot of people\nhave never even heard before it's\nmind-blowing that I'll sit with the\nyoung men in my program I mostly work\nwith young men ages 18 to 21 and they\nwill tell me they've never heard someone\nsay I love you before they've never\nheard definitely never heard someone say\nI'm proud of you what have I ever done\nto for someone to be proud of me or\ndefinitely just never knew what feeling\nimportant to somebody was and when they\nstart feeling that the change you see in\nthem when I put them in situations\nwhether it's jobs or things to thrive\nlike how amazing they've been doing just\nbecause the environment is different you\ncan love somebody all you want and then\nput them back in that same toxic you\nknow dysfunctional environment and then\nlike well why are they acting like this\nthey shouldn't be acting like this why\nare they being a menace to society I\nmean but we wouldn't last one day in a\nhousehold like that you know and just\nbeing compassionate so love and a\nchanging environment are like two of the\nkey things that I've seen where I've\nseen the most success and the most\nchange for sure yeah that is that that\nis fascinating and how do you get like I\nguess the external perception is\neveryone would be quite hard in prison\nand be quite cold how do you have a\nconversation about love and compassion\nand empathy with someone who hasn't had\nit before like how do you even start\nthat conversation because I think the\nperception would be they'd just be like\nI don't need to be loved like there'd be\na certain like kind of Shield to it is\nthat real is that true or do you find it\nquite easy to do when when I first come\nin it's not easy there's like if it's a\nnew group it's kind of the Stone Face\nmean yeah yeah we know la la but what\nshe what she going to talk to us about\nbut it's really just having real\nauthentic conversations when you talk to\nsomebody Jay you just have that talent\nto where they know you're speaking from\na genuine place when you talk to me I'm\nlike I got to listen to what Jay's\nsaying like I got what what would Jay do\nin this situation you just have that so\nit's like when you're speaking from your\nheart and you're leading with love\npeople feel that even the hardest people\nfeel that because at everyone's core\nwhat do we want we want to be loved\neveryone wants to be loved whether\nthey've experienced or not at everyone's\ncore they want to be loved so I'm going\nto hit you in that place that just wants\nto be loved and I'm also going to make\nyou understand that I understand what\nyou've been through I understand why you\nmay have made some of these choices and\nguess what I'm not judging you but I'm\npushing you to do better and that's how\nI kind of run my group and what we talk\nabout and once they hear that and feel\nthat it just melts away they just want\nto hug they just want you to tell them\nyou love them they just want to sit down\nand have some food with you it just like\nmelts away and it's it's emotional it's\nincredible to see and I wish that more\npeople could be involved in the work and\nsee this instead of just you know\nwriting certain people off because of\nwhatever they've been through because\none thing I always say is hey these guys\nin my program are not going anywhere so\nyou got two Cho choices they can either\nbe an asset to our communities or they\ncan be a problem which one do you want\ncuz they're not going anywhere so I\nrather mold them and work with them to\nbe assets and great fathers and great\nCommunity leaders and great workers in\nour community than be a problem and\nsometimes all they really need is to\nfeel supported and to feel loved that's\nbeen my experience for sure what Drew\nyou to that work specifically I mean you\ncould have started something about\nanything in the world why what was it\ndeeply inside of you that was like this\nis where I want to put my energy and\nefforts I think just just growing up\nthat's always been a part of life like\nknowing someone who's in jail seeing\ndifferent things but feeling helpless\nlike what can I do I can just go visit\nwrite a letter here and there I'm not in\na position to do anything you would see\nthings that you wanted to change but\nfeel helpless and now I'm in a position\nwhere I can actually make change you\nknow I can actually use my voice and my\nplatform to make a change and help\npeople I care about who are still\nincarcerated or people who have been\nincarcerated you know help them change\ntheir experience and provide them with\ndifferent things that people before us\ndidn't have so I'm going to use my\nplatform for that and also as a mom of a\n16-year-old a young black man I\nunderstand you know how all of us are\none decision or one bad moment away from\nbeing any of the kids that I deal with\nwho are incarcerated right now how many\nof my kids was just wrong place at the\nwrong time time hanging with the wrong\ncrowd we can relate to that I have a son\nlike he could be at the wrong place at\nthe wrong time trying to be cool running\nwith a certain group of kids anything\ncan happen so I'm sympathetic to that\nand I think that's where I draw my\ninspiration from to want to do the work\ndid you see the lack of support like\nbreaking families like did it how how\nbad did it get it got bad it got bad I\nsaw it it it got bad I had you know one\nof the closest people to me mother was\nincarcerated for many many years and\njust seeing what it was like for him to\ngrow up without his mom you know being\nthere she was there in every way but she\nwas incarcerated she was an amazing she\nis an amazing mother but she was\nincarcerated and just watching what what\nthat felt like and feeling like there's\ngot to be a way to still hold the family\nbonds even with this going on so just\nseeing things and like this doesn't make\nsense or this is supposed to be a\nrehabilitation but there's no\nRehabilitation going on where are the\npro programs where are the things so\nthat people can come out and not do the\nsame mistakes or be better equipped to\nmake better decisions like what are we\ndoing and now again being in a position\nI would see all of that but again feel\nhelpless like what am I going to do I\ncan't do anything all I could do is go\nvisit on the visiting days buy some food\nout the vending machine and call it a\nday like what am I going to do but now I\ncan do something so it's just what I've\nbecome so passionate about and when I\nlook at the young men in my program I\nalways say I speak to them and look them\nthe same way I talked to Cayenne my son\nwho's 16 years old because they're 18\nthey're two years away from cayenne and\ndealing with some of the same struggles\nand issues that I see Cayenne goes\nthrough you know insecure trying to fit\nin trying to be the cool kid you know\nall of these things that you know\nsometimes can lead to bad decisions and\nand trouble if you don't have strong\nfamily and strong support and they don't\nhave that yeah could you tell us maybe\nsome of the stories that you've seen of\npeople you know coming back into society\nand some of the moments where you're\nlike wow this is it's inspiring and hope\nforgiving yeah so I did I had a kid in\nmy program his name is Rondo and while\nhe was incarcerated I bought someone who\nworked for reform Alliance which is\nfounded by Michael Rubin Meek Mill Jay-Z\nI had Jessica Jackson who works really\nclose with with Kim um Kardashian so\nthey came and they visited and Rondo\njust stood out to them and I remember\nJessica telling him when you get out I'm\ngoing to have a job for you you really\nhave blew me away won me over and they\nwaited and waited for him to come out\nwhen he came out he came out like on a\nThursday I was at the court when they\nreleased him he came out on Thursday he\nwas in that office on Monday starting\nhis job working so hard and now when you\nsee this kid Jay it's unbelievable he's\ntraveled the whole country he's spoken\non platforms with Kim who's my best\nfriend obviously so I'm like Kim and\nRondo side by side talking about prison\nreform him speaking to the the Gen Z\npopulation about you know what needs to\ndone his experiences I'm just mind blown\nI found this kid in Riker's Island\nfighting you know dealing with so many\ndifferent things and now he's side by\nside with Kim and Michael Rubin not too\nlong ago I'm like he's at Michael\nrubin's house like hosting a panel and\ndifferent it's just it's mind-blowing\nand what was it opportunity change of\nenvironment love that made the change\nand we have others you know that are\nfollowing in the same path but it's\namazing to see it's like it makes you\njust feel like it's all worth it like\nyou just like everything I'm doing is\nworth it yeah that's beautiful thank you\nso much for sharing that with us I think\nit's it's hard sometimes to you know\nconnect the dots I was talking to I\nthink you probably know Scott as well\nScott Budnick I was Scott I I was dinner\nat Scott like a couple of weeks ago and\nso passionate place and for those of\npeople who don't know Scott made the\nthree hangover movies but then also made\njust Mercy you know that movie for him\nwas all about prison reform and changing\nthe narrative and trying to give people\nan opportunity and thinking you know how\nwe feel about people and and how we how\nwe treat people who've made certain\ndecisions and it's so phenomenal to hear\nthat so many people also all of you are\ncollaborating yeah for sure in order to\ndo this for sure you can't do this type\nof work Al J you need a support system\nand my charity again is 360 and I'm so\nhappy to have reform Alliance as a\npartner who really guide me and help me\ncuz I'm new to the space I'm not new to\nthe experience but I'm new to the space\nand just learning and navigating and\nthem just really holding my hand through\nthe whole thing has been great you can't\ndo it you know alone but it's a\nchallenging space but such a rewarding\nspace at the same time yeah Lala what's\nyou know you've had such a career in the\npublic eye life of the public eye what's\nsomething about you that you think\npeople don't know that you'd you'd love\nthem to know people around me always say\nlike people don't know how funny you are\nlike I'm joking around all the time like\nI'm always up for having a good time\nlike I want to be the life of the party\nand I love seeing everyone around have a\ngood time those are some things like I'm\njust learning to just enjoy you know\nlife and and the new chapter in my life\nyou know it still is new coming from you\nknow being married not anymore and just\nlike what does that look like and that's\nwhat I said you know you can't put a\ntime frame on things people would think\noh by now she would already be in\nanother relationship or be married again\nor whatever and none of that has\nhappened yet and I'm okay with that I'm\njust going with the flow and whichever\nway life takes me I'm just I'm just\ngoing that way and just understanding\nthat everything happens when it's\nsupposed to not rushing things just\nenjoying the moment yeah I definitely\nfound your humor came through when I\nfirst met you I was just cracking up\neverything you saying and I was just\nlike you know it's you you definitely\nfeel that when you meet someone and it's\nit's interesting because yeah I feel\nlike people say the same when I'm when\nI'm on stage or when I'm in person I'm\nhopefully a lot funnier than I am on my\nsocial media page when I'm with my wife\nI'm definitely funnier cuz I'm borrowing\nfrom her cuz she's hilarious right right\nbut it's so hard transitioning and it's\nso hard transitioning in the public eye\nbecause it's almost like you have all\nthese opinions you have other people's\nnarratives you're still trying to figure\nthings out yourself and it's almost like\nI almost liking it I would say to people\nimagine you're going through something\nand everyone in your family everyone in\nyour friend circle is talking about it\nand everyone has their version that's\nwhat you're experiencing at a news level\nor a World level right and and that's\nvery difficult when you are either in\nthat space yourself or you have friends\nin that space and you see how\nchallenging it is and you're saying\nyou're trying to enjoy the moment and\nand you haven't obviously like you're\nsaying you haven't just moved on and\nit's not as easy is the hardest thing\nabout it that you thought life was going\na certain way and then it didn't is that\nthe hardest thing about it that's the\nhardest thing you don't get married to\nget divorce nobody gets married and says\nI'm getting divorced you get married\nbecause you feel like you found your\nperson and this is what the rest of your\nlife is going to be like and you start\nbuilding a life with this person and\nthen something changes that you weren't\nprepared for that you don't have the\ntools and skills to no one's going to\nprepare you for a divorce you're married\nright now Jay nobody's telling you Jay\ncome sit down let me tell you what's\ngoing to happen when you get divorced\nnobody nobody's doing that we're wishing\nyou and your wife the best to ride off\ninto the sunset forever together so\nyou're not equipped with the knowledge\nand the tools on what to do emotionally\nor anything when that happens and then\nyou just find yourself in a position to\njust figure it out so that's that's\nreally difficult and Life For Me looks\ndifferent right now and I still have\nthose moments where I can be at home and\nI'm like you could never tell me that\nthis would be my life right now and I'm\nnot saying that's a bad thing I love my\nlife right now but you know owning a\nhome by by myself my son and I you know\nliving together then on certain days him\ngoing to stay with his dad and then I'm\nhome alone and it's still a family but\nseparate in a sense you know and just\nokay well what time you coming home\ntoday like you could have never told me\nthat that was going to be my life life\nbut what can I do I have to adjust like\nI have to adjust and be strong and\nfigure out what the new Norm is this is\nmy new normal and I just had to adjust\nto it was it easy of course not and are\nthere still days where it can hit you\nand and be really hard yeah and I want\nto be honest and tell people that\nbecause it's been a while for me and you\nwould really think that by now like\nthat's something I never think about\nanymore of course I do had a family like\na beautiful family and now I still have\na a family but it just looks a little\nbit different and I'm okay with that but\nit's still your moments where you're\nlike wow this is this is different yeah\nabsolutely and and I guess it sounds\nlike both of you have been able to be\nthere for cayenne so that he's having\nthe co-parenting is strong with us and\nthat's something I'm very grateful for\nbecause whatever happened between me and\nhis dad I don't feel like Cayenne should\nhave to suffer because of that so we try\nto do a good job at co-parenting and\nstill you know leading with love and and\nkids are going to be a reflection of\nwhat they see like I could tell him all\nday oh you know know me and your dad but\nif he sees us arguing all the time or\nnever around each other then it doesn't\nmatter what I say but we make it a point\nfor him to see us getting along and both\nbeing there for his moments his\nbasketball games his school plays you\nknow parent teacher conference whatever\nit is so he always feels supported\nbecause one day cen's going to have a\nfamily and I want him to understand you\nknow what having a family means and even\nthough mom and dad might not have been\nable to figure it out in the traditional\nway we still loved you and my hope is\nthat he can do better than we did and\nyou know what it is what's really\ninteresting about that is I don't know\nanyone whose life is actually\ntraditional in the traditional way like\neven even people have stayed together\nforever like I don't know it's so\ninteresting right like how we have these\nstereotypes and these views of like what\na healthy successful relationship looks\nlike between a family people friendships\nlike my relationship with my parents is\nvery different to what I would consider\nthe traditional perfect relationship\nwith your parents because I just that\nwasn't our way yeah and and it's so\ninteresting because you kind of almost\nalways make yourself feel guilty or\nshamed for not having the traditional\nthing true but then when I actually\nthink about like who has the traditional\nsetup I don't know no has it and I think\nthe more you go through life you start\nunderstanding and realizing that and now\nI saying is like whatever works for them\nlike whatever like who am I to judge and\nsay it shouldn't be this way it should\nonly be this way I mean nothing is\ntraditional anymore people just have to\nfigure out what works for them and what\nthat looks like for them like if it\nworks for you that's what matters\nbecause at the end of the day I always\nsay when you're going through something\nwhen you're down when you're depressed\nmore times than not you're dealing with\nthat alone you have your friend support\nbut I'm saying in those critical moments\nwhen you're in that bathroom looking in\nthat mirror and you're crying and going\nthrough stuff you're going through that\nalone so make decisions that make you\nhappy and not worrying about what\neverybody else is going to say or how\npeople are going to view me because in\nthose Quiet Moments You Are by yourself\nand you have to face yourself whatever\nthat looks like and I had to learn that\nbecause again the people please earn me\nwhat is this one going to say or is this\none going to be mad if I do this I got\nto make this one happy and it was always\nabout everybody else and putting myself\nlast and then when I when my whole you\nknow marriage came crumbling down and I\nwas in that bed I was there by myself\nand I had to deal with that by myself\nyeah that's the truth what is being\nloved by yourself and someone else look\nlike now for you what have you learned\nabout how you want to be loved by\nyourself and potentially by anyone else\num words hold so much power getting\nbetter at like speaking nicely to myself\nbeing kind not that I used to just like\nbeat myself up and say negative things\nbut like wow La look how much you've\naccomplished look how many people you've\nhelped look at the sun you've raised\nlike you've done really really good in\nthe public eye you've never like just\ncrumbled and fell apart you were able to\nkeep it together you went through\nsomething that would break most people\nlike what I went through would have\nbroken a lot of people and I handled it\nwith as much grace as I possibly could\nand afterwards I it didn't make me\nchange how I feel about like love I\ndon't know if marriage is still in the\ncards for me it's kind of changed my\nperception on that one of my friends was\nlike you cannot go on podcast and say\nyou're never getting married again I'm\nlike so I'm open I'm just saying that\nthat I don't know if that's in the cards\nbut I'm being open to whatever happens\nand being loved by somebody else at this\npoint to me is just really aligning with\nsomebody that makes me feel happy makes\nme feel like I can be myself and\nsomebody who I just enjoy being around\nit's not like I'm looking for someone to\ntake care of me it's not like I'm\nlooking for a father for my son and we\nhave all of those things now it's about\nhow are you connecting with with me how\nare you making me feel and I get excited\nwhen I think that or believe that that\nperson is out there somewhere and who is\nit going to be like and when are they\ngoing to come find me like you know I\nget excited about those things because\nwho doesn't want that in their life I\ndon't think you're meant to just go\nthrough life alone like who doesn't want\nthat there's so much of what you've said\ntoday which is so relatable to so many\nso like connected to so many people was\nhot you bring it out of me Jay you just\nmake it so comfortable and I just I mean\nI follow you I follow follow your words\nyour podcast I'm on your page all the\ntime I'm always looking for quotes from\nyour page but there sometimes I got to\nbe careful cuz I'm like if I post this\nquote they're going to think I'm talking\nabout so so like I'm always like cuz\nsome of your quotes are just so spot on\nI'm like that's exactly what I was\nthinking so I'm always going to your\npage finding quotes I have a million\nscreenshots of your quotes in my phone\nbut just thank you for being there for\nall of us in the way that you are and\njust making everybody feel so\ncomfortable and loved and you know I I\nI've read your book I follow what you\nsay in some of my hard moments I refer\nto your podcast and different things and\nit just really helps me so I just\nappreciate that you're just going to\npick up the phone yes I got to pick I\ndon't want to bother you yeah just call\nokay so then I'll pick up the pH more no\nI I just really really really believe\nthat if we just look at the essence of\nthe humanness in everyone that we meet\nand you just realize like everyone is so\nbeautiful and wonderful and powerful and\nphenomenal but we just we've missed it\nbecause we've all been covered over\nright by everything else and even that\nperson may not be able to see that in\nthemselves and I just I try and see\npeople through the eyes that I hope one\nday they'll be able to see themselves\nthrough and that's my only goal really\nin in how I try and live I don't want to\nlive to to judge or criticize or compare\nor be better than anyone or holier than\nanyone like it's if if we could always\nlook at each other as equals like true\nequals because we are at our Essence\nwe're exactly the same every single\nperson every single animal being on this\nplanet is exactly the same in the\nessence and the pure sense of it all and\nI think all we can do for each other is\nprovide a safe space the world's hard\nenough anyway it's so hard it's all hard\nit's all hard enough anyway so thank you\nfor saying those kind words but thank\nyou for always opening your heart with\nme opening your mind and I know this is\ngoing to help so many people who listen\nto it is there anything that I didn't\nask you that you wanted to Shar that we\nalways get right to it I sit in this\nchair and it's like we get right to it I\nthink we hit on so many points and I\njust hope anyone listening watching can\ntake something away from this I'm not\nperfect I've been through a lot still\nfiguring life out I don't think you ever\njust have it figured out and just be\nkind to yourself be patient with\nyourself love yourself it is so\nimportant and definitely one thing we\ntalked about is you know don't blame\nyourself you know we're all doing the\nbest we can with what have no you can\nhear that in your voice it's not even\ntoday it's not just about what you've\nsaid it's like you can hear that\ngenuiness and that sincerity in your\nvoice it's like I think it's really\ngoing to land with people so I hope\neveryone listens to this not once but\ntwice yeah same twice and everyone who's\nlistening and watching make sure that\nyou cut the I know you guys do a great\njob cutting stuff for Tik Tok yourself\nInstagram like cut the stuff that really\nresonated with you that connected with\nyou and share it with someone because\nI'm sure you've got friends who are\ngoing through breakups maybe they're\ngoing through a divorce maybe they're\nraising a kid on their own maybe you\nknow everything that L is going through\nthere are so many things that I know so\nmany of you are connected to in your\necosystems and your lives and I hope\nthat you'll clip the bits that stand out\nto you that connect to you and I hope\nyou'll share it with others because\nsometimes we just need to feel seen\nheard and understood and I think today a\nlot of people will feel seen heard and\nunderstood so thank you Jay thank you\nlove you appreciate thank you so much\nthank you pick up the phone I will I\npromise you have to will I mean it if\nyou love this episode you will also love\nmy interview with Kendall Jenner on\nsetting boundaries to increase happiness\nand healing your inner child you could\nbe reading something that someone is\nsaying about you and being like that is\nso unfair cuz that's not who I am and\nthat really gets to me sometimes but\nthen looking at myself in the mirror and\nbeing like but I know who I am why does\nanything else matter"
