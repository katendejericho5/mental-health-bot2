thank you thanks for that\nintroduction of course you had to live\nit all as I always tell my guests and\nand I love this you know the title of\nyour book just immediately captured my\nattention because I couldn't agree more\nthat every success story is underpinned\nby the messy truth and we often don't\nhear about the messy truth we often\ndon't see the messy truth sometimes we\ndon't even want to know about the messy\ntruth we'd rather believe in the facade\nor the beauty or the Perfection or the\nperfect image that we see and I'm really\nglad that you're sharing this so I have\nlots of things I want to ask you from\nthe book today I highly recommend\neveryone goes and buys the book\nespecially if you're on your\nentrepreneurial Journey maybe you want\nto be an entrepreneur you're thinking\nabout it and you're think how do I\nfigure out all of this stuff so so let's\nstart with this idea Ali that a lot of\nour audience a lot of our community\nwants to be entrepreneurs yeah they may\nalready be entrepreneurs some of them\nare struggling some of them are winning\nsome of them are still figuring out what\nthey're even going to do what is the\nmessy truth about starting that no one\ntells you about starting specifically\nwell you know I think that we live in a\ngeneration now where we are finally at\nthe point which wasn't the case when I\nwas starting out where it is accessible\nto get to hear what's really going on\nthere's so many panels and so many\nconferences where you know entrepreneurs\nare talking about more of the real stuff\nwhich I'm super grateful for like I said\n13 years ago when we started dry bar\nthat didn't exist like nobody was\ntalking about anything you know you\ndidn't have access to Founders or CEOs\nthe way you do now and it's such a\nbeautiful thing that there's podcasts\nlike this and there's places where\npeople who are thinking about starting a\nbusiness can go like I have a mastermind\nthat's launching next week where it's\nlike for R preneurs like there's so much\naccess out there now but you know I\nthink there is still understandably so\nit's like I mean everybody wants to look\ngood and everybody wants to like show\ntheir best side and for me it's like I\nI've always just been drawn to the like\nyou know the realness and maybe it's\nbecause I've always been a bit of an\nunderdog you know I mean starting from\nthe time I was like a kid my my older\nbrother Michael who's my business\npartner in Dry Bar you know he was like\nthe overachiever in our family like very\nyou know kind of more book smart and\njust you know was kind of either always\nin trouble or always doing something\nreally amazing there wasn't really a lot\nof in between and I was kind of a bit of\na Wallflower which if you know me now\nthat is not my personality at all but\nback then I was just kind of observing\nmy brother in trouble or doing something\ngreat I grew up in this with this like I\nwas just in the background and I think\nthat as as I've gotten older I have felt\nlike more wanting to you know talk about\nyou know my story and like how I was\nlike a like a bit of a I think I have a\nchapter in the book called like the\nunlikely entrepreneur something like\nthat I should probably know all the\nchapters in my book but but I I've\nalways considered myself like kind of\nthis Underdog and like not who you'd\nexpect to succeed and I think I guess I\nhave felt called to shine light on that\nbecause there are a lot of us out there\nyou know and I don't have a traditional\npath and I think that at one point it\nwas like there there was this societal\nlike you have to go to college you have\nto have a business degree if you want to\nstart a business and now you know\nthere's so many I've spoken at so many\ncolleges that have entrepreneurial\nprograms which I'm like I always get a\nchuckle out of because I'm like I didn't\neven go to college like do you want me\nto not mention that you know but I think\nit's just good to show that like you can\nfind success and have success no matter\nwho you are whether you went to college\ndidn't go to college like graduated high\nschool didn't graduate whatever you know\nso I've I've just felt really drawn to\nthat kind of like Underdog like the\nperson that you just wouldn't expect you\nknow to be successful and so I try to\nyou know highlight that and there's good\nthere too and there's a lot of things\nthat I am you know I am really good at\nbut showing like a peak behind the\ncurtain to people that it's not I me I\nthink any entrepreneur who's listening\nto this knows it's not easy of course\nit's not easy I feel like I just want to\ntalk about and highlight more of the\nhard stuff than just the good stuff you\nknow cuz it's it's completely a mixed\nbag it's not one or the other it's\nusually like one minute to one minute\nlike you're like oh this was amazing and\nthen you're like the whole thing's\nfalling apart you know I mean it's\nliterally like that crazy so my mission\nwith the book was like to highlight both\nlike it's really amazing and it's the\ngreatest journey and it's also\nincredibly hard and taxing and like you\ndon't realize how much it's going to\nchange your life and I don't I think\nit's good that you don't know that you\nknow I'm a little bit of like the\nignorance is bliss mentality because I\nfeel like the less you know about what\nyou're getting yourself into and I think\njust that whole mindset of like if you\ncan accept you don't know what you don't\nknow you go into things a little like\nnot as freaked out you know well in the\nbook you go into in detail give us a\nsnapshot for everyone who's listening of\nwhat your life looked like when you even\nthought about starting this because that\nwill give us a picture of this Underdog\nunlikely entrepreneur yeah I mean you\nknow I got married to my first husband\nwhen I was 26 I moved to New York City\nwhen I was 18 cuz I didn't want to go to\ncollege and I was like I'm going to move\nto New York City I feel like that will\nbe good college and that's what I did\nand I you know I jumped around from job\nto job and I would eventually go to\nbeauty school when in South Florida and\nthen I moved back to New York and and\nthen I got married and moved to LA and\nhad two babies and was like thought I'd\nlike hit the jackpot like I loved being\nable to be a stay-at-home mom I really\nfelt so blessed and lucky that I got to\nbe home with my boys and I was home for\nlike you know about 5 years before I\nstarted dry bar and that was such an\namazing time but I did get that itch to\nget back out there and start doing\nsomething for myself which was really\njust like a feeling that I had I mean I\nreally wanted to have kids and I really\nwanted to be a stay-at-home mom and part\nof me thought I'd get really involved in\nthe school and stuff like that and as I\nkind of approached that I was like no I\ndon't think I want to do that and not\nthere's no right or wrong right it just\nwasn't for me and I've always really\ntrusted my gut and my feeling and I and\nI I stay very close into what feels\nright and I and after staying home with\nmy kids it was about they were about two\nand four when I started dry bar and\nabout a year year before we started dry\nbar I got that kind of itch to do\nsomething and I started a mobile blowout\nbusiness which was again just like a way\nto get out of the house for a few hours\nget away from my kids who I loved love\nloved the whole thing but just wanted to\ndo something for myself and I knew\nhaving done hair for so many years that\nI could do that pretty easily I also you\nknow had this like intuition on that\nthat if I were to only charge $40 which\nwas like oh 220 super easy I'll come\nover while your baby sleeping that was\nit you know that maybe that would be\nfulfilling for me to get out of the\nhouse talk to adults I mean that's the\nother thing is like when you have two\nlittle kids and you go to the park all\nday and you're you're in like Kidville\nall day I just I wanted a little bit of\na break from that and not just from my\nhusband so I started this and it was so\nperfect at the time and I remember\ntelling people that like I remember it\nwas I mean it was 15 years ago but it\nfeels like yesterday cuz I was like oh\nit's great I love this like I'm getting\nout into the world it was a great way\nfor me to meet other women and I would\nit also informed a lot of the things\nthat we would eventually instill in dry\nbar like not doing someone's hair in\nfront of a mirror CU I was doing their\nhair in their living room and so it was\njust perfect at the time I wasn't really\nmaking any money but I didn't it I've\nnever been like driven by money so I was\nlike I'm just happy to do this I make a\nlittle extra cash I go and do this thing\nthat I really love doing I get to talk\nto these amazing women and it was kind\nof like wildfire I you know women would\ntell their friends and then the friend\ngroup and so it was just grow and grow\nwhich which is eventually why dry bar\ncame to be because I was getting so busy\noperating this mobile business by myself\nthat I was like I think I need to start\nhaving them come to me instead of me\ncome to them and that's really how dry\nbar was born but I was just this like\none woman show driving my Nissan extera\naround La with like a duffel bag full of\ntools and hairspray and you know it's\nfunny because it's like I remember it so\nwell I could could have never guessed it\nwould turn into the life that I have now\nI mean not in a million years I was just\nhappy to be out of the house for a\ncouple hours you know thank you for\nsharing that I know you probably had to\nshare that so many times but I wanted\nyou to because I just I mean to me I'm\nhoping that so many people are listening\nand watching going that's me Ally right\nlike I'm someone who like I I love my\nfamily but I I want to do something I\nhave this Instinct that I have something\ninside of me I don't know what it quite\nis yet or by the way I'm doing something\non the side and my friends tell each\nother that I'm good at it and I think I\ncould build something but I'm not sure\nlike what was it that made you feel this\nis real and it could be bigger versus\nactually this is great and it fulfills\nmy needs of getting out the house and\ngiving me a little bit of extra cash\nbecause what you could argue that\nalready felt like success tot and it can\nbe success for a lot of people what was\nit for you that said no this should be\nbigger I can be bigger and I want it to\nbe bigger yeah yeah well it's funny how\nand I'm sure you've experienced this too\nwhen you're doing something and it feels\nreally right and then there's like these\nRumblings and this like inner knowing of\nyou're like wait a second I might be on\nto something here and that's really how\nI started to feel because I realized I\nwas saying no more than I was saying yes\nand I was like you know scratching my\nhead going like I'm getting so many\ncalls and I was pretty good at what I\nwas doing and so I was like there's got\nto be something else here and and at the\ntime my kids were really little and\nmy mom who passed away eight years ago\nnow but she was we used to move her\neverywhere we moved like at an apartment\ndown the street and she loved being near\nmy kids and so that was really helpful\nand she was you know in our lives and I\nremember being like I I wonder what\nwould happen if if we had a location one\nlocation you know I'm like my mom could\nhelp I could get my kids after you know\npreschool like around three or 4 I think\nI could still make this work and and\nagain still thinking pretty small you\nknow that like let me just go from like\nthe next step from going to people homes\nto like opening a store and it and it\nwas so exciting you know and it was just\nlike I tell people this all the time\nthat you know if you're chasing the\nmoney like I mean maybe that works\nsometimes in my experience most\nbusinesses that I know of like it's like\nyou're chasing something that you love\nand I never I never thought about\nselling the business I never thought\nabout making a ton of money I was like I\nnever even thought about money we I mean\nfor years I didn't take much money as a\nsalary from dry bar I just love loved it\nyou know and I and and when you you know\nthis when you love your passion like the\nthing that you it's and you get to do it\nevery day you know it was like I just\nfelt like this is the coolest thing ever\nand I couldn't believe like you know we\nfirst opened dry bar and so many people\nwere coming and and and and you know\nagain it was like it just felt so meant\nto be because this mobile business that\nI had built and these women that I had\ncome to know in LA and some of them were\nlike I mean it's La you know it's like\nproducers and actors and celebrities and\nlike you know I was a little thrust into\nthat world and and you know beyond like\nthe celebrity just you know there was\njust so many women who were really\nconnected and when I started talking to\nmy clients which by the way were the\nfirst people I talked to about dry bar I\nwas like what do you think of this idea\nand they're like oh my God it's the best\nidea ever but how do you make it work\nand there was like certainly naysayers\nbut it was such a cool exciting\nopportunity and to have women like being\nlike you should totally do this yeah and\nwe opened that first a store and it was\nso busy and crazy and I and I just I\nloved every second of it you know I\ncouldn't get enough of it that's such a\nI I love that and I want to pull from it\nfor our listeners so something Ali said\nthat stands out to me is this idea of\nshe was taking baby steps it was just\nabout the next step it wasn't like I've\ncome across a million dollar idea 100 it\nwasn't like this crazy thought process\nit was like I do something it makes me\nhappy clients are happy let's get a\nstore and I think sometimes we kind of\ngo from well I have a really good idea\nor it should be a million dollar\nbusiness a billion dollar business\nbusiness or whatever it may be and we\ndon't get that next step right so that's\none thing I want to share the second\nthing that really stood out in what you\nsaid is you asked the people you were\nserving your\nclients for what they thought of the\nidea a lot of us ask our friends we ask\nour family we ask people around us who\ndon't actually know how skilled we are\nat this thing right and we're not asking\nthe people who are actually going to be\nour potential clients and so the fact\nthat you were asking them and they were\nsaying oh I'd turn up there oh I'd\nrecommend all my friends right wherein\nthat's a much better person to talk to\nwhen you're sharing a new idea what's\nthe difference Ali because you've talked\nabout now and in the book you talk about\nthis idea that you've always been pretty\ndecisive but more deeply when you go\ninto it and and I know you have a have a\nhave a deeper side to you and when\nyou're thinking about things like\nintention and intuition and Instinct and\nyou said I always knew like I was always\nlistening for that inner voice what is\nthe difference between intuition and\ndelusion if you had to think about how\nyou notice the difference what would\nthat be for you I think intuition is\nlike versus delusion because I feel like\nI'm well equated with both of them I\nmean that's good yeah because like\ndelusion is like something to me at\nleast how it lands for me is like\nsomething that's like you know a\ndelusional view back then of dry bar\nwould have been like we're going to grow\nthis thing to 150 locations and we're\ngoing to sell it for $255 million\nalthough I did say early on that I\nthought we would have but not early like\nin a year in I was like I think we're\ngoing to sell the business for 250\nmillion isn't that crazy I I mean I feel\nlike I manifested that I think it kind\nof goes back to what you're saying about\nbaby steps it's like is we're doing\nourselves a disservice of you know\nmoving in this like you know in a\ndelusional path I I think I would say\nyou know versus like staying close in\nand you know and I have gotten very into\nspirituality in the last few years and\none of my very best friends and and I\ntalk about her in the book her name is p\nPaige and I always say I'm writing her\nspiritual coales CU she's always in\nTalis and some Retreat and you know I'm\njust kind of like trying to pick it up\nof what she's doing and and she always\nsays to me stay close in you know and\nand you have to really think about that\nand like what that means and it's like\noh for me anyways it means like pay\nreally close attention and I've really\nstarted to think about that more and\nmore especially having had a you know\nrough couple months recently it's like\nhow does this make me feel in the moment\nand I don't think I ever could have\narticulated that the way I can now and I\nthink we get older we're wiser we go\nthrough more things we read more books\nwe do all the things I meditate a lot\nmore now I do all that stuff now and and\nI pay really close attention I don't\nthink I did the way I do now back then\nbut I think I had it instinctually in me\nI just didn't know how to like pick up\non it you know where it's like now I can\nI can almost like I can read something\nor have a thought and like immediately\nget a ping in my body of like no this\ndoesn't not feel good or get like oh\nyeah this feels really good it's\nfascinating and and and the thing is and\nI'm sure you being who you are would\nagree with this it's like if you get\nreally quiet and you pay attention to\nthat stuff it's pretty clear you know I\nhave definitely been known to purposely\nignore red flags in situations which\nhave gotten me into some bad situations\nand it's it's really funny the awareness\nthat we get as we get older and wiser\nand we make some mistakes and we learn\nfrom them and so I I guess you know\ndelusion is like I think delusion is\nmaybe ignoring red flags you know it's\nlike no no it's going to be fine besides\nthe fact that like you know it's not but\nyou're going to it's like what what are\nyou doing why are you not listening I\nheard something um bade Brown said I'm\nsure she's been on the show she has not\nshe oh you have to have her on she's\namazing and she was really there for me\nin my first divorce which is crazy but\nshe um I just saw something recently\nwhere she was like every every once in a\nwhile the universe Taps you or not every\nonce in a while when you get to Mid AG\nthe universe like Taps you on the\nshoulder is like you can't run anymore\nand I was like is she talking to me you\nknow and it but it was it's a\nfascinating thing cuz I think at some\npoint in our lives and it seems to me\nlike it's more midlife you get that tap\nand you're like yeah I got to I got to\nbe really like I got to pay attention to\nwhat's happening like I you just you\njust can't get away with it anymore you\nknow and I think as we're when we're\nyounger we can I don't know why that is\nand I think maybe we're just ignoring\nthe red flags and thinking it can just\nall work out and I'm such a like it all\nworks out kind of gal anyways which I\nthink is true and now I'm I've come to\nrealize that those mistakes and those\nred flags and the things that we don't\npay attention to when we should actually\nare really great gifts not in the moment\nin the moment you're like why is this\nhappening to me but then afterwards\nyou're like oh I needed to learn this\nyou know again my friend Paige always\nsays it's the medicine you know she's\nlike this is the medicine that you need\nI'm like it's always about the medicine\nyou know but it's really true yeah\nabsolutely thank you for thank you for\ndoing that thought experiment with me\nintuition and delusion I really loved\nyour take on it I love your take on it I\nwant to pick out some moments from your\nbook because I love some of the quotes\nin your book and things that stuck with\nme and so I'm going to start with this\nbecause it really you know enhances the\nconversation we're having right now\nabout your work and you says this is\npage eight though entrepreneurs today\nface different challenges more noise\nmore competition Etc it still always\nstarts with you your idea your skill set\nyour purpose and your gut instinct and\nyou say what is the thing that you just\ncan't stop thinking about which which I\nlove that I love that language to it but\nyou talk a lot about this finding your\nskill set as an\nentrepreneur and I think there could be\nnothing more true about than that like\nI'm I'm so aligned with you and I think\noften we're doing things we're\npassionate about that we're not skilled\nat or if we are passionate we haven't\nthought that we need to be skilled at it\nand OB obviously you could be doing the\nopposite where you're doing something\nskiled out that you're not passionate\nabout sure and that's what a job is\npretty much but how do people discover\nwhat they're skilled at because what I\nfound is that most of us when we're\nskilled at something we devalue it as a\nskill because it's so easy to us and we\nsee someone else with another skill and\nyou talk about this a lot in the book\nabout don't become someone else's story\ndon't chase another entrepreneur don't\ntry and imitate but we look at someone\nso for example people would look at me\nbe like oh Jay like you're really good\nat XYZ but then if I'm not aware of that\nskill set I'll be like no no no but\nyou're really good at ABC and then we\nplay this kind of tag of like no I don't\nhave your skills but we rarely sit and\ngo no I'm actually really good at that\nI'm because we devalue what we find easy\nyeah that's so true right I think it was\nreally highlighted in in my business\nwith my my brother and my first husband\ncam who cam was the creative genius\nbehind dry bar and my brother was like\nmore the behind thescene business side\nof it and I was like you know the hair\nstylist and like the experience and\neverybody always ask us like is it\nreally hard to work with your brother\nand now ex-husband and that's not why we\ngot divorced and whatever but I was like\nno it was great because we were all very\nclear on what we did and what we did\nwell and what our highest and best use\nwas I had that conversation so many\ntimes I still I still go back to that\nwhat's my highest and best use always in\nlife because I think it's like really\nlike think about it you know and we had\nreally almost no conflict and if we ever\nI mean we all talked about all things\ntogether but if there was ever like a\nquestionable thing it whoever would\ndecide was like whose Lane that was you\nknow and that was we were all very okay\nwith that and I think when you do run\ninto problems with business partners\nit's often because you guys think you\nhave the same skill set and then that's\nsuch a it's like 5-year-olds playing\nsoccer everybody's kicking the ball it\ndoesn't work you know so I feel like it\nis it's it's like the old cliche like it\ndoesn't feel like work if you're doing\nsomething love which I know has been\nsaid 8 million times but like it is so\ntrue and and and I think it's like\nalmost feels too easy to your point so\npeople are like well I've got to\nchallenge myself and of course like you\ndo and you want to keep challenging\nyourself but like what a gift in life to\nlike be able to do what you love to do\nand I think I think there's this\nmisconception that like you shouldn't do\nthat you know it's like you know for me\nlike when I told my parents I wanted to\ngo to beauty school they were like\nreally are you sure you know and like\nvery like looked their nose down on it\nlike you want to be a hair stylist and\nthey also had I grew up in South Florida\nand my parents had were entrepreneurs\nwhich definitely informed a lot of my or\nwho I became but they had this like old\nlady clothing store and it was right\nnext to this like old lady hair salon\nand they were and I think in their mind\nthey were like you want to work there\nand I was like no I'm going to move to\nNew York City I'm going to do editorial\nand like fashion shows and I had these\nlike Grand ideas I didn't have dry bar\nat the time you know but it was like\nthat's what I loved like I grew up in\nSouth Florida I have naturally curly\nhair my hair was just massive and frizzy\nall the time and I was just fascinated\nby hair I loved hair just just what I\nloved you know and so it took me a lot\nit would take me many years to finally\nlike get the courage to say like when my\nfriends were going to college and they\nwere studying whatever and I was always\nlike how do you guys know what you want\nto do very confused by that whole notion\nof college and majors and all that and I\njust loved hair and that was the thing\nthat I really loved and it would you\nknow I talk about it in the book that it\ntook me a while to to figure out again\ncomes back to like being close in like I\nalways loved hair I would spend hours in\nthe bathroom in high school and I was\njust so I worked at a hair salon as a\nreceptionist when I was in high school\nbecause I wanted to get free blowouts\nand because I loved being around hair\nstylist and I was like this is the thing\nthat I love and I ignored it for so many\nyears you know and it's like to be able\nto tap into that thing and and you can't\nfind a person there's nobody you can\nmeet and say what do you really love to\ndo and they may not tell you because\nthey're embarrassed or they don't do it\nas a job because they like my parents\nwon't approve my husband won't approve\nwhoever won't think it's a good idea my\nparents did not think it was a good idea\nto go to beauty school but I had enough\nlike hootspa to be like I hear you but\nit's what I want to do you know and I\nhad no idea I was going to turn into\nlike this beautiful life that it did for\nme but I was just like stay really\nfocused and and I talk about that a lot\nto entrepreneurs that I'm mentoring it's\nlike don't you know shut all that out\nyou know listen to what really feels\nlike is is good for you not what\neverybody else around you wants you know\nyeah it's almost like that question that\ncome from what you're saying is what's\nthat voice you're ignoring on the inside\nor what's that idea that you keep kind\nof putting away because you're like\nthat's ridiculous oh that's stupid or\nand you've heard that voice before where\nsomeone looked at you weird because you\nactually shared your intention or your\nexcitement and everyone looked at you\nlike that's not real get over it and by\nthe way people did that at dry bar\nbecause I mean like I said it was in it\nwas in the middle of a recession and\npeople were like how do you make this\nconcept work it's like you know we were\nstarting at $35 a blowout and it was\nlike you have to do a lot of blowouts to\nmake that business work and I was like\nyeah you know but I think we can do it\nand I didn't like I literally not not\ngreat at math but I was like I think if\nwe can do like you know 10 blowouts an\nhour and we're open you know 10 hours to\nlike I think it'll work you know and I\nremember my brother started like putting\nan actual spreadsheet together and\nrunning the numbers it was like yeah if\nwe do 30 or 40 blowouts a day we'll have\na nice business you know and of course\nwe we never did that little we always\ndid like 70 80 100 blowouts which was\njust bananas but it was like people were\nthe ones who put it in my head that like\nmaybe maybe this idea doesn't work I\nmean so many people and then we started\nraising money and you know that's a\nwhole other conversation of like raising\nmoney with like walking into these rooms\nwith men in suits who like did not\nunderstand the concept of dry bar and\nwere like what you know like how does\nthis work and just didn't believe in it\nso many people didn't believe in it and\nand it did seem like a\ntough you know how do you make this work\nlike on a large scale is there enough\nwomen who want to do this is the price\nthe price points really low like margins\nare really thin how does it work and you\nknow and I just I'm like I'm just\ntelling you I really you know from a gut\nlevel know that this is going to work\nand then you're like oh this better\nwork you know but it it did and and and\nI always felt like there was money on\nthe line for sure and that's not a small\nthing but you know I remember when I\nstarted cutting hair and I mean when\nyou're starting to cut hair and you have\nreally sharp scissors in your hand it is\nvery scary and like and you know what's\nso funny is like the very first hair I\nwould never trust myself scissors in my\nhand with my own hair or anyone else's\nhair wor even my wife says will you I'm\nlike nope I'm not going anywhere near\nthat well the first haircut I ever did\nin Beauty School I cut someone's ear and\nI felt like I was going to die and the\nears bleed so much and I thought I when\nyou say cut someone's ear how much just\nlike a just a little nip on I mean it\nwas it was I remember it was so\ntraumatizing I'm sure for them but for\nme and also in Beauty School you're\ndoing like $2 haircuts and it's where\nyou're learning you know I still have\nlike nightmares about that because it\nwas like the worst thing that could\nhappen but beside that weird story which\nI don't think I've ever talked to\nanybody about um I it was very\ntraumatizing for me but I always felt\nlike at the end of the day when I was on\nthe floor cutting and when I was doing\nall that and you know and then we were\nstarting dry bar I was like no one's\ngoing to die if this business doesn't\nwork like which is like the worst\npossible outcome it's like we're not\ndoing surgery we're not we don't you\nknow and and I and I always like found\ncomfort in that cuz I was like you know\nthere's always the chance that we're\ngoing to lose money in my case it was\ngoing to really be my brother's money\nand my you know my my husband at the\ntime and I put in our life savings which\nwasn't really that much but a lot to us\nat the time and you know it's was like\nit's going to really suck and we're\ngoing to lose money but we're like we're\nreally smart capable people and if this\nidea doesn't work like we'll figure\nsomething else out and I think that that\nmindset of like it you got to just like\nput it on the line is like is really why\nI think I've been successful it's like\nnot holding anything too tightly of like\nyeah I really hope this works and I\nreally think this is going to work but\nif it doesn't like we're all going to be\nokay you know and I think that's like\nyou know I think a lot a lot of\nentrepreneurs I talk to are like I have\nto have this much money saved and I have\nto do this and I have to do this and I\nhave to I was like yeah prepare for sure\nbut like at some point you're going to\nhave to just jump you know and hope for\nthe best yeah there is a moment for that\nleap yeah I want to dive into a couple\nof things here that you've mentioned\nthat I think really stood out and you\ntalk about this and we were talking\nabout this a bit offline it was this\nidea of page 13 you say if you feel like\nan impostor embrace it yeah and I feel\nlike imposter Syndrome has been\nsomething that a lot of people are\ntalking about yeah I think it's\nsomething that there are even more\npeople that are feeling than are talking\nabout it and it seems to be a recurring\nfeeling whenever you're in a new room or\na new league or a new Zone\nwhen you say embrace it what does that\nmean well I think to your point of\npeople talking about it a lot they talk\nabout it like it's a bad thing and I\nthink I think of it as a good thing if\nyou're embarking on a position in a new\njob or you're starting a company or\nwhatever you're doing that's new to you\nlike that's amazing like you're starting\nsomething new you're you're taking that\nleap of faith you're you know putting\nyourself in a situation that you've not\nbeen in and that's really scary for sure\nbut it's Al really exciting and\nexhilarating and it means you're growing\nand you're in this next new phase in\nyour life and so this this negative\nassociation with impostor syndrome as if\nit's like a bad thing it has definitely\nhappened to me and I think maybe because\nI never had any real formal training in\nanything other than hair where I would\nstart a job and I was like I know I'm\nunderqualified for this job but I'm\ngoing to like figure it out and I and I\nwould you know and I guess that was part\nof it like yes I am an impostor\ntechnically I don't know how to do this\njob but you better believe I'm going to\nfigure it out and do it well and it's no\ndifferent with entrepreneurship I mean\nwhen we started dry bar I had never like\nbeen in charge of that many people I'd\nnever managed a a salon like i' never my\nparents didn't and I watch them and I\nworked for owners of hair salons and\nI've been a stylist for years like I had\na lot of the things that I think I\nneeded to had but I had never actually\ndone it and so I was learning it as I\nwent which was scary but also amazing\nand I also think when you come in again\nnothing I could have articulated them\nbut\na term I think we're hearing more and\nmore now is this like beginners mindset\nyou know and I had that when I was when\nwe were starting dry bar because I was\nquite literally a beginner and running a\nbusiness and I made a lot of mistakes\nand I had to figure out a lot of things\nand that's that's also the beauty of\nThis Book Is that I feel like I got an\neducation in this I learn I got like an\nyou know a business degree while I was\nrunning a business because I was having\nto figure all these things out and I\nmade tons of wrong decisions and bad\nchoices you know I also think I felt\nit's not necessarily impostor syndrome\nbut I think I felt this like immense\npressure because I was the boss like I\nhad to know all the answers and I had to\nlike if you came to me and asked me a\nquestion about the business I'd be like\nwell here's what I think even though it\nwasn't always right it was just like me\nhaving and I I used to think that that\nwas like oh you're just the boss and you\njust you the buck stops with you and you\nhave to and now I feel like and and how\nI how I approach the that question now\nis like well what do you think which is\nnot something I would have said that's\nlike I think that was all ego cuz I was\nlike oh I feel this pressure like I'm\nsupposed to know the answer because I'm\nsitting where I'm sitting in this\ncompany and now I'm like well what do\nyou think about that and then people are\nlike what you know and I'm like well I\ndon't I actually don't know the answer\nbut I'd love to hear what what you think\nbut I I didn't have enough like you know\nI was I was too focused on like feeling\nlike I had to be and maybe that does go\nback to imposter syndrome I had I felt\nlike I needed to know all the answers\nbecause I was the boss and this was my\ncompany and blah blah blah where now I'm\nlike there's so much much freedom and\nsaying I don't know you know like let's\ntalk about it and then and then the\nculture that you create in a company\nwhen you're like the kind of Boss that's\nlike not to know at all and people\naren't afraid to be like hey Jay you\nknow I actually think that if we tried\nthis this and that like when I'm sure\npeople do that in your company like I'm\nwhen someone comes up to you and they're\nlike I actually think if we tried blah\nblah blah and your response is like no\nyou know they're they're never coming to\nyou with something again but if your\nresponse is like oh it's interesting you\nknow you may not always take it but that\nbeginner that feels to me like a\nbeginner's mindset of like I'm open to\nother ways of and and I think that\nthere's a part of I know there's a part\nof me that gets a little like you know\nand it's also like I I feel like I know\nbest and we go into our our ego of like\nno but I know what I'm doing how but but\nembracing what somebody else is bringing\nto you I think is really powerful and\nthat's something that took me a long\ntime to get comfortable with yeah\nthere's there's something that you\nreminded me on you talk about this on\npage 52 you're saying being open to\nfeedback personal professional is a\npractice a learned intention to stop\ntaking the information maybe go on a\nwalk take some deep breaths and come\nback open to hearing what someone else\nis feeling and I wanted to ask you\nwhat's been the best or most memorable\npiece of feedback that you gained on\nyour professional Journey that's kind of\nstuck with you where maybe even in the\nmoment it was so painful to hear yeah\nbut you now look back and go I I believe\nthat well I think thinking of feedback\nas a gift\nwhich I I learned pretty early on and I\nremember you know somebody in our\ncompany who said it I heard her say it\nonce and I was like wow that's so\nprofound because if you can be open to\nwhat someone is telling you which is so\nhard and it is painful and and you know\nI remember my brother saying to me once\nlike people are scared of you and I was\nlike what you know just no awareness on\nmy part like I was like what are you\ntalking about you what are you talking\nabout what do you mean people are scared\nof me like and he was like well because\nyou\nknow yeah a joke\num you know I was but but in the moment\nI really was taken back by it and I was\nlike I'm so nice what do you mean and he\nwas like well you know you walk in the\nstores and you lose your mind and I was\nlike I do that because I'm so passionate\nyou know and I was covering it up with\nlike I'm so passionate and I want things\nto be perfect and and I did but I I\nwould learn over time that that walking\nin and like you know I would I would you\ncould see it all over my face cuz I was\nlike why are the floorboards dirty why\nis the music not up why did this person\nnot get greeted that way well I mean\njust for me it was like you know it was\nlike sensory overload of everything that\nwas wrong which I think is a blessing\nand a curse because you're like well I\nam the person this is my baby like I am\nthe person who has to be the one that's\nlike this is not working and and we need\nto fix this but I also would learn that\ni i people were excited when I would\ncome in the store and they wanted to\ntell me the good things and I did start\nto perpetuate this reputation of like\nAllie's coming watch out and you know\npart of me was like I think maybe that's\na good thing but then I was like No it's\nit's not and and I would learn\neventually to you know like I would take\nnotes and I would then like you know not\nlike ruin everybody's day when I would\ncome in the store you know and I had to\nlearn that the hard way but it really\ndid take my brother probably one of the\nonly few people in our company who felt\ncomfortable enough to say to me CU he\nwasn't scared of me you know he'd be\nlike people were scared of you and I\nagain at first I was very defensive and\nI told him he was wrong and you know it\nwas also my big brother but it really\nlike sunk in and I was like man I don't\nwant that I don't want people to be\nscared of me I want people to be able to\ntalk to me I don't want people to feel\nlike they have to protect me either\nwhich was also another thing that drove\nme crazy and still does to this day like\nI don't you know I'm sure you agree with\nthis it's like you don't want to be\nsurrounded by yes people like please no\ntell me tell me the truth tell me what\npeople are saying I want to know what\npeople are thinking if I if I can't\nascertain that I'm my own you know so if\nyou have people around you who are\nwilling to give you like the feedback\nit's like you're only going to be better\nfor it you know it it stings in the\nmoment and it still does like you know\nsometimes someone will tell me something\nand I'll be like oh gosh like I can't\nbelieve that and then if you're open to\nit and then you you then now you have\nthe awareness about it and and I'll tell\nyou I'm like I don't think you have\nchildren right no you know for me I have\na 16 and 18-year-old two boys and like\ntalk about honesty I mean I'm really\nreally close to my kids but they will\ntell me things like that are very hard\nhere and it it it is a real practice and\nmental exercise for me to not you know\nand my kids used to say to me like cuz\nI've cuz during the dry bar Er When I\nWas I guess a little scary you my my\nkids would even say to me like we don't\nknow what version you're going of you\nwere going to get which is like oh yeah\nand I was like but I know that now and\nnow like the power is in my control like\nI can be like okay and and it literally\njust happened I was with my son is at\nDennison in University in Ohio he's\nplaying football and we went out to see\nhim and this you know he he like came\noff the field you know he was like he\ndidn't really want to talk about some of\nthe stuff that we want to talk about and\nmy younger son said to me like just give\nhim a minute mom and I was like what\nhe's like just give him a minute and I\nwas like oh right you know cuz as a mom\nand anybody listening to this who's a\nmom you're like when your kid isn't like\nperfect and happy you're like what's\nwrong what's wrong what's wrong how can\nI fix it what can I do you know we get\nwe go into that like Mama Bear\nprotective mode and my younger son\nlooked at me and he's like Mom give him\na minute and I I did get defensive with\nhim for a second and I was like what are\nyou talking about you know and he's like\nyou know and I was like you're right you\nknow and I was like okay and I thanked\nhim you know and I backed up and I was\nlike when he's ready to talk to me about\nit he'll talk to me about it and sure\nenough he did a couple hours later we\ntalk he opened up and it was like such a\ngreat lesson and reminder of like\nsometimes you know you need to give\npeople space and you can't just have\nwhat you want when you want it and and\nthat's been a really hard lesson for me\nand I think it's also like being at the\nat the helm of a company and and having\nthis like mentality of like I can do and\nsay whatever I want because I'm the boss\nand blah blah you can just do whatever\nthat bleeds over into your real life\nwhich you know my kids are kind of a\nliving example of that of like you know\nand I used to say things to my kids like\nI've been around longer than you guys\nand I just know and they're like you\ndon't always know Mom you know and it's\nlike you know so your kids are like talk\nabout mirrors you know and and they've\nthey've all of that awareness I think\nhas been such a gift to me and and that\nyou can get that anywhere in your life\nfrom your best friend from your spouse\nfrom someone who works for you or with\nyou it's like if you ask genuinely\nthey're going to tell you and like what\na gift to like get that awareness you\nknow and it does Sting for a second and\nthen you're like oh okay I'm going to\ntake that and be better my best friend\ntells me stuff too you know it's like oh\nthank you you know yeah yeah it requires\nthat beginner's mindset that humility to\naccept it and receive it I know I know\nmy wife does it with me all the time and\nit's so much easier to defend yourself\nto mask yourself to Shield yourself in a\nfalse sense yeah and what you don't\nrealize is every time you pretend to\nShield yourself from good feedback\nyou're just setting yourself up for more\ndownfalls and it happens again and again\nand the ego is so well equipped to keep\ndrawing The Sword and gosh it's crazy is\nit cutting down everything in its way\nand it's perfect at it because that's\nits job yeah but it's not protection\nit's actually your resilience is Getting\nThinner and thinner and thinner and\nyou're getting weaker and weaker and\nweaker I wanted to ask you because\nyou're shifting into that you know that\nI love how honest you were about the\nkind of feedback you get from kids I\nthink people often talk about oh you\nknow my kid said I'm not cool anymore I\nkid whatever that kind of stuff and like\nthat doesn't sting but hearing this kind\nof stuff do you think it's because you\nyou definitely have a take on this in\nyour book like do you think it's\npossible to be really materially\nsuccessful and have a happy marriage\nlike are those two things possible my my\nfirst marriage which was like 16 years\ndidn't didn't work not because of the\nbusiness and I think that it's like I I\njoke a lot that like people are like you\nknow it must been hard to work with your\nhusband I was like yeah we got divorced\nyou know but that's not really you know\nit's a joke um which of course is like a\ndeflection but but more true was that\nlike we probably never should have\ngotten married in the first place like I\nwe met when we were 26 and I'm pretty\nsure I put this in the book that he\ntried to call the wedding off a month\nbefore the wedding and I was like oh no\nwe are not doing that like and he had\nsome real good reasons for that like you\nknow the relationship was really hot and\nheavy in the beginning it had faded\nquite a bit like the intim y wasn't\nreally there but we were best friends\nand and I would later learn that like my\nparents had that marriage which they\nended up getting divorced too and I I\nthink I definitely emulated my parents\nmarriage which is just wild when you\nread all that about how we do that\nbecause I didn't see it at all but you\nknow we we had kids very quickly which I\nreally wanted I was very like I'm very\ndriven and I was like I want children\nand so we had kids a year after we got\nmarried and then you know like I said we\nstarted the business dyar when my kids\nwere three and five so it was like boom\nboom boom and dry Barb felt like a third\nbaby and then you know cam was doing all\nthe creative and I was doing all the\nother stuff and so you know we're on\nthis path and and I knew all along and\nso did he even though we didn't want to\nadmit it that like this wasn't like this\ncan't be it this can't be like what it's\nsupposed to be but you know we didn't\nwant to like disrupt our lives and we\nyou know it's just like it's a lot to\nget divorced and I didn't want to be a\ndivorced person and I liked the facade\nthat I had Le two really cute boys with\ngreat hair and this amazing husband and\nhe was like the you know the brainchild\nof the creative of dry bar which was\namazing I was like I loved the way the\npackage looked but I knew it wasn't\nright you know the material success I\ndidn't I didn't want to shatter the\nwhole image you know and and obviously\nlike I've you know come to realize that\nlike you just you have to and that's the\nmessy truth of it all and and then it\nwas then I I made the really hard\ndecision to end the marriage and then my\nson who's now 18 and doing really well\nat Dennis and he went into rehab because\nhe started doing drugs and there's a\nwhole chapter about that and just my\nlife completely unraveled you know and\nand and to your question it was like I\non this hand I had all this success and\nI was like doing all this cool stuff and\nlike anybody who didn't know me I was\nlike I I was a guest on Shark Tank like\ncoolest thing ever I was like on Inc\nmagazine the cover I mean it just like\nall these really cool things were\nhappening and you look at my life like\nwow what a cool life she's got and and\nshe then all this success and I was\nbeing being you know praised and it was\ngreat but then my life was falling apart\nyou know and and so no I didn't I wasn't\nable to like hold both and then I come\nout of you grant after about two years\nlike it really worked all the treatment\nwe put grant through and he he really\ncame out on top and he really did the\nwork and he's such a I mean he ended up\nin a couple different programs one of\nthem was an outdoor Wilderness Program\nin Utah which I actually think every\nhuman should probably have to go through\nwe went to visit him once and he was\nlike making fire of like you know two\nsticks and he was like learned how to I\nmean the thing it was amazing and I was\nlike this is really profound and and he\nreally came out such a better person on\nthe other side and and it also brought\nme and my ex together because we had to\nlike do group family group therapy and\nfamily th and all the things and and it\nit was also one of those things that I I\nactually thought might kill me because\nit was so painful but it actually was a\nblessing and disguise I mean the the\ninside and the person that Grant turned\ninto and the other side of that is just\nremarkable and it brought me and my ex\nback together as friends and like we\nlearned how to co-parent because of all\nthat and even my younger son really been\nI mean it was all like such an amazing\nblessing at the time I wouldn't have\never me asked for that you know and so\nit was like the the both and and the\nodds and the DU duality of what what I\nwas living and then I came out of that\nsituation you know and rushed back into\nanother relationship that was like now\nI'm now I'm looking for like real love\nbecause I didn't feel like had it the\nway I wanted it in my first marriage\nthen I jump into that you know and at\nthat time we were like you know it was\nright before that I met him like 5\nmonths before the pandemic and I was\nalready kind of like transitioning out\nof dry bar in a lot of ways because the\ncompany was so big we had so many people\nrunning it now and what I was doing on a\nday-to-day basis wasn't really there\nanymore and and now I was like you know\njust looking for love and like and then\nI found it and I was like oh I think\nthis is what it's supposed to be and and\nI was you know madly in love with this\nman and I wasn't paying attention to\nanything else you know and to any of the\nred flags that were there that I now\nreally see were there and so I again to\nyour question which is such a good one\nlike I I couldn't hold both you know it\nwas like I now I was like stepping away\nfrom dry bar and now I was stepping into\njust love and I lost completely lost\nmyself on that side you know it was like\nI lost myself in the dry bar world and\nput my love life and even my kids a\nlittle bit on hold and now I was in the\nother side of it where I'm madly in love\nand I lost the the other side of my own\npersonal purpose you know and I kind of\nmesed into his world and I was like oh\nmy God and now as you know we're we're\ngoing through a divorce and I could\nnever have imagined that would happen\nbut on the on the other side of it I'm\nlike oh yeah you know it's like what I\nhaven't learned yet which I'm hoping I\nget now is that you know I have to keep\nmyself intact like what do I love and\nwhat do I want to be doing and can I\nlove somebody else while I'm in that\nplace cuz I would throw everything else\nout the window it's like when I was\nbuilding dry bar it was like only dry\nbar when I was like falling in love with\nthis new man it was only him and I lost\nmyself and like he was building a\nbusiness and he was really busy and he\nhad little kids and whatever and so I\nthrew myself into his world and like\nkind of forgot about myself and even now\nand it hasn't been that long but I'm\nlike coming back into my own and I'm\nlike this book and all these projects\nand I'm like oh I'm getting back to\nmyself and I would like to have love too\nbut like also you know and I've so it's\nsuch a good question I love that you\nasked it because I I haven't been able\nto find it yet and I get it now and now\nI'm like anxious to like try it out you\nknow and be like can I be in love madly\nin love have the right kind of love with\na person and myself and what I'm doing I\nhaven't been able to figure that out yet\nand I think you know I think a lot of us\nit falls one of those things inevitably\nFall by the I guess I don't know I don't\nknow how other people's lives are like\nyou know I I just you know it's funny I\nwas we were talking to a couple recently\nand they were the the wife said\nsomething like you know our marriage is\ngood enough and I was like o you know\nand she said it in front of her husband\nand the husband was like you know and I\nwas like oh there's definitely some\nstuff to on back over there but it is\ninteresting and it's like how do you do\nthat I mean I don't know if you guys\nhave fig\nno I mean I I don't the first thing is\nthe challenging thing about any\nrelationship whether it's business or\nmarriage is that there's two minds and\nas we know our mind is always changing\nand growing and evolving now imagine\nthat times two are they changing at the\nsame time in the same way yeah no are\nthey having the same thought at the same\ntime every day no do they have the same\ndreams and aspirations every day no and\nso we should be more more surprised when\npeople get together and stay together\nthan when people separate and move apart\nit's actually remarkable that anyone\ncould spend their life with another\nperson for a long amount of time than it\nis that people find it hard to stay with\npeople I mean that statement in it of\nitself makes me feel so good because\nit's like I've had this shame i' I\ndidn't want to be divorced once and now\nI'm heading into divorce twice and I've\nreally I think a lot of my sadness and\ngrief when this first happened was\nbecause I was like embarrassed and I was\nlike course get I what like this second\nmarriage I'm getting divorced again like\nholy you know and just all the\nshame what's wrong with me but it's such\nwhich is why I really love and I hope\npeople who are listening to that like\nfeel that too because and I I was\ntelling you before like I and a lot of\npeople who now reach out to me and\nthey're like I'm really unhappy in my\nmarriage should I leave my husband I'm\nlike I don't know don't ask me but like\nit's a good thing to ask yourself you\nknow and and I do think you're right\nit's like we grow and change and you\nknow and in my case I don't think we\nwere having the right conversations\nenough of like and we ignored a lot of\nthings and granted it was like a really\nweird time and our relationship got very\nFastTrack because of Co and like we\nmoved in together after five months I\ndon't know that we would have done that\nhad Co not thrust this like very crazy\nchange into all of our lives and you\nknow I think it all happened the way it\nwas supposed to but it is a like yeah\nwe're always growing and changing and do\nyou do that together there's two kind of\nthought experiments that I think can\nhelp people with what we're talking\nabout not as Solutions but as and it's\nwhat you just said if you're not having\nthe right conversations with yourself\nand if you're not having the right\nconversations with that person yeah\neverything's going to feel like a\nsurprise and everything is going to kind\nof be a random event yeah and all you\ncan do you can't make someone stay with\nyou and you can't make something work\nall you can actually do is track whether\nyou're getting closer or moving further\napart that's actually all you can do is\ntrack and monitor because like I said so\nmuch is changing all the time and so all\nyou can do is track change you you can't\nforce a result or a direction you can\nonly track change and try and move\ncloser together or move apart and it's\nwhat you said like I think when we think\nabout the word balance if you think\nabout it we all have a finite number of\nhours we have a finite number of\nresources and we have a finite number of\namount of energy so if you had 100% And\nyou said you've got yourself you got\nyour partner you got your work you got\nyour kids and then you got your family\nand you put 20% into each of those now\nyou're going to get a 20% result on each\nof those that's a balanced life if we\nlook at it in that way so if it doesn't\nwork or or it may work for someone but\nthe idea them being okay well now you\ngot like a 80% return on your career\nwhich means 80% of your energy was going\ninto the work part which means then 5%\nwas going to all the others you've got a\nhuge 80% that was me in the Dy bar era\nyeah right and and and so when we look\nat that we just go well how can any\nhuman ever achieve right Perfection any\nhuman including me including everyone\nwe're so everyone is so limited that our\nability to make everything and everyone\nhappy and successful is mathematically\nimpossible so if it's mathematically\nimpossible let's stop pretending that\nwe're able to nail every part of every\nlife and let's be honest and say I'm\nfocusing on this in this era or this\nphase or this month or this year that\nnaturally means I can't focus on these\nthree areas and I think people who stay\ntogether or adapt or whatever in a\nhealthy way are people who found a way\nof saying I understand what you're\nfocusing on and I get that and I respect\nit but guess what when you're back and\nyou have time I may be focusing on\nsomething else and so I think anyone\nwho's navigating their relationship in a\nhealthier way there's no better or worse\nbut in a way that we would consider\nhealthier is only because two people are\ncommunicating as you said enough where\nthey're just having conversations it\ndoesn't mean there's a perfect standard\nor there's complete intimacy at all\ntimes or they're having the best you\nknow sex or relationships at all times\nwhile everything else is going on like\nmathematically impossible yeah it's so\ninteresting too because I think you\ndon't want you're avoiding dealing with\nsomething that you know is there it's\nlike you said you're not always going to\nbe on the same page you're not going to\nyou're going to grow differently and\nwhatever and it's like you know in our\ncase it was like we weren't you have to\nagain not I don't mean to be like a\nbroken record but going back to like\nyour inner that inner voice of like for\nyou know for me I knew there were things\nthat weren't right and I think now and\nyou know I work with therapists and\ncoach and I have lots of people you know\nCU I love getting is I love getting as\nmuch I mean now I'm like I love the\nfeedback give me all the the feedback\nlike I really want to hear as many\nperspectives as I can and from people\nthat like I really trust and admire and\nyou know one of the things that I was\ntalking to my coach about recently was\nlike cuz I've I've been trying to like\nput a bow on this to like make myself\nfeel better about it not working and\nI've come to realize like if well I'm\nlike if we had had the conversation that\nwe weren't having you know the right I\nmean you're shaking your head because\nyou know what I'm going to say what if\nwe had talked about the thing maybe it\nwould have worked maybe it wouldn't have\nworked like obviously nobody nobody\nknows you know and and and he and I had\nthat conversation in in the aftermath of\nall of this like had we called out you\nknow one of the big things that wasn't\nworking for us early on that we both did\nnot want to call out because it would\nhave potentially probably meant the the\nend of the relationship and we didn't\nwant that you know we were very like\nwrapped up in like the excitement and\nthe newness and the lust and the\nchemistry and the passion and all the\nthings that happen when your brain I\nmean I'm sure I'm sure there's some\nscience on like what happens to your\nbrain all in my book yeah\nyeah but you know and so we weren't we\ndidn't have those conversations and\nperhaps had we had it maybe it would\nhave shifted and we could have figured\nsomething out that would have changed\nthe trajectory of our relationship and\nit maybe it had worked and maybe it\nwouldn't have but we didn't even have\nthe conversation you know and that and\nthat's the thing it's like you have to\nhave those honest conversations in work\nin business you know in business in your\npersonal life and if you're avoiding\nthem it's going to come back around like\nyou can be sure of that you know yeah I\nalways say there are like there are four\ncheck-ins that I do with my wife\nregularly and so every day I try and ask\nher a simple one what was your highlight\nof the day or what was exciting today\nwhich is any easy one anyone can ask\nthat very simple uh every week or month\nI'll ask you know is there something\ncoming up that I can help you with like\nis there something you're struggling\nwith or something that's on your mind\nthat I need to be aware of or conscious\nof every quarter I'll ask is this\nrelationship going in the direction you\nwant or is it going in the direction\nI've want if it isn't what are we both\nwilling to do to put it in the right\ndirection yeah are you willing to do\nsomething and am I and then every year a\nsimple one of like well what's your goal\nthis year or what what are you pursuing\nthis year and those four questions don't\nor check-ins don't save a relationship\nthey do what I was saying earlier is\nthey help you track MH whether you're on\nthe same page or you're completely on\nanother page and if you're even aware\nand conscious and the reason you have to\ndo that is those should be four\ncheck-ins you do with yourself coming\nback to your point like checking with\nevery day and going myself what's my\nhighlight today checking with myself\nevery week or every month and going hey\nwhat do I need help with this month have\nI asked for that every quarter is my\nlife going in the direction that I\nwanted to go in and every year what am I\npursuing like if I'm not checking in\nthat with myself and I'm not checking in\nthat with my wife then how can I know\nmyself and how can I know this human and\nI think the assumption that I know\nsomeone like I've you know me and my\nwife have only been together for 10\nyears but it's all I know is that she's\nan constantly evolving growing human\nsure just cuz she's over 30 doesn't mean\nthat she's fully formed and done oh God\nno and and you're am I and just like\nyour children are growing up your sons\nare changing and growing I think we\nassume that kids grow and adults stay\nthe same and it's like well wait a\nminute that's so untrue yeah and and I\nthink that's what I'm always trying to\nstop my mind from normalizing that oh I\nknow her now oh I know how she's going\nto react isn't it it's such a like that\nfixed mindset and I'm so guilty of that\nbecause I'm such a like I want\neverything wrapped up in a pretty bow\nI'm like I like things like really neat\nand clean and tidy like physically you\nknow that I'm like I just want to know\nwhat's happening and like you know\naccepting uncertainty and like life is\ncompletely uncertain and if you can\nsurrender to that like but I it's just\nit's hard you know it is really hard to\nbe like okay I'm going to like go with\nthe flow and I read that uh who is it um\nBruce Lee's daughter wrote a book called\nbe like water oh yes yes yes you know\nand I was like I and I I I love when I\nremember it because I feel like I need\nlike posters all over my house of like\nall the thing that you just said and all\nthese things you're like oh yeah you\ncan't fight the current like you can't\nyou know you can't fight it and it's\nlike if you can surrender to it and like\nyou know and that the fact that we are\nalways changing and growing and and I\nlove that you said about tracking it and\nand I think was a phase in our\nrelationship when we were doing more of\nlike check-ins and we probably had\nlistened to something like this and\nwe're like oh we should be checking in\nmore and then eventually we stopped\ndoing that stops yeah yeah and you're\nlike oh man we lost we lost our way you\nknow and it's just so easy to do that\nand you know and it and it really does\nlike straddled the fence on business and\npersonal because I did it all the time\nin in the dry bar era when I would like\nyou know stop paying attention to what\nwas going on people around me and\nstopped having you know those\nconversations like I really needed to be\nhaving and just like would get all like\nsulky and you know why why would why\nwasn't I having those convers I was I\nwas causing my own suffering you know\nand it's like we just as humans do that\nwhich I you know which I think is like\nthe the self-awareness piece it's like\nthe things that we use to nurture\nourselves like what we're listening to\nwhat we're watching what we're reading\nyou know if you kind of sometimes I'm\nlike especially in the last few months\nhaving gone through going through my\ndivorce and being so sad and I'm like\ningesting so many books and so many\nthings and I'm like\nokay I've read enough I'm done I'm good\nbut then I'm like no I'm not I got to\nkeep I mean I got to do at least a\ncouple things a day that like keep me on\nthat spiritual path you know and it's\nlike what's the word I'm looking for I\ndon't want to say it's like a job or\nresponsibility habit you know daily\npractice da practice Yeah it's like it's\nso important it's so easy to lose track\nof that especially when like something\nyou get really excited or you meet\nsomebody new and you're like which is\nexactly what I do I'm like oh I'm so\nhappy now I'm like I got it I I'm good I\ndon't need to do any of that stuff\nanymore like you know got remember and\nand we're all there I want to thank you\nfor being so like honest about it and so\nreal and being so messy about it because\nI think that's all of us right like\nthat's what we're all looking for and\nwe're all looking to have a perfect\nstart and a perfect end and we're all\nlooking to have like the perfect person\nand the perfect relationship with\nourselves and none of that exists talk\nme through this because I have so many\nfriends who like you would feel shame\nand guilt for getting divorced so they\nnever will or I have a couple of friends\nthat have kind of had the courage to get\nto the other side but they now\nexperience the Judgment or they feel the\nshame that comes from other people's\nprojection of it yeah what is the\nhardest thing about getting divorce like\nwhat's the toughest part about it I've\nbeen on both sides of it now you know\nwhere the first divorce after 16\nyears you know feeling like I the love\nthat I wanted and intimacy that I wanted\nwasn't there so I was like is it was\nfunny cuz I when I first left the\nmarriage I was like you know like\nrearing to go and I was like dating\nreally quickly and all of that and then\nvery quickly my the thing happened with\nmy son and then I realized that like\ndating wasn't so easy and now I'm a\nsingle mom and at the time my ex didn't\nreally want to be talking to me and so\nit was like my world spun out of control\nand I fell into a bit of a depression\nand I remember people telling me that\nlike even though you're not in love with\nyour ex-husband anymore he still held\nlike a space and energy that is no\nlonger there and it's like a death and I\nfor months and months and months I\nrefused to believe that I was like it's\nit's not a death nobody died like I took\nit very literally and I was like he's\nhe's alive like I could would not allow\nmy brain to like understand that you\nknow until I finally did and it's like\nyou know when you it's like when the\nstudent's ready the teacher appears\nmentality and I was like I'm sure a lot\nof people said it to me but it was like\nI I was on some show with this guy who\nwrote a book called Energy speaks I\ndon't know if you've ever heard of it\nand he was talking about energy and\nwhatever and after the show I pulled him\naside and I like very quickly told him\nwhat was going on and I was and how like\nI was you know coping with my divorce\nand I was in this depression and he was\nlike listen your husband even though you\ndon't love like love him like that and\nwant to be with him he still held energy\nthat's gone and that is a very big hole\nlike black hole for you to fill in your\nlife and it's just going to you know\ntake some time which isn't rocket\nscience and I'm sure other people said\nit to me but at that moment I was like\noh my god when it hits it it hits right\nand so that\nthat change of life of like your whole\nlife being one way and then it becoming\nanother way and in in my case like my\nson going through rehab in that like\nvery hard time so it was all rolled into\nlike just being hard and I was really\nsad and and I and I was really\nstruggling and you know and then the\nidentity stuff started to kind of creep\nin\ntoo and so that was that was hard I\nthink from like more of an identity like\na personal identity standpoint was hard\nand like a rebuilding my life after so\nlong this divorce was was quite\ndifferent it felt just much more like\nheartbreak like I was heartbroken like\njust heartbroken and I'd never\nexperienced that kind of heartbreak I I\nI recognize now truly that it's it's for\nthe best and and I think for for both of\nus for all of us it's for the best but\nit just hurt so bad that like to\nexperience heartbreak like that where\nyou're like oh someone just put it\nreally well that like trauma is the\nintersection of unexpected and overwhelm\nand I think that's such a simple way to\nunderstand trauma it's like this thing\nyou didn't see coming really and then\nthe overwhelm of it like the boom you\nknow and that's kind of what it was for\nme I was like I may never recover from\nthis like that's how like devastating it\nwas and I think you know cuz I think I\ntalked to you right around the time it\nwas happening and and I was so sad I was\nlike I'm never going to be okay\nyou know and I'm you know it's and I'm\nokay you know and I've and I've when the\nfog starts to clear because it's like\nit's real muddy when you're in it and\nyou know I mean quite literally when\nyou're in fog you can't see and it's the\nperfect Ann analogy to me is like I was\nin so much fog around it and like my ego\nwas all like bent out of shape and I was\nyou know and I was worried like my kids\nwere going to be mad at me and I was\nworried what the world was going to\nthink and all this stuff and then I was\nlike now as the clouds and the fog\nstarted to clear I'm like oh no this was\nnot ultimately the right thing you know\nand maybe in some Universe like had we\nhad these conversations we've done this\nthing maybe it would have been right but\nit just wasn't and this was the way it\nall went down and I've realized that\nlike oh this there's a lot of lessons\nhere and there's a lot of medicine and\nI've learned so much and I'm so grateful\nfor it now you know like I'm still\ncoming out of the anger of it a little\nbit but I am ultimately just really\ngrateful for all the lessons that I've\nlearned and and I think I said this\nearlier I like who I am on almost every\nlevel now more than I did then I had it\nwas a lot of tough lessons I had to\nlearn and I was looking at myself in\nthis lens that I had not looked at\nmyself through of like why he made that\ndecision and why he didn't want the\nmarriage anymore which is just I mean\nyou can imag I mean you put yourself\nthose in that first second if your wife\nwas like I want a divorce right now you\nyou would just be like it's\ndevastating if you're you know in love\nwith somebody but then when and so I was\nlike trying I've tried to now put myself\nin the very painful place of like why\nwhy didn't he want to be with me and and\nsure like I not not to go down the\nrabbit hole of like I'm a terrible\nperson and I'm not worthy it's not that\nit's more of like let me see what what\nthe things were that I didn't like about\nmyself that I can now see through his\neyes and this is not a conversation with\nhim this is a conversation with me and\nhow I perceived a lot of things and the\nway I acted and the way I showed up a\nlot that I don't like you know that I'm\nlike oh I don't ever want to show up\nlike that again and what a gift and what\na lesson to like be this better version\nof myself now so to answer your question\nthose were like the hardest things of it\nbut it is I'm literally living proof\nthat you can you will get through it and\neverybody kept saying that to me I would\ngrasp onto that like when people would\nsay it's you're going to be okay it's G\nI promise you're going to be okay and I\nwould like hold on to that like thank\nyou I needed other people to say it to\nme because I couldn't find it in myself\nI could I didn't believe it but if\nenough people said it to me like I\npromise you and so many people said that\nto me I promise you you're going to be\nokay it's you know it's it's a beautiful\nthing to have like a community of people\naround you that will tell you that and\nthat you and I'm like are you are you\nsure like do you know and they're like I\nknow you know and it's lofty but it's\ntrue you know so well you know what I\nfind so hope giving about your choices\nis that you turn\ntowards people things ideas that would\nhelp and support you and I think that\nthat's the hard part like it's so easy\nand it's natural and should not be\njudged at all but it's so easy for you\nto go off the rails and Go in different\ndirection and the fact that you had the\ninner wisdom and the intuition say\nactually I'm going to turn towards\nadvice and therapy and coaching and\ninsight and learning and reading and\nhearing this message from a supportive\nCommunity like that's what I want people\nto take away because I want you to hear\nthat that that's the choice we have to\ntry and make and something you said this\nconcept you were talking about the\nintersection something sparked for me as\nyou said that and I was going to\ncomplete your sentence but I didn't want\nto because you knew it you knew no I\ndidn't know what you were going to say\nand that's why I waited because I didn't\nknow what you'd read or heard but I was\nthinking about it that when I heard the\nword when you think about trauma or even\nlike a trigger that eventually leads to\ntrauma it's actually the intersection\nbetween an unexpected event but a\nfamiliar feeling and so there's what you\nwere talking about earlier as well like\nhow you repeat your parents' marriage\nlike the idea that it's an unexpected\nbecause you didn't think you would ever\ndo that but then it's a really familiar\nfeeling and you're like oh I I feel that\nor like I'm going through a divorce\nsomeone's asked me for a divorce it's an\nunexpected event but it's a familiar\nfeeling of I don't like myself already\nand this is a reminder of something I\nknow deep down and it's that familiarity\nwith that unexpectedness that completely\nconverges to create such disharmony and\nmisalignment in yeah it really does you\nknow because you're like and it's\namazing when you have like a great\nsupport system around you telling you\nthat no you're a good person it's like\nyou know my best friend and she would\ntell me like we would yes you have\nculpability here you know and we would\nshe knew it my relationship very well\ncuz she's my best friend but no you're\nnot a bad person you know there are\nthings that you had to learn about\nyourself and there are things that you\nknow you want to change but there it\ndoesn't mean you're a bad person and\nit's hard to live in that duality of\nlike beating yourself up and the shame\nthat we can put on ourselves because\nthis marriage failed and I'm like\nbecause in the beginning I was like this\nmarriage failed I'm a ter you know I'm a\nterrible person no one's ever going to\nlove me again any any man I'm gonna date\nis G be like oh you were married twice\nsorry see you you know which isn't true\nyou know but it's it is the things that\nyou know we do which you know I have\nspent a lot of time a lot of the stuff\nthat I read is on like you know mindset\nand the brain and how powerful the brain\nis and how we can change our thoughts\nand and that stuff's all so fascinating\nto me you know like that you can we have\ncontrol I didn't believe that until now\nlike until very recently I was like it\nis what it is you know but now I'm like\noh we can change our thoughts and we can\nyou know decide and and it's like\nthere's a to me there's like a well you\nstill got to grieve the thing yeah but I\ncan also because I was like you know I\nwas I started listening to Joe despenza\nyou know him of course yeah he's been on\nthe show four times oh right I think I\nmight have discovered him through your\nyour show actually I love that guy and I\nlove what he says you know and I but I I\nhad some people be like yeah his stuff\nis great but like you still have to\ngrieve stuff cuz I was like I'm just\ngoing to believe this you know and it's\nlike but there's still the grief over\nthere and I think that's another\nchallenging part of like anything like\ndying is that the grief your body\nphysically needs to go through if you\nchange your mindset too fast and like\nyou know it's kind of an interesting I\nthink it's a little of both I'm really\nfascinated by by the whole thing the\nbrain can do absolutely when you look at\ngrief and loss it's like there's the\ngrief and loss of that person\nand then there's the grief and loss of\nthe person you were with that person yes\nand they're two different things because\nyou were a particular type of yourself\nthere was a part of yourself that was\nconnected to that individual and now not\nonly as that person gone that part that\nyou'd created with them has also gone\nand is no longer existent and so there's\nso identity layer is such a fascinating\nsubject in and of itself and it's like\nyou weren't complete in the first place\neither and so there's there's just so\nmany layers to it that are so\nchallenging and all of these things that\nyou're talking about whether it's your\nwork your marriage your kids they put a\nspotlight onto all of this and all the\ngaps what would you say was the most\nimportant lesson you took away from your\nfirst relationship and then your second\nrelationship because you've just you\nwere talking so much about it was all\nabout lessons I to Lear what would you\nsay was the first one that you took away\nfrom the first and then from the second\nwhat have you taken away what's been the\nbig um lesson that stayed with you you\nknow I think for me and it's it's pretty\nvulnerable to say but like it was like\noh I I think I rushed into both of my\nmarriages because I didn't want to be\nalone and I wanted to be in a\nrelationship and I just wanted to be in\na relationship they were right enough I\ndon't think anything's ever were perfect\nof course but you know I realized there\nwere things in both of my marriages that\nweren't like exactly what I wanted them\nto be and and again it's a hard thing to\nsay cuz it's like nothing's ever exactly\nwhat you want it to be with some of the\nthings that were happening with us I\nthink I actually was pretty open and\nhonest about them but we what we weren't\nopen and honest about was like what I\nactually needed it to be and if it\nwasn't going to be that like then it\nprobably wasn't going to work and we\nboth needed to like come to terms with\nthat so you know I think the lesson is\nlike really level\nsetting what you need and what that\nother person needs not just what you\nneed like sometimes you have to be the\none that's willing to say like I don't\nthink this is going to work because blah\nblah but like to me I don't think I've\never been strong enough to be like I'm\ncompletely in love with you but I don't\nthink this relationship is going to work\nlike who can do that that's so hard I'm\nsure people do you know it's like I\nthink about it like so silly I think\njust CU I've watched so many movies in\nmy life like Legend of the Fall did you\never see Legends of the Fall you know I\nmean it's like it just it just it came\nto me recently I was like you know you\nwatch one of those movies and like you\nwant the like the love story to work and\nthen it doesn't and you're like and you\nyou walk out of that movie like so sad\nand you're like just wanted them to be\ntogether you know and that's how I feel\nin this second marriage like I really\nwanted it to work and as the viewer\nwatching the movie you're like I know it\nwasn't right and it wasn't supposed to\nbe and it's like you know and that's how\nI felt like Legends of the Fall you know\nit's like I feel like that La Land oh\nyeah oh my God that's even better La\nLand like why weren't they together at\nthe end you know you're and you watch\nthat movie and I've watched a couple\ntimes such a great movie and you're like\nyou know she marries that other guy and\nyou're sorry for anybody who hasn't\nwatched La La Land it's it's been a\nwhile though yeah and it's that really\nhow it's like landed for me in this like\nsometimes like what we want to work just\ndoesn't you know and you have to just\nlearn to accept it and I think that's\nthat's been the big lesson for me is\nlike you know a lot of people people\nclose to me know and have said to me in\nthe aftermath of this like you've you've\nhad things work out for you pretty well\nmost of your life you know and I have\nand I'm really blessed and lucky in that\nway and this has been like one of the\nfirst things that like didn't work out\nthe way I wanted it to and I couldn't\ncontrol it you know no matter what I did\nI couldn't change the outcome and like o\nthat's rough you know and I'm sure and I\nknow a lot of people have dealt with\nthat on a much bigger and harder scale\nthan me and and so that was a real\nlesson of like so surrender of like you\njust don't get control you know I look\nat my first marriage and think that like\nwe were married for so long and for so\nlong I didn't have that like electric\nchemistry love that I wanted but yet I\nhad these two amazing kids and I built\nthis great business and so like that was\nenough for me you know in this stage of\nmy life I feel like I actually want more\nof it all now you know where I was\nalways like well I have this I don't\nhave that but I have this and now I'm\nlike I want to do something that I\nreally love and feel passionate about\nfor myself and I want to have a great\nlove too and now I'm trying to find both\nyeah yeah absolutely and and you know\nEllie like what I really appreciate\nabout you honestly this conversation the\nbook is like you're the real deal like a\nlot of people will say they want to\nshare their messy truth and they want\nto tell what's really going on and I\nthink it's almost like we're still\ntrying to do it because it sounds and\nlooks vulnerable but it isn't and that's\nnot you know and I think that hearing\nfrom you today all I've heard is the\nmessy truth and it's not being I can't\nthink of anyone who's listening to this\nthat isn't going to feel comforted\nsupported held\nand feel connected to your journey in\nsome way I don't think it's\nmathematically spiritually emotionally\npossible for someone to master every\narea of their life perfectly at all\ntimes I just I just want to throw that\nout there because we still keep putting\nit up when we say things like power\ncouple when we say things like oh my God\nthe perfect match when we say things\nlike you know we don't realize how many\nideas we've put into the world yeah that\noh my god did you know they're both\nbillionaires now and they're both and\nit's like you have no idea just how many\nideas you're we plant seeds in people's\nminds that these headlines exist in\nreality yeah and if you're someone who\nknows anyone you know that the headline\nis so untrue yeah about everyone and\nthat doesn't mean people can't have\nhealthy relationships it doesn't mean\npeople can't have happy relationships\nbut do people have perfect relationships\nno and do people have perfect businesses\nno and do people have perfect anything\nknow and so it's it's a mindset that\nwe've all been so conditioned to believe\nit's why we feel sad when Ryan goling\ndoesn't end up with Emma Stone like it's\nthere's a it's because we've been taught\nthat that is the perfect ending that is\nthe perfect ending and there's so much\nwiring that we have to\nuncross and that's the work you're doing\nand I think that that that's what I'm so\nappreciative of watching and observing\nyou on this journey is you're so corre\ncourageously and bravely doing the hard\nunlearning yeah there's uh it reminds me\nof you know I'm sure you're familiar\nwith Michael Singer and you know until\nyeah there's been a few books that I'm\nlike I've listened to on repeat you're\njust like I just got to keep listening\nto this to get like through the day it\ndidn't sink into me until I started\nthinking about the whole movie thing\nwhich was like he was like you know if\nyou're in heartbreak or you're in\nsadness he's like he equated it to again\nit it only connected for me recently not\nwhen he said it\nbut this like idea of when you watch a\nmovie and you get sad about something\nit's like you and but then you tell all\nyour friends about it you talk about it\nit's like you almost like the sadness\nand the emotion that it brings in but\nit's just like when it happens to you\nyou don't like it quite as much but if\nyou can put yourself in that like it's\njust your movie you know and you're just\nwatching it and you're not going to feel\nsad forever you know it's such a good\nperspective of it and it's funny how\nit's like come full circle for me of\nlike oh this is my sad movie and it's\nsad and then it's and but it's also okay\nyou know yeah and it's almost like just\nlike a movie when you walk in and watch\none part of a movie you don't get the\nfull picture so you walked in on a sad\nscene or you walked in on a scene where\none guy is chasing another guy and you\nthink the guy being chased is the bad\nguy but actually it's the good guy like\nthere's just so much right we we look at\npeople's lives in\nSnapchats and fascinating you can't tell\nwho what and who's who and who's the\nvillain and who's the hero and yeah\nbecoming an observer in our own life is\nso hard to do but Ali we end every\nepisode of on purpose with the final\nfive okay and so these are your final\nfive they have to be answered in one\nword to one sentence maximum and I will\nask you to go off if I feel like it so\nquestion number one uh what is the best\nentrepreneurship advice you've ever\nheard or received progress over\nPerfection you know I think that we as\nentrepreneurs we get stuck in this and I\nsee it all the time of like oh I can't\nstart this because I don't have this and\nI don't know this and I don't have\nenough money out have this but like just\nstart and you know you'll it's it's\nnever gonna I mean just we've just\ntalked about this it's never going to be\nperfect but just like just go it'll\nyou'll you'll get it you'll figure it\nout as you go and I think that's what\npeople don't realize that I fully agree\nwith you and that's where the mistakes\nare made but the problem is there's no\nother path so if you just waited waited\nwaited you never make any mistakes but\nyou never get anywhere and if you start\nand you stumble you will make loads of\nmistakes and that's what kind of exposes\nyou and there's all these flaws and\neverything but you got somewhere and\nit's that awkward messiness that yeah\nand it's like you it's hard in the\nmoment like anything that's like worth\nanything is hard in the moment you know\nit's like the mistakes are hard it sucks\nbut you learn from them and it's very\ncliche but it is so true you know and\nyou're right if you don't get into a\nrelationship like you know I have a\nfriend who like is like hasn't gotten\ninto a relationship because she's kind\nof scared I'm like you just just just go\nand even if it's not a good one just go\nand like learn from it you know go on\nthat date you know absolutely second\nquestion what is the worst\nentrepreneurship advice you've ever\nheard or received it's interesting that\nearlier you pointed out how I you know I\nI took the advice from the women that I\nwas serving in my mobile business what\nwhat I didn't do was take the advice\nfrom like a bunch of men who didn't\nunderstand this business you know and\nI'm not a big fan of like decision by\ncommittee not and not to say that I\ndon't want like trusted people people\naround me to help saying yeah it's like\nI don't I don't believe in this like let\nme just ask a million people and then\nfigure it out like I I love using you\nknow Steve Jobs obviously a brilliant\nbrilliant man it's like nobody knew that\nwe didn't know we needed iPhones and and\nmaybe we don't need iPhones but like we\nsure love them but but we didn't know we\nneeded them no I know what you're saying\nyeah like even the I feel like I saw a\npreview of a the new movie coming out\nabout the founders of blackberries oh I\nwonder what's that I didn't know that oh\ncool I know I saw it I'm pretty sure I\ndidn't dream it and it because you know\nthe story the story is really\nfascinating it's like I like I think the\npremise of it is that the founder of\nblackberry this is so appropo to what\nwe're talking about it's like the people\nin his company came to him and said like\nI think I there's something coming out\nwe need to change from what we're doing\nand like going to this Smartphone world\nand and he was like no that's not going\nto work that's not going to happen and\neverybody in the company was like don't\nthis going to happen and obviously we\nknow it happened and blackberry went\naway which by the way my brother like\nhad the last Blackberry standing as he\nloved the little buttons a lot of people\ndid and blackberry was like\nrevolutionary I had of course they were\namazing they were the first thing you\nknow but this this the story as as I\nbelieve it set up in the preview is like\nthat company could have taken the\nsimilar path as as iPhone did but they\ndidn't and and again I'm Loosely\nremembering the story but I just think\nit's really fascinating that you got\nsometimes you got to just like try\nsomething and see if it's going to work\nand see if people are going to want it\nand I and I'm I've always been a massive\nfan of Steve Jobs and I'm like so many\nothers and the iPhone and you know it's\nlike it's just so cool like this you\nknow like he invented this thing that\nbecame this thing you know and so you\nknow I feel like don't ever get too\ncaught up in what people think of your\nidea yeah yeah there's you reminded me\nof a famous quote from Henry Ford he\nsaid if I would have asked people what\nthey wanted they would have said Faster\nHorses yeah and and like that was the\nmind I mean that's great because that is\nwhat it is if you do that Committee in\nthat focus group it's you can't\nnecessarily think beyond what you see\nyeah and and you know and so many ideas\ndon't make it and so many ideas fail and\nlots of them don't work but like might\nas well somebody's got to try we\nwouldn't get anywhere you know\nabsolutely all right question number\nthree what is one habit mindset or\npractice that you believe every\nentrepreneur should try to develop some\nsort of awareness practice you know\nwhether it's through entrepreneurship\nlike I I listen to your meditations all\nthe time yeah and I've gotten into this\nplace of every morning before I not not\nalways but most of the time I before I\nlike get on my phone and check all my\nstuff and do all the things like I like\nkeep my phone on sleep mode and get into\na meditation while like I'm still in bed\nand I think that like quiet time in the\nmorning and then I'll usually like write\nfor a little while not even like a page\nyou know just something to get like like\nthe cobwebs out almost you know and I\nthink it's I think it's just important\nas a human but you know as a as an\nentrepreneur just\nlike you know like level set yourself\nand I and I really try to do it before I\ngo to bed at night too you know I always\ngo to sleep now whether I'm really tired\nor not to like some sort of like sleep\nmeditation I think I only catch like the\nfirst like five or 10 minutes that means\nit's good yeah but I I really love that\nand I I never had to practice like that\nbefore and I'll tell you I never had to\npractice like that until my my\nseparation happened and I was like you\nknow I'm by myself and we used to like\nwatch TV and then fall asleep and like\nagain that was that's like one of those\nthings that I'm like I'm so glad I I\nalmost never turn my TV on in my bedroom\nanymore and I know that probably a lot\nof people don't believe even in that and\nI'm actually about to move and I'm like\ndo I want to put a TV in my bedroom\nbecause I feel like I almost never watch\nTV in my room anymore because by the\ntime I get in bed I usually want to read\nI want to do my meditation I want to\nwrite and by the time I do all that I'm\nso tired and I also I don't know I pick\nup so much random information but I I\nheard somewhere somebody said it maybe\nit was you who knows cuz I watched so\nmuch your stuff but like by 10:30 you\nshould be off screens I think it was\nmaybe huberman who said it and CU from\n10 10:30 to 4: like your brain starts to\ngo into to depression again I don't\nremember the science but I was like\nwhether this is true or not I like this\nlike I want to I want to be off my\ndevices by 10:30 and so that's really my\ngoal now which I used to stay up and\nwatch TV till like midnight you know I'm\nso glad I don't do that anymore I feel\nso much better I mean I was also on a\nmission to like I got to feel better\nhere like I got to get out of this\ndepression and this sadness so I better\ndo everything I can do and now I'm like\noh I'm not really that sad anymore I'm\nnot really I'm not sad anymore but I\nthink I should still keep doing these\nthings you know and so that I think is\nimportant to have that kind of practice\nand I really have come to love it that's\nbeautiful I love it all right question\nfour and five uh question number\nfour how would you define your current\npurpose that's very clear to me right\nnow is like giving back being of service\nlike I feel really called to like help\nothers in lots of ways like I'm I'm\nstarting this um volunteer program at\nchla which I feel really called to I'm\nlooking at doing some stuff with animals\nand I do a lot of mentoring for other\nentrepreneurs and you know in some\nthings there's like you know money\ninvolved and I'm speaking at things and\nyou know and I think that that's okay\nand good abolutely and then there's some\nthings I'm just donating my time but\nit's all in like in the name of service\nit's beautiful for sure right now I love\nthat all right Fifth and final question\nwhich we ask to every guest who's ever\nbeen on the show if you could create one\nlaw that everyone in the world had to\nfollow what would it be oh to be kind\nmhm we're just so divided because of you\nknow it's like I mean I think it's\ndeeper than that but it's like this\nnotion of like you know even I I said I\nread something the other day that was\nlike anger is just grief we had to like\nit was just like innate in us to be kind\nto other people like you imagine totally\nwhat kind of world it would be so much\nbetter well said everyone the book is is\ncalled the messy\ntruth how I sold my business for\nMillions but almost lost myself by New\nYork Times bestselling author Ali web uh\nyou can grab the book right now it's out\nright now share it make it your next\nbook club pick discuss it dissect it I\nmean if you want to have a real\nentrepreneurial story and journey in\nyour hand this is the one to have uh Ali\nthank you so much for coming on the show\ntoday this is amazing genuinely being so\nopen and honest and courageous in your\nown life and here and uh I look forward\nto continuing our our new relationship\nand very grateful for it thank you so\nmuch thank you so much for having me if\nyou love this episode you will also love\nmy interview with Charles doig on how to\nhack your brain change any habit\neffortlessly and a secret to making\nbetter decisions look am I hesitating on\nthis because I'm scared of making the\nchoice cuz I'm scared of doing the work\nor am I sitting with this because it\njust doesn't feel right yet"
