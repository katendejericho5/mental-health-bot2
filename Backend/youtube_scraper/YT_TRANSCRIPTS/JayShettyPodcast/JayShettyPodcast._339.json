can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and this podcast on purpose\nwith J\nshett now Jay before we start go on can\nI tell a story you can okay I got I have\nto let your audience know how this book\neven became okay they have to know Jay\nokay all right so I visit you I'm here\nvisiting because Swami's here R in now\nswam is here and you had often said Jada\nyou should write a book I'm like Jay I\ndon't want to so this day once again\nyou're like Jada you should write a book\nand I'm like Jay I don't want to write a\nbook you're like well you should write a\nbook Jay I don't want to write a book\nwe're going back and forth like siblings\nRod n comes into the kitchen because\nRody's making a beautiful lunch for us\nto eat he comes he sits down he goes Jay\nif Jada doesn't want to write a book she\ndoesn't have to write a book and you go\nwell I think she should write a book and\nI was like oh did he just talk back\nto but I'm going to tell you something\nthat was a really a moment for me right\nbecause I said I because I'd been\npushing back for a long time and you\ntalking to me about it and that moment I\nwas like okay I need you to take that\nhome and I need you to think about it\nbecause Jay's your brother there's\nsomething here that you might not be\nseeing and it was really that moment\nthat put me on pause and a couple of\ndays later I was in\nmeditation and it came to me and I said\noh my God goodness my journey from\nunlovable to\nlovable is a worthy story to tell and I\ncalled you and I said Jay I got it thank\nyou but you were so persistent about it\nright and I just want to thank you\nbecause honestly and I'm not you know if\nit hadn't been for that moment that book\nwouldn't be here right now right and you\nreally were on my neck about it for a\nlong\ntime so I just want to say thank you\nbecause you also made it clear you were\nlike you'll you made it clear to me I\nwould get a lot out of it and I have so\nI just want to say thank you it's been\nsuch a deep healing process for me in\nways that I could have never imagined\nyou know and what you said before you\nknow we even started in the introduction\nyou know just that hope of it's so hard\nto find authentic happiness in this\nworld even through my journey my 52\nyears and just trying to figure out how\nto be\nauthentically happy has been such an\nexcruciating process and one of the\npurposes of this book is like if I can\nhelp in\nany small amount of way you know in any\nway possible to help somebody have an\neasier or just leave like little\nbreadcrumbs kind of like not a blueprint\ncuz everybody's process is different but\njust little breadcrumbs of how to find\nthat for yourself because it has been\nreally difficult for me so thank you\nthank you thank you well thank you for\nsharing that with me and I think I\nblocked that memory out because I don't\nI don't think I've ever tried to stand\nup against rather\nte you know my teacher before I think\nthat would uh so i' I've pretended that\nit yeah that did it for Me growing up\nreading autobiographies is what changed\nmy life and I think one of the things\nthat I feel we struggle with today is\nthat people's\nnarratives are being told from so many\ndifferent angles apart from their\nown and when I grew up and I was reading\nthe words of Martin Luther King or I was\nreading Malcolm X\nI found there to be so much power in\nreading the words directly from an\nindividual and\nso even if that wasn't their\nautobiography if it was their work their\nwords you felt so intimately connected\nwith that person and I feel that when\npeople move on and we don't have them on\nthe planet anymore it's almost like you\nlose this Treasure House of experience\nand\nmemories and I also think that if\nsomeone's listening or watching right\nnow and you're thinking well Jay I would\nnever write a book I'm not a public\nfigure I'm not a celebrity I'm not a\nmusician or an actor I don't have a\ncareer path that means I should be an\nauthor I still think that telling your\nstory whether it's to your family your\nkids your is so important I could not\nagree with you more I think it's\nactually imperative that looking at your\nlife on the page like you\nforget experiences you know you forget\nlike oh my goodness I did that oh I went\nthrough that oh my god really I came\nthrough that it's like it's almost like\nan homage to yourself honestly to really\nbe able to look at your life and go\nwow what a life I think everybody should\ntake some time even if it's just one\nlike because even with Worthy I took one\nline which was unlovable to lovable so\nanything in regards to my life that was\non that\nArc I talked about but there's so much\nmore so many other parts of my life\nright so even if somebody says you know\nwhat I just want to you know write down\num the happiest moments of my childhood\nand I want to just look at that on paper\nright but whatever Journey somebody\ndecides to pick from from their life um\nand and to examine thoroughly on the\npage I would definitely suggest that\nbecause it is really powerful and it's\nso healing and it will teach you so much\nabout yourself absolutely I could agree\nmore I couldn't agree more let's let's\ndive in okay because that journey of\nbeing unlovable to lovable as you're\ntracing there I think is a journey that\nwe all have to walk in our own ways and\nI think when you know I I met you I\nthink five years ago now we've just\nspent a lot of time together in the last\nfive years hence we have a deep\nconnection but when I first met you I\nwas looking at you from the outside and\nover the last five years I've got to\nknow you through an inner journey and\nand you know through family as well and\nthrough spending time with your\nfamily and what I found was that we\noften lose context when you view\nsomeone's life from the outside and when\nyou get closer the greatest thing you\nget is context and so I wanted to start\noff and this book does that so well but\nI want to start off of what does it feel\nlike growing up with a teenage mom who\nhas an addiction like I think that that\nis so formative in so many ways and it's\nso easy to forget that that's where you\nstarted because of your career growing\nup with my mother a teenage my it's like\nwe grew up together it's almost like\nhaving a big\nsister I mean even to this day you know\nit's like it's like I I get to have two\nroles in my mom like sometimes she's\nstill my big sister and then sometimes\nshe really comes in as your as my mother\nyou know what I mean as you saw in the\nbook it's like I had all this Freedom\nrunning crazy in the streets or what\nhave you but there was such pivotal\nmoments where Adrien came to the rescue\nas my mother right and she still does\nthat to this day but it was you know I\ndid a lot of having to raise my myself\nand there are parts of that it's pros\nand cons to that there's a lot of Pros\nit's like that is the part that made it\npossible for me to come to La at the age\nof 18 on my own and figure this\nHollywood game out right just with no\nfear completely Fearless but then also\nkind of growing up with certain ideas of\nwhat I thought um love was or certain\nsurvival mechanisms that you know as I\ngot older didn't quite serve me but I\nthink that we all have that no matter\nwhat our family background is you know\nwhat I'm saying we all kind of pick up\nthings that along the way that um don't\nserve us for the entirety of our journey\nI tell you I I\nlearned a lot having a young\nmom at at an early age I really do think\nthat even with our trials and our\nchallenges that the great Supreme gave\nme the mom I was supposed to have in the\nmost perfect mother in The Journey that\nI was supposed to have to prepare me for\nother parts of my journey but you know\nit was challenging and beautiful at the\nsame time yeah and I love gamy so I just\nwant to put that yeah yeah we all love\ngamy we all love gam yeah and and but\nit's really interesting there's one line\nin your book that really kind of\ncemented that feeling of unlovable to me\nfrom that time and you said there was a\ntime when you felt like you were not\nbeing a priority to the two people who\ngave you life like that was hard that\nreally hit me because I was like yeah\nthat was probably really difficult and\nlike you had two parents who drugs were\ntheir focus in the lifestyle that came\nwith it you know I also talk about in\nthe book when my father told me at seven\nyears old I can't be your father and\nit's just like wow okay what do I do\nwith this what does a seven-year-old do\nwith that you you just kind of\ninternalize it and you kind of go okay\num what's wrong with me what is it about\nme that I'm not enough for these two\npeople to look at me as a priority\nbecause I see everybody else's parents\nand it looks like their kids are their\npriority so what's wrong with me so you\nkind of I internalized this idea of not\nbeing enough not being lovable and it's\nit's strange cuz it's not that that I\ndidn't feel like my mother didn't love\nme it's just that am I lovable\nenough to be the priority am I lovable\nenough to for you to show up for me as\nthe mom that I see other moms be you\nknow so I\ndefinitely internalize that and I think\nthat I took that into the world of like\nI'm just going to prove constantly\nhaving to prove myself then I'm lovable\nI'm lovable enough I'm lovable enough\nand I think that was some of the\nmessaging that I took from my childhood\ninto into my adulthood and I appreciate\nyou going back to that seven-year-old\nself because in hindsight and now\nlooking back you can make sense of it\nand you can connect the dots but it's\nlike when you're actually in that\nposition it's very natural as you said\nto just internalize it and I think that\nwhat's really interesting with your\njourney is we all have to develop the\nemotional skills our parents didn't have\nyeah and the earlier we do that the\neasier and simpler life\nbecomes but often most of our energy\ngoes in thinking well I wish they had\nthem or they should have had them and\nwhen I'm listening to you what I'm\nhearing is that it's not even the belief\nthat they don't love me or love me\nenough it's the belief that somewhere\ninside I am not lovable yes yes right\nit's it's it's so ins you it's not even\nabout them absolutely it's like I'm not\nvaluable I'm not yeah it's because\nthat's your mirror at first right but it\nit and it's so complicated and nuanced\ndo I believe my father loved me of\ncourse in the way that he could I think\nthat he felt the most loving thing he\ncould do was tell me I can't be your\nfather and I respected that even at\nseven because I was like like at least\nsomebody's telling me the truth I've\nalways respected hardcore truths that is\none thing about me I respect hardcore\ntruths doesn't mean I always like them\nbut I freaking respect them at seven\nlike that lesson started that's a\ngangster hardcore truth to tell a child\nbut then at the same time that seed\nwithin me that is like well are all men\nlike that like if my dad doesn't love me\nhow is any man going to love me I didn't\nrealize that at seven mhm that's when I\nstarted getting into like 16 17 when I\nstart you know having those kind of\nintimate relationships with men and\nrealizing oh wow I'm really this area is\nthis area is quite\nunhealthy you know what I mean of just\nlike how I viewed myself I was either\ngiving too much or not enough I'm either\nhot or super\ncold you know emotionally yeah yeah yeah\nand so trying to regulate and understand\nbecause you know my understanding is\nthat a a young girl's first relationship\nand understanding of Love is with her\nfather I didn't have that at all so I'm\nstill learning yeah yeah I'm still\nreally immature in that area of just\nemotional development\naround\nintimacy with masculinity I know that\nnow whereas before I didn't know that\nyeah you're don't aware I'm not aware\nlike this is just what it is and then\ngrowing up in an environment with so\nmuch violence and so much aggression and\noh man it was like what do you do with\nall that and trying to just like unpack\nall of it to just figure out like oh\nlife is about love it's not about power\nand ego and winning and losing\nI mean it's taken me I'm\n52 just now understanding that it's been\na wild ride but you know\nwhat every day I thank the great Supreme\nfor for the journey and just for giving\nme the Awakenings the little Awakenings\nthat I get about love and just my\nwillingness to have it you know really\nwanting to understand what love is all\nabout but I do have to give my\ngrandmother a lot of credit I was going\nto talk about yeah Maran really I had\nall these different seeds that were\nplanted in me and Maran seed that that\ngoes to show you how the Legacy of Love\nWill overpower everything it is her it\nis the legacy of love that my\ngrandmother instilled in me and also the\ndesire to search she always had me\nunderstand that the world is full of\ntreasures get out there and find them M\nshe instilled that in me at a very young\nage and she also instilled in me that I\nwas special but I was her first\ngrandchild you know I was her first\ngrandchild there you go makeing excuses\nI'm just said you know I was her first\ngrandchild and so she she really made me\nthink that I could be and do anything\nbeing the child of two addicts on one\nside and then my grandmother instilling\nin me like like no I'm telling you you\ngot something\nkid you know what I mean and so just\nbeing able to hold on to those seeds\nthat she put within me and then of\ncourse my mother encouraging me along\nthe way too my mother saw some really\nbeautiful stuff in me as well and she's\nbeen one of my biggest cheerleaders and\nchampions throughout my life absolutely\nif your if your grandmother saw you\ntoday oh what would she say oh my\ngoodness my grandmother would be so\nproud of me through it all like with the\ngood and the challenges she had a very\nchallenging life extremely and what she\nwas able to make out of her life as a\nimmigrant you know child of two\nimmigrants from\nJamaica um she became pregnant at 13 to\nthis day we don't know how that happened\nwe do believe that it was a mistake and\nit wasn't that she was raped or molested\nor t you know I never got that from her\nI always got that it was her lack of\nknowledge about sex that created that\ncircumstance and um she had that baby on\nher own she was pretty much abandoned\nand she was taken in by a family through\na foster a white family who she worked\nfor as a maid and um got herself to\nHoward University wow and was able to go\nto India as an ambassador yeah she went\nto India and came back and my\ngrandfather who was studying to be a\ndoctor asked her to get married so I\nthink she would be and is very proud of\nme with it all I love that that's that's\nspecial to feel that that if someone to\nlook back so Jade at the start of this\nbook you talk about how you were and\nthis broke my heart you were talking\nabout how you were planning taking your\nlife but then how it could look like an\naccident yeah that was 2011 that was my\n40th birthday my 40th year actually when\nI was reading that I was just thinking\nto myself I was like what were you\nhoping that would achieve like what what\nwere you hoping that would solve talk us\nthrough that yeah it's funny because\nwhen you're in those States you're not\nclear it's not like it's going to make\nrational sense right you want out of the\npain and you cannot imagine your only\nway out is\ndeath you think in your mind you've\ntried everything and you're\nlike it's all I God I can't do this I\ncan't keep doing this and so that's your\nonly\nsolution and I tell people all the time\nyou know we've had a lot of um different\nSpotlight of people taking their life\npeople call I cannot believe it and I'm\nlike you just never know what somebody's\ngoing through and there are certain\npeople that have a high tolerance for\nbeing able to put on a good face in\norder\nto not burden people MH but what is\nreally interesting is\nthat when you have a\nplan sometimes that gives you enough\nenergy to just keep going cuz you're\nlike okay I got a good plan so if this\ngets really bad I know where to go MH\nand you're like okay I'm just going to\nkeep trying to figure this out I'm keep\ntrying to figure this out but I got this\nplan and it's really tough because you\ndon't want to for personalities like\nmyself you don't want to burden anybody\nyou're like look if I can't figure out\nhow to get out of this nobody else is\ngoing to be able to figure this out\neither that was a really\nreally\nit's a really painful time I'm sorry no\ndon't be sorry j I'm really grateful\nthat I am found a way\nout but I think about people who don't\nfind it and I wish I\nwish there was\nlike one thing I could say one piece of\nadvice you know like what would you tell\nsomebody in a situation like that and\nall I can ever say is please just keep\ngoing keep trying keep walking trust\nbecause if you trust and I know how\ndifficult it is you know for people who\nare in it like that's easy for you to\nsay but if you keep\ntrusting the universe will open a\ndoor and I know how hard it is to just\nwake\nup and keep it going cuz for me it was\nhard just waking up in the morning if I\ncould get to\n4:00 I was like okay you made it another\nday being able\nto have enough strength to just get\nup get out of\nbed put put clothes on get through your\nday and let no one know that you're\nstruggling it is so\nhard I feel really\nblessed you know when plant medicine\ncame my way it saved my life and I know\nthat it's still a lot\nof whatever around Plant medicine but\nI'm going to tell you like this and I'm\nnot saying that that's for everybody\nbecause my way out was a rugged four\nnights and it was just my thoughts\nthoughts about myself it was just my\nself-hatred the level of self-hatred\nyou have that I have had to want to take\nmy own life and I had to walk four\nnights to clear up look at be with that\nlevel of self-hatred I was like you want\nto talk about walking through the Valley\nof the shadow of death but I'm really\ngrateful for that experience because\nafter that one\nnight I never thought about suicide\nagain yeah after the ceremony after the\nceremony and it was really my last\nresort I was like okay this has been\nbrought my way I'm going to try this and\nit worked praise God thank you that's a\nreally painful place for me still and\njust thinking about how many\npeople are sitting in that\nplace it really breaks my heart trus in\nGod that's those moments where I just\nhave to just be\nlike God these are your children you\nwill take care and I pray\nthat God you will provide the door you\nhave provided for me thank you for being\nso vulnerable with us I want to give you\na big hug can I come give you a big hug\nyou can give me a hug hug\noh I love\nyou thank you you've been such a\nwonderful\nfriend you really have\nyou've been by my side through some\nreally tough stuff only for more\ntime only for more challenges to come\nalong the way I'm so i' never you know I\nwouldn't have had the fortune of getting\nto meet you and I'm really glad that you\nyou know were so vulnerable with us just\nnow because I I really feel like\nthere's more people than we think that\nhave those thoughts trust and believe it\ntrust and believe it there's\npeople there's people that you see every\nday that you would never believe it's so\nfunny to to have that level of strength\nand that level of vulnerability and just\nyou know Despair and at the same time\nthat level of like\nhelplessness that could drive you to do\nsomething like that but a lot of times\nwe just don't know how to communicate it\nI didn't know how and no one knew like\nthe will kids this is\nalready they knew I was very unhappy\nyeah that wasn't a secret and people\ndidn't understand why either so let's\ntalk about that for a minute the shame\nthat comes with those feelings and\nspecifically like everybody feels that\nlevel of shame I don't care what station\nof life you're existing in and I would\nsay I'm unhappy and people would look at\nme like I'm crazy what are you unhappy\nabout and so then I just went in even\nmore cuz I was like they're right look\nwhat youve accomplished you've got this\ngreat family you've got a great life\nyeah you got the house you got the house\nthe car this and then that what's your\nproblem so then that's a hot cup of\nShame so then you just I just shut down\nthat's such a great note to put out\nthere because I think so many times we\nwe think like that about maybe our\nfriends it's like\nyou you have so much it's like that\nlanguage can be so yeah and I would\nsuggest anybody don't say that yeah\ndon't say that to somebody who's saying\nI'm having a tough time I'm\nstruggling you have this you have that\nno what's going on tell me\nhelp me understand yeah as ridiculous as\nit may sound to you right to that person\nthat thought has been repeated so many\ntimes abut it's become their reality\neven if it seems ridiculous to you like\nyeah it can be so foreign I get it yeah\nbut that is\nsomebody\ntrying to step out and talk so we have\nto have we have to be receptive is and\nnot to look at it you know it and that\nis like that's tricky too\nbecause really being able\nto meet somebody where they are versus\ntrying to meet somebody where you're at\nand that in itself is a skill set just\nbeing able to go okay hold it what am I\nmissing here let me just take a minute\nlet me blend with you let me join you I\ndidn't have that and it's nobody's fault\nyou know I'm hoping that\nanyone who thinks anyone in their life\nis struggling will share what you just\nshared with us with them to start a\nconversation to open up that dialogue\nbecause I think you just said it now and\nit brought a thought to my mind that\nreal love or real compassion is when you\nhelp someone get to the next step in\ntheir Journey yeah not in your journey\nyeah and that means being able to be\npresent with them wherever they are\nseems like aeign alien to you I really\nfeel like if anyone anyone in their life\nwho's\nstruggling please send that to them\nplease share that with them\nbecause that they need to hear it from\nsomeone else who's been there sometimes\nalso because if you've not been there\nyou don't you may not know how to say\nand and I think that's the other thing\nright the other side is one side is we\nsay oh you should be happy you're fine\nthe other side is we try and fix it yeah\nyou can't right you can't you can't\nsolve it there is no right you can't\nsolve it the best that we can do is like\nyou can try to meet them where they are\nand let's get help we can do it together\nand hold hands and and get them to\nsomeone professional mhh I will say it's\nreally healing\nwhen someone can join you it's\nalso having that boundary of\nunderstanding too that you can only do\nbut so much\nas well MH a person has to really want\nhelp MH and that's why I would tell the\nperson that might be struggling to just\nstay open to try everything you know\nwhat I mean like I tried\neverything until I found the thing yeah\nand just keep walking until you find the\nthing that obviously happens a lot later\non even though you start the book with\nthat but there was a time when you\nbelieved that Hollywood and having it\nall would do it would do it even before\nyou get to this point and so and also\nwhat I find fascinating is you grew up\nwhere like drug dealing was normal you\nwere in that scene you were meeting\npeople everyone around you was in that\nscene you weren't as from what I\ngathered from the book and the time\nwe've spent together there weren't a lot\nof people who were breaking that mold\nyeah no what was it that made you a\nbelieve that you could moved to LA when\nyou were 18 and break that mold and that\nyou didn't have to fall into the pattern\nof everyone around you and at the same\ntime secondly what was it that made you\nbelieve that that would solve it that\nthat was what was missing thank goodness\nalong the way I had great mentors like\nDonald hickin you know at Baltimore\nSchool for the Arts that was like Jen\nyou've got more talent in the pinky of\nyour little pinky that most people have\nin their whole bodies you know that he\nforced me to go you know into that\naudition for North Carolina School for\nthe Arts and that's what got me out of\nBaltimore so that I could\njust get away from that lifestyle and\nbreak that mentality right um and then\nonce I got immersed again into my\nart I was like wow I really love this\nand once I click into something like my\nmind goes you know what I mean and then\npoac came to La well he wasn't in La he\nwas in Northern California and Pac kept\nsaying you got to get out here it's\npopping you know what I mean and now\nhe's like you got to come out here and\nvisit and so I was like all right I'm\ngoing to get out there Pac was another\none too that was just like you got it\nJay you got it and I'm like all right\nI'm coming you so I told my mom I was\nlike you got two choices cuz I still\nwasn't quite sure yet you know I was\nlike I could go to\nLa and see if I can do this Hollywood\nthing or I could become a lawyer and\ntake all my Dramatics to the court right\nto the courthouse and she said we're\ngoing to La wow once I got to La I was\nlike you're\nhere make it happen and part of what\nmade me think that I could do it it\nwasn't just about talent but was just my\nperseverance and just my go I'm a\npitbull when it comes to when I want\nsomething you know especially in my\nyouth I'm not so much a pull\nanymore but in my youth you know once I\nput my mind to something I was like go\nget it and I really felt like how\neverybody else feels you know like yo\nonce I make it once I'm rich and famous\nyeah all my problems are going to be\nsolved you know what I mean I'm my\nproblems are going to be solved my mom's\nproblems going to be solved you know\neverybody's problems going to be solved\nI got this you know what I'm saying and\nso and that was a trip because that\nwasn't the case and I think that that's\nstill prevalent people feel like once\nyou get to a certain level of success\nyou are exempt from The Human\nExperience you are exempt from The Human\nCondition and the truth\nis that that is not the case and let me\ntell you I had an\nexistential drop in realizing hold it\nwait a minute hold it like my career is\npopping I got\nmoney I'm hot people are pursuing you I\ngot every dude everywhere want you know\nwhat I mean like I can have anybody I\nwant why am I not happy\nGod now this wasn't this wasn't the\nplan I couldn't believe it cuz that was\nthe whole idea you make it you pull\nyourself up by your own bootstraps you\nmake it and life's\ngreat and thank goodness at that\nparticular point in time I had Pac that\nI could go like we could share that\ntogether because he was going through\nthe same existential\ndisappointment he thought the same thing\nthat was like the beginning of just like\nwait a minute then if it's not this then\nwhat is it it's incredible like you had\na supportive friend in in Tupac you had\nthis amazing friend who was saying\nyou've got this you're talented and that\ncan really help yeah and at the same\ntime there's a whole another inner\nJourney yes that has to happen with it\nso that was externally it was empowering\nit was inspiring it was great to have\nsomeone believe in you and we all need\nthat yeah and at the same time it was\nlike this other reminder of the inner\nworld was not together yeah at all and\nbeing completely\nignored you know and it would take me\nyears to realize that that oh no it's\nnot just about what's happening on the\noutside Jada but if your inner world is\nnot your foundation it's all sand\ncastles you know I had a nervous\nbreakdown then I mov to Baltimore I get\na farmhouse there and I'm like okay I'm\njust going to get out of La I'm making a\ngeographical move I'm like I just got to\nget back to my roots you know I got to\nget back to my roots and then um will\ncomes along and I'm like maybe that's it\nI need a man you know and then it's like\nlatch on to\nthat it's like okay that's my new\nproac will you know he's G now it's his\njob to make my life\nbetter that doesn't work\neither so the ego just attached to all\nthese different exterior things until\neventually I'm you know I had to crash\ninto really having to look at the\nshambles of my inner world and rebuild\nand rebuild it and I say rebuild it\nbecause I feel like when we're born that\ninner world is intact but I had to\nreally strip it all down Jay to the Bare\nBones the bolts and just start inwardly\nfrom the bottom and just build and it's\nbeen a wild ride it's been a wild ride\nof what what that means and what that\nlooks like when it comes to your\nfriendship with Tupac which you speak\nabout so beautifully in the book and\nit's so wonderful because we get an\ninsight into him in a way that you don't\nas just a fan of the music right so as\nsomeone who grew up listening to him\nmyself it's like you get a certain\nperception yeah of someone who's\nintelligent but then also has this\ngangster lifestyle\nET but then again when you get Contex\nand you get to know about someone\nthrough someone who actually knows them\nright and what I really appreciated\nwhich I found fascinating was just how\nyou had the wisdom at that time to know\nthat someone would be a special friend\nwithout being romantic with them yeah\ntalk to us about because I feel like a\nlot of people struggle yeah he was\nobviously into you and when you first\nmet Etc the way you describe it but it's\nlike and and there's even one point\nwhere you dare him\nto and and I want you to tell that but\nbut what I find fascinating and what I\nwant to help people with here is like\nhow were you able to create and build a\nrelationship with someone knowing\ninitially that it was based on some\nattraction right but actually you knew\nthere was so much more to it how were\nyou able to allow that to unfold because\nI think so many of us get so scared if\nwe're not into someone go okay I'm just\ngoing to push them away or that person\neventually tries to make a move anyway\nbut here it was like this beautiful\nrespect this you both created that yeah\nwe both did we both had the intelligence\nyou know we were both really young so I\nthink I thank the great Supreme for this\ntoo\nthat there was\nno physical chemistry between us I mean\nliterally it was like and it what I I\ntry to explain this to people it was the\nsame for Pac it was just like when I\ndared him to kiss me he was I mean it\nwas like ew for us both right and we\nlook it's like how can that be how can\nyou feel so connected to someone of the\nopposite sex there was just this\nbeautiful understanding you know when\nyou can just sit with somebody in the\nroom you don't have to say a word mhm\nand there's just this level of comfort\nyeah we just knew each other the moment\nPac saw me and our eyes and I saw his\npeanut head across the\nroom at Baltimore School Arts it was\nlike I knew him already we just got each\nother I just understood him in that\nunderstanding and he understood me so we\ncould pull each other's coattails but we\ncould also join each other when I talk\nabout that joining when you can sit with\nsomebody and really feel like they see\nyou they understand you they care about\nyou and they're going to be there by you\nno matter what that was\nTupac he was going to ride with me no\nmatter what he was so authentic and and\nit's rare yeah that that level of\nauthenticity and he was so he had wore\nhis heart on his sleeve and there was\njust this amount of loyalty between us\nand I think also the fact that we both\nstruggled with mothers who were addicts\nand we tried to compensate for one\nanother of not having that peace and we\ndidn't boohoo about it we understood how\nto fill in the um voids without getting\nall hallm Marky about it you know what I\nmean you know what I mean and so that it\nwas so we just kind of knew how to flow\nwith each other in a way that was very\ncomfortable yeah it's always hard to\nkind of explain because it was like it's\nit's almost like he he was really a\nkindred that's that's the only way I\ncould really explain it and I feel so\nlucky and so blessed that I got to\nknow a being like himself in that way\ncuz he was such a dyamic\nperson but you can feel it cuz his music\nis still lasting for Generations now\nabsolutely you know so he he was just a\ntreasure teach us what's the difference\nbetween sexual chemistry and energetic\nconnection or authentic connection\nbecause I think we often think that to\nget close to someone you need that and\nhere it's not just about the fact that\nthere wasn't attraction or it was\nthere's more to it in that I feel like\nthere's a subtle difference in how you\nwere able to accept that there is a\nauthentic connection but it doesn't have\nto include\nphysical chemistry in order to have a\ndeep energetic connection if that makes\nsense as a I actually think in my\nexperience some of the deepest\nconnections that I've\nhad with men have not included sex\nwhatsoever right and I think\nthat sex sometimes can Cloud things a\nlot of a lot of things come in that a\nlot of people don't understand so you\nyou know whether it's like certain\nlevels of emotional trauma all these\nkinds of\nthings\nenergetically the the heart-to-heart\nspirit space has a level of Purity to it\nwhere even if things get difficult like\nwhen things would get challenging with\npck andai we could get to it\nfast and there's just a level of\nPurity and it's not attached to I want\nto make things right with you so I can\nsleep with\nyou that's yeah you agenda it's not that\nagenda the agendas are pure they're more\npure and it it has more space it's like\nI love you but you got to live your life\nMH I truth I can be truthful I can be\nhonest I think that with us I could be\nmore of\nmyself because one thing I knew about\nPac I never had to worry about you know\nwhen we had big blowups which we did all\nthe time he's coming back I never\nworried about that I never worried about\noh my God two no he listen whether it's\na year whether it's a year a week three\ndays I had to love all that Pac was he\nloved all that I was the good and the\nbad and he was going to be right there\nwith that and vice versa that was one of\nthe most beautiful aspects of our\nrelationship we didn't have to fake it\nwe didn't have to like pretend to be\nother things and we could be honest he\ncould pull my coattails I could pull his\ncoattails I could give him all the\npraise and love on him all I wanted to\nand not have to worry about oh oh now\nwe're going to have to have sex you know\nlike none of that because that wasn't\nhappening we just didn't we didn't have\nthat chemistry we just didn't have it\nyeah I think if Pac\nhad survived Vegas he and will would\nhave ended up being really good friends\nyou know they would have had a lot to\noffer one another and funny\nenough will was the only person when I\nstarted dating him P never like said\nanything if I dated anybody else Pac had\nhad something to say he didn't think\nanybody was good enough which I\nunderstand right but when I started\ndating will he didn't say anything which\nmeant to me in his own way\nhe\napproved yeah say anything right he\ndidn't say anything which was like okay\nnot a\nword which made me believe he approved\nyeah no I think it's it's so beautiful\nto reflect on that friendship because I\nthink it's so hope giving to so many\npeople who you know sometimes lose out\non those kind of relationships because\nwe don't see where else it can go oh it\ngo there's so much value there's so much\nvalue to that and there's the you know\nthe part in the book where you talk\nabout how you never got to be there when\nVegas happened like you weren't there\nyou hadn't talked for a year I think at\nthe time what you said yeah we had a big\nblow up what would you have said to him\nor what would you say to him or what\nwhat what did you want him to know or\nwhat were you so sure that he already\nknew and you're thinking to yourself I\njust wanted to remind him of this what\nwould that be I I didn't have to remind\nhim of anything he knew it Pac knew I\nadore him I have no doubt in my\nmind that he left this world knowing\nthat what a great feeling yeah that's\nnever been the issue for me MH we did\nthat dance a lot M sometimes have\nblowups and we were we're both very\nstubborn and I'll let people read the\nbook to yeah that blow up and and what\nled to that but um I think sometimes\nwhat sometimes still hurts is that me\nfeeling like maybe I\ncouldn't do enough once he\nleft like I'm thinking to myself oh my\nGod what would Pac have done like if it\nhad been me in a car in Vegas and got\nyou know he would have wreaked havoc so\nthat ego mhm sometimes comes into play\nlike just feeling so\nhelpless that he was taken in that way\nand there was\nnothing I could do to this day that\ngnaws at me you know for what it's worth\nI really believe that the way you write\nand we by the way everyone who's\nlistening and watching there is so much\nmore to unpack in the book which I\nhighly recommend you read as you're\ngoing through it and you'll come to this\npart but I I really believe that the way\nyou honor and appreciate and respect\nyour dear friend in the book is really\nbeautiful and special and it's like it's\nhard to describe as well but it's a\nreally wonderful lens into a human that\nis so you know Larger than Life in so\nmany ways and I wanted to also kind of\nthere's been so many misconceptions\nabout our relationship CU people are\nlike oh you know have a difficult time\nunderstanding that he and I could\nactually be friends but just wanted to\ngive people such just an Insight on you\nknow the beauty of our friendship that I\njust cherish to this day so very much\nyou know and I wanted to give people a\ndifferent Outlook just\nof who he was and I'll say who he is\nbecause he still exists like you know\nbut so I really wanted that to come\nacross yeah yeah well we got to\nunderstand him I think through you\nthrough the perspective\nof not a rapper not a icon not a better\na human and a friend and like what he\nwas like as a friend and I think that\nthat's a very intimate way to to know\nabout someone so I love that I I wanted\nto talk to you about you you mentioned\nthere you were like will was the only\nperson that Pac didn't Tupac didn't have\nan issue with yeah that I dat and I love\nthat and and you know how much I mean\nyou know I've always been open about it\nand we've talked about and I I met will\nthrough you and it's like I I've always\nsaid that when I met you and the whole\nfamily and and when I met him you were\neverything and more all of you are\neverything and more right uh and what I\nmean by that is everything I'd wanted\nyou to be plus so much more right uh and\nand he's that too in in so many ways and\nI think that it's really interesting\nbecause when you're talking about in The\nBook of like I I love the conversation\nyou refer to when you're like your your\nmom's like you know get him off the\nphone like she that's one of her moments\nbeing Adrian yes exactly but what I love\nabout it the most is that it is true\nthat from the out side as you set it up\nit looks like a fairy tale and and and\nit felt like that and what I find really\nfascinating about this again and again\nagain pretty much with everyone is that\nthere is no fairy tale love anywhere on\nplanet Earth on no planet and and you\nknow in our own little way I always talk\nabout this with me and rad too it's like\nwe'll do an interview together where rad\nwill tell me all the challenges she has\nwith me and she'll be crying and upset\nand then everyone in the comments will\nstill be like you guys are so cute no no\nno we we're not trying to say we're cute\nlike this is like real issu like real\nstuff that you know we've talked about\nit obviously You' SP ton of time in me\nand R in so I I think for me what's\nreally interesting is that yes from the\noutside when you see two incredible\nactors performers artist Talent get\ntogether you're like wow Powerhouse\ncouple everyone projects their\nexpectations uh you have beautiful\nadorable kids you know like Jaden's\nacting and he's he's like the cutest\nthing in the world and Willow too and\nit's like it's so interesting because we\nalso we like to build up our dreams in\npeople and we like to project our dreams\nonto people because I think as viewers\nit makes us believe that it's possible\nyeah and we live through people and we\nAspire for it not that we Aspire for the\nsuccess and the fame but that we Aspire\nfor the like well if they can get it\nright then I can get it right and it's\nnot it's an innocent absolutely belief\nthat we all have it's not a we all have\nthat inside of us so we have we all have\nthis I know that I had that like you\nknow I was I was searched it the other\nday and it's a term it's Disney princess\nsyndrome and I was like I've had Disney\nprincess syndrome like myself like a ton\nof times and it's so fascinating to for\nanyone who doesn't get the reference the\npoint is that every Disney princess is\nalways looking for her prince oh yeah\nand I would say regardless of gender\nthat's true like I feel that way where\nI've been looking for my princess or my\nwin or my award W or whatever it may\nbe and I wanted you to walk us through\nlike what were the stages and how would\nyou define the stages as you do in this\nbook your stages of your relationship\nwith will because I feel that that's the\npart that people get blurry because\nthey're looking at it through their lens\nbut you both have been so clear about\nstages of your relationship internally\nwhich I actually think is the hardest\npart and so how would you define the\nstages of your partnership with will\nthat help people understand like the\nconversations that you're having behind\nthe scenes from like being madly in love\nto you know yeahoo the stages of getting\nto the most\nauthentic and this\ndifficult so I just want to honor that\nfor a second like it's almost like\ntalking\nabout\nrelationships and the Romanticism around\nthe idea\nof relating is\nsometimes as detrimental as talking\nabout politics and God because it's such\na it's such a staple in how people look\nat marriage and\nrelating\nculturally right and all of the\nRomanticism around it and will and I\nhave\nbeen what I would consider kind of the\nrelationship goals mhm this romanticized\nversion mhm I had\nto in my\nown relationship with\nwill dissolve my\nRomanticism around what I thought\nmarriage would be should be and honestly\nwe really never had what I would\nconsider the ideal honeymoon stage you\nknow even though you do have the\nhoneymoon stage but our relationships\nstarted with some challenges you know\nbecause he was divorcing and then I life\njust took off like\na rocket ship we just took on this huge\nlife in our early 20s and where his\nFocus was really about hey I want to be\nthe biggest movie star in the\nworld and I knew that going into our\nrelationship and I knew would be\nsacrifices with that and then along the\nway and I talk about this in the book\njust having those different perspectives\nmhm and really trying to figure out how\nto reconcile those different\nperspectives and also deal with a lot of\nchallenges so I think one of the things\nthat I address in the book in regards to\nyou know people thinking that we've had\nan open marriage and we haven't had an\nopen marriage I talk\nabout starting off\npretty much early on in\nour marriage of having the need for\ntransparency and that is a big\ndifference between hey you can do\nwhatever you want you know versus like\nhey here we are very young people in\nthis place called Hollywood that has a\nlot of Temptation let's have a\npartnership around this let's be very\nrealistic of what this life is if we're\ntalking about we're going to be together\nforever and ever and ever that\nmeans there's going to be some\ntemptations that come up let's be in\nPartnership and let's talk about that I\ndidn't go into my marriage\nlike I am going to\nbe my husband is never ever ever going\nto look at anybody else you know I mean\nlike I I just I am just a realist in a\nlot of ways I know what it's been like\nfor\nme right when I first came to Hollywood\nand I could go into the clubs and have\nanybody just the the level of just like\nthat just that the like you know what I\nmean it's just like you just yeah\nintoxicating it's so\nintoxicating that's one now what I do\nbelieve that what people don't know that\nI talk about in the book a lot is that\nthere have been several breakups between\nwill and I will talks about it my 40th\nbirthday which was a big breakup for us\nwe were actually looking towards\nseparating and divorcing and we\nseparated the world just didn't know\nthen we had a\nReconciliation and then 2016 came and we\nhad the ultimate break but the world\ndidn't know mhm and I think that\nthat's where some of the misconception\nabout having an open marriage came into\nplay because we were living lives as\nsingle people mhm and the world didn't\nknow over the span of 12 Years of just\ntrying to figure out this thing called\nlove and marriage between will and I\nit's been a trip and I think that even\nwith that entanglement piece which I\ntalk about extensively in the book how I\nplayed a part in the conception of that\nNarrative of allowing myself to be\nportrayed as an adulteress allowing\nmyself to be portrayed as someone that\nhad betrayed will and that wasn't the\ncase we broke up in\n2016 he went on to live a life as a\nsingle man I went on to live a life as a\nsingle woman and then when we had the\ntalk at the red table I was going to go\nto the red table by myself MH to talk\nabout the anglan mhm mhm but will\ndecided he wanted to come with me and we\nwere going to then tell the world hey we\nhaven't been together and this happened\nduring that time well when we got to the\ntable will wasn't\nready he wasn't ready he wasn't ready\nfor the world to know that I had to\nrespect that well I didn't have to but I\nwanted to but I was ready I was ready to\nlet go of of the Persona I had created\naround myself that had put me in a\ngolden cage I wanted to let that go and\nso I had to stay on my journey I had to\nstay on my path while also\nrespecting that will wasn't ready so I\nsaid you know\nwhat this is my mess\nanyway I'm going to take this\nheat because guess what the heat is\ncoming either way whether when we decide\nto get divorced when we we decide to\nseparate whatever whatever this is my\npractice\nrun strip It\nDown Let It Go Jada and then let's see\nwhat's left I didn't have to put that\nparticular show out but I\nhad gotten myself so ready for that\nJourney for myself and to me that was\nmoving closer to my\nfreedom than holding\nback and\ncreating a narrative that I felt like\nwas just going to entrap me more and as\ndifficult as it's been because the irony\nis I spent so much of our relationship\nhaving this open communication between\nthe between he and I creating this\nbeautiful friendship of authenticity and\num\nhonesty and so to be labeled as someone\nwho had cheated on him was devastating\nbut it also put me in a\nposition\nwhere I had to learn how to let go of\nwhat anybody thought about me and really\nbe 10 toes down on understanding who I\nam and being able to walk in that no\nmatter what anybody thought about me but\nI needed that Journey for\nmyself you know it's kind of like\nthat is the walk when they talk about\nwalking on hot coals it's like creating\nthat level of when we talk about that\ninner world work and creating that like\nstrong Foundation within yourself of\nknowing exactly who you are no matter\nwhat other people think about you I mean\nI've gotten that to a certain degree and\nso that was a very challenging moment\nand I talk about it in the book because\nI feel like so many people are\nchallenged in that way of like how can I\njust walk in this\nworld and be okay with myself no matter\nwhat and I talk about the journey you\nknow really extensively in the book um\nbut there have been so many\nmisconceptions about my\nrelationship with will but I think that\neverybody suffers misconceptions once\nagain whether you're head of the PTA and\nyour husband's that doctor and you're\nthe lawyer you know what I mean and\nyou're you're like the Crum Dum of your\nfriend group or you know of your\ncommunity and so everybody's expecting\nyou to have a certain kind of\nmarriage and marriage is a\njourney you know and it's a journey\ntowards learning how to love\nyourself and learning how to love your\npartner\nand there's not one way to do it and\neverybody I think we do that Journey a\nreal disservice of trying to make it\nthis cookie cut thing like no no no you\ncan only do it this\nway and it's like each and every person\nin their relationship they have to look\nat what their relationship is calling\nfor and regards\nto what is needed to get your marriage\nto the love to the strength to the\nunderstanding to the\nFriendship into that unconditional place\nand the unfortunate part is that we\nthink once we get married like somebody\nis readymade they know how to love you\neven though they don't know how to love\nthemselves they don't know they don't\nknow how to love themselves but you\nbetter know how to love me yeah I want\nto highlight because I think it's often\ncan be missed at least is you know when\nyou had that conversation on red table\ntalk it would have been so easy to not\nhave that conversation publicly because\npeople would have their rumors yeah it\nwould blow over and then it would be\nover and I'm only raising this\nbecause I know how much for you it was\npart of the work you were doing yeah and\nthat's why I'm raising this because I\nthink what's really interesting is that\nwhen someone's trying to do deep inner\nhealing work yeah\nactually more often than not their\nexternal way will not make sense oh yeah\nfor sure because it literally looks like\nyou're setting yourself up to fail yeah\nbecause when you're really trying to\ndismantle the ego or you're really\ntrying to deconstruct the false\nidentities that we all build up me\nincluded all of us like when when that\nis there and it's being deconstructed\nsomeone would look at you be like why\nwould you do that\ndo I need to know and really I just want\ntolight and I want you to share about\nthat that the intention was healing AB\nthe intention wasn't to save face or the\nintent and I know this cuz we were\ntalking about it the intention wasn't to\nyeah wasn't to save face and it surely\nwasn't and I need people to know I\ndidn't ask Will to come to the table\nyeah yeah that was not my idea MH will\nwanted to come to the table cuz he\ndidn't want me to be there by myself he\nhad all the best intentions yeah and got\nthere and was I think his trauma\nresponse kicked in like I'm not ready so\nmany people were like don't do this and\nI'm like nah I'm doing it for myself for\nmyself because I want to live because\nI'm ready I don't\nwant this\nwhole thing\nanymore this whole Jada will I'm done\nwith that it was part of the work that I\nwas ready for and it was what I needed\nand everybody's in different places in\ntheir Journey also that's also a dynamic\nI had to look at Within Myself in\nregards to so was two things there's\nthis healthy J is like tear it down I\nwant I don't want that Persona anymore\ntear my ego down and there was this\nother part of me was like oh my God I\nneed to protect you know he's not ready\nyou know he's not ready my you know\ncodependency kicks in and I go this is\nwhat I do I'm the\nMartyr I can do the Martyr thing so once\nagain it's both things it's\nhealing like I'm\nready like I'm ready for I'm ready for\nthe tear down and then this martyr\nthat's like and I want to make sure will\nas long as you're okay I'm okay that's\npart of my relationship with my mother's\naddiction that I brought\ninto\nmy relationship with will that created a\ncertain Dynamic Within\nMyself in my relationship with him that\nI also needed to get my eyes on that I\ndidn't\nsee that that needed to be healed as\nwell without that\ntable without that\nmoment I would have never recognize that\nas painful as it was for people to\nwatch existential\ndisappointment in a collective I'm so\nsorry I wish it could have happened\nanother way I'm sorry that it had to be\nso messy in front of everybody I'm\nsorry\nbut I needed that what I got to clear up\nwhat I got to clean up what I got to see\nand to be able to sit here with you\ntoday and embrace it\nall and have so much acceptance for\nmyself for all of the choices I've made\nand people ask\nme if you had to do it over again would\nyou do it any different I don't think so\nhonestly like it knowing and talking to\nyou I found it to be so courageous and\nso full of strength\nbecause it was putting yourself on the\nspot like in no other\nway and I can't even begin\nto understand how uncomfortable it is I\nonly can from the conversation we had\nwell you were right there with me J but\nthe level of discomfort that you were\nwilling to put yourself in yeah in order\nto let go of an identity in order to let\ngo of a perception like I'm I'm I'm\nsaying it in these words because I just\nwant everyone who's listening watching\njust to to think about it for a second\nlike imagine you had to go in front of\neveryone you\nknew your family your friends your\nschool whoever it is that you're around\nyour people at work and you had to share\na\nsecret that wasn't a secret between you\nand the person you're with but was a\nsecret to them just think about that\nwhatever that secret is everyone has\nSecrets everyone has something you know\nand to do that requires just so much\ncourage and strength and it also shows\nthe I think you were just apologizing\nthat it was so messy I I also think that\nit is uncomfortable like growth is\nuncomfortable and like letting go\nshedding identities as uncomfortable and\nI'm not comparing my experience to yours\nat all because it's not the same in any\nway but I I'm trying to explain how like\na tiny PDA like my kind of like version\nof it is still as big I remember the day\nI told my friends and my family and my\nteachers that I no longer thought I\ncould be a monk and it sounds so small\nlike now looking back but at the time as\nsomeone who would like I was dedicating\nmy life you've met my teachers you know\nI'm dedicating my life I'm like doing\nthis big thing and then all of a sudden\nI come to the conclusion that this\nthought in my head of I'm not good\nenough I'm not a monk I'm not meant to\nbe like this isn't my path I have other\ndesires whatever it may be I I think I\nshould get married you know all this\nstuff and you're so you feel so much\nshame yes around the fact that you don't\nyou're not good enough and what are\npeople going to say yeah and even for me\nthat was just my temple community and my\nfriends and my family and even then it\nwas like as if someone was ripping my\nego out of my chest yeah because that's\nwhat it feels like it feels like an\nextraction of oh absolutely you know not\nthat I'm egoless now but that that was\nsuch a big way of crushing that part of\nmy\nego and so I just want people to think\nabout it through that perspective and\nI'm and I'm saying it because I think\nthat we all go through periods in our\nlife where people misunderstand us we\nall go through periods in our life where\nthe people we thought loved us and\nadored us will now be let down we all go\nthrough experiences in our life where we\nhave to let go of someone that we\nthought we were or what people thought\nwe were and those are going to be the\nhardest most painful times and actually\nif we can learn to be graceful instead\nof when our friends are getting divorced\nand we're like did you hear so we had\nthat couple of people in my my community\nback at home just got divorced the whole\nCommunity is talking about it yeah and\nI'm just like guys like we have no idea\nwhat was going on for the last 10 20\nyears let's give them Gra cuz you never\nknow when that could be you you have no\nidea when it could be you you know it's\nwe're so it's so easy to to judge and\nthrow stones at anyone and everyone like\nyou know and I just really feel that if\nwe have the ability to be\ngraceful and compassionate when other\npeople are doing that yeah we'll\nactually do it with ourselves and\nbecause we're hard on ourselves y we're\nhard on others because we're hard on\nothers we're hard on ourselves and I\njust for me I just want to see more\npeople be graceful for themselves and\nfor others\nbecause there's there's so much Human\nExperience wrapped up in it so any yeah\nthat's my hope too you know that people\ncan have more grace for themselves but I\ntell you I think one of\nthe saving factors was that you know\nthere were no secrets between will and I\nyeah yeah yeah and there were no secrets\nbetween my kids and I yes so the fact\nthat my family was absolutely aware of\nthe entire\nJourney it was a Saving Grace for me\nwhatever the world wants to think is\nwhatever you know will knows he was not\nbetrayed and my kids know that I did not\nbetray their father and that to me all\nthat matters yeah but it was quite a\nexercise of having to walk in the world\nlike that you know having people think\nthat that's what happened just having um\nthat exercise in that way has been such\na healing factor for me of just the\nlevel of self-love the level of\nself-worth that I\nhave because of what that experience has\noffered me and I'm not I'm not saying\nthat anybody else should do it on that\nlevel yeah you know but what I am saying\nis that there there are ego deaths that\nhave to occur in order to get to a more\nauthentic place of self-worth and\nself-love and I want to talk about the\nthe little gurus as you call them in the\nbook we start with Trey who you know\nthis book is dedicated to your daughter\nand the daughters of the people that\nread it and to your sons yeah and to the\nsons of the people that read it and I\nwonder what is it that you think you've\nlearned from\nTrey that you've been taught by Jaden\nand that you've been taught by Willer in\nyour journey with them all because you\nhave such a whenever I've seen you with\nthem it's it's you have such a deep\nbeautiful Rich relationship with your\nkids we were talking about that earlier\nyeah i' would love to know what is it\nthat each of them have taught you Trey\nhe has such an enormous heart and I\nthink what I love about Trey is his\nability\nto meet people join people where they\nare his ability to join me he has a way\nof seeing the best in people no matter\nwhat the best in circumstances no matter\nwhat and even in his most challenging\ntimes challenging\nrelationships having the\nwillingness to see the person's Spirit\nversus\npersonality and he's always reminded me\nof\nthat you know Mom you know that person\nyou know what I\nmean like you know what Trey you right\nhe and I have kind of been walking\nparallel we'll look over at each other\nand go I see you and he goes I see you\nyou know you know what I mean and so you\nknow we're the two in the family that's\nreally\nbeen on a intense walk spiritually and\nhe has so much perseverance in regards\nto understanding God MH finding his way\nunderstanding life I don't know I you\nknow he's just such a he's such a light\nyou know so iron sharpens iron he'll\nwalk in the kitchen he go mom look at me\nwhat what do you think I'm feeling\ntoday you know what I mean or he'll look\nat me and go wow you know you're you're\nlike bright what's going on with you\nlike he can just see me yeah and he can\nsee people you know and I be like wow\nhow did you see that yeah this is\nhappening this is he's like really you\nknow and he's he's just he's just such a\nlight he's just such a joy and so he\njust is always reminding me to look\nfor the best in people and I just adore\nhim which why he's a\nboness you know I love and then Willow\noh she's such a fireball I mean she she\nis like the mirror of the fire of my\nsoul\nwhen I tell you she is the mirror of\nthat like I get to see myself in her in\nso many ways what I love most about\nWillow is that she\nis to the point you know what I mean she\nis like she doesn't have a whole lot of\nplay play she's just like no no she just\nhits it on the mark where sometimes I\ncan be very flowery you know very very\ngentle and I also love how she loves me\nMH she teaches me a lot about love she\nteaches me a lot about when I talked\nabout being able to join like she\nteaches me a lot about how to join her\nand how to join others in ways that I'm\nnot used to I know how to join others in\nways that I'm used to but me having to\nlearn how to join her in a certain\nmanner I've had to come out of my\ncomfort zones and really be like oh man\nI'm very deficient here and her patience\nwith me with that deficiency she's so\npatient with me she's like it's okay Mom\nyou know sometimes I don't need you to\ntalk to me Mom just hold me I'm like oh\nthat's all you want me to do you just\nwant that's all I'm not used to that you\nknow I don't come from a family where\naffection you know that we don't we\ndon't hug each other and hold each other\nthat's not what we did but Willow yeah\nMa I don't need your\nadvice I just want to sit here hold me\nwhile I cry and then I have to learn how\nto I've had to she's taught me how to\nhold tears and really be able to join\nwith those tears and not Rebel and you\nknow like have them repel because then\nthey bring up my tears and so she's\nlearned she's taught me how to love my\ntears too you know those places within\nmyself that I haven't always been\nwilling to\ngo you know and now I cry all the time\nyou know and I call it the thong because\nfor so\nlong I wasn't allowed I didn't allow\nmyself to cry you know so she's taught\nme that and then there's\nJaden oh man Jaden he's just walking Joy\nMH I mean he comes in the room it's just\nlike\nJaden you know he's just walking Joy but\nhe was like that when I carried him I\nwas the happiest I had ever been in my\nlife when I was pregnant with Jaden and\nI think that had a lot to do with the\nenergy that he carries he has the\ncapacity to love\neverything and that\nis\ndifficulty challenging\npeople challenging\nsituations he has the capacity to love\nit all and find the beauty in it and I'm\nI'm talking about sincerely and it is\nlike that's a god-given gift that's you\ncan't teach that and so he just I was\nsitting you know I was just talking to\nhim to the other day and I was just like\noh I was reading this book emotionally\nimmature parents oh and I was like Jaden\nyou got to read this book your mother's\nhas been an emotionally immature parents\nright I said you got to read this book\nand he said um you know what\nMa he said things from afar can look a\ncertain way but when you put a\nmicroscope up on something and you look\nat it close up he was like it is such a\nweird\nshape weird beautiful shapes of things\nbut you get to see the intricacies of it\nand it's so much more and that's what\nyou are to me you're like this beautiful\nintricate organism that I love so much\ndon't ever apologize to me\nagain that's so you know what I mean and\nthat's just how his mind works you know\nand he comes over and he hugs me and he\nkisses me on my forehead you know what\nI'm saying and he's like you you gave\nbirth to me that don't ever apologize to\nme you know and he's like and I'm not\nreading that book I said I'm gonna get\nyou the book anyway I need to read\nit you know I'm always apologizing to my\nkids about all kinds of things I think\nit's so important for parents to\napologize say sorry you know know I've\ngotten in the habit every little like if\nI misunderstand something or there's\nlike this like little glip you know\nwhat I didn't quite get that then I'm so\nsorry I apologize I'm going to do better\nnext time with that and thank you for\nyour patience I think it's important you\nknow I wish my father had apologized to\nme more my mom apologizes too I actually\nlearned that from her she's apologized a\nlot and I actually said the same thing\nher now that I'm thinking about it stop\napologizing to\nme but isn't that that those are the\nbest relationships where someone does\nsomething yeah and the other person is\nlike it's fine yeah and that's what kind\nof it's It's that relationship\nwhere internally you're happy you heard\nit but you know you didn't need to but\nthe person still felt the need to say it\nand there it it creates so much Clarity\nand you know when I told Willow you were\ncoming on today she sent a little note\nthat I want to read you no uh because I\nwas I was talking to her about it and I\nwas talking to her about the book and so\nshe sent this little note that I want to\nread to you if that's okay oh my God let\nme get my napkin so she said this is\nfrom\nWillow and Willow if I don't read it as\nyou would in your amazing voice then\nplease forgive me I'm I'm also\napologizing to you in advance mom I am\nincomprehensibly proud of you and all of\nthe inner excavation you have done\nduring the writing of your\nbook there were many times during the\nprocess where you would read me sections\nand Deep Emotions would come up for us\nboth learning from you through learning\nabout you is one of the biggest joys of\nmy life you never cease to inspire me\nwith how wide you've opened your heart\nnot only to the immense joys of life but\nalso to the deep uncertainties and\nShadows with equal gratitude and\nGrace you have shown me true tenderness\nand true strength come from the same\nplace within and that is something that\nI aspire to show others thank you for\nloving me I'm so grateful for\nyou and uh the guru that's the little\nGuru right there there it is she loves\nyou so much and they all obviously love\nyou so much but when I read that and\nwhen I was reflecting on it it was just\nand as me and rad always talk about this\nbecause we've watched you and Willow so\nmany times\ntogether and it has been so inspiring to\nus to see that connection you both have\nand the openness you have with your kids\nand how well they understand you and you\nknow as you were just saying you always\napologizing but that's what they're\nseeing yeah they see that because you're\nso willing to share with them yeah I\ndon't I don't keep secrets from my kids\nI've let them see my deepest flaws and I\nthink that's important I mean and not in\nthe way\nthat we have to be careful with that too\nbut I mean just as far as like it's okay\nto be human not being afraid to show my\nhumanness because that's the one thing\nwith my mother that I have so much\ngratitude for that I could see her as a\nhuman being and my relationship with you\nknow my mother being an addict and\nme being able to relate to her\nas not just my mother but as a a woman\nyou know as a person and I think that\nwas one aspect that I felt like I really\nneeded to bring into my relationship\nwith my kids for them to see me as a\nperson we're in this together yeah it\ncomes across when I've witnessed it it's\nit's the most beautiful thing I could\nonly ever dream\nthat when and I are able to do that that\nyou know that we you will have what you\nhave it's it's really special it's\nremarkable to watch in in practice and I\nand I mean that and you know the message\nsays it all\nbut J I wanted you know I throughout\nthis book and and even in this interview\ntoday I think I was going to save this\nto say it later but I'm going to say it\nnow I've been\nsharing spirituality with people in\ndifferent ways since I was 18 years\nold\nand I was\nso young and immature then in my\nspirituality and I still am today and\nthat will always continue and I've just\nbeen fortunate to sit at the feet of\nincredible teachers and mentors and so\nany realization I've had earlier than I\nshould have had it is because of sitting\nwith elders and you know sitting with\nthe teachers I've introduced you to and\nI've rarely met someone who's as eag\neager for healing as you I don't think\nI've met a family that's\nmore where healing is the top priority\nright and it's such an interesting thing\nto perceive in someone because you can\ntell by someone's language and when\ntheir eyes light up and their body\nlanguage changes as to what they are\nmotivated by and ever since I met you\nfrom the first day we met backstage room\nfor red table talk Series 2 launch Day\nevent I was getting to host an interview\nyou Gan and\nWillow and I remember you'd ask me like\nwhat did you learn as a\nmonk and I'd said to you I was I was\ngiving to you the what I did learn as\npractices but I wasn't getting to the\nroot of it so I was explaining the\npractices like gratitude and meditation\nand mindfulness\nand service and you were you were kind\nof just like oh that's cool like you\nknow you and then I'd said to you\nbecause I felt a inner voice say that I\nshould and it was truly guided from\nwithin and I said to you I learned how\nto love God and that\nwas potentially the first I might even\nsaid that in that way to\nsomeone and you just like your whole\nbody language and your eyes and\neverything just changed and everyone\nelse was late so we were just talking\nand you were like I want to learn how to\nlove God too and you'd obviously already\nbeen on that Journey for decades like\nyou know and you talk about in the book\nwhere you started with the ethical\nSociety right you know that had been a\njourney that had been a part of your\njourney forever but it was so\ninteresting to me to meet someone and an\nentire family who is more focused on\nhealing and growth and and God in their\nown way in your in your own language in\nyour own in your own ways than than\nanything else I've never\nwe've never had a conversation that\nsteers too far away from that from any\nof those things which which says so and\nand we have fun and we have a good time\nand everything but but that and the\nreason I raised that is because I also\nsaw that when you were talking about\nOscars night in the book you referred to\nas the holy slap and the holy joke and\nyou've always looked at everything\nthrough the\nlens of how is this bringing me closer\nto to Divine I remember one conversation\nwe had about the feminine\nDivine and I'll never forget it\nbecause we at this point we'd been doing\nwe've been talking twice a week for like\na year and a half or something\nand we were talking about a specific\naspect of the divine feminine uh which\nis often left out or forgotten or or\nhidden I'd never seen anyone respond in\na way so\nsincerely and genuinely to a vision of\nGod as you did and you said with tears\nin your eyes you're like I've been\nlooking for this God for 25 years and I\nremember just going like I I could just\nsee the the genuine and the sincerity in\nyour eyes and I was just\nlike wow like I hope I can love like\nthat one day like that's actually what I\nfelt like as it was so inspiring and I\nknow that I've got\ncloser to Divinity through our work and\nthat's because of your\nseeking and you've pulled me closer to\nthe Divine through your seeking which\nyou've given me the greatest gift like\nfor years and years and years ever since\nI've known you and it's your ability\nto to look for that and so I wanted to\ntalk to you about you know I think when\nwhen it all went down on Oscar's night\nthe and you talk about this in the book\nand so I want to leave everyone to read\nabout it in full but the but the\nperception was that you were so offended\nthat you'd kind of urg this action which\nis bizarre in and of itself for so many\nreasons that you lay out in the book but\nI want to hear from you like what were\nyou actually hurt by about the condition\nthat you were going\nthrough and in that gap between we saw\nyeah and what we didn't get to see which\neveryone had their own theory on what\nwas actually your thought space or where\nwere you let me start with that was a\nreally layered\nmoment let me start with also\nthat there was so\nmuch that people didn't know in regards\nto what was happening with will and I at\nthat time and I I would leave for people\nto get the book yeah absolutely because\nthere's so much history mhm mhm and you\ngo into break it down I break it down\nwhy I did not exactly so much history\nthat I think would give people a lot\nmore context to understand that\nmoment let me also say that I know that\nwas a difficult moment to watch because\nof history that Chris and I had um in\nregards to the 2016 Oscar so white and I\nlet people read to get up to speed on\nthat but when I first saw Chris name\ncome on stage come up as one of the\npresenters I said oh boy I looked to\nwill and I like he's not going to be\nable to help himself this is going to be\nsomething I was like I knew I already\nknew and I was like okay so will had\nbeen going back and forth backstage all\nnight so when Chris said what he said I\nlooked to Will as if to say see I knew\nit right um and then I was like oh boy\nthat's not cool to like talk about a\nmedical condition that people there's\nnothing you can like it's it's it's not\nsomething that can be cured right and\nthat how many stories I had heard of\npeople you know young people committing\nsuicide and the shame and just how many\npeople suffer and you don't even know\nlike\nonce I had the condition and I saw how\nmany people around me had it I was like\nall these years I didn't know and people\nExpress the shame the level of Shame\nthey had around\nit I'm going to be\nokay as far as my condition as you can\nsee my hair is growing back that's what\nit does it'll grow it'll fall out it'll\ngrow back again pieces of my eyebrows\nwill fall out grow back you know I'm\nhaving a good moment right now my\nalipa is not as extreme\nas most people who are dealing with that\ncondition and I just felt like that's\nnot okay so I wasn't I wasn't upset\nabout me and I I don't remember actually\nrolling my eyes I think what people saw\nwas me looking at will going I told you\nI knew he was going to do that and oh\nboy here we go again mhm yeah that was\nkind of the re yeah you know oh here we\ngo but I wasn't upset about me I really\nwasn't it wasn't about me it was just\nall the stories I had heard and that I\ncontinue to hear about people who have\nsuffered from this condition and\nobviously you didn't want what happened\nto happen like I think that I'm just\nclarifying I know that I'm just\nclarifying it course it wasn't like I\nlooked at will and said you know you\nknow I know but and that's the kind of\nyou know those are the kind of moments\nof context that I think I lost sometimes\nlisten there was an aspect of that that\nI was as shocked as anyone because will\nand I hadn't been referring to each\nother as husband and wife since\n2016 I was like wife me that's right I\nam I'm okay that's right I am your wife\nand that kicked in I'm like yep here we\nare in that moment that that did happen\nI was like we came together we're\nleaving together you know that part of\nme that put everything else aside and\nit's like this is going to be something\nI need to make sure Will's okay we're\ngoing to get through this I had no idea\nthat that was none whatsoever and I came\nas family I actually didn't go to the\nOscars as Will's wife and I know for\npeople that's weird but what was going\non behind the scenes will and I have\nbeen set like we weren't living as\nhusband and wife since 2016 I was happy\nhe asked me to\ngo I was happy he wanted to share that\nmoment with me still and I was going to\nbe by his side and I think also people\nweren't really\naware of the journey that had taken\nplace after am mancipation as far as\nWill's concerned to it was a really\ndifficult movie and\nafterwards he decided to get into\ntherapeutic settings and he asked me to\njoin him because a lot of stuff was\ncoming up a lot of stuff from his past\nchildhood stuff I think people didn't\nunderstand that there was a history\nthere between he and Chris as well so\nthere was a lot of context that people\njust didn't have yeah you know and I'm\nGNA tell you something else I understand\nwhy people thought it was me I\nunderstand why people blame me I don't\nthink it's right but I understand you\nknow considering the narratives that\nwere out there that I was part of I have\nto take responsibility for that and I\ntalk about that in the book you know me\nbeing the adulterous wife that had you\nknow push will to his limit I get it so\nI couldn't even take any of it\npersonally and I had to put my myself in\nthe shoes of the audience and go if I\nwas looking at this how would what would\nI say I probably would have said the\nsame thing and then that made me really\nlook at like oh man like culturally\nwe're always blaming women like I had to\nreally go deep into that why do we do\nthat you know that men of\npower that have so much of their ownness\nin their life but when something bad\nhappens it's a woman fault you know what\nI mean it's so interesting you know and\nI had I really started to examine that\nbut more so just looking at that\nnarrative and taking responsibility and\nat the same time there was love and\ncompassion for Chris there was that oh\nyeah you know I talk about that in the\nbook I've worked with Chris I know Chris\nam I always a fan of Chris's stage work\nno but Chris as a person he's a sweet\nguy there was moment when Chris came\ndown to the end of the\nstage and you have to understand I'm in\ndeep confusion I don't know what's going\non because of me understanding the\ncontext of Will and I behind the scenes\nwhat just happened on the\nstage I'm worried about will I've\nnever seen that from him I don't know\nwhat's going on\nbut Chris comes to the end of the\nstage and he looks at me deeply\nsincerely and he says Jada I meant no\nharm and it was so sincere in his eyes\nI'm like that's the Chris I know that's\nthe Chris I've experienced that's the\nChris that a lot of people don't get to\nsee because people just see Chris on\nstage doing what Chris does but I'm glad\nI had that moment because with\neverything else that transpired\nafterwards you know his Netflix certain\ncomments and all of that I could hold on\nto that sincere moment so when we talk\nabout looking past personality and when\nsomebody has had that opportunity to\nshow you their heart to show you their\nSpirit that's the truth not all the\nother stuff that hurt misunderstanding\nconfusion might bring up so where my\nfeelings hurt\nwhen I heard what was happening as far\nas the Netflix of course my feelings\nwere hurt but I didn't take it\npersonally because I I can see his eyes\nright now as I'm talking to\nyou and that's the\ntruth of Chris's Spirit ji meant no\nharm I talk about it in the book it's\nlike you got to have Grace when we're\nhurt I'm not saying that I\nagree with how it was handled I don't\nagree with\nit but I\nunderstand and so my hope is that there\nwill\nbe such a beautiful opportunity for\nhealing and my hope is that that will\noccur as time everything needs time you\nhave two beautiful men who\nhave hurt\nand who have hurt one another but\nthey're both beautiful men and as I said\nbefore my hope is that these two very\ncapable beautiful men at some time\nfigure out how\nto\nresolve this whole thing of the present\nand of the past you know cuz life is\nabout healing man it's like life's too\nshort and you know sometimes conflicts\ncan really amplify love they really can\nI know it has for me and that's why I\ncalled that chapter the holy slap the\nholy joke the holy slap and the holy\nlessons\nbecause through all of this conflict\nthat I've been in the midst of all this\nmisunderstanding that I've been in the\nmidst\nof it's helped amplify love within my\nheart it's made my heart more\nelastic hate\nand I've really have been able to\nunderstand how hate has a ceiling you\nknow hate\naggression um wow you know it it has a\nceiling whereas love\nis wow but it takes so much\ncourage and it's so easy to go into\naggression it's so easy to go into you\nknow hateful feelings it's\neasy\nand I can't blame anybody for doing it\nand I have no judgment because guess\nwhat been there done that you know J\nwhen uh you started today you said that\nyou know this is your journey from being\nunlovable to trying to find love again\nand it's really it's really the true\nstory of all of our Lives of just we're\nall on that journey of being\nunlovable thinking that if someone loves\nus we'll be fine then think that if we\nget or achieve this we'll be fine then\nthinking if I love this person perfectly\nthen I'll be fine and it's like we we\nkeep filling in that yeah the sentence\nbetween unlovable with to lovable with\nso many versions and I think what this\nbook this Memoir does so beautifully\nhonestly is you show us every version\nthat you tried to fit yes in that Gap\nright every version every version that\nyou tried to fit in that Gap\nYou're just showing us the reality of\nwhat that comes with like the pain that\ncomes with trying to fit everything into\nthat Gap and I appreciate you for doing\nthat because it's it's hard to not turn\nevery story into a fairy tale ending\nperfect ending and there isn't that here\nand I think that that's what truly makes\nit relatable it's what truly makes it\napplicable wherever we are on our\nJourneys on that spectrum and anyone\nelse's and it's why I said that I I\nreally hope that anyone who's on that\nJourney themselves will pick this book\nup and be able to notice which Gap\nthey're trying to fill it with yeah and\ncome back in if that sounds if that\nfeels right if that that's really right\nit's like CU you're right it's like all\nthese it's like okay that didn't work\nlet me go over here let me try this and\nthen it just nope you got you you got to\nheal you\nand you got to really get with a power\nhigher than yourself and I want to thank\nyou for really being so helpful in so\nmany ways Jay in regards to you talk\nabout I mean we've been on such a\nbeautiful journey together in that way\nof\njust learning and deepening our\nrelationship with God individually\ntogether um I so appreciate you for that\nI mean you have been so instrumental in\nthat way I genuinely can't take any\ncredit like I'm not even I'm not even\nand that's not and that's not even me\nbeing that's not me being humble or\nmodest it's it's me just saying that in\nthe same way as you feel people came\ninto your life to you know accelerate\nthat journey and reconnect you like you\ndid the same for me and radii like in a\nin a physical way you all of you have\ngiven us so much family we've celebrated\nso many thanksgivings together we've\nwe've had you over for sa every you know\nfor days and days and weeks and months\nand years and you know you've given us\nso much and I I don't I think that's\nwhat I think this book does I think\nthat's what we will do for our\nfriendships is that I got the\nopportunity to build a friendship with\nyou that was based on nothing else but\nhealing\ngrowth and the Divine and that kind of\nrelationship just has a different energy\nit's really when there's else there's\nnothing else that would have made our\npaths cross yeah we don't work together\nwe don't have we don't do business\ntogether we don't have the same friends\nlike you know but but but this this\nright I'm so grateful to watch someone\ndo the hardest\nwork and I'm going yeah I need to do it\ntoo you know like and I admire it\nbecause I see it from that perspective\nwith you and I always have that you're\nnot trying to take the easy way out\nyou're not you're not just looking to\nfix it with a Band-Aid you're not just\nhoping it will go away you're like no\nI'm gonna sit there with him that is\njust I just that is such an\nuncomfortable place naturally for 99% of\npeople yeah I'm in all of you because of\nit and I always will be and I'm just I'm\nI'm so happy that you decided to put it\nin into writing\nbecause this isn't about clarifying it\nisn't about people getting a sense of\nwhat really happened that's not what\nit's about it's about how can we sit\nthrough that discomfort that we're going\nthrough in our life and and choose\nhealing and growth even when it's the\nhardest thing and the farthest thing\naway from us listen if things get\ncleared up from reading this book great\nbut that's not the purpose because I I\nactually don't think you can you can't\nyeah yeah you you can't it'll just be\nmore stirring up whatever other things\nright um and it's really which is why\nit's even more important to really be\nable to have a strong sense of\nself right and not to be looking for\nexternal\nthings to be to\nsubstitute what you have to have inside\nin order to know your place in this\nworld this place is\ncrazy and should try to make the\nmaterial space the material world align\nin a way for your comfort that's it\ncan't start there it has to start within\nyourself that how you\nsee and what you attract to you is in\nalignment with what is happening here\nright but looking for the world to buoy\nyou up or accept you in a certain manner\nno yeah like I said before this can just\ngive some little breadcrumbs to help\npeople people get to a sense of\nselfworth that gives them that Comfort\nno matter what is\nhappening you know if you've brought\nfreaking chocolate chip cookies with\npeanuts in\nthem to the school\nFair even though kids might have\nallergies and the school them wrote you\na letter and said don't\nbring products with peanuts and you made\nthem with love you right you made them\nwith love yeah and now the mom group is\non your\nneck you can be okay you can be okay\nwith your victories and you can be okay\nwith the inevitable challenges that life\nis going to deliver it's okay either\nway you're okay you're worthy you're\nlovable peanuts and all so Jada one of\nthe things that you mentioned was that\nyou went went to the Oscars as family\nyeah but not as a wife yeah and I wanted\nto ask you how do you define the status\nof your relationship now\nand what is it like you know right now\nof course we've had it's been an intense\ntwo years and we've really\nbeen doing some deep healing together\nand that's why I was saying before the\nidea of\nhow just really disruptive situations\ncan\namplify love in a certain manner because\nit kind of forces you to have to dive a\nlittle deeper that's what we've been\ndoing we' just been growing together\nand see what happens then see what grows\nfrom there you know but like I said in\nthe book it's like we have this\nbeautiful\nfriendship\nand we really look at our marriage as\nbeing the Cornerstone of family we're\nboth kind of coming up with different\ndefinitions of what marriage means for\nus we're still figuring all of that out\nyeah but the beautiful part is that\nthere's been some really deep healing\ngoing on yeah I mean you know that I\nmean at the end of the day that's what\nit's about marriage is so much about\ngrowth like really learning how to grow\nemotionally like emotional\nmaturity spiritual maturity and there's\nthis spiritual bond there I mean we've\ntried our best to get away from each\nother I mean I mean our best and we just\ndon't want to\nso we are defining it the way that works\nfor us and I think getting comfortable\nwith not being concerned\nabout what anybody else thinks about it\nwe have this life partnership and every\nday we're trying to figure out what that\nmeans you've both talked about how you\nfeel like you're a mirror for each other\nyeah and when I've spoken to will as\nwell it's like he feels like you're the\nperson who knows him to his core\nabsolutely and he know and he knows you\nto your core like you know everything\nyeah that potentially there is to know\nabout each other and you're obviously\nstill learning yeah what's really\ninteresting about that is some people\nwould say well why not just get divorced\nyeah everybody's always like why don't\nyou just get divorced and it's like\nthat's like quitting I don't think\nthere's any person that could embrace\nthe best and the worst of me and be able\nbe willing to hold space in the way that\nwill hold space for me in the way that I\nhold space for him and I know that most\npeople probably go into their\nrelationship as like you are here to\nplease me and yeah our relationship\nisn't quite\nthat you know it's like it's more about\nthere's no greater mirror I could have\nthan will he doesn't I can't I can't get\naround myself just like he can't get\naround himself with me and I think that\nthat's just\nbeen what this has been all about like\nit's been a deep clearing like really\nhaving to look at yourself in ways in\nthat mirror that sure we talk about this\nall the time would it be easier to go\nand find somebody else and have a more\npleasing more comfortable relationship\nmaybe but would that get me to the\nperson that I really want to be I don't\nthink so and I'm not saying that\neverybody's relationship is supposed to\nbe that I'm not here to say that I'm\njust saying that that's what my\nrelationship is that's something I\ndesire to get to\na a deeper part a more spiritually sound\nemotionally\nsound and really understand\nlove\nunconditionally and the thing that I've\nlearned about unconditional love you\ncan't really understand what\nunconditional love in ideal\ncircumstances to really get\nto what it is to\nlove yourself and someone else\ncompletely with all that's\ndivine all that's human all that's\nperfect and all that is deeply\nflawed and have full acceptance for it\nall I tell you this\nis you know marriage is not for the\nfaint at heart it's just not and it is\ndefinitely I believe I\nbelieve you know different people get\nmarried for different reasons so I'm not\ntrying to say why anybody else should be\nmarried but for me the holy path of\ngetting to a Divine aspect of myself in\npartnership with Will and it seems like\nwill wants the same for himself and it's\ntaken us you know I mean we got together\nat what I was\n23 okay\n23 when I first decided\nto commit\nmyself to Willard Carol Smith Lord\n[Laughter]\nJesus so young so young we were babies\nbabies trying to figure this out and you\nknow what's interesting about young\nrelationships you create these young\npatterns that get so like these really\nyoung immature patterns in yourself and\nhow you\nrelate to your partner and then you\ncreate these Dynamics between one\nanother that it takes a while to like\nreally be willing to look at that stuff\nand dissolve it and let it go and mature\nand grow it takes some real feel like\nself-\ninventory\npatience\ncourage right\nbecause you're breaking down\neverything all your romantic ideas\neverything you thought you know\nrelationship or marriage all your\nromantic\nfantasies you know\njust you know Blow Up in Flames\nbut it's really been freeing\nit's really been freeing\nto see what's more\ntrue right am not saying that I know the\ntruth yet I just feel like I'm seeing\nmore of what's true you know as regards\nto what love and partnership is about\nbecause I was definitely one of those\npeople that's like you're here to make\nme happy and when you don't do it that's\na problem and that and that's a normal\nsetup that's how we believe\nrelationships are and you know I've\ntalked about it before and I I put it\nforward in my book this idea that we\nthink pleasure is The Ultimate Gift of a\nrelationship but really purification is\nand that's a really tough idea for\nanyone including me I like I haven't\nperfected that idea for me to wrap my\nhead around and I can honestly say that\nI love rad and you know you you've seen\nus both together and everything but the\ngreatest gift rad gives me is a\nmirror and a purification of R can call\nout my ego better than anyone or\nanything and I know it's coming from a\ngood place rad can show me my flaws in\nthe nicest most supportive way possible\nand can receive it back from me yeah and\nthen I feel like because of her I'm\ntrying to be better getting better not\nfor her that's right for\nmyself it's almost like the person that\nyou live with knows you so deeply or the\nperson that you've seen has seen you in\nall circumstances in all situations\nknows you the deepest I will say rad\nknows whether I woke up and meditated in\nthe morning yeah like rad knows whether\nI got angry or frustrated at night after\na phone call like rad knows that and if\nI use that to my advantage of am I\nbecoming am I growing but it's such a\nhard concept for people to understand\nbecause it's it's so\ncounterintuitive to the pleasure seeking\nmind that we've been condition to Chase\nand again I'm not saying we shouldn't\nhave pleasure in relationship that's not\nthe point I'm making I'm just saying\nthat there's more to it there's another\nlevel there's definitely more to it and\nI think we've talked about this before\nyou and I as far as people believing\nthat romantic love is the highest form\nnow I believe that romantic love is an\naspect right of a higher form but it I\ndon't believe that romantic self\nromantic love itself is the highest form\nright I believe within the highest form\nyou can have romantic love but that\nromantic love is not of the highest\nright and that's all I've\nbeen examining and exploring with Will\nand really trying to understand the\npower of unconditional love friendship\nlike there's something about friendship\nfamilial love that\nis\nbeautiful but when two people can have\nan\nagreement around Divine\nLove Like Love of a source greater than\nyourself MH that you want to be\nconnected to and then you decide that\nyour relationship is going to be\nconnected to that same\nSource oh boy now we're on to something\nnow we're on to something but to think\nthat romantic\nlove can hold all of the difficulties\nand challenges alone and I think that's\nwhy so many of us get into these power\nstruggles and why there's so many\ndivorces and why that you know just all\nof this strife and relationships you\nbrought up something that was really\nimportant and it's the idea of Rody when\nshe can kind of pull your coattails with\nlove and I think that's it takes a lot\nof work to figure that out like to not\nbe offended when someone shows up\nimperfectly and that those are those\nkind of\npieces um within relationship like we\nfeel like people are supposed to come\nreadymade you walk down the aisle and\nit's like he knows how to love me you\nknow I know how to love him you know and\nnot making room for that space of growth\nthat is inevitable people are going to\nmess up people going to do stupid stuff\npeople G to say stupid stuff now when it\ncomes to abuse and all of that that's a\ndifferent story right but people who are\nwilling to learn how to love each other\nbecause I really do think that's what\ncommitted relationships about marriage\nor\nnot I'm committed to learning how to\nlove myself learning how to love you\nright and then learning how to cultivate\nthis relationship that we\nhave with that Essence with those\ncomponents then that's a beautiful\nthing that's what I believe\nthe holy path of relating is all about\nand not everybody wants that yeah yeah\ntotally you know some people really just\nwant the Romantic version of it and\nthat's okay too absolutely absolutely\nthat's okay too you know but um for me\ndefinitely on that path of looking for\nsomething deeper Within Myself\nmostly yeah how did you let go of\nthat design desire for romantic love but\nthen hold on to the Friendship because I\nfeel like that's a journey that is so\nhard whether someone stays married or\ngets divorced or like like you both are\nyou described yourself as best friends\nyeah how did you hold on to Friendship\nbeing able to let go of the Mirage that\nyou had earlier or even not even the\nMirage the reality of what you had\nearlier as you talk about in the book\nyou know the chemistry the spark I think\nso many of us are trying to hold on to\nthat but you've let go of that and then\nyou're saying but we've held on to the\nFriendship the the mirror the work the\ngrowth that sounds like the hard way\nthrough it I think it's how people show\nup and people don't always show up\nperfect\nclearly but one thing about will and I\nwe're just not willing to give up yeah\nit's like I'm lucky that we just want to\nhave each other in in one another's life\nright you have moments of\ndisharmony but if you know that you're\nnot\nwilling to not have that person in your\nlife you know you got to put forth the\neffort and you got to put forth the\nwork to transform whatever is not\nworking so we always make the\ndecision to take that one step closer to\ndiving more\ndeeply to learning how to love\nand most of the time it has more to do\nwith\nself-inventory having to go in the\ncorner and look at oneself and then come\nback and\ngo I was\ntripping whether it's I'm sorry or I had\na\nmisunderstanding can we look at this now\ntogether because now I've looked at it\nin my corner alone and I've seen my part\nand I want to talk to you first about my\npart AB c and d right and then\ninevitably usually your partner go well\nyou know I could have done such a such a\nsuch and so when you have an agreement\nthat's really unspoken of like I want\nyou in my\nlife and I want to have good times with\nyou and I love you then that's the\nenergy that\nnurtures and keeps one\nwilling to just keep working at it so\nthere's that deep love and the great\nthing is that Will's got a great sense\nof\nhumor you know what I mean he's got a\nreally good sense of humor so he has a\nway of being able to help me get out of\nmy funk MH but I'm kind of like you talk\nabout this a lot with Rody where I kind\nof have to take my time like I'm not\nalways ready to talk right away I need I\nneed to like sit I need to be with\nmyself I need to kind of like work\nthrough my thoughts and all of that\nwhere will is always ready to talk yeah\nI like to go deep he likes to get funny\nthe great thing about him he can go deep\ntotally absolutely and there are times\nthat I really like to play and have fun\nyeah so we we're like these energetic\nFields you know I'm Earth and he's Sky\nyou know we are your\ntypical yin and\nyang you know that you know there\nthere's this great chemistry there\nbetween us that just works and but when\nit doesn't work oh man oh man oh\nman you know what I mean those moments\nwhen it's just like ah but I think\nthat's just inevitable in every\nrelationship you know but it just\ndoesn't look traditional I think that's\nthe point that's that's the part where\nit's like it just doesn't look\ntraditional it works there there's the\ntrust there's commitment there's there's\nunderstanding and at the same time it\ndoesn't look it doesn't look traditional\nI don't know I'm be honest with you\nthere are\naspects of traditional relating that\nabsolutely\nwork but I think in this day and age I\ndon't know too many\nmarriages that are traditional I really\ndon't mhm everybody is trying to figure\nit out right and I think everybody's so\nscared to talk\nabout all of the different ways that\nthey that they're trying to figure it\nout I know so many people who are like\nmarried but not living together married\nbut have decided to have other partners\nI know so many people and have for a\nlong time that are trying marriage in so\nmany different\nforms and my whole thing is figure it\nout for you MH marriage is not a cookie\ncutout like uh formula besides I do\nthink that there's some\nStaples you know\nlove but even that let me take that out\nfor a second there's some people who are\nmarried strictly for business purposes\nI've seen that too as long as there's\nagreement between two people and how\nthey decide they want to be together\nstay out of it it has nothing to do I\ntell people all the time don't look at\nmy marriage as being\ncontagious whatever I'm doing does it\nmean you got to be doing that you got to\nbe doing the thing that works for you\nand I feel like every\npartnership two people have the right to\nfigure that out for them and it's so\ndifferent in norms and different\ncultures and different backgrounds I\nmean like for me and Ry we spend a lot\nof time apart because she likes to be\nback with her family in London and I\ntravel for work and so we discovered and\nagreed very early on in our relationship\nthat when I work she would often visit\nher family back in London and she loves\nit and she's wants to be with her mom\nand dad and her niece and nephew and her\nsister and brother-in-law and everyone\nand I love my purpose and I want to be\ntraveling I want to be working I want to\nbe moving and I remember so many times\nin our relationship people would be like\nis everything okay yeah like and then\nwe' go back to London people be like why\nis your wife not with you or people like\nwhy is Jay not with you and everyone\nstarts\nthinking that there may be something\ngoing on and it's actually like well no\nthis was our agreement this is something\nwe've sat and talked about and figured\nthings out and actually we love distance\nbecause we get excited to see each other\nagain it's refreshing it works for us\nand again it may not work for anyone\nelse someone may say I need my partner\nby my side every day fair enough and\nsomeone may say I want to travel more\nthan you do or less but we just found\nthat having honest conversations between\nus and knowing why we were making\ncertain decisions even though they were\nabnormal to our community right the\ncommunity that we grew up in where the\nway we live is very\nabnormal even though it's just about\ntime\napart the point was we had an agreement\nthat worked for us and I think getting\nto know you both I I can honestly say\nthat I feel like you guys are both\nalways honest and communicative with\neach other on what your Agreements are\nabsolutely and that's what we have been\ndiscussing today as well that you know\nthere's there's always been\nthat that openness to do that oh yeah\nwell I talk about it a lot in the book\nabsolutely and I think that a lot of\npeople had a lot of misunderstanding as\nthat we talked about earlier I believe\nin regards to open relationship and\nbeing able to be with whoever you want\nno that that's not what was happening\nand I think a lot of times that people\njust did didn't know that we had agreed\nto not be together as we were trying to\nfigure out are we going to be separated\nare we going to be divorced then we\nwould reconcile and then we would break\nup again and it's all this back and\nforth between us that we didn't share\nwith the world a lot you know and I\nthink\nnow people are just going to have to be\nokay\nwith our marriage is not traditional in\nthe sense of\nhere we are married but not you know\nwhat I mean\nand you know as I'm on my path and\nWill's figuring his thing out we've\ndecided to hold space for each other and\nas we're trying to figure out who we are\nWill's lived a lot of his life for other\npeople I've definitely lived my life a\nlot for other people and really having\nthis time for me I need this what I've\nbeen able to discover about myself in\nthe last five years six years I think\nnow I've needed this time to really\nconcentrate on me and really developing\nlike a relationship with\nmyself and I feel like the better\nrelationship I have with myself the\nbetter relationship I have with everyone\nelse in my life including will and so I\ntalk about that a lot in the book you\nknow just a lot of the misunderstandings\nthat have occurred rightfully so because\nit's been a lot of mixed messaging and\nthen people are like well you know you\nguys have been on the red you know and\nall of that we see you we never knew\nthere was a breakup you weren't supposed\nto that was between us and at the end of\nthe\nday we're always\nfamily no matter what so I think that\nthe way we are deciding to be in a\nunion people just going to have to get\nwith\nthat it's probably not going to look\nlike what someone else is doing and\nthat's just the truth of the matter you\nknow and we're good with that I can\ndefinitely say that whatever\nrelationship anyone is in that we all\nget to a point in our relationships\nromantic or\notherwise where growing together becomes\nthe greatest priority it doesn't matter\nhow we got there how we got there or\nwhat's happening\nit's just that I think that is the key I\nwas saying to that when I was writing my\nbook eight rules of love it was like the\njourney I went on through writing it got\nme to that point of recognizing that yes\nthe goal of every relationship in my\nlife is simply to teach me something I\nhave been unwilling to learn and the\npeople that I'm closest\nto come on Jay yeah the people that I'm\nclosest\nto are the only ones that can push me\nthat's right or pull me to seeing that\nwhether it's your mom whether it's your\ndad whether your sister brother partner\nwhatever it may be\nand for me I also discovered through the\nwriting of the book that the greatest\nlove story and I really really believed\nthis when I was writing I was like the\ngreatest love stories in the world are\nactually not romantic the greatest love\nstories in the world are generally human\nsacrificing thems in the service of\nothers like you see people take on great\nsacrifice to help people that they may\nnot even meet or you see people like\ntaking on a mission or a movement that\npositively affects so many people that\nthey were never even connected to like\nthose are the greatest acts of Love or\nthe act of love that a parent has for\ntheir child that they extend themselves\nand express and that unconditionality\nyou don't really see romantic love being\nunconditional generally it's interesting\nthat trying to practice and understand\nwhat unconditional love is and figuring\nit out which we all are including me but\nthat Journey was really powerful for me\nto recognize that the more unwilling I\nbecome and the more I hide from the\nlessons that I'm meant to\nlearn the harder it gets and the harder\nthe lesson gets and the test gets and it\njust gets bigger and worse so it gets\nbigger and you know the truth of the\nmatter is is like I'm always going to be\nby Wills side you know when I think\nabout like if something ever happened to\nhim it's like I'm going to be right\nthere if he needs me I'm going to be\nright there always that's just an\nunbreakable fact that's the bond we have\nyou know we've tried to break it we in\nevery which way you can think\nof we don't want to\nbe in this\nlifetime without one another it's just\nnot going to happen\nso we're trying to figure\nout what that looks like for us and that\nthere's something really powerful about\nthat I got to be honest as difficult as\nit's been as there's been times that\nI've hated that fact having\nsomebody that forces me to have to raise\nmy Consciousness evolve my understanding\nof love to deal with the fact of that\nBond\nthat's a god-given\ngift because me and God got to get with\nthat God has to be my mentor on How to\nLove Will and myself and care for the\nrelationship that we have Through The\nEyes of the great Supreme not the way\njayen wants it and\nso that has been a beautiful\nsurrender that I've really have had to\nsurrender because I really feel like\nit's by the\ndecree God was like oh no in this life\ntime that's your person like it or not I\ndon't\ncare so it set me up to have to break\ncertain ideas of my own\npersonality and my own ego and really\nsurrender to what the great Supreme\nwants to teach me about love\nand about\npatience and about care kindness\nconsideration forgiveness of myself\nforgiveness of others it's\ndeep and I'm so grateful it's been a\npainful Journey no doubt but the gifts\nthat I get on the other side of that\ndiscomfort and when I get on the other\nside of the discomfort I go I get it I\ncould not have gotten that gift\nor that\nunderstanding without that trial you\ngave me I just ask God these days can\nyou make it a little easier I think I\nthink I'm getting the groove of things\nyou know what I\nmean just like come on you know but I've\nalso realized too that I'm getting to\nthe\npoint that when\nthings tumultuous things come about I\nsmile and I go okay you got a great one\nfor me on the other side of this bad boy\nyou know what I mean you just start to\nrealize it it's never failed in that\nway I remember asking Swami I said do\nyou think I should get divorced wow I\ndidn't know you asked him that I sure\ndid I asked\nswamy and he said you know\nJada people take their vows very lightly\nthese days and he said something to the\neffect that\nyou know when we stay committed to the\nvows that we\nmake we find what we\nneed and I was like okay and I I just\nstayed on track I was just like all\nright let me let me just keep digging\nlet me keep going and he you know he's\nright for my journey yeah can't say for\nanybody else for my journey because he\nsaid oh this is what he said he said\npeople end up as friends in the long run\nand they're holding hands walking each\nother home and that's how I feel I feel\nlike will and I are walking each other\nhome as life Partners well J I want to\nshare one last thing with you if I can\nso earlier I had a letter for you from\nWillow okay and I also have a letter\nfrom Will I may need your help with you\nmay have to reenact some words because I\nfeel like you'll be able to channel okay\nwill better than me I will not try and\nimpersonate him because it won't go well\nbut this was for you J I think it was\nwhen we found out that you coming on the\nshow right I I was happy that he was\nable to send this to me and so I could\nshare it with you and I'll just read it\nand let's let's do it in his words okay\nso you'll have to explain this one for\nus I know but I want the audience to\nknow so he said congrats\ndink\nokay so let me just tell you what dink\ntell us that before yeah let me let me\ntell you what dink means oh he's so\ncrazy so when we play\ngolf he's my favorite person to play\ngolf with so when we play\ngolf when I hit my driver it goes\n[Laughter]\nDink and so that's why he calls me dick\nwho who's better at gol he's definitely\nbetter okay but I'm I'm getting to a\npoint where I can you know I can\nchallenge him in a good way on a couple\nof holes for sure all right okay\ncongrats dink I just turned the final\npage of\nworthy and damn gonna get you to do the\ndamn how would he say it\ndamn I just turned the final page of\nworthy and damn it is amazing to realize\nthat despite having lived most of my\nLife by your side I still found myself\nshocked and stunned and caught of God\nlaughing then\ninspired then\nheartbroken I was all over the\nplace it's one thing to hear anecdotes\nat a family\nbarbecue but it was truly overwhelming\nto take in your story potently condensed\nin this way you are one of one a rare\nblend of power and delicate Sensitivity\nI know it wasn't easy to excavate the\ndepths in that way I applaud and honor\nyou if I had read this book 30 years\nago I definitely would have hugged you\nmore I'll start now welcome to the\nauthor's Club I love you\nendlessly\nnow go get some Mero and take a\n[Laughter]\nrest he know I can't have no\nmerow that's\nbeautiful that's why I can't divorce\nthat\njoker yeah there's one line that really\nhit me mhm and I want to hear obviously\nhow you felt but he said if I had read\nthis book 30 years ago\nI definitely would have hugged you more\nI'll start now how how did it feel\nlistening to parts of that you know one\nof the things I talk about in the book a\nlot is\nperspective when we got married we had\nto be 28 29 we had such\ndifferent\nneeds no right or\nwrong you know will was very driven\nbut I got married because I was pregnant\nand I wanted a family and that I must\nsay that was the one\nthing we both wanted to create a family\nwe never had but what we thought took\nhaving a healthy family will believed\nman as long as I get out here make money\nget the biggest house make sure you guys\ndon't need anything that's how you have\na great family\nand my thing was like no but love and\nyou know me and you we got to you know\neverything was centered around feelings\nlove we just couldn't find agreement\nbecause we thought we had two different\ngoals around What it\nTook and\nso to hear him\nsay that he would have hugged me\nmore is me hearing him say he would have\ntaken a bit more time to listen and\nunderstand that doesn't mean that he\nwould have to be off his path but just\nto take a little bit more time to listen\nand understand and I think when we were\nyoung cuz that was the same way I mean\nwhen we were\nyoung you just think your way is the\nonly\nway and I think that where willing and I\nare getting to now is understanding\nthat our ways my way is just one way his\nway is just one way and then how do we\nlisten to each other more to blend those\nways I was very careful and\nnot going into\nromanticized regret after hearing that\nline I wish I could have hugged you more\nbut I will do so now right I like no no\nno you're not going to go into\nromanticized regret wow\nbecause what I know as a\nfact is that every step\neverything that has transpired between\nus has been absolutely\nperfect all the\nbeauty and all the\nugly to get us to a place that we're\nthat we're coming\nto you know and you could you could go\noh I wish that you know I had known this\nwhen I was younger that's the whole\npoint of Youth you don't\nknow you know what I mean and then to\nreally just to be able to embrace like\nthis time in my life and in his life and\ncoming into to Newfound wisdom and enjoy\nthat but I'm so glad\nthat getting closer\nto that\nblend between us and that's what I'm\nsaying it's\nlike who else am I going to grow with\nlike that and be able to have those that\ndeep cherished moment of like when you\ncan look back at where you were 30 years\nago and where we've\ntraveled to get to this moment right\nhere right now at this beautiful\nfamily without\nhim I wouldn't have had Jaden Willow\nTrey oh my God\ngosh there are no greater Treasures than\nthose three and then all of the\nMagnificent experiences he and I have\nhad together the great ones and the not\nso great ones you know but they're ours\npart of our\ntapestry one thing I talk about in the\nbook going to see Ruby D when I needed\nsome marital\nadvice and she told me laugh now because\nyou're going to laugh\nlater and it's so true I didn't know\nwhat she was talking about then but\nshe'd been married at that time for 50\nsome\nyears a see was gone Azie Davis had\npassed on you know and one of the things\nshe said to me I said what's one of your\nbiggest regrets and she said I wished I\nhad laughed with him more and that never\nleaves my mind mhm to just find ways to\nget through the bumpy to get through the\nbumpy stuff and let's get back to some\nlaughter and some Joy Jay I'm going to\ngive this to\nyou in case you want to read it again\nyeah uh and I want to thank you\nfor you know\nyour vulnerability your openness today\nand the vulnerability in the book that\nyou shared so profoundly today but the\nbook you get to weave the tapestry\ntogether and the lessons and where they\ncome in your life and I\nreally I really believe that anyone who\nwill Le read this book\nwill gain access to a much deeper\nunderstanding of\nthemselves as a\nmirror and also get an opportunity\nto reframe rethink renew ideas\nperspective\nthoughts about their own Journey that is\nall that I want like we have so much\nfear\naround allowing people their Journeys\nbecause we can tend to get hurt within\nthem along the way but it's inevitable\nand the more that we can have acceptance\nfor the reality that life is a\njourney nobody is meant to be\nperfect it baffles me well actually let\nme take that back it doesn't baffle me\ncuz I've been\nthere it doesn't baffle me I've been\nthere where just being afraid to allow\nwhat is to be and that is embracing our\nhumanness MH and learning how to love\neach other through our humanness all\nthis cancel culture and all of this that\nis purely a\nrejection of aspects of\nourselves and a rejection of\nhumanness and that's where where\nunconditional love has its most power\nright but if we can learn to do that\nwith us starting with ourselves right\nlearning how to have unconditional love\nfor ourselves and have acceptance for\nour journey and that's what I want from\nthis book I'm just putting it out there\nlike\nhe this is what my journey looks like\nand it ain't\ncute this is what I've learned along the\nway and this is how I learned how to\ngain selfworth and to feel worthy about\nit all all about it all about it all\nJay every piece of it and that's all I\nwant for everybody else it's okay it's\nokay you don't have to come down on\nyourself and just because we stumble and\nwe might lose our way doesn't mean we're\nlost forever thank you Charles Xavier\nfrom X-Men for that\nstatement I love Xmen I do too Charles\nlaid it out just like that I had to put\nthat quote in my\nbook but it's true and that's all I want\nfor everybody we are all\nworthy embracing it all every aspect of\nour journey that is the thing that makes\nus worthy we're harder\non others because we're so hard on\nourselves we're hard on ourselves\nbecause we're so hard on others and that\ncycle keeps repeating itself point out\nsomeone's floor because we're pointing\nthem out in ourselves but not looking at\nthe growth we're trying to make and the\ngrowth someone else trying to make the\nhealing Journey that they're on and the\nhealing Journey that we're on and as you\nwere just saying that what came to my\nmind was that we all have to take the\nsame steps but on our own path and I\nthink what this book does so gracefully\nis show your steps which reminds us all\nthat even if we trip and we fall which\nwe inevitably\nwill there's still another step after\nthat that we can take\nand that ultimate step\nis what you just so beautifully put the\nstep of recognizing that all of it was\nworthy all of it was part of that\nJourney\ntowards selfworth and that you're\nloved you're loved and you're held no\nmatter what through all of the scrutiny\nand through all of the I don't know\nstones that were thrown at me and as\npainful as all of that\nwas what a beautiful\nGauntlet to get me to the\nunderstanding that it's only our self\njudgment that's the true\nenemy and I got to cure so much of my\nown self- judgment through all of that\nit's almost like being like Wonder Woman\nyou\nknow you know what I mean it's like the\ngreat Supreme makes it so that\nyou're Invincible\nto all the criticism anything else\nanybody has to say about you when you\nget that true\nsense of\nworthiness doesn't matter what anybody\nelse thinks doesn't matter what other\nmisunderstandings are happening and I\nwant that for everybody it's a\nsuperpower but it's not given without\nthe Tri it's beautiful it's beautiful\nit's beautiful thank you I'm so\ngrateful and thank you Jay thank you Jay\nyeah thank you Jay you've been so good\nto me through it all thank you thank you\nthank you thank you thank you so\ngrateful to you too as well for letting\nme be a small part of the journey\nbecause it's one that you give me The\nBravery To Tread myself so thank you if\nyou love this episode you'll love my\ninterview with Will Smith on owning your\ntruth and unlock the power of\nmanifestation anybody who hasn't spoken\nto their parents or their brother call\nthem right now don't think you're going\nto have a chance to call them tomorrow\nor next week that opportunity with my\nfather changed every relationship in my\nlife"
