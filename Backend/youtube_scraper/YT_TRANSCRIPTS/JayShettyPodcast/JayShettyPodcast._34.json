world to me and help us make\nbetter\nbigger brighter content for you in the\nworld subscribe right now the number one\nHealth and Wellness podcast J sh J shett\nthe one the only\nJett why is it that we all want\nsomething we have goals we have things\nthat we believe are\nimportant but we struggle to focus on\nthem yeah well there's there's a couple\ndifferent things I think the first thing\nis that we hold oursel back from is we\nhave a lot of fears and fear years when\nyou really start to dive into them like\nyou you mentioned in the beginning of\nthis like I started talking with you\nabout like the East and and you started\nI remember you told me in 2017 like you\nshould read the bat G so I literally\nwrote it I got it like the next week and\nread it while we were traveling and so\nthere was that and and as I was writing\nthe book I was like what's the thing\nbecause the original title of the book\nwas the psychology of taking action\nbecause I was looking at the mindset\nMentor podcast I have 1,400 episodes and\nI was like it's just me speaking for\nalmost every single one of them and I\nwas like what do I teach like what do\nwhat do people want from me and I was\nlike it's almost all like tips and\ntricks understand yourself to take\naction because everybody who's listening\nto a podcast has the awareness of I want\nto improve I want to get better I want\nsomething different but how do I do it\nand so I I started saying okay if taking\naction is what the book's going to be\nabout like why don't people take action\nin the first place and one of the things\nthat that pops up for people is fear\nlike they're just there's some sort of\nfear that pops up for them and I had a\nconversation with one of my friends who\nwent and lived in the tribe with a tribe\nA native Brazilian tribe in the middle\nof Brazil and so he had to fly into a\ntown he had to hop on a boat and go for\ntwo days on a boat in the middle of\nnowhere and he started talking to me\nabout these things that he called Primal\nfears and intellectual fears so like a\nprimal fear is is pain or death is\nattached to it and we don't really come\nup with too many Primal fears in our\nlife nowadays intellectual fear is like\nwhat we deal with all day long which is\nyou know the the the fear of rejection\nthe fear of failure the fear of uh not\nbeing accepted the fear of success we\nhave all these fears and and all these\nfears are made up in our mind\nand so I was listening to I'm pretty\nsure it was sad Guru I was listening to\nand I was like I I put on and I was\ndriving around in Sedona as I was\nwriting the book I was there just to try\nto get my whole mind together was by\nmyself writing it and I was like looking\nat fears and trying to figure them out\nand one thing that he said that like\nreally hit me more than anything else is\nokay I've identified my fears and the\nnext thing is well how do I overcome\nthese fears and if it's an intellectual\nfear the the fears that exist in our\nminds is you can't overcome something\nthat doesn't exist\nand so we create we basically wake up in\nthe Boogie we wake up in the morning we\ncreate the boogeyman which is like the\nfear of success the fear of failure\nwhatever it is and instead of actually\ntaking the action that we need to and\nfocusing on what it is that we want we\ntake all of our focus and put it towards\ntrying to overcome this fear when in\nreality the fear doesn't even exist in\nthe first place and so I think the\nbiggest thing for most people is like\nthe fear is keeping you from from\nfocusing um but there's also like the\nidentity of who you think you are and\none of my favorite things is challenging\nwho I think I am the time like I love\nthe story and I put in the book of Jim\nCarrey when he decided to be uh in man\non the moon then uh there was the man on\nthe moon was a movie where he ended up\nplaying uh Andy Kaufman and there was a\nwhole documentary that was done on this\nand they curbed it for like 20 years cuz\nit was so off the rails of how crazy he\nwent and and what he did was he it's a a\ndocumentary called Jim and Andy that's\non him playing the role on man on the\nmoon so Andy coffin was a guy who was\nonce a live and the crazy part and about\nAndy Kaufman is he also played other\ncharacters so as Jim Carrey playing Andy\nKaufman who played like Tony Clifton and\nother characters but the thing that\nhappened with him was that he would\nnever break character so he was a method\nactor so for four months he played as\nthis real life person and even to the\npoint where his driver that would pick\nhim up in Hollywood and drive him to his\nhouse said that whoever he was playing\nat the time that they stopped recording\nwhether it was Andy caufman Tony Clifton\nhe would play that person the entire day\nwhen he when he was driving him home\nthat night and he picked him up and he\nwas still the same person not Jim Carrey\nanymore and so what happened was he he\nended up like and it gets kind of crazy\nwhere he ends up doing therapy sessions\nwith Andy coffin's real daughter and his\nfamily to like help them overcome his\nsudden death and so what happens is they\nstop recording four months later and\nhe's like I don't know who I am and he\nlost who he was and he's like I don't\nknow my beliefs I don't know what makes\nme happy what makes me sad what pisses\nme off anymore he's like I've kind of\njust lost who Jim Carrey is and that's\nkind of like his spiritual awakening\nthat you've seen him go through over the\npast 20 years and he realized if I can\nlose Jim Carrey then who the hell is Jim\nCarrey and he realized that Jim Carrey\nis just basically a character that he's\nplaying all the time that is completely\nsomebody else and he could just wake up\nanother morning and act like he's\nsomebody else and so I think that two of\nthe things that really keep us from\nfocusing on stuff is we get really\nafraid and fearful of making change or\njudgment or failure and all that and the\nthe other thing is like who we actually\ntruly think we are um we'll hold us back\nfrom taking either the action that we\nneed to or you know staying in the exact\nsame position that we're in I love that\nI want to go down both of those routes\nbecause I find them both fascinating for\ndifferent reasons and I want to go down\nthat more spiritual ethereal Journey as\nwell because yeah but but before we do\nthat I want to make sure that so if we\ntalk about the fears that people are\nexperiencing as you said a lot of the\ntime it's an intellectual fear it's not\nreal but it feels so real feels real\nyeah like when someone says like oh I'm\nreally scared about what if I get\nrejected from the job or I'm really\nscared that my partner is going to leave\nme or I'm really scared that I don't\nfeel good enough or smart enough to to\nmake it in whatever field it is those\nfeel extremely real yeah how do you\nprocess a feeling that feels real even\nthough it may be intellectual yeah well\nso that's the beautiful thing about\nbeing a human and I think it's and you\ncan correct me if I'm wrong but think\nit's actually in the Baki gives an\nexample of a lion attacking you at or a\ntiger attacking you at night and you\nknow one of the examples I given the\nbook is is similar to that where it's\nlike if you think about it if you we've\nall had this we have a really intense\ndream like you're walking in a forest\nwhatever it is and you see a lion it\nstarts running after you you know you\nyou you run from it you turn you look\nover your shoulder it's getting closer\nyou're still running from it you turn\nyou look over your shoulder just as\nteeth are about to to to dig into you\nand you wake up in the middle of the\nnight and your body didn't move at all\nbut you're sweating you're out of breath\nyour heart rate is intensely going and\nthe amazing thing about being a human\nyou know they usually say what in any\nCas is what your biggest strength is is\nalso can be your biggest fault the thing\nabout humans is that we can project our\nminds into a future that doesn't exist\nyet and so what we can do right now is\nwe can sit here you know we're in this\nstudio everything is amazing we have\nfood Water Shelter clothing everything\nbut if I'm like as a lot of people do\nlike if I'm starting business right I\ncan sit here and I can think well I\nreally want to start this business but\nthen I start playing out all of the\nthings that could go wrong which is what\nwe tend to do not what goes right but\nwhat could go wrong when I project my\nmind into that future the crazy part is\nthat my mind and my body are constantly\nconnected so my my brain is sending\nneuropeptides to my body and creating\nhormones as if that moment is actually\nhappening right now and so what happens\nis we tend to as humans as a protection\nmechanism we tend to project oursel into\na future that is fearful that is scary\nand that fearful scary feeling usually\nKeeps Us in the exact same place and so\nwhat I always say is like if I'm going\nto imagine the worst that could happen\nwhy don't I at least try to see the best\nthat could happen and so if I'm going to\nnotice myself the awareness of like I'm\nreally in a lot of fear right now with\nstarting this business and I'm I'm going\nman what's the Worst That Could Happen\nwell then I might as well close my eyes\nand say like what's the best that could\nhappen and what would it feel like to\nstart this business and to be able to\ncrack a million dollars in a business\nand how proud of myself would I be to\nbreak a million dollars in sales and to\nbe able to build this and travel with my\nfamily and provide what I've always\nwanted to provide and and if I'm going\nto feel the feelings of fear why don't I\nalso just try on feeling the feelings of\nsuccess in getting there and so if we\nnotice it's an intellectual fear the\nfirst the first piece that I always say\nis there's there's three pieces there's\nthe awareness of it okay I'm aware that\nI'm in a state of fear I need to\npractice to get myself out of that okay\nif I notice myself in in a state of fear\nwhat's my practice to get myself out of\nit well I'm going to go ahead and I'm\ngoing to calm down and and and take six\ndeep breaths and I'm going to connect\nback to my heart and I'm going to ask\nmyself like what's the best thing that\ncould happen that's the practice to get\nmyself out of it and then the last piece\nis repetition so it's awareness it's\npractice it's repetition if I do it over\nand over and over again eventually I\nstart to rewire myself so like one of\nthe things that that I found in myself\nyears ago that I didn't like was was\nthat I judge people and I didn't I'm\nlike man I love people like I love I try\nto do I try to be of service as much as\nI can but an immediate thought that will\ncome in my head sometimes is like\nJudgment of somebody that I don't know\nand I just judge them and I was like I\ndon't like that pattern I want to change\nthis pattern Within Myself it's a\nweirdness I become aware of what I want\nto change and the one the first time I\nreally did it I was at a grocery store\nand this guy had this like Bluetooth you\nknow like the long Bluetooth it was in\nlike as if he was you know making cold\ncalls at an office but he was at the\ngrocery store and immediately the first\nthought in my head was judgment and I\nalways say you can't change your first\nthought but you can change your second\nthought so I noticed a judgment as a\nfirst thought awareness my practice that\nI decided for myself was I'm going to\nforce myself in my head to say three\nthings that I like about this guy I\npaused myself in the moment I found\nmyself in a pattern that I don't want to\nbe in anymore what are three things that\nI like about this guy and I said it and\nthen I went on about my day and I\nstarted doing this over and over and\nover and over again and one thing that I\nnoticed is that my first thought started\nchanging to less judgment and more\nacceptance because ultimately that's\nthat's what I really want to work on is\nmore acceptance and loving of people and\nof myself and so I think it's um it's\nbecoming aware of it once you're aware\nof the the things that you're trying the\npattern you're trying to change what's\nthe practice that you're going to take\nyourself down and then noticing that\nyou're just going to need to do it over\nand over and over again but the one of\nthe biggest Keys is to give yourself\nGrace as you're doing it because a lot\nof times we make we are become aware and\nthen we judge oursel and we beat oursel\nup for it so I think it's it's giving\nyourself a lot of love and grace and\ngoing hey I've noticed this pattern\ndon't worry we're going to change it\nlet's go on this practice and just\ncontinuing to do that yeah so well said\nI think so often we get scared even of\nhaving the thought of what could be\npossible because we're scared that it\ncan't be possible and we just find\nanother thing to be fearful of and I\nlove this idea of what you're saying\naround transforming your thoughts\nbecause I've definitely the more and\nmore I've studied books the more and\nmore I've I've read and I've thought\nI've just discovered that all of our\nfailure and success in life is based on\nour most repeated door and one of my\nbiggest questions to most people I meet\nnow is what is your most repeated th and\nmost people don't know the answer\nbecause they're not aware in your words\nand a lot of people who do know will say\nit something like I'm not good enough I\ndon't like the way I look I am ugly um\nwhatever whatever else it may be for\nthem right and so we're either aware and\nit's negative\nor we're unaware because it's so\nsubconscious and I've started to\nrecognize that most of the thoughts we\nhave are not that different they're the\nsame thought that comes in a different\nvoice a different tone a different\nvocabulary a different language but it's\nthe same repetition yeah and so I've\nstarted to really think about what's my\nmost repeated thought and how can I be\nmore as you are saying how can I be more\nselective about it and how can I choose\nit more effectively rather than just let\nit be\nsomething that's kind of just coming up\nyeah and it's and it's like not don't\nidentify with your thoughts you know\nlike one of the things that I don't\nremember where I heard it before but the\nway I like to think about it and and\nI've heard you say before even like a\nlot of people say like oh I struggle\nwith meditating and I've heard you say\nbefore where it's not about mastering\nyour thoughts it's not about making your\nthoughts go away it's just becoming\naware of your thoughts a little bit more\nBEC because when we close our eyes you\nknow about 60% of our brain is visual we\nfor visual things to see so when we\nclose our eyes it kind of turns off a a\nlot of parts and so thoughts usually\ncome up and we become aware of those\nlike one of the things that I've been\ndoing a lot recently is like trying to\nbe in as much silence as possible like\nI'm just trying to be as much silence as\nI possibly can because I feel like\nthat's where a lot of my awarenesses and\na lot of my answers come from and so\nwhen you sit there and the analogy that\nI love when you start thinking of your\nthoughts is it's like sitting on the\nedge of a mountain and down below\nthere's just a road going that that\nyou're looking at and sitting on the\nedge of the mountain is like meditating\nor just sitting in silence and just you\nknow looking at your thoughts and you\ncan watch the cars go by the thoughts\nthat go by and not have to be attached\nto them you don't find yourself getting\nsucked into the red car that just went\nby you just watch the the cars go by and\nthat's the way that I try to to see my\nthoughts which is okay I'm going to\nwatch them go by I'm not going to\nconnect to them but I can look at them\nand be like is this thought which you\nknow about 90% of our thoughts are the\nsame as yesterday is this thought\nhelping me in trying to get to where I\nwant to be in Life or is this thought\nholding me back from trying to get\nwant it not well theny as that guy the\npodc said I my first St I control my\nsecond so what what would I prefer my\nsecond thought to be yeah I I think you\njust hit the nail on the head like\nthat's what it is for me it's whether\nyou've understood that you're not your\nthoughts or not that can be quite hard\nfor people because I think we're so\nclose to them but even if you can\npractice distance through meditation or\nmindfulness the real win is being able\nto look at a thought and say is it good\nfor me is it not helpful like you just\nsaid like I think that is the wisdom of\nit that can I evaluate everything that's\nrepetitive in my mind and ask myself is\nthis useful is it helpful is it allowing\nme to move in the direction I want\nbecause chances are a lot of what we're\nsaying is actually doing the complete\nopposite and then you go oh wait a\nminute even though it's interesting and\neven though I could get lost in it I\ndon't want to waste time and therefore\nI'll move in the other direction you\ntalk about procrastination in this book\nand that again going back to your\nearlier title is a block against the\npsychology of action yeah and we all\nhave a friend or maybe we are that\nfriend that constantly puts things off\nwe postpone we procrastinate we say I'll\ndo it another year I want to launch a\npodcast someone's been saying that for\ntwo years there's someone listening\nright now who wants to start an\nInstagram page they put it off for six\nmonths there's someone listening who's\nlike oh I missed out on the clubhouse\nthing and then I missed out on the Tik\nTok thing and now I'm missing out on\nwhatever the next thing is and we\nprocrastinate hoping that one day will\ncome what have you learned about\nprocrastination through your research\nwhen you were writing the book that has\nhelped people break that cycle because\nit seems to apply to so many of our\nLives I mean the thing about it is this\nif I've always I always like to be like\nvery extreme in examples because if we\ncan go extreme then it makes a lot of\nsense but I always tell people like and\nand I always say it like hey I've I've\ngiven this when I used to give a lot of\nspeeches I would be in front of people\ni' say hey what's the chance of you\nmaking a million dollars this year give\nme give me numbers and everyone's like\n0% 0% 0% 1% there's always 1% it's like\nfive and that's like the most it'll get\nto and I said okay I'm going to give you\nthe most extreme example but I just want\nto see what happens okay what's the\npercentage chance of you making a\nmillion dollars this year legally and if\nyou don't everyone that you love\ndies and everyone's like 100% 100% a\nthousand a th% I said what changed the\ngoal didn't change the time frame didn't\nchange why you're doing it changed would\nyou wake up in the morning if everyone\nthat you loves life dependent on it and\nbe like yeah well maybe I should scroll\non Tik Tok for a little while no you'd\nbe like I'm going to take action\nimmediately and so it doesn't need to be\nlike a fear of losing everybody but\nwhat's really behind that is like why\nlike why they're they're doing it like\nif if I a reflection of anyone who\ndoesn't know Jay like you're one of the\nhardest working people I've ever met but\nyou have a really strong why right and\nthat's like one of the best parts about\nit where it's like when I see J I'm like\nthis guy has he has this internal\nfeeling of like I want to change the\nworld and you work so hard trying to do\nit and that's the one of the most\nbeautiful things about you is like\nyou're wanting to change the world and\nyou have a really strong why to it and I\nthink that if most people could figure\nout like oh yeah well I want to do this\nthing why do you want to do it and my my\nvery first one-on-one coach um used to\nsay to me he would say what's your why\nwhat's your why why are you doing this\nwhy are you doing this you would like\nhammer it home in my head and I was like\nwhy do you ask this so much and he would\nalways say cuz if your why is strong\nenough your how will reveal itself if\nyou know why you want to do something\nhow it's going to be done you'll figure\nout it doesn't matter things are going\nto get in your way there's going to be\nobstacles there's always going to be\nobstacles there's always going to be\nchallenges there's always going to be\nmoments of like I don't know if I can do\nthis but if your why is so strong it's\nlike I don't care what comes up in front\nof me I'm going to get it done like most\npeople they want to be motivated and I\nhave come to to hate the word motivation\nbecause motivation is so fleeting like\nwe can wake up and we can listen to a\npodcast we can get you know read\nsomething be motivated and then\nsomething can happen to us and it's gone\nwhich just disappears what I want to be\nis I want to be driven like when you see\na driven person like you see it in their\neyes like yeah they're not stopping and\nthe difference between a motivated\nperson and a driven person is that the\ndriven person has this why that they\nwant to see have happen in the world or\nin their life or for their family and so\nI think if people are like I want to\naccomplish this goal the very next\nquestion is why and then go why why why\nwhy why why and go deeper into it um an\nexample I give in the book is I had a\ncoaching client years ago like eight\nnine years ago and he was like Rob I\nwant to make $100,000 this year I've\nnever made it and I was like why and I\ntook him through what's called seven\nlevels of why I just keep asking why why\nwhy why why and um it went from I want\nto make $100,000 a year because I've\nnever done it before to the eventual\nthing was he had just got into a divorce\na couple years ago both of his young\nchildren lived in a bad part of town\nwith his ex-wife he wanted to regain\ncustody because he was afraid that both\nof his children would be killed in a\ndriveby and he was so terrified of it\nthat that was his actual true why and so\nit wasn't the motivation I I didn't have\nto talk to him say Hey you know how\nclose you'd make $100,000 this year I\nsaid hey how close are you to providing\nmore safety for your children this year\nbecause he wanted them to move in with\nhim he wanted to be able to provide for\nthem and to make sure that they were\nsafe and so I think that if we just ask\noursel why do I truly want to accomplish\nthis goal it kind of reveals itself and\nit makes a easier to take the action\nyeah for sure I mean I you know and I\nappreciate all the kind words but I can\ndefinitely say the only thing that's\nkept me going is my why because I think\nthere are so many things that either\nmake you want to give up or slow down or\nbecome lazy or complacent and when I\nlook at it and someone asked me this I\nwas I was sitting with an with another\nCreator end of last year and he was just\nlike to me Jay why do you even do\nanything anymore like what what's the\npoint like it seems like you you're good\nlike why do you need to do anything and\nI was like we've just got to the start\nof everything like I just got to the\nbeginning of where I need to be I was\nlike we've just got to a point where we\ncan connect with lots of people but we\nneed to give people the step-by-step\nprocess to transform their life and now\nwe can take them on the journey because\npeople are listening they're engaged we\nhave a community we have a connection\nwith people but when I started out we\ndidn't have any of that so I see it as\nwe just got to the start of where I want\nto be because and and it was just\ninteresting to me that so many people\nstruggle to find their why and I think\nit's\nbecause we don't no one's and you just\nsaid your coach helped you do it it was\nsame with me my art teacher at from age\n11 to age 18 he was my art teacher at\nschool and every time I'd paint\nsomething or Draw something or do a\ncollage or a graphic design and whatever\ni' do the first question you'd ask me is\nwhy did you do it and I'd be like cuz it\nmy initial response was because it looks\ngood like that you know I was a kid what\ndo I know and he'd be like every year\nhe'd be like why did you do it and I'd\nbe like oh cuz this color matches with\nthis color and they be like why do you\ndo it and I'm like oh because it reveals\nthe metaphor that I think this is about\nand then he'd be like why did you do it\nand I'm like because that's how I'm\nfeeling right now I'm trying to and\nevery year it would ask me it would\nreveal more and more layers of my psyche\nin a similar way and again I've owed it\nto someone in my life who pushed me to\nask the question why same as you and so\nI think what we're both saying is please\nask that question to yourself but what\nif someone asks that question and they\nfeel stuck and they kind of go I've\nasked it but it's kind of just like like\njust want a nice house like I just want\na nice car I just I just kind of want to\nyou know like it's not that deep and I\nthink you're right like you said we\ndon't have a lot of Primal fears like\nsome people who are listening right now\nwill have fears of survival and that is\ndriving them and they are working hard\nand they are pushing and at the same\ntime we have people who like driven but\nthey're like I'm not driven enough\nbecause I haven't got anything to be\nthat scared about or that worried about\nwhat how do you that person discover\ntheir way yeah I think for me it's like\nmy life was never terrible or you know\nlike when I when I started the yeah when\nI started the podcast the mindset Mentor\nlike I was at a point in my life where I\nwas making a whole bunch of money and I\nwas 27 years old and I was making 250\nGrand a year and I was working from home\nand everything was great but I felt like\nI was slowly withering away and I could\nsee what the future was going to be\nwhile I was there and I said okay if I\ndo this for another 5 years and I'm 32\nyears old and I'm still doing this or I\nhave my manager's job is is that going\nto fulfill me and it actually gave me\nmore anxiety to think about having my\nmanager's job and then I sat there and I\nthought okay well like I really want to\ndo this podcasting thing it seems to be\ngoing pretty well I want to coach people\nI want to help people and um I also at\nthe same time was like starting an\nAmazon business and trying to make money\nonline and do that and so I thought\nabout it and I asked myself okay if I\nfast forward five years from today do I\nwant to be the person that's in Sales\nManagement like I'm doing now and\nConsulting do I want to be the guy\nthat's selling stuff on Amazon and you\nknow incredible Amazon business person\nor do I want to be the guy that's\ncoaching people and helping people\nchange their lives and the immediate\nanswer was very clear coaching people\nand changing their lives and I was like\nokay well that feels like it's the path\nand then immediately comes up is all\nkinds of fear cuz I don't know what I'm\ndoing like back in the day 2015 nobody\nmade any money in podcast I didn't have\nany idea of how to grow a business any\nof that type of stuff but what was\nimportant to me was number one when I\nfast forward it into the future the\nFutures that I didn't want seemed way\nmore painful than trying the unknown and\nwhat could be if I did take the path and\nso that was that became more of a fear\nlike the fear of judgment the fear of\nputting myself out there other people's\nopinions it was there it's still there\nand I don't know if you ever get past it\nbut you just kind of get more used to it\nbut the fear of being in the exact same\nposition working the same job maybe\nmaking a little bit more money doing\nthis for every day until the day I\ndie was terrifying that was that was a\nfear and I was like well then this path\nof the unknown is n as scary and so I\nmight as well take this path of the\nunknown and I I'll be fully transparent\nthere was um I shared this on uh like\none other time I think there was a\nmoment in\n2015 where uh I I started the podcast in\nAugust of\n2015 November of 2015 I was feeling like\na whole lot of fear and I was like I\nmight have to go back and work for\nsomeone else again and it was just fear\nwas so in my head and I was like I got\nto go back to making money I got a new\nhouse I got a mortgage I don't know how\nI'm going to do this I'm not making any\nmoney doing this my sister came out to\nme and I believe you know if you're\nsilent the messages are always there if\nyou're looking the messages are always\nthere my sister was at her house um and\nshe goes hey have you ever seen this box\nof dad stuff and I was like No And she\nbrought up my my father was an alcoholic\nhe passed away and I was 15 from his\nalcoholism and she brought out this box\nand it was like his glasses it was a\nt-shirt of his um it was his watch and\nthe other things were a bunch of letters\nmy dad was in jail for a little while uh\nfor multiple DUIs and they put him in\njail and he would would write letters to\nus and um and he wrote a letter to my\nsister on her 19th birthday and I was\nreading this you know 2015 so he would\nhave wrote it to her in 1999 and the\nvery last line was I hope you live your\nlife with courage love and laughter and\nI read it and it was like the universe\nwarped and I was like oh he wrote this\nfor me like there was a moment where I\nwas like he wrote this to my sister but\nthe universe is giving this message\nthrough my dad because I need to hear\nthis right now cuz I'm in so much fear\nin the very first line is courage live\nyour life with courage love and laughter\nand I was like I got to commit like I I\nI this has to be the thing I've got to\nmake a decision and when you look at the\nroot word of decision it's decadia which\nmeans to cut off I'm going to cut off\nall other options you know I'd heard\nlike Will Smith say there's no reason to\nhave plan B because it distracts from\nplan a like it's got to be the thing and\nI was like oh my God I got to commit to\nthis thing I can't have any more\nfeelings of like I'm going to go back to\nworking for someone else this is my life\npath I'm either going to succeed at it\nI'm going to die trying and I was like I\ndon't know what to do I was like I'm\ngoing to get this tattoo to my arm so I\nliterally have live your life with\ncourage love and laughter tattoo\ntomorrow my very first tattoo I ever got\nbut it was like for me people always\nthink like when you make a decision the\nfear disappears like I wish that I could\ndo these things but it's like it's\nalways there but you've got to learn\nthat like the fear is always going to be\nthere but my bigger fear is getting to\nthe end of my life and having not done\nthis having not tried to help people you\nknow like like being in the room with\nwith my father after he passed away when\nI was 15 years old and realizing cuz he\nwas the first person I ever met the past\naway I'm going to be there one\nday and I saw it I was like oh yeah\nthat's I'm GNA he he was a dreamer he\nwas an amazing person but he didn't do\nwhat he wanted to do I am not going to\nlive that life I'm going to create what\nI want to create and now I have all of\nthe other fears that everyone else has\nbut my biggest fear is getting to the\nend of my life and not having or not\nhaving at least gone for it yeah that's\nI love hearing that and you've reminded\nme of a great speech that Jim Carry gave\nfunnily enough and he talked about how\nhis dad I believe his dad and I could be\ngetting this wrong but he said that his\ndad was an accountant and he did that to\nbe safe and he said that when he was\nyoung his dad got made redundant from\nhis safe job right Jim Carrey said that\nin life you are probably going to fail\nat something you don't love you might as\nwell try something you do love right\nlike this idea that I'm choosing the\nsafe option or I'm choosing something\nthat my parents thought my family wanted\nor I'm choosing something I think is\nsecure even that's unstable and\nuncertain and so the uncertainty that\nyou pursue actually is less fearful yeah\nbecause you're on top of it you're aware\nand I think that's that's one of the\nbiggest habits that I think's changed my\nlife is that I stopped believing and\naccepting that I would get to a place\nwhere I no longer had to use my brain\nright like I think we all believe\nsubconsciously somewhere that there's a\npaycheck there's a bank balance there's\na home there's a fashion there's a\npartner that means from that point on I\ndon't have to think about anything good\nall good and my I'd say my best Habit in\nlife is recognizing that that is the\nbiggest myth that we've been sold and I\njust don't accept it and I'm K that my\nlife requires constant work ethic and\neffort and awareness and being astute\nand being conscious because that is\nwhat's actually being demanded by this\nworld a uncertain World forces you to be\nconscious but if you're unconscious in\nan uncertain world that's leading to a\nreally dangerous place sure and but I\nthink we're waiting for that moment\nwhere we can just not be conscious\nbecause it's so much hard work but to\nyour point it's way harder work being\nunconscious oh yeah because the amount\nof unconscious issues that arise are\nnumerous I think there's like a lot of\nwisdom in what you said because a lot of\npeople would rather just be like well\nlet me get to this destination once I'm\nthere everything becomes better hey I\nwant that too I do too right and I I\nthought that for a long time and and\nit's interesting the journey that I've\nhad is you know um I always wanted to\nmake money because I thought money was\ngoing to give me what I needed it would\ngive me that Safety and Security that I\nnever felt as a child\nand then I got to a goal that I wanted\nto get to and I realized I feel exactly\nthe same as I've always felt I don't\nfeel any different I don't feel any more\nsecure I don't feel any happier I don't\nfeel any more loved and what I realized\nwas I thought that the achievement the\nrecognition from other people the money\nin my bank account the buying cool stuff\nwould fill what I actually thought was\nand and consciously now know is I\nthought that all of those things would\nfill a void that was inside of me and\nwhat I realized is what I was searching\nfor from the external world is actually\nwhat I was searching for it for myself\nand so the reason why I spend so much\ntime in silence nowadays I'll just go\nout of my porch and I'll just sit there\nfor a couple hours is because I'm trying\nto fill the void that I have have\ncreated through life and through\npatterns and through heartbreaks and\nthrough all of the things that happened\nin my childhood and I'm trying to be\nthere as the 38-year-old man for the\n9-year-old boy that's still healing and\nwhat I've realized is that none of the\nmaterial things anything externally will\never give me what I was ever searching\nfor everything I've always searched for\nin the external was what I've been\nsearching for for myself and so I don't\nI 100% agree with you I don't think\nthere's any destination we ever get to I\nthink I'm constantly going to overcome\nmore things every single day and you\nknow if I live to 100 I I would be so\nlucky and another 62 more years I don't\nexpect that I'm going to get to the end\nof my life and be like I got I figured\nit out I think the Beautiful Thing part\npart about it is I think that I was\ngiven this this need for achievement to\nrealize that it doesn't change anything\nbecause the path of wanting to achieve\nand doing it through business and doing\nit through growing and all that stuff\nhas actually lit up inside of me um a\nspiritual journey that wouldn't have\nbeen there had I not wanted to go for\nthose things yeah absolutely I heard\nthis uh you reminded me of this story\nthat's told about Benjamin Franklin and\nBenjamin Franklin had 13 virtues and\nthese qualities that he aspired to\ndevelop in his life Simplicity\nauthenticity patience things like that\nand when he was on his deathbed they\nasked him which one he didn't accomplish\nand he said it was the 13th one and they\nsaid what was that and he said humility\nand I love that because I think what\nyou're saying is humility doesn't mean\nyou're Meek or weak it means I'm able to\naccept there's always more to learn I\ndon't know everything yeah and it's okay\nI'm going to give myself Grace for it\ntoo it isn't a feeling of I'm useless\nbecause I don't know it's actually I'll\nbecome more useful if I recognize there\nare things that I still have to learn\nand and when I'm listening to you about\nyour spiritual journey and that silence\nI'm intrigued by that walk us through\nhow\nyou fill that void\nalmost practice wise because I I\nidentify with that fully and it's funny\nbecause we always talked about how our\nlives were kind of opposite yeah because\nwhen I met you I'd kind of gone down\nthis deep spiritual path right but had\nno money and you were in the other boat\nwhere you had s you had sustained\nyourself financially and create a really\ngood uh stable place for yourself but\nyou were seeking spiritually and so\nwe're kind of at right right we had that\nconversation yeah and let's talk about\nthat too but I'm intrigued as to how\ndoes that couple of hours or whatever\nthat time on your porch like how do you\ndo that for people because I think we we\nlike the sound of that but then we get\ndistracted by the next thing what I've\ncome to find and I can speak with them\nmyself and just what I've seen from\nother people but what I've seen within\nmyself is that I've learned a lot of\nlessons from my dad um most of them\nafter his death and me processing things\nmy father was the way that he was and he\nbecame an alcoholic because he had\nthings in his past that he hadn't worked\nthrough and the thing that that he\nhadn't worked through is when he was 12\nyears old my father heard a gunshot he\nwalked into the room and his dad had\njust shot himself in the mouth with a\nshotgun and so my dad grew up in rural\nTennessee\nthis is 19 you know 60s when this\nhappened 197 yeah 1960s when this\nhappened there wasn't a whole lot for\nhim to understand there weren't podcasts\nthere weren't books to read like we have\nnowadays and so I I always consciously\nknew that what was happening was that he\nhad not healed his pain and Gabor mate\nsays don't ask why the trauma ask why\nthe pain and when I first heard Gabor\nmate I was like oh my God someone's\nfinally saying what I always thought\nwith my father and so you know we can\nlook at him and say oh yeah he's an\nalcoholic and he didn't overcome his\ntrauma the trauma the way it came up in\nmy life is I became a workaholic and so\nI didn't you know sometimes we could see\nsomeone and say oh they drink too much\nalcohol they do too much drugs they eat\ntoo much food they and we can say oh\nyeah that that's their their addiction\nthe problem in the hard thing in our\nsociety is that my addiction of\nworkaholic is rewarded and people look\nup to it and they're like you're doing\nso great you're making so much money all\nof this is so good and what I came to\nfind is that my workaholism was just\nbasically me trying to not feel my\nfeelings and to to not work through in\nprocess those things um you know like\nscrolling on social media could be that\nway for somebody it could be um some\npeople are addicted to working out some\npeople are addicted to you know watching\nTV and and there's so many some people\naddicted to shopping there's so many\ndifferent addictions that we have and\nwhat I found is that the hardest thing\nfor me was to\nstop and to just not have to I was\nalways trying to fill every single\nmoment of my day always try to be so\nbusy when I didn't have something to do\nI'd find something to do in my business\nbusinesses you can always work all day\nevery day and so what I've tried to do\nand I've I've built in my business is a\nlot of systems and processes through my\nmy VP of operations has really helped me\nwith this a ton to be able to take a lot\nof stuff off my plate so that I have\nmore time to just be it's my personal\nbelief uh that I think that God the\nuniverse life whatever it is speaks in\nsilence and so if I want want those\nmessages I need to be silent what I\nfound for myself is when I would be\nsilent a lot of anxiety would come up\nand I like you got to go to the next\nthing you got to go to the next thing\nthis is stupid you should be doing\nsomething else and then I just realized\nthat what I was trying to do is Achieve\nto fill a void but I could sit here and\nthere's been moments where I'll sit on\nmy porch and I'll literally just start\ncrying and I'm like sometimes it's\ngratitude oh my God I can't believe I've\nbeen given this life I can't believe\nI've had these challenges I can't\nbelieve that I've had this come up but\nI'm so grateful for every single aspect\nof it and sometimes I just sit there and\ntear up and I'm like I don't know what\nthis is but this is something my body's\nreleasing and I need to be okay with\nthis releasing process um you know\nthere's there's a really interesting\nthing that that people could look at\nthere's two videos that are really\ninteresting on um on YouTube one of them\nis called uh polar bear trauma where\nthey show a video of a polar there and\nthey they shoot it with a tranquilizer\ngun from a a helicopter they chase it\ndown the helicopter really heightened\nexperience they shoot it with a\ntranquilizer gun so it's still awake but\nit's not you know completely out and it\nstarts having a convulsion starts\nseizuring and eventually after it\nseizures it's what it's doing is it's\nreleasing all of the cortisol all of the\nadrenaline from its body so that there's\nno trauma that comes with it and so then\nit goes after it's shaken for a\nwhile takes a really deep breath and it\njust kind of calms down almost identical\nvideo of a Impala that gets attacked by\na jaguar and the Jaguar gets scared off\nit starts to convulse takes a deep\nbreath and then it moves it and work\ntaught in our lives at some point in\ntime not to remove this and to work\nthrough these traumas and these feelings\nI think children naturally do it through\nlike temper tantrums they move it and\nsometimes as adults we either need to\nhave like an adult temper tantrum in\nsafety uh where you just take a pillow\nand you can be angry you could be mad\nyou could just scream you can cuss you\ncan smash it against the bed whatever it\nis in in safety by yourself without\nother people around so you don't scare\nthem as well and then sometimes it's\nalso just like sitting there in silence\nand and realizing that what is coming is\ngoing what's it's like when you squeeze\nan orange what's inside of it orange\njuice because that's what's in it right\nwhen you sit there and you put pressure\non yourself or you give yourself space\nwhat's coming out is actually what's\ninside and your body's natural\nintelligence is trying to let go of it\nand so for me that's what I found is\nthat there's some moments where I'm just\nlike incredibly grateful there's some\nmoments where I'm I by doing nothing Jay\nI get so much anxiety and I'm like what\nis this why and instead of running from\nit um I get curious and I think if we\ncould just get more Curious um like I've\nbeen reading a whole lot of Krishna\nmerty recently I love Krishna mty and\none says he one thing he says is is\ndon't know yourself because knowing is\nbased in the past and past is based off\nof memories start learning yourself\nwhich is in the present moment so be\npresent and be like what comes up how\ncan I be curious about this anxious\nfeeling or these tears or whatever it is\nand and just be be in the space to just\nknow yourself or get to know yourself a\nlittle bit better yeah it's so great I\nmean talking about that that goes to me\nback to what we were talking about this\nstart of it you were saying\nhow this idea of well what if the worst\nthing happens what if the best thing\nhappens and we talking about this idea\nof Jim Carrey and you were saying that\nthere's this experience of well I lost\nwho Jim Carry was and what we've both\ntalked about is we are so much of what\nour thoughts are and therefore if you\nchange the thoughts completely you're\nalmost a completely different human sure\nso then who are we right comes back to\nthis know thyself versus learning of\nthyself like what has that spiritual\njourney taken you to understanding\nidentity I mean God Jay that's like as\ndeep as I can go um that that I'm just\nuh I am just a soul that that chose this\nlife and um one of the things that I\nlike to do is I like to think that I I\nchose this life and and um that\nimmediately takes me from being a victim\nin my life oh well was me my father was\nthis way he did this to me my mom did\nthis to me and my teachers acted this\nway versus me going like I think my soul\nchose this life because this is whatever\nis needed for this path that it's on for\nyou know whether it's reincarnation or\nwhether it's Heaven or Hell or whatever\nis that comes after this I don't know\nbut I do know like right now I do have\nthis life as Rob dial and as I get older\nthe thing I realize that my body changes\nI'm not as fast as I used to be I'm a\nlot more sore than I used to be like my\nbody's changing but my soul is this\nthing that is just always there and so\nthe thing that I've that I've come to\nrealize is that I want to\nI don't know if it's going to sound\nweird like I want to unattach myself\nfrom this body from everything around me\nand I want to try to connect back to\nwhat's internally inside of me and the\none thing that I find is that that never\nchanges like that there's like a a a\ntruth that's behind that and Truth is a\nthing that that never changes if\nsomething changes or if something can be\nquestioned it's not true but there's\nthis feeling that feels like truth\ninside of me at least and everybody has\ntheir own truth but for me my truth is\nthere something that's behind all of it\nand the more that I connect to it the\nmore peace that I have like I listen to\na lot of Romas and um one of the things\nthat he said I was I was listening to\nhim on the drive over here and I listen\nto this meditation every day is the only\nwork that you have to do is the\nconnection to your own heart and so I'm\nalways constantly thinking what's in the\nway of my own heart what what material\npossessions what things that I want to\nto get are in the way of that and the\nreason why I think that it helps is\nnumber one I've I've had so much more\npeace from trying to connect to that and\nmy relationship with my wife has been so\nmuch better because of it cuz I'm not\nblocking her from letting her in she's\nexperiencing me fully she's she starts\nto be able to open up even more in\ndifferent ways I'd be able to experience\nher more fully and so for me it's just\nlike connecting to the thing that's\nbehind it that feels like the only thing\nthat's Truth Now mind you if if Rob 15\nyears ago had heard this he would be\nlike what the hell is that guy talking\nabout it would make no sense but on this\njourney I've just I've just kind of\nrealized that there's something behind\nit all and I want to try to connect to\nthat something behind it all and see\nwhat it is and so for me it's like I I I\nlike to use myself as a guinea pig\neverything I teach in the mindset mentor\nand the podcast is all stuff that I'm\ntrying Within Myself and I I use it as\nalmost my own therapy sessions where I'm\ntalking to everybody but I'm talking to\nmyself I'm reminding myself of all these\nthings and um what I realized is I I\nrealized that after 15 19 years of\npersonal development\nit's like you know personal development\nis like this this this cup right here\nand I feel like my cup in personal\ndevelopment was overflowing and then I\nfound Spiritual Development and I\nrealized oh my God it's a lot bigger cup\nand it's not even close to being full\nlike it's a bucket and it needs it it's\nmy next thing that I'm working on so for\nme it's like the mindset the working\nthrough like I'm constantly working on\nthis and trying to get better but for me\nit's like I want to connect to myself\nand see what else is in there yeah for\nsure thank you for sharing that I mean\nyou made me remember a CS Lewis\nstatement that says you don't have a\nsoul you are the soul and you have a\nbody yeah and I remember I used to have\nthat written on a little poster note and\nI used to look at it every day first\nthing in the morning because I was\nthinking about this concept of identity\nthat the first thing 99% of us do when\nwe wake up first thing in the morning is\nwe look in the mirror usually we say\nsomething like G I look tired or don't\nlike that spot or God I put on weight\nGod whatever it is right now all of a\nsudden we're already in the bodily\nconcept of life this bodily\nConsciousness and now you live your\nwhole day thinking about the body what\ndoes the body need the body needs food\nEtc and so and that's natural like\nthat's not unnatural that's normal like\nI do that too but then you're saying\nthat at the same time you've got to\nnurture and nourish and connect with\nthis deeper sense how do you balance the\ntwo in a real world where you have\nresponsibilities you have bills you have\nthings to do that are connected to the\nbody but then at the same time we're\nlike but you're not this body so how how\ndo you balance how do you make sense of\nthese two seemingly opposite Pursuits\nyeah I mean I'm the thing that I that I\nthink I would have thought five or 10\nyears ago was that the more that I get\ninto Spiritual Development the less\nmotivated I'll become or the most the\nless I will want to achieve that hasn't\ngone away in any sort of way but what I\nhave found is that I achieved through a\nplace of\nof it's more like I'm not white\nknuckling my way through life anymore\nI'm not I can take action and not be so\nwrapped up in my fears and my limiting\nbeliefs and so it's not like you I'm I'm\nin the world and and of the world at the\nsame time where it's like the soul is\nhere and I get as I'm speaking to\neverything that I say is also something\nthat I struggle with every single day I\nhave not mastered this process there'll\nbe times where I find myself just so in\nthe world and I'm just like stressed\nthere's things happening there's this\nbusiness where there's all of this you\nknow we got employees we're hiring\npeople there's stuff happening and then\nI just take a step back and I'm\nlike it's just it's just like kind of\nlike a game like take a second like\nthat's it's all real that's I'm not\nsaying that's it's not true it's not\nreality it's not in front of you it's\nall there but behind it all if I can\nconnect to like a deeper sense that's\nwithin me and in the the soul that I\nfeel is in there I'm like hey man chill\nout for a second like it's really not\nthat big of a deal right most things you\nknow there are there are definitely some\nthings that are big deals in people's\nlives and there's deaths and there's\nthere's um things that people have to\nyou know be in control of and be able to\npay bills and all that stuff all those\nare real and they're definitely\nnecessary but behind it all you're still\nthere yeah and there's this thing that\nif I can take\nmyself back and kind of like out of my\nown head and kind of into my heart which\nhas been a big Journey for me because I\nwas I'm so analytical and was never\nreally taught like feelings and how to\nfeel and process emotions but if I can\ntake myself out of my head and into my\nheart what I've always found is that my\nhead is always projecting itself into\nthe future or sometimes projecting\nitself into the past but most for me\nlike if I sit down and meditate\nsometimes it's like all of my to-do list\nall of the things that I have to do and\nit's projecting itself into the future\nso my brain is always somewhere else my\nbody it's always here and so when I\nnotice myself get stressed I notice\nmyself get anxious I notice myself\nwhatever feelings I might be feeling if\nI if I can take a couple deep breaths\nand kind of get back into my body I'm\nlike it's not that bad like you'll you\nyou have overcome so many things in your\nlife you'll figure out a way to get\nthrough it and so what I found is that\nit's not that I don't take the action\nit's not that I'm not um wanting to\nachieve more and more things and be able\nto have more fun and have more do all of\nthis stuff in the external world but\nwhen I find myself kind of take a step\nback and kind of be in my heart is it\nmakes it a lot easier where I'm not like\nwhite knuckling and forcing my way\nthrough life it's almost like I'm\nallowing life to happen through me and I\ndon't know how it works and I don't\npretend to be smart enough but things\nstart happening around me that help me\nin the process of getting to wherever it\nis that I actually want to truly go yeah\nit's there's this really interesting\nthing in eastern Traditions there's\nobviously this idea of Oneness and that\neverything's one and then there's this\nidea of Duality that there's this side\nand then there's this side\nand one teaching that I've really\nconnected with is this idea idea of\nsimultaneously one and different and it\nsounds complex but it's actually not\nit's this idea\nthat this feels real and and it can be\nreal and it is real and at the same time\nthere is a greater reality so rather\nthan this feeling of everything's one\neverything's the same or it's\ndisconnected There's real and fake it's\nactually this idea that a lot of things\nare real but they're not the full\npicture so the idea that today and play\nit's like saying the weather's rainy and\ncloudy but that's not the weather\neverywhere so it's my current reality\nbut it's not reality across the whole\nworld and when you start looking at life\nin that way of there's this reality and\nthen there's this bigger reality I think\nthat's that zoom out that's that let me\ntake a breath that's that let let me\nlook at the inner world as well and I\nthink what it does is it gives you a\ncertain Grace and it gives you a certain\nDetachment disconnection but also a\nrecognition of the significance of what\nyou do and the insignificance of it both\nare so needed like I believe what I do\nis significant and at the same time it's\ntotally insignificant you won't we won't\nbe remembered in a thousand years and\nit's so okay and but we take it so\nseriously and if you only do one or the\nother like if I only see my life as\nextremely significant everything's too\nhigh pressure yeah oh my gosh I would I\nwould it would hurt me and it would\ncause me pain if I thought everything I\ndid was of utmost significance and if I\nthought my life was insignificant if I\nthought my life was irrelevant that\nwould be really bad for myself a I won't\nbe able to function right and so I think\nit's really interesting because the more\nand more I'm learning I'm like I have to\nlearn how to hold these two seemingly\nopposite things but actually they're so\nconnected and symbiotic and they're so\nsynchronous because they both have value\ngoing back to which thought has\nvalue the the collective thought thought\nof my life is significant and\ninsignificant is the most helpful\nthought thinking I'm significant or\ninsant are both unhelpful thoughts oh my\nGod that's you actually just summarized\nperfectly what I feel like actually has\nbeen going through my head for years\nwhich is what I do I do believe is so\nimportant and at the same time I'm like\nnone of it matters right it's it's this\nweird Duality that we live but it's so\nfreeing because it it takes so much\npressure off where it just becomes like\nfun like it's it's how can I bring more\nfun into life like when did we lose the\nthe joy of life and the fun of life that\nwe had as children when was it\nprogrammed out of us and how can I\nconnect to that child and bring that\nSpirit back in and be like yeah I'm\ngoing to do some amazing things in the\nworld but without it being stressful\nwith just with it being fun and with it\nbeing something that I can do and it and\nit effortlessly flows out of me like I\nbelieve that every single person is\nincredibly creative and we are we are\ncreators at the actual core of us and a\nlot of us have lost it and I lost it for\nyears and so what I think is how can I\nmake the creativity flow out of me in\nsome sort of way and just allow the\nspace for it to happen and one of the\nthings that happens and it's not\nnecessarily my my goal of it but when I\nsit in silence I get ideas that come\nthrough and I'm like oh man I don't know\nhow I didn't see this and that's where\nthey all are so it's like a lot of times\nwe're trying to force things to happen\nwe're trying to force creativity we're\ntrying to force ideas but sometimes when\nI get there I'm like oh man yeah this is\nthe thing I've been searching for and\nit's just I think every person just\nneeds to give themsel just a little bit\nmore space to not be on their phone to\nnot be constantly you know and I a lot\nof people have children their their\nchildren are up can you wake up a little\nbit earlier not be on your phone and\njust sit in silence and see what comes\nup and and I think that it's really\nimportant for people because um what\nyou'll notice is exactly what you're\nsaying which is what we do like this\nlife is so important but it is very\ninsignificant and that's okay there's\nnothing wrong with that like I've I love\nwatching videos on YouTube about how\nsmall the Earth is compared to the rest\nof the universe and it stresses my wife\nout she's like I'm going to have a panic\nattack why why do you watch this because\nI was like I like to remind myself that\neven though it's all happening and I'm\nin it none of it actually truly matters\nyeah and that's okay absolutely and I\nthink when I'm listening to you there's\nthis feeling that you know I feel like I\nagree with you I think everyone is a\nCreator I do believe that creativity\nflows when we connect with that but I\nthink sometimes we feel so distracted\nfrom it yeah and it's so much easier to\npull out our phone it's so much easier\nto put on a show in the background it's\nso much easier to do all of these it's\nso much easier to do all those things at\nthe same time yeah like now we're no\nlonger ever with one person we're with\none person we're both on our phones and\nwe're watching a show at the same time\nand we got our laptops doing work so\nyou've literally got three screens in\nfront of you five screens in total and\nthere's there's so much dis distraction\nright we know that how does a person\npossibly and I say this out of like\ncompassion and empathy because it's like\nit requires so much from us right\nbecause everything around us is built\nfor distraction the foods we're eating\nthe the things we drink and consume the\nthe stuff that's created around us it's\nall to distract so you're fighting like\nalmost what feels to a lot of people\nlike a losing battle right what do you\ndo to get pick yourself back up I mean\nwhat's more what's what's more important\nthan that you know what's more important\nthan connecting to your true self to\nworking on yourself like I why do I like\nwhy am I so hardcore in mindset because\nI know how many people are so wrapped up\nin in their mindset and their thoughts\nand their beliefs and their patterns\nthat they're stuck in and what\nultimately we all want I think is is\nfreedom and the way to get through to\nthat freedom is to work on yourself\nwhatever that looks like for whatever\nstage someone is in you know and and I\ncan have uh empathy for every person at\nevery stage cuz I've been through so\nmany stages of of my process and um I\nthink that it comes back to like why are\nyou doing it what do you want if if\nyou're trying to disconnect from your\nphone why you know like for me like I I\nrecently deleted Instagram from my phone\nI did it last year for a month felt like\nit was amazing the book came out and I\nwas like I got to get back on I got to\npromote I got to make sure things are\ngood I recently just deleted it again\nand now everything that that I post\neverything flows through my team so I'm\nit's not like it's just gone it's just\nnow I just happened to to flow\neverything flows through my\nteam why did I do that though was\nbecause I don't want to live my life on\nthat phone and that one thing that I\nnoticed is that Instagram was one of the\nthings where I would pick it up and I\nwould just somehow get to it and I\nwasn't even thinking about getting to it\nand I was like my life is not this\nlittle tiny thing my life is everything\nthat's out here and so why do I want to\nget why did I delete it was because I\nactually want to to be in everything I\nwant to be present with my wife when we\nhave children I want to be present with\nour children I want to be the most\npresent version of myself as I possibly\ncan and I can't imagine that I'll get to\nthe end of my life be 100 years old and\nbe like I wish I would have spent more\ntime on Instagram I wish I would to\nspend more time watching Netflix you\nknow and I have I've I've been addicted\nto all of those things I'm not you know\nuh above any of this stuff but I started\nlooking at myself and saying like is\nthis helping me get to where I want to\nbe in life is it creating more peace in\nmy life for me it was creating way more\nstress so was perpetuating these\nfeelings that I'm trying to let go of\nand trying to work with and so for me I\nthink what's important to people is like\nif you want to make a change why do you\nwant to make the change and for me\nlooking at a screen is not as important\nas actually physically being in front of\nmy wife and giving her what she actually\ntruly deserves which is 100% of my\nattention because there's been times\nwhere I've not given her 100% of my\nattention and as I as we start to have\nkids and stuff I don't want to be a\ndistract Ed parent I want to be with\nthem I I'll never sit there and go well\nwhen my kids were kids my kids were\nchildren like I wish I would have spent\nmore time on Instagram I wish I to spent\nmore time watching\nNetflix I just think for me like the the\nthe level of the the place I'm at in my\nlife is I want to be as present as\npossible because I've worked for things\nI've climbed ladders I've gotten to\ndifferent places I've realized none of\nthose things fulfilled me in any sort of\nway and this journey I've been on in the\npast you know 10 years s years ago and\nwe started talking about the B of gaita\nand I started meditating a whole lot\nmore and getting into is I realized oh\nthese things are bringing me peace and\nthe more peaceful I feel the more that\nit becomes easy to actually achieve and\ncreate the stuff that I want to in life\nand so for me the presence and the peace\nat this point in my life things might\nchange I don't know what it's going to\nbe in five years are actually the things\nthat are the most important to me yeah\nit's so interesting I think we feel like\nbeing anxious and being you know kind of\nlike busy and stuff will actually create\nthe most Effectiveness but well you just\nsaid this idea of if you start from a\nplace of peace and I think about I\ncompletely agree with that if you walk\ninto something with\nStillness it gives you Clarity gives you\nperspective you can zoom out you can\nzoom in if you're buzzing around and\nmoving around you lose all of that it's\nall blurry and fuzzy and I want to ask\nyou\nwhat's\nwhat's a lesson you wish you learned\nearlier in\nlife I think it's that what you're\nsearching for externally you're actually\nsearch searching for\nyourself um I think that's become very\napparent to me in the past few years is\nis I was always looking for somebody to\ngive me love somebody to give me\nacceptance to achieve so that I could be\naccepted and what I actually truly think\nis what I was searching for from\neveryone else was what I was searching\nfor for myself so a lot of people that\nare like I I a lot of people I know are\npeople Pleasers they come to me Rob\npeople pleas are and it's like they'll\nchange themsel to try to get love and\nacceptance from somebody else\nbut that's just feeling a you know it's\nlike a Hungry Ghost it just the the food\njust goes through the ghost it doesn't\ngo anywhere and what we're actually\nsearching for is what we're searching\nthat that love and acceptance for\nourself and um one of the biggest things\nthat I think I've learned in probably\nthe past two years is I was always\ntrying to grow and change myself because\nthere were aspects of myself that I\ndidn't like and I I I resented and what\nI've changed to in the past couple years\nyears is I'm going to love every aspect\nof myself so there's some parts of Rob\nthat are beautiful that are amazing that\nlove people that want to connect there's\nthere's some great parts of Rob there's\nsome parts of Rob also that are very\nselfish that are very judgmental that\nare um a little bit short not as present\nas he should be instead of trying to\nchange those and hate those I've\nactually just tried to love them and\nrealize that the selfish Rob that exists\nwas some sort of thing that he that was\na part of past conditioning that came up\nfrom needing to be selfish as a child\nfor whatever it might have been whatever\nreasons it might have been and I can\nlove that side of me what I realize is\nthat if I try to change it it gets\nstronger if I love it and I accept it it\nkind of chills out and it doesn't\ndisappear like I'm not like yeah these\nparts me don't exist it's me looking\nlike internal family systems is a is a\ntherapy where you look at all parts of\nyou and who you are and you try to\nfigure out a way to understand how the\nentire Orchestra works together you know\nwhen I was when I was writing my book I\nwas sitting there and I was I was going\nso hardcore like you and I come from the\nworld of creating viral videos I would\nspend so much time on every single line\nto make sure it was perfect right cuz I\nwanted to make sure like I've only got\n30 seconds or a minute to get the the\nmessage to be as clear and concise as\npossible let me try to make as perfect\nas possible and I used to do a lot of\npoetry used to do a lot of songw writing\nwhen I was younger so I was used to\nmaking every line as potent as I could\nas I was writing this book I was like 16\nrounds of edits in editing every single\npiece of it and there was a part of me\nthat said it said why are you doing this\nlike why are you doing this and I was\nlike I want to write a book that helps\npeople and changes people's lives I want\nsomeone to not know what the mindset\nMentor podcast is but they walk into\nBarnes & Noble they see this book and\nthey're like interesting let me read it\nlet me pick it up and they read it and\nit changes their life and then I played\nDevil's Advocate and I said but you also\nwanted to be successful don't you you\nalso want it to be your New York Times\nbesteller so you can have a little badge\nto put on yourself and say New York\nTimes best seller you want it to be this\nincredibly selling thing because you\nknow if it takes off you're going to\nmake great money for a very long time if\nit's a perennial seller and I thought to\nmyself okay can I use that ego inside of\nme to actually help me create a better\nbook and I could and so what I realized\nis instead of hating that aspect it's\nlike a tool in my tool belt when I need\nto bring that side of me out I can bring\nout side that side of me out and say you\nknow what I'm going to create the best\nfreaking book that I can or the best\npodcast that I can or the best real that\nI can to try to impact people and so\nit's not about like trying to force\nchange on myself it's about loving every\naspect of myself the quote unquote good\nand bad even though there is no good or\nbad but every aspect of Rob and if I\nneed to use it I can bring it up and say\nhey Rob I need this version of you right\nnow but I'm not going to fight it\nanymore yeah yeah in the monaster we'd\nalways talk about how the word is uh\nanartha which means unwanted thing that\nseems unwanted actually needs to be\nengaged like you need to engage it in\nthe service of doing something higher\nfor it to be purified like you can't\njust cut it out you can't just get rid\nof it you can't just hate it to go away\nyou can't just shame it away you can't\njust guilt it away it has to be engaged\nin a higher service I impacting others\nhelping others improving your own life\nimproving the lives of others because\nwhen it's engaged then it becomes\npurified because if you just ignore it\nit would just stay there and if you try\nand push it away it's going to push back\nand get stronger but if you engage it\nand go yeah you know what I do have that\nin me but I'm going to use that tendency\nto try and help this PE help this person\ndo this that's the only way that it\nstarts to be purified and so that that\nresonates very strongly great answer the\nother one I wanted to ask you was what's\na lesson you have to learn the hard\nway yeah I think the one that's been the\nmost potent for a long time is you can't\ndo it all on your own\num for me I don't think I was able to\ntrust people for a very long time um you\nknow I went to a therapist one time and\nhe had said yeah you've been you've been\nneglected and I was like no I haven't\nbeen neglected like I I had food Water\nShelter clothing all these things and\nhe's like no you were emotionally\nneglected from your father and and I was\nlike oh my God I that really like Rings\ntrue but what happened was I had\ndeveloped this feeling over my lifetime\nof I've got to do it alone I can't trust\nanybody no one else can do for me you\nknow like there were times when my dad\nwould even though and he was an amazing\nperson I always tell people like I was\nI'm so grateful that I had the father\nthat I had um he was he never beat me he\nnever yelled at me he never touched me\ninappropriately he would just get drunk\nand fall asleep and when he fell asleep\nhe'd forget about me in a lot of\ndifferent ways right so there was that\nneglect of like I might he would say hey\nI'm going to come pick you up and we're\ngoing to go fishing because I lived in\nFlorida and I you know would sit on the\nfront porch for an hour two hours of my\nfishing pole and he would just never\nshow up right and so there were there\naspects of that and I think somewhere\nalong the line I developed this feeling\nof like no one's going to help me I have\nto do it all on my own which there's a\npiece of that which there is some truth\nright like I do have to sometimes step\nforward and be the person to do it but\nfor the longest time I never understood\nthe phrase no man is an island because I\nwas like I have done everything by\nmyself and then I started looking around\nme and I was like no I haven't the\nuniverse has always been there giving me\neverything that I need and every person\nto help me in some sort of way improve\nand get better and you know as\neverything's grown the podcast has grown\nmy my company has grown all this stuff\nwe have 30 people on the team like I\ncan't do it on my own I can't help\npeople on my own the way that I I wish\nthat I could if I was I'm not 30 people\nI don't have 30 days you know they can\nget done in we can get done in one day\nthat I could get done an entire month\nand so what's been big for me is is um\ntrusting\npeople to be able to help me and to be\nable to ask for help whether that be in\na business but also like going into my\nlife be like hey I'm really struggling\nright now like can you just talk to me\nfor a few minutes and knowing that she\ndoesn't think like oh he's not man\nenough which is you know fear that I had\nlike oh if I go to her with my problems\nshe's going to be like he's not man\nenough but for her to be like yeah let\nme hold space for you let's talk it out\nand so I think the biggest thing for me\nis like is learning that I can't do it\nall on my own it's okay to it's actually\nstrength to ask for help it's strong to\nask for help and um\nand that I need to be better at asking\nfor help when I do need it that's a\ngreat one that's a great one I can\nrelate to it in so many ways and and\nyeah it strikes a chord for sure and I\nthink so many of us you know both of\nthose questions think about it you know\nwhat's taken what's a lesson you learned\nthe hard way and what's a lesson you\nwished you learned earlier yeah and\nwrite them down because you might forget\nit yeah and and you kind of fold back\ninto that cycle often Rob we uh end\nevery on purpose episode the final five\nthese questions have to be answered in\none word to one sentence maximum oh my\nGod okay and so I'm so wordy that's a\nthat's a I'll do my best Rob these are\nyour final five the first question is\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nheard or received I'll give you the I'll\ngive you the sentence and if you want me\nto explain it I can but everything is\nyour fault yeah you can explain it\neverything is your fault comes back to\nlike you are the CEO of your life I my\nvery first Mentor that I had I paid $500\na month to have my first coach when I\nwas 19 to turn 20 and we worked together\nfor two years and we had some great\ncalls I don't remember any of them I\nremember one and what it was was I had\nmade so many excuses as to why I was\nlate to calls why I didn't hit my\nassignments why I didn't do what I\nneeded to do and he had this really\ntough conversation with me and he said\nRob if a business succeeds whose faults\nis it and I was like I mean what do you\nmean he's like if a business succeeds\nall 10,000 employees move into the\ndirection they they have a successful\nyear whose fault is it that the person\nwho orchestrated I was like the CEO he\nsaid if a business bus fails whose fault\nis it and it's the CEO he said Rob if\nyou get to the end of your life and it's\nnot what you wanted it to be and you\ndidn't create the life that you wanted\nto make the money that you wanted to\nhave the success the love the happiness\ntravel the places that you wanted to\nwhose fault would it be and I said it'\nbe my fault and he said if you did\ncreate the life that you wanted to you\nhad the love the happiness the abundance\neverything that you wanted whose fault\nwould that be and I said it would be my\nfault and he said the problem with you\nis you're treating this treating this\nlife is if you're the victim and what\nyou need to realize that everything that\nhappens to you is your fault and that\nyour life won't change until you decide\nthat you want to be the CEO of your life\nI don't know how that would have felt\nwhen you heard it at that point yeah\nexactly with that mindset like and I\nthink a lot of people today would find\nthat offensive they might get hurt by it\nthey might what how did you transferred\nthat energy to be like no this is\nactually helpful it's not hurtful yeah I\nmean I was a little bit hurt but there's\nI felt truth I felt like yeah he's right\ncuz in when I look at the path of where\nmy life was going to go had I continued\nto blame everybody else it wasn't going\nto be good but when I looked at people\nwho who I knew who took full ownership\nof their life one of my my uh probably\nmy first Mentor without even it being on\npurpose was my Uncle Dan who was an\nincredibly successful guy um had a bunch\nof success but also is incredibly giving\nalways so loving and he never blamed\nanybody else for when his business\nfailed and he brought it back from from\nnothing and rebuilt it he never blamed\nanybody else he was always there for\neveryone else but he always took\neverything as his\nresponsibility and you know it's like\nnot everything that's happened to you in\nyour life is your fault but whatever it\nis that you have it is your\nresponsibility to work through Will\nSmith also said this right where it's\nlike I it's not my fault that my father\nis an alcoholic but it's my\nresponsibility to do with what do with\nit because it's a reality that I have\nand I have to work through those things\nand so for me it was like it rang really\ntrue where I was like I was like okay\nit's right and if my life is going to\nchange I have to be the person to change\nit and that's when it like clicked for\nme that conversation I could say is\nabsolutely 100% the one conversation\nthat changed my life completely powerful\nuh second question what is the worst\nadvice you've ever heard or received fit\nin with everybody\nelse good uh question number three what\nis your most repeated\nthought as of\nrecently is I'm proud of\nyou I try to tell myself that every\nsingle day my mom told me that a lot as\na kid I'm trying to repeat it to myself\nI love that that's a great one uh\nquestion number four the number one\nhabit that changed your life like a\ndaily habit like something that you\npractice meditation and breath\nwork SP finding space for\nmyself love it uh Fifth and final\nquestion if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be my God take\nit uh one law that everybody in the\nworld has to follow to take five minutes\nevery single day to practice\nself-awareness I think that every\nproblem in this world could be solved if\npeople were more self-aware I think that\nthat all of our problems come from lack\nof self-awareness and if people are more\naware of our actions you know if\npoliticians are more aware of their\nactions and how it's affecting the\nentire world and if parents were aware\nof how their actions are affecting their\nchildren and as you know a son if I'm\naware of how my actions are uh affecting\nmy mom my sister my wife everybody\naround me if we could take five minutes\nto practice being more self-aware I\nthink that the entire world would be\nbetter I love that Rob Dal everyone
