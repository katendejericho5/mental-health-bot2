the world to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett I feel like we've entered your\nmind that's what it feels like when you\nenter this room like all these aspects\nof yourself I was I was wondering what's\nyour earliest childhood memory that you\nthink defines the person you are today I\nheard somewhere you mentioned your\nfather made you earn your breakfast and\nI was thinking what does that feel like\nwhat does that mean you know I I I\nreally don't know exactly what it was\nthat gave me the drive or gave me the\nability to visualize my goals and all\nthat but I think it was a combination of\nthings of growing up after the second\nworld war in 1947 I was born and to grow\nup with no food mid of a starvation and\nuh famine and uh you know my mother\ngoing around what they call hamstering\nwhich means begging uh various different\nFarmers for food so she had food for the\nchildren so all of that I think had an\nimpact uh and a strict upbringing my\nfather was very strict you know we were\nhit many times s and punished for not\ndoing the things the way they thought we\nshould do things we had to earn\nbreakfast like you said you know we had\nto do push-ups and sit-ups and compete\nuh knee bends and all this stuff running\naround the the house uh in order to be\nallowed to have breakfast so I think all\nof that contributed you know and and\nalso I think having the military around\nthe British military that was because\nthey occupied that area of Austria they\ncame always around with their tanks and\nwith their big trucks and everything and\nI think that gave me the fascination of\nuh you know becoming a tank driver\nmyself and I went into the Austrian army\never since then I have had a fascination\nwith big cars big trucks with tanks and\nstuff like that and I now have the tank\nthat I drove in the military I now have\nover here in Los Angeles and it's at the\nMelody Ranch where they have a lot of\nvery different military vehicles and\nthey do the upkeep and they drive it\nlike once a month and especially with\nafter school kids that staying in school\nin the afternoons and so so we have a\nlot of fun with that do you still drive\nit yeah yeah I drive it every month yeah\nabsolutely yeah yeah okay yeah I really\nenjoy but that's why I have Hummers you\nknow the big military trucks and and\ncars and SUVs and uh the the ashkash and\nall this it's a certain craziness that\nnever leaves you you know you didn't\nknow boys and their toys right yeah yeah\nabsolutely did you said somewhere as\nwell that your you felt like your father\nwas maybe struggling with some\npost-traumatic stress disorder like he\nhad that energy that kind of came\nthrough onto you guys well you know my\nfather was a very complicated guy\nobviously um I never really got to know\nhim that well you know by the time I\nleft it was like I was 18 years old I\nwent in the military then I moved to\nMunich then I moved from Munich to\nAmerica so I really was not home I wish\nthe day I could have a conversation with\nhim because I'm much smarter now I'm\nmuch more interested in various\ndifferent issues like that would make\nsomeone tick would make someone you know\nhappy and suffer whatever so in those\ndays we didn't talk about any of that\nyou know so it's it's but he was\ncomplicated because he was a victim of\nthe second world war meaning that he was\ndragged in the war became a a soldier a\nNazi officer you know was shoted in in\nin Stalingrad or Leningrad I should say\nand and he was you know buried on the\nrubble of of buildings that collapsed on\ntop of him for three days and then he\nhad back surgeries and then he was\nshipped back home to Austria and that\nactually probably would saved him\nbecause he got out of Russia uh just\nsome time before the whole thing\ncollapsed wow and so it it it created a\ncertain kind of a thing he had malaria\nso he was suffering from malaria he was\nsuffering from shrubs moving around in\nhis body he was depressed obviously that\nthey lost the war in the first place so\nthat must have had an impact on all this\nman because everyone around me when I\ngrew up was kind of drinking and so the\npeople only drink when they're really\nunhappy you know or you drink a glass of\nwine mhm like I sometimes do but not to\nget drunk per say like they did so there\nwas a lot of drinking going on a lot of\nviolence going on hitting the kids not\njust my dad hitting me or my brother but\nthe neighbor hit his kids and the other\nneighbor hit it I me as a matter fact a\nregular kind of a parent teachers day\nwill be when the parents come into the\nclassroom they will go up to the teacher\nthey talk for a few minutes and then\nthey go go to the kid in the classroom\nand smack them but every parent was\nit was just the wildest kind of a thing\nit would be great for comedy today I\nthink you know because now I have to\nlaugh about it because people all kind\nof like laughing about it because we\nknew like when my dad came in you know\nhe then had this look you know first he\ntalk\nto then all a sudden was this this look\ntowards\nme then you would just come over and\nboom we smack you then we walk out and\nthen some old lady would come in with a\nwith a walking cane and she was the\ngrandmother of one of the kids that was\nsitting next to me and she would go to\nthe teacher then she would walk over\nwith her cane and she take a cane and\nsnack the kid over the head with the\ncane and so this was normal W so you\nknow so that's what I'm saying it's it\nwas such a a a different way of\nupbringing then maybe you had or that\nthe kids have today or that my kids had\nin know way there was always love and\naffection for them yes there was\ndiscipline but it was all done in a\nmeasured way and not with hitting and\nstuff like that so it's I but I think\nall of this had an impact yeah on my uh\nthe way I viewed the world and my drive\nto get out of there out of Austria and\nto come to America and to get into body\nbuilding and all those kind of things\nwhat was the most intense part of your\ninvolvement in the military what was the\nmost intense experience you had there\nobviously there was this experience at\nhome and at school as you just said but\nI think that um the\nmilitary even though when I went through\nit it was really\ntough but I have to say that when I look\nback at it I recommend it very strongly\nfor any any young man or woman as far as\nthat goes to go through that because you\nlearn how to be tough you get up at 5:\nin the morning\nyou run for an hour then you do your\nbasic training you know crawling on all\nfours and with a gun in your hand and\nshooting and learning how to drive\nmotorcycles and cars and trucks and\ntanks you learn about leadership but you\nalso learn simple things like how to\niron your shirt how to sew on buttons uh\nhow to iron you your pants how to brush\nyour shoes how to clean your shoes clean\nbelt bucklet and ERS so become kind of\nself-sufficient and it gives\nyou I think a certain amount of\nconfidence that I don't need to be\nbabied by anybody I can take care I can\ncook which you learned there in the\nBasic Foods uh as a matter we made\nscrambled eggs on top of the tank\nbecause the back of the motor would be\nso hot so we just put the eggs on top\nand just scrambled it there and ate it\noff of the tank dirty as it was right so\nbut I mean so you feel kind of like I\ncan handle food I can handle ironing my\nown stuff I can handle washing my own\nstuff I don't need anybody to do those\nkind of you know stupid jewers I can do\nit myself and I feel good doing it\nmyself so there's a lot of things like\nthat did you learn in the Army it just\ngives you a certain base where you don't\nget afraid of anything you feel like\nI've gone through all kinds of hell now\nwith the military you know they make\nsure of that and so I think that's\nthat's really terrific but I remember\nthere were times that were really tough\nlike for instance if you make a mistake\nthey will have you open up the hatch\nthat is underneath your seat\nand where the driver's seat is of the\ntank and you open up that hatch and it\nfalls out and then they have you crawl\nout of that hole and then drive then\ncrawl under the tank in a\nmud and with your uniform on and\neverything and then you have you have to\nclimb up the back of the tank up the\ndeterrent down theer back to your\ndriver's seat and then out the hole\nagain and they do that like 50 times so\nby the time you do it it's like hours\nlater and you you literally collapse\nyou're so exhausted for more this stuff\nso there's punishments like that that\nwere really really tough so I would not\nwish that on anybody to be honest with\nyou I mean I could handle it but I think\nI can I could handle it because I was 18\nyears old and you know you're very very\ntough when you're 18 you can handle just\nabout anything you know you have the\nendurance and the strength and I was I\nwas in the middle of my weightlifting\nand bodybuilding career so I was also\nstrong but it was strong World also so\nto me it was all kind of it was good but\nit was tough yeah what was your first I\nknow that you've talked about how like\nyou wanted to get out of Austria you\nwanted to get away but what was your\nfirst glimpse of America like what was\nyour first experience of the United\nStates that you had the first experience\nwas I was competing in Florida in Miami\nso to me Miami was the first experience\nreally arriving in in New York changing\nplanes and then flying to Miami I came\nfrom London to New York and then from\nNew York to Miami that to me was the\nfirst experience you know the high rises\nthe beautiful hotels the\nwater uh the boats everyone had a boat\nthere of Jesus can you believe that I\nmean everyone they have an apartment on\nthe uh at The Canal at the Waterway and\nthen they have a boat and they were just\nall cruising around and we were invited\nwith bodybuilders that were competing in\nthe competition we were invited on boat\nrides there was this one body builder\nthat had a boat for like 10 people so we\nwere going around and we saw how much\nfun they had you know how well people\nlived how happy they were to me that was\nlike a really interesting experience\nunlike the experience when I came to\nCalifornia because I felt like okay I'm\ncoming to California and I'm going to\nsee all the things that made me want to\ncome here Muscle Beach but the Muscle\nBeach by that time was\nclosed you know they closed it in the\n60s and uh so there was no Muscle Beach\nper se then Gold's Gym was not as big as\nI thought it's going to\nthe buildings when you look around out\nhere we in Venice right now it's there\nstill the day very low buildings\ncompared to the highrises in New York so\nI thought that there would be highrises\nhere also Los Angeles highrises and then\nwhen I when my friends took me\nto Hollywood they tried to convince me\nthis is Hollywood I mean look at this\nand I looked around and that just\ncouldn't see anything right so I thought\nthere would be Studios left and right of\nHollywood Boulevard there would be\nStudios there would be Paramount Studios\nthere will be Sony and then there will\nbe you know uh Colombia Disney and\nWarner Brothers and all of those Studios\nwill be lined up left and right with\nhotels and luxury and all and I go down\nto Hollywood Boulevard it was like a\nbunch of homeless people running around\nand\nWeirdos and drug artics and hippies\nand that's what I saw and that's and\ntourists you know so I said myself this\nis Hollywood they said well you you have\nto understand this is daytime at night\nit really lights up then they say well\nwhy don't you bring me here at night\nwhen it really lights up so I they took\nme at night and it was also very\ndisappointing there was a few lights and\na few Billboards but you know I just I\ncame from London right so I've been at\nthat point\nI've been several times to London\nbecause I was competing in bodybuilding\nin London and I started my bodybuilding\ncareer there so I saw pilly square and I\nsaw lights I mean I saw action it was\nlike staggering that really blew me away\nyeah you know and then driving out this\ndouble decker buses and the and the\ntransportation with the Subway or the\ntube whatever they they call underground\nwhatever they call it in England and and\nof this to me the airport the he airport\nNoti that really blew me away but when I\ncame to America when I came to Los\nAngeles I had a vision like it would be\nlike that but it wasn't and so I was\nvery very disappointed in the beginning\nuntil I got used to it and until I\nunderstood that this is earthquake\ncountry that you don't build highrises\nyou know because they would collapse MH\nlater on as time went on they figured\nout the the technology to put them on\nrollers\nuh or major tires or something like so\nthat it moves so they don't collapse but\nI mean I I learned to understand all of\nthat later on but the first thing was a\nshock to me in a negative way but then\nwhen I got used to Los Angeles and then\nI got used to the\ngym uh and used to the\nmembers and the\nkindness of the American people and the\nsweetness of the\nbodybuilders you know that would invite\nme on Thanksgiving when I didn't even\nknow what Thanksgiving was yeah and they\nwould invite me a stranger like me to\ntheir home for Thanksgiving dinner or\nthey will come and show up at my\napartment with\nsilverware because I didn't have any\nyeah with dishes with uh blankets\npillowcases bed sheets and I remember\nthis one girl gave me like a a radio a a\nwooden radio for my ant table next to\nthe bed which I still have next to my\nbed today wow so you know because I\nwanted to keep that because it was like\nit was it symbolizes whenever I look at\nthat radio it symbolizes the generosity\nof the American people and how was kind\nof like included when I moved over here\nand all of that so it was there was a\nlot of interesting lessons that have\nlearned right away when they came over\nhere you know the difference between\ncultures and all that between austrians\nand Germans and British and uh the\nAmericans and all that yeah I think a\nlot of what you just said about first\ncoming to Hollywood I think it's very\ncommon when people go to Hollywood\nBoulevard and have a very glamorous view\nof what it might be but it but it isn't\nand what you were reminding me of just\nnow is just this idea of how everyone\nhas like dreams and visions of what\nsomething might be and then when you\nexperience it\nyou get a sense of how you view it\nthrough your own eyes and for me though\nwhat I'm what I'm fascinated by is who\nwas your who is your first ever\nbodybuilding coach and do you remember\nyour first ever tournament how did it go\nyeah no I've there\nwas a fellow by the name of Kur\nmanul who was Mr Austria now you have to\nimagine when you're like 14 years old\nlike I was and\n15 Mr Austra was like oh it's a big star\nyeah he came out to that Lake where I\ngrew up it was like a lake where there\nwas on weekends like 3 4,000 people\naround that Lake lying in the grass and\nuh on blankets and then swimming in that\nLake and it it was kind of a muddy kind\nof a lake and he came out there and he\nlooked like\nGod he was very good friends with the\nswimming coach the guy that kind of took\ncare of everything there the lake\nand they were working out and they were\ninviting me to work out with\nthem so to to me that was kind of the\nfirst experience where someone kind of\ndragged me in and inspired me and I said\noh my God can you imagine looking like\nthat and\nhe if you wanted it or not happened to\nbe very good because he said to me says\nwellard in five years you could look\nlike me and I was saying I was\nvisualizing right away oh my God can you\nbelieve that if I could look like that\nand I Mr Austria you know so that was\nlike major and I just felt like this is\nalmost kind of my my new Dad yeah he was\n32 years old and he became kind of like\na mentor he invited me then first of all\nhe invited I realized that they invited\nalways these athletes out there do like\nshot Buddhas and Javelin throwers and\nweightlifters and\nboxers bodybuilders I mean all kinds of\nathlet they all work out together and\nhave a good time and we kids were kind\nof like hanging out with them every\noften we will work out with them so we\ngot so I got my real early inspiration\nthat way and then I went down to the\nclub to the weightlifting Club I started\nworking out and start really become\nreligious about it he was like this was\nmy new life\nand I started having visions very clear\nvisions of being a Mr Austria then there\nwere pictures of the Mr Europe contest\nso I visualized myself being in the Mr\nEurope contest and winning and then I\nsaw pictures of re Park which is a\nBritish bodybuilder who then\nsubsequently later on moved to South\nAfrica married a South African woman by\nthe name of Maran and uh they created a\nfamily in South Africa so that what\nbecame kind of my idol and I saw\npictures of him winning Mr Universe in\nLondon and so that was my new vision so\nI started really creating through this\nguys a vision and but that that Vision\nwas so vivid so\nclear that I felt like all I had to do\nnow is just follow through with the work\nso let me now find out what needs to be\ndone and so I I read about reg Park how\ndid he train he trained like four or\nfive hours a day and uh he didn't s so\nmany sets so many reps and these are the\nexercises he did did the bench press the\nincline PR the B the curl the shoulders\npresses and the this and that and I just\nwrote everything down and I started\nfollowing his routine and I was\nabsolutely convinced that I will be\nanother Rich Park and so that's how I\nreally developed my first rule that I\nalways talk about to success is you got\nto have a very clear a vision yes of\nwhere you want to go because if you\ndon't have that you're just floating\naround and so you know I was very\nfortunate that I created that Vision I\nwas very fortunate that there was not\nthe site kind of things going on we\ndidn't have a phone in our house we\ndidn't have a television in our house oh\nat that time there were no iPhones there\nwere no iPads there was no computer\nthere was just really you had all the\nTime in the World to think and to really\njust sit quietly and to just\nvisualize and I always say that I feel\nsorry for kids today that they spending\nhours and hours on that iPhone or on\niPad or computer and they don't give\nthemselves that chance to just settle\nback and to just figure out what do they\nwant to do or who do they want to be and\nuh so this is why I think think that I\nmade that kind of the rule number one is\nyou know visualize now always compared\nto that you can have the best airplane\nin the\nworld uh with the most advanced pilot\nbut if he doesn't know where to go it's\njust going to fly around and it crashes\nand that's what happens to you in life\nif you don't know where you want to go\nand what who you want to be you\neventually just float around and you\neventually crash and uh that's why a lot\nof people are unhappy yeah they or they\ntake drugs or they drink or the suicide\nriness I think a lot of it has to do\nbecause people really don't have as much\nof a purpose and the mission and the\nvision and all of the things the things\nthat drove me from the time I was like\n15 years old it was very clear which\ndirection I want to go yeah I love that\nyou start the book with that rule of\nhave a Clear Vision because when you\nhear about your\nchildhood it's not easy it's tough it's\nrough it's harsh there's so many\ninternal challenges at home there's\nexternal challenges there's limitations\nthat you're in a country that's\nobviously just survived a World War it\nalmost looks like there is no space to\nhave Vision that's right like someone\ncould argue that yeah Arnold like I mean\nhow are you having a vision in this\nspace I think what's really interesting\nis sometimes we feel helpless because of\nwhere we're born where we're from our\nparenting structure our surroundings\nsome people struggle to have a vision\nbecause they say well how can I have a\nvision I'm look where I am and then some\nother people they can't have a vision\nbecause when they see someone like reg\npark or Mr Austria in your example what\nthey see is oh Envy I wish I had that\nyou know like oh why does he have that\nor maybe you know I should have that so\nI think we live in these two worlds\nwhere we either feel helpless or\nsometimes we feel envious and\negotistical about Visions how how did\nyou allow yourself or how did you\ndevelop that ability that even though\naround you there wasn't that much\nsuccess there was more stress but you\nsaw Mr Austrian and were able to do that\ndo have you ever figured out what that\nwas compared to everyone else you grew\nup around I just can tell you I was very\nunhappy yeah I was unhappy with the\nreality of what was around me you know\nthe tough parents and the lack of food\nand others had Stakes we didn't have the\nmoney for that as a matter of fact we\nnever ate meat during the week now the\nday they would say oh this is really\ngood because you were vegan as a kid but\nit was more because of a lack of money\nuh so we didn't have anything so\neverywhere I looked so I think to me the\nonly way\nreally was in order to be happy is to\ncreate my own world and to visualize you\nknow that's why people sometimes read a\nlot because they want to escape into\nanother story or the day they watch\nmovies to go and to see another to\nescape into another story and all stuff\nfor me that wasn't available in the\nfirst movie I was saw was like when I\nwas like nine or 10 years old was not\nthe common thing in the village where I\ngrew up to go to movies and I remember\nthere was this collapsible kind of a\nseat I just fell right down on a on on a\nfloor because I had never even heard of\na collapse was that you have to fold it\ndown folded it down then waited a little\nbit and then of course it went back up\nagain and I went right down on the the\nfloor so because of that world that\nnegative world I had to kind of create\nmy\nown world so I was just always\ndaydreaming of wonderful things so it\nwas I developed that art and it put a\nsmile on my face yeah so clearly when I\nthen saw uh Mr Austria Mr Universe and I\nsaw this guys and so photo photographs\nof it and read about it in the magazines\nI created my vision and I saw in that\nVision myself being up on that stage and\nI saw myself you know people screaming\naround\nme um and screaming ah Lord AR Lord and\nand all this crazy stuff it was all\ninsane crazy stuff uh stuff that I never\nshared in those days with anybody\nbecause they would have put me in the\nmental institution right so I mean so I\nwas just I just remember that I was\nsitting in a classroom in school I was\nlike 13 years old 14 years old the\nteacher will be where you are now in\nfront of me teaching and I would just\nslowly look off to the side out the\nwindow there saw the screen\ntrees and then all a sudden I said\nseeing\nthings and I had a smile it's just was\nwonderful stuff to us all and I said I\nhad a chalk landed on my forehead so the\nteacher threw a chalk at me kind of\nsaying hey I'm here I'm getting paid to\nteach you to teach this class of 30 why\nare you looking out the window now I\ncouldn't even articulate that this what\nyou're teaching here doesn't really blow\nup my skirt it it's like it's not like\nkind of something that I'm interested\nwhat I'm interested in is what I just\nsaw when I looked out there and I saw\nmyself on that stage in London at the M\nUniverse contest you know and so things\nlike that so so I think that with\nme visualizing became a normal thing and\nI never really knew that I had really a\nvery special ability to visualize and to\nconnect the dots to say myself well if I\ncan see it\nthen it must be a\nreality and I can make it a reality so\nfor me the vision became a reality so it\nwas only then a matter of following\nthrough with the work to get there and\nthis is why in the book yes one of the\nthings I talk about is work your ass off\nbecause every single time when I had a\nvision about anything yeah I had to work\nmy ass off but it was pleasure yeah see\nthat is the great thing when you go to\nwork and you know exactly why you're\nworking then it becomes funh a challenge\nMH it's entertaining sometimes and um\nwhen you\nread that\n78% of the American people hate their\njobs now think about that I mean that\nmust be so depressing that you go let's\nsay you in working some car plant and\nyou do like you know kind of the same\nwork putting a window into a car over\nand over you know 50 times a day every\nday all year long for 30 years I mean it\nit's tough and so this is why it's so\nimportant that we really have a Clear\nVision so that you know where to go and\nthat wherever it is if it is to become a\ngreat autome mechanic or if it is to\nbecome a great teacher or politician or\na high-tech engineer whatever it is but\nhave a vision and then you go after that\nand you shoot for that because now every\nstep of the way is going to be great you\nknow when when you pick uh a doctor say\nI want to be a doctor I want to be a\nsurgeon a kid says to himself at the age\nof well from that point on he knows yeah\nall the classes he has to take already\nin high school and then when he goes to\ncollege he knows which university did to\ngo what kind of classes is to take and\nthen how long would it take him and all\nthe stuff so there is a reason for going\nto school rather than oh my parents told\nme that I have to go to college and you\njust go to fulfill this obligation but\nthere's no goal yeah that's what happens\nto a majority of of kids today they\ndon't have the goal and that's why they\nend up being one of the 78% that are\nunhappy with their jobs and they wish\nthey could change jobs but but then it's\ntoo late because now you've created a\nfamily and you have to pay for you know\nyour rent for the apartment and you have\nto put food on the table you have to\nprovide money for the kids and for your\nwife and for the family and all this\nstuff so it's really tough so that's why\nso many people are really always looking\nfor an answer or searching for an answer\nhow can I improve my life how can kind\nof make it a little bit better and all\nthis stuff and this is why I did the\nbook you it be useful I'm glad that you\nput it in that order though because I\nthink for everyone who's listening and\nwatching a lot of people will say I do\nwork hard I'm working my ass off I'm\nworking my socks off I'm like doing\neverything I can but I think what's\nreally important is that in the book you\nstart with have a Clear Vision yeah and\nI agree I think there are a lot of\npeople who are working really really\nhard and it's almost like if that hard\nwork was channeled toward a Clear Vision\nas you say then that hard work pays off\nright because otherwise a lot of people\njust working hard getting stressed\nputting on pressure but there isn't that\nVision have you found what was the\ngreatest sacrifice you ever made in your\nlife do you think and what was the\nreward that you gained from it what was\nthe biggest sacrifice that is really the\nquestion\nis is it really a sacrifice because you\nlove it\nexactly to me it's also a real question\nis the word discipline because I tell\nyou I felt many\ntimes that I'm not a discipline\nperson but people always insist and say\noh it must take so much discipline every\nday to get up and every day you were in\na gym at 7: in the morning and you\nworked at 9:30 in the morning and then\nyou went to college after that and then\nyou went this and this and you worked on\nconstruction I was like looking forward\nto getting up in the morning and looking\nforward driving to the gym and working\nout 2 and a half hours and then going\ndown to the beach and taking a run in a\ndeep sand and uh getting some cardio\nwork down and or of I said I was looking\nforward to it it was not like oh my God\nI have to do another workout yes you do\nthat when for instance sometimes people\ngo to the gym and the doctor says you\nknow you should go to the gym and you\nshould work out because otherwise you\nknow I see some problems coming up high\ncholesterol and body fat and this and\nthat and you're going to go and wipe out\nyou know 10 years younger than you want\nto if there ever the right time to wipe\nout but I mean in any case so that\nperson you can see in the gym is there\nand they just they do their reps and\nthey do their sets and they're not\nreally into it you can see there's no\nlife in the eyes you know what I'm\nsaying where there like they really they\ngrab the weight and they do the sets and\nthey get the pump and they feel good\nthey put the weights down and get the\nnext heavier weight and they do said and\nso that's really fun but that person is\nkind of like a vegetable in a way they\njust cruise around in the gym they sit\non the life cyc and they just pedal away\nand when you say to them is Sister why\ndo you work out they have no answer then\neventually they say well to be honest\nwith you the doctor told me that I\nshould get in shape that's better for my\nhealth to bring my blood pressure down\nand my cholesterol down and my body fat\ndown and all so they're not really so I\nsay to them always I said you know what\nyou should do is you should just pick a\ngoal that you can\nchase they we say like what I said what\nhow much do you weigh mhm I'm weighing\n190 lbs and I want to I want to lower my\nbody fat body weight I said well why\ndon't you pick a goal like you want to\ngo down to 170 m and it and is now\nMarch and by\nAugust when you go to the beach you're\ngoing to have a slim waste less body fat\nand you look leaner and you can be proud\nof your\nbody as it pick that go oh that's a good\nidea I say write it down and then write\ndown the sets you have to do to get you\nthere and the amount of reps you have to\ndo and the amount of life cycle that you\nhave to run and regular bicycle and\nrunning that you have to do right off of\nthis down and then you mark it off every\nday you mark it off that's what I did to\nme that was really the that feedback\nthat I see aligned being crossed it\nmeans one was said was done it was a\nsatisfying kind of a thing the line was\ncrossed off the next line was crossed\noff and so I tell people that and then\nthey just say oh my God this is yeah\nyeah I'm going to do that that's such a\ngreat idea then they come back to me\nlike a few months later and they said\nthis worked it was unbelievable it\nworked it was fantastic and it really\ngave me a purpose see so that's what\nit's it's why it's so important they\nhave a purpose when you do things they\nhave a Clear Vision when they do because\nthen you don't have to look at it kind\nof like I have to be really disciplined\nto do that or I have to make certain\nsacrifices to do that because then it\njust drags you in that direction and you\njust do the work you know so that's what\nI think is always said but clearly there\nwere sacrifices like friend let me just\ngive you one example what do you think\nit's like when you go and you run for\ngovernor and you promise the people that\nyou are going to be my number one\npriority now you\nwin now you have to do the work but now\nwe come\nhome and your kids are\ncrying on the dinner table when you come\nhome and daddy didn't come to my recital\non\nMonday daddy you didn't come to my\nfootball practice on Tuesday daddy you\npromised me did you come into the school\nand you take me to school you didn't\nthis\nweek so that is devastating when the\nkids are\ncrying and\ncomplaining and you say to\nyourself you know I promised the people\nthat they're number one but I also\npromised my family I promised my wife\nwhen we the first child that they're\ngoing to be number one so that's a\ndilemma now you're in a dilemma and now\nyou have to make certain sacrifices and\nI had to make certain sacrifices when it\ncomes to spending time with my family\nwhere my wife had to pick up the slacks\nand she had to do the extra work so\nthere were sacrifices made that were\npainful sometimes when you see your kids\ncrying that's painful and then you know\nit's your fault but that's the situation\nyou're in and you put yourself in the\nsituation you had a choice to run for\ngovernor or not to run for governor\nright if I would have continued with my\nmovie business those kids were in heaven\nbecause they were in a movie in my make\nup trailer they were watching me getting\nmade up as the Terminator uh or for any\nof those kind of movies they were in my\nmotor home and they were doing their\nhomework in the afternoon there they\nbrought their friends with them so that\nwas fun now all of a sudden they go up\nto Sacramento and everyone is running\naround with a\nsuit and with a tie and they come to me\nand says Dad what is this what did you\ndo why are you having this job now they\nwere like 11 12 years old and they said\nwhy do you have this job now I said\neveryone has a suit in a tie and\neveryone looks really serious and they\nall attack you they say bad things about\nyou I say what this the way is politics\nI say as soon as you run first you have\nlike a 80% popularity and then as soon\nas you run this your popularity goes\ndown to 50% because 50% of the other\nside uh the other party so you run as a\nrepublican say 50% of the Democrats they\nhate you or they don't like you and then\nthat the Republicans like you but they\ndon't even like you because say yeah\nit's do to socially liberal whatever so\nso so so my campaign manager always say\nthis is honold 20% of the people hate\ntheir mother so don't worry about\nsomeone hating you that's just the way\nit is in politics you know so anyway so\nthis is so you have to make sacrifices\nlike that imagine a sacrifice you have\nto take when you come to this country I\nmean you know what it's is like you\nleave everything behind my friends mhm\nmy parents my relatives everything that\nwas around me that was kind of like a\nsure thing mhm I had a job after the\nmilitary that I could go to the continue\non the job that they did as a Salesman I\nhad all of this their left orders for\nuncertainty because there was no\ncertainty Coming to America there was\nJoe weer that said I'm going to help you\nfind your apartment I find your car yes\nthere were some people that helped a lot\nhe's the one that gave me the airline\nticket to come to America or of CHA is\nthe publisher of the muscle magazines he\nhas passed away in the in the meantime\nbut I mean he was like the guru of\nbodybuilding he created bodybuilding the\nFederation was created by his brother\nBen weer and Joe had the endless amount\nof magazines and a Distribution Company\nfor weight equipment for food\nsupplements and all that so he brought\nme here so there was some help like this\nbut I mean I I walked away from all of\ndiscomfort didn't come to America so yet\nthere were major major sacrifices like\nthat but I really never looked at it in\nthat way because I just said to myself I\nwant to go to America I want to go and\nbe there and work my way up to become\nthe greatest bodybuilder of all times\nand that's you know we are talking about\none of the other rules is in in my book\nwhich is that to shoot for big goals\nyeah never think small is just as much\nenergy or as little energy as shooting\nfor little goal you know it's just is\nmuch h mean if a little girl like say if\nI would say I want to be Mr Austria well\nthat's as much working out than working\nout for Mr Europe or Mr Universe so I\nmean you might as well just continue on\nand just say okay all I have to do now\nthe difference really is that you have\nto become real professional you have to\nknow how to pose you have to have the\nright tan you have to take the right\nfood supplements you have to eat the\nright food you have to really find tune\nyou have to get the definition it's not\njust the size of the body so the higher\nup you go the more complicated you gets\nto win and so but I said to myself to me\nto shoot for the goal of being a world\nchampion it's just as easy as shooting\nfor goal of being Mr Austria being the\nAustrian Champion so I would just went\nall out and not only do to win the World\nChampionships in bodybuilding but to go\nbeyond reg Park who won at that point\nthree Mr Universe titles to go beyond\nthat and they say I want to actually\nbecome the greatest bodybuilder of all\ntime all times that there was that that\nmy my go and so that's why I had to come\nto America where there is Muscle Beach\nwhere there's Gold Gym where all the\nChampions work out together where\nthere's Joe weeder that can be helpful\nand publish you and put you on the cover\nof his magazines and all this to do the\npromotion the campaign the training the\nmarketing of bodybuilding and all that\nso I to me this was really the only way\nto go is to come to Los Angeles and on\ntop of it Los Angeles is known for\nHollywood MH and this is my next career\nso I always say to myself the with re\nPark I saw him in Hercules movies so can\nyou believe that that this guy won Mr\nUniverse three times and then he was\ndiscovered in Rome in\nchinita and they saw him there and they\nsaid oh my God you are Hercules Hercules\nwe going to send you to acting classes\ninto acting school and you're going to\nplay\nand then Steve Reeves did the same thing\nwho was another Mr Universe from 1940 no\n1950 yeah Steve re 1950 R Park 1951 so\nboth of them became Hercules then there\nwas many other bodybuilders that became\nthey did Hercules movies or those\nGladiator movies and muscle movies and\nstuff like that in the 60s it would\nbecame very famous but the mean I said\nmyself if R Park could get into the\nmovies maybe when I go to America and\nand I become the world's greatest\nbodybuilder then they would ask me to go\nin the movies and so this is was the\nidea so to me it was natural oh I said\nmyself there's Hollywood in Los Angeles\nthere's Muscle Beach in Los Angeles\nthere's G gy in Los Angeles there's chaa\nhere this is perfect I have to go there\nthat was the reason why I went here did\nyou ever have a plan B I never believed\nin Plan B uh because I felt kind of like\none of the rules we have in the in my\nbook is never listen to the naysayers\nyeah you know to me I always felt kind\nof like every single dream of mine of\ncourse I have to say they were\noutrageous\ndreams so people said this is stupid\nyeah what is the matter with you that\nwould never happen I mean your dream is\nto go go to America what do you think\nthey're waiting for you over there I\nmean there have plenty of people over\nthere there have over 300 million\npopulation they don't need anymore and\nso that was the kind of saying he said\nyou would never make it to America and\nthey don't need you so no impossible\nwhen I said I want to be a world\nchampion in bodybuilding it was\nimpossible when I said I want to get\ninto movies that was impossible so it\nwas always impossible so I felt that we\ncan go and defend ourselves from that\nand just not listen to the\nnaysayers but if I start having a plan B\nthen all of a sudden I'm becoming in way\nand they say it to myself wow yeah true\nso because that means now that I'm\nsaying well maybe this isn't working out\nand if it's not working out we should\nhave a plan B so to me this is the most\ndangerous of all of the naysayers is me\nsaying no and it's impossible maybe to\nmyself so therefore I felt the best way\nof handling that is is not to have a\nsafety net and not to have a Plan B that\nI'm at risk and therefore I have to be\nat all times on the edge MH and a 10 so\nI don't fall where I would need a safety\nnet yeah this is the way I dealt with\nthat issue never have a plan B always go\nfor go all out with my plan and really\nput 100% of effort into it in order to\nreally achieve it and and I just always\nbelieved in my goals I mean I remember\nwhen I ran for governor and and people\nsaid you're crazy I mean you know this\ngreat Davis is going to take you out and\nthen if he doesn't boost the M the\nlieutenant governor these are all\nseasoned politicians you don't know\nanything about politics and blah blah\nblah why don't you run first for mayor\nand why don't you do this no I was very\nclear with my vision I could see myself\nas the governor because I felt that the\npeople in California were very upset at\nthe regular politicians I mean they were\nalways talking about what they\nknow and how smart they are and how\nthey're going to fix things in the\nmeantime we had the $30 billion\ndeficit in the meantime we had blackouts\nin the meantime they were handing out\ndriver's license to illegal immigrants\nwhat they call undocumented immigrants\nand and everything that the people were\nagainst and the people didn't like\nIndian gaming tribes were gambling and\nhaving gambling casinos but not paying\ntaxes so they were mad about that so I\nwould just tell people if I become\ngovernor I would change all that and the\nworkers compensation costs for\nbusinesses in California I will cut that\nin half that's why so many businesses\nleft California because of the cost of\ndoing business so I said I would cut it\nin half and so this exactly people\nbought in because I was talking\nbelievable I mean there was I could put\nmy hand in the fire for the people to do\nthe things that I promised those things\nwill be done and I said I would do most\nof those things before breakfast the\nfirst day when I'm in office so that\nalways sounded good so in any case so\nbut the people bought in and I remember\nthat when President Bush and uh this gu\ncalled me from the White House and they\nsaid you want the president to come out\nto campaign for you I said no no no no\nno I said because then it becomes kind\nof a political thing but the Republicans\nare helping each other and then great\nDavis is going to have out you know Bill\nClinton and Al Gore and John KY and you\nknow all of those guys and that's\nexactly what happened he had all those\npeople come out campaign for him and I\ntold all of my guys no don't come\nout because I wanted to be the\nDavid and not the Goliath I want to be\nthe underdog and kind of say look this\nis just between me and the voters so\nthat was my vision not a a political\nstrategy Vision but I mean that was my\nvision I said I have to be the person\nthat is by himself that is kind of\ncrawling up there and that is\ncommunicating with the voters I don't\nneed someone to speak for me or anything\nlike that yes you have you uh\ncommunications director and all stuff\nbut I didn't need to have President Bush\ncome out and speak for me I didn't have\nto have the vice president come out to\nspeak for or anything like this I wanted\nthis between me and the thing and it\nworked people figured it out that I'm\nout there that I'm promising them and\nthey bought into it and and and they won\nand so this is why it is so important\nthat that you have really a 100% belief\nand not having to go and say my plan B\nif this doesn't work is I'm going to go\nback to movies well that will unfold\nanyway you know so but let's first go\nall out and not have a plan B this is\nthe thing and so I've never had a plan B\nyeah no really really great clarity\nagain of just determination that there's\nno other options and and I like what you\nsaid or what really connected with me at\nleast is this idea of how you can become\nyour own naysayer right that having a\nplan B is you talking yourself out of\nwhy you should go all in or or you ready\nputting it on on on um kind of shaky\ngrounds the goal yeah you're already\nsetting you already say well if what\nwait a minute if you say if that means\nthere's a possibility in your mind this\ncould fail and that is a dangerous road\nto go yeah I think I agree where where\ndid you go when a few moments ago you\nwere talking about how the kids are UPS\nET when you're Governor obviously public\ngets upset when someone's in a position\nof power you've got all these people who\nrely on you personally and\nprofessionally and you even said to\nyourself like I couldn't really talk\nabout it you can't really no one can\nreally understand that what did you do\nat that time where did you go for\nconnection and understanding and even\ngetting to talk to yourself at that time\nwell you just have to\nfind um you know a compromise\nso what you then do is you just say okay\nI'm going to go and spend an extra day\nat home so because it was the choice\nbeing in Los Angeles a lot of days or to\nbe in Sacramento so I spent four days a\nweek in Sacramento and three days a week\nin Los Angeles and I decided then to\nspend another day in Los Angeles and to\ngo to this school recital or to go to\nsome kind of a practice sessions of uh\nyou know my kid playing football or\nbaseball or something like that and to\ngo to those things so to figure out a\nway and it didn't take anything away\nfrom my public service but it gave a\nlittle bit more time FaceTime for the\nkids and you know it really is\nabsolutely crucial for the kids not just\nto see their mom coming to school but\nthey need their dad also you know and so\nthat's exactly what it did and I totally\nunderstood I talked to my wife about it\nbut like I said and the aunt she was\nreally the one that was uh the\nPowerHouse in the family because she\nspent I would say 80% of the time with\nthe kids and I did 20% because I was\nstuck in Sacramento and even though she\nworked also as first lady and she was in\nSacramento but she spent much more time\nwith the kids and luckily when you have\na good partner then you can do a lot of\nthose things alone I couldn't have done\nit yeah definitely and you you mentioned\nI think in the documentary too that if\nthere was an Oscars for divorces then\nyou should get one because of how even\nin that circumstance you both have found\na way to let the kindness be even the\nway you're speaking about the family\ntoday because it's it's kind of the most\nimportant thing\nis it's one thing if you suffer through\nit it's another thing if your wife\nsuffers through it but the kids are\nreally totally innocent bystanders right\nso we had to my wife and I were very\ngood in working together so the kids\ndon't really feel a bump in the road and\nthat things are smooth for them and uh\nagain it's important I mean I saw it\nvery clearly that it can be done MH and\nwe we did it and we were very happy with\nwith the outcome we very very proud of\nour kids I mean they're extraordinary\nyeah I had the fortune of interviewing\nKatherine probably a couple of years ago\nwhen her book came out yeah yeah so I\ngot to have some interaction with her\nand Maria and I've had several\ninteractions too and Catherine is a\ncarbon copy of Maria and Maria is a\ncarbon copy of Unice Unice is a carbon\ncopy of Rose Kennedy so this is how it\ngoes down I mean it's like a they're\nlike\nclones they're exactly you know exactly\nwhat you get from them I mean it's like\nuh Catherine I mean I'm so proud of her\nof what a woman she has become and so is\nwith Christina with my other daughter MH\nand and the boys it's just it's a lot of\nfun I never thought that having kids\nwould be that much fun I said Miss\nbecause I only in the beginning I always\nthought about you know the work that it\nwould take you know to take them to\nschool and to go to their recital and\nthe practices and to teach them and to\nhave the swimming coach over and you\nknow you have to just be part of\neverything you have to teach them teach\nthem you know from just swimming to\nrunning to football to water skiing snow\nSK keying uh you know you have to just\nbe on top of everything and also um\nhaving animals because one of the most\nimportant things with kids is if you\nhave the space that is if you're in a\nlittle tiny apartment then maybe a cat\nis good but I mean normally it's kind of\nlike good when you have dogs or when you\nhave like we have a miniature pony we\nhad horses a donkey in a Lulu The Miner\ndonkey we had pigs\nnow I have a pig again even though the\nkids are not there anymore it never\nstops but I mean so because the kids\ngrow up with these animals and you teach\nthem how to take care of them this is\nextremely important because they have to\nhave a sense of responsibility you can't\njust say oh I would like to have a\nrabbit or I would like to have a pig\nyeah but you take care of it so that's\nwhat they've learned yeah one of the\nlessons in your book is sell sell sell\nand we just talked about it now when you\nwere talking about almost selling\nyourself to become governor there's a\ncertain promotion marketing approach to\ngalvanizing people to get behind you and\nI think the word sales and selling has a\nlot of a lot of people have a negative\nconnotation or a difficulty with selling\nbecause it almost feels like they has to\nbe something fake about it I've always\nfound that if you're proud of what\nyou're selling if you really believe in\nit then it's easier to sell it but\ngenerally people have a challenge with\nlike the word sell but you say one of\nyour lessons is sell sell sell so walk\nus through how you were able to I mean\nobviously even all your all the movies\nthe franchises you've created it\nrequires promotion it requires selling\nand of course they were highly\nentertaining but tell us what you\nlearned about how to sell effectively\nbut also authentically first of all I\nthink you're totally right yeah that the\nword\nselling sometimes comes off sleep easy\nso that's why I can call it promotion or\ncommunicating or whatever you call it\nand the point of it\nis that you can have the best product in\nthe world but if no one knows about it\nwhat's the point of the product I mean I\nwould like I'd like to\nknow uh for instance if there is someone\nout there that does a heart\nsurgery or valve replacement without\nhaving to have open heart surgery yeah\nbut if I don't know I would just go to\nthe hospital and say I want to have open\nheart surgery and I want to get the\nvalve replaced but if I know because\nthey promoted it well I can go now and\ncall that expert and then go so this is\nwhy I think it's it's it's so important\nso to me I\nlearned the art of selling way back when\nI was 15 years old when I was in trade\nschool and when I was working for this\nlumber yard kind of construction company\nhard Weare store it was like a\ncombination of things we were taught how\nto sell uh the\nmerchandise and then sometimes we were\nable to follow the guy that is the boss\nand he one time said to Mrs\nArnold when I he help me here and he\nwould talk uh to the customer and I\nrealized quickly that there was\nsomething art going on that all of a\nsudden his attention focused on the wife\nwas is couple they wanted to have some\nyou know tiles for the bathroom and for\nthe kitchen and he first talk to him and\nhow much money does he want to spend and\nall the stuff what colors all then all a\nsudden he was like he ended up only\ntalking to the woman so he says so what\ndid you learn I said well I learned that\nyou were really very clear about all the\nadvantages and disadvantages of the\nvarious different tiles and the various\ndifferent colors that we he says yeah\nyeah that's that that's right but it's\none dimension but what else I don't know\nit says did you see how I shifted and my\nattention went from the husband to the\nwife I said yeah yeah what was that all\nabout and he says well I realized that\nhe had really no interest in the tiles\nwhat color it should be what type real\ntiles or fake tiles or or or what it was\nher\nvision and it was her desire to have new\ntiles and he just went along with it\nbecause he's the husband he's the\nprovider of the family he makes the\nmoney she didn't make the money uh but\nshe had a very clear vision of what she\nwanted so I shifted my focus because I\nrealized that she is the customer not\nhim and you got to go and be able to\nreach the\ncustomer and this is why I started\ntalking to her more he was then he just\nout of courtesy said him so what do you\nthink should I delivered on Thursday and\nsays yeah whenever he would just always\nsay whatever and she says Friday is\nbetter because Friday my husband is at\nhome in the afternoon so you can help me\ncarrying all this stuff up to the second\nfloor and blah so she was much more\nprecise and so that's why he spent most\nof his time that so those are the things\nthat I've learned when I was selling and\nhow important it is to actually let the\npeople know that you have this product I\nwas I went right after that a few years\nlater I went to Munich and I after the\nmilitary served there as a trainer in a\nbodybuilding gym and we had like I\nremember 280 members and there was\nanother gym in Munich that had 500\nmembers and that guy his name was\nReinhard molana he was Mr Europe and I\nwas at this point not Mr Europe yet I\nwas Junior Mr Europe but not Mr Europe n\nyet and I didn't compete in any other\nInternational competitions so I was\ntraining really hard I said myself if I\ncould go to the Mr Universe contest and\nI compete and I do really well I could\nmaybe outo him and so this what I did I\ntrained really hard for months and then\nin September was the Mr Universe end of\nSeptember Mr Universe contest and I\nhappen to play second which they call\nrunner up yes so so this was my goal at\nthat point was to be in the top six\nbecause I was 19 years old here was\nsecond place winner so when I came back\nfrom London to Munich I ran around on a\nconstruction site with just a baithing\nsuit on like a\nlunatic and everyone was dressed up in\ntheir suits and everything and they said\nwhat is this guy doing I was walking\naround on the construction site and\ngreeting people and all this stuff\nhoping that some press will show up\nbecause there's this crazy guy running\naround in the cold weather with just a\nba little bathing suit and true enough\nnewspaper showed up a photographer\nshowed up and they asked me afterwards\nwhy are you running around like that and\nI said well I want to make sure that my\ngymnasium Universal gym is in a\nnewspaper I said that's okay well let's\ntake a good shot when don't you take\nthis saw over there and you help this\nguy with the construction set doing some\ncutting of the wood and stuff and then\nwe would take we would create some\npictures that are really funny and they\nput it in the newspaper the next day and\nit says Schwarzenegger just came back\nfrom Mr Universe was run up in the Mr\nUniverse contest which makes him the\nbiggest title holder in Germany wow so I\nmade it clear that they know that not\nthat the Mr Europe is bigger but the\nsecond in the Mr Universe is the biggest\ntitle holder so so that was like I was\nnow that story was in the paper\nand we had within no time we had beaten\nhim with the gy gymnasium membership and\nhad over 500 and his was low and he I\nremember him calling so I worked out him\nmyself in his gym because we worked out\ntogether because it's much better when\nyou have a good training partner that is\na champion himself and we were laughing\nabout it so then just to show you how\nimportant promotion is so then he\nstarted secretly posting posters all\nover the city on construction sites the\nsmana gym we train you you become a\nchampion more energy healthier body this\nthis and that and all this stuff so when\nI saw the posters I said I'm going to go\nand create posters myself for the gym so\nwe created posters and then we went I\nfollowed\nhim with the\ncar and he was going at 10:00 at night\non\nFriday putting the posters up there and\nthen after you put the poster up with\nthe glue he then left and then I put my\nposter on top of his wet glue because I\ncame right after him I didn't wait until\nit tries went after him and glued my\npost on top of him and so this was kind\nof like the poster War amongst the gym\nowners it was hilarious but it was all\nit was all about selling memberships\nbecause I know that my salary comes and\nis getting paid for from those monies\nthat are coming in from the members and\nso I wanted to be able to buy food\nsupplements I wanted to be able to buy\nmyself good food and the the trips to\nthose various different competitions in\norder so it was very important that our\nmembership goes up that we are very\nsuccessful but it's all about selling\nand so when I came to America they was\nin my blood now selling and and and\ncommunicating and promoting so when I\ndid my I remember my book promotion onor\nthe education of a\nbodybuilder Simon and chst wanted to\nhave it you to sell 100,000 copies MH so\nI said well I want to have it on the\nbestseller list I know no bodybuilding\nmagazine was ever on the best seller\nlist forget about that I said well I\nsaid let's give it a shot how many\ncities do we go and promote the book and\nhe says well here has six cities I I\nsuggest and so I said to him I said one\nof go to 30 cities are you crazy so he\nwas laughing but then I put together a\nschedule and for 30 cities in 30\ndays and I was crisscrossing America I\nwas going from 90 degree temperature in\nMiami up to Minnesota there was like you\nknow below zero so it was literally like\n100 degree temperature differences in\nthe same day so this is how much I\ncrisscrossed this country and and it was\nabsolutely fantastic we w a bestseller\nlist we sold you know 250,000 hard\ncovers or whatever it was and it was\nlike a total smash as a bodybuilding and\nfitness book wow and so this is again\nover and over again I've seen that not\njust the willpower to succeed but to be\nable to sell and to communicate and to\nbe out and actually talk about it you\nknow uh I think it's important to let\npeople know you don't have to force the\nissue Into the Heart cell where you talk\nabout all the time buy my book and buy\nthis and buy this is the only way you're\ngoing to stay healthy and all no you\ndon't have to do that it's just in an\nindirect way but the key thing is that\nwhen people walk away from the interview\nthat they know about it and this is also\nvery important like for instance when\nwhen um we were doing Johnny Carson show\nyou know I was learning at that time\nabout bridging you know where you to\nbridge from a specific subject that\nsomeone asks you to then what you want\nto talk about it's it's an art you know\nso my friend was vice president of\nNationwide Insurance and he told me\nabout it he said that he has taken many\nseminars about you know promotion\nbecause Insurance business is very\nimportant that you promote and that you\ncommunicate and publicize and all this\nand so I asked him about it and he told\nme he says well bridging is one of the\nmost important things so he taught me\nabout that and uh of course was on\nJohnny Carson Show MH promoting Conan\nthe paparian just to give you an example\nand Johnny Carson was say say so Anor\nthis is really unbelievable he say how\nlong you been working out when did you\nstart and why did you start working out\nso I said to myself okay if I answer\nthis question in a thorough way even\nwould to sell one\nticket to go to see Conan yeah yeah so I\nsaid I got to go and\nBridge and so what I did was they\nanswered very briefly because because\nyou have to otherwise it sounds stupid\nif you talk about something else but I\nwould say say Johnny it's a very good\nquestion to say it was 15 but I tell you\nat 15 I did not\nknow that one time it is absolutely\nessential to have this kind of a body it\nsay imagine Conan the\nBarbarian the way Frank fretta painted\ncone in the bararan with the muscles and\nwith the determination and all this\nstuff\nand there was no one around to do this\ncharacter that's why they've never\nfilmed Conan I said now here I come Mr\nUniverse body and now I do con the\nBarbarian and it is now believable\nbecause people going to see me handle\nthe sword and killing all these people I\nsaid it's believable because they see\nthe muscles so I said nothing my wildest\ndreams with 15 did I think that one day\nthose muscles will be so important in\nthe movies and stuff like that and so I\nsold now I answer this question I start\nwith 15 but I sold Conan the Barbarian\nyou know the muscles and the fight\nscenes and you then would add on and\nsaid that was this one scene with the\ncamel and I punched out the camel and\nblah so you then just spice it up and so\nthis is what you know selling and\ncommunicating is all about I was very\nfortunate that my head was in that so\nmuch because when I was governor\nthat is the most important thing to\ncommunicate to the people because\notherwise how do you get their vote yeah\nright so you need the people you need to\ngo and say Here's why we need\ninfrastructure we need to rebuild our\nroads we need to build extra freeways\nextra highways extra tunnels and bridges\nand on- ramps and off ramps I say why\nbecause you want to go to your kids\nschool and watch them play football you\ndon't want to be late two hours as how\nmany people get stuck in traffic\neveryone will be raising their hands\nthey say well let's eliminate it let's\nterminate this problem let's build more\nroads vote Yes and Proposition 1 a so I\nexplained it to them not just talking\nabout infrastructure which politicians\nnormally do but people don't know what\ninfrastructure is I cannot expect them\nto know what infrastructure is is it the\nelectric lines the power lines is it the\nplumbing is it the sewage is it the\nbuilding freeways is it building High\nspeeed rail what is infrastructure well\nall of this is infrastructure but so now\nyou have to explain it to people by\nsaying do you ever get stuck in traffic\nof course everyone does so then you say\nwell let's build more freeways let's go\nand vote for this so they don't get\nstuck in traffic so then they know ah it\nmoves the traffic faster because we get\nstuck in traffic so this is why\ncommunicating communicating\ncommunicating selling selling selling\nthis what it's about oh those are great\nstories great examples yeah I love those\nI hope everyone who's listening and\nwatching can latch on and get some\ninsights for their own challenges those\nthose are great and I love that you're\ngoing all the way from Governor through\nto the gym and the run the story of you\nrunning around in your swims is\nbrilliant what's the uh there was one\nstory actually that aligns with that\nselling point that Will Smith tells of\nmeeting you and he said that he walked\ninto a room and it was you Sylvester\nStallone and John Claude vanam and you\nwere the three that inspired him to go\nInternational so he said that when he\nspoke to you three you all said to him\nthat the market in the USA is huge but\nuntil you become a global Superstar\nyou're not really a superstar right and\nso in the same way as you were saying\nyou were going around the 30 cities of\nthe US you've done a lot of world\ntouring as well for the movies well I\nexplained to him that when I got in the\nmovies and talking about Conan the\nBarbarian was my first big International\nMovie again the studio said we're going\nto send\nyou to Khan to the film festivals then\nwe're going to go and send you to\nLondon and maybe to Rome and definitely\nto Japan so I said well why are we only\ngoing to four places they said well this\nis where the big markets are Germany but\nthe Germans always come to England when\nwe do the Press chunk gets in England so\nthe Germans are taken care of then we\nhave the Japanese we go to\nJapan and uh you're going to do a big\npromotion there and then then America\nthose are the three big markets so I\nsaid okay if this are the three big\nmarkets I said when I look at the globe\ntoday I say I see so many other\npotential markets I say you don't want\nto build those yeah you don't want to\ncreate those so I told Will Smith and\nsaid the story I said I told them I said\nI'm going to go to France I'm going to\ngo to England to Germany to Holland to\nFinland to Sweden to Norway I want to go\nall over the place I want to go to the\nMiddle East I want to go to Africa I\nwant to go to Australia I want to go all\nover the place I said they said you're\nnuts I said so because I was thinking\nabout two things one is to promote the\nmovie and the other one is I have to\npromote myself because most people know\nme as a bodybuilder not as an actor so\nthis is a good opportunity for me to go\naround the world for the next month and\nto promote myself as well I now I'm\ndoing movies yeah and this is my first\nbig movie is you know is Conor the\nBarbarian so it was like a great\nso I told him that I said so I slowly\nstarted building an international market\nand the studios were extremely\npleased because every one of my\nmovies started to get bigger and bigger\nin the nationally so it used to be that\noneir was in the National box office and\n2/3 was\ndomestic then with me it started going\nto be 50/50 so 50% domestic 50%\nInternational and eventually it became\n1/3 domestic and 2/3 International so\nimagine how much more money that it\nadded because of that and so this was a\ntremendous power so I said to him I said\ndon't ever assume that everyone will\nknow about the movie they say you got to\ngo there you got to show your face the\npeople the journalists like to shake\nyour a hand they like to sit down on a\nround table with all of their mics\nsticking out the the 10 leading radio\nprograms of that country they sit all\nday on the table you're the the 11th\nperson that sits there and now you're\ntelling them stories about the movie M I\nsaid and they go back to the radio\nstation say I have an exclusive\ninterview with Will Smith and he a he's\ncoming out with this movie it is hot he\nlooks fantastic great actor nor I say\nhey how can it hurt but do it just\npromote yourself internationally and go\nfrom country to Country and he said\nthank you for this really great advice\nbecause if the studio would have said\nthat to me I would have just said but\nthey just want to use me yeah but you\nsaying it I buy in I believe it and he\nhas been thankful ever since because of\nthat yeah yeah it's great advice it's\ngreat advice but it's it's it's it's you\nknow you got to always let people know\nthat uh there's nothing sleazy about the\nmarketing and there so many actors\nalways feel like it's beneath them to go\nout and sell the movie and I tell them I\nsaid look no matter what you do if\nyou're a painter and you paint great\npaintings or if you're a\nmusician and you want to promote of\nalbum or if you're a movie actor and you\npromote your movie I said you have to do\nthat because it's the only way people\nwill know about it the more you do and\nthe better you do it and to actually say\nthe right things about the movie that is\nSnappy that really makes people curious\nwant to go see that's what it's all\nabout it's an art by itself not just the\nacting is an artart but the selling is\nan art as well yeah what I love about\nwhat you're saying it's you know for me\nas well I only moved to LA 5 years ago\nand I feel like I can be quite audacious\nand you know driven as well and so when\nI'm listening to you what I always find\nit's interesting because the most\nsuccessful people in the world they have\nthis audacity in that they already see\nit as reality and everyone else because\nit's so audacious people are trying to\ncatch up they can't really see it they\ncan't figure it out and you almost have\nto have that trust that you know where\nit can go and how big it can get having\nactually achieved all your goals\nbecoming the biggest bodybuilder of all\ntime going further becoming this huge\nmovie star you know you just said that\nyou had to go to educate people at one\npoint that you even were a movie star I\nthink you've been good at redefining\nyourself and re-educating people about\nwho you are from bodybuilding to movies\nto obviously governor of California how\ndoes it feel to have lived out so many\nof your visions that you saw so clearly\nas that young man in Austria how does\nthat actually feel well to be honest\nwith you I always say to people I would\nnever switch my life with anyone's life\nno matter who it is because I\nthink that I am the most\nprivileged person in the world I mean\nit's like to to be able to to live this\nmany types of lives to live the life of\nan athlete of an amater of a\nprofessional to really get the inside\nscoop because when you get the inside\nscoop of one profession of one uh sport\nyou pretty much because you hang out\nwith the b top football players with Joe\nnameth all those guys in the 70s I mean\nand with George Foreman and Muhammad Ali\nso you get to know really the inside of\nall sports basically and uh I think to\nlearn everything about sports to then\nlearn everything about entertainment to\nbe now with the greatest of the greatest\nI mean\nimagine that I still met people like\nFrank\nSinatra and uh Bob\nHope uh Sammy Davis Jr Dean Martin and\nall of those guys the guy that trained\nme in comedy was Bill Milton Burl and\nyou know all this old time guys Jimmy\nStewart I mean the list goes on Lucio\nball the list goes on and on and on to\nmeet off this people to work with them\nto do photo shoots with them to go to\nparties with them to be at dinner with\nthem at charity event events with them I\nmean it's really staggering to have this\nkind of experience and then they travel\naround the world and to meet all his\npolitical leaders from guv and the the\nyou know every president in the United\nStates from Ronald Reagan to Jimmy\nCarter to George Bush and everybody the\nlist go on and on on Clinton and all\nthose guys uh all the with Nixon I mean\neveryone I met and talked to and hung\nout with and learn from\nMandela um so this is like I mean who\nhas the privilege to do that and to\ntravel around the Middle East and to do\nthe things that people say he can't do\nlike to go from an Arab country to\nIsrael or from Israel to I hop back and\nforth all over the place from Iraq to\nJordan to Israel uh to Kuwait I mean\neverywhere and uh you know visiting the\nAmerican soldiers over there and uh to\nbe there I mean it's it's staggering\nthis kind of life and then to go into\nthe political Arena and then to figure\nout what makes really a city or a state\nor a country run and tick and what kind\nof players do you need and how do you\nnegotiate uh with all of those people\nand how do you bring Democrats and\nRepublicans together and how do you come\nup with your own vision of how things\nshould work because very quickly you\nknow I was a hardcore Republican but\nvery quickly I\nrealized that that's not where the\naction is the action is not with one\nparty that America is democ RS and\nRepublicans decline to State\nIndependence together and so that's the\nteam and as a team together we can do\ngreat things but if you start splitting\nthe team you start falling apart it's\nlike any football team or basketball\nteam say myself the action is Arnold\nbringing them together don't insult the\nDemocrats don't insult anybody bring\nthem together and let's be a public\nservant rather than a party servant M\nand so that was my new themee I was so\nproud of myself maybe 5,000 other\npoliticians have talked about this but I\nmean Obama said there's a blue State no\nred State there's only the United States\nbut there's a bogus lines really I mean\nit sounds good but I mean the reality is\ndifferent so you really have to show\nleadership quality and you really have\nto kind of make an effort to bring both\nof them together and to be not afraid to\nsay to the Democrats as a Republican\nI need your\nhelp but together we can solve this\nproblem I cannot do a lone Healthcare\nreform as a republican I need the\nDemocrats I need everybody you know so\nthis is the kind of things or building\ninfrastructure doing anything in this\nstate it was the our best work we did\ntogether so I cannot give any party a\ncredit I have to give the credit to the\npoliticians and to the people and the\npeople really enjoyed that when\nDemocrats and Republicans got together\nand campaigned together for propositions\nto vote for the certain propositions and\nall of St so I think so I was very very\nprivileged to be able to do all of those\nthings and to have millions of people\nlisten to you and vote for you and that\nof course goes to another chapter and\nanother subject in a book which is you\nknow give something back to the\ncommunity you know because we are not\nselfmade people and I talk about this at\nGreat length in the book as it you know\npeople so many times call me a self-made\nman I know what you're talking about but\nI always want to make clear at the same\ntime I'm not a self-made man I was\ncreated by my mother and my father I was\ncreated by my teachers by my coaches by\nmy bodybuilding Champions that they were\nmy my idols and Joe weer that brought me\nto America Eric Morris who was my acting\ncoach Chuck Nicholson that recommended\nthis act coach so all of those people\nhad the tremendous amount my wife did\nhelp me in every step of the way you\nknow with the kids my kids were really\nhelpful in my career so I am a product\nof all of that and so I think it's\nimportant that when we recognize that we\nhave gotten the help they we therefore\ngive help back so that's why you have to\nask yourself the question okay now if\neveryone helped me to be where I am how\ncan iina go out and help whom who can I\nhelp what can I help help them with and\nU I talk about it in a book that my\nfather-in-law Sergeant sha had this\ngreat line at the University speech at\nthe Yale where he said don't look always\nin a mirror don't look at yourself you\nknow destroy that mirror you will be\nable to look beyond that mirror and then\nyou will see the millions of people that\nneed your help and so this is what it's\nall about is to not just look at\nyourself or be self-consumed yes you can\nbe but don't forget ever that there's a\nlot of people out there that need your\nhelp and even though when people say\nwell what can I do I'm a nobody I don't\nhave any money that's bogus it's an\nexcuse right off the top that I don't\nwant to do anything because when you\nsee um Hawai burning down to the ground\nthere's a lot of things that everyone\ncan do but just taking some food and\nbringing it to those poor folks bringing\nsome clothing going out and going to\nsome fundraising and bring a few dollars\nto them whatever it is you can do\nsomething or to go into some inner city\nschool and to help with an after school\nprogram and to help kids learn how to\nread especially since you know in\nAmerica now we have so many students\nthat the where English is a second\nlanguage you know to help them to learn\nEnglish and all the stuff so there's\nendless amount of things I just always\nfelt that I have to be all out I\nremember when Rudy Giuliani called me\nwhen he was mayor of New York he said oh\nmy God you know that buildings came down\nwe creating a twin tower fund can you\nsend a million dollars I say yeah you\ngot it tomorrow in two seconds I didn't\neven think about it you know so that's\nwhat you do when when we need needed\nmasks uh when Co broke out and in Los\nAngeles the hospitals didn't have any\nmasks so I immediately put in a million\ndollars toward a fund that we put\ntogether uh to to to raise $8 million\nand then to get masks uh from all over\nthe world and especially from Asian\ncountries and so we can supply them with\nmasks and gowns uh and with gloves and\nwith ventilators and stuff like that\nthere was a company called\nflexport that was was within days got us\nthe masks even though the government\nsaid there are no masks around we can't\nget any mask so you know this are things\nlike that or doesn't matter if it's a\nearthquake or if this that you go out\nand you reach out and that's why I'm\ninvolved in after school programs that's\nwhy I was involved in Special Olympics\nand being a train and a coach for\nspecial Olympians to help them with the\nwinning medals and uh becoming Champions\nand all the stuff so that's what life is\nall about to to receive and to give well\nsaid Arnold well said and uh yeah\ndefinitely more notes in the book for\nanyone who wants to dive into some of\nthose stories but Arnold we end every\nepisode with a final five so these are a\nFast Five where you have to answer each\nquestion in one word or one sentence\nmaximum so these are your final five the\nfirst question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever heard or received\nbelieve in yourself second question what\nis the worst advice you've ever heard or\nreceived it can't be done good answers\nquestion number three you've mastered so\nmany things in your life what are you\ncurrently trying to master bring all of\nmy talents together into one the show\nbusiness fitness and politics all into\none and make that be my new kind of a\nvision and drive to help the world wow\nwhat okay I'm going to scrap the final\nwhat does that look like that's\nfascinating what does that look like\nright now in your mind as you develop\nyou can use more than one sentence I\nwant to be out there and help with\nenvironmental issues because I learned\nabout that during my governorship I want\nto be out there and help with Health\nCare issues with uh aging issues with\nFitness issues uh with entertaining\nissues and because it's important to\nentertain people so all of those kind of\nthings so I have the Schwarzenegger\nInstitute uh where we deal with a lot of\nthose various different issues and\npolicies to make it a better way world\nand I have my environmental conference\nin Vienna every year where the world\ncomes together 80 90 countries come\ntogether and we talk about the\nenvironment and how to make this a\nfossil fuel free world and reduce\npollution so we don't have 7 million\npeople die every year because of\npollution beautiful I can't can't wait\nto see the impact you have in that space\nuh question number four has two parts to\nit what is your biggest personal success\nand what is your biggest personal\nfailure well I think that my biggest\npersonal success is uh to be able to do\nthe things that they wanted to do that\nthey visualize them and turn them into\nreality and I think my biggest failure\nobviously is my marriage uh thing that\nfrom a personal point of view and from a\nprofessional point of view I've had many\nmovies go into the toilet I have lost\nbodybuilding competitions and\npowerlifting competitions and all that\nstuff so I had made plenty of failures\nIt's always important to bring that up\nbecause people should know that you\nnever will be able to go through life\nwithout failures failures make us learn\nfailures make you stronger pain makes\nyou stronger so I think all of that is\ngood yeah let's let's address both of\nthose because it's so true like on the\noutside like you said people can say so\nprivileged you met the presidents you\ndid this you did that you've you know\nall the winds you know when I'm looking\naround this room like everything's\niconic you know n nothing's\nunrecognizable across the whole world\nit's all\nrecognizable but there did you ever feel\nthe pressure when things started to go\nwell of like God the next movie's got to\nbe bigger and the next movie's got to be\nbigger did you feel that or did you just\nkind of you were just loving it so much\nthat you just kept building and if it\nwent wrong that it didn't hurt you that\nmuch um you know I never really\nfelt uh that much\npressure probably about anything to be\nhonest with you because I knew what I\nwanted\nand U I never really fell for this thing\nof what the people expect me to do so I\njust I create my vision and when\neveryone says it's impossible I go after\nit with vengeance it's like I go all out\n100% and it gives me joy and it is what\nis great about it is that every time\nthat you accomplish something really\nbig you see and become aware of other\nthings that are new challenges that you\ndidn't even think about yes I mean did I\never think about that I will fight for\nthe environment no but because of the\ngovernorship you know this it's like the\nthing I talk about in the book about\nHillary it climbs Mount Everest and he's\nup there and all a sudden he sees\nanother pig to be climbed right and he\nsaid that's the next one so there's the\nsame thing I go and win the governorship\nI go in there I start working on the\ngovernor and all the different policies\nand I'm meeting all these scientists and\nexperts and talk they talk about you\nknow how many people diarrhea because of\npollution and we can do something about\nit and that dive into that it's a new\nPeak oh my God no one has really\nexplored that forget the 19% of\nRenewables we have to have 50%\nRenewables forget about you know\nreducing greenhouse gases by 5% we have\nto reduce it by 25% and we have to do it\nby 2020 and so you set big goals so this\nis the new peig that you're climbing and\nyou go all out for that then when you\nget there then you see another peig\nbeyond that so this is what is um fun\nyeah and is makes my life Rich yeah you\nknow that is always something new and\ndifferent and I I I I I tell you that um\nI also learn when I for instance listen\nto you because you come from a totally\ndifferent world right so this you have a\ndifferent spin on things so when I\nlisten to this say\noh that's an interesting way of looking\nat it and so I think we have to learn\nfrom one another and so I think that you\nand I we have a lot in common anyway\nbecause otherwise you wouldn't be\nsitting here yeah right I mean to think\nabout it it's not just that I want to be\nhaving one of the most popular\npodcasts but you have to be a curious\nson of a to go and to be really\ngood in what you do yeah and this is\nwhat I noticed about your podcast you're\nreally curious a Natural Curiosity thank\nyou and I think that is B you have to\nhave it you have to have curiosity it\nshows in your eyes it shows in\neverything when you ask the question all\nyou know it's like when you see\njournalists which I hate you know they\nhave like a piece of paper and they say\nokay very interesting say now let me ask\nyou another question\num you want themet this is and then how\ndo you feel that they they read it of\nthe paper\nmhm and then when you answer they don't\neven look at you in the eyes they look\nat the paper for the next question right\nso I DET didn't detect any of that from\nyou I mean every question came without\nlooking at anything because you're\ncurious and I think I just wanted to\nmention that thank you thank you AR I\nappreciate that and it means a lot\ncoming from you and I am curious because\nI grew up as a fan who didn't so that's\none thing yeah but I think I'm even more\ncurious because you chose to write a\nbook about being useful and life lessons\nand I think that that world is what I\ngravitate towards because I think\nlearning from the greats is all we have\nand I think when we ignore to learn from\nthe greats that's when we make we have\nto make our own mistakes for no reason\nwe can avoid so many so no I am very\ncurious about you and I think you're\nalso a fantastic Storyteller so that\nhelps you get into so much detail and so\nmany examples and everything so it's\nit's brilliant thank you I tell you it\nwas really fun doing this book because I\nreally had to kind of drill down and\nthink about a lot of the things that\ncomes natural for me you know to tell\nstories about because you each one of\nthe rules you want to be able even the\nsub rules and the Sub sub rules you want\nto be able to tie it to a story so that\npeople can relate to like I was talking\nabout infrastructure you can talk to\npeople about infrastructure all you want\nthey can't relate to it but soon as you\ntired to getting stuck in traffic making\nit to the recital in a school and you\ncome late an hour because of the traffic\nand all then they can relate to that and\nthe same is with with any of the rules\nyou know I kind of uh had fun doing it\nit was sometimes frustrating because you\nwant to do you know 10 rules the\npublisher then says no you can only do\nseven because this book can should only\nhave\n268 Pages rather than 350 pages and all\nof this crazy stuff you go through but\nit was a really really great process and\nnever my wildest dreams did I ever think\nthat I will occupy this space at all and\nit really happened just totally\ncoincidentally where more and more\npeople you know when you when you\nfinished with the governorship I was\nasked to do public speaking engagements\nlike ex presidents and stuff like that\nand so I'm traveling around I think one\ntime someone said can you pump up our\ncrowd we have like a thousand you know\nreal estate people uh we want you to to\njust pump them up so you do a little bit\nof success story yeah and always SED to\ngol like wildfire every one of the\npublic speaking engagements they've had\nsince then they want to go and have me\ntalk about success the rules to success\nand all of that stuff so it's like\nsomething I didn't even think about\nbecause I always was a motivator you\nknow if it is Special Olympics of after\nschool programs or we just my buddies\naround in the gym that became my\ntraining partners because I always have\nthis kind of energy right come on let's\ndo a set you can do another set well\nwait a minute you're stopping with 10\nreps give me five more reps let it pain\nlet it give pain you know all and you\njust pump pump pump so I have this\nenergy so never thought that this would\nbe used then for seminars and eventually\nfor a book like this it's like it's like\ncrazy no it's F life takes you yeah it's\nfantastic it's it's beautiful to see it\nthrough your eyes and through your lens\nand for us all to dream as well and I\nhave one final question for you and\nactually before I ask it when you said\nwe have a lot in common there there's so\nmany different parallels that I'll tell\nyou later because when I was listening\nto you I have a very different life but\nso many similar lessons I've picked up\nalong the way and I think as humans\nthat's what brings us together we may\nnot have the same life story we don't\ngrow up in the same places we don't have\nthe same parents but you pick up the\nsame messages from the world and the\nsame lessons from the world right so the\nfifth and final question I want to ask\nyou is if you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be oh that's an interesting\nquestion\nmaybe to get off fossil\nfuels that we have to use Alternative\nEnergy if it is\nnuclear with producing energy itself if\nit is for cars electric or hydrogen I\njust feel\nlike if we\nhave 7 million people die because of\npollution I think by having a law like\nthat and eventually make it stick I\nthink that we could save those lives mhm\nand this is like unlik more than any of\nthe wars that have fought and any of the\nother disasters or anything like this is\nlike so many people die because of ution\nso I mean that's that's huge one thing\nyeah so I mean you know then probably\ntomorrow morning I call you and say I\nhave another law great that's a great\nanswer we've never had that one though\nwe've never had that answer so it's a\nbrilliant answer but you've been doing\nso much work in I feel like you've been\ndoing so much work in the plant-based\nspace you know with the documentaries on\nGame Changers like climate change now\nyou're talking about like it seems like\nthis has been like an immersion for you\nwell you know we know it's a crazy\nhere's another crazy one yeah go it's\nall my life is so insane I believe it\nbut I mean it's like I'm working with\nthis guy Jim Cameron I do Terminator one\nmhm we become\nfriends we ride the motorcycle together\ntogether we hang out together and then\nhe does you know Terminator 2 and he\ndoes other movies in the Titanic and\nAvatar and all yeah\nbut he\nis an\nenvironmentalist but when we\ndeterminated I never knew that and he\nnever talked about it so then I I become\ngovernor and now he goes and he says to\nme he says art I want you to make to\nmake you aware of that the power\ncompanies are still resisting the\nreverse metering say reverse metering\nwhat the hell are you talking about he\nsays what it's the thing you know when\nyou produce energy from solar and you\nproduce too much you want to put it back\non a grid mhm that's reverse metering\nand you get credit for it w so I walk\naway and I say how does Jim Cameron\nknows know about reverse metering and\nabout that subject you know of course\nit's very clear because he's a a genius\nright and he just is with technology and\nstuff like that is unbeatable yeah so\nbut sure enough I go into the\noffice the next day in the governor's\noffice and said look guys I want to talk\na little bit about reverse metering oh\nI'm so glad you bring this up because\n power companies are fighting us\ntooth and nail they don't want to do\nreverse meering but we want to pass a\nlaw so we telling the legislators to\nsend us a bill so that you can sign it\nand blah blah blah so this just gives\nyou an example of what impact Jim\nCameron had on me with issues that has\nWay Way Beyond you know movies and stuff\nlike that then he goes and says to me I\nsaid to him I said my doctor said to me\nhe says I should get off meat and they\nshould only have once a week meet and he\nsays well hello where have you been I\nmean I've been vegan for 5\nyears so I said what and he say I've\nbeen for five I haven't e any meat for 5\nyears you don't need meat to have and he\ngoes crazy now right and he say so we\ndoing a document right now on thing you\nknow on on eating plant-based food so\nall of a sudden he's the expert now I\nsit down with him and he's telling me\nfor hours about you know plant-based\nfood and how he can combine and create\nthe right amino acids to create the\nright protein and over how he can get\nstrong and here is and now he lives s\nthe name of the athletes boxers\nwrestlers weightlifters UFC fighters\neverything that are on plant-based food\nthink about that so now I got into it\nand I was part of this documentary right\nand now I eat like maybe once a week\nmeat so I would say\n70% at least to cut down my meat intake\nfor health reasons and it happens to\nalso for environmental reasons as he\nexplained as Arnold what do you think\nwhere most of the pollution comes from\nmore than from Transportation comes from\nbreeding life stock says are you kidding\nme he says no read up on it he says I\nsend you some stuff so I'm reading up on\nit sure enough 28% of the pollution\ncomes from breeding livestock so say if\npeople would need meat he is wouldn't\nhave the animals being kind of like uh\nthe wholesale kind of like the the the\nthe the vegetable protein goes into the\nanimal then they eat it in their chest\nthen you eat the animal you still get\nthe the the you know the plant-based\nfood but through the animal now is is\nit's it's we can do better than\nthat let's cut out the meat it's just\namazing how I get exposed to various\ndifferent things in my life and make me\npassionate\nabout ways that I couldn't even ever\nhave planned you know this kind of\nrelationship and this kind of knowledge\nyou could never plan on yeah and do you\nalso have a meditation practice is that\nright I I used to in the 70s there was a\ntime when I got out of\nbodybuilding and into Show Business and\nthere was all kinds of things happening\nin the mid-70s so I was doing my last\nyear of\ncompetition uh in 1975 in South Africa\nMr Olympia so I was training for that I\nwas finishing off my movie stay hungry\nwith barar Ron and Sally Fields and Jeff\nBridges you know doing that and I was at\nthe same time going full plast into show\nbusiness taking acting classes and\ninvesting my money in real estate so I\nwas no matter which way I was turning I\nwas like scrambling and at that point I\ndid not know much about how to isolate\nand just concentrate on one thing at the\ntime so I'm hanging out with this guy\nthis skinny rat down on the\nbeach he's\na a transcendental meditation teacher MH\nbut they never talked about it so I said\nhim I said I feel frantic I mean it's\nlike everything is so a little bit\noverwhelming for me I'm doing this movie\nI'm shooting the documentary pumping IR\nI'm going to the competition I'm\nfinishing off stay hungry I'm trying to\nto real estate and become a\nmillionaire I'm all over the place he\nsays let me talk to you a little bit M\nvery calmly talks to me about it and he\nsays why don't you come up to Westwood\nand take some Transcendental\nMeditation he says I cannot be your\nteacher even though I'm a teacher I said\nyou're a teacher trans yeah he said but\nI cannot be a teacher is our rules when\nyou friendship and stuff like if there's\nsomeone else say but don't worry I said\nyou be the right guy so I go up there\nand I do the I learn now about\nmeditation and as I got into it I was\nbeen doing meditation like for months\nwow throughout the summer that hectic\nsummer and when the summer was\nover he wasn't that hectic anymore so\nwhat I learned from meditation was you\nknow how to kind of like first will\nrejuvenate the mind and to kind of\ndisconnect the mind but also what I\nlearned was how to focus on one thing at\nthe time and to just look at that with\nno peripheral vision so that nothing\ncomes in solve\nthis and then don't think about anything\nelse and then go over here and solve\nthis and then solve this because you he\nsaid you can never do all it in one time\nanyway MH and as soon as you single out\nthings it becomes much\nmore approachable and much more doable\nmhm and he said to me I remember he said\nwhen you drive down\nand Venice boardwalk with your\nbike he says you will look sometimes on\nthis busy day and it will be all\npacked he says it would look like you\nwould not be able to go through this\ncrowd because you're looking at the\nwhole\nshot the whole portwalk all the way down\na mile Venice so it's overwhelming he\nsays but if you go now with your bike\nslowly you negotiate around the people\nand always a sudden you will find spaces\nwhere you can go where you don't bump\ninto anybody and always say and always\nsaid near on the end of it and it was\ntotally doable because he took like one\nperson at a time kind of like bicycling\naround he says and that's the way it is\nwith everything it says if you just look\nat it one thing at a time you'll be able\nto solve any\nproblem and that's why it says you see\npeople like the\nPope that has obviously\nhis daily routine the big daily routine\nbut this guys they get up at 5:00 in the\nmorning they work out for an hour and a\nhalf very calmly get dead out of the way\nthen they read newspapers like Po Pope\nchamp Paul I remember he told me he read\nnewspapers in six different languages so\nthey read the newspapers then they get\nthat done then they go and take a shower\nthen they go and have the first meeting\nso this is this is how they step by step\nthey approach the the the day and he\nsays the people that get done the most\nyou can load them up with even more\nresponsibilities because they're very\norganized and very systematic in their\napproach and so I've learned that so now\nI've never really been that franic again\nyeah but if I would become franic I\nwould go right back into the meditation\nbecause I know know how to do it that's\nfantastic hon know everyone who's been\nlistening or watching the book is called\nbe useful\nseven tools for Life uh you can grab it\nright now we're going to put the link in\nthe comments and the caption so that you\ncan order it right away as you can tell\nArnold's a phenomenal Storyteller inside\nof it a lessons stories and one of the\nthings I definitely have in common with\nArnold that I appreciate about him is\nhow simple the ideas how easy they are\nto digest they're not complicated and\nyou know you don't have to learn\nsomething new you can actually just sit\nthere take them in listen and all of a\nsudden you start going wait a minute it\nmaybe is that easy maybe it is that\nsimple and I think that's something that\nwe desperately need in today's world so\nArnold I thank you for putting all your\nlessons into a book for us I thank you\nfor telling so many Amazing Stories and\nI signed\n177,000 copies wow Pages P because now\nthey they sent you the pages you know so\nI'm getting these boxes with pages each\nbox was a thousand pages and I said to\nmyself wait a minute now you know first\nwas like 14,000 for the American company\nand then there was another 3 and a half\nth000 or 4,000 for the for the they\ngoing to be in book stores yes so what\nwhat they do is I think that the first\nof the books are all signed yes so now\npeople would when they order pre-order\nthey will wear signed books I think that\nwas the idea so in the old days that you\nwould go to the bookstore and you would\nsign all the books yourself and then you\nsit there for hours and hours and after\nan hour you sign 100 books right because\nyou have to open up the book and it's\nall slow now it's is pages so I was just\nlike signing signing signing I was for\nthree months I was signing and signing\nand signing yeah I mean think about it I\nmean\n177,000 yeah I can relate it's crazy\nyeah it's crazy I never thought they\nhave to do that many\nsignatures I love it well it's available\nnow make sure you tag me and Arnold on\nany social media platforms you're using\nwhether it's Tik Tok Instagram X or\nwherever you are I'd love to see what\nresonated with you what's stuck with you\nkeep sharing those posts across social\nmedia because I love seeing what is\ngoing to stay with you what you're going\nto practice what are you going to try\nwhat are you going to implement in your\nlife from this episode that will help\nyou become happier healthier or more\nhealed thank you again hanold thank you\nthank\nyou"
