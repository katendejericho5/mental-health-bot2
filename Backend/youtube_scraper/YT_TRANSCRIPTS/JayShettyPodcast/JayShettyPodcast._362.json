    "transcript": "behind the mask of these characters I\nactually started being able to express\nmore of my truth right like in my life\nwith my family at home I couldn't\nnecessarily be angry or Express fear or\ninsecurity but if I was playing a\ncharacter I could have all of those big\nintense feelings and it wasn't\nthreatening to anyone it was actually\nrewarded so my characters became like\nthis safe space for me to both hide\nbehind but also secretly reveal myself"
