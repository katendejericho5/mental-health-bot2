actually\nstarted being able to express more of my\ntruth my characters became this safe\nspace for me to both hide behind but\nalso secretly reveal myself\n[Music]\nbefore we jump into this episode I'd\nlike to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbest-selling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nwhat would you say is\na childhood memory that stands out to\nyou\nin that it defines a lot of who you are\ntoday oh wow what a great question I\nfeel like there are a lot of them in\nhere but one\nI have a lot of Pride about being the\nfirst girl in my neighborhood to play\nall sharks under which is that game we\nplayed at the pool in my neighborhood\nbecause I don't know I think I come from\na line of Really Brave women you know\nwhen I think about my grandmother being\nan immigrant and coming to this country\nfrom Jamaica and you know being a young\nwoman looking at that Statue of Liberty\nand what it must have meant for her to\ntake on that adventure and I think about\nmy mom and you know the career that she\nbuilt and you know the education that\nshe pursued and the risks that she took\neven you know in terms of what I talk\nabout in the book and and how she how I\ncame to be in the world\num\nand so I think you know being a little\ngirl who was like willing to be one of\nthe Sharks you know willing to play with\nthe guys willing to jump into the deep\nend and challenge myself and be one of\nthe big kids and not be limited by my\ngender or my age or by the fear of of\nwhat the game was or the depths of the\nwater I think that says a lot about kind\nof how I've lived my life that\nwillingness to swim in the deep end you\nknow wow yeah what do you think gave\nthe women who came before you that\ncourage that strength because I feel\nlike a lot of the conversation around\nthat has of course developed more\nrecently yeah sadly but you see these\nwomen who just always had this strength\nand resilience and power despite it not\nbeing given to them or opportunities not\nbeing shown to them what what do you\nthink\nbrought them through all of that it's\nfunny because I think in a lot of ways\nlike\nfor women of color and black women in\nparticular we haven't had the\nyou know dare I say privilege of being\nlike damsels in distress like no one was\nsaving us no one was rescuing us as\nblack women particularly you know with\nthe diaspora and the history of slavery\nwe've we've always been working women\nwe've always been resilient and strong\nout of necessity and I think there's\nsomething about that that lives deep in\nmy genetics deep in my family history\nit's I think we talk a lot about\ngenerational trauma and there's\ndefinitely some of that in my story and\nsome of it I talk about but\nbut there's also generational courage\nand strength and I think it's important\nfor me to embrace both to see both as\nbeing part of who I am yeah and it's\nalmost like in in a general sense one\ncan't live without the other that's\nright and and they kind of give birth to\neach other a little bit too right like\nthe trauma causes strength and the it's\nyou you become a Survivor and then you\napply that wisdom and I know that's true\nfor me that I you know there's things I\nknow that I am who I am because of the\nthings that I've had to walk through you\nknow I am as much who I am because of\nall the extra hugs and love and\nencouragement I got and because of the\nthe adversity you know it's all it's all\npart of it yeah it's so beautiful to\nhear it like that too to look at it as\nnon-binary yeah yeah yeah yeah I do I\nit's funny when I was coming here to\ntalk to you I was like oh this is so\ndifferent for me because\nI'm used to doing interviews to talk\nabout like a television show or a movie\nand I know like I know what that\nnarrative is and I I know what I'm\nselling right but this is like I'm not\nreally selling anything I'm I'm really\nsharing and I don't have like an agenda\nfor like a piece of content I'm I'm\nreally just like offering myself and\nso it's different it's it's a very\ndifferent\nprocess and experience for me because\nI'm not translating my experience into a\ncharacter's Journey like I'm I'm the I'm\nthe character\num so I bring that up to say I've been\nthinking a lot about the fact that\nthere's a lot of complexity and it's not\nbinary there's there's a lot of gray\narea there's not like there's no clear\nvillain and there are no clear Heroes\nand it's real life you know and so I\nthink I'm in talking about the book I'm\ngonna have to get really comfortable\ntalking about those kind of complexities\nbecause it's just not it's just not\nsimple nobody's life is simple yeah well\nI think you do a really wonderful job in\nthe book to\nelegantly and you know gently share it\nwith everyone the complexities of it and\nwhat I did is I have a few lines from\nthe book that really stood out to me and\nI'd love to discuss those okay yes yes\nof course let me get comfortable here\nI'm gonna take my shoes off yeah please\ntake your shoes\nwe're gonna read the book okay I always\nfind that the words that someone chooses\nand the vocabulary they have and the\nlanguage they use to define experiences\nand of course I want everyone to know\nthat we're only\nskimming the surface of what's in the\nbook or all the details in the book and\nI highly recommend you you turn to the\nbook for more of the context yeah but I\nthink this will give people a glimpse\ninto the kind of\nplaces you go to and you allow yourself\nto go to so one of the things that stood\nout to me in the book and I'm I'm\nreading here only to make sure I don't\nmisquote you so you talk about how you\nsuffered from panic attacks at age seven\nand in your words you say I would force\nmyself to try to have good thoughts\nand I was just thinking did you know\nwhat a panic attack was at seven were\nyou aware what did it feel like and why\ndid you\ntry to say good thoughts like why was\nthat the solution and what were those\nthoughts\nno I didn't know I didn't have the\nlanguage when I was seven that it was a\npanic attack it was later in life in my\nearly 20s when I started having panic\nattacks again that I recognized that\nthis was something that's been with me\nfor a long time on and off through the\nyears and I realized I had been having\nthem since I was that little kid and it\nfelt like\ndread pulsing through my body like I\nknow I described it as like this\nwhirling like a spinning like a rhythm I\ncouldn't control like a rising heat like\na clenching in my throat a fear\nthat felt like it was small enough to be\nin every little cell but big enough to\ndrown in you know and I just like as I\nsay that to you I have so much love for\nthat little girl lying in that bed\nwithout the language to describe it as\nI'm describing it to you but still\nhaving to hold space for the experience\nof it the good thoughts you know I think\nI sort of I think I describe it that way\nin that moment as good thoughts because\nI was seven and there was good and bad\nright there wasn't the Nuance of like\nthis is an opportunity or that you know\nit just was like like this feels bad\nright like this feels really bad and I\nwant to feel good and I didn't you know\nI didn't know Louise Hay at that time I\ndidn't I didn't know that I didn't know\nabout affirmations but I just would I\nknew the sound of music I knew the that\nyou could like think about your favorite\nthings and maybe feel all right and so I\njust tried to think about things that\nmade me happy be things that brought me\njoy or a sense of peace and I would try\nto kind of shut out the panic and make\nthe volume of the good things louder in\nmy head and at seven where were those\nnegative or bad thoughts coming from\nlike where was that Panic coming from\nwhat was the source of it yeah I think a\nlot of it was\num you know I talk about hearing my\nparents arguing in the other room\nbut in general there was this\num this sense of it's a big word and I\nI'm gonna say it and then contextualize\nit I think I felt unsafe I was safe in a\nlot of ways you know I was very loved we\nwere\nyou know I was provided for materially I\nwas wanted I was appreciated I was\nencouraged but I also knew as I talk\nabout in the Memoir that there were\nthings there was information that was\nbeing kept from me I didn't know it\nconsciously but unconsciously I felt\nlike like I wasn't being given the full\ntruth and that created in me this\num like a sense of distrust and of\nlonging for wholeness like something\nfelt incomplete and\nunhole it's not it's probably not the\nright way to say it but so I think the\nPanic was me trying to navigate the fear\nof like what don't I know I don't even\nknow what I don't know I just know I I\ndon't have everything I need to feel\nsafe\nI'm really glad you gave that context\nbecause I think that\ntoday when we hear the word unsafe we\nthink it means physically right and we\nthink it means materially yeah but it's\nso interesting that those things can be\ntaken care of and you still feel an\ninternal unease yeah yes a disease like\na um it was an emotion I wasn't\nemotionally safe I knew that that's\nthat's that's what I knew somewhere deep\ndown and I didn't have a way to confirm\nit I didn't even have a way to ask about\nit it just was this feeling and I didn't\neven know if I should trust the feeling\nright because everyone was saying it's\nall good everything's fine\num so I think that maybe a lot of the\nthe Panic was that I was from early on\nbeing asked to disconnect from my own\nsense of knowing\num you know I was being taught from the\nmoment I got to this planet from the\nmoment that I was born I was being\ntaught that I had to act as if the lie\nwas true the LIE of of who my family was\nand how we came to be so I didn't really\nI didn't know I didn't know what I\ndidn't know but I knew I didn't know\nsomething\num yeah and it's it's so interesting\nright I think that\nso many of us feel that way that our\nfeelings when we're younger were not\nvalidated or acknowledged and we weren't\ntrained to do that if anything like in\nyours we were taught to reject or\nabandon deny deny and then they don't\njust go away because of that they often\ncome back in the future and we'll get to\nthat but they come back in so many\ndifferent ways in our lives when you\nabandon your own truth yeah at the\nbeginning of your life and it's did you\ndid you ever feel that\nyou were able to reconnect what helped\nyou reconnect with that sense of knowing\nagain in the future internally yeah\nbecause I feel like that's something\nthat like you can remember having\nknowing and then you can remember how\nyou let it go most people I speak to\nfeel like they never felt like they knew\nand I don't think it's because they\nnever knew it's because they let it go\nof it so early that we forgot that we\nknew yeah if that makes sense it does it\ndoes I don't remember I don't remember\nknowing and then not knowing but I I\nremember learning\nthat it was more important to play along\nthan to fight for what I thought I knew\nand then it was like okay it's the\nscript that matters it's like the this\nperformance of this perfect family like\nthat's that's the priority and their\nfeelings are more important than mine\nwhoever the day is and then the day was\nlike lots of different people throughout\nmy life but I think one of the first\nthings one of the first tools that\nhelped to bring me back to myself was\nyoga it was like the first one of the\nfirst times that I remember being still\nin my body in shavasana at the end of\nthat first yoga class that I took in\nhigh school and weeping because I felt\nreally like present in my body like I\nwasn't trying to escape or deny or quiet\nor I was just like fully present in my\nbody and it was terrifying because I was\nlike I don't know if this is okay it was\ndifferent from how I was taught to be\nnot not like didactically taught but it\nwas different from How I Learned to be\nto survive emotionally how did that\nfeeling transpire in other areas of your\nlife that desire of like I'm gonna\nperform I'm gonna put up what people\nneed me to do like did you find that\nmanifesting in other areas of your life\nor were you able to kind of go no that\nwas just with my family and no I mean I\ngot really I got really lucky because I\nfound a career where I could perform\nwhere I could like this superpower that\nI had to kind of shape-shift and be\nwhoever you needed me to be I started\nknowing how to do that in an audition\nroom and on a set and on a stage and I\nrealized there there actually was this\nplace in life where performing was the\ntrue goal and it was okay to\nto want to be somebody other than myself\nand to want to step away from my truth\nto another person's truth like that\nactually led me to\na really exciting adventurous Abundant\nLife and then this weird thing happened\nwhere\nbehind the mask of these characters I\nactually started being able to express\nmore of my truth right like in my life\nwith my family at home I couldn't\nnecessarily be angry or Express fear or\ninsecurity but if I was playing a\ncharacter I could have all of those big\nintense feelings and it wasn't\nthreatening to anyone it was actually\nrewarded so my characters became like\nthis safe space for me to both hide\nbehind but also secretly reveal myself\nit's incredible how like something so\nstressful and uncomfortable turns into a\ntalent but also a healing yes right\ntruly I'm so grateful that\num that acting led me to be able to have\nmore emotional vocabulary more\nwillingness to actually feel my feelings\nand express them and I'm even grateful I\nmean it was how I stumbled upon acting\nis that you know my mother is a very\nstoic she's so elegant and like she's\nreally somebody who\nis not very expressive of her emotions\nbecause she's she operates from here and\nis very dignified and stoic and so you\nknow because God has an enormous sense\nof humor she had this child and I was\njust like a walking ID just like\nfeelings all over the place and God\nbless her because she's an educator\nrather than just say like\nstop having feelings she was like you're\ngonna go to this Children's Theater\nCompany because I I imagine you know she\nwas thinking I don't know what to do\nwith all these feelings you know as well\nas I know my mother she was kind of like\nI don't know what to do with you but\nthey'll know what to do with you and so\nshe the amazing educator that she is she\nled me to spaces where I could be\nexpressive and energetic and emotional\nand she could applaud from over here and\nnot have to Wrangle yeah absolutely yeah\nand it's what I find so interesting when\nI was reading the book too is just\nrecently I saw that you mentioned how\nyou have always been trying to get away\nfrom acting there yes and and these\namazing opportunities keep coming your\nway explain that to us because I think\nwhat I what I love about this is kind of\nwhat we were talking about since the\nbeginning of this interview which is\nthis texture and this complexity which\nwhat appears to be a paradox yeah but\nactually that's the Human Experience\nwhere you're like I had this pain acting\nwas healing me but now acting something\nI've been trying to move away from\nbut it's okay that that so woke up walk\nme through the the depths of that or the\ntexture behind that of like why why is\nit something that despite it being so\nhealing and Powerful in a safe space to\nfeel all of this does it not feel like a\nforever home sometimes I'm super\ninterested to hear what you think about\nthis because some of this is the tension\nbetween\nthe pure art and craft of the work the\ncreative craft of acting and\nstorytelling and narrative and\num I love that work I always love that\nwork even when it's really really hard I\nfeel like what a privilege what a gift\nit feels like a true calling I don't\nalways love the business stuff you know\nI don't always love the rejection and\nthe\num competition and the how hard it is to\nget something off the ground I get\nsomething produced and get something\ngreen lit or like I don't always love I\nlove the making of it I don't always\nlove the vulnerability of when it hits\nthe airwaves and like the criticism and\nthe ratings and the reviews and um and\nso that it's like the\nwhen I when I want to leave is when it\nfeels like the business parts of it\nthough the kind of worldly material\nparts of it become\ntoo expensive to my soul it just feels\nlike I don't I don't want to have to\nnavigate all that stuff so I'm gonna go\nfind something else it's like that great\nyou know the the Winston Churchill brene\nBrown quote about like being in the ring\nand you know what it is to be in the\nring that's that beautiful vulnerability\nand sometimes I'm like I don't want to\nbe in the ring like you know what God\nlike you can have the ring like I'm good\nI think I want to be an observer and\nlike you know be booing from the crowd\nfor once like not really I'm not a very\ngenerous viewer usually but but\nsometimes it's that it's like sometimes\nthe vulnerability on the business side\nfeels like too much not the\nvulnerability on stage not the\nvulnerability in front of the camera but\nthe\nthe stuff outside of the creative craft\nso that's when when that stuff feels\nlike Ugh it's taking over and I'm\nspending more time thinking about how to\nwin than I am about how to create then I\nfeel like I'm gonna go do something else\nsomething that feels pure like teaching\nkids or teaching yoga or you know\nsomething all the other things I've\ntried to do and then and then inevitably\nyou know I'll read and write when like I\nremember I had I mean I really did not\nhave money to burn it was early in my\ncareer and I was like I'm done I'm done\nI'm done I'm done and I signed up for a\nyoga teacher training I got certified to\nteach yoga when I was living in India\nbut this I didn't have a certification\nin the states and so I signed up for\nthis very fancy Jiva mukti yoga in New\nYork yeah\nand so I was going to do their teacher\ntraining I just made my last payment and\nthen I read the script for Rey and I was\nlike holy like I have to do this movie\nso that's what that's what happens\nalways is like I get to the edge of like\nuh and then something beautiful calls me\nin something that feels like it's worth\nthe work of the material\num\nstuff the BS the or just like the\nadulting like all the you know all that\nstuff it's worth that to be able to go\nback to that play and that creativity\nand that that stuff where I feel like my\nsoul gets to be of service in a\nnarrative\nI think you're speaking the language of\nevery true artist and Creator who feels\nthat in a way that they may not even\nhave\ntried to push as far as you have like\nyou're someone who's achieved the peak\nof your creative Endeavors right you've\nmade incredible box office films like TV\nlike you've You've Won in that sense in\nyour art yeah sort of and and I I mean\nin the in the external material like in\nthe sense of like you're someone who's\nbut you see what I mean like when I say\nsort of it's because like there are\nAwards I haven't won yes there are\nAwards I haven't been nominated for\nthere are like certain people who've\nmade more money at the box office the\nwhole different records it's like and\nthat's a little bit of the part of what\nI do that I don't love I remember an\nacting teacher saying to me once\nno matter what he does Tom Cruise is\nnever going to be Tom Hanks he's never\ngoing to have like three years in a row\nback-to-back Oscar nominations he's\nnever gonna have that like he could have\nborn on the fourth of July but he's not\ngonna be he's not gonna have Tom hanks's\ncareer and guess what no matter what Tom\nHanks does he's never gonna have Tom\nCruise's career he's never gonna have\nback-to-back Mission Impossibles and\nlike hold all the Box off records and 30\nyears later be able to make another Top\nGun and have it be the nominated for a\nbest picture like they have different\ncareers but neither is less valid like\nthey're both winning they've both won\nand that's part of the challenge for me\nis like how to accept that this journey\nmy journey is the journey it doesn't\nhave to look like anybody else's it\ndoesn't have to measure up according to\nanybody else's standard and I think for\na long time because I wasn't comfortable\nwith myself because I didn't really know\nmy story and so I wasn't really living\nmy story I always felt like I was the\nco-star and somebody else's story\nwhether it's at work or at home or\nwhatever that writing this Memoir was a\nlittle bit about like I got that missing\npuzzle piece that helped me put myself\nat the center of my story and then I was\nlike I want to do the work to write that\nI want to do the work to know what it\nfeels like to Center myself so that I\ncan make sure that in this lifetime I'm\nliving my story and not chasing somebody\nelse's\nwow USB to everyone's Soul right now\neverything you're saying I'm like\nit's and it shows right I think when\nwhen we feel like we can really\nunderstand someone we don't know or\nsomeone we haven't spent a lot of time\nwith it means that they understand\nthemselves\nyou know when you're at that like\nHumanity that like naked truth of just\nwhat it means to be human exactly like\nI'm listening to you going wow I think\neverything you just said like I think\nevery creative person I know has\nexpressed some part of that to me I\nthink there's parts of me that have\ngrappled with that and if you if you\ndon't mind I'd love to offer you what\nyou asked for earlier and you were\nsaying you have to hear my thoughts yes\nboth as a coach but also as somebody who\num because I feel like I'm here I should\nget free coaching but also somebody\num who is navigating the combination of\nthe material world and the spiritual\nworld and and you know living in both of\nthose spaces yeah so from a from a\ncoaching or even spiritual perspective\ntoo because all my coaching is is of\nthat type so the Sanskrit word for this\nis Dharma and Dharma very Loosely can be\nput to purpose but really what Dharma is\nis almost like an inherent calling that\nyou can't separate from yourself it is\nso in deep alignment and centered with\nwho you are at the core that even if you\ntry and push it away it just keeps\npulling you back no matter no matter\nwhat that is and that isn't an activity\nlike it isn't a title like I think today\nwe think of like purpose or passion as a\njob or uh like CEO is not a Dharma\nexactly exactly CEO or actor or actress\nor podcaster or author is that's not\nyour Dharma it's like you're an artist\nwho expresses yourself through many\ndifferent ways you've written an amazing\nMemoir you've done TV you produce you\ntell stories you know you have a you\nhave two interview shows podcasts and\nscripted like those are just mediums and\nbut what I'm getting to is that there's\na part of you\nwhere performance and the expression of\nemotion through performance is so core\nto what helps you heal and live and\nbreathe in whatever way it is it doesn't\nalways have to be in a TV or a film\nthere's some part of you that loves to\nexpress and loves to feel in that way\nand you can probably Define it better\nthan me and what I've found is that\nwe're always trying to escape that\nbecause\nusually in the same way as you're saying\nbecause of the business aspects that\nmake it seem\ndirtier murkier less pure because it\ncomes from such a pure place right it's\nnot coming from the place of wanting to\nwin right it's not coming from the place\nof wanting to be the best it's coming\nfrom the place of like service service\nso this just needs to get out and that's\nsomething that I've found that\nit's really hard to shake that because\nit's almost like God the universe wants\nyou to use that in the service of others\nand so I've I've rarely found so I've\nnot found anyone I think that's been\nable to\nextract their Dharma from themselves\nbecause it is inextractable like it's\nit's you it's you and it's your\nspiritual identity yeah it's like it's\nit's your it's almost like what would be\nconsidered your spiritual offering in\nthe material world it's what connects\nyou to that spiritual world in the\nmaterial world because without it and\nagain by the way this is not a I'm just\ncalling it out this is specific to Kerry\nand this is different for everyone if\nyou did give that up and you went off\nand tried all the other things which\nyou've obviously tried so you already\nknow this I don't even tell you you can\ntry and it's not that that isn't\nfulfilling it's just that there's this\nthing that just keeps pulling you back\nthe boyfriend you can't quit\nit's just a spiritual boyfriend you\ncan't quit that's my Dharma I love it\nyeah I think for me it might be some\nsort of\num\nthere's something about the expression\nof emotional truth it feels like my\nDharma is connected to holding space\nfor\nemotional vulnerability or emotional\ntruth\nand I think in some ways that's why I\ngrew up in a family where truth was kept\nfrom me because it's like I developed\nlike a heat-seeking missile for like I'm\ngonna find the truth I'm gonna know what\nit looks like if I can't express it here\nI have to express it here it was like it\nwas kept from me so that I would learn\nto cultivate it and honor it and hold\nspace for it and I like I think about\neven when I'm working as a director\noften my note to an actor in a scene is\nlike I just I don't believe you yet\nright like I I want to believe you more\nand I think there's something about like\nI survived\num a childhood where I learned what\ntruth doesn't look like and so I'm\nreally aware of what it does look like\nnow and I it's it's so important to me\nyeah that's no that's so powerful and\nit's uh\nit's almost like that that's the\nacceptance that you know even I've had\nto make like I think for me it was\non a very deep level\nthe business or the systematic approach\nto Art which you have to take if you\nwant your work to scale or you want your\nwork like you're saying the discipline\nthe discipline of it or the business the\nbusiness of it as you're saying the\nparts that we don't enjoy like right the\nis actually what at least from a very\nEastern spiritual perspective would be\nlike that's the stuff that purifies you\nof the ego that comes from art\nah yes of course of course it's I mean\nit's funny because then when you say it\nit's like yes this is what you learn in\nthe ashram right this is what you learn\nin a yoga practice that like you don't\nget to have the Transcendent moment at\nthe end of practice today and meditation\nuntil you do the 20 sun salutations like\nthey get you there they open you up they\nthey get you closer it's that it is the\ndiscipline that makes room for the the\ngoodness if we just like woke up out of\nbed and were immediately Transcendent\nwithout any discipline we probably I\nwould probably be a pretty horrible\nperson to be around I'd be like I'm\namazing\neverything comes so easily for me yeah\nor the opposite where we end up in\ncomplete like dullness and ruin where\nwe're like it doesn't work and I can't\ndo anything and I and and it's it's\neither or and I find that when you have\nto reflect on the competitive aspect and\npurify that desire to be competitive it\ngets you closer to your truth yeah when\nyou have to sit in it and go I don't\ncare if I'm not Tom Cruise I'm happy\nbeing Tom Hanks I don't care if I'm not\nTom Hanks I'm happy being Tom Cruise\nthat is the purification of getting you\ncloser to your truth whereas if you\nnever had to do that activity you almost\ncould live in ignorance and ignorance is\nbliss well if that makes sense again I'm\nnot saying I agree with how it's all\ndone or run I'm saying that's how I\nthink you're trying to operate as a as a\nwarrior in uh on a war field as as you\nknow like you're you're relishing the\nBattle of it because you notice that the\nbattle is actually forced you to go more\ninward right because if you lived it\noutwardly it's just too much yeah if\nthat makes any sense it does it does\nanyway but so we we got lost on that\nyeah but no I I really appreciate where\nwe're going with this conversation\nbecause I do think that that I think all\nof us are caught within that battle for\nthe truth in our own lives and our own\ntruth in different ways yeah this this\nwas interesting to me because I'm also\npicking out things that I think\na lot of our community and audience can\nlearn so there's one thing that said\nbeing busy is one of the ways I create a\nsense of safety and control during times\nwhen I feel there is none when I read\nthat I was like Wow right the amount of\npeople that I know to every workaholic\nout there eventually and and it's it's\nhard to even become aware of that\nbecause there's joy in that and that's\nright how have you allowed yourself to\nbecome less busy have you allowed\nyourself to become less busy or or what\ndoes that awareness led to yeah I I do I\nfeel like it was this was a the period\nthat I wrote this book you know what\nhappened was about five years ago my\nparents gave me some new information\nyeah about kind of about me and and our\nfamily and and how I came to be\num and it that new information kind of\nturned my world upside down and it came\nat a really interesting time in my life\nbecause I was just ending seven seasons\non this like crazy successful hit show\noh playing an iconic character and I was\nin many ways asking like who am I now\nbut I did have this fantasy that when\nthat show ended I would suddenly have a\nlot of free time because that show I was\nfilming 16 hours a day you know I don't\nknow nine ten months out of the year and\nI was you know within the life of that\nshow I got married and had two children\nand now I have three children my husband\ncame with one and it was just like there\nwas no down time and I thought when the\nshow ends I'll have some down time and I\nremember like a year after the show\nending I was like oh I might be the\nproblem like I don't think the show is\nthe problem because I still have no down\ntime and I am not the number one on the\ncall sheet of a hit Prime Time drama but\nI was Finding other ways to fill my time\nand still finding moments where I was\nfeeling overwhelmed and overworked and\num so I really started to think about\nhow I if I was the problem if I was the\ncommon denominator denominator if I was\nthe issue then how could I also maybe be\nthe solution and I think the truth is I\ndo I do love to be busy but I I'm trying\nto check the intention of what that\nbusyness is about so making sure that\nI'm not saying yes to things because I\njust want to be in a constant state of\ncortisol\nspikes and you know not getting enough\nsleep and just feeling like I'm on a\nhamster wheel because then I don't have\nto deal with some other stuff I'm trying\nto have the yeses come from purpose and\npassion and to have more no's to say no\nmore often so that there's room to say\nyes for things that make me feel not\nbusy but driven and generous and like\nI'm contributing you know not just\naccomplishing but really contributing\ngiving of myself and I think that that\nfeels like a\na tough tough thing to do when you've\nbeen such a high performing person for a\nlong long time and all of a sudden you\nhave to reevaluate what performance\nmeans yeah and what high performance\nmeans yes and even start to redefine\nwhat success means right like I think\nit's like we say to these corporations\nlike your success can't just be about\nthe bottom line like are you also\nthinking about diversity and inclusion\nare you also thinking about the\nenvironment in your bottom you know in\nyour definition of success and I feel\nlike I'm trying to do that personally\nalso like think about success in the\nmaterial world but factor into that\nsuccess My Life as a wife my life as a\nmother my life as a daughter and I think\nthat too was part of what made me want\nto write the book was to kind of be able\nto have The Narrative of my life\nreally reflect on all of it because when\nI sold a book idea a few right when the\nshow ended I sold this book idea that\nwas like here are the 10 things I\nlearned about life from this character\nand my parents had just given me this\ninformation about myself but I\nI was like I'm not gonna deal with that\nI'm gonna go sell this other book idea\nand um and that felt like a book I could\nwrite because it was not really about me\nit was about the character and it was\nlike very sticky cute life lessons kind\nof a book but every time I sat down to\nwrite it that didn't feel honest it was\nlike I have this new information I have\nthis new curiosity I have this new\nawareness and if I'm gonna write\nsomething about myself then it has to be\nthat and I was like well I'm not writing\nthat so I tried to give the money back\nto the publisher it was like I'm\ndefinitely not writing that\num but eventually I did eventually I was\nlike What if I just try to write that if\nI try to write what the story is not\njust in terms of the movies and the TV\nshows and the even not just the activism\nand the leadership but really like\nwhat it might mean to feel like a\nsuccessful human like somebody who's\nliving in truth you know\ndo you want to share and I know the book\ngoes into this in depth you want to\nshare because you've referred to it a\nfew times yeah the news that you\nreceived at 43 yeah yeah and obviously\nyou talk about it at length in a book\nbut I'd love to give that to people so\nthat they have a context yes and if you\ndon't want the spoiler then turn off the\npodcast yes this is the moment it is a\nreveal so if you don't want it yeah and\nthat's and I recommend that too like\nyeah don't if you don't want to go over\nthe next skip over the next three\nminutes I'm such a fan I know that like\nyou have those time codes at the bottom\nso just skip to the next we'll put that\non the time code we'll put skip now if\nspoiler or that yes okay so um so my\nparents sat me down\num and told me that\num that my dad is not my biological\nfather that I was born from a sperm\ndonor\num and this was shocking to me and also\nnot right like it was that thing of like\nI was shocked I because it was not the\nstory I had been told and not the story\nwe had been living but also it made so\nmuch sense to me because there had been\nthis sense of like\nI I felt like I Didn't Know Myself and I\nfelt a disconnect with my parents and I\nfelt a disconnect with myself and I\nnever knew what to ascribe that to I\nnever knew why and suddenly it was like\nthe pieces all fell into place it was\nactually like it was like there had been\nthis beautiful puzzle on the wall of our\nhome that had this one wrong piece in it\nbut it was close enough that everybody\njust pretended that the painting was\nperfect you know everybody was like it's\ngorgeous it's beautiful if you got close\nenough you could see that there was a\nmissing puzzle piece but since we all\nignored it we all kind of forgot about\nit and when my parents told me it was\nlike somebody finally took that wrong\npuzzle piece that had been like jammed\ninto place and pulled it out and we got\nto all be honest about like that piece\nwas wrong and we don't even know what\nthe missing piece is because I don't\nknow who the donor is but at least now\nthe on the painting is honest and I can\nmaybe try to find that missing puzzle\npiece but and just to know\nthat the painting now is honest felt\nlike a gift and why did they wait till\n43. I was younger than 43 even I was\nlike yeah like 41 maybe\num I mean my dad if he had his brothers\nwould have never told me which is in\nmany ways\nlike infuriating but also so beautiful\nbecause to my dad I am his and he is\nmine and there's no point in\nacknowledging any other truth I mean\neven to today\nhe'll he acknowledges it he's had to\ncome to terms with it but it doesn't\nmatter and in a really beautiful way\nlike I am his and he is mine he is my\ndad he will always be my dad\num but if he had his choice we would you\nand I would not be having this\nconversation this book would not be\nwritten like we would this would be that\nwe would just be living in this other\nreality that which is you know I'm his\nand uh that we belong to each other\nwhich is true it's just there's more\ncomplexity right there's more Nuance\nthere's it's not a binary it happens to\nbe that like yes we belong to each other\nand there is this other figure that is\n50 of my genetics they waited to tell me\nmy mom said that she was going to write\na note for me and leave it in a safe\ndeposit box so that eventually when they\nwere gone I would have this truth I'm so\nglad that that's not what happened I\nalso wonder like when she was going to\ndo that because at the point that we\nwere having this conversation she had\nhad cancer three times and was like\nknocking on 80. so I was like exactly\nwhen was this note gonna happen right\num so\nI think I think it was hard I think they\ndidn't intend to be duplicitous or they\nweren't trying to lie to me I think they\nit happened at a time I mean my parents\nwere way ahead of the curve there were\nno you know when I was conceived in 77\n76 there were no sperm banks this was\nnot something that people did it was\nlike a highly experimental very\nsecretive thing there was no Frozen\nsperm it was like you know it was all\nvery very Cutting Edge and\num they were innovators and ahead of\ntheir time and Risk Takers and nobody\nknew that 40 years later you'd be able\nto take a DNA test and know where you\ncome from it just was like this is a\nsecret we will take to our Graves\nthere's no point in telling her we need\nto keep our family unit together and we\ndon't need to upset her and we don't\nneed to embarrass our family and they\neventually told me because I was gonna\ndo a show skip Gates has a show on PBS\ncalled Finding Your Roots where they\nresearch your family background and they\ndo it a lot through record keeping and\ncensus reports but they also do DNA\ntests and so I told my parents I was\ngoing to do the show and they were\nreally excited and then I handed them\none of these commercial DNA kits and my\ndad started having panic attacks and I\nwas like what's happening and So\neventually they had to tell me why they\ndidn't want to do the show and and what\nthe truth of our family\nyeah yeah\nhow have you trained yourself to be able\nto I love what you said earlier you were\nlike\nyou wouldn't have told me if it wasn't\nyou know for this but you would have\nfound it infuriating but also the most\nsweet and beautiful thing so how have\nyou allowed yourself\nto accept two things existing at the\nsame time because\nthere's a beautiful statement by F Scott\nFitzgerald where he says that the\nparaphrase version is that\nyou know one of the greatest skills or\ntalents of the human mind is the ability\nto hold two seemingly opposite ideas\nand allow them to coexist yeah and\nthat's such a I feel like that's the art\nthat's missing in the world today yeah\nthe ability to accept that something can\nbe painful and beautiful yeah something\ncan be true and untrue in certain ways\nthat and it feels like even though you\nwere like looking for this truth and\nthis puzzle piece and you have every\nreason because you've known it for your\nwhole like it's so like you make it look\nso elegant but inside your heart it was\nsuch a struggle to be like what is this\none what is wrong with me and what's\nwrong with my life and what is the\nsecret and yeah and then you find it but\nthen you still go you have the grace to\nsay I understand like here's my he is me\nand I am his like that beautiful\nstatement that you just repeated twice\nthere I'm just what has allowed you how\nhave you developed that ability to let\ntwo truths coexist I don't know where it\ncomes it comes throughout the\nI don't know where it was born I mean I\ndo know\nI think maybe one of the first places\nthat I started to think about it\nconsciously again weirdly was in my yoga\npractice right because you learn in yoga\npractice that you must have this\ncombination of being\num steady and strong but also flexible\nand yielding that that's the very\npractice of yoga only works if you can\ntap into the surrender of each pose\ncombined with the commitment and\nstrength for each pose so that's one of\nthe places where I think I started to\nlearn what that feels like in my body\nand and think about it but you know as\nI'm sitting here even just my commitment\nto say and to help my dad say it's okay\nfor me to have two\nenergies in my life that represent\nfather right like that this donor this\nstranger I have no idea who this person\nis there's a whole team of people on the\nsearch but I don't know who this donor\nis\nthat that but that person because of the\namount of genetic material that they've\npoured into me and therefore all kind of\ncoding that person represents some of\nthe father energy in my story and in my\nlife but my dad is my dad right like\nhe's also\nhe represents the father energy in my\nlife he is the man who raised me and he\nhas loved me like a father and he is\nalso father so you know even just like\nthere's no way for me to live my life\nwithout embracing those truths it just\nis the fact of my life maybe there's\nsomething about also like giving myself\nto these characters and like any one\ntime having to be like a hundred percent\nthat character and also 100 me\num that dance between like losing myself\nand coming back to myself and having\nspace to be Carrie but also Olivia or\nwhoever that might be part of it too I\ndon't know but but I do I know that at\ntimes I've seen this as a weakness that\nI that I'm not more decisive or more\num have more critical thinking skills\num but I I do think it it's it is just a\npart of me that I hold on to multiple\nthrough this yeah I I would say that it\nmy humble observation just from our\nconversation and reading your work is\nthat your quest for the truth\nas\nactually ended in finding truths oh yes\nright right because that's it that's\nright right like my I I feel like I'm\nfinally able to tell my truth but\nthere's also this awareness as I sit\nacross from my parents that like this is\nnot the book they would have written and\ntheir book is no less true it's just\nthat's their truth and this is mine yeah\nthat's that's oh that's interesting yeah\nand inside that core of just being it I\ndon't know there's something beautiful\nin in seeing you find your truths and\nand being like Oh there's there's\nactually so many more and there's so\nmany versions and and that almost is\nmore comforting and\nand kind of reassuring that the version\nyou have is not untrue as you were\nsaying earlier at the beginning you were\nlike I was taught to like abandon my\ntruth that's right because again someone\nhad said this is the truth that's right\nbecause the other truths were too\nthreatening right it's funny I talk in\nthe book about how when my parents told\nme you know I had spent my whole life\nsaying I love you to my dad and it was\ntrue I loved my dad before this\nRevelation but when I got this\ninformation\nin that moment I understood that this\nwas an opportunity for a different kind\nof love between us because\nhe had only heard me say I love you on\nthe condition of a lie up until that\npoint up until that point every time I\nsaid I love you it was\npassing through this veil of pretending\nand so there was a part of his\nunconscious that was made to believe\nbecause she thinks I am her biological\nfather she loves me and once I had this\ntruth I knew I now have the opportunity\nto show my father what it feels like to\nactually be loved unconditionally from\nthis point on every time I say I love\nyou it's despite this truth that you\nthought was too horrible to bear\nit felt like such an opportunity for\nhealing you know for us to be in the\nmessy truth and still say I love you is\nso much better than to be in the\npretending and to be loved because when\nyou're pretending and you're loved then\nyou're loved for your pretense you're\nnot loved for your humanity and you can\njust imagine what that felt like to hear\nme yeah that's it's wow that everyone's\njust gonna Replay that part again and\nagain and again because no that's the\npart you want no spoilers in that part\njust listen because that is such a that\nis such a beautiful Point Gary like that\nis that is so powerful what we all\ndeserve right it's like we it's what we\nall crave I think is to be able to like\nbe our true selves and for that version\nof us to be loved not the the version\nwhere we put on the fancy clothes or we\nit's like me at my most naked most\nhonest most vulnerable if I'm still\nloved then then that's real love if I\nhave to work or to deserve the love\nthen it's it's not based on\nme you know yeah because you said in the\nbook before we got onto those gonna read\nthese parts where you talked about when\nI started talking about my family in\ntherapy for the first time in college my\nconcerns and complaints were exclusively\nabout my dad and you talk about how\ndifferent we were how often we\ndisconnected and you said like many 18\nyear olds I thought I knew everything\nand my dad do nothing which is so true\nand then you go on to say even as a\nyoung child I felt that I was never who\nmy dad needed me to be I knew he really\nwanted a son and that they weren't\nhaving any more children I got the sense\nthat I could soften the blow somehow by\nbeing a daughter who was prettier or\nsmarter or braver or more successful but\neven that didn't work what do you think\nthat wasn't working what's that part\nlike I think what I was picking up and\ninterpreting as me not being enough\nwas really the disconnect between us\ncaused by lack of Truth there was always\nlike a moat an emotional moat between\nwho I was and who my parents were like I\nwould watch my mother interact with\ngirlfriends of mine friends I would\nbring home from school and people would\ntell my mother everything people were so\nclose to my parents and I always felt\nlike there was a little bit of arm's\nlength\num and so you know as a kid I thought\nthat must be me it must be that I'm not\ngood enough or pretty enough or\nsuccessful enough or thin enough or\nwhatever it is accomplished enough and\nso I thought maybe if I'm better if I do\nmore if I accomplish more if I'm busier\nthen maybe I'll be able to cross the\nmoat but the moat had nothing to do with\nme the moat was their own protection\nbecause you know I realized now in\nhindsight\nI would say like so many people are like\nbest friends with their mothers they\ntalk to their mothers every day my\nmother could never afford to be best\nfriends with me because there was a\nsecret that she was never going to\nreveal to me you can't be intimate best\nfriends with somebody who your\nfundamental the truth of who they are\nyou're keeping that from them so I was\ninterpreting this emotional distance as\nbeing my fault as being me not being\ngood enough but really it had to do with\nthem trying to manage the relationship\nso that they could protect me from\nsomething that they thought I wouldn't\nbe able to handle or just that would\nkind of destroy my sense of self or our\nsense of family so it was this loving\nact on their part of trying to keep me\nokay and keep our family okay but it did\ncause this this break and this Schism\nbetween us and I just I thought I\nthought I could fix it I thought if I\ncould be better I could fix it and it\nwas in learning the truth of this\nRevelation that I was able to say like\nno I'm I'm okay I'm enough it wasn't\nabout me and now now I talk to my\nparents every day like now it's a\ndifferent the greatest gift of this\nthese few years and even writing this\nbook is that I am so much closer to my\nparents than I have ever been before\nbecause now there's nothing to hide from\neach other there's nothing to there's\nnothing we're trying to protect each\nother from anymore there's no more\nperformance there's no more pretending\nand so now the intimacy is so real yeah\nand it's almost like\nyou you want that for everyone but you\nknow how hard it is it works it was it\nwas you know we went into family therapy\nfor a while and we um yeah all four of\nus my parents and my husband and I we we\nwould we like unpacked a lot of this\ntogether and\nto be on the other side of that\nit's extraordinary you know I talk in\nthe book about how in during the\npandemic my mom was diagnosed with\ncancer again and\nthis time around how I was able to be\npresent for her and with her because\nthere was no longer an arm's length\nthere was no longer this moat between us\nit was\nthe greatest gift to really be able to\nfeel like I I now in this moment when\nwe're faced with mortality like I really\nknow her and she really knows me\nand I know myself now to bring myself to\nthis relationship fully it just it was\nthe greatest gift\num\nand it almost feels now that\nif you are to continue playing roles and\nperformances that you know who you are\nalready so you couldn't lose yourself in\na role or yeah I think they'll be I'm\nexcited I've had I've taken on different\ncharacters since getting this\ninformation and it feels like I'm able\nto go deeper it feels like I'm able to\nbring more of myself and my truth I'm\nmore connected to myself and I'm it's\nit's been it's allowed me to really have\na deeper level of emotional truth that's\nwhat I think about when I watch certain\nperformances you know in the last five\nyears I think\nI'm able to bring more courage more more\npersonal knowing more vulnerability\nbecause I'm not operating out of fear\nanymore I'm not looking to these\ncharacters to fix me or to teach me\nabout myself I'm actually able to devote\nmyself to them fully and\nI've thought a lot about\num it's so funny because when you're\ninterviewing you'll see eventually when\nyou're interviewing for all these\nschools with your kids\nexcuse like how the kid was born or like\nthe circumstances of their birth like to\nenter into like a preschool you're like\nwhat are you talking about and\nwhy is that any of your business they're\nhere to learn their ABCs right but\nthere's so much imprinting that happens\nto us in utero and I do think it's so\npowerful for us to go back and uncover\nthe story of who we are and how we came\nto be it's why you know a street you\ngrew up on it's like that like what is\nyour once upon a time and I thought\nabout it a lot in thinking about my\nstory because I think\nthought like how afraid my mother must\nhave been here this woman was like\ncarrying a baby that she had no idea she\nhad no idea where the sperm came from\nback then there was no fancy catalog to\ntell you like what college they went to\nor what like nothing the two things they\nsaid to her doctor were like we'd love\nhim to be healthy and we'd love him to\nbe black because if he was black then\nthey wouldn't have to tell people it\ncould remain a secret\num but she must have been terrified and\nshe knew also like as she was carrying\nme she began carrying a secret that she\nwas going to carry for four decades and\nso I was like my twin was shame like I\nwas in utero with shame we were growing\ntogether like in this pact of secrecy\nand she literally never told a soul my\nparents lit not she's she has four\nsisters she just told them this year\nthis spring\num she never told her best friend she\nnever told anyone they they are\nliterally telling people now because\nthey're like listen this book is coming\nout and I want you to hear this thing\nfrom me so that fear and shame that was\ngrowing inside her that was the soup\nthat I was stewing in you know that I\nwas cooking in and I think we get born\nwith with those\nwith that identity and and we get to\nnavigate it yeah you know thank you for\nsharing that part too because it makes\nsense with when you said you wished you\nwere not an only child and your parents\nresponded\nyou were long wished for a child\nyou are not easy to conceive and like\nthat idea of just\nit's that beauty if they wanted you so\nbad like even like I joke about my dad's\nyou know his unwillingness to deal with\nthe truth of how I came to be right like\nit's so beautiful not just because it's\na testament of how much he loves me but\nwhen my parents sat down across from\nthat doctor they said you have two\noptions looking at my dad's sperm you\nhave two options you can either adopt or\nyou can try this new thing artificial\ninsemination right and it was my dad's\nego it was their desire to keep a secret\nthat made them choose artificial\ninsemination over adoption so if my\nparents hadn't had that ego if my dad\nhadn't been navigating his pride I\nliterally wouldn't be here there'd be\nsome lucky kid who would have been\nadopted by them and raised by this\nbeautiful couple and all the stuff they\nwere navigating but it was actually\ntheir pride and secrecy that put me on\nthis Earth so I have to be grateful for\nit I have to be grateful for their stuff\ntheir you know the the emotional stuff\nthat they're navigating because it it\nwas my Pathway to being on this planet\nwell I find that I said this to you when\nwe met the other day when we did the\nstreet you grew up on which which I\nreally felt was such a gift and if\nanyone who's listening or watching I'm\nsure you watch already but if you\nhaven't go and subscribe to\nuh Carey's YouTube show because\nI found it to be such a gift to go back\nthere you've written a memoir now so\nyou've really gotten back yeah I've\nnever written one but I find the act of\ngoing back there like you reminded me of\nso many things that I've completely\nforgot yeah it was so fun to watch you\nhave these Revelations about where you\ncome from so many things that you just\nyour memory is such a fascinating thing\nin and of itself but I said this to you\nthat day when I saw you and and I'm\nrepeating it now because I want my I\nsaid it offline to you but I want my\nCommunity to hear it I found your take\non your challenges so refreshing and\nunique because you'd be valid in just\nbeing upset and there's nothing wrong\nwith that and if it was someone else who\nwas I become it's so valid but then when\nyou hear someone who's seeing it from\nmultiple perspectives and there was also\nthis the most challenging part of this\nbook to read was when you talked about\nthe encounters you were having while you\nwere sleeping\nand even in this and I'll let you\nexplain it but even when I was reading\nthrough that I was just like how is\nKerry\neven explaining this with so much\ncompassion and so much grace and I was\nlike you just have this capacity\nto hold pain and compassion at the same\ntime and I think that that is so rare\nand I just want to acknowledge it and\nhonor it that's not a weakness at all I\nthink it's really powerful like to be\nable to do that and when I was reading\nthat I was just I you were blowing my\nmind I was just like how is a human I\nreally find that you know you read about\npeople who've gone through some of the\nmost horrific things in the world and\nand they live that way\nand and then yeah I was in awe reading\nthat honestly like yeah I I think when\nI'm as I'm listening to I think the\ndanger for me has always been in not\nhaving the anger part right right that\nthat's it's funny it's like the\ncompassion comes more easily weirdly I\ndon't know if it's the people-pleasing\nor the being an only child or whatever\nit is the maybe it's being an artist\nbut the compassion part comes first the\njourney for me has been allowing myself\nto have the anger allowing myself to\num create healthy boundaries for myself\nto allow for the pain and the grief at\ntimes and then to still make room for\nthe compassion that's what I felt yeah\nyeah to be able to like\nhold space for both\num and I think a lot of it is selfish I\ndon't want to be a person who operates\nfrom toxicity you know when I'm when I'm\ncarrying when I'm only operating from\nresentment\nit's poison for me to hold space for\nloving myself and loving other people in\nall of our imperfection is for me what\nfeels\ndoable it actually helps me have more\ngrace for myself when I'm able to have\nGrace for other people and I I talk\nabout that Pema children idea of like\nthe person that causes you the most pain\nthat's the person that sat with you in\nheaven before you came to Earth and said\nlike I love you so much I'm gonna be the\none that hurts you that forces you to\ngrow I love you so much I'm gonna be\nyour enemy that teaches you what love\nlooks like and I think\nI think we are really really all doing\nthe best we can and when I when I'm not\nable to have compassion my life is like\nthis hose right and the emotions are\ncoming through the hose if I choke the\nhose from compassion for somebody else I\nchoke it for myself too\num and I just I want to let it run free\nI wanna I wanna let the goodness go\nthrough so that I'm able to give it to\nmyself and others because we're all\nreally just doing the best we can and\nthat looks like a lot of different ways\nfor a lot of different people and it\ndoesn't mean that\nin my compassion and forgiveness that I\nhave to engage with everybody all the\ntime right like having healthy\nboundaries is also important but I I\nwanna I always wanna\nLeave Myself open to Grace because I\nneed it for me too I love that idea of\nhow am I joking\nour life or someone else of compassion\nyou're actually blocking it from\nyourself that's but and that's what I\nmeant I it was not a naive compassion\nthat I was reading of it wasn't uh it\ndidn't come across as a\npeople pleasing or\noh I'm just protecting and you know it\ndidn't it didn't feel like that it just\nreally felt like a realized version of\nthat and that's even harder I think some\nof that too honestly comes from the\nacting because you're taught early on\nthat you to play a character you can't\njudge your character\nlike when you're playing a bad guy you\ncan't think of it as a bad guy it's what\nmy some of my favorite stories and my\nfavorite narratives are these like\norigin stories for the villains you know\nthe Cruella and the Joker like these\nthese I love that because I feel like\nit's really true that hurt people hurt\npeople and\nvillains come from somewhere and so\num as an actor you learn that when\nyou're playing a character who does\nsomething awful you better figure out\nwhy you better figure out what it is\nthat caused this person to make those\nchoices because it's not going to be\nreal if you don't do that you're just\ngoing to be like some Arch stereotype of\na bad guy if you want to be a human\nbeing who's doing something awful figure\nout the why what what's at stake what is\nthat person afraid of what is that\nperson needing what is that person\nlonging for how was that person abused\num and so I've I've had to learn\ncompassion even just for my characters\nor maybe I'm drawn to playing\ncomplicated characters because I really\nlove to cultivate compassion I don't\nknow but it's definitely a part of kind\nof the culture of how I approach my life\nand my work it sounds like you're such a\nyou're such a Seeker in the truth in in\nspiritually in your life in your work\nwhat is it that you're seeking now at\nthis point in your life like what is it\nthat you're trying to learn or be\ncurious about I think this next little\nchapter which is like beginning right\nnow\nI'm learning to be in my truth publicly\nand to see what that feels like and what\nimpact it has on me and my family\nbecause it's so new for me I've been so\nprivate as a you know a person in the\npublic eye I've really not talked a lot\nabout myself so I'm really trying to be\ncurious about what this experience feels\nlike and and how it changes me I'm\ncurious about who my donor is I'm so\nthat's it feels like\nanother part of the quest\nbut I'm also aware that\nthat lack of information also feels like\ninformation like the fact that the\nUniverse hasn't given me this answer of\nlike this is who he is this is it feels\nlike an invitation to move into deeper\nrelationship with the family I come from\nmy family of origin right like that I\nhave this new kind of Truth with my\nparents a different kind of Truth with\nmy kids like telling my kids about you\nknow my parents and how I came to be all\nof that\num but also into a deeper relationship\nwith like\nlike a spirit father you know like\nFather time like the archetype of Father\nLike A Heavenly Father Like to lean into\nmy connection to a higher power as\nbringing me those fatherly things that\nsense of belonging and safety and\num being cared for that I'm I'm\ninterested in this opportunity to\ncultivate that in my spirit world\nbecause I don't have it in the material\nworld I have it but I don't have it\nfully I have these you know I have my\ndad who's incredible and wonderful and I\nhave this mystery donor so I have father\nenergy but there's a deeper security\nthat I can seek I think in my spiritual\npractice wow so beautiful what was your\nintention in your career to\nbe was it intentional to be private\nand what are you hoping that the public\naspect that you said you were seeking to\nfigure out how it's\nwhat what was the intention behind going\nin that direction it's funny because it\nfeels accidental I mean really I've\nalways\num I decided at a certain point in my\ncareer I had been in a very public\nrelationship it was very public\nengagement and when that ended I was\nlike I don't think I want to give this\nmuch information to the Press ever again\nand my husband and I were of the same\nfeeling when we met we were very private\nthe whole time we were dating when we\ngot married people were like what like\nwe didn't even know they knew each other\nlike very and this was at the height of\nboth of our careers\num he was like on the cover of Sports\nIllustrated and I was on this hit show\nand we wound up somehow having this very\nsecret private courting and marriage it\nwas so beautiful\num I remember when I called my parents\nto tell them I was pregnant they were\nlike so you'll tell people like when the\nkid's in college like that I was like\nprobably\num so it just it it has felt like um a\nway to protect the people that matter\nmost to me but my parents have always\nbeen a part of my public identity\nbecause you know I don't I didn't need\nto protect my relationship with my\nparents and they're not children you\nknow I don't I keep my kids off social\nmedia because I feel like they should\nmake decisions about how they and there\nare a lot of ways to do it there's no\nright or wrong but for us I feel like my\nkids should be of an age where they know\nhow they want to enter that social media\nspace and I don't want to make those\ndecisions for them but my parents are\nold enough to make those decisions so I\nkind of started posting more with my\nparents because I was like I gotta post\nsomething right like so I would post my\ndog and post my parents and I was doing\nthese dad jokes with my dad and my dad\nbecame a bit of a celebrity on my\nInstagram\nand so then when I got this information\nI was suddenly like\noh I am complicit now in a lie because\nI'm out here perpetuating this truth\nthat's not my whole truth and so\nsuddenly I was like\nI didn't want to\nkeep a secret the way my parents had\nkept a secret because I don't feel like\nthere's anything shameful about this I\ndon't feel like there's any reason to\nnot talk about it so part of the telling\nof the story was like this is a way for\nme to be corrective and just not feel\nlike I'm perpetuating a lie that I\ndidn't even know I was lying when I was\ndoing it but now I want to just be\ntransparent so we'll see I I don't know\nit's it's very new for me to be this\nopen\num but I guess I also just\nthere's a saying that we're as sick as\nour secrets\num and I want to offer\nhealing to my parents and to our\nrelationship by by not having it be in\nthe dark by speaking the truth of our\njourney and of my journey in particular\none of the things that's been really\nwonderful about as I've shared the book\nwith people is that people immediately\ntell me their family secrets like\nimmediately it's so funny and so I've\nrealized like All Families have them and\npeople feel less alone when they read\nthe book because this person who has\nbeen so private and I really have kind\nof maintained a certain level of\nHollywood like this is who I am and I'll\nlet you in only this much and to to let\npeople in more\nto allow that level of vulnerability\nhelps me feel less alone but I think\nalso has is helping readers feel less\nalone yeah I believe that for sure and I\nI love that that's what's happening as a\nresponse to the book because how\nbeautiful would it be if every friend\nwho picked up this book and shares it\nwith their friend is now able to open up\nabout something that they've been\nholding on to let go of Shame and to let\ngo of Secrets and that's what I want for\npeople to and and also I think it's\nimportant to see to see where we are as\na family right to know that we're closer\nthan ever that this Revelation actually\nwasn't the fracturing of my family that\nit actually was the birth of our true\nintimacy and closeness with each other\nand for me like a real beginning a sense\nof like I don't have to hide\nI can now really do and be anything it's\nso empowering to hear that yeah it's\nvery liberating very liberating\nliberating yeah I think that's part of\nit too is like if people find out that\nthis is the real deal of how I came to\nbe in the story of my family like I\nwanted to own the narrative I didn't\nwant anybody else to be able to tell my\nstory I wanted to be able to\ntell my own story to claim it and to\nhave it and to know that it was mine\nthat it is mine I'm still living it this\nis definitely like act one there's\nthere's more to do and be but it's mine\nyeah there's this beautiful line that\nyou you say you're talking to your\ntherapist about it and then you explain\nit and it says when you teach a person\nto believe that their internal truth is\na lie you take from them the very thing\nthat is most important to each of us our\nability to know and trust ourselves and\nI can only imagine how much you trust\nyourself now so much more it's true\nthat's I guess that's why I keep saying\nlike I'm so curious about\nwho I'll be on the other side of this\nchapter like once this is out there\nbecause I do feel like I trust myself\nmore now I understand myself more I\ntrust myself I feel stronger I feel\nliberated I feel like I have more\ncapacity for compassion more capacity to\nlove myself more understanding of myself\nmore capacity to understand and love my\nparents and therefore more capacity to\nunderstand and love friends and other\nfamily members and my kids if we are as\nsick as our secrets then I am getting\nhealthier and healthier every day you\nknow so I'm I'm grateful for that\nbecause I I want to offer that to my\nkids and to myself and to my parents\nyeah we deserve that you know that's\nwhat this community is about it's about\nhealth and happiness and that's like to\nbe able to know that truth can lead to\nthat because sometimes the truth seems\nso scary you know it's not that my\nparents were being mean they were afraid\nbut that you can walk through that fear\ntoward a deeper healing in truth is is\nreally what I want people to know\n[Music]\ncan I ask a practical question basically\nwe just said how did you talk about this\nto your kids because I can imagine that\nthat's scary because it's a lot for them\nyeah they're still young but you know\nwhat it's a lot it's a lot less scary\nfor them because my kids have grown up\nin a world where half of their friends\nare born from surrogate moms or donor\neggs or donor sperm or like they have\nfriends with two dads friends with two\nmoms like they're not up against some of\nthe like constricting conservative ideas\nof who families are and how they come to\nbe that my parents were battling 40\nyears ago 40 plus years ago so it's a\ndifferent conversation with my kids it's\nkind of much more normal I'm like a I'm\njust like ahead of the curve\num but it's also very different like the\nconversation we had with our 17 year old\nwas very different than the conversation\nwith my six-year-old right like super\ndifferent\num and that's part of it is I and in\ngeneral when it comes to this kind of\nlike Advanced information we try to be\nbe led by their questions you kind of\nlike we offer them a little bit of\ninformation and then ask them what\nquestions they have because I don't want\nto overwhelm them with information but I\nalways want them to know that they can\nask me anything anything anything\nthere's no bad answers no wrong answers\nnothing you can't ask\num and and that the door is always open\nso you know like my 17 year old had more\nquestions my six-year-old had zero\nquestions\num my nine-year-old had a couple of\nquestions and then was on to the next\nthing but they for them it's not a huge\ndeal\nand also it's not a huge deal because\nfundamentally my dad is my dad like\nthat's the big thing is that nothing has\nchanged there there's more information\nand I'm going to learn more about who I\nam and therefore they're going to learn\nmore about who they are but the bottom\nline is my dad is my dad and that's not\nchanging so they have that security I\nlove that that's beautiful Carrie we and\nevery on purpose episode with the final\nfive yeah I want to ask you before we do\nthat\nis there anything I haven't asked you\nabout that's on your heart that's on\nyour mind that you've really want to\nshare that you want to dive into that\nyou want to talk about that we haven't\ncovered today for whatever reason and so\nI just want to give you the floor and\nask you if there's\nanything that you really wanted to share\nthat doesn't have to be was it\nsurprising to you how much time I spent\nin India yes\nand we should talk about that yeah yeah\nsure I I had no idea uh-huh I was like\nyeah you've definitely been private\nbecause I feel like India is such a big\npart of my work and my heart and my\nspiritual home that I love when people\nhave spent time in India it's such a\nspecial place yeah it lives so deeply in\nme I I really want to go back and I want\nto bring my family and even my husband\nis like I have to go because it's so\nmuch a part of you\num I do feel like you know when I talk\nabout the street I grew up on it's\nPugsley Avenue in the Bronx but I also\nfeel like Kerala raised me you know it\nwas the first place I lived when I left\nthe Cocoon of college right when I was\nreally into like college is over you're\nlike for real an adult now you're on\nyour own and I walked into that in India\nwhich is like the most magical of places\num so I'm I'm really really grateful\nfor that place and I hope that I can\nspend more time there how many times\nhave you been back only only that one\ntime\nyeah yeah I would love to go back do you\ngo back often I go back every year you\ndo and where are you so I'll go to the\nashram that I spent time in which is in\nMumbai and then two hours outside of\nMumbai how long do you stay there I'll\nbe there for it it varies like this time\nI'm going for I'm going to another\npilgrimage this year in West India and\nthat's for around a week to 10 days and\nthen in January I'm going back to the\nashram that I was in for like two weeks\nwow and so it varies sometimes I go back\nfor three weeks sometimes it's been a\nmonth and do you just like set aside\nthat time a year ahead on your calendar\nI try to yeah I try to make it a time\nthat's always in and that it's a time to\ncompletely disconnect so I won't be on\nmy phone we prep content in advance so\nthat I don't have to think about the\npodcast or social media I just want to\nbe fully\nyeah and it's really fun we love doing\nit together oh that's so it's a really\nbeautiful way of just both of us getting\na reset if anything\nshe makes us do it even more than I do\nnow like she's like you know she loves\nit and it's such a we sometimes take our\nfamily we'll take our parents really\nyeah it's really beautiful for them as\nwell we just feel like doing more\nspiritual things together as a family is\njust so deeply bonding in a different\nway it's so important for our like\nconnections yeah we find that taking her\nparents and mine is is a big part of it\nis it hard for you to transition in and\nout of like when you get there do you\nmiss the secular life and when you're\nwhen you're leaving are you like okay\nI'm done are you like oh I wish I could\nstay longer I think one of the greatest\ngreatest\nskills that monk training gave to me was\nthe ability to just be where I am and be\nokay with it and then move when it's\ndone and so I find that as long as I\nknow why I am where I am and as long as\nI know it's intentional\num then I feel very grateful that I can\nwake up and just feel\nI'm where I'm meant to be and I think\nthat was all because of the way we were\ntrained where you weren't\nnowhere was more home than anywhere else\nand that's like a really interesting\ntraining because most of the time we're\ntrying to believe like know where your\nhome is know where your roots are but\nthis was almost like well if your roots\nwere here then you were always at home\nthat if you were aligned here then you\nwere always centered and grounded you\ndidn't you didn't need an external thing\nnow that doesn't mean today that I don't\nlike having I love my home here and I\nlove feeling grounded here and yes do I\nfeel more happy when I'm here than in a\nhotel room sure but I don't feel I wake\nup without purpose in a hotel room if\nI'm there for a reason or when I was\ntouring this year or whatever it may be\nand so I think I look at purpose as my\nhome or at least at least as a mindset\nand an approach right so I feel like I\ncan kind of\nswitch back on and off I've never done a\nbook tour before do you have any advice\nfor me well I'm excited watching your\nbook tour I was trying to join you my my\nschedule is not so now it looks amazing\nyou've got so many amazing guests\njoining you like I can't wait to hear\nthe conversations that come out of it\nand the things that other people share\nyeah I'm up you should ask every person\nto share a seek a family Family secret\nbecause That'll be amazing you can't\nimagine the healing but my my only\nadvice which I mean you've done you've\nbeen on set for months and you've tried\nI mean you don't need my advice but for\nwhatever it's worth\nI there were two things the F and one's\nexternal one's internal the external is\nmy health was my number one priority\nbecause it's so easy to fall sick when\nyou're traveling now practically what\ndid that mean and practically that meant\nhaving a routine even though it wasn't\nmy routine here kind of like a tour\nroutine yes so I slept at 2 A.M because\nI'd get off stage at like 10 30 I do a\nmeet and greet I'd be amped I'd eat at\nmidnight and then I'd sleep at 2AM I'd\nwake up at 9am so I'd get seven hours of\nsleep I'd then go on a walk around the\ncity that I was in with myself whatever\nyou were yeah with my tour manager or\nwith my team whoever's with me would\njust go on a long walk get like 10 to 20\n000 steps sometimes like just really get\nactive yeah and be in the place because\nwe weren't really in a place for longer\nthan a night so I was like not that I\nwanted to see the city but I was like I\nwant to be outdoors I don't want to be\nin a gym or you know I don't want to get\nlost in that so that was really great\nand then I would eat breakfast at nine\nand then lunch at 12 and then I'm gonna\neat again and I would just I was\nallowing myself to just be on stage at\nnight\nand in the sense of like I was like I\ndon't need to achieve more because I was\nstarting off like being on stage we'd\nstart a meditation at 3am 3 P.M and then\nI wouldn't get off stage until 10 30 and\nfinish till midnight so it was just like\nmy nine hour work day started at 3 P.M\nand so allowing myself in the morning I\ndon't need to rush to meetings I don't\nneed to be on a million phone calls I\njust need to focus on being present\nbecause then I can give people the best\nexperience and and honor that experience\nso it was a very like disciplined\napproach good and and really to take it\nall in like I'm sure there's going to be\ntears I'm sure there's going to be\nlaughs I'm sure people are going to want\nto hug you after this and share their\nstory and it's like I look back and I\nthink of like when and it's what you\nwere saying that as your life becomes\nmore public\nthere's as you know better than anyone\nthere's there's scrutiny there's there's\ncriticism there's whatever I found that\nthe love I got from my community when I\nwas traveling was enough to keep me\nafloat for all the times at all it fills\nThe Well of all the other stuff that\ncomes and goes you get to see people's\neyes and you get to see someone look\ninto your eyes and say this book is\ngoing to change my life whatever and\npeople are going to say that to you like\npeople can have their stories of what\nyou've discovered and just getting to\nhear that from people and see people say\nit people have been fans of yours for so\nlong and you've probably never heard\nthem say in this intimate way people\nhave loved your characters yeah not you\nyeah that's so true and so just taking\nit all in and allowing yourself to be\npresent with it so the external thing is\nthe discipline of the health and the\ninternal thing is allowing yourself I\nthink sometimes we're so\naware of like ego and worrying about\nwhatever it may be and being modest and\nand I was just like you know what I'm\njust gonna soak up all the love just\ntake in all the love like whenever I\nallow myself to just really receive the\nlove and I need it too I need to be\nnurtured by love why am I deflecting it\nor whatever just just take the love like\nit's so funny when you say that because\nwhen I was reading your book which is\njust like a full-on study of love in all\nof its forms I felt like in so many ways\nit was like my Memoir is like your book\nin the wild like it's so many Concepts\nthat you talk about in terms of\nforgiveness or partnership or\nvulnerability like it's it's what I'm\nexpressing of how I was grappling with\nthat like if only I had had your book\nwhen I was like 12 to help me walk\nthrough life but it's really fun to to\nsee how\nusable your your book is so like it's\nit's so spot on and giving people what\nwe need in life that's so reassuring\nthank you I mean that I could only dream\nof having it\nconnect with a real life story as much\nas that because yeah thank you that that\nmeans a lot to me thank you I really\nreceived that that's so special yeah\nyeah I you know\njust I mean\nI think that's that's kind of like the\nthe perfect match in the world where we\nneed where it's like the we need the\nhuman story of\nwhat it really looks like because it's\nmessy and it's uncomfortable and then\nhopefully we can all extrapolate lessons\nfrom yeah and get our toolbox it's like\nlike if you get triggered reading this\nbook get Jay's\nbooks to help you grow and heal no and I\nsay the other way around I feel like\npeople need to see the messiness of what\nit looks like\nand and I don't shy away from that but I\nthink when you read about it and you see\nlike oh this is what the uncomfortable\nconversation look like that's what the\nRevelation looks like this is what the\nwork looks like like I think we need\nboth sides because sometimes we have a\nromantic view of what growth looks like\nand what having the Revelation\nconversation with your family looks like\nand we know that that's not true right\nright and I would love to I love how\nmuch time you spend in India for sure I\nwas I was definitely surprised what\nwould you say what would you say then in\nthat regard was like obviously you\ntalked about the gift of your yoga\ntraining yeah talked about the gift of\nyou referred to it many many times what\nwas what was the\nwhat surprised you about India\nI think the thing that was most\nsurprising and impactful for me about\nIndia was how drenched in God everything\nis you know like I grew up in\ncommunities where there's like a liquor\nstore in every corner but in India\nthere's a an altar on every corner\nthere's just you know when you walk into\nsomeone's house there's an altar there's\na Puja room there's a there's like you\ncan't escape God if you wanted the very\nway you say hello is like an\nacknowledgment of the god in each other\nso\nthat was really powerful for me in a\ntime when I was really seeking God in my\nhealing and\num\nyeah I just I found it impossible to\nescape a sense of spirituality in India\nand it's not an easy place right like\npeople are not it's not like everywhere\nyou turn everybody's comfortable and\nthings are easy so it is this\ncombination of like life is hard life is\nvibrant and chaotic and like the\neverything's so pungent right like the\nsense and the colors and the it's it's\nso filled with life like real material\nlife and yet every single inch of that\nis also connected to God and that I feel\nlike is something that I try to live in\nmy life like to live life fully like out\nloud and big and in truth and to go\nafter whatever it is that the Dharma is\nleading you toward but to not have it\njust be for self or for material this\nlife to have it be about God and with\nGod and for God and that it feels like\nthat's so much of what I learned there\nyeah well I mean I don't think I don't\nthink there's any greater gift that a\nplace could give you that's pretty\nspectacular yeah so special yeah and\nit's uh\nI I'd love to show you my temperament\nafterwards\nbut no I hope Gary this has been a\nserving and an offering to your offering\nto the world I really mean that because\nI really believe that this book for you\nis not a\nit's not a\ncelebrity Memoir like yeah it's it's so\nmuch it's so\nit's so human and so\nit's so truth seeking and so I really\nhope that this has served you and served\nyour offering in the world and you know\nI'm excited for everyone to to read it\nto connect with it to share with their\nfamily share with their friends and\nand hopefully uncover discover and\nrecover from family secrets that may be\nholding you back in whatever way and\nbeing able to have the grace to\nhold the supposed Paradox with that you\nknow compassion and empathy amen yeah\namen thank you that's my open intention\nfor for you and your book tour and I\nwish you nothing but so much impact and\ncan already see everyone smiling in the\nfaces and the lives being impacted and\nchanged based on the work you've done so\nthank you so much it's such a privilege\nto be here so grateful I still have to\nask you the final five oh yes okay I\nknow you tried to dodge them carriers\nyeah I should have prepared you know the\nfan I should have prepared distract me\nbut I hope yeah I hope we got if there\nwas anything else that you want no this\nwas amazing all right I wanted to\nmention Lord be honest with me anytime\nokay so all right question one Gary what\nis the best advice you've ever received\nor had\nbest advice I've ever received or heard\nis to pray hmm\nwhen I learned to pray\nand meditate to me there are sort of two\nsides of the same coin you know like\nit's the talking to God and listening to\nGod you know whenever in my life I'm\nreminded to pray\nit's never a bad thing it's always a\npath to goodness\nbecause it's always an act of surrender\nand an invitation to help and the the\nact of prayer for me end of meditation\nis really for me about picking up a tool\nof humility because when I'm not making\nroom for Spiritual practice it's like I\nthink I'm in charge and so the the\nprayer helps me remember and the\nmeditation helps me remember to be part\nof something greater to not be trying to\ncontrol and run everything but to\nconnect myself to something bigger what\na great answer we've never had that\nbefore in the show what did how did you\nlearn how to pray\nand for anyone who struggles with prayer\nbecause they think they have to have the\nperfect words or they don't know where\nto start like what would you suggest for\nsomeone it was part of\num my first time I ever got on my knees\nreally to ask something greater than me\nfor help was when I was really\nstruggling with my eating disorder stuff\nwhich I talk about\num and that was that was the first time\nin my life that I was like I can't fix\nthis like I don't know I do not have the\ntools and I don't know where to go and I\ndon't know what to do and I'm gonna need\nsomebody or something to step in and\nhelp me out\num that was my first experience with\nprayer and then there's a really\nbeautiful book I think it's one of the\nmost important books that I've read in\nmy life called the artist Way by Julia\nCameron and that book taught me a lot\nabout bringing spiritual practice into\nmy creativity and into my life as\ncreative practice but prayer through\njournaling and I think there's no wrong\nway to pray and honestly I my prayer\nlooks like all different kinds of ways\nlike it I think like any relationship\n my relationship with spirit is\nalways evolving and changing according\nto where I am and you know sometimes\nit's like sitting on the pillow with the\ncandle and the incense is like that's it\nit's just like sometimes date night is\nlike that perfect elegant five star\nyou're dressed up he's in a suit it's a\nhole right like sometimes the ritual is\nthat and sometimes it's like I'm in my\ncar I'm at the red light I'm like all\nright God like I'm gonna need you to\nstep in and you know take this day on\nyou know sometimes it's just singing\ngospel music sometimes it's doing some\nsun salutations sometimes it's like just\nsaying God God Only God 107 times in a\nrow like whatever it is it can be it can\nbe so many different things sometimes\nit's just swimming but that just making\nroom for seeking other something greater\nthan me\nit's beautiful what a wonderful do you\npray with the kids and we do at night we\ndo\num at night we do prayer requests and\ngratitude together as a family I love\nthat yeah that's so special yeah it is\nreally special it's really fun to watch\nthe kids come up yeah it's great you\nknow you never know I mean sometimes\nit's like there sometimes their\ngratitude is really profound\num I'm grateful that a grandparent is\nfeeling better or I'm grateful for this\nfamily trip and time with cousins and\nsometimes it's like I'm really grateful\nfor pickles you're like what okay you\nknow like that's cool that too is God\nright so like it's really it's fun and\nand also the the prayer request is it's\njust our kind of family way of\nremembering to think outside yourself\nand sometimes the prayer can be for\nyourself I really hope my ankle feels\nbetter I really but it's also a way to\nremember\nto include other people in your seeking\nyou know beautiful I love that all right\nwell that was just question one okay I\nknow question number two what is the\nworst advice you've ever had or received\nI'm think about this book that I talk\nabout in my book that I like stole from\nthe library when I was a kid that was\ncalled a new you that you missed the\ndude yes I missed the dude again and\nagain and again and again um\nyou know this idea that it it appears in\nlike magazines for young women and it\nthere's this messaging out there that to\nbe loved you must be something other\nthan who you are you know that to be\nloved you have to be prettier and you\nhave to know what colors are right for\nyou and you have to know how to sit and\nhow to walk and how to stand and\num I'm all about being having good\nmanners and being appropriate to a\nsituation but the idea that you have to\nbe on somebody other than who you are to\nbe deserving of Love is messaging that I\nwas is damaging I think it was\ndefinitely damaging for me and I think\nfor a lot of people\nyeah and that's and it gets so ingrained\nyes and it sounds so obvious but it's\nit's not and it and it's so subtle and\nso yeah I mean even from a young age\nwhen you hear kids saying like I need\nthose sneakers or else I'm not gonna be\ncool like it's these messages these I\nthink consumerism has a lot to do with\nthis idea that you must have that\nlipstick or that mascara or that\nfacelift or those pair of jeans or\nwhatever it is in order to be good\nenough and\num it's just not true it's just not true\nyou are lovable and by the way love\nsneakers love lipstick Love mascara like\nyou can have those things you can play\nwith those things but but the idea that\nto do the you must do those things to be\nlovable to be worthy that's where\num the wrong messaging yeah gets\nimplanted yeah to quote Tick Tock I\ndon't know if you've seen this new tutor\nwhich I love and it's and the the the\nthe sound is telling you how to dress to\nimpress a man oh I love that one yeah\neveryone's like doing the opposite yes\nit's so great yeah so great yeah I\nhaven't done that one I should do that\none yeah I someone I saw someone do it\nwith their daughter the other day oh my\nGod it was so cute yes yeah it's really\ncool so anyway\num but that that idea definitely I love\nthat great answer all right question\nnumber three is how would you define\nyour current purpose\nmy current purpose is to\nhold space\nfor my scary truths and other people's\nscary truths and to create community in\nthat\num\nthat's really powerful and that's\namazing I think that's it for now it\nsounds like a good one for Q4 that's the\npurpose for Q4 I'll get back to you yeah\nI love that I love that it's so nice to\nput into words though isn't it yeah even\nto think about it it's like yeah yeah\nthat's great I love the answer all right\nquestion number four we talked about\nwhat you're trying to learn now is there\nanything you're trying to unlearn is\nthere any beliefs that you're trying to\nunlearn or values or ideas\nI think I'm working to unlearn the\nbelief\nthat I am not enough\nand I think I'm working to unlearn\nthe belief that I am\nless important and less deserving\nwhere does that still come from where is\nthat\nwhere's that hiding\nI think there is you know what I think\nabout the word sacrifice and that\nsacrifice does come from sacred right\nand and I think for some reason\nas an only child as a as a young person\nI understood\nthat there was something sacred about\nsacrificing\nmy own need or desire or truth even\nto make space for someone else's Journey\nI've placed so much value on other\npeople's sense of joy and goodness and\nsafety that I've been willing to\nsacrifice my own sense of joy and\ngoodness and safety\n[Music]\nand I don't regret it\nI think\nit's not wrong to care about how other\npeople feel and want to do what's right\nfor other people I'm just learning to\nlet myself be one of those people right\nto include myself it's not like now I\nwant to do whatever I want to do and to\nhell with whoever it hurts but it's like\nI need to be as important as the other\npeople I'm considering that I deserve\nthat\nthat's new for me yeah one of the\ngreatest lessons I think I've tried to\nlearn is that\nagain the world is trying to do either\nor so\nsome of us think the answer is just take\ncare of yourself who cares about what\nanyone else thinks and the opposite is\nwe'll just sacrifice just serve Just\nSurrender and give yourself over to\neveryone that's the greatest gift and\nsomething that I've learned that has\nreally helped me is that actually taking\ncare of myself yes in order to serve\nothers yes is the complete picture that\ntaking care of myself is not selfish if\nmy intention and reasoning is\nso I can go out and do more give more be\nmore for others but I can't do more give\nmore and be more for others if I'm\ngiving everyone The Leftovers of that's\nright I have to give from my overflow\ncorrect yeah yeah and similarly\nI've also learned that sometimes giving\nto others is a way that I can be giving\nto myself absolutely because I can like\nmy giving to others can be How I build\nhope and community and belonging for\nmyself there can be this dialogue\nbetween the two so just to not forget\nmyself in the equation is so important\nyeah and that when you give to someone I\nalso notice it this way that when I give\nsomething to someone\noften I feel like I'm the one doing the\ngiving but actually the fact that\nthere's someone there to receive it it's\nsuch a guess it's a gift because if\nthere was no one for you to give you a\ngift to\nthen it would feel incomplete and so the\nfact that even someone has a challenge\nan opportunity a moment that you get to\ngive something to someone\nwe have to see that good for ourselves\nright as opposed to this feeling of like\noh I I did this for all of them that's\nright that's right that's right yeah so\nyeah that's beautiful I love that all\nright Fifth and final question which we\nasked to every guest you should have\npracticed Carrie but if you could create\none law that's right that everyone in\nthe world had to follow\nwhat would it be\ntake your time\none law your answer so far have been\nfantastic a plus plus for everything so\nmuch pressure one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow I think it would\nbe required compassion and empathy\ntraining\num when I think about all of the like\nills of society all of our kind of\nsocial evils come from us not being able\nto care for each other and when you even\nwhen you think of like really mentally\nill folks that it that there there is\nI don't want to say that because some of\nit is biological but there I feel like\nthere could be so much pain that's\navoided we could stop so much transfer\nof generational pain and suffering we\ncould prevent so much abuse if we could\njust give people empathy and compassion\ntraining it would impact how we\nlegislate how we interact with one\nanother how we\num how we care for each other in society\nI think we need that so badly right now\nin our families in our schools and our\nbusinesses and our government bodies we\njust need so much more empathy and\ncompassion\nI love that yeah that's beautiful and\nthere would have to be a special chapter\non having it for yourself too yes yes\nyeah for sure yeah for sure yeah\neveryone the book is called thicker than\nwater I have it right here Kerry\nWashington a memoir make sure you
