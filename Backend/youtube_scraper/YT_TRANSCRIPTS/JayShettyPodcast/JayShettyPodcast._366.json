    "transcript": "meditating has done so much for me like\nmeditation and prayer I think just\nbelieving and having faith in something\nthat is greater than you is is always\nhelpful you know I think it's really\nhard to trust something that you can't\nsee that you can't physically feel or\ntouch but there's also something very\nmagical when you tap into that and\nthere's been moments where my day will\nbe so crazy and I you know this is\nconstantly trying to find time how do we\nreset the mind how do we reprogram and I\njust think to myself even after 10\nminutes of meditation there's another\nversion of me on the other side of that\nthat will be so much better so much\ncapable what part of me can't give\nmyself 10 minutes today so like that\nthat spiritual like tap in and like\nre-centering for me is\nSpecial Sauce"
