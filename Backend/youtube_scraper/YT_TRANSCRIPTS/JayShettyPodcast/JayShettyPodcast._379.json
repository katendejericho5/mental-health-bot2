    "transcript": "if people believed everyone was\nbasically the same then how could you\nhate someone else because to hate\nsomeone else is to hate yourself and I\nthink that we spent a lot of energy in\nsociety celebrating the 0.1 percent that\nmakes us different I think there's a\ngood part of that we call that diversity\nand Heritage and culture but there's a\ndark side of believing that we're like\nall very different and that's that we\nbelieve that people are the other and\nthat therefore it's harder to have\nempathy with somebody who isn't us and I\nthink that the best way to understand\nthat somebody is similar to you is to\nwalk in their shoes"
