one and only Brian\nchesky who's the co-founder and chief\nexecutive officer of Airbnb in 2007\nBrian and Joe gabia became airbnb's\nfirst hosts since then Brian has\noverseen airbnb's growth to become a\ncommunity of over 4 million hosts who\nhave welcomed more than one billion\nguests across 200 plus countries and\nregions Brian is a signatory to the\ngiving pledge and committed to donating\nthe net proceeds of his CEO Equity\ncompensation to community philanthropic\nand charitable causes something that I'm\nso passionate about and so excited to\ndive into Brian welcome to on purpose\nreally excited to be here this is\nawesome I'm truly honored I think\nthere's very few as I was just saying to\nyou offline and I want to repeat what I\nsaid I think it's hard to build\nsomething that matters it's hard to\nscale something that matters\nand it's hard to build and scale\nsomething that matters and keep making\nit matter and you seem to be doing all\nthose things we try every day\ncongratulations it's been a joy watching\nit from afar and I'm excited to build\nthis relationship with you I'm excited\nto talk about this yeah well let's dive\ninto it I want to start off with my\nfirst question which is\nwhat makes you happy today and how does\nit differ from what made you happy 16\nyears ago I think that I'll start with\nwhat I thought would make me happy\nand I'll tell you what does make me\nhappy and how they're different when I\nstarted this company like 15 years ago I\nstarted my co-founders I was totally\nbroke I had no status had no power no\nmoney nothing\nand I felt like what would make me happy\nwas climbing a mountain and becoming\nincredibly successful\nand the challenge is that well what do\nyou do when you get the top of the\nmountain\nyou've achieved it\nand what I've realized is at that at\nthis point like I'm 41 years old\nand a lot of people ask me like why\ndon't you just retire\nlike why don't you or why don't you do\nit all over again\nand for me I would tell them because the\nfun is just starting\nbut the fun of just starting isn't to\nlike get the next billion people\nI kind of think of myself maybe more\nthan a business person you know you're\nyou're kind of who you are growing up\nand I was a designer growing up and I\nkind of think of Airbnb as like one of\nthe world's biggest canvas\nalmost never has a designer been given\nso much responsibility so much\nopportunity and what I love is you know\nlike a musician wants to play music a\npainter wants to paint a builder wants a\nbuild a climber wants a climb\nand as an entrepreneur I want to create\nand connect things and\num and try to like defy the notion of\nwhat a business person could be or what\na designer could be because I never met\nsomeone like me growing up\nand I'm not saying anyone's gonna try to\nbe like me\nbut if I can remind people that there's\nleadership comes in many different faces\nmany different flavors\nand that a creative person you know can\nrun a company and it can run a really\nbig company a Fortune 500 company then\nthat's that's the very beginning and I I\nfeel like\nwhat makes me happy now\nis working with people I love like the\none of the great things about success is\nyou can choose the people you surround\nyourself with\nand I get to like work every single day\nwith people I love\non ideas that I'm obsessed over and I'm\njust so obsessed like I think my\nmotivation's changed I think when I\nstarted my motivation was about myself\nbecoming something\nand once you achieve that your\nmotivation often turns outward it's\nabout it's starting to be about giving\nto other people to letting them\nexperience a small part of what I was\nable to experience and it becomes just\nabout the work\nso when you're not successful you get\nvalidation when people praise you\nbut eventually like you do it for\nyourself that you're not doing it for\nstatus or success because at some point\nyou've gotten all of it like how much\nmore is going to make you happy and so\njust doing things I love of people I\ncare about that's what makes me happy\ntoday that's beautiful that's\nI can see that it's true for you too I I\ncan see that it it's it's real for you\nas you're saying it which is such a\nspecial place to be and it was\ninteresting when you were talking about\nthis idea of climbing a mountain I've\noften thought that\nthere's one journey in life that we take\nthat's upwards up a mountain and then\nthere's another Journey we all have to\ntake that's inwards to the valley\nand that's a journey that not everyone\ngets to take or everyone thinks about\ntaking because we're so busy trying to\nget up that we don't often get to go in\nright and it sounds like you've been\nExcavating that internal part for some\ntime you can learn a lot about yourself\nthrough this journey\nand you're right the biggest Journey\nI've probably\nembarked on is the one inside of myself\nthe brightest days of my life and the\ndarkest days of my life have been in the\nlast 15 years the highs are incredibly\nHigh the lows can be incredibly low the\namount of stress can be unrelenting the\nrewards are like hard to even grapple\nwith\nwhen you go on a journey like this you\nlearn a lot about yourself\nand you start to also learn like what's\nimportant to you starting a company you\nknow one of my First Investors said\nBrian starting companies like jumping\noff a cliff and assembling the airplane\non the way down\nmaybe another way of saying it is like\nplaying a video game and it's like a\nthousand levels and each level gets\nharder and each level you learn\nsomething about yourself you do\nsomething that's uncomfortable in each\nstep of the game you learn something and\nthe problem with success is it tends to\namplify things I mean that can be good\nbut all can still can amplify holes you\nhave in yourself people that are a\nlittle bit paranoid get very paranoid\npeople that are a little deceitful\nbecome like completely fraudulent Liars\npeople that are a little narcissistic\nbecome like\negomaniacs and stuff and so the stuff\ncan tend to amplify Tendencies inside of\nyourself and so if you're afraid of\nconflict that's going to actually\nmanifest in like not actually dealing\nwith things if you can't if you're not\ndecisive there's going to be an element\nof bureaucracy if you're like get\noverwhelmed and you get paralyzed\nthere's going to be an action in the\ncompany and so you learn so much about\nyourself and I through this process I\nprobably learned more about myself than\nI even have about business\nand it's been an incredible journey and\num yeah it's like incredible lessons and\nyour company is like a mirror about you\nright like\nwhen you see a company it's like I walk\nin your house\nand by walking your house I can step a\nlittle bit in your mind because the\nhouse you bought the house you furnished\nthe house you made a thousand decisions\nand it would take a while for me in\nconversation to understand you but I\nwalk in this house and I can understand\nthe Thousand decisions you made\na company is like that but it's like a\nhundred thousand decisions or a million\ndecisions and so by seeing the company\nyou can like see into the person's mind\neverything they do and not even\neverything they do but everyone they\nsurround the self with and the culture\nthey create and the what they and and\nthat's the thing that's like so crazy\nI'm intrigued you said something that\nthat really stood out to me you said\nthat the happiest thing and the best\nthing about being successful is that you\nget to choose the people you worked with\nyou obviously built this with friends\nyeah and that's how it started it\nstarted in a place of being around\npeople you love with what was the\nbiggest point of challenge in building\nsomething with people you love as you\ngrow it and what is it that you\nexperienced and what was the biggest\nlesson that you took away that actually\nkept it going because I can imagine as\nyou're describing highs and lows all of\nthis change for 16 years but here you\nare still building it together think\nabout how many stories you've heard of\nFounders it's like a band They Come\nTogether\nand then eventually the band breaks up\nand people don't stay together they\nresent each other maybe things end very\nugly\nit's like a band except like it becomes\nso much bigger than the band because\nit's not just the three of you imagine a\nband that starts three people and ends\nas three thousand people\nand that amount of pressure the amount\nof Spotlight the money the changes in\nlike people's status and positioning it\ncan do a lot to break people up but also\nunlike a band where maybe not to say you\njust have to agree on like where you\nperform and what you sing with a company\nyou have to agree on like who we're\ngoing to hire what we're going to call\nWhat markets we're going to go into\nwhat's the prioritization like who we're\ngonna raise money for I can go down the\nlist of like the thousands of things you\nhave to agree to and\nwhat Joe Nate and I I often say it's\nreally good to start a company with\nfriends not everyone has friends to\nstart a company with but you want that\nreservoir of Goodwill and we made a\ndecision the decision was that no one\ndecision is going to supersede our\nfriendship in our relationship that\nwe're never going to have well debate\nwill argue but will never allow a\nsituation where winning an argument is\nthe most important thing because if you\nthink about a company as a hundred\nthousand decisions it could also be a\nhundred thousand arguments and if you\nget stuck on the first debate or you\nlike somebody won the debate okay great\nyou have 99 999 more things to discuss\nand so the lesson I learned is I mean\nfirst of all Jay I was lucky\nand a lot of people when I say I was\nlucky they think oh you're at the right\nplace the right time with the right idea\nand I said well maybe\nbut there's something I was much luckier\nabout\nand what I was most lucky about what\nmade me most fortunate was I met Joe and\nNate that we had this unbelievable\nchemistry one time we had to do like\nsome personality tests it's like one of\nthose color wheels and we took this like\npersonality test to see about our\nchemistry and they plotted our like\npersonalities and they formed a perfect\nequilateral triangle not always you're\ngoing to find people that are perfect\ncompliments to you I'd say a couple\nthings number one you want to have a\nteam with people that you are friends\nwith or could see yourself becoming\nfriends with that you have a deep love\nand respect for that you're gonna\nprobably spend more time with your\nco-founders than your spouse your family\nif it goes well if it doesn't go well\nthen maybe not but that's the best case\nscenario that people that have shared\nvalues because you can debate anything\nso long as you're trying to climb the\nsame mountain in the same police system\nif you have different values eventually\nthose are going to become irreconcilable\nconflicts but you probably also want\ncomplementary skills the worst case is\npeople with different values and same\nskills\nright we do the same job we step in each\nother's tolls and we're trying to go in\na different direction and so I think and\nthen I think the final thing is just\nthis mutual love and respect and never\nlosing sight you know one of the things\nI tried to make sure of is like even as\nCEO I wanted to try to make sure that\nlike\nJoe and Nate you know were included in\nthings and we I wanted to always make\nsure that people referred to us together\nwe thought of us as a as a unit when we\nwhen I like went public you write a\nFounder's letter and a lot of people\nwrite letter and they just sign the name\nof the CEO I made sure that it was from\nall of us and was representing all of us\nI feel like they are the heart and the\nsoul of the company and it's like you\nknow parents like you know not every\nchild has the fortune to have multiple\nparents not every company has the\nfortune to have multiple Founders but if\nthey're together they're not fighting\nthey have a mutual love and respect from\nanother that's going to permeate the\ncompany just like it permeates the\nhealth of a child and Jonah and I kind\nof thought ourselves as parents in the\ncompany as a child I'd never have had\nkids but you know there's something\nabout that and I think who you are in\nthat relationship permeates every single\nthing if the founders fight the\nemployees fight if they have respect\nfrom one another that is going to be a\nrole a model that other people\nthroughout the organization are going to\ncopy and that's what I've learned from\nthat I think I think what you're saying\nis very very true and it's remarkable\nthat you've been able to hold on to that\nI mean I remember just comparing it to\nsomething very minuscule but I think a\nlot of people will be able to relate to\nit's like I think with your Bros at\ncollege or at school you'd always be\nlike we're not going to fight over girls\nyeah we're not going to fight over women\nand then they'd always be the guy who\nwho trades the Friendship for for a girl\nand then like the whole thing and that's\na short-term decision yeah and and I\nunderstand why people make short-term\ndecisions they make trade-offs they want\nto win but as long as you think about\nthe Arc of your life and that life is\nonly like who you're with and that you\ndon't want to be alone at the end of\nyour life and you certainly don't be\nalone at the end of The Journey if I'm\nclimbing now and I want friends by my\nside that can like provide a supplies\nwith me and like you know like being the\nonly one in power is actually quite\nlonely having been in that little bit of\nthat position I've now could tell people\nthat you want to share it because\notherwise it's incredibly isolating and\nlonely and you know like if you get all\nthe credit you could also get all the\nblame and it can be very difficult to be\nable to share that with Joe and Nate and\nnow to be able to share that with the\npeople that I get to pick to surround\nmyself with that I mean that is one of\nthe most fulfilling things and you know\ngreat relationships get better with age\nand they give you energy they make you\nbetter they hold your negative\ntendencies in check and they pull out\nlike creative Ambitions in you they see\npotential in you that maybe you don't\nsee in yourself\nI'd never imagined that I could be CEO\nof any company\nI didn't think I'd be CEO of a pizza\nshop\nlet alone BC of a like a\ngiant Fortune 500 company did over 60\nbillion dollars last year in bookings\nlike that's completely crazy\nand I've learned a lot of lessons from\nthis journey\none is I think we all were born with\nlike unknown potential\nand I think the other thing is sometimes\nthe best people in your life\nwill be people who see potential in you\nthat you didn't see in yourself\nand I often wonder like why did Joe and\nthey even agree to like let me be the\nCEO why did Joe\ntell me one day\nin 2007 to pack everything in the back\nof old Honda Civic and drive up to San\nFrancisco why did he think that was a\ngood idea\nand years later he's told me\nand he told me that we went to college\ntogether at RISD and he saw something in\nme and it's possible\nhe saw something in me that I didn't\neven yet see in myself\nand this is like the hero's journey\nsomebody might believe in you they might\nsee something in you and that's what I\ngot with Joe and a and I think I\nbelieved in what I think I saw\nthey saw potential in me what I saw\nmaybe was potential in this idea that if\npeople could experience what we\nexperienced that first weekend when we\nhost three guests\nthat this would be an idea\nthat would spread around the world I\nthink we have an easier time imagining\nliving like this on Mars and living\ndifferently on this planet but which of\nthose two do you think is more likely to\nhappen in the near term it's really hard\nfor us to imagine psychological\nsociological changes we can all imagine\ntechnological changes we can imagine\nthings getting bigger faster but it's\nhard to imagine us living differently\nand I don't think that we were\nVisionaries per se I think we were\nexpeditionaries and I think we\ndiscovered something\none of my First Investors Paul Graham he\nsaid what do you know what what unique\nknowledge do you know that has allowed\nyou afforded you the ability to start\nthis company that no one else has what\ndo you know that no one else understands\nand I think\nthat we discovered something we\ndiscovered that like people are\nfundamentally good you know you read the\nnewspaper I think chief justice Earl\nWarren said I don't turn to the front\npage of the newspaper it's filled with\nman's failures I go to the sports page\nit's filled with man's successes I think\nwe live in an abundance of data\nreinforcing that people aren't good\nand we have probably as much data as\nalmost anyone because in the last 15\nyears one and a half billion people\num have used Airbnb a one and a half\nbillion guest arrivals in nearly every\ncountry in the world\nmore countries I think than Coca-Cola\nnearly the population of valet every\nnight living together\nand it's only reinforced what I think we\nnaively believed in the beginning these\ntwo simple ideas that people are\nbasically good they're 99 the same I\nthink that Joe and Nate believed in me\nand my potential to be this company I\nthink we collectively believe in the\npotential each other and I think also\nthat this idea would be one that could\nspread around the world if only we could\nfigure out how to communicate it to\npeople how special I mean that's\nthat is something that I definitely got\na mini version experience if I just\nfinished uh 40 City World Tour really\nfor my second book and we probably met\nabout 100 000 people on the way almost\nevents\nand much much smaller than the one\nbillion uh bookings but\nI would agree with those two sentiments\nso strongly they were 99 the same\nand people are overall good if people\nbelieved everyone was basically the same\nthen how could you hate someone else\nbecause they hate someone else's to hate\nyourself and I think that we spend a lot\nof energy in society celebrating the 0.1\npercent that makes us different I think\nthere's a good part of that we call that\ndiversity and Heritage and culture but\nthere's a dark side of believing that\nwe're like all very different and that's\nthat we believe that people are the\nother and that therefore it's harder to\nhave empathy with somebody who isn't us\nand I think that the best way to\nunderstand\nthat somebody is similar to you is to\nwalk in their shoes and to like just you\nknow there's an old saying it's hard to\nhate someone up close and I think\nthere's something weird that's happening\nwhere the more digitally connected we\nseem to get the more the less physically\nconnected we sometimes get and I wonder\nif that has a way of like confusing us\nabout people that we might argue about\non the internet no one else no one's\never changed the most Mind YouTube\ncomment section\nbut if it's hard to live with somebody\nor to walk in the shoes and not change\nyour mind how could you not change your\nmind about something because that would\nsuggest that like you've experienced all\nof life up to that point and that you\nfeel your opinions are fully formed and\nthat no new data could ever change your\nmind about anything how could that pause\nhow'd you even have your pins in the\nfirst place\nbased on probably experiences and so how\ncould you not change your experience\nyour opinion by new experiences with new\npeople\nand that's kind of the kind of the\nsimple way we think about it yeah I'm so\nglad you raised this idea of you talked\nabout the incredible friendship that you\nhave with your co-founders but at the\nsame time you brought up this idea of\nloneliness and you said you never want\nto be lonely at the end of a journey you\nnever want to be lonely at the end of\nbuilding something big and I think in\nthe world today we are seeing loneliness\nproliferate and it's the loneliness of\nnot that we're not around people it's\nnot loneliness that we're not surrounded\nby people it's that we're surrounded by\npeople but we don't feel understood we\ndon't feel seen we don't feel heard that\nwe feel that we have to be someone apart\nfrom ourselves even around the people\nthat we're closest to and so the idea of\nloneliness is expanding away people are\nfeeling disconnected from each other yet\nyou're talking about 16 years ago you\nand a bunch of friends feeling so close\nto each other\nwhen have you felt lonely in your life\nand what have been your next thoughts\nand steps that you've taken from that\npoint I think loneliness which is like\nthe darkness or the absence of\nconnection\nand love and connection\nhave in hindsight\nbeen some of the driving forces in my\nentire life\nif I were to think about my journey with\nloneliness\nI think I grew up as a little bit of a\nlonely isolated kid I was interested in\nArt and Design but I also played Sports\nI didn't really feel like I fit in\ngrowing up I um kind of felt like an\noutsider\nI went to the Rhode Island School design\nwhere a lot of people who felt that way\nwould come together even at RISD I\ndidn't feel like I fit in there even as\na hockey player even as a hockey player\nto Art School like kind of like I went\nto like a military like private school\nand then I went to an art college and\nlike I kind of had a foot in each and\nnot fully like like and I would I had\nyou know maybe issues Authority I didn't\nreally fit in\num it turned out to be\na huge benefit to being a tech founder\nbut of course who doesn't want to fit in\nit growing up like so much of our desire\nis to belong because I think to belong\nis a deeply human trait you know we're\ntribal we grew up to be in tribes of\nlike 50 150 people and to not be part of\nthat tribe and not belong in a prior era\nwould be a death sentence and I think\nthat ultimately today we're probably\nliving in one of the loneliest times in\nhuman history if people were as lonely\nin yesteryear as they are today they'd\nprobably perish because like you just\ncouldn't survive without your tribe and\nI think that\nyou know for me I didn't realize that\nthis was a thing that I've been I was\nfighting throughout my life and so when\nI was 25\n20 turning 26 I started my two\nco-founders and we became the family we\nbecame a family that I hadn't had for 10\nyears since I really 10 years since I\nleft the house\nand then suddenly we were a family the\nthree of us and we're just hanging out\ntogether we live together we all like\nwaked up woke up around the same time\naround 8 A.M we'd work till midnight and\nthen we'd do it the whole the next day\nwe go grocery shopping together we'd\nlike go to the gym together it was very\ncommunal then we hired people that were\nbasically our friends we wouldn't hire\nanyone we didn't like and then we didn't\nhave a lot of work life like boundaries\neveryone was young we didn't have\nfamilies we'd go out like drinking\ntogether and hang out together and\ndinner and that became like a family it\nbecame like a community and that was\nincredible and it was this deep rich\nconnection and those were some of the\nclosest friendships I ever had\nbut then something happens we go on a\nrocket ship\nand then I go from being a Founder to a\nCEO\nand I was one of three founders\nand then I became one CEO a Sil an\nindividual role and as I became a CEO I\nstarted leading from the front at the\ntop of the mountain but then you know\nthe higher you get to the peak the fewer\nthe people there are with you and no one\never told me\nhow lonely you would get and I wasn't\nprepared for that and I had this guilt\nabout not working because so much of my\nlife was about being successful probably\nprobably if I were to dig deep because I\nthought that would make people love me\nand that was probably adulation but I\nprobably didn't know it back then and I\nprobably thought that by being\nsuccessful I'd feel really different\nand I remember I got to this point where\nI was already feeling pretty isolated\nand then the pandemic happened and I'm\nliving by myself in a house\nand I'm finding myself on zooms 24 7.\nyou're like 16 18 hours a day\nfor an entire year of 2020. I you know\nhelp with a team we navigate out of a\ncrisis\npeople were predicting we'd like some\npeople were that we would go at our\nbusiness\nwe stare into the abyss and we like got\nin a foxhole we turned the company\naround we took it public\nand the day of our IPO we reached a\nhundred billion dollar valuation and\nremember if you told me like a million\ndollars and more money I ever imagined\ngrowing up my parents are social workers\nI that was like an unfathomable amount\nof money\nand I remember after going public is\nlike oh my God there's this like amazing\nexaltation it was amazing like I'd gone\nto the mountain and then I wake up the\nnext day and my life is exactly the same\nI'm alone I wake up I put on sweatpants\nI go onto iMac and I have like 10 12\nhours of Zoom meetings and I just don't\nreally have much of my like life outside\nof work my work was my life\nand then I remember\nhaving a 40th birthday party\nand I had to make a list of people to\ninvite and never in my life have I tried\nto like make a list of who my friends\nare but when you have to make\ninvitations you have to make a list\nand I made a long list of people\nand then I kind of went down the list\nand I said when's the last time I talked\nto these people\nand I realized that almost every single\nperson in the list if I were to Ping I'd\nhave to catch them up in my life I\ncouldn't just dive into something\nbecause I had not maintained those\nrelationships\nand it was just something that like\nstarted you know and I I started\nnoticing I started feeling more isolated\nI would have more negative ruminations\nand stuff and I didn't know at the time\nthat I was lonely I knew it was isolated\nbut I didn't know that that also meant\nloneliness and I thought I have all\nthese people around me how could I\npossibly feel this way and there were a\ncouple people that like entered my life\nthat like gave me some awareness and\nConsciousness one at the deeply personal\nlevel and one more at the professional\nlevel\nat the personal level\num I ended up actually becoming friends\nand a person who became a mentor to mine\nwas the former president United States\nBarack Obama and it was a kind of a\ncrazy story where I you know I like many\npeople met him in the white house\num and then he um we keep in touch after\nthe White House and he became a bit of a\nmentor to me we developed a relationship\nand initially it was a purely\nprofessional relationship but by 2021\nafter we went public he kind of told me\nI kind of told him what I was feeling\nand I he said I think you're kind of\nlonely and you probably need to renew\nfriendships and he described that he had\nlike these 10 or 15 friends most of them\nhe was friends with before his\npresidency and they kept him grounded\nand rooted and your roots come from your\npast and your past is off in your\nrelationships because I kept asking like\nhow didn't you like lose your mind he's\nlike it's hard to lose your mind when\nyou have deep connections and relations\nto others and this is around the time I\nwas like totally realized I hadn't\nmaintained relationships\nso one of the most important things I\ndecided to do was renew the\nrelationships that were in that invite\nlist those people that I hadn't really\nkept in touch with and so I rekindled\nrelationships with my college friends\nand I committed that we'd take like one\nor two trips a year because the problem\nis if you don't see your friends you\nonly text them the only things you can\ntalk about are like the same old stories\nfrom 20 years ago or you can talk about\nother things in your life but you have\nno shared experience in zoom in phone\ncalls and text messages or not shared\nexperiences you can only talk about an\nexperience you had\nand so I did that with my college\nfriends I did my high school friends I\nspent started spending more time my\nsister and other people in my life I\nended up getting like a dog a golden\nretriever\num named Sophie Supernova in the crazy\nthing Jay is I can tell you like the\nride of Airbnb and having all the\nsuccess and money and power and all this\nstuff it can be amazing I'm not saying\nit's not amazing\nbut I actually think I probably it's\nalmost like I had to go on this entire\njourney to realize I had everything I\nneeded before I even started the journey\nthat the thing that probably gave me the\ngreatest life satisfaction was a thing\nthat I didn't even need money for and I\ndidn't even need to have success to\nachieve relationships many of them I had\nbefore I started you know that as you\nknow I think you had Robert waldinger on\nyour show and you know he um I actually\nmet him last week for the first time he\nis as people listening or probably\nrealized he was a Harvard Professor\nwho's run the longest study in human\nhappiness it started before he was even\nalive it's an 85 year study and the\nquestion was what's the secret to\nhappiness and of course I don't think\nthey thought there was a silver bullet\nanswer and of course it is and it's\nrelationships and I think that that's\nwhat I've learned that like as I've\nreconnected\nI've felt like this light and this love\npermeate me and I think it's made me a\nbetter leader because one of the things\nRobert told me is 50 of CEOs are lonely\nnow somebody listening say oh poor CEOs\nwell I would say I don't think I want\nSociety to be led by a bunch of lonely\npeople exactly I don't want Society to\nbe led by a bunch of lonely people\nbecause lonely people are less trusting\nof other people they're more paranoid\nthey're less resilient they will\ntypically have less empathy because they\nwill push people away I don't think\nthey're as connected they make worse\ndecisions and so we do not live in a\nworld where people are lonely we\nespecially don't want to leave in a\nworld where leaders are lonely and so\nthis has been one of the defining things\nin my life so I think the first part of\nthe answer\nis for me\nto deal with my own sense of isolation\nand loneliness and again Jay I thought\nloneliness was something that like\npeople's grandparents experienced in\ntheir life I didn't think it was\nsomething the young person experiences\nand the other person I met\num is the now and former certain General\nUnited States Dr Beck Murphy we hired\nhim during the pandemic because a lot of\npeople were afraid to like you know\num go into airbnbs and they were worried\nabout like germs on surfaces and so we\nhired him to do this like you know\nbasically create cleaning and sanitation\nprotocols but I remember having a\nconversation with him\nand he said something to me he said\nBrian do you know what the number one\nkiller in America is I'm kind of\nparaphrasing on conversation and I said\nI don't know is it like heart disease is\nit cancer and he goes no the number one\nkiller in America is loneliness and I\nsaid loneliness what are you talking\nabout\nand he said yeah being chronically\nlonely is worse for your health than\nsmoking a pack of cigarettes a day and\ncan take 15 years off your life and not\nonly that but about half of Americans\nare lonely\num two out of three teenagers by some\nstudies are lonely and it's not just\nthat they're lonely it's that this is\nleading to\na lot of mental health issues you know\none in four teenagers have suicidal\nideations you know that's not just\nteenagers you see like you know like\nthere's a crisis with men and boys\nthere's a crisis with like one in three\nseniors or lonely this is like so I\nstarted realizing this is like a really\nbig crisis it's it may be a way to say\nit's a crisis a disconnection\nand I started realizing like you know\nglobal warming maybe you could say\nthat's disconnection with the Earth\nand that loneliness is disconnection\nfrom each other and maybe loneliness at\nthe most fundamental level starts with\ndisconnection from yourself that you're\nrunning away from something and that\nsometimes trying to be successful and\nclimbing a mountain is running away from\nsomething you know because you think\nthat what you are isn't enough and if\nyou become more you'll be you'll become\nsomething and that is the problem\nbecause of course we never fully leave\nour history and our psychology and so\nthen I started learning about loneliness\nat the intellectual level and started\nasking well Airbnb is a global Community\nwe have hundreds of millions of people\nsome of the best ways to connect with\nother people are through travel I was\nusing travel and Airbnb to like connect\nwith my friends because most of them\ndidn't live in the same city as me I\nstarted realizing you know you get to my\nage of 41 you have a public company you\nhave a couple choices you can just stop\nand say like retire you can do something\nnew or you can just say my work is just\ngetting started and for me like I wanna\nof course I want to like keep getting a\nreturn for shareholders and make sure\nlike if people give me money they feel\nlike it was a good decision if employees\nput their trust in me was a good career\ndecision and and I I want all that to\nhappen but that can't be enough that\nthere's got to be something more the\nartist to me the designer me wants to\nsolve a problem the problem can't just\nbe a stock price it's got to be\nsomething greater and I have like the\none of the biggest canvases in the world\nof any designer ever and what I would\ndesign is not products I will Design\nconnections between people and so I\nstarted learning about loneliness I\nstarted realizing that Modern Life seems\nto be making people lonely and there's\nall sorts of theories maybe it's that\nlike you know everything is digitized\nnow the mall is now Amazon the theater\nis now Netflix the grocery store is now\ninstacart the office is now zoom and I'm\na proponent of all these things I use\nall these servers and I love them but\nyou know the problem is it's like\ningredients\nwe evolved I think to be in physical\nproximity to one another and as we spend\nmore time online we seem to be spending\nless time together and I think we have\nto be very very careful Society what\nkind of future we want to design for\nourselves so I guess for me loneliness\nin its solution which is reconnection\nhas been both a personal mission and now\na bit of a professional Mission and a\nproduct or a service can't help with\nthat but a community can\nand if Airbnb can go from a travel\nservice to a travel community\nif we can be in the business of trust\nwhere you understand one another and we\ncan help you connect with people in your\nlife or meet other people that to me\nwould be where the next chapter is and\nthere's something about like solving\nyour own problem then wanting to like\nyou know trying to spread it to others\nis I think one of the most fulfilling\nthings they always say the best way to\nstart a business to solve your own\nproblem and I think that's what I've\nbeen trying to do thank you for coming\nto my TED Talk\nthat was a master class on loneliness uh\nand I mean that and it's beautiful to\nsee how it can so deeply correlate with\nwhat you've already built and I think\nthat's what as I'm watching you and as\npeople are listening and watching I want\nyou to take this away that\nyou're not neglecting or negating any\nexperience you've had you're actually\ncollecting they're awesome and bringing\nthem all together and saying look\nactually it's additive I think a lot of\nus have this tendency in the material\nworld to build something go ah it wasn't\nit throw it away and then go try and\nbuild something else and actually what\nyou're saying actually I built this\nthing it's great but actually it could\nbe so much better and it's just the\nbeginning exactly and I also think that\nlike I'm not saying it never would have\nmattered and don't try to be a tech\nfounder and don't try to achieve success\nI'm just saying they're ingredients yes\nand that if you do it alone and you\ndon't have relationships and you do\nsomething to fill something in you it's\nnot going to fully do that but if you do\nit because you love it and you get to do\nwith people you love and you can do it\nout of a sense of gratitude and giving\nto other people you know Steve Jobs one\nof my heroes used to say\num I get to work now with Johnny Ive he\nstarted a firm called love from love\nfrom me to you and that was the theory\nthat Steve said the Steve said the best\nway to show you your love for the\nspecies is to put your heart and soul\ninto something and give them to them\nSteve said the design is a fundamental\nSoul the man-made creation that reveals\na self-see subsequent layers and I think\nthat ultimately my motivation has gone\nfrom\num more extrinsic to more intrinsic that\nat this point in my life I'm less\nworried about what people think I don't\nreally feel like I have to prove\nanything people either I already have or\nI never will at some point and I think\nat some point it just becomes about the\nthing I just want to do the thing to the\npurest best of my ability and to feel\nlike I give to others and this is the\nother thing it's amazing to be able to\nbuy things and have things those\nexperiences are awesome but\nthe things that probably give me most\nJoy is like sharing things with others\nor giving things I totally get now I\nnever understood like why people like\ngiving away things I didn't really\nunderstand it it was not intuitive to\nmake Roman up I was parents of social\nwork I was kind of middle class and now\nI realize there's I don't say a\nselfishness to it but you get something\nyou get something from giving it's not\njust this moral obligation you actually\nget something and when you get is this\nsense of love and connection by giving\nsomething by giving love you kind of get\nit back in return\nand I think ultimately like\nI think me as a i as a leader I never\nsaw something like me growing up like I\nwent to design school and like no there\nwas this weird thing Jay where I get to\nristy the Ronald School design and\nthere's an obsession about getting\ndesigned in the boardroom and Joe and I\nwere like so like audacious we thought\nwhy should design be in the board we can\nrun the boardroom but of course like\ndesigners that people never thought\nstarted companies\nand there's an old saying art is a\nquestion of the problem of the world and\ndesign is the answer and Joe and I\nwanted to seek answers to problems in\nthe world and one answer was we can't\npay rent so we created this thing called\nair bed and breakfast air beds instead\nof beds for air bed and breakfast and\nBut ultimately you know I think a\nbusiness person I am a business person\nostensibly but I think a business\nperson's goal is to make money in a\ndesigner's goal is to solve a problem\nand of course I'm doing both I probably\nsit at the intersection but I don't get\nout of bed every day to make money I get\na bet every day to like design something\namazing and of course I can pay money I\ncan fund it and that's just a kind of\nmotivation and that probably can keep me\ngoing for a really really long time and\nI find that a lot of companies\nthey get really cold as they get big\nthat you start something for love you're\nthe customer you talk to the customers\nand at some point the company grows and\nyou start with The Head and the Heart\nyou like putting your love into it\nyou're intuitive no startup is data\noriented because there is no data if you\nhave an idea there is no data so you go\noff your intuition you do something\nbecause you believe in it and then at\nsome point you get so big the company\ngets financialized there's a lot more\ndata and you start making decisions with\na heart and now with the head and one\nside of your head and you look at the\nFortune 500 how many CEOs in the Fortune\n500 are truly like have any creative\nbackground whatsoever identifies\ncreatives almost none okay how many\nboards there's 12 members an average of\na Fortune 500 board that's like probably\n6 000 member so the 4500 how many boards\nhave like creative people not not many\nhow many executive teams have it and so\nI guess the question is like there's\nnothing wrong with the scientific method\nthere's nothing wrong it's great but we\nneed to we talk about diversity a lot in\nCorporate America there's a type of\ndiversity we need a diversity of artists\nand scientists of head and heart you\nneed all those things to solve the\nbiggest problems today and if Airbnb\ncould be viewed as like a design driven\ncompany like the world's biggest RISD\nproject that just never stopped you know\na company with like a sense of a spirit\na a sense you know our logo is like an\ninverted heart it was meant to be this\nidea almost of this like\nBeating Heart like this lifeblood that\nwould flow through the community and I'm\nnot saying we do all that that might be\nan ideal that we've never gotten to but\nyou can but we can or will die trying\nyeah you've sparked a lot of thoughts\nfrom me that I'd love to share with you\nthat you've reminded me of so many\nthings my mind is connecting so many\ndots with what you're sharing the first\nthing that came to mind is\nit's really great there's a beautiful\nstatement by Paul tillich who's a writer\nwho said that it's fascinating that\nthere are two words in the English\nlanguage for being alone yet we only use\none of them and he said the two words\nare loneliness which is the word we use\nand the other is Solitude Oh yeah and\nwhen you said we're disconnected from\nthe earth we're disconnected from each\nother but really we're disconnected from\nourselves it's because of a lack of\nsolitude yes when I lived as a monk\nbeing comfortable being alone was the\nfirst lesson of the day wow because the\nidea was that and how do you learn how\nto do that well there's there's many\ntechniques one of the first techniques\nis if you just sit with yourself for\nlong enough\nyou start to see so much in yourself\nthat what you connect back to what you\nsaid at the beginning if you're able to\nexplore and take an expedition into the\ndarkest parts of yourself if you're able\nto go into the inner sky and extrapolate\nall of the feelings the messages the\nemotions the things you like the things\nyou don't like now when you say opposite\nanother human you can see the complexity\nand the Simplicity of them as well the\nchallenges we've never looked at our own\nDarkness there's a great um one of the\nlate a great mythologists to the 20th\ncentury you probably know is Joseph\nCampbell of course I hear this great\nquote the cave you fear to enter lies\nthe treasure that you seek and I think\nthat so many of the things we do in life\nare to run away from things to avoid\nopening that closet to see what that\nmonster is but that's where the treasure\nis exactly and so being trained to sit\nwith that monster with the discomfort of\nwhat that actually looks and feels like\nand what you were just saying now about\nthis heart in this head or the design\nand the art and the creative and the\nentrepreneurial I think it's so powerful\nbecause so you mentioned Steve is a is a\nhero of yours same with me I feel like\nI've studied everything he's ever said\nor written and one of the things I loved\nthis was an interview that Mark\nZuckerberg was doing with Prime Minister\nModi from India and he said this on\nstage to Modi I believe this was in San\nFran and Mark said to him he said when\nhe was struggling with the direction of\nFacebook now meta in 2009 which is five\nyears old Facebook is right he went to\nhis mentors Mentor having to be Steve\nJobs and he said to Steve he said what\ndo I do I'm struggling I don't know\nwhich direction Facebook should go in\nnow if you think about 2009 Steve Jobs\nis undoubtedly one of the most connected\nhumans on the planet has access to money\nTech everything you could possibly ask\nfor\nand Steve says to him I want you to go\nand live in an ashram in India wow for I\nwant you to go live then I promise you\nif you go there you'll figure out the\ndirection of Facebook and Mark said he\nactually went to that Monastery that\nashram and he said in the ashram that's\nwhere he decided that at that time\nFacebook was about connecting people oh\nwow and what are that stories yeah and\nwhat I find fascinating the reason why I\nlike to share that story is I'm always\nfascinated by what a tech entrepreneur\nthinks as much as what I'm fascinated\nwhat a monk thinks because it's that\ncross-pollination it's that extreme of\ndiverse thought where those two things\ndon't Collide they don't have the same\nagenda we're not living in an echo\nchamber when you're talking to an artist\nand an entrepreneur there's no Echo\nchamber you've broken it open now and so\nfor me mit did a study on that where\nthey found that the most Innovative\nemployees inside an organization were\npeople who didn't know people who knew\nthe same people there were people who\nknew people who had random connections\nso their Network chart was completely\nuncorrelated whereas people people who\nhad networks who were correlated were\nless likely to be creative and\nentrepreneur unknown discoveries and I I\nfeel like in my own life like Steve has\na saying you can't connect the dots\nlooking forward you can only connect\nthem looking backwards I grew up playing\nice hockey I played team sports I went\nto a military High School uh design\nCollege where I first studied Fine Art\nthen design then I went to MIT for a\nsemester we had a cross enrollment\nproduct development program then I went\nto Los Angeles as in a designer at a\nfirm then I went to Silicon Valley with\nvery little and like got thrust into the\ntechnology industry and it turns out\nthat like I did not know how any of\nthese experiences would add up together\nand they all came to me and every single\none of them have used every single\nexperience but I could never have\nreversed engineered how to get there\nand it is amazing that like you know\nSteve used to say the best Engineers\nwere also poets\nand he was really saying that like\ncreativity is about connecting dots it's\nabout having disparate experiences and\nbringing them together and if you\nhaven't had a lot of different\nexperiences if you aren't very\nmulti-disciplinary you're not going to\nbe able I mean Einstein was like a\nviolinist right I think a lot of the\ngreatest scientists have Leaps of the\nimagination they're not just using\nempirical information and a lot of the\ngreatest artists they have an organized\nMinds sometimes they have a fascination\nwith numbers and you know so you start\nto you start to bring things together\nand I think that is exactly what we\nprobably need in this world I mean we\nneed more creativity you know whenever\nyou see two bad options you don't like\nit the right answer is the third option\nthe third option is one you haven't come\nup with yet that requires novel\nInnovative imaginative thinking where\ndoes it even come from where does\ncreativity come from if creativity you\nknow what I don't know if Einstein ever\nsaid this but there's a quote attributed\nto him that is that logic can take you\nto from A to Z but imagination can take\nyou anywhere I love that quote don't\nknow if you said it but I believe it but\nwhere does that come from where does\nimagination and creativity come from I\nthink comes from a sense of openness it\ncomes from Curiosity it comes from maybe\nnot first following your passion but\nfollowing your curiosity with a deep\nintensity and being curious about so\nmany different things and trusting that\nyou can be curious about something and\nlearn about something not knowing if\nwill ever be useful and have the trust\nto say that every single thing you'll do\nin your life you'll do with accumulation\nof every single experience you've had\nbefore and that the more places you've\ngone the more people you meet the more\nthings you learn it will all come to you\nand you might not know ahead of time how\nit will be useful and honestly if I\nhadn't gone to military school I\nprobably wouldn't have been so organized\nif I didn't go to design school we\nprobably wouldn't have been as creative\nand Innovative in our thinking if I\nhadn't played team sports I probably\nwouldn't have understood about\ncamaraderie if my parents are social\nworkers I don't know I would have had\nthis focus on service and connecting\npeople and I could never have imagined\nany of those things being useful because\ngrowing up I didn't know what I wanted\nto be I wasn't athletic enough to be a\nfamous athlete I was enhanced enough to\nbe an actor I wasn't going to sing her\nto be a musician I did not think I was\ngoing to be an astronaut politician and\nso I'm like I don't know who I'm going\nto be I don't know what I am\nand like the word entrepreneur was a\nword I'm not even sure I heard of\ngrowing up it was like to me it was an\nobscure French term I didn't know what\nit meant and\nI saw Walt Disney as a kid on television\nI thought one day I'll work for him not\nthinking I would start a company just\nlike him and I never imagined that was\npossible I guess we're all born with\nunknown potential as I said before but\nit you have to live experiences as many\nas you can you put them together and I\nhope my story inspires people not for\nthe remarkableness of it but the\nordinariness of who I was before\nto say that like if I joined the\nfinancial giving pledge if you ask my\nteachers in high school to predict which\nof their students would be a signatory\nthe giving pledge I do not think I would\nhave been the top of their list I don't\nthink that takes anything away from the\nteachers I think it just means that\nmaybe that potential is in so many of us\nand it's also maybe a little bit random\nand anything is possible and you like\nthe story you tell yourself might not be\naccurate and I I hope that my story\ninspires people\nfrom the ordinariness of where it came\nfrom that I was just like everyone else\nbut like you know a hundred thousand\ndecisions later with enough resilience\ncreativity Crossing determination\nyou wake up one day you're like oh my\ngod look where I am now what I really\nvalue about that perspective is\nas you were defining creativity in so\nmany brilliant ways one thing that came\nto my mind was\ncreativity is being able to connect the\ndots where everyone else sees anomalies\nyes and so if you look at your journey\njust as a series of random dots they're\nall anomalies social working hockey\nplayer design student like they're just\nrandom things but you're able to\nactually paint this tapestry where\nyou're going well actually everything\nthat I do today and I've I've often felt\nthat in my own life that I lived as a\nkid growing up in London my favorite\nsubjects at school were Art and Design\nphilosophy and economics those are my\nfavorite things in the world spent my\nentire life being immersed in that world\nwhen traded it in to go to Cass business\nschool to study management science for\nthe focus on Behavioral Science because\nI thought it gave me a career only to\ngive it all up the safe job to go live\nas a mom right to then come back to the\nreal world go back into the world of\nbusiness because I just had to pay the\nbills and survive went into Consulting\nthen came out and do media now and I\ncompletely agree with everything you've\njust said probably the thing that makes\nyou so unique is like you were a monk\nand you are an entrepreneur and you\nlived in London and you lived in New\nYork and like the accumulation of all\nthose experiences together correct it's\nthe end is made is made you who you are\nnot one of them but all of them and I\nthink that like the one advice I would\ngive my college self is to try more\nthings and have more experiences and\ndon't seek status and part of the reason\nwhy one should not seek status is\nbecause we can't even predict what\nindustries will be around the future\nlike growing up status to me was like\num I don't know it was like being an\ninvestment banker or something or\nsomething I don't know it was like\nfields that may not even totally exist\nin their current form in the future so\nyou know I like to say like you should\ndo things your gut up you tend to be\ngood at things you're interested in you\nshould seek out whatever you're curious\nabout whatever you're interested in and\nthen you want to get to the front a\nfrontier in some way at some point\nyou'll learn everything and you'll get\nto the edge of all that's known about\nthat subject and that is an\nuncomfortable period where you spear off\nthe ledge of a cliff and that is where\nyou enter a frontier and if you can then\npure of the edge of cliff and then get a\nlittle bit further and extend our\nunderstanding give us a little bit more\nland\nthat is how you like add to Steve Jobs\nsaid that's how you give your love back\nto the species and create something for\nother people and I think I think it's\namazing that like anyone can do that you\nknow you can do it because anyone can do\nit at any scale you know and you can do\nit in your humble way like on the side\nsomething small or you can do it in a\nreally big way but it feels the same no\nmatter what the scale you\nknow you'd say to your younger self\nif you met your younger self now let's\ndo this exercise\nwhat do you think your younger self\nwould say to you what would it be proud\nof and what would your younger self say\nwe need to reconnect with this the first\nthing my younger self would say is oh my\nGod how did you do all this\nand I would be totally perplexed\nwhen I started me my friends I said this\nwill be huge one day thousands of people\nwill do this\nlike that was my my sense of what was\npossible it's hard to dream of something\nyou've never been exposed to and it's\nhard to imagine becoming something when\nyou didn't have any data that you could\never do anything like that in your past\nand so I do not think\nmy younger self let's say my my college\nself\ndid not think I could run like a\nFortune 500 company you know\nyou know for every 1 500 spent in the\nworld one dollar spent on Airbnb did I\nthink I could lead an organization\nthat's facilitating on no I did not\nthink of it and so that would be\nprobably the thing I would be like\nsurprised in a very positive way\nbut the other thing I would probably say\nas well\nI'm 41 years old\nand I live alone then I probably thought\nby now\nI would have a family and I've always\nwanted to have one\nand I think that for all the like\nattention adulation I get I think I\nwould have maybe looked at my life now\nor my recent life\nand identified a little bit of\nisolation\nand I think the lesson is the couple\nthings one I think that things have\nhappened in a different order than I\nimagined it's hard to predict I thought\nI wouldn't I didn't think I'd be this\nfar along in a career and I probably\nthink I probably thought I'd be further\nalong and have something different in my\npersonal life and I also would probably\nI would hope the college me would tell\nmyself now\nyou don't have to keep proving something\nto anyone\nbecause you've proven more to me than I\never thought was possible\nand I think that like part of me and\nthis is probably true of a lot of people\nwe have this tape Loop of like whatever\nwe thought of ourselves as a child like\nit's just Frozen in times repeating\nourselves and you just compulsively just\nkeep doing something and like many\npeople have addictions and I probably\nhad one that would probably work\nand um and I think I'd have to I would\nhope my child itself would or my younger\nself would remind me that you know maybe\nthere'd be a wisdom that like the\nhappiest periods of my life were with\nother people thank you for that thank\nyou for opening up and going there and I\nfelt that what is a thought that you say\nyou have too often I wonder what they'll\nthink speaking of Dr waldinger Robert I\nlove her yeah he's a good friend good I\nmet him last week for the first time and\nyou've had him on your show right yeah\nwe've spent a lot of time together I\nlove him something he told me last week\nthat really stood out to me said one of\nthe biggest regrets that people have in\ntheir life\nis having lived their lives worrying\nwhat other people think and I kind of\nunderstand why like from a like\nevolutionary standpoint like you kind of\nhave to care people think because you\nhave to fit in and if you don't fit in\nyou don't belong you're isolated if\nyou're isolated to death sentence when\nthere's the only thing you have is the\nvillage but it turns out that like that\nis not true anymore that like it's okay\nto be misunderstood\nand that it doesn't maybe it doesn't\nmatter what people think or maybe it\ndoesn't matter what they think today\nand that's some of the greatest things\nI've ever done I was at least\ntemporarily misunderstood\nand maybe it only matters what a few\npeople think\nand maybe just maybe\nthe person that most matters what I what\nthey think is yourself right that you\njust listen to your own voice not other\nvoices\nand I I think if I can do that you know\nartists are called the Artistic\nintegrity right you had Rick Rubin on\nthe show he talks about like the best\nway to make a popular song is to make\nsomething you like and that's about it\nnot make something for somebody else\nand um\nand that's that's something I I have to\ncontinue to do okay and the crazy thing\nis the more success you get the more you\nstart kind of performing for an audience\nand you have to be very careful\nabout performing for and appeasing an\naudience and once you become something\npeople expect you to be that thing\nyou know imagine like you happen to be\nsomething forever but what if you change\nwhat if you grow what if you want to do\ndifferent things and that's a challenge\nI have right the Airbnb brand means\nsomething I need to be careful about\nchanging that brand it stands for\nsomething and yet\nI as a person am not meant to be the\nsame person every year I mean how could\nI be I learn I grow I change I have new\nexperiences and so having the permission\nto continue to change and evolve and not\nbe so self-conscious about what what\npeople think that's something that I\nalways struggle with because I know part\nof me I think I'm like a people pleaser\nand one of my challenges historical EB\nis like some people like I'm like I\ndon't always like interpersonal conflict\nI like to appease people make them happy\nand that's got a good side and it also\ncan be a bit of a prison over time and\nthe bigger you get the the higher the\nwalls get I want to just point out\nsomething you said that was so subtle\nbut so powerful for everyone who's\nlistening and watching I've never heard\nit put that way but the idea that\nwe often think it doesn't matter what\npeople think and you said it doesn't\nmatter what they think today and and\nthat was so subtle but so powerful\nbecause I think when we live in a world\nwe're like oh it doesn't matter what\nanyone else thinks it's it can be\nnegligent but the idea that it doesn't\nmatter what they think today about what\nI'm thinking and thank God yeah thank\nGod you know why when I when we first\ncame by the idea one of my First\nInvestors said don't worry about people\nstealing your idea if it's any good\neveryone will dismiss it we tend to\nbelieve things were good in hindsight\nsome of the most revolutionary people\nand ideas were revolutionary because\nthey're misunderstood in their time\nthat if you have to be at some point in\nyour life willing to be misunderstood\nand the Solitude you can have are two\nthings I think number one to not be so\nattached to it to realize that\nultimately you can't predict the outcome\njust do what you believe follow your\nheart and if it's true whatever has\nhappened is meant to be but the other\nthing you can do is to escape into the\nfuture to say to have this vid we call\nthe vision for a reason you've\nenvisioned something that people don't\nsee yet and say I'm willing to be\nmisunderstood to try to follow this\nthing and if I believe it enough\neventually\nother people might see it and if you are\nable to be misunderstood just for a\nlittle bit\nthat's what it feels like to truly\nrevolutionize something and change\nsomething there's a beautiful statement\nwhich is probably my favorite which\nyou've just encapsulated so well it's\nfrom Charles Holton Cooley he wrote it\nin\n1896 or something like that so he said\nthis early and when you hear it you're\nlike wow that was said yesterday he said\nthe challenge today is I'm not what I\nthink I am I'm not what you think I am\nI am what I think you think I am oh and\nhe said we live in this perception of a\nperception of ourselves so we don't even\nknow what we look like we we are who we\nthink other people think we are and\nthat's twice removed from yourself and\nthat distance we create from our\nunderstanding of ourselves versus what\nwe think someone thinks of us totally\nhow will you ever know what what do you\nthink is something you are still trying\nto understand about yourself or if you\nthink you misunderstand a part of who\nBrian is what are you still trying to\nunderstand I think that we tend to have\nan outdated image of ourselves and that\nmakes sense right like think about I'm\n41 years old so my image of myself is\nthe average of the last 41 years and if\nthe average last 41 years the median is\n20 years old\nand so I still see myself a little bit\nlike that person\nand people's most people see me today\nand a lot of people are gonna see me for\nthe first time right now and that's\ntheir impression and that's a Delta and\nI often wonder like\nsometimes I you know I probably have had\na little bit of imposter syndrome like\nwhat do people see in me and why do they\nfollow me and like I because they do\nlike at some point you're a leader and\nyou're a leader because people choose to\nfollow you and you don't like impose\nyourself on them they ultimately believe\nin something\nand I think I'm\nstill trying to like maybe come to terms\nwith that like what does this all mean I\nthink I'm still trying to understand\nwhat will make me happy especially at a\npersonal level I think I've found what\nwill make me happy at a professional\nlevel\num I I was really lucky that I\ndiscovered something that I love very\nearly on I found a perfect harmony\nbetween what I was good at what I loved\nand what kind of society valued and\nthose things just clicked into place and\nI was able to find it\nbut I think I've been on a lot longer\njourney to figure out like\nwhat\nwill make me happy like in a larger\nsense of the word\nand it turns out that\nsuccess and status to some extent have\nbenefits and you know but it's not it's\ncertainly to say it's not everything's\nan understatement\nI think I'm still trying to\nI'm still trying to learn that and maybe\nI'm trying to figure out\nyou know at this age with so much so\nmany resources like I almost feel like\nin a way my life's just beginning\nso it's just beginning then\nwhen I can't connect the dots looking\nforward it's a discovery of who am I and\nwho am I meant to become like is this my\nstory or is this is this the end of this\nthe middle of the story the beginning of\nthe story\nand what am I meant to do next\nand I'm I'm kind of learning a lot more\nabout myself every year that's a\nbrilliant mindset that's that's so\nempowering and I'm hoping for everyone\nwho's listening and watching that is so\nphenomenal to hear from you because\nthat is the Journey of life like the\nquestions you just laid out like if you\nweren't asking those questions how\nboring would life be like how\nunmeaningful and unfulfilling would it\nbe and the fact that you're asking those\nquestions at this point maybe one other\nthings oh of course you can add whatever\nyou want so over a year ago it was\nFebruary Russia Invader Ukraine we got\nword that there would be like millions\nof refugees\nand when this broke out I remember my\nco-founder Joe\ncalling me up and him telling me\nsomething\nhe said when a crisis at a scale happens\nwe should ask ourselves one question\nand that question is how can we help and\nI always wanted to believe that if I was\nlike a CEO during World War II I would\nhave like been helpful\nand I want I always try to use that's\nthe other device I use I try to think\nabout how I'll be viewed in the future\nbut I also want to I always think in a\ncry how do I want to be remembered even\nif no one will remember me and I think\nanyone can do that how do you want to be\nremembered by history even if it's just\na intellectual device because maybe not\na lot of people remember that's okay but\nlive your life as if you be remembered\nand what I realized\nis one of the most important things and\nthen we ended up helping provide housing\nfor over 100 000 refugees and it was an\nincredible team effort but it came from\nthis basic idea of how can I help\nand maybe that is the other version of\nmy question of my life at this point you\nknow how can I help with everything I\nhave that I mean I've I've hired some of\nthe most talented people in the world we\nhave enormous amounts of resources we\nhave this incredibly advanced technology\nI have this pretty big megaphone\nwhat do I do with that\nand I I hope that what I do provides me\nhappiness and I've noticed that the\nthings that make me happy are like kind\nof helping and giving others I don't\nmean to sound cliche but like you start\nto realize like what provides happiness\nand value for you and so that's kind of\nsomething that I keep thinking about and\nthat's what I love about like\nentrepreneurship and creativity and\ndesign is you make something maybe\ninitially for yourself but then for\nother people and the real Joy is seeing\nthem use it absolutely I think uh I was\nreally fortunate when I when I lived as\na monk service was trained as the\nhighest ACT\nservice was like imprinted in us as the\nhighest act that the act of giving the\nact of serving others interesting yeah\nand it was so counter-intuitive to\neverything I'd learned growing up in\nLondon because it was always about\ngetting and achieving and giving and\nserving were never part of even our\nvocabulary let alone being a part of\nlife\nand I realized now when I see that today\nthat when everyone when anyone gets to a\npoint of getting everything all they can\ndo is give it away yes in the right in a\nway that fuels them to a mission that is\naligned with their purpose not just not\njust you know wherever it goes exactly\nbut in a meaningful way\nyou talked a bit about which I loved\nabout the\nyou know the youngest of saying back to\nyou that you know you thought that\nthings would happen in a different order\nyeah totally when you think about that\nbeing single or being in in your words\nlike being lonely\nyou're such a mastermind at so many\nthings what's the thought that blocks\nthat what's the worry that comes up the\nanxiety that stops you from\nmasterminding that part of your life\nI've been able to look inside myself to\nknow a number of things I think that I\ngrew up\nfeeling a little bit like an outsider I\nwanted to feel like anyone like I belong\nand I found through achievement\nthat you know I would feel these\nfeelings that I thought were like love\nand and I would feel better you know and\nall that and I think it's this\nincredible and positive to a point but\nif you're not careful\nit can become all-consuming and the\nthing about a tech company or start a\nstartup is like it's like imagine you\nyou like again you have a three-person\nband that's now thirty thousand percent\nBanner you know or three million person\nit just it there's always more you can\ndo it can if you're not careful become\nlike a one-dimensional addiction\nand I think that it's like the thing\nthat made me successful was my singular\nFocus\nbut I have to be careful\nthat the thing that could then turn\nagainst me\nis my singular focus and so I think it's\nlike what I the way to live my life in\nthe next 20 years can't exactly be what\nI did my last 20 years the last one\nyears worked out pretty well so why\nwould I do anything differently but of\ncourse if I don't do anything\ndifferently that'll be 50 or 60 and\nnothing will have changed and so I think\nit's really about like\nseeking Community the word community\nmeans Harmony to live in harmony in\nbalance and and having that and so I\nthink it's just old habits and habits\nthat been rewarded so but you got to be\nvery careful about those habits\nI think that I think that's what it is\nand I also just\nyeah I don't know what do you think when\nI listen to you\nand being with you for the time that\nwe're spending together and obviously\nit's the first time we've met yeah\nyou're someone who has extreme clarity\nabout what you want who you are what\nyou're working on what you're struggling\non and my question would be well my\nhypothesis is does that Clarity exist\naround what you want in the personal\nspace I think that's a big Insight yeah\nand maybe that's what I'm still trying\nto discover yeah I would say that you\nsound so clear yeah that if you actually\nadd Clarity then I don't think it would\nbe hard yeah it's hard to have Clarity\nthat's the hard the hardest experience\nthat's a good point and so when you have\nClarity it'll be so much more easier for\nyou to create you can't create something\nif you don't have Clarity that's a great\npoint and so that would be my yeah I\nlove that and that's what I was going to\nask you my what at least are those\nsprinklings of those Clues let's let's\ngo with that word what is what are the\nclues of what you think could develop\ninto Clarity around what you're looking\nfor in a personal way you've talked\nabout so prolifically about what you\nwant professionally which is this using\nAirbnb as this phenomenal platform to\nbuild community and connect people and\nyou know eradicate loneliness which I\nlove like I love that that's phenomenal\nClarity and it's so inspiring and I\ncould get behind that today right like\nthat's so what do you need to get behind\nyourself in the personal space I feel\nlike I'm professionally like a 60 year\nold and a 41 year old's body and\npersonally like a 25 year old and 41\nyear old's body because I'm like I have\na foot in the future and foot in the\npast or like I'm in totally different\ntime skills professionally and\npersonally and it kind of makes sense\nright where I am\na whole bunch of my life maybe was a\nlittle more on hold or done in a\ndifferent order than I imagined so the\nquestion is like\nhow do I get clarity when I started\nAirbnb before before we started Airbnb I\ndidn't know I wanted to start a tech\ncompany and I wanted to be like about\nbringing helping bring people together\nand I was going to start with these two\npeople and I was going to be a\ntechnology founder and I was going to\nmarry Art and Science and do all this\nstuff I couldn't have known any of that\nbut there were some things I did\nprofessionally that are probably Clues\nto what should be done personally the\nfirst thing is I had endless curiosity\nI had Role Models Heroes people I looked\nup to and you know both you know\nwell-known people and lesser-known\npeople I had an intense curiosity\nI was drawn to certain types of people\num and I had action you know it's like\nif you can't follow your passion you\nfollow your curiosity where does it take\nyou and you know like you're not going\nto start a company by like never like\nstarting and you're not going to build a\npersonal life you're you want by not\nstarting either and so you just go on\nthat journey and you you will you will I\nthink you will find what you want if you\nstart and you keep moving yeah that's\nwhat's right something like that I'm\nexcited to see you\nyou know I'm excited to hear about how\nyou\ntake that short Moment of clarity that\nwe've gained into the future because no\nit's great I really I really really feel\nthat you've found in your life that\nyou've always been exactly where you're\nmeant to be not in the luck sense like\nyou said of the right timing right but\nthat each one of your experiences\ntotally has made you make better\ndecisions and I think that maybe the the\nlike exciting thing is like what if I\ncan't connect the dots looking forward\nbut I will realize in hindsight wow\neverything just fell into place like\nthis thing led to that thing led to that\nthing yeah and that would be fun it'd be\nfun to check in in a handful of years\nand see what played out yeah yeah\ndefinitely definitely and it's so it's\nso interesting that you keep quoting\nthis I've never met someone who loves\nquotes as much as I do so it's uh it's\nfun hearing them back from you and how\nthey played out in your life what what\nif anything today apart from everything\nwe've talked about we've talked about so\nmany things what if anything today keeps\nyou up at night\nor do you sleep really well I don't know\nif I sleep that well and I not to use\nanother quote but Pablo Casa had a\nsaying the older you get the stronger\nthe wind gets and it's always in your\nface and I think that could be true of\ncompanies\nwhat keeps me up at night is you know a\nlot of people ask me in the professional\ncontext so what keeps you up at night in\nthe company like is this something\nhappening what keeps me up at night is\nsomething not happening what keeps me up\nat night is the idea that we grow into\nsome things that I like was meant to\ndisrupt 2009 Airbnb takes off\nso so we started in 2007 2008 it takes\noff by 2009. I go on a 10-year Journey\nit's now late 2019 and I remember having\na dream a bad dream\nthat I woke up and I was running a\ncompany that's unrecognizable from\nanything I ever intended to start it was\nlike I was in a Wilderness for 10 years\nand I just and I came back and I\nremember going on a hike in Bolinas\nCalifornia where Joe had like a summer\nhouse and we went on a hike Joni and I\nand I told them about this dream and\nthey said well what did you find I said\nI was horrified because\nthe company we set up to start is\nunrecognizable we have today and they go\nwhat do you mean I go well people are\ncomplaining that it's big it's\nbureaucratic it's slow moving people are\nmore complacent cost is rising gross is\nslumming it's starting to feel like a\ncorporation\nand I didn't know what to do\nI felt like we needed to like not blow\nit all up but change it all like take\nthe house back to the studs\nbut the problem was we're about to go\npublic and that's like a really bad time\nto do that\nbut I had this image in my head\nof this kind of company that I want to\nhave\nthis image was to build the most\ncreative place on Earth to build the\nworld's biggest startup to build a\ncompany that was like felt small that\nwas completely focused not on a product\nor service but a community I was\nstarting to come to conclusion by 2019\nthat you can't be big\nand have a soul like at some point those\nthings were at odds that the problem was\nbeing big\nand I didn't know what to do\nand all of a sudden we get word in\nFebruary 2020\nthat our China businesses collapsed by\n80 percent because this thing called\ncovid we're like what's covid\nand then within eight weeks you lose\neighty percent of your business and I've\nnever had a near-death experience but\nit's been described to me as your life\nflashes before your eyes and I had a\nnear business death experience and then\nsuddenly everything being clear to me if\nI was sitting this chair three years ago\nI would not have been clear\nI don't think I would have the clear dad\ntoday there's something about almost\nlosing everything\nin everything I had I at least at that\ntime I thought was the professional\nthat gives you Clarity imagine your\nhouse is on fire and someone says you\ncan take 20 percent of the things out of\nyour house\nsuddenly you have to make that choice\nand you get really clear about what's\nimportant\npeople start telling you I want\neverybody exist you say why and they\ntell you it's as if they're giving the\neulogy before you're even dead and how\nthey how you want to be remembered and\nyou start to ask yourself\nI don't know what's going to happen but\nhow do I want to be remembered and at\nthat point we stepped into action and we\nbasically rebuilt the company for ground\nup and this is to again bring it back\none more time to Steve Jobs I met two\npeople at that point in my life who\nchanged my life one was Johnny Ive who\nwas\num Steve's partner in design and the\nother was heroki assai who's Steve's\ncreative director\nand they told me about the way Steve ran\nthe company\nand actually\na funny even further aside is\num I remember one time I remember went\nto Steve's house he never met him but\nand and I saw these books on the Shelf\nfrom robinheimer and asses like wife\nlike what is with the wrapping on your\nbooks but as I started studying I\nrealized that\nit was this idea that you almost like\nRobert kept in the whole bomb in his\nhead that this idea that the leader\ncollects all the information and that\nyou're the center that it's not a\npyramid you're not top down you're\ninside out you're the son of a solar\nsystem but your job is to like emit\nlight and bring decision making in to\npull in this shared Consciousness and I\nstarted realizing there was a whole new\nway to run a company a company that\nwasn't divisions think about what that\nsounds like divisions we are divided but\ntotally integrated a small lean Elite as\npossible\ncreative and analytical technology and\nHumanities that we'd have one flow we\nwouldn't be metrics oriented we'd be\nbasically idea oriented and we'd measure\nthe results in that we would just\nthere's this really specifically ran a\ncompany\nand that was basically the way I found\nourselves out of a crisis into so the\nlesson the story is through that I was\nable to get a lot of clarity through\nthis crisis I was forced to answer and\nask all these questions that I never had\nto do before\nbut I hope on the personal side I don't\nneed a crisis to answer those questions\nyeah that that that's exactly where I\nthink we're headed that you have you\nhave an opportunity to avoid the crisis\nyes in order to not be not everyone\nneeds that crisis no you don't it sounds\nlike do you do you still when you\npresent ideas they're so visual you see\nthem totally can see everything yeah\nyou're talking about it and I can I can\nsee it with you everything in my head my\nmind is like a three-dimensional model\nand all my ideas think of it like a tree\nthe trunk of the tree is your very first\nprinciples your root ideas and then they\nhave branches and the branches have\nbranches and those branches have leaves\nor it's like a space a three-dimensional\nspace it's multi dimensional colorful\nand this is what we call the model your\nmodel of the world that you want to live\nin and as you gain more information you\nkeep changing the model in your head I\nkind of describe my mind running Airbnb\nas imagine a chessboard and\nthere's that you have to see a few moves\nahead now imagine like a die a\nthousand-sided die each playing a\nseparate game of chess all\nsimultaneously anticipating and\nunderstanding relationships as hard as\nthat is if you can start to organize all\nthe ideas in your mind but not be rigid\ncontinually changing and orienting it\nlike you know this is how I tend to see\nthings in three dimensions spatially\nit's really rich Vivid colors and that's\njust how I think you know I think other\npeople will think in abstract thoughts\nor numbers some think in terms of\nlanguage but that's how I do it you know\nand it probably doesn't surprise you\ngiven my background and do you see\nyourself in that or is that happening\nand you're observing it you know you\nmight have hit on something there have\nbeen times\nwhere I'm trying to design a world that\nother people wanna I want other people\nto live in and I think it's like I want\nto vicariously live through them\nit's like I want to Design This House\nthat's the nicest house in the world for\neveryone to live in but I'll be in the\nworkshop designing the house and\nsometimes I have to stop to say maybe I\nshould step inside that house\nand I think that I think that's a Crux\nof it actually and to answer your\nquestion I sometimes see myself in the\nhouse\nand sometimes I see myself\njust kind of almost like a monk or you\nknow in a in a technical design\nMonastery like\nyou know that's kind of what the\npandemic was I described it almost like\na monastery except with zoom but but if\nyou didn't know I was at zube you just\nthink I was meditating all day right\nlike I'd just be sitting in one chair\nyeah and so that's a great thing as I I\nthink that sometimes many times we as\nleader especially Tech Founders I think\nthat many Tech Founders basically design\nthe kind of world they want to live in\nbecause the world they grew up in was\ninadequate in some way and did not make\nthem happy and I think the challenge\nthat those Tech leaders is to make sure\nthat they step inside that world and\nlive that world themselves and when you\ndon't do it then sometimes you start to\nlike forget why you do things and you\nget disconnected wow\njust kind of you're making me think of\nall this now you're making me think too\nI love it no and and that resonates so\ndeeply and strongly because I also think\nthat without purpose Tech entrepreneurs\nalso can sometimes not even just Tech\nentrepreneurs entrepreneurs in general\nor anyone can build something\nthat they monetized that they would\nnever want to live in too yeah and that\nsometimes people don't know why they're\ndoing it correct they they started it\nfor a reason maybe the reason was\nextrinsic I want to be rich and\nsuccessful but maybe it was intrinsic\nmaybe there was something but even so\nthen you find yourself waking up one day\nasking why am I still doing this and\nyou know the number of people that\nforgot why they're doing it the number\nof people that are self-driving cars\nthere's a destination that's in the car\nthey're driving towards it but they\ndon't even know what that destination is\nand that's when you don't look inside\nyourself and if you're not careful you\nwill basically be at a super highway\ngoing somewhere not knowing why you're\ngoing there and you may wake up and end\nup in a destination that wasn't where\nyou intended I think this having this\nClarity is so important who am I what do\nI value like what do I want to do in\nthis world it's like taking the time to\nreflect and I think the best businesses\nare really introspective by\nintrospective leaders like when we\nstarted the company we were really clear\nhere's our mission and it wasn't just\nlike a mission statement it's like\nhere's exactly what we're trying to do\nand now it changes here are our values\nhere's the kind of people I want to like\nwork with well what do they all have in\ncommon they're curious they're\noptimistic they're kind of creative they\ntend to like like hosting other people\nokay those become what we call values\nwhat are the shared lessons what are the\nshared stories and the more you can\nstart to be really reflective you're\nright the more you're clear about what\nyou want the more you get it our problem\nisn't in life probably that we don't get\nwhat we want the problem is we don't\nknow what we want maybe or we we pursue\nthings we on your unconsciously wanting\nthat are counterproductive to what will\nmake us happy and if we can just wrap\nour arms around that\nsome of the hardest things to change our\nown thoughts but in a weird way they\nalso seem like the most possible to\nchange and so that that's something that\nI've I've seen like some of the\nloneliest people I've met are some of\nthe richest people I've met it's the\nmost isolated people I met are some of\nthe most successful people I met it's\nthe most confused people I've met are\nthe most powerful because at some point\nthe power and success can be confusing\nyou know you had a purpose but you also\nhave all these demands and stakeholders\nyou can get fused by appeasing people\nand you like I think that happened to me\nlike I think I started Airbnb and I had\na really Clear Vision and I think I've\ngotten to a Wilderness where I kind of\ngot confused and a lot of Founders have\ndescribed becoming confused a lot of\nleaders get confused and I totally see\nhow that happens\num and I think finding your way back\nhome is key I I would be intrigued to\nsee\nif you close your eyes now or whenever\nyou chose to to see\nwhat you saw when you looked at your\npersonal life you're talking about your\nprofessional life as being all these\nthousands of decisions moving and you\nsay like like kind of that period of\nself-reflection right yeah like I think\nI saw somebody who was kind of\nalmost\npunishing myself in romanticizing\nsuffering because I thought you know in\nsome extent I maybe believe that\nI was going to give everything to the\ncompany and it was like this selfless\nact but it became so selfless that I\nthen could start to lose a sense of\nmyself I mean you know how weird it is I\nalways kind of joked like if I die will\nI die Brian chesky or the Airbnb guy\njust died you know like and like am I\nBrian or my Airbnb and like\nyou know like they get really one is an\nicon\nthat's a noun and verb you know\nubiquitously around the world the other\nis a person that not a lot of people\nknow really know\nand when you it's very careful that I\nstarted becoming the company\nand this company started becoming me\nand I think\n70 of that was good\nbecause that meant the company I think\nwas a person had a face as humanistic it\nwas in the details but when you become a\ncompany you cease to be a person and\nthen you lose a sense of yourself and\nthen you become an icon and by icon I\ndon't mean famous I mean iconography\nicon is short for an iconography and\niconography is for for a symbol for\nsomething and of course people are much\nmore than symbols and\nI started seeing that I started becoming\nan a symbol and a thing\nand\nI stopped listening to myself and and by\nthe way like you get pressure from\nshareholders to like drive a stock price\nyou get pressure from\nyou know employees to make it a better\nwork environment you're getting pressure\nfrom host but no one gives you pressure\nfor yourself and your personal life if\nyou don't create that own pressure you\nwill like that will be the like that's\nthe one person that may not\nput their hand up hey\neveryone else will and if you don't\nlisten to yourself\nand I think that's been part of the\nsecond chapter in my life is like kind\nof Designing the world I want to live in\nand then living in that world and\nchoosing to actually live in that world\nand you'd be I mean you've interviewed\nso many people so but I'm so surprised\nhow many leaders don't actually live in\nthat world I I tend to think that like\nsome yeah some of the most successful\npeople or people that\nthey get so disconnected from what they\nintend to do and when they started and\nso reconnecting I mean so much of this I\nguess I tend to see everything through\nthat lens but so much of it is about\nreconnecting that that reconnection that\npath back home I love what you were\nsaying about the iconography and how the\nhuman meshes with the iconography and\nyou described earlier the and maybe\neveryone does that I just did it in a\nbigger sorry to cut no I just did in a\nbetter way like you could totally get\nhow like I and Brian are maybe they\nstart to emerge but I bet you even\npeople who don't have a giant company\nwho they really are and the person\nthey're like supposed to be\nare merging and as those two things\nmerge you lose who you really are I mean\nit's method acting it's literally method\nacting it's like we are all pretending\nto play a role only to believe that that\nrole that we pretended to be is now us\nand has replaced us and it's and it's\neven harder I'll tell you why because\nwhen you build Airbnb it had iconography\nyes Brian didn't ever have iconography\nlike there wasn't a there wasn't like a\nmission list and a value list like\nbefore when Brian existed before and so\nif you were to draw the iconography of\nBrian the person not\nthe Airbnb\noh I'm intrigued as to what that would\nlook like if you started to design that\nI see a child\nI see like a a childlike curiosity and\nenergy and love\nthat I think I've always held on to\nI also see the world like through this\nidea of family and community and I think\nwhen people hear the word family they\nthink of like their parents\ntheir siblings their children\nand I think I see like you know I asked\nlike my co-founder Joe I asked him like\nwhat would Airbnb would success be for\neveryone he had this crazy audacious\nidea he said to redefine the word family\nand I I've realized that like so much of\nmy life has been trying to do that I see\nthis like childlike person of curiosity\nand wonder\nthat I've never left that sense of\nwonder that I'm open to be vulnerable\nand guided by love and like treating\nwanting to\ntreat those around me like family and\nwhat I mean by that is\nI try to do anything for them\num and and I hope\nI hope\nthat my friends if they ever heard this\nthey would feel like that resonates and\nthat's not just a pure idea\nI mean that's what I that means that's\nthe iconography I would hope that\niconography is true to some extent I\nguess as I think about it even deeper\nI I've used the word loneliness\nconnection and Community but maybe at\nsome deeper level the deepest word is\nfamily\nand what bonds Bond's family is love and\nlike I think that like\nas families have gotten smaller and\nsmaller\nwe've gotten more more and more isolated\nand if we could re-expand that word and\nmaybe that's like too idealistic but\nlike just even a little bit to your like\nclose friends\nand to other people and just try to like\nre-expand that Circle\nthat's\nkind of what I would want\nyou know if I design the world around me\nthen I better design it with other\npeople in it and as you see that do you\ndo you see the child or are you the\nchild\nas you visualize that yeah it's funny I\nkind of see both I see\nlike are you seeing the child sitting\nthere are you seeing the vision Through\nThe Eyes of where you would be I feel\nlike a Timeless image of myself like I\nI'm like\nyoung and all at the same time like it's\nnot just one age I'm like I can see\nthe child of me and I could also see\nthis like grown-up that I always like\nthat is protecting and so I have like\nboth sides The Protector offering\nsecurity and bringing people together\nand the child who is vulnerable and\nseeks love and wants to just be open and\ntotally curious It's almost like I have\nthis image\nyou know like you know like you say at\nthe family at the dinner table what you\nlike like he's a kid with your parents\nyour siblings whatever\nmy image is that but it's a very big\ntable\nwith a lot of people and you know and\nand that's not just my close family that\nI might have it's\nyou know maybe like the the broader\npeople in my life that I have around me\nthat's I think the image I have and I\nthink that's in a space that's very well\ndesigned\nvery well designed and I have a design\naesthetic that's like fairly modern but\nalso Whimsical I don't like the cold I\ndon't like coldness of modernism I like\nit to be like colorful and so yeah\n[Laughter]\nto me the clarity is that it's not even\nthe merger often what you said so\nbeautifully was like I see my younger\nself and I see where I am now and now\nit's protecting but the childlike is\nthat love that joy that that Community\nthe family\nand it's like they're hand in hand\nlike it's not a merger of the two it's\nnot an integration it's a hand in hand\nthere's a wisdom that you have today\nthat you didn't have then and there's a\nwisdom you had then that you don't have\nnow and it's just hand in hand and\nwalking together I've always wanted to\nbelieve that I can have the wisdom of my\ngrandparents and the Curiosity of a\nchild there you go in one that I have a\nfoot you know Walt Disney one of my\nother Idols used to in the in the front\nof Disneyland he says here you leave the\nworld of today and into the World of\nTomorrow yesterday in fantasy he said I\nhave a foot in the future and a foot in\nthe past and I think that's partly what\nI have\na foot in the future and that future is\none of maybe curiosity and looking\nforward in futurism and Technology\nand then I've also a foot in the past\nthe past is my roots I think I I\noscillate between the two you know\nculture and Technology\nmassive scale one of the become one of\nthe biggest world with like\nthe desire to always be a startup and\nalways be close-knit it's like these two\nparadoxes competing forces\n[Music]\nyeah and I think that that is a tension\nthat it's I think it's a really\ninteresting tension now you're making me\nthink about this like I'm sure I've\nnever some of this stuff I've never\nreally\nnot only but not talked about it some of\nthe stuff I'm kind of never really\nthought about that\nuntil now I'm just really thinking about\nit one of the things when you're like if\nlike you run a giant companies you learn\nscale um\ncould you start a company you're tiny\nyou have to do everything you have to\nlike\nyou know like things you don't even\nthink about like you have an office\nwhich is your apartment and you need to\nlike buy a coffee maker and go buy the\ncoffee and you need to like have a name\nfor your company you actually need to\ncheck that name's trademark they got\nabout a domain name you gotta like have\na story for the company and like then\nyou've got to like make sure you have a\nlegal Corporation you're not find a\nlawyer you got to interview the lawyers\nand then you gotta like actually decide\nwhat you're gonna make and you say how\ndo I make things like and I could go\ndown the hundred thousand things here in\nthe tedious details and then\nif you go on a rocket ship that I go on\n15 years later you know a billion and a\nhalf times has been used you end up at\nsome massive scale a scale that's bigger\nthan you've ever imagined but as a\nFounder you never let go of those\ndetails you know it's like a a Founder's\ndifferent a professional manager a\nprofessional manager never saw it small\nand as a Founder not only did you see it\nsmall you created what was small and so\nas you see the full scale you tend to\nzoom out and zoom in and zoom out and\nzoom in and it's actually a really\nhelpful skill in life\nwhenever you need a different\nperspective you can zoom in or you can\nzoom out and I tend to do both I go in\nand sorry well what about this what\nabout this what about this and go\nthere's a smaller smart detail and then\nI go back to the present scale it's like\na satellite map\nit's like the power is a 10. zoom out to\nspace zoom in with a microscope and that\nis just a way to think about things and\nyou're constantly doing that when you\nrun a company you see the big picture\nand you say what does this mean you Dive\nRight In and you zoom out and a lot of\nleaders they struggle they there they\ncan only do that Medium altitude they\ncan't see the fullest picture or they\nget stuck and they can't access the\nsmallest of details\nin the entire universe exists in the\nsmallest detail and that's what you\ndiscover when you zoom and zoom out you\nstart to realize the relationships and\nit allows you to both run something\nlarge and still connect with somebody at\nthe most intimate human level and not\nlose your mind along the way yeah it's\nthat balance between\nrecognizing what's possible through\nscale but at the same time being able to\nbe embracing of your own insignificance\nyeah it's like you see the significance\nbut yeah you recognize yeah it's\ninsignificant yeah yeah Paradox is where\nit's so fascinating yeah the Paradox is\nthe only thing that's fascinating yeah\nyou know the human mind is apparently\nall of these everything that we see\nthat's magical about the world is a\nparadox that everything's connected but\neverything's doing its own thing yes\nright like the ocean the sun are doing\ntheir own thing yeah they're connected\nyeah totally doing their own thing and I\nthink the more you start to see why I\nwant to scale you sort of see you're\nright that more and more things are\nconnected but because everything's\nconnected doesn't mean they're all the\nsame and the more you learn about the\ndetails of things the more you realize\nhow different everything is and so you\nbut then you realize they're actually in\nsome deeper way related and that you\nspend the rest of your life kind of in\nthat Discovery yeah and you and you know\nwhat I've observed that is the\nconnecting Force at least up until now\nin my life\nis that everything that we've just\ntalked about everything in the universe\nthat we see is serving uniquely what\nconnects it is that it's serving the sun\nis serving the water is serving the\ntrees are serving the trunk of the tree\nthat leaves you talked about the flowers\nThey're serving everything is giving a\nservice everything's interdependent on\neverything else that we tend to have the\nsolution\nthat we're separate from one another\nand I I think that even like loneliness\nmight be a a reality which is the way\nyou perceive the world but aloneness may\nbe a illusion that you're not as alone\nand separate as you think you are and I\nthink that's a really good thing to\nremind yourself and that we are like so\nmuch more connected to everything else\nand that I think so much of creativity\nis just first embracing the fact that\neverything is connected in some way and\nit's your job to discover and make\nconnections and find relationships and\nsimilarities and by the way that's a\ngreat way to connect with people to know\nthat like wow what makes them so\nfascinating is they're really different\nfrom me in some of these ways but what\nthis is going to bond us is that we're\nactually so connected and there are\nalmost no humans on this planet that you\ndon't have some fundamental connections\nto and if you don't see them you have to\nkeep looking and once you keep looking\nthat becomes the bond that becomes the\nthing that you share between them\nand how do you do that with curiosity\nand interest fascinating just be\nfascinated all the time and it's almost\nlike that's contagious\nif you're fascinated I'm fascinated\nsomebody once said that to me a director\nwho I was doing a film to and he said if\nyou're fascinated I'm fascinated and I'm\nlike well okay like I really do and it's\nlike\nand so what what do you find fascinating\nyeah yeah I often say to people\nsimilarly that\nif you don't find someone interesting\nit's because you're not interested yeah\nlike you're not interested enough there\nis something interesting about\neverything there's something interesting\nabout everyone and everything and that\nis what the Cure that that is I think\nwhat curiosity is and like you know you\nfind the game within the game you find\nlike in school like I I think so many\npeople in school like they're not\ninterested in subjects because they're\nabstract but if somebody's obsessed with\nbasketball then teach uh physics through\nbasketball three biology through\nbasketball teach history through\nbasketball the history of so you just\nyou find something you're interested in\nI think the great thing about starting a\ncompany is I had no interest in learning\nabout accounting I had no abstract\ninterest in learning about leadership\nand management and organization I know\nabstract interest in understanding like\ntechnical architecture but I did\ninterest in how we should account for\nall the money we're making what\ntechnology platform we should be on to\nenable Airbnb and through something I\nwas already interested in Airbnb I was\nable to learn all these other things but\nif I had to learn them abstractly the\nway we're taught in school I don't think\nanything would have stuck and so Airbnb\nbecame that model this world and I have\nlearned almost everything through this\nworld that I've been generally\nconstructing co-constructing with my\nco-workers and with the community and\nit's just like I like to joke that\nAirbnb is like the world's biggest RISD\nproject that just never stopped and we\njust kept building it and kept building\nand kept building it and kept building\nit and it's a bigger rebuild the more I\nlearned and the more I discover and yeah\nI've seen so much of the world through\nthe creation of this really big house so\nto speak yeah and that's pretty wild it\nis pretty well and it's just getting\nstarted hopefully it's just getting\nstarted Brian uh this is without a doubt\nthe most unique episode of on purpose I\nthink we've ever had really in four\nyears and no way don't just say stuff\nlike that you can check with these guys\nand uh\nbut we end every episode with a final\nfive these are five questions I ask\npretty much ninety percent of them to\nall guests and these are your final five\nBrian they have to be answered in one\nword to one sentence maximum and I will\nprobably destroy that pattern but yeah\ntry so Brian these your final five the\nfirst question is what is the best\nInsight advice that you've ever heard or\nreceived or read it's better to have a\nhundred people love you\nthan a million people that just sort of\nlike you and so do things that don't\nscale\nand if you do\nmaybe people will love something you\nlove so much they'll tell everyone about\nit and you might end up with millions of\npeople after all that's kind of a long\nsentence but it's a great sentence it's\nbeautiful it's perfect second question\nwhat is the worst Insight advice you've\never heard read received or\ncome across anything that involves\nchasing status not because it's bad but\nbecause it's actually a horrible way to\neven get it love that answer Yeah\nquestion number three how would you\ndefine your current purpose to try to\nhelp\nbring the world together even if it's in\nthe end a small way question number four\nif you were being remembered after you\nwere physically gone what would you hope\nto hear we miss him\na fifth and final question I asked this\nquestion to every guest who's ever been\non the show if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be sometimes people ask me\nif you can impose one thing on the road\nwhat would it be and I'd say everyone\nwould have a passport and everyone would\nwalk in someone else's shoes and I think\nif they were to do that there'd be like\nsuch a greater Awakening\nin the world so maybe everyone was\nforced to live someone else's life and\nto step in someone else's shoes and the\nmore different the better well said\nBrian chess gave her and Brian that was\nuh as I said the most unique\nI think it's really interesting\nsomething that came to my mind and heart\nand since this has been such an\nintuitive conversation I feel I should\nshare it\nyou know in in our professional life we\nhave business partners put in a personal\nlife I don't think we often think about\nhaving human partners and I really\nappreciate you dancing with me today\ngoing there with me today and being\nhuman partners for each other and you\ndefinitely did that for me today you\nbrought out of me things I didn't know\nthat I haven't gone to for a while so\nthank you so much for inspiring me and\nenlightening me in so many ways I I\ntruly had a special internal experience\nmyself well I think I've learned about\nmyself through this process\nit's amazing the amount of time you can\ngo through in your life\nwithout stopping and taking a look at\nthings and when you do my God like that\njust changes your perspective on\neverything doesn't it absolutely\nsuch a pleasure and everyone who's been\nlistening and watching if you're with us\nthen make sure that you\nI want you to let me know what was your\nfavorite moment there were so many great\nmoments but grab a screenshot of where\nyou found your favorite moment so we can\nsee all the seconds and minutes so that\neveryone can go listen to I love seeing\nwhat deeply connects and penetrates\nthrough to our community because this is\nall in service of you so thank you for\neveryone who's been listening and\nwatching and thank you Brian thank you\nJay if you love this episode you will\nalso love my interview with Charles\nduhigg on how to hack your brain change\nany habit effortlessly and the secret to\nmaking better decisions look am I\nhesitating on this because I'm scared of\nmaking the choice because I'm scared of\ndoing the work or am I sitting with this\nbecause it just doesn't feel right yet"
