    "transcript": "when you get everything you thought you\nwanted and you still feel empty you\nrealized wow that was not what I was\nsupposed to be chasing this is one of\nthe most remarkable Amazing Stories in\nhip-hop Russ I do whatever I want\nwhenever I want I love it\nI thought I'm never gonna get depressed\nwhat does that even mean I don't need\nany y'all look uh and it's like deep\ndown you wanted everyone though how\nstrong of a man are you if you're scared\nto face yourself straight up\nbefore we jump into this episode I'd\nlike to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbest-selling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nhow do you even go about thinking about\nwhat being enough means especially in a\nculture that's comparing and right\nalways putting you up against other\npeople yeah it's so hard for me because\nI think it does start in childhood and I\nthink it started with you know wanting\nto meet the standard that my dad set and\nyou know my dad who I love him and\ndisclaimer before like this interview\ngoes more it's like I love my parents\nand they have done I think a great job\nand I don't blame them for anything\num there's just realities that have\nhappened that like you know there's\nexperiences that I have that I now have\nto deal with and learn from Etc but my\ndad's standard was Perfection a lot of\ntimes you know and he was very critical\nand so for me you know his metric\nit was impossible to me I ended up\nadopting it as my own you know and so\nthe inner voice for a long time it was\nmy dad's inner voice of you know that's\nnot good enough nah you know you got a\n92 on the test if you would have studied\nyou got 100 but it's still an A but you\nknow little things like that or showing\nhim music early on and career stuff and\njust in general right and but that inner\nvoice that used to be his became my own\ninner voice so now like it it becomes\nthis sort of inner critic that when I go\nplatinum it's like it doesn't do it\nmaybe double Platinum will maybe triple\noh you how much money did you make ten\noh maybe 11 million will make you feel\ngood and so you keep chasing the next\nthing thinking that's what's gonna make\nyou feel good about yourself and\nI think um to reference like the Rick\nRubin interview I think he mentioned\nsomething where it's like you get the\nnumber one album you get all this stuff\nand it doesn't do what you wanted it to\ndo and you feel emptier than ever and I\nthink that's kind of the place I got to\nwas I got the money the house of this\nand whatever and that's how you know\nthere's really something missing um\nbecause how'd you get all that and you\nstill don't feel good and it's a really\nempty feeling because most people in the\nworld think that the reason why they're\nnot happy and not feeling enough is all\nthese things that they'll probably never\nget and it's kind of this beautiful\nuh blissfully ignorant place to live\nbecause you just get to like always have\nthis idea that nah I know like I'm gonna\nkeep going towards this and I know this\nis what's going to give me happiness\neven though you'll probably never get it\nright most people won't ever see a\nmillion dollars or whatever but for the\npeople who get in but and I want no\nsympathy for like oh we don't feel bad\nfor you you're a millionaire get over it\nbut it's like when you get everything\nyou thought you wanted and you still\nfeel empty you realize that wow that was\nnot what I was supposed to be chasing\nand there's a bigger hole here and now I\nneed to grow down you know and I need to\nlook internal because external didn't do\nit and that's what race is all about in\nthe album right yeah so Oasis is the\nclosest track to that feeling or so\nOasis was sort of this Fool's Paradise\nis what the idea behind that song was it\nwas like I got the house the life\neverything on Surface looked like okay\nyou did it and\ninternally though I was still a mess I\nwas joking with you you know off camera\nlike last time we talked you know I was\n30 pounds overweight it was just\nproportioned nicely so it didn't it\nwasn't it wasn't like too big in any one\nplace but I was 30 pounds overweight I\nwas drinking too much I was eating too\nmuch I had no discipline over my\nthoughts my eating habits I had no\ndiscipline over my Sexual Energy things\nlike that so it was really like I was a\nglutton you know but the way that is\ndressed up sometimes you're a rock star\nyou're a king you know and so Oasis is\nabout on Surface yeah you're eating good\nyou're you know you're you're gaining\nweight but because you're getting money\nand you're eating good and you're\nsleeping with random women and drinking\nbut it's all good because look another\nplaque just came in and more money came\nin another sold out show\num and it was sort of poking like that\nwhole song is sort of like poking fun at\nme because I'm in my little Oasis I'm\ndistracted by like look at my house look\nat my life what like I love what you\njust said you're like you're distracted\nyeah by the gold yeah and you're\ndistracted by The Shining lights and the\nbright things and the plaques when\nyou're that distracted how do you open\nup your eyes like how do you even get to\na point now where you're able to look\nback and go I was distracted now I'm a\nbit more awake and I'm working on this\nstuff because I can imagine that it gets\nso loud you're a rock star you're a king\nyou're all these things and then all of\na sudden you've got to kind of like\nquiet that down and go but I'm still not\nhappy how do you get that breakthrough\nbecause I feel like we're all the best\nat setting ourselves up for failure yeah\nand we're all the best at avoiding\nadvice when it's good like I know\nwhen I'm wrong because when my wife says\nsomething and I know she's right yeah\nand I don't want to admit it right\nbecause I know she's right and that's\nwhat but it's that awareness piece is so\nhard yeah how did you what was the\nmoment for you because you are killing\nit you're still killing it yeah you\nlooked well then to me you looked well\nthank you today like you're great like\nright so and and I really enjoyed your\ncompany last time and I'm enjoying your\ncompany this time so externally yeah you\ncould argue well what's going on says\nmen we get good at masking it yeah\nthat's part of like you know I have a\nlong answer for this but um go on go for\nit first of all therapy is kind of what\nlike not woke me up but it helped but\nsomething I learned in therapy is uh\nthis idea that you know Society measures\na Man based off of how much they can\ncarry how far they can carry it and how\nalone they can carry it and I think for\na lot of men we have become professional\num hiders of our pain and so while I was\nquote unquote distracted what woke me up\nto what was going on was that there was\npsychological warfare and internal chaos\nconstantly anyway you know I like I just\nkept pushing it down pushing it down but\nI knew it was there because I was\npushing it down and it just got to a\npoint where I just had a breakdown one\nday it just you push it down enough and\nat some point you can't push it anymore\nand it you know overflows in it and what\nI learned is um when you're burying it\nburying it burying it when it does\nfinally just explode it's always going\nto be at the worst time and uh that time\ncame right before a European tour that I\nhad scheduled and I had to cancel it\nbecause I was like my body and spirit\nand mind just shut down I just couldn't\neven do it I couldn't even like go\nthrough the motions of acting like I\ncould perform and um you know through\ntherapy and talking every week you know\nand really really being vulnerable and\nbeing honest with my therapist which I\ncouldn't wait for like\ngetting a therapist has been at the top\nof my to-do list for like four years and\nI just never did I never got around to\nit because I just always once again was\nlike do I really need one look how good\nmy life is like no I think I'm dripping\nbut it just got to this point man where\nI was like\nI need to talk to someone because I feel\nlike I'm going insane yeah it's just\nbeen so helpful because I'm like I want\nto figure out what's going on internally\nso it's like well I don't know how to\nfix it so let's act like it doesn't\nexist you know I'm so glad you raised\nthis because I've been looking for the\nperson I'm about to introduce a\nconversation that I've been trying to\nfind the right person to have it with\nyeah and it just clicked me in this\nmoment that you're that person come on\nlike literally and I think it's such an\nimportant conversation that\nI've been trying to navigate I have it\noffline a lot but I haven't really had\nit online so this will be the first time\nthat I talk about it here but it's like\nyou just raised that as a man especially\nwe're good at masking it yeah and I\nthink men in today's society being a man\nin today's society is such an\ninteresting time and you come across to\nme as you know like you're and and you\ncan describe in your own sense but\nyou're a confident man you know you're a\nman's man I'd I'd say as well like I\ndon't know how you see yourself that's\nwhy I don't know how you see yourself I\nwas going to ask you yeah because you\nyou so confidently are like hey man I\nneed to find help I went to therapy yeah\nbut at the same time you're a rapper on\nstage who's like dropping like the best\nbars and so I'm like when you look at\nthat Paradox I love that because I'm\nthinking about what is it that you think\nmen are struggling with most and maybe\nit's even for your own friends the\npeople you hang out with like what do\nyou think men are struggling with in\ntoday's society because I don't feel we\ntalk about that enough with like what\nthe struggle is yeah I think I mean\nso much but I think I think men are\nstruggling with being in tune with their\nown emotions and feeling safe and\nfeeling like they have permission from\nthemselves to feel what they're feeling\nbecause Society has told them get over\nit effectively you know and um I think\nfor me that's what I did for the you\nknow for the most part and I think my\ngeneration let alone like Generations\nbefore me like we all saw our dads\nprobably just like get over it and\nfigure it out and you know brush brush\nthe dirt off and and keep going and um\nthat's what I did and I would just put\nlittle trickles of what I was feeling in\nthe music like it's so funny you know\nwhen I had that breakdown when I finally\njust was honest with myself and and got\na therapist\nI would go back and listen to old songs\nlike songs like nobody knows or songs\nlike all to you and it's like these were\nlike such cries for help that I think\nmade me feel more insane because I would\nput them out and they just became songs\nyou know and it's sort of downplayed\nwhat was really going on because it's\nlike I take a very vulnerable real\nemotion of sadness and pain and\nconfusion and feeling lost and don't\nknow what to do and turn it into two and\na half minutes of music and now it just\nbecomes numbers on the screen and\nstreams and how loud is it at the shows\nand I forget fans forget people forget\nbut most importantly I forget that oh no\nlike this was like really what I was\ngoing to this isn't just like a lullaby\nyeah I think you're right I feel like\nwhen I talk to people I feel like men\nare feeling a lot of pressure\nto be a lot of things yeah to be\nsuccessful to have it together to have\nsome emotional maturity figure out their\nmental health and again you know every\ngender has their own pressures that come\nwith it right but I think I know a lot\nof men who feel scared to share that\npressure because they feel like you said\nthat they shouldn't have it yeah like\nthey're not allowed to have that\npressure I think you're one of the few\nmusic guys that has found a way of\nintertwining mental health and music in\na way that it's not cheesy and it's not\nlike corny and it's not like it comes\nacross like when I listen to you I'm\njust like God that's a bar that's like\nyou know you can appreciate it just\nbecause it's good music yeah and then\nknowing that you have this conscious\nside to yourself was that like always at\nthe Forefront of when you got into music\nor was it something that evolved with\ntime because of your journey because I\nthink it's quite it's quite a hard\nbalance to talk about meaningful stuff\nyeah in a way that doesn't come across\nas cheesy and corny so how do how have\nyou found a way of being able to do that\nyeah I think I always was looking for\nanswers you know and I think I always as\na consumer of music I always like\nsubstance and lyrics and things that I\ncould you know things that meant\nsomething you know things that maybe\ncould help me and as an artist when I\nwanted to make my own I was trying to\nfind answers like my creative side was\ntrying to piece together these other\nsides of me like what was going on with\nmy family with my friends with my\nrelationship with my career like the\ncreative side of me would come in and be\nlike maybe this means that maybe what\nyou're feeling means this maybe you know\nand like like I said there's like all\nthese little like Easter eggs I guess\nthroughout my catalog of me trying to\nfigure it out and so I think I was just\nnaturally and Am Naturally a curious\nperson and an ambitious person and so\nlike and ambitious in the sense that I\nreally want to figure out what is going\non with me like I want to know why I\nthink the way I think where that came\nfrom and and I think in the past it's\nfunny when you're like you're a\nconfident man etc etc I was omnipotent\nand I've learned that that's not\nconfident you know that's insecurity and\nyou know I because I mean this is so so\nmulti-layered but it's funny your shirt\nsays imperfections because it really\nstems from me being a perfectionist\nright so like me being a perfectionist\nthere's no room for me to not be right\nthere's no room for me to not know what\nlike not act like I know everything and\nwhat's going on and I got being a\nperfectionist from like the standard\nthat my dad said which ended up becoming\nmy own standard so early on in my career\nI had this omnipotence where like I knew\neverything everything I was doing was\nright and I felt like I had to act like\nthat because if you're a perfectionist\nthere is no room for criticism\nperfectionists are trying to run from\ncriticism and help is coded as criticism\nto a Perfection so I didn't want any\nhelp and if you tried to help I took it\nas a critique and it threatened my idea\nof being a perfectionist wow you know so\nlike I'm trying to figure out the\nanswers so like dude I one thing you\nsaid to me last time I've quoted this\nso many times in interviews when I get\nasked questions about like oh what was\none of your favorite takeaways and it's\nfrom our interview and it's you said\nthat when you sometimes get in the\nstudio at that time you were like I get\nrid of all my friends yeah so I can be\nin there alone and make weird sounds\nthat I wouldn't make when people are in\nthe room because I might be scared of\nwhat they think and I've said that to so\nmany people and everyone's always like\nquite blown away or taken aback because\nI guess it's not a common thing that\nartists do and and it stayed with me for\nso long but I was interested by what you\njust said like how did your immediate I\nguess your immediate circle I'm assuming\nyou're around people that you love but\nhow do you think then The Wider Circle\nresponds to you saying things like I\nneed help therapy is good for you like\nyou know like do you have do you feel\nlike The Wider Circle goes automatically\nlike do you think the world's got to a\nplace now where we're like yes Russ that\nmakes sense you're right or do you still\nhave people around you going no you\ndon't need therapy man you just need to\ngo smoke or blow some cash or like yeah\nyeah what what because you come from the\nrap music world I wonder what do you\nhear\num I think my friends like my immediate\ncircle my friends were all very\nsupportive my family was supportive as\nwell but they're obviously like what's\ngoing on because my identity has been\nattached when it comes to my family my\nidentity has been attached to helping\nthem you know that's how I felt safe\nthat was the role I played and I've\nnever asked for help I've never received\nhelp I've never come off like I needed\nhelp and so when they saw that I needed\ntherapy I'm canceling towards like 9-1-1\nin my house you know as far as like my\nfamily and um so they were just like\nreally concerned\num but I think as far as the world's\nconcerned I do think the world is more\nopen and receptive to the idea of\nmen needing help and that's okay and\neven if they're not open to it that is\nnaturally where this is going like I\njust feel like the pendulum has to swing\nat some point and this whole idea that\nmen have to just be like you know\nmilitary men who show nothing no\nemotions and like figure it out and\ndon't ask for help and we do it\nourselves it's like\nthat is not sustainable you know it's\njust not men need to communicate and\ncollaborate with each other and you know\nnot feel so alone how have you found the\nreaction to that from like straight\nwomen do straight women find men more or\nless attractive or good partners based\non that kind of approach and\nvulnerability like I think it depends on\nthe woman and I think a lot of times\nthere's great women out there who will\nrespond well to that and there's women\nwho won't I think a lot of times with\nmen you know they are scared to show\nthat vulnerability because of what a lot\nof women have displayed which is like\nnow I'm not attracted to you that part\nyeah and it's like you know I said on um\nI set on enough on Santiago some women\nlooking at you lesser if there's tears\non your cheek but if there's tears\ntattooed that same girl is a freak so\nthey're attracted to the pain unless\nthey hear the pain speak so it's like\nit's really interesting because when you\nwhen you talk to when you talk to women\nthank you but it's like when you talk to\nwomen and you like kind of see where\ntheir heads at\nyou see that they kind of like a lot of\nwomen want this sort of rough and rugged\nguy who's like he's tough and all these\nthings\nbut like you don't want him to talk\nabout it because now he's soft but it's\nlike so you want him to have some pain\nbecause that's what makes him the rough\nand rugged you know but you just don't\nwant to hear about it and so where does\nhe go then\nit's oh so you just want him to be quiet\nbut then you're wondering why he can't\nopen up to you oh well he just doesn't\nopen up to me which one is it this isn't\nBuild-A-Bear you know what I mean like\nand I feel women too who it's like dudes\nwant to grow who does it yeah that's why\nit's like find someone that's compatible\nwith you and gets you and rock out and\nforget about the rest yeah but I love\nthe way you do I mean the lyric it\nspeaks for itself but that is summed up\nso well and by the way everyone is\nlistening I'm not trying to take sides\nor yeah you get where I'm coming from\nlike I'm just trying to come from a\nplace of like where are we it's exactly\nwhat Russia said like we want something\nto be tough but without the pain without\ntalking about the pain and it's like\nthat's just not real it doesn't exist\nthe idea that someone is tough\nand hasn't been through pain is\nnon-existent yeah and at some point that\nperson is going to need to express or\nconnect or collaborate as you said\neither with you or other people about\ntheir pain this also applies to women it\napplies to every gender that yeah people\nwho've been through pain are going to\nhave stories to tell yeah and if you\nwant someone tough chances are that\nthey've got grit and resilience because\nthey've had massive loss in their life\nso I think you just summed up that is\nexactly what I was trying to get to it's\nlike Kane is a prerequisite for being a\ntough hardened man hardened from what\nyou know hardened by what pain\nexperience so it's like I just I do\nthink it's really interesting for\num the group of women who want\nvulnerability and openness emotionally\nfrom men who they also almost shame into\nthinking that\nkeep your pain to yourself though yeah\nand then there's the other side I find I\nhave a lot of friends who are like my\nman doesn't open up right like I have a\nlot of friends who are like look I want\nto be there for him like I'm ready to\nlisten to him like I want him to be more\nopen about it well because men are\nscared that if they do oh wow never mind\nthis is unattractive yeah yeah because\nit goes against what we as men have been\ntaught makes a strong man it's not\npersonal to you it's how Society has set\nus up we've been brainwashed yeah you\nknow would you say yours is just you're\nso seeking the answers like what gave\nyou cut the courage to break that as\nsomeone who's a stage performer yeah\ncrushing it who has who has actually\neverything that 99 of men won yeah what\ngave you the was it Courage or was it\njust like I just need this like you know\nyeah it was out of desperation to be\nhonest and also I think like being\nisolated from society plays like a part\nin it like I'm not out and about I'm not\ntrying to be on the scene and make\nfriends I'd like there's a part of like\nbeing in my bubble that sort of gives me\nme that safety net of like okay if I'm\nvulnerable it's like who does that\nreally I'm not worried if that girl or\nthis person is gonna feel away like it's\nkind of just me you know how do you keep\nthat distance I feel like people\nstruggle with that even if they're not\nand then in entertainment yeah people\nget glued to social media they get\naddicted how are you keeping distance\nwhen you're so interconnected to the\nindustry in one sense I think it's also\njust a testament though to my fans I\nthink I've had like I'm really fortunate\nto have the kind of fans that I do that\nare actually supporters of me and from\nthe beginning I've tried to be as\nauthentic as I was in that moment and\nI've tried to be vulnerable and\nintrospective and I think\nall of that played a part and when I did\nhave to cancel tour and when I have let\nfans in on like the Journey of mental\nhealth and therapy than being open to it\nbecause\nthis isn't coming out of complete left\nfield as far as the introspection and\nthe vulnerability I'm a vulnerable\nartist\nI never was like that worried like if my\nmale fans would be like oh we're out\nbecause it's like y'all are singing\nlosing control yeah you know what I mean\nlike y'all are singing love songs and\nheartbreak songs so you know what I'm\nsaying straight up and it's like\neveryone's at a different place in their\njourney and like however like wherever\nyou're at is fine yeah I remember that\nwhen I was when I was a teenager when I\nthought I was when that's when I thought\nI was cool right it was like I was that\nkind of person that didn't understand\nhow someone could get depressed because\nI didn't get it like I was like that\nfour years ago it's like it's so bad\nyeah like what does that mean right like\nand then you go through your own stuff\nand you're like oh I get it now and I\nfound that for me I found that life has\nthis really strange way of making you go\nthrough things that you thought\nshouldn't affect any right so if you in\nyour head have an idea of like I don't\nunderstand that I don't know how that\naffects someone like just wait literally\nthat has happened to me so many times\nand so whenever now I have that thought\nI literally catch it and I go let's get\nrid of that thought because let me\nactually try and be curious about it\nrather than look at it in a\ncondescending way yeah because chances\nare if I see it in a derogatory way or a\nnegligent way I'm gonna have to\nexperience it just for life to teach me\nthat it's real yeah yeah I got humbled\nfor sure by um\nby that kind of thing where it's like I\nrealize back to me being omnipotent I\ngot humbled by realizing oh I don't know\neverything you know because I thought\nI'm never gonna get depressed what does\nthat even mean like what's that you know\nand then all of a sudden you're like\nOkay so this can happen to me yeah\ndescribe that for me what was that for\nyou like I think you hear and I think I\ncan ask you this because I feel like you\narticulate your thoughts so well and you\nreally get in there with what's going on\nlike\nif so many people have said this right\nthis idea of like you get the triple\nplatinum you get the money and it\ndoesn't work like what actually and I'm\nasking you because I feel like you get\nin there what is actually not working\nabout that like what is it about that\nthat doesn't help you feel better or\nsolve the void what is it why does it\nnot work because I think so many people\nsay that but then everyone goes oh yeah\nbut you're a millionaire you can say\nthat yeah but let's let's try to help\npeople out there because I still like if\nI if I prefer being financially safe\nand successful in doing what I love I do\nprefer that to when I was close to being\nbroke and not successful in what I did\nright I much prefer my life right now\nright but I also know that the thing\nthat gives gives me deep meaning and\nkeeps me going is my purpose that's\nconnected to my work like as long as I\nfeel I'm positively impacting people\nyeah I'm serving people and I'm using my\nvoice to make a difference in people's\nlives that is what actually makes me\nhappy yeah and then what happens around\nit is like the best bonus of all time\nyeah see that's a good value to have\nthough is like in good perspective for\nme the plaques and whatever it's not\nworking is really just because you're\nclearly or I was clearly seeking\nvalidation\nsubconsciously and I thought that\nbecoming a big artist and plaques and\nall that was going to make me feel\nvalidated and make me feel like I belong\nand make me feel approved\nand make me feel good enough and when I\ngot all that and I still had all of\nthose issues that's what I mean by it\nnot working and I agree too like I\nprefer my life now than than the\nalternative but the hole is still there\nand I think at 17 when I started like\nreally going after this\num I don't know if I had the depth\nand the awareness to know what I was\ngoing after like I'm chasing approval\nand validation but\num when I look back I can pinpoint\ncertain behaviors in certain times in\nthe studio or whatever where I was like\nwell I can tell I wanted people to\nvalidate me\nand I want and I thought that rap in the\nindustry was gonna Pat me on the back\nyou know and that's kind of what I talk\nabout and I love you boy which is like\nyou know I just I replaced my dad with\nthe industry\nwhich is really like wild right because\nI felt like as a kid wanting just\napproval of your dad as a son you know\nwhen you don't get it you can feel like\nostracized kind of and just like you\ndon't belong you're not good enough in\nall these things and it's so strange\nthat as a white guy what I chose to pick\nto replace my dad to give me approval\nwas a craft that\nI'm not that I'm ostracizing off off bad\nyou know what I mean it's like it's like\nI picked the hardest thing to get\napproval from like I've replaced my dad\nwithin industry and started to rap I\nwant to praise and acknowledgment and\npick the profession that people who look\nlike me don't get you know what I mean\nso it's like it was almost like I guess\nif I could like analyze where my head\nwas at when I was 17.\nmaybe because it's like if I could get\napproval from this thing that I love\nthis genre this lifestyle this whole\nculture then I'm officially approved you\nknow because I know how hard it is to\nget approval from that and I don't know\nit just it but it really stems from once\nagain not having the self-approval and\nthe self-validation and thinking that\nsomeone else is going to give it to you\nand I remember talking with my therapist\nand he was like uh oh I think I said\nlike\nyeah but you know if I do get a number\none album or a number when go number one\non the Billboard Hot 100 and this person\nsays I'm great I'm sure like I'll feel\nreally good he's like you probably will\nfor about 20 minutes and then I think\nyou'll have your lowest moment of your\nlife\nyou know and I agree you know because\nwhen I have gotten crazy accomplishments\nit lasts for not that long and I'm right\nback to like I'm lower because that's\nanother thing on the list that didn't do\nit that's another thing that didn't fill\nthe hole you know Forbes list nope\nPlatinum nope buy Mom house nope like\nnone of it you know I see what you're\nsaying and I won't be I want that to\nregister with people because\nwhat Russ is doing which I appreciate is\nclarifying the difference it's great in\nand of itself yeah it just doesn't fill\nthe hole inside like it doesn't solve\nthe fact that I don't feel better about\nwho I am and myself it's beautiful to\nbuy your mama house that's awesome like\nyeah it's good for her it's great like\nthat that's not the point the point is\nit doesn't change how I feel yeah about\nmy level of self-worth right and\nself-esteem yeah the point is like if if\nI thought that buying my mama house and\nmaking the Forbes list and going\nPlatinum was going to make me feel\nvalidated approved and like I'm good\nenough then that's the mistake yeah yeah\nthat's where you're going to feel\nemptier than ever because you're going\nto do that and that's not what's going\nto do it yeah you know what's really\ninteresting for me listening to you is\nso I'm kind of like where you're at with\nyour parents where I love both my\nparents and independently and in the\nsame way\nI have a good relationship with both of\nthem today\nand but but it wasn't always it wasn't\nthat way externally and with my dad\nespecially so my dad didn't validate me\nor even support me when I was growing up\nlike he would if he turned up to a swim\ncompetition because I used to swim a lot\nwhen I'd look up at the stands he'd be\nreading his newspaper wow so or if I was\nI played rugby for my school and it was\none of my favorite things that I made it\nonto my school's rugby team I used to be\na lot bigger growing up and he would\nnever turn up to support me and so my\ndad wasn't there and that was really\ninteresting because at the time it made\nme just want to get approval of my\nfriends and like be cool and whatever\nand that leads you to do all sorts of\ndumb stuff yeah but what It ultimately\nled me to was I got to make my own rules\nof what success were so not getting his\nver he never had a version of success\nfor me right like he almost had didn't\nhave like this is what you have to be to\nbe successful right and so I've always\nseen it as I just got freedom to Define\nwhat kind of man I wanted to be yeah\nbecause my dad didn't really Define what\nkind of man he cared I would be right\nand it's really interesting now because\nwhen I look at my relationship with him\ntoday he's more like a friend than he is\nmy dad because he wasn't really\nfathering me and I think where I got\nreally lucky like this really was was\nlike one of those moments when you feel\nfortunate is I projected that lack of\nfatherhood fortunately onto the monks oh\nso I like because that wasn't what I was\nmeant to be and I wasn't spiritual and I\nreally look at that as like I didn't\nhave any positive realm role models in\nmy life I didn't have any positive male\nrole models in my life and the monks\nwere positive male role models and I met\nthem at when I was 18 years old so\nimportant so it's so important and the\ncrazy thing about them is they don't\nvalidate you wow so it was like even\nmore challenging but it's like you see\nan amazing role model who's showing you\nthe right way but is not trying to\nfalsely validate or approve you so you\nstill have to you still have to delete\nyourself you still have to do this\nthey're teaching you what you just said\nhow to do it yourself yeah like that\nit's still you on your own you got to\nlive in your own mind and and when you\nrealize that it's like yeah I live in my\nown mind yeah these are my thoughts yeah\nwhat you just said earlier I either have\nto I either I'm translating my dad's\nvoice yeah into becoming my voice right\nor I'm actually going to choose what I\nwant my thoughts to be right and and\nthat's what they were training Us in so\nthrough so much Fortune I got to that\npoint yeah and even till this day I'm\nconstantly just practicing that because\nagain I haven't perfected it I still get\ninto the place where you start hearing\nthe noise it's so funny because that's\nwhy I ended the album with just me\nsinging it was you all along because all\nthese things I'm chasing validation love\napproval uh patience all of it is things\nthat I have to give myself and I just I\nthought that everything and everyone\nelse was gonna give it to me tell me\nsome of the ways you've been giving it\nto yourself because you are getting like\nyou said like a lot of people get to the\npoint you've got to when they're\nunsuccessful so like they wait till the\nrecord's now not getting the downloads\nand the streams and like they're not\nreally winning the stuff and things\naren't going well and then you go oh\nthis wasn't it you're realizing it while\nthings are hot right like things are\ngood you've got a new album dropping the\nmusic sounds great by the way I wanted\nto say like I I agree I was thankful\nthat your team sent me that of course\nthe album before and it's like I can't\nwait to play it more and more and I\ncan't wait for everyone to hear it\nmusic's awesome and I just go you're\nwinning and you realize is there like\nwhat are some of the things you're doing\nto validate yourself like what are you\ndoing it's like that's what I'm still\nworking on yeah you know what are some\nof the practices that\nI think\num you know it's having good values is\none of them uh values that like\nI can control you know uh I think\nhonoring the gift is important\ncelebrating myself and I think a way\nthat I've celebrated myself which makes\nme feel good about myself is to honor my\ngift and so for example like going to\nthe gym for me to lose 30 pounds of fat\nnot muscle right 30 pounds of fat is\ncrazy\num I did it through shame do you need to\nlose weight you know and just talking\ncrazy to myself and it still worked but\nI lost the weight and I still didn't\nfeel good about myself I still had a\nbreakdown you know\num and so now I'm looking at going to\nthe gym as I'm celebrating my health and\nmy body I'm honoring the gift of being\nalive and being mobile you know and\ncelebrating the gift of of my creativity\nby going to the studio instead of\nlooking at going to the studio like I\nneed to catch a hit otherwise I'm a\nloser it's like nah I'm celebrating\nmyself every time I go to the studio\nit's a celebration that's that's already\na great mindset yeah it's better than\nwhere I was at no but I think what we\ndon't realize is even if critical\njudgmental negative motivation works\nyeah the problem is now that's all you\nhave in your toolkit yeah to motivate\nyourself right so when you've lost the\nweight you wanted to lose you're now\nmotivating yourself still through that\ncriticism judgment and right like\ntalking down to yourself and even with\nthe music I love what you just said you\nfeel so much more abundant yeah when you\nwalk into something and you go I'm just\nhere because I'm grateful to be alive\nI'm happy to be here as opposed to God\nif I don't write the next here and I\nknow so many musicians that say that to\nme and music is the hardest Place yeah\nand I feel like I have so many people in\nmy life that are friends that feel that\npressure because again like you said\nit's the pressure they're hearing from\ntheir management right their team their\nfans their fans potentially if they're\nnot connected to them you're going to\nbecome irrelevant yeah never be as big\nas so and so right didn't you see what\nthey just did like and so if you don't\nhave that healthy dialogue internally\nand I do think it is that for me as well\nit's like I spend\nI spend so much time alone\njust to monitor my internal dialogue\nscary because it's the only way it's\nterrible because when I'm alone yeah I\ncan truly choose and program the\nthoughts in my mind yeah whereas if I'm\nconstantly surrounded by people and\nnoise it's natural that it's gonna seep\nin well sometimes the noise distracts us\nfrom looking in because looking at is\nscary that's what I was doing I think\nthat's the biggest reason why people\ndon't want to spend time of course\nespecially men because like\nwe once again know that or we have like\nbelieved that our emotions are relevant\nand ignore them you know be like just\ncompletely avoid feeling anything and\nthat's what makes you a man and so I\nthink spending time alone in meditation\nand doing like you know personal work is\na very like it feels feminine to men it\nfeels soft and the the like something\ninteresting that I stumbled on is like\nhow strong of a man are you and how\nBrave of a man are you if you're scared\nto face yourself wow yeah yeah that's\nthe real bravery yeah sit in a room with\nyourself that's like that's courageous\nyeah I think it goes back to what you\nwere saying earlier that\nit's the Perfection and positivity issue\nthat we keep thinking that everything\nhas to be like positive and sunny\nand when I look inside of myself\nI see tons of a dark side and stuff that\nI don't want to see but I also know that\nthat's not me because of how we were\ntrained the idea that\nyou know the concept in all of the monk\nteachings is that the sun is always\nshining it's just often covered by\nclouds and so when you look up at the\nsky all you see is the clouds you don't\nsee the Sun and you think I am the\nclouds wow so when you look at your\nthoughts you see the Cloudy thoughts and\nyou think I'm Darkness yeah but actually\nthe sun's always there it's just you\ncan't see it and so the light that me\nand you are the light that everyone is\nlistening and watching is is always\nthere it's just we're just seeing all\nthe dirt and the clouds and the rain and\nthe you know and we then judge it and\nsee it as negative rather than the fact\nthat hey wait a minute I'm just I'm just\ngonna find the light and I understand\nthat sometimes it's going to be a cloudy\nday just like it is outdoors yeah and\nthat's what led me to feeling like a\nfraud that's that song's amazing that's\nwhat that is is because looking at the\ncloud thinking you are the cloud and so\nthen when people give you a compliment\nyou're like they're giving you a\ncompliment on you being the son and for\nme I'm like if only you knew I was a\ncloud I would look at my shadow self and\nthe parts of me that I'm ashamed of it\nwould make it impossible for me to\nreceive love and compliments or anything\npositive also tied in with feeling like\na fraud was me having to analyze well\nwhy did my parents getting divorce\nactually affect me why did the hate\ncoming in actually affect me because on\nSurface it felt so vapid like your\nparents broke up and people don't like\nyou big deal right but when I through\ntherapy and through really growing down\nthat's when I learned like okay hold on\nsince I was a kid my role and my\nidentity came from being the savior of\nmy family emotionally you know and I\ntalk about it on I love you boy when my\ndad was very reactive and my mom was\nlike fatalistic and I was just the one\nrunning around knocking on everyone's\ndoor to make sure like everyone was good\nafter a big fight or whatever you know\nbecause I was I was worried genuinely\nworried so the stakes were super high\nthey felt like life or death you know\nlike maybe there was going to be\nself-harm or something and so my\nidentity was tied to saving my family\nand helping them so when my parents got\ndivorced it was the ultimate blow to my\nidentity of being the Savior it wasn't\njust like your parents broke up bro\nyou're 23 to get over it was like who am\nI if I if my parents break up who am I\nif I can't save us right and then with\nthe hate coming in\nI got my self-worth from being approved\nand liked by everyone and so when I got\nhate and a lot of it it wasn't just you\nhave haters get over it it was who am I\nif people don't like me so it just\nthat's what threw me for a spin it was I\nfeel like a fraud that is so deep yeah\nyour identity is based on the roles you\nplayed right and if you can no longer\nplay that role who am I then who is what\nis your identity right and that's where\nit's hard because that means going back\nto what you said earlier which was\nreally powerful is that your values is\nthe best place to start because your\nvalues are something you can control if\nyou only value yourself for a role you\nplay for other people which you don't\ncontrol right now that's not your value\nright and when they break up well it\ngoes astray you don't know who you are\nanymore that is devastating blow yeah\nyeah especially when I didn't know why I\nwas so upset by it you know I was like\nthis shouldn't be effective I'm 24 25\nlike what's the big deal yeah but it\njust didn't go away and then it was\nfunny that like the hate and them\ndivorcing came at the same time and now\nwhen I look back I'm like this was all\nlike by Design you know this was all to\nHelp Me Grow down but yeah it's like you\nknow when you when you've gotten your\nidentity from a role that you've been\nplaying for so long and that role is\ntaken away from you or threatened it's\nlike yeah who are you you said that\nphrase twice just now growing down not\ngrowing up yeah what does that mean\nbecause I like that I think a lot of\ntimes in my career I was just focused on\nlike external growth and like am I\ngetting more followers am I getting more\nmoney am I getting more plaques and am I\ngrowing up you know and I wasn't focused\non growing down into like the core of\nwho I am getting to the to the root of\nit and to the truth of myself and that's\nwhat I've been trying to do that's what\nthis album is Is Like Me growing down\ntrying to like get deeper and deeper\ninto who I actually am you know because\nI'm just trying to operate from a place\nof authenticity and truth and it's hard\nto feel authentic and be authentic when\nyou're operating from a place of Shame\nlike I'm ashamed of who I am\nand I'm insecure about who I am so how\ncan I be authentic because authentic\nwhen being authentic with me and being\ninsecure and being and it's like I can't\nbe that yeah especially in rap you know\nwhat I mean so it's like gotta mask it\ngotta be omnipotent you know\nwhat was the darkest and scariest thing\nyou saw when you started growing down I\nthink the biggest thing I the like\ndarkest thing and thought I had was like\nI don't like myself\nthat was like the heaviest and what was\nit that you didn't like about yourself I\nwas ashamed\nabout how\nI've handled my career\nI was very mad about at like 23 year old\nme I would beat him up daily\num I was mad about you know me being\nreactive towards people\nI just didn't like anything about you\nknow myself and that was a real low\npoint of like once again fraud if only\nthe world knew you know and I've\nself-help book right and I mentioned\nthat on fraud as well it's like\nwho am I like to try to give people a\nbook like and for me the book so\nsuccessful and has helped a lot of\npeople but I look back at that book I'm\nlike it's like VAP it to me now you know\nand I'm glad it's helping people but and\nI shouldn't I shouldn't denounce any\nversion of me that's like I'm you're\nwatching in real time what I do and um\nyeah that's the that's the heaviest\ndarkest thing that I've come to terms\nwith not that it's a reality of mine\nthat I want to come to terms with but\ngetting to a place of like I don't I\ndon't like myself that was the lowest\npoint I love what you just said that\nit's like being authentic means being\nable to accept that I feel insecure\nright and that that lost version of me\njust got me through that\nright and that doesn't make it good or\nbad but it was a reality but we think\nbeing authentic means being like smooth\nand like right organized what I've\nlearned in therapy is the admission of\ninsecurity and feeling nervous is step\none because\nwhat happened to me and I think what\nhappens to a lot of people is rejecting\nyour insecurities leads to\nself-destruction so for example like I\nused to do interviews super drunk right\nwhy because I was nervous and insecure\nabout just being my authentic self I\ndidn't know how to be that version so I\nwould drink to knock the edge off so\nlike the the rejecting of my insecurity\nled to self-destructive habits and\noverall a result that I don't like you\nknow so yeah I think just sitting in\nyour insecurities and and and saying\nthat it's okay to be insecure and feel\nnervous yeah and I think for me it's\nlike nah like especially as men like no\nI'm not allowed to like we got to be the\nman you know yeah yeah yeah I often like\neven when I if I ever end up I don't go\nto many parties or events and things\nlike that but if I ever have to or I do\ngo for a specific purpose\nand it was someone it was what he was on\nthe Trevor Noah interview when Trevor\ncame on the show he said to me goes Jay\nyou always seem really comfortable\nwhenever I see you somewhere and I was\nlike that's because I only really go to\nplaces I have a purpose like I was like\nif I don't have a purpose there I was\nlike have you ever see me uncomfortable\nit's because I don't have a purpose then\nI don't know what I'm doing there yeah\nand I I had a couple of those last year\nwhich we talked about is funny enough my\nmy team was like oh you should\ndefinitely go to this event it's really\nimportant and stuff and so I went along\nand I just felt really it's like\ninsecure there and useless because I\ndidn't have a role I didn't have a\npurpose yeah I wasn't representing what\nI believe I got it obviously I was\nrepresenting myself but I mean I wasn't\nthere to represent anything bigger yeah\nthan me showing up and I found that when\nI do feel like that I just go up to one\nother person that I feel I could connect\nwith and just be like hey I'm are you\nfeeling insecure too because I am and\nit's that's you and it's amazing because\neveryone's feeling insecure like\nespecially at like these big events yeah\nthat like no one there's no one no\nmatter how cool you think anyone is\nthere is no one who's at an award show\nor an event or a party or anything that\nis feeling anything but insecure right\nI've not met them at least right and\ndoesn't that break the wall down\nliterally completely like as soon as you\ndo that it's like it goes away it's the\nresisting the insecurity that has\neveryone on edge and they're looking at\nyou and you seem to have it all the way\nto get together meanwhile you're\npanicking inside yeah and now they feel\nlike well I Gotta Have It All the Way\ntogether and we're all tense and just\nlike acting yeah and if we could just be\nlike hey is everyone nervous like it's\nalmost like let's all stand here naked\nlike that's what that does emotionally\nyou know what I mean it's like all right\ncool now let's like now let's continue\nyeah yeah and that happens you know like\nyou know it happens in family events it\nhappens at weddings it happens at\nholiday events like it happens in normal\nlife you don't this isn't just about the\nentertainment industry like it happens\neverywhere yeah and I fully agree with\nyou that it's because we're just\nresisting in your in your words like\nresisting that insecurity yeah what's an\ninsecurity that you are resisting for\nthe long longest time like what would\nyou say was an insecurity that you've\njust been holding on to for not uh\nfeeling like I don't belong\nthat's probably like one of the biggest\nones being a white guy in rap in hip-hop\num with no cosine within the culture to\nsort of make me feel like I do belong it\nwas it was a massive insecurity of mine\nand I just came in guns blazing\nlike I don't need any y'all look uh and\nit's like deep down you wanted everyone\nthough yeah you wanted help deep down\nyou know but you masked it by well if\nI'm not gonna get it I'll do it myself\nand that became like a really big like\nbrand and motto for me and I don't think\npeople understand that my song do it\nmyself and that energy it was survival\nit wasn't like if you have people\nwilling to help you should tell them no\nit was I didn't have help I wish I did\nbut I didn't so I had to do it myself as\nto anyone who's ever reached out in the\nindustry that you feel has\nnot co-signed obviously but like giving\nyou a bit of that kind of nurturing or\nas it has it still always been kind of\nlike I'm making I think I've met a lot\nof great people in the industry who have\ngiven me validation and like you're\ngreat you're dope but like yeah I mean\nI've never been like taken under\nsomeone's Wing yeah you know it was\nalways just kind of like me and my\nmanager just like going at this thing\nyou know and um\nI'm trying to be more proud of my\nyounger self as much as I want to beat\nhim up for how he like was omnipotent in\na maniac but it's like for what you were\ngoing through\nthat you crushed you know like I don't\nknow how you did all that and and that's\nwhat I love you boy that song is about\nespecially on that third verse where\nit's like you know saying you deserve a\npat on the back you know it's just like\nI've never given myself a pat on the\nback and I wanted to take that song to\nlike as an opportunity to give myself\nthe much needed you know pat on the back\nyeah and compassion inspired by that\nsong if you saw like if you were If\ninstead of me your younger self was\nsitting in front of me this is a therapy\nexercise\ninstead of me of your younger self was\nsitting in front of you right now like\nsitting in this seat what does he need\nto hear not advice but what does he need\nto hear what does he need to hear he\nneeds to hear that\nyou're okay you're safe\nand I got you that's what he needs to\nhear and what do you think he'd say back\nprobably I don't need your help yeah\nit's really interesting how like what I\nthink all of us need from ourselves is\njust more compassion and more grace and\nthe younger version of me needs that so\nbad needed that so bad and I didn't get\nit and he didn't know how to receive\nthat help and receive that compassion\num and I don't know if you know if I was\ntalking to him he rejected the help and\ncompassion I would just keep trying\nbecause I know that's what he really\nneeds and he just wants to feel safe\nlike he belongs like it's going to be\nokay like he's allowed to make mistakes\nyou know that's the other thing once\nagain being a perfectionist it's like it\nreally is like hindering when it comes\nto\neverything like accepting help because\nonce again help is coded as criticism as\na perfectionist feeling good about\nanything you've done because you could\nhave always done better so you didn't\nquite nail your standard of perfection\nand I just think like that's what I'm\ntrying to get to now is be like giving\nmyself more grace and I talk about it on\nTunnel Vision where I say I want to stop\nthinking that I got to go through hell\nto get the credit I desperately need to\ngive to myself you know you can just do\nthis an easier way\nit's also hard being a high performer\nwho gives Grace to themselves yeah\nbecause that's the hard part right it's\nlike I want to perform at the best\nbut I know I need to be nice to myself\nbut I can't be too nice because I'm too\nnice to myself then I can't perform like\nthe best and it's like this fight inside\nof you yeah I think it it comes down to\nkind of what you were saying earlier\nwhere it's like if your toolkit is only\nshame and like dark motivation then\nyou're just gonna use that and it's not\nsustainable I think for me the light\nmotivation is like\nyou know I love what I'm doing you know\nwhen I'm on stage I love the fans I love\nperforming and as long as I did my best\nI have to be okay with that yeah you\nknow I can say okay you know I know I\ncan do better than that but tonight I\ndid my best and it's easier said than\ndone like I'm working on that but I\nthink that's the place to start it's\njust knowing like\ndid you do your best with the resources\nthat you had and to think that you were\nsupposed to just be this all-knowing\nentity yeah it's like that's arrogance\nyou know but that's why I would beat\nmyself up a lot I was like how did you\nnot know\nyou know but it's like you're allowed to\nnot know everything that's powerful yeah\nthat's powerful actually to look back\nand think I wouldn't have done anything\nbut I'm glad that yeah I had to just go\nthrough that and that's who I was back\nthen those were like I base my decisions\nin the past off of what I knew back then\nand what felt true to me back then what\nfelt authentic and with the reservoir of\nknowledge I had back then that's what I\nbased my decisions off of obviously now\nseven years later ten years whatever it\nis I would make different decisions but\nit's like I can't be mad at 23 year old\nme that he didn't know what 30 year old\nme yeah yeah it's so hard for me to not\nwant to beat him up like you're such an\nidiot all you had to do was like read\nthis one book and you would have even\nbeen better off you know sometimes it\nfeels like the answer was right there\nbut that's what it is right like we have\nthis habit as humans where we judge\nourselves off of one conversation one\nevent one performance one song one\nmeeting and what's really interesting\nthing is about that is that we then\nproject that onto other people where we\njudge them yeah on one song One Moment\nOne interaction rather than looking at\nsomeone as this right story of a human\nand it's it's fascinating to me that you\nwould never ever pick up a book and read\none page and judge the whole book you no\none really does that right you would\nread some of the book at least yeah but\nit's like with ourselves and with others\nwe don't see them as a story we see them\nas a page yeah and right so true it's so\nbrutal though it's so brutal it's so\nbrutal I do it to myself and I think I\nthink in the world of social media too\nyou're not allowed to make mistakes your\none mistake is the book that just tells\nme everything I need to know about you\nand how you treat yourself because I\nknow like I tend to be and this is like\nnot a great thing a very judgmental\nperson\nand I justify it by saying relax I judge\nmyself too it's like that's not good\nthough yeah you know and it's but I do\nwhat you said I look at one event and be\nlike you don't deserve anything because\nof that one combo or that one tweet or\nthat one yeah not realizing that at that\npoint that was where that person was\nright right and actually we open people\nup to change including ourselves when we\nrecognize that our capacity for change\ncan increase yeah right if you look back\nat an event like you're saying and\nyou're like I actually appreciate that's\nwhat I knew then I I didn't do something\nI was proud of but that's all I knew\nthen yeah now that I I think there's a\nfamous Maya Angelou quote where she says\nthat now that I know better I do better\nright and the idea of\nif you don't accept\nthat that's possible for you and others\nthat's what actually keeps you in prison\nbecause you keep saying no no that's who\nyou are right that event 10 years ago is\nwho you are and that's who you'll ever\nbe so tough that's so true it's time but\nI mean in social media you're not\nallowed to change your mind that also\nkeeps people especially celebrities and\npeople in the public eye like into this\nprison where it's like no no no\nwhat you said you believed what you said\n10 days a little ten years ago you\nbetter still believe that or you're fake\nlike and it's crazy because you're\nallowed to change your mind and not only\nare you allowed to change your mind\nyou're supposed to change your mind\nyou're supposed to now have a new belief\nsystem\nit's not like Rick Rubin talked about it\nwith you and I thought it was so spot on\nit's like if you still like have the\nsame beliefs you did 20 years ago upon\nlearning new things and you're not\ngrowing like you know but\nI think that's why you got to like\nremove yourself from social media and\nwhat the world in the Mob of the\ninternet and stop trying to reconcile\nwith them reconcile with yourself and\ngive yourself the permission to change\nyour mind yeah yeah I've what's\nsomething you think that you have\nchanged your mind on\nfrom let's say like\nmaybe 10 years ago or maybe if you need\nto go back longer 20 years ago like I'll\nshare one of mine mine was when I was\nyoung I didn't because I grew up in this\nmindset I believe that\npeople who had money had to do something\ndodgy to get money yes because that's\nthe language that I was raised in like\nwe always heard that like oh yeah but he\ndoesn't pay his taxes right if I saw a\nnice car and I'd be like my family would\nbe like oh yeah yeah but they always do\nthat dodgy business on the side and so\nin my head anyone who had money must be\ndoing something wrong to have money\nand that not only did that limit me from\nappreciating others or admiring or\nlearning from those people it blocked me\nfrom thinking that was good for me and\npossible for me right because you would\nhave had to do that because\nI was a good person so I don't I'm not\ngoing to do anything I'll never do\nanything bad so so you'll never get\nmoney so you know your money yeah\nexactly right and and then you all of a\nsudden start realizing we're like you\nneed to meet and this is why I feel\nthat's why I love the podcast because I\nwant to show people or show sides of\npeople or let people show sides of\nthemselves where people can go oh that\nis possible I can be a rapper yeah and\ngo to therapy like I can I can be you\nknow I can be someone who makes songs\nabout this this and work on myself like\nthat there is an and as opposed to like\nthis you know yeah exactly so for me\nthat was a big one for me of recognizing\nthat you can make money with Integrity\nyou could use it in service you could it\ncould be used proactively for purpose\nand that was a massive limiting belief\nin a negative belief I had what was\nsomething for you that you that you\nchanged your mind on I think the big\nthing for me was\num thinking that I was always right oh\nthat's a good that's the biggest one for\nme because I was operating in this place\nonce again of omnipotence just that I\nknew everything everything I did was\nright every decision I've ever made was\nright because\nlook at my life clearly everything I've\never done was right in everything I say\nis Right everything I know so\nI got to a place now where I'm so much\nmore Curious and I'm so much more\nhumble in the sense of like I'm open to\nbeing wrong because it's like I believe\nwhat I believe but I'm open to changing\nmy mind I'm open to someone else telling\nme their beliefs and me being\nopen-minded and curious about it I'm\nopen to not always being right and I\nthink that is a much better like\nstarting place and that's it's really\ninteresting because everything we're\nsaying is basically that Paradox of like\nwe were saying you want to be ambitious\nbut you gotta have Grace for yourself\nyou want to be you want to know your\nvalues but you want to be open to\nlearning more and changing them and it's\nalmost like everything is this and I\nthink that's where we struggle the most\nbecause whether it was parenting whether\nit was school whether it was\nour background we were always told that\nthere was one right answer right right\nlike you had to get us in the back of\nthe book yeah exactly yeah yeah and it's\nlike there's one right answer that\neveryone has to get to and if you're one\nmark off the answer then it's the wrong\nanswer and the truth is that life is so\nvariegated it is so gray it is as you\njust said even when you were talking\nearlier you were like there's so many\nlayers to this yeah so it's like one\nanswer is material stuff doesn't make\nyou happy right but it's like when you\nbroke down the layers of like actually\nwhy did my parents divorce make me\nunhappy is because this actually like\neverything is so layered but I feel like\nwe haven't I don't know if our brain our\nbrain almost needs not an app but our\nbrain needs the ability\nto be able to understand how everything\nis so multi-layered yeah but we're so\nit's so much easier to just put someone\nin a box and and go that's what I'm\njudging and just be more flexible yeah\nand I think uh Atomic habits talks about\nlike keeping your identity small and I\nthought it was so genius talks about you\nknow there's athletes who their identity\nis I'm an athlete I am a point guard and\nwhat happens when you're not playing\nbasketball anymore though and they have\nthis identity crisis and sometimes it\ngets really you know severe\nand he talks about how like instead of\nsaying I'm an athlete how about saying\nI'm a hard worker who you know works\nwell with teams and did it and so that\nyou can still get you can still apply\nwhat your strengths are from being an\nathlete into other aspects of your life\nafter being an athlete is done and I\nthought that was so powerful because\nit's so easy to get tied up into I'm a\nrapper or I'm a this or I'm a that and\nyou start trying to like do things based\noff of the perception of yourself\nand I just think being more flexible you\nknow and not being so rigid on who you\nare and just you know be open what's\nsomething that you were very\nI guess\ninflexible about I'm flexible about and\nnow that you've become more flexible\nabout in your identity I think being a\nman\nand being what I thought\nthat means like being start not showing\nany emotion not showing like anything is\naffecting me\num not receiving help do it in myself\nall these things like that to me is the\nmost valuable thing that I'm now\nflexible on is because I've learned that\nthere's strength and vulnerability in\ntheir strength in being honest and their\nstrength in collaboration you know\nlearning from a positive male role model\nwho's older than you and just can give\nyou you know new wisdom new knowledge\nit's like there's strength and\ncollaboration I think we've talked about\nit in therapy it was just documentary\nthat my therapist was talking about like\nand he was talking about how like alpha\nmales who lead\nby dominance via like fear are often\nlike exiled or killed\nand the ones who lead through\ncollaboration and cohesion like\nlike exhibit peace and like people love\nthem and it's so funny because I think\ngrowing up like we would idolize those\nmale figures who were the like just\ndominant you know just invoke fear and\nall these things and I'm just trying to\nhelp myself and I'm also trying to help\nmy fans and then on a real real specific\nlevel I'm trying to be\na lighthouse for young men that can look\nat me and say you know what I don't have\nto have it all figured out\nbecause he doesn't and if he's allowed\nto make mistakes I'm allowed to make\nmistakes I'm trying to get men and\npeople to just be nicer to themselves\nhave more compassion have more Grace I\nlove what you were saying about leaders\nbecause\nI feel like there is that perception\nthat leaders have to be stoic and strong\nand cold yeah and it was really\ninteresting to me because I'm still\nclose with my monk teachers and like\nthey're the kind of people that like\nwould come and sit in the back on the\nfloor of a class and listen to a young\nmonk give a talk yeah and that was\nconsidered humility and the strength of\na leader was like they weren't enforcing\ntheir Authority right like they would\nalways say like a real leader doesn't I\nwould always hear them say this like a\nreal leader doesn't demand respect they\ncommand it right it's just it's natural\nfor them they don't have to walk into\nthe room and all eyes on me they don't\nhave to do something big to gain\nattention they actually would come on\nand put the spotlight on you right but\nit's interesting because that isn't our\ngeneral belief around leaders we almost\nwant to be pushed around and moved\naround to think someone's powerful right\nit's almost like if someone's kind and\ngracious you kind of think of them as\nlike a soft a softer\nand so I think there's so much rewiring\nthat almost needs to go on into what is\nhealthy leadership or I know and I'm not\nlike the epitome of no no where neither\nof you should be looking but it's like I\nagree I think there's a rewiring that\nhas to happen on what it means to be a\nman and I think men need to also stop\nlooking for what it means to be a man\nfrom women and women need to stop even\ncaring what men say when it comes to\nwhat does it mean to be a woman it's we\ndon't know each other's experiences you\nknow men need more male collaboration\npositive male collaboration positive\nrole models and I think it's what you\nsaid earlier like knowing that we're\nwrong if we are sitting with someone to\nlearn about them to actually go into it\ngoing I probably don't know right what\nyou're going through right now right and\nI'm probably wrong right as opposed to\nlike yeah I already know I've got you\nfigured out like all men are like this\nor women are like this or or whatever it\nmay be which which is kind of how we\nlive in the world what does anything do\nyou sleep well what keeps you up at\nnight I sleep well now I gotta Aura ring\noh nice yeah I like the ordering yeah\nI'm uh I don't know I'm 30 now I'm\ntrying to like be in bed by you know\nmidnight dude you'll get I'm 30 I'm 36\nthis year and I've been I sleep at like\n9 30 p.m that's beautiful yeah it's so\ngood I haven't go to sleep at like 9 50\ngetting like eight hours of sleep I feel\nlike waking up going on walks I'm like\nwho am I this is crazy how does it feel\nto have hit 30 in 31 soon if like even\nSantiago this feels like my debut album\nbecause it just feels like this is a\nversion of myself that has not been\nshown to the world and I still feel as\nyoung as I ever felt but I just feel\nlike I know myself more I'm more\ncomfortable with myself I'm living in\nmore of my truth and authenticity and\nI'm excited like I just feel\nI feel blessed to make it out of my 20s\nalive you know without any like drug\nproblems or anything because looking\nback I'm like I can see you know reasons\nfor numbing the pain you know but um\nyeah I'm excited I also love the uh you\nknow I was watching you I'm always\nfollowing everything you're up to and I\nlove the way you talk to the fans when\nyou're on stage and when you post from\nit but also how you've been encouraging\nso many young artists to like jump on\ntracks and like be a part of the music\nyeah through Tick Tock and everything\nelse and like I think that's so dope man\nbecause I it just I think there was I\nthink there was one when you do with\nCaitlyn right yeah and it was just like\nI I just found that whole approach to be\nso true to how you came up yeah and what\nyou do and like being able to pass down\nhow does that feel to be able to now\nlike it's it's incredible I feel like\nI've said it before to like my friends\nand and people like you don't really\nfeel the power of your platform or the\npower of your money until you give it\naway and see how it affects someone who\nmaybe doesn't have that it sort of like\nsnaps you out of it for a second it\nsnaps you into really what you've built\nbut yeah I mean for me like the you know\nthe approach on Tick Tock and putting\nCaitlyn on the song it's like it's a\nno-brainer like and that's where like\nI'm glad I don't have an ego in that\nsense and in that field it's like if I'm\nputting up a song and someone is\naffected by it enough to want to do\ntheir own version and people love it and\nI think it sounds good why would I not\njust like make that a thing yeah just\nlike this is the entertainment business\nand it's like meaning we're in the\nbusiness of people enjoying what you're\ndoing\nthis is a cheat code they've already\nsaid that they enjoy it just give it to\nthem it's like yeah I thought it was\ndope I love it thank you yeah she's\ngreat very incredible yeah very talented\nwhere you just mentioned the ego that\nwhere does the ego still block you\nsometimes like you're like that's\nsomewhere where I don't have an ego\nwhere is it I don't have a how would you\ndescribe the ego it's a great question\nbecause then I could answer yeah yeah\nit's a great it's a great question\nthat's why I want to give you a very\nthoughtful answer I would say that the\nego is\nany moment in which you create a false\nsense of security\num\nso you're creating a false sense of\nbeing safe as opposed to an arrogant\nblah blah that's because those are all\nultimately it's a false self-defense\nmechanism yeah so like for example with\nmy wife it's like if my wife tells me\nsomething that I know is blatantly true\nmy ego will even construct something\nwhere I'm like oh yeah but this happened\nbefore and this and it's like I'm\nconstructing a TR I'm what I'm saying is\ntrue it's factual but I'm still using it\njust to defend my ego yeah because I'm\nscared of just saying like you know that\nyou're wrong yeah oh I do that all the\ntime yeah yeah so the wrong part's true\nbut like yeah where where do you create\na false sense of safety in your life or\na false sense of security I think trying\nto constantly\nsave my mom emotionally and take on my\nfamily's emotions as my responsibility\nbecause without me doing that they're\nnot safe\nis like a really big\nCrux of like my stress\nyou know\nand it's not on them it's on me and\nit's really me not\nlike I'm not allowing my mom to pull\nherself out of the hole unless I go down\nthere with her but that's really the\nopposite of empowering it's like I need\nto I need to let go but letting go so\nscary because if I feel like she's\ndrowning or if I feel like my brother's\ndrowning or my sister or whoever I love\nis drowning and I'm watching them drown\nhow am I supposed to not go in and save\nthem but the reality is sometimes\nthey're just flapping their arms and\ntheir feet are on the ground and it just\nlooked like they were drowning you know\nbut dude that is a great answer was it\nthat is a great concept no because you\njust there was another definition as as\nwhen you asked me that question that\ncame to my mind it's\nand whatever anyone's belief in God is\nwhen I say the word God is like God\nUniverse whatever you personally choose\nbut like the ego is when you choose to\nplay God instead of wow Play Your Part\nfor god wow right okay so that was a\ngood answer and that's why it's a great\nanswer yeah yeah because that is exactly\nwhat's happening it's like you're you're\nsaying it's all on me right are you\ntrying to be the United me the almighty\nomnipotent you use the word at the\nbeginning like that's a god-like word\nright like where you're like everything\nrests and depends on me right which\nmeans if I do it I'm Gonna Save it and\nif I'm not there it's gonna fall apart\nright and that's ego because like you\njust rightly said like not only you can\nlove someone and let them still grow by\nthemselves and still be there for them\nbut you can't grow for them right but\nwhen you want to grow for someone\ninstead of grow with them or help them\ngrow yeah and I think that that level of\nlike\nomnipotent and that level of control\nalso\ninfluences like lack of confidence\nbecause\nby me being like let me handle it really\nsays oh so you think that if I handle it\nyou know maybe my mom like oh you think\nif I handle it don't let you help me\nRuss that like I can't do it you know\nand I'm just like yeah kind of\nyou know but I need to it's just really\nit's coming back to that place of my\nrole and my identity I always played the\nrole of helping and being responsible\nemotionally for people and and saving\nthem and fixing things and so it's just\nsecond nature I get very hyper Vigilant\nwhen I when someone around me is upset\nbecause if you're upset it's my fault is\nwhat is what it gets like coded as and\nI'm trying to unlearn that but that's\ntough because like I said I feel\num or when I was a kid the stakes seemed\nso high it felt like it was life or\ndeath if I don't help what if someone\nself-harms Etc\nbut now\nwhen someone's upset I still can't let\ngo\nand and still be there for them but not\nfeel like I have to go down into the\nhole with them\nbecause I'm still operating from that\nchildlike role you know and and I'm just\nworking on understanding that like\nthey're okay they're gonna be okay like\nyou know no one's saying like cut them\noff and don't talk to him yeah you don't\nneed to go down into the hole with them\nyeah that's beautiful Amanda the album\nSantiago is inspired by Paulo aqualo's\nAlchemist yes which is a legendary if\nyou haven't heard of I mean you have to\nhave heard of this book everyone's\nlistening if you haven't it's a\nlegendary book by a legendary author\nwhen did you first come across the book\nand and why did you feel like you wanted\nto bring music into the book\num so Boogie is my best friend put that\nbook in my hand when I was probably 17\n18. I met him last time did you yeah bro\nI'm with you yeah he's such a great dude\nit is incredible so he put like that\nbook in my hand pretty sure yeah\nNapoleon Hill in my head you know and\ncrazy books to read at that age\num and I was instantly like it became\nlike a Bible for me you know and there's\nthere was just so many parallels that I\nfound and I just I've like opened it\nback up a you know a few times over the\nyears but for whatever reason two years\nago summer of 2021 I decided to reread\nit and you know how you can like read a\nbook that you've already read but you\nread it at a different time in your life\nand all of a sudden different things\nstick out and it resonates deeper and so\nI it just felt it just spoke to me so\ndeeply than even before and I was like\nman I want to make a whole album it's\nbeautiful that gives like\nthat parallels the book with my story\nbut what ended up happening was\nit was hard for me to just tell my story\nand not make an album about The\nAlchemist and so that's why I ended up\nsaying it was Loosely inspired by The\nAlchemist because at the Inception it\nwas truly like it felt like I couldn't\nwrite about my life I had to write about\nSantiago's but then Palo cuello says\nsomething in and I think the forward\nwhere he says Santiago is my journey but\nit's your journey because one man's\njourney is everyone's journey and that\nwas the unlock for me and the permission\nfor me to like tell my story\nand there is like parallels within the\nAlchemist and my natural story but it's\nnot\na complete side-by-side thing it's just\nit was a lighthouse for me you know the\nwind and Oasis it was things that I\nrelated to but I still had my own input\non but yeah complete framework in\nLighthouse and he's a genius yeah it's a\nbeautiful album and what did he say yeah\nhe likes it so it's like that to me was\nlike this is insane that's beautiful\nyeah what a beautiful homage to like you\nknow yeah one of the great rights I was\nnervous because I'm like it was so so\ninsane I started making this album\nsummer 2021 he doesn't follow me on\nTwitter randomly like right when I start\nto make it he follows me on Twitter you\nknow he follows like 160 people and I\nwas like what are the odds that like\nwhile I'm making this but you know if\nyou read The Alchemist the signs and all\nthese things I'm like all right clearly\nI'm supposed to be reading this or\nunless he's got the room bugged like I\ndon't know what's going on\num but I so I told right when he\nfollowed me I told him I was like yo I'm\nactually making an album about like\nLoosely inspired by The Alchemist and he\nwas like that's so great keep me posted\nand he would like check in periodically\nlike yo how's it coming and I was like\nhe doesn't follow me anymore I don't\nthink it's personal but\nI love it I love it you just you took\nSantiago down a different path yeah yeah\nyeah no that's beautiful man I love that\nI love that if there's one song Russ\nyou've been amazing this has been such a\nit's always great having you here I've\ngot two questions for you one is is\nthere anything I haven't asked you that\nyou want to talk about because you're a\nfriend and I I have to honor you with\nthat question is there anything we\nhaven't dove into that you're like yeah\nI want to talk about this or even if\nit's quieter and you're like it's on my\nheart right now I need to say it the\nfloor is yours no I think honestly I\nthink we touched on everything yeah and\nI'm really really happy with how this\nwent I appreciate you having me for real\nof course man I appreciate you I was\nlooking you can come back on whenever\nyou want like this is like it's it's I\nlove conversations where they really are\njust like a back and forth like that's\nhow I feel with you I'm just like we can\njust talk about stuff and figure stuff\nout and not know the answer and yeah you\nknow but if there's one I'm gonna say my\none you can say it was what is the one\ntrack you want everyone to go stream\nafter listening to this episode which\none would you recommend I love you boy I\nwas gonna say the same one yeah I think\nit's so aligned with today's\nconversation but the other ones that I\nrecommend too that we discussed today\nfraud really powerful Oasis highly\nrecommend to as well and then of course\ngo listen to the whole album Russ you've\nbeen amazing to have backpack thank you\nI appreciate you so much as a as a human\nas a artist I I don't know anyone who's\nmade mental health and music seem that\ncool as you have
