    "transcript": "when you're on the field kill the other\ndude when you're not on the field you\ndon't have to kill the other dude but\nwhen you're on the field you want to win\nyou just have to realize when you're not\non the field the problem is I think\npeople don't realize when they're not on\nthe field the best-selling author and\nhost the number one Health and Wellness\npodcast on purpose with Jay Shetty\nif you could say that these are the\ncouple of the biggest changes you've\nseen in the last three decades uh in\nthis industry in the world that you're\nmost astounded by because I think we're\ngetting used to change I think for I\ndidn't grow up with a phone like I got\nmy first phone when I was 13 or 14 and\nit was a Sony Ericsson like brick with a\nlittle antenna yeah\nit was one of those yeah one of those\nold flip phones Sony Erickson had a\nlittle you know antenna on top of it my\nmom had one of the big like chunky brick\nstyle phones but I feel like we're\ngetting so used to change being so rapid\nthat we actually don't spot patterns if\nyou've spotted any patterns over the\nlast three decades what would you say\nthey are I don't know if there's\npatterns you know but I think you have\nto look at them in different sectors\nwhether it be Tech whether it be the\nentertainment business the one pattern I\ndo see\nchange is happening a lot faster so\nto pick up the phone probably took seven\nyears the speed of adoption the one big\nchange it's just now happening very\nquickly and that just lets people you\nyou better be really comfortable in the\nuncomfortable and change and that's a\nmindset that's a process to get to\nthat's what you have to realize attack\nand all this is going to happen a lot\nquicker now which is I don't think it's\ngood or bad it just is what it is yeah I\nlove what you just said there so my\nentire show I just went on a world tour\nand the entire show was based on the\npremise of getting the audience to sit\nin discomfort so I would literally bring\nup random audience members and one of\nthem was locked in a box on stage for 15\nminutes alone without any sound we had\nother audience members come up and have\nto toss that were uncomfortable I love\nthe idea of getting comfortable you\nbetter breathe through it you better\nbreathe through it that's the only way\nto do it I was going to ask you like how\nhave you trained your mind to be\ncomfortable with discomfort I'm not sure\nany of us are really comfortable with\nourselves as we mature and kind of get\ninto I said this to a client today I\nsaid there was a period of time I just\ndidn't want anybody to find out that I\nreally wasn't that bright and it was you\nknow I was scared right and that I think\ngoes back to my childhood and being\ndyslexic and\nnot believing that you know I'm okay I'm\nnot stupid right in my family if stupid\nwas it the definition and smart with the\nbut I started fasting and once you start\ndoing it\nit's not comfortable\nand I just\nstarted telling you know start that\nlittle voice\nno I'm not giving hand to that little\nvoice no I'm getting up even though I\ndon't want to get him and then it's that\nconversation you're constantly is that\nsomebody said my constant negotiation\nwith myself\nand now it's\nif I'm you know I meditate for 20\nminutes every day it's not easy sitting\nthere for 20 minutes you your toe\nwitches something and you got to get\nthrough it\nand it's just oh I'm gonna do a cold\nbath for five minutes every day that's\nnot fun and it's just teaching your body\nno you can get through this I'm not\nlistening to that voice I'm just\nbreathing through it I'm just getting\nthrough it and it's been\nprobably 15 years\nof uh\nof that and it translates into business\nbecause then\nokay we're taking over IMG I'm gonna\nmove to London for four months kids in\nthe family is going to be on the East\nCoast for the summer\nand it's going to be brutal and yeah you\ncan do that and or you'll see any of\nthese new tasks that you take on because\nyou're telling yourself a story that\nwhether it's going to be good or bad\nthat's not the truth you have to just\nrealize that thing's not the truth and\nyou just have to go through it yeah it's\nnot going to be easy so what who cares\nlike yes that's part of the process\nthat's actually part of the interesting\nthing that we're all doing so yeah no I\nlove that because it did start though\nwith not eating yeah interesting you\nknow the when I started learning about\nwhat fasting does or eating Windows do\nto your body and autophagy and etc etc\nthat then got your mind okay I can do\nthis and then you just start building on\nthat\nI probably even past the point of Health\nemotionally healthy but yes I'm way past\nit but uh yeah no but I love that\nbecause that's super practical right\nlike that's not an ethereal concept the\nidea is you are able to put yourself\nthrough things that you didn't want to\ndo no but that were actually good for\nyou and I find that that's why I hope\nyeah\nbut the idea that most of what we don't\nwant to do that we choose to do is\nactually what helps us get ahead in life\nI say said this to my kids\nyou know success is a lot of things\nwe're talking about one of it is and\nthat goes to kind of putting yourself is\nshowing up like there's a voice saying\nyou mean I gotta get on that plane for\n16 hours I gotta just go have a lunch\nand I gotta fly back from China\nI don't want to do that okay it said I\ndon't want to do it that little voice\nI'm doing it yeah and and learning to\nsay oh that's the voice no I'm getting\non the plane and showing up\nkind of going through it yeah that's\nthat's part of growing up and being\nsuccessful a lot of people are too lazy\nto fight that voice and over time when\nyou get older\nand I'm a lot older than you you don't\nwant to fight the voice and all the\nthings I do now is I think because as\nyou get older that voice takes over more\nand more it's easy you know don't get up\nat five o'clock and work out no don't do\nthis no I do it I don't care I suppose\nas soon as that voice turns on I say I'm\nI'm doing this yeah it's really\ninteresting you say that because I feel\nlike a lot of people say they can't hear\nthey're in a voice and it's because that\ninner voice they're just not listening\nit was so loud when we were younger yes\nbut it gets quieter and quieter and\nquieter because the other voice we kept\nlistening to it and it got louder and\nlouder and louder and so now we're\nhaving to unlearn that loud voice and\nand for me it was for me it started with\num fasting periods you know I do the 24\nand I do 16 and sometimes a 48 or 60.\nand and it's then kind of evolved into\nmultiple things to keep it exercised\nthat I cannot listen to The Voice yeah\nyeah absolutely and you need friends who\npush you to I remember a few years ago\nyou know whether it was skydiving or\nwhether it was cold plunges as you\nmentioned there it's like you need to be\nsurrounded by a community I just\nliterally I've got some friends from\nLondon staying with me right now this\nweek and I took them to do a cold lunch\nwith me you know every day we'd be doing\na hike every morning we've been doing\ninfrared sauna and they don't do that\nthey don't do that they've never done it\nbefore and it was just interesting how\ndid they do on their cold plunge they\ndid really well and they were saying\nthat because we were I was like trying\nto coach them through it and helping\nthem breathe so on their first time they\ndid the first one one of them did four\nminutes three on their first time that's\nincredible and it was yeah amazing after\nthey get past the first minute exactly\nexactly so it was a brilliant result but\nit was that idea of your community of\npeople around you yeah when you were I\nlove what you just said there that you\nwere scared at one point in your life\nof being figured out yeah as not being\nso smart and you said that came from\nyour childhood and yeah you had ADHD\ndyslexia from from what I've researched\nwalk me through how that idea stays even\nafter you're starting to see success\nbecause I think people believe that when\nyou become successful when you close\nyour big deal when you build a company\nthat some of that goes away you know\nArnold Schwarzenegger did you see that\ndocumentary ah which one the game\nchanger the most recent one that he did\nit's just about him kind of growing up\nand bodybuilding I don't think so I\ndon't think so he talks about you know\nhe won Mr Olympia and everybody was\ntelling him how great his body was\nright and they're all looking like oh my\nGod\nin his head he was saying\nthis is wrong that's wrong this is wrong\nand you're like nobody would have said\nthat yeah you know some people say it's\nyour inner voice your Shadow my my\nshrink used to tell me it's your Shadow\nmaybe people were thinking I was\nsuccessful I was thinking about that kid\nthat couldn't read and that during\nPassover didn't want to read the\nquestions because I because I was the\nyoungest and going into sewing that's\nwhy I hate Passover now the anxiety I\nhad when I was a kid and so it's just\nkind of upbringing yeah um I'm no longer\ndealing with those issues it's not like\nI'm beating my chest so I'm successful\nbut I'm comfortable\nand it's that in a good way drove me\nlike I'm gonna prove everybody wrong and\nyou know any bully comes out to me yep\nwe're gonna get in a fight anybody calls\nme stupid yep we're gonna get a flight\nFizz you know that's when I was young\nand it's just held over and then there's\nthe point in time where you say okay I'm\nnot doing this anymore I'm I'm I I have\nto deal with these crazy stupid phone\nyes you're successful\nyes it's okay\nnothing's being taken away from you and\nso\nthat just came with age a lot of shrinks\nand uh\nuh a lot of other therapies that yeah\nwe'll get into later yeah yeah no no but\nI think it's really important because I\nthink there's two things there one is\nthat it doesn't go away on its own no\nrevenge is not the solution or proving\nsomeone kind of um it's a good way to\nstart revenge and um I would say anger\nHmm got you to a certain point yeah you\nafter you get to a certain point if you\nstay with anger and and resentment and\nand fear\nyou only can get to a certain point in\nyour life and once you make the\ntransition that you know something\nthat's never going to get me over the\nhump and you have to get go a little\ndeeper and that's scary\num and takes work when you know when you\nsit in yoga I don't know what it is it\njust opens up things to come to you and\nthe process to come to you and that's\nwhat happened at you know\num I don't know when it when it really\nhappened\nuh probably 12 15 years ago that I was\non this journey to kind of find out\nI don't want to be that guy that's\nsomebody says something I go to code red\nnine\nThat's not healthy that that's way too\nmuch energy yeah\nit's emotional energy that you know is\nexhausting absolutely and that's what it\nis it's exhausting it's draining and it\ntakes away from that Creative Energy the\nspark that's to let things in that\nactually need to come in that then you\ncan see the world differently and like\nwait a second like you're not seeing it\nthrough those eyes you're seeing it\nthrough a different like way to say what\nabout this what about that you you can\nbe creative that's a better place to be\nyeah yeah absolutely I wanted to ask you\nas well I mean you probably asked this\nall the time but I think it's important\ncontext setting for everyone who's\nlistening the idea of like sitting in\nthe discomfort as you were talking about\nit\nmy wife and I use Entourage fans and I\ncan imagine that it's cool but\nuncomfortable to have\nyour image displayed in a certain way\nthat has pros and cons and there was and\nthose aspects to that character\n100 True which months yeah you know I\nwas very aggressive\nand you know when we started the\nbusiness we couldn't compete on price\nbecause commissions were commissions\nthere was five other big players and and\nwe just had a\none be more creative two more aggressive\num and uh and fight so yeah that was\ntrue to form I mean not all of it but in\nthe surrounding yes\num I don't know what Entourage would be\nnow that character right\nso um yeah yeah and what what was stuff\nfor you like that's definitely not me\nlike were there anything well I don't\nknow I yeah to be candid that show gave\nme anxiety yeah I can imagine that's\nwhat I'm saying yeah it gave me a lot of\nanxiety so I didn't watch a lot right\nand uh people now watch it I mean during\nwe watched the pandemic I got a lot of\ncalls from guys I know that had kids and\nthe kids started watching kids in\ncollege started watching and I was like\nyeah yeah I didn't see that episode you\nknow I did watch the episode which I\nnever did\nI think he started to use a squirt gun\non people I didn't see that I mean I did\nsee that but I didn't do that\num it's good to know you didn't use it\nyeah that's important how have you\nharnessed or how has your aggression\nmatured in business because\nthe reason why I raised that is because\nI think\nyou know we we kind of swing in\npendulums in the world so if you think\nabout business back then and how we\nviewed Wall Street and even when I was\ngrowing up like the dream was to be an\ninvestment banker that's what everyone\nwas becoming in London and that was the\nBig Goal when I was a kid and did you\nwant to become one I wanted to become\none without knowing what it was right\nyeah right like you know that's what\nhappens and I went to Cass business\nschool and did management science and I\nwas training to go off into the\ncorporate world because that's what I\nthought you had don't you remember when\nyou were growing up the objective was\nhow big the stack was yes I never had\nthat objective no same for whatever\nreason my parents didn't that was not\nthe objective was to do well in the\nworld and make the world a better place\nabsolutely and I think a lot of my\nfriends\nthat was how big is the stack totally\nsame same for me it was I I didn't grow\nup with a lot my parents didn't have a\nlot but they always gave in charity they\nhelped the community my mom did a ton of\ncommunity work and then I obviously met\nmonks when I was 18 years old so like\nthat became my Paradigm shifted\nmassively and I was always far more\ncreative than anything else and that's\nwhat I enjoyed but I guess the question\nI'm asking is I think we've gone from\nthat very aggressive very competitive\nBrash harsh energy and then we swing to\nthis pendulum where everyone's like well\nno you just got to be fully like\nempathetic and vulnerable compassionate\nI'm like so how do you yeah so here's\nwhat it is what is the middle ground\nbalance because the answer is Always\nSomewhere here's here's uh somebody a\nreally smart person I won't say who told\nme\nyou have to know and this only comes\nwith time immaturity when you're on the\nfield when you're on the field let's\nkill the other dude\nwhen you're not on the field you don't\nhave to kill the other dude for you it's\ngot to be a good deal for me it's got to\nbe a good deal etc but when you're on\nthe field you want to win\nyou just have to realize when you're not\non the field the problem is I think\npeople don't realize when they're not on\nthe field\nand that has come over time like\nwhen am I on the field okay when I'm on\nthe field I'm playing to win\nwhen I'm not on the field I can be in a\ndifferent mindset\nthat shift for me going to fear anger I\nalways thought I was on the field\nand for a long time yeah to get the\ncompany where I wanted I was always on\nthe field now I don't have to be on the\nfield all the time and that not being on\nthe field\nenables you to think properly and and\njust let things in and and grow that\ngets you to other things that all sudden\naffect the field in a different way you\nhave different moves it's it's probably\nhow great players as they get older\nLeBron James Michael Jordan\nthey their bodies are not the same but\nthey're better players because they just\nknow how to do it differently so when\nI'm not on the field I'm not on the\nfield when I'm on the field\nI'm playing pretty hard yeah that's\nthat's a really unique Insight I like\nthat because I feel like that's also\nwhat challenges people in their personal\nrelationships because not only are\npeople not on and off the field in\nbusiness they don't know how to switch\nit off when they go home yeah and so\nyour wife and your kids or your husband\nor your partner or whoever it may be\nends up getting that same treatment as\nyou do at work because you haven't\nreached that maturity level of knowing\nhow to and it's not as easy as a light\nswitch oh no like it's not just oh I'm\nwork hat off workout on it doesn't work\nlike that and your partner depending on\nwhat they do you might be off the field\nthey might be honest they want to be on\nthe food right because they're going\nthrough their things it's just like\nthat's what it is yeah yeah so yeah we\njust I just got back from tour and we\nwent to Bali for a couple of weeks just\nto relax with me and my wife and it's so\nfunny because she's she's a vegan chef\nand recipe developer and uh incredible\nwith knows everything about ayurveda and\nherbs and nutrition and she's made me\nvery healthy compared to what I used to\nbe but but she's on the field right now\nbecause her career is booming she's\ndoing incredibly well well and it's so\nfun to watch and it's so funny because I\nwas like yeah we're going to balance she\nwas like you know what I think we're\ngoing there for a bit long and I was\nlike that was me like I used to say that\nlike five years ago and so it's just\nlike okay it's not only your life yeah\nyou have two people and you just have to\nnavigate oh I'm not gonna feel okay\nI gotta think about this maybe even\nthough I want to be there three weeks\nmaybe it's only a week and a half yeah\nyeah and I'll just be off the field here\nI'll figure out what to do yeah yeah and\nand I think it's hard because I think\nyeah we struggle when you've done for\nother people too when you've said things\nwhen you're on the field\nit's hard for the person especially in\nbusiness for now to view you differently\nwhen you're off the field it's every\nmarriage every relationship every\npersonal situation changes after 10\nyears I was I'm not the same person I\nwas from 95 to 2005. I'm not the same\nperson from 2005 to 2015. I'm definitely\nnot the same person from 15 now and yeah\npeople's viewpoints of me is probably\nwhat it was in 97 98 night and let me\njust say something that guy was not I\nmean he was a good guy but\nhe was always on the field and he was\nashamed nervous angry fighter\nnot that I'm not aspects of those things\nworking on them but yeah yeah that\nchanges and when they come into your\nrelationship they have all this now they\ncan read everything see everything and\nlike oh that's the guy yeah or not\nthat's why I'm doing this dude\nI'm such a gentle nice hugging well no I\nI the reason why I also enjoyed these\nconversations is because I think I\nstruggle with that in perception too\nwhere I feel people believe that someone\nwho is mindful or meditative has to be a\ncertain way at all times do you know\nwhen you're on the field yeah absolutely\nyeah and that's why I love that piece of\nadvice is that you you said it in a way\nthat I think makes it so easy to think\nabout and that's why I really appreciate\nit and that's exactly what it is for me\nlike my team knows that they they can\nsee that when I'm in the zone and I'm\nnot where I'm winning my home kit or\naway kit like however you put it like\nyes I I totally like that home kid yeah\nhome Jersey away Jazzy right like and I\ncan feel that and I think that you have\nto know that but I think the idea is\nthat we like to simplify people because\nit makes it easier for us if you're\ngoing after the stack and that's the\ngoal yeah right which is like crazy like\nagree it's so arbitrary this stack\nyou're always on the field yeah\nwhat you don't realize is you can be\nhappy\nat whatever the level the stack is yeah\nthere's just a different way to think\nabout it and you will get to a very big\nstack by figuring out this first if when\nyou're on the field when you're off the\nfield absolutely and and I think that's\nthe difference I wanted to ask you the\ndifference in success and happiness or\nsuccess and contentment\nbecause\nyou've it sounds like you've worked on\nboth and tried to be conscious of both\nhow have you seen the difference and and\nhow do you work on that I was never\ncontent before probably the first 20\nyears of business I mean I was just\nI was gonna prove everybody wrong I was\ngoing to prove to myself I wasn't stupid\nI was uh and I was just running hard\nwhen I say this word that doesn't mean\nthat I'm not in business I'm content and\nuh all the things I thought about that I\nwant to accomplish and how I saw the\nworld kind of played out I'm a really\nlucky guy\nI'm comfortable that I'm not stupid\nand\nI got a lot more I want to accomplish\nbecause I want to accomplish it not to\nget the stack any bigger and I'm happy\ndoing that\nthat's a completely different place from\nthe first 20 years where I had no idea I\njust\nI thought about the stack and what\nsuccess was in such a\ndifferent way than I think about it now\nand do you think everyone there's that\nbrilliant quote from Jim Carrey where he\nsaid that everyone should become rich\nand famous and achieve everything they\never wanted just to realize that it's\nnot the point do you think that there is\nsomething he said that yeah yeah that's\ngenius yeah yeah yeah and it's uh I love\nthat statement because I feel like this\nI love that story there's something\nabout pursuing success as you see it\nwhich may not be a perfect definition\nright experiencing some success and\ngoing well wait a minute this wasn't it\nand I feel like because you always hear\nsuccessful people say oh it isn't it but\nit's almost like I think oh I'm happy\nwhere I am yeah I'm really I'm no no I'm\nso glad that it played out those\nstatements are actually accurate you\nknow like it's enabled me now to kind of\nwhen I started this 12 years or whatever\nyeah to get to this place I'm not sure I\nwould have ever gotten to it yeah with a\ndifferent mindset yeah yeah and in 95\nyou had a big accident right like there\nwas something that it was 90 it was 93\n93. I was working at ICM there was a\nbreakfast place Kate manolini's I was\nwalking down Wilshire was about three\nblocks away coming back and I and just\nsitting on the curb I said to myself I\nwas going to the breakfast like wow you\nknow I gotta move back from this curve\nthese cars could hit you and I was not\nin the street cut to I'm walking back\nfrom breakfast\nin the crosswalk right outside of where\nthe ICM building was\nin a flatbed truck didn't see me took a\nleft onto Wilshire hit my left side nine\no'clock in the morning\nFriday\nguess what happens your life changes he\nlike life's not a dress rehearsal was\nlaying in there I just wiggled my\nfingers and toes I said okay I'm not\ncrippled\nkind of my I was outside my body\nscreaming I was laying there watching\nmyself scream\nand then I just sent myself life's not a\ndress rehearsal I did a rehab because I\ncouldn't bend my leg and then I had a\nsurgery on my leg and then I did another\nrehab so that was 18 months of hell\nand then I said what do you want to do\nand I definitely didn't want to be at\nICM\nyeah what was it what was the phrase I\nused to hear when I was at ICM back in\nanything I cover myself that's what it\nstood for so there was no\ncamaraderie culture or anything and so\nme and three other guys decided to start\nwhen I could be healthy and we kind of\nget it in 95 on my birthday March 29th\nwe\nlet loose so and that that was the\nCatalyst to say why is not a dress\nrehearsal you better get to what you\nwant to get to and that kind of thesis\nis\nthe at the 20-year Mark change in how I\nlook at life and I'm like still going to\nbe that angry guy and you know\nall the different routes we all take in\nour lives to get to where the end is so\nyeah did you try and change\ncertain aspects of the culture\nbased on that statement that you built\nor did you find that I just wanted to\ntreat people well\nyou know inside and share clients and\ncommunicate better and there was a guy\nby the name of Phil Raskin the first\nemployee\nand they fired him in the Israeli Army\nyou don't let anybody stay you know you\nknow you take you you go get the bodies\nso I said you're hired now we had no\nmoney we're not making any money and I\nsaid we're hiring you if they're firing\nyou\nand how we treat people was kind of the\ncrucial thing different about\nhow we did things\num I think one of them and uh I think\nit's\nprogressed I don't know if it's perfect\nnow\nyou'll have to ask the guys running the\nagency right now but I think overall I\nhope people feel that way what was it\nlike building something from scratch\nwhen there wasn't any money because I\nfeel like it's easy to look at you now\nand ever you know it's well it was two\nyears yeah and no salary because you're\nout on your own there's what we were\nbeing we were we were in a tussle with\nICM over commissions and uh because we\ncouldn't take the commissions because\nthey said they deserved it because we're\ngoing to contact this whole like and\nthey were going to sue us for certain\nthings and um and so we had no money I\nmean we knew things we had money but a\nlot of stuff was old stuff\nabout a year and a half two years in we\nsettled I might be getting dates wrong\nbut right around then and then we had\nmoney and and in that period of time the\nworld changed mike always left the\nbusiness who was the god and Ron Meyer\num Bill Haber and then uh Gavin pallone\nleft this company UTA\num and a lot of Shifting happened and we\nhad put on we had taken a couple people\nfrom um CA uh martial and\nand we put on a bunch of TV shows that\nwere successful and we had money because\nof those because they were going into\nsyndication and packages and so it was\nlike free agency and baseball we have\nmoney and people are like shifting what\nare they doing and\nwe were home we got you know we're just\ntiming and we were in the right place at\nthe right time what was the hottest\nthing you had to do in those two years\nyou just had to work you know with\nnobody putting the time just putting the\ntime and you were doing 17 hour 18 hour\ndays\nwife was pregnant at the time my ex-wife\nwith our eldest\num and uh keep on building and how are\nwe going to do it and\nyou know the five of us I think Marty\nwould have joined and then two and a\nhalf years in Patrick Weitzel had joined\nand just kind of how we keep on\nprogressing and and doing it like with\nno none of us had ever done it before we\nwere all as my father was saying in\nYiddish we were all pitchers you know\nthe small nothings and so we just\nfigured it out but but you know it\nwasn't like oh we went from no money to\nuh yeah it was nothing yeah\nand it was we were happy yeah we were\nreally happy because we were in our own\nheads it was it was successful and it\nwas hard but we had fun yeah absolutely\nabsolutely yeah while I was a student\nand\nbefore I ever started doing things\nonline I I used to do events in my local\narea in London and like 10 people would\nshow up every week to hear me speak\nabout spirituality psychology human\nbehavior and I loved it I did it for 10\nyears before so are you saying you you\nwent to school to possibly be a banker\nyeah and then what what not that this\nwe're going to reverse the interview now\nwhat was the transition to like oh I\ndon't want to do this what happened in\nyour mind or or life event so I think\nlife event that I met a monk and I'd\nnever met aware before at school so they\nthey would come and we'd have speakers\ncoming whether it be CEOs or right\nathletes or celebrities or former alumni\nor whatever it may be and one day a monk\nwas invited to speak at a small College\nsession and some of my friends would get\na business session no no\nyeah and I was invited to go because\nsome of my friends were getting into\nmeditation at the time this is early\nlike we're talking about like 2006 2007.\nso we were doing that and it was and and\nmy friends were were kind of getting\ninto that space so they were telling me\nto come along and I was like yeah I'll\ngo if we go to a bar afterwards like\nthat's the kind of guy I was growing up\nand so I went along and you weren't\nmarried at design oh no I'm 18 years old\nokay I'm 18 years old I'm you know about\nto start college around that time and so\nI go to this event and I hear this monk\nspeak and I'm kind of there going okay\nwhen are we going to leave like who\ncares about this stuff what how does\nthis benefit my life and I actually\nwalked away feeling completely just\nreflective because this monk was saying\nthat the greatest gift was to use your\nskills in the service of others like you\nwere saying that whatever you've been\ngiven that was his main thing that was\nhis main theme to improve other people's\nlives and it was like I'd never heard\nthat from anyone before 18 and I\nrealized that when I was 18 I'd met\npeople who were rich and famous and\nbeautiful and you thought that was that\nthat was a stack yeah but I was like\nthis is this guy seems happy he seems\ncontent he has something that at what\npoint in the lecture did that like hit\nyou because at one point you're saying\nlet's go get some beers yeah at the\nbeginning I was kind of like okay what\nhe's gonna say when he came out and you\nknow he's dressed in robes and he he was\nfrom India and like you know I'm a kid\nin London like you know there's nothing\nexternally attractive about him and then\nas he spoke like as I actually listened\nto him I was just mesmerized and so I\nsaid to him I just want to follow you\naround so I ended up following him\naround for the rest of that week he was\ndoing events in London homes and\ndifferent things and then at temples and\nthen I started visiting him in my summer\nand Christmas vacations in India wow and\nthen when I graduated from college I\nwent and actually lived with him as a\nmonk for three years in India in the UK\nand what did your parents say they were\nlike completely like scared\nyeah and all of our friends and family\nhe's been brainwashed it was it was like\nit's really interesting because and I'll\ntalk to this about perception it's\nreally interesting because everyone now\nis kind of like oh Jay you just you know\nthis is a good story and I'm like dude\nwhen I chose to become a monk it was not\na good story people thought it was the\ndumbest idea of all time like it was\nlike career suicide it was poor kids\nwhat happened like what happened to this\nkid who got a first class honors degree\nat University Straight A's you know like\nwhat is going on here and all of a\nsudden I'm taking this part your parents\nmust have freaked out my parents freaked\nout and my extended family freaked out\neven more which made my parents freak\nout more they came from India correct\nyeah so that upbringing and that going\nback that way oh my God yeah exactly so\nand but I felt called I started\nlistening to my inner voice when I was\n14 years old and it's been so loud ever\nsince I don't know any other way to go\nand so for me it was so so loud and so\nthat was the shift in my trajectory\nwhere so you come out after three years\nwhat happened I hoped I'd do it forever\nuh and that I really thought I was going\nto do for the rest of my life it did not\nwork out and so what was why a couple of\nthings one thing was like it's super\ntough in your health to live communally\nlike when you're living potentially\nsometimes with 30 people in the room\nhundred people in a room people wake up\nat different times you're being woken up\nby everyone the common cold you're\nsharing buff showers like you know like\nthe space is life everything's communal\nin that space it's hard on my it was\nhard on my immune system to live in that\nway of course I'm a kid from London like\nI didn't grow up with lots of Comforts\nbut it was definitely more comfortable\nthan a monastery and then on top of all\nof that I just had this honest\ntransparency and that's what monk\nteachings are meant to do it's meant to\nmake you self-aware and my\nself-awareness was I'm quite independent\nI'm quite a rebel like I like doing\nthings my way and I think this is not\nthat this is not that I feel like I want\nto share what I've learned in this cool\naccessible relevant where the world is\nyeah where the world is which is the\nworld I come from and if I stay here\nthen I'm actually going to be pretending\nto be someone I'm not and so I'm gonna\ngo back and you know that's a big that's\na big thought it was it was and I had no\nidea what that meant then but I just\nknow that it was loud and that it was\nreal and that it had to happen it had to\nhappen it was you know I think it's it's\nfunny your brother said this about you\nhe said uh he said this in his in his\nbook Brothers manual the speed danger\nand risk that make other people nervous\nmake guys like Ari Serene and and it's\nand I want to dive into that with you\nbut for me that's what it was that you\ndidn't know where it was but you knew\nyou had to be on that road yes and and I\ndon't know how to stop myself I can't\npretend to myself is is where I've\nalways been like I have to be all of\nmyself and I'm and when decisions are\nagainst the grain and no one agrees\nchances I'm on the right path and so\neven when I came back then I had the\nopposite where everyone around me was\nlike you wasted three years look at\neveryone around you they've got jobs now\nwhat are they saying now yeah well I\nmean obviously it changes now but\nobviously it changes now but but isn't\nit I had this uh I sent this uh email\nout to the company you know most people\nthink success is this yeah\nthat's success yeah and that you just\nit's your journey yeah and it just you\ndon't know where it's still going but\nit's probably gonna go this way and then\nit's gonna go that you know yeah how\nhave you had the courage going back on\nthat same point how have you had the\ncourage to be open to speed danger and\nrisk when other people thought\nespecially what what I think we don't\nrecognize is as you become more\nsuccessful as you make bigger decisions\nit's not that just more doors open\nsometimes there's even more doubt\nbecause now people are like can he can\nhe get the next one right most people\ndon't want to risk it all correct once\nyou get to something like why would I\nrisk that correct like why do that\nyou're it's going to be on a perfect\nGlide path yeah so I've said this before\nin certain interviews I don't remember\nexactly which one when you're in a class\nand you're figuring out where to sit in\nthe class because you think you've\npsychologically figured out if I said\nhere the teacher won't call on you to\nread\nand you're so anxious and you're so\nnervous and you're so afraid it's not\nlike I don't get anxious about big deals\nI mean I got really sick doing the UFC\ndeal uh moving I am moving to London not\ngreat for four months when we took over\nright yeah so what uh you know I'm not\nnervous about those things\nI don't know why it's just my upbringing\nyou know things I went through that I\ncould get over so working hard\ndoing all the things showing up you know\ngetting on that plane for the lunch in\nChina and then flying back after the\nlunch\nthat's kind of\nhow I operate my life I don't know how\nwhat my mom\nfed me or did and my dad\nbut yeah I'm not I'm not worried about\nthe hard work and all of it takes hard\nwork as you know and I'm not trying to\nprove to anybody what I'm not letting\ntheir definition of success not success\nwhat I should do what I shouldn't do\ndictate\nwhat I want to do like you\nI got my own ideas about what I want to\ndo I just keep on following them\nhopefully I keep on getting in tune with\nmy voices definitely listening to people\nin my life that I trust but then you\nknow it's like okay it's time to bet\nlike we just did with WWE and doing\nsomething new and here's what we're\ngonna do yeah those are not easy\ndecisions and yeah it's really\ninteresting because even uh but I'm very\ncomfortable in the uncomfortable I'm\nreally comfortable in the uncomfortable\nI think when most people don't like\nuncomfortable conversations don't like\nto be uncomfortable in business don't\nlike that\nI do enjoy that a lot I like awkward I'm\ncomfortable and awkward I like\njust saying what it is I do not care\nyou can like me not like me I was never\none of the cool guys I'm good\nI I think it was so funny because Mike\nMilken was sitting in your seat\nyesterday just here and and it was\ninteresting because there's this shared\nexperience of there's a healed sense of\nself-worth but then there's this\nembracing our own insignificance like\nyou just said you're like we're I'm also\ninsignificant and it's really\ninteresting because everyone who's kind\nof has a settled mind I'm not sure\npeople\nget to the second one but no but we need\nto oh why do you think we don't get\nthere I've had this conversation with\nmany people this concept of legacy and\nonce you actually believe it not just\nsay it I mean legs I mean presidents\nhave legacies I guess\nsome entertainers have Legacy sports\nstars have Legacies\nbusiness people\nno guys no they don't have legacies and\nonce you get to that point and\ncomfortable in that point this whole\nconcept that what's my legacy which is a\njerk-off conversation you can move past\na lot of this stuff yeah you know we're\nsitting there what's my legacy yeah yeah\nit's a bad question it's a bad question\nlike that that's why you're doing it\nyeah I agree oh my God that's crazy yeah\nit's I you know what I think it comes\nfrom I think we never get to embrace our\nown insignificance because we're scared\nof where it leads to low self-esteem so\nthere's that angle but definitely I\ndon't have that yes\nangle which is what you're raising is\nthat I think as humans we're so addicted\nto immortality because at least from a\nspiritual point of view our\nConsciousness and energy is Immortal and\nthere's such a addiction to immortality\nand Longevity that we have that for us\nto live after we die we think so here's\nmy thoughts because people because I\nmean I am a crazy health nut yeah I mean\nI do some crazy stuff yeah and I'm into\nit too so I'm really really yes but for\nme\nit's not about living forever it's about\nbeing healthy while I live same I agree\nas long as I am because I see people\nthat are older yeah that are prisoners\nin their bodies as when they get to\ntheir 60s 70s 80s I'm not doing that the\nbest thing that could happen\nis\nit's over\nwould be incredible and you die in your\nsleep like it's over\nbut until that point in time I'm playing\ngolf I'm going on Hikes I'm surfing I'm\ndoing my thing this whole thing about\nthis whole world of\num and I hack yeah I hack myself to do\nthat but it's not to live to ever and so\nthat's the objective yes yeah no I get\nthat and I and I'm totally aligned with\nthat I feel the same way like I don't\nthink it's what's the craziest thing you\ndo for your health I mean I I've been\nrecent because I'm still young there's\ncertain things that people don't\nrecommend yet and so like I've been\ntalking to people about like stem cell\ntreatments and things like that I don't\nknow if you've done any stem cell\ntherapy or anything like that but okay\nso I haven't done any of it either but\neveryone's was like yeah you're too\nyoung to sell these kind of things right\nnow but I'd say the craziest thing I do\nright now is same as you like the\nfasting the cold plunging the infrared\nsaunas the the Deep resting sleep the\nmeditation has been a part of my life\nfor 17 years you got to push steal yeah\nyes yeah you got you got to do weights I\nhad to stop that last year for a I had I\nhad I had surgery so I had to stop but\nyes I usually do have to do that you\nhave to do stuff for your kind of CO2\nyour oxygen your ability how old do you\nknow 35 yeah so you're right at the\nright if you do now the time yeah you\ngotta reduce as much as you can your\ninflammation you gotta have gut health\nyes this exactly and then you have to\nfigure out how to balance your glucose\nif you can do those things yep you have\n35 chance of getting to the objective of\none night you just don't wake up yeah\nright are you plant-based as well or you\nyou try here's what it is because I'm\n62. yeah okay wow so I was electing free\nvegan\nfollowing Dr gundries Who got me when I\nhad my thyroid problem really healthy\nthe problem is now because I do push a\nlot of Steel I do do heavy cardio I do\ndo a lot of stuff I have to have some\nprotein in my diet so I have moved up to\nprobably very healthy you know grass-fed\ngrass finish no corn in it all the stuff\nthat causes inflammation I have moved up\ninto probably three or four days of of\nmeat and then the rest\nlectin free uh vegan yeah what's the\ncraziest therapy you've done you\nmentioned earlier there was some\ndifferent streets yeah I you know I take\nhelmets from Thailand and from the UK\nevery morning I do light therapy every\nmorning after the cold Plunge I mean if\nif I showed you the list now yeah you'd\nbe like or you've you've lost the plot\nare you no I love it that's why you look\nhere's what here's what happens though\nyeah as I go down all these paths I\nalways call my brother Zeke yep and I\nonly have the following question and\nthen he has to do the work and I do work\ntoo I said okay uh can it kill me can it\ninjure me or hurt me if the answer comes\nback no\nI do it so I started on their you know\nthey're live microbes they're microscopy\ncan't see them I drink them every\nmorning now I've gotten to a place where\nI I do that I worked with this guy\num uh from from duke as I read an\narticle about him and people are like\nwhat are you doing like and I say the\ngreat line to them and say watch their\nfacial expression I said well they don't\ncolonize in your system and you know\nbaby you can see them like\nand so this goes to like\nall right I'm not I'm just gonna try\nthese things as long as it can't hurt me\num the list is yeah vast yeah yeah it's\ngreat no it's great I think it's I mean\nthis is where this is where the world's\nheading and I think everyone's looking\nfor Solutions and looking for ways so I\nlove hearing about it from you and it's\nand it's great and it shows right I feel\nlike you you've seen really vibrant\nenergetic and and I think that's the key\nright it's Vitality I think well the\nback is not turned into a mouse that's\nhunched over yeah yeah yeah absolutely\nhave you ever seen those absolutely that\nthat that that scares me yeah yeah yeah\nyeah I will do anything math because\nthen it's not you're going to be a\nprisoner in your body yeah yeah that's\nthat's that's that's not that's not\nwhere you want to be in life yeah\ntalking about athletic bodies you you\ntalked about what you did with the WWE\nthere remember when you first got\ninvolved with the UFC yeah there was a\nlot of like doubt as to how big it could\nget I believe it was there was a bit of\nskepticism how do you how do you when\nyou're making a decision that's big\nmoney big risk and danger going back to\nthat point but then everyone else is\nlike oh it's a lot of risk this is like\ndon't know if it's gonna work out but\nthen you're like no I know where this is\ngonna go how do you how have you found\nthat the first thing that yes I mean the\nfirst thing that I do I mean I'm\nassuming you do it anybody successful do\nit I read a lot yeah and I I ask a lot\nof questions too once I read an article\nif I understand I don't understand it I\nwant I call the person or I call the\nperson in the article and that happened\nearly on how we started the firm like\nyou know we were in the representation\nbusiness and then I said\nwe have all this business I want to buy\nsomething that we own I thought Sports\nwas going someplace that with increased\ndistribution it was going to be more\nvaluable\nand so it was a like there's not many\nsports you can own I was already in\nbusiness with UFC we did all the work\nabout where we could take the economics\ninternationally sponsor you\nit was an easy bet and it worked out\nwell it's worked well the world changed\non me yeah at the time for the like Fox\nsold to Disney so those two buyers out\nDonald Trump wouldn't let\nATT buy Time Warner so those two buyers\nare out and the rest of it they didn't\nnobody else wanted it at the time\nbecause they had already had too much so\nit was nerve-wracking for a while\num but then the world changed yeah it's\nfascinating to me because I think that\neveryone in their micro universe or any\nuniverse is always having to make tough\ndecisions that a lot of people around\nthem don't understand whether someone\nlistening to this right now is trying to\nstart a new health regime whether\nsomeone's just not a pill yeah and\nanything we do as we now know\nthere's not like because I don't know\nabout you people coming so what's the\none thing one thing there is no one I I\ndo 17 things like and it's growing from\n10. yep there's nothing like being asked\nthe one thing it doesn't work yeah yeah\nabsolutely absolutely and that's why\nthat's why the questions I'm asking you\nI'm fascinated by the the thought\nprocess\nyou're just you're in our lives we're\njust gathering information gathering\nthought process Gathering Gathering\nperspectives yeah and then we go hunting\nfor things that we want to do\nand where we think the world's going and\nthen once you get to that point like\nokay you talk to a lot of people\nyou have to for me talk to investors Etc\nand\nthen you're then your launch and then\nthere's I think I might get this story\nwrong Disney when they bought cap cities\nwhich had ESPN they valued ESPN did zero\nat the time and at the when it came out\nit was the most valuable asset\nagain success right who knows yeah you\nknow you can do all the work you can do\nand then all of a sudden\nget into the pool the water's warm dude\nyou got to start swimming yeah yeah and\nthat and that's what I think I think\nthere is so much pressure around making\nthe right decision as opposed to making\nyour decision right\nright like as in you I think a lot of\npeople spend a lot of time going is this\nthe right decision is this the right\nthing to invest and I'm like well make\nthe decision and then make sure we\nstarted it how many people uh can handle\nchange and fear the I mean you just have\nto be comfortable in the uncomfortable\nand yeah yeah absolutely what have you\nseen you've worked with talent I know\nyou still do in in some intimate ways I\nwork with a lot okay\nmost of but you're working with the\nbusiness as well as much as yeah yeah so\nwhen you're working with Talent what\nhave you seen has been the\nbecause I think it was interesting I was\nsaying when I was young everyone wanted\nto be an investment bank and now we know\nin America most people want to be\ninfluencers creators some something to\nYouTube or what what have you seen have\nbeen the best choices that Talent have\nmade long term for their successful\ncareers or where are some of the\nmistakes I think most Talent now\nrealizes\nthey're the ass and it's kind of moving\ntowards them and and a lot of them are\nstarting to try and figure out like\nokay what does that mean can I own other\nbusinesses can I get Equity whether it\nbe Ryan Reynolds Dwayne Johnson Mark\nWahlberg these people right and I think\nthat's been at that level we're going to\ngo through a whole iteration right now\nwith AI\nthat is gonna I think\nI don't know what it's going to do but\nit's going to transfer one more time\num our business I think in a good way\nand that I think\npeople are gonna have more free time\nthan ever they're going to want movies\nthey're going to want to entertain\nthey're going to need more I think\nthey're we're going to go down to a\npermanent four-day Work Week governments\nare going to need it for Full Employment\nand that means\nthe weekend is starting on Thursday\nnight and that means that's three days\nwhere people need\npersonal interaction\nand so the value proposition especially\nas distribution changes you're going to\ngo to Six Wi-Fi\nyou're now seeing more distribution\nRumble picking up shows Rogue I mean\nit's just expanding and expanding\nour job is to create a place where our\ntalent can create really for the first\ntime even more exponentially become\ntheir own Brands and own businesses and\ndo things that they not just the movie\nnot just to tell other things and we'll\nbe successful for them and they'll be\nsuccessful as long as we can create this\nkind of perfect architecture and we're\nnot perfect at it yet but we're getting\nbetter at it and those are the clients\nthat we want to be in business and\nacross podcast all the different things\num and that's the hardest thing that\nwe're trying to build now in this\ntransition but that's where I think the\nworld is going interesting four day work\nweeks I think that's that I think I\nthink even if it's unofficial I I I I\ndon't know governments I think because\nof AIO and I'm saying probably in two\nthree four years for Full Employment and\nthey're gonna need it for social\nnon-unrest\nyou're going to have and you know you\nhave kova that's almost a four day work\nweek not because people don't go into\nthe office on Fridays\nthat means\nThursday night what are you doing yeah\nwell I'm in the entertainment that's the\nthat's the objective and so that's what\nwe've been building like events\nMadrid Open Barrett Jackson art show Etc\nand that's where I think the world's\nsporting events Etc so I think\nentertainment's can become more valuable\nthan it's ever become I don't think it's\nas will be as disrupted by AI\num there will be some disruption in it\nyeah it's it's incredible to think about\nthat because yeah I think people are\nonly looking for more Alternatives and\noptions especially for that human\nconnection Point yeah we're talking\nabout how have you found it as a leader\nto have that where you've gone from\neveryone being in an office in an agency\nto then people working from home like\nhow have you navigated that to continue\nthat like crazy listen we have you know\nwe've we had done this a long time ago\nwe just restarted we did a we did a a\nbook club not the way we used to do with\non with Rick Rubin on his new book we do\nwe've had a lecture on anti-Semitism\nwe're trying to get people in groups\ntalking about big issues to kind of keep\nthe company together from you know we're\nin I don't know 37 countries so that\npeople get to there's a communal and\nthey we're going to start a big Retreat\nagain which we hadn't done in a lot of\nyears because of covid so that's the way\nwe foresee doing that yeah yeah\nabsolutely yeah and I think that that's\nthat just keeps hopefully yeah and we\nhave to keep on working on how we keep\nthat connection\num ongoing in the company yeah you know\nbecause you do want if the architecture\nright you do want the licensing group\ntalking to the motion picture group\ntalking to the online on location group\nto create an experience and you want all\nthose pieces and and the outside world\nand the clients is asking for it too so\nthat's where we have to yeah I worked\nwith so many organizations before and\nduring mainly the pandemic and then even\nafter and\nthe transitions I've seen are incredible\nbecause whether a company was\ngrowing rapidly so I was working with\nzoom they were having the best success\nas a company financially but it was like\nthey had to scale like what was a small\norganization really quickly yeah and so\nlike the burnout that comes with that is\nreally really hard and then you had\nother organizations obviously like\ntravel entertainment live entertainment\ndown down struggling with that and\nhandling morale and so it's really\ninteresting to see how they both bounce\nback because it was hard either way and\nit's really you always think oh they're\nsuccessful they don't it's hot success I\npromise you it's hard for them though\nyeah of course it is of course it is\nit's it's so complicated and it's really\ncomplicated success is hard and failure\nis hard running a business\nI don't\nany one of them yeah yeah brutal yeah\nwhat have been some of you what would\nyou say in the last few years has been\none of like your biggest misses or your\nbiggest failures that uh you look back\nand go that taught me a lot well I'll\nsay the following because it was a\nsuccess\nand it was only success because I\nthought we had to like shut everything\ndown and Dana White at the OC said to me\nuh-uh we're not shutting down I got\nscared and he like slammed across the\nface so no we're going and then he said\ngive me an island and you know I was\nlike you know my brother's a doctor he's\ntelling me what the world's gone I'm\nlike\nand he was like um we're and he was just\ndriving that train and so we got him an\nisland and he did everything else and\nand um\nyou know kind of just remind me like\nyeah it's it's nerve-wracking but don't\nbe scared yeah and he was like amazing\nyeah and I was like on the other side of\nthat fence and I said you know and\nthat's why I have a great party he's an\nincredible partner yeah but I I for the\nfirst time got really scared and he just\nsaid no we just have to go and we're\ngoing to take all the heat for it and it\nwas a lot of Heat against him and but we\ndid it if we didn't have that the whole\ncompany would have been tanked because\nwe needed the ESPN deal to continue to\ngo we needed to put on fights\nand his his courage like dragging me\nalong was incredible the industry today\nI feel like cancel culture heat coat\nlike it's got It's got hotter basically\nbecause there's more people to cancel\nthere's more things that people are\nsensitive or care about or believe in\nand values like how do how do you as a\ntalent agent think about artists going\nthrough that because I'm sure you've\nseen over the years just so I coach a\nlot of people in the music business\nactors like sports people I coach so\nmany people in the industry don't jump\nin the water because most people want to\nrespond the news cycle so fast\nunless you've committed murder and\nsomething whatever\nLet It Go\nthe thought process is I gotta jump and\nrespond then it's just the story just\ncontinues the news cycle I used to say\nit's like one day it's less than a half\na day now and if you just get out of\nthis emotional mindset that you have to\nrespond and they have to know and really\nnobody's gonna like it's over\ndon't respond and that's kind of I think\nthe hardest thing for any artist yeah\nhow have you how have you worked with\nbecause I'm guessing you you almost by\njob have to become a coach sometimes to\nthe people this is my this is my this is\nmy line of like why are you responding\nyeah don't like they want you to respond\nbecause then they keep on getting the\nclick yeah I think I'm not on social\nmedia yeah I won't do it\nI won't I mean I get it you know yeah\nsometimes my kids send it to me yeah my\nwife sends it to me I don't look at it\nwhat's something that you're trying to\nimmerse into your children like I mean\nyou were just your son was just calling\nyou just talking you're like what's\nwhat's something that you feel you\nreally want them to know and learn at\nthe stages they are in their life I just\nhope I think they get it it was so funny\nmy my youngest son\nis now training he goes to Michigan that\nhe's working up at Apple right now at\nApple Maps and he's decided comes out of\nhis he's going into his Junior he's\ntraining for Triathlon a junior what I\nloved about him is he did the work and\nwhat I mean by did the work and it was\nlike shocking hearing I was just such a\nproud father he talked about how you run\nbetter and how the people in Kenya run\nbetter because they're on their toes and\nhe'd done it with all this research\nabout and he started doing the first\nthree weeks was brutal on his legs but\nhe's gotten faster\non the bike\nI I have to do it in a box dad

final\nfive these have to be answered in one\nword or one sentence maximum so it's\nsuper oh God it's the phosphere I better\nsit up for this yes all right these are\nyour final five the first question is\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nheard or received know when you're on\nthe field the second question is what is\nthe worst advice you've ever heard or\nreceived I don't know if it was advice\nbut why would you do that um interesting\nuh third question what's something that\nyou're trying to unlearn being angry\nthat sounds hard it's hard how hard is\nit let's let's talk about that for a\nsecond I'll tell you what it is it's you\nknow I know when it pops up like all\nsudden when somebody used to call me\nstupid in school it was game on and that\nthesis where somebody treats me as if\nI'm not smart or they trying to pull\nsomething on me\nI just I just go to a very dark\nsick place\nand I've worked very hard now\nnot\nto go there to handle it differently not\nthat I'm not going to be like what you\nthink I'm stupid like by doing that\nyou're you're acting as if I don't know\nwhat's going on here\nand so\num and they're pulling one over me and\nfor whatever reason the minute I feel\nlike somebody's trying to yeah take\nadvantage of you yeah I get that yeah\nand so that is a lot of work that is a\nconstant work and when I feel it coming\non okay\nthat's your Shadow whatever the phrase\nis that you're you know that's the work\nI have to do and I don't always do it\nespecially those childhood ones when\nsomebody in business does that to me\nrecently I kind of like I went to the\nbad place I couldn't control it and that\nthat\nI'm that that's what I'm trying to work\non yeah what's been helping you work on\nthat it's just kind of like recognizing\nit once I recognize it yeah I can\nbreathe through it and I can get to the\nother side of it but in the moment\nsometimes\nyeah thanks for sharing that I feel like\nI feel like uh uh for me as well I feel\nlike your partners and your family often\nsee the worst of you oh God I always\nlook at that almost like how what does\nmy wife see and promise you do things\nthat are so not smart yeah and it's you\nknow it's it's just not good yeah then\nyou regret it afterwards I'm not sure I\nregret it but it's just like really you\nhad to do that you're 62 you had to do\nthat yeah you had to say that you had to\nlike make calls and try and kill you no\nI'm not doing that yeah all right two\nmore questions the fourth question is uh\nwhat's something that you used to value\nthat you don't no longer value well I I\nI thought it was about the stack now\nmaybe somebody's gonna say he's got the\nstack now yeah but I never had I didn't\nhave the stack at the beginning and I\ndidn't I mean I don't I I that was never\nthe end game what is the end game now I\nam really happily married I love my kids\nthey're in great shape\num I'm comfortable in\nwho I am I'm I'm I'm happy that I have\nto constantly work at it now and I'm\nactually in a good place to work at I\nunderstand the work I have to do which\nmakes it even better all right Fifth and\nfinal question we asked this to every\nguest who's ever no these are longer\nthan one sentence I know because because\nyou keep giving good answers you keep\ngiving good answers I can't help it\nmy audience is gonna get mad at me okay\nthey're gonna be like Jay why didn't you\nyeah I listened to my my this is what\nthey're saying in the comments yeah\nthey're telling me they'll be like Jay\nhe just told you like something amazing\nuh Fifth and final question if you could\ncreate one law that everyone in the\nworld had to follow what would it be it\ncould be anything about any any type of\nlaw don't be hypocritical if your whole\nthing is stay out of my life okay stay\nout of my life on Guns stay out of my\nlife on covid just stay consistent and\nthat's the hardest thing because there's\nthe shade of gray right I just want\nconsistency without like the issue of\nmoney the affirmative action issue is\nyou know oh it's Sports and and Legacy\npeople or family you know kind of\nHeritage that got into the school well\nthat's about money like oh yeah the\nsports make the money and the the people\nthat went there and their kids that they\ngive a lot of money like okay we all get\nit like just stay consistent with when\nwe decide to pass a law like that it is\nthen across the board and the money\ndoesn't get into doing all those other\nthings that that's the thing I just know\nI just look at these things I'm like the\nhypocrisy of of and I'm I'm apocryphal\nall of us\napocryphal I understand it I wish that\nwe could figure out a law of that\nconsistency whatever we decide so that\nit's like okay if if really what you're\nsaying here and we take it out across\nall these other issues here's what it\nwould mean and so everybody gets I don't\nknow what that law would be no the\nessence of the answer is great I love\nthe idea of being consistent in removing\nhypocrisy and the challenges we and\nmoney yeah and we all have it like we\nall like we'll fight to death for this\nthing and then but actually you know\nplease don't say all
