about\npeople's stories of healing of grief of\nloss of growth is a powerful way to do\nthat and today I've been graciously\ninvited to the White House and I'm\nsitting with Mr President and I'm so\ngrateful and honored to be here and to\nhave you on our platform and for you to\nchoose our platform to have this\nconversation I couldn't be more honored\nthank you so much\nabsolutely well let's dive straight in\nthe first question I'd like to ask you\nis\nwhat is your earliest childhood memory\nthat you believe defines who you are\ntoday and the person you've become\nthe earliest memory I have is there's\ntwo of them\none is there was a bully in the\nneighborhood lived down the an area\ncalled the plot and we lived up the hill\nand I was out with my friends in the\nalley behind our house and my mother was\nat the pantry looking out the tough guy\nin the neighborhood smacked me was a\ncouple years older than me and I came in\nholding my face and my grandfather was\nat the kitchen table and so what's the\nmatter Joe and he said that's a shame I\nwalked in and my mother said Joey go\nback out there\nso go back out there said walk up to\nwait till he walks up to you as soon as\nhe does smack him right in the nose and\nthen the nose she said I'll give him 50\ncents if you do it and I said why Mom\nshe said you won't be able to walk in\nthat alley again if you don't\nI was scared to death I walked out\npopped him in the nose and bled he ran\nand I thought huh\nit was it worked but uh and I think the\nlesson I learned the most though is I\nused to stutter badly\nand I would\ntalk like like like that and then I'd\ncatch my rhythm and be able\nand it was something that uh\nI thought was the worst curse could\nhappen to me because everybody makes fun\nof it I had a similar experience with\nbeing bullied so that resonates very\nstrongly with me I think everybody does\nyeah I was the run of the litter no I\nreally was I was a little guy and uh I\nwas a relatively good athlete even when\nI was a kid but I literally was the run\nto the litter wow well for me it was my\nweight I was overweight growing up and\nit was the color of my skin I grew up in\nan area where I wasn't surrounded by a\nlot of Indian people and so those were\nthe two reasons except my mother didn't\ngive me that advice sometimes I wish she\ndid my mother did the opposite she\nactually came into my school and spoke\nto the teachers which was really\nembarrassing at that age and you know\nnot helpful for mine no I think maybe it\nis you know I had a similar thing I when\nI was in I went to Catholic grade school\nin high school and you sit in those days\nyou sat in alphabetical order I was in\nthe first row buying four people down\nand reading class everybody read a\nparagraph I got to my paragraph and I\nremember what it was because I used to\ntry to memorize it rather than have to\nlook at the word when I'm rereading it\nand it said and he was a gentle man and\nthis and the teacher said what's that Mr\nBiden he wanted gentlemen but it was\neasier to not instead of say gentle man\nI said gentlem I said Mr Biden what is\nthat and I got up and walked out\nand walked home which is about two miles\nmy mother was sitting there tapping the\ntable when I walked in and said get in\nthe car\nwent down the car we walked in went to\nthe principal's office\nsat me outside the door the door is\ncrying I was one of those opaque glasses\nglass windows and it didn't go to the\nceiling anyway to make a long story\nshort she said I'd like to speak to the\nteacher my mother said\nand she said I said I'd like to speak to\nthe teacher so the teacher walks in\nlooked at me like you're in trouble now\nbut I walked in sat down there's a crack\nin the door I'll never forget this\nand my mother Catherine Eugenia Finnegan\nBiden and she she looked and like I said\nwhat did you say to my son she said did\nyou say bubba Biden so I'm just trying\nto make a point Mrs Biden she said if\nyou ever do that again I'll come back\nand rip that Bonnet off your head you\nunderstand me I swear to god wow get up\nwalked out go back to class Joey\nbut you know it's uh\neverybody has something that is tough\nparticularly when you're younger and it\nmakes such a difference when when\nsomebody reaches out I'm sure you had\nalso had some experience with someone\nsaying come on like for example there's\nmore than a handful of young stutters\nthey're not so young anymore that I\nstill keep in touch with and one young\nkid\nintroduced me when I ran for president\ntook such courage because he talked to\ntalk like like that and he practiced it\nhe practiced it he practiced but it's\nhad a profound impact on his life\nanother young man when I was uh vice\npresident uh he was I could tell you\ncould tell a stutter\nif you're a stutter just by one year and\nshe was in line with his mom was in\nTennessee and I was doing a thing for Al\nGore\nand uh and she introduced her son and I\ncould see him go\nthe lips I said I said hey I'm about to\nfinish my speech why don't you come help\nme write it and her mother looked at me\nand he looked at me and took him in I\nshowed him how I marked up my speeches\nso that I could get a little Cadence\nwith what I did you ever see the movie\nThe King speech yes of course well the\ngentleman who had that con had a copy of\nThe King's Speech who did sent me a copy\nand I don't know if I had my book with\nme but there's a one of these days I'll\nshow you my speeches I looked at it and\nI marked it up the same way every speech\nI mark up is the same way I think they\nmight have it see the slash marks I put\non yes well it's just to help me but you\nknow there were people who reached out\nto me too maybe that\nimpedim was the best thing ever happened\nto me it's incredible isn't it how I\nchallenge that you're going through\nactually helps you become more\ncompassionate and empathetic towards\nother people it's kind of human nature\nfor most people when you understand the\npain someone's feeling the first\ninstinct is\nlook\nwe we have a expression in the family\nfrom the time I was a kid\nit's all about showing up\nto just being there\nI mean I imagine the times when you were\ndown because they're making fun of your\nIndian Heritage and an all-white\npopulation that having someone come up\nand say hey\ncome on you know I mean let's do boom\nmakes a difference absolutely yeah I'll\nnever forget you've just reminded me Ian\nwindess was his name he was the toughest\nkid in school and he had my back that\nwas that person that reached out to me\nso if anyone had a problem with me they\nhad a problem with him he'd take care of\nit I felt very safe felt very safe with\nit well it really is all about reaching\nout isn't it I mean for real think of\nall the young people today\nI think that there's more anxiety and\nloneliness today than there's been in a\nlong long time you know my friend I\nappointed him Admiral the mcmurthy\nhe was telling me about uh you know the\npercentage of young people today who are\nfeeling lonely alone and sometimes it's\njust just touching just showing up\nI used to get my the CSUN bow who should\nbe said here instead of me would uh\nalways say dad you know I'm trying to\nmake that call you know I'd get in a\nplane and go home and because someone\nhad a a serious problem lost a wife a\ndaughter\nand I and I and he said dad you don't\nhave time when he passed away the\nhundreds of people told me how he called\nhe showed up he was there\nand uh because of people who showed up\nfor me too it just really matters yeah\nyou've been through you mentioned it\nthere you've been through\nso much tragic loss in your life as you\njust mentioned there you\ndidn't run for presidency in 2016\nshortly after the loss of your son\nyou've lost your\nfirst wife and daughter in a horrific\naccident I can't even begin to\nunderstand how someone has the courage\nto process that much loss in grief let\nalone move forward in the way you have\nit's truly admirable\nhow did you begin\nI had an overwhelming advantage in the\nlawsuit that was I had a really close\nfamily and was there for example\nwhen my uh\nwife and daughter were killed my first\nwife and my two boys were very badly\ninjured to tractor Trail and broadside\nI wasn't it was not in the accident when\nI got home from the hospital\nmy sister and husband already gave up\ntheir apartment and moved in helped me\nraise my kid my brother we lived in a\nsuburban area it was more country than\nSuburban and there was a little barn on\na garage bar and my my brother came and\nhe turned the Loft to the barn into an\napartment for himself they were there\nfor me all the time\nI was a gigantic difference my best\nfriend in my life and my sister and my\nbrothers and\nand so I had an enormous advantage and I\nthink that\nwhen you see people who are going\nthrough something tough\nit does matter\nif you reach out\nI mean it does matter like for example\nyou know you have a when you're a\nsenator for all the years I was in a\nsmall state you know so many people on\npeople would pass away a job at the wake\nof the funeral no matter what was\nhappening I learned it early on people\nwould stop and just come and throw their\narms around me\nbecause if they know you know the pain\nthey feel they get some solace in it\nit's not always easy but it's uh it just\nmatters just to\njust to reach out let people know you\nsee them how did you allow yourself to\nreceive that help too I feel like as you\nwere mentioning earlier\nwith the loneliness and the anxiety that\nexists a lot of people\neither struggle to know what to say I\nthink we live in a society where people\nare like but what do I say if they've\ngone through that and the opposite end\nwhat you just said being able to be open\nenough to actually receive help requires\na certain amount of courage and strength\nas well well I was uh\nraising a family for real an extended\nfamily my grandparents as well\nwhere uh my dad had an expression\nfamilies beginning middle and end\nthere's a rule the family growing up not\na joke\nwe didn't notice the time but whenever\nyou wanted to speak to your mother or\nfather\nI mean they said can we he had a problem\nno matter what they're doing they\nstopped no matter what they were doing\nthey stopped and heard listened to you\nand I did the same with my children and\nthey did the same with theirs because\nit's a it's a matter of them knowing\nthat\nyou they are the most important thing in\nyour life if they got a problem you're\nthere to listen\nI have uh seven grandkids uh four or\nmore five I'm old enough to talk on the\nphone you know every day I either text\nthem or call them\nand that matter of fact they're in a\ncampaign they were they were having a I\ndidn't realize they're having an\ninterview\nuh the the four oldest grandchildren\nthey said and just at the time when they\nsaid they call me pop pop calls us every\nday or texts us every day and I called\nthe phone rang while they're in there\nwell I I give my word I had no idea\nthey're in there but it said look I I\njust think\nbeing there\nis is important and it makes such a\ndifference I think\nknowing that someone's going to be there\nfor you just to listen just to just to\nhold you just to hug you yeah I believe\nyou're right I I believe we often over\ncomplicate things we think we have to\nsay the perfect thing we have to have\nthe solution we have to be able to fix\nours I agree\nbut it's just half of just showing up\neven people you don't know that well but\nyou've met\nin fact you'd call and say I'm thinking\nof you I learned this from my experience\nthe day will come\nwhen you open that closet door and you\nsmell the fragrance of her dresses or\nyou're going by that park where you\nwhere you where you walked with your\nchild or your or your wife or your\nhusband\nor the thing that reminds you\nand for the longest time I'll just bring\na tear to your eye\nbut eventually every once in a while\nwill bring a smile to this before it\nbrings a tear to your eye when that\nhappens you know you're gonna make it\nthat's the moment you know I make\ndoesn't mean you still don't cry\ndon't mean that pain still isn't isn't\nreal even years later but you know you\ncan make it I think there's an advantage\nsometimes if you have deep faith\nwhether you're\nyou know Catholic Protestant Hindu\nJewish Muslim you know whatever\nmy family when I want to get an\nimportant message to me they tape it on\nthe mirror of the bathroom I'm serious\ndo you wake up in the morning and yeah\nno it's on the mirror I guess I was down\nearly on and miss not going to be 10\nyears ago when I was down or something\nand uh my daughter Ashley taped on my\nshe's a social worker taped on my mirror\nhappiness is something something to do\nsome of the love and something to look\nforward to even dad you have all those\nthings just remind you you know I think\nwhat you just said about the smile\nbefore the tear is probably one of the\nrealest things I've ever heard I think\nwe often are trying to create a world in\nwhich we only have smiles and we're we\nput pressure on ourselves and the people\naround us to be forever happy\nand what you just said there was was\nreally really resonated with me really\nhit me actually the idea that you will\ncry it will happen but that tiny smile\nthat you experience even through a loss\neven through grief you're fortunate that\nyou got to have that experience that\nallowed you to find that smile at that\ntime and I feel like you've been through\nso many obstacles in your life but I'd\nlove to know what you see as the\nrelationship between vulnerability and\nstrength especially as a leader because\nI think leaders have an overarching\npressure\nto display strength in a certain way\nI'll give an example I coach several\nCEOs and individuals athletes and others\nand one of the CEOs who leads a large\norganization called me a few months ago\nand we were working through some things\ntogether\nand at one point I said to them I said\nit would be really wonderful for you to\ntell your teams that you lead what\nyou've been going through and growing\nthrough\nand they said Jay I don't know if I can\ntell them I don't know if I can tell\nthem\nand I said why and they said well\nbecause it will look like I'm weak\nand I said to them well no you being\nvulnerable and sharing your growth is\nthe greatest strength that's not a\nweakness but that was new because so\nmany leaders feel they have to portray a\ncertain type of strength but even today\nI can see there's a Grace in the way\nyou're sharing well I have a rule that I\nthought that everybody in my my staff\nknew\nbecause I I had when I was a senator for\na long time at one point I don't know\nhow they measured it but I had the same\nstaff longer than anybody in in the in\nthe Senate at the time for example we\nwere doing a very very important supreme\ncourt hearing I was chairman Judiciary\nCommittee and we worked on it very hard\nand did all the research and you know\nanyway and there's one young man with\npeople say he was invaluable because\nhe's the guy who knew all the detail\nabout certain center\nand I found out that uh he was having\ntrouble at home\nand I said I want you to go home\ndon't come to the hearing he said I\ncan't go home\ngo home and you know why because I would\ngo home I have a thousand bosses but\nonly one me no one\nand so I know when I had crashes at home\nraising the boys we were I went home\nI don't know how many years ago it was\nbut in this job and as vice president\nanother person was having some trouble\nat home\nand I found out but I said go home\nthey said no no I can't I got I said if\nyou don't call him I'm going to fire you\ngo home get relationship is a hell lot\nmore important than whatever you're\ndoing for me so that's a rule we have\nnot a joke absolutely not and you never\nhave to tell me why\nall you got to say is I'm not going to\nbe in\nI take it your word if it turns out\nyou're playing games with me I'll learn\nbut I know you too well\ntake the time\nbecause you're not going to be any\nbetter than your relationship\nand it's a little bit what you were just\ntalking about and you know I think\nyou have to ask my staff I don't know\nbut I think they as long as they know\nthat's more important more important\nthan doing whatever specific thing\nyou're doing at that moment for me\nhow do you apply that rule when it feels\nlike what they are working on those\nspecific moment seems obviously to be\nthe most important thing in the world\nhow do you well because there's only one\nadvantage of getting older\nyou've had a lot of experience and uh\nand you can apply a little bit of wisdom\nit's really critical yeah and by the way\nthere's a selfie sax back to it because\nwhen you have a problem\nwith someone you love or some problem\nyou you know you got to deal with it\nyeah and you can't even perform as well\nexactly right yeah absolutely you've\nevery day for years had to make\ndifficult and stressful decisions\nhigh stakes hugely impactful and so many\npeople\nwhen you're making decisions do you\nfollow your head your heart your gut how\ndo you think about decision making\nI don't know how to separate the three\nmany times my heart brings me to the\nproblem\nand my gut\ntells me what I think I want to do\nbut my head meaning the research the\nback sometimes says that's the wrong\nanswer\nI think you're driven by a value set\nyou know what you value you know what\nyou think is important in life you know\nwhat you think is consequential\nand I think people who know what they\nvalue doesn't mean they're better at\nwork but if you follow your values to me\nthey're kind of basic things my dad used\nto have an expression for real said Joey\nEveryone's entitled to be treated with\ndignity everybody dignity was his word\ndignity\nand what I find myself looking through\nthe prison for example I was at an event\nthe other day where I was talking and I\nwere talking about a problem\na mom was having providing for the held\nthe needs of a child of actually a\nteenager\nI said all I can think of when hearing\nabout not being able to afford the\ntreatment\nwas how she's deprived of her dignity\nimagine being a parent\nand you can't do anything about it\nbecause you don't have the financial\nworth wherewithal because you don't have\nthe connection but you don't know where\nto go it's a little bit like you know uh\nI think the most dangerous the most\nhated word in English language in any\nother language translated is cancer you\nhave cancer It just strikes fear in\neverybody well it's one thing to get an\nanalysis by a great doctor but you still\nneed someone to guide you through\nit's complicated\nwhatever and we're finding significant\nbreakthroughs in cancer\nbut you need someone to sort of lead you\nthrough who knows about it\nI think it's the same way with about any\nproblem people have if there's a way to\nlet people know there's an Avenue\nthere's a way through you know I used to\nhave a friend named Bob gold who uh who\ndied a heart attack and I used to say\nBob do you understand me I said Joe and\nI understand you I overstand you but you\ngot to know how to know\nand and that's why we can be so of\nlittle things it can be of enormous\nvalue\nit's like you know you're walking across\nan intersection they don't let me do\nthat anymore but uh you walk across the\nintersection and there's a you know an\nelderly man or woman knowing they're\nwaiting to see if they have enough time\njust grabbing their hand and walking\nthem across\nit's a little tiny thing but it the\nanxiety it relieves yeah no I that that\nresonates the idea of\nthe more we're a part of the solution\nthe less the problem feels overwhelming\nI think so\nI have to admit\nwhen you've been through something\nthat's been particularly difficult\nhelping someone going through it again\nforces you to relive your experience\nlike for example the people I admire\nwhen we have\nfunctions where we're trying to make a\npoint how we can help someone with\nhealth care or whatever it is\nthe people who've been through who show\nup\nand supported\nI always compliment them because it's\nlike it happened yesterday when you\nstart to focus on\nand it's hard we underestimate\nwhat we can do not I'm not enough about\ntime being president I mean just what we\ncan do in terms of\ndealing with people I try to\nunderstand\nwhat is motivating the other person when\nI'm doing things internationally or when\nI personally because if you can\nunderstand what motivates them there's a\nshot\neven with the bad guys you can break\nthrough and get something done there's a\nway\nto expose the meanness\nwithout causing direct conflict for\nexample I remember I went to a Catholic\ngrade school we didn't often get invited\nto the Cotillion you know she was in the\nlocal school down the street in Mount\nPleasant School\nand so I got invited and I was going to\ngo I was all excited about going I think\nit was ninth grade maybe it's 8th grade\na little dance\nand there was a guy who was a good\nathlete that was a relatively good\nathlete he was a good athlete from the\nschool the other school big guy\nbecame friends but uh so I'm getting\ndressed and I didn't have a shirt to\nwear\nso my mother got my uncle's shirt who\nwas a smaller man than my dad\nand French cuffs and rolled up the Cuffs\nso there's who looked like it would fit\nand I couldn't find my desk we couldn't\nfind my dad's cufflinks so my mom went\nand got\na nut and a bolt\nif you I wonder why she was down\ndownstairs in the laundry room looking\nfor and put him I said Mom I can't do\nthis\nthey'll make fun of me I'll be\nembarrassed\nsaid anybody comes up and says you look\nat them and say and here's a story to\nsay this guy Frank came up to me said\nhey look at bite and look what he's got\nhere hey and I looked at him and said\nyou don't have a pair of these and he\nsaid well uh uh uh yeah yeah I got a\npair\nbut I'm serious how do you assess\npeople's motivations like you were just\nsaying that that when you can understand\nsomeone's motivation you can almost\ndisarm them without exposing them which\nis what you just gave that example of\nnow how do we do that so that we go to\nthe root of it I think often we get so\ncaught up in what someone's what we\nthink someone's thinking or what we\nthink someone's saying but actually\ngoing to the heart of it and the root of\nit you know it's hard to explain I get\ncredit for these days for sort of hole\nin the International Community together\nI try to understand\nwhat the circumstance the other world\nleader is facing\nand see if there's a way what I what\nneeds to be done there's a way through\nthat he doesn't or she doesn't have to\nmake a great sacrifice to do what she's\ndoing but help make the case why they're\nhelping\nothers but there's ways to do that and\nit doesn't require a person if there's a\nthey have a fundamental difference with\nyou on a subject but if they're doing\nsomething because they don't have the\npolitical bandwidth to be able to do it\nat home you can provide it\nI will say to this leader sometimes well\nwhy don't you let me criticize you for\nthis or thank you for that or more\nand most of the time now you're going to\noff the top of your head you've got to\nknow some of these people\nthey'll go okay or why don't you why\ndon't you criticize me why don't you\ncriticize me for my not doing something\nand then I'll respond and say okay and\nthen you can do what you want to do it's\njust basic human nature but I think\nI think trying to figure out\nwhat leeway\na person has\nI don't expect everybody to uh that I'm\ndealing with to appear in the second\nedition of the profiles and courage nor\nme I mean it's hard but there's ways you\ncan\nwork not always but you can work through\nthings where you can allow the other\nperson to save face and still get to\nwhere you want to go yes and sometimes\nit works with you're working with two\npeople yes to get that done yeah but\nit's it's just trying to figure out what\nis really\nwhat impediments are in their way to\nkeep them from being able to do what you\nknow you feel in their your gut you know\nthey know they should do that's a great\nperspective I'm so happy you shared that\nbecause so many of us are fixated on\nwhat we want out of something or where\nwe want to get to or what our challenges\nare but Mr President I'm so grateful for\nyour graciousness and kindness and\ngiving me this time today we end every\non-purpose interview with a final five\nand these final five questions uh\nquestions we ask every guest uh and\nthere are some some great ones in here\nfor you so the first question I'm going\nto ask you is what is the best advice\nyou've ever received and what's the\nworst advice you've ever received I\nguess the best advice I've ever seen is\nshow up mm-hmm\njust show up\num be there and get up my mother used to\nsay Joey get up\nnever bow never been never get up just\nget up\nand but showing up is just that's a big\npart and I guess the worst advice I've\never uh received was uh\nholding a grudge\nbecause lots of times when people do\nsomething that is really not good\nis because they were fearful and they\ndid it not a fearful of you but their\ncircumstance and it gets you nowhere\nwhich means people doubt well I'm really\nIrish\num and the joke inside was why it's\nreally Irish but all kidding aside\nremembering is important but holding a\ngrudge is uh it's not helpful very true\nvery true fast time for both of those\nanswers I love it okay second question\na lot of Americans today are seeking\ntherapy as a form of support where does\nthe president seek support and guidance\nin your own challenges and journey well\nuh my best friend\nis my wife\na woman who is probably had more to do\nwith my success than anyone is my sister\nValerie\nand uh my brother Jim and\nI think that's the place where I go most\nbut also\nI have a great advantage over the years\nI've I've grown to have some\ngreat great relationships with people\nI've worked with and or one of my staff\nand I think most of my staff would tell\nyou the senior staff is I don't treat\nthem like they work for me I treat them\nwhich they are they know the reason I\nhire them I want them to know more than\nI know and there's some things that that\nI seek advice from\nfrom a religious perspective\nbut that's really personal yeah\nbeautiful okay third question uh\nI believe it's been said that you told\nyour fast wife when you met her that you\nwanted to be or you one day you would be\nthe president of the United States is\nthat true no it's not true I love it I\nread all this well I did tell her yeah\nand I uh and the same with no man\ndeserves one great love let alone two\nfor real\nthe two women that I married one passed\naway\nwere women I knew when I went out with\nthem the first time I wanted to marry\nthem\nmy first wife I I told her when I met\nher we went to\nI went to I had an 89 tax return I'm on\nFive Guys down to\nFlorida and and I don't drink so I was\nbored with all this so I went to with\nthree I went to Nassau before you could\napply for 25 bucks round trip and I met\nmy my deceased wife and I told her when\nwhen when\nI hung out with her for four days down\nthere on the beach and that I was gonna\nmarry her and she looked at me said I\nthink so and I started commuting every\nday every weekend when I was I was a\nsenior in college that's how I ended up\nwith Syracuse Houston Maryland my\npresent wife was uh it was a blind date\nthat my brother set up for us and I know\nwhen I saw her I was on that 10 more\nsales ambassador's list for five years\nand it's not a fun thing because there\nwere a lot of them don't get me wrong a\nlot of nice people but I had kind of\ngiven up on I say thinking I could have\nus and I got this blind date I'm never\nhere my brother said you like her she\ndoesn't like politics\nI'm glad to answer that question uh\nquestion number four this is very\nimportant to social media so the\nquestion is there are so many shows\ntoday based on the presidency the White\nHouse mirroring it shows on TV streaming\nplatforms which one is the most accurate\nand which one is the least accurate\nMission Impossible\nthe most I'll lose most\num look uh I\none of the problems I have is I don't\nand I should I don't watch much\ntelevision you know and it's not because\nI'm above it or anything like that it's\njust this\nfor example for 36 years after the\naccident occurred and I commuted every\nday 300 miles a day\nand uh and uh and the press action I had\none I got to know all the conductors so\nwell I became friends and one day as\nvice president I was going home on the\ntrain which the secret surf doesn't like\nbecause there's so many opportunities to\ninterrupt the train\num and this particular I'm not going to\nembarrass him and send his name company\ngrab him and she gets Joey baby and I\nthought they're going to shoot him and I\nsaid no no he said I just read in the\npaper you traveled a million one hundred\nthousand miles on Air Force planes\nbecause you've got to list how many\nmiles of trail on and he said big deal\nhe said Joey we had a retirement dinner\nhe said you know what you figured out\nyou know how many miles you travel on\nAmtrak I said no\nhe said a million two hundred thousand\nmiles 119 days a year 300 a day 300\nmiles round trip 36 years plus\nmy point was I was on a training a lot\nand uh so when I get home there wasn't\nmuch to watch I mean not it was to watch\nbut I'd I'd always make sure I think and\nI think you know you every all your\nguests know this that children need to\nknow that they're the most important\nthing in your life so even if I got home\nlate I'd climb in bed or my my two boys\nat the time and just even if they're\nasleep and get up in the morning and it\nwasn't like Ozzie and Harriet I wasn't\nfixing their breakfast but I'd be there\nand have breakfast them they'd take off\nfor school I take off for the train\nso I've been back and forth so much I\nhaven't I just haven't watched many pro\nand by the way there's a lot of good\nstuff I'm sure I mean every once in a\nwhile I turn it on and by the way they\ngot a great Advantage here you got a\nmovie theater\nyeah and they tell me I get this list\nwhat movies are in and we have the uh\nthe the new one that's the um\nyeah I haven't seen it yet I haven't\neither yeah they're they're they're the\nmovies I see these days I get to see\nthem at night once in a while okay very\nnice amazing all right Fifth and final\nquestion we asked this question to every\nguest who's ever been on the show but it\ntruly is unique asking you this question\nif you could create one law in the world\nthat everyone had to follow\nwhat would it be I don't think it's a\nmatter of being able to have any one law\nthat could change people's\nattitudes I think I'm optimistic I think\nwe have we're on the cusp we're in a\ntime of\nreal change and and we're in an\ninflection point in moral history\nwhether I'm present or not things are\ngoing to change drastically and you see\nit happening all around the world\nand we have an enormous opportunity but\nthe thing I wanna\ncould want to change\nis the American attitude that we can do\nanything\nwe can do anything there's nothing we've\never set our mind to we've not been able\nto do we've done together for real\nand so I laid out four things that I\nthought were critically important in my\nstate and you know one was to make a\nfundamental change in cancer treatment\nwe can cure a lot and that's why I put\nanother six billion dollars I mean pick\nthe impossible thing\nI have Caroline Kennedy gave me a copy\nof President Kennedy's part of President\nKennedy's speech went about going the\nmoon he said because we refused to\npostpone we have to refuse to postpone\nanymore there's so much we can do and I\nmean it I believe it with every fiber in\nmy being I've been doing this a long\ntime and I've never been more optimistic\nabout our chances than now that's why\nwhen I ran I said I ran for three\nreasons one to restore the soul of\nAmerica sense of decency just the way we\ntalk to one another secondly to build\nthis country from the middle out and the\nbottom up the wealthy still do very well\nbut everybody has a shot and thirdly to\nunite the country and I think we can do\nit I really genuinely do and uh but then\nagain as my often referred to I'm a\ncockeyed Optimist but uh but I really\nbelieve it Mr President thank you so\nmuch for the honor I'm so grateful I\nhave two tiny requests for you I'd love\nI'd love for you if you don't mind to\nwalk me through what's here because I\nsaw these beautiful pictures when I\nwalked in and I thought they looked\nreally special and I'd love for you to\nshare them this one\nmy dad was uh was a real gentleman and a\nwell-read man never got a chance to go\nto college\nand uh you know I said Joe he never\nexplained never complained\nand so we were having uh my fourth\nreelection effort as a senator in the\nlate 90s and my dad was over at our\nhouse to\nyou know to be there with me and I was\nstanding on this back porch overlooking\nthis Pond I built a smaller home when\nthe home we had everybody moved out but\nit sits on a pond a 10-acre pond and I\nwas saying my deceased wife she lived in\nLake Skaneateles and the Finger Lakes\nbeautiful she I said you know I wish\nNeely could have seen this and so and my\ndad thought I was I didn't feel sorry\nfor myself\nso he came he said I'll be back and he\ntook off he went up to the locals uh\nHallmark store and came back with this\ncartoon\nthis is his philosophy of life it's\nHagar the Horrible lightning strikes his\nboat's going down he's looking up to God\nand having to say why me the next frame\nof voice never goes by why not\nmy dad always say what makes you so\nspecial you don't have these problems\nI'll put it down here the other ones\nthere's a bunch there but uh what am I\ngoing to highlight well one of my\nfavorite ones is uh of that that one my\nson Beau\nthis is when he came home from being a\nwreck for a year\nwith his unit and uh\nthis is his son little Hunter got on his\nshoulders and wouldn't get off his\nshoulders just would not I mean for\nhours it was on his shoulders the others\nare my mom and dad my that's my daughter\nthe love of my life the life of my love\nanyway there's a lot up there I'm\nbeautiful I'm probably boring the hell\nout of here not at all not at all I\nthought it was wonderful to see them\nwhen I came in so thank you well like I\nsaid my dad really was one of these guys\nand and was about and so was my mother's\nside of the family that family my dad\nwould say it's the beginning the middle\nof the end\nand I believe it is I mean I know what\nyou're trying to do is all those folks\nout there that are lonely and all those\nfolks out there that are feeling uneasy\nall those folks out there that aren't\nsure\nI don't know I just\njust sometimes just reaching out it\nmakes a difference\nthank you Mr President thank you thank\nyou so much you're doing good work for\npeople I really mean it thank you thank\nyou that means the world coming from you\nand I look forward to many more\nconversations thank you thank you one\ntwo three\nokay amazing\n[Music]"
