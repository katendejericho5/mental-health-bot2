the\nbest-selling authoring host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nMike let's dive straight into it because\nyou truly have one of the most\nfascinating Journeys I believe on the\nplanet and so I want to try and get into\nas much of it today and I think a lot of\nour audience will be familiar some of\nthem won't be familiar at all so I'd\nlove to get into some of those details\nbut can you walk me through\none of your earliest childhood memories\nthat you think has had a big impact on\non who you are today or how you are the\nway you are today do you have a\nchildhood memory or an interaction with\nyour parents or an interaction with a\nfriend or a teacher that you think is\nstayed with you I think when I was very\nyoung\nI had this love of data and knowledge\nmy favorite book was the almanac\nand at night I'd have it under my pillow\ntake out a flashlight and read it and my\nparents had these bridge clubs where\nadults would come over\nand come once a month and I'd have a\nchance to interact with 15 16 in some\ncases 20 adults and what I discovered in\nthis interaction is very few people ever\ndid research\nwhen you ask a person why they believe\nin something Etc they heard it from\nsomeone else\nand it might be based on fact it might\nbe based on fiction and so from a very\nyoung age\nI began to question why people held\ncertain beliefs why they made certain\ndecisions\nand and explore data and information and\nI'd say the first major event was\ndiscovering\nthat my father had had polio\nI had no knowledge and then one day\na friend that was over we were playing\ncatch told me my father had a limp I\nreally never noticed it\nand I was thrust into the world in the\nearly 1950s of what polio was\nwhat occurred the understanding of it\nthe fact that in 1952 it was declared an\nepidemic and the United States\nwas worried that it would bankrupt the\ncountry having to build iron lung hotels\nto keep people alive\nwell a few years later there was a\nsolution\nand there was a vaccine created two\npeople worked on it\nand it became prevalent but what I also\nnoticed was\nthat teenagers\nwere not taking the vaccine their\nparents because they were worried the\nvaccine was going to give them polio and\nso the end of the story was there was an\nindividual\nwho went on a very popular show in the\nUnited States called The Ed Sullivan\nShow that we used to watch\nand more than a year after it was\navailable less than one percent of every\nteenager in America had been vaccinated\nand this individual's name was Elvis\nPresley\nand because it was okay for Elvis\nafterwards within one year eighty\npercent were vaccinated and so there was\na lot to learn here from this one\nbecause you had a solution didn't mean\npeople would adopt it\nto the fact that this was considered\nsomething that was going to bankrupt the\ncountry was obviously proven wrong\nnumerous people were affected by it but\nI think at the Peaks only 62 000 people\nand this has repeated itself throughout\nhistory\nof people telling you the world is\ncoming to an end\nit's not going to come to end and\nscience coming to the rescue wow yeah\nincredible I'm so excited to dive into\nso many of those ideas that you just\nmentioned that throughout the course of\nour interview I want to go back to that\nposition of you starting out you came\nfrom a modest background\nbut and you've had lots of successes and\nthen valleys in your life Peaks and\nvalleys if you walk us into the\ndirection of your first Peak did you\nalways set out to be financially\nsuccessful when you first created that\nfirst success in your life what was the\nwould you say the key principles that\nyou used in order to manufacture that\nfirst success that you had I did not\nplan to go into the financial service\nbusiness\nI wanted to run the space program\nand I was totally infatuated when\nSputnik went up it was a catastrophe if\nyou read the headlines in the United\nStates at the time\nthere was the middle of the Cold War now\nquote Soviet Union had beaten the United\nStates into space\nand I was very very good in math and\nscience and I wrote a letter to the\npresident of the United States told them\nI was ready to run the Space Program now\nI never really got a response I was 11\nyears old but that was my plan\nand my plan was I went to Berkeley which\nwas a leader in Nobel Prize winners and\nthe Sciences\nand I Was preparing someday to run the\nspace program\nthen I was in Los Angeles where we are\ntoday\nduring something that became known as\nthe Watts Riots\nit was August 11 1965.\nand Los Angeles was on fire the City of\nDreams the city of entertainment\nI had just been in Berkeley and we had\nthe Free Speech movement six or seven\nmonths before but this was different the\ncity was on fire\nand I went and met a young\nAfrican-American man\nwho told me he would never have a chance\nto borrow money to have a business his\nfather didn't because of the color of\nhis skin\nit seemed totally irrational to me\nand I decided to go back and figure out\nwhy this was occurring when I went back\nto Berkeley and began to study credit\nand very similar to when I was younger I\ndiscovered everything that people said\nabout credit was wrong it didn't make\nany difference if you're the Secretary\nof the Treasury the head of the Federal\nReserve and what they were saying was in\ninaccurate and so I set on a path\nI had to give up my dream at that time\nof the Space Program\nto begin working on what I might have\ncalled the democratization of capital\nand I pursued that\nduring this period of time from 1965 for\nthe next 20 to 25 years so\nI that was not my path\nbut the studying and what I had done as\nan undergrad and then as a grad student\nin my decision to quote go to Wall\nStreet was really to redirect the access\nto Capital have a fundamental change\nand yes in the next 30 Years 62 million\njobs in the United States were created\nthere's always a backlash as a physic\nmajor for every Force there's resistance\nand so changing the financial system at\nthat time\nmany people wish that I didn't exist the\nidea that you were a large company and\nyou had access to Capital and the others\ndidn't\nso there were 500 investment grade\ncompanies and tens of millions of\nnon-investment grade companies well once\nyou Empower them and created financial\nmarkets\nwe discovered 62 million jobs were\ncreated in non-investment grade\ncompanies and minus four\nso there was a lot of change today\nthere's hundreds of firms headed by\npeople that work for me\nand I would say it's those structures\nare the basis\nof modern financial markets around the\nworld but it's not it is not unusual at\none of our scientific retreats\nand the first part of this Century I was\nin the back of the room and I invited\ntwo young people from Australia to come\nand speak\nand they commented that everything you\nthought about ulcers was wrong\neverything they were telling you about\nulcers\nand these two senior scientists I had\nthere in the back of the room one turned\nthe other and said who are these yobos\nthey didn't even go to a good school\nwell four years later these yobo's won a\nNobel Prize so challenging conventional\nwisdom and Theory I think has been\nsomething I've tried to do is you try to\nmove forward create jobs solve medical\nproblems throughout my life and it goes\nall the way back\nto my little Almanac and discovering my\nfather had Polio one thing I'm noticing\nfrom your answers is that you have this\nKeen ability to spot patterns and\nanalyze patterns you're almost seeing\nthat there are systems which ultimately\nare patterns that no longer serve us and\nyou believe that there are better\nsystems or better patterns that would\nhave an impact on the world and you also\nhave used the word study a few times in\nyour first few answers\nand I think there's this big difference\nbetween academic study and pattern study\nand I find that the most successful\npeople in the world are great at\nstudying patterns it's not really about\nthe academic study could you help break\nboth of those down for us because I feel\nlike you're probably the best person to\nask that question to in genuinely\nunderstanding the difference because I\nthink we hear the word study but when\nyou say the word study you mean\nsomething else I would say\nextremely insightful\nso we could say there is inductive\nreasons there's deductive reasons the\nvery first speech I gave on Wall Street\nwas the best investor was a social\nscientist\nunderstanding what things were in a\nbigger world and stepping back\nand then going down and looking at the\ndata\nto find out if your broad ideas of the\nworld\nwere changing\nin the last few months the world has\nopened up\nto the idea of where are the children of\nthe world\nfor 20 years the handwriting has been on\nthe wall the world did not open up to it\nuntil the last short period of time here\nbut the birth rate in Northern Asia\nEurope the United States has dropped so\nsignificantly\nthat where is the population of the U.S\nhas doubled there are less children born\ntoday\nthan there were 70 years ago in the\nUnited States China's birth rate has\ndropped so low that the number of\nchildren born in China last year was\nless than 10 million so you think about\na country of 1.4 billion\nbut of average life expectancy taking\nthose that live to a hundred and\naveraging with those that die young\nis 75. if you have 10 million children\nborn a year\nand you multiply it by 75 that's a\npopulation of 750 million not a billion\nfour and so as people think about things\nwe've had more people dying in Japan now\nfor a very long period of time\nthan are born and so they have a\ndecreasing population and most of the\ndeveloped worlds\nthe birth rate is below replacement but\nthis has not been going on for since the\npandemic this has been going on for a\nlong period of time and so when do you\nsee it\nand so about 20 30 years ago became\nquite concerned because it appeared to\nus\nthat the future where the children were\ngoing to be born was in sub-Saharan\nAfrica and the rest of the world as a\nwhole\nmight be decreasing in terms of\npopulation so what were the\nopportunities going to be for the\nchildren of sub-Saharan Africa and today\nin 2023 more children are born in\nNigeria\nthen all of Western Europe Eastern\nEurope throw in Russia by a substantial\namount and more than twice as many\nchildren are born and not just Nigeria\nthan the United States so people are\nlooking at where you are here\nnow when I had my little almanacs I was\ntoo young to know\nthat if you matched one Almanac against\nanother Almanac\nyou were asking actually getting the\nfirst derivative you were measuring\nchange\nand then if you had a few of them you\nwere measuring the rate of change and so\nI think when answering your question you\nhave to look at the broad social\nimplications and what is occurring then\nyou have to ask yourself do the systems\nthat currently exist\nfit where the world is going\nI then if I had four almanacs could\ncalculate the second derivative the rate\nof change\nand I would say this is prevalent in\nmedicine you could be diagnosed with\ncancer\nis it a slow growing cancer or is it a\nfast growing\nin the case of melanoma it doubled every\nmonth if it was a van so a billion\ncancer cells wanted 10 months later are\na trillion other cancers are very slow\ngrowing so you could take your time to\naddress it and so understanding the rate\nof change\nand today what's happening in the world\nand where the children are born and the\nfacts that they're going to need\nopportunities they're going to need jobs\nor we're going to see one to two billion\npeople\non the move so the question is when how\nearly do you see that and one of the\nexciting things about medicine today is\nin the 1980s there was this idea that\neverything was in your blood\nwell you didn't know what to look for\nyou couldn't sequence you couldn't do\nanything\nso might be there but I can't find it\nnow today we now have tests that can\nmeasure the waste the DNA leakage in\nyour blood so you can find a\nlife-threatening disease today when\nthere's just a very small amount of\ncells in your body long before you could\never find it in a mammogram or a CT or\nan MRI and so therefore dealing with\nthese life-threatening diseases today at\ntheir infancy is so much easier but this\nwas a dream\nuntil computers were a million times\nfaster and data storage costs were one\nbillionth it was an idea it was a dream\nbut it wasn't a reality absolutely thank\nyou for sharing that I wanted to before\nwe dive into all the incredible work\nyou've done in healthcare I definitely\nwanted to talk about this part of your\njourney which we've talked about\npersonally but\nyou making all these shifts and changes\nand pushing the boundaries you ended up\ngoing to prison in 1990 after pleading\nguilty to several felony charges related\nto Securities violations but to me\nI'm fascinated by a how that happened\nfor you but B more importantly how you\nuse that time because the comeback now\nlooking backwards it's it's incredible\nbut to live that uh Steve Jobs famously\nsaid you can always connect the dots\nlooking backwards you can't when you're\nmoving forwards I just can't imagine\nsomeone who had such a vision someone\nhad such incredible ideas to challenge\nthe status quo Enterprise go to prison\nwalk us through first of all how did you\nend up there\nand then and then we'll talk about what\nit was like there because I think that's\njust such a\ninteresting part of your journey now\nlooking backwards well I think that\nissue there was an unusual period of\ntime\nand once again in complete revolution in\nfinance\nthere are many points in history where\nyou've had people that were presidents\nwent to prison Brazil today and are now\nthe president of the country again\nso when the president gave me a pardon\nhe commented\nthat these things were never crimes\nbefore they've never been crimes since\nthey related to bookkeeping and things\nlike that\nbut I had to find a way to bring it to\nan end\nand I if you fought for 10 or 20 years\nto me I had to find a way to live again\nand so I think if you're true to\nyourself and you know the issues and the\nindividuals know you\nI viewed this it was going to be a short\nperiod of time\nand I had to cut it short and make a\ndecision for my family Etc to live again\nand it was a short period of time in the\nscheme of things when I think of the\ndiversion of less than two years\nif I go back to World War II you had\npeople that volunteered\nand were gone for four years fighting\nfor freedom and what they believed in\nand so I think my view was that I had to\nfind a solution to bring it to an end\nand and it didn't really change who I\nwas what I did\nthe financial systems we built are now\nadopted throughout the world whether\nyou're in India or Singapore or whatever\nit might be and yes\nthere was disruption in the force\nI would say to you if you think about a\ncountry you and I first met in the UK\nwhen the mo when the Mercantile class\nrose up in England\nwho was under threat the nobility\nand so the mobility would go to the king\nor the queen and say well we can't\ncompete anymore what are we going to do\nbut the old Financial system didn't\nreally meet\nthe future needs of the world and so yes\nI spent time thinking I got to tutor\nindividuals help them get their\neducation how did you spend your days\nfor those two years I spent my time\nthinking about the world I would write\nsometimes ambassadors\nand around the world suggesting what I\nthink they should have done or should do\nor what the country should do\nso it didn't it didn't interrupt those\ninteractions it didn't stop our\nphilanthropic efforts\nEtc I did get to interact with a group\nof people at that time the group\nthat was in the prison camp this was a\nvery low security area where primarily\nthere for drugs marijuana\nship captains and other types of things\nand so\nit was a period of time I was able to\ninteract with my family I think anyone\nthat's separated from their family and\nwhen I think back\nto those people that went and fought in\nWorld War II in the 1940s\nthat might have been separated for four\nyears their only way of communicating\nwith their family was through a letter\nyou know the telephone was invented and\nin\nlong distance call when I was young no\none made long distance calls because it\nwas 10 to 12 minutes to call another\ncountry so in the 1970s if I wanted to\nspeak to Mumbai\nI had to be prepared it was ten dollars\nto twelve dollars a minute so those\ncalls had to be short\nand that was a period of time\nin that period of time when a person's\nsalary was hundreds of dollars a week\nnot thousands of dollars a week\ntoday people have a hard time relating\nto that because it's free on WhatsApp\nor on your phone but I could communicate\nwith my children my family and so when\nyou're separated the first thought is is\nyour family going to be okay\nare your relationships\nmy wife and I had known each other since\nwe were 12.\nshe knew who I was I knew who she was\nmy business associates thousands of them\nknew who I was knew the issues and so it\nwasn't a situation where I felt\nseparated from the world\nyou know and therefore communication\nstill existed\na telephone existed you weren't allowed\nto have a cell phone but you could make\na call on a pay phone so I it wasn't the\nsame separation when I think of many\npeople that were sent to the gulag in\nRussia\nthere's you know whether it was\nsolenitsin or others or sharansky they\nwrote about\nhow they took away their Communications\nthey took away their visits they even\ntook away pencil and paper\nthey took away books and one of them\nwrote that he know he knew he had won\nthen because there was nothing else\nthat they could take away and so I think\nhaving Inner Strength is extremely\nimportant during that period when I\nthink about my challenges\nrelative to the tens of millions of\npeople\nthat have gone off to fight in Wars\nmy parents generation that lived through\nthe Depression and World War II so that\nwe could be free\nmy difficulties were very small relative\nto theirs I think it's incredible amount\nof inner strength not only to be able to\nnavigate those two years even though you\nare saying you didn't feel that long in\nthe bigger scheme of things that I still\nbelieve that there is such a resilience\nthere but the way you came back well\nlet's just talk about Mandela you're\ntalking more than 20 years yeah 27. okay\nand did he come back bitter no\nokay and in South Africa became quite\ndifferent let's say than Zimbabwe as\nRhodesia went so here instead of being\nbitter and when he got out I had a\nchance to visit with him we came to see\neach other\nand so\nmy view was revenge or bitterness\nis an unproductive emotion\nif you have something to give and focus\nand build\nyou have to focus going forward you\ncan't sit and focus on the path\nand I had thousands of people that had\nworked for me\nwho could carry on our mission in\nfinance\nin our foundations by forming the Milken\nInstitute\ndidn't change much what I had done in\nthe for-profit world there I now did in\nthe non-profit world so my view was the\ninsights the ideas carried on and I I'm\nsure\nyou know the current president in Brazil\nwho spent a short time in prison\nyou know has certain views but he has so\nmany responsibilities and things he has\nto do for Brazil\nif he was stuck in the past Brazil\nwouldn't have a future I'm so glad you\nbrought up Nelson Mandela does a\nbeautiful statement number is where he\nsaid that when I walked out of the gates\nof the jail\nI realized that if I was to hold on to\nthat resentment or bitterness that I\nwould still be in prison\nand along those lines and I think that's\nsuch a powerful statement of his that he\nbelieved that resentment and bitterness\nand revenge were the actual prison that\nwould hold and limit him moving forward\nwell as you know well and your viewers\nknow well there are so many people in\nthe world\nthat have mental health issues today\nand in many ways they're all traced to\nsomething in their past\nand so being free\nbeing free\nof your past\nnot forgetting it not reflecting on it\nnot having it be part of your decision\nprocess allows you to go forward\nand to fly from that standpoint\nabsolutely I want to talk about your\nswitch from Financial world to medical\nresearch but before we do that I want to\ntalk about your own Journey with being\ndiagnosed with terminal prostate cancer\nwhich I can't imagine is an easy thing\nto hear at such a young age as well when\nyou first received that what was it like\nto receive such a diagnosis as someone\nagain who is thinking about the future\ntrying to build were you someone who is\nquite focused on your health as well or\nwere you somewhat negligent because you\nwere focused on work and how did it feel\nto hear that I would say to you I\nprobably had one of the least healthy\ndiets in the world until that day I was\ndiagnosed\nbut I experienced this with my father's\ndeath\nin the 1970s and it was the first time\nmy economic theories\nwere tested during a period of time from\n73 to 77 which I would call my financial\nclinical trials all the ideas that I had\ndeveloped\nand by the the mid-1970s I had become\nindependently wealthy with the success\nof those ideas\nand most of them ninety percent of the\npeople\nbelieved we were headed to this\nFinancial\ndepression again and My Views were no we\nweren't in history so\nbut I could not save my father's life\nfrom melanoma\nand it had a significant view here that\nit was the first time in my life\nthat I could not solve a problem I could\nhelp rebuild a company\nI might be able to help rebuild a\ncountry financially but I could not find\na decision I visited all these senior\npeople and I went to the major medical\ncenters travel with my dad and I\nconcluded by 1976 that science could not\nmove fast enough no matter what I had\ndone\nor could do\nto save my father's life\nso I had made the decision then to move\nback to California\nso that my two children my wife Lori and\nI two children at the time would know my\nfather before he died and he died about\nnine months after we moved back to\nCalifornia and then I moved\nfamilies Etc thousands of people back to\nCalifornia\nand so this has stayed with me I've lost\n10 relatives to cancer and my diagnosis\nwas worse than theirs so obviously I'm\nnow reflecting\nwhat am I going to do and when it looked\nlike I had 18 months to live\nyou have to figure out what could I do\ndifferent than they did and the first\ndecision I made is I would focus on\nanything that's reversible\nso for two years I did not eat anything\nexcept fresh fruit and fresh vegetables\nI had no idea whether it would benefit\nme\nbut I figured it wouldn't hurt me\nand none of my relatives or friends who\nhad died from life-threatening diseases\nhad ever changed or died\nand as I explored the world of the chi\nmedicine in China\nor ayurveda medicine in India or witch\ndoctors and the central part of Africa\nor Indians in the Northwest Amazon or\nhealers\nfrom Russia\nyou know it came to me that I I would\nreally focus on ayurveda medicine\nand in the 5 000 year history the belief\nwas your gut your microbiome was your\nsecond brain\nso everything you eat everything you\ndrink everything you exercise everything\nyou're experiencing\nis going into your second brain so I was\ngoing to change my second brain even\nthough there was no proof you couldn't\nsequence at the time\nand so that was a focus that I focused\non and I think the other thing I was\nvery focused on is\nthat most people diagnosed with a\nlife-threatening disease\ndo the least they can do at day one\nand if it reoccurs later in life they do\neverything they can to stay alive but if\nyou had done more at the beginning\nthen you have had a better chance and so\nonce I had driven my cancer burden to\nwhat appeared to be zero\nI then made the decision have radiation\nwhereas someone else might have done\nnothing because I figured the burden was\nthe least\nand so I set off on this journey\nthinking about my father and my\nrelatives and friends and I had a bunch\nof friends that I had interacted with\nthat had passed away\nthat how could I accelerate science\nso first\nI could try to change my body\nand at this time we weren't talking\ncrispr we weren't talking about a\ntechnology that could change your genes\nthat is still not widely to deploy\nbecause we don't know as we create a new\nhuman race\nwhether this is good or bad\nand so I set off on this journey of how\nto accelerate science\nbut that journey in science is not much\ndifferent than my journey in finance or\nthe journey we took in education and\nwhat we did\nI was going to try to attract the best\nand most talented people in the world to\ncome work in this field\nand\nno matter how talented you were\nif you were the individual that\nperceived the future was mobile phones\nor cell phones Craig McCall\nthat was a good idea but unless you had\naccess to billions of dollars you could\nnever access that idea if you were Bill\nMcGowan and believed fiber optics would\nchange\nand we could drive the cost over time\nfrom twelve dollars a minute to talk to\nIndia to zero\nyou needed billions of dollars so the\nsame focus of attention one\nattract the best and brightest to work\nin the field two bring enough financial\nCapital to serve as a multiplier effect\nand three\ncreate teamwork\nmany organizations have people\nthat have real talent\nbut they don't act as a team they don't\nact as one\nand therefore\nwhat I saw in medicine there was no team\nthere was not enough financial capital\nand many of the brightest people were\nnot working in this field so those were\nthe first levels I was focused on but\nthat was no different in education we\nhad created a national educator award to\nattract the best and brightest into the\nfield and finance had searched out the\nworld's leading entrepreneurs providing\nthem capital and advice and helped\ncreate teams for them so that that was\nthe revolution\nthat began in 93 in healthcare and\nmedical research and I faced just as\nmuch resistance\nas I did in the financial Revolution\nthe first comment was prove it\nwell in 1993 you couldn't prove anything\nI could show you anecdotal evidence\nthat in places of the world where people\nwere plant eaters China\nnot meat eaters\nthat the incidence of hormone-driven\ncancers or diabetes was far less\nand in places that we had different\ndiets fast food diet it was far more\nso yes there was anecdotal evidence and\nso they said we'll prove it well you\ncouldn't sequence the human genome you\ncouldn't do anything\nin 1993 and Francis Collins who I met in\n93 set off on a journey to sequence\nit wasn't until many many years later\nand billions of dollars that they\ncompleted that\nand I'll never forget in 1994 I had one\nof our scientific Retreats with the\nworld's leading clinicians in cancer and\nscience\nand I wanted to get a Dr David Heber who\nhad founded the center for human\nnutrition PhD MD at UCLA on the program\nand the people in charge of the program\nsaid you know Mike\nwe're going to lose credibility\nif we have this soft science ideas that\nthere's some relationship between what\nyou eat\nand whether you're getting cancer\nand they fought me and told me it would\ndegrade what we're trying to build here\nas the leading cancer research group in\nthe world\nand I eventually reached a compromise\nwith him he would get to speak at lunch\nI wrote about it he would not be on the\nprogram\nhe would not have a microphone and if\nyou wanted to listen you had to sit\nclose and if you didn't want to be\ninfected with this idea\nthat there might be a link\nto how you live your life and what you\neat and what you drink in your health\nyou could just sit far away and weren't\nhave to\n25 years later Jay 25 years later I went\nto our scientific Retreat I was not in\ncharge of the programming\nand maybe 20 percent\nof every session over four days was\ncancer and your microbiome so\ninitially putting forth ideas that\nchallenge the status quo whether it's\nFinance whether it's education or\nwhether it's medical are challenged\nlater\nthey're accepted\nwell accepted and anyone could have\nthought of that idea yeah no it's it's\nso fascinating because I feel like\ncoming from an Indian background and my\nwife being an ayurvedic health counselor\nand\nyou're so exposed to the idea early on\nthat your gut health is such a big part\nof your overall health but you're so\nright that until we see it in the\nresearch and the science and Beyond the\nanecdotes we don't fully comprehend\nthese ideas and so you're accelerating\nthat research now what would you say\nwere the biggest challenges you saw when\nyou entered the medical field in\nresearch and in our treatment of\ndiseases so I had entered the field in\nthe early 1970s for 20 years but I was\nprimarily a donor\nEtc and as I mentioned\nscience was not moving fast enough to\nsave my father's life\nso I'm in 93 decided I couldn't help\nothers if I couldn't help myself\nand I first had to survive\nbut there were those three elements one\nteamwork partnership so I wrote about I\nwent to this MD Anderson and the two\nleading Cancer Centers often on rated in\nthe world were either MD Anderson or\nMemorial Sloan Kettering in New York one\nin Houston one in New York\nand I noticed there was no one from\nMemorial Sloan Kettering at the Cancer\nconference in Houston and I told the\nperson putting the conference on why is\nthere no one here from Memorial Sloan\ncavernier for trying to accelerate\nresearch and he told me\nhe viewed Memorial Sloan Kettering as a\ncompetitor\nand I told him not to the patient so\ntherefore\nonce we promised funding for research in\nthis field\nwe would only fund if you shared all\nyour data\nand I eventually gone on my board Andy\nGrove who was the CEO of Intel\nand we worked on this is early\ntechnology with computers and connecting\nthat we would connect all of our\nresearchers digitally together\nand it might be easier for someone in MD\nAnderson to talk to someone at Memorial\nSloan Kettering via technology then\nsomeone else to find an MD Anderson but\nwe told them that we couldn't fund any\nof their research unless they shared\ntheir data now some people told me well\nI have to wait for nature or sell\nmagazine to come out the story will be\nout in a year\nand we told them that their research was\nso important\nthat they didn't need any of our funds\nour funds were only for those who are\nwilling to share and I would say within\nsix months everyone in the world was\nwilling to share\nand no matter how much we raised in\nmoney I was out there first recruiting\nthe best and brightest and second trying\nto convince people who were thinking of\nleaving the field\nto stay in the field\nand I wrote In the book a little bit\nabout an individual who was being\nrecruited to make better apples\nand I was successful in convincing him\nthat we could live and still eat the\nsame apples\nfor maybe the next 20 years but people\nbeing diagnosed with cancer throughout\nthe world and the fact it was going to\nbe increasing not decreasing\nwe couldn't wait for Solutions and so\nand then the the other element I would\nsay to you was government\nthere is no individual there is no\nFoundation my family foundations which\nwere created and today there's with our\ncenters more than 10 of them\nnor Bill Gates and Melinda Gates The\nGates Foundation Plus Warren Buffett\nuh which is one of his largest\nFoundation today in the world\nthe amount of money they have\nis small relative to the government\nso if you can redirect the funds of the\ngovernment\nyou now have access to hundreds of\nbillions of dollars that could be\nredeployed\nand so we spent two to three years\nmaking the economic argument\nof what the elimination of cancer was\nbut one of the challenges when you talk\nabout challenges\nwe were not able as a country to\nincrease significantly our investment in\nthe National Institutes of Health the\nlargest medical research group in the\nworld\nand I discovered in my analysis that one\nof the reasons was there were 500\ndifferent diseases constantly appealing\nfor more funds and so unlike a laser you\nhad all these voices out there whether\nit's Parkinson's whether it was\nAlzheimer's whether it's diabetes\nand there wasn't a focused request and\nso beginning two years later in 95 I\nwent to the various disease specific\ngroups and said if you will stand down\nwe will have a combined effort focused\non Cancer all cancers\nlike a laser to double the NIH budget\nand we will work on that and when it's\ndoubled all medical research will double\nnot just cancer\nand they agreed and so we put on a March\nit took three years\nand all this data Etc to show and\ninteracted with our political leaders\nthat this would be one of the best\ninvestments the country could make and\nthe leaders in the world\nin the 22nd century will be the leaders\nand the 21st century in bioscience\nand so with the March concluding in 98\nthe president of the United States\nshortly thereafter signed into law what\nbecame the doubling\nof the NIH budget\nthere's been an incremental 500 billion\ndollars in basic research spent\nit laid the groundwork for what we did\nto get a quick solution for covet 19.\nevery disease has benefited from it\nthe financial commitment was 10 million\ndollars in the March\ntoday there's a 500 billion dollar\npayoff so\nthe first efforts of individual\nphilanthropy\nthe efforts of recruiting\nyoung scientists to work in the field\nwhich is probably the highest rate of\nreturn in any philanthropy that I've\nseen\nthe cause of teamwork was coupled now\nwith the increased benefit of getting\nthe government focused on this area well\nand I want to read out this is on page\n111 of the book where you talk about a\nnew type of organization and you've lay\nout these you know very clear principles\nthat you're just speaking about right\nnow so as you said recruit the best and\nbrightest scientists and Physicians\nfocus on the career Paths of these young\ninvestigators require collaboration in\nplace of competition build cross-sector\nties identify the most promising\nresearch not funded by the NIH uh\neliminate needless bureaucracy and the\nlist continues and\nI I mean you make it sound so easy when\nI'm listening to you right now and when\nyou read it like this but I'm imagining\nthat\neach one of these items took a lot of\neffort time energy\nI mean you you make it sound so seamless\nbut I I would love to know like how how\nchallenging is it to Galvanize at such a\nlarge scale and level so if you were at\na Parkinson's Foundation or a diabetes\nfoundation and\nthousands of talented people try to\nincrease funding\nbut it was like there was a zero-sum\ngame if I increase funding for diabetes\nI had to take it away from someone else\nand so getting them to accept that they\nwere unsuccessful\nand to stand down and have faith\nit's somewhat based on past performance\nin the financial investment they want in\nbusiness they want to know okay what's\nyour past performance do you have a\ntrack record\nso we had a track record of success\nto build on and and we didn't ask them\nto stand down for their lifetime we just\nasked them to stand down for a few\nmonths here so we could focus like a\nlaser our attention on this issue\neliminating cancer is a cause of death\nand bringing in the leading economists\nin the world\nwas worth 50 trillion dollars to the US\neconomy\nin the early 1990s multiples of what the\neconomy and so we could show\nthe results and so yes you have to have\na past direct record\nconvincing a person\nnot to change their career\nI remember one of the world's leading\nchemists\nwas been about to be given a job as the\ndean of the most prestigious University\nin the world but he would leave the\nlaboratory\nso I went and asked him\nwho's Ronnie Warner Brothers at the time\nit was two friends of mine Terry semmel\nand Bob Daly\nhe had no clue who was running\nI asked him has he ever heard of Steven\nSpielberg\nand he says yes he's heard of Steven\nSpielberg I said well\nif you become the dean no one will ever\nhear of you\nbecause Steven Spielberg took years to\nmake movies and product you're working\non breakthroughs here in bioscience\nthat might change the world\nyou becoming a manager of others might\nnever change the world\nand so luckily he decided to stay when\nyou think of young scientists\nthe hundreds or thousands that I've\ndealt with\nyou graduate in high school you were 17\nor 18 years old\nyou're now 31 or 32 or 33 years old\nyou've gone to medical school you got a\nPhD you had fellowships residencies\ninternships\nand now you're ready for your own\nlaboratory and there's no money\nit's very easy to make the decision to\ngo into industry family practice and\ngive up your basic research\nbut if we can greet you at that time and\ngive you your own laboratory and get the\ninstitution to match\nfor a hundred thousand dollars a year\nfor three years\nyou've changed the career\nand whether it's in our melanoma\nresearch Alliance or whether it's in our\nfaster cures group for all\nlife-threatening diseases\nor whether it's in the Prostate Cancer\nFoundation if we have 25 young\nscientists\nand they each are going to work for 40\nyears\nby funding them\nat two and a half million dollars for\nthe first year and each year you've\nbought 1 000 years of their time and\nwhen I look back over the 30 Years to\nall these new therapies that have been\ncreated you will find a young scientist\na young person there\nit's very interesting at the National\nInstitutes of Health\nthe first age that you get an award is\n43.\nif you look at who's won Nobel prizes in\nscience\nmost people have won for an idea they\nhad when they were within a few years of\nschool\nJames Watson was in his 20s\nwhen he put forth this idea\nnow if we have genes Etc\nyou know so many Einstein I think was 23\nand so the idea that you're going to\nschool and you're studying and you've\nnow spent\n15 years after high school\nand now\nwe're going to tell you can wait another\n12 years it's ridiculous and so the\nsystem\nreally was not prepared for the fact\nthat we needed to get the best and\nbrightest and divert their careers\nyounger and so I have spent\nmore than 30 years working on this the\nsame thing we had worked on\n40 years ago with Educators to try to\nget them to stay as an educator\nwhen you go to India today\npeople are so confused today that think\nIndia is like China\nthere were 23 or 24 million children\nborn last year in India\nthere were 9 to 10 million born in China\nmore than twice as many children\ntoday there are more than 200 million\nmore children in India\nthan in China\nChina is more advanced digitally but\nthere's very few countries where the\ncompetition for education\nyou know today is more significant and\nthey also have\na belief in health care\nnot based on modern technology but 5\n000 years of anecdotal experience\nso yes\nare theories that your gut\nhave been proven to be true\nwith modern sequencing Technologies and\nthis year they've just approved giving\nthe microbiome of one person who\nresponded well to treatment to another\nperson that didn't respond well\nadmitting\nthat because they have a different gut\nthey're going to respond well and how\ntheir genes are expressed or how the\ntherapy they're given is can be\nexpressed differently\nbut in India you had 5 000 years of\nexperience of if you did this that\nhappened\nand when I went to the northern Amazon\nNorthwest Amazon\nhere I am dressed head to toe and I\nwrote about it all in black\nin our Indian guide has a pair of shorts\non and that's it he's immune to\neverything\nI'm not immune to anything and he takes\nme over and he says well we use this\nbush\nagainst malaria and we use this for this\nand he shows me this and he says if we\never get separated\nyou can hack this bush and drink the\nwater inside\nbut then he goes and he tells me but\ndon't drink the water in this bush it\ncould kill you so they both look the\nsame to me okay both of them so I got a\nrope and we tied it around his waist and\nmy ways so we would never be separated\nas we are hacking through the jungle and\nso\nI think the world today\nis adjusting to what have we learned\nover thousands of years\nthat we didn't take in consideration\nand the environmental movement the\neffort here in healthy human Healthy\nPlanet\nis totally interrelated absolutely what\nhave you found\nas your\nI guess the things that you're most\nhappy about that prove to you the\nresearch is going in the right direction\nwhat are you pointing towards as\nsuccesses or Solutions well let's just\ntalk about too that the world has full\nknowledge of\nHIV AIDS the number one talk show host\nnot the number one Health Care podcast\nin the world in 1987 Oprah Winfrey goes\non television and tells the people of\nAmerica\nthat one in five are going to die\nfrom AIDS in the next three years that's\nbased on her work\nwell unfortunately many people died\nbut we didn't have 80 million people die\nwe had tens of thousands\nand the cocktails and the antivirals\nthat were created so when one of the\nmost popular people in the United States\nMagic Johnson\nannounced in 1991.\nthat he was diagnosed with HIV and he's\ngoing to have to retire at his peak of\nhis career from the NBA most people\nincluding myself thought he might not\nmake it\ntoday is a friend he's participated in\nour faster cures effort he's bigger than\nlife his smile is bigger than life\nit's 32 years later\nwhere do we see it the most when you say\nwhere are the results look at\nsub-Saharan Africa two-thirds of\neveryone with HIV and AIDS lived in\nsub-Saharan Africa if you wanted to go\nwork there they wanted you to work\n30 years ago they paid you compat pay\nout of fear that you could be infected\nwell today\nthe chance of a woman with proper care\npassing AIDS onto her children is two\npercent\ndown from 95 so the population\nof sub-Saharan Africa is growing\nchildren that were orphans are no longer\nborn\nwith HIV people with HIV and AIDS are\nliving today not dying\nand what did we just see in the last\nthree years during covet\nthe leaders in the state that you and I\nare in today California\ntold Californians\nthat one in two Californians are going\nto get\nthe disease in the next three months\nand that five million of people in\nCalifornia\nwill have to be hospitalized but there's\nonly a few hundred thousand hospital\nbeds\nit was a catastrophe more than a million\npeople died in America\nmore than 10 or 20 million worldwide\nbut it wasn't 50 percent of the\npopulation\nit wasn't 10 of the population\nand it was only 63 days\nbetween the sequencing of the virus and\nthe first human being\ngetting a vaccine 63 days nine weeks not\n10 years\nand so that is why I wrote the book\nokay I wrote the book because we are in\nthe verge\nof a total Revolution the same as I saw\nin finance in health care today with\ntechnology\nand so it's time to put your foot on the\naccelerator and go faster\nnot time to ease up because we think we\nhave put into suspended animation this\npandemic\nand so that was my concerning there were\nthese points of the march in 98. there\nwas this point of the celebration of\nScience in 2012. and there's a point\nhere today\nthat people don't have to die for the\nfirst time in history\nwe have a good chance\nto cure your disease in your own\nlifetime\nif we stay with it my how can me and my\ncommunity support these efforts how can\npeople be involved how can people be\nengaged if they feel inspired by what\nyou're doing and and the work that\nyou're leading on how can they get\ninvolved because I think that's often\nyou know what you're sharing is a\nhealthier future which I think we all\nwant but naturally we often\npeople get discouraged because of\nheadlines and news and everything that\nwe see around us there's things things\naren't true yeah that are in the\nheadlines so just the concept of healthy\nhuman\nHealthy Planet\nsuch a large percent of the Earth today\nis devoted to raising animals\n70 to 80 billion animals for humans to\neach\nand that doesn't count the billions of\nfish we are on the verge\nof essentially being able to create a\nhamburger without a calf without a cow\nnow\nfor a person in India who doesn't eat a\nhamburger doesn't make any difference\nokay but if we can grow it in a\nlaboratory and just give it light and\nenergy and nutrients\nwe don't have to go through the whole\nprocess\nof all the water required all the land\nrequired to grow physical animals so yes\nwe can grow food in the laboratory\nand now it has just been approved\nto allow this to occur we needed to get\nthe cost down it used to be thirty\nthousand an ounce then it went to three\nnow it's a few hundred but it's only a\nmatter of time\nwhere we can have a substantial change\nin the planet\na friend of mine put up the money to do\na book called drawdown and draw down\nlisted the 20 major factors\nthat we're changing our atmosphere and\nthe environment the Earth is in\n10 of them relate to food\n10 of them relate to other things\nand so we have a chance\nand the environmental movement combined\nwith the health movement\nscience today can show you what happens\nso we know today\nthat what were all these vegetables on\nthe planet for if you believe in Darwin\nwhat's the purpose of broccoli\ncauliflower brussels sprouts these\nthings are little Pac-Man they're out\nthere eating\nokay carcinogens in your body\nwe've learned today\nthat your immune system can do amazing\nthings\nand I wrote about it when I first heard\nJim Allison talk in nineteen\n97 that your immune system is smarter\nthan all the scientists in the room\nbut someone turned off your immune\nsystem and that's why you got a\nlife-threatening disease\nokay and that occurred\nand so he developed and won a Nobel\nprize for the concept of checkpoint\nInhibitors and we financed his work for\n10 years in prostate cancer it wasn't\nthat effective but the minute we moved\nto melanoma\nthe death rate has dropped by 50 percent\nand so what he did is we turned off the\nswitch and the cancer that turned off\nyour immune system\nthe idea of growing your own organs\nthere are now\npeople that have had organ transplants\nfrom others take these drugs to prevent\nrejection by their own immune system\nwell at Mass General and Boston other\nthings there looks like there's now a\ntechnology\nthat you can input to a certain degree\nthe immune system of the person that\ndonates your organ to you so you'll have\ntwo immune systems so when you get that\norgan you don't need rejection your\nimmune systems will be operating so\ntechnology is just moving non-invasive\nsurgery\nwhen I watch Star Trek as a kid\nthe doctor bones he didn't do any\ninvasive surgery put a little thing on\nyour body and it did everything well\nthat's what non-invasive Focus\nultrasound can do so the promise\nthe promises with us today\nand so\nwe're just trying to get a mission here\ngoing\nto make sure we stay with our efforts\nthat the world mobilized when you look\nat what happened\nand the months of covet\none I came back and told everyone at\nevery one of our centers that we will\nall be judged by what we did during this\nperiod of time\nI'm not a didn't want to compete with\nyou but we launched\npodcast\n125 of them and the reason I launched\nthem\nwas threefold one if I'm talking to\nFrancis Collins ahead of the NIH I want\nyou or anyone else to hear what he's\nsaying\nanyone in the world could listen I might\nbe able to talk to the CEO of Alex\nGorski at jnj most the people couldn't\nbut you can listen to the conversation\ntwo by talking to them I can encourage\nthem\nmaybe to take action they wouldn't have\ntaken so when they first spoke to Alex\ngorsky in April on this podcast he was\ntalking about maybe going into clinical\ntrials in January of 21 and so my\ncomment was why not July\nwhich he ended up doing and it was\napproved by January\nand so the third effort was to see how\npeople were coping so if I talk to the\nlargest employers in the world who had\nemployees all over the world what were\nthey doing in China Italy Etc\nthat you might be doing in the United\nStates if you were in responsible for\nthousands or tens of thousands or in the\ncase of a Walmart Millions employees\nwhat are you going to be doing and when\nI spoke to the CEO of Target\nhe told me that he was protecting their\nemployees but what happened was when\npeople who lived in small living units\nApartments\ncame into the store with their kids\nthe kids were running all over the store\nand so how are you going to protect the\nkids and how are you going to protect\nyour workers and so this had to be had\nto be done in a short period of time\ntoday I'm no longer doing podcasts I'm\ndeferring to you\nbut for me I meditated\nit made a big difference I think in my\noutcome I went to the leaders in\nImmunology in the world and I discovered\nthe smell of the seashore\nand the smell of certain kind of trees\nSequoia cedar trees seemed to energize\nmy immune system and so when we think of\nthe senses smell taste touch all of\nthese come into play in rejuvenating\nyour body so I used to sit at high tide\nand smell the seashore and I why\ndid that energize my immune system I\nhave no idea except we came out of the\nsea so maybe that was returning to the\nSea and the smell\nof the pine needles and things like that\nmaybe it was relating when I was young\nwith my father so I I don't know but my\nview was we don't use all of our senses\nand we understand one of the things that\nayurveda brought me\nwas understanding of so many different\nelements of touch\nso I I had a chance to see things that I\nnever thought I would see in my life I\nvisited a man in China she Doctor Who\nwas over 90 years old and he told me if\nhe came out of the mountains he would\ndie\nbut when he put his hands on me\nhe could create such unbelievable Heat\nhow did he do that I have no idea okay\nbut it gave you a chance to experiencing\ndifferent things and just like the two\nyoung men from Australia who challenged\nconventional wisdom and the first\nreaction was they didn't even go to a\ngood University why should we be\nlistening to them\nand then\na few years later everybody accepts it\nand so I've found these similarities in\nmy life whether it was in finance\nwhether it was in public health\nwhether it's in medical research\nbut it all comes back to the people on\nyour team\nso when I was in India\nif India's playing Pakistan in cricket\nnothing else is going on okay they could\nbe arguing and fighting about anything\nbut you have to take time out\nfor that game and so there are things\nthat Focus your attention\nand part of this effort is this concept\nof healthy human Healthy Planet yes\ntechnology has solved so many problems\nfor us\nbut I think what I've tried to do\nparticularly in the last 30 years\nI have gone from an extremely unhealthy\ndiet\nokay to an extreme\nfor the first nine years I got my\nayurveda massages twice a week for nine\nyears\nand so I was willing to do things that I\nwould have scoffed at\nin the 1970s 60s 80s is way out there\nokay but today I'm visiting with you\ntoday I'm the happiest guy to do a\npodcast with you 30 years later\nbecause I changed\nthe world changed\nand going forward we're going to have to\nmake more changes more adoption of\nthings it's very hard\nit's very hard in the United States\ntoday we now have this quote diabetes\npill\nthat apparently controls your appetite\nand your weight\nyeah so it's a lot easier than having\npersonal discipline for me\nI ate more hot dogs I believe\nthan anyone except those people that\nwhen the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest\nand how we can eat 50 to 60 hot dogs and\nbuns in that short period of time I have\nno idea\nbut no hot dog\nwas worth your life\nbut not everyone and when I found\nmost people don't want to be lectured on\ntheir diet or what they should eat or\nnot eat\nand when you discover things like a\nNobel Prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn\nabout what sugar does to you\nso what happened when Mexico put a tax\non sugar or chili put a tax on they\nincreased their advertising\nas sales fell off and the same thing\noccurs\nunfortunately the developing world is\nsubject to this advertisement and these\naddicted foods and drugs as they move\naround the world in China\nliterally no one had diabetes 40 years\nago you didn't even study it in school\nand now\npeople in China have the most number of\npeople with diabetes in the world and\nthere's no way of regulating that at a\ngovernment level or uh there's no way\nbecause I feel I agree with you I mean\nyou know I think that we're all now\nbecoming more and more aware of the\namount of sugar in sugary drinks the\namount of you know unhealthy fats and\ncarbohydrates the amount of you know\nwhatever it may be or the amount of\nartificial\neven even in uh speaking of plant-based\nFoods even the current like plant-based\nyou know Foods this they're not all\nhealthy either so is there no way to\nmake sure that at a higher level that we\ndon't even get access to this or is it\njust a disciplined conversation no I\nthink we will be there the idea that you\ncan take a calf a cell from a calf\nnot a calf but a cell if we can find an\nanimal\nthat never was shot with hormones more\nthan 50 percent of all the drugs are\nshot into animals so you might think\nthat you're healthy\nand you're not taking things but what\nyou ate did\nand so but I think will have an entirely\nnew food chain in 20 to 30 years if you\nlook at companies the market has\nadjusted and I wrote about it in the\nbook so at one time\ncraft was selling between 90 and 100\nhours this year\nI don't know where it is today call it\n35 to 40. wow\nNestle\nannounced that they were going to become\na health company\nwhat was the market reaction social\nmedia reaction first they give you\ndiabetes\nthen they're going to deal with it there\nare 360. they create their own problems\nEtc so Nestle went out and hired a CEO\nnot from the consumer packaging but a\nCEO who had worked in healthcare\nand they sold their candy business in\nthe United States\nthey sold other businesses and they\nfocused here on healthy\nbusinesses Etc and Nestle has flourished\nso the market is willing\nto pay more for that and yes\nthe first iterations of plant-based diet\nto make it taste we don't know if\nthey're any better with all the\ningredients they put in\nbut the ability to grow the same as your\nability\ntoday we can take your skin stem cell\nturn it back to the day you were born\nand tell it it's now a heart stem cell\nit's you\nand then give it energy light energy\nnutrients\nand you can see today in a little petri\ndish these cells beating like they're a\nheart\nand so we'll be able to create\npure\nfoods not contaminate the planet\nin the future and so this is what\ntechnologies promises and that\nonce again that's why I wrote the book\nI'm you're busy I'm busy it's not easy\nto write the book you've just finished a\ntour of more than 40 cities in the world\non your new book\nand so it's not easy to take the time\nthe analogy I have made is there was\nthis show in the United States called I\nLove Lucy and Lucille Ball was packaging\nchocolates they're coming down the line\nand they were coming down faster than\nshe could pack them so she's putting\nthem here she's put him in her mouth and\neverything what are you going to do\nso my life and your life there's plenty\nof things we're focused on\nI've probably given\n50 speeches\nin the last month\nbut to set the time down was my concern\nhere that we have a chance\ntechnology has given us a chance\nfor the solution for all these\nlife-threatening diseases we estimate\nthere's ten thousand life-threatening\ndiseases that faster our Center for\nfaster cures has looked at and there's\nsolutions for 500 so there's a lot of\nwork to do\nand we are on the verge with the use of\nTechnology having the ability\nto do this thank you Mike everyone has\nbeen listening and watching the book is\ncalled Foster cures accelerating the\nfuture of Health grab a copy right now\nif you're listening and I hope that this\nis one of those episodes that you'll\nshare with a family member a friend of\nyours that may really want to listen to\nit and I want you to share your insights\non social media whether you're on\nTwitter Instagram Tick Tock share the\nclips share the messages share the\ninsights of wisdom that Mike shared with\nus today with your communities as well\nbecause I think this conversation on\nimproving our own personal health is so\nneeded especially looking at how the\nworld is trying to find new innovative\nways to help us deal with it Mike we end\nevery on purpose episode with a final\nfive these questions have to be answered\nin one word to one sentence maximum for\neach question and so Michael Milken\nthese are your final five the first\nquestion is what is the best advice\nyou've ever received do the research\nthat's great answer never had that\nbefore second question is what is the\nworst advice you've ever heard or\nreceived you'll learn it from the\nnewspaper\nuh question number three what do you do\nfirst thing in the morning and the last\nthing before you go to bed I say hello\nto my wife and good morning\nand I give her a kiss\nbefore we go to bed at night we've known\neach other 65 years we've been married\nfor 55 years and so that's what I do\nfirst thing in the morning and last\nthing that's beautiful question number\nfour about that what would be your\nnumber one lesson from the 65 years\nyou've been together if you had to say\nthere's one thing that has been the most\npowerful lesson you've learned\nin love what would that be see the world\nthrough someone else's eyes great advice\ngreat advice I love that uh Fifth and\nfinal question if you could create one\nlaw in the world that everyone had to\nfollow what would it be treat others as\nyou would like to be treated beautiful\nMike Milken everyone thank you so much\nfor listening to on purpose I hope that\nyou enjoyed this episode I hope you'll\nshare it and I'll hope you'll join us\nfor the next one thank you so much Mike\nthank you so much for being good to see\nyou generous and insightful today it's\nbeen a joy talking to you likewise thank\nyou so much if you love this episode\nyou'll enjoy my interview with Dr Daniel\nAmen on how to change your life by\nchanging your brain if we want a healthy\nmind it actually starts with a healthy\nbrain you know I've had the blessing or\nthe curse to scan over a thousand\nconvicted felons and over a hundred\nmurderers and their brains are very\ndamaged"
