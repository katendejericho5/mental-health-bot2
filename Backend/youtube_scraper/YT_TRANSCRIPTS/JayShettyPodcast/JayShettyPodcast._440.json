I still am not the type of person\nand I never was to take a risk like that\nI struggle with really bad anxiety and I\nas a kid like I did everything that I\nwas told you know I would never I would\nfollow the rules to a T and something\nlike that was absolutely insane and\nlooking back on it now I feel like there\nwas something out of this world that\nkind of took like a toll on me like it\nwas a pretty like I don't even know how\nto explain it but I just knew that I had\nto and I was scared I was terrified I\nremember I had uh there's no non-stop\nfrom Philly to\num La at that time and so I stopped\nsomewhere and on like my connecting\nflight I was freaking out like having a\npanic attack but yeah I just kept going\nbut it was it was something that was\nvery like unlike me and so I feel like I\ndon't know if it's like my higher power\nor anything like that and I just knew\nthat I was uh that was something that I\nhad to do you know how did you have the\nmoney like oh thank God so\nI uh before I was in La I actually this\nis like such a weird story but I started\noff on social media I feel like a lot of\npeople uh know me as a social media\nperson even though that wasn't something\nthat I intended to be I have social\nanxiety so I feel like me being a social\nmedia star isn't something that's you\nknow fits the most with me and something\nthat I would ever want to do but when\nsocial media like Instagram and Tick\nTock uh became popular apps when I was\nyoung I never wanted to go on it and I\nremember being in high school like\nduring lunch and a bunch of my friends\nhad it and they made me make an account\nand post a video and I made one video\nand I happened to accumulate a bunch of\nfollowers off of that without me even\nyou know trying to be an influencer I\nwas just being a random teenage girl\nposting as if any other girl would on\nsocial media and I gained a lot\nfollowers for that and it was really\ncool it was awesome and I had no money\nuh no one in my family had money to just\nbuy a flight whenever they wanted let\nalone live in California or be able to\nget into like a music studio you know\nand so I honestly think I was truly\nblessed with that opportunity because I\nwouldn't still be able to leave and do\nwhat I've always wanted to do and like\nseeing if I couldn't have the money\nfirst and even the audience it allowed\nme to you know go to La and to get in a\nstudio and by the time I even had my\nfirst song out people already knew who I\nwas so that's incredible that's\nincredible what was your going backward\nif you could think of a couple of\nmemories from your childhood that you\nfeel\nmade you really find it to be so tough\nfor your teenage life to be so\nchallenging what would those memories\nfor you that you think spurred this\ndesire to leave and build your own life\nand and create and kind of Follow That\nhigher power as you said what were those\nthings that happened to you specifically\nthat you think were dark and hellish in\nthat sense growing up\nuh it was very hard for me to have\nfriends I struggled a lot in school and\nwith people my age you know I was\nsomeone that was never really fit in uh\nsomeone no one really understood left\nout of a lot of things bullied to an\nextent\num and I feel like that also drove me to\nwant to become better and I believed my\nentire life just being a good person\nthat will pay off\nI feel like luckily it did\num but even you know my home life wasn't\nthe best and seeing my my parents\nstruggle uh with you know financially\nand within themselves and uh with each\nother I feel like that really drove me\nto want to have a better life than what\nanyone in my family had it was really\nhard growing up and I'm at a place now\nwhere I love my parents so much which\ncame you know after a lot of healing\num but I just saw a lot and I just knew\nthat I wanted to be better than what I\nsaw and I wanted to do better and also\ntoo it's like where I'm from I'm from a\nsmall town a nine to five job and going\nto college and that wasn't something\nthat was for me something that I desired\nsomething that I was ever interested in\num I remember junior year I got in\ntrouble because I refused to apply to\nany colleges\nyou know I I knew that I had to do\nsomething different was it you that\nrekindled your relationship with your\nparents or was it them like how did that\ncome about because that's really\nwonderful to hear when that can happen\nit's not possible for everyone but yeah\nhow did that start yeah well I've always\nhad a rocky relationship with my parents\num but my mom she's always my mom and I\nloved her dearly and I always will and\nso we've always had somewhat of a\nrelationship even when I ran away which\nat the time me and my parents we were\nnot okay at all which is why I ran away\num but uh yeah I started doing\nhypnotherapy maybe a little over a year\nago if not a year ago and that has been\nthe one thing that has truly been\nlife-changing\num and changed who I am as a person\nbecause the whole idea of it is that it\nreaches down in your subconscious and\nthat's where all of your trauma is\nstored you know even things that you\ndon't remember and we worked through\neverything that has affected me to this\nday that I couldn't even tell you you\nknow that we were able to bring out\num and because of that I've been able to\ntalk to my dad that I didn't for years\nand haven't since I ran away I recently\njust visited them and went home for the\nfirst time last week for the Fourth of\nJuly I saw my little brother that I\nhaven't even met yet because he was born\na year ago it's been really good I feel\nlike because of how I grew up and\nbecause of my childhood I've been very\nindependent and I've been that type of\nperson that was like I'm going to do\neverything myself and I don't need\nanyone I never needed anyone but you\nknow coming out here by myself at 17\nbeing in this industry and having to do\na lot which does put a toll on you\nmentally and and physically and also\nseeing people that are doing the same\nthing as me around my age having a\nfamily with them at a certain point I\nkind of realized how much family is\nimportant no matter what you know no\nmatter how bad things have gotten in the\npast family still family and I've kind\nof prioritized that recently and I mean\nI wouldn't be able to do it with therapy\nbut it's been really nice to have a\nrelationship that I now have that I\nprobably never had with them my entire\nlife that's beautiful thank you for\nsharing that it's so so wonderful to\nhear that you've been able to reconnect\nin that way what do you think has been\nthe hardest\nthing about coming out here on your own\nfiguring it out like what's been the\nbiggest challenge with Hollywood the\nmusic industry\nthis industry as you mentioned like\nwhat's been the most\ndifficult obstacle that you think you've\nhad to face I think loneliness\nit's so weird how I would assume that\nsome people you know that see me and see\nall that I've accomplished in all of the\npeople that\num listen to my music and follow me they\nwould think that that's something that I\nwouldn't struggle with but it kind of\nmakes me feel lonelier in a way when I\ngo on tour Jose and I perform in front\nof thousands of people and I get off\nstage and I go back into a hotel room by\nmyself\nthere's not a single thing that could\nexplain how\nempty and lonely that feels you know uh\nbeing in front of so many people that\nlove you and that you're connecting with\nthrough music and then just going back\nto have absolutely no one you know no\none to talk to about it yeah it's sad\nand I deal with things daily you know\nall the time and sometimes I don't have\nthe people that I can just you know\ncall like my mom you know I can't just\nhave my mom that comes here and she can\nlike tell me everything's gonna be okay\nand it does get scary and I feel like\nI've always been very mature for my age\nbut since being here I've matured a lot\nhaving to uh deal with certain things in\nthe industry but still at the same time\nI feel like I'm still a kid at heart you\nknow it I just I'm only about to turn 21\nwhich is crazy to think about but I\ndon't know I feel like loneliness is\nsomething that I struggle with\num and it's very hard uh especially in\nLA and Hollywood and in the industry to\nfind the right people that you can\nreally trust and count on I feel like\nI'm even lucky enough to say that I\nfound like probably four you know the\nentire time I've been here but you never\nknow what people's intentions are and\nnot everyone has the same heart as you\nwhich I feel like I struggle with as\nwell yeah it's it's so interesting how\nartists I feel for years have struggled\nwith being on the road alone and they\nshould sure I got a glimpse for my first\ntime because I just went on a world tour\nyeah I'd never done it before I'm\nobviously a lot older than you and I was\ntraveling from February 1st till up\nabout up until about two three weeks ago\nwhen I got home and that was the longest\nI've ever been on the road and I just\nsat there and just thought about all my\nclients or friends that I have who are\nmusicians and people that I work with\nand I was just sitting there thinking\nabout how hard this would be if I\nstarted doing this when I was 15 or 16\nor 17 or 20 and I can totally see why\nit's so challenging but it feels like no\none's really found a way to make it\neasier which is why you still see\nartists after all this time canceling\ntours and announcing that they need a\nbreak and it's\ndo you now see that as\nnatural that it is hard or do you\nsometimes still\nsometimes fall into the Trap of like oh\nit's a weakness or it's something about\nyou are you able to accept that this is\njust hard to do because I think some\npeople kind of go back and forth they\nfeel guilty that they find it that\nchallenging I mean I feel like it has to\nbe hard with all the amazing things that\nI've been blessed with doing what I do\nlike there has to be things that have to\nbe difficult you know and I don't mind\nyou know struggling because it gives me\nsomething to talk about and to write\nabout I mean that's the whole that's\nwhat my whole uh music and everything\nthat I'm about is uh focused on is you\nknow the things that I struggle with and\nI talk about them so that I can help\npeople in a way it's hard but I feel\nlike I'd rather deal with this you know\nand the struggles that come with this\nthen you know having to do something\nthat I don't love and you know be\nunhappy with my life I think that's a\ngreat mindset that's incredible that\nyou've been able to grasp that idea\nso young I think that idea and I just\nwant to repeat it for everyone who's\nlistening because it's really powerful\nyou just said that the life you've\nchosen it comes with stresses and\nchallenges and issues but you'd rather\nchoose that life because it connects you\nto something you love then the other\nlife which sometimes we think like\nthere's a path that has stress and\nthere's a path that won't have any and\nthat's just not true like both of them\nhave it whether you follow your dreams\nor you don't follow your dreams there'll\nbe stress on both parts and it's about\nchoosing which one you'd rather have so\nit's incredible that you've grasped that\nidea I know that you struggled with\nanorexia in the past and then you had a\nrelapse during your tour as well and I\ncan't imagine just how challenging that\nis during a tour to to have that\nexperience again can you walk us through\nyour relationship with it and how you've\nbeen able to try and navigate it and\nstill continue to pour out into your\nmusic and connect with your fans and you\nknow show up today to talk about your\nexperience it's not easy to do that how\nhave you done that\nI talk a lot about mental health because\nthat's been something that I've\nstruggled with since I was six and\nmy entire life I've never really known\nor had a figure that has made me feel\nlike I'm understood and not alone when\nit comes to things like that\num and I feel like fortunately now it's\nnot as taboo as it's always been but I\nfeel like for the past\num almost two years now uh anorexia has\nbeen uh one of my uh biggest mental\nhealth struggles\nand I have made a song about it before\nbut\nI made that song when I um was recovered\nat the time so I wasn't dealing with it\nas hard but an eating disorder is\nsomething that's very personal and very\nhard to even articulate yourself\num because it takes over your mind and\nit's very different for everyone else\nand sometimes I shy away from talking\nabout it because\nI'm either embarrassed or I don't want\nto admit that I'm struggling at the time\nbecause it's very toxic\num disorder or\num it's very hard to talk about it and\nnot be triggering to others which gets\ndifficult\num and I still um\ndeal with it pretty bad to this day I've\nbeen in talks about you know getting\ntreatment and hopefully seeing someone\nand finally getting help because as much\nas I try to take time to focus on Mental\nHealth when you really need intensive\ntreatment for something and you know to\ngo away for three weeks it's not that\neasy\num when you're trying to write an album\nyou know and tour dealing with it on the\nroad though was pretty hard\num when I'm at home in La I live by\nmyself and the only time I don't go out\nyou know I don't really I'm not that\nmuch of a social person so the only time\nI leave my house is when I go to the\nstudio and I make music so being alone I\nfeel like it's\nit's hard to struggle with anorexia but\nit's easier because I'm alone and I\ndon't have to you know deal with anyone\naround me or any triggers um\nand things like that but being on tour\nyou know constantly being around a group\nof people where it is normal for people\nto eat that's a thing that has to be\ndone you know in order to live so to be\naround people that are actually uh that\ndon't struggle with it and are taking\ncare of their bodies and that don't have\nto deal with body image and then me also\nhaving to get on stage in front of\npeople every night where it's like\npeople are there to see me not only like\nthe people that come to my shows but\neveryone else gets to see them because\npeople post videos you know there's\npictures and videos taken at every angle\num and no matter how much I feel safe\nand at home on stage you know performing\nmy songs and being with everyone that\nrelates to them in the back of my head\nwhen I'm struggling with my anorexia all\nI can think about is how insecure I am\nand how I might look and what people\nmight say think and I've had a lot of\npretty dark\num breakdown moments before stage where\nI couldn't even see how I could get on\nbecause I couldn't even figure out what\nto wear you know that would make me feel\ncomfortable and when you're on the road\nfor how many weeks or months you don't\nhave a huge option to you know to wear\nwhatever you want like your stage\noutfits or your stage outfits the\nbiggest struggle I think is just the\nphysicality part of it\num scientifically to be able to get on\nstage and have the energy to perform uh\nfor you know over an hour every night\nyou have to have energy and energy comes\nwith eating and food and that was\nsomething that I struggled with because\nuh\ntouring and you know my music and all\nthis is so important to me\nand it's really hard\nto not let my eating disorder get in the\nway of that and so I would have to no\nmatter how hard it was but try and sit\nas however long it takes me and force\nmyself to eat that way I could you know\nget up on stage the next night without\nbeing too tired or God forbid passing\nout and you know not having the energy\nthat they came for you know because\nthat's what it's important and mentally\ntoo it's like when I'm at a really low\npoint and struggling and not eating for\na while I'm not my best self you know\nI'm not giving off that energy that\nmakes people feel good around me and I\nthink that's kind of the saddest part\nabout it you know I want to be my best\nself always and so it's hard trying to\nfind a balance you know and figuring out\nways to help you but also not make\nthings harder because the recovery\nprocess with anorexia is probably the\nhardest thing that I've ever dealt with\nmy entire life like I've been through\nintensive trauma therapy with Hypno for\nmy BPD but you know just trying to\nfigure out how to have a comfortable\nrelationship with food itself is\nsomething that\nhas been one of the hardest and scariest\nthings that I've ever done my entire 20\nyears of living which is hard to also do\nthat you know during this time of my\nlife\nyeah thank you for being so vulnerable\nand open I really appreciate it because\nyou know that's\nwhat I'm trying to create here is a safe\nspace where people can actually be seen\nand heard yourself and then everyone\nwho's listening who's either struggling\nwith something similar or may love\nsomeone who's going through something\nlike this I can definitely testify that\ngetting on stage without a eating\ndisorder is hard enough yeah in and of\nitself and so having that extra layer of\nworrying and being concerned and even\nthe energy as you were saying about even\nhaving the energy to perform I remember\njust before I was going on stage like\nbeing present I remember how much\npresence I needed I also sleep really\nearly so to go on the stage at 8pm I'm\nlike it's coming over my bed time in two\nhours like how am I gonna stay up\nwithout pumping my body with sugar or\nanything else I want to stab naturally\nyeah and that's without any of the stuff\nyou're having to think about so\nI'm just empathizing and listening into\nwhat that challenge looks like what\nwould you like people to know about\nanorexia so that they're aware because I\nfeel that a lot of the times these terms\nget normalized and we hear them\neverywhere but then we kind of become\ndesensitized to it and people aren't\nnecessarily aware of how to deal with\ntheir friend who's going through it or\nsometimes someone's kids going through\nit from your experience not as like it's\nthe same experience for everyone because\nwe know it's not from your experience\nwhat do you think it's good for people\nto know if someone they love or someone\nthey know is going through something\nlike this or they think they might be\nwhat would be useful for them I think\nthe first and biggest thing is that not\nonly with just anorexia but with all\neating disorders it looks different on\neveryone there's not a look to it\num and I feel like it's so damaging when\nthere's a common idea or image you know\nof how someone that is anorexic should\nlook or how someone that struggles with\nan eating disorder should look\nand they kind of you know take that as\nto how sick they are which uh that\ndoesn't matter at all\num and I also feel like it's something\nthat you know but just it's impossible\nto understand\nuh something like anorexia if you have\nnot gone through it before because I\nmean two\neven with me just saying what I struggle\nwith out loud and the whole idea of it\nme being\num obsessive and scared over food and\nobsessive with calories and terrified of\nweight gain and a control thing and all\nthe things that I allow myself to\nbelieve which they're all lies and how\nmy brain processes things and all that\nstuff I know that it's not real and I\nknow that it's all lies you know and I\nknow it's absolutely delusional\num but that's still that's the disorder\nthat's what happens\num and so when you don't struggle with\nthat you don't understand that you know\nso I I have a lot of people that you\nknow have told me before you know just\neat you know or like people\num will say things that they think will\nhelp but that's not\nthat's not the issue\num you know I think most importantly is\njust to you know with any mental health\ndisorder or anything like that just the\nbest thing to do for someone is to just\ngive them love and support\nsometimes it's best not to\ntry too hard to give advice or to say\nthings that you think are going to help\nbecause there are some things that you\nknow might seem helpful and that you\nmight have good intentions by saying\num but it might trigger someone you know\nit's dealing with it for example I know\nfor me and I feel like it might be a\ncommon thing for a lot of people that\nstruggle with anorexia the word healthy\nto everyone is a great word you know\nit's a positive word everyone wants to\nbe healthy but for me when someone says\nthat I look healthy it makes me want to\nspiral you know it makes me go crazy\nbecause that's not a word\nthat you know healthy to me I associate\nwith something that you know\nis not the best because unfortunately in\nmy brain uh being called sick is\nsomething that in a terrible and ugly\nway is something that comforts me more\nthan the word healthy which little\nthings like that I feel like is\nimportant for people to know that want\nto be there for someone that don't you\nknow understand it's like just have to\nbe wise and not walk on eggshells but\njust be more sympathetic and\nunderstanding of what they could\npossibly be going through even though\nyou don't understand it's yeah something\nto this day that I still don't\nunderstand or get or\num\nI kind of struggle with even coming to\nterms with the fact that I deal with it\nbecause I am now at the point where I'm\naware of how unhealthy it is but I still\ncan't process you know that it really\nisn't\num real because I still have that eating\ndisorder mind you know\num but yeah I think just being\nsupportive and loving and dealing with\nit with grace and patience\num I feel like that's a big thing uh\neveryone wants who they love to be\nbetter and the best that they can be and\nhealthy and to get help when they need\nit\num but I think sometimes people forget\nthe fact that getting help and Recovery\nis something that's very linear and not\nlinear\num it's a long process you know and it\ntakes time and something like this I\nmean I've been rushed into recovery\nbefore which led me into a pretty\nterrible relapse you know it takes time\nso you just have to be patient with\npeople that are struggling and just give\nthem as much love as you can I feel like\nlove goes a long way yeah well I think\nfor what it's worth your\nawareness and how\neloquent you are in explaining at least\nwhat you're experiencing is really\nadmirable thank you honestly like just\nhearing you talk about it and reflect on\nit your awareness is is so high which is\nan incredible step in your journey and I\nthink the advice you gave or the Insight\nyou gave is really useful because\nI think when we love someone we think we\nhave to solve their problems and we\nthink we have to say the perfect thing\nand we think we can fix it\nand you're so right that actually what\nwe need to do is be patient and\nsupportive and loving and kind and just\nbe there yeah and we don't have to say\nthe perfect thing and we don't have to\nhave the perfect advice because we don't\nknow what it feels like yeah and I think\nthat that's really useful for people to\nhear because we think we're useless if\nwe can't fix someone's problems we want\nto love them and that and that person\ndoesn't think you're useless that person\nactually prefers if they just know\nyou're there 100 and you don't have to\nhave the solution\none thing I loved when our teams first\nstarted talking about us sitting down\nwas your eight stages of a breakup your\nnew music and I wrote a book called\nEight rules of love\nand so when that came up I was like how\nI wrote a book about love this year\nwhich is why I was on tour and you wrote\nyou've written music you know with the\nand I know on Tick Tock I've been\nwatching your videos of each stage in\neach part\nand I find that you know you've you've\nhad two public breakups it's never easy\ncould you walk us through what you find\nis different between a public breakup\nand a private breakup because I almost\nfeel like we don't really grasp that\nagain until you've lived it oh and I'm\nguessing you had breakups previously\nthat were not public potentially what\nare the differences like what do you\nnotice breakups in general just\nabsolutely the worst yeah hard\num\neven though I feel like they're they are\nvery critical experiences that you have\nto go through in life in order to grow\nit they suck but\na public breakup man I\nit just the fact that it's not you know\njust your close relatives and friends\nthat know about you in a relationship\nit's probably millions of people that\nhave kept up to date with you know your\nrelationship and I've been so invested\nand very like fixated on it and\neven when it comes to\nthe media today anything that happens\neven when it's not a breakup drama is\nentertainment you know people love to\ntalk people love to speculate\num and so dealing with public breakups I\nfeel like all the drama that has to come\nwith it which I feel like is very\nunnecessary and causes a lot more\num pain and hurt to the people that are\nactually going through it you know that\ndoesn't help\num but it's like\nwhen I'm dealing with the grief of a\nrelationship and losing someone that I\nlove so dearly\nand then\nalso on top of that having to do with\nhundreds of thousands of people talking\nabout it as well\nsaying things that aren't true you know\nsaying things that are hurtful\num putting their two cents in it\nbeing very\ninsensitive towards the whole thing you\nknow not really understanding because\npeople don't understand that you know\npeople in the public eye could possibly\nbe you know actually human with actual\nlives and like emotions when they see\nwhatever you know I let them on to see\nbecause I you know am like a public\nfigure\num I feel like they kind of take that as\noh this is that's her life you know\nthat's all that they are but behind\nclosed swords it's like I'm I do with it\nyou know the depth of life as just as\nanyone else would\num and so a relationship and a breakup\nfor me is just as real as love is for\nanyone else and I feel like people\nforget that so I feel like that's hard\nwith having to deal with everyone's\nopinions and comments and all the stuff\nthat comes with that but as well as\nnon-stop constantly seeing you know\npictures or videos and videos like you\nknow just anything about me and my past\nrelationship and like all of that stuff\nI feel like when you know growing up in\nhigh school when I first had my\nboyfriend and and everyone started\ngetting in like relationships like it\nwas like a rule like when you break up\nwith someone like you delete their\nnumber like you unfall them on Instagram\nlike you don't look at them you don't\ntalk to them like you don't hang out\nwith them like it's like a out of sight\nout of mind type thing you know it helps\nyou get you need that period where it's\nlike they're gone you know and you can\nget over them easier well like it's\nimpossible for me it's everywhere and so\nI feel like that's hard you know that\nconstantly being brought up I mean how\ncould you expect anyone to properly move\non and get over a relationship that was\nso deep and intense when it's constantly\ntalked about constantly brought up in my\nlife\num it's hard not to mention I have a\nsong with one of my exes which is uh you\nknow it's just it's kind of\nit's so different it's it's so different\nand\num yeah I feel like a you know regular\nbreakup through having to deal with uh a\nbreakup with the public is always going\nto be uh hard and\nyou know they're both hard but I feel\nlike\nhaving the media evolved is 100 a lot\nmore difficult yeah how did you come up\nwith the eight stages of a breakup oh my\nGod this is so funny\num but I was listening to\num\nso a lot of the times I'm very\nintentional and I I\nI'm very thought out when it comes to\nevery little thing that I do especially\nwith music\num but this this whole eight stages of a\nheartbreak\num breakup thing actually came after it\nwas done\num I was listening from top to bottom\nthrough my entire EP after it was mixed\nand mastered and I was kind of like you\nknow what this is kind of like going\nthrough like all eight stages of a\nbreakup because I was like instead of\nthe seven stages of grief like this is\nlike eight stages because there's eight\nsongs of a breakup and like the grief of\na relationship and I was with my team\nthey're like whoa It's kind of it's kind\nof cool and I was like yeah and so it\nall makes sense sometimes\num I plan things out before sometimes\nthings just magically fall into place\nand make sense after\num but yeah I love it I I love it I\nthink I think when we start recognizing\ntheir stages and phases to anything oh\nyeah it helps us so much as humans where\nwe realize it's not just all one big\nthing there's actually changes in how we\nfeel what's the what have you found to\nbe the hardest stage in a breakup for\nyou personally or like what's what's the\nstage that you find the most challenging\nI feel like they're all really hard but\nI feel like the the one I think that I I\ncalled this one the desperate stage\num and I just made a video about it\nbecause I have this song called Motel\nhorror and I was like this one\nrepresents the desperate stage of a\nbreakup and it's kind of like that\nbargaining stage where you just try and\ndo whatever you can to get that person\nback in your life no matter what costs\nand like however you can so yeah it's\nwhen like you break up with them and\nthen\nyou're at the point where it's like you\njust want them in your life that you're\nwilling to do whatever it is to keep\nthem in your life somehow even though it\nhurts you because you know the way that\nyou want them in your life is the way\nthat you had them before in that\nrelationship but now it's like it's not\nthat and so you kind of end up hurting\nyourself more because you're you know\nputting yourself back in that place but\nalso knowing that like you're gonna end\nup leaving heartbroken again because\nit's a lot harder when you know you try\nand be with that person whether it's\nlike friends or just like hooking up or\nany of that stuff when there's like\nactual real love and connection on your\npart still but it's like and you try to\nconvince yourself like oh like this is\ngonna get them back like our\nrelationship is going to be like you\nknow how it was before but it doesn't\nhappen and then it crushes you even more\num I feel like that's the hardest stage\nwhen you just become very desperate for\nany ounce of attention that you can get\nfrom that person\num because it ends up breaking your\nheart even more you know you didn't you\ncould skip that stage and you know fully\nlike lead on the path of healing the way\nthat you should but I feel like that's\nlike the one stage where we kind of like\ntrip up the stairs and we're like oh God\nyeah we made it harder for ourselves\nyeah that's well said I I can agree more\nthat that really resonates because I\nthink we're living in that dream of like\nwhat it could have been and what it\nshould be and like\nthey must love me and it's I'm gonna get\nit back and I'm gonna win them over and\nI mean we waste so much time in that\nwhat do you think is like the longest\nstage what stage do you think and you\nspend the most time in when you break up\nwith someone where you're just like so\nmuch energy gets sucked out in being\nlost at a stage trying to recover from\nthe codependency part\num because I mean when you're in a\nrelationship\nI know I get so codependent on someone\nyou know that's the person that you have\nalways you know you there's something\nthat you go through like you have that\none person that you can talk to cry to\nthey're always there for you\num they become your comfort you know\nthat's your safe place and then when the\nrelationship's over it's like you don't\nhave that you're left on your own I feel\nlike that was the longest stage for me\nto get over because I was so used to\nbeing so codependent on someone and\nyou know having that Comfort when it's\nall gone every time that I dealt with\nsomething that was hard for me every\ntime that I got upset every time I felt\nalone I couldn't help but want and like\ncrave that person because I was used to\nhaving them during those times and\ntrying to escape from the codependency\nand learning how to love yourself and\nenjoy your own company and uh even just\nlike coming to terms with the fact that\nlike you can be that person for yourself\nyou know and that you don't need anyone\num I feel like that's the longest\nprocess 100 you're so right what what\nhelped you personally in both those\nstages\nso let's go back to the first stage that\nstage of like I'm desperate I'll do\nanything to get them back like you know\nyou said that was the hardest stage like\nwhat helped you in your life break\nthrough that stage because you're so\nright it is the hardest because it's the\none where we have the most hope but it's\nfalse hope and it's the one where we\nalso are living the most in Dreamland in\nour minds so it's so hard when that\npicture crumbles yeah what have you done\nwhat's really worked for you I think\ntherapy was a big thing for me and uh uh\nthere was a moment we're doing that time\nwhere I fully took the step two almost\nfully isolate myself where I was only\nfocused on myself and my healing and my\nmusic and things that made me happy and\nI spent that time really trying to\nfigure out you know who I am as a person\nand the things that I love and the\nthings that help me and so it kind of\nlike you know that like point of\nrelationship where like you start to\nlike understand and like know that like\nperson that you're with you know and you\nget closer with them it's like that very\nbeginning it was kind of like I started\nto go through that with myself and so it\nkind of took me away from\nhaving to you know really struggle with\nthe\num the breakup I feel like you just\ngotta fake it until you make it and just\nforce yourself and there's always going\nto be days I mean like I thought there\nwas like a day where I was like fine and\nthen two seconds later I see something\nand I'm bawling my eyes out you know and\neven like randomly like you know months\nlater I'm fully moved on but I'll still\nget sad over things because like love is\nsuch a strong feeling that never goes\naway no matter like what happens or how\nthings ended and you know any of that\nlike if you ever had true love for that\nperson you're always going to love them\nit was always hard but I think the\nsecond that I really started to\nprioritize myself and to really just\nlike focus on myself and uh fixate on\nthat rather than how much I miss that\nperson\num it helped yeah that's yeah that's\nreally\nI have I hope that's going to help\npeople I hope it sits with Builders\nyou're right it's just almost like you\ngot to push through sometimes it's not\ngoing to be easy it's not going to make\nsense but\nwhen you're in that longest phase and\nit's just getting drawn out how do you\neven keep hope and how do you even keep\nfaith that I can have love again and\nthat I do deserve to be loved because I\nthink in that longest phase is where a\nlot of people get so broken down that\nthey're like I'm not lovable yeah I'm\nnot likable I'm not worthy I'm not\nattractive I'm not smart whatever it may\nbe that that person made me feel now\nit's like I can't be all of those things\nbecause it's that stage is drawn out so\nmuch that it beats up your self-esteem\nyeah that makes sense uh no that was\nsomething that I struggled with for the\nlongest time and I think that the more\nthat you keep yourself in that Minds\nlike mindset the hardest that it's going\nto be to get out of that because yeah of\ncourse I mean like when you start kind\nof like tearing yourself down and\nthinking about you know how difficult it\nis to fall in love again that you you\nwon't because no one's ever gonna love\nyou and all that stuff and you're you're\nworthless and\neverything that comes with that it's\ngonna keep you away from doing the\nproper healing and to actually want to\nheal because if you have that mindset\nthen it's like what's the point of\nhealing you know and getting better I\nrealized I got to a point where\nI was like yeah I'm never going to fall\nin love again or no one's ever going to\nlove me and then I got to the point\nwhere\nI was like you know what I don't care I\ndon't care to ever have a relationship\nlike I'm fine because every relationship\nI mean\nthere's probably gonna be a few trial\nand error ones until you find the person\nthat you like really end up being with\nyou know and so it's no guarantee that\nthe next one that I get like in a\nrelationship with is going to be the one\nwhich would you know most likely end up\nin a heartbreak that in that moment I'm\nlike I cannot afford to go through again\nso I don't even care to you know be in a\nrelationship or find love again\num but then in therapy I realized that\nit's that's not going to change unless\nyou love yourself\nI Feel Like Loving yourself is like the\nbiggest thing and like the most\nimportant thing and I feel like everyone\nkind of neglects that because it's like\nit seems like something that's just not\nnot like unnecessary but we Overlook it\nbecause like we are you know who we are\nand we give love to everyone around us\nbecause like that's life you know but I\nfeel like a lot of the times we forget\nto look internally and the only way that\nyou can give things to people is if you\nalready have it within you and when I\nrealize that even if like I want to be\nin a relationship and I want someone I\nwant to be in love I'm probably not\ncapable to love someone as best as I can\nbecause I can't even love myself and I\ndon't right now\num and so yeah I feel like as soon as\nyou just work on that self-love that's\nwhen things start being easier because\nthen you also get out of that mindset\nwhere you're like you don't really need\nanyone you know\num and you couldn't be okay with you\nknow not having to look you know and\nconstantly like think about\num wanting a relationship or like\nfinding that person to be with and you\ncan just like spend you know nights\nalone without having to cry about it or\nwish that there was someone with you\num but yeah self-love I feel like is the\nthe key how do you find things or have\nyou found things that you love about\nyourself because I think we live in a\nsociety that makes us love ourselves\nbecause other people love us so it's\nlike if someone thinks you're attractive\nthen you think oh yeah I'm a trash this\nis like this is good or if someone\nthinks you're really smart then you're\nlike oh yeah they think I'm smart so now\nI'm smart like so much of our self value\nweirdly is placed on other people\nvaluing us how have you found things to\nreally love about yourself because I I\nagree with you fully but how do you go\nthat step further to be like I've really\nloved this about myself even if no one\nelse sees it I could never understand\nthe things that I could possibly love\nabout myself until the moment that I\nthought about my younger self because\nthat's still me you know the second that\nI started you know looking back on the\nperson that I used to be and you know\neven just like six-year-old me\num\nI started to think about all the things\nthat she would be so happy and proud of\nthat I've done you know today that's\nwhen I started to you know find things\nthat I actually could feel you know love\nfor myself with and to feel proud of\nmyself uh for and all of those things\nand then I don't know and then sometimes\nyou just kind of have to dig a little\nbit deeper because I feel like self-love\nis a lot less superficial than\num you know any other love could\npossibly be\num and it has to be really deep because\nit's like\nyou know who you are as a person to the\ndeepest core more than anyone else could\nmore than you can know other people in\norder to love them so I feel like that's\nwhy it's tricky for us to love you like\nourselves\nbecause we know that ins and outs of us\nand the worst parts of us and the\nugliest parts and so and we're worse\ncritics so I feel like that's the\nhardest thing but yeah when I when I\nthought about it and I'm like okay well\nI've been able to do the things that I\ndid which I never thought I was able to\nlike that's something that I should be\nproud of\num the things that I've gone through\num that I never thought that I could\nmake it out of and my strength like\nthat's something that I should love\nmyself for\num and just have compassion for myself\nfor\num even just the fact that like at the\nend of the day no matter all the things\nthat I've been through and no matter\nlike how bad people have treated me like\nthe fact that I'm still a good person\nand I still have a good heart and I know\nthat you know more than anyone else\ncould that's the reason why I should\nlove myself you know\num so I feel like it's just like little\nthings and I feel like it's just very\nimportant to just like\nsit down and really just like analyze\nyourself and to you know just take time\nto like understand\num you which I feel like is something\nthat I I just learned how to do but it's\nlike it's really nice everyone is\nlistening I want you to take a\nscreenshot right now and I want you to\nlisten to that part that Nessa just said\nagain and again and again I can even put\nyou to sleep like it's so brilliant\nbecause everything you just said that\nliterally the last 30 seconds I promise\nif you just listen to the last 30\nseconds again and again and again the\npoint will become so clear because\nwhat you just said sums up an idea that\nI I really believe in I believe that\nself-care comes from Comfort but\nself-respect comes from discomfort and\nyou just said that when you look back at\nall the things you've been through and\nall the things you survived and all the\nthings you've done that's what makes you\nlove yourself and I believe that\neveryone who's listening or watching\ntoday they've all been through hard\nthings 100 everyone everyone's been\nthrough some sort of difficulty in their\nlife they're still alive they're still\nbreathing they're still held on to their\ngood heart they're still a good person\nand that's what you really want to love\nyourself for and when you learn to love\nyourself for that you realize no one\never gave you that and no one can take\nit away exactly and it's yours whereas\nall the other things they'll come and go\nand people will change their mind but\nthis is something that's forever yours\nand so you just summed it up really\nbeautifully and I I love the way you\nsaid it I hope people will honestly I\nmean that just repeat it again and again\nbecause it's just rewiring thoughts yeah\nto be like that's why I'm valuable I'm\nnot valuable because of all these other\nthings that that people are saying one\nthing you do that I love you do a burn\nbox on stage where you get fans to write\nmessages and then you burn them that is\nso cool I love that that's the dopest\nthing I've ever heard of I was like you\nneed to do that mindset where did that\nritual come from walk me through did you\nused to do that yourself was that\nsomething you invented for the community\nlike what tell me where that came from\nbecause I love that when I I thought I\nwas like this is amazing thank you\num well the thing about my music is that\nit's very\nit's very deep and meaningful and I talk\na lot about mental health and I know\nthat a lot of the people that come to my\nshows are there because they have\nstruggled and they relate deeply to my\nsongs you know it's not just\num I never want my shows and my tour to\njust be a show where it's you know just\nme playing you know their favorite songs\nlike I want this to be like\nnot like a therapy session but like a\nhealing you know moment for everyone\nlike a bonding moment something that's\nreally real something that they can walk\naway from and not only just remember the\nmusic but the feeling\num that they've gotten from it and I\nalso wanted to do something that was\ninteractive and helpful in healing the\nsame way and I thought that doing a burn\nbox could be cool and it was also kind\nof the easiest thing that we could you\nknow execute for my show like at the\ntime but\num I mean like what better\nlike interactive thing to do like on\nstage than to have you know a bunch of\nmy fans that are coming to the show and\nwrite on a little piece of paper things\nthat they're struggling with they want\nto let go of get off their chest\nand just like let you know just not\nbottle up anymore and just like get off\ntheir chest write it down anonymously\nput it in this burn box and then watch\nit being burned on stage you know I feel\nlike that there's something so\npowerful about that and\num I'm so glad that we did it because it\nwas it was you know most of their like\nfavorite parts of the entire show and\nit's helped a lot of people and\num I even like I've seen like people in\nthe crowd that cry before while I'm\nburning it and it's just like that's\nwhat like makes that's what makes my day\nand that's what motivates me to you know\neven do the show and to like do what I'm\ndoing now because like that's the reason\nwhy I'm doing it and it's so pure\num and heartwarming just to see like how\nsomething like that you know that I\nthought could be like a little fun like\ncould actually like affect them like on\na deep level\num but yeah yeah well I mean it seems\nlike all your music and all the work\nyou're doing is so healing focused seems\nlike you're doing so much self-healing\nit seems like the work you want your\ncommunity to do is healing I think it's\nI mean I think it's a genius idea to do\non stage it's I think it's such a\nbeautiful thing to have rituals that\ncommunities your audience can come and\ndo together and I can only imagine the\nincredible experience people are having\nyou said that was the easiest thing you\ncould do at this stage what's like the\ncraziest thing you want to do that you\nthink would be super healing for\neveryone do you have like a vision for\nit\num you don't have to I just wondering if\nthere's something else like I've had\nlike some like pretty\ncrazy ideas\num let me try and think I just want to\ndo like a lot like I I know that there's\nlike certain songs that like I've I love\nto just like be able to like get certain\npeople\nfrom the crowd that really resonate or\nstruggling with something that has to do\nwith that song and like bring them up\nand you know have a moment with them\num I would also love like a point where\nI you know ever have like a big enough\nshow where I can like actually have you\nknow some my fans you know tell their\nstories because I think it's just as\nimportant for uh me to have a voice as\nit is for them you know because I've\nsaid this before it's like I kind of\nused my music to be the voice for the\nvoiceless and so when I get to a point\nwhere I can\num do whatever the heck I want on stage\nlike I want to give them their voice you\nknow I want them to have the mic and I\nwant them to say whatever they feel they\nneed to but yeah I don't know I feel\nlike there's so many like cool things to\ndo but the burn box is just like so\nawesome and it also is like very\ndisappointing for the sun venues that I\ncouldn't do it in because it was a\nsafety hazard but yeah and I also live\nfar I think fire is fun too so no I love\nthe interactive element even in my show\nwe did a ton of interactive stuff I set\npeople up on Fast dates on stage\nI had uh what else do we do I locked\npeople into caves for 15 minutes so they\nhad to spend time alone without their\nphone oh my God uh we were doing this\nall on stage and I love that interactive\nelement because I agree with you\ncompletely that people need to feel and\nexperience this it's not just like some\nidea and you're right that people really\ndo have a Letting Go releasing energy in\nthe room when everyone's doing it\ntogether so I'm excited to see what you\ndo next like that's that's that's\nbrilliant I think combining music and\nthat sort of a healing experience is\nsuper unique and really powerful so I\nI'm excited for you to have bigger\naudiences bigger venues and all of that\nto come to you all of that to happen one\none thing that comes to mind for me when\nwe're talking about all of this with you\nis just you've done so much at such a\nyoung age it seems like you're\nnavigating it and and doing it in the\nbest way you possibly can with getting\nthe help and reconnect with your family\ndoing therapy I mean I'm so happy that\nyou've been supported this young and\nyou've found that support because I\neither meet people who've been around in\nthe industry for decades and they've\njust found support or I meet people\nwho are young and kind of really gone\noff on a different path and there's very\nfew people\nyour age who I think have found that and\nthat's really incredible to see what do\nyou think that young artists need in\norder to be supported in\nin their journey of being a musician an\nactor an actress or whatever it may be\nwhat do you think would be really useful\nfor them for people who are aspiring\nbecause I think everyone would want\neveryone from the outside would look at\nyour life and be like I want that I want\nto be that what do you think they should\nbe aware of in their journey in Pursuit\nthat could help them I think that the\nbiggest\nadvice and the biggest thing that has\nhelped me and that I could tell anyone\nis to be very vocal and honest and open\nand vulnerable you know to the closest\npeople around you to your team to the\npeople that you trust because I think\nthat's how I was able to create such a\nstable support system around me from the\nbeginning\num because you know everyone knows this\ntype of music that I talk about and\neveryone knows that I actually struggle\nwith it as well and so I feel like\nthat's why\num it's me being so open and honest\nabout you know the things that I\nstruggle with and my needs and the\nthings that I need help with I think\nthat's uh helped me be able to continue\nthis because there's other people that\nare aware and in support of that as well\nand I think like even if people don't\nreally struggle with anyone just being\nhonest in yourself and never losing\nsight of that I feel like I've even had\nmoments where I've almost lost myself in\nthis because it's so easy to get\ninfluenced and to try and figure out you\nknow what\nwho's the person that people want you to\nbe and who what's the type of music or\nyou know anything like that that people\nwant from you\num but that's not gonna do anything but\nhurt you and your career and\num I was just I had like a conversation\nlike not too long ago where\nit's like yeah like my dream and my goal\nis to be like one of the biggest artists\never of course that's like what I'm\ndoing this for but I'm not never in my\nentire life going to sit down and\nrelease a song that I know is a hit or\nto go and write a song that I know is a\nhit that doesn't feel like me as an\nartist and isn't something that I relate\nto just so that you know it'll you know\ngive me a step up in the career and\nmaybe like\nyou know create this like Skyrocket\nprocess for me because it is a hit you\nknow and it's something that would be\ngood in the industry I'd rather\nbuild whatever I can by being myself\nbecause that's more\nit's more like I'd feel more proud doing\nthat and accomplishing things just being\nmyself and you know saying the things\nthat I want to say and being real I feel\nlike that means the world to me more\nthan just you know being an artist and\nreleasing hits and being a person that\nyou know it's I feel like it's just the\neasy way out a little bit but um I feel\nlike because of how I started this and\nhow I continue uh to do all of this is\nwhat's gonna make me be able to do it\nfor the rest of my life because I'm not\ngoing to get like trapped in this like\nfacade or this uh crazy headspace it's\nlike that everyone knows me who I am and\nuh this music uh helps me and probably\njust as much as it helps everyone out\nthere and so I feel very fortunate for\nthat so yeah anyone that is inspiring to\ndo this or needs any the advice I would\njust say to be themselves that's that's\nincredible yeah I I you are you're\ndefinitely wise beyond your years and\nyeah uh you know I wish you all the best\nfrom the bottom of my heart like you\nknow for everything you just said I I\nthink we need more art in the world that\nis made from a place of healing in order\nto help people it can still be fun and\nexciting and interactive and\nentertaining and all of that but it's\nmade from that deeper place which I feel\nlike you're definitely trying to channel\nwe end every episode sort of on purpose\nfor the final five yeah these are the\nFast Five the questions have to be\nanswered in one word to one sentence\nmaximum however when I get intrigued I\nalways go off record which is fine we'll\nwe'll do that so NASA these are your\nfinal five the first question is what is\nthe best advice you've ever heard or\nreceived\nlet go and let God I feel like that's\n100 the best advice ever beautiful all\nright question two what's the worst\nadvice you've ever heard or received\ntext him\nall right go on tell me more tell me\nmore\nyou know if you're just like in your\nhead about like an an ex or anything\nlike that\nand someone tells you you know what just\ntext him do not listen do not you know I\nfeel like there's a lot of advice that\nkind of just enables your bad habits\ntry to stay away from that got it great\ngreat advice so I'm going to ask you I'm\ngonna go slightly off peace here because\nI think you might have some good advice\nfor people let's say I have a\nhypothetical friend and it's a real\nfriend but let's have a friend who\nis around your age yeah and she\ndeals with people pleasing she becomes\nfriends with guys who actually want to\nget with her but then\nshe doesn't like them in that way but\nthen she feels bad to tell them that\nwhat should she do in that scenario\nwhy are you laughing there's something\ngoing on I was like this reminds me so\nmuch of myself all right oh that's so\nfunny great\nbut what advice would you give to my\nfriend\nit's a real story so like I'm like\nactually asking when she listens to this\nshe's gonna be like Jay how did you put\nme out like I think boundaries is like\nthe biggest advice and I feel like when\nyou are people pleaser and you're a very\nnice person like at the core and\num you only see like the good in people\nand you can't really like it's easy to\nlike it's\nit's easy to ignore any red flags I feel\nlike\num\nit just try and set as many boundaries\nas yourself and just like protect\nyourself and\njust be cautious I feel like just being\ncautious is the biggest thing because\nthere are sticky situations that you can\nget into just because you're a genuinely\na nice person\num and everyone has different intentions\nthan you\num so I think\nslow being slow and steady and cautious\nokay and yeah\nsometimes it's hard for me to give\nadvice when like I was like I don't even\nknow\nthat's why I'm watching that's what I'm\nasking I want to know what you would do\nuh question number three what keeps you\nup at night\nanything\nI could think about you know certain\nsituations are happening in my personal\nlife or uh you know I've I get paranoid\nand have like anxiety about like with my\nfamily because they're so far from me\nnow\num or I just start thinking about deep\nthings like God and the universe and\naliens and weird stuff like that and if\nI'm even human\num but yeah I think anything keeps me up\nat night in a weird way\num the even sometimes like songwriting I\nfeel like I've stayed up for hours\nbefore trying to write a song absolutely\ngoes nowhere but yeah I love it uh\nquestion number four if someone needs to\nbreak up with someone what is your best\nadvice to the person doing the breaking\nup sit them down and have a really\nconversation about it and be as vocal\nand\nAnand still have compassion and not try\nto let things get fired up or also stand\nyour ground because if you already want\nto break up with them don't let them\nconvince you otherwise and do so without\ncheating or being disloyal because it is\nnot nice\num I had this song that I wrote recently\nthat was uh it's called leaving better\nthan you found me and so it's kind of\nlike that's like my whole um thing like\nabout breakups it's like if you're gonna\nbreak up with someone like don't do all\nof the\nthe yelling and the arguments and the\ncheating and the slamming the door\nbefore you leave at like when you break\nup like literally just have it be like a\nnice mature open conversation and like\nyou know have it be a kiss goodbye\nrather than like a slam to the door out\ntype thing you know uh don't cause any\nmore trouble uh trouble and like pain\nthan like you know you need to yeah but\ngreat advice great advice there we go\nall right Fifth and final question uh we\nask this to every guest who's ever been\non the show if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be yeah\nokay this one seems so like stupid this\nis the first thing that came up\nin my head but I think that if there was\na law that where\nif like you had to\nI feel like I'm gonna sound like so like\ncringe and like cliche doing this but\nlike if you see someone like in public\nthat's like\nvery like obviously going through it and\nlike crying and like in pain like\ngive them a hug give them like love I\nfeel like that is something that should\nbe a law I feel like nowadays there's so\nmuch hatred and\num separation in the world I feel like\nwe just need a lot more love so if there\nwas a law that was like if you see\nsomeone that needs it give them love and\ngive them a hug I feel like that would\nmake the world a lot more of a better\nplace that's awesome I love it NASA\neveryone hell is a teenage girl music is\nout right now I hope anyone who's going\nthrough a breakup been through a tough\nbreakup just wants to have good energy\nand good healing in their life should
