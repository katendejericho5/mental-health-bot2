    "transcript": "I just felt like I was so addicted to\nthis kind of false version of my life\nthat it was just taking over and the\nthing that really upset me is the Press\nran with that they were saying oh look\nhe's not the perfect happy-go-lucky kid\nyou think he is he's having a nervous\nbreakdown in New York if I was having a\nmental breakdown that's not for you to\nreport on they took the story in the\nwrong direction and they kind of painted\npeople looking for help in the wrong\nline the best-selling author and post\nthe number one Health and Wellness\npodcast on purpose with Jay Shetty\na lot of studies show that how we were\nloved or unloved between the ages of\nzero to five impact the next 15 25 50\nyears of our life Wow and how we give\nlove to ourselves and how we give love\nto others and so I was thinking do you\nhave a core memory or an experience with\nyour family from childhood that kind of\nembodies the feeling you have about them\nnow or that keeps you tied close to them\nI'd say sort of More Than A Memory is\njust a feeling that we I could say all\nof my brothers and I had was that\nbecause our dad's a comedian\nhis job\nonly ever existed once we had gone to\nbed and our mum worked from home she was\na photographer so to us as kids our\nparents didn't really work they just\nwere always home so we had this amazing\nFoundation where\nno matter any time of the day either mum\nor dad would be at the house and we felt\nso kind of solid as a family which is\nwhy like I kind of have this dream of\none day having kids and putting my work\nto bed and just kind of being there as a\ndad because I really admire how my dad\nwas around you know being a comedian is\na very very volatile job the the highs\nand lows are so extreme and as kids we\nnever saw that the only version of my\ndad I ever saw was the happy Dad let's\ngo to the park we used to play this game\ncalled golf goals where we would go down\nto the park there's like this big blue\nmetal goal and we would just fire golf\nballs into that goal every day and he\nwould give us 10p every time a ball went\nin the goal and that was kind of the\nfoundation of our Golf and and all that\nsort of stuff so for me broader than a\ncore memory was the idea of always\nfeeling connected and safe within my\nfamily unit and I think a large portion\nof that is that my mum and dad have\nalways been such a solid team and\nthey've always been there for us yeah\nwow have they as you've grown older have\nthey kind of opened up about some of the\nchallenges that they were going through\nthat they obviously didn't show you in\nyour family when you were kids because I\ncan imagine we always talk about this\nright like being a comedian is extremely\ndifficult because you're making everyone\nelse laugh at the same time it's it's a\ncareer path that like you said is\ncompletely volatile sure have they\nopened up as time's gone on and how has\nthat felt when you've gone from like\nseeing your parents always been happy to\nbeing like Oh wait there was all this\nother stuff going on absolutely they\nhave and and it's not even sometimes\nthing that they've told us it's just\nthings that we've grown up to recognize\nas a young kid you know you're not\nlooking to how's my mum feeling how's my\ndad feeling and now as an as an older\nperson you know those are things I care\nabout I want to call my mum because I\nknow it will brighten our day so that's\nall part of growing up I guess so seeing\nthe way in which my dad's job affects\nhim or my dad's job affects my mum is\nsomething we've all sort of come to\nterms with and he's amazing at it I mean\nto be honest I say effect it doesn't\nreally affect anyone he's so good at\nhandling it and which is a lot of why I\nfeel like I am the way I am for example\nthe crowded rooms come out the critics\nabsolutely hated it they thought it was\nthe worst thing they've ever seen and it\ndoesn't really upset me and I think a\nlarge part of my feeling towards that\nhas come from my dad being able to do a\ngig the gig not going well him brushing\nit off his shoulder and just right onto\nthe next one yeah well and and first of\nall I want to point that out as well so\nI've been watching the crowded room\nright and me and my wife been watching\nit together and we're actually really\nenjoying it thank you we're actually\nloving it because I love a show that has\nMysteries sure that's trying to like get\nme to figure it out and get me to think\nabout I'm kind of confused and I love\nstuff like that like I'm a massive uh\nChristopher Nolan fan yeah so all my\nfavorite movies are Nolan movies and the\nreason why I love them is because I have\nno idea what's going on sure and that's\nyou've got to figure it out and you've\ngot to figure it out and I love puzzles\nand I love escape rooms and I love\nanything yeah of anything that's got me\nthinking what is going on here and why\ncan't I figure it out right you know\nwhat you should watch I I admittedly\nwatch it to go to sleep if I'm ever\nfeeling stressed or like overstimulated\nI watched this guy called Chris Ramsey\nokay he's like a YouTube guy he's a\nmagician but I just watch him solve\npuzzles he like buys these Japanese like\nhandcrafted\npuzzle boxes wow and he just solves them\nand I've started buying them and they\ncome to the house and you sit down for\nfour hours put it down pick it up and\ntry and solve this puzzle and it's\namazing have you are you any good at\nthem no I'm terrible at them absolutely\nterrible I've had an unsolved Rubik's\nCube since I was at 11. but I am but\nyeah so I watch his videos because\nthere's just something about like the\nsound of the wood I'm a carpenter so I\nlove like craftsmanship and that sort of\nstuff so I love the way that these\npieces are put together so watching him\nsolve the puzzles I find so relaxing\nyeah I think for so many of us you know\ngetting bad\nreviews perceptions\npeople talking about us whatever maybe\nwhatever scale we live at can actually\naffect us sure and you're saying that\nactually seeing your dad letting him\nseeing him shrug it off and seeing him\nmove on actually really helped him do\nyou think that you've been able to\ncreate a bit more of a skill around that\nnow or is it something that happens\nnaturally for you because I'm guessing\nthat there's a lot of people who are\nlistening and watching going Tom that's\npretty amazing that you can do that at\nyour scale and your level but you know\nI'm still affected by that or I really\nstruggle when my mate says something\nlike I know the number one thing I hear\nis like most people don't chase their\ndreams because they're scared of what\ntheir mates will say let alone what the\nworld what the world will say yeah like\nI had this late I was I was flying back\nlast night as I was telling you so I was\non a plane from DC to London last night\nand the air hostess she was wonderful\nher name was Jeanette she said to me she\nwas like gee I really want to start a\nYouTube channel but you know you just\ngotta block out what your friends are\ngonna say right and she was just worried\nabout it so that it's a very real thing\nso I guess have you kind of figured out\na little formula for it or is it just\nnatural because you saw your dad and\nit's become easier that way I think it's\na little bit of both really you know I\nthink it's something you definitely get\nbetter at I'm really lucky that I have\nan incredibly strong group of friends\nlike one of my best mates just called me\nup earlier to say seen the fifth episode\nand he's like I know what happens in the\nshow and I'm Still Loving It the people\nI'm watching it with have no idea what's\ngoing on but they can't wait for the\nnext one so you know I really really\nhold High the opinions of people that I\nreally care about I'm also really lucky\nto have an amazing group of fans who are\nso supportive they are die-hard they are\nthere day one and that makes me feel\nreally good but I I do think a lot of my\nlessons in life have come from my dad\nand the ways that he can deal with\nthings things that he hasn't done very\nwell in the past that he's passed on to\nme and\nI sort of I live by this really I don't\nactually know if Christian Bale did say\nthis but\nI love Christmas\nyeah but I think\nthe quote is if you have a problem with\nme text me and if you don't have my\nnumber you don't know me well enough to\nhave a problem with me that is so good\nand I think that that is such a great\npiece of advice because as a celebrity\nyou live on this stage you live out\nthere you kind of give out a version of\nyourself that you want people to see and\nthat can be the version of yourself that\nthey can have a problem with or they can\nlove and there is a you know I feel like\nI'm quite authentic in my\npublic persona but I just try to really\ncare about what my family thinks what my\nfriends think\nwhat the people in my local community\nthink I live in Kingston I know everyone\nthat lives there I can't walk five feet\nwithout bumping into one of my mum's\nfriends so yeah so it's something I've\nbeen working on\nI try my best to not let that stuff\naffect me it does yeah of course I'm not\ncold-hearted or anything like that it\ndoes affect me but I just try to to move\non and focus on the positives yeah\nabsolutely absolutely what what was uh\ndid you ever see your dad deal with\neverything and you thought wow that was\nincredible was there anything specific\nthat you remember that like seeing him\nlike tackle something and you thought\nwow that really impressed me even if it\nwas something really small in hindsight\nI think the thing I admire most about my\ndad is his resilience you know he's\nsomeone who has had an incredibly\nsuccessful career in his earlier life\nand then later in life his career sort\nof plateaued and he struggled and he's\nnever stopped he's never given up he's\nstill gigging to this day he's still\nwriting books he has a patron he has a\npodcast he's constantly grafting to get\nto where he wants to be and I think\nbeing a young kid and seeing your dad\ncontinually working as hard as he can to\nkind of put his best foot forward for me\nhas been a huge drive for my work ethic\nI'll give it 100 or I'll give it nothing\nand I think a lot of that has come from\nmy dad and seeing him deal with that the\nfunny thing about my dad is you talk\nabout doing a bad gig I must have seen\nhim 20 times I've never seen him do a\nbacking he always seems to absolutely\nrip it\num but maybe that's just because we're\nin the audience but he um but no I I owe\na lot to my dad and a lot of the\nteachings are things he's told me and\nthings I've just witnessed him do yeah\nand was there ever a piece of feedback\nor a rumor or something you saw that did\naffect you where you actually thought\nwell or at least made you stop and go\nGod I'm trying to see the positives but\nthis one's tough like like this actually\nmade me have to pause and figure it out\nsomething that did really upset me\nI was in New York I was shooting the\ncrowning crowded room\nand I was having a really hard time with\nthe job just because of how taxing it\nwas the emotional capacity that I was\nhaving to get to every day\nand\nI decided to delete my Instagram because\nI just felt like I was so addicted to\nthis kind of false version of my life\nthat it was just taking over I would be\non set working I'd come and sit in my\nchair and just scroll scroll scroll\nscroll and it was it was becoming a\nproblem I was just obsessed with it and\nI was obsessed to find out what people\nwere saying and how people what they\nthought about me\nso I decided to make an announcement\nwhich unfortunately we have to do and\nsay that I'm taking a break from social\nmedia and and I try to position myself\nand say like I'm taking a break from\nsocial media because I feel like my\nmental health will benefit from it and\nthe thing that really upset me is the\nPress ran with that and they tried to\nmake out that I was having this mental\nbreakdown and what upset me was if I was\nhaving a mental breakdown that's not for\nyou to report on they they took the\nstory in the wrong direction and they\ntried they painted again this negative\nlight on Mental Health rather than\nsaying oh he's doing it it's okay that\nhe's doing it so we should all feel okay\nto do it too they were saying oh look\nhe's not the perfect happy-go-lucky kid\nyou think he is he's having a nervous\nbreakdown in New York and I think that\nthat was a really unfair line of\nJournalism let's say because I just\nthink it again kind of painted people\nlooking for help in the wrong light if\nyou know what I mean yeah yeah\nabsolutely absolutely it almost sounds\nlike you were actually preemptively\ngoing I'm doing this so that I don't\nright go in that direction totally at\nleast I'm not trying to put words in\nyour mouth but absolutely it's almost\nlike I'm proactively seeing that I could\nend up in a position where sure I might\nhave a breakdown I don't want to be in\nthat position and so I'm responsibly\nsaying guys I'm taking a break right in\norder to protect myself a hundred\npercent yeah which makes a lot of sense\nand actually is quite admirable again\ntotally and that's kind of what the\nmessage of the show is about like the\nthe message of our show is that asking\nfor help should be something that we\ncelebrate yeah if you're struggling if\nyou need help\nif you feel bad and you wake up and and\nyou go to a friend a therapist a teacher\nan employee or a colleague and say I'm\nreally struggling I need some help that\nshould be something that we give you a\npat on the back like I would love to\nhelp you that I'm delighted that you\nasked me and that for me that\nannouncement was kind of my Olive Branch\nand the Press ran with it how they ran\nwith it but to be fair it kind of gave\nme a great drive to finish the crowded\nroom in the way that we did to like if\nyou're not going to listen to my\npersonal message then you have to listen\nto the message of my show yeah so it\nkind of went hand in hand yeah yeah\nabsolutely you've you've reminded me\nactually when you said that because I\nthink we naturally today think of\ntherapists or doctors but you you\nmentioned teacher there and I was\nthinking when I was going through a\nreally rough time at school once I\nremember my walk to school from the bus\nstop I'd see a teacher every day that I\nwas really close with at school but you\nnever talk to your teachers walking to\nschool crazy person yeah and then but I\nwas so low only at the time that I\nremember like almost thinking like well\nhe's the only person I can talk to\nbecause of other stuff that I was going\nthrough at school and I remember I\nstarted talking to him on the way to\nschool his name is Mr buckeridge he\nknows I go on about him everywhere and\nhe avoids it because everyone's always\nlike oh Jay's been talking about yeah\nyeah and but it was it was that exact\nfeeling where it was like he was someone\nthat I felt I could open to it that\nopened up to at that point in my life\nwithout feeling judged without feeling\nlike he was going to see me through\nanother lens and just having that space\nto be seen for as a human who is going\nthrough stuff by a teacher was a huge\nhuge win and so you know it's you are\nright that that help can come in all\ndifferent forms and it does it doesn't\nhave to come in the ways that we\nexpected to come in yeah it doesn't have\nto be a professional yeah I go to my\nfriends a lot and and you know some\nfriends are better than others in\ncertain situations I've got some friends\nthat are very much like pull your socks\nup and get on with it and then other\nfriends were like come here and have a\ncry on my shoulder but like it it varies\nso I I just really hope that that's what\nthe show could do is yeah it's sort of\npaint this positive picture of asking\nfor help is something to be proud of\nwell that's a great message and and I\nthink we we all need to hear it and I\nwant to go back a little bit because\nthere's a lot of interviews that you've\ndone and I've watched a lot of stuff\nover the time but like we're talking\nabout a lot of it's sound bites because\nit's quick and short and like it's\nentertainment you know interviews and\nthat's why I was really grateful that\nyou took out the time to do this but you\nwere diagnosed as far as I read with\ndyslexia age seven yes and I was\nwondering how you know a lot of our\ncommunity and our audience is diagnosed\nas well or some of them are not but\nthey're finding out later on in life how\ndid that affect you or how were you set\nup for success with that from because as\nan actor you've got to learn lines\nyou've got to read lines there's a lot\nof activities that people would assume\nare quite challenging sure that you\nfound a way and walk us through that a\nlittle bit I don't know I had my mum has\nalways been really Hands-On with our\neducation\nshe you know really wanted us to just do\nour best our dad always said like look I\ndon't care what grades you get as long\nas you try your best you try your best\nand that's all that we can ask for\nyeah my dyslexia\nit's really just my spelling I mean\nhonestly it's just that yeah you know\nlike those sort of games that you play\nat Christmas have you ever played um the\none we have to write down the answers\nthe it's such a good game is it boulder\ndash I don't know boulder dash is it uh\nit's basically a game where someone will\nread out a scenario or um right ask a\nquestion and then you have to answer the\nquestion to the best of your ability but\nyou can also Bluff and lie oh I've never\nplayed this and if you write somewhat a\nbelieving answer and people vote for\nyour answer you win oh cool okay I've\nnever played it which is great but when\nI play it everyone's like\nwhat does that say that is definitely\nnot spelled right good um but yeah so my\nspelling was really the biggest hurdle\num I worked really hard at school I\ndidn't do particularly well but\nagain my parents said as long as you try\nyour best then that's all we can ask for\nyeah an acting you started early too age\nnine right like that was something that\nyou started pursuing really early on in\nlife and I feel was that something that\nyou were always sure about there's that\nthere's that famous viral Tick Tock that\nalways goes around if you you know I\ncan't I don't know how old you were\nbeing asked you know what superhero\nwould you play all right when you're\nolder you say oh maybe Spider-Man right\nand it's like and and I wonder like how\nmuch of your acting career do you feel\nlike you've manifested or there was a\nvision or a focus or is it more just\nlike this was naturally what you were\ninto and it and it grew where where did\nthat come from I do believe in\nmanifesting actually I really do I think\nwhat's interesting about my career is\nthis was never something I wanted\nI just was a young kid I loved dancing\nmy mum would take me to a dance class\nevery Saturday and I got spotted through\nthat dance class to to audition for a\nshow on the West End I ended up doing\nthe show I loved it Billy Elliot it was\nthe time of my life I you know it was\nsuch a cool experience I'm\njust by complete fluke an agent came to\nsee the show the night that I was on she\nsigned me she sent me to an audition for\na film I was lucky enough to get the\npart all of a sudden I was on set with\nyou McGregor and Naomi Watts and we made\nthe impossible\nand to be perfectly honest with you it\nwas it was just a hobby it was something\nthat my mum would let me do on the\nsummer holidays she was very keen that I\nkept my schooling up and they sort of\ncame that time in England where you're\nin between gccs and a levels and you're\ntrying to figure out when I was going\nthrough that you could still drop out at\na levels obviously now you have to do a\nlevels and\nI had that moment where I was like what\ndo I want to do I could try and stay at\nschool and figure out what I want to do\nor this thing that's been a hobby for my\nsort of summer holiday activity which is\nacting I could try and do that for a\nliving\nand I've been so lucky that I've been\nyou know offered jobs and all that sort\nof stuff\nI decided to go with it I I joined the\nBrit school because you know my mum was\nKeen that I didn't go for school for an\neducation but went to school\nto expand my social skills and meet kids\nmy own age all my friends when I was 15\nwere like 30 year old people because\nthey're all adults from the business\num so I think my mum was Keen I had some\nfriends that were my age who are now my\nbest friends today so I never really\nwanted this I just sort of never stopped\ndoing it and I love it I absolutely love\nit I love the creativity I love the\nbuilding blocks that are required to put\na film together I love the collaboration\non set between people from all different\nwalks of life you know a film set is a\nMelting Pot of all sorts of different\npeople\num so I love it I absolutely love it\nyeah wow and and I I read something that\nyou said you were bullied for like doing\nballet yeah right earlier which\nobviously got you into the playing the\nrole of Billy Elliott because it's\nballet and tap right sure it's both so\nwas was that was that tough at that time\nor like were you trying to hide it and\nthen you end up on you know you end up\nat the West End and you're on the main\nstage and everyone's seeing it or was it\nkind of easy to navigate and how did\nthat go down because I feel like as a\nkid doing ballet and tap must have been\na little challenging yeah I mean it was\nit wasn't easy but it also wasn't tough\nyou know I went to a rugby school so you\ncan imagine like the one kid in the\nschool that does ballet there's gonna be\ncomments here and there it wasn't the\neasiest thing in the world there were\nkids that didn't understand why I was\ndoing it or what I was doing it for no\nmatter how many times I explained like\nI'm the only guy in a class of 30 girls\nin tights I was like guys this is what\nyou want to be doing like rugby is not\nit but I no it was tough but again like\nit goes back to what we were saying\nabout resilience and keeping your head\ndown and crowded room was the hardest\njob I've ever had for all sorts of\ndifferent reasons and there was a point\nin time where we were talking about\ndo we shut this down and walk away from\nit because of how challenging it was and\nyou know I dug my heels in I put my head\ndown and was like no I'm gonna finish\nthis I'm going to see it through and I\nthink you know you learn from past\nexperiences like that so I really am\nproud of the way we everyone handled the\ncrowded room and I think that stems from\nmy childhood my dad's experiences and\nall that sort of stuff yeah well so I've\ngot a confession as well to me go on so\nI went to rugby school as well okay I\nplayed yeah I played for my a team and I\nwas I was pretty are you in the 80s\nthat's pretty good okay\nBlind Side flanker okay yeah so I was I\nwas really into rugby because I went to\nrugby school and I loved football but my\nschool didn't play football and so I was\nlike no I've got to be on the school's\nmain team sure so I worked really hard\nto get on the team\nbut after we play rugby on a Saturday my\nmum forced me to go to dance class and\npart of it was ballet and Taff as well\nalthough I did not end up at the West\nEnd because I don't think Billy Elliot\nwas brown so but that wasn't going to\nhappen yeah it wasn't the same path as\nyou but but I also had that experience\nthat's what I had to ask you about did\nyou enjoy it I really enjoyed it for the\ncommunity aspect of it like I love all\nthe lads that I was there with they were\njust they were just a great laugh and it\nwas really interesting because we'd go\nfrom I'd literally go from playing rugby\nstraight to class on a Saturday and I'd\ngo in there with all my bruises\nexhausted and all the rest of it but\neveryone's just so much fun sure and\nit's almost like the rugby picture was\nmore stressful because everyone was like\nyou know trying to be intense and trying\nto be this and that whereas everyone\njust having to laugh at the dance guys\nwe do everything from hip-hop to Street\nto love it whatever but yeah I remember\nnever telling I I think it's the first\ntime I've ever spoken about it's out\nthere it's been a safe space with you so\nbut it's interesting because Rugby's\nregimented isn't it yeah I love it you\nplay it you play a position that is as\nspecific as saying The Blind Side\nflanker you know when you're a dancer\nyou're just a dancer you know you you\ncan fit in however you want to fit in\nyeah the teacher can ask you how are you\nfeeling about that rather than like you\nneed to get your head down to the left\nto make a proper tackle I did love\nplaying rugby when I was smaller yeah\nwhen all the well not when I was smaller\nwhen all the kids were smaller and then\nthere was that time where I came back to\nschool after billilly and everyone had\njust become a man and I was still very\nmuch a child yeah I remember we played\nthis school called Trinity College and\nit was my first game back and I was\nplaying scrum half I came on the second\nhalf and it was a violent game it was\nnot it was not a gentleman's game of\nrugby and I was standing there were\nkicking to us we're receiving and I\nremember thinking as long as the ball\ndoesn't come to me off for the kick I'll\nbe fine I need the game to get going and\nthen I'll be fine I'm scrum half\nrelatively safe position I'm a good\nplaymaker as soon as he kicked the ball\nit's coming straight towards me I I'm\ntrying to catch it I can hear the boots\nrunning towards me I fumble it knock on\nthe game goes on I start playing well I\nassisted a try and then I don't remember\nwhat happened or how it happened\nbut there was a a really tough kid on\nour team who will remain nameless I\nhaven't spoken to him since I don't know\nwhat he's doing but he got into a fight\nwith some kid on the opposing team and\nit was really quite ugly and then the\nkid's dad came on the pitch\nto tell off this boy that was on my team\nand the kid on my team knocked out his\ndad no like proper like it's the first\ntime I've ever seen someone hit someone\nand I couldn't believe that a kid who\nwas how old are you yeah he must have\nbeen\n16 at the time but he's one of those 16\nyear olds that would look older than I\ndo now when he was 16 and I just\nremember hearing the noise he'd like\ncracked this down on the jaw Hit the\nFloor then this whole big fight broke\nout I'm not a fighter I stepped away and\nstuff like what's going on\nyeah it was wild and that was the last\ngame of rugby I ever played it was\nagainst Trinity College oh my God yeah\nit was really intense wow yeah that's\nhow intense it got I my last game was\nsimilar but not not watching a fight so\nsomeone ran\nI had it was a big game and I was\nplaying really well that season and\neverything was going really well and\nsomeone ran into a rock but with their\nelbow which is obviously illegal totally\nthey ran in and they elbowed me right\nthere like right Belen it's on this side\nand right below there and then next\nthing I know I get up and I'm like kind\nof feeling a bit aggressive are you cut\nas well but I didn't notice and then\nBlood starts to drip and I was like\nthat's when you freak out because oh God\nI'm like I can and there's a lot of\nblood just dripping so I get subbed off\nand the nurse on the side just puts a\nbit of glue there like stick it together\nand at the moment at that time you don't\nreally notice in you think you're all\nright and then literally an hour later\nit's just getting thicker and thicker\nand thicker I'm ending up with this run\nto the hospital on the way home because\nmy coach was just like suck it up it's\nfine you'll be fine run there they're\nlike if you were any later you would\nhave had nerve damage and like\npersonally potentially lost your\neyesight whatever it was and they had to\nlike glue it and a little bit of\nstitches or whatever it was and I for\nthe for them rest of the month I walked\naround with my like you know I literally\nhanging over and I looked like I'd got\ninto like the worst fight like I walked\ninto a store and everyone would kind of\nback off and stuff and it was just\nreally uncomfortable that was my last\ngame of rugby that's why I just\nremembered that but yeah it was it was\ninto it was it was intense but it was\ngreat like you said it was great\nregimented discipline training I love\ntraining with my mates I love playing I\nloved as a young man as well like having\na outlet to release the energy that I\nhad totally was good in in obviously in\na way that wasn't trying to hurt others\nbut that's what's so great about boxing\nyeah it's like boxing is such a great\nrelease you know you see these young\nkids like young kids who are angry you\nneed to let something go like go and\npunch a bag for an hour oh that will\nmake you that'll calm you down I love\nhow boxing is such a great thing for\nyoung for young people to to release\nthat sort of event are you boxing I love\nboxing it's been a few years since I've\nI've done any sort of training I used to\ngo to this great gym in um in New York\ncalled Church Street boxing I just love\nit there had a great Pro you could sort\nof spar with him because you know that\nhe wouldn't batter you because he could\ncontrol himself I went to one sparring\nsession just\na General Session and I got absolutely\nyeah it was tough but I love it I love\nthe sport I'm a little bit sad as to\nlike how the sport is being run right\nnow right\num but I do love the sport and I admire\nthe athletes I think they're amazing\nwhat's your take on YouTube is boxing\nand all that kind of stuff and because\nit's obviously bringing a lot of\nattention to the sport to be perfectly\nhonest with you man I don't really mind\nit I think it's quite fun I think if\nyou're doing it for the right reasons\nyou know it's a great opportunity to\nraise some money for amazing Charities\nand I think a few of them have done a\nlot for charity I think it's really\ngreat I think yeah you know my brother\nPaddy would never have been watching\nboxing and now yeah because of his\nfavorite YouTubers are boxing so yeah if\nit's good for the sport it's good for\nthe sport I sort of don't really mind I\nthink it's funny to be honest yeah\nbecause you sit at home watching you're\nlike I could do that I can get in there\nand do that you're like well why don't\nyou and you're like well yeah I don't\nreally want to do that so we might see\nyou in Creed Four then yeah yeah yeah\nyeah we'll do that we'll do the acting\nboxing I'd love to do a boxing movie\nyeah I think it would be cool to do a\nboxing movie but where the fighting is\nreal\nwalk me through that I wouldn't\nnecessarily be in that film right but I\ndo think that you could make a really\ninteresting film where the outcome of\nthe film is determined on\nthe outcome of the real fight has\nanything like that ever been done like\nracing or any can you I'm just trying to\nnot that I know yeah I know that's what\nI'm trying to think it could be really\ncool yeah wow but yeah I love I love\nboxing movies I'm a sucker for it yeah\nwhich ones which which one's your\nfavorite I think Rocky 2 is probably my\nfavorite I remember when we were in\nBilly Elliot we had this room called the\nBilly room and there was always a billy\nbackstage while the show was going on\nbecause the show was so labor intensive\nit was very dangerous there's lots of\nmoving Parts there's lots of acrobatics\nit wasn't too uncommon for a billy to\nget injured and then there would be\nsomeone upstairs who would replace that\nBilly and we would just hang out\nupstairs and there was an Xbox and a\ntelevision and all that sort of stuff\nand one of the DVDs that we had the two\nDVDs we had was step up to the streets\nmy favorite film of all time and Rocky\ntoo and I've must have seen that film 40\ntimes how many times did you practice\nthe dance in the mirror oh man I've got\nthe whole dance down right can we see it\nyeah no I love that film I absolutely\nlove that film yeah I'd say I'd say my\nfavorite so Rocky was my favorite\nbecause I'd watch it with my dad and\nRocky\noh I I struggle between Rocky 3 and\nRocky IV because I loved Mr T and that's\nfour three that's three that's three I\nloved Ivan Drago as well which was four\nand they were both just such great\nmovies yeah yeah yeah it was just yeah\nit's such great entertainment even\nthough it's nothing like real boxing\nyeah nothing is at all\nbut then I remember watching real boxing\nwhen I was growing up it was Prince\nNaseem oh man yeah yeah my dad was a big\nfan of his so I'd remember watching him\na lot I love his style there's a video\nof him working with the I guess he's\njust it's like a swinging bag and he is\nso effortless because canelo's got great\nhead movement but but he looks like he's\nthinking about it yeah whereas nazim is\njust living the dream just he's so fluid\nand I love the way he used to move yeah\nyeah and I love how he would enter the\nring\nme I would over rotate and just slam on\nmy face or something yeah he was\nbrilliant there's like wrestling meets\nboxing yeah yeah yeah it must have been\na nightmare to fight yeah he must have\nbeen like he's beating me and he's\nembarrassing me this is really tough\nterrible what do you think of lemachenko\ndid you see his last fight I haven't no\nI didn't see it I didn't see it that's\nan interesting one go and tell me I I\ndidn't see it at all well I think the\ngeneral consensus is that he won uh but\nit was given the other way right right\nhe is my favorite boxer right because of\nhis history his background in dance he\nwas like I guess a really talented boxer\nand then I guess I don't know if this is\ntrue but his dad sent him to go and\nstudy dance for sort of five years or\nsomething like that for his boxing for\nhis boxing which is why his footwork is\nlike on another planet there's loads of\nexamples of where he's fighting people\nand they look up and he's just gone he's\nbehind them so I I really admire him but\nhis most recent fight he lost how did it\ngo against him was it a vote it was a\nvote yeah yeah they went against him so\nI wonder whether they'll fight again\nyeah I guess they'll have to if there's\nit seems like this isn't a conspiracy\ntheory that's the problem with boxing\nthough like will they fight again yeah\nyou know because it's a tricky it's a\ntricky business unlike the UFC where you\nknow if they want to fight they'll fight\nthat's what I love about it I took my\nbrother and my cousin to the UFC the\nother night and\nthat is such a Savage spool it is that\nis yeah it's terrifying I really don't\nwant that to be a movie and a real one\nI've seen the Warriors\nThe Warrior is one of the most\nunderrated movies\nit's a little ridiculous the idea that\nthey have like six fights a night\ngetting ready for one final but I do\nlove that film yeah yeah it's a really\ngood movie it's really good movie oh\nwell okay all right so we know there's a\nboxing movie coming somewhere yeah\nthere's got to be one down the line\nthere's got to be one down there\nabsolutely yeah and we want to see you\nwork your way up and uh think I mean we\nmight see you like you know actually go\ndo it for real yeah imagine for charity\nmaybe one of the things that you\nmentioned recently was that you gave up\ndrinking about a year and a half ago yes\nand you said it was the hardest thing\nyou ever did yes and I wanted to know\nwhat was so hard about it for you why\nwas it so hard it's interesting I I\ndidn't one day wake up and say I'm\ngiving up drinking I just\nlike many Brits that had a very very\nboozy December Christmas time I was on\nvacation I was drinking a lot and I've\nalways been able to drink a lot I think\nI get my jeans from my mum's side in\nthat thing I can I can drink\nand I decided to just give up for\nJanuary I just wanted to do dry January\nand\nall I could think about was having a\ndrink\nit's all I could think about I was\nwaking up thinking about it I was\nchecking the clock when's it 12.\nand it just really scared me I just was\nlike wow maybe maybe I have a little bit\nof an alcohol thing so I sort of decided\nto punish myself and say I'll do\nFebruary as well I'll do two months off\nif I can do two months off then I can\nprove to myself I don't have a problem\ntwo months go by\nand I was still really struggling I felt\nlike I couldn't be social I felt like I\ncouldn't go to the pub and have a lime\nsoda\nI couldn't go out for dinner I was\nreally really struggling and I started\nto really worry that maybe I had an\nalcohol problem\num so I decided that I would wait until\nmy birthday which is June 1st I said to\nmyself if I can do six months without\nalcohol then I can prove to myself that\nI don't have a problem and by the time I\nhad got to June 1st I was the happiest\nI've ever been in my life\nI could sleep better I could handle\nproblems better\nthings that would go wrong on set that\nwould normally set me off I could take\nin my stride I had so much such better\nmental Clarity I felt healthier I felt\nfitter and I just sort of said to myself\nlike why why am I\nenslaved this drink why am I so obsessed\nby the idea of having this drink and I\nwould look back and recognize that I\nwould go to events for for work and you\nknow I can't enjoy myself until I've had\na few beers\nand I just felt so much pressure and\nthis is one of the things why I've sort\nof distanced myself from the rugby\nCommunity because so much of it is about\nhow much can you drink let's get you as\ndrunk as possible and it's honestly been\nthe best thing I've ever done I'm a year\nand a half into it now\nit doesn't even cross my mind I found\namazing Replacements that I think are\nfantastic ones that are also really\nhealthy I found this one beer that\nit's full of electrolytes and it's you\nknow the carbohydrates in it are\nlong-lasting energy so like having a\nbeer is now actually like a really\nhealthy thing I'm really lucky that all\nmy friends are super supportive about it\nI've never run into that scenario where\nmy friends are like I'll go on just have\na beer like you're fine they've always\nsort of really supported me and I don't\nwant to be that person that's saying to\npeople you should get sober you should\nget sober if I could encourage someone\nto drink less\nthen that's great but I I don't want to\nstart getting into the world of you need\nto stop drinking because I just it's not\nfor me to say I went on my own little\njourney I'm really enjoying it I'm\ndelighted that my mum's almost has also\ngiven up she's loving it and it's been\namazing I can't believe the difference\nthat I feel from not drinking yeah I\nfeel amazing that's amazing man I love\nhearing that and I love hearing that\nit's been great for you right I think\nyeah that's the point not everything has\nto be like look what I did you can do it\ntoo it's kind of like no this is just\nwhat's been great for me do you think it\nwas partly that attitude for you at\nleast in the beginning where it's like\nwell look I can drink I drink a lot\ncomes from my mum jeans and it doesn't\naffect me and then all of a sudden you\nrealize well wait a minute it's more\nthan that because I think there is that\nlike I was like that as a young man as\nwell like for me it was it was easy to\ndrink I I didn't drink daily for me I\ndrank a lot more socially sure and I\nlove playing drinking games with my\nmates yeah absolutely I enjoyed the most\nprobably and for me when I quit I could\njust quickly see how it just got me into\ndoing things I would never do if I\nwasn't drunk so for sure for me it was\nmore that but yeah I wonder for you did\nyou find that it's there's a really fine\nline between like oh I know I can drink\na lot and then all of a sudden you're\nkind of not addicted beyond that no\naddictive I'm happy to say a lot I was\ndefinitely addicted to alcohol not\nshying away from that at all I think\nanyone that wakes up and has not wakes\nup anyone that has a beer every day is\nprobably got a little bit of a problem\nbut yeah you're right I I would drink\nand drink and drink and drink and then\nyou would just reach that moment where\nyou're like wow I shouldn't have had\nthat last beer and you wake up the next\nday and you have a terrible headache and\nyou're suffering I bought one of those\nrings that will tell you about your\nsleep yeah or a ring yeah and it was\namazing because I couldn't sleep I was\nlike why can't I sleep I'm working 14\nhours a day I'm doing two hours in the\ngym I'm eating really healthily and I\ncan't sleep what's wrong with me I\nbought this ring and it was booze it\njust it was a completely affected my\nsleep and since I've given it up I can\nsleep anywhere you know it's also\ninteresting as well going on nights out\nand having a great time as the sober\nperson and then getting to that point in\nthe night where people start you know\nspitting in your ear and everyone's I\nlove you man I love you so much and\nyou're like yeah brilliant I love you\ntoo I'll see you tomorrow I'm going to\nbed I love being that person now yeah I\nlove seeing my friends on the golf\ncourse at 8am in the morning feeling\nfresh and ready to go and they're sort\nof crawling out their car and so yeah so\nI I'm\njust over the moon to be sober I love it\nyeah for anyone who is listening right\nnow and it's going Tom I love that for\nyou I want to do it too like they're\nlistening going I'm having too much\nevery day I can notice some of those\nthings but I'm just stuck and it's hard\nbecause we know that addictions that way\nwe know that this is heavy it's not easy\nbut if someone is watching going Tom\ntell me like what what did you do to\neven get started how did you have that\ncourage to say I'm gonna do January I'm\ngonna stick at it were there any moments\nwhere you actually fell back and then I\nhad to get back on the horse again like\njust walk us through that a little bit\nmore for anyone who is watching going\nTom mate I I want to be in your position\nin like six months I didn't fall back on\nit I have done in the past like I've had\nperiods of my life where I've given up\ndrinking and then gone back to drinking\num but this time\nI don't know it was just different I\nreally worked to sort of change my\nmindset I really asked myself like why\ndo you drink why are you drinking and a\nlot of the time my answer would be to\nfeel more comfortable in a social\nenvironment yeah and I just put myself\nin those environments and just would\nforce myself to be there I'd force\nmyself to hang out and and go to a club\nor go to a bar go to a dinner yeah so we\nweren't avoiding those places I was at\nthe beginning because I didn't feel like\nI could go and not have a drink because\nof the stress of it but then after a\nwhile I sort of was like mate you've got\nto pull your socks up here and you can't\njust live in your house all the time\nyou've got to go out and enjoy yourself\nand and if you're only enjoying yourself\nbecause you're drinking then you really\ndo have a problem but I just changed my\nmindset I just I found really good\nreplacements things that I could sort of\nattribute to having a beer I often found\nwith me most of it is just the ritual of\ncracking something open and sharing it\nwith friends and drinking it whether\nit's sparkling water or a beer I now\ncan't I don't associate like I don't see\na difference yeah but I think it's\ndifferent for everyone I had a great\nsupport system Jack is one of my best\nmates and we traveled all over the world\nhe doesn't drink and doing it with him\nwas was a really\nhelpful experience for me my brother is\nalways on the road with me he was very\nsupportive and yeah I just really set my\nmind to it I was like I really want to\ndo this I want to prove to myself I can\ndo it yeah and then once I'd felt the\nhealth benefits and started really\nfeeling like my full self yeah I was\nlike oh my God this is this is the best\nbut do you not drink I even drank for 17\nyears no way congratulations that's\namazing amazing yeah it's incredible wow\nso one of the best feelings in the world\nand it's my my biggest like worry when I\nwas about to quit was like how am I\ngoing to hang out with my mates that was\nmy biggest word yes worry I was like my\nmates knew me as the guy who was like\nfirst of the game last to get out like\nthat was me right you know the clown\nwhen I got drunk like life of the party\nkind of like that kind of guy and then\nall of a sudden I I decided I wasn't\ngonna drink anymore I was like crap I'm\ngonna fit in and then I remember I went\ninto the corporate world for a bit and I\ndidn't drink and I was like God am I\ngoing to miss out on like opportunities\nand networking like you know all the\nguys afterwards are like going to get\ndrinks and I'm like I'll come but I'll\nhave a water or I'll have a soda\nwhatever it is or and what was really\ninteresting for me is not relying on\nDrinking Made Me rely on qualities and\nskills I had sure that were actually\nbetter yeah so now that I couldn't drink\nas an excuse to hang with the lads I was\nbringing out parts of my personality\nthat I probably would have just hidden\naway suppressed and all of a sudden you\nwere actually getting respected and\nliked for who you were right rather than\nthe person who you were when you were\ndrunk sure and and actually that worked\nin the workplace and there was no one at\nthe workplace going RJ doesn't drink so\nhe's not getting promoted right it\nwasn't like that people were like oh\nyeah I really like hanging out with Jay\nalways he's a really good guy or\nwhatever it may be and I was still\ngetting the same opportunities and I was\nstill getting promoted at work and\nwhatever it was and I think that's what\nI'd like to remind people that don't\nfeel like your career or your work is\ngoing to suffer even for you like you've\nI'm sure as a you know with your career\npath you have to be at parties you have\nto be at events of course and the fact\nthat you're able to do that now without\nhaving alcohol and you don't it doesn't\nsound like it's negatively impacting\nyour career if anything is the opposite\nbut mate I honestly cannot believe like\nthe amount of times I've sat down with\nan actor that I've really admired or sat\ndown with a producer or director and\nbeing like Oh you know well I don't\ndrink anymore and they go I don't drink\n10 years and you're like oh my God and\nI've had so many insightful\nconversations with people like yourself\nwhere you've heard their story their\nreason for giving up and there is a\nwonderful community of people and I love\nit I love being a part of that Community\nI'm really proud to be a part of it I\nhope that you know I can meet other\npeople and chat them about it because\nit's really nice it's lovely to be like\nlet's go get a lime soda together you\nknow yeah let's get a juice\nyeah yeah no it is true it's true and\nit's really interesting because they I\ncan't remember I'm trying to remember\nthere was this blog that came out years\nago I can't even remember it now and\nthere was this girl on Instagram who was\ngetting a lot of likes and a lot of\ncomments and a lot of attention\nand one day she just disappeared like\nshe stopped posting and everyone's just\nlike all the comments were like where\nare you what happened are you okay like\nwhat happened to you you know everyone\nwas frantic trying to figure out what\nhappened to her because they loved her\nthey were following her and all the rest\nof it and\nwhat they didn't know is that it was\nbuilt by a team that was trying to show\nthat what people didn't notice is that\nin every picture she posted she was\ndrinking and it was a made-up it was\nalmost like original AI that was made up\nto prove the point that you can love\nsomeone and you could think you're\nreally close to them and you you could\nthink their lifestyle looks amazing but\nactually they've got a drink in every\npicture they post and you didn't realize\nthey had an alcohol problem so there was\nno real person who died but the point\nwas that this your friends could be\nstruggling even when they're posting\nthese beautiful lifestyle pictures but\nare you aware wow and are you conscious\nof how much it affects you and I can't\nremember who built that people I think\nthat's one of the problems with alcohol\nis that if you came out with alcohol\nright now if alcohol wasn't a thing a\nnew lot I've invented this drink that is\ngonna make you like either really happy\nor really aggressive or really stupid\nand we're gonna just sell it to the\nmasses people be like Nami keep your\nfunky juice like we don't want that that\nsounds terrible and it's one of those\nthings because it is so socially\nacceptable the the addiction side of it\nthe bad sides of it really do fly under\nthe radar yeah and that's really\ninteresting I tell you something I do\nlove about being a non-drinker I love\nbeing the designated driver\nI love being that person that makes sure\nthat everyone gets home\nI don't know I just I like being a\nDependable person I I think I'm quite\nDependable I really like that that um\nthing and I saw this crazy YouTube video\nonce this was years ago of a guy that\nwent to a bar he got drunk and he drove\nhome and he crashed his car\nand I don't know if this is real it\ncould have been fake but it's really\nimpactful basically what his friend had\ndone was\nset up the room as if he had been in a\ncoma for like 10 years\nand his friend wakes up hours after the\ncrash and his friend is there and he had\nall like old makeup on to make him look\nolder and now I'm thinking about it\nthere's no way this could have been real\nbecause how would they have been able to\npull that off but he basically is saying\nto him like you've been asleep for 10\nyears everyone's missed you like we\ncan't believe you're awake this is\namazing and it shows like how a stupid\ndecision like driving drunk can affect\nthe future of your life so I do love\nbeing the designated driver that is\nsomething I enjoy seeing my friends have\na good time being like don't worry Tom\nwill take you home yeah\nI I used to love being the designated\ndriver until I realized that\nex-girlfriend just had me do that\nbecause I was the one who didn't yeah\nright that wasn't a fun designated\ndriver yeah but I've always been that\nguy since because so I lived as a monk\nfor three years yeah amazing and uh when\nI came back after that obviously I never\nwent back to drinking alcohol and\neverything and so but I went back into\nthe workplace and I remember everyone\nwould always open up to me and give me\nadvice but it's what you're saying when\nsomeone was drunk they tell me their\nwhole life story yeah next day they'd\nwake up and go Jay you'd actually\nremember what I said I remember\neverything please don't tell anyone you\nknow I loved I loved that part where I\nwas like I was able to be there for\npeople totally just hear their stories\n100 and someone that had context the\nnext day because if they told someone\nelse who was drunk you'd both not\nremember and then it'd be gone no I I\nthink the benefits that you've just\npointed out good sleep good health great\nmental Clarity it's absolutely huge but\nthere's a couple of things I want to\npoint out for everyone who's listening\njust as takeaways because Tom makes it\nso seamless when you're talking about\nit's really beautiful as well but one of\nthe things you mentioned was Finding\nAlternatives and during my monk life we\nalways talked about how there was there\nwas something that we called the higher\ntaste and it was saying you can never\ngive up a lower taste unless you had a\nhigher taste sure and so there has to be\na switch there has to be a replacement\nand the fact that you found alternatives\nI think that's half the battle sure\nbecause most of us are trying to take\nsomething out of our lives and then\nyou're just trying to fill it yeah and\nthen you have to go back to what you had\nbefore because you're not finding a\nreplacement so that was beautiful and\nthe second thing you said which I loved\nwhich was having this conversation and\ndialogue with other people someone who's\none year ahead of you someone who's 10\nyears ahead someone who's 20 years ahead\nwho's gone through that process and\nthey're open and honest and vulnerable\nabout you know I did have a weak moment\nor you know what this was really tough\nfor me and I think having those\ncommunities where you can talk about\nthese things makes a massive difference\nso if anyone's struggling I hope that\nthose two things can kind of you know\ngive you the support you need and again\nit goes back to the message of the show\nis it like you should ask for help yeah\nand you should feel power to do so yeah\nbut tell me about your monk life like\nthat must have been amazing I've always\nbeen so tempted to go away and do one of\nthose Retreats where you know you go to\nsomewhere like India and you go to those\nplaces where you don't speak for a month\nor something like that like that must\nhave just been the most enlightening\nexperience mate now that you've said\nthat when you when you want to go I'm\ngoing to take you please yeah I know\nwhen I absolutely love to go I met a guy\nI was on holiday earlier this year and\nhe had just got back from a retreat he\ndid two weeks where he didn't make a\nsound and was just explaining to me how\neye-opening it was yeah yeah no I I mean\nto me it was one of the best experiences\nof my life because even the stuff that I\ndid then I was 22 years old when I did\nit\neven the stuff that I did then I don't\neven know if I'd be able to do it\nanymore now but there was such a like\nenergy you had as a 22 year old sure\nit's just opened any experience and\nwanting to try it all out amazing and I\nthink for me it was because and it comes\nback to the people that have done things\nwhen I was 18 was when I first met a\nmonk I never really knew what monks did\nor any of their practices but I met a\nmonk who I write about in my book who\njust\nblew my mind because he was the first\nperson I met that I felt was at ease\nwith himself and when I was 18 I'd met\npeople who were like rich and famous and\nyou know beautiful and powerful and all\nthis type of stuff but I don't think I'd\nmet anyone who was truly happy and\ncontent with themselves not happy like\noh I'm so happy life's amazing I mean\nmore like happy with peace with who they\nare who they were yeah totally and for\nsome reason at 18 that kind of like was\nan arrow straight to my heart where I\nwas like that's that's real like I want\nthat and it just it's so hard to explain\nbecause everyone's like well how did you\nknow that 18 I was like I don't know it\nmust have been how powerful he was it's\nkind of like it's kind of like you wake\nup when when the sun's out and the\nlights out and you just wake up because\nyou feel that energy and I felt it\nthrough him and then I went to\nUniversity and I'd talk to him and I'd\nmeet him in the Summers and Christmases\nbut I just decided I was like I want to\ndo this because I'd met someone who I\nfelt had emotional a mental Mastery in a\nway that I'd never seen before wow and\nso when I went out there and whether it\nwas the meditation training or whether\nit was the Simplicity training of the\nlifestyle or whether it was the the\nteachings and the values that you had to\nlive by\nI just got so I got so much from it that\nI honestly believe that anything that\nI'm good at doing today is because of\nwhat I learned during that time yeah and\nso anything I'm good at today is because\nof that do you think that you found what\nhe had yeah I believe so and I would say\nthat or has yes yeah yeah and I still\nsee him every year amazing and he still\nhas it like yeah it's like Swag like it\ndoesn't go yeah he still has it and yeah\ndefinitely definitely I got a glimpse\ninto it obviously he's been doing it for\nyou know nearly 30 years and yeah I only\ndid it for three but you still get to a\nglimpse of it if you get an experience\nof it so you know that it exists right\nand I think that's half the battle too\nlike even with your sobriety it's like\nyou just need to know it exists totally\nand then you're like wow there's this\nother side 100 and even though it's a\nchallenge and even though I'm still\ntrying to be more mindful every day and\nI'm still working on myself because it's\nof course I know this yeah it's an\nongoing thing yeah I know I know and I\ntake a lot of friends and and people I\nknow on Retreats there because just a\ncouple of years ago I took uh someone\nthat I love to one of the caves in\nrishikesh so one of the things I love\nabout caves is that they're equally dark\nand Silent yeah so it's almost like the\nfirst time like we could be silent in\nthis room and it would be silent but the\nSilence of a cave is just a different\nlevel yeah and so when you go in then\nyou can't see anything either so you\ncan't even see yourself so you're so\ndeep into the cave that there's no light\nfrom the mouth of the cave there's no\nlife from the mouth of the cave oh I\ndon't know about that right\nno you hold hands\nbut it's it's just it's one of those\nexperiences that you actually get to\nexperience real Stillness and real\nsilence and real real disconnection sure\nfrom everything around you and then you\ncan actually listen to yourself yeah\nit's interesting yeah I would love to do\nsomething like that something that I\nfind myself doing a lot\nis\nif I see\na beautiful landscape or something\nI will try and\nsee if I can find an angle of it where\nthere's nothing man-made in The View\nbecause you know what it's like like you\nsee a beautiful Hill or something and\nthere's a telephone pole in the middle\nof it or a Lamppost or something so\ndoing something like that where there is\nnothing but just mother nature and the\nsilence and being with yourself\nI'm obsessed with nature it's like one\nof my biggest passions I'm absolutely\nlike this new our planet show has just\ncome out one sitting I've done the whole\nthing\num so I would love to do something like\nthat so the next time you go in yeah\nwe'll figure it out no where's where's\nthe place I love nature too I just took\nmy me and my wife just went to Bali oh I\nlove Harley yeah and it was unbelievable\nwe went white water rafting and it\nalmost felt like Jurassic Park I was\njust waiting for a dinosaur head to pop\nout and it was just beautiful it was so\nLush it was so natural\nwaterfalls everywhere and another place\nthat I've Loved nature-wise India of\ncourse we mentioned but Iceland I would\nlove to go to Iceland a few years ago\nand my friend who was filming a a\ndocumentary out there and so I got to\nexperience it with the documentary\nTravelers and we went to a real Glacier\nand we went to amazing you know and it\nwas incredible to just it was the first\ntime I felt like I'd landed on another\nplanet yeah yeah it was just I literally\nI was like this looks like nothing I've\never seen before in my life like I'm on\nanother like I I could have yeah I could\nhave gone into a space in London or\nanother there's a reason why every\nsingle space film Iceland is the first\non the list for locations\nI think Interstellar probably yeah\nso I'm sure all of those films yeah\nbecause you could do you could do Mars\nyou could do Venus all in you know in\nIceland I would love to go I don't know\nwe were thinking about\ndoing some climbing and I'm not sure\nabout how I feel about\nglaciers and walking across them and\njust falling and never being found yeah\nwe we walked across them and obviously\nthere were teams there sure and then\nthey had an expert and they went down\ninto the glacier like they went into one\nlike and it was and it was really scary\nbecause while we were walking on the\nglacier and we've got the I forgot what\nthose little boots are called the ones\nwith the kind of like the little prongs\nyeah yeah yeah but I forgot what they're\ncalled but anyway we had those on and uh\ncrap ons\ncrampons okay\nand so we're wearing these crampons and\nand literally it was like three steps\nfurther and you you would have fallen\nand you don't see it and you would never\nbe found never it should never be found\nyou'd never know and it would be like\nthat movie was it 126 hours yeah I had\nto soar for his own arms 126 hours mate\nin 10 minutes\nyeah I know I that that's a bit too far\nfor me well if you went with a group of\nyou know experts and all the rest of it\nyeah but you've seen the documentary\nsometimes the experts go out and it's\none it's a one-way story they don't ever\ncome back you know yeah yeah yeah no you\ngot you got to be careful I\nit was pretty spectacular it was really\namazing no I love I love that with your\njourney with so bright and again the\nother thing we were talking about this\nearlier going back to it was you\ndecided to take a break from acting yeah\nbecause you were doing this role it was\nreally tough and challenging and and\nyou're like you need some time and again\nyou were saying that that was\nmisconstrued and I just before we dive\ninto why you needed to take a break and\nand what was challenging about it I just\nwanted to just if you wanted to give\ncontext to that and you don't have to\nbut if you wanted sure to clarify what\nyou meant and what was going on there\nit's only a break from acting because\nI'm an actor yeah it's not like the\nacting itself I just have been so lucky\nthat in my life I've been working so\nmuch I just wanted to take a break I\njust wanted to be in one place for a\nwhile I wanted to be with my friends be\nwith my family move into my house\nso it wasn't necessarily\noh my God I need to have a break from\nacting because it's too much I just\nneeded to have a break from traveling\nand working and and also I've done so\nmuch of my growing up on the road I\nneeded to do a lot of growing up at home\npaying my water bill paying my council\ntax and sorting out my bins and all that\nsort of stuff that they don't teach you\nat school which I think there should be\na lesson I think there should be a\nlesson at school that's called life\nwhich is like laundry basic cooking like\nI didn't realize you had to pay for your\nwater I just thought that was a luxury\nof living in England yeah water comes\nout the sky and then it comes out your\nTAP I was so behind on my water bill I\ndidn't realize I'm up to date now don't\nworry so yeah I just wanted to take this\nbreak and it's a shame again talking\nabout the press and how they can spin\nthings it's a shame that this year off\nhas come after this incredibly hard job\nand that they kind of ran with this idea\nthat yes the show did break me and yes\nit was difficult but I could have gone\nback to work I was always planning on\ntaking this break after this job so\nthank you for giving me the time to sort\nof clarify that I am loving having time\noff and going back to work is\nsomething that isn't really on my radar\nyet I'm just loving being with my family\nand my friends and and enjoying you know\nthe fruits of my labor a little bit and\ntraveling and seeing the world\nbecause you know we get to see the world\nfor work\nbut it's different yeah you know going\noff of your own accord and and seeing\nthese places and meeting people is is\nwhat I love I'm very social which is one\nof the things I found so difficult about\ngiving up alcohol is because I was like\nthat's my key to my social life and then\nI realized I was like no you're just\nactually naturally a really social\nperson the alcohol is just an additive\nto that yeah so get rid of it so yeah so\nmy my year off has been amazing I'm\nloving it I'm six months seven months\ninto it now I have a job to go to but\nyou know obviously we're going through\nthis writer's strike right now yeah\nwe're unsure as to where we are\num I'm hoping that you know the writers\ncan make a deal and will be looked after\nas they should be because it'd be great\nto get back to work but I'm in no rush\nI'm really loving some time at home yeah\nbecause how old are you now 27 yeah and\nso if you've been working since you were\nnine or at least yeah later on into your\nteens I think yeah yeah and then people\nforget that and I I coach personally a\nlot of musicians and who go on tour a\nlot sure and I just finished a 40 City\nWorld Tour for my second book and we did\nlike 40 cities maybe in like 75 80 days\nmaybe like it was intense and we went\nall over the world so we did like we've\nnever done anything like that yeah did\n15 cities in the US and then 25 cities\naround the world and so we did everyone\nfrom Paris Amsterdam Berlin Melbourne we\ndid three shows at the Sydney Opera\nHouse Brisbane did Singapore did five\nshows in India did Dubai wow but it was\nand it was amazing I had one of the best\nexperiences of my life at the same time\nI was reflecting on\nmy music clients who have to do 150\nshows a lot of them pull out of doing\ntheir tours a lot of them announce kind\nof like you're saying I took a break\nsure a lot of them will announce and say\nyou know what guys I can't I can't\nfinish I can't do it anymore and it's\nreally interesting because I messaged\nsome of them straight away saying I\nalways could understand why you needed\nthat sure now I actually have actual\nempathy for you 100 because now I'm on\nthe road and I can see how displacing it\nis sure and I'm older and I have a\ncertain set of skills that help me with\nthat based on my monk life and all the\nrest of it but I can imagine if you've\nbeen touring since you were 15 years old\nwhich is what a lot of these artists\nhave done yeah you've like you just said\nyou grow up on the road sure and then\nall of a sudden you're like well who am\nI and who are my friends and what is my\nlife and now everyone that I pay is my\nfriend and that's the only friends I\nhave totally you know and so it's really\ninteresting how when you get a little\nglimpse into someone's life and then on\nmy the last show I had was in Barcelona\nyeah it was amazing the night before my\nour show Live Nation who is doing my\nshow there they also do uh Coldplay's\ntour and they were like do you want to\ncome to cold watch Coldplay I'd love to\nwatch Coldplay so when the night before\nto watch Coldplay it's unbelievable they\ndid four sold out shows of 65 000 people\neach night in Barcelona and Chris I went\ntowards the fourth night and Chris\nMartin and the crew were just\nunbelievable yeah and then I found out\nas the 89th show and I was thinking gosh\nlike it is so hard like it's just so\nhard and all their families are with\nthem and traveling with them and all the\nrest of it and so I want to touch on\nthat with you as well that walk us\nthrough because\nI've talked about this with actors\noffline and I don't think I've fully\ndone it online and so if you're willing\nto go there I'd really appreciate it\nsure when you're playing a role I think\nas a viewer we massively underestimate\nhow hard acting is especially when the\nrole is the kind of role that you're\nplaying in the crowded room yeah I think\nwe just underestimate as a viewer and\nI'm fortunate enough to know enough\nactors offline where I've had these\nconversations before whether whether\nit's people who do method acting or\nwhether it's people who you know really\ntry and get into character like you\nalways hear about the stories of like\nhow Jared Leto when he was becoming the\nJoker was sending people rats and human\nfeces in their mail like literally like\nwhat if you send me human faces in my\nmail there'd be troubled I wouldn't be\nputting up with that you you and Jared\nLeto in a boxing match yeah there'll be\na boxing movie then yeah but but you\nknow that idea of like I think I think\nas viewers we don't re it's what I'm\nsaying is like when I went on tour I was\nlike I get it I get it now as viewers we\ndon't get it because we don't really\nhear about the Deep process that actors\ngo through of getting into a role\nplaying someone with\nmultiple personalities like you know\nthat I don't know is that is that tough\nor is it actually or is that not as am I\ngetting it wrong and that's not actually\nthe tough part you're definitely not\ngetting it wrong I think it's just\ndifferent it's Case by case you know\nthere are people like Jared who dive\ninto their roles and they do things like\nsending people dead rats and stuff like\nthat and they think that that's what\nthey need to do I've always been really\ngood at separating my onset emotions\nfrom my personal life emotions\nas a young kid I used to really heavily\nrely on my personal emotions to get them\nto come across on screen and I just\nfound it really unhealthy I just found\nthat like the line between my life and\nmy character's life would be blurred and\nultimately at the end of the experience\nof making the film I would be a very\ndifferent person but not because of my\nexperiences as Tom it would be because\nof my experiences as my character so I\ndecided very early on to\nfind certain techniques and certain ways\nto get into those emotions from a sort\nof technical point of view I never sit\non set and think about my my mum getting\nsick or my or never speaking to my\nbrothers again or something like that I\nnever blur the lines with my personal\nlife and my work life I always leave\nwork at work there are jobs like the\ncrowded room that are particularly\ntaxing getting to those emotions on a\ndaily basis is really difficult and\nreally tiring\nbut you know it's probably somewhat like\nColdplay on their 89th show you just dig\nyour heels in you realize you've got a\njob to do we're all wonderfully well\npaid there are people that work far\nharder for far less I recognize how\nlucky I am so I'm like if I need to cry\ntoday and tomorrow and the next 50 days\nin a row I'll do so yes it's difficult\nbut\nI think your question I'm probably the\nworst person to ask that because I think\nI have like a really healthy outlook on\nhow I achieve my emotions on set yeah um\nbut I have worked with people that\nshut their bedroom door and just dive\ninto the character and are pouring\nthrough the script every night and and\nare in character all the time and I\nadmire them I don't necessarily think\nit's the healthiest way to go about it\nbut yeah I've always been really strict\non myself to leave my work at work\nobviously I come home and read the\nscript and do all of my prep work but\nI'm not I'm leaving the character at\nwork because it's too it's too much\nespecially when you're playing a\ncharacter like like Danny from the\ncrowded room like you can't bring that\ninto your personal life\nit's tough yeah yeah I mean that but I'm\nactually glad I asked it to you either\nway because what I'm actually hearing is\nyou did it early on and you saw it\nwasn't healthy sure and so you actually\nfound another way yeah and and it's\nreally interesting because a lot of\npeople may not have found another way or\nthat is their way and that is their\nmethod and so it actually is interesting\nhearing it from your perspective because\nyou're actually saying yeah I could have\ngone down that road sure I could see the\ndangers with it right and and obviously\nit depends on the roles too sorry you're\ngonna no it's just it's my acting coach\nBen Perkins was my acting coach on my\nfirst film\nand that film's really really\nemotionally intense and we started off\nby doing things like can you imagine you\nknow your mum passing or can you imagine\nthings like that and I would cry\ninstantly yeah and he was the one that\nactually recognized at a point this is\ntoo much for this young kid to kind of\ntake so he devised these exercises where\nhim and I could kind of have these fake\narguments where I was as a 12 year old\noh maybe I was older than that 13 year\nold could recognize that they were\nexercises and I would allow the emotion\nto kind of come from these kind of\nacting techniques let's call it so it\nwas actually Ben that was the one that\nswitched my my mindset I can't take\ncredit for that yeah so you you live in\nL.A yeah so I moved to\nLa five years ago yeah and I moved to\nthe state seven years ago so I was in\nNew York for the first two whereabouts\nin New York were you I was on 23rd\nStreet near Flatiron okay nice so yeah\nit was good in in Manhattan and uh moved\nwith my wife we were married for seven\nyears together for ten fantastic and uh\nyeah it was it's just been really\ninteresting mate it's like did you ever\nend up moving did you ever live in L.A\nor at all or in the US at all or have\nyou always been in London so I thought\nwe were talking about earlier I've kind\nof lived all over the place I've lived\nin L.A I've lived in New York I've lived\nin Atlanta you know I've lived in\nCleveland which was amazing\num so I I really like spending time in\nthe states yeah we just obviously\ncreated a room we did a year in New York\nyeah we moved to drive Echo we started\noff in Midtown and Midtown for me was a\nbit of a nightmare it's all the schools\nare so I'd come home from work and I'd\ncome outside and it's like all the\nbiggest Spider-Man fans you've ever seen\nin your life yeah it's like the worst\nplace all the kids we moved out to\nTribeca to this amazing apartment which\nwas really lovely we're very lucky to be\ndown there but um\nbut where so how do you find La I so you\nknow it's really interesting because\nwhen I I moved to New York first yeah\nand I loved it I found New York to be\njust a big uh crazier London sure a bit\nmore intense yeah yeah and I love London\nI'm a London boy through and through I\nwent to University here my family's\nstill here my wife's family is here\neveryone's amazing and so but but I\nenjoyed New York my wife didn't love New\nYork and\nalso at the same time I I started\nspending more time in LA for work and my\nwife and I just like fell more in love\nwith each other when we were there and\nso that's what it was that Drew us there\nit wasn't really everyone's almost like\noh I was it career I was like sure to be\nhonest we went there for a month for\nwork and we rented an apartment because\nwe're going to be there for a month and\nwe're living together there and we just\nloved living with each other there home\nas well at heart yeah exactly and so we\nwere like all right we love it here why\ndon't we pack our bags and move across\nand so we went back to New York two\nmonths later we moved over to L.A so it\nwasn't even you know and now we've been\nthere for five years and the truth is\nthat I I was really intentional when I\nmoved somewhere so while I'm building my\npurpose and my work and my career which\nI absolutely love what I get to do every\nday and I I could never have dreamed of\ndoing what I do to them super grateful\nbut at the same time I was really\nintentional about building community and\nfamily and it was like an actual like\nthought process sure where I was like as\nwell as you're always building the\npeople you know at work you're always\nbuilding relationships your high hiring\nemployees and team members and\neverything at the same time I've got to\nthink about actually making friendships\nbecause in London I got all my mates so\nI got my best man at my wedding I've\nbeen mates with rods for like 17 years\nlike I've got people around me but in La\nI don't have that I don't have any\nfamily any friends I don't know anyone\nand so I really made an effort and now\nafter five years I can honestly say you\nknow obviously not in a wonderful way\nbut the pandemic did help deepen some of\nthose friendships because I was stuck\nwith those people just like only could\ngo deeper made some really good friends\nnice and so I feel happy there and I\nfeel really connected to my purpose\nthere and at the same time I love coming\nback to London right and hanging out\nwith my mates and so I've and me and my\nwife made a decision when we moved that\nwe would never say we lived anywhere we\nwere just be allowed to go wherever we\nwanted to go so whenever my wife misses\nLondon she's back on a flight to London\nright she'll come live here for two\nmonths and come back whenever she wants\namazing and it's the same for me and\nthat kind of like not having a rule\naround you know obviously we're lucky to\nhave that sure that's an amazing luxury\nto have yeah of course yeah and but yeah\nI I I share the same kind of outlook on\nit you know I couldn't really say I live\nanywhere I sort of live where the work\nis and when I'm not working I'm either\nhere or in La yeah and uh and I'm so\nlucky to be able to sort of call the\nworld my home I just go wherever the\nwind takes me yeah yeah exactly but\nthat's glorious man yeah man yeah it's\nbeen good it's been good for me it's\nbeen good to me and and I think because\nof the work I do it very clearly lets\npeople know whether I'd connect them or\nnot I feel like my work is so obviously\nOne Way sure that it's very easy because\nnot everyone wants this in their life so\nit's kind of easy for people to be like\nno I'm not going to make any effort yet\nwe're not gonna make lots of effort\nagain so it kind of makes it very easy\nbecause my work is me do you find\nbecause of what you do and your skill\nset and your experiences and your life\nas a monk that people unload on you a\nlot yes like you might meet a new person\nand they're sort of saying well I'm\nfeeling this way and I would love to try\nand get to a place of Enlightenment like\nthat must happen to you a lot yes yeah a\nlot it can it can happen at the train\nstation driving on a plane it can happen\nanywhere in the world yeah and do you\nwelcome those conversations do you like\nhaving those sorts of conversations so I\nthink it depends where we are sure and\nand it depends who it is and I always\nsay to people as a disclaimer that I\ndon't want to give you the belief\nthat I can solve your life in 30 seconds\nyeah right all that I could ever solve\nyour life for you totally just to be\nreally clear that and I always say that\nto people because people are like Jay\ntell me what I need to do and I'll be\nlike look I just wanted to be fully\naware that I'm happy to share some\ninsights with you but I don't have the\npower or gift or magical ability right\nright to transform your life and nothing\nI can say in 30 seconds I don't even\nwant to take that responsibility on\nbecause\nwe should really think about this like\nyou should reflect on your life like\nespecially when people are making big\ndecisions where it's like Jay should I\nbreak up should I move country should I\ndo this and I'm like we're not solving\nthis in 30 seconds this is a bigger\nconversation yeah and I like people that\ntakes the pressure off me but it also\ntakes the pressure off them yeah because\na lot it's not even about me this is\nabout the fact that that person needs to\nmake a really important decision and\nthey're putting all the pressure of\ntheir life on that moment and actually\nI'm saying well let's just take it off\nand here's a few things I want you to\nreflect and think about sure and I know\nthat will help you and you'll figure it\nout and so yeah I welcome them because I\nappreciate that I don't feel that I'm\nthe one holding space and I don't\nbelieve that I'm the one who has the\npower to hold space I believe that the\nUniverse holds space I believe that\nenergetically that space is held for\nothers and I don't feel I'm this\npowerful human being who's\nwho's the one that everything rests on\nsure and has the answer to everything\nand I think that's what allows me to be\nliberated from it yeah or I'm not like I\nalso don't put the pressure on myself\ngoing God I better say the most perfect\nthing for this I better change this\nperson's life yeah and I can't and I\ndon't and I think once upon a time I\nprobably did feel that way like when\nyou're when you're immature and you're\nan amateur in your work you almost feel\nlike you have to have all the answers\nand I'm like you know what I don't and\nit's fine and actually people really\nappreciate it or you just chat to them\nand yeah you know and so yeah and and\nagain you know I'm always happy to\nlisten to someone when I can obviously\nthere's sometimes when I'm like rushing\nlate for a plane or yeah yeah\nI mean I can't I can't do it sure but I\nalways stop and say hello give someone a\nhug and other questions yeah so I don't\nhave answers your questions but no\nabsolutely it does yeah I guess what's\ninteresting what you're saying about\nmaking decisions something that I am\nconstantly battling with myself is the\ninner battle between my gut and my brain\nI know that sounds really weird no like\nit's real I go with my gut a lot I'm\nvery very very I think a lot of the\ndecisions I make in life are very sort\nof instinctual I don't like to be\nbombarded with evidence and facts and\nall that sort of stuff I just like to\nfeel a certain way about how I would\nlike something to sort of transpire can\nbe taking a film accepting a script\ndoing a business deal buying a house\nlike it's all sorts of different things\nthrough your monk life did you feel like\nyou would rely on your kind of inner\ninstincts rather than like getting the\nevidence of this is going to make you\nthis much money or if you do that these\nare the risks how do you where do you\nstand with that sort of thing that's the\nmost poorly worded question but you know\nwhat I mean no no no mate I think both I\nthink this has been such a conversation\nthat that is what a question sounds like\nin a conversation right and I've I think\nI've asked you fairly poorly worded\nquestions today as well but I think\nthat's what real Communications yeah\nyeah rather than like me I've got\nquestion one like right uh but no I I\nthink I get what you're saying and if I\ngo on the wrong track let me know but\nliving is among you're trained to\nunderstand that everything exists in a\ncertain mode and so I'll explain what\nthat means and so in the monk philosophy\nthere are three modes and the modes are\nthe mode of ignorance the mode of\npassion and the mode of goodness and\nit's said that every decision every\nthought every action every intention\nevery relationship can be in the mode of\nignorance mode of passion or motor\ngoodness and the mode of ignorance is\nwhere your relationships or any Act is\nbased on insecurity or fear so when\nyou're doing something out of fear or\nyou're doing it out of insecurity or\ndoing out of pressure that's considered\nthe mode of ignorance and energetically\nwe all feel that right like you know\nwhether you be I would know whether you\nwere being forced to do this interview\ntoday sure out of out of some sort of\nfear or some sort of whatever it may be\nthe mode of passion is where you're\ndoing something because you want a\ncertain result you're doing it just for\nthe reward you're doing it just because\nit's gonna get you what you want it's\ngonna get you to the goal okay and so\nthat's considered the mode of passion\nand again energetically you can tell\nthat when someone has an agenda or right\nsomeone wants something out of you I've\ncome here to get my point across on\nsomething or right totally and then\nfinally the mode of goodness is the\nenergy of like I feel really at peace\nI feel really at ease this feels aligned\nwith my values and therefore it feels\nlike the right decision and so we were\ntrained to sense energetically whether\nthings felt like the mode of ignorance\nmother passion or more goodness which\nwas a really helpful framework because\nsometimes things were really hard to\njust sense without knowing where it's at\nin terms of a characteristic that's so\ninteresting and so that was really\nreally helpful at the time and so I find\nthat I'm I'm the same as you where I\nmake decisions energetically yeah but I\nthink having moved into the real world\nagain I felt that I had to start getting\nused to understanding other elements\nkind of what you mentioned earlier which\nI loved which was like I wish they had a\nclass on life at school because it's\nlike you haven't paid your bill and you\nknow you you know there's football\nplayers not paying their taxes or\nwhatever it may be in like uh that may\nbe for different reasons but anyway you\nget the point yeah there's some things\nthat you just don't know and so what\nI've started to do and I've I've said\nthis a few times and that's where it's a\nlittle formula that I use when I sit\ndown with someone whether it's business\nwhether it's relationships whether it's\nwork even whether it's this the first\nthing is always energy that's my first\ngate that I that I want to get through\nand if I don't feel energetically\naligned with someone then already\nthere's no future here like it's not\ngoing really well and then the next\nthing I look at is strategically if it's\nbusiness so if it's personal it's only\nenergy but if it's business I look at\nwell I like this person energetically do\nI think they're strategically aligned\nwith where this has to go like do I\nthink they can actually implement this\ndo I believe because a lot of people\nhave great energy but sure they don't\nknow how to implement anything yeah and\nthen finally I look at well does the\nmoney align does the monetary value\nalign with the energy and strategy sure\nthat's been my business version of what\nI love learned as among so what you're\nsaying then that is a combination of\nboth correct allowing like your gut your\nenergy\nto kind of allow yourself to pursue\nfurther the opportunity yeah and then\nyou take a sort of mental look at it to\nbe like I'm accepting the opportunity\nfrom a emotional point of view now I\nneed to see if it makes sort of logical\nsense correct and if it doesn't then\nwe're going to stop there again right\nright yeah exactly so I've I've found\nthat more useful for me because I found\nthat energetically I can get excited\nabout a lot of stuff yeah and the same\nyeah and I'm and I'm that kind of person\nand again I never want to block that\nsure at the same time I think\nwe have to become more selective with\nour opportunities and know when to say\nno and know how to manage stuff and\nthat's at least helped me sure so again\nI'm not saying anyone has to live like\nthat I'm just no it's interesting it's\nreally interesting I am very much like\ngo off my gut yeah I tell you what my\nmum\nis an unbelievable judge of character\nwow and I think she might have without\nknowing what you're talking about where\nshe can pick up on people's energies\nyeah because we can meet a new person as\na family we've met this new person the\nthree of us could love this new person\nand another three could not like this\nnew person and my mom will be like no no\ndon't like that person and then within\nsix months all of us like to remember\nthat person that we were really good\nfriends with for a little bit she's\nreally got a Keen Eye for people that we\nwould get along with yeah she's amazing\nlike that mums are like that now that\nyou say that all my mates who let me\ndown when I was a teenager but your mom\ncould have pointed out yeah every time\nand I was like Mom no they're my best\nfriend I'm never gonna leave them\nthey're like a brother to me and then\nlike seven months later the person\nstabbed you in the back and then you're\nlike oh yeah like you know but the good\nthing about mums is they wouldn't judge\nyou for it yeah you know they're like\nlook I told you but you have to make\nyour own yeah yeah exactly exactly but I\nit's interesting that you've been able\nto hold on to that and I love that do\nyou feel like you were asking me about\nmoving to LA and I I think what have you\nfelt and there's a part of you that's\nobviously wanting to be back in Kingston\nbe back too sure have you felt that\nthere's been parts of yourself that have\nbeen challenged I don't feel sitting\nwith you today that\nyou know I I don't know you before I\ndon't know you after I've only met you\ntoday so I I can't judge who you are or\nwhat you enjoy all I can say is that\nwhen I'm sitting with you today I feel\nlike I'm sitting with an authentic\nindividual and your energy comes across\nvery easily thank you do you feel like\nyou've had to hold on to that at times\nwith opportunities challenges the\nindustry or or is that all stuff that we\nkind of make up in our heads and it's\nactually just be yourself and you're\nfine I really don't know the answer to\nthat question I I I've definitely walked\naway from a lot and I think had I not\nwalked away from certain situations\nlet's just put it at that I would be a\nvery different person today I've been\nreally good at keeping in touch with my\nfriends keeping my family close\nlistening to the lessons\nnot getting caught up in the Hollywood\nhype like I really am a massive fan of\nmaking movies but I really do not like\nHollywood it is not for me that the\nbusiness really scares me I understand\nthat I'm a part of that business and I\nenjoy my kind of interactions with it\nbut that said\nI am always looking for ways to kind of\nremove myself from it to kind of just\nlive as normal a life as possible today\ndoing this is a very rare thing for me\nto do like in London to come in and\nspeak to someone about my life is\nsomething I would not typically do but\nbecause I'm a fan of yours and I was\nKeen to kind of hear what you had to say\nand chat to you today I felt\nlike this would be a safe space for me\nto do that\num but yeah I definitely think it has\nbeen an ongoing thought\nwhich is Don't Lose Yourself I've seen\nso many people come before me and lose\nthemselves and I've had friends that\nI've grown up with that aren't friends\nof mine anymore because they've lost\nthemselves to this business and I just\nam really really Keen to focus on what\nmakes me happy which is my family it's\nmy friends it's my carpentry my golf\num the charity that my mum runs like\nthat is the stuff that makes me really\nhappy and that's the stuff that I should\nprotect my relationship is the thing\nthat I keep most sacred I don't talk\nabout it\nI try my best to keep it as private as\npossible we both feel very strongly that\nthat is the healthiest way for us to to\nmove on as a couple\num so I do try to keep as removed from\nit as possible like you'll never see me\nat an award show that I don't have to be\nat I'm never going to a red carpet event\nthat I'm not in the film of you know I\ndon't want the attention when I don't\nneed it I love the spotlight I love the\npressure that comes with it just watch\nthat tennis documentary breaking point I\nhaven't seen it yet you've got to see it\nit's amazing I never realized how brutal\ntennis was I've always been a huge\ntennis lover I am now absolutely in awe\nof what those athletes go through\nbut there's a quote from Billie Jean\nKing that's on the\num\nstand at her Stadium in New York that\nsays pressure is a privilege and that is\nso true like oh my God feeling pressure\non a daily basis in the capacity that we\nfeel is such a privilege I love feeling\npressure I feel like I thrive Under\nPressure the best golf I've ever played\nin my life is when there are cameras\naround and people are watching I just\nthink that that is a real amazing thing\nto be able to experience so I enjoy it\nwhile I can and then when it becomes a\nbit much I kind of become a bit of a\nrecluse and I disappear I come back to\nKingston I play golf I play tennis I\nhang out with my friends and my family\ndo the pub quiz and and all that sort of\nstuff yeah um so yeah so it is something\nI actively try to do as I get older it\nonly gets easier yeah yeah absolutely\nyeah and I I can I can relate to that\nwhere in in my in my small way or in my\nworld where a lot of my friends think\nlike I'm in a Layla always at events\nalways applies I'm not I'm like in bed\nby 9 30 p.m right and I only live there\nbecause it works for me in in the world\nthat I do and what I do and sure and and\nI enjoy living in LA but it's it I don't\nlive there for Hollywood and I think\nthat's often the perception as well it\nwas like oh you're all Hollywood now and\nI'm like well no not really like I I\ndon't re I don't really go to all the\nevents and Gatherings and stuff unless I\nneed to be there or sure I'm connected\nto a project so so I relate to that what\nyou mentioned a few things there but if\nI had to ask you is Tom when do you feel\nmost to yourself like when do you feel\nmost connected or and what are you\ntrying to reconnect to if you're like\nwell I know what it is but I'm still\nfiguring it out again I think what I\nfeel most myself is to do with my\nrelationships I'm going to leave that\nand not talk about that absolutely but I\nthink the other thing and this is such a\nstupid thing but it's when I'm playing\ngood golf like there's something about\nhow golf is the most humbling sport in\nthe world who you are doesn't matter how\nmuch money you've got how successful you\nare\ngolf will batter you no matter who you\nare and I love that's what I love about\nit you know it's such a leveling sport\nI love going to a golf course and\nmeeting new people that I've never\nplayed with before playing around a golf\nI struggle when I don't play badly like\nI've got a bit of a temper and like\nyou're supposed to have 14 clubs in your\nbag I currently have nine and you can\nprobably guess why\num but I\nI just love being outside I've always\nbeen an outdoorsy person\nI love being on the golf course I love\nmy mates they all love playing golf\nthere's just something about the\nchallenge of shooting lower than your\nlowest score that really\nkind of takes my mind off of the work\nthe interesting thing about golf is that\nyou could be having a terrible day you\ncould be really upset about something\nand if you play really well you\ncompletely forget about it if you play\nreally badly you then are playing badly\nbecause of what's happening outside of\ngolf it's like a really weird kind of\nCatch-22 I guess yeah um but I love it I\nthink when I'm playing good golf is when\nI feel most like myself yeah wow that's\nthat's a that's a unique answer but I\nget it yeah yeah I've only ever played\ngolf like twice in my life right and I\ntotally get the point of how humbling it\nis is horrendous no matter how quickly\nyou pick up other things in life golf is\nnot one of those things that you pick up\nthat easily oh man you can sign the\nbiggest deal of your life and go out to\nplay golf to celebrate and it'll ruin\nyour day like absolutely rude don't go\nto play golf to sell them no never gonna\ncelebrate no crazy do you play do you\nstill play any sport I love playing\nfootball when I'm back here okay so\nthat's one of the things my mates know\nthat when I'm back in London okay we're\ngonna play a game where do you play well\nwe'll just we we're just playing like a\nseven aside pitch with a five-side pitch\nlike close to Northwest London which is\nwhere most my mates are so like stanmore\nedgware Watford that's like where all my\nmen mates are and so we'll just go rent\na pitch kick a ball about I'm not any\ngood anymore sure but I still got the\nfull kit and the size yeah I always look\ndressed up I've actually got Neymar's\nkit like from him oh wow so you best\nbelieve I'll show up to five aside in\nhis full kick I love it I love it\nwe went on a Lads holiday to Portugal\nrecently to play golf and at the resort\nwe were staying at the the people were\nso nice they said let's have an England\nversus Portugal football match there was\nlike I think there's eight of us and\nthere was a bunch of Brits that were\nworking at the resort so they kind of\njoined our team and we literally did\nEngland versus Portugal it's a full-size\npitch\nwe did 60 Minutes 30 minutes each way\nI'm fit I train every day I absolutely\nlove my fitness I really really like I'm\ninto it by the end I could not make Five\nPaces without my legs cramping up they\nare so fit these football players it's\nunbelievable and we won and it's so\nfunny how the first 10 minutes of the\ngame was really friendly like soft fouls\nsorry mate like your free kick and by\nthe end it was Savage it was really\nintense wow at least you won there we\nwon I got an assist it's actually a\nglorious assist as well actually I just\nI pinged the ball over the top my\nbrother made a run and it bounced and he\nmanaged to get his foot to it and he\nchipped The Keeper in school it was but\nthere's no footage there's no footage\nyeah no proof yeah no proof I sometimes\nthink when the whole no-proof thing like\nwe had the craziest experience of my\nlife the other day I'll tell you about\nit\nbecause our lives are so crazy like\nthere's no why would I lie but the other\nday we went swimming with killer whales\nin Mexico I said the other day it was\nlast year\nand it was one of the most humbling\nexperiences of my life there's no proof\nof it there's no evidence because it was\nso off the cuff we weren't planning on\ndoing it so most people I tell are like\nyou definitely didn't do that but we we\nwere in we were in Mexico and we were on\na boat and we just so happened to see\nthis pot of orca\nJack my security guard thought it'd be a\ngood idea to jump in he jumped straight\nin flippers on goggles on and we were\ndriving to keep up with the whales\nbecause they were kind of following our\nboat so by the time Jack had jumped in\nhe was like this he was like 100 meters\naway and you could see him and the\nwhales were like swimming around him\nso I'm starting to freak out because\nhe's a good friend of mine and he's just\nsecuring yeah and he's my security I'm\nlike Jack we gotta get back to the hotel\nbro\num so I said to the guy like excuse me\nsir can you turn around and go and get\nmy friend because we now can't see him\nanymore like he's gone we found him we\ngot him back in the boat and he sort of\nsaid like Lads you have to get in there\nit's unlike anything you've ever seen\nbefore my brother Harry's like Googling\nwhether or not it's safe to swim with\nthem and it's sort of the general\nconsensus online is don't go swimming\nwith killer whales you can there's never\nbeen a recorded attack in the wild\nbut they are wild animals as big as a\nbus and also Jack's giving it like don't\nworry Tom I'll be there I'll look after\nyou I'm like Jack what are you gonna do\nbro like what's this whale decides to\neat me so anyway we put the flippers on\nput the goggles on we find the whales\nthey're sort of interacting with the\nback of the boat they're clearly curious\nand I just thought like I guess it goes\nback to what you're saying the mode of\nignorance I just was like I'm gonna try\nit see what happens I jumped in my\nbrother jumped in Jack jumped in we kind\nof came together with 30 miles out of\nthe coast so it's literally like dark\nblue water nothing below us and to my\nrelief the whales had gone we couldn't\nsee them\nso I'm sort of thinking oh well that's\nactually a bit of a touch at least I can\nsay I jumped in and they have gone but\nthen Jack said look down and we look\ndown and it came from beneath us\nand what has been such an interesting\nexperience for me was as soon as I saw\nthe whale I wasn't scared anymore\nbecause I could just tell\nthat it wasn't going to eat me you I\ndon't know I don't know how to explain\nit but you could just see from its body\nlanguage I remember it so vividly it\nswam up to us it was maybe\n10 meters below us and it was kind of\nmotionlessly sort of just looking at us\nand then it kind of rolled on its back\nit did this weird thing where it kind of\nput its head like this and you could see\nits eye like we were having this crazy\nlike moment and then it just swam off\nand it was gone\nand then for three hours afterwards I\ncouldn't speak I had the biggest\nadrenaline dump I just basically was\nasleep but it was such an amazing\nexperience to sort of meet the apex\npredator of the world and it kind of\nlook at you and just swim away most\npeople don't believe me because I\nbelieve you there's no evidence but it\nwas I think about it now and then you\nknow it's so funny as well I see these\nice like our planet there's there's more\nfootage of orcas hunting and another way\nin which they hunt there is no way I\nwould do that again yeah there's no way\nI'd get in there again but yeah it was\namazing hearing you explain it is like\nyou're so present yeah that you can tell\nthat you just you were so present in\nthat moment like you stopped thinking\nabout like oh well you know if I tell\nthis Afters and no one's gonna believe\nme or whatever it is you're just like\nwait a minute yeah you know nature makes\nyou present like that and that's what I\nlove about nature is it's completely\nunbiased as well like if that whale\nwanted to have a snack then you know\nit's not looking at you going oh no but\nthat's a famous person and I've got to\nleave him alone or it just you are at\none with Mother Nature we're in the\nmiddle of the ocean there's nothing we\ncould do and we just were able to enjoy\nsomewhat maybe like being in the cave\nlike you were saying it was just about\nus and this whale my brother and I were\nholding hands but then as soon as it\npresented itself to us any stress just\ndissipated yeah and it was just this\nunbelievable experience and it was so\nleveling it was so humbling that it\nmakes me feel like I can take on certain\nthings\nso is it honestly even thinking about\nthe experience down my heart is racing\nyeah I can imagine yeah it was it was\nwild yeah it was a coolness unbelievable\nthat's that's an incredible experience\nand it is different from the cave though\nbecause I do think it's it's different\nwhen you're with another living being\nsure and so that's what I found like my\nmy closest experience to what you're\ntalking about is I went trekking with\nwell looking for mountain gorilla in\nRwanda last night oh that's have you\nbeen on top of my list I would love to\nokay yeah we we should do it I would do\nthat again any day because it was\nunbelievable so you're not again these\ngorillas are not like in a park or\nsomething no no they're mountain gorilla\nthey're in their world and you go and\nlook for them and there's no tagging\ndevices or any Tech there's people\nwho've watched the gorilla for so many\nyears that they know where their\ndroppings are they know where families\nhang out they know what their routines\nare so depending on what time you're\ngoing out there's someone who's just\naround them who's calling their friend\nuh calling your guide saying walk this\nthis is where you've got to go exactly\njust just to make it very very clear\nthat you know among the gorilla is being\ntreated very well uh so you're literally\nlooking around and you could be on the\nlookout for them for like two to six\nhours wow you may not find them you're\njust hiking see I love that yeah you\nmight not find it you might not find\nthem so we found them in two hours one\ngroup that we heard about because you go\nin smaller groups of like 10. the other\ngroup that we're friends with they took\neight hours to find gorillas but they\nsaw them too and when I went I was kind\nof like oh we're gonna see one gorilla\nwhatever like they're gonna be far away\nlike I was a bit skeptical because I\ndidn't know how it was going to be and\nit was incredible because we looked\naround for two hours and I'll show you\nthe video afterwards but we got and we\njust saw them like hanging out kind of\nlike oh I'm looking at everyone here\njust hanging out still and then all of a\nsudden they all started walking together\nand there was a family of 20 gorillas\nwow it's got two silver backs that are\nlike you know they're like they're fists\nare like you know they're just huge yeah\nexactly and and it was really\ninteresting because the guides who were\nthere with us they said to us that when\nyou go most of them kind of like and\nthis is why I remembered it and why I'm\ntelling you it's because when you were\ntalking about the way the whale looked\nat you and it was kind of like you knew\nit wasn't going to eat you yeah yeah and\ntoday we're saying that when you get\nclose to these gorillas the only thing\nyou can't do is you can't touch their\nkids and you can't touch them yeah so\nyou can't drop something near their kids\nand then try to get it back because\nthey'll think you're trying to harm\ntheir kids but what they recommended was\nthey said you had to make this sound\nwhen you see them and this sound means\nwe come in peace and so the sound was\nwe'll play around with it\nyeah and so I'm walking around so we go\nto the gorilla and we get close to them\nand I made that sound because we were\ntold they will make that sound and then\nthe gorilla did it back and it was just\nunbelievable and then there was this one\nmoment where we were walking and we were\nliterally surrounded by Gorilla now I\nwas getting it and that's when I was\nlike a bit scared because they were like\nall around us and like literally if they\nran at you like I'm done yeah you know\nnothing you can do nothing nothing you\ncan do and so we're walking they're\nwalking around us and this massive\nSilverback came up so I'm uh my business\nmanager was with me as well and so he's\nthere he's like my godfather in L.A like\nhe really takes care of me so very close\nto him and so this big um this big\ngorilla that walks behind him and I'm\nlooking at him going oh man like he\nstopped and we're all looking at him\nbecause he's got this massive silver\nback behind him and I'm and we're all\nlike how do we tell him to move and the\nguy's like just be still like just you\nknow be really present like you can't\nfreak out and the gorilla just went\nwow behind him\nway and just walk fast wow and it was\njust it was that same presence that\nyou're feeling that I felt with them and\nthat's what I mean the living being with\nanother living being is is spectacular\nso do you think that level of ease comes\nfrom the helpless nature of being in the\npresence of an animal that could do to\nyou whatever they want to like I think\npart of the reason why I felt so calm\nwhen the whale had come up was because\nthere was nothing we could do\nshould it go sideways yeah and I think\nbeing almost finding that kind of inner\npiece of like I've made my mind this is\nthe choices I've made I'm here now\nthere's nothing I can do\nit's almost like you should make peace\nwith your choices I guess yeah I don't\nknow no no no I think that's I think\nyou've actually taken it somewhere\nreally beautiful mate I I think for me\nas well it's humility yeah that's what\nand like when you when you meet someone\nnew rarely are we humble sure we we\noften feel the pressure to be like well\nlook at who I am you know or we're\ntrying to create even if it's not out of\nego there's a certain sense of like\nwanting to gain people's like and\nrespect yeah whereas your last people no\nmatter what I do this whale or gorilla\nis not going to like or respect me sure\nso I better just be humble about it yeah\nand at peace as you said and it levels\nyou and it levels you and it and it\nallows that human being that that being\nalso of course it's not you know of\ncourse we're not record there's no we're\nnot recommending that you just go into\nthese places oh yeah yeah but the idea\nbeing that I do think there's something\nmagical about nature where humility is\nkind of Nature's Way and it is that what\nyou're saying that when you're at peace\nwith your choices and you're at peace\nwith here we are here I am I can't do\nanything and guess what it's okay right\nthat's what I'm saying yeah yeah it's\nsomewhat sort of like I've made a\ndecision if the decision is a mistake\nyou've got to live with it because you\nmade it yes I want to talk about um\nSports because I was thinking so I I\nplay a lot of tennis play a lot of\nfootball love it I play a lot of\npickleball now you play because guys\nthat's have become a theme yeah but I'm\nmassively more into paddle I don't know\nif you've ever I love paddle time I love\npaddles so I found that to blow up in\nthe US but it's not going to so when I\nwent to Dubai and I went to Miami and I\nwent to Madrid because they're big in\nSpain mate are they playing it here yeah\nmy local Tennis Club has got two courts\nno like you can't book them they're so\nsold out all right honestly paddle\ntennis I love tennis yeah I think tennis\nis one of the best sports in the world\nyeah and I think that you know they are\nthe highest performing athletes some of\nin the world\nbut it's really hard doing this yeah\nlike I find unless I'm playing with\nsomeone who's much better than me I\ndon't play well like I really I I need\nto be chasing someone yeah paddle tennis\nis so social it's it's easy to have\ngreat rallies you still get the the uh\nthe satisfaction of really smacking a\nball because pickle is it's all about\nplacement and and trying to kind of\none-up your opponent whereas playing at\nthe kitchen and just yeah exactly yeah\nwhy is it called a kitchen I have no\nidea and I do that's so I play pickle\nlike paddle right because I'm I'm like\nno I'm in Wisconsin yeah it's like why I\ndo like pickle\num but paddle tennis that is amazing\nnext time yeah yeah paddles paddle's one\nof my favorite favorite I was in Dubai\nuh with a client for work for months a\ncouple of years back I played it every\nday for three months that's great\nexercise yeah it's the best workout the\nmost fun like time just flew is amazing\nbut I was bringing it back to sports\nbecause I was saying I was saying you\nknow you you personally tried to recruit\nand for Tottenham I did yeah and and I\njust thought that was amazing because I\nwas like I've never seen this ever\nhappen before where you know someone's\nusing their clout in the right way\nlisten I saw him I'm a mad Tottenham fan\nand I just thought now's my chance and\nhe said no the deal didn't go through no\nsigning bonus for myself\nthat was a crazy trip that going to the\nBallon d'Or yeah we were there for\nSpider-Man Spider-Man was coming out I'm\nnot really sure how that was promo for\nSpider-Man but like it was part of our\ntrip for some reason but it was amazing\nmeeting these players and and I admire\nthem so much it's incredible when you\ncan notice other athletes and other\ngreatness and I see that at the top\nwe're talking we've talked a lot today\nabout and you're really good at this\nlike you really I feel like\nI feel like you're quite tuned in to\nlike\nadmiring and observing greatness and\nlike the one percent and trying to\nfigure out what they're doing\ndifferently and I think that's one of\nthe things I've definitely seen of the\none percent is that there's a humility\nin that they have the ability to\nappreciate other people's greatness and\nskills and values and purpose like\nthey're not looking at it going I'm the\nbest of all time sure there's a part of\nthat they may have to say that for the\ncameras or they may have to say that\nbefore they go on the pitch but actually\nif you talk to them and you ask them\nabout someone else they'll be like yeah\nbest best player I've ever seen like\nthey're incredible yeah so who did you\nadmire growing up in acting who do you\nadmire today like who have been the\npeople that and maybe on a mindset level\nor maybe on a or a performance level as\nwell there are definitely performances\nof people that I look up to there are\nthere are the types of careers of\ncertain actors that I really admire\nthey're also like the the types of lives\nthat certain people lead that I really\nadmire and that I really aspire to sort\nof be like\num\nI tend to let all of my admiration go\ntowards athletes I'm just so blown away\nby what they can do Under the pressure\nthat they're under me as an actor I\nrealize that my job is a high pressure\njob because it reaches millions of\npeople but that said there are so many\npeople that help me get to where I need\nto be I get picked up someone makes me\nbreakfast someone writes the words I'm\nsupposed to say someone chooses my\ncostume someone does my hair and makeup\nsomeone sets the camera up ultimately I\nwalk onto set and I do my bit but I'm a\nsmall part in a massive machine but when\nyou look at someone like Djokovic or\nFederer or you know this new alcaraz you\nknow or the golfers or Lewis\nis slightly different because formula\none is so much about the team and the\ncar and all that sort of stuff\nthey have to do it themselves at a\ncertain point there's only so much help\nthey can get but then when they walk\nonto that court for the first time when\nthey walk into the ring or into the\noctagon it's them by themselves they're\nunder that amount of pressure it's up to\nthem whether they deliver or not and I\njust have always been admiring of\nseeing some of the greats lose their win\nstreak and come back even stronger I've\nalways really been an admirer of people\nthat are able to do that I think it's a\nFolly when you see these win streaks of\n50-0 and all that sort of stuff and\nyou're like well\nthat to me isn't what a champion is a\nchampion is someone who had it all lost\nit all and got it right back again Tyson\nFury story is a crazy one I'd love to\nsee AJ come back and be on top again\nbecause I'd love to be alive to witness\nthat Legacy that he would leave behind\nyou know I feel sorry for him what\nhappened to him when he sort of\nseem to really lose it a little bit in\nthe ring when he took the microphone and\nI'd love to see him back on top and to\nto have some clarity and and To Be A\nChampion again because I admire him as\nan athlete so I saved most of my\nadmiration for asking yes and musicians\nI love musicians I see someone like Ed\nSheeran yeah 80 000 people in the palm\nof his hand I think comedians are\nequally as talented the ability that\nthey can just go on stage and make\npeople laugh that is terrifying\nactors for me because it's what I do\nyeah yeah it's like\nyou know yeah yeah I get what you're\nsaying I get what you're saying and at\nthe end of the day it's just it's it's\ntaking what you can from from what you\nAspire for right like you you can take\nsomething from all these people right\nand what I love about it some of these\npeople you know some of these people you\ndon't but I always say to people who are\nlistening and watching that you can be\nmentored by people you've never met\nyou're right and I think that's a really\nimportant skill to gain because I think\nwe live in a world right now where\nsomewhat access has come easier and we\nalways think we need access to people\ndirectly in order to learn from them but\nyou don't know everyone you've just\nmentioned even though you may know a\ncouple of them closely and and same with\nme like I was really fortunate you know\ngrowing up as a teenager I got\nintroduced to like Martin Luther King's\nwork and Malcolm X's work and I was\nreading crazy stuff for that age but it\nhad a massive impact on my mindset I\nnever met all those people and obviously\nwould never have got the opportunity to\ndo that but I feel mentored by them yeah\nwithout ever having sat in the same room\nmiss them because you study like how\nthey made decisions and you study what\nthey said and what they wrote what they\nstood for what they stood for and how\nand and the parts that you don't hear\nthrough history the parts that were\nactually more difficult and of course\nthe parts where they weren't the perfect\nhero right and so all of that kind of\nstuff but Tom before we go to the final\nfive you've been so gracious with your\ntime today I have to ask you if if you\nwant to clarify the hurricane situation\nbecause I'll tell you what the reason\nwhy I say this is I had the dream so I'm\na Manchester United Support everyone on\nmy community knows that very well right\nuh I have always had the dream that\nHarry Kane when Wayne Rooney retired\nHarry Kane was going to come to\nManchester United Okay and he was going\nto follow in the footsteps of all the\ngreat England forwards that have played\nokay for Manchester United that didn't\nhappen no I'm still holding on to that\ndream but you want him to go somewhere\nelse well listen listen let me just\nclarify right I love Harry Kane I love\nhumans on human son is my favorite\nfootball player he is a hero I love\nTottenham I'm a big Tottenham fan but I\njust I know that those players could\nThrive and have the best careers ever\nI just want to see I want to see Harry\nlifting a trophy and I want to see son\nthere by him and and I just don't think\nyou're rooting for the individual yeah\nyeah I'll always be a Tottenham fan you\nknow I love being a Spurs fan my brother\nHarry and I you know we've really bonded\nover it but I just you know Harry Kane's\none of the best strikers in the world\nyeah and um he would fit into almost any\nteam and I'd love to see him on top yeah\nand uh interesting question do you think\nhe would have had a similar season to\nHarland had he gone to see oh oh that's\nuh\nI I personally think\nbecause I think Holland's amazing I\nthink Harland with his age his strength\nand his mentality you know what's crazy\nabout Harland is I saw this interview\nand you know obviously it hurts me to\nsay it but\nCity and all but when Harlan did this\ninterview he just scored like can't\nremember which game it was he's\nunbelievable he scored like five goals\nthat game and he was like I should have\nhad seven\nand and the interview was like come on\nthough take some credit like you scored\nfive goals and he was like yeah I'm I'm\nhappy with that but he goes you know\nthere were a couple of assists that\nshould have gone in and I thought that\nmentality yeah that's a Winner's mindset\nthat's a Winner's mindset I was like he\nwas he knew exactly which opportunities\nhe missed and I was like so I think it's\nan AIDS thing yeah it's a strength thing\nI feel like Harlan's kind of like I've\nalways compared Harlan to like Ivan\nDrago like he was made in the lab right\nright he was made like he was\nmanufactured yeah yeah this incredible\ntalent I think he's good with like he he\nadmits like he scores a lot of tap-ins\nand I think that's his game yeah but man\nthere's no he's on a scorecard you know\nnot in a good way yeah totally I'm\nsaying like he's been built in that way\nin City play that way I don't know if\nKane's a tapping guy like sure he's he's\nhis goals have generally been a bit more\ndiverse in that sense yeah magic is the\nway I'll describe Kane yeah no I love\nhim and obviously it's a typical thing\nof like the presser out saying oh Tom\nHolland's begging Kane to leave I'm not\nbegging him to leave I love that he's at\nour club because I'd be terrified to see\nwhere we'd be without him but I'd just\nlove to see him have the career I know\nhe could have yeah what do you think of\nJude Bellingham to Madrid I think that's\na great move\nI love that and what's even what's\ninteresting is that all of my friends in\nSpain are from Barcelona I have one\nfriend from Madrid I've always been a\nbig boss to support her because I used\nto go to Barcelona all the time as a kid\nI had a few weekends where I'd say to my\nmum and dad I'm going to my friend's\nhouse and I would go to Barcelona\nstraight away I got caught my mum called\nme up and was like where are you I was I\nwas trying to say I was at my friend's\nhouse she said no you're not because I'm\nhere and I was in LA ramblast in\nBarcelona\num but I just I just love players I\nthink Drew bellum's amazing and you know\nI just love to see what he could do\nthere yeah I think it's the thing for me\nis I love Legacy I love seeing what\nplayers can do I'm less about the teams\nthat's what I love about tennis or golf\nyou know it's not about the team it's\nabout the player so I would just love to\nsee what he could do there and you know\nI'm sure one day we'll see England raise\na trophy and we've got such a great\nyoung team and and um\nI admire them all but yeah I think it's\na great move for him he's only 19 or\nsomething like that it's in San Diego's\n19. and that's wild incredible he's a\nyear older than my brother Patty that's\nmental mate oh you've been amazing today\nhonestly this is yeah yeah this has been\nsome of the most fun I've had in a long\ntime yeah thank you thank you I\nappreciate it I want to ask we ask\neveryone the final five and so these are\nthe fast five questions okay which means\nanswers have to be one word to one\nsentence maximum okay no more than that\ndone okay uh and you don't have to write\nor spell them out so no no no problem\nyou'll be a long story none of that all\nright so Tom Holland these are your\nfinal five uh question one what is the\nbest advice you've ever received to turn\nyour nerves into excitement I like that\nthat we've never had done the show loved\nthat all right second question what is\nthe worst advice you've ever received\nmove to LA get a marijuana license and\nbuy a hot tub who told you that Mark\nwill work\nthat's brilliant now he told me that on\na chat show so I don't know if that was\nlegit advice but I did didn't take his\nadvice okay good who would you have been\nif you took that advice who knows yeah\nwho knows\num all right question number three\nwhat's the first thing you do every\nmorning and the last thing you do every\nnight make my bed\nit's the first thing I do and the last\nthing I do before I go to bed admittedly\nis I check my emails which I shouldn't\ndo\nbut that is what I do yeah it's bad yeah\nwe asked that just to make you aware of\nwhat you need to change I do need to\nchange that making my bed is a good\nstart I used to never do that and now\nlike my first thing I do is I make my\nbed that's on my first challenge of the\nday it's a good it's an easy one to get\ndone question four what's something\nyou're trying to learn at the moment I'm\ncurrently taking golf lessons\nand uh we see a trending it's not going\nvery well where are you at at the moment\nthing is with golf is that the golf\nswing is a very very particular\nthing so in order to get better you do\nhave to take quite a few steps backwards\nI've taken maybe 25 sets backwards but I\nwill I will benefit from it eventually\nare you doing every day every day every\nday but I practice everything I've\nalways said that to my wife I was like I\nwant to go away for a month and I want\nto get a Trader I'm going to play golf\nevery single day oh man I know great\nanyway yeah that's the only I had a\nreally so one of my clients took me to\npxg in Arizona yeah which is like this\nbeautiful place Bob Parsons place and I\nhad a coach there for two days and I was\nlike half decent after two days because\nthe coach was so good yeah right and\nwhen I got back to LA I tried to get a\ncoach and I couldn't find a good one and\nthen I had a coach that literally he\ncame highly recommended but it didn't\nwork out for me he he didn't let me take\nlike 0.7 of a swing before he gave me\nfeedback and I was like I just need to\nhit a few like I need to kind of just\nand it was like every time I was about\nto hit the Boy Bill nope sure sure I was\nlike I just need to kind of like get a\nfeel for it and so the guy I go to is a\nguy called James Heath okay and he does\nmost of his teachings off a feel so\nabout numbers it's not about\nresults it's more about how do you feel\nI he he calls it the feels so like I'm\nworking on twisting my hips more in my\nbackswing and he will say to me how does\nthat make you feel like physically where\ndo you feel the stretch where do you\nfeel the pain where do you feel the\npinch that's what I need you to feel and\nI coming from a dancer's background\nthat's a really great way for me to\nlearn because everything in dancing is\nabout feel yeah\num so if you need a great teacher in\nLondon James Heath is thank you thank\nyou shout out James yeah shout out James\nFifth and final question if you could\ncreate one law that everyone else in the\nworld had to follow\nwhat would it be um I don't know I don't\nknow what one law would solve the most\namount of problems\nwhat would you say curious I'd probably\ngo to something you said earlier if I'm\ngiving a genuine answer like a real\nanswer is I really wish there was a life\nschool I mean like I I that would be it\nbecause I'm not saying that would solve\nall the problems in the world no but it\nwould set people up and when I say life\nschool I mean emotional Mastery I mean\n100 ego master I mean the ability to be\nkind and empathetic and vulnerable and\ncompassionate and create safe spaces I\nthink a life school that taught you how\nto be non-judgmental sure and\nnon-critical of others without\nunderstanding them I think sure that's\nwhat I mean by life school so not just\nthey're like paying taxes and bills and\nstuff yeah but the Life School of like\nwell what if what if we didn't have to\nlive in a world where we just said\neverything we wanted to and did\neverything we wanted to and got away\nwith it and you know but I think life\nthe life lesson for me should be basic\nhealth and CPR and basic first aid\ntraining it should be like you said\ncreating an environment at school where\nyoung people feel more comfortable\ntalking about themselves what they're\ngoing through you know things that might\nbe happening at home or things that are\nhappening at school like I think that\nthat would be an amazing way for us\nto be more expressive and more\ncomfortable expressing and again like I\nknow I keep going back to it but it's\nabout what my show is about which is you\nshould feel empowered when asking for\nhelp it should be something that you're\nproud of like you're recognizing that\nyou have an issue it might be an\ninternal issue it might be an external\nissue but you are seeking help which I\nthink is very admirable yeah yeah\nabsolutely yeah I do encourage and\nrecommend everyone go watch the crowded\nroom I I personally loving it with my\nwife honestly like I I barely watch TV\nshows if I'm completely honest and uh\nit's because I I like something that\nmakes me think and reflect and you know\nand entertain me at the same time sure\nand I think it does a brilliant job of\ndoing all three like it's gripping I'm\nlike trying to figure out what's going\non next nice at the same time I'm like\nit's it's amazing watching you\nbeing able to be this very different\ncharacter to what we know you as sure\nand that's really impressive so even\nlike even on a performance level I'm\nlike I'm forgetting that you are\nSpider-Man nice right like and that's\nthat's how I watch movies where I'm like\ncan I forget right who this person is\nand or are they playing a caricature of\nthemselves obviously and with you I'm\nlike I don't even think to think it's\nyou right right right now I'm talking to\nyou and I've been watching the show I'm\nlike oh it's not even the same person\nsure and and that is really really\nimpressive on a performance standpoint\nso well thank you so much I really\nappreciate it yeah thank you mate thank\nyou if you love this episode you'll love\nmy interview with Kobe Bryant on how to\nbe strategic and obsessive to find your\npurpose our children have become less\nimaginative about how to problem solve\nand parents and coaches have become more\ndirective and trying to tell them how\nthey behaviors is teaching them how to\nbehave"
