great to\nhave you here man hey I am so excited to\nbe here thank you so much for having me\nbro no it's it's great to finally have\nyou here we've talked about this for a\nwhile yeah it's been a long time coming\nit's been a long time coming and I'm\nglad you're coming on now and I love how\nwe talk about people exercising their\nbodies and exercising their compassion I\nthink that idea is really beautiful and\nI can honestly say that you're one of\nthe toughest strongest guys I know but\nat the same time you're also one of the\nsweetest kindest guys I know and I think\nthat combination is really powerful but\nI want to talk about your journey today\nI want to talk about some of your\ninsights today you know we have a big\nCommunity here who wants to be healthier\nwho wants to be happier uh let's start\nwith right now like what makes you feel\nhappy and healthy right now today that's\nsuch a good question yeah I think first\nof all it just begins with waking up\nfeeling like I have purpose definitely\nwaking up tending to myself first and\nforemost my morning routine my water my\nmeditation practices all of these things\nthat have I've slowly built the practice\nof over the course of 10 15 years that\nhave now been so ingrained into the\nfabric of who I am and that is what\nreally keeps me feeling good and showing\nup for whatever the day has to throw at\nme so I mean once you find that then it\nreally does allow you to like live in\nthat that healthy space to where you can\nshow up and handle anything really yeah\nand I've seen you share some of those on\nInstagram and on social media could you\nwalk us through like what have become\nthose key principles of your morning\nroutine or evening routine that you turn\nto and and which are the ones that\nyou've developed yeah so first of all so\nwhat time I wake up uh I'm sure you've\nhad plenty of guests on the show that\ntalk about the benefits of waking up\nearly I try to wake up at the same time\nevery morning so for me that's anywhere\nlike around six o'clock and yeah I don't\nhave a alarm clock I just naturally wake\nup at that time my body's just like all\nright ready to go and then I just drink\nmy cup of water and I will find a quiet\nspace I have a little meditation station\nin my house with my red light and I'll\njust sit and just breathe and it's not\nperfect every morning this is what I\ndon't want to preach or come on here and\ntalk about is perfection I really am not\na perfect person and I want to really\nfirst and foremost make that clear\nbecause it's not perfect but the days\nthat I do show up I show up to the\ndegree that I can so sometimes that's 20\nminutes some times that's longer\nsometimes it's even five and for me that\ntone of really setting the tone for the\nrest of my day with intention with that\npiece of just tapping into whatever my\nbody needs that morning and then letting\nthat dictate how I operate for the rest\nof the day that's beautiful and what are\nthe benefits of red light for those who\ndon't know because you said you meditate\nthere with the red light what's that for\nyeah so there's there's plenty of\nbenefits behind Red Light I'm not an\nexpert in it but I believe it was\ndeveloped by NASA they have like over\n500 different scientific studies that\nshow some of the benefits I believe it's\nthe main benefit is with ATP production\nso it's the energy produced by your cell\nso it helps you rejuvenate cells and get\nrid of old damaged cells and replace\nthem with new cells so for somebody who\nwants to recover from athletic training\nit's a great way to start your day it\nalso helps with skin if if somebody has\nsome skin issues there too so and it's\nalso just nice to it provides a little\nbit of heat too so it can just like\nprovide that nice ambient Lighting in\nthe morning when it's still dark outside\nto just start your day with a little bit\nless of this like bright white light\nyeah yeah wow yeah that's cool yeah I've\nused it for I used it recently after I\nhad surgery and so oh nice yeah yeah\nthat's I was recommended to use it I was\nintrigued why someone would use it when\nthey're not I had surgery but that's\nthat's good to know uh I love that and I\nlove what you're saying about not being\nperfect right I think people often think\nthat when someone comes on a podcast or\nthey talk about something that they've\nnailed it and their life works like\nclockwork and they wake up at the same\ntime every day and they meditate for the\nsame amount of time and\nand that's amazing if if that's true for\nyou and it happens but but it really\ndoes I wanted to go backwards into your\nlife today obviously you've you know\nfamously known for being in the\ndocumentary game changers and that was\nexactly produced by James Cameron uh\nArnold Schwarzenegger Jackie Chan Lewis\nHamilton and you know people that you\nknow well as well and that's incredible\nto see how far plant-based lifestyle\nvegan lifestyle athletic ability has\ncome\nI guess my question is do you feel that\nyou at this stage before we go back\nkind of what do you feel you prove to\nyourself like when I when I read things\nlike you've never read to me and that\nyou know you don't need animal products\nto be an elite athlete is that something\nyou set out to do is that something that\nwas important to you or is that\nsomething that kind of has just happened\nin society is something that interests\npeople\nso for me personally it was never\nsomething that I had set out to do I had\nhonestly had been ashamed of being\nplant-based so I was like you mentioned\nearlier in the podcast I was raised\nvegetarian by virtue of my parents\nspiritual beliefs of which I was raised\nwith as well and one of those beliefs is\nahimsa which I'm sure you're very\nfamiliar with which is just trying to\nlive a life and not contribute to any\nunnecessary harm or suffering and try to\nlead with compassion so by virtue of\ntrying to follow that it leads me to\nmake the choice to not consume animal\nproducts and when I was raised\nvegetarian I grew up in Mississippi and\nthere weren't too many vegetarians in\nMississippi and I would constantly get\nquestioned and asked about my spiritual\nbeliefs whenever I was younger and I\ndidn't have the vernacular or the\nlanguage to really explain myself so I\ntended to become more withdrawn or just\na little bit more avoidant whenever\npeople would ask me that question and it\nreally wasn't until my later years when\nI was\nmid-20s when I leaned into that part of\nmyself and started to really Embrace and\nown my belief in being proud of that\nbelief and that's what ultimately led me\nto finding my purpose because people\nstarted to ask me once I they I started\nwinning bodybuilding competitions they\nstarted to ask me how are you doing this\nand the question that I once avoided so\nmuch about why I was vegetarian now\nbecame this really interesting topic for\npeople that wanted to learn more from it\nso I started sharing more online and\nthen just naturally fell into this place\nwhere I was teaching people which was\nreally exciting for me yeah I think so\nmany of us as kids have beliefs or\nvalues that we follow because of our\nparents and then we feel embarrassed\nabout them when we're questioned because\nthey're not all beliefs and values at\nthe time like you said we don't know how\nto explain why we do this or why we\ndon't do this often on those occasions\nsometimes as we go grow older we leave\nthose values we go the other way I know\nso many people that grew up with certain\nvalues especially when they're spiritual\nbased that kids end up going the other\nway where they're like well I don't want\nanything to do with that because it\ndoesn't even make any sense because\ntheir parents never explained to them\nwhy you do that or it's important so\nthey don't know why what do you think\nstopped you from like going the other\nway and and just like being like well no\none in Mississippi gets it so why am I\nbothering to do this as a child it's\nreally easy to understand the concept of\nnot wanting to harm an animal this is\nwhy you know most people will take their\nchildren to petting zoos and not\nslaughterhouses because kids naturally\nhave an affinity to animals and want to\nlearn from them and care for them or be\naround them and I think that just really\nstuck with me because I grew up on a cow\nfarm and I had such close proximity to\nanimals that I had such a deep\nconnection with them and I think\nfundamentally I understood that in order\nfor me to end up on my plate an animal\nwould have to suffer or be killed and I\njust didn't want to contribute with that\nI just never felt aligned in my body and\nI was doing just fine without it so I\ncontinuously heard people tell me that\nif you know I need meat to be big and\nstrong I need meat to grow up for\nprotein for all the other nutrients and\nhere I was you know fairly athletic even\nas a kid just living this experience and\nI just knew in my heart that I didn't\nneed it so I just continued to go by\nfeeling and really just stop curing what\nother people told me I needed and just\nlike really started tuning into what I\nfelt like was right for me I feel like\nthere's a lot of people who want to be\nplant-based or vegan but then they go\nback to eating meat because they're told\nthey're lacking something or they need\nsomething and often people feel it\nthemselves like they feel better when\nthey're eating me in terms of their body\neven if they don't agree with it morally\nI've met a lot of people like that\nand I guess my point is and that's what\nI'm hearing from you is everyone's so\nunique and so different\nwhat nutrients did you have to be more\nproactive to find as someone who's vegan\nand be more thoughtful about let's start\nthere first yeah so I mean the first\ntopic that most people tend to bring up\nis protein protein is an important\nnutrient that has many purposes in the\nbody including recovery including many\num just for overall health and vitality\nyou need protein I'm not denying that\nbut I think that there's a lack of\nEducation when it comes to the amount of\nprotein that plants provide so I growing\nup never really concerned myself with an\namount of protein I just ate what my\nparents would provide me with and that\nwas like lentils you know pastas things\nthat naturally contain protein but it\ndoesn't have animal protein so that is\nthe biggest\nkind of conversation that I normally\nhave on a daily basis is where do you\nget your protein from and I think it's\nimportant to realize for people\nunderstanding how much protein you\nactually need and everybody's different\nlike you said I'm not here to tell\nanybody how to live their life that's\nnot it's not my intention whatsoever I'm\nhere to just talk about my experience\nand and have the conversation with\npeople who are genuinely interested in\nlearning about this lifestyle and\npossibly feeling uh even more Vitality\nwhich is what I experience whenever I\nwent fully plant-based so protein the\nother big one is B12 so B12 is a\nmicronutrient that you know we don't\nnaturally get in our diet based off the\nsterile nature of the way that we grow\nour crops we used to get it from soil\nand streams of water so now most B12 is\nsupplemented and even given to animals\nso people that consume animal products\nare getting supplemented B12 that are\nfed to the animal so you're getting\ngetting it second hand so it's not just\na vegan issue at this point in time it's\na general population issue that people I\nbelieve up to 40 of the population has\nsub-optimal levels of B12 so\nsupplementing with that is a wise choice\njust to kind of ensure that and then the\nother ones iron I mean that's another\nbig one for anybody that has uh\npotentially anemia or anything like that\nbut there are plenty of vegetables that\nprovide more than enough iron it's just\nabout really understanding how to eat\nand consume a diverse amount of\nvegetables in your diet that will cover\nthese nutritional gaps and it all boils\ndown to education first and foremost\nyeah no and I agree with you you know\nfor me as well I don't\ndefinitely not a proponent or an\nevangelist of a certain type of\nlifestyle and you know I think everyone\nhas to make their own decisions I know\nthat I went from being vegetarian to\nbeing plant-based overnight which I\nthink I would have done differently had\nI known what I know now I think I would\nhave done things more gradually and\nbeing more aware of things like B12 and\nOmega-3s and these kind of things that\nan iron and so many other things I I\nstill would have made the decision to\nbecome a plant-based I feel far more\nenergetic today I feel far more\nuh immute my immunity is far stronger\ntoday like I feel much better being\nplant-based without a doubt I just wish\nI made my journey towards it a lot\neasier and so I'm very mindful now where\nit was like I went from there literally\nbeing vegetarian to Plum based like\nliterally overnight yeah yeah yeah\nexactly and I think there were a few\nthings that I could have avoided if if I\ndidn't do that so but with your journey\nso you grew up in Mississippi in the\nspiritual home you're\nyou're already vegetarian and I guess\nwhen you're brought up in a spiritual\nenvironment and I don't meet many people\nI don't think we've interviewed many\npeople who grew up directly in a\nspiritual environment\na what does that mean and B like how did\nthat affect your values and goals and\nAmbitions in life like how did that yeah\nso it definitely gave me perspective\nbecause the environment that I grew up\nin it was it was a faith-based community\num the the difference was that the the\nspiritual belief was very different than\nthe surrounding spiritual beliefs\nbecause we were a Hare Krishna Community\nwhich uh division of Hinduism so my\nparents actually converted from\nCatholicism to Hinduism in Argentina and\nthey are deeply spiritual people they\ndecided that they wanted to develop\ndevote them their lives to their\nspiritual practice so they\nrenounced all their possessions and they\ndecided to go live in the temple I mean\nyou have had you know that experience\nand they had my brother they had my\nsister and they bounced around South\nAmerica and then eventually was told\nabout an opportunity to come live in a\nspiritual community in south Mississippi\nand so they immigrated to the United\nStates with basically 200 in their\npockets and two and a half kids pregnant\nwith me and that's where I was born and\nraised and it was really quite unique\nbecause it was a community like I\nremember calling all of the mothers in\nthe community mother because we would go\nto the temple we would go around the\nfarm we had cows we had our own garden\neverybody had a role in the community\nand it was really beautiful now that I\nnow that I look back at it before uh\nafter when I was younger and I started\nto integrate into the more traditional\nSouthern Culture because I went to\npublic school that brought about a lot\nof challenges for me because it was like\nI was living in this bubble and then\nventuring out into the other world was\nthat for high school it was from all the\nway from kindergarten to to high school\nso you're saying going from home to then\ngoing to yes kindergarten in high school\nso you went to a public public school\npublic school but you were yeah right\nyeah yeah so that brought about its own\nchallenges because like I said I was\njust very different from my peers and it\nmade me appreciate other people and\ntheir differences because I would get\nquestions so much about my spiritual\nbeliefs my practices my family my home\nlife and also here much of the judgments\nthat came along with being so different\nand uh you know I I appear the way I do\nso I don't look like like a like a Hindu\nperson you know like most people\nassociate Hinduism with being from India\nand much of the culture that I grew up\nwith in that Community were Indian so I\nkind of felt like an outcast within the\ncommunity and then felt like an outcast\noutside of that Community as well so it\nwas very difficult for me to find my own\nidentity so I got very good at observing\nother people and and really just having\ncompassion for different forms of life\nwithout judging because I knew what it\nwas like to be judged growing up yeah\nwow yeah and that's that's hard right\nlike when you grow up without feeling\nlike home's not home and then away from\nhome doesn't feel like home\nand but it sounds like you were able to\nprocess it in a healthy way right like\nthe ability to learn not to judge the\nability to be okay with people having\ndifferences the ability to understand\nthat\neveryone was unique and everyone was you\nknow on their own path or whatever it\nmay be like that sounds like a really\nhealthy mindset the second part of my\nquestion was like how did that impact\nyour\nAmbitions and goals and what you wanted\nto do will be because you're getting\nexposed to these two very different\nworlds like you have the Public School\nacademic world and then you have this\nprivate life of spirituality like how\ndid that impact what you wanted to do\nwith your life yeah yeah so we so we\nmoved out of that Community when I was\nabout nine years old and\nyou know we were immigrants my parents\ndidn't speak any English whenever they\narrived to the United States so they had\nto find their way in this world and pay\nfor their kids and we were very\nspiritually rich but materialistically\nvery poor so money was always a topic of\nconversation and always a source of\nanxiety for for my family so\nfor me that really gave birth to the to\nthe desire to be financially stable so I\nwas always good at math I was always\ngood at Sciences I preferred Math and\nScience over English and literature\nbecause there was a definitive answer\nand I really appreciated that and um so\nI pursued engineering my grandpa was a\npilot for many years and he used to\nbring me to the airports and I was\nalways fascinated with Aeronautics with\nplanes and so my original intention was\nto become an aeronautical engineer and\nwhen I went to college there was no\ndegree for that so I switched to the\nnext best thing which was mechanical\nengineering so I got my degree in\nmechanical engineering but what's\ninteresting though is that I never\nreally felt a strong connection to it it\nwas purely coming from the place of what\nit what position or what career can I\nhave that's going to provide that\nsecurity that Financial stability\nbecause I didn't want to be in the\nposition that I witnessed growing up so\nmuch yeah and I think that's so\ninteresting because I feel like if most\nof us look to what we pursue it comes\nfrom a pain we had in our childhood or\nour past where it's like you're pursuing\nsomething because you didn't have it\ngrowing up or you're pursuing something\nbecause you did have it growing up and I\ndon't know if we all ever stopped to\nthink why am I pursuing this like when\nwas it where you started to realize why\nam I pursuing this\nthat maybe that was only because you\ndidn't have money growing up and then\nyour pursuit's shifting but when was\nthat moment where you were like I don't\nthink this is what I really want to do\nthe first day on the job really like\nthat quick yeah what was the reason so\noriginally when I was when I was\nengineering I wanted to get into\nrenewable and sustainable energy and\nthat was my goal and then I had all\nthese job offers after I was graduating\nand ended up going with the highest\noffer which was oil and gas so it was\ncompletely contradictory to what I\noriginally intended on doing so I sold\nout\num not ashamed to say it and what what I\nfound was that you know I started they\nstarted me off at a six figure salary so\nmy my first year at 22 23 was making\nlike 150 Grand a year and I thought to\nmyself wow I have made it like I\nremember crying the first when I got the\noffer because I was like wow I finally\nmade it I can take care of my family now\nand the first day on the job I\nrealized that I was like this is not\nwhat I want to do like I'm gonna have to\ndo this for the next 40 years and then\nretire like I quickly saw the timeline\nof what my life was going to be like and\nthat feeling is not a great feeling\nbecause I had just dedicated five years\nto getting my degree and had an\nincredible amount of debt\nand I just stuck through it you know I I\nlived with that for five years before I\nfinally built up enough courage to leave\nthat career and pursue something that\nwas more meaningful for me but it but it\ntook me five years of really suffering\nwith that and living with that to\nfinally create enough discomfort for me\nto be like you know what this money is\nnot everything and I really feel like I\nhave a deeper purpose and I feel like I\ncan make a greater impact in the world\nand be of better service to People by\nleaning into this thing that I had been\ndoing on the side which was\nbasically teaching people how to be\nvegan and in shape that's yeah I want to\ndive into that with you because I I\nremember setting out too I really wanted\nto do art and design at University like\nat college that was what I wanted to do\nthat was my favorite subject in high\nschool and I traded it to do a business\ndegree even though I did focus on and\ndiscovered Behavioral Science which I\nfell in love with which was actually my\npassion with Art and Design which I've\nlater discovered but I sold out too\nbecause I was just told so many times\nthat Art and Design wouldn't make money\nyeah and so I was like oh yeah you've\ngot to make a smart decision and then I\nbecame a monk anyway on top of all of it\nso it all went out the window but a lot\nof people feel that way where they have\nsomething that's calling them something\nthat's pulling them towards it but then\nthey push it away because something\nfeels more realistic or something else\nfeels like the right thing to do and\nit's amazing that you noticed it on day\none and I've created now\na new methodology and I'm repeating this\nbecause I hope I remember to use it\nagain and again and again and there are\ntimes when I remember it there are times\nwhen I wish I remembered it but I came\nup with a methodology of how I make\ndecisions because I found that money was\nalways such a tempting\ntantalizing thing or whatever that's one\nof those but I think there are so many\nthings in the world that are just so\nattractive and lucrative that they\ndistract us from what we truly want and\nso I came up with something that I call\nesm and the E stands for energy so the\nfirst thing I ask is does this give me\nenergy does this person give me energy\ndoes this project give me energy does\nthe work energize me do I want to bring\nmy energy to this like is this an energy\nfit and that's a question I always ask\nmyself if the answer is yes then I move\nforward to the S and the S is strategy\nokay my energy feels good it's like my\nheart feels good but is this strategic\nlike does this strategically make sense\ndoes it make sense on the basis of do we\nalways have the right idea sometimes\nsomething makes sense energetically but\nif there isn't a strategy behind it it\nwon't last it's not sustainable so is\nthere strategy behind this is there an\neffective method behind this a system a\nprocess that I can get behind and that\nmy energy will be directed clearly I\nthink a lot of the time you feel like oh\nthe energy is amazing a very La thing as\nwell and it's like like the energy is\nreally good but then it just kind of\ngoes Splat right like it's just\neverywhere it's like is my energy\ndirected if the answer is yes then I go\nto the m which stands for money and so\ndoes this make commercial sense does\nthis make sense financially does it mean\nand so money is an important part of my\nmethodology it's just the third most\nimportant metric and I only get to ask\nthat question if I go through the first\ntwo and that stops you from doing things\njust for something at the end I love\nthat uh and and at least it's helped me\nyeah no I love that because you know I\nnever I never had that process for me it\nwas always the lucrative like what can\nprovide the most money and I will endure\nwhatever I need to to provide and I'm\nnot saying that money's not important I\nagree everybody has to provide for\nthemselves and everybody's in different\nsituations and for me personally\nengineering just really clearly uh it\nwas clear to me that it wasn't\nenergizing me it was very much training\nme so going to work every day was not\nsomething I looked forward to I I looked\nfor reasons to leave I was constantly\ndistracted about the other life that I\nhad wanted for myself and\nyou know I used to think that doing\nsomething that you love and making money\nwere mutually exclusive same yeah I\ndidn't know that you could marry the two\nand now I believe that a career is I\nDefine career as a profitable source of\npleasure so doing something that I love\nfirst and foremost you will every time\nget really good at it and when you're\ngood at anything you can Master it and\nyou can teach it to others and I never\nonce in a million years thought that I\nwould be doing what I'm doing but I did\nit just on the side for free because it\nbrought me that much joy and fulfillment\njust for myself and once I started to\nsee the Ripple and the Curiosity from\nother people and thought to myself wow I\ncan really make a difference in\nsomebody's life just by sharing how I'm\nliving and that's when I really found\nthe conviction to say you know what this\nis something that I want to pursue even\nif it doesn't make sense logically I'm\ngoing to listen to my heart for once\nbecause I've been listening to my brain\nthis entire time I'm gonna drop in and\nlisten to my heart and what my gut is\ntelling me my gut is telling me to\npursue this to follow this yeah no I I\nthink that's I love that uh your\ndefinition of what a career is that's\nthat's really cool and and I I can agree\nwith you more I I remember\nliterally and this is crazy for me to\nthink about it I didn't know and when I\nsay I didn't know I mean like my mind\ndidn't process that there was any other\ncareer out of being a doctor a lawyer or\nin business like I literally thought\nthose were the only three careers that\nexisted not because I didn't I and I\ndidn't know anyone who didn't do any of\nthose things apart from obviously if\npeople were teachers or if people you\nknow my my uh my uncle owned a grocery\nstore and things like that like a local\ngrocery a small local grocery store and\nso things like that but I didn't have\ncontext over you could be something else\nand therefore it was those three things\nand I never liked medicine I never liked\nLauren so I had to do business and\nbecause Art and Design wasn't a career\nso I get that and I think a lot of\npeople live that way and feel that way\nand I also think today we've created a\nculture where it's like you have to be\nan entrepreneur and that I disagree with\ntoo like I don't think doing what you\nlove means doing it as an entrepreneur I\nthink there are phenomenally talented\npeople who work inside organizations and\nwhen you think about some of the CEOs of\nthe biggest companies today they didn't\nfound them like send a picture ioc of\nGoogle or Tim Cook who CEO of Apple like\nthey didn't build those companies and\nthey became so successful within an\norganization that they run and so I do\nthink that we're also living at that\nother extreme now where it's like you\nhave to quit your job and do something\nyou love and I'm like well that doesn't\nmake sense either like maybe some people\nare going to find what they love inside\na career and inside a workplace and I\nthink I think both need to be managed so\nwe went from like you have to work an\namazing job as an engineer and do\nsomething you hate and get paid and now\nit's like you have to quit everything\nand do what you love and it's like well\nthere's a spectrum there definitely I\nwant to know how you survived the five\nyears because I love that answer that\nyou knew it on the first day but you had\nto survive and suffer for five years I\nthink that's very very real\nbecause you're in your head trying to\nfigure that out like\nhow did you deal and cope with those\nfive years did you adopt bad habits what\ndid you do because I think oftentimes\nthat's when people turn to like\ndifferent things I don't know if you did\nbut\nyeah what did you do and then how did\nyou finally get out yeah yeah definitely\nI mean there's when you don't when you\nlive that way obviously I'm\nyou you find Escape right there's\nthere's ways to escape and thankfully my\nEscape was the gym and right anytime I\nwould get off work that's a good Escape\nyeah it was a great escape for me and I\nwould go to the gym and I would really\njust\nfind peace and it was it was like my\ntherapy I would go to the gym and I\nreally do love training I love the art\nof learning how this this vessel works\nand how I can really optimize the\nmovements and how it feels and and just\nreally sink into the the process of of\ndeveloping my physical self and what I\nlearned in that process was how many\nbenefits mentally there are as well\nbecause it requires discipline it\nrequires sacrifice it requires intention\nand attention to detail so that's where\nI really found enjoyment was really in\nthe process of learning how to develop\nmy physical self and as far as dealing\nwith you know the five years I had\nthought about quitting I mean I also am\na realist and knew that I had to provide\nfor myself and I would also be giving up\na very good opportunity and didn't have\nthe clarity of what that next thing\nwould be and all the while I was doing\nthis other thing it was right in front\nof me the whole time but I needed to to\nreally\nfind that path like I needed the\ncontrast of doing something that I\ndidn't like doing because that gave me\nthe clarity to find something that I\nreally did so I don't regret anything in\nmy life that was painful or challenging\nbecause it's really shaped who I am\ntoday and given me the opportunity to\nhave the clarity to pursue the things\nthat really resonate with me yeah yeah\nand I guess you can deal with you know\nwhat your clients are dealing with too\nin terms of the stress of the workplace\nthe stress of what they're going through\nand you you've been in their shoes you\nknow you know what it looks like and\nI think that the thing that came to my\nmind when you were saying that was\num you knew that you were falling in\nlove with with working out and you were\nfalling in love with this other thing on\nthe side I have a friend that well she\nshe used to be workings at a company and\nshe was stressed and hated it in the\nsame sense as you do did and but she\nloved presenting\nand so Then she joined the company where\nshe's a public speaking coach and she\ngoes back to the company she's to work\nout and teach public speaking like\nteaches communication not just public\nspeaking but teaches communication\nteaches negotiation teaches people\nskills and she's so much happier doing\nit and I love seeing those stories where\npeople\nhave the courage to figure out the\nswitch but it sounds like you're doing a\nlot in your evenings and weekends\nto build this other route and build this\nother path when you made the switch over\ndid it feel like because I'm guessing\nwhen you first did it were you able to\nreplace your salary completely no right\nthat's yeah that's my friend she's it's\ntaken her three years to replace her\nsalary that she made before\nbut she's doing good now and so yeah I\nthink that working as an engineer and\ngoing through that\num getting my degree really helped me\nthink like an engineer obviously so I\napproached it with that engineering\napproach of like how can I take this\nthing that I really want to do and\ncreate systems and processes for me to\nmake it financially so I could pay for\nmy bills essentially that was my goal it\nwas like can I just cover my bills at\nthat point in time and what I wanted to\ndo was reach as many people as possible\nso I partnered up with a software\nengineer and we decided to build a whole\nplatform of how can I really systemize\ndelivering the content teaching people\nhow to lift providing educational\ncontent and then also the meal planning\nwhich is the most important part\nwhenever people are trying to get in\nshape is figuring out what to eat so we\ndeveloped a whole algorithm and a whole\nplatform to be able to serve thousands\nof clients at a time and it took months\nof planning I wasn't making any money I\nwas just kind of siphoning away all my\nsavings and what's what's really\ninteresting is that first week whenever\nwe launched our very first program and\nvery first offer I made more in a week\nthan I made in a year as an engineer and\nthat's that was the moment for me that I\nwas like wow this is very possible yeah\nfor me to continue to pursue and\nobviously that's that's my experience\nbut it takes that level of of planning\nand really having an approach that is\nyou know risk averse you know I'm not\nsuggesting for anybody to go quit their\njob I think that having a plan of action\nand having a timeline makes the most\nsense for you to not put yourself in a\ncompromising position so that's the way\nthat I did it and it's it's panned out\nvery very well because it's given me the\nspace to still work with so many people\nand still get to do what I love and not\nbe so focused on in the business just\nworking in the business if that makes\nsense and it also shows that a lot of\nour experiences are not wasted like no\nfirst of all growing up in a spiritual\nCommunity made you vegetarian made you\nhave a himself made you appreciate\nlife forms like that's a useful\nexperience even if at that time you felt\nalone and disconnected from the people\nyou're around then you go off and you\nstudy engineering which again you're\nlike I don't want to be an engineer but\nyour engineering skills are the ones\nthat you use to launch your passion yeah\nand then it's like you discover what you\nlove doing which is working out and now\nwhat you do is mixing compassion working\nout and engineering and I I love that\nidea that encouraging people to collect\npassions and curate their passion and\nthat's how you create your passion is\nthat you're constantly collecting\nexperiences and then you're bringing\nthem together rather than like I found\nthis one thing and everything before\nthis was a waste of time and even in my\njourney I feel the same way it's like I\nloved Art and Design growing up which\nhas massively impacted my career today\nbecause I look at everything through the\nlens of Art and Design and then I was\nfortunately great at economics and good\nat understanding business and then\nBehavioral Science and that was that's\nobviously been very useful in my life\ntoday and then obviously I fell in love\nwith philosophy and I fell in love with\nteaching and I fell in love with\nmentorship and I fell in love with the\nwisdom that I learned from the monks and\nnow my life is all three of those things\nput together and I wouldn't trade any of\nthose experiences so if anyone's in a\nbad place right now or anyone's in a\nhard place right now where they don't\nenjoy what they do or they feel they\nstudied the wrong thing at University or\ncollege or whatever it is none of that's\nwasted because you're just collecting\nexperiences that will be useful if you\nlook at it that way in what you're\nbuilding and that isn't a mindset that's\njust true that any skill you learn right\nnow is going to be useful later on\nyeah I I believe in this this like\ninclusion based Universe where\neverything is happening for your benefit\nevery experience that you go through is\nhappening for you and you can be the\nbeneficiary even if some very\nchallenging times and I believe that\nfrom the Soul's perspective we call in\nthese experiences so that we can develop\nthe strength of the resilience or the\nperspective to transcend them so when I\nlook back at my childhood although it\nwas it had its moments of of beauty and\nso much Beauty in my life there was also\nso much Challenge and and strife as well\nand I see those moments now as what\nreally shaped me and primed me for what\nI'm doing today because once at one\npoint the thing that I was most ashamed\nof is the thing that I I really lead\nwith now so just remembering that in any\ntime of challenge that this is teaching\nyou something and in some time maybe you\ncan't see it right there but you are the\nbeneficiary of this challenging moment\nand it will allow you to keep growing\nit's like you know there's so many\nparallels between the gym and life you\nknow it's like you're under the bar at\ndoing squats and it's very very\nuncomfortable you want it to stop you\nwant to drop the weight you're like no\nmore I can't handle anymore and then you\npush through and on the other side of\nthat you develop the strength and the\nresilience and your body adapts and you\ngrow so that you can handle that plus\nsome the next time so that's that's the\nway that I really try to approach any\nchallenge these days is like okay bring\nit on I accept the challenge because I\ncalled this experience into my life so I\ncould transcend it what's the mindset\nand where did bodybuilding come into\nlike where what's the mindset behind\nwanting to do that where does that come\nfrom and what was that Journey like\nbecause I think we hear about it a lot I\nthink from\ncelebrities in the media who have to\nlook a certain way for movies or things\nlike that and then they come out years\nlater and they tell you how unhealthy it\nwas and but during when the movies I\nthink it was Zac Efron recently it was\nlike you know he talked about the\nBaywatch uh movie and it's obviously\nwhen you watch that movie you're like\nthat looks incredible yeah and he did\nand then you know he was on TV shows at\nthe time but then I think he came out\nrecently and he was talking about how\nunhealthy it was or how he didn't feel\ngreat about it and I think a lot of men\ntalk about that afterwards as one women\nof course talk about it but I feel like\nit's great when a couple of Men start\nopening up about how even though they\nlook great and every guy wanted to look\nlike them it wasn't healthy but for you\nhow how has that Journey been for you\nand I'm intrigued to I've never asked\nyou this before so yeah no it's a bit of\nan arc for me you know I remember always\nbeing the small kid growing up so there\nwas a bit of insecurity there and so\ndefinitely ego played a big part in for\nme to want to develop myself because it\nyou know it quite literally built layers\nbetween you and everybody else and if\nyou're trying to protect your fragile\nnature or your little wounded self then\nthis is a great way to do that even if\nit's masked through other things so that\nwas that was a big Journey for me\nbecause originally when I got into it I\nhad I had that reason and then the more\nI did it the more I really started to to\ndo it because I loved it and didn't\ntrain because I didn't like myself or\nthe thought of if I'm out of shape\nnobody will like me or I won't like\nmyself and started shifting and\nreframing that too I really love taking\ncare of myself because I feel good when\nI do and that's what really led me to\nlean into it and and to continue to\ndiscover ways in which I could just\ndevelop myself further and then somebody\nactually suggested it to me in the gym\none time they said hey there's a show\ncoming up locally and you should do it\nyou look great and I was like yeah right\nyou will you could not pay me to do that\nand then I thought about it I was like\nyou know I don't have anything else\ngoing on\num this could be some new challenge some\nsomething exciting I did it and ended up\nwinning the first show that I competed\nin so obviously when you excel at\nsomething it motivates you even further\nso yeah yeah so then the the marriage of\nlike teaching people how to do what I\ndid without eating any animal products\nfelt really aligned with me because I\nhad heard up until that point that you\ncouldn't win a bodybuilding show or\nbodybuilders need animal protein so here\nI was showing other people that you\ncould do it and that's what I really\nfelt the call Beyond myself to say hey\nif I can Inspire other people to live\nmore compassionately then this is worth\nme pursuing because it brings me that\nmuch more fulfillment and I see the\ndifference that it's making and maybe\nthat they might be complete strangers to\nme but it's nice to know that people are\nout there listening yeah and that's when\nI continued and eventually became Pro\neventually did that for a few years but\nthen afterwards I got wrapped up in the\nidentity of like being a bodybuilder and\nthat's when I started to recognize that\nhey maybe this isn't for me anymore\nbecause I'm I'm attaching so much of who\nI am to what I look like and that\ndoesn't feel good anymore so that's when\nI decided to step away from the sport\naltogether and just retire in 2018. I\nmean that's that's a real journey\nbecause like you said it often starts\nwith like ego or validation from\nourselves from others then you kind of\nget to a point if you're lucky where\nyou're like okay now I'm doing it for\nmyself and I enjoy it talk to me a bit\nabout that Journey because I think\nthat's the hardest part of that journey\nis like going from like I do this\nbecause I want the validation for myself\nand others and I want to protect\nyou know the the younger me\nto I'm actually going to do this because\nI like feeling better like walk me\nthrough some of the steps there because\nI feel like yeah that feels like a long\nlong journey yeah it was for sure and\nyou know it the ego is a funny thing\nbecause once you shine the light of\nawareness on a part of your ego it just\nkind of Dances Into The Shadow and it\nbecomes a little bit more Insidious and\ntricky and shows up in new ways so for\nme it kept showing up in different ways\nto where I was realizing that it wasn't\nbringing me happiness anymore like I\nfelt this obligation this pressure to be\nthis person and at the time my following\nwas continuously Rising as my popularity\ngrew and the\nreally just the exposure to people's\ncomments and things that they had to say\nabout me I started to notice how much it\nwas affecting me and specifically\nfocusing on negativity and I was like\nwhy am I really focusing on this and\nallowing it to really disrupt my\ninternal State and that's when I started\nto get real with myself and saying oh\nbecause I am seeking this validation and\nit means so much to me and when people\nthink highly of me and when they don't\nit really affects me mentally so that's\nwhen I started to to stick take a step\nback do more self-reflection and say\nmaybe I'm not doing this for the right\nreasons anymore and I should explore\nthat yeah and I and I like that\nreflection because I always try and walk\ninto things with the right intention\nand then I try and reflect on my\nintention while I'm doing it and I can\noften find that it's easy for your\nintention to get distorted and then I\nask myself can I bring my intention back\nto doing it for the right thing and then\nif I can't that's when I leave it so my\ngoal is always I try and start with the\nright motivation the right approach and\nthen it's natural for it to get\ndistorted that's always going to happen\nto any of us because we're not perfect\nbecause we're not we haven't got\neverything figured out and so I'll\nrealize that oh maybe I did kind of go\ntoo far this way and then I'll see if I\nhave the ability to come back and\nsometimes I do and sometimes I don't and\nso it sounds like you went through that\nsame process of you know can I do this\nagain for the right reasons when you uh\ndoing it at its peak and you had people\ncoming up to you talking to you about\ncompassion and plant-based life and\nveganism like did people notice that\nwere they aware of that and then what\nwould they say to you like what what was\npeople's reactions I mean just Intrigue\nuh yeah I mean there's always a lot of\ncuriosity a lot of interest whenever you\nhear somebody doing something that's uh\nunorthodox so vegan bodybuilder is an\noxymoron for a lot of people they don't\nbelieve it's possible so to see somebody\ndoing it and competing at the highest\nlevel\num it brought its own pressures to me\nbecause people especially the vegan\nmovement tended to pedestalize me and\nuse me as this poster boy this example\nfor uh somebody who could do this which\nI enjoyed and then also equally didn't\nenjoy because I would be thrown into\narguments online and and people would\njust use me as this example where I just\nopened up my phone and just see all\nthese comments of people arguing back\nand forth and again my my goal was to\nnever be polarizing it online or it was\nit was too Inspire the people that\nreally wanted to live this way so that's\nthat also played a huge impact into\nreassessing what kind of message I'm\nputting out there and to really again\njust lead lead with compassion and and\nshow that you can coexist with people\nwho have different views on life\ndifferent perspectives than you we're\nwe're often more times more common than\nwe are different so uh that's that's\nanother reason why I felt like\nbodybuilding is a sport of comparison\nit's me literally lined up to another\nperson and comparing the two and I\nalways approached that Sport with it's\nalways just me versus me I could never\ncontrol what anybody else was doing\noutside of you know that experience it\nwas like you step on stage it's not me\nversus these other guys it's just me\nversus who I was yesterday but that's\nreally when I wanted to step away from\nthe sport so I could continue to focus\non the thing that I originally wanted to\ndo which was to help serve people yeah\nin my highest capacity which is when I\nstarted coaching after I bodybuilding\nyeah and that's and that's what I find\ninteresting too it's a\nknowing when to quit something and\nquitting stuff is such a good skill that\nI think is underrated like we rate\npeople in society for how long they can\ndo something as opposed to how quickly\nthey can let go of something that\ndoesn't serve them or serve others\nanymore\nand I'm more interested in that\nsometimes where I think about\nlike I let go of being a monk at a time\nwhen I didn't feel like it served me or\nserved others anymore I let go of my\ncorporate career because it didn't serve\nme or serve others anymore\nI let go of the first content I created\nwe don't make content like that anymore\nbecause it didn't serve me or serve\nothers anymore and it's like we've we've\nevolved in so many ways and I often\nthink that we keep putting time you've\ndone something on a pedestal as opposed\nto\ntime you stopped doing things that\ndidn't make sense to you anymore and so\neven hearing that from your perspective\nit's like we did this bodybuilding we\nachieved so much and then I had to leave\nit behind in order to move into coaching\nand and you know in the coaching space\nyou've worked with some incredible\npeople and you don't have to name anyone\nor whatever you whatever you feel\ncomfortable with but in the idea of like\nwhen you're coaching someone or anyone\nwho's thinking about becoming a coach or\nthinking about becoming\na trainer a guide a teacher in any\ncapacity what what were the things that\nhave been really important that you've\nlearned through coaching other people\nwho are high performers yeah it's it's\nit's realizing that it's not about me\nit's not about me coaching them it's\nabout me helping my client discover the\nthe power that they contain within\nthemselves so oftentimes people think\nthat they're not one who could possibly\nget into shape or do the things that\nthey commit because they just get in\ntheir own way so what I've found is that\nthose are symptoms of underlying beliefs\nmaybe their subconscious beliefs that\nare preventing them from doing the\nthings that they really want to do so\nwhen I coach and you know this from from\nworking with me is that I like to talk a\nlot during our sessions and hear what\nyour experience is like because\noftentimes language reveals so much\nabout how we think and ironically the\nway that we view ourselves has a huge\nimpact in the way that we show up for\nour our physical health so as I'm\ntraining people it's almost like I don't\nwant to call it therapy but it's just a\nreally deep conversation where I learn\nabout my clients on a level that allows\nthem to see what kind of capable\npowerful person they are and then once\nthey recognize it themselves then they\nstart to show up and believe it\nthemselves yeah so yeah if everyone\nwho's listening nimai trained me during\nthe pandemic I think it was for a few\nmonths we worked again other and I I\nguarantee Nema has never had anyone that\nhe's trained that has been worse than me\nliterally I would like and Nema is a\ngreat trainer and he's everything he\njust said he is like you know it was\nvery like therapeutic working with him\nyou know super supportive constantly\nmade me look for The Power Within Myself\nAnd I'd be like nine times out of ten\nafter a session I'd be lying on my bed\ndirty face just trying to recover uh\nbecause I'd love the coolness of my bed\nyeah and I would just need to sit there\nand just like take it in because it was\nso high intensity in a good way but at\nthe same time I also broke through a lot\nof mental blocks I had around what I\nbelieved around what my body could do or\nyou know what what I believed my body\nwas capable of like we were able to\ndial back and start slower and build up\nagain and I think you were so great at\ndoing that like I think it's so\nbeautiful I as I'm a coach too and I\nthink when I'm being coached I really\nappreciate it when someone makes me feel\nlike I can get there and that it's okay\nthat I'm slower or that it's taking time\nI'm already going through all the\nself-judgment and self-criticism the\nlast thing I need is for someone else to\ncriticize me too and and to have someone\nwho's supporting you along that journey\nI really felt that with you I've always\nfelt that with you through our\nfriendship but I also felt it very much\nin that time and I think those are such\ngreat skills for all relationships\nactually not just for coaching but if\nyou're teaching your partner something\nif you're teaching your child something\nif you're teaching your parents\nsomething if we could be more supportive\nand know it's the goodness in them and\nknow it's the attempt and notice the\npositive attitude that person have and\nthe fact that they showed up that person\nis going to feel inspired but if we\ncriticize them the first time they\nfumble or judge them the second time\nthey make a mistake or point out to them\nhow much better everyone else that we\ntrain is that doesn't help anyone and I\nI at one point I had one of my clients\ntook me to play golf with him and I\ndon't play golf and I'm I've never\nplayed golf before that day and I had a\ncoach at the center we went to and the\ncoach was incredible\nvery patient very professional you know\nvery there for me I was only there for a\nday so I only got a day of coaching but\nby the end of the day I was half decent\nI was okay as and I could do something\nand when I came back to LA because we\nwere traveling together but when I came\nback to LA I tried to look for a golf\ncoach here because I really got into it\nI was like oh this could be a cool thing\nto do and maybe it'd be fun to get into\nwith Roddy and I took Rodney with me and\nI got a coach who'd supposedly worked\nwith like some of the best the best and\nall the rest of it and I couldn't take a\nshot without him correcting me every\nsecond and it almost became really\ndraining and tiring because I was like I\nneed to hit like 10 shots to then be\ncorrected but if I'm corrected in every\nhalf a swing it's really hard for me to\nlike find my flow and I felt so\ncriticized and judged and everything\nthat I kind of never saw him again after\nlike seeing him a couple of times and it\njust showed me that being a coach is\nreally tough being a student is really\ntough but often I think we\nwrongly coach our friends and family and\nthat's where I find the coaching\nconversation to be most interesting even\nif you're not a coach in your career how\nyou try and teach things to your family\nyour friends your kids your parents goes\na long way I want to hear your thoughts\non that yeah no it's meeting people\nwhere they are right and and\nunderstanding that everybody is where\nthey're at and that is the only place\nthey could be with the awareness that\nthey have in that moment so really\nhaving compassion because really I mean\ncoaches just help you get one step ahead\nat a time if you try to share something\nwith someone who's not ready to receive\nthat message it's just going to go over\ntheir head so I really love starting\nwith the fundamentals of of helping\npeople make those small incremental\nchanges that compound to be big big\ndifference in their their physical\nhealth but not just their physical\nhealth but like the way that they\nbelieve they have the confidence in\nthemselves that they can achieve the\nthings that they want to so like you\nsaid sometimes people are Their Own\nWorst critics and and having compassion\ntowards yourself whenever you're\nlearning something is a skill and it's\nnot something that we exercise very much\nso I really try to help my clients also\nexercise that muscle of can you be\ncompassionate with yourself yes you may\nbe not where you want to be maybe you're\na bit out of shape that's okay the\ndifference that you have now is you have\nthe awareness that you want to do\nsomething about it you don't have to\njudge yourself for the mistakes that you\nmade all of that process was or all of\nthose decisions were coming from a place\nthat maybe you didn't have the awareness\nto maybe you didn't have the skill set\ntoo maybe to have the resources too but\nnow moving forward you have the support\ntoo and it you first have to be kind\nwith yourself yeah first and foremost so\nif you if you feel guilty or if you feel\nashamed of allowing yourself to get to\nthis point just know that\nyes it you you we're always accountable\nfor what we do but there's no need to\nbelittle yourself or beat yourself up\nabout it it's like I I'd like to use\nthis example with my clients if you were\nto hand a child a calculus problem and\ntell them to solve it and they weren't\nable to solve it would you yell at them\nor scream at them or tell them how\nstupid they are or how incapable they\nare no they just don't have the\nawareness to solve that problem and that\nis the same kind of thinking that you\ncould apply towards yourself like you\nwould you would be gentle with them you\nwould be kind with them you would be\nsupportive you would ask them what they\nneed to help get them to that place so\nthat's the way that I like to teach my\nclients to think about themselves so\nthat the next time they show up and they\nsay hey you know what I slipped up but\nbut slipping up and giving up are two\ntotally different things so it's okay to\nslip up failure is part of the formula\nfor Success so you you learn you make\nmistakes you get better you make more\nadvanced mistakes and then you get\nbetter so that's the formula that I like\nto teach my clients as well yeah yeah\nyeah I love that and what I love about\nthat approach is Just Fitness and\nworking out and and anything we do\nexternally is so much more of an\ninternal Journey like it's like\novercoming the inner critic overcoming\nthe inner judgment being able to be kind\nto ourselves being able to be\ncompassionate to ourselves being able to\nlet things go and know when to work\nharder and when to pull back like it's\nsuch an internal dialogue it's it's\ncompletely inner Mastery that you're\nactually working on and I often think\nabout me as someone who I love playing\nsports I've never really loved working\nout\nbut that's the part that I can get\nbehind is that ultimately it's in a\nMastery that I'm working on even if\nworking out isn't my favorite thing even\nthough I do do it because I realize it's\nvalue and benefit but that ultimately\nit's in a Mastery that I'm trying to get\nthrough yeah yeah and focusing more on\nthe process too and not so much the\noutcome because the outcome yes people\nare motivated by results but if you're\nonly motivated by results and they don't\ncome in the timeline that you expect\nthem to then your motivation will tank\nso finding that intrinsic motivation of\nof not just looking a certain way in the\nmirror or seeing a certain number on the\nscale or being able to squat a thousand\npounds or anything like that but really\nbeing intrinsically motivated by the\nfeeling that you're looking to achieve\nby doing this so showing up for yourself\ngoing to the gym and just remembering or\njust thinking about the feeling that you\nwould get once you have that internal\nFreedom within your body the comfort of\nwhat it would feel like to just wake up\nand feel good just feel good in your\nskin and feel capable of of handling\nwhatever life throws at you because you\nhave been consistently training and\nshowing up in this way so I really try\nto preach just focus on the process and\nif you can really find a way to enjoy\nthe process to make it fun to make it\nexciting like Fitness is not just about\ngoing to the gym there's many different\nforms of Fitness so if you don't like\ntraining or you don't like lifting\nweights in the gym like you could do\ntennis or you could play soccer you\ncould go hiking you could go biking you\ncould go uh paddle boarding there's so\nmany different things that once you find\nthe enjoyment of it then you're more\nlikely to keep doing it yeah absolutely\nNema it's been so dope talking to you\nman it's just like I I feel like there's\nso many great lessons from just hearing\nsomeone's journey and you know even\nthough we've been friends and we've\ntalked before it's like to actually hear\nyour journey step by step and I I\nnoticed this and everyone that I think\nis living happier healthy and healed\nlives is that it's just that they took\nthe time to reflect\nand then shift that's like a Common\nThread I find in people who are happier\nhealthier and more healed is that they\nweren't smarter they weren't better they\nweren't\nand this applies to me too it's like you\ndidn't it's not that you were above\nanyone\nand it's not that you were below it's\nnot that you were ahead or behind it's\nthat the only difference is you took the\ntime to reflect and shift your life\naccording to your reflection\nand I find that today we do a lot of\nthinking and overthinking\nand thinking and overthinking is where\nyou just let the same thought go over\nand over and over again but reflecting\nis asking yourself is this the right\nthought is this thought useful is this\nthe thought that I want to play again\nand again and again and if the answer is\nno let me shift my behavior so that I\ncan have a different door or let me\nplant a new thought so that it can shift\nmy behavior and so I see that through a\njourney and it's just I hope that this\nconversation encourages you to listen to\nyour friends listen to people around you\nto to make time and space for reflection\nbecause even reflecting with you today\nI'm it's amazing to see how many\nsimilarities there are even though we do\nvery different things or have achieved\nvery different things externally but\nthere's so many similarities in how we\nhad to Pivot and shift yeah I mean I\nthink it really comes down to listening\nto yourself like you said that\nself-reflection that listening to your\ngut listening to that inner knowing and\nyou you it's it's much more difficult to\nfind that without creating the space to\nlisten so for me that meditation is also\nwhenever I move my body some people find\nit in Stillness I find it in movement\nand that is when I find these this this\nconnection to this higher self if you\nwill Within Myself to where I get all my\nbest ideas I find the most inspiration\nso creating the space for whatever that\nlooks like for you to to Really tap into\nthe deepest part of yourself that brings\nyou the most fulfillment and most joy\nand most clarity about who do you want\nto be what type of person do you want to\nshow up as what type of Life do you want\nto have and are you living in alignment\nwith those those thoughts or are you\nliving incongruently with that and that\nthat disparity between the two is\nsignified by how you feel about it so\nyou're always being shown and being\nGuided by your your feelings so learn to\ntap into the good feelings and what\nfeels right and what feels true for you\nand then just continue to follow that\nabsolutely Nema I love that we end every\nepisode with a final five okay these\nhave to be answered in a one word to one\nsentence maximum\num so Nema these are your final five the\nfirst question is uh what is the best\nfitness advice you've ever received or\nheard just be consistent okay just be\nconsistent that is good advice all right\nthe second question is what is the worst\nFitness advice you've ever heard or\nreceived that you have to go to a gym to\nget fit you know I would say that you\nhave to you don't have to sign up to a\ngym to get in shape you know just find\nwhat you like to do that's active and\nget you moving and that's what's most\nimportant when it comes to Fitness yeah\nI remember when you turn a random room\nin our house into yeah\nthe pandemic so yeah I believe that now\nafter having seen you doing that uh do\nthat uh question number three what uh\nhow would you define your current\npurpose to help inspire people to lead\nwith more compassion beautiful uh\nquestion number four what's uh something\nthat you used to Value when it came to\nphysical fitness but that you don't\nvalue anymore I would say the the this\nis a bit superficial but the amount of\nweight that I that I lift in the gym I\nsee so many people lift with their ego\nand they're just being very inefficient\nwith their movement and they're\nessentially wasting their time in the\ngym so leave your ego at the door\nwhenever you go into the gym and lift\nwith intention don't just go in there to\nswing weight around and look cool but\nreally go in there with the intention of\nof mastering the repetition if you can\nMaster the repetition of any movement\nthen you will see so much faster results\nthan anything else that's great I love\nthat that's a good piece of advice uh\nFifth and final question if you could\ncreate one law that everyone in the\nworld had to follow what would it be\nlet's be be kind to others\num accept people where they are and who\nthey are\num I think that the world would be a\nmuch much more pleasant place than what\nit is right now we need a lot of that\nyeah everyone that's nemai Delgado make\nsure you check him out if you don't\nalready on social media we will put put\nhis handles everywhere and make sure you\ntag us uh both me and nimai with\nanything that stood out in this\nconversation I think this was one of\nthose conversations where you know we\nlearn so much about so many things we go\nthrough all the time things like\npivoting your career things like knowing\nwhen to quit things like how to process\nyour early experiences and turn them\ninto something else and then ultimately\nhow do you find what you love and live\nin that way and totally create a life\naround what you love and what you\nbelieve in whether that's loving your\nworkout or loving your career and so I\nhope this episode guides you closer\ntowards that direction I hope this\nepisode moves you in that direction\ntowards your greatest gifts and your\ngreatest potential and I want to say a\nbig thank you to Nema for spending his\ntime with us today uh thank you so much\nman that was amazing and it's
