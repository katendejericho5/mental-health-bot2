    "transcript": "the biggest conversations in my life the\nscariest ones won't even lead to like\nDevastation it just could potentially\nlead to like a moment of discomfort\ndiscomfort of cringe or whatever and\nit's worth it the best-selling author\nand host the number one Health and\nWellness podcast on purpose with Jay\nShetty\nwhen I look at you you're very private\non social media and you don't post a lot\nI wanted to understand was that\nintentional is that I got my little\nprivate I have my private IG that is is\nso weird and someone called me out on it\nit's like you're private and verified\nand like it's it's silly it's really\nlike my publicist like set it up with\nthe intention of like posting about\nshows and and the like and um I'm\nsomeone who doesn't want attention\nunless like I I asked for it I'm\nprobably the worst celebrity\nwhatever ever because I never really\nchased it I I really just like to work\nand then present that and and that's\npretty much it and like something like\nInstagram is really it is me I wouldn't\nwant to present like a false version of\nmyself uh so\nI I wouldn't want to be presentational\nso I kind of closed it off to just like\nas of right now maybe but I don't know\nif I'll ever do I'll probably delete it\nbefore I open it but I can be like more\nhonest and like a control like I can\njust post things that I would actually I\nI would actually text these things to\neveryone and so I can remain truthful on\nInstagram and and non-perform I'm a\nperformer who's trying to remain\nnon-performance\nhow's that going okay it's okay yeah\nyeah no I it's uh it's I've become\nfunnier I think like on stage and stuff\nuh by not performing like by being\ntruthful like yeah yeah I think it's a\nbetter version of myself uh but yeah\nit's hard it's hard to in life it's hard\nto do that well that must feel very\ncomforting I can imagine because I feel\nlike for so many performers there's\nsomeone on stage because that's their\njob and then there's someone at home\nbecause that's who they are and so\nthere's always this conflict inside and\noutside\nwhat for you has been like the biggest\nimpact on who you are today like if you\nhad to say this is a recipe of how I was\ncreated what would you add to that\nrecipe to say like Gerard is a little\nbit of this and a little bit of that\nlike what's sugar and spice yeah\num it's a big question it's a big\nquestion it's a huge question yeah\num I I don't know if I'll be able to\nfully answer it because like you know\nI'm up to this point I'm I'm influenced\nby you know\nthe time I'm in the who I am being\nAmerican all of those things that we're\nall influenced by\num as a performer influenced by you know\neveryone from\nCosby to You Know Jack Benny to you know\nto rock and Chappelle and really good\npeople like people who are really good\nat uh their job but lately I've been\nreally influenced by just this this\ndrive to not lie\nyou know like like to not lie and like\nit's made me a Storyteller because then\nlike just trying to\nyou know tell\nthings about me or things in my life\nthat like are scary\nis funnier I found for the work and\nbeing around people that I don't have to\num try and protect my my words with\nis is more comforting yeah when when you\nwere growing up like what was the\nenvironment for you growing up we just\ntalked about North Carolina which is\nwhere you were born and raised right so\nlike yeah what was the environment like\nwhen you were growing up and what you\nknow for you how early was it that you\ndiscovered that this was going to be a\npath in life because I think for me I'm\nalways intrigued to figure out how\npeople discover things they're\npassionate about and things that they\nlove because that's so rare how early\nwas it for you and what was the\nenvironment that you grew up in it was\npretty early like I was a kid that\nperformed a lot like I asked for a\nmicrophone every year at Christmas that\nwas like my constant I was like obsessed\nwith microphones as a kid sang on the\nchoir even when I was like a like three\nmy mom was an usher and she would um\nafter church like I would cry until she\nhelped me up to the mic so I could I\njust like I like it I really respect it\nit's powerful it amplifies your voice\npeople listen to it like so intimately\nin a performance setting even down like\npeople are listening to this through\nheadphones like you know it's like so\npersonal uh and so like my whole life\nI've kind of always felt that way I've\nalways filmed things I've always\nwritten I've always\num\nI've always performed uh and and then I\nfought against it I think for a period I\nwas really encouraged by a friend to\nmake the leap and move to LA and do that\nI lived here for like 10 years\num and uh I thought it was like arrogant\nbecause I do think asking for people's\nattention is precious like I try not to\nbe like super precious in my work but\nlike\nasking for their time like doing a show\nif I'm doing a show and I put up tickets\nand people spend money for tickets and\nthen they drive out to the venue and\nthey sit there and they wait for you and\nthen they listen to you like that's\nthat's asking a lot and so especially\nrecently like just like respect that\nmore you know like like I think I have\nthe respect that has been growing in me\nsince childhood for the nudging of a\nfriend got me out to LA but yeah it was\nuh yeah yeah I love performance I I love\nhearing that because I feel the same way\nthat you know some some people listen to\nthis podcast every day so they listen to\nthe two new episodes and then they'll\nlisten to old episodes yeah I'm thinking\nsometimes I'm in people's ears every\nweek yeah five to seven hours a week and\nI'm thinking that is so I'm so fortunate\nright like there's so much gratitude\naround that that someone allows you into\ntheir whether you're walking the dog\nright now whether you're cooking whether\nyou're editing whether you're cleaning\nwhatever you're doing at home right now\nand\nyou said that that you've always had\nthat kind of like that belief that\nhaving someone's ears or eyes or money\nor them turning up is is precious tell\nme about then your how does that lead\ninto your creative process because I\nfeel like for me knowing that I just\nfinished writing my second book it took\nme two years to write it and I put a lot\nof effort into it and I know that when\nI've written a book and it's taken two\nyears of my life to write it I'm putting\nit out I have to the creative effort is\nso high yeah because a the book pages\ndon't change you can't edit those pages\nonce wow and someone's going to take\ntheir time it takes like potentially\nlike written words written word is so I\nalways thought it's crazy that Twitter\nuses the word publish right because like\nit's like it induces in me such anxiety\njust thinking about the how permanent it\nis in placing things out there that you\ncan't get back and like uh that's why\nlike\nif I'm gonna perform I think it's like I\nI don't do social media because\nI would like to put all of that energy\nand I don't even say I don't do social\nmedia even that in itself could be a\ngrand performance I mean I look like\nKanye is an incredible\nperform like you know uh like it is very\nwarhol-ish in in that like it's\nspectacle to use uh important peel word\num but uh you know that's its own art\nform it can be its own art form but but\nlike I put all of my energy into like\nI'm a comedian and I make specials and I\nmake television programming or whatever\nprograms I make uh movies occasionally\nuh and and whenever I'm doing that I\nwould only like for all of my energy and\nall of my thoughts to go to that yeah\nand and then present that I know I'm\nkind of repeating myself going deeper\ninto it yeah we're going deeper into it\nand and what your creative process like\nshe's saying you put all of your energy\nbut like when you're building a special\nor one of those TV shows like how do you\neven start like where where's the\nprocess what's the starting point like\nhow do you get in spite of the beginning\nof it um I mean it's a spark of\nsomething you know something a lot of\ntimes like anger I think I started this\nwow just like a little angry then just\nstarted performing doing clubs and then\nsolo shows and then uh you know\npreparing to do it for television and\nlike like I do stand up for specials I\nthink at my core that's like like I\nthink my attention reads better in that\nMedium yeah and uh working backward from\nwhat that is then you know take the\nwriting and like form a show and like it\njust kind of happened this happened my\nlast special it happened really fast\num just frustrations with secrets and\nand feeling too old to keep them in into\nyou know like I didn't feel like an\nadult I didn't feel like I had control\nof my own life and so that you know\ncreated a lot of urgency to find a way\nto resolve that in art is just that\nattempt like make a special and that's\nlike my attempt yeah I'm sorry I'm\nprobably no no no I mean that's a great\nanswer to hear the that honestly that's\nthat's not I'm I'm speaking I'm trying\nnot to be like evasive about it it\nreally is just like it's I've been\nwriting for years like like in in and\nI'm always writing sometimes that\nbecomes a show sometimes it becomes\nsomething that like it's mostly like\nmost of creating is just a bunch of like\ntrying and failing that no one sees you\nknow and like uh you know failing in my\nown writing feeling in my own head over\nand over and over and over again and\nlike trying to make something write a\nshow you know\num structure a show yeah yeah but I love\nwhat you said that anger or frustration\nwith your own identity and your secrets\nI mean that that whole concept\nis so real I think for so many of us\nwhatever that secret may be whatever\nthat identity may be personally I say to\nlike you know my friends like I really\nthink like everybody's in the closet\nabout something yeah right there's a\nthing shame is such a powerful emotion a\nstrong I mean plenty of books about just\nhow it can dictate the course of your\nlife and your actions and your behavior\nand so much is driven by shame and so\nmuch of who we are is just our attempts\nto hide that little piece of ourselves\nthat can never be seen\num at least it's been a common\nexperience amongst people I've talked to\nand friends I'm sure you get a high\nvolume of totally of it and so yeah it\nwas um exciting and really scary to try\nand make something that dealt with that\nhead on and that's how I've been feeling\nin my personal life just\neven though it's kind of a blur between\nmy work and my personal life now\num but I've been trying to have\nconversations that I'd never had and\ntrying to deal with shame and trying to\nrestructure my relationship with God wow\nyou know like like am I the funniest\ncomedian you've had on the show\nI'm the funniest right okay that's a\nscary question\nI love that you went in that direction\nbecause I think that naturally shame is\none of those topics that isn't talked\nabout a lot publicly yeah so they even\nbring it up in a podcast is is great\nbecause we can actually talk about it\nbut I find like we also live in a\nculture where shaming has become more\nnormal right so we're talking about a\ntime when we've realized how powerful\nshame is as an emotion and how much it\nlimits us from truly being ourselves at\nthe same time shaming or cancel culture\nis is growing at the same time how do\nyou mean I feel like today we point more\nfingers at others because we know more\nof what others are doing we are more\nlikely to tear someone down because we\ncan whereas in the past you wouldn't\nhave access to do that you might do it\nin your dining table or you might do it\non your couch at home yeah you didn't\nhave the ability to go on social media\nand leave hate comments or whatever\ninteresting that you're saying that at\nthe same time as you're saying that hey\nwe need you know shame is holding people\nback from being themselves we're also\nshaming others more I guess well we have\nmore opportunity to yeah yeah yeah yeah\nwe have an opportunity to speak a lot\nyeah\nit's it's it's it's so much of that so\nmuch of that and um to speak constantly\nand emotionally you know it's it's hard\nto like have intention in every tweet in\nevery post and every should we is the\nquestion yeah yeah well it's it's even\nmore powerful than the word spoken in a\nprivate setting you know because it's\nsomething that\nis even if you have one follower you\nknow it has the potential of being\nseen and expressed amongst others so\nlike you know your intention reads and\nand\nyeah and and I question that a lot I\nmean I mean we could go down and on for\nhours and hours about like its effect on\nus and like you know even just thinking\nabout\neven myself when I'm on like Instagram\non my little private IG right I I you\nknow I have a decent group of friends\nthat I follow\num and it's just it's so abnormal to\ncatch up or have the illusion of\ncatching up with all of them you know\nlike constantly all like on Loop there\nare people sometimes that I see that I\nfeel like I've seen but I haven't\nactually had that experience with them\nI've only had like this experience with\nthe representative that's you know uh uh\nyou know like like on close friends or\nwhatever you know and and\nyeah it's just not like\nexpressing that much like I I have this\ntheory that we all are kind of becoming\nour own News Channel like we're all the\nnews and we have to we're all CNN or fox\nor whatever and we all have to fill the\ntime like we have to fill the space like\nyou like and the more you do it the more\ninclined you are to do it and again it's\njust hard to keep that married to\nintention you know like the sheer volume\nif you just speak if I wake up in the\nmorning I just speak all day and I never\npause\nI I it would be difficult to promise\nthat everything I say would have as much\nintention yeah because just the sheer\nvolume yep I like that theory I like\nthat theory a lot that's cool because I\nwent to someone's house once and it's\nwithout a doubt the coolest house I've\never been to this is a very cool house\nso you're saying that from a very cool\nhouse no but this was like this is like\nand and I'm saying it's a cool house not\nbecause of the building not because of\nthe Grandeur not big and same with this\nI don't think that's what why I think I\nlike my own house was because of what he\nhad in it so he had a whole wall\nand he called it the fake news wall\nbecause it was every piece of news that\nwas published before they knew the time\nso back in the day if a newspaper was\nbeing printed if a game wasn't over\nthey'd have to print the news with who\nwas winning at the time wow in hope that\nwow right so wow so all of this whether\nit was people winning games whether it's\nvotes whether whatever it was it was\nlike articles that had been printed\nbefore the fact wow so he had all of it\nin America like all these big and I was\nthinking this is fascinating and what\nyou're saying right now is that without\nintention\na lot of what we create is fake news in\nour own little news channels yeah well\nwell because things change you know\nyou're you're\nuh my opinion on an album\nfor instance even just something as\ntrivial as like you know my my feelings\ntoward a song or no whatever like it\nchanges it changes over the course of a\nweek it changes through how I've\nlistened to it you know I imagine if I\nwere just talking publicly about\nKendrick's last album I I which I went\nfrom not understanding to not liking to\nonly liking the interludes to then\nlistening to it while I was getting a\nMandy Petty and I turned the volume\nhalfway down so I could like actually\nlike hear the words I had to focus on\nthe word something about like the lower\nvolume yeah made me pay attention more\nand like hearing what he was saying and\nthen being in love with the album and\nthose tweets would have been a roller\ncoaster like it's just like of emotion\nif I just like if I put that out like\nconstantly because your thoughts towards\nsomething should like change and evolve\nand like sometimes it may take a little\nwhile to reach stable ground on and some\npeople would argue that the journey is\nauthenticity yes but but what is what is\nauthenticity to you as a comedian as\nsomeone who's like the theories that you\njust said like how do you how do you\ndefine what is authentic and real and\nwhat what isn't for you I I try and a\nlot of things are true right like you\ncan go I could I was presenting a lot of\ntrue things right like things that I\nthought were hard facts or perspective\nthat people wouldn't want to say out\nloud or be able to tolerate and and you\nknow I did believe it and it was true\nbut it wasn't like in my eyes the most\ncompelling version of of the truth I I\nfound like now like when working I I run\ntoward things I'm afraid of and that\nthat have personal consequence\nin my life so talking about me because I\nnever really talked about myself before\nnever considered myself a Storyteller\num and this is something I'm in many\nways making art while learning in real\ntime but but it is and has become my\nlive show just like this kind of\npersonal exploration not just that\nthings that bring me shame things like\nand and again it's hard to talk about\nthe show yeah only because I'm sure I'm\nmaking it so it I I must give the the\ncaveat that it's actually funnier than\nI've been but I I try and keep it\ncompelling you know like I'm trying to\nkeep stakes in the act and like tension\nthere like that's my new focus is you\nknow both says I'll like give the\naudience a lot like a more like more\ngiving and I have more need of uh for\nthem now more than ever and I like that\nexperience so yeah yeah yeah yeah it's\nreally personal now like it's it's the\nthings that are dangerous to me like the\nEvil Knievel things are like my feelings\ntoward you know myself or my feelings\ntoward you know\nrelationships that I have what was what\nwas the first thing you think you ever\ncombated through that our exploration\ninternally as a fear like I love that\nidea that your storytelling now or your\nspecials they're a exploration of\nsomething you're scared of what was the\nfirst ever thing do you remember that\nyou were scared of I mean no that's I I\nkind of baby stepped into my last\nproject right uh so\nI I was like I made these documentaries\nuh for HBO where I went home and I was\nconfronting like my my\nfather's adultery and my mother's\nforgiveness of him and I tried to come\nout to my mom but I did it in a very uh\nit it was fearful so like I was like I\nhooked up with dudes before like just\nlike kind of waiting for a reaction you\nknow and it wasn't full truth and then\nyou know\nsometime later I like came out to my\nfamily and it had\nstill resonating consequences uh to that\nuh it affected our relationship in a\nreal way there's a lot of uh anxiety and\nnot speaking of kind of separated myself\nfrom my family a lot recently\num I only share because I'm still in\nthat part of the process I want to be\nhonest about it I don't know you know\nlike 100 like and I pray that it gets\nbetter and we should talk later about\nwhat prayer means to me but yeah but but\nit's um\nyou know it great again like kind of\npersonal consequence and so my last\nspecial rathaniel was\nme yeah\nyou know really kind of drawing a Line\nin the Sand with my family coming out\npublicly contending with my my father's\nadultery its effect on me the kind of\ngenerational trauma caused by adultery\ncaused by having other kids outside the\nmarriage that were kept secrets and how\njust years of Secrets like kind of\npress this and repressed me into a liar\nyou know not I enable a liar and unable\nto tell my own truth\nand so I look at the special as being\num the the synopsis could read like on\nHBO like man afraid of heights jumps out\nof an airplane for the first time yeah\nlike that was my last special like that\nwas the the intention was doing the\nscariest thing I could imagine I never\nthought I would ever come out I was\nafraid\nof the Public's reaction I was mostly\nafraid of my mother's that that was the\nthe feet walking on to the stage and\ndoing it yeah that's I mean that even\njust hearing you say that I mean that is\nso inspiring as a as a creative person\nlike to hear that\nyour creative impetus or intention or\nprocess is to confront of fear a shame\nsomething that difficult of course\nyou're doing it through comedy which is\neven harder in one sense because you're\nmaking these extremely deep traumatic\nevents\nyou know light-hearted to some degree\nwhere people are able to be entertained\nbut the thing is what I found with\naudiences is that when I go when I share\nthings about are personal to me\num no matter what the danger enough said\nthings that are I mean this is happening\nin real time and like it's like tweets\nlike our art is capturing a moment in\ntime that's why I try and focus all the\nenergy on one thing like my my special\nis just one IG live yeah you know what I\nmean like it's like it's like the one\nthing that I focused on I found that\nwhen I when it's personal yeah it's not\nthe same audiences like you can't like\nI'm talking about how I feel I'm talking\nabout me I'm talking about things I went\nthrough and how that developed this\nperspective right that's all truthful\num is different than if I'm just like\ntalking about which you you can't do I\nI'm all for\nwhether you like it or not kind of\nComedy Free Speech you have every right\nto do that like in comedians do that and\nI did that I mean most of my career but\nstill up until recently was a lot of\nthat trying to say the thing I like to\nthink of mine was more\nintellectual but that's my own\negotistical argument for it but you know\nbut now I'm talking about me and when\nI'm talking about me like audiences\nreact with empathy or compassion even\nwhen I say sometimes I say like some\nWild Things\nyou know but it's mine it's personal\nright that's that's different you have\nownership over how you feel you know and\nand that's what I want my art to be just\nlike how I feel right now just like a a\nan emotion like a pure intention bottled\nyeah yeah yeah a lot yeah I get that\nyou've you've said it's interesting\nthough your language is like full of\nlike intention truth like yeah and I\nalmost hate that I almost hate it\nbecause it's like these are powerful\nwords that obviously get overused and\nI'm sure I'm overusing I don't think you\nare but I like to wear a platform like I\nhate the word I don't think you're\noverusing them I I feel like\nI don't think you're overusing them from\nfrom at least what I'm I'm generating\nfrom this conversation like I guess I\nguess what I'm fascinated by is like\nwhat you said you said you were I think\nyou used the word and I could have got a\nword wrong but you said you're\nreconstructing your relationship with\nGod or reframing that yeah then you said\nlet me Define what prayer is to me yeah\nlet's do both those things you said I\npray it's in many ways one and the same\nbecause I think my entire life I kind of\nbelieved this but didn't have the\nlanguage to to articulate how I felt and\nthat is truly taking the Christianity\nthat I was taught growing up my whole\nlife\ninto church every Sunday even when my\nmama worked I went with my grandma sang\non the choir uh Sunday school class into\nregular service state after talking to\nthe parking lot full Church boy and\nlearning about God the man in the sky\nwho at you know\nyour requests can show you benevolence\nand at as consequence for your sins\npunish you right and I was um I was\ntaught\nabout this man\num and internalize this man and uh he\ndictated my actions and my words and my\nfear and\nI then I read this book\nuh by Eric Butterworth\num called discover the power within you\nand it helped me articulate how how I\nfelt which is\nif you take Christ's words as philosophy\nright like just like\num take away this\nhuman need to worship\nthe light and just listen\num in accepting your own Divinity and\nand by Divinity I don't want to be\nconfused because I think Blues sometimes\nnon-religious people I mean your you\nknow potential for to function fully\nthat's all something that Christ has\nsaid that you have you you have at Birth\nit is your right and you are essentially\nGod manifesting himself as Jay as Gerard\nyou know like it's I accept that I\naccept my own potential I realize that\nprayers are just affirmations that you\nare asking for what you already have I\nthink it's why like good advice feels\nfamiliar\nsomething you're like yes oh yes I knew\nthat yeah you know that's why you\nconnect with it that is so true and it's\nit is there you know and it's Divinity\nthat that we all have access to\num but it's always like the\nyou know practice that's rough right\nbecause it's easier it was easier for me\nI want to speak personally it was easier\nfor me to just accept a God that I can\nsin and then ask for forgiveness and you\nknow a Bible that I didn't fully\nunderstand and and just kind of accept\nthat there's this external Force\ndictating and\nit you know that kind the devil\nrelinquished me of responsibility for my\nown actions I was able to kind of back\naway from things that wasn't me that was\nthe devil you know and now by\ninternalizing though that that\nphilosophy and seeing it as philosophy I\nhad to remove the magic from the Bible\nright and this is what works for me and\nI'm saying it cautiously because I know\nlike I can still\nsee the ears of my mother perking up so\nI'm like yeah I'm saying that this is\nwhat what uh has helped me\num and and\njust like realizing that God is me\nfunctioning as I can you know and things\nfunction as they can't access to good\nlike we all have access to good even\nthrough tragedy uh even through pain you\nknow those words of the Bible become\ndifferent they hit a little different\nwhen you accept yourself as innately\ndivine right you know\num all things work for good for through\nGod who strengthens me you know like\nPhilippians is is something\noh I can use all of this for good I can\ntake what you know I can take the rubble\nor Things From the Ashes and make\nsomething new out of this and continue\nforward like with a sense of purpose\nwith a sense of Duty I I can form that\nyou know taking tragedy and we see it\nall the time like you know uh parents of\nchildren who've gone through tragedies\nor or you know people just with loved\nones who experience something and then\nthey take what's for been destroyed and\nthey make something new you know and and\nthat that is the Bible that's using your\nown innate power to move forward and\num that's the line between me and my\nmother that's been the line between me\nand the church my entire life I've\nalways wanted to believe that and it\nwasn't until I came out or even accepted\nlet's just say accept it who I was uh\nthat I\nuh was forced to then say okay well God\nhas taught to me\nis not accepting of me\nand I had to re-examine in order to not\ndestroy myself yeah I love hearing your\nthought process because it's so real\nlike you're so in it and as someone\nwho's created a piece of art based on a\nfear you've had to live through that\nfear again and again and again in the\ncreation process how did it feel did you\nfeel that making a piece of art on that\nrelinquished of fear and now you can\nmove on to another shame or another\nguilt or another fear or what was the\nwhat was it like yeah yeah does that\nmake sense yeah yeah and speaking of\nthat fear like I was like I did a few\nshows on the road in preparation for the\nspecial and like I was like coming out\nto audience members that knew me like\nevery night like like it was like a new\nit was like jumping off a cliff like\nyeah yeah\num and it was a lot but it is how I knew\nit's the direction I needed to go in\nbecause it did scare me and I you know\nI've learned to trust that that feeling\nisn't always that\nI'm going in the wrong direction but in\nfact that I'm going there's like a lot\nof\nfertile ground yeah yeah it's the the\nfear it just stays it just stays the\nwhole time the whole time until it's\nreleased and then you kind of release\nthe fear did you feel you released a\nfear when that happened or yeah in many\nways well in many ways because I feel\nmore truthful publicly now which feels\ngreat yeah that feels really really good\nyeah and so I don't have the fear of\nbeing found out in that way but there's\nstill I'm definitely still fighting\nthrough shame and how it's manifested\nitself in my life through\nyou know things\nreally like that I could call\nhypochondria or OCD or whatever but a\nreally like anxieties rooted in shame\nthat I'm working through and that I'm\ntrying to understand better myself and I\nfeel it like my job to explore that you\nknow so\nI kind of chased that feeling I don't\nrecommend it\nI was just about to say I was like how\ndo you recommend people do this because\nI think that whether you're a performer\nor not we all have to go through this\nprocess yeah yeah right yeah I do\nrecommend like for whatever it's worth\nme saying like that you run toward all\nof the things that you're afraid of in\nin a truthful way contend with it with\nan open mind I think that's very very\nimportant how did you do it in a way\nthat didn't break you or hurt you or\nbecause I think that's where people are\nscared of Shame and guilt because it\nfeels like a broken piece of glass yeah\nand so when you pick up a broken piece\nof glass you could get caught yeah so\npeople like oh it's just better to just\nshove it away later yeah I don't know\nand I'm still like you know I still like\nI feel like I'm still picking it up but\nbut good friends very very important in\nmy case\num and you know people that remind me\nwhere the ground is you know like yeah\nyeah you just get caught up in all of it\nall of it anxiety is real I'm I'm\nrecently admitting that I experience\nanxiety I I ran away from admitting that\nmuch of my life yeah I can relate to\nthat I remember\na few years ago\nmy mom would always tell me I think\nyou're stressed\nand I'd be like no I'm not stressed I'm\nfine and I didn't even want to admit it\nto myself so it's not that I was lying\nto her I was lying to myself I didn't\neven want to because I was scared that\nif I let that in\nthen that would change me somehow that\njust block me yeah yeah and I didn't\nrealize that and that you're weak\ntotally it's the thought that you're\nweak how dare you oh you're being\nconsumed by these or oh this small\nlittle thing is eating you up and it's\njust like yeah yeah exactly yeah and it\nis yeah it is yeah yeah and I had a\nfriend that I remember was going for\ndepression very early on and like this\nwhen we were much younger and I didn't I\nwas like how can you be depressed like\nyou've got nothing to be depressed you\nknow that kind of mindset yeah then you\ngo for something yourself and you go oh\nGod I experienced depression like yeah\nand I was scared of accepting it and it\ntook me it was the same for me it was\nthe weak aspect it was the aspect of no\nno no some people have it much worse\nlike what am I complaining about it was\nit was the shame that came with oh no\nbut I'm you know I if my mom thinks I'm\nstressed then she'll get stressed\nall of that and any excuse not to\ncorrect confront it right yeah yeah\nconfront it and I feel like you just\nkeep putting it off and now I've\nrealized that that\nI need to\ntalk to that feeling or emotion when it\narises because\nme putting it away just makes it get\nbigger and darker and deeper yeah and\nand that's what I find so interesting\ndoing it through ART because\nwhen you're putting it out in front of\nother people again now it's their mind\ntheir impression gets involved too like\nwhat they're gonna think of it yeah what\nis it right now if you said that there's\na fear right now or a shame or a guilt\nright now that you're trying to unpack\nnext like is there something that not\nthat you're working on specifically for\na new project but even just in your own\nlife yeah you know probably\num emotional blocks that like stopped me\nfrom being in like a healthy\nrelationship with with someone\num well you know and as someone who came\nout publicly later I I realized that\nthere are phases and things that I go\nthrough and that it's normal to go\nthrough it but but just understanding\nthose blocks\num has been interesting to me yeah as a\nway\num in dealing with the the things that\ndon't sound cool like give me an example\nwell only because not that I not even\nthat don't want to but but I understand\nI'm only respecting that on stage is a\ndifferent place yes that that allows me\nto say things\nI get it that like that like I may say\nsomething that I'm like well now we need\nanother hour yeah you know I'm like well\ndude can we can I explain everything\nthat led to that like you know like I\ndon't know\nI love that yeah yeah nothing I mean you\nknow just things that are personally\nscary to me you know like you know there\nare no bodies or anything but like but\nyou know there are like you know things\nthat have like emotional consequences\nthat that up um you know run from\nI like how simple you went back to it's\njust like good friends like you know\nfriends it just it sounds like such a\nbasic thing and I was we had some\nfriends over that I hadn't seen for\nyears this weekend and we were all just\nappreciating that as well in terms of I\nremember I I've been coaching people for\na long time\nand that was really what my work was\nbefore I did any of what I do today and\nall I ever met was people who were\nLonely at the Top like that was\nconsistent with my experience and so\nI would often say to myself that while\nI'm building my life I don't I want to\nmake sure that I build relationships at\nthe same time as build things and I\ndon't just mean like love and romantic I\nmean like friendships as you're saying\nand I've realized just how much time\nthat takes how much energy that takes\nhow much effort that takes but how\nfulfilling it is and it sounds so simple\nand it's so basic oh it's difficult yeah\nand it's almost\na lot of the things that drive you to be\nsuccessful are isolating yeah like it\nthere is a lot of accepted selfishness\neven amongst fragrant like I I at times\nhave been a horrible friend like a very\nselfish friend like I mean just like get\non the phone talk about me for an hour\nall right bye you know just like a\none-sided friend uh uh a friend who's\nused money to supplement connection a\nfriend who's like kept friends at Arms\ndistance so I could work or Focus or\nhowever I Justified it and I still do\nthat I still do that like that like like\nin in and I and I value\nmy work and so specifically in art like\nit's like licensed to sometimes indulge\nin like Behavior or in emotions that are\nharmful to relationships and I can't\ntell if that's\nlook it's not okay because it's like but\nit's like an occupation Hazard\noccupational hazard yeah yeah it's an\noccupational hazard it's like you're I\ndon't know I have to go there like I\nhave to go into this cave well I think\nthe part I find fascinating about it is\nthe awareness of it right I think the\nlack of awareness a lot of people may be\ndoing that but they don't even know why\nyeah whereas and and I can relate to a\nlot of that like I've I've definitely\nbeen very clear with\nfriends family things like that about\nwhat I can and can't do based on what\nI'm working on yeah but it's different\nwhen it's carved out when it's\ncommunicated yeah and when it's yeah and\nright it helps exactly it definitely\nhelps it definitely helps me like and\nthat's a part of honesty and not lying\nto yourself about what you're doing\nyou're being able to say okay like I\nused to be so late to work you know just\nbecause like I'm just in my head and\nlike I know how long it takes me to like\nshift gears and like I would lie to him\nabout I didn't realize I was lying but I\nwould like was starting at three yeah\nyou know and then like 5 30 I'm like\nokay I'm ready you know and he's and I'm\nwasting his time I'm being horrible it's\nnot even productive for me because like\nnow I'm trying to like work closely with\nsomeone who's like\nlike justifiably frustrated you know and\nso like just like learning to\ncommunicate even like oh look this is\nhow I'm feeling right now that's how I'm\nfeeling today yeah so I'm working on\nlike\nI don't even know if we're gonna get to\nit and he's like look then I'll make it\nas a loose plan exactly and I'll either\nsee you at three or in two weeks yeah\nyeah you know and that's what we\nAssociated communicating and that's what\nI I feel the same way I talk about in\nrelationships so with my wife for a long\ntime I'd always be like\nuh three next three nights this week I\njust need to spend time alone you can\nsay that or you can say hey these three\nnights I'm working on this thing which\nmeans I need some time and space yes\nthat's totally different to hey these\nthree nights I'm just going to be here\nyeah yeah and it takes a little bit more\ntime and energy and effort and this\nisn't about advice it's just about the\nidea of what you're saying that you're\nactually creating more issues for\nyourself by not communicating yes and\nyes the courage\nthat it takes has it just pays off like\nlike you just said your friends oh I'm\nclear now but saying the thing but\nsaying the things\npotentially awkward and it's not even\nthat a lot a lot of times like the\nbiggest conversations in my life the\nscariest ones aren't that won't even\nlead to like Devastation it just could\npotentially lead to like a moment of\ndiscomfort discomfort of cringe or\nwhatever and it's worth it it's worth it\nmy friends that I'm closest with have\ncall essentially have caught me out on a\nlie which is a difficult thing to do and\nwe survived it and we're closer because\nof it yeah that's impressive yeah that's\nimpressive yeah I mean because most\npeople can't take that but that's why it\ncomes back to awareness like even\nearlier you mentioned ego and it was\nlike even the ability to see your own\nego is a healthy sense of awareness I\nmean we're in this attention economy\nright now where like you said we talked\nabout this we started with this the idea\nthat everyone's to Grapple for people's\nattention people will even invent things\nin their life to get attention because\nit's so hard to get attention oh yeah\nwhen you're trying to not even get into\nraising their children on the internet\nlike people are like\ncamera like the children are like\nsleeping\nbut with that like the attention part\nlike how is it that\nthen in a world where then you're trying\nyou're saying that you're still you\nstill have to compete for attention but\nyou're trying to do it for fear and\nexploration and art like because to me\nthat's like interesting to me it's\ninteresting because it's scary and it's\nlike yeah\nfor me and like not only respecting\npeople's time but realizing\nyou know just how hard it is to get\nanyone's attention for a moment and\nto make people feel anything you know\nbecause that's also if you're inundated\nwith bad news even like you you know\npeople a either seek good news through\ntheir art or be like you know only a\nreally authentic version of something\ncan even resonate or have the potential\nto resonate with with a viewer or a\nlistener and and so you know I I respect\nit and I know it's hard so like that's\nwhy I like save it for when it's ready\nyou know even if it's a Daily Show if I\nwere doing a Daily Show I was still I\nwould just save it off for that night\nyou know like like just like\nbut that's just how again I say that\nwith the disclaimer with the\nnon-judgmental disclaimer of you know of\nsomeone who follows accounts on\nInstagram that I find funny or in some\nways inspirational or whatever but it's\nalways like a there's always like the\ntruth that like really gets me it's why\nI love sports yeah Sports is true I\nwatch I don't even watch sports but I\nwatch ESPN all day every day sports\ncenter around the world PTI like just\nlike like facts facts facts truth truth\ntruth\nopinions like plenty of opinions it's\nfunny yeah it's just an honest what's\nyour favorite sport\nwhatever oh right oh it doesn't even\ncare I also like straight things for gay\nreasons so like I'm like really obsessed\nwith the lighting of basketball\nthe stadium is like you know this arena\nis gorgeous you know like you know the\nGolden Light of the Garden or whatever\nlike I I'm uh but but I'm obsessed with\nthe production of it I'm obsessed with\nlike yeah you know that's the\nperformance I've never heard that Sports\nis true well it's a TV show like my you\nknow friends who really truly love\nsports like that but I'm like yeah the\nNBA is just like a long-running\ntelevision program yeah you know like\nMichael Jordan was one of my favorite\nstars of that program you got me to\nwatch it on TV you know like it's you\nknow a tour yeah it's a televised tour\nyeah that's I mean that's that's yeah\nthat's an interesting way to see it I\nmean I'm obsessed with soccer football\nyeah but the rules of performance when I\ngo to games you know it's like it's a\nfull show they're also trying to keep\nthe audience attention the whole time in\nAmerica it's a show in England yeah in\nEngland it's not like that oh no so do\nyou try Sports in England there is no\nentertainment but this\neven advertising in England seems so\nlike when you're going down like in\nLondon if you're walking down the Strand\nyeah part of what makes it gorgeous is\nthat it's just like these really like\nthese giant brick buildings that reflect\nlight well and and have no it's not a\nlot of ads yeah yeah it's just like\nclean yeah and sports is like that you\nwon't you see sponsors on shirts\nobviously and sponsors around the pitch\nbut yeah it's it's different like I I\nrealized that when I came to the US I\nwas like oh wow everything's\nentertainment everything you know not\njust the sport yeah yeah you guys do do\nthe giant soccer I don't like I mean\nsome of the jerseys are cool I don't\nlike it on the NBA jerseys it's like not\nworth the yeah the realistic yeah you\nmean Quicken Loans right here\nlike give a kid a clean like jersey for\nthe love of God um but uh yeah yeah it's\nlike I mean America's done it in a way\nthat's just so it's so part of the\nculture it's like even like movies you\nknow I've fought really hard in my movie\nto even keep just like Coke bottles or\nsomething because that is America like\nto me that looks American yeah you're\nlooking at a photo photograph of of New\nYork or L.A like in many places\nrecognize it but the advertisements like\nthe pure ubiquity of it totally yeah\nwhat's your take on I I guess as looking\nat I love how you have theories and\ninsights on all different Industries\nlooking at the advertising industry or\nlooking at product placement looking at\nthat like is there do you have any\ninteresting theories about how ads have\nchanged because obviously now we're\ngoing from targeted ads ads everywhere I\nmean you're off social media but like\nI'm just fascinated to hear your\nthoughts on advertising and attention\nlike and and why we fall for every time\nbecause yeah I'm susceptible to me too I\nlove it I love good I have an iPhone\niPhone phones aren't even the best\nphones but I bought one like I see\npixels and stuff I'm like that is\namazing\nwell I mean\nno\nwhat I'm gonna like text my friends from\nlike a green bubble\num but like it's because of the app like\nit it really so like Apple sold me on a\ndream and I'm a sucker who bought it\nsame and like and it's sleek and it's\ncool I mean they're obviously great\nqualities to whatever but like like I'm\nI'm very susceptible to things I'm just\nI'm susceptible to words and images just\nlike you know and so that's part of\nreason it's hard for me to see things\nbecause I know like it's a lot for me\nthat's why I have to like do the YouTube\nno ads yeah yeah\num I mean now it's an interesting thing\nlike you know it's a lot of brands that\nare like afraid of its customer I can\nreally like a lot of corporations that\nare very timidly putting friendly\ndiverse commercials for the you know and\nthey always wanted to appease everyone\nbut like now I think there's a lot of\ntimidity to it\num some of them are still creative you\nknow obviously Geico changed the world\nyeah definitely there should be some\ntype of an award for like just like yeah\nlike yeah that gecko should in like\nthing of the year like\nyeah time Gekko of the year because it's\nlike like I mean it did like it made\neverything not about the product yeah\nyou know like just like removed from\nwell I think that's my opinion my I I\nprobably have an interesting view on\nthis I love good advertising yeah yeah I\nrespect it yeah because I'm like if\nthat's if it's true obviously if it's\ntrue that's that's a big part of it but\nI love it when someone has thought about\nthe Aesthetics and someone has thought\nabout the presentation because I can\nrespect that that required a lot of\nbrain power right it required that\ninnate it required some inner potential\nyeah it didn't they didn't just go oh\nyeah I just turned up all right I mean\nroads like good advertising like\noh when I it's I also respect the\nEdward bernay's you know manipulation of\nit all right just like man you really\ngot me you really just but yeah but\nthere's something there is fascinating\nto see who had the ability to shift\nhuman behavior that is fascinating to\nobserve and I think if we observe that\nmore I think we wouldn't get as sucked\nin by it yeah right like because what\nwe're saying is we like good advertising\nbut we know when it's advertising yeah\nand so I'm not saying I I can I'm not\nsusceptible to it but I'm saying that\nbeing able to see what's working on me\nwell is helpful yeah it's just that\nexactly that that what you're being\npresented uh okay yeah this is a this is\nprobably a lot so the two parts one I'm\nperpetually trying to change my mother\nin in Tesla capacity for Change and her\nability to question the source hey is\nreligion as you've learned it something\nthat may have been manipulated over time\nand like are all of these things like\nthe Divine word of a Divine being or are\nthey influenced by Kings and politicians\nalike over the course of the 2000 years\nsince right uh so there's always that\nand so like I'm\nprobably to a degree that is unhealthy\ncynical and skeptical and definitely\nbelieve conspiracy uh a lot but I also\nthink that the belief of conspiracy is\ndangerous right like so so it's like\ntrying to find middle ground right it's\njust like because like the belief of\nconspiracy is like why we know\nanti-vaxxers right like it's just like\nevery everyone's like but Tuskegee\nexperiment but I'm like one that doesn't\nreally make sense because to me if the\ngovernment's intention was to control\nthe population then wouldn't they put\nthe thing in the vaccine that actually\nsaves you and kill everybody else but\nthat's a conspiracy that's a wild thing\nto say too but like but like but like\nit's just a rabbit hole of never-ending\nthings so it's and I get that it's\ndifficult to know truth and news source\nnow but like it's trying to find Middle\nGround between like uh having a\nrespectable\num I don't know your own internal checks\nand balances for the where you get your\ninformation and where you get the\ninformation that dictates your life and\nit's hard it's it's just plain yeah yeah\nit's hard I think today because it's\nlike it's exhausting yeah it's\nexhausting it's like where do I go like\nand and I don't and I and I want to be\nhonest and say there isn't a place to\nsay hey go to this website that gives\nyou the best news because yeah there\nisn't like you know and so you're always\ngoing to have that and I I wonder how\nyou feel you'll definitely be less happy\nyeah like that that's a thing like with\ninformation you'll be less but I think\nwe're all less happy anyway because\nwe're receiving so much information\nanyway yeah so you might as well like\nreceive information that forces you to\nself-examine correct yourself explore so\nit's like we're inundated with it anyway\nyeah if you can make time for it\nabsolutely yeah and which everyone\nobviously is but we make time yeah you\nknow what I mean like we do make time\nlike the busiest person like like you\nknow all my friends and I know that I\nhave like the luxury of not having a day\njob it's half a luxury because I do need\nto be busy to not drive myself crazy but\nlike you know those I know that are like\nworking like 12 hour 14 hour shifts but\nstill find time to like be inundated\nwith information you know what I mean\nlike in a lot of it's numbing and again\nit is exhausting but it does lead to I\nthink a healthier life yeah yeah you\nknow like self-awareness and being able\nto agree it's my mother's fearful of the\nground that she's been walking on being\nmoved and uh and uh and I get that but\nyou know not I just wish it wasn't at\nthe sacrifice of of self-exploration\nwell I think that you just hit on\nsomething really powerful like for a\nlong time I believe that what people\nmost needed\nwas care and love and I started to\nrealize that for most people they\nweren't searching for that they're\nsearching for safety safety and an\nideology safety and a relationship\nSafety and Security and stability is\nwhat people are looking for and so the\nchallenge with\nconfidently exploring an emotion or an\nideology feels unsafe yes because it\nmakes you question what you're standing\non everything everything but that\nrequires you to recognize that it's more\nunsafe to not examine yes what you think\nyes yeah that's but that's a giant leap\nthat's a giant lead it's a very very\ngiant leap and and it's like it's easier\nto live under the the law of platitudes\nyou know and not explore how do you find\nas a\nas obviously like as a comedian then as\nan actor right and like you're directing\nyou're you're creating like how does\nthat help you explore the truth\ndifferently or what is that doing that's\ndifferent for you personally because\nobviously now we just we've literally\njust been extrapolating how you do this\nas a comedian and how you do this in\nyour work but then acting and directing\nand creating is totally different right\nyeah yeah well I mean you've been\nplaying your parts of yours I've been\ndoing that and I'm trying to do less of\nthat I I don't want to be a\nmulti-hyphenate I'm not necessarily\nchasing man I I do think that I have a\nskill in multiple things but I would\nlike to create focused work and and and\nso even like acting and directing my my\nlast movie is is a is something that I\nwould never do again and and I'm very\nthankful I believe we pulled it off and\nmade something that can like resonate\nwith people that I would rather focus on\none thing I think that's important you\nknow even like the idea of like egot is\ncool but I would rather be the best at\none of those things yeah you know what I\nmean like like but they do all uh have\none thing in common and that's like\nfinding truth and as an actor uh I do\nbelieve the more I've explored my\nemotions and walls I started doing\npsychoanalysis a couple years ago and\nit's been very helpful letting me find\nthe thought underneath the thought yeah\nand and actively get in in touch with\nintention right and acting is believing\nand it's easier to get in touch with\nintention when I've explored them you\nknow and and I have more access to uh\ndifferent intention now yeah\num uh and so I am excited to act more uh\nnow I I feel like my whole career is you\nknow just been me learning and building\nup until uh and even it will continue to\nbe that but recently I feel like I've\nhad more access to the truth and and\nmade like a conscious decision to do\nthat going forward or at least to try\num so so I think that would make\nwhatever I'm doing better yeah but yeah\nsure that's like the Common Thread yeah\nI felt that because even the idea in the\nmovie of like two men making a suicide\npact yeah like that concept only works\nif you play it truthfully people were\nafraid of that movie uh on the count of\nthree was very hard to get financed\nnobody wanted to do it you know very\nluckily found two that what was the\nreason people don't like making movies\nwell well one because with comedy it's\nwith the assumption that it isn't\ntruthful and that it will be uh made fun\nof and just dismissed and made light of\nright and I like my show and like I've\nalways believed that you can find like a\nlot of humor while taking things\nseriously you know like and to me that's\nthe the best humor like my favorite\nmovies even the movies I think are the\nfunniest you know like you know watching\na uh Coen Brothers movie or safety\nBrothers movie or even directors who\ndon't have a brother uh uh they're funny\nbecause it's so real it's hyper real\nthat's my taste in my sense of humor to\nme count of three is like because of the\nstakes of it being your last day on\nEarth it's actually aspirational in a\nway you know that allows itself to be\nvery very very very very funny because\nit's like you know it's sincere they\nreally think this is the end these two\nthese two characters Kevin about really\nbelieve that and we take seriously the\nreasons they're there and it just makes\na a product that keeps my attention I\nthink I think people have respected it\nand respect the film uh more because it\ntakes depression seriously it takes\ntreatment of it seriously and it takes\nseeing suicide as a resolution seriously\nand we weren't afraid to to treat the\naudience like the you know if you've\nexperienced this if you've had these\nthoughts like one you know I do believe\nthat it can be triggering so it is\nimportant to know yourself\nwhen going into it but I do think people\nwho have and I've now been able to talk\nto people and and read things that\npeople have written about uh going\nthrough depression having suicidal\nideations and even attempts and\nconnecting with the film in a way that\nthey didn't expect because it was\ntruthful you know and that was important\nand laughing at it because it was\ntruthful yeah\num and so\nyou know that's always the gamble I'm\nwilling to take that like like being\ntruthful treating my audience as as\nadults will pay off yeah yeah it was\nhard it was really hard no one like it\ncost me a lot my own money like went\nbroke making the movie you know what I\nmean like like it was um it was really\nreally hard but really worth it really\nwork even just as a an artistic\nstatement of of fearlessness to explore\nit was worth it I mean you know just\nI'd seen your work and I think when you\nsit down with someone and this is why I\ndo the podcast it's like to really hear\nabout why they do it\nand then you get a deeper appreciation\nof what someone does when you know why\nthey do it and how they think about it\nand how far they go off the edge to do\nit and\nI I just find you really inspiring on in\nin a different way than than\nI'd usually imagine with with comedy\nbecause it's not just entertainment it's\nnot just\ngalvanizing a crowd it's not holding\nattention it's it's like the ability to\nencourage us all to move in the\ndirection of our fears yeah yeah yeah\nand you're doing that whether you're\nsaying that or yeah or not that's what I\nfeel encouraged to do through your work\nI I really appreciate you saying that my\nfriend Bo always says that like I love\nthe access to fearlessness right and\nlike I'm trying to make things that\nreport on these moments where I gain\naccess to yeah like like it's yeah it's\nalmost like journalism it's really yeah\nit's really powerful it's it's super\npowerful I mean I I feel moved by it\npersonally because it helps me think\nabout\nhow if that's your intention behind the\nwork you're doing\nthat's the same as any other and if\nsomeone has the intention of improving\npeople's lives that's exactly what\nthat's doing yeah simply by that shift\nbecause\nyeah whatever we're scared of is holding\nus back in so many ways and and you know\nthat's a basic thing we all know but\nit's very rarely explored in content as\nthe sole intention yeah like it's you\nknow yeah yeah people are thinking how\ndo we make this make money or how do we\nmake this make people laugh or how do we\nmake this and those are all like\nyeah yeah it's it's the it's the thing\nthat most has my uh attention attention\nyeah right like it's like it's like\nall right there's a monster under the\nbed okay well I could sit here I could\neat popcorn I could watch TV I can think\nabout anything else everything in my\nlife is about this monster\nlike until I look and I want to make art\nabout looking yeah yeah yeah yeah I love\nthat I love that Jared it's been so\nawesome talking to you this is great\ntaking the time this isn't I mean I'm\nI'm genuinely like this has been one of\nthe most fun conversations I've had in a\nlong time and it's because the reason\nwhy I do this for myself is I love\nsitting down with people where I don't\nknow where things are going like I don't\nknow where the conversation is going to\ngo yeah yeah it's fun and that's what I\nenjoy so much because I was like I just\nwant to get to know this fascinating\nhuman I like that when he's talking to\nyou and yeah yeah no it feels free\nassociative and therapeutic\ntruth so I really appreciate you and you\nhave beautiful eyes that's what it does\nthat's almost too powerful I had to look\naway a couple times I love it I love the\nsound of your voice\nand I'll read\nI'm in you let me know uh but Gerard we\nend every episode with the final five\nthis is a Fast Five so the questions\nhave to be answered in one word or one\nsentence maximum wow so one word to one\nsentence okay all right the first\nquestion is what is the best advice\nyou've ever received don't take advice\nyeah uh what is the worst advice you've\never received listen to him\n[Laughter]\nI think we already answered this through\nthe podcast but I always liked that uh\nhow would you describe your current\nPurpose with what you're doing fine\ntruth love that uh question number four\nis what is something that you used to\nvalue that you don't value anymore\nprivacy\nhmm why did there I'm gonna go off peace\nthat's a really interesting answer yeah\nuh you didn't used to Value privacy\nbefore what made you start to Value it\nlike um I I realized that a lot of the\nthings that I wanted to be private were\nbecause I was ashamed of them so I\nrealized that a lot of like people will\nshare anything and quickly I'll tell\nthem yeah please I want to know sorry\nabout like my father that kind of\nrepresents this thought like my my\nfather uh called me and asked me one day\nlike if I was doing stand up again and\nit's like so you you're gonna make\nanother special and I was like yeah why\nhe was like he was like you're gonna\ntalk about me in it I was like why why\nand he said because you're mean and it\nhurts my feelings and I was like why\nlike what how am I mean and he was like\nyou know you put our business out there\nlike you talk about family business I\ntalk about like his you know the kids\nthat he's had that were a secret for\nmany years and my sexuality and and like\nand I'm like one you had all these kids\nlike you put you made a public like you\nhad children like you made a public you\ncall it that you call it put in our\nbusiness out there because you're\nashamed of it my father this is a man\nwho will talk to any stranger who will\nlisten in an IHOP Lobby about like his\nopen heart surgery and like any private\npersonal like talk about his medical\nhistory would anybody will tell everyone\nhis son has a television show and his\nhome address and like but this is\nprivate it's like no this is shameful\nlike this is something you haven't\ncontended with like like just thinking\nabout what privacy means right what I\nfind fascinating about that is how does\nyour have I'm going to this is not a\nFast Five now we get to the fifth one\nlast but how do you find that as someone\nwho's had to go through their shame go\nthrough that uncover it\nhow do you extend that same process to\nyour father and mother and other people\nyou meet because now you know how hard\nit is to do that and when you see their\nresistance and reluctance to do it how\ndoes that change how you feel about them\nwith their shame it's hard to be around\nit's hard to be around and and I realize\nthat in some ways extreme and\nin some ways it's a luxury to be able to\nlike not talk to certain people in my\nlife because there are kids who feel\nthat way around their parents and and\nI wouldn't suggest that they run away\nfrom home you know what I mean like like\nbut like uh so there are people who have\njobs and reasons that it is they can't\nbe fully truthful and and I and I do\nrespect that but I it's hard for me\nso again the monster under the bed if\nthere's one thing that is hard to talk\nabout then it's hard for me to talk\nabout anything\nand and so right now is my family my\nmother and my father come to terms with\nme being gay\nit's difficult to talk to them because\nwe can talk about everything else you\nknow they they watch my special and like\nto me like the most like the part that\naches is a part of like me talking about\ncoming out and my struggles of course\nyeah be with them uh and that was the\npart on the first phone call and even\nstill like they didn't even acknowledge\nthey they went like oh I know I know you\nwent through a lot carrying your\nfather's secrets and and that type of\nthing but they didn't talk about\nthat because they don't want to and and\nwe can and I could have a very pleasant\nrelationship with them\num and that would just feel excruciating\nto me right now right now and maybe I'll\nI don't know if I'll become numb or\nbecome calloused and I I always pray\nthat I don't become bitter yeah you know\num but it's hard it's hard to extend\nbecause you can't extend you can't make\neveryone truthful or say the things that\nyou want them to say of course but I am\nyou know trying to control\nuh the relationships I have based on my\nability\nto be truthful with you and I love that\nyou're giving yourself the permission to\ndo that because I think that is the step\nprocess towards\nwhatever Evolution it goes on it's like\nwhen we don't give ourselves permission\nto be in the uncomfortable of like well\nI can't talk about this so I can't talk\nabout anything else we're like no I\ndon't want to be that because that makes\nme a bad person right we have shame\naround that yeah yeah yeah so no\npermission is a good it's a great word\nyeah yeah otherwise you just live in the\ncycle it's crazy so you just repeat the\npast to stay in that jail yeah and you\nfeel a bitterness internally yes because\nyou never freed yourself yes yes yes you\nstayed yeah all right Fifth and final\nquestion of the whole interview okay is\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be I do believe that doing to\nothers stands you know I think that's\nprobably the it's the golden rule in in\nwhatever but like if that were somehow\nlaw do unto others yeah as you would\nhave done unto you from seeing the the\nDivinity in people to being truthful\nwith people like like the things that\nyou want you know I think you would give\nmore at least you know Gerard comic for\neveryone I hope this stuff many times we\nget to hang out yeah we should talk more\nI feel like I feel like there's still\nlike Pockets that we gotta yeah yeah\nyeah\nthis is the first to mention yeah\nthere's so many people gets and it's\nalways nice getting to lay the land of\nsomeone's foundational thinking and then\nget to learn more but thank you so much\nfor doing this any last messages\nanything you want oh no no that's\nfeeling great everyone has been\nlistening and watching back at home or\nwhether you're in the car or whether\nyou're at work wherever you are uh make\nsure you share what you learned what you\ntook away any insights that resonate\nwith you I think for me I'm being called\nto think about how I can be pulled to\nrelease any shame I have how I can have\nmore open conversations with my friends\nabout any guilt that I'm holding on to\nhow I can use art to move towards my\nfears as opposed to away from them I\nthink a lot of us think of r as an\nescape from my fears when actually they\ncan be an exploration as Gerard said\ntoday so I thank Gerard for joining us\ntoday thank you all I hope you share\nthis episode with someone who needs it\nuh but thank you for listening everyone\nthank you so much thank you thank you if\nyou love this episode you're going to\nlove my conversation with Matthew Hussey\non how to get over your ex and find true\nlove in your relationships people should\nbe compassionate to themselves but\nextend that compassion to your future\nself because truly extending your\ncompassion to your future self is doing\nsomething that gives him or her a shot\nat a happy and a peaceful life"
