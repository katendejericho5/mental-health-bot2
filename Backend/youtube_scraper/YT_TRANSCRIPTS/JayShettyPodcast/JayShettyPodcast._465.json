    "transcript": "life never stops teaching it is us who\nstop learning the day you stop learning\nis the day you start dying the\nbest-selling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nwhen you came up with this idea of\nmaking illness optional talk to me about\na bit about how you think that way of\ncourse because most people are trying to\nend illness or most people are trying to\navoid Illness but you talk about making\nit optional so let's talk about how you\ncreate these moonshots and create these\nideas you know to me the questions you\nask is the problem you solve so\nfundamentally asking the question is the\nmost uh I would say the best skill you\ncan ever learn as an entrepreneur but as\nan entrepreneur what most people somehow\nthink that if they do something small\nit's easier to get started and what I\nlearned is it is so much easier to do\nsomething audacious something that's\ngoing to change the trajectory of how\nhumanity is going to live something that\ncan impact the lives of billions of\npeople around the world and that's so\nmuch easier to do so every time I start\na new company I ask myself three\nquestions why this why now and why me\nand why this is really simple you start\nbackward and say God forbid I am\nactually successful in solving this\nproblem would it help a billion people\nlive a better life\nand the reason for that it's not just\nbecause the philanthropic thing to do it\nis really easy from a capitalistic point\nof view to see that if you can build any\nproduct any service that helps a billion\npeople live a better life you can create\na hundred billion dollar company but you\ndon't wake up in the morning and say I\nwant to create a 100 billion dollar\ncompany what should I do making money is\nsimply a byproduct of doing things that\nimprove people's life so I'm going to\nrepeat everything you do ask yourself\nhow is it making someone else's life\nbetter because if you do that they\nbecome your most loyal customer and if\nyou have most loyal customers you have a\ngreat business right but people somehow\nalways think I want to make money rather\nthan I want to do something that helps\npeople right yes yes that's why this so\nin the case of biome we started thinking\nthat you know we as Humanity are\nsuffering through this epidemic of\nchronic diseases right we call them with\ndifferent names diabetes obesity heart\ndisease depression anxiety you know call\nthem Parkinson's Alzheimer or God forbid\ncancer these are all the diseases\nyounger and younger people are getting\nthem and literally every one of us\nduring our lifetime is expected to have\nthese chronic diseases\nand it occurred to me that we as human\nhumans as haven't evolved in the last 50\nor 100 years it takes Millennials to\nchange human genes then why is it in the\nlast 1500 years this epidemic is growing\nand it occurred to me if it is actually\ngrowing there's got to be a way to\nactually slow it down and reverse it\nright and our thought was what if we can\nunderstand the human body at a molecular\nlevel and find a way to use\nguess what food as a medicine What A New\nConcept right to be able to actually\nunderstand what foods are good for you\nand what foods are not people say oh my\nGod such brilliant and I tell them that\nbrilliant idea came 2500 years ago when\nHippocrates says let food be thy\nmedicine right so I am not inventing\nanything I'm Reinventing yes and that's\nthe you know the beauty of the things so\nwe say look what if we can understand\nand make illness optional and why did we\nsay make illness optional because I\ndon't think I or you or anyone has power\nto eradicate chronic diseases but each\none of us has a power to do something\nabout ourselves that means being healthy\nis a choice and that means being sick is\na choice and that's how you make it\noptional by empowering each person to\nknow what they should be doing and what\nthey should not be doing right so now\nthe second part of that moonshot puzzle\nis why why now why now is very\ninteresting in a sense that you have to\nask yourself what had changed in the\nlast couple of years but more\nimportantly what do you expect to change\nin the next three to five years that\nwill allow you to solve this problem at\nscale in three to five years and more\nimportantly this problem couldn't have\nbeen solved five years ago because when\nsomething could have been done five\nyears ago that means the technology\nalready existed for someone to solve it\nand the fact it's not being solved is a\nvery different problem right so you see\ncan I intercept tomorrow's Technologies\nto solve tomorrow's problem rather than\nuse yesterday's technology to solve\ntomorrow's problem and then the most\nimportant question in my mind is why me\nand why me goes back to the question you\nask what question am I asking that is\ndifferent from what everyone else in the\nindustry is asking because as I said the\nquestions you ask is the problem you\nsolve so I want to give it a couple of\nframework here because that's me is Crux\nof why people fail so in my previous\ncompany Moon Express we were our mission\nis to go to the moon and settle on the\nmoon and someday we can talk about why\ndo that but\nevery time I say that we're going to go\nbecome a multi-planetary society\neveryone will ask the same question\nwhich is how are you going to grow the\nfood on the moon\nand to me that question is generally a\ngood question except the wrong question\nbecause when you ask a question how to\ngrow the food on the moon the only\nsolution is to find a way to grow the\nfood and what if you ask a slightly\ndifferent question that says why do we\neat food just by asking why do we eat\nfood we say oh only reason we need food\nis for energy and for our nutrition what\nare the different ways can we get energy\nplants get energy from photosynthesis a\nlot of bacteria who grow in radioactive\nnuclear waste they get from radiation\nthey get energy the point is now you\nhave many more ways of solving a problem\nthan simply growing the food that are\ndifferent so by asking slightly\ndifferent question you end up finding\nsolutions that no expert would have ever\nthought about because that was not the\nproblem they were solving right yes now\ncoming back to while the problem we were\ntrying to solve was finding the way to\nmake illness option or finding the way\nto solve of the chronic diseases we\nnotice that every expert was asking the\nsame question they want to know about\nwhat's in my DNA or my genes and somehow\nif I know your DNA your genes we can\nsolve the problem now I am not a doctor\nor a scientist it occurred to me like\nanyone else will tell you your DNA never\nchanges so I am born with my DNA that I\nget from my mom and dad now imagine\nsomebody did my DNA test and told me\nhere is what you should be eating God\nforbid I gained 200 pounds my DNA is\nstill the same should I keep eating the\nsame thing probably not now I get\ndiabetes my DNA is still the same should\nI change my diet one would say hope so\nbut DNA hasn't changed now I get heart\ndisease my DNA hasn't changed and then I\ndie and you were to look at my DNA 10\nyears after I die is still the same you\ncan look at the DNA of a dinosaur right\nso if DNA can't even tell you you're\ndead or alive how will it ever tell you\nyou're healthy or sick but what's\nalready changing is not your genes but\nyour gene expression call RNA or mRNA\nand we thought wow why can't we measure\nRNA we didn't know how to do it we\ndidn't even know it could be done but\nsimply asking the question we are not\ngoing to look at genes we're going to\nlook at your gene expression allowed us\nto look at the problems so differently\nand the second part that was very\ninteresting to me was I read a lot it's\njust like you just like our friend Jim\nquick or others we just read a lot and I\nwas reading all the scientific papers\nand it turns out every single disease is\nconnected to something called microbiome\nand for life of me I don't understand\nwhat this microbiome was and you can\nGoogle by the way Parkinson's and\nmicrobiome cancer and microbiome\nAlzheimer and microbiome diabetes and\nmicrobiome anything you want is\nconnected to microbiome and I'm thinking\nwhat is that if everyone believes\nthe diseases are caused or somehow\nimpacted by microbiome and the 10\ncompanies doing microbiome testing then\nwhy is this problem not getting solved\nso it's not a Eureka movement I'm\nthinking Naveen you are a this can\nbe a problem and then it occurred to me\nto go back to the first principle what\nquestion are they asking well it turns\nout Jay to date every single company\nthat looks at your microbiome is asking\nthe same question what organisms are in\nJail's gut what organisms are in\nnaveen's cut and they somehow thought\nthat will help you solve problem now not\nbeing an expert it occurred to me I\ndon't know what these organisms are they\nprobably like a tiny human beings in my\nmind right and I thought wow what if the\n10 000 different organism could be\nproducing the same thing that's making\nme sick so it's not about who they are\nbut what they are doing or the same\norganism can produce something good in\nyour gut environment in the same\norganism can produce something bad in my\nbad gut environment so take a person in\na put them in a good environment good\nbehavior put them in a bad environment\nbad behavior so our thought was what if\nwe can find out what they are doing and\nhow the changing our human gene\nexpression we can solve this problem\nright so punish the sin not the sinner\nas Gandhi said the idea was you know\nfocus on what is it they're doing that's\nwrong and then focus on that right and\nthat literally was the concept behind\nwhile\nit turns out all the story that we\ndidn't know how to do RNA testing and no\none has ever done it in fact no one does\nit today other than while because we\nfound the technology at Los Alamos\nNational Lab where they were doing a\nbiodefense project and this was one of\nthe project was to find out if we're\ngoing to protect our country against\nbioterrorism when the organisms are\nthere what they are producing so that's\nhow they can create antidote for it and\nthey had developed the Technologies and\nwe licensed the technology hired the\npeople and build this thing to help\nHumanity live better and that's the only\nreason they gave me the license because\nthey realize I am not simply building a\ncompany to make money I'm doing it for\nthe benefit of humanity and since our\ntaxpayer dollars will be spent and they\nsay that is a perfectly good application\nof that yeah absolutely absolutely and\nand I'm so glad I mean I've done the\ntest myself and it was the results were\nfantastic as well very useful very\ninsightful yeah Emmy and you know I mean\nwe tell you what's happening in your\nbody Jay right so we tell you what's\nyour biological age what's your immune\nhealth and I don't know if you did the\ntest recently it tells you your heart\nhealth it tells you your cognitive\nHealth it tells you your oral health\nyour dental health your gum health and\nit tells you everything that's happening\nin your body and then as you know it\ntells you don't eat these foods and here\nis why so for me it don't eat broccoli\nand Brussels is brought even though\neveryone thinks it's healthy and we say\nno your sulfide production is too high\ndon't eat it right or don't eat spinach\nbecause your oxalate production is not\ngood right now you can tell here are the\nfoods you should not eat and why here\nare the foods you should eat and why and\nthen we go step further don't take\nvitamin B3 because your uric acid\nproduction is too high or don't take\ncurcumin because your bile acid is too\nhigh but you do need 22 milligram of\nlycopen you do need 11 milligram of\nberberine you do need 27 milligram of\namylase and we go through every vitamin\nmineral herbs digestive enzyme amino\nacid probiotic and Prebiotic and guess\nwhat we built a robotic compounding\npharmacy where we make these capsule\nwith only the ingredients in the doses\nthat you need on the spot for each\nindividual and ship them to every month\nnow six months later they can do a\nretest so no longer is it working or\nit's not working it's no longer based on\nfaith it's based on fact right and so\nyou can see the progress you're making\nand I think to me what satisfies me most\nis we have now analyzed over 500\n000 people and there is not a day goes\nby where we don't get you know emails or\nmessages from people that you changed my\nlife I I sleep better I have lost weight\nI no longer have brain fog I have more\nenergy right I am no longer have you\nknow things like depression anxiety all\nthe things or even better skin people\nwho had acne or eczema and to me\nnot being a doctor and watching change\nhis people's life is what allows us to\ndo hard work every day yeah and just\nlike you I think Jay I get up every\nsingle day at 4am in my every day seven\ndays a week I get up at four a.m and I\njump out of the bed every day because I\nbelieve if I may use the word I think\nI'm doing God's work it gives me joy it\nbrings me that pleasure that things I am\ndoing is making people's life better\nyeah it's unbelievable no it's it's\nreally special and I know that that's\nalways been your mission and I want to\ngo backwards for people because I think\nwhen people hear about these incredible\nideas and that idea that you told us\nabout now the idea of\nasking the question of\nwhy do we need to eat like why do we\nneed food that's such a unique rare way\nof thinking\nwere you always like that in school was\nthat a way of thinking you developed and\nbuilt over time like let's go backwards\na little bit because I think the way you\napproach problems\nis\nso different and it is and hence why\nyou're saying that most people would ask\nlike how can you live on the moon so how\ndid you develop that ability was it\nsomething that was god-given you were\nborn with it is it something you\ndeveloped and where did you start to\ndevelop it and when well interesting\nthing is\nevery one of us had this idea that we\nare born with certain things and then\nit's easy to blame someone else for all\nyour problems I am like this because\nit's this in my genes this is what I was\ndealt with the bad cards right that is\nan excuse because remember your genes\nare not your destiny like we talked\nabout in your health it is your gene\nexpression you get to control your gene\nexpression by changing your environment\nyour environment controls your gene\nexpression even though people say like\noh I'm born with these genes and they\nare mutation that may cause Alzheimer's\nnow think about it for a second there\nare very very few diseases that are\ngenetic diseases and never want to\nundermine them they have a special name\nthey call rare genetic diseases and\nthere is a reason they call rare genetic\ndiseases is because they are rare most\nother diseases are not genetic diseases\nso when someone tells you have a gene\nthat is going to cause you Alzheimer's I\nasked them a simple question am I born\nwith that yes so this Gene is I am born\nwith it sits in my body for 60 years 70\nyears one day it wakes up and say I\nthink I completely forgot to wipe out\nyour memory I'm going to do that right\nnow can't possibly happen it has to\nchange expression of it that means there\nhas to be a trigger that causes it to do\nsomething and if you can take the\ntrigger away does it matter what genes\nyou have right yeah so point is don't\nblame anyone except yourself\nincluding I think I learned from you\ndon't tell someone my wife makes me\nangry or someone else makes me angry\nonly you have that power to make\nyourself angry right so coming back to\nanswer your question\nnurturing or the environment changes who\nyou become\nand most people want to know there is\nyou know is there a particular event\nthat happened that made you different\nright but as you and I both know\nlife is full of experiences every\ninteraction we have changes who we\nbecome\npeople think it's the last straw that\nbroke the camel back and we all know\nit's the straws before that it broke the\ncamel yeah right so my point I'm going\nto make is that in the simple words that\nevery day the people you surround\nyourself with changes the way you think\nso the most important thing you can do\nis to find the people who uplift you\npeople who believe in you people who\ninspire you to be better not simply tell\nyou you are good they push you to be\neven better right every day ask yourself\nam I better intellectually today than I\nwas yesterday am I emotionally better\nthan I was yesterday am I spiritually\nbetter than today than I was yesterday\nand grow every day yeah and and I\ncouldn't agree with you more I I'm\nreally glad though how you answered that\nquestion from a gene point of view I\ndidn't I didn't expect to go down that\nroad and I really like that context of\nhow to think about\nwho we are and who are becoming and and\nyou are right that it's not one event\nthat transforms our life or it's not one\nmoment but it's a collection of thoughts\nand a collection of people and\ncollection of ideas\nwhen you were young what did you think\nbig did you always have these lofty\ngoals or did you have to learn to do\nthat I guess is what I'm getting is\nbecause and and who were you exposed to\nlike when I grew up I always say that in\nmy area I didn't really grow up around\nanyone who inspired or motivated me in\nmy field of people I met but my dad\nwould give me the biographies of people\nlike Martin Luther King and Malcolm X\nand people like that and those people\nbecame the people that inspired me so\nmost the people that inspired me were in\nbooks yes they weren't anywhere else who\nwere those people for you where did you\ninteract with them how did you connect\nwith them and how did they change the\nway you thought you know obviously as\nyou know I grew up in India we were very\npoor we didn't have you know food to eat\nwe didn't have place to stay but the\nthing that none of us lack really is\nimagination and it really let your\nimagination run wild while everybody is\ntrying to continue into what who you are\nand Define you who you are and trying to\nprotect you by telling you what you\ncan't do right everyone will say oh you\nare born in a poor family your destiny\nis pre-written you can at the most\nbecome an accountant and go find a\ngovernment job that will actually be\nthere for you rest of your life anything\nyou're trying other than that is you're\ngoing down the wrong path and out of\npurely a good intention to protect you\nthey actually want to continue to say\nthat is not possible for you so they're\nlimiting your belief and what's really\ninteresting I found was my mom just\nwasn't un you know she's alive she's\njust unbelievable amount of faith in me\nso my dad will say you know you will\nnever go anywhere so why are you trying\nhere just go get the damn degree in\naccounting or something so you can have\na job and my mom says no no no he's very\nsmart he can do anything he wants and\nthen she would say sky is the limit and\nlater I realize in my life that Sky\ndoesn't exist sky is simply a figment of\nour imagination and what she was telling\nme was in her own way your imagination\nis the only thing that limits to what\nyou can do we create our own sky\nlike when you go from here to the Moon\nyou don't say Mom I just passed the sky\nthere is no sky so point is we create\nthese imaginary boundaries for ourselves\nI come from this background so I this is\nmy sky\nI'm a woman this is my sky I'm a brown\nperson this is my sky and everyone\ncreates the sky until you get there and\nyou realize that was all in my mind it\nnever existed right so when I was young\nI would look at the Moon and what really\ninteresting to me was I am looking at\nthe same object that the richest person\nin the world and he doesn't look at it\nany different than I can so I am that\nrichest person in the world because I\nhave the same power that they do and in\nmy mind it was about there's nothing\nthat I am sitting here when I look at\nthat star that anyone else can do it any\ndifferently than I can in fact I can\nlook at them better because I am sitting\nin a darkness and this car is so much\nmore beautiful than in a city without\nunder the light you can't even see the\nstars right as I came to United States\nand then I started to meet and learn\nfrom different people and as I continue\nto grow I started surround myself with\npeople who had you know even bigger so I\nthought I was a big fish in the small\npond until they realized there was a big\npond out there and I was a small fish\nand then I started grow again right and\nI think you know a lot of the people\nthat have you know inspired each one of\nus have been the people who have gone on\nto change the industry\nnow obviously you know today you and I\nprobably know most of them and we met\nthem but when I actually were being\ninspired I I knew their name but I never\nmet them now we get to meet with them\nand now you can at least look at them\nand sing how much they change your life\nbut I can tell you that the biggest\ninspiration for me\nour biggest Mentor for me has been my\nown life life never stops teaching it is\nus who stop learning so just every\nexperience we have if we keep an open\nmind we can learn from every single\nperson we meet even that homeless person\nif you can give him five minutes of your\ntime he will tell you about his life\nstory what got him into where he is and\nmaybe hopefully you will make that\nmistake yeah yeah yeah yeah it's I've\noften thought that the people that are\nalways learning in any situation\nnaturally succeed in in whatever\nEndeavor they have\nand\nwhen I'm hearing you speak about these\nideas which which resonate with me\ncompletely like very strongly\nI start thinking like today\nthe challenges that we're not always\nchoosing\neffectively in curating carefully who\ninfluences us because there's just so\nmuch influence I was reading a study the\nother day that said the average human is\nexposed to 74 gigabytes of information\nevery day\nthe average iPhone is 256 gigabytes and\na fancy iPhone is one terabyte yeah\nwhich means that 74 gigabytes a day you\nknow give it like less than four days\nand you're already at a full storage of\nan iPhone yes that's a lot of\ninformation and it's hard to know what's\nuseful what's useless what's a waste\nwhat's an investment because we're just\ninundated\nhow could you recommend to people to\nlearn to filter and choose what to give\nI'll give you and I'll give you a common\nexample like you know a couple of years\nago it was like everyone's like you have\nto be in nfts you have to do this you\nhave to like you know and then\neveryone's like oh you have to invest in\nthe stock market because now it's this\nand like then it's like oh you have to\nbe an entrepreneur it's like everyone's\ngetting oh now you have to hustle we're\nin Hustle culture and so you see this\nlike messaging fed message fat messaging\nthat just constantly pushes people yeah\nand because people don't know their own\nvalues and they're not sure about what\nthey really want from life it becomes\nvery easy to get distracted how would\nyou guide people into not getting\ndistracted and knowing what is right to\nfocus on well I think you go back and\nsaying\nwhy am I doing it let's assume what this\npicking thing you want whether it's the\nnft or the crypto or whatever yeah how\nis that what I'm going to do is going to\nimprove someone else's life would it\nimprove a billion people's life because\nI bought nft if the answer is no then\nwhy are you wasting your time right so\nto me the biggest thing to learn in life\nis curiosity if you ask me there's one\ngift you could give someone you love the\nmost and I hate to say that the biggest\nlove I have for anyone in this world\nprobably be your children I mean anyone\nI think right your children are the one\nthat you know they give you\nunconditional love and you give them\nunconditional love and the biggest gift\nyou can give them is that so our job as\na parent is not to take them to the\nwater and make them drink our job is to\nmake them thirsty how do you make them\nthirsty is make them intellectually\ncurious once you give the Curiosity to\nthe children\nguess what they will never stop learning\nthey will always be learning they'll\nalways find their water and they'll\nalways be drinking and that's your goal\nis to make them curious in what makes\nthem curious is to constantly think\nabout what is possible not what is not\npossible what if it was possible and the\ntwo most beautiful word in English\nlanguage are Imagine and what if imagine\nif this was possible what if I could do\nit right and that's it and then they'll\nconstantly and become like a child\nwhy why why it can't be done why why it\ncouldn't be done before right and asking\nwhy makes you curious and that's how\nallows you to dig deeper and deeper and\ndeeper if I may continue on that chart J\nyeah I want to talk about you know I\njust did I have three children and I\nwant to talk about them for many reasons\none is to show people what really\nmatters in life it's not just simply\nabout living the better world for our\nchildren it's also about leaving the\nbetter children for the world to\ncontinue to go where not only you get to\npush the humanity forward you actually\nhave trained them and made them curious\nenough for them to be able to continue\nto push the humanity forward right so I\nhave three children our oldest is 32. he\nwent to Wharton when he was 17 he\nstarted his first company and that was\nsimply about helping young entrepreneurs\nas a non-profit to help young\nentrepreneurs find mentors for them so\nthey can be successful and his reasoning\nwhat my dad brought me mentors and these\nkids did not have that opportunity so\nI'm going to create it for them now\nimagine what happened he could call\nanyone in the world and say I'm I want\nyou to help these young kids\nnobody sees no to helping someone in the\nturn he built one of the biggest Network\nhe could find of the most influential\npeople so when he started a for-profit\ncompany everyone wanted to be part of\nthis right in fact just today my son was\noldest was in CNBC in Bloomberg and\nannouncing that he's solving this\nproblem that all his all the kids of age\nwere suffering from I go there are two\nproblems\nI graduate I can get a job and generally\na decent enough job where I can actually\nfind an apartment but I don't have the\nmoney to pay first month rent last month\nland and security deposit and he said\nyou know what what if we don't have that\nand simply spend five dollars a month on\ninsurance and ensure the landlord so you\ndon't have to have a deposit and he\nstarted that company wow then he\nrealized that everyone was complaining\nand say that's great anchor we keep\nwasting our money on a rent we get\nnothing for it\nright I got to buy a home he started\nthis company called built Bilt build\nrewards and just I was posting on my\nInstagram he announced today he raised\n150 million at 1.5 billion pre-money\nvaluation that region of talking about\nnot the money is what he did is so\nphenomenal he came up with the concept\nof a credit card where you can put a\nrent on a credit card with no credit\ncard fees no annual fee normally when\nyou put something on a credit card you\npay three and a half two and a half\nthree percent he convinced the\nMasterCard to waive that fee for rent\nand then he's able to now earn points on\nsomething you haven't paid anything and\nyou can use the point to actually buy a\nhome down payment for a home or use one\nto one on any airlines on a hotel on\nExpedia on Amazon you can use the points\nto earn the points on rent and with no\ncredit cards okay what's happening\nlandlords love it because they are able\nto bill you on day one day two they have\nthe money you as a renter are not paying\na dime more and your 21 day float to pay\nyour credit card bill in turn you earn\nthe points that would completely wasted\nand now you can travel or you can use\nthem for next month rent or you can use\nthem a down payment on a home solving\nthe problem that impacted all these\npeople in turn he created a great\ncompany\nour daughter that's amazing our daughter\nPriyanka went to Stanford Stanford stamp\nfellow Stanford Mayfield fellow only\ncared about women's women's education\nWomen's Health First company she worked\nremoving gender bias from hiring using\nAI\nstarted a company called Avi evvy\nWomen's Health company and just today\nFast Company recognized as the fastest\nand the most disruptive company that she\nstarted year and a half ago right so she\nis completely changing at the idea of\nhow Women's Health what I did not\nrealize what she told me is until about\n20 years ago women weren't allowed to be\nin a clinical studies that means every\ndrug we have were never designed for\nwomen they only designed for men and no\nwonder these drugs don't even work for\nwomen because they were never on a\nclinical trial and she's changing that\nindustry right our youngest went to\nStanford became a Schwartzman scholar\nand now he's solving the problem of home\nmortgages right again it doesn't matter\nthe point is they find the biggest\nproblem and they realize they can go out\nand solve it\nand why is it how did that happen and\nJay you don't have kids yet but one day\nyou do I'm gonna give you some of the\nparenting lesson because I have 32 year\n28 years I'm very open to that right so\nhere's what happens these kids were\ngrowing up on an affluent family unlike\nI grew up in a poor family\nwe told them there our love for you is\nunconditional but our approval is not\nthat means I'll always tell you I love\nyou but I will never tell you I'm proud\nof you to be proud of you you have to do\nthings that make us proud of you and I\ntold them that we will be proud of you\nwhen you do things that make other\npeople's life better that means your\nsuccess is never going to be defined by\nhow much money you have in the bank\nit'll be defined by how many lives you\nimprove they may when they were young\nthey would say whatever dad but guess\nwhat every one of them remembered what\nDad wants and they may they want to make\nyou that they're that proud and I told\nthem and I say I'm proud of you and you\ndo the things that make us proud we told\nthem that their\nself-worth doesn't come from what they\nown it comes from what they create\nthat means you own a lot but you haven't\ncreated anything you're still a parasite\non society right so don't be a parasite\nan ultimate goal of the children was\nalways for them to focus on what can\nthey do and make them believe nothing\nwas impossible\nso I remember when their kids were born\nI was running a very successful company\nand\ninstead of when I retired when I sold\nthat company and I realized I they were\nvery young I had two choices I could sit\nat home to say hey my kids are young I\nwant to spend time with my family\nwhich is a normal thing to do it\noccurred to me\nwhat are what would they be thinking so\nimagine if I had told them it's not\nabout money but that just made a lot of\nmoney and dad is now at home when they\ngo to ski school what do they see Dad\nsitting on the sofa watching CNBC they\ncome back from school they see Dad is\nstill at home and Dad tells them go to\nyour room work hard finish your homework\nhard work is what it takes and money\ndoesn't matter and they say I'll I watch\nmy dad sitting on the sofa when I grow\nup I want to be just like my dad sit on\nthe sofa and watch TV\nand because Dad has money he can do that\nand that's what I'm going to do instead\nwhat they saw was dad started a second\ncompany that started the third company\nthat goes crazy we're going to go to the\nMoon Dad no private company has gone to\nthe Moon you're crazy but let me show\nyou how that's done that turns 58 dad\nwants to start a Healthcare Company\nwe're going to make illness optional\nthat's time to retire well I haven't\nshowed you how it's done yet\nmy point was they realized at the end of\nthe day the dad does it because he loves\nwhat he does he doesn't care about\nmaking money he does it because that's\nwhat brings him happiness and anything\ndifficult can be solved and that's why\nevery one of them is taking on audacious\nchallenges because they see the dad do\nthat so why we tell our kids what to do\nwe never show them what to do right yeah\nI mean Congratulations by the way and\nit's amazing to hear about these\nincredible new companies coming into the\nworld so needed so powerful and so\nbeautiful to see so many purpose-driven\ncompanies coming into the world\nespecially in a world where we're\nconstantly hearing everyone wanting to\nbuild a billion dollar company and\neverything which is just\nit bless me nuts right yeah so but if\neveryone who's listening to it if I may\nsay should go to Avi evvy and if you're\na woman please sign up for Abby it's a\nwomen's health company using vaginal\nmicrobiome and the reason I say that is\nI want her to realize that these are the\nproblems she can solve her generation is\nthe first generation that has a shot at\nsolving problems that our generation\nfailed at failed women at them and she\ncan solve that yeah yeah no that's\nincredible yeah no we'll put that we'll\nput that link into the into the show\nnotes as well so that people can access\nit\nI guess when I'm listening to you right\nnow\nyou you raised a few points then I was\nthinking that\nyou gave the example of dad watching TV\nyeah and I was thinking that so much of\nour society today has been and and\nactually going back again you talked\nabout the two most important phrases\nlike imagine and what if yes so much of\nour society today has become numb to\ncuriosity and Imagination because we\nsimply watch TV now TV and TV shows and\nmovies can be incredible for imagination\nif we watch them in that way because the\npeople that made them are very\nimaginative the people that made them\nare very creative yes but what's really\ninteresting is that when we simply\nsubject ourselves to sitting in front of\na screen and let those images come to us\nand we don't use them creatively we\nactually become numb yes and I find that\nthe majority of media makes us less\ncreative less curious even though the\npeople that made it yes are curious and\ncreative absolutely correct so I guess\nso many people feel like at the end of\ntheir work day because they wake up they\ndo something a lot of people do\nsomething they don't love a lot of\npeople maybe do something they kind of\nlike\nand then by the end of the workday when\nthey get home they just want to switch\non the TV to switch off that's right and\nit's like switch on the TV switch off\nyour mind yes and then that's how the\nnext few hours pass how do people find\nthe the energy the ability to say\nactually you know what I'm gonna use\nthis time to be more Curious to be more\ncreative because that's going to lead to\na better world for me and for others\nwell first of all\nno one should be doing things that they\ndon't enjoy so I have a very simple rule\nin my life\nas I said I wake up at 4am and the day I\nfeel when I wake up at 4am I'm not\njumping out of the bed that means I'm\ndoing things I don't enjoy so rule\nnumber one when you wake up in the\nmorning and if you're not jumping out of\nthe bed you should quit what you're\ndoing because that's not your calling\nwhen you find your true purpose find\nyour you know\nnot star you can never ever just lie\ndown because you're so driven to solve\nthat problem if I may say\nyou know a lot of people talk about\npassion I think the passion is for\nhobbies passion is for losers the true\nwinners have Obsession Obsession to\nsolve the problem not Obsession about\nthings Obsession to solve the problem\nwhen you're truly obsessed about solving\na problem you go to sleep thinking about\nit and you jump out of the bed wanting\nto do it and that to me is find\nsomething that you're willing to die for\nand live for it find something that\nyou're willing to dedicate your life to\nsolving and then solve it right right\nand you know a lot of people give up\nbecause they are anytime you do\nsomething there are going to be the\ntimes that things do not working out\nexactly what you expected and to me\nthat's a sign of your alive because\nyou're the only way you know when you're\nalive because you have a heartbeat and\nthe heartbeat goes up and down and up\nand down and when it's smooth you're\ndead so if you're looking for a life\nthat's a smooth life you're looking for\na life of a dead person find things when\nthey're going up and down that tells you\nalive when you are down\njust hunker down and know that the next\nbeat is going to be up and when you're\non top of that beat never become too\narrogant because always remember the\nwinter is coming and winter shall come\nright and that is the life is that most\npeople spend their life thinking they\nneed to make money so they do something\nthey don't enjoy guess what when they\ncome home they cannot enjoy because they\nwasted their life doing things they\ndon't enjoy and they turn the TV on as\nyou say to switch off their mind and now\nthey're being bombarded with the most if\nyou're watching news unfortunately is\nall about negativity for many reasons\nour mind are amygdalized looking for\nnegative news so negative News catches\nour attention and that's the reason\nnewscasters know to get your attention\nif it bleeds it leads they want to talk\nabout all the negative stuff so you're\nbombarded and now you're even more\nnegative than you were at work and the\nthing in life is to get yourself out of\nthat mode\nnot only find your purpose but truly be\ngrateful for the life you're living in\nmany of us have you know culturally or\nyou know or sometimes religiously\nwe are told before you eat\ndo the great do Grace or do the you know\nprayer why is that the reason it is Jay\nis that\nyour body when it's in the\nfight-or-flight response it stops the\ndigestion you cannot digest your food\nbecause remember the reason your body\nused to be in fight or flight response\nbecause you're tiger chasing you and at\nthat point body says you don't need to\nworry about digesting your food it shuts\ndown your immune system by the way\nbecause you don't need to worry about\nimmune system because you're going to be\nlunch for someone else or if you survive\nthen everything calm down and back to\nnormal today we live in this world where\nwhen we are at work our boss is\nstressing us out we come home your\nspouse is stressing you out and your\nconstant stress mode and you constantly\nin fight or flight respond and then we\neat food in the flight of flight\nresponse it doesn't get digested our\nimmune system is not working so we get\nmore sick and then we blame everything\non the society\nand all it takes is find the job you\nlove\nwhen you come home be grateful for what\nyour loving family you have give them\nthe love and in turn you will receive\nthe love and I was just reading about\nthe new book you're going to tell me\nabout more about the book on this love\nif you can go figure that out everything\nchanges because then when you have love\nyou're always in the sympathetic\nparasympathetic mode rather than a\nsympathetic yeah that's such a great\nanswer I love the idea that\nyou're saying they were living in a\nconstant state of flight of fight or\nflight it's a constant state of stress\nyes and so pretty much every activity we\ndo is in a state of stress\nthat\nperspective of finding what you love is\nso needed yet so hard and also different\nat different times like I remember when\nI was at college and I worked sorry even\nbefore College when I was at school I\nworked ever since I was 14. yeah my\nparents always wanted me to get a job\nand I'm very grateful that they set that\nup\nand so from the age of 14 I was working\nI delivered newspapers then I worked at\na grocery store\nand then I worked in retail and then I\nwas a tutor I was always working\nand I never enjoyed going to the grocery\nstore but I learned valuable skills\nthere that I still use today even though\nI don't work in a grocery store and what\nI found is that I just really learn\nsorry what discuss did you learn at a\ngrocery store yeah I had to part of my\nshift was I had to whenever the truck\nwould come with a delivery yeah I would\nhave to get one of these handheld pallet\npullers\ngo into the back of the truck put it\nunderneath the pallets lift it back up\nand pull it out and then stack it now I\nhated doing that like I absolutely hated\ndoing that and I'll try and avoid it at\nany cost\nbut that genuinely I believe gave me the\nskill or the ability to do things I\ndon't enjoy doing for something useful\nyeah yeah in the sense of like I didn't\nenjoy doing that task I didn't love\ndoing it but there are so many things\nthat you have to do even when you're\nbuilding your purpose of course that you\ndon't want to do that specifically you\nhave a purpose but you have a purpose at\nthe grocery store I didn't have a\npurpose but I at least learned to be\nable to have a discipline of when it's\nyour turn you've got to show up you\ncan't just tap out and say I don't want\nto do it and again these are small\nskills these are not but I definitely\nknew I pretty much knew everything in\nevery aisle like I I knew where it was\nyeah so if someone asked me where do I\nfind bread yeah I knew it was all 21. if\nsomeone new and that simple idea like\ntoday when I'm sitting down and\ninterviewing or I have to prepare I can\npretty much sit down and memorize things\nfairly quickly yeah and I don't think\nmemorization for exams is good but\nmemory is useful in life of course it is\nand so now when I read books I can\nmemorize what on a page I can get back\nto that page because I feel there was a\nlot at that time so I guess what I'm\nsaying is that even if you don't love\nwhat you're doing you can learn to love\nsomething about it love it love it\nbecause you can extrapolate a skill yes\nthat will be useful when you find your\npurpose and so I found that a lot of\njobs have not been I've worked so many\njobs today I live fully in my purpose\nyeah it's it's much easier but I've\nlived so many jobs that weren't in my\npurpose but they've all taught me\nsomething that is now useful but my\npoint that is isn't I think what you\nsaid is that thing was just a double\nclick on that is that even the job that\nyou're doing find something about that\njob that you fall in love with yes yes\nyes yes and I think we agree is what I'm\nsaying yeah yeah yeah yeah and I just\nwant to clarify that for people yeah\neven if you're doing something where you\ndon't love the whole thing yes and you\nmay not be in a financial position or a\nfamily position to quit your job\nat least for now look for the thing\nabout it that you love yes because that\nwill always stay with you that's right\nand so I I love the direction in which\nwe're going and I'm glad that we're\ntalking about life we're talking about\ncuriosity we're talking about how you\nset your kids up how do you think you\nwould have responded or when your kids\nwere younger and maybe they weren't so\nexternally successful and they they\nalmost may have had some pushback of\ncourse I'm wondering if the kids had any\nquestions but they did of course they\ndid of course because I feel like I\ndon't know any kid who doesn't think of\ncourse kids grow up thinking their\nparents are not cool yes and then when\nthey grow up then they're like oh no my\nparents were right they are much more\ncool than I thought they were can you\ntell us a bit about some of those\nmoments where the kids kind of didn't\nagree with your philosophy or Theory and\nwhat did that look like well you know a\nlot of these times when the kids like\nfor example when we're talking about\nthat your success is all about the\nnumber of lives you improve I remember\nmy oldest son said whatever dad\nand then he walks you know he says that\nat the end of the day Money Matters and\nI told them it only matters when you\nactually believe it matters because most\nof the time you don't need much for it\nto matter after the basic needs are met\nafter that it's all it doesn't matter\nright he and I with a lot of discussion\nsay I want to buy this pair of shoes and\nI said I don't think that makes sense\nfor you to be owning a 200 pair of shoes\nat this point and he said that I'm gonna\ngo get it and I'm going to go earn it\nand I said sure if that's what you want\nto do that that's what matters to you go\ndo it but I would rather have you spend\nthat time in learning new skills than\ntrying to go do some menial job because\nyou want you want a pair of shoes and\nthat was very interesting and I think\nmaybe I want to just expand on that\na lot of parents\neven the successful parents would say oh\nI don't want to give my kids things to\nspoil them I want them to work I want\nthem to go do the menial task so they\nunderstand what the money means to them\nand I think to some extent you know\npeople may disagree with that My\nPhilosophy was very different\nMy Philosophy was my job is to teach you\nthe as many things as I possibly can and\nonce you learn those set of skills those\nare the skills you'll have for rest of\nyour life that means instead of going\nout and earning money to pump the gas\nI'd rather have you go out and take a\nsummer courses and I'll pay for it right\nI would rather have you go and do\ninternship at some place where you can\nlearn something and not focus on making\nmoney even it's unpaid but that's a\nskill you want to learn go do it even if\nit's unpaid so it's always about\nlearning learning and learning and the\nbest example I can give you is something\nI think you'll find funny when my\ndaughter was 16 years old she came to me\none day and said Dad I know you love\nscience and technology I have found my\npassion and that's what I'm going to\npursue and I just don't want to do\nanything to do with science and\ntechnology\nand at that point most parents would say\nsweetie tell me what your passion is and\nI want to help you with that my response\nto her was you're too young to have a\npassion dad hasn't done his job of\nexposing you to everything so you don't\neven know the things you don't know how\ncan you tell me you don't like them\nso I see so she said dad what is it that\nyou want me to do then and I said\nsweetie what I want you to go is to go\nto Singularity University I want you to\nlearn about nanotechnology I want you to\nlearn about genetics I want you to learn\nabout artificial intelligence I want you\nto learn about everything and she rolled\nher eyes and by the way and that's the\narticle I wrote on ink magazine if you\nwant to find it's called an entrepreneur\nversus his eye rolling teenage daughter\nthat's cool I like that right now she\nsays Dad I just you don't hear a word I\nsaid I told you I don't like science and\ntechnology and it's a sweetie\nyou don't know what these things are so\nhow can you tell me you don't like them\nbut here is the work here's what I can\ndo for you if you promise me that you're\ngoing to go there with my open mind\nwanting to learn and wanting to like\nwhat I would promise you is when you\ncome back you get to decide what you\nwant because I have done my job of\nexposing you to things and you get to\npick what you want to do and she said\nDad if you promise me that I'll go there\nwith an open mind and I'll do that she\ngoes there comes back and the first\nthing she opens the door uh she said dad\nI made up my mind and my first words I\nremember was OS\nand she said I made a more I said tell\nme what what you want I said that I've\ndecided I'm going to be either a\ngeneticist or I'm going to be a\nneuroscientist I shook my head and I\nsaid sweetie at the risk of you changing\nyour mind can you tell me what happened\nhe said Daddy you're so dumb I'm in high\nschool I go to these classes and signs I\nmix things and they change color and I'm\nthinking why do I care yeah when I went\nto Singularity University what I\nrealized was I care about my passion is\nabout women's health how can I do that\nif I don't even know how their Body\nWorks how can I go change women's life\nif I don't even know how they think so\nto me the science and technology is\nsimply the tools in my tool chest for me\nto pursue the purpose I want right so\nguess what if I had done what most\nparents have done they would have she\nwould have never been exposed to these\nthings\nshe would have never found her true love\nand world would have missed out on a\ngreat entrepreneur guess what when she\ngraduated she did first company using AI\nto remove gender bias and now she's\nusing AI to improve Women's Health this\nis simply because we pursued her to\nfollow\nlearn rather than simply do something\nthat she wanted to do yeah I what I like\nabout where this is going is that\nand and as you were saying this I was\nlike I need to talk to another guest\nthat we've had on about this I don't\nknow if you know um Dr Gabon mate and\nhe's an incredible yep expert on child\ntrauma and illness and everything and I\nI now know what I'm gonna ask him based\non this conversation I've always agreed\nwith exposing yourself to as many ideas\nthoughts learning as possible and it's\nso funny that I agree with your daughter\nbecause I thought I hated science at\nschool yeah and then when I grew up and\nI started reading Behavioral Science yes\nand Neuroscience\nabout the brain exactly I thought\nscience was about like photosynthesis\nwhich I didn't find interesting or it\nwas about cutting a cell open and\nlooking at the layers which I didn't\nfind interesting exactly and then I was\nlike but if I knew at 15 or 16 that\nscience was about you could learn about\nthe brain oh my God and now the brain\nworks and how that I would have been\nglued every every girl in the school\nwould have loved you could have changed\nlike everything would have changed but I\ndidn't know that right I didn't know\nthat because the way we were taught a\ncertain subject was so not even basic\nbut it was so\nspecific like I've never found plant\nbiology to be interesting but if someone\ntold me about the brain the human brain\nI find it so interesting and so I I can\nunderstand I didn't I didn't have\nsomeone in my life who could have sent\nme to Singularity University so I missed\nout but uh but but I can Vibe with that\nso I think exposing yourself to as many\nnew ideas more learning rather than\ntrying to get too fixated too quickly\nthat's right is is a really good lesson\nand that's and also what you're saying\nthat when people when children are\ngrowing up\nmy parents encouraged me to do so many\nthings that were uncomfortable for me\nyes\nthat actually turned out to be\nsuperpowers and there were also things\nthey encouraged me to do that were\nuncomfortable that did not turn out to\nbe superpowers and both are okay I\nremember my parents really wanted me to\ngo to the school that I went to uh high\nschool that I went to because it was a\ngreat high school and if you asked any\nkid while we were in that high school\nthey hated it we hated it but now when I\nlook back I am so grateful I went to the\nhigh school because I learned so much\nand now I look back and I feel so happy\nthat my parents pushed me to do that\neven with simple things like my parents\nwere really scared that I was going to\nbe a shy kid because I was very quiet I\nwas very self-contained I was very shy\nand my parents forced me to go to public\nspeaking drama school yeah I went for\nseven years to public speaking and drama\nschool today my whole life is public\nspeaking and I always think about them\nlike if I didn't go and I didn't like\ngoing I hated going it was so\nuncomfortable to stand in front of a\nteacher and learn how to speak and\ncommunicate but today I'm whole life is\nbased on communication yeah and I was\nthinking if my parents didn't push me\nyeah if my parents didn't encourage me I\nwould never be able to do what I do\ntoday so that's what I was you know I\nthink you're not talking about that it's\nnot in your genes it's the nurturing it\nis what they gave you the lessons and\nmade you uncomfortable yeah and\nsometimes what we find in life is that\nif you can learn to love the discomfort\nthe Comfort becomes very easy yeah yeah\nexactly and and to constantly move in\nthat direction that just because someone\nfinds something uncomfortable that we sh\nwe feel we think that if something's\nuncomfortable we should avoid it yeah\nbut the truth is that\ndiscomfort is where all the growth comes\nand I I again encourage people to try I\nthink the idea of trying more things is\nand being exposed to more ideas and more\nthings and I think that's something we\nconnect the dots more because you have\nno dots to connect that's absolutely\nright and I think you know we tend to\nfind people who are just like us because\nthat's what people want but I think we\nlearn a lot from people who are unlike\nus absolutely absolutely and and they\ndid a study at MIT which showed that\npeople were more creative Innovative and\nproductive when they knew people who\ndidn't know each other yeah the idea\nthat if you know people who know people\nwho know you you just create an echo\nchamber where you all have the same\nideas and you share the same thoughts\nyeah yeah whereas if you have someone in\nyour community who thinks differently or\nrandomly or whatever it may be it can\nspark so much more I I wonder this is\nthe the last area I want to talk to you\nabout is I love the idea that you\ninculcated into your kids the idea of\nimproving other people's lives doing\nsomething good for others\nhow do you find have you also were you\naware also as a parent\nabout how to help them with their\npersonal mental health and their\npersonal well-being of course because\nwhat we find is at the moment we find\neither or we see people who sacrifice\ntheir own well-being for the well-being\nof others and we see people who are just\nstruggling with their own well-being\nthat they can't extend themselves to\nothers I wonder if you were a parent\nthat was conscious of also mental health\nand well-being and and personal\nwell-being well at the end of the day\nthere is no parent at least I don't know\nof any parent who don't want their kids\nto be happy right so to me that is just\npart of\nin loving someone unconditionally that\nyou do anything to make them happy or\nanything for their happiness right and\nI'm not suggesting you sacrifice you\nknow there's you know go slightly\ntangent there's things that in life that\nmatter the most\nis that unconditional love that you can\nreceive or the unconditional love that\nyou can give and very few types of love\nthat in my humble opinion that are\nunconditional are you know we may say we\nlove our spouse unconditionally but that\nis still you know is not the same as the\nlove between Mom and a child or if you\nknow that love is just so strong I mean\nno one can ever see that in fact I think\nthe last time I think when you and I\ntalked about us she may have shared this\nstory that I still to me resonates the\nbest there was this kid who wanted to\njoin the gang and and the you know gang\nmember said I don't think you're ready\nand he said no I'm ready to do anything\nyou want and he says if you are really\nthat ready what I would like you to do\nwould be to show me that you can do\nanything that needs done is to go\ndate your mom while she's alive cut her\nheart and bring the beating heart back\nto us then we know you can do this\nthe kid says I can do this and goes\nthere literally stabs her mom takes the\nbeating heart out and then he is walking\nout he stumbles and falls down and the\nheart and he hears the Beating Heart\nSays son are you okay\nthat unconditional lover mom says the\nonly thing that matters to her was are\nyou okay not what you did to me and that\nkind of unconditional love always brings\nthe tears to my eye that mother didn't\ncare she simply wanted to make sure that\nmy son was okay right because he\nstumbled and fell down right to me when\nyou want to do things for your children\nsometimes the children may not think it\nis good for them and it is your job to\nbe an adult and say in a long term it is\ngoing to be good for you whether it is\nsending you to the school or a speech\nyou know going to the public speaking\nbut at the same time you wanting them to\nbe a mini version of you is where I\nthink parents go wrong\nthe kids should not be molded to be\nanother mini me right and then me me\nconcept happens more often than we want\nthe kids of the lawyer become lawyer the\nkids of the doctor becomes doctor kids\nthat the teacher become teacher because\nthey all try to make them to be\nthemselves what I think\nyou and I both agree that our job is to\nexpose them to as many different things\nas possible give them as many dots as\nthey can so someday they are able to\nconnect these dots and create their own\ncanvas and give them that open canvas\nthat they get to create and they can\nonly create that canvas when we give\nthem also the Curiosity and Imagination\nso they can create whatever they want to\ncreate and give them that inspiration\nthat is nothing they want to do is\nimpossible and the only thing that's\nimpossible is the one they believe is\nnot possible that means they get to\ndecide what is possible and what's not\npossible no one else can decide and the\nideas when they are different it's okay\nto be different because when people tell\nyou it's crazy idea those are the ideas\nthat are worth pursuing right that when\nsomeone tells is a crazy idea it is an\naudacious idea that you can go out with\nright but what you don't want to be\ndoing things is is to Simply live a\ncomfortable life and live a smooth life\nright that is to me the day you stop\nlearning is the day you start dying\nNaveen it has been such a pleasure\ntalking to you as always I want to let\neveryone who know everyone who's\nwatching or listening know as well if\nyou want to know more about how Naveen\nthinks grab his book moonshots if you're\nsomeone that wants to set goals if\nyou're someone that wants to set\naudacious gold and try and achieve the\nmoon shots is the book for you if you\nwant to find out more about your gut\nmicrobiome the company is called volume\nv-i-o-m-e we will put the link in the\nshow notes as well if you want to get a\ngut test done to understand more about\neverything that we just spoke about from\nthat perspective and the third is Evie\nabout women's health which we will also\nadd into the show notes Naveen it has\nbeen a joy sitting down with you again\nas always my friend and uh every time I\nsit with you I definitely feel I can be\na little bit more audacious I feel that\nI'm always being mindful of my gut when\nI'm with you and today
