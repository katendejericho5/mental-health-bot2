category of best\nsong written for visual media please\nwelcome to the show Cynthia ariva\nCynthia it is awesome good to see you\nit's good to see you I know and even the\nfirst few moments we've had yeah you\nknow there's something about hearing a\nBritish accent you know it's like brings\nyour home doesn't it oh it's yes man I\nfeel so like embraced yeah I just heard\nyour voice come up the hill when you\nwere coming up and I was like oh that\nsounds familiar like I'm growing up like\nI've just gone back to being a teenager\nyeah do I make you feel that way yeah\nlike whenever I hear\nbecause you know for all intents and\npurposes this is home but whenever I\nhear an accent that's that sounds like\nwhere I'm from it makes it even more\nhome it's like oh I reckon I really\nrecognize that I feel like oh that's a\nwarm hug yeah hello yes do I still have\nit though that's I know you do okay\nthat's good yeah I always get worried I\nfeel like you're probably bringing out\nmore of me I I always feel like I'm I'm\nquite the chameleon sometimes with my\nyeah my wife always makes fun of me\nbecause she's like every time you talk\nto one of our family in India you just\nput on an Indian accent\nand they do it really unknowingly I do\nit as like I think we we each have\ndepending on where we're from we have\nlike traces of of what that is so I know\nthat when I'm talking to my Nigerian\nfriends we've been listening to that\naccent since we were kids so it's not\nthat we aren't we don't have the accent\nit's sort of like embedded on our brains\nso it just comes out when we're we're\ntogether it's sort of like the\ncomfortability of it comes out so I\nthink it's the same as when we're around\nother English people the comfortability\nof speaking with an English accent yes\ncomes to life there are times when I\nhave to sort of like shift certain words\nwhenever I'm I'm speaking to other\nAmerican people there are words that get\num sort of misunderstood yeah so I might\nsay one thing and they'll be like what\ndoes that mean so I'll find the American\nversion of that word and repeat it and\nthere are times when I've had to change\nthe accent to make sure that we're both\nunderstanding We Get Lost in Translation\nyeah so I totally understand why you it\nmight be stronger when you're speaking\nto me because now you don't have to make\nit any milder because you know that I'll\nunderstand everything you say absolutely\nyeah there was this I remember when he\nfirst moved here my wife would be at the\ngrocery store and she'd be like can I\nget a tin of beans please like what's a\nTIN it's a candy and yeah she's like\nwhere's the tin of this and the tin of\nthat and then there was the one that I\nalways I I started changing my language\nfrom being pounds to dollars and so it\nwould have been a video or an interview\nyeah I'd be saying dollars yeah and then\nall my all my Brit friends in the\ncomments section would be like oh we see\nwhere you are now like you know you let\nus know so yeah what what was your your\nstock wall right yes I was in North\nLondon so I grew up in like wood green\nTottenham area like that was where I\ngrew up what's something that we kind of\nmoved to the states around the same time\nwe just found out what's something that\nyou miss about London but you love about\nla I love the sunshine in la I love that\nthere's there's it's so bright a lot of\nthe time and the that it's warm a lot of\nthe time but there is something really\nwonderful about the way the weather\nchanges in London in the UK the way you\nget the seasons obviously I miss family\nI don't get to see them as often as as I\nwould do if I was there and like\nsilly things like biscuits\nbecause biscuits here are very different\nto biscuits there which ones are your\nfavorite biscuits um digestives\ndigestives or like hobnobs oh yeah yeah\nI used to have Rich tea yeah you know\nthe the the round ones or the pencil the\nones\nyeah or whatever that those ones\nare so good yeah like little things like\nthat you just sort of like Miss lays\nalso are not the same as Walkers yes\nWalkers are really good these are good\ntoo but all of Walker's packets are good\nyou have to find like the right yeah\nlike you know silly things like that\nyeah exactly yeah no I love talking\nabout it because it's\nsame for me it's interesting you said\nthat I think I often feel that sometimes\nwhen I'm back in England I was like oh\nyou live in Hollywood now and you live\nin L.A and I'm like well no to me I live\nin L.A because the weather's incredible\nand I love waking up to a blue sky every\nday yeah and I love the fact that I can\ngo on a hike yeah yeah right here yeah\nand be in nature I I hike for about two\nmiles every day yeah around my home and\nit's just I I love that I never could\nhave done that in London I never did and\nat the same time I miss a lot of I miss\ngoing to watch a football match because\nI love football and so for me being able\nto go to going to watch a game yeah and\nlike feeling the energy of the fans yeah\nyeah uh it's it's it's special there's\nlike a special Vibe around it but what I\nlike to do on purpose is I like to dive\ninto people's Journeys people's stories\nparts of them we're not we're not\nfollowing a linear or\nyou know we're not trying to do a bio\nbiographical piece but I love diving\ninto stuff and I saw that you went to a\nRoman Catholic school going on yeah yeah\nhow is that influence now when you look\nback who you are today positive things\nthat were challenging like how do you\ngrapple with that today what does it\nfeel like growing up and going to Roman\nCatholic school there's a girls school\ntoo all girls school yeah it's strange\nbecause I never really felt like I\ntotally fit in there I believe in God\nbut that's sort of upbringing felt\nreally restrictive it's so rules based\nthat you sort of Miss the the most\nimportant parts of what that faith is\nsupposed to be about and I've kind of\nlet a lot of the Roman Catholic\nside of me go just so that I create I\ncould create space for me to form my my\nown understanding of what my faith\nshould Encompass right now I'm really\nclear on the fact that the most\nimportant part of my faith is to be as\nloving and kind to people to the world\naround me not just people but I have two\ndogs so I can't take care of them in the\nmost loving way\nbecause I want that to come back to me\nso I believe things are really cyclical\nso if you give out something good that\ngood will come back you might not see it\nimmediately but somehow it finds its way\nback to you it's like a boomerang you\nknow and I think that that is really the\nmost important part of the of my faith\nand I sort of encouraged myself to\nreally take in what is around me so that\nI can appreciate the wonderful things\nthat come you know the fact that I can\nget up in the morning and go for a run\nand it's really sunny and I as I pass by\nthere are two when I today when I ran\nthere were two women who stopped and\nthey I saw them as they passed by they\nsmiled and I was like that's lovely of\nthem smiling and I ran back and somehow\nmanaged to meet them again how I don't\nknow I ran three miles I you know just\ndid a quick 5K but somehow on my way\nback we met in exactly the same place\nand they stopped and I stopped and they\njust were like we were just really\nimpressed we didn't know what you what\nare you running for was I running for\nthe marathon I was like oh okay great\nand just those little interactions are\nreally special because well we don't\nknow how either one of us is going to\ninfluence our day and to be able to stop\nand have that conversation with the\nperson and smile at someone and you know\nhave something positive means that we've\nput something positive into each other\nand I think that that is really what it\nis about for me and I I understand that\neveryone has their own understanding of\nFaith but for me Roman Catholicism\nsort of doesn't give us the space to\nembrace all of that it's always really\ninteresting hearing someone's reflection\nin in hindsight yeah because I don't\nknow how it felt at that time whether it\nfelt the same way but I went to an\nall-boy school so I went to Queen\nElizabeth's boys school and Barnet and I\nI used to take like a 45 minute bus or\nto an hour bus sometimes just to get\nthere every day my parents had worked\nreally hard for me to prepare for exams\nto get into this school and it wasn't\nprivate but it was a great education and\nat the time it's like all of us didn't\nwant to go there because it was so\nstrict it was so like disciplined yeah\nbut I found a few teachers there that\nkind of had this openness yeah and so I\nhad my art teacher at the time Mr\nbuckridge who who's still there I\nbelieve and we keep in touch now and\nagain but he just helped me think so\ndifferently so in this space where there\nwere like rules and discipline yeah\nthere was a teacher who just kind of\njust knew how to navigate enough where\nyou were in the rules but not too much\nyeah yeah yeah and he helped me so much\nwith my thought process and my mindset\nand now when I look back I'm really\ngrateful that I have this really\nbeautiful experience where I feel like I\nhave equal parts discipline right and\nequal parts Artistry yeah and I really\nembraced those two sides I was wondering\nwith you like you you're right yeah yeah\nyou're very right actually you really\nwrote about that that there is that sort\nof like tandem of of discipline and an\nArtistry my favorite music teacher\nactually my music teacher and a French\nteacher for some reason sort of stuck to\nme\num Miss rycroft and Madame shesley they\nboth just wanted me to Blossom as a\ncreative Madam chairs they wouldn't let\nme get away without speaking some sort\nof French to her all the time and now I\nlove the language very much so and Miss\nrycraft made me learn every kind of\ninstruments I could possibly put my\nhands on and seeing everything I could\npossibly seeing in but it also gave me\nthe discipline of wanting to learn\nwanting to to be as good as I want to be\nat these particular subjects and you're\nright in that there is a wonderful sort\nof melding of creativity and discipline\nthat has definitely influenced how I\nlive and how I've lived so far yeah I\nwas thinking that with you because when\nyou brought up running yeah you've got\nto be really disciplined and when I see\nyour stories I'll post with you running\nI literally I'm like I'm an anxiety like\nI'm like I am so glad I was like I'm\nbecoming friends with Cynthia I hope but\nas long as she doesn't invite me on a\nrun we're good like she wants to do a\nhike I could do that but it's like you\nrequire this requires so much discipline\nso much energy and that's that's what\nwe're running first and then we'll move\ninto your Artistry but when you look at\nhow much you're running you just said\nyou run a half marathon half marathon uh\nover the weekend and then at this every\nday is about eight miles except for\ntoday which is supposed to be a break\nday so I did 5K and then on the weekend\nit's 16 to 18. and how do you find time\nfor this in between roles and prep and\nlike oh is this something that continues\nit just goes on\nlike I I've I've been running since I\nwas 20. my first marathon was 2016. I\nthink I had one mini break in between I\nwas I remember I was in Atlanta and just\ndecided let me get back to it and\nhaven't stopped since then it's an\nongoing Journey that teaches you about\ndiscipline your stamina how your mind\nworks how you psych yourself out\nsometimes how you can boy yourself and\nlift yourself up and I gain so much from\nit believe me there are days when I do\nnot want to get outside or on a\ntreadmill and do any of it but that also\nis a moment for me to sort of learn\nthere are days when yes it's good to\nstop take a second and not do the run\ntoday but other days it's how can I\novercome this moment where I'm like\ntruly not wanting to do it and those\ndays when I'm able to overcome those\nmoments when I'm like I do not want to\ndo this often are the days when the runs\nare the best which is very strange yeah\num but I love it\num it has provided\nspace to think it's provided moments\nwhere I've made friends along along the\nway people are now used to seeing me do\ncertain routes so I always bump into\npeople and I say hello and it just it\ngives me a lot the physical aspect is\nyes your body loves it it's great to\nwork out but\nit's more a mental thing than than\nanything else distance running really is\nmore mental Than Physical because once\nyour physical is done if you get to 18\npast half marathon it really is sort of\nlike okay mind how how will you get past\nthe rest of this yeah and that's always\na really wonderful\nsort of Adventure yeah yeah have you\nfelt that that approach to anxiety and\npsyching yourself out have you feel that\nbecome applied to life through that\nprocess of running like yeah could you\ngive us an example of how that because\nhonestly it's those days are the\nstep-by-step days that's that's what I\ncall them you just take one step then\ntake the next step and take the next and\nthe next and the next and you'll realize\nat some point you're running\nthat's and that's essentially what\nhappens with me with other things this\nis a silly example I had to redo my\ncloset everything was taken out of it\nand I've had to put it all back together\nagain and when I first looked at this\ntask it just looked Mammoth I was like\nthere's no way I'm gonna\nget this back in order again and I\nlooked at it and would go away and go\nI'm not this it's not going to get done\nI can't do it I can't do it and then one\nday I just said just start just start to\nstart nothing else after that if you\njust start\nsomething will get done even if even if\nit's like one small section you will\nhave started and the next day just start\nagain yeah it's the same for if I'm\nlearning a piece or a song that just\nwon't stay I'll just start\nlearn the first line and just keep going\nover the first line and sooner or later\nthe first line will be in there and\nyou'll want to go into the next line\nwill you do a piece or uh you're playing\na character you just can't understand\njust read the lines read the lines find\nout what other people are saying find\nout what the journey is and then sooner\nor later you'll want to get to know this\ncharacter now the way to get to know\nthis character is probably to learn the\ncharacter and when you learn the\ncharacter well you've learned the\ncharacter now you know it all these sort\nof little mountains or trials they're\njust they aren't always easy but if you\njust start you might be able to get over\nthem yeah even when we're running hills\nI never look at the and you know\nsometimes you're told look straight\nahead I always look at the bit in front\nof me my eyes are never pointed upward\nwhen I'm walking up a hill I'm always\nlike if I can just get my foot in front\nof this next foot and if I could just\nkeep going Bit by Bit by Bit a sooner or\nlater when I look up I'll be at the top\nof the hill and that's always what's\nhappened and it's one thing that doesn't\nthat keeps me from stopping in the\nmiddle of a hill I just keep going one\nfoot in the front of the other my eyes\nare pointed downwards because I know\nthat there's only one foot that keep can\nthe same the only thing that can happen\nis I'm gonna put my foot in front of my\nfoot again and then eventually the hill\nsort of flattens out and you're like oh\nI got there I made it okay yeah I'll\nkeep going it's good yeah yeah that's\nthat's so powerful I love that\nperspective because I think you are\nright there we've kind of been trained\nin Society tonight look at the goal yeah\nlook at the Target yeah figure out the\nend point yeah and you're so right that\nif you ever try and run or whatever you\ndo whether it's hiking or anything\nswimming or whatever if you're looking\nat the end constantly right you'll keep\nmeasuring how far you are away from\nexactly I know that I don't run anywhere\nclose to as much as you do but when I\nhave ever run before when I have looked\nat the end I'm just like how am I gonna\nget so far away I'm still so far away\nokay I'll get to that point and then\nI'll walk and then you know whatever and\nthen you start negotiating with yourself\nright rather than if you you are just\nlooking at it it's the same when we were\ntaught to meditate as monks I lived as a\nmonk for three years when we were\ntrained in that practice uh we always\nmeditated on beads and you get this\nbeautiful set of beads I still have them\ntoday and there's 108 of them which is a\nsacred number and you're told to just\nfocus on one bead at a time right and\nthe mind is like oh I've got to go 108\nbeads and got to do this multiple times\nand whatever it is and so we were\ntalking no just one beat at a time one\nstep at a time one you know and just\nstart I loved that as\nI love that as a view of like just start\ntoday and then you thank yourself later\nyou'll figure it out I can't tell you\nhow many times people have asked how do\nyou how do you even do that how do you\nrun so much I like I want to start and\nI'm not sure what to do and how like I'm\nnever going to be able to run that that\ndistance no one is asking you to run\nthat distance just go outside and start\nyeah that's it put in your sneakers even\nif you only make it to the door that's\nmore than you did yesterday yes and then\nmaybe you'll make it in front of the\ndoor tomorrow and then maybe you'll make\nit just down your street that is a run\nyeah five minutes of running is a run\nyes it doesn't need to be half an hour\nan hour two hours fight two minutes is a\nrun yeah just start just a little bit is\nenough and then you'll find more later\nyou'll find that you are asking your\nmind is asking your body is asking for a\nlittle bit more because the five minutes\nthat you did is now well I can do that\nI'll do more then absolutely were you\nalways athletic like was that always a\npart of your life growing up like yeah\nI've always I've always been athletic\nwhether it be dance or sport I was a\nsprinter when I was younger that's what\nI sort of wanted to do and then my very\nfirst sort of distance around was a 5K\nand it was for cancer research and I\njust wanted to do something and I saw\nthis run happening uh in a park nearby\nand I started doing it and I don't know\nI sort of was telling myself that oh I\ncan't run outside I'm not going to be\nable to and then I just figured it out I\njust wanted I'll just find a route and\nand that sort of what happened and I\nhaven't really stopped since then yeah\nwhen when you apply that to your career\nnow\ndid little Cynthia ever think that you\nknow and I don't want to simplify and\nI'm very careful about this I never like\nto simplify someone's success to\nexternal accomplishments and awards but\ndid little Cynthia like growing up in\nStockwell like you know and you look at\nthe journey you've been on and you know\nEmmy Grammy Tony they just you and and\nmore importantly you've paid iconic\npeople who who transformed culture and\nyour work is educating people on these\nincredible personalities that history\ncan try to forget or doesn't know enough\nabout or doesn't know the depth of the\nstory like what would little Cynthia say\nto you now like looking at all of that\nlike who believed in you back then like\nwas there did your parents did your\nfamily like who who knew this was\npossible did anyone my mum believed in\nme\num sort of from the beginning she she\nknew when I was a kid that that was sort\nof what I was gonna do apparently I\nwould hum when I ate so she she was like\nit's probably going to be a singer or an\nactor so that sort of like it was a came\nat no surprise to her that this is what\nI sort of wanted to do in\nmy sister you know has always been\naround for everything that's happened to\nher she's always believed in it and has\ncome to some of the shows and seen some\nthings and\nyou know I have really wonderful friends\num one of my friends Capri Hakeem who\nI've known for almost 17 or 18 years at\nthis point has just always been there\nand like always has gotten it and\nbelieved in me and I have some really\nincredible friends who I'm getting to\nwatch do amazing things now as well but\nthey also believe in me and I've been\nlucky enough to be surrounded by some\nwonderful people little Cynthia believed\nin herself although I'm not entirely\nsure that she knew how much was coming\nyeah\num she sort of kept her head down and\njust was like well I'll do that it was\nalso it was a game of like I'll try this\noh okay I'll do that no I'm game to like\nI'll do some backing vocals for this\nperson I'll go and sing at this sort of\nclub and do all those things and I'll\ntry this young actors course and there's\njust like a it's a combination of yes\nhard work but also loving the adventure\nand wanting to try new things and\nwanting to not miss out on something if\nI if I don't enjoy you know yeah I think\nthat she would probably pack me on the\nback and give me the mischievous look\nthat I give most people when I'm like\nthat's good and be really really happy\nand then she'd be like what else are we\ngonna do yeah what else can we do that's\nawesome yeah I love that and and it's so\nI I actually realize it's more and more\nthat a lot of people that I speak to did\nhave people that believed in them like\nthere was that and I and I love hearing\nthat I think it's important to normalize\nthat too where it's like hey if you\nbelieve in your kids it's great that's\ngood it's good yeah you should yeah yeah\nyou should and then if there's people\nout there who grew up with parents who\ndidn't believe in them yeah that's great\nyou became resilient that way but it's\nbeautiful to hear that there's two ways\nyeah there's not like this oh well you\nyou should have had everyone telling you\nyou were never gonna make it and that's\nthe only way and you're like actually I\nhad really good friends around me yeah\nyeah you know and and I think I just\nsort of like have been consistently sort\nof finding my tribe and finding people\nwho who are challenging me and wanting\nme to to keep being better and keep\ndoing things that are different and then\nthere are those friends who are just\nwe're here when you want to have like a\nnormal day and a cup of tea and like sit\ndown and chat and we need both and I I\nlove that balance because it is kind of\nwhat life is made of there's no there's\nnever always just the one way to be yeah\nand I think both influence the other\nyeah yeah you've you've been known for\nplaying so many iconic people now when\nwas a role where a role that you've\nplayed that you feel you loved but it\nwasn't as well known or it was something\nthat maybe wasn't as successful but that\nyou really found that you just fell in\nlove with it and that it became a part\nof you I'm I'm gonna say Holly Gibney in\nThe Outsider although that did that did\npretty well yeah that did pretty well\num I've I've loved the roles that I've\nplayed and I've picked I I picked them\nreally specifically because I I want to\nget to know this person I you know if I\nI always say this if I if I haven't met\nthis person before either I'm screen or\nin life I'd like to meet them so I\nthat's why I play them I want to get to\nknow who they are and what makes them\ntick and Hollywood's just so different\nshe just she was very hard to shake\nshe was a woman who found it hard to\ncommunicate but really all she wanted\nwas connection\nand so had to learn to find ways to make\nherself understood and when she was\nmisunderstood would deep would be deeply\nhurt by it extremely intelligent a\nbrilliant brilliant mind but also deeply\nloving in the most individual way and I\nI just had never played anyone like her\nbefore I had and what's wonderful about\nthat particular role is like I get\neveryone from every different type of\nWalk of Life\nin any place sort of going that show\nthat you did on HBO with Holly Gibney\nthat I I loved it she she was one of my\nfavorites so wow I remember a person\nsaid to me um he was connecting with his\nsister more because of this particular\nrole and realized that oh my sister just\ncommunicates in a different way than I\ndo and this was the thing that joined us\ntogether and I thought that's that's\nwhat it's about making pieces that allow\npeople to connect with each other yeah\nyou know yeah that's beautiful I love\nhearing that as well because it's and\nit's what I appreciate about our\nconversation last time as I was saying\nearlier it was like the way you think\nabout characters and the way you get\ninto them I'm fascinated by that and I\nlove geeking out and like I I love\nseeing people obsessed with their art\nlike that's what gets me excited in life\nit's like when I meet someone who's\nobsessed about what they do because I'm\nobsessed with what I do and I can never\nunderstand how you obsess over the\nthings you do can you describe to me\nagain because you told me about this\nlast time but I want to hear it again\nfor on purpose for this community\nbecause you were talking about how like\nwhen you're playing roles you look at\nhow people walk oh yeah and you and I\nwas like and how they talk to figure out\ntheir pitch and then like the rhythm of\ntheir walk and the pacing and I was just\nlike I would never think of any of that\nbut because it tells you so much\nwhen you when you meet a new character\nyeah walk us through how you understand\nthem yeah so so I when I meet a new\ncharacter obviously I I'll read a script\nand the first thing I think of is what\nis the rhythm of this person usually\nthere's a rhythm sort of written in in\nthe way they speak in the way that in\ntheir syntax and the words they use when\nyou find that Rhythm you sort of find\ntheir internal like heartbeat you find\ntheir heartbeat and then I'm sort of\nlike well how do they move what is it\nthat they're looking for is there an\nurgency to how they move if they walk\nfast are they moving away from something\nare they trying to get to something\nquickly do they think fast or if they\nmove slowly are they apprehensive about\nsomething or are they really laid back\nabout things do they have nothing to\nworry about if they're if they're\nanxious maybe that's why they move fast\nor maybe it's the opposite maybe they're\nso anxious that they are paralyzed that\nthey can't move at all so they move\nreally slowly because what if I get\nthere and something happens and so I\njust sort of like find what fits on this\nperson and then it's about well how do\nthey speak if they are confident well\nmaybe they don't need to make themselves\nsound really sweet and so their voices\naren't as high pitched or maybe they are\nsort of held and so they're a little bit\nquiet then things feel a little bit\nwhispered and\num there was a really interesting\ndocumentary about Princess Diana and I\nshe's really fun to listen to because\nher voice changes as the years go by\nwhen you first meet her it's almost like\nshe's whispering and swallowing the\nwords and the pump doesn't really use\nher mouth very much and it's very quiet\nand very reserved and as you meet her as\nthe years go by when she sort of like\nnow I know who I am she starts to use\nher mouth more so she she sounds really\nrounded and and that's sort of what\nyou're discovering about these people\nand I love that I love trying to find\nout what is this person how do they grow\nand do they grow through through meeting\nthem and through these episodes or\nthrough the film does it change does it\nshift do they move more confidently do\nthey move more smoothly are they are\nthey quick are they darted so many\nquestions I would ask myself and then\nsilly things like what scent do they use\nbecause we all have sense memory so if\nthere's a particular scent they use it's\nbecause it reminds them of something and\nwhen I put that scent on does it make me\nthink of something or do they like\nmakeup and if they do like makeup is\nthere a particular way they do it do\nthey want their eyebrows messy or do\nthey want them very tidy when they put\nthe clothes on are they looking for\nComfort or not with Holly I always wore\na button up because it felt like\nprotection her neck was covered and she\nwas wear wore comfortable shoes so she\ncould move easily and she wouldn't think\nabout her feet but those things are yeah\nyou know they change with Aretha she\nneeded heels and she needed a look and\nshe did her her eyebrows particularly\nand they were a particular shape with an\nInky black line you know and with Celie\nit changed when she put trousers on she\ncould walk better and she had a heel a\nthick blocky heel that meant that she\ncould like make sound when she moved\nbefore then she was in a shorter heel\nwith that was like a soft shoe that made\nno sound at all so it meant that she\ncould move really quickly because if she\ndidn't move quickly she'd be in danger\nso it's about that how do you find all\nthe things that make this person a round\nperson so that when you when you meet\nthem on screen you're like oh I can see\nthis person and they're\nthree-dimensional four-dimensional\nand not just someone that I read a\nscript on where did that ability and\nskill come from because\nobviously it can be seen as a technique\nbut when you talk about it it's not a\ntechnique it's it's something that you\nknow it's it's not just like oh you've\nread that in a book yeah it's it's how\nyou think and how you feel and how you\nempathize with this person and even when\nyou were talking about Diana there's\nsomeone obviously who've not played it's\nlike but you're watching that and you're\nyou're able to observe that where did\nthat skill come from how did it develop\ndo you remember like when did you start\ndid you start doing that when you\nwatched TV when you were a kid or did\nyou you know where yeah where did it\ncome from I'm not even sure when it\nstarted I think I've always been a\npeople Watcher I think I've always\nobserved how people move how people are\nso that I can better communicate with\nthem myself I haven't always been\nperfect but like that seems to be my\nsort of cheat code to knowing what a\nperson needs from me in conversation I\nsometimes watch people's lips for to\nmake sure that I'm really listening\nor watch their eyes because those are\nthe places that give you what the\nemotional life of a person is and I\nthink I've always just applied that to\nmy everyday life and then when I went to\ndrama school was he learning about\nactioning and making sure that there's a\nreason for something and what is the\nreason for the thing you're saying what\nwe say is 50 of what we mean often how\nwe say it and what we're thinking as we\nsay it the words aren't necessarily the\nthing that we're thinking they're just a\nrepresentation of how we're feeling and\nand until you know when we're not afraid\nthe words are the thing that we thinking\nbut often with people when we're saying\nthe thing that we think the other person\nwishes to hear as opposed to what we\nwant to say and so I I learn about that\nin drama school and then just applied it\nto the bigger you know space of my life\nand then I you know as you get older you\nstart to want to connect with people\nand that desire to connect properly with\npeople\nI think just feeds into my work I want\npeople to connect with the people I get\nto play and I call them people because I\ndon't see them as just characters when\nyou see the people you're playing or\nwhat people would know as characters as\nwhole and realized people you get to\nknow them better which means you get to\ngive another person introduce a person\nto everybody watching and so they get to\nconnect and feel as though these are\nreal people out in the world that I\nmight not come in contact with but they\nexist\nand and I want that for the people that\nI play yeah that's that's the desire for\nconnection consistently with my\ncharacters yeah do you do you feel that\nsometimes and I've I coach a lot of\npeople who act instead of not in acting\nobviously in in in life and work but\nhow do you often feel as well that\nsometimes those people become a part of\nyou oh and that do you do you try and\nshed them do you try hold on to them\nlike do you do you like that like\nbecause I don't think that's talked\nabout enough I think we hear about in\nthe extreme senses of method acting gone\nwrong or like when it leads to like you\nknow a the tragic event of someone\ntaking their own life and we hear about\nand there's very extreme but I don't\nthink we talk about it enough with\nactors who are you know going about\ntheir day taking on new roles and like\nhow long it takes to become someone and\nthen lose someone and yeah you know like\nright now everyone's saying Austin\nButler sounds like Elvis Elvis in every\ninterview and the thing is I feel for\nhim because I know that that he's not\nputting that on yeah of course not it\nhappens you and it's very different for\nevery single person but for me it takes\na while to to lose a character because\nif if you've done your job correctly\nthey weren't just a character they were\na part of you you had to infuse use this\nperson with some of you yeah so they and\nthey have to come from you they're in\nyour body they use your voice they use\nyour face they use your mannerisms you\ncreate them together they take up space\nwithin you they take up a little bit of\nyour heart because you have to mean in\nthe things you're saying and when you\nfinish the role usually after what a\ncouple of months three months sometimes\nsix I'm about to play character for a\nyear they are a part of you and and what\npeople don't realize is your body\ndoesn't realize that it's not real it\nthinks that this thing happening is you\nit's real yeah so you have to at the end\nof it let your body know that it's okay\nto let this thing go but it's gonna take\na while because you've learned to teach\nyour body to do it quickly get to that\nperson quickly remove the thing that you\nknow is your everyday life and get to\nthe person that you're playing every day\nquickly that's what you want the quicker\naccess so now the access is really quick\nand to the point where well now you\ndon't really have to think about getting\ninto the role because you're already\nthere yeah you wake up in the morning\nyou know oh I'm gonna put this on and\nthis is and there we go do you look at\nyour mirror and I'm here there we go hi\nnice to meet you and and at the end of a\nproject it takes some time some projects\nare easier like getting out of the blue\nfairy very easy I didn't have to shoot\nfor very long so it was lovely and I\nknow it's fantasy but and it didn't cost\nme too much yeah getting out of Aretha\ngetting out of Harriet getting out of\nHolly very different things because I\nwas there for months with these people\nHolly was hilarious because she had a\nher walk was very different someone sent\nme a video of me walking about on set\nand I was like that is not me that's not\nme posture is different walk was\ndifferent different weight the way I\nmove my head was different the way I\nspoke to people and even my hair and\nmakeup team were sort of like you would\ncome into trailer and it was not you\nthat's not who we met we met Holly most\nof the time and it would take a while to\nlet them go the person I just played her\nname's Jacqueline I spent three four\nmonths with her and I still remember\neverything she went through as though it\nwas me and it takes time if you mean it\nyeah it will take time exactly support\nAustin Butler is walking around with\nthis accent because I imagine he shot\nthis film for six months to a year so\nhad to learn this sound\nand when you learn a sound it doesn't\njust leave you yeah you know he may slip\ninto it just by X not even thinking\nabout it yeah because that's the person\nhe played he paid he played a person\nthat existed\nfor six to\nnine months or something and preparation\nand prepared it before then and then\nrehearsed it and then sang the songs\nlike same thing as insane as well yeah\nhe put a voice on top of his own that's\nnot gonna go because the film is over\nyeah there's no way it can yeah how does\nthat affect your relationships during\nthat time like I wonder how does that\naffect your personal life because\nbecause like you're saying it's not as\neasy as like on off on off yeah it's not\nlike there's a switch yeah how does it\naffect like your friends it's always\neasy but if you have people around you\nthat are understanding of the job you're\ndoing they're just patient with you I\nhave been Savvy enough to get myself a\nreally good therapist so I can talk\nabout it talking about it really helps\nto let go of it because you can find the\nseparation between yourself and the\nperson you were playing the more you\ntalk about it the less it's you and the\nmore you let them go the more you allow\nyour body the permission to let go of\nsomething which is a life lesson not\njust an acting lesson the easier it\nbecomes to let it go what was your\nreason for going to therapy was that the\nreason was that part of it or yeah and\njust like a life things things you know\nI I my mum raised me uh my father wasn't\naround and those we don't realize that\nthat sticks to the bones of a person you\ndon't realize it because it comes out in\ndifferent ways and I just wanted to be\nFreer of that so I wanted to give myself\nmore access\nto the fully emotional parts of myself\nand in order to do that I had to let go\nof any resentment or any upset and it\ndoesn't go overnight but it helps to\ncreate space I wanted to be just better\nat understanding relationships I have in\nin general where I am you know mistaking\nsomething for hurt\nas opposed to if I'm thinking someone is\nbeing mean I'm I need to know what are\nthey going through also because it might\nnot be vindictive it might not be a mean\nthing it might just be that they they\nare also hurting but what is what in me\nis seeing their hurt as mean am I\nhurting in a place so it's just finding\nbetter ways to communicate with people\ntherapies really helped me with that\nlike how do I want to communicate best\nwith people how can I show up as my best\nself and that's not always\nto lay the groundwork for really great\ncommunication yeah I think that's that's\na really beautiful way I've never heard\nit described like that yeah I actually\nthink that's a really refreshing\ndescription because it's almost like I\nthink we literally run from conflict\nhere yes unease here yes discomfort yeah\nyeah and it's like personally\nprofessionally family whatever it may be\nand you're just you're running from\ndiscomfort to discomfort to Discount\nyeah and you never had time to think\nabout it yeah you never attempt to\nprepare yeah you never had time to\ndebrief right like you know you may do\nthat at work yeah but when do you\ndebrief personally after a altercation\nwith someone and therapy or coaching or\nthe ability to talk to someone in your\nlife like you you get to start going oh\nwell I've actually thought about this\nright and here's how I feel about right\nright rather than I'm just feeling I'm\njust feeling I'm just feeling yeah and\nalso those feelings end up being\nexacerbated because you're just talking\nto yourself yes you can't really process\nsomething if you're just talking to\nyourself you need ears\nthat can say well I know that you're\nfeeling that but here's what I'm hearing\nas you say this to me that has been a\nwonderful Game Changer when the words\nthat you're saying are not actually the\nthing that you are saying yeah that's\nnot what you're feeling the thing you're\nsaying is not the thing yes yes and and\nthat's what we all struggle with is that\nwe are this misalignment between what\nwe're thinking and saying yes and\nfeeling yeah is is so much more\nwidespread than we think yeah yeah what\nwhat's a belief that you think that you\nheld once about yourself that led you\ndown a scary path or a wrong path is\nthere a belief or a value or a idea you\nheld about yourself that you think\ndidn't take you in a great Direction I\ndon't know that there is anything like\nthat I think just little things that\ncome up sometimes you question whether\nyou're good enough for something we all\nsuffer from that in a little way and\nsome you know more than others varying\ndegrees\nand when you're younger it feels huge\nand then as I've gotten older it creeps\nit in occasionally and then I sort of I\nallow myself to know that what is\nsupposed to be for you will come to you\nand if it wasn't meant to come to you it\nwon't you are good enough\nfull stop if you're doing the work to be\na good person to prepare for the work\nthat you want if I spend the time you\nknow running every day no it is a\nholistic thing that I give myself my\ntherapist said to me when you do\nsomething or you eat something or you\nbuy something or drink something ask\nyourself are you loving yourself when\nyou do that and if the answer is yes\nwell then you've done a good job and if\nthe answer is maybe not\nto something different if your life is a\nseries of things that you know\nare goodness and you and they are a\nseries of things that are what is known\nas loving yourself you are good enough\nand all you're doing is prepping\nyourself for whatever is supposed to\ncome to you yeah every time I've gone I\nwanted to do that and it doesn't come my\nway every time something else comes up\nand I go oh\ngot it yeah yeah I know I wasn't\nsupposed to do that because that thing\ncame and that thing is awesome so I want\nto do that thing thank you Universe\nthank you God yeah for taking that out\nthe way\nI always say to people every no is just\nroom for a yes every no is just room for\nthe thing that is supposed to happen\nyou're making room for the yes that's\nsupposed to be there I I loved your\nresponse to that imposter syndrome as we\ncall it today that you felt that the\nidea that anything that comes to you is\nmeant to come to you yeah so even if you\nfeel that way yeah and I feel that way\noften I I experience imposter syndrome\nall the time I get to do incredible\nthings that I could never have even\nimagined or dreamed of doing and then\nthis opportunity comes your way\nand you're scared before you you prepare\nyou're scared before you even get there\nand you haven't and you haven't\nexperienced it yet so you have no idea\nwhat you're stepping into yet you just\nknow it's a good thing in front of you\nand like what if I'm not good enough for\nit am I supposed to be here yes you were\nsupposed to be here not just because\nyou're the person that's supposed to do\nit but you're the person that's supposed\nto experience it because your experience\nis valuable if you share your experience\nmaybe you're the person that changes\nsomeone else's mind about this\nparticular experience because someone\nelse might be petrified of Leaning into\nit but because you're the person that is\nexperiencing it you're the right person\nto send the message to the next person\nyou see what I mean absolutely yeah that\nis so Crystal Clear I love that yeah\nyeah no it's that's exactly what I'm\nsaying that the what's what's really\nclicking for me as you're speaking is\nthat idea that it's come to me it's for\nme to experience it's for me to go\nthrough and that what we do is we're\nscared before you get through it and you\nprobably did better than you thought you\nwould and then afterwards you critique\nyourself of how you didn't do a great\njob and then when the next thing comes\nalong you do the same thing all over\nagain and what you're saying is just so\nfascinating that yeah it's for you to\nexperience I think that's beautiful like\nthat's even better than just this for\nyou to do yeah or for you to have yeah\nit's like no there's an experience here\nthat's been perfectly crafted just for\nyou just for you yeah yeah and we don't\nalways live in that Miracle or like live\nin that space what what have you felt\nlike about what you're doing right now\nthat's come that way that you're like oh\nthis was just for me like this is the\nexperience I was meant to have was there\nsomething recently or oh I mean it's\ncoming up I uh doing Wicked so there was\nanother cool that I really wanted to do\nand it didn't quite work out and because\nit didn't work out it meant that I was\navailable to even be seen for Wicked and\nnow I'm doing it and and it came in out\nof nowhere I one day my my agent called\nhim was like so they're seeing people\nfor Wicked and I was like I had no idea\nthis was even happening and now now it\nis what it is and I'm doing it and this\nis so far has been a really wonderful\nexperience I've been talking to John our\ndirector and Ariana and we're really\nsort of like finding our sort of group\nlike what is our what is the group mind\nwanting what do we want to tell with the\nstory how do we want it to look what do\nwe want people to feel how we want to\nfeel when we do it all of those things\nand it wouldn't have happened if there\nwas a yes there yeah because this yes\nwas supposed to come you know yeah yeah\nhow does it feel when you're working\nwith other incredibly creative people\nthat one mind can be really challenging\nthere's one thing getting your mind\nright and being like I know what I'm\ndoing yeah now you've got three sets of\nimposter syndrome three sets of\nexcitement three sets of artists like\nwhat have you figured out as by now like\nis there a system or process that you\ncan follow to help\nto make everyone feel comfortable like\nhow does that work often it's about\nthinking less about and I know this\nsounds counter-intuitive but less about\nwhat you need and more about what they\nneed what does this person need in this\nmoment to feel confident enough that\nthey can go through this with you what\ncan I do to make you understand that I\nam here for you as well and if I'm here\nfor you you can be here for me and\ntherefore we can think together we can\nfigure it out together and I think that\nonce that's sort of established it's\njust about throwing ideas and like what\nabout this there's no wrong idea like\ncreating a space for when you want a One\nmind idea it's about that's actually\nabout creating a safe space and we hear\nthe words safe space used a lot but that\nis really what it is creating a safe\nsurrounding so that we can throw\nanything at the wall like what is what\nabout this it might sound completely\nridiculous and outlandish but it's okay\nto throw it in this circle because we're\nall gonna appreciate it we might it\nmight not be quite right but we're going\nto be like actually this thing about the\nthing that's outlandish actually might\nwork what if we applied it to this thing\nhere and made it work that way then\nwe're all then now we're of one mind\nwe're of one of one Accord we might have\ndifferent thoughts and different ideas\nbut somehow they all come together\nbecause we're all there for the same\npurpose if you find out what the purpose\nis we're all going in the same direction\nwell then you can't necessarily go wrong\nyou won't really have to manage\neveryone's sort of imposter Center\nbecause it's not about us yeah about the\nbigger picture at hand how do we\napproach this challenge together and\nmake it work yeah yeah yeah I love that\nidea of I think that space of there's no\nbad ideas and uh don't judge someone for\ntheir bad ideas judge them for their\ngreat ones yeah and judge them for The\nBravery to even say the idea in the\nfirst place even though everyone knows\nit's Syrian and you're so right that so\noften a bad idea is actually the seed of\na great one it's just that you have to\nkind of put it away like take it apart\nand get rid of all the dust remember\nthere's actually something really\ninteresting there right like there's an\ninteresting perspective or a way of\nlooking at it yeah what do you think\nCynthia for you what's the biggest\nchange you've made in your life that you\nthink's had the biggest change in your\nlife like is there a habit a practice\nobviously running is a huge one that I\nthink we discussed is there anything\nelse a change that you've made\ninternally in your belief system or\nexternally or in your values that you\nthink is has been the Catalyst for all\nof these mindsets shifts and this this\ngreatness that has come your way like\ndoes that come from having had a\nreligious upbringing that you've\nspiritualized does it come you know\nbecause I'm always fascinated by like\nwhen you speak and when you put these\nideas together I'm like there's so much\nBeauty there's so much uh eloquence and\nthen there's Elegance to it too and then\nI'm like well where how do you know like\nI'm like I I love I I guess when you\nwere saying like when you're looking at\na role or a person actually you said a\nperson a real person not a character you\nwere saying like you love how they to\nfigure out how they walk and how they\ntalk and why they do this I think for me\nwhen I'm I'm fascinated by human\nbehavior from the point of view of how\ncan humans change right I think that's\nwhat like I get obsessed about I'm\nalways like well when that person made\nthat shift what did they do yeah that\nhelped them to make that shift and how\ncan other people benefit from that yeah\nor like how does that person make\ndecisions that makes them a better\ndecision maker or yeah why does that\nperson lie or steal or cheat or whatever\nit may be that ruins their life so I\nthink yeah I'm just trying to get to\nwhat change did you have to make a\nchange in mindset or do you think it was\na snowball effect of just these positive\nexperiences that you kept collecting\nthink it's like a slow and steady\naccumulation of trying just trying\nthings when I was younger I'd be I was a\nlittle scared when I when I first went\nto drum school what actually happened\nwas I met someone at a young access\ncompany I told you the story before Ray\nMcCann and she she told me I should go\nto drama school but before that I had I\nhad just gone out on a whim and decided\nI don't want to be it I can't go to\nuniversity and study this subject it's\nnot it doesn't feel right it's also like\nlistening to myself and being okay with\nthat this might be a terrible mistake\nbut I'm not going to do this thing and I\nthink everybody expected me to do so I'm\ngoing to leave University I'm gonna just\ntry this young actors company this\ncourse that's at a theater it's not it's\nnot an it's not a massive course that is\naround the world like nobody really\nknows about it but it just feels right\nso I'm gonna go there I bump into Rey\nwho I hadn't seen for five years she\ntells me to go to drama school I tell\nher no\nI say I'm not doing it that's there's no\nway I'm going to get in she says well\nyou can't come to this course if you\ndon't apply to this wow it's cool and I\nsay all right I will apply to this\nschool but only this school\njust this one\nonly because you asked and I'm only\napplying to this fine I apply and we and\nI do the work I don't phone it in I\nreally do work to to get to these\nauditions and\nsomehow I find myself in this drama\nschool World Academy dramatic arts it's\none of the best schools in the world for\nfor acting and I feel like a fish out of\nwater\nbut a lot of my experience at this\nschool is about what feels right for me\nbecause that's really how I can gauge it\nat one point like and I and I was\nphysical I was working out a lot and one\nof the teachers says oh you should stop\nworking out because you get you know you\nneed to get softer and I was like I\ndon't know that that's right I'm gonna\nI'm Gonna Keep working out because it's\ngood for my brain and my mind so I'm\ngoing to keep doing that and I find a\nperson in my class who happens to just\nplay the piano he plays the piano\nbeautifully so we just pick up books\nfrom the library that are scores of\nmusic and we go through these music\nscores one of them happens to be Wicked\nand we learn that school back to front I\nhave no idea that 10 odd years later wow\nthat thing is going to be the thing I'm\ndoing now no idea I have no idea I just\nlove the music and I and I know that\ngoing away to a music room with a piano\nwith this person to sing all this music\nfeels really good yeah feels good we're\ndoing these shows and we all are like\ntrying to get our agents and whatnot and\nI think I don't think the traditional\nway of getting an agent is really going\nto work for me so we put on a cabaret in\nthe bar because it feels good good I get\nmy agent and I finish early so when I go\nto do this thing we call it the tree\nwhich is like a presentation of\ndifferent scenes I just do the things\nthat feel good yeah and people love it\nand I feel good when I'm done and\nthere's no pressure there's no anxiety\nand I leave with a show to go to and\nit's been a series of what's my gut and\nmy heart telling me the color purple\ncame because I knew it was coming and I\nwas like I I know I'm supposed to play\nCelie I just I just know it\nI I can't tell you why but my gut is\ntelling me my heart is telling me that's\nwhat I'm supposed to do no idea about\nwhat's happening next we do this show in\na little theater with 200 people it's a\n200 seater that's it towards the Nar so\ndo you wanna do you think you would want\nto do this on Broadway I don't think\nthey're being serious cut to a year or\ntwo later we're on Broadway and we're\ndoing this show I have no idea of any of\nthis I think it's just accumulation of\ngenuinely listening to myself and not\nbeing afraid that the decision might be\nwrong totally you know yes because yes\nsome of it might be wrong but then it\nsomehow is right yes yeah yeah right\nyeah if you've just sparked something\nwith me that I think has has some uh\ntruth in it is the idea that if you\nlisten to everyone else chances are they\nmight be wrong right and if you listen\nto yourself chances are you might be\nright right and there might be some ways\nthat it goes wrong but when you're\nlistening to yourself you can take\nresponsibility right when it doesn't\nwork you can give it quicker right or is\nthat a fine when you listen to someone\nelse and it goes wrong then you just\nkeep blaming them again oh yeah I\nshouldn't have listened to that person\nright and it's like but no like you\ndon't need to listen to what they\nthought anyway and so I loved that and I\nlove all the dots and the can the cool\njoints yeah and that's the beauty of it\nlike looking back on it yeah there's\nthat beautiful\num quote from Steve Jobs where he said\nyou can't connect the dots moving\nforward right you only can when you're\nlooking backwards and I feel like when\nthat's exactly what this is you're like\nI just did this because it felt good\nyeah I did this and now when I look back\nand I I encourage everyone to not look\nfor the connection moving forward yeah\nlike you will find it no connection\nyou'll find it later yeah just keep keep\ntaking the steps forward again one step\nin front of the other yeah just keep\nmoving forward that's beautiful Cynthia\non that no I mean I could talk to you\nfor hours and I hope we will but uh we\nend every episode of on purpose with\nwhat we call uh there's two segments yes\nuh one of them is called the many sides\nof us okay where we ask you to use one\nword or one phrase okay to describe\nyourself through different mirrors and\ndifferent lenses and the other is the\nFast Five so uh here are your questions\nwhat is one word do a phrase that\nsomeone would say about you meeting you\nfor the first time\nI've been hearing she's it's very warm\nthat's beautiful I would have to agree\nyeah and you're very warm uh today I'm\nmeeting you first time even though we've\nspoken before and so I'm like very warm\nyou actually last time I interviewed you\nit was only audio so it's always\ndifferent when you finally and I was\nlike\nyou you have a way of speaking that\npeople want to listen right that's what\nI noticed about you I was like I\nactually care about what she has to say\nbecause if you're Caden to tone you're\njust yeah the texture of your voice I'm\nlike I'm so intrigued like so that that\nwas something as well that's special\nokay what is one word or phrase to\ndescribe what someone would say that\nknows you very well I'm stubborn ah yes\nstubborn about what I like to get things\ndone on my own and it's a trait that I\nam having to sort of like shift a little\nbit because there is that wonderful\npositive thing about I can get it done\nand I'm pragmatic I can get things done\nbut there's also the other part of like\nit's okay someone else can help you you\ncould help is good too yeah it took me\neight I know what that one feels like\nyeah I know yeah yeah I can relate to\nthat all right so it's not it's not\nstubborn in the same way my wife has got\nit I understood yeah all right let's\njust clarifying okay uh question number\nthree what is one word or phrase that\nyou would use to describe yourself open\nbeautiful what is a word or phrase that\nsomeone who maybe doesn't like you would\nsay about you difficult I don't settle\nright I I I'm so glad you brought that\nup let's let's have it so I get that\nfeedback a lot yeah and it comes from my\ninner\nresponsibility that I have this unique\nopportunity to serve the world in the\nway I want to and I never thought it\nwould be possible I'm very grateful for\nit right but now I can't settle right\nand I don't want to treat this as just a\njob or a career or it's so much more to\nme than any of those things tell me\nabout how you deal with that when you're\nseen as difficult in your way in your\nspecific experience of that word the way\nI've dealt with it it is has sort of\nshifted over time before I would\nprobably get defensive about it yeah\nit's in our nature to sort of like\ndefend ourselves when when we don't like\nthe thing that we're hearing about\nourselves now I think I'm I have more\npatience to sort of sit and be like the\nreason why you may think I am difficult\nor or see that is because I'm I'm maybe\nasking for things that feel like they're\nway it's just too much but actually I'm\nasking for the things that will allow me\nto be my Optimum self for you yeah so\nthat when we come away from this you\nknow I've given you everything I can\npossibly give you in the best possible\nway it just takes patience and\nunderstanding for us to be able to meet\nin the middle that's beautiful yeah I\nlove that great description okay uh\nquestion number\na five yeah what is a word or phrase\nthat you're trying to embody today\nsomething that you're working on\nsomething that you're today I have this\nalready but I think it's an everyday\nVoyage Joy just seeking joy in every day\nlike in little things being able to\nfinish organizing something or I did my\nvanity that around my bathroom and I\nthink it looks really tidy that's a\nlittle piece of Joy meeting people on\nthe streets I run little piece of Joy I\nfound I don't know a chocolate bar that\nI haven't had for ages Joy you know I've\nmanaged to get everything ready and I\ngot the right outfit my my water's\nprepared I'm prepared to date Joy like\nfinding pieces of joy in the little\nmoments so that we aren't just waiting\nfor big massive things to happen that it\nactually is an everyday\nbuildup of goodness yeah so that when\nthe big things come they're just like a\ncherry on top yeah yeah I love that\nthat's beautiful yeah and I wanted to\nend with our final conversation around\nwhat we talked about briefly before we\nstarted was that you were saying that\nyou're at this point in life where\nyou're trying to figure out the\ndifference between speaking from a place\nof love and then speaking from a place\nof fear so often we're trying to speak\nfrom a place of love but really we end\nup speaking from a place of protecting\nus yes yeah and I wanted to hear how you\nfelt today when you were sharing like\nhow has that evolved for you because I\nthink you're so right I think especially\npeople in the public eye yeah are always\nbeing from a place of fear yeah because\neverything you say is like can be taken\napart and can be highlighted and can be\nblown up out of proportion and so walk\nme through that for you I think that we\nwe've misconstrued what what it means to\nspeak from a place of love because we\nbelieve that speaking from a place of\nLove is protecting someone's feelings\nbut by protecting someone's feelings\nprotecting your own because you don't\nwant that person's feeling to come back\nat you and make you feel hurt\nbut actually if you speak from a place\nof love you are actually communicating\nwith another person about what can can\nhelp both of you meet somewhere in the\nmiddle and understand one another so if\nI say let's say something as simple as\nsomeone has said something that's hurt\nyour feelings instead of saying that\nthing you said hurt my feelings\nand I know that that wasn't what you\nmeant to do but that's how I felt that\nperson can go I'm so sorry I didn't need\nto that's not what I meant at all now\nwe've not exacerbated anything I've just\ntold you how I felt from a place of not\nafraid that you're going to get\ndefensive about what you said it's not\nyou said that thing and I don't think it\nwas right and it was really mean\ndifferent turn of phrase isn't it you're\nnot speaking from a place of this is how\nit felt when it when it came to me is\nthat what you meant yeah now there's a\nspace to to have a conversation about\nwell actually maybe this is what I meant\nI know I understand okay well now we can\nhave a discussion about something yeah\nwhen we speak from a place of love what\nwe're actually doing is giving the other\nthe other person an opportunity to be\nunderstood and therefore you get the\nchance to be understood as well when we\nspeak from a place of fear we're trying\nto stop the other person from getting\nupset to stop ourselves from feeling\neven more rejection or more upset and we\ncan't walk around like that we're\nessentially walking around like broken\nshelves that doesn't work we want to\nallow people to make themselves whole\nevery time we have a conversation with\nthem yeah to leave a conversation\nthinking oh I learned something I\nunderstand something I know something if\nyou leave a conversation going did I\nactually get what I needed from that and\nthat's often how people leave\nconversations especially arguments you\nleave an argument you think I don't\nthink I got what I wanted from that yeah\nI don't think I got the ex the\nconversation I needed out of that I'm\nstill missing things I'm still not\nunderstanding certain things because we\nweren't speaking from a place of how do\nwe solve this how do we how do we make\nmake this better we're just sort of I\nwant to be heard you want to be heard as\nopposed to I want to understand you so\nthat you can understand me now we walk\naway thinking oh we got something yeah\nand so usually by the end of those\nconversations when you're like I want to\nunderstand you want to understand you're\nlike you're good I'm good yeah all right\nshould we start again yeah let's start\nagain that tends to be how those\nconversations end up I want those yeah\nyeah I want those too it makes so much\nsense and today's today's been a\nconversation filled with love filled\nwith joy yeah filled with a lot of\nunderstanding and I know anyone who\nlistens to this speaking to you is like\nthere's there's a there's a therapeutic\nnature to it it's very like I I feel\nlike anyone who listens to this or\nwatches this is gonna walk away just\nfeeling a sense of Joy genuinely because\nI think the way you talk about your life\nthe way you talk about these Miracles\nthe way you talk about the connection\nthe way you talk about the the work but\nalso the wisdom that comes from it is is\nreally special and beautiful so thank\nyou so much thank you for being here\ntoday thank you for doing this I hope\nyou had fun I did it's lovely and I hope\nyou feel heard and seen and understood\nvery much

effortlessly and the secret to\nmaking better decisions when people talk\nabout procrastination when they talk\nabout overthinking what they're really\ntalking about is they're talking about\nthe first step once you take the first\nstep it's used"
