New\nYork Times best-selling author\nphilanthropist DJ designer recording\nartist actress host model and influencer\nParis has defined and dominate aided pop\nculture commanding her position as

in\nRevenue in 2001 variety declared Paris\nHilton as a billion dollar entrepreneur\nin recognition of a successful business\nand Global brand piracy new book is out\nnow it's called Paris the Memoir I\nliterally just finished reading it and\ntoday we have Paris Hilton in the studio\nParis thank you for being here thank you\nthank you for the introduction oh I\nmeant and congratulations you know I\nwhenever I sit down with someone who's\nwritten a memoir and I want everyone\nwho's listening to really understand\nthis because I think people see Memoirs\ncoming out and they see books coming out\nand you just you kind of think like oh\nyeah someone's just telling their story\nand I think what I found really\nfascinating about yours is I can't\nimagine how hard it was\nto retell so many of these stories\nand to relive so many of them and I just\nwanted to thank you for being able to go\nthere so many times because I think\neven though as in your own words where\npeople may\nthink that they don't relate to you I\nactually think that the stories you tell\nare so much more relatable than people\nwould expect and I just want to thank\nyou for for sharing them so vulnerably\nthank you yeah that's definitely\nvery difficult and emotional but\nextremely just therapeutic just\nputting it all out there because it's so\nmuch that I've held on to for so long\nand so many things that I've never told\nanyone the things I've never even wanted\nto say out loud because I didn't even\nwant to think that they were real\nbut um\nit's just been um the most healing\nexperience of my life so you feel it's\nactually been healing even though it's\nuneasy yes it's actually been something\nthat has been therapeutic it's been\nhealthier than unhealthy were there pots\nwhere you're like oh gosh I just need a\nbreak from this like definitely so many\nparts just because I've been through so\nmany traumatic experiences in my life so\njust to have to write them down and then\ndoing the audiobook was even that was\neven harder having to say things out\nloud especially in a room with three\nstrangers I've never met before and\nhaving to tell my story but I'm so happy\nthat I did my audio book as well because\nI think it's important for people to\nhear the story from the person who wrote\nit yeah that's such a great Point too\neven having to say out loud for yourself\nI think so many of us we hold our truth\nso deeply buried inside of us and we\nmight think it but we never actually\nspeak it out loud and that's that's such\na great example I never thought about it\nlike that I think the other thing before\nwe dive in I wanted to mention which I\nloved about your Memoir is\nyou were so phenomenally observant I\nalmost feel like you had a Hawkeye where\nlike you were able you're like able to\nlike find all these details you're\nincredibly smart like phenomenally like\na stew just splatting these tiny details\nand patterns and connections and the\nstories you tell in the history you\ntelling I was I I really enjoyed it I\nliterally felt like you were talking to\nme and I read it I didn't listen to it\nuh and now I left to listen to it but I\nread it and I literally felt like I was\nlike this talking to you yes\nyeah it's hard to do that it's hard to\npull that off so I just want everyone to\nknow who's going to read it that you're\nreally going to feel that where I wanted\nto start was\nyou talked a lot about how and I think\nthis is completely true you said most of\nus regret things that we\ndidn't do not things that we did do\nbut you said in your 20s there are a few\nthings you do regret and I was wondering\nwere there regrets that you did do or\ndidn't do and what were they for me I\nfeel that everything that I've done in\nlife has made me who I am and I'm such a\nstrong person and especially after\nwriting this book and just seeing my\nlife story and everything that I've been\nthrough I feel that I don't have regrets\nin life because it's made me\nthe woman I am today what made you say\nthat that chapter that I think you were\njust like I've got a couple of regrets\nlike even if there were silly ones like\nI'm guessing there weren't any big ones\nrelationships like I wish I didn't meet\ncertain people like I I wish I didn't\nlet certain people in my life that\nshouldn't have been in my life be full\nof bad intentions because I've\nespecially growing up was just always\njust so trusting of everyone and would\nlet anyone in and there's so many people\nwho just didn't deserve that do you\nthink you've got better at assessing and\nevaluating energy and intentions around\nyou because of all your bad and negative\nexperiences you're saying do you feel\nlike you've found a better radar or is\nit just something that we all keep\nmaking mistakes on because it's so hard\nbecause what I read is you want to be a\ntrusting person you want to be a a\nloving person you want to feel loved\nlike we all do but have you found that\nyou've got better at it and if so what\nwould you say you've got better at in\nterms of sensing people's energy and\nintention\nI think in the beginning I was just\nunexperienced in life so I I really\ndidn't know and I had been through so\nmuch in life so I think I\nwas just after the trauma that I\nexperienced as a teenager I was not I\ndon't know I think in the right\nheadspace to make decisions on being in\na relationship like the first person I\nstarted a relationship with I was not\nready for that and\nbecause of so many things that happened\nto me my heart just had this huge wall\naround it for a very long time and so\nmany things had happened that it made me\nnot trust anyone\nand it wasn't until with my husband that\nI\nhad those walls come down and I actually\nlet someone in but that took me a very\nlong time just from\nso many life experiences that made that\nmean that way yeah and I want to and I\nwant to get to that because I want to\ntalk about a lot of those things you\njust mentioned but one line that really\ntook me like kind of spellbound me in\nyour book was everyone was under the\nspell of love and money and when I read\nthat I was thinking about it and I was\nwondering it kind of aligns with what\nyou're saying here is that a lot of\npeople with negative intentions or\nunhealthy intentions are often under the\nspell of love and money and that makes\nthem do crazy things I mean what were\nsome of the craziest thing you saw\npeople do maybe not even to you but what\nwere some of those things that you saw\nwhen people were Bound by the spell of\nlove and money as you say what what lens\nhave you seen people go to I just have\nseen people\nchange where money can just take over\ntheir mind and\nwho they are as a person and any like\nvalues they have would just go to the\nside to seeing people change especially\nFame and money\nI've just seen so many people come into\nthis town some people come and go and\nthe fame and the money get to their head\nso much where they become a different\nperson and start thinking that they're\nbetter than others and treating others\nbeneath them and that's something that I\nhate more than anything I when someone\nis unkind to someone and treats someone\nas if they're lower than them that's\nlike one of the things that is one of my\npet peeves yeah it's interesting right\nlike you can't buy class like Fame and\nmoney come by class I've always felt\nthat way that yes when you see people\ncome into those things it doesn't change\nyour taste or your habits or your values\nit kind of just amplifies who you\nalready are I think I've heard many\npeople say where it almost just it\nalmost exposes you for who you really\nare when when those things come your way\nyes I think you said in the book or\nyou've said once before when asked about\nself-esteem and I really want to talk\nabout the things that happened in your\nteenage years but I think self-esteem is\nsuch a big Topic in the world today\nespecially because of social media\nespecially because of so much\nself-judgment and self-criticism and\nwhen you've been asked before you've\nmentioned like you're good at pretending\nsometimes or you have been good at\npretending and I wonder\nwhen was it that you allowed yourself to\nto stop pretending and really start\nworking on it like like what did that\ntake because I feel like most of us it's\nso much more easier to pretend and we\nhide behind it but I feel like you\nclaiming your narrative back in this\nbook was almost saying\nwell I'm not going to let what's\nhappened to me Define my self-esteem\nwould you say that's fair or definitely\neveryone goes through that and\nit took me a while just after what I had\nwent through\nmy self-esteem was just\ndestroyed from the things that were said\nto me and the abuse that I suffered when\nI was a teenager at these\ntroubled teen schools I don't even like\nto call them schools and it wasn't until\nmy documentary back in 2019 where I\nreally started doing this\njust whole path of self-discovery and\nreally just talking about so many things\nI had never told anyone and\nthen with now my book that was the\nsecond part of it because I wasn't even\nready at that point to open up in ways I\ndid but I've just grown so much in the\npast couple years and\nthan getting married with my husband\nthat's just my life has completely\nchanged and I'm going to be always\nforever so grateful to Alexandra Dean\nthe director of my documentary because\nthat film literally changed my life\nmaking it change your life yes in so\nmany ways and now really just turning my\npain into a purpose and helping make a\ndifference in other people's lives has\njust been so rewarding and I feel that\npeople understand me in ways that\nthey didn't before yeah yeah and it just\nfeels really good to finally be\nunderstood I want to tap into some of\nthose\nevents because I think\nI actually think there's more people\nsuffering in silence than people who are\nvocal about the pain and what they've\nbeen through and I think that what I\nmeant earlier which I said this to you\noffline but I want to repeat it here on\nthe show that\nI think a lot of people for a lot part\nof your life see parts of your life as\nunrelatable but then when you open up\nabout these things in the book I\nactually think I have a lot of friends\nand especially women that I know that\nhave been through similar things but\nhave never opened up and have held it\ntight or opened up to a couple of people\nand so I'm hoping that with you opening\nup in this way a lot of people will look\nat that and go well maybe I need to talk\nto someone or maybe I can reach out so I\nI wanted to talk about some of them I\nmean the first one that comes up is\nyou have your teacher who you call Mr\nAbercrombie who's like manipulating you\nand grooming you and making you think in\na certain way and it's really\ninteresting because our teenage years of\nthese years where like we wait to be\nliked to feel likeable or we wait for\nsomeone to desire us to feel desirable\nand I think you're in like eighth grade\nyes and he's preparing you in this way\nand then you know he takes you in his\ncar one night and he kisses you and\npulls you into him and like you know\nit's completely against your will you\ndon't know what's going on at the same\ntime it's nice to be like wanted and you\ntalk about that before\nI can't imagine that being someone's\nlike you know first kiss to that degree\nand like\nyou talk about how like because your\nparents kind of caught you and of course\nthe book goes into much more depth I'm\njust synthesizing it for the for the\nquestion but\nyou didn't want to talk about it with\nthem and they didn't talk about it with\nyou like what does it feel like when you\nhold on to uncomfortable things what\ndoes that feel like and then what gave\nyou the courage to actually say\nI need to talk about this\nfor me\num\nhow my family was we didn't like to talk\nabout things and\nfor that when that happened you know I\nwas\n14 years old and he\ncompletely took advantage of his power\nas you know a teacher at the school\nand to be\ndoing that to a little girl was just so\nwrong and um I'm so glad that my parents\nended up driving out the driveway\nbecause\nwho knows what he would have tried to do\nand\nafter that happened I just\ndidn't ever talk about with my family up\nuntil a few weeks ago when I asked my\nmom and I said that night that you\ncaught me in the car and you were\nchasing me\nin the car and everything did you know\nwho that was and she said no I was like\noh I always thought my whole since I was\na teenager I thought that she knew that\nit was that and she had no idea until\nnow\nshe just thought it was some teenage boy\nwow up to like a couple of minutes ago\nup until a couple weeks ago when she\nread my book and what was her reaction\nto that I mean what a shark she just\ncouldn't believe it she was in shock of\nso many things in the book she\nmy sister and her we just spoke about it\nlike\nmy house a few weeks ago and they were\nboth just\ncrying and saying I can't believe it you\ndidn't tell us any of this like I wish\nyou could have came to us but it's just\nit's hard to talk about things and\nespecially when you're raised in that\nway where you don't really\ntalk about anything that's hard\nit's been difficult\num but I'm so glad that I finally got\nthe courage to do it and\nI know that my story is really important\nand I wish that I had this book back\nwhen I was a teenager because I would\nhave definitely not felt so alone and\nmisunderstood yeah yeah I mean I it's\nreally interesting isn't it family like\nwe feel so close to we all feel and I\nthink you do a I think you'd really\nhelpfully talk about how like no one's\nfamily is perfect but you love your\nfamily but then there's complex and\nthat's that's just I think a lot of us\nhave that experience where it's like\nour families would say the same thing\nlike why didn't you tell me but then at\nthe same time it's like well if I told\nyou you may not have reacted in a way\nthat was helpful\ndid you feel like did do you feel like\nwhen your mom read that she like felt\nsome kill or like oh how did she carry\nthat like definitely felt guilty I I\nthink as a kid you just you're scared\nlike oh I'm gonna get in trouble and\nI think that's\nsomething that shame is such a powerful\npowerful thing and that's a really\nimportant message in my book that the\nshame shouldn't be on you it should be\non the person that hurt you and I felt\nlike I just hold held on to so much\nshame my whole life because of other\npeople hurting me\nand it feel I think\nother people who've been through the\nsame thing need to hear that as well\nthat is so powerful I just want everyone\nwho's listening or watching right now to\ngo back and listen to that because that\nwhat you just said is so true I'm gonna\ntry and repeat what parishes said so\nbeautifully that when someone else dumps\nsomething to you the shame should not\nactually be something you have to feel\nand experience it's actually on them\nand yeah I was noticing that I actually\nwas when I was making notes it was like\nshame and embarrassment are these\nconstant themes in the book and it's so\ninteresting because all of us in our\nlives we always feel embarrassed for\nsomeone else what will my parents think\nof what I did or I feel so ashamed of\nmyself for what someone did to me when\nactually what you just said is\nthey should be feeling shameful of what\nthey did but like Mr Abercrombie that\nday in the car just drops you off\nand runs away because they want to like\njust run away from that and you start to\nrealize actually that person is feeling\nso much shame yeah that they're trying\nto they have to lie to themselves about\nit in order to escape it but I love that\nI hope that everyone is listening just\nfeels freed by recognizing that the\nshame you're feeling is actually for the\nperson who hurt you to feel and what\nwhat really hit me was also just again\ntalking about vocalizing things you said\nit took you so long to even use the word\npedophile yeah because you didn't want\nto\nexplain to us why it was important to\nuse the word but why it took you long\nI think that I had just been so\nmanipulated by him\nand I didn't want to think of myself as\na victim but now as an adult I look back\non that and think of when I have a\ndaughter one day and she's a teenager\nand if someone had tried to do something\nlike that to her I couldn't even imagine\nand it just angers me and I never had\ntold anyone that story but I know it's\nan important story because I know that's\nsomething that happens every day to\npeople\nI literally read your book as if I was\nreading about my daughter like that's\nhow I was like\nand I don't have a daughter but I was I\nhave a younger sister who I've always\nbeen very protective of and to me when I\nwas reading a book that's literally the\nlens what you just said is how I read\nthe book where I was just like if this\nhappened in my like my younger old\nyounger child even son like whoever it\nis I can't imagine\nhow upset I'd feel if I didn't keep that\ndoor open for them and I just want to\nyou know if there's any parents\nlistening as well\nI just hope that this inspires you to\nreally keep that door open with your\nkids because it's so easy to judge them\nand it's so easy to make it out like you\nmade every right decision and your kids\nare making bad decisions but\nI promise you you'll be so much happier\nif\nthe communication lines are always open\nI mean speaking of communication with\nparents\nyou you said there were some things that\nwere difficult for your moment to\ndiscuss obviously this was one of them\nlike\nwhat were the other things that you felt\nyour mum really\nlike was just shocked by and just felt\nlike she wished you could have spoken to\nher about it\nmy mom had me when she was 19. so she\nwas a kid herself and that generation\nlike\nI think a lot of people really didn't\ntalk about their feelings like no one\nwas talking about mental health it was\njust I think that generation is just how\nthey were raised so I could understand\nwhy she was that way\nand now ever since\nshe's read my book and watched my\ndocumentary and has learned so much for\nme in that way we've just never been\ncloser so it's been uh\na really healing experience for both of\nus as well yeah and I hope that\nencourages anyone who's felt like that\nfor a long time because like you're\nsaying most of us are not going to tell\nour parents what we're doing when we're\ndoing it like I I was the same I had so\nmany secrets from my parents like my\nparents never knew about any of the\ngirlfriends I had my parents never knew\nabout anything that I was up to because\nI was scared of them\nbeing mad at me and upset with me\nbecause the the line in my house was\nfocus on your education don't worry\nabout girlfriends and so as a young boy\nall you care about is having girlfriends\nyeah and I was like well as long as I\ncan get good grades I'm just gonna carry\non doing all this other stuff and it's\ninteresting because I feel like even as\nwe get older we're still scared of our\nparents right like yeah it's almost like\nit never stops and so it's it's always\nso strange like me and my wife talk\nabout this all the time like she talks\nabout her like she's still scared\nsometimes to tell her parents uh about\nwhat she's up to or whatever I always\nfeel like a teenager with my parents I\ndon't know why I just is how it is yeah\nand all of us feel that way and there's\nthis uh\nthere's it's so important that I think\nwe get the courage even as adults\nbecause a lot of us are like oh that was\nthe past it doesn't matter but actually\nit will it will actually change the\nrelationship you have with your parents\nwhen when you can actually open up the\nlines of trust the on the flip side you\nhave a beautiful relationship with your\ngrandma like that comes across in the\nbook so like strongly and beautifully\nand when you speak about her I feel like\nit just comes out the page and it's\nbeaming and like your your appreciation\nand your admiration for her is just this\namazing thing what would you say is a\nlesson that you think has stayed with\nyou that she taught you that is like\nthat you still\ncarry with you every day like what would\nyou say that would be if you had to pick\none she was just a force of nature like\njust walk in a room and light it up and\nalways made me feel so confident and I\nremember when\nI was a little girl she told me that she\nwent to a psychic and the psychic said\none day your granddaughter is going to\nbe one of the most famous the most\nphotograph women in the world\nand she said I know that's going to\nhappen one day and I just want you to\nalways remain the same sweet\ndown to earth girl that you are with\nsuch a big heart and so kind and never\nlet that get to your head and that was\nsomething that I always\nkept close to my heart and nothing ever\nchanged no matter what happened to my\nlife I always remain the same sweet\nperson and I think that's so important\nto be kind\nand that's something that she really\ninstilled in me my whole life\nyeah I mean that that sounds like a\ngreat thing everyone should tell their\nkids like I love all of that because\nit's almost like I believe in you I know\nyou're going to be successful but don't\nforget where you came from who you are\nand how you treat people like that's\nwhat's what's foundational and really\nimportant and\nyeah it's it's we all need that figure\nin our lives like whether it's a\ngrandparent uncle aunt a friend who\nreminds us of who we need to continue to\nbe because it's so easy to get\ndistracted but\nwhat I think is really interesting is\nhow you kept that mindset when so you go\nand I know you don't like calling it a\nschool and and I agree from your\ndescription of the cedu right sea deal\nyeah one of them Provo Canyon school\nyeah Cascade and Ascent yeah so like\nlooking at all of these facilities even\nwhen they're taking you there it almost\nfeels like you're being kidnapped yeah\nyou have handcuffs walking through an\nairport when you're not a convict or you\nknow you haven't done something illegal\nand then it's even like when they\nexplain it they're like we're going to\nthis place to fix you and your reaction\nis\noh that is nothing wrong to fix like\nwhat do you think what I'm fascinated by\nis like how did you\nhold on to the idea that there was\nnothing to fix when everything around\nyou is programming you to believe that\nyou're broken you're wrong and\nyour\nneeding fixing like how do you not take\nthat all in I knew that I didn't deserve\nto be there and you know I wasn't a bad\nkid I'd live a very strict life\num very sheltered then I moved to New\nYork City\nstarted sneaking out getting bad grades\nand my parents talked to a therapist who\nrecommended that I go to these emotional\ngrowth boarding schools\nand they had no idea they just thought\nit was a normal boarding school and um\nthe way they take kids to these places\nis they have two men come into your room\nin the middle of the night and say do\nyou want to go the easy way or the hard\nway and literally hold up handcuffs and\nthis is how children are brought to\nthese places and\num\nit's extremely traumatizing that's\nsomething I had severe nightmares for\ntwo decades it wasn't until my\ndocumentary and all the advocacy work\nthat I've been doing that those\nnightmares have finally went away\nbut\nfor me I just\nalways thought to myself that I am I\nknow that I'm a good person I don't\ndeserve to be in here and\nthat was the only thing that caught me\nkeeping kept me going was who I was\ngoing to become and what I wanted to be\nwhen I got out of there\ndid you see other people break down like\ndid you see other people around you just\nlike because I I find that to be one of\nthe hardest things where if you're being\ntold you're broken if you're being told\nyou're wrong if you're being told\nyou're\nwrong and you know letting your parents\ndown and by the way you're doing very\nnormal things at this point like there's\nlike you know like I think sneaking out\nyou know getting it getting bad grades\ngetting in trouble is actually pretty\nnormal for any teenage kid and I had\nattention deficit yeah disorder which no\none knew because no one was talking\nabout that either yeah so that's the\nreason I couldn't pay attention in\nschool and was getting bad grades and no\none knew why they just thought that I\nwas purposely trying to not pay\nattention but I just really couldn't\nfocus yeah yeah and it's incredible to\nthink that and this I think this is\nwhat's coming out so much today where\npeople who weren't able to focus at\nschool because of ADHD or or other\nchallenges that they have are doing\nphenomenally well in business yes and in\nlife and it's like you start to\nrecognize that there isn't this\ncorrelation between it's not like oh if\nyou did got good grades you had a great\ncareer or great profession it could very\nwell be the opposite how do you find\nyou've been able to\nwhat's different about business than\nschool I guess that you've been so\npassionate about and been so prolific at\nthat you feel is different about how you\nwere approach school I\nput my ADHD I consider it my superpower\nand I think that's why in business and\neverything that I've done I've always\nbeen very future thinking and thinking\noutside of the box\nand\nbeing a risk taker and someone who is an\ninnovator and Pioneer\nand I really attribute that to\nmy superpower\nyeah but how do you how do you I guess\nno how does not always being able to\nforce yourself to focus actually become\na superpower in business like that how\ndoes that work\nthinking in a different way and\nwith ADHD my doctor Dr Holloway says\nthat it's like having\na brain of like a Ferrari with bicycle\nbrakes so you're kind of just always\nmoving really fast and thinking really\nfast and I think that's\nwhy in business I've done so many things\nfirst because I just\nI don't know just took a risk and I'm\nimpulsive yeah and that can so and\nthat's interesting isn't it because it's\nalmost like in school everything has to\nhave a process and a method and a\napproach where sometimes in business\nactually trying something out and being\nimpulsive or making a intuitive decision\ncan actually work out whereas being\nintuitive school is not valued at all\nyeah I think I just found it to be\nboring besides I loved art class about\nmusic class but math was not my favorite\nyeah yeah my favorite subjects at school\nwere are InDesign philosophy\nand I I was I enjoyed economics because\nof how it was taught but art in design\nand philosophy were by far my favorite\nsubjects at school and it's really\ninteresting because when I was at school\nall I'd ever hear is Jay those are dumb\nsubjects to focus on don't focus on\nthose subjects they're not going to get\nyou a job and now when I look at my life\nI feel like my entire life is are in\ndesign philosophy and economics so\nthat's that's literally it and so it's\ninteresting how we all have strengths\nthat that we miss out on I wanted to\nroll back a few years because\nthe experience that you describe about\nmeeting the guy in the mall\nand then\nit's almost like you go through this\nexperience and you wake up there\nyou wake up and you're like you know\nwhat's happened but again it's another\nmoment\nwhere you don't want to tell anyone\nabout what's happened\nand I just feel every time I was reading\nyour book and I've read these points it\nwas like a punch in the gut for me I was\njust like I can't believe it that\nsomething keeps happening\nthat is not something that you're\ninviting or encouraging and it's someone\ntaking advantage it's someone going\nfar beyond any point of consent and\nagain you're having to hold on to it can\nyou walk us through that and just talk\nagain about what it feels like to have\nto hold on to something the second time\naround especially when this is like from\nyour first kiss to your first sexual\nexperience how does that keep\naccelerating internally like what's\ngoing on internally\nthat was another thing in my book that I\nhad never told anyone like after that\nhappened I never said it out loud again\nand just tried to forget it and um\nmy friend and I were at the mall when I\nwas\n15 and a half yeah and we had met these\ntwo older guys that we had seen like\nevery weekend there and they got our\nnumbers and invited us over\nand I had never drank alcohol in my life\nbefore and he had these\nwine Berry coolers these wine coolers\nand kept telling me to drink it and\npressuring me and I kept saying no and\nthen it was like it's open just do it so\nI had a couple sips and then\nit was roofied and knocked out and woke\nup with him on top of me and\nWhispering or dreaming you're dreaming\nand um\nthat was just terrifying to go through\nand something that I\nfelt ashamed for when again that was not\nmy fault this was\nsomeone who took advantage of a young\ngirl\nand how did it feel like a second time\nthinking I can't tell anyone again\nI guess my question is with with shame\nand embarrassment keep cycling in this\nway\ndo you feel like you literally held on\nto that shame and embarrassment until\nthe doc in the book like would you say\nyou've carried it for that long and what\ndoes that feel like is it Festus\nit's extremely\nit's isolating you just feel alone just\nlike that no one knows but it's\nsomething that you're holding on to and\nyeah it was something I held on to until\nI wrote it in my book because I know\nthat has happened to so many other\npeople and ever since I've released my\nbook so many people have written me\nletters and contacted me on social media\nor met my book signings that have went\nthrough the same experience and\nthey were all thanking me for\nthem not feeling alone and them being\nable to talk about it for the first time\nand hold people accountable for what\nthey did to them yeah why do you think\nwe do that why do you think we don't\nkeep those people accountable but we see\nit as our\nmistake or our\nyou know you walk away thinking I'm such\nan idiot I'm so stupid I shouldn't have\ndone that like why do you think that is\nwhy is it that we just reflected back\nonto ourselves seeing as you've gone\nthrough things like that\ndon't know why we do that I wish I knew\nwhy\nbut I think\nwhen people can talk about things like\nthis and\nit makes others feel safe to be able to\ntalk about it as well\nand that's something that I'm working on\nevery day just all of this this is like\nI've been healing but there's so much\nthere and I've now put it out to the\nwhole world and it's just\nit's been um\nhard just\ntalking about it and just thinking about\nit yeah but again I know it's important\nfor others to hear\nwe're so quick to judge others so when\nwe hear about these things if it's never\nhappened to us we always think oh but\nthey could have avoided it\nand then when it happens to you you\nreflect that judgment onto yourself and\nyou think oh I could have avoided it and\nso it's almost like the more we judge\nothers and we're quick to judge others\nwe actually judge ourselves more and the\nmore we judge ourselves more the more we\nare judging others and it kind of\nbecomes this vicious cycle where we\njudge ourselves we self-sabotage we\nself-criticize then we judge others we\ncriticize them we point fingers and it\njust keeps going around and it's almost\nlike if we gave ourselves more grace\nwe'd give others more Grace and if we\ngive others more grace we'd give\nourselves more grace and I do think that\nwhen people tell their stories like I I\ncan't relate or say I've gone through\nanything that you've gone through but\nhearing your story\nand I'm sure for the people who have\nbeen victims and have gone through these\nthings\noh I'm hoping that it creates a sense of\nempathy and compassion and Grace for\neveryone because I think the reason we\ndon't tell everyone is because we think\nthat they somehow think it was our fault\nwould you yeah and have you felt this\ntime when you've opened up through your\nbook do you still feel that there's been\njudgment back because I know in the past\nwhen things have happened there's been a\nsense of like you've talked about before\nlike the idea of when you uh see when\nyou're seen as a sex symbol it's like\nyou're like I like the symbol part\nbecause that's like iconic but it's like\nwhen people start labeling you\nwould you say that this time when you're\nsharing the book you felt that people\nhave really received it well through the\nbook as opposed to other ways or do you\nstill find that there's still some\njudgment that's always going to be there\nthe reaction to the book has just been\nincredible just overwhelming with so\nmuch love and support and\njust the things that people have said to\nme at the book signings and every single\ninterview and people are just\nit just feels amazing\nfinally be understood and\nhave people respect me and\nhave empathy and kindness and\nI feel because I played a character for\nso long people had no idea and now they\nknow that there's so much more to me and\nthat's been incredible if I haven't felt\nany any negative energy at all so that's\njust been\nthe best feeling ever that makes me so\nhappy yeah I'm so happy to hear that\nhonestly congratulations you deserve\nthat and little Paris deserves that too\nand you know I'm so happy to hear that\nbecause I think being understood is is\nthe hardest thing and\nespecially being understood for the\ntrauma that's unseen like everyone sees\nthe page six or sees the front cover or\nsees whatever but no one really\nreally sees the inner child that\nactually went through all of this\nbecause that's that's the part of you\nthat the character is covering the\ncharacter's not covering the truth it's\ncovering the inner child that's\nexperiencing all of this and is not\nmature enough and not smart enough and\nnot ready enough to endure so much\nsuffering in in so much pain yeah does\nyour inner child feel safer now does it\nor or how do you think about your inner\nchild with the healing work that you're\ndoing finally feel safe just with\neverything my husband is just so\nincredible having my little baby boy I\njust feel that my life is thank you\ncomplete finally I just feel that I've\nbuilt a real life and I'm\njust so proud of everything that I've\naccomplished and just reading my story\nI'm\na Survivor and I'm a badass\nI love that that's I mean it's you\ndefinitely are you definitely are it's\nuh\nbut and and you see it you know it's\nlike it's challenging because you know\nthere's so many people that the media\nkind of\nnaturally picks on in that way and\nsometimes it's good for business and\nsometimes it makes sense for the\ncharacter and but there's always more\ngoing on and I feel like you and you\nknow even someone who's your close\nfriend like Britney Spears as well like\nhave both had\nthe kind of tabloid clickbait articles\netc etc etc and I think you went to a\nwedding last year too and you've stayed\nstrong even though sometimes the media\npits you against each other or does that\nhow have you managed because I feel like\nthere's something really interesting\nthat's happened in in culture when you\nstarted influencing using that word from\nyour book\nthere was a lot of like even even for\nactors back in the day and musicians\nwhat I've heard is it was like well you\ncan you are the only influencer and\neveryone else can't be if they come up\nthen you're gonna go down I had a lot of\nactors tell me that what they were told\nis you have to be the number one black\nactor and if you're friends with the\nother black actor then you can't be\nfriends because people are going to\nchoose one of you and I feel like that\nhappens in culture and race it happens\nin careers it happens in Industries how\ndid you manage to keep a real friendship\nwith Brittany during a time when all of\nthis is happening to both of you at the\nsame time like how do you keep a genuine\nrelationship at that level where you're\nboth\nthese these huge tabloid targets\nfor me because we understand each other\nand she's\none of the kindest most downed Earth\npeople and this\njust so lovely I think it's important\nwhen women support each other\nbecause we're all in this together and\nI think the 2000s were definitely about\ntrying to pit women against each other\nin the media and\nthey were so cruel to us and targeted us\nand it was really difficult to have to\ndeal with just the constant pressure\nfrom the media and people inventing\nstories and Paparazzi chasing and it was\njust\nreally crazy time\nbut it's important when then you can\nhave friends around you that can\nunderstand that because they go through\nthe similar experiences yeah I think I\nthink that's the hardest part right like\nthere's only like one percent of people\nwho are having any given experience and\nthat applies across the board and it's\nlike if you're not friends with people\nwho are going through the same thing and\nhave the courage to open up to each\nother you can feel so alone yeah and\nit's amazing that you've been able to\nmaintain that because it almost feels\nlike as more rumors get told you're more\nscared is that would you say that's fair\nlike do you feel as more comes out about\nyou that's not true you become more\nfearful how people view you I think in\nthe book you talk about one point like\nyou're like every room I go into I know\nwhat people have seen or what they know\nI guess my question is how has that\nstopped you from just closing off and\nhiding and actually going well no I'm\nstill going to be who I want to be\nbecause I can imagine that when you walk\nin already feeling like you have a big\nsign on your forehead\nit's it's hard to walk into new places\nbut you keep doing it with business you\nkeep working in boardrooms you keep\nwalking into new environments like how\nhave you found that strength just from\nbeing in this business for so long and\nalso what I went through as a teenager\nat these schools just made me\nI think prepared me for Hollywood in a\nway because I had just been through\nsuch abuse that literally I could take\nanything you build a tough skin when\nyou're constantly around this for sure\nthe abuse in the schools was worse yes\nso it definitely prepared me for\nanything\nare you still friends with anyone who\nwent to the schools that you kind of\nstayed connected with and if they kind\nof found themselves again or I\nreconnected with some of the people that\nI was there with\num and it's just been amazing just to\ncome together and tell our stories and\njust have made so much impact and now\nI've changed laws in nine states and now\ngoing back to Washington DC in two weeks\nto introduce our new bill to push for\nfederal legislation\nso it's just been really empowering just\nto\nmeet with people that have been through\nthe same thing as me and who knew me\nbefore all of this\nand now to really fused our voices and\nare now saving children's lives I'm so\nglad that we're talking about this on on\npurpose because I feel like that is such\na journey of pain into purpose and I\nthink you said it in your book that\nactually when you started helping and\ndoing this work and\nnot just doing this work of trying to\nhelp the people who went there but\ntrying to change laws so that people\nnever end up there in the first place\nlike that approach is\nwhen you actually started to feel like\nyou were healing but when you're\nactually not just trying to heal\nyourself when you're trying to help\nothers that's when you really felt like\ncan you walk us through how hard it is\nto try and push forward a new bill or\nchange legislation in nine states like\ncan you walk us through like just how\ntechnically challenging that is and and\nwhat you come up against because I don't\nthink we always hear these announcements\nbut I don't think people know what goes\ninto that the\nevery day of my life I'm working I have\nRebecca mellinger who's my head of\nimpact at 11 11 media and we are\nconstantly speaking with Senators\ntraveling\ngoing and telling my story\num I've been back and forth to DC and\nthis is a multi-billion dollar industry\nso there's the schools yes yeah there's\nthousands of these schools there's\nhundreds of children that have died in\nthese places\num just the reports we have of abuse and\npeople there's no regulations and um\nit's just a lot having to go in there\nand\nand really push for this because people\ndon't understand they don't know what's\nhappening behind closed doors and since\nit's such a profitable industry\nit's also difficult because there's so\nmany people that are trying\nto fight us against it but when I\nactually go there and speak to them face\nto face and they hear the stories of\nmyself and the other survivors that I\nbring with me\nthat's when they understand what's\nhappening and when people know that\nthat's happening they can't just ignore\nit so everyone that we've been speaking\nto\nwhen they hear\nand we actually go there that's when it\nreally makes a difference and I think\nthat's why we've been so impactful\nwhat do you say to survivors or\nof the schools or even people that\nyou've been who've been through abuse\nlike what do you what do you\nwhat how can a friend\nhelp someone a friend in their life\nwho's gone through some sort of abuse\nlike how do you be a good friend to that\nbecause I can imagine that a lot of\npeople are listening right now going I\ndon't know what to say to my friends\nbecause I've never been through it I\ndon't know how to connect like what's\nhelpful I think it's just helpful to\nknow that they can\ntell you and that you'll be there for\nthem and not judge them and\nlet them know it's not their fault\nand\nI think being able to talk about it and\nhaving a safe space where\nyou can make them feel\nsupported and just know that you're\nthere for them and whatever they need\nand what do you think like really\ncreates that safe space because I feel\nfor so many people we think we're so\nclose to so many people we almost figure\nout that you're not there's only a few\npeople you can and then you you even\nnamed some of your closest friends\nwho've kind of been through the same\nstuff but like what really defines a\nsafe space for you\nyou know what is\nyou've talked about the relationship\nthat you have with car to your husband\nand the space you have right now but\nwhat has made it safer like what's\nactually created that\nenvironment differently now than you've\never had\nbecause I have people around me that I\ncan trust\nand\nit's definitely about knowing that when\nyou say something the people are not\ngonna go and repeat it so that's\nsomething that's\nI've just learned over the years even\nbefore I would test people in my life\nand tell them some fake rumor and then\njust see if it would end up in page six\nor in the media and that was a big test\nback in the day that I would do with\npeople and a lot of people failed that\ntest and\nnow I have I don't have anyone around me\nthat I would even have to worry about\nthat with and that's something that's\nreally important to me is trust because\ntrust and loyalty is priceless to me\nthat's such a great test yeah that's\nsuch a great test yeah if anyone's\nwondering if you have a real friend tell\nthem a fake rumor about yourself and see\nsee if it comes back to you exactly\nthat's like wow what was the fakest\nthing you ever said do you remember what\nwas like a rumor that the ones you push\nthe boundaries on I don't even remember\nmaybe just like oh there was like a guy\nor something like I have no idea just\nsomething stupid and then it would end\nup and I would be like oh man\nhow does it feel because at one point in\nyour book I think you know you talk\nabout this reputation that you developed\nin the media of like oh she sleeps\naround she's always with lots of men and\nthen it's like\nand you're like well that just wasn't\nthe case was there a part of you that\nit was just that was part of the\ncharacter and it worked or was there a\npart of you that just felt no that's not\ntrue I want people to know like how did\nyou process that I just knew that it\nwasn't true and in the media anytime I\nwas seen with someone at a party or\nwhatever whatever people would just\nassume that that was the case\nbut no one had any idea what I had went\nthrough that had made me really fearful\nlike even though I was known as the sex\nsymbol I didn't feel that way inside at\nall and I was so scared to let people in\nthat's why a lot of my relationships\ndidn't work because I\nwas like a teenager in a way where I\nonly would want to kiss and make out and\nthat was it and a lot of people wouldn't\nbe able\nput themselves to stay loyal because all\nI would do was kiss and they wanted more\nand then with the media they just\nassumed\nthat it was a lot more wilder than it\nreally was because\nin reality it was actually quite\ninnocent yeah did you just accept that\nyou just realized you couldn't change\nthat narrative and it was going to be\nwhat it was going to be or\nwas it something you didn't pay\nattention to\nI just\ntry just to not pay attention to things\nI just feel that\nthe media just always was constantly\ninventing rumors about me and I just\nfelt like a target a lot of the times\nbecause I felt that it was myself and\nthen a certain group of girls that they\nwould do this too\nwhat I find the most amazing thing is\neven in this interview so many times\nyou've said I'm in a better place now\nI'm in a and I know you're saying\nthere's still healing I know you're not\nsaying it's\nfigured out and it's perfect I don't I\ndon't think that's what you're saying uh\nbut what I'm hearing is like you know\nI've worked through things I've found a\ngood partner like I'm in a healthy space\nI think the hardest hardest thing after\ngoing through all of these things from\nan outside perspective is how do you\ntrust another man like right like it's\nlike you've had all these men who've\nabused you mistreated you\nyou've exploited you with the sex tape\nwho've used your image in ways without\neven ever consulting or any sort of\nconsent and complete you know so and\nit's like you've gone through all of\nthis how do you even think about dating\nsomeone letter and marrying someone for\nreal like because I feel like that\nrequires so much of yourself and\nalthough you're sitting in obviously you\nknow you're a new mom and like and I'm\nso happy but I can only imagine that\nI've had and I've had people by the way\nask me this question when I'm on tour\nI've just been so abused or misused or\nmistreated how do I love again how do I\ntrust again how have you continued to\nbelieve in real love and real trust and\nloyalty when you've seen the complete\nopposite your whole life it was\nextremely difficult just not being able\nto let anyone in for so long and\nwith Carter\nI wasn't even looking for Love at this\npoint this was back in 2019 I went home\nto The Hamptons for Thanksgiving and\nI saw Carter that day at Thanksgiving\nlunch and\nhe was just so sweet and kind of this\nmom and it's just so different than all\nthe other guys\nand he's Midwestern boy from a town of\n800 people\nand he's just\nlike this sweet nerdy like cute like\njust kind person who's\ndoesn't care about fame or any of this\nhe's just\nso the opposite of everyone that I've\never known and just has this incredible\nfamily values and it's just\nthis Angel like I really believe that\nmy grandmother and his dad are up in\nheaven and\nplanned for us to meet\nbecause right away it was just\nso different and this like electricity\nthat I had never felt and um\nit was literally like we were\ninseparable right away we moved in with\neach other and\nthat just then the world shut down in\nMarch so then we were really together\nbefore that I'd been on the road and\ntraveling over 250 days out of the year\nfor two decades so I never really had\ntime to get to know someone because I\nwas always on a plane\nso just having to be in one place and\nnot the world shutting down and it was\njust me and him together and\nI feel like times during covet or like\none year of that is like seven years of\nlike my normal life because\nmy life is usually so um\nbusy with everything I'm doing so\nall of that has just been like I don't\nknow it's just been so different than\nany other relationship where I just felt\nlike this is my destiny\nthat's beautiful congratulations I'm so\nso happy to hear that I can see you come\nto life and do like there's a there's a\nthere's a glow when you're talking about\ncar which is which is really beautiful\nto see but how how and when did you\nstart feeling comfortable with talking\nto him about what had gone on because\nI'm guessing\nthat was a safe space probably the first\ntime you'd felt it from someone you were\nclose to what was that process like\nbecause I can imagine it's also really\nscary to be like I found a really great\nthing now I'm going to share what my\nreal trauma is and challenges is and how\ndoes this affect like will that person\nstay will they run away these are like\nthe real things real people think about\nhow did you get how did you start\nsharing what you'd been through and\nwhen did you start feeling like you\nwanted to do that it was just I feel\nthat timing is everything and I had just\nfinished filming my documentary and when\nwe started dating so I was already going\nthrough this whole just\nlike emotional journey and then I showed\nhim my documentary and he was the first\nperson I had showed it to so he learned\nso much about me from that and then he\njust started asking me so many questions\nand\nsince I had already opened about it in\nthe film I felt I feel like that really\nprepared me for being able to speak\nabout it in real life to people do you\nremember an interesting question he\nasked you about your experience that you\nfelt like really brought you both closer\ntogether like was there something\nspecific that he asked about that when\nyou and what was your answer and one\nthat's something that brought you closer\ntogether than you were before that yeah\nI think it was just\nthe way he was he just actually listened\nand\nhe started crying during certain parts\nof our conversations he's\nfelt just so emotional for what I had\nwent through and just to see someone\ncares that much really just\nmade me trust him even more just to know\nthat he\ncared so much to even I don't know have\na conversation like that because I feel\nlike I just had never really had such a\ndeep conversation with someone before\num you you said that you don't cry about\na lot of This Much Anymore\nbut when did you really allow yourself\nto cry about it and feel it through when\nwas that opportunity you gave yourself\na lot of times I would cry just to just\njust uh\nafter going through things in life and\njust feeling so alone just coming home\nat the end of the night and having no\none to talk to about it\num\na lot of times in my life and especially\nafter\nmy documentary and writing my book just\nrereading all of that has just been um\nso emotional just to have to\nfeel it all yeah yeah you even spoke\nabout\nyou know\nhiding your pregnancy from your family\nand that was something that you and your\nyou know you and Carl are kind of kept\nto yourself and I I was when I when I\nfirst learned about that I was like that\nwas so interesting to me because it\nseems like in one sense your life since\nyou were young has been so public and so\nbroadcasted and so\noverly commented upon and been out there\nand then almost you're having this\nreally precious personal beautiful\nmoment\nand my interpretation was that it was a\nprotection of like no this needs to be\npersonal and private and sacred and and\nspecial is what is that what was going\nthrough your mind of why you wanted it\nto be so private like what how did that\ndecision come about where it's like no\nwell actually this is the one thing that\nis going to be that way\nI just felt that my life has been so\npublic for over two decades of being in\nthis whole industry and\nwith my baby I just felt that this was\nsomething that\nI didn't want all the outside opinions\nin the world or\nthe online trolls or anyone talking\nabout my son until he was here\non this in this point world and healthy\nand safe and\nI just I don't know I just feel like I\nwanted to keep that for me\nso no one knew about it until he was\nliterally a week old\nwow what's the pleasure in\npublic broadcast and what's the\nsweetness in private\nsacred personal experience talk to me\nabout the difference of the joy you get\nfrom like being in media and being on\nstage being in front and center and then\nwhat's the difference in how it feels\nwhen you get to have a special\nexperience like that I just want\neveryone to hear\nbecause I think those are two things We\ncrave and Chase\nfor me I love to make other people happy\nand\nfeel that energy and love and\nit's just\nan amazing feeling\num\nbut then to be with my baby boy and just\nhave him laying on my chest and looking\nup at me and Iota with those innocent\neyes and just\nthis little sweet precious angel who's\njust my world\nso\nthey're two different feelings like one\nis just\nexciting but then the other one is\nactually just\ntrue real love\nand I feel that for so long I always\nconsidered all of that type of attention\nlove but now I know what real love truly\nis\nwell yeah that that hit yeah that hit uh\nwhen everyone to take that away that\nwe often think of attention as love we\nthink of validation as love we think of\ncompliments as love\nbut love actually isn't any of that\nthose are just almost like fake currency\nor fake money and\nyeah real love is is what you're\nexperiencing now with your baby boy and\nwith cartoon with yourself at the\ndeepest level like do you feel that we\nhear these words like self-love and\nself-care all the time now they're all\nover the world but how do you define\nself-love now like do you feel like this\nis the first time in your life that\nyou've allowed yourself to love yourself\nor\nhave you loved yourself throughout all\nof this\nit's the first time I've\ngotten to know myself so therefore I\ncould really love myself\nbecause I feel that for so long I was\njust\nvery lost and\nI had been through so much that I was\njust living such this fast-paced life\nthat I never even had time to think\nabout anything and I think I purposely\nmade myself so busy that I wouldn't have\ntime to think about anything that that I\nhad went through in my life\num\nand now I've just I've gotten Getting to\nKnow Myself and\njust feel so many different feelings now\nI truly can love\nand know every part of me\nabsolutely absolutely how are you hoping\nto\nbe as a mother now like having you know\nyou've had an interesting relationship\nwith your own family which you talk\nabout in the book so much\nI think we all have complex\nrelationships with our own parents and\nfamily and we love them we appreciate\nthem and then they send decisions\nthere's a you know you talk about how\nlike you know at one point you wish that\nyour parents would just say sorry we did\nthat but then you've learned to\nunderstand that they may never get there\nhow does that how have you become okay\nwith that we'll get to the mothering\npart but how have you become okay with\nthat because I think for a lot of people\nthat's the hardest thing where it's like\nmy parents were wrong they made a\nmistake they should be sorry they should\nbe accountable but you're actually\nsaying I do fill all those ways but at\nthe same time\nI actually feel like that's okay that's\ntheir journey and that's their story and\nI'm okay with that how do you because\nthat's a real nuanced subtle place to be\nhow do you become okay with that\nfor me\njust knowing everything I know now I\nthink for when I was a teenager and I\nwas sent away I\nwas so just sad and I was angry but now\nbeing an adult and just\ndoing all my research and now finding\nout that these schools are completely\nmanipulative and\nthey lie to the families and have all\nthis false advertising and\nfake brochures and just it's\nsuch an evil industry and my parents had\nno idea and they were tricked and\nthat's something that I\nrealize now and um\nso I can't be angry at them because they\nwere just trying\nto do what they thought was right\nyeah that requires a lot of maturity\nthough like that requires a lot of\nlooking at the context\nbecause I find like when you don't have\nthat context it's so easy to be in\nconflict with someone but when you\nactually create that context and you\nzoom out and you go wow like this is a\nbig industry so many people have been\nbrainwashed so many people have been\nmarketed to and so many people have been\nmade to believe that this is the best\nthing for their kids to the point that\nyou're on the phone and they're still\nsaying no no no just work the program\nand\nhow does that affect how you want to be\na mother because I can imagine\nthat\nit makes you want to be really\nprotective and but at the same time like\nyou've also lived a life where you know\nthe benefits of exploring like you you\ntalk about the book multiple times of\nlike you're happy you partied you're\nhappy you went out like you're not\nyou're not upset with that and then it's\nlike how do you how do you think about\nwe're becoming a mother and how you plan\non raising a child like how do you think\nabout\nprotecting versus also exploring in\ncuriosity and how that how you help a\nchild with all those crazy decisions we\nall have to make now that I'm a parent I\ncan completely understand just\nif I had a daughter and she was sneaking\nout in the middle of the night in New\nYork City and\nI had no idea where she was I would be\nso terrified so I can completely\nunderstand just\nhow my parents were just\nscared because they were just trying to\nprotect me\nand I think that's\na hard part because you just want to\nprotect your children so much and\nI think when you're so strict it just\nmakes them want to rebel\nso\nI don't know I think I'm definitely\ngoing to be strict I'd hope that my\nlittle Phoenix does not Rebel but at\nleast I'll be more prepared because\nof everything that I've went through\nand also I won't be able to be tricked\nwithout sneaking out or any of that\nbecause I know everything\nI'm hoping that he will just feel so\nsafe that he'll be able to tell me\nanything or he won't want to hide\nanything because\nI think that's when\nkids will sneak out or do things or lie\nbecause they feel like they can't talk\nto you yeah\nI think that's what it is that that\nreally resonated for me every kid in the\nworld is going to make bad mistakes and\nbad choices and bad decisions I mean\nit's I don't know anyone who hasn't but\nif you feel safe enough and comfortable\nenough to tell your parents and you\ndon't feel like you have to hide from\nthem then you can actually solve stuff\nwith them and you don't feel judged by\nthem that that makes the world of a\ndifference I yeah it's it's funny what\nyou said there like you're like he's\nnever gonna be able to get away with\nanything because you're you're the\nyou're the uh ultimate he is your son so\nyeah you never know like he might be\nhe's gonna be super smart as well and\nknow exactly how to play the game\nexactly you you said in your you said in\nyour documentary that you don't believe\nyou will be truly happily happy until\nyou have one billion dollars uh how's\nthat goal changed how is that metric\nchanged I think before I\nhad such a focus on\nmoney because I really saw that as\nfreedom because that was something I\nsaid to myself when I get out of here\nI'm going to become so successful make\nso much money that no one will be able\nto control me or tell me what to do\nbut now I've just become so successful\nin everything I've created with my media\ncompany and all of that and I'm so proud\nbut that's not my main focus I care more\nabout babies and billions\nbabies yes yeah I can have both of us I\nlove that one of the things that I\nreally struck me in your book and I'm\nhappy to hear that shift in uh gold\nthat's beautiful I think one of the\nthings that shifted you said this song\nyou talked about how you got robbed of\ntime and then you said the only way you\ngot through and I thought this was so\ntrue and so powerful and that's what I\nwant to share with everyone you said the\nonly way you got through the school\nspecifically you're talking about the\nschool at that time but assuming pretty\nmuch everything in your teens that you\nwent through in your 20s you said I\ncreated a future world a future self and\na future life without boundaries and\nthat's how you survived can you walk us\nthrough what that means like how were\nyou in this almost in prison like it\nsounds that way the way you described it\nbut creating a future world a future\nself and a future life what does that\nlook like when you're in\nprison chaos like pain how are you doing\nthat\nI was just so\njust\nsad and depressed and it was just so\nhorrible of what I was going through\nevery single day that I just\nstarted just creating in my mind of this\nwhole life that I wanted and what I\nwanted to do and I got out of there and\njust building this kind of almost\nFantasy Life of who I could be\nand um I really do believe in\nmanifestation and really manifesting who\nyou can become because I really believed\nthat I did that and it all started from\njust so much pain and then wanting to\nturn it into something positive how much\nof it happened the way you imagined it\nversus how much of it has actually been\nbetter than you imagined or less than\nbecause\nyeah I'd love to know\nI\nI always had Big Dreams but I had no\nidea it would ever be on this level\nand\nit was just um\nit's been such a journey just everything\nthat I've went through like\nwhen I was a little girl I wanted to be\na veterinarian and then\nmoved to New York and just saw just this\nwhole other world of business and\neverything and\nI think that\njust sitting there and having time just\nto really think about everything and\nI always dreamed of having one perfume\nand now I'm about to release my 30th and\nit's just that I feel like everything\nI've really put my mind to is came true\nand that was just your focus so when\nyou're in that school facility\nand you're going through all of this\nyour mind's just there is is that\nliterally you just sit there and\nvisualize it it was like an escape\ndefinitely this\notherwise it would have just been so\nhard to go through if I didn't have\ndreams\nof what I wanted to do\nand would you say that was the same\ntechnique with one of the things that\nhit me was like you know you felt good\nthings happening in a role before and\nthen you know\nspecifically in the example when you're\ntalking about simple life comes out it's\ngoing to come out it's you're excited\nabout it the sex tape comes out straight\nafter all of a sudden everyone's you\nknow tearing you apart taking you down\nit's\nthe worst things happen where you know\nit's put up in a grocery store sign you\nknow there's you talk about all of this\nin the book and I'm thinking you're just\nfeeling like you've got through the\ntough time your life's on track and then\nall of a sudden it's like this something\ngoes back in your face again I'm like\nhow did you just I I constantly when I\nwas reading the book I was saying how do\nyou get out from this right like was it\nagain the same visualization and\nmanifestation that helps you break\nthrough that or what helps you overcome\nand reframe that because I think that\nwould just knock people out forever\nuh that was one of the most painful\nexperiences to go through\njust tulip\nbeen with someone and really loved and\ntrusted them and\nsomething that was one night of your\nlife where you never thought anyone\nwould see it and then the whole world is\nwatching it and\njudging and just being so cruel and it\nwas just\nmortifying and I didn't leave my house\nfor like\nmonths and I didn't want to see anyone I\ncanceled the Press tour for the simple\nlife I\njust was it was so just painful to go\nthrough that and\njust to have the whole world just\nknowing that everyone was watching it\nand\nit just felt like he took away something\nfrom me because I\nhad always looked up to these amazing\nwomen and like Princess Diana and I just\nfelt that because of what he did to me\nthe whole world would\nalways assumed that I was something that\nI wasn't just based upon one night with\nsomeone who I really trusted\nwhat's the first step you took outside\nyour house\nwhat gave you the courage to do it and\nhow did you realize I'm not gonna let\nthat person Define my narrative\ndefinitely took a while for me to\nfeel\nbrave enough to go out there\nand\nmy first thing that I did was actually\nSaturday Night Live\nwith Jimmy Fallon and\nI feel like I took control of the\nnarrative there just with that script\nwith how they wrote it I thought it was\njust really yeah you're sharing the book\nreally well just a funny way to\nI don't know how to describe it but I\njust felt like I was taking control of\nmy narrative in that way yeah when I\nwhen I read your story and when I listen\nto him like here's someone who has just\nnever backed down like never given up\nand I think this book\nwhich I encourage everyone is listening\nto read I really do because I think when\nwe see things in the news they're very\ndifferent to when you see it from the\nViewpoint of the person going through it\nyeah and\nI just want everyone to think about for\na second just how you feel when your\nfriends think something differently than\nthe truth or how you feel when your\nparents or maybe you live in a bigger\ncommunity and they all think something\nof you that wasn't true or they see\nsomething about you and they react to it\ndifferently\nand you know inside of you how you feel\nwhen your narrative is taken away from\nyou and it's stripped away from you and\nanother narrative is placed on you I\nthink everyone in the world knows what\nthat feels like on some scale in some\nlevel\nand\nI hope that it allows us to\nsee that Nuance in everyone else it's\nnot saying that anyone's perfect or\nanyone's amazing it's saying that can we\njust accept that\nthere are two sides to every story that\nthere are there's countless Hidden\nTruths that we never discovered that\nwe're not aware of\nand that there's Nuance to everything\nthere's subtleties to everything and\nthat everything isn't How It's Made to\nseem in the way it's presented and if we\ncould just give people the benefit of\nthe doubt we'll probably give ourselves\nthe benefit of the doubt as well\ndefinitely don't judge a book by its\ncover yeah and and uh we all do that all\nthe time\num Paris it has been such a joy talking\nto you today because I really appreciate\nyour trust I know you haven't done a lot\nof interviews and you haven't I I really\nappreciate and value your trust and your\nteam's trust in me and having this\nconversation with me today it really\nmeans a lot to me having read your book\nto actually get to sit with you and we\nend every episode with a final five\nthese are five questions that have to be\nanswered in one word to one sentence\nmaximum\nso show answers you're you're very good\nat taglines and all the rest of it so\nthis should be easy for you but uh Paris\nHilton these are your final five\nquestion number one is what is the best\nadvice you've ever heard or received\nyou only live once so make the most of\nit okay and what's the West second\nquestion what's the worst advice you've\never had or received the worst advice\nthat I've ever seen\nis when people say to care so much about\nthe opinions of others I feel that\nin my life that\nI used to just care so much about what\nothers think and I think it's important\nto care only about people in your life\nthat love and care about you think and\nnot others who are not good people\namazing\nquestion number three how would you\ndefine your current purpose\nmy current purpose is\nto make the world a safer place for\nchildren\noh that's a beautiful purpose thank you\nfor doing that like I'm I feel so\ngrateful that that's your purpose I\nthink that's such a need in the world\nright now and\nthe legislations and the bills and you\nknow it's that's the only way it's\nreally going to happen to\nto make sure that it doesn't happen in\nthe first place in a proactive way so\nthat's really beautiful thank you if you\nhad a message or an intention or a\nsomething you would say to the people\nthat have hurt you\nand made you feel like you were the one\nwho had to be shamed and embarrassed\nwhat would you say to them\nyou should be ashamed of what you've\ndone\nand I hope that\nyou read this book and\nyou never do it again\nthank you\nuh great answer again uh I think it's so\ninteresting like to really\nto really feel remorseful and to really\nfeel\nsorry means to really try your best to\nlive through the pain you cause someone\nI don't think you can you can never\nreally take you can never take back what\nyou did and you can never to be honest\nyou're sorry and your remorse can never\nreally\nrepay the other person and I'm guessing\nyou've had to do all this work without\nany apologies or remorse right or has\nthere ever been any apology or remorse\nfrom any of these people or never\num\nno\nnever\num\nI think that's the uh that's probably\none of the most incredible lessons from\nthis book is that there's a famous quote\nthat says we should learn to accept\napologies that we've never received and\nit seems like that's what your work is\ndoing that you've learned to accept\napologies that actually never came your\nway and I love what you said about\npeople reading the book to really\nunderstand how much they can\npotentially wreck and ruin someone's\nlife especially a young person\nuh Fifth and final question you'll like\nthis one\nif you could create one law in the world\nthat everyone had to follow what would\nit be\nmy law would be that everyone has to do\none kind thing every single day\nbeautiful I feel that the more things\nthat people do the better place the\nworld will be I love that Paris thank\nyou for being here thank you for writing\nthis book I want to ask you a question\nis there anything that\nanything that's on your heart and mind\nthat I haven't asked you about that\nyou've really wanted to share that I\nwant to open it up give you that space\nis there anything you'd like to share\nanything I haven't asked you that you\nfeel is really\nfront of mind or front of heart for you\nit doesn't matter I can't think of\nanything right that's good that's a good\nthing that makes me happy that makes me\nhappy I just I just wanted to honor it\nbecause I you know I I really feel\nyou've been so giving and kind and\ngenerous uh through your story and I\nwant everyone out there who's listening\nand watching to go and grab a copy of\nthe book Paris the Memoir uh give it to\na friend who's gone through something or\nyou might know they've gone from through\nsomething and they're not sure how to\nprocess it and\nthey're thinking about it they're\nstruggling with it I think that this\nbook is going to open up some incredible\nconversations about abuse about ADHD\nabout connection to our families and\nparents about rediscovering ourselves\nand I hope it starts that conversation\nfor you and your friends uh Paris thank\nyou again thank you thank you I'm so\nhappy I came on this awesome thank you\nyou're very sweet thank you so much I\nappreciate it if you love this episode\nyou'll really enjoy my episode with\nSelena Gomez on befriending your inner\ncritic and how to speak to yourself with\nmore compassion"
