    "transcript": "you know I think most people think Jay\neveryone else is going to die I'll get\naround to being happy I'll get around to\nmy dreams and then it's another day and\nanother day and they keep it in the\ndistance you only understand the power\nof one day when you're threatened with\nnever having another one the\nbest-selling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nthis quote by Thomas Edison said when\nyou feel you've exhausted all options\nremember this you haven't I love that\nthat's the power of one more or one more\nand so I have lived this book in my life\nlike I have lived this mindset and it\nhas changed my life because I've always\nbeen just one step away one habit away\none mindset away from this amazing life\nthat I'm grateful and blessed to live\nwell that's the truth right you're right\nand I think the great lie in life is\nthat you know some scriptures say well\nwhere there's no vision that people will\nperish whatever your scriptures are if\nyou really do you have no vision if you\nask the average person you want to be\nhappy or sad what's your vision they'd\nsay I want to be happy you want to be\nrich or poor most people say I'd like to\nbe rich do you want to contribute or\nmake no difference in the world I want\nto contribute do you want beautiful\nmemories or no memories I want memories\nso there's a vision our issue is depth\nperception\nwe think it's further away than it is\nand because we think it's so far away\nJay we create patterns and behaviors in\nour life that perpetually keep it there\noh and that's what we do in our life but\nwhat if that's the great lie of life and\nwhat if the truth is that you're one\nrelationship away one meeting away one\nconversation one podcast one interview\none new thought one new emotion one new\ntactic or strategy away from completely\nchanging the trajectory of your life and\neveryone that you and I know that we\nboth worked with that were blessed to\nwork with in our lives the truth is it\nwas one decision one meeting one extra\nrep one more phone call one thing they\ndid that changed their trajectory then\nthe question then becomes how do I do it\nand so the strategies are in the book\nbut conceptually that's a hundred\npercent how you change your life yeah\nand you you're so right I I was thinking\nabout this this morning last year I had\na double hernia surgery on the front\nlike so I could then walk for about a\nmonth and when I say I couldn't walk I\nmean like I literally couldn't oh my\ngosh it was like I was like I felt like\nI was teaching myself to walk again like\nthat's how it felt it's really\ninteresting what you just said about how\nwe perpetually push it far away I would\nwake up every morning and my mind or my\ninitial mindset was like it will be gone\ntoday yeah it must have gone today like\ntoday it will be fully healed I'll be\nfine today and I would wake up and I\nwouldn't be\nand I would feel like healing was so far\naway yes it would be like 80 away that I\nwas missing out on the one percent\nchange since yesterday you got it since\nyesterday I made one percent change I\nwas I wasn't feeling the same pain in my\nnerves I was able to be flexible by one\npercent more yes and I was missing out\non all of that because I was so obsessed\nwith how far I was that's the journey\nand what happens is when you live with\nan expectation that these one More's\nexist the reticular activating system in\nyour mind filters them into your\nawareness I call it the Matrix in the\nsecond chapter of the book when you wake\nup believing hey I'm one decision away\nI'm one meeting away one relationship\naway that's not hokey your mind begins\nto filter the people places and things\ninto your awareness you develop\nsomething called sensory acuity you hear\nconversations you weren't hearing we've\nall had that experience where we're on\nan airplane I can't stop hearing these\npeople over here or you walk in a loud\nroom but you can hear your own name\nauditorily over all the other names the\nroom that's because it's important to\nyou and it matters you see things and so\nwhen something becomes important to you\nand you believe it to be true the RAS\ngoes to proving it for you and when I\nlearned this ironically I talk about in\nthe book is my father was an alcoholic\nand had tried to get sober many many\ntimes and I'll never forget it Jay we\nwere driving to a baseball game of mine\nmy dad started crying I'd never seen my\ndad cry before\nand he pulls the car over and he still\nisn't looking at me but he's crying and\nhe says Eddie and then he turns to me\nand he goes\nI'm gonna try to get sober and I'll\nnever forget this brother he goes\none more time\nwow and I said really Daddy he goes I'm\ngoing to give it one more try and I said\nto him I said why would this be any\ndifferent this time\nand he said never said this to me before\nhe goes because I I love you\nand you deserve it father you can be\nproud of and you can't be proud of me\nright now\nand I think every great thing we do in\nlife is one away but it's also born from\nlove\nto talk about your book when you love\npeople or you love something so deeply\nif that love is greater than what the\nobstacles might be now you got a shot to\ndo it then my dad gets sober he comes\nhome from rehab I say Daddy are you\nnever gonna drink again\nand he said I can't promise you that I\ncan promise you I'm not going to drink\nfor one more day at a time wow and he\nlasted the rest of his life stacking\nthose one more days up so I know the\npower of one more the other thing I also\nknow humans can change I watched my hero\ndo it I watched my dad live my first 15\nyears\nso I'm in a lot of fights wow a lot of\nlying a lot of difficult times and then\nI saw this man transform and in life\nwe're most qualified to help the person\nwe used to be and what we think in life\nand I hope everybody gets this we think\nthe things we're most ashamed of\nembarrassed by our divorce our\nbankruptcy or maybe we've just always\nbeen average and ordinary this\ndisqualifies me from being successful\nand happy what if that's not true what\nif the hardest things of your life are\nthe very things that qualify you I'll\ngive you an example you know my dad got\nsober somebody helped him\nmy dad was going to take his life or\nlose his family and I didn't know who it\nwas until months ago some precious human\nbeing whom I didn't know in my dad's\nDarkest Hour of his life Jay said I'll\nhelp you I'll help you little to that\nperson no I'd be his son and I'd help\nmillions of people and I'd be on Jay\nShetty show and we both help millions of\npeople and the more ironic thing that\nthis person helped my dad is what\nqualified them to help my dad\nthey were a drunk they were an alcoholic\nthey at one time were a drug addict they\nat one time were lying and stealing and\nliving in the shadows the very thing\nthat person probably figured that\ndisqualifies me from having a successful\nlife was the one thing that did qualify\nthem to help my dad so if you're\nlistening to this and you've had\nsomething you're ashamed of or a failure\nor a setback you're most qualified to\nhelp the people you used to be yeah and\nthat person that alcoholism they\nsuffered with their drug addiction\nhelped my dad live those one more days\nforever uh that that is the best\nexplanation I've heard of how pain turns\ninto purpose right the thing that\nbrought you down that broke you down\nthat made you feel like you were losing\neverything that's right gave you back\neverything when you used that to serve\nthe people that were struggling with it\nand then there's then there's a purpose\nand you know if you can survive the\ntemporary pain in your life and all pain\nis temporary I watched my father pass\naway last year he was in tremendous pain\neven our bodies are determined only our\nsouls are permanent if you can survive\nthe temporary on the other side of\ntemporary pain you meet another version\nof yourself another insight about\nyourself and that's why it's so\nimportant to grow as a person because\nthe more we grow and become a new person\nwe can help those that used to be like\nus that's why you and I are so addicted\nto growing and learning and we're\ncurious because if you used to be a\nbroken person and you no longer are\nquite as broken you can help broken\npeople if you used to be broke\nfinancially and you no longer are you\ncan help people whatever you do for a\nliving at one time you didn't know about\nit and now you do you can help those who\nneed to know about it and so you're\nimmensely qualified if you understand\nthe power of doing one more oh I love it\nI love it tell me about so let's say and\nyou've probably come up against this all\nthe time a lot of the people say okay\nI'm gonna practice that I'm With You Ed\nI love you and Jay I'm listening and I\ngo yes I'm going to practice the power\nof one more\nnow what I find and this is why you're\nso great at teaching this because you're\nnot teaching it as a gimmick a glitch\nyou're like a little a little\naffirmation this is like real it makes\nsense like it works\npeople get so tied to the result that\nwhen they try it the next day and the\nsales meeting doesn't go their way or\nthe pitch doesn't go their way they go\nah it doesn't work it doesn't work why\ndidn't it work and how should we respond\nwhen we fail or get rejected well it\ndidn't work because you're so attached\nto the outcome I coach a lot of athletes\nI know you do as well and one of the\nthings that's a really nuanced thing in\nlife it's great to have goals you should\nhave goals I want to do this or that but\nin the moment of execution you have to\nseparate from outcome in the moment that\nyou're executing and just be present and\nexist I talk about this in the book\nhere's what I would say if you're going\nto win long term\n95 of people have a operating system in\ntheir mind where they operate out of\nhistory and memory\nI like that and about five percent of\nhumans operate out of vision and\nImagination so the reason we're so much\nhappier I believe when we're children is\nwe have no history in memory so we\noperate of imagination and dreams and\nvision but at some age some people it's\nfive years old some it's eight some it's\n18 some it's 28. they create a history\nand that history then becomes the\noperating system so even if they take on\na new Behavior or tactic they're\noperating out of a pattern of thought\nand belief that's historic and memory\nbased and so the number one thing I\nwould say is begin to operate out of\nyour imagination again out of your\nvision again create from that place if\nyou create from that place now you're\nnot tied to the result in that moment\nyou're giving yourself space to imagine\nand create something new in your life\nthat I never heard that in that language\nman that is so powerful I you're so\nright about his kids that we don't have\nany memory or history so we don't have\nany blocks we don't have any limits and\nbegin to listen to the people around you\npeople say hey you're the product of who\nyou're hanging around how do I know if\nthey serve me or not here's a way that\none way to just deduce this because they\ncould be beautiful people who care about\nyou and they might even support you but\nwhen you're with them what are you ever\nhave those friends you're with them\nyou're like you remember when you\nremember you remember you remember\nremember that party remember that thing\nand if your friends are constantly\nbringing you to the filtration system of\nmemory and history all the time think\nthis through how often are those friends\nsaying hey what are you working on now\nwhere are you going what's your vision\nwhat do you want to create and maybe\nthat sounds hokey but you and I have\nsome of the some of our both our friends\nhave the most amazing histories and you\ncan't get them to talk about them no you\nhave to work because what are they still\ndoing yeah they're talking about now and\nwhere they're going their Viewpoint in\ntheir life is being present and having a\nvision for the future yeah a formula for\nmisery a formula for lack of creativity\nlack of productivity is constantly being\nhistory and memory even if it's good it\ndoesn't serve us and for most of us it's\nnot good and we keep living from it or\ntrying to move away from it create a new\nfuture don't move away from the past\ncreate a brilliant imaginative curious\nvibrant vision for your life oh I love\nthat yeah we're always trying to create\nthe same past yes as opposed to a new\nfuture and I find that what's really\ninteresting about that oldest study\nshowed that Nostalgia makes us believe\nthat the past was more phenomenal than\nit actually was if you remember that\nparty you went to a college it's better\nin your memory than it actually was if\nyou actually could have gone back and\nremembered how you felt hungover and\nwhat you broke a bone or whatever\nhappened but now in your memory it's\nbeautiful beautiful right so our memory\nalso is slightly warped of the past no\nquestion you can make things feel much\nbetter or much worse sometimes no\nquestion but what's what's really coming\nout for me right now is this idea that\nit's it's something you said a couple of\nmoments ago and and it sparked a thought\nfor me I remembered a story that Vanessa\nBryan told about Kobe Bryant after he\npassed away\nI was fortunate enough to interview him\naround three months before it before his\ntragic passing\nand she told this story and she said\nthat Kobe would play through every\ninjury he would play through every pain\nhe had played through everything even in\nthe doctors and his coaches would say\nstop playing\nand she asked him she said once why he\nstill plays right again going back to\nour curiosity not assuming you know your\npartner\nshe asked him why do you still play and\nthis is just her and him there's no\ncameras there's no she's telling this\nstory but at the time it was just them\ntoo\nhe said it's because there's someone\nwho's paid for a ticket today they saved\nup and this is the only time they're\never going to be able to come maybe a\nson's maybe a dad's brought his kid\nmaybe someone's come to the game they're\na lifelong fan and they came today and\ntoday is the only day they're gonna get\nto see me and if I say I'm injured yes\nthey won't get to see me so I'm gonna\nplay so that that person one person gets\nto see me play and then he goes and wins\nyes and it's like that's love that's\nright that's what you were saying that\nlove for something is in the present\nmoment also right love is not just for\nthe past and it's funny how important\none day has been when my dad got sick my\ndad got cancer when he first got sick he\ngoes hey my dad was a dude he goes look\nI'll fight this one time\nokay I'll do your little chemo and your\nsurgery but I'm not gonna pour poison\ninto my body I'm not gonna lose my hair\nI'm not going to deteriorate I'll give\nthis thing a shot once if it doesn't\nwork I'm out\nthat led to eight years of him fighting\nit wow chemo radiation proton therapy\nsurgery surgery chemo experimental chemo\nand he did lose his hair and he was in\npain and I'd say to my dad I say Dad\nyou're suffering so much you said you\nwouldn't suffer he said no Eddie I'm in\npain but I'm not suffering\nI I choose not to suffer and I'm not\nsuffering because I get to see my\ngrandkids again and I said and I just\nsaid dad why are you doing this and he\nsaid you only understand the power\nof one day when you're threatened with\nnever having another one\nI'll do anything for one more day get to\nbe with you one more time\ngive your mom a kiss one more time maybe\nI'll see one of my granddaughters get\nmarried\nand he goes I'll do anything for one\nmore day the beautiful thing is I was\nactually with Kobe a week before he\npassed away\nwe're in the same gym our daughters\nplayed volleyball\nand I ironically that day I watched Kobe\nwalk out of the gym there's only a\ncouple dads left it was late at night he\nstayed and I stayed and he had his\nyoungest daughter in his arm and he was\nrubbing his other daughter's back and I\nremember taking note of it because I was\nwith Bella at the other end of the gym\nand I remember thinking I don't hug\nBella enough\nI need to hug no joke bro it's in the\nbook I went I gotta hug Bella one more\ntime every day not just once a day plus\none more time every day my daughter's\ngonna get extra hugs because Kobe does\nthat\nwhat if I could have said to Kobe when\nhe got in his car Kobe\nI have one more week\never matters to you make it right call\nyour dad make it right call your mom\ncall your family you what if the day\nbefore you could have said Colby\none day left\nand my dad same thing I was with my dad\nwhen he had one day left I was with my\ndad when he had one hour left I was with\nmy dad when he had one breath left and\nthen when we begin to think of our life\nthat way the power of right now and\nhaving one more moment and one more\nminute is so beautiful it's so blessed\nit's so big it's so amazing why would we\nspend that minute in history why would\nwe spend that minute in the past when we\ncould be fully present in creating a\nfuture and so you know I think most\npeople think Jay everyone else is gonna\ndie\nI think they just they just I'm never\nI'm not gonna die or they go I'll get\naround to being happy I'll get around to\nmaking my masterpiece of my life I'll\nget around to my dreams I'm gonna get\naround to fixing this relationship\nthat's broken I'm gonna get around to\nfeeling those emotions and then it's\nanother day and another day and they\nkeep it in the distance until there are\nno more days and I don't care if you're\n18 years old listening to this 28 or 48.\nwe don't know if we have one more day\nor 100 more days or a thousand more days\nbut we know this there'll eventually be\na time where we don't have any more days\nand so why would we spend the ones that\nare coming looking at the past and so my\ndad really taught me those lessons and\nwatching him passed away and that's why\nI have so I have a whole thing in there\nof how to get 21 days a week run many\ndays I get 21 days a week we still\nmeasure time bro like it's 1900. think\nabout 1900 if I want to get you a note\nI'd have to write a letter out stick it\non the back of a horse's butt in 1850 30\ndays later you get it that was a 24-hour\nday now I can text you in two seconds we\nmeasure time the same way so I teach you\nhow to change your time so that you can\nmake that day it's maximum Bliss it's\nmaximum productivity what's what's one\nmore that you're working on right now\nright now I'm actually it's an\ninteresting season of my life I have a\nTV show that you know that I did with\nNBC that's called change that I think is\nyou know has a chance of getting picked\nup but my one more that I'm working on\nright now for me and my life is my peace\nand so there's this guy Jay Shetty\nthat's a friend of mine that uh\nintroduced me and my family to\nmeditation\nand I'm giving myself the gift of I\ndon't just do it in the morning now I've\ngiven myself the gift of one more time\nevery single day of just emptying my\nmind and trying to be fully present and\nit's been worked for me I've got that\nbusy type of a mind but um I have found\nthat my peace\nin my life most of us Jay have all these\ngoals of things we want to do and\nthey're wonderful and I believe in doing\nthat I think standards are more\nimportant than goals because and I teach\nyou in this the book how to set the\nstandards that'll get those goals but we\nreally don't but we really don't want\nthe jet we don't want the hit song we\ndon't want the amazing relationship we\ndon't want the million dollars we don't\nwant the we want how we think it'll make\nus feel and what if we begin to become\nmore intentional and outcome oriented\nabout the things we feel in our life and\nit took me a while but now that I'm\nolder when I feel strong when I feel\nBlissful when I feel peaceful is when I\nproduce the physical things that I want\nnot the other way around and so my one\nmores are more emotional Focus most of\nus then I'll come up for air here have\nan emotional home there's three or four\nor five emotions we experience on a\nregular basis I write about it in the\nbook and no matter what happens we find\na way even if they don't serve us to get\nthose emotions if your emotional home is\nfear anxiety worry depression anger you\nfind a way every week to get that\nemotion but what if that emotional home\ncould become Bliss and peace and joy and\ncreativity and ecstasy and so I'm\nworking on one more beautiful emotion\nfor my emotional moment for me it's\npeace I love that I love that answer man\nit's good to hear about what you've been\nsaying like we're not living in the past\nand you're like in the present but to\nhave you answer that question that peace\nis your presence like that's what you're\nlooking for right that's that's the\npresent and it shows that you're using\nthis like it works you're doing it time\nand time again and I love what you said\nit moves from the physical things into\nthe subtle into the emotional into the\nthe deeper I I think that's so profound\nwhat was that one more that if you\ndidn't do it you wouldn't be here today\nwhat was what was one of those ones that\nlike ah like that was the one that\nconvinced me apart from obviously a\nfather that you were like ah if I didn't\ndo that I wouldn't be at my let today I\nwouldn't be maxed out life my first the\nfirst business I built was a financial\nbusiness and I had some success J like a\nlot of people do in life and then it\nwent backwards and sometimes you get up\nthe flagpole just a little bit and you\ncome back down that's an emotional\ndifficulty could be a relationship that\nwas good that's gone or maybe it saves\nsome money it's gone maybe you lost a\nbunch of weight and got fit and you\ngained it back for me it was my business\nand I called my dad who's a pretty Wise\nGuy now that he was sober and uh because\nI could tell you man I'd do one more rep\nin the gym I haven't done 10 reps on a\nbench press in 30 years I've done 10\nplus one more a lot though I haven't\ndone 45 minutes on a treadmill but I've\ndone 45 plus one more minute 10 contacts\na day never ten plus one more but the\nbiggest one more was actually something\nelse I called my dad and I said hey Dad\nuh it's not gone the business is\ncrashing and I'm running out of money\nour power was turned off our water was\nturned off Jay we had to take my wife\nevery morning we'd lost our house we're\nliving in an apartment now then the\nwater got turned off you can't cook you\ncan't bathe there was a apartment\nbuilding we had an outdoor shower at the\nswimming pool\nand I'd have to wear newlyweds and I'd\nhave to get up every morning walk down\nthere and I'd hold a towel up while my\nwife took her shower every day outdoors\nand brush your teeth and then she'd\nswitch and hold the towel up for me and\nI'd walk back up to the apartment and I\nwas so emasculated so ashamed so\nembarrassed and\nI was living a nightmare\nselling a dream to everybody every day\nwe can do this a lot of entrepreneurs or\npeople can relate in their life and\nanyway I called my dad that night and I\nsaid I I think I need to pack it in I\nneed to go get a job and just I'm this\nsuccess thing is not\nit's not for people like us and my dad\ngoes Eddie you don't have to decide\nyou're never gonna quit\nhe goes just don't quit for one more day\nsee how you feel tomorrow I go Dad he\ngoes just just don't do it for one more\nday and I got the next day and I still\nwanted to quit but not quite as much and\nthen I went one more day and one more\nday and I found myself about 30 days\nlater I didn't want to quit anymore and\nthank God the one more I did was I went\none more day without quitting and I'm so\ngrateful I didn't quit on my dream oh Ed\nwow that is like oh my gosh man like you\njust everything you're just dropping\nright now I'm just like I hope everyone\nis taking notes if you haven't been\ntaking notes of when you take a\nscreenshot right now of where we're at\nright now because that's what you're\ngonna have to listen to again so take a\nscreenshot share it tell everyone to go\nto this segment listen to that over\nagain because I think what I'm hearing\nyou know is that this is this is a\nlifestyle like this is a mindset it's a\nlifestyle it's a everyday every moment\nway to live this isn't just in the big\nbusiness you're building this is me\ntelling my wife I love her one more time\nthis is me making sure I mess message my\nmom one more time it's me making sure\nthat when I'm sitting here with you I'm\nalways gonna have to ask you one more\nquestion you keep giving so much no but\nyou keep giving well that's what you\njust said it would never end I think of\npeople feel like they tried a lot and\nthen they start building up resentment\nand like pain and bitterness towards\nthat path\nand a lot of people also that I know\nthey just think that there are some\npeople who are meant to be I agree with\nthis and then there are some people that\nare not meant to be that's correct and\nthey carry that with them and it comes\nfrom this like oh yeah you were meant to\nbe this so that person was meant to have\nit but for me this is where and I heard\nthat kind of come up and what you were\nsaying to your dad like it doesn't\nhappen to people like us how does this\nrule how does this principle apply to\nsomeone who's in there another best\nquestion ever because I grew up with no\nwe have alcoholic dad or a drug addict\nor maybe you come from divorce or maybe\nyour parents just didn't love you enough\nwhatever it was didn't tell you they\nloved you enough\nit's hard to have self-confidence I was\na little guy I got bullied in school and\nI just and even at this age now bro I I\nif I'm being completely honest\nself-confidence we all teach that it's\nyou know part of keeping the promises\nyou make to yourself what if you raise\nthe standard a little higher you keep\nthe promises you make to yourself plus\none more because for me self-confidence\ndidn't come easy I think in life\nultimately you're going to get what you\nbelieve you deserve and if you're wound\nup wired like me I didn't think I\ndeserved a lot\nI didn't even have a dad who could stop\ndrinking right I wasn't six foot four\nI don't have an incredibly high IQ\nthere's nothing really that impressive\nabout me nor were people very impressed\nwith me most of my life\nso that was my pattern that was my\nhistory that was my memory and so the\nonly I could wait around until I\ndeveloped tremendous self-confidence or\nI could begin to do things\nevery day that we're small they're not\nmajor and over time when I did those one\nmore calls that one more meeting that\none more book I read that one more\npodcast not only am I doing more reps so\nthe likelihood of me being successful is\nbigger but I started to convince myself\nI'm doing things other people aren't\nwilling to do maybe I deserve things\nother people aren't going to get and\nslowly but surely I started to convince\nmyself I did deserve it based on what I\nwas doing not necessarily the caliber of\nmy talent yeah yeah that was the\ndifference yeah you you just there's a\nthought I've been having recently and\nit's that\nComfort creates self-care\nbut discomfort creates self-respect\nright like it's what you're saying that\nthe one more discomfort every day that's\nwhere self-respect comes from yes you\ndon't great term yeah you don't you\ndon't start to trust yourself or build\nself-esteem or believe in yourself\nbecause you just say it to yourself it's\ncoming what you just said you gotta then\ntake one more meeting and see what you\nlearn you go out there and take one more\nrisk one more discomfort and I guarantee\nyou if you have a successful or happy\nfriend whichever how you determine that\nand you ask them this they tell you that\nwe're right yeah they would tell you\ngosh that's right it's right and the\ndifference between winning and losing\nhappiness and sadness is so small it's\nalmost it's almost scary to talk about\nbut the good news is I think I kind of\nknow what it is and it's this one more\nabsolutely the people that I know that\nare the most successful and happy have\nmore uncomfortable conversation agreed\nthey have more uncomfortable days\nthey're more discomfort in their lives\nyes but selected discomfort but one of\nthe other things that I'm asking from\nnow I'm like going into like the people\nthat I know that that I'm thinking about\nand can see their faces and and I want\nthem to know that I'm asking for them a\nlot of the time one more in the wrong\ndirection that's right can also be\nreally misguiding\nsometimes uh people and I know you're a\nperson of Faith too and so so we can\ntouch on this sometimes we're climbing\nthe mountain and we keep doing one more\nbut we're actually going further away\nfrom who we are who we want to be our\nfaith our partners right we've we know\npeople who've built\nmulti-billion dollar companies but lost\ntheir kids that's right or they've\nbecome famous and Rich but they've uh\ntheir partner cheated on them you know\nlike we know a lot of those stuff and\nyou know people who didn't do all of\nthat and that's happened too like it's\nit's both ways how does one use one more\nand make sure it's in the right\ndirection that's a great question I'm\ndoing this now regularly because I've\nmade some of those mistakes of just and\nwhat I do is I check in with myself one\nmore time meaning it's important to ask\nyourself what matters to me now see if\nyou we had this conversation 20 years\nago the things that mattered to me then\nare so different than What mattered to\nme now but a lot of us keep operating\nout of what used maybe you've achieved\nor pursuing a dream and it's really\ntruly no longer your dream it's no\nlonger your dream it's when I was young\nlisten if we're gonna do a podcast you\nsay hey I need you on the show people\nare going to love you you're gonna get\nrecognition you're gonna get you're\ngoing to get all this acknowledgment and\nthat would have been my my hot button my\nneed you know I believe in the six human\nneeds my need was significance and\nrecognition and there's nothing wrong\nwith that it's wonderful and so that's\nthe button to get me to move would be\nsignificance recognition well I've been\nblessed the last 30 years or so of my\nlife to have a beautiful abundance of\nsignificance and recognition it's no\nlonger what fills me now you get me to\ndo an interview you go hey I really\nthink we could help some people my big\nbutton in my life now is contribution\nthere was another stage in my life it's\nstill there but hey if you go there\nyou'll grow I still want to grow but I\nknow me now right now I'm in a season of\nmy life that's contribution it's giving\nit's what fills my heart and I think\nit's checking in with yourself one more\ntime what matters to me now what do I\nwant now what's important to me now what\nseason maybe you're in a season where\nyou need to rest maybe your spirit and\neverything about you is telling you hey\nit's time to feed you again it's time to\nrecharge if that that's the season then\nanswer that call don't play out of a\npast Playbook and so for me that's the\nseason I'm in now and I'm sure that in\nfive or eight more years you know\nthere'll be something else but I\nregularly on a monthly basis you\nrecommend it in your book so beautifully\nabout your relationship checking in you\nhave these strategies you teach about\nweekly and monthly and quarterly and\nyearly with your partner of checking in\nwith them I also recommend you check in\nwith yourself what matters to you now\nand so for me it's a matter of checking\nin now so that I don't lose my family in\nthe pursuit of my business or lose me\nyeah lose me who am I anymore and I've\nhad times where I'm like\nthis doesn't feel like me anymore yeah\nand I had at least the ability to at\nleast acknowledge that and make a change\nyeah and I love that you brought up\nSeasons because I feel like\nno one and on planet Earth we don't have\nthe power to change the season but you\nhave the power to live the season well\nthat's right you can either be in the\nright now it's been raining right\nwherever we are it's been like pouring\ndown with rain there's all this effort\nyou could carry an umbrella well you can\ntell how I'm dressed I'm definitely not\ndressed in my usual gear right because\nI'm dressed for the rain I'm prepared\nyes because that's all I can do I can't\nmake the rain switch off I can't stop it\nright like I can't do that and so I love\nhearing that you're just learning how to\nthrive in the season and so if your\nseason's telling you to rest you can't\nforce the season and you you have to\nlive it through you have to experience\nit you know I think you have to remember\none thing man I think it's as easy as a\nperson to forget this and I just would\nlove to say this because you have such\nan amazing reach each of you you and I\nincluded\nwe were born to do something great with\nour life\nwe were born to do something great with\nour life and it's important to check in\nfrom time to time of what that current\ngreat thing is and May and sometimes we\nthink it's the big things it's the\npeople that are on both our shows\nthey've made this big movie they've got\nthis big song They're this big thing you\nknow who's greater the man who helped my\ndad get sober\nor the fact that maybe I've helped some\npeople because my dad got sober that one\nact was greatness in his life that kind\nmoment with another person that says I\ncan help you let me connect with you and\nso don't discount your own greatness\nyour own call to do something great and\nit doesn't have to be a script or a play\nor a book or a speech or on social media\nit's just doing something great and you\nmatter I don't I don't mean this hokey\nI'm telling you the truth about you you\nmatter you were born to do something\nawesome with your life your family's\nsupposed to do something great as a\nfamily and if maybe it's just checking\nin and reminding yourself of that and\nthen asking yourself what is that thing\nright now in my life and so I just think\nthat reminder is so important that you\nknow it's great to voyeuristically look\nin on successful people or what we think\nare successful people it's also\nimportant that the camera turn back on\nyou and go you matter you matter\nand that's probably the most important\nthing we'd say today oh gosh man yeah\nand you know one thing you just\nclarified beautifully is that\ngreat doesn't have to be big no and big\ndoesn't mean gray right and I think\nwe're so obsessed today we are in that\nto do something great it has to be big\nit has to be bold you know when I think\nabout myself honestly I didn't and I can\nsay this to you because I think I think\nin these sessions and when we spend time\ntogether you've heard my heart\nI was one of those people who actually\nnever believed I could do any of this\nstuff I've done I never set out when I\nstarted and I was like oh one day I'm\ngonna be I I didn't have any of that\nthat's not how I'm wired I was wired in\nlike I want to serve I want to serve\nwhoever comes whether it's five people\nten people I'm happy I'll serve them and\nas I started to do that I got more\nconfidence okay now I want to serve\nlarger groups okay let me serve them and\nthen it was like and I never believed at\nany point that there were these\narbitrary abstract goals of like number\none this like those one how I set out\nand so when I'm listening to you speak\nI hope someone's out there thinking Jay\nI'm like Janette I'm like you guys where\nit's like I don't Vibe with all that\nlike like motivation this like I Just\nVibe with the fact that I want to have a\ngreat impact like the person that helped\nyour father yeah and you know what we've\nboth found in our life too just to give\nyou Insight from um someone called me\nseasoned today you know this is that um\nyou know the universe or God really\nprepares you to step into the next room\nwhen you step in with some faith and so\nmaybe it does start with five or six\npeople and maybe that's enough but\nperhaps in that space you're in there'll\nbe a little door open and if you step\ninto that one you'll you'll find I think\nwe think I have to have it all figured\nout wozniak's a good buddy of mine who\nstarted Apple they didn't they were a\nboard company they didn't really be\ndoing this someday they stepped into the\nnext space and one thing I think we also\nwant is an immediate result and I talk\nabout this in the book maybe it would be\nthe last little thing I'll share with\nyou but I went to a birthday party as I\nwas writing the book and it was for a\nyoung boy and um they had a pinata we've\nall been to a special in California you\nhave the pinata and so what they did is\nthey took eight of these little guys\nthey blindfolded them and spun them\naround and they're all dizzy and they're\nswinging and they're not even near the\npinata that's life a lot of times you\nfeel like man I'm blind I don't even\nknow where I'm swinging right now but\nI'm swinging and so each kid hit the\npinata and the candy didn't come out\nand so they take the blindfold off that\nkid got tired the next little boy came\nup spun him around so like seven of them\nhit this pinata no candy came out the\nlast boy the smallest boy the youngest\nboy there they fill the blindfold on him\nthey spin them around he's swinging too\nthat's life you just sort of swinging\nright he finally Point him at the pinata\nhe hits the pinata just once bam all the\ncandy comes out and all the kids jump on\nand celebrate\nand I'm watching that and I'm going\nnow who broke the pinata was it the last\nshot or was it the cumulative blows of\neach of the shots on the pinata well we\nall know the answer it was the\ncumulative shots Life's a lot like that\nman that we're taking shots but we don't\nsee any physical progress but everyone\nmore we're doing is compound pounding\nprogress and in life you have to be\nwilling to buy into what is invisible\nprogress most people quit on their dream\nquit on their Vision before the candy\ncomes out\nand what you and I didn't do is quit we\njust kept swinging and eventually the\ncandy comes out the candy could be your\nbliss your joy your financial success\nyour notoriety your contribution but\nmost people are hitting the pinata of\ntheir life and there's no evidence it's\nworking\nbut the truth is there's a compound\npounding effect in life that if you keep\nhitting your life's pinata if you'll\nstick around there'll be some candy come\nout uh the power of one more everyone Ed\nmy let go and grab this book if you\nhaven't already it's gonna be a life\nchange I mean I
