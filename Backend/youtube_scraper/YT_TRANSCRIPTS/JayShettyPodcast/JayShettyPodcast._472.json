    "transcript": "what would you say for you as being one\nof your like proudest moments or\ngreatest achievements or something that\nyou really feel like and internally I\nmean like for the basis of our\nconversation like something that really\nbrings you Joy internally when you think\nabout it or when when you had it like I\nsaid I look back and the things that\nI've accomplished just even my job like\nI think I really at one point when I was\nyounger decided I want to be a model and\nthis is what I want to do and the fact\nthat I executed because we talk about\nthat determination like I really was I\nwas 14 years old when I kind of made\nthat decision and was like this is what\nI want to do and I went to my mom and I\nwas like please help me do this and I\ndidn't stop until I was 24 that I was\nlike okay I think I need to like take it\nback a notch which we could also get\ninto because that's a very yeah kind of\ndramatic story but like I\nI just knew and I think I'm proud of\nmyself for being that kid and being\ndetermined to do that and then executing\nand doing it to the to the level that I\nhad done it and that I guess I still do\nbut I I also am proud of I think more so\nthe self work that I've done within that\nprocess because there was a long period\nof time I'd say the core five years of\nit that I was extremely overworked\nnot my happiest not because I wasn't\ndoing what I loved but just because I\nwas overwhelmed and I was I felt like I\nwas saying yes to everything because I\nfelt really really grateful and really\nhonored to be in the position that I was\nin so I was always saying yes\nand it just took a lot out of me to the\npoint where I just wasn't happy anymore\nand so I had to set those boundaries for\nmyself when I was about 23 24 I'd say\nlike what a year before the pandemic so\nyeah I was probably 23. I really set\nboundaries for myself and I was like I\nwant to continue to do this because this\nis what I love but I need to start\nsaying no when I can and prioritizing me\nand prioritizing like you know my\nhappiness and my well-being and it has\ndone wonders for me like I feel like I\ncan show up better for myself and I can\nshow up a better person for the people\nthat get to be around me that day and\nyou know that I work with on that day so\nyeah yeah so that's what I'm proud of\nsorry to give you a long answer that's\nan amazing I won't say I was hoping for\nthat because I I'm always open to\nwherever anyone's life experience goes\nbut there's a part of me that loves\nhearing that like I really appreciate\nhearing that because when you've\nachieved so many incredible things in\nyour career which you have to then say\nwell this is the part like knowing how\nto navigate it or right making the right\nchoices at the right time healthy\nbalance the healthy balance it's so\nimportant it's important for all of us\nyeah like we have to this is what we're\nprioritizing you know yeah so how did\nyou find the courage to do that at the\n23 markers you're saying you're in a\ncompetitive industry as you said it was\noverworking it's fast paced I'm guessing\nthere's comparison in that industry\nthere's competition in that industry\nit's not an easy space to be you're of\ncourse you know you're in the top 0.01\nin your industry so it's it's hard\nand the reason I asked this is because I\nwork with so many people in this space\nand to have the courage to say no I know\nthat if I sort this out then all of this\nis going to be just fine that actually\ntakes more courage than we recognize we\nrealize that when you have nothing then\nthere's nothing to lose you can actually\nhave a lot of Courage right but when you\nhave everything and there's everything\nto lose and a lot of the time at least\nwhat I've heard in in town is you know\nolder managers and agents and I'm not\nsaying you have any of this but people\nthat I know will be told well hey if you\ndon't do this like you'll be forgotten\nnext year or you know your career is\nonly going to last another six months\nhow did you have that courage to say no\nno I need to do this like where did that\ncome from and I think that it's interest\nlike I've never thought about it that\nway to be completely honest with you I\njust knew that if I had gone any further\nthat I was going to lose myself I was at\nthat very I was on the teeter-totter\nedge of that point where had I gone any\nfurther I was probably not going to be\ngreat it was so important to me to feel\ngood that I just knew that it was\nsomething that I had to do and I can't\nsay like\nyou're absolutely right like there were\nso many people around me that had told\nme not to say no and told or told me\nyeah told me not to say no told me not\nto stop I fought my way out of it a\nlittle bit because there were people\nthat had worked for me that you know\ndidn't\nwant me to stop because it might have\nbenefited them of course\num but I got to that point and I just\nknew I had to do it and I just I don't\nknow I don't know how to explain it I\nguess yeah it was just such an\nunbelievable Sensation that I had where\nI knew that if I do this I'm gonna be\nbetter for everyone and I'm gonna be\nbetter for myself which means I'm gonna\nbe better for the people around me and I\nhave to do this and so it wasn't really\nI want to be able to live\nwith happiness God forbid any of this\never went away and I think that that was\na big moment for me of being like I'm\ngonna be okay if I don't get this job\ntomorrow and I'm gonna be okay if I\ndon't get that job in a month if I have\nto take this time to do whatever things\nwill come everything's going to work out\nthe way it's supposed to and I had to\ntrust that yeah well to me on from the\noutside and it's it's beautiful that you\ndidn't see it in yourself because that\nalways makes it even more wonderful but\nthe idea that to me from the outset\nthat's a lot of Courage yeah I think it\ntakes a lot of Courage it takes a lot of\nvulnerability and openness and and it\ntakes courage at every level whether\nsomeone's thinking about quitting their\njob to do something they love or whether\nsomeone's trying to relocate their\nfamily it doesn't know how or whether\nSomeone Like You is feeling success but\nthen going well wait a minute and I\nthink in the past few years we've seen\nathletes and musicians and actors and\npeople in all creative Industries step\nback and say well I need to put me first\nyeah and I think that that's empowering\nbecause I think we hear about burnout in\nwhat was it that you started to do with\nthat Newfound time at that time like\nwhere was is that where the Curious was\nthe Curiosity always there and now you\ncould actually follow it it was it was\nit was always there and I had had a lot\nof people coming to me telling me about\nmeditation and how it changed their life\nand therapy and so many different things\nand I was a bit overwhelmed because I\nwas like oh my God what if this is gonna\nsuit me I think it's a very personal\nexperience I think everybody has a very\ndifferent version of all of that stuff\nand so it was a little overwhelming so I\nthink I really just took the time to be\noff for a second it was even the little\nthings it was like being able to go to\nmy friend's birthday party which I\nwouldn't have been able to go to before\nbecause I was working a lot I I love\nhearing that because I think it is those\nsimple things like\nyou know giving yourself that space\nwhatever it is that you needed to do\nyeah when you needed it and and like you\nsaid sometimes it's like that's when all\nthe Subscribe buttons come up in front\nof you and it's like try this and try\nthis and it's like well no no let me\njust take my time it was also now that I\nthink about it yeah 23 I'm 26. I've had\nmy horse for so around that time is when\nI bought the horse that I have now\nwho is my like I I jump her and I like\nhow I I have two other horses but\nthey're like retired so I don't really\nride them the same way I ride her so\nyeah I guess it was around that time too\nthat I was like I'm gonna do this\nbecause I love this and like I want to\nget back into it and this is what I've\nloved my whole life so so it was around\nthat time that I feel like all of that\nstarted happening and I bought my horse\nand I like started taking more time for\nthings that made me really happy yeah\nwhat I what I'm noticing in you and\nobserving or at least from just no in a\ngood way\nI was just saying it's like it feels\nlike no matter what's happening in your\norbit there's this pillar of belief that\nit's important to be happy yeah like it\nyou know that's like this core Center\nbelief in your life where it's important\nto be happy it's important to be happy\nit's that has to be the goal for sure\nand you know it's not always easy we\nlive in such an interesting industry and\nin such an interesting time with social\nmedia that it can be very hard sometimes\nyou can fall victim to so many things\nthat don't serve you and that don't make\nyou happy if your happiness depends on\nthe actions of others\nyou know you're at Mercy of things that\nyou can't control and that's never where\nI want to be so I I always want to live\nin like me and my therapist talk about\nlike my higher goddess my higher self\nlike I always want to live there knowing\nthat\nyou know when I'm there you can't take\nthat away from me that that's mine and\nno matter what you can disagree with me\nyou can agree with me that's not going\nmy I'm not changing I'm not shifting I'm\nhere I'm in my higher goddess so I kind\nof I always live by like\nkeep holding my happiness and not\nletting anyone else affect it and though\nI fall victim to it at times of course\nas we all probably do absolutely I um I\nstrive every day to live in that place\nso what what are some of the qualities\nof your higher goddess so that that kind\nof uh Avatar like she's awesome like I\nsaid I don't love a pity party I also\nlike you know sometimes it feels weird\nto like say good things about yourself\nbut I've also learned a lot about\ntalking to myself and a lot about\nlooking in the mirror and being like\nyou're great you're gorgeous you're\namazing you're loyal you're positive\nyou're so many like I love words of\naffirmation I love just sitting there\nand reassuring myself of who I am\nbecause that's another thing for me you\nknow there's so many false narratives\nabout me about all of us I'm sure like\nso many people think they have you\nfigured out when they don't even know\nthe half of it so sitting there and\nbeing like you know you know you get\nfrustrated sometimes it could feel\nreally unfair you could be reading\nsomething that someone is saying about\nyou or hearing something that someone's\nsaying about you and being like that is\nso unfair because that's not who I am\nand that really gets to me sometimes and\nthat really sucks\nbut then looking at myself in the mirror\nand being like but I know who I am and\nthat's all why does anything else matter\nand my friends know who I am and my\nfamily knows who I am my dog knows who I\nam my horse knows who I am like why does\nany of everything else is just noise I I\ndo this exercise I don't think I've\nshared this before but I do this\nexercise with some of my clients where\nwe'll go on a walk and we'll be on a\nhike wherever we are and I'll ask them\nwhat they think a piece of you know\nmaybe there's a little leaf or maybe\nthere's some a flower or something that\nlooks a little unique on the path and\nI'll say what do you think that feels\nlike and what do you think it would feel\nlike if you picked it up in your hand\nand they'll be like oh it looks really\nrough and like it might scratch me and\nlike it looks like a bit you know like\nuneven or whatever and it looks kind of\nhard and strong and then I lost them to\npick it up and nine times out of ten\nit's completely different like I'll pick\nit up and it'll just dissolve in their\nhands or they'll turn it over and the\ncolor's really soft yeah and sorry the\nshape the shape's really soft and the\ncolors totally different on the other\nside and I do that exercise to help us\nrealize just how multifaceted humans are\nyeah today I've got to meet you and and\nobviously we're spending a lot of deep\nintimate vulnerable time together so you\nlearn faster about someone but if\nsomeone only follows someone on social\nmedia or only sees someone at an event\nor only sees one interview it's so easy\nto create such a singular view of\nsomeone right and I think and I want to\nsay this because I really think we all\nfeel it I don't think anyone wants to be\nseen in a singular way if you had to\nchoose one word that had to be you for\nthe rest of your life I don't think\nanyone knows that I think of course I\nknow that we're messy and complex and\ndifferent of course but we like to put\nsomeone else in a box whoever that may\nbe because it's easier than to live life\nand say okay well that's persons a be\nright yeah I know so there's this\nbeautiful piece of wisdom that I always\nshare from Charles Horton Cooley and he\nwrote this in 1890 I think it was which\njust shows how true this has been for\nsuch a long time and obviously long\nbefore that as well and he said the\nchallenge today is I'm not what I think\nI am I'm not what you think I am I am\nwhat I think you think I am and we'll\nlet that blow everyone's mind right it\ngives me chills every time I say it yeah\nCharles Hilton Cooley said the challenge\ntoday is I'm not what I think I am I'm\nnot what you think I am\nI am what I think you think I am and\nwhat he's trying to say is that we live\nin a perception of a perception of\nourselves so if I think you think I'm\nsmart then I allow myself to feel smart\nright it's like we need that value we\nneed that validation or if I think you\nthink I'm not smart then I feel her yeah\nand and the challenge is I don't know\nwhat you're thinking at all or\nespecially outside in the world and so I\nfind that what you're saying around like\nwell what do I think about myself like\nhow do I feel about myself how do the\npeople that actually know me feel about\nme I think that's really empowering if\nyou love this episode you will also love\nmy interview with Kendall Jenner on\nsetting boundaries to increase happiness\nand healing your inner child"
