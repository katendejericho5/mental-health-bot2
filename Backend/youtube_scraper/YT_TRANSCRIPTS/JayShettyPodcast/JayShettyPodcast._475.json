    "transcript": "you have to be honest with yourself\nabout why are you still here why are you\nholding on what's really driving you you\ndon't feel like starting the process\nover with somebody else so even though\nyou're not feeling it with him you're\nwasting your time the best-selling\nauthor and host the number one Health\nand Wellness podcast on purpose with Jay\nShetty\nwhat are the signs that someone deeply\nloves you because I feel like we live in\nthis world where we're always wondering\ndo they love me do they like me do they\nreally like me are they really into me\nhow do you know when you deeply love\nsomeone and when someone deeply loves\nyou how do you even know so I'm gonna\nstart with an answer that people\nprobably won't expect\nto me the first key is do you truly love\nthem\nbecause look at it like this to me a lot\nof people get caught up in infatuation\num they have unhealthy attachments they\nhave different motivations to why they\ndecided this is the person that I want\nand that can make them feel like they're\nin love but to me true love flows both\nways it's not a one-sided thing so when\nyou can say I I'm not into them like\nthat if we look deep into that situation\nI can almost guarantee what we'll find\nis infatuation attachment something else\nbut when you can say no I feel it too\nI'm deeply in love with them I think\nthat's your first key because without\nthat nothing else matters because a lot\nof people are choosing Partners based\noff of what they love me so much so I\nassume it's safe here and this is a good\nchoice to make but the safe choice is\nusually the wrong choice and a lot of\nthese people select this individual\nthinking everything's going to be okay\nbut because you're not really into them\nyou can never be what they need and they\nwere never truly what you needed which\nis why you never even got to that level\nwith them so to choose them without\nfirst evaluating do you truly love them\nwould not be wise yeah that's that's a\ngreat question and I think people\nstruggle with that question too because\nI think we think of love as so many\ndifferent things wrapped into one for\nexample I could think I love someone\nbecause of how they treat me I could\nthink I love someone because they have\none quality that I really wish I had or\nI could love someone because I think\nthat they're out of my league and they\ngive me a bit of attention yeah and so\nwhat we think is love\nis so complex and so wide that we never\nstop to ask ourselves like what does\nlove mean like what's the definition of\nlove like how do I Define love so how do\nyou define love and how do you encourage\nother people to create their definitions\nof Love well for me first off is always\nGod is love and then when we take it\nfrom there love is about kindness\ncompassion patience understanding a\nwillingness to be selfless important to\nthat individual but I think what's also\nimportant for people to understand is\nwhen we're trying to apply it to\nromantic relationships we have to\nunderstand that there's other\ningredients that are necessary before we\ncan move forward so you could love\nsomeone dearly but if they are not\nemotionally ready because maybe they\nhaven't healed from their past maybe\nthere's still some things that need to\nwork out in their life then it wouldn't\nbe time to move forward in a\nrelationship with them and we have this\nbad habit of the minute we feel like\nthere's love there we want to move\nforward exactly and as you mentioned we\ncan get caught up sometimes in but we\nlove them because of what they do for us\nbut what are you prepared to do for them\nlove is about giving all right so we\nhave to ask ourselves okay do we know\nwhat their needs are are we willing to\nfulfill those needs because if not maybe\nthis wasn't love maybe it just felt good\nin the moment maybe you got caught up in\nthe hype and that's okay it happens to\nalmost all of us if not all of us at\nsome point in life but we have to just\nbe real very clear with ourselves about\nwhat's really driving the intention\nright now but I think all those things I\nmentioned is what encompasses love of\nand that's like the foundation of it and\nthen from there we have to look at some\nother things to see how we can move\nforward so many times like you you\nconvince yourself something's love and\nwhat I find really interesting is that\nso many people fall in love too fast and\nno one wants to go for the slow patient\nunderstanding love which is what love\nrequires you just said love is kind love\nis patient love is understanding those\nthings take time I think those things\ntake time to nurture and to to make sure\nthat we're doing it correctly for each\nother so it's about learning each\nother's Love Languages and how we make\nit work in within that Dynamic I think\nalso because so many people are not used\nto dealing with emotions at on that\nlevel being that vulnerable people\nmishandle it all right so it takes time\nfor us to get to a place so we\nunderstand how to manage this and work\nthrough this however I think that I'm a\nhuge believer in connection and I\nbelieve connection is like your spirit\nrecognizing its match and it's very\ninstant when you speak to couples who\nsaid they experience a connection\nthey'll tell you first conversation\nfirst time meeting first date first week\nit was pretty fast so to me the the\nrecognizing of something deeper being\nhere can happen very quickly but how we\nnow cultivate that and how we move\nforward is where we need to take our\ntime and make sure we're not rushing and\noverlooking certain important issues\nthat need to be discussed and addressed\nfirst to me it's the understanding of\nchemistry versus compatibility and the\nidea that there needs to be a spark\nthere needs to be a connection that I\nfeel with someone like you're saying on\na deeper level but I find that I find\nthat most people are not\nAdept and knowing whether the connection\nthey feel with someone is deeper or\nphysical yeah like I would say that it's\neasy to it you can often feel a spark\nwith if you meet a lot of people you can\nfeel a spot with a lot of people but\nthat doesn't mean that they're the right\nperson to build a relationship\nabsolutely right yes so it's connection\nto me is a very rare occurrence right\nyes so I feel that people who've\nactually experienced it they can tell\nyou maybe once in their life if you're\nlucky two times maybe all right but it's\nnot this thing that happens with\neverybody whereas chemistry uh feeling\nof spark these things can happen with a\nlot of different people yeah so I do\nthink there's there's this education\nthat's needed to understand how we\ndifferentiate these things so that we\ndon't confuse them because I see a lot\nof people take that chemistry and think\noh this is it this is the one it's like\nbut you had chemistry with the last five\npeople why is this one the one and not\nthem so I do think we have to be careful\nwith that yeah I think so so we're on\nthe same page there's three things\nthere's connection on the deeper level\nthere's chemistry which is like the\nspark on a more superficial level and\nthen there's compatibility which is like\nwhat makes get lost and I can relate to\nthat with my wife I definitely felt so I\nI'm one of those people who I kind of\nknew from the first few moments when I\nmet my wife before she was my wife was\nlike I was like yeah this is my person\nlike I felt that way yeah for sure I\nfelt that connection\nand there was chemistry there too but it\nhad to be turned into compatibility in\norder to create a long lasting\nrelationship we've been together for 10\nyears we're still learning building\ngoing through everything but that was a\nbig part of it so that I can get behind\nis do you see it that way too or is\nthere something different in so how do\nyou see it believe it or not I used to\nmake compatibility the least important\nbut that was because I was looking at it\nthe wrong way once I kind of looked at\nthe definition again and compatibility\nis about two people coexisting in\nharmony yeah then I was like okay no you\nyou have to have that I just I got\ncaught up more so in like let's say a\ndating site says okay we're gonna decide\nwho's compatible so I view compatible as\nlike an on the paper it looks good it's\nsupposed to match but you can have a lot\nof people who are supposed to be\ncompatible and it doesn't work\nabsolutely so I think that it's\ncompatibility is that add-on once we\nhave the connection and the chemistry\nnow we have to create that Harmony which\nis the compatibility yes I agree with\nyou and and it is interesting how that\nword compatibility is thrown around and\nyou're so right that\ncompatibility on paper doesn't mean\ncompatibility in real life exactly and\nto me\ncompatibility really has another word\ninside of it which is like adaptability\nand\nthat deeper understanding of an\nindividual where you know how much\nyou're willing to adapt around certain\nparts of the relationship but we'll get\nto that I think a lot of people like you\nknow and and that's where we got into\nthis conversation around what is slow a\nlot of people are waiting\nto feel like is this person wasting my\ntime are they the one and so they don't\nhave a deeper connection maybe they had\nthat spark of chemistry and now that's\nkind of subsided\nhow do you know if someone's wasting\nyour time how do you know if you're\nletting yourself be used or wasted in\nthat way so to me again I think it\nalways starts with self and you have to\nbe honest with yourself about why are\nyou still here why are you holding on\nwhat's really driving you because just\nuse an example let's say you're a woman\nand the only reason why you're holding\non to this guy is because he's a nice\nguy you don't feel like starting the\nprocess over with somebody else so even\nthough you're not feeling it with him\nyou figure let me try to make it work\nyou're wasting your time this is where\nyou're setting yourself up for disaster\nevery single time so if it's not born\nout of a true connection love a genuine\ndesire you really like this individual\nof course there's always things we have\nto work through but is the foundation\nstrong enough for us to say okay we can\nmake something special here and I think\nonce we are honest with ourselves that\nkind of helps answer the question\nbecause sometimes we get so caught up\ntrying to animal lies the other\nindividual that is like we get in our\nheads and now we're missing the mark on\nwhat's really important here and we\ncan't always\nsay for sure what's going on with them I\nwill say that in general if this person\nisn't willing to talk about things\nthey're wasting your time if they're not\nwilling to address or correct things\nthat have been talked about they're\nwasting your time if you guys aren't on\nthe same page about what you want and\nwhere you want to go in life wasting\ntime so there are some things I think we\ncan just look at and say listen this is\npointless here but a lot of times and I\nhave to say this especially for women\nwomen's intuition is extremely powerful\nI'm a huge believer in it and I feel\nlike women know very early this isn't it\nbut they rationalize reasons to convince\nthemselves to give this man a chance and\nthis again is a waste of time because it\njust doesn't work I've seen people\nturn what should have been maybe a\ncouple weeks of dating into years of\nbeing married to someone they were not\nhappy with\nall because they did not listen to\nthemselves from the beginning they knew\nwhat it was but they just could not\naccept it for what it was yeah and I\nlove that point on intuition it's almost\nlike when a relationship finally ends a\nlot of us think to ourselves I knew they\nweren't right yeah like I knew it I knew\nthat they weren't the one but you just\ndidn't listen to that part of yourself\nyes so so let's break it down for people\nlet's help people out we started talking\nabout three very important words\nconnection which you defined chemistry\nwhich we've defined in compatibility\nwhich we've defined how do people know\nthe difference between connection and\nchemistry when they meet someone because\nI find that\nthe science shows that you're\nexperiencing dopamine and cortisol at\nthe same times you're experiencing the\nreward chemical and stress chemical at\nthe same time which gives you that\nchemistry feeling which is the feeling\nof butterflies in your stomach or like\ndo they like me are they into me what\nshould I wear that kind of feeling but\nthen you're talking about a deeper\nconnection\nhow do you hear the difference because I\nthink a lot of us just get swept up in\nthe feeling of I'm So Into that person\nthey're so into me how do you know so I\nthink one is are you even being yourself\nor can you be yourself with this\nindividual if if you're presenting your\nrepresentative then this is not a real\nconnection this is them falling for that\nperson that you're presenting but that's\nnot real so to me you have you should be\nalready being yourself but with that\nperson you have a connection with it's a\nmore natural flow we don't have to force\nit we just feel so much more comfortable\naround them I think in addition to that\nis when you when you find yourself all\ncaught up in the moment and caught up in\nthat chemistry again you have to ask\nyourself what am I really attaching\nmyself to what about what do I really\nlike about this individual what I find\nis that when it's really about chemistry\nwe're still on the surface you don't\nreally know about them yet you just know\nyou guys had a good time maybe you had\nfun at this event you guys were able to\ntalk about a lot of different things\nwhich is great which is gonna also be\nimportant if there is a connection\nhowever do you even know what college\ndid they want do you know what kind of\nLife they want to live you know are you\nguys really on the same page I think\nconnection is our paths align our\npurpose is align so for us to align we\nhave to have a deeper understanding of\nwhere we're headed and can we head there\ntogether so so that's why I think though\nyou may feel it or you may feel like\nyou're feeling it you have to do your\ndue diligence to dig deeper to find out\nokay is this just I got caught up on the\nsurface or there is something real here\nyeah and I think once we ask enough\nquestions because I think that's the\nother big problem we have this\nexperience where we feel this chemistry\nwe're so excited and now we're afraid to\nask questions because we don't want to\nblow up the fantasy yes you know what\nI'm saying we're just like no no I want\nto keep believing this is great so let\nme not ask anything let me not run this\nperson away let me not rock the boat but\nthat's going to be what tells us if this\nis real or not yes I think you're I\nthink you've hit on something there like\nwe're so scared of losing someone that\nwe're okay with not asking important\nquestions and discovering important\ntruths that actually define whether this\nrelationship is going to last absolutely\nand that is ultimately going back to\nyour point earlier that is ultimately\nyou not being yourself right you're\nlosing yourself scared that you're going\nto lose the other person so you're okay\nwith not being yourself do you think\nit's ever okay this is a funny question\nI think but I have to ask you because I\nthink it's a healthy discussion\ndo you think it's ever okay\nto present different sides of yourself\nin order to attract someone or do you\nthink that you're ultimately setting\nyourself up for failure in a\nrelationship almost like I think a lot\nof people they may not become someone\ncompletely different but I think a lot\nof people are like oh I'm gonna show my\nsmart side because it will attract this\nperson or I'm gonna show my this side\nbecause they're like that are you saying\nany of that kind of molding is unhealthy\nor do you think there's room for that I\nthink anything that is not sustainable\nis unhealthy so look at it as if I'm a\nman and I'm meeting this woman I want to\nimpress her so I'm like okay I'm gonna\ntry to spend all my money take a nice\nfive-star restaurant all these things\nbut deep inside I prefer a more simple\nlifestyle you know I don't like all that\nextra stuff okay that's horrible that's\na sale for disaster that's unhealthy\nbecause you can't sustain what you're\npresenting to that individual that's\ngonna draw them in so whatever it is\nanother like common example is you'll\nhave women who love to communicate they\nwant to be able to talk to you every\nsingle day but because they're afraid of\ncoming off a certain kind of way they'll\nhold back on their communication so now\nthey'll make it seem like they're okay\nwith talking every now and then we don't\nalways have to text\nand then this guy falls for that he\nfalls for this low standard I won't call\nlow standard but not having such a high\nexpectation of him when it comes to\ncommunication then he finally gets with\nthe woman her true self is going to come\nout at some point no one can suppress\ntheir true self forever it comes out and\nnow it's like what is this I did not\nsign up for this now we're fighting now\nwe're stressed because you want him to\ncall you more he was used to you not\nbeing worried about it so much that's\nwhy it's going to always not work out so\nit's extremely unhealthy unless we're\npresenting a side of us that is truly us\nand we can sustain it you've hit on\nsomething again that that\nat the beginning of relationships we\noften display\nunrealistic standards and we set those\nyes and then when things shift and now\nyou're back in reality again the other\nperson's like but wait a minute I\nthought you were really into me and I\neven went through that with my wife when\nwe first met\nI was able to spend pretty much every\nday with her because I didn't have a job\nand so I was looking for work I was\napplying I would go see her at her\nCollege every day and I would spend the\nday with her and I'd be in the library\napplying for jobs while she was studying\nyeah and I could see it every day and I\nthink I saw every day potentially for\nlike six months maybe every single day\nfive days a week at least\nand then when I got a job that wasn't\nthe case anymore because I was at work\nnow and I'd set this unrealistic\nexpectation that we could see each other\nall the time and even in the beginning I\nwould see her all the time because I'd\nspend time with her family but we\nwouldn't spend time with my family\nbecause I hadn't told my family yet and\nso now that my family knew we were\ntrying to split the time and all of a\nsudden it was like wait a minute we used\nto spend time at my house and so even in\nlittle things like that it took a bit of\nadapting because I'd set a false\nstandard in our relationship and then\nthankfully my wife was adapting and she\nunderstood and she got it and it was\nfine but I think for so many people you\nset unrealistic expectations in who you\nare yes and that's hard to come back\nfrom absolutely yeah and that's why it's\nso important for us to know who we are\nso that we can present the real from the\njump you know because again A lot of\ntimes people you know this idea that\nwe're always changing yes I do think\nwe're always evolving but some of the\nbig shifts that you see are is not\nbecause that's just the way life is it's\nbecause you did take the time to figure\nyourself out first and then you got with\nthis person and now you want them to\nadjust now thank God for you she was\nable to adjust but there's a lot of\npeople that they can't handle that yeah\nand now everything falls apart from\nthere so that's why yeah we have to be\nvery careful with what we're presenting\nfrom the beginning yeah it's I I agree\nwith you on that that we think people\nchange but actually they just start to\nunderstand themselves exactly they went\nfrom being completely unconscious about\nwho they were you met an unconscious\nversion of a person yeah and now you\nthink they're changing but they just\nbecame conscious of who they are\nabsolutely and but the thing is Stefan\nas you know like Society doesn't\nencourage that time of getting to know\nyourself right when you're young you're\nnot trained in how to think about who\nyou want to be you're trained in\nthinking about what you want to I do\nit's about your job it's about your\ncareer you're not thinking about who you\nare as a human being or as a person\nso how do we in this Society where\nunderstanding who you are is not clear\nit's not encouraged\nwhere where does one start or where have\nyou kind of found great insights in\ntrying to discover who we are I would\nlove to see more parents\nencouraging their children to explore\nhow they're feeling about who they are\nlike what I have found is a lot of\npeople who let's say I I had one client\nwhere she wanted to be an actress when\nshe was a little kid uh but parents kind\nof push in a different direction now\nshe's like a social worker but her\ndesire is still to be an actress like\nthe things that they they wanted to do\nthey they want to do as an adult now you\ncan find back in their childhood in a\nlot of cases so I feel like too many\npeople have stifled their children's\ngrowth in certain areas with limited\nideas of well this can't make money or\nthis wouldn't be a good look for the\nfamily or whatever the case may be it's\nlike no let them walk in it and see for\nthemselves if that's really where they\nbelong outside of that for me I think\nthe big thing is getting in tune\nspiritually I'm just a huge believer in\nthat I feel like me finding myself was\nwhen I went into what I call my\nWilderness period I kind of just shut\neverything off that I was doing because\nI used to be all over having fun\npartying all these different things\nthings and then God kind of slapped me\nupside my head and I had to like really\npull away from everything and go deeper\nfrom within and it felt like a process\nof breaking me down to build me right\nback up and that's when I start to see\nthings clearer because what I realized\nis the world is filled with distractions\nand it's the distractions why we can't\nsee ourselves for who we really are if\nwe simply shut off the distractions long\nenough you will learn a lot so even if\nsomeone just took a year off\ndon't worry you know limit the TV you're\nwatching limit the music you're\nlistening to limit all the internet\nstuff just really go deeper within\nyourself spend more time alone spend\nmore time you know thinking and\nprocessing you will learn a lot because\nagain a lot of it is it isn't a problem\nof we don't know ourselves we are not\naware and we're not willing to accept\nand once we allow ourselves to do those\ntwo things become aware and then accept\nit we become free yeah I I mean I agree\nwith you I think that I've always been a\nbig proponent of solitude to understand\nwho you are because as soon as you have\nanother person you now have another\nperson's opinions you have to filter yes\nas soon as you have another person in\nfront of you you have another person's\njudgments to filter and so now you can't\neven say what you truly think about\nsomething because you're constantly\nthinking what does that person think\nabout me and my beliefs and so\nunderstanding your beliefs in solitude\nallows you to be really clear about what\nyour values and beliefs are and and\nthat's what it's there for\nI think when people get into if we\nswitch to compatibility again the idea\nwe talked about the difference between\nconnection and chemistry but\ncompatibility is really interesting\nbecause a lot of people believe that\nrelationships should be hard and they\nrequire hard work and a lot of people\nbelieve relationships should be easy and\neverything should just flow where have\nyou kind of discovered your lens on that\nSpectrum so okay there's a there's a\ncouple ways to look at it I think that\nmost relationships and I'll even be more\nspecific most relations that involve\nconnection and true love are typically\nhard\nnot because relationships have to be\nhard but because most people have been\nhurt by something in their life are\nholding on to past traumas haven't\nresolved it once they meet this\nindividual that they feel so strongly\nabout it is scary this is where things\nget difficult it's the difficultness in\nhow do I handle this how do I manage\nthis you'll have people feel like\nthey're losing themselves but they're\nnot losing themselves their true self is\ncoming out and it's it's the self that's\nbeen hiding behind that wall they've\nbeen using for quote-unquote protection\nbut I always say the same module to\nprotect you the same as blocking your\nblessings so now they're being pulled\nfrom behind it it's it's makes them feel\nsome kind of way and again people start\nto mishandle things you also have\nsituations where people are getting bad\nadvice like I'm gonna give one example\num there's this uh book called The Game\nby Neil Strauss I don't know if you ever\nread that book yeah it was great Neil\nyou know you you answer that world to\npick up artistry we learned it and he\nwas great with the women but then once\nhe found that woman that he fell in love\nwith all that stuff doesn't work anymore\nso you have a lot of men being taught\nhow to handle women in general but they\ndon't understand that's not how you\nhandle the woman you truly love and so\nnow again you have individuals who\nthough they are truly in love with this\nperson they constantly mishandle it with\nbad Guidance with fear and all these\nthings this is what makes it hard and\nand I even think that a lot of times the\npeople who are supposed to be together\nsometimes will have the hardest time\ngetting together but I believe that once\nwe're able to conquer that part of it\nand actually come together it's not hard\nyes it takes work I believe we have to\nbe conscious and mindful of how we treat\nour partners how we show up being\nwilling to listen but I think it's so\nmuch easier to do those things with\nsomeone you have a connection with and\nyou're truly in love with it's gonna\nalways feel ten times harder when you're\nin the wrong relationship and I would\nargue the vast majority of people are in\nthe wrong relationship that's why\nthey're seeing it be so difficult and\nwhen you see this whole it's easy\ntypically it's easy because you have two\npeople who are not digging deeper\nthey're they're trying to write out that\nchemistry we talked about earlier for as\nlong as possible all right so yeah it\nseems like it's great it's easy no\nissues but it doesn't really work like\nthat because they're just not facing the\nreality of the situation so I think we\nwe have to understand that there is\ngoing to be some bumps in the road\nbecause of all the things that people\nhave been through but once we're able to\ncome together and we know this is our\npartner this is who we want to share our\nlife with it can get so much better yeah\nand do you do you think that people have\njust been given generally the wrong\neducation on how to deal with another\nperson in their life 100 yeah because\nunfortunately a lot of individuals are\ngiving advice from a bit or hurt place\nthere and and they're trying to disguise\nit as I'm just looking out for you no\nyou you have inhaled and you cannot\nproperly guide them in a positive and\nloving Manner and I think that a lot of\npeople you know I always say it's funny\nhow we'll spend a lot of time getting\neducated for the for the sake of our\ncareers and business but we don't do the\nsame for relationships and yet\nrelationships arguably are even more\nimportant than that career business and\neven if it's not a romantic relationship\njust relationships in general your\nability to coexist with others connect\nwith others is extremely important if\nyou want that business to succeed you\nhave to learn how to establish business\nrelationships there's no way around it\nso we have to learn how to talk to\npeople listen to people you know what\nI'm saying and just make make things\nwork when we come together with other\nindividuals so I definitely think that\nwe're just lacking in a lot of education\nand again too many because there's so\nmany voices on the internet now there's\njust so much bad advice being given and\nand the individuals giving it they may\nbe giving like let's say\n80 of the advice is accurate but it's\nthat 20 that's completely off that can\nderail everything and that's the stuff\nthat people are gravitating to and this\nis causing a lot of problems can you\ngive us some example of some of the like\nnot specific people or anything like\nthat I just mean like could you give\nexample of bad advice and what about it\nis bad or unhealthy for people to try\nand put into practice okay so one thing\nI heard recently was an individual told\nuh said some of the best advice you can\ngive to men is to not fall in love\nyou know basically just find a woman you\nwant to be with and kind of keep it\nthere the reason why I view that as\nhorrible advice is because you sit down\nwith any man who's lived enough life\nthey will all be able to say there's\nbeen at least one time they fail deeply\nfor a woman all right the problem isn't\nfalling deep before a woman the problem\nis we don't know how to handle it once\nwe get there the problem is because\nwe're not accustomed to handling and\nprocessing our emotions a certain kind\nof way and being this vulnerable we\ndon't understand what's going to be\nrequired of us in that moment we also\nkind of lose sight of because I'm a big\nbeliever in masculine and feminine\nenergy and I believe that if she was\nattracted to you because of that\nmasculine energy that you give off and\nnow you become this emotional wreck\nbecause you don't know how to handle all\nthese feelings you have for her well you\nstart to become less attractive to her\nand it's not that it's not fixable it's\nfixable but again a lack of\nunderstanding and awareness derails the\nsituation so rather than telling men\ndon't fall in love because it's\ninevitable let's teach them how we walk\nin love how we make what I call Loving\nin your masculine how you maintain that\nenergy and still be able to pour into\nthat woman in a way that allows\nrelationship to flourish yeah and how\ndoes that work when I think obviously a\nlot of people in that example that\nyou're giving if if the person is\nattracted to someone because of their\nmasculine energy but at the same time\nthey want them to be empathetic and\ncompassionate and\nkind which are generally seen as more\nfeminine energy how does that person\nbalance the two or is that is that not\nhow you're explaining is that no it's\nabout balance so we have to understand\nwe all have masculine and feminine of\ncourse within us I'm a Believer in one\nmust be your dominant energy the other\nis the one you tap into when necessary\nso as a man you can walk in your\nmasculine and in those moments tap into\nthose things but you can't just stay\nthere all the time all right you can't\njust become this needy emotional God\nthat's not going to work in the vast\nmajority of cases and so what happens is\nthere's this messaging that's being\nthrown out there that women don't like\ngood guys I don't believe that's what it\nis I believe that women become less\nattracted when you don't know how to\nexude and walk in your masculine energy\nit's and and we're hiding behind the\nlabel of good guy you can be a good guy\nand still exude masculine energy and\nthat's the thing and we also think that\noh they like bad boys no if you look\ndeeper it's really the masculine energy\nthat that quote-unquote bad boy exudes\nbut what they desire is a mixture of\nboth the same way that we would want a\nmixture of both we would want a loving\nsweet woman family woman whatever or and\nif you're a guy who wants a mask and\nwoman cool but you don't want her to be\njust that you know you want her to have\nthe ability to tap into that other side\nwhen necessary I think we all desire\nthat balance in our partner and I think\nit's healthy and if we just learn how to\nmaintain it and how to nurture it we\nwould see greater success in\nrelationships yeah what are some of the\nskills with with mastering that energy\nthat you think we're missing out on and\nbalancing that energy and knowing when\nto be which and because the reason why\nit's hard is I think we live in a binary\nworld right like you feel like you have\nto choose like you're either a bad boy\nor you're a good girl you are a doer or\nyou're a thinker you're uh winner or\nyou're a loser right like we think like\nthat and some people go okay you need to\nbe masculine or I can be feminine and I\nI definitely\nrelate to what you were saying like I\nbelieve that there is a lot about me\nthat is massively masculine in energy\nusing that language and terminology my\ndrive my ambition how I work my\nstrategic mind and at the same time I\nconsider myself to have a lot of great\nfeminine energy and qualities where it\ncomes to like empowering others and\nnurturing and the ability to hold deep\ncompassionate space and be empathetic\nwhich are all powerful qualities for for\neveryone right Beyond gender they're\npowerful qualities\nand I appreciate and it's taken a long\ntime to know\nwhen to be which and it's still and I\nstill make mistakes right there's still\nsometimes like I should have been more\nassertive I should have been more\naffectionate so we live in a world that\nfinds it hard to hold two opposing ideas\nat the same time yeah we don't know how\nto do that in any sphere of life let\nalone within ourselves so what are some\nof the skills that we can learn in order\nto nurture both those energies in a\nhealthy way inside of ourselves so I\nthink one it's going to require a lot of\nif you're already in a relationship it's\ngoing to boil down to a lot of\ntransparency and communication you know\nher if you're that man trying to\nunderstand that woman and when you can\nwalk in those two energies her being\nwilling to be honest and open about you\nknow what this was too much over here or\nI needed some of this over here and in\ntime you're going to become more aware\nand understanding it's going to be like\nsecond nature to you you won't have to\noverthink it and I think part of it is\nnot overthinking it it's kind of like\nbeing ourselves but understanding that\nwe have to learn when this is doing too\nmuch and vice versa I also think that in\nreality for a lot of men especially uh\nwhen we're talking about relationships\nand kind of losing that masculine energy\nthe the underlying issue is fear\nall right when we become so afraid of\nlosing this woman we lose ourselves\nand so a lot of men now fall into this\nvery feminine needy space because\nthey're just afraid we have to learn\nthat listen like to me I feel if your\npartner thinks you're never gonna walk\naway from them no matter what they do\nyou've lost\nthat's that's a horrible place to be in\nwe have to get to a place where we both\nunderstand that as long as we show up\nthe way that we need to show up for each\nother we have each other's back we will\nbe here but neither of us will tolerate\nan unhealthy relationship and someone\nwho blatantly does not want to work on\nmaking this better I would want my the\nwoman I'm with to feel that way and I\nneed to feel that way once we understand\nthat and you have the confidence of I\ncan walk away if I have to that shifts\nyour energy right there in itself and\nnow you don't find yourself falling into\nthat place where again you start to look\na lot more unattractive or for some men\nthey become yes men in their\nrelationships thinking that makes her\nhappy that's turning her off she doesn't\nwant you to be her yes man she wants you\nto stand up for yourself sometimes give\nyour opinion give your perspective she\nwants to be able to you know if anything\nbe able to have discussions with you\nabout these things not just you say\nwhatever you want whatever you want\nwhatever you want over time it becomes a\nproblem so I think that once we conquer\nthat fear\nonce we create a space where we can talk\nabout these moments and not feel some\nkind of way I think sometimes men\nare not they struggle with taking the\ncriticism from their partner men and\nwomen we we all do when we feel when we\nhave actual feelings for someone you\nknow we don't care about you it's not as\nbig of a deal but we're emotionally\ninvested we're more sensitive to it but\nwe have to understand that these\ncriticisms are for the sake of making\nthings better and strengthening this\nrelationship so once we can get to that\nplace it's going to be so much easier to\ngrow in it and then I think it's just a\nmatter of understanding that it's this\nbalance isn't just for your relationship\nso look at it like from a sports\nperspective if I'm on a basketball team\nthere may be moments where I need to\ntake the lead and recognize all right\neveryone else is down someone needs to\nstep up this is my moment and then\nthere's other moments where I realize\nokay let's say we already have a team\ncaptain let me show them that I can\nfollow serve do what needs to be done so\nthat the team can win it's just becoming\naware of what the moment requires you\nknow and again I think the more in tune\nwe get the more in tune we get with\nourselves and the more in tune we get\nwith our partner the easier it becomes\nto find that balance that's the\nchallenge right the challenge is just\nhow much patience we have with ourselves\nand others to realize that you walked\ninto an imbalance unbalanced situation\nand now it's like how much patience how\nmuch time are we going to give it to get\nto that because the challenge is I think\nwe walk into a situation thinking it's\nperfect whereas we should be walking\ninto a relationship knowing it's\nimperfect absolutely and we're going to\nlearn and figure it out together\nand I think that's what sets us up for\nfailure is because we walk into it going\nit's perfect and deep down we know it\nisn't but somehow we gloss over it\nwhereas I find when I know we're gonna\nfight when I know we're gonna argue and\nI know there's going to be disagreements\nthat sets me up to develop the skills I\nneed in order to navigate those things\nyes but if I assume like oh we're never\ngonna fight and I always get that right\nwe always meet someone who goes to I\nmean a friend who goes to me Jay we\nnever fight I'm like how long have you\nbeen together because I don't I don't\nknow anyone who never fights I get that\nno one has to get to like yeah the\nheights of fights yeah I did that I did\nthat it doesn't have to be a heated\nfight but I don't know anyone who\ndoesn't disagree there you go all right\nright I think that's important for\npeople to understand yeah there's a\ndifference yes you have some individuals\nout there that'll say arguing is normal\nit's healthy and to me it's like listen\nif we're talking about arguing where\nwe're now Crossing disrespectful lines\nnegative lines you know the way that we\nthe tone we take with each other all\nthese things that's not healthy yes it\nmay happen you should be prepared for\nthat but it does let's not normalize it\njust gonna keep doing this and it's it\nis what it is but you're right to to be\nwith each other long enough and never\nhave a disagreement that's extremely\nrare okay extremely rare and I do think\nthat again as you mentioned we have to\nbe ready for those moments we have to\nunderstand and going back to how we find\nthat balance especially as men and even\nfor women it's recognizing so for\nexample if my partner is in a very\nheated moment let's say she's in her\nmasculine right now all right she's\ngetting rough well meeting her with more\nmasculine is probably going to only make\nthings worse yeah this is the time for\nme to be compassionate go to her hold\nher calm her down bring her peace in\nthat moment you see because it we need\nto balance each other out same thing on\nthe flip side if I'm all heated and I'm\nI'm extra passionate and then my woman\nnow comes with that same energy that's\nit now where button has this is her\nmoment to say no let me now be the one\nto soften the moment up bring that\nSweetness in there and everybody calms\ndown so it's learning how to feed off of\neach other and recognize okay they're\nover here let me bring it back over here\nand now we can work from that point and\nwe're both good the problem is that we\nall see compassion and sweetness and\nkindness in those moments as a weakness\nwe don't want to be that person because\nwe see that as losing we see that as\ngiving in we see that as us losing our\npower and strength in a relationship if\nwe become the comforter or if we become\nthe carer right like that's that's a\nperception that is the perception and we\nhave to change that that is the power\nposition so who is more powerful the\nperson that lets the energy dictate them\nhow they're going to react or the person\nthat brings the energy and dictates how\nthey're going to make this situation\nplay out\nso if I'm coming in to calm it down and\nbeing all sweet because I'm trying to\nbring peace here I'm in the power\nposition I'm not losing anything I'm\ngonna gain more peace and happiness and\nHarmony if I succeed in what I'm trying\nto do so we have to get out of that\nmindset of this makes us weaker and that\nis the big key of it that's a big\nproblem that for a lot of women who\nstruggle with their feminine energy\nthat's a big issue where they feel that\nbeing feminine is weakness it's what got\nthem taken advantage of and got them\nhurt but I always say it's not the\nfeminine energy that's the problem it's\nwho you give it to do they respect it\ndid they honor it you know it's the same\nthing as a man does she respect your\nmasculine if she doesn't then that might\njust be a sign you're with the wrong\nperson but don't stop being that guy\nbecause the woman who's best for you is\ngoing to need that in those moments that\nthat's exactly what it is is that when\npeople have been their best selves for\nthe wrong person\nthat person brings out the worst in them\nyes right like when someone's been their\nbest loving kindness self but someone\ntook advantage of it that person now\nthinks next time I've got to be\naggressive I've got to be you know\npowerful I've got to be strong in this\nway and I feel like that's kind of what\nmost people are dealing with we know\nthat is that you're just dealing with a\nwounded version of someone yes not a\nhealed version of someone\nbut I think people struggle to trust\nagain and again especially when they see\nthe same patterns in the person they're\nweird\nand I guess the question is why do we\nkeep making the same mistakes because I\nfeel like a lot of us keep dating the\nsame people yeah and there's a part of\nus that also just keeps closing off or\nbeing more wounded it's almost like if\nyou cut yourself you now walk around\nwith your hand over that you don't\nwant to get cut again and then if you\nlead it off and it gets cut even deeper\nnow you're even more conscious of that\nand so I find that people are doing that\nwhere they're closing their heart more\nand more because it's been so misused\nand abused and I understand that I\nunderstand people don't want to be\nabused and misused but I guess the\nquestion is how do people find people\nthat they know respect them so that they\ncan be their best version or be a better\nversion of themselves so you know you\ncan't drive out Darkness with more\nDarkness\nyou can't expose someone who's gonna\nhurt you by being someone who's closed\noff and holding back yourself\nwe have it's kind of what we were just\ntalking about we have to look at being\nvulnerable loving and open as not just\nwell I'm setting myself to be hurt no\nit's how you expose people faster if I\ncome with that energy and you cannot\nrespect it match it then I know you\ndon't belong here but if I hold back I\ngive you a free pass to hold back so now\nwe have two individuals who are hiding\nbehind their walls because it's\ncomfortable there but you can't really\nsee what's what do we really have in\nfront of us those walls are blinding you\nand you can't properly evaluate the\nsituation so one we we got to get to a\nplace of healing from our past so that\nwe're not just walking around with the\nhand over the cut no you you gotta let\nthe cup breathe you gotta let it heal\nall right holding on put your hand on\nthere is delaying the process and like\nyou said all that's gonna happen is when\nyou finally take your hand off but\nyou're taking it off with the wrong\nperson and you haven't learned see what\nI want people to realize is your actions\nweren't the problem meaning you being\nloving sweet kind compassionate wasn't\nthe problem it was the person\nseparate those two things that you don't\nstop doing the good things now granted\nare there levels to this to where we\nhave to learn again if I'm thinking\nabout a man if you got so deeply\nemotional to where you kind of lost your\nyour masculine energy and you became\nvery needy okay you can say all right I\nneed to continue to be loving but I know\nI have to learn how to draw a line I\nhave to learn how not to cross that\nmoment and again you only crossed it\nbecause you were unhealthy to begin with\nyou only cross it because you were\nafraid to begin with once you get to\nthat place where you're healthy and\nconfident you won't find yourself\nCrossing that line anymore yeah you\nwon't tolerate certain things anymore so\nwe have to heal we have to be confident\nand we have to let our light shine so\nthat we can expose what's in front of us\neasier that's a brilliant answer I I\nlove the differentiation between how\nsharing your light is not the problem\nthe person's the problem because\nwe yeah we start to doubt whether being\na good person a loving person is\nactually what wins in the world yeah and\nthe truth is that it does win but it has\nto win with someone who can receive it\nand absolutely hold that space with you\nand share that space with you\nand I find that a lot of people keep\ngiving that energy to the wrong person\nbecause we feel we can make them better\nright like there's this feeling of like\nI can change this person I can make them\nbetter I can heal them there's some of\nus want to fix people yeah and that\nmeans we assume the person we're with is\nbroken and I think this is such a\nsubconscious thing like if you're always\ncritiquing if you're always\npicking at stuff with your partner\nchances are you don't think they're\ngreat like just now you think there's\nsome issues with them when you think\nthat you can fix them and they're broken\ntell us about that angle where now we're\nalmost we've talked about being the\nloving and kind person but sometimes\nwe're being the person that\nthinks we're loving and kind because we\nwant to improve someone but that person\ndoesn't want to improve one big problem\nis that\nwhat's really driving people to pick\nthat individual is that by being the one\nthat can upgrade you improve you I have\nmore value here by having more value I\nhave a false sense of security you have\nto appreciate me you're less likely to\nwalk away you're less likely to cheat\nbecause you're lucky to have me I feel\nlike I'm the prize here\nbut those situations never really work\nbecause again you're choosing someone\nthat is not capable of pouring into you\nthe way you need you're basing this off\nof what you could do for them and that's\nnot sustainable and you're choosing them\nbecause again you have more emotional\ncontrol here what happens to so many\npeople especially women it's something\nthat I call the unhealthy love cycle of\nwomen where women in their first love\nexperience outside of any childhood\ntrauma may have experienced they're\ntheir most loving they're just out there\nthey go all the way in but that\ntypically happens at a younger age at an\nage where men are not mature enough to\nhandle those kind of emotions that level\nof commitment so on and so forth so she\ngets hurt after she gets hurt her moment\nis saying to herself I will never let\nthis happen to me again\nso now the woman starts to consciously\nor subconsciously choose men who are I\ndon't want to say lower than hurt but\nessentially a man who does not take her\nthere he's good enough to be with but\nI'm not that vulnerable with him he\ncan't hurt me like that first love hurt\nme and so that Dynamic usually leads to\npicking that person I can fix I can make\nbetter who will appreciate and respect\nme but again it doesn't work out and\nmany times you'll see these same\nsituations the guy will move on to cheat\non her not because and I have to say\nthis because some women think yeah he's\njust being a man no not because he's a\nman but because you chose a man that you\ncould never be the woman that he needed\nand he could never be the man that you\nneeded once he kind of either gets what\nhe needs from you to build himself up\nor the Smoke Clears from him being\ninfatuated with you he starts to realize\nI'm not getting everything that I desire\nand now you building him up has brought\nhim more attention from other women so\nnow the the difference between what\nyou're not giving him and what someone\nelse is willing to give him becomes way\nclearer now the Temptation gets way\nstronger and he ends up doing something\nor she ends up cheating as well because\nhe's safe but he doesn't fulfill her he\ndoesn't satisfy her he he doesn't excite\nher in any kind of way\nand that's why I always said earlier\nlike the safe choice is almost always\nthe wrong choice but that is a function\nof people trying to choose these fix or\nuppers because they think it's going to\ngive them some leverage there it's\nleverage that's it yeah it's leverage\nyeah how do you know when it's time to\ngo like how do you know when it's like I\nfeel like this is a common question\nwhere it's like how do you know when\nit's just I've tried everything we've\ntried together\ntried our best maybe we went to therapy\nmaybe we got a coach or maybe you know\nmaybe we didn't do those things how do I\njust know that I feel like I need to go\nbut I'm scared of being alone yeah I'm\nI'm scared of dealing with the reality\nthat I put in a lot of energy and I feel\nlike you said this earlier but a lot of\npeople stay in something for a lot\nlonger than they should because they'd\nrather not be alone yes they'd rather\nnot face reality they'd rather not lose\ntwo years of their life they'd rather\nlose two more thinking that this this\nshould stay like how do you know when\nit's time to go let me first say this\nyes I think I think Society needs to\nchange their thinking as far as\nLetting Go doesn't always mean it can't\nwork out later\nit's just that it cannot work out under\nthese circumstances all right because\nsome people say well I feel like they're\nthe one okay maybe they are but maybe\nthe time is not right and it's letting\ngo that will allow you both to do what\nneeds to be done in your own personal\nlives that would allow you to come back\ntogether and have something way more\namazing so that's number one thing to\nconsider but outside of that it's when\none if that person is unwilling to put\nin the work necessary it's time to go\nthere's like so many times I'll I'll\nhave a video go up about communication\nand someone will comment saying I've\ntried talking to him and he doesn't want\nto talk to me and in my head I'm like\nwhy are you still with them if he\nrefuses to talk to you you've already\ntried there's nothing else to do but\npeople will let it Linger on and\ncontinue why they can why they\nconsistently complain or unhappy about\nthis specific issue it's not gonna\nmagically get better they're not gonna\njust change it just because all of a\nsudden they see oh it needs to change no\nif they're fighting it now they have no\nreason to change it and what people have\nto understand you know especially with\nthis whole trying to fix people up\nhealing and facing your traumas is one\nof the hardest things for people to do\nso if they already have you in their\nlife\nthey're essentially getting the\nincentive or the benefit of relationship\nwithout having to do the deeper work\nit's almost like if I'm at a job and the\njob says you need to have a master's\ndegree to work here but we're going to\nhire you anyway and give you time to get\nthat master's degree if getting that\ndegree is super hard to you you're gonna\ndrag that out as long as possible yeah\nyou may never get the degree until they\nfire you when they fire you and you\nrealize oh my gosh if I don't do this\nI'll never get this person back I'll\nnever get this opportunity back now they\nmight go and get it because it's very\ntough to walk down the path of the\nhealing process so if they're not\nwilling to work on it you guys have\nalready discussed it and I think that's\na big thing because there's a lot of\nrelationships that end and the couples\ndon't even know what the real issue was\nso the communication they'll say well we\ntalked about no you guys argued you guys\nlashed out there wasn't a clear\ncommunication as to what the problem was\nwhat is expected how do we go about this\nif you've done that and I believe one of\nthe most effective ways to do that is\nthrough a letter\nbecause I feel like verbal communication\nof deep issues and concerns they\ntypically don't go well you know people\nget distracted they forget what they\nwant to say the other person gets\ndefensive they're not they're listening\nto rebuttal not to understand but when\nthere's a letter involved it gives you\ntime to get everything out you can you\ncan evaluate your tone leave no stone\nunturned and now they have an\nopportunity to process it on their time\nto really take it in and then you guys\ncan come together and discuss the letter\nand now it's so much easier to stay on\npoint and get everything covered if\nwe've done that and they're still\nunwilling or there's still no progress\nIt's Time to Go yeah that's great that's\ngreat advice and I for me that's the\nbiggest one it's like you can't\nmake something last if only one person's\nworking on it you can't keep hoping and\nwaiting and wishing and and like you\nsaid that ending doesn't mean forever\nand often I found that two people need\nto grow individually to be able to grow\ncollectively and we're forcing growing\ntogether so hard but we need space to\ngrow and\nif you can't grow together chances are\nyou need to grow apart in order to see\nwhether you grow together again or grow\nfor someone else and all of those\noptions are okay but we put so much\npressure on people to grow together that\nthey grow apart yeah and actually if\nthey chose to grow apart and grow\nseparately they could come back together\nif they learn the lessons and I think\nthat's a mistake too though sometimes\npeople think I'm gonna go learn this\nlesson for this person I meet a lot of\npeople they're like okay they broke up\nwith me because I wasn't XYZ now I'm\ngonna go become XYZ to win them back\nyeah and I always find I'm just like\nwell no you should go become XYZ if you\nthink you were missing XYZ but not to\nwin them back because you don't know\nwhat they're gonna do what's your take\non people trying to win people back so I\n100 agree with you like if we're trying\nto learn or grow it needs to be for the\nbenefit of who we are and just whoever\nwe deal with so was almost like if I was\na bad Communicator in this relationship\nI shouldn't learn to better communicate\nfor that person I need to better\ncommunicate for whoever I'm going to be\nwith if you can't see it in that light\nthen maybe you're looking at the wrong\nthing my thing is this I think it all\ndepends on what the details of the\nsituation was what led to the breakup\nwhat were you overlooking what was\nmissing are these fixable issues because\na lot of people are trying to win back\nsomeone where the issues are not\nresolved so it's like what's the point\nof going back we're just going to go in\nthe same cycle all over again they're\nletting this idea of I miss them I don't\nwant to be without them blind them from\nthe fact that you two did not get along\nwell or you two don't want the same\nthings or YouTube just whatever it is\nmaybe there's a lack of sexual\nsatisfaction I don't know why I feel the\nneed to mention that but it happens a\nlot of times you have to stay focused on\nwhat led to the end and can this be\ncorrected if it can cool but as you\nmentioned listen correcting it does not\nguarantee you they're coming back\nand even if they will come back you\ndon't know when\nthey may need so you may have figured\nyourself out in six months they might\nneed a year\nand I would argue if you guys are truly\nmeant for each other and at the end of\nthe year you need a year too you're just\noverlooking some things and you're\nrushing the process because you want to\nget back to them yeah it's I've never\nfound a situation where it was truly\nonly one person who had problems and the\nother person was squeaky clean no no you\nthought you were but you got some stuff\ntoo you needed to correct of course so I\nthink we have to be honest with\nourselves and just keep striving to be\nbetter and rather than focus on winning\nthem back\njust become the best you because if you\ndo and there's a true connection there\nthe opportunity will present itself\nagain and you too will be able to make\nsomething of it and the struggle is that\nwhen people finally make that decision\nto break up or let go\nthe study showed that the parts of your\nbrain that are activated in a breakup\nare the same as detoxing from cocaine\nright like you're literally trying to\ndetox so you can have a craving yeah for\nsomeone that's bad for you yeah or also\nit says that the areas of the brain that\nare activated in a breakup are the areas\nthat are the same with physical pain so\nif someone like punching the stomach the\nreason why we say like my heart feels\nbroken is because it literally feels\nlike something's broken yeah so when\nyou're going through a breakup when\nyou're feeling the craving to be with\nthat person again studies show that\neight over eighty percent of people are\nlooking at what their exes are doing on\nsocial media right probably through a\nFinster account or whatever but you have\nto you have to know what are some of the\nhealthiest tips that you've given to\npeople and the people that you've worked\nwith that have genuinely helped people\nmove through a breaker the first thing\nis to ask yourself again why was I even\nthere why am I holding on to this\nindividual again I think sometimes we\nget so blinded by just the experience or\nour desire to have this person for\nwhatever reason that we Overlook what\nwas really missing or why this could not\nwork anyway what you'll also find is and\nI'm sure there's probably a study on it\nwhere if you if they broke up with you\nyou ever see a situation it happens on\nTV a lot where the person could be like\nokay I'm gonna break up with my partner\nthey're planning on it they've been\npracticing in their head right it took\nthem a couple weeks to muster up the\nstrength they're about to do it and then\nthe partner breaks up with them yeah now\nit's oh my gosh I gotta get them back\nyeah so it's like you just forgot this\nwhole time that was your plan yeah it\njust gave you the past to do it but now\nbecause we don't like to be the one\nbeing let go of now we're fighting hard\nto get it back yeah so we have to really\nnot fall into these little traps that\nhappen to us as human beings our brains\njust playing tricks on us or something\nwhere we confuse these emotions for oh\nmy gosh I must really love them or even\nlike you said you go into that detox and\nbecause you miss I always tell people no\nmatter how bad the relationship was\nthere's always good moments so if you're\ntrying to break free you can't just let\nyour brain focus on the good moments you\nhave to remind yourself why this doesn't\nwork but if you keep focusing on the\ngood you start to make yourself think oh\nbecause I missed this good moment I must\nmiss them and there's this quote that\nsays sometimes you're not missing the\nperson you're missing the feeling\nso you've got to be able to\ndifferentiate those two things so\ngetting back to how we get over these\nbreakups is recognizing why were we\nreally there to begin with you know\ncould this actually work the next thing\nis you know I'm a huge believer that a\nlot of times a breakup is a blessing in\ndisguise even if there is a chance that\nyou two can work together or this is the\none for you you may have needed this\ntime to re-evaluate and get things in\norder something is obviously wrong even\nif you it may be something as deep as\nbecause I've seen situations where\neverything was going amazingly well on\nthe surface and the person broke up with\nthem let's say the woman lets go of the\nman so to the man that's really\nconfusing but what it was is that that\nwoman she had not healed from her past\nrelationships and this relationship\nbeing so good was scaring her and what\nhappens is the the better you are the\nscarier it becomes for her she's looking\nfor something to be wrong she has to\nvalidate her fear somehow wow when she\ncan't find it she'll either sabotage the\nrelationship or she'll run from it So to\nthat man it may seem like this is so\nunfair which yeah it sucks but if this\nwoman didn't break up with you now you\nwere inevitably gonna face this same\nending but at a worse time yeah all\nright this is still best that is\nhappening now at least if she can go do\nwhat she needs to do there's a chance\nfor this to come back around later but\nit's hard for us to see it in the moment\nso I think just really we also have to\nfocus on our healing whenever a breakup\nhappens the mistake we make is that we\nthink it's about healing from the\nbreakup no it's healing from everything\nyou've been through you've probably been\nsleeping under the rug your childhood\ntrauma for years maybe the last two\nthree relationships whatever it is so\nand and not healing from those things is\ncontributing to your struggle to get\npast this breakup and contributing to\nwhy you even chose this person to begin\nwith I'm a huge believer that if you\nhaven't healed you are 90 likely to\nchoose the wrong person yeah it's just\ntoo difficult to pick that person that\nyou truly love and can truly love you\nand accept that level of vulnerability\nwhen you have still not resolved your\npast traumas and past hurts yeah so to\nme that's the next big thing is just\nfocus on your healing process because in\nthat process you will also be able to\nsee more clearly if this is really for\nyou or not like walking around unhealed\nis like walking around with broken\nglasses you you can't see straight no\nmatter how hard you try but healing will\nclear up your vision really really fast\nand now it'd be like oh wait a minute I\ndidn't belong there yeah you know thank\nGod the broke breakup happened you know\nnow I'm in a better place I move forward\nso to me I think and I would say in\naddition to those things is just have an\naccountability partner whether that's\nfriend coach therapist someone that can\nhelp keep you in check help remind you\nwhat you need to do someone that you\nknow you have to talk to and update\nwhat's going on so you feel like okay I\ndon't want to come back so I'm saying\nI'm doing the same thing over and over\nagain it doesn't guarantee success but\nit helps it helps move the needle some\nso I would highly encourage that that\none mindset you spoke about that that\nchanges everything and it hit me today I\nwas just thinking\nif we were just able in a moment to\nrecognize that something painful now\nwas going to be good for us in five\nyears time that would change so many\nthings in our life yes but we're so poor\nat dealing with current pain yeah even\nif it means future joy that we just\ncan't accept that I have to go through\nthis like in everything right like\nknowing that someone breaking up with\nyou just saved you 10 years of a wasted\nlife\nis so much more than knowing you're\ngonna have to go through a few months of\npain and 10 months of pain maybe it's a\nbit longer maybe it's two three years\nbut\nwe just have to get our head around that\nthat sometimes the best things that\nhappen to you are protecting more of\nyour life than the pain that they're\ncausing you need the Peace of knowing I\ndid what I needed to do that's it yeah\nbecause anytime you feel like well maybe\nI could have done this but I could have\ndone that leaves the door open for doubt\ndo it well exactly so it's like and\nthat's why I'm such a big believer in\nyou know there's people who say well\nonce they're done they're done they'll\njust move on and I'm like no no Express\nYourself get everything off your chest\nbecause you don't need anything to\nlinger and you questioning well what if\nI did this different no make sure speak\nyour full piece and now you can say all\nright I did what I had to do it is what\nit is I move forward and I mean it makes\nit easier it may not make it a hundred\npercent you know not an issue whatsoever\nbut it's gonna be easier and also also\nfor me that's why like\nmy relationship with God is so important\nbecause that's where I find my peace in\ndealing with a situation that doesn't\nwork out the way I want to I always tell\nmyself okay if this isn't working out\nGod has something better for me you know\nif this is happening right now there's a\npurpose because I know if I followed his\nguidance throughout this process there's\nno need for me to question why is this\nthe current outcome there's a reason for\nthis and I've been through these things\nenough times to see as you mentioned the\nreward is going to come it may come next\nweek it may come years from now it will\ncome and I'll be able to see how it all\nconnected yeah Stefan it's been\nincredible talking to you man this has\nbeen such a great back-to-back flowing\nconversation uh we end every on purpose\nepisode with the final five which is\nlike a rapid fire which means every\nquestion has to be answered with one\nword to one sentence maximum okay so\nhere are your final five the first\nquestion is what's the best relationship\nadvice you've ever received or heard\nor given it is to love fully lovefully\nand be yourself because as I said\nearlier that's how you will expose\nquicker who is for you and who isn't for\nyou second question what is the worst\nrelationship advice you've ever heard or\nreceived get under someone to get over\nsomeone\n[Laughter]\nuh question number three uh how would\nyou define your current purpose in life\nis to serve the people and help heal\nhearts and help individuals experience\nhappier healthier relationships question\nnumber four what's something that you\nused to think was important in\nrelationships romantic relationships but\nyou no longer think is important I don't\nknow if I would say it's what I thought\nit was that important but I I do think I\ncan talk about it now is the woman's\nfinancial position\nwhere I think once upon a time I may\nhave put more weight on that when I was\na lot younger and really because that's\nwhat society and family told me was\nimportant but now to me and and I can\nsay it because I'm successful that\nfinancial position is not what's\nimportant to me it's the love it's the\nthe environment in the household all\nthese things I mean of course I want her\nto pursue her purpose and her passion\nbut what she has financially doesn't\nmove the needle at all got it all right\nand then Fifth and thank you for opening\nup and sharing that Fifth and final\nquestion if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be the one that's coming\nto mind is you must be honest if we\neliminated lying and deceit oh my God\nlike this world would be so much better\nyeah so just you have to tell the truth\nyeah that would be an amazing one yeah\nStefan it's been amazing speaking you\ntoday I hope you come back on the show\nmany times the book is out now it's\ncalled love after heartbreak I'm sure\neach and every one of
