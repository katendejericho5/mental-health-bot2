also can I call\nyou will of course yeah I just want to\nsay for everyone who's watching will\ntook a flight this morning from\nPittsburgh to New York City to be on the\nshow I appreciate him so much for doing\nthat I really really value that I love\nconnecting with people in person yeah\nI'm happy to be here yeah I and I can't\nwait to dive in that's good I was just\nsaying to you earlier that our community\nour audience here on purpose really\nloves learning and really loves getting\nreally practical applicable tools when\nit comes to their health uh I think one\nof the things that I by the way I love\nthe name of the new book like gut\nfeelings I think the gut has often been\nso ignored in the conversation yeah we\noften talk about how do you feel up here\nwhat's your head saying yeah and then we\nfeel about the heart versus the head and\nI feel like the gut was forgotten for so\nlong\nwhy is the gut so important in that\nconversation and why should it not be\nignored you're right and even I think\nwe've come a long way in the past 12\nyears since I've been in functional\nmedicine people growing awareness but\nwe're still scratching the surface I\nrealize I'm probably talking to more of\nthe health nerds and it's definitely not\nthe general population so we have a far\nway to go and our gut is a major part of\nour health but you don't necessarily\nhave to have extreme digestive symptoms\nto have underlying gut components to why\nyou feel the way that you do so your gut\nand brain are actually formed from the\nsame fetal tissue so when babies are\ngrowing in their mother's womb they're\nformed from that same fetal tissue and\nthey're inextricably linked for the rest\nof our lives through what's known as the\ngut brain Axis or the connection between\nthe gut and the Brain 95 of Serotonin\nare happy neurotransmitter it's made in\nthe gut stored in the gut fifty percent\nof dopamine is made in the gut stored in\nthe gut if you think about it the\nintestines kind of even resemble the\nbrain and the vagus nerve is what really\ninnervates and connects both the gut and\nthe Brain researchers call the gut the\nsecond brain we have to understand to\nunderstand so much of what ales modern\nsociety we have to understand gut health\nand it's no coincidence that most of\nprobably your listeners would know\nHippocrates the father of modern\nmedicine he said all disease begins in\nthe gut well if disease begins in the\ngut then so does healing begin in the\ngut and it's also home to 75 percent of\nthe immune system inflammation is a\nproduct of the immune system and you\nlook at the epidemic rise of autoimmune\nproblems and really inflammation is the\ncommonality between just about every\nhealth problem autoimmune issues\nmetabolic issues hormonal problems to re\nreally research looking at what's known\nas the cytokine model of cognitive\nfunction how inflammation impacts how\nour brains work so things like anxiety\nand depression fatigue all have the\nroots in not only inflammation but also\nthe gut brain connection so it is the\nfar-reaching implications of this is\nvast we have to understand it to deal\nwith it and what are some of the biggest\nmistakes we're making when it comes to\nour gut like what are the things that I\nthink you would say that we're just so\nunaware of or unsure about that are\ncausing gut challenges I think the\ninteresting thing about gut issues is\nthat when you figure out that you have\nsomething you're concerned about yeah\nand you start talking to your friend or\nsomeone you realize everyone has it but\nno one talks about it right right it's\nnot like one of those things that people\nshare very openly right but you start\nrecognizing wow everyone has digestive\nissues everyone's having some sort of\ninflammation everyone's having this kind\nof thing so what are some of the habits\ntraits that you think have kind of\nbecome widespread that is actually\ntaking us down this road that maybe\nwe're just not aware of enough I'm\nalways telling my patients is just\nbecause something's common doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's normal just\nbecause it's your everyday doesn't mean\nyou should settle for it and I really\ncan't tell you how many times when I'm\ntalking to somebody online and we're\ngoing through their systems of their\nbody and they have these aha moments of\nwhoa I thought that was just me I\nthought that was just my lot in life\nbecause I have it every day but I think\nthey need to we as a human race need to\ntake inventory and kind of get in our\nbodies or know that you teach about this\nso eloquently of just being aware and\nmindful of how our body works because it\nmaybe you're every day but it doesn't\nmean to be normalized so I mean we could\ntalk about digestion and you're right\npeople don't want to talk about it it's\nvery normal for me to talk about poop at\nmy office it's like and then I look\nacross the Telehealth across the the\ninternet and I realize it's not as\nnormal as I think it is I see their\npartner like uh we've never talked about\nthis before you know uh we get real real\nfast but it's important because it's a\nwindow into probably lots of other\nthings in your body but it's normal to\nhave one to two we say snakes a day as\nfar as bowel movements are concerned on\nthe Bristol chart many people go two\nthree days without a normal bowel\nmovement or it's always loose or always\nreally strained and like pebbles that's\nnot normal your bowel movements are a\nwindow into your overall health so we\nstart there but then we look at energy\nlevels throughout your day do you need\nlots of you know sugar and caffeine to\nget through the day that's not normal\nbut that's a lot of people's everyday\ncertainly uh do you have ravenous\nCravings of food do you have trouble\nlosing weight do you have hair loss do\nyou have skin problems these are all\nlike we call in functional medicine\nthese are like check engine lights check\nengine lights on but why the body's\ntelling us something we have to go\nupstream or get to the root cause of why\nyou have the problem in the first place\nyeah and I think for a lot of people it\nbecomes hard because I found for a long\ntime as well that as I became more aware\nof these things yeah and as I sort off\nto help\nit was really difficult to find good\npersonalized advice because you see\neveryone say well you have to drink this\none thing you have to do this one thing\nright it becomes this fad and\nsomething's helping some things don't\nand you don't know how they're all\ninterconnected and I feel like people\nget quite stuck and that's why I love\nbooks like yours and podcasts like yours\nbecause people can kind of follow along\nand go okay I'm dealing with this\nchallenge\num one of the things that I love that\nyou talked about was the process you\ncall shameflammation and I wanted to\ntalk about how can one begin to confront\nthat so she inflammation I\nyou know you know this as writing books\nand educating people and speaking you'll\nwake up in the middle of the night like\noh that's a good way of conveying what\nI'm trying to say because you see it\nplay out in people's lives all the time\nI see it on an hourly basis when I'm\nConsulting patients people that eat\nreally clean they are working out\nthey're doing all the wellness stuff\nthey go to erwan they they do all the\nthings you're supposed to do that's me\nby the way so I'm one of those people\nthat I'm like I eat cleaner than 99 of\nmy friends I work out I stay healthy I\ndon't drink alcohol I don't smoke like I\nhave a very clean life\nand I still had high forms of\ninformation I work with Mona Sharma\nidentity yeah Simone is my health card I\nlove her and so and my wife is my health\ncoach too she's been a dietitian and\nnutritionist and ayurvedic uh Health\npractitioner so my wife and Mona kind of\ntag team on my life you're a good hands\nI'm very fortunate but you know so yeah\nlet's talk about that because I'm\nactually that person I'm that person\nwho's I'm like guys I pretty much don't\nhave any bad habits yeah so that's why\nshamefulness yeah so that's 99 of my\npatients as well you're not alone is it\nyou have very erudite people that are\ntrying to do the best things that are\nprobably most of them better off than\nthey would be if they weren't doing\nthese things but there's these missing\npieces and what I explore with my\npatients and what I get to talk about in\ngut feelings is these missing\nphysiological and psychological missing\nlinks to what is keeping you stuck at\nthat Plateau what is keeping you back\nfrom leveling up how you want to feel so\nshameflammation is the is Convergence of\nthe mental emotional and the physical\nand really the conversation that I get\nto have with patients and I also get to\nhave in this book and gut feelings is\nthe fact that mental health is not\nseparate from physical health mental\nhealth is physical health and our brain\nis a part of our body just as much as\nanything else is and as I mentioned\nearlier the implications of the vagus\nnerve the gut brain axis and\ninflammation and its role in our health\nbut our thoughts and emotions on one end\nof that coin stress shame trauma even\nintergenerational trauma that esoteric\nnon-measurable stuff impacts the\nmeasurable meaning it will Spike\ninflammation levels it'll impact how\nyour Vegas new work when our neighbors\nvagus nerve Works it'll impact how your\nhormones are expressed so we have to\nlook at what I call for my patients\nshameflammation and what is our\nrelationship with food what is our\nrelationship with our body what is our\nrelationship ship with ourselves and\nstart shifting paradigms around how we\nlive life because you could you could be\ndoing amazing things for your health\neating good foods working out but if\nyou're going into it with such a sense\nof dread and Obsession and you know\nsomething that I say in the book is you\ncan't heal a body you hate you cannot\nshame your way into Health many people\ntry to and they're doing good things\nthat even makes sense on paper but\nthey're going into it with such a\nNegative sense of intention and yeah\nintention it's sabotaging it's producing\na completely opposite result so I want\nto bring good things but let's do it\nwith a good intention and that's what\nshameflammation that concept is all\nabout yeah understood what are some of\nthe quick things that if anyone's\nthinking I'm feeling inflammation what\nare some of the things in our physical\nlike things that we're consuming that\nare likely to cause inflammation yeah so\nthere's the physiological and the\npsychological again so the physiological\nlet's go on that side yes so that it\nstarts the foods that we eat I mean\nevery food we eat either feeds\ninflammation or or fights it there's\nthere's no neutral food there's no\nSwitzerland meal it's it's serving your\nphysiology it's doing something it's\nmaybe in incremental waste maybe in\nnegligible ways but it's some in very\nmajor ways so we have to take inventory\nof every food we eat other every meal is\nanother opportunity to bring\ninflammation up or bring inflammation\nlevels down so what I call the\ninflammatory core four are the four\nFoods or food ingredients that are most\nlikely to disrupt that gut microbiome\nall the trillions of bacteria in our gut\nthat that regulate our inflammation\nlevels regulate hormones regulate our\nbrain and neurotransmitters so that's\ngoing to be gluten containing grains\nwould be number one and I have a nuanced\nconversation about this there are better\nversions of gluten you can get Ancient\nGrains you can get sourdough bread to\nferments some of this a lot of the foods\nthat I'm going to be talking about here\nare what we've done to the food not\nnecessarily the food in and of itself\nbut for the sake of Simplicity gluten\ncontaining grains looking at that in\nyour life number two would be industrial\nseed oils things like soybean oil\nvegetable oil canola oil palm oil palm\noil exactly yeah I've just been taking\noff a lot of those because that was\nsomewhere where we hadn't got to yet so\nI'm off palm oil canola oil I can only\neat things in olive oil avocado oil at\nthe moment love it yeah thanks Mona yeah\nyeah yeah thanks for that conventional\nDairy I would say that and added sugar\nwhich is no surprise I'm short of people\nbut even the nice sounding euphemisms\nfor sugar you know that are hidden very\ncleverly on labels that they may be\nbetter for you options and I'm not\ndemonizing this entire sugar industry\nbut I'm saying look at the amount of\nadded grams of sugar you're consuming in\na day you may be surprised so decreasing\nthat and if I could make the core for a\nplus one I would add alcohol to that\nlist is people oftentimes they eat\ncleaner\nthey clean up their diet they know about\nthe inflammatory core4 but they keep in\nalcohol in their life as like oh that's\nmy one Vice but they are kept back their\nguts are still struggling their mental\nhealth is still struggling their energy\nlevels their weight loss resistance\nstill struggling so I would at least\nlook at alcohol as a role into these as\nwell because it's becoming quite\nnormalized within the wellness world\nspecifically and at the end of the day\nthere's no\nhealthy amount of alcohol there are\nbetter for you options certainly and I\nhave to be pragmatic but it's something\nthat I would take into consideration\nyeah I know that's great I mean that's\nso practical and I think everyone is\nlistening to that I think we've all\nheard about a friend I'm gluten-free too\nbut I've heard about friends being\ngluten-free and this and that and we\noften laugh about these things yeah but\nit's it's interesting to hear just how\nsimple it can be right these are not\nhuge changes none of these changes are\nlike hard to find necessarily these\nthings are becoming more and more common\nat least at a grocery store yeah and we\ncan start making healthier choices in a\nsimple way uh let's talk a big bit about\ngut microbiome because so I recently had\na surgery and I had to take uh Tramadol\nand a bunch of other stuff to like\npainkillers to try and deal with the\npain and and Mona was like all right\nwe're gonna have to start with your\nmicrobiome all over again after this is\nall over what is that relationship\nbetween\nuh painkillers and all of that with our\ngut microbiome as well like where's the\nconnection there well I mean your gut is\njust a major regulator of so many\ndifferent Pathways in the body so it is\nsuch a central role but when you're\ntaking either NSAIDs or antibiotics or\nother pain medications they could really\ndo a number on your gut uh they it can\nreally impact the gut lining as well as\nthe microbiome Metropolis this got\nGarden within within our\ngastrointestinal system so that doesn't\nmean we shouldn't be on those\nmedications when they're properly\nprescribed there's surgeries where you\nneed to be on things like that but just\nas Modena said what are we going to do\nafterwards what's sort of the long game\nhere to start supporting gut health\nagain because pragmatically those\nmedications just like certain foods and\neither everything we do in life\ninfluences this gut Garden so there's\nsome things that hurt it more than\nothers and especially people that are on\nmedication some medications long term\nspecifically antibiotics and some pain\npills as well they really can do\nquite good damage on the gut that we\nhave to work on rehabilitating over time\nyeah and so that's just something to be\nconscious of as well it's something to\nbe conscious of talk with your doctor\nabout because oftentimes there isn't a\nconversation about gut health when it's\nno take this see later but I would just\nwant to be empowered as a patient and be\ninformed as to your options and have\nChoice yeah and you've talked a bit\nabout how the connection between alcohol\nand intuition and I was intrigued by\nthat like what what have you seen as the\nconnection there that you well well I\nthink again as I mentioned earlier I\nthink alcohol people don't want to go\nthere right that's how they socialize\nthat's how they hang out with their\nfriends that's how they wind down they\nsay they deal with the background\nanxiousness and they don't really want\nto see how this drink can impact how\nthey feel and how they truly can know\nwhat their body loves when their body\ndoesn't love so alcohol can impact both\nyou your body on both the physiological\nand the psychological level it's going\nto impact your gut microbiome certainly\nwhat's it doing what's happening it can\ndo a few things it's going to disrupt\nthe microbiomes the microbiome is\ndepending on the study that you look at\nit's upwards of 100 trillion bacteria\nand we have about 10 trillion human\ncells so we are all about 10 times more\nbacteria than human and when we drink\nalcohol it is really especially people\nthat are consistently drinking it is\nquite disruptive to this microbiome\nbalance and it can breed things like\nbacterial overgrowth people a lot of the\ntimes people that I that I talk to they\nhave something called sibo small\nintestinal bacterial overgrowth and\nalcohol is a component certainly not the\nonly driver of that but it is a\ndisrupter and breeder of bacterial\novergrowth by messing up the balance the\nof this microbiome component and it also\ncan increase intestinal permeability or\na increase what they call leaky gut\nsyndrome it's uh when the things are\npassing through the gut that shouldn't\nbe able to pass through the gut like\nundigested food proteins bacterial\ntoxins called lipopolysaccharides and\nthen that's the seminal event that a lot\nof things when the immune system sees\nundigested food and bacterial toxins in\nthe bloodstream then there's something\ncalled molecular mimicry it's sort of\nthe the case of mistaken identity when\nthe immune system starts this Cascade of\ninflammation and that's what can trigger\nautoimmunity when the immune system\nloses recognition of self which I think\nthat's happening on a physical level but\nthen you think about what's happening on\na mental emotional spiritual level with\nso many people of losing recognition of\nself and we have this epidemic rise of\nautoimmune conditions 50 million\nAmericans at very least have an\nautoimmune disease Millions more are\nsomewhere on that autoimmune\ninflammation Spectrum so alcohol is\nimplication in that is it really is\nsomething that allows it can be a\ntrigger for a lot of people not only on\na mental emotional level we know but I\nthink people's relationship with alcohol\nexists on a spectrum\num and you may not be a full-blown\nalcoholic people need to look at\nthemselves and say how am I using this\ntool in my life and is it in alignment\nwith how I want to live my life is it in\nalignment with how I want to feel yeah\nthat's that's a great message to to get\npeople to reflect on yeah uh what that\nwas the physiological what are some of\nthe psychological things to be aware of\nyeah well I think the research around\nstress is very fascinating I mean we\nknow when your body is in a state of\nstress and look the stress is normal it\nis good in measured amounts what I'm\ntalking about here is chronic stress\nit's that\nI'm being chased by this Tiger but\nthere's no tiger many people are stuck\nin various degrees of sympathetic\nfight-or-flight stressed State and their\nbodies in overdrive all the time and we\nneed a balance we need the sympathetic\nnervous system just as much as we need\nthe parasympathetic the resting the\ndigesting mechanism but many people are\njust an over accentuation of a\nsympathetic nervous system response and\ncortisol levels coming up because their\nbody is in that fight or flight mode\ncortisol is not inherently bad just like\ninflammation is not inherently bad we\nneed inflammation to fight off viruses\nand bacteria and heal wounds but it's\nthe chronic inflammation that's a\nproblem same with chronic stress\ncortisol being high for too long is not\ngood that is cortisol by itself is an\nendogenous immunosuppressant which means\nit's a natural anti-inflammatory so\ninflammation comes up cortisol comes up\nto try to Abate and attenuate the higher\ninflammation levels and to help you to\nactually get you out of that stressed\nstate but it's just unsustainable\nbecause there's no real threat for many\npeople but they're not sleeping well\nthey are eating out of alignment with\nwhat's working for their body and they\nare I would say unhealthy relationships\nwith technology and all of this will be\nwhat researchers call an evolutionary\nmismatch there's a genetic epigenetic\nmismatch our genetics haven't changed in\n10 000 years but yeah our world has\nchanged very dramatically in a very\nfinite period of time when you're\nputting that into context with the\ntotality of human history so if our\ngenetics haven't changed in 10 000 years\njust think of how much how world has\nchanged in a few Generations whether\nit's the foods we eat or the foods we're\nnot eating our stress levels our\nexposure to toxins\nCollective and individual trauma all of\nthese things are the Confluence of\nfactors The Perfect Storm of variables\nthat are giving rise to these\ninflammatory autoimmune brain health\nmental health problems so the\npsychological side of how I see these\nstressors play out in people's lives is\nchronic stress but it's a lot more\nnebulous right it's a lot more\nInsidious because it's easy to say Don't\neat those four Foods because they're\ngoing to spike inflammation it's another\nthing to say well don't stress and then\nthey're stressing about not stressing so\nyeah you have to really like bring\ncontext and practical tools and what I\ncall them in the book is metaphysical\nmeals because you need to treat these\nacts of Stillness just like you would\nMeal Time yes which I know we're on the\nsame page here it's like you have to\njust like you show up for breakfast\nlunch and dinner and or you show up to\nthe gym you need to start feeding your\nhead in your heart just as much as you\nfeed your body and it's very much a part\nof healing and you have to deal with\nboth sides of the coin both the\nphysiological and the psychological so\nstress and whether that be bringing\nhealthy boundaries in or having a better\nrelationship with technology or\nprioritizing your asleep or bringing in\nself-care practices in your life that\nare nourishing to you that are feeding\nyou on a mental emotional level yeah\nthat's just one but there are you know\nmany levels to that but we have to look\nat both sides yeah no definitely thank\nyou so much for walking us through those\nand when if anyone's like me while I'm\nlistening to that whenever I sit down\nwith someone who's an X-Men this space\nI'm like there's a part of you that just\ngets more stressed because you go oh God\nI'm doing all the wrong things right\nlike and I'm sure people are listening\nor watching right at home or at work or\nif you're traveling and you're going of\ncourse I need to change so much and I\nthink that's kind of where our problems\nperpetuate because we go okay I need to\nchange everything and then we end up\nchanging nothing and I think that's\nalways the issue right when you feel you\nwant to change everything you end up\nchanging nothing and\nas people are listening to this like\nwhere's a good place for someone to\nstart like and I'm sure you you work\nwith so many people on this journey and\nI always say to people like I don't\nthink we have the real crisis we have in\nthe world today is a crisis of habits\nand conditioning because most people I\nknow know what they want to change or\nknow who they want to be or how they\nwant to change they just can't\nmake it through that path right they\ncan't stick with it so where's a good\nplace for someone to strive they're\nlistening right now and they're saying\nDr will call I can hear that I have a\nton of those physiological and\npsychological challenges I need to\nfigure this out where does someone stop\nI would first start with your headspace\nbecause it is\nyou do not have to be perfect quote\nunquote you don't have to have it all\ntogether to start making positive action\nin your life and if you're waiting for\nthe right time it's now because there's\nalways going to be some reason why we\nshould put it off because there's a\nvacation a holiday around the corner\nthere's a birthday party there's a\nwhatever holiday around the corner and\nthat is many people have that paralysis\nof analysis oh I'll start at the New\nYear oh I'll start at this date but the\nreality is I find that there's\nexceptions to that rule of maybe there's\na certain date within the next few weeks\nthat's bet that's practical for you but\nif you're looking at really putting it\nout in the calendar I very rarely see\npeople need to do that because I need\nyou to realize that how are we going to\nnavigate through those times because\nthere's always going to be something yes\nyeah and I would really what I say is\njust lean into it yeah you don't have to\nhave it all figure it out because what I\nfind is when you get the ball rolling\nand people get their head a little bit\nabove water\nthey want to keep doing the things that\nmake them feel good yeah and they start\nto realize what I call in the book and\nfor my patients I call it food piece and\nbody piece because I want people to\nnot come into this Wellness thing\nwhether improve their energy or improve\ntheir digestion or improve their brain\nhealth I want them to see this as a form\nof self-respect using self-care as a\nform of self-respect because it's the\nsort of toxic dieting culture that tells\nus well you can't have that there's a\nlot of Shame around that right that's\nlike very much breeding ground for\ninflammation\nthat's the antithesis of sustainable\nWellness the Genesis of sustainable\nWellness is really realizing that you\nget to do things that make you feel good\nyeah and I said recently on social media\nthat I think I think is the paradigm\nshift that I want to say here is that\nthe continually eating foods that don't\nlove you back is like staying in a toxic\nrelationship and wondering why you're\nstill miserable\nbut avoiding foods that don't love you\nback isn't restrictive it's self-respect\nand that's the if you want to talk about\nthe first thing it's having that pivotal\nparadigm shift to say look Oh I thought\nit was about all these things I can't\nhave\nno have whatever you want but I want\npeople to love feeling great more than\nthey thought they were going to miss\nsomething that dimmed their light\nso from that place of self-respect I\nfind people make better choices for\ntheir life because if they you know the\nanalogy that I use in the book is like\nif you realized you were a Lamborghini\nand not an old beat up jalopy how would\nthat impact how you fueled yourself\nowners of luxury Vehicles know how to\ntake care of their car they don't need\nto be taught that they're parking it way\nin the back they are cleaning it they're\nfueling it appropriately many people see\nthemselves as the old lemon and not the\nluxury car and that's the paradigm shift\nthat I want people to have because then\nall the rest falls into place they don't\nhave to be perfect because they just\nwant to continue to pick themselves up\nand they have their why is bigger than\ntheir excuses that is such a good point\nI'm so glad that you went there because\nthere were a few points that I just want\nto unpack for everyone the first was you\nsaid to start with the headspace and I\nthink that's really powerful and\neveryone who's listened on purpose right\nnow is already naturally doing that by\nbeing here is because if you're stressed\nyou eat badly and when you eat badly you\nget more stressed and you get inflamed\nand then everything else that you're\nsaying then you get more stress and it's\njust this never-ending cycle and so when\nyou figure out what's going on up here\nand then you can start changing what's\nhappening here it's it's a great way so\nI think that was a fantastic point the\nsecond thing that I really took away\nfrom that is this idea of self-respect\nand how we see ourselves\nand it took me a long time to recognize\nwhat that really meant personally so I\ngrew up addicted to chocolate I I ate\nand sugar obviously so I ate a chocolate\nbar a chocolate biscuit a chocolate\nyogurt and a chocolate ice cream pretty\nmuch every day while I was a kid up\nuntil when I went to University where I\nwould eat a chocolate bar and a like a\nliter of sprite every single day like\nthat got me through University and I was\nhealthy and I was lean and you know\nwhatever that meant and he thought I'm\nfine and then you start to see things\nnot catch up with you but you start to\nsee the impact of certain things and I\nthink people still have this in there\nwell I just want to have fun I just want\nto enjoy life and I don't have to think\nabout this and I think what's so\ninteresting is what you're saying is\nthat that actually isn't enjoyment\nbecause it's damaging and when you start\nrealizing that the fun you're having is\nactually not fun genuinely for what's\nhappening inside you just can't see that\nyeah and I think that took me a long\ntime to connect that it's not like\nstarving yourself from what you want\nit's actually like your body doesn't\nactually want that yeah which takes so\nlong to kind of fix our mind because\nwe're so conditioned to believe that oh\nI love pizza and I love this and I love\nthem it's like well you don't you've\njust been conditioned through your\ntastes like\nI always talk about one of my friends uh\ntheir kids look forward to blueberries\nand grapes as their reward because\nthat's how they've been brought up like\nfor them like blueberries are like Sour\nPatch Kids right right like that's their\nSour Patch Kid was for me it was Sour\nPatch Kids\nwhich are terrible for me and I still\nlove them and when I go to the theaters\nmy wife really has to like and so my\nwife was the one who helped me change my\nhabits when she met me she goes you\ncan't eat chocolate every day like you\ncan't have that she was like once a week\nyou can't have every day and and it took\nme ages and then and then we got there\nand then she replaced it with monk fruit\nand I used to eat these cacao nibs\nsweetened with monk for and now I've got\nto a point where if I'm if I'm at home\nI'm barely I don't remove refined sugars\nfrom my diet\nand it took a long process and now I\nfound actually when I go back and have\nan indulgent dessert it doesn't taste as\ngood to me and that was a huge Jennifer\nI was like oh wow it's not and sometimes\nI'll still crave like a burger a really\nlike juicy Friedberg and I'm plant-based\nso I'm talking about plant-based burgers\nand when I have it I'll actually not\nenjoy the feeling afterwards I'm like I\nactually didn't miss that at all yeah\nand so I don't know if that aligns with\nwhat you've been saying but I was just\ntrying to give a very genuine reflection\nof dealing with a lot of these vices\nmyself absolutely and I think a lot of\npeople can resonate with that and like\nthat's that repairing that gut feelings\nconnection that I'm talking about you\nknow the gut and the feelings there's\nthings that were changing on a\nphysiological level when you start\ncleaning up your diet eating nutrient\ndense foods regulating your blood sugar\nlowering inflammation levels supporting\nyour gut health\nand then also when you make that\nconnection you go back to those foods\nand you may not like them at all I hear\nthat many times for patients and they're\nshocked like these things that they\nloved things that they thought they\ncouldn't live without they could they\nsay I could take it or leave it yeah\nyeah that's food peace it's like that\nyou're not bound by that food if you\nwant to have it have it but I would just\nsay use all food as a mindfulness tool\nyeah eat it consciously did it love you\nback maybe it didn't love you back but\nyou love socializing with your friends\nor it brought you some enjoyment in the\nmoment and it was worth the payoff of\nmaybe the bloating or the inflammation\nthen eat it and move on shame is worse\nthan any food yeah but maybe you take it\nand eat it mindfully and realize\nafterwards no it actually wasn't worth\nit so maybe next time I'll have less of\nit or I won't have it at all because\nlike you said like cacao nibs and monk\nfruit there's so many better options\nthat taste really freaking amazing\nabsolutely yeah you don't have to eat\nlike a boring rabbit to be healthy\nabsolutely yeah I've been loving like\nthe who kitchen bars as well so good so\ngood like that's one of my the sad parts\nof New York City is Hugh kitchen closed\ndown I mean yeah remember that place\nyeah the pandemic took it out oh wow\ntheir bars yeah they're still alive and\nstrong with the chocolate bars yeah yeah\nthey're talking about it's great but\nyeah I feel like they're you're so right\nthat there are so many other\nAlternatives so many other places that\nthat you can discover new things and\neven spending time with friends like\nrecently I've been trying to and of\ncourse there's there's access here and\nthings that are in your city but I found\nlike like my wife she'll go to a workout\nclass with a lot of her friends and\nthat's like their way of socializing\ntogether or me and my wife will go to a\ncold plunge together or go find an\ninfrared sauna together or something\nlike that where even doing health and\nwellness with friends has actually\nbecome a fun way of socializing where it\nwas easier to be like oh let's just talk\nout for dinner which by the way I still\nlove to do and it's not that we don't do\nit but it's the idea of there are so\nmany alternative ways to spend time\ntogether where your friendship actually\nimproves too oh yeah because now you're\nnot just doing dinner in a movie every\ntime so yeah I I think there's I just\nthink the idea of experimenting is\nhealthy yeah whether you went to a cold\nlunch and enjoyed it or not that's up to\nyou but the idea that you went and tried\nsomething new with your friends yeah I\npromise you whatever you do trying\nsomething new with the people you love\nis going to be a Winnie the way yeah\nright absolutely and I think that that's\nuh key Point too when people want to\nstart making healthy choices they're\nafraid of it changing their what they do\nfor fun yeah or changing their\nrelationships like you mentioned alcohol\nwell everything I do with my friends is\ncentered around unhealthy food and\nalcohol what's that going to look like\nlook if they're your true friends\nthey're going to be there for you and\nI've seen so many people start bringing\nthe healthy food to the party and really\nbeing a light it's my wife how are you\nbasically describing my life and people\nare like wait what this is healthy what\nthe heck because it it really shifts\nhearts and Minds around this or maybe\nyou go to the cold plunge and they never\nthey thought it was weird at first yeah\nright now they all want to do it people\nwant to feel good it's just just because\nit's been done over and over again\ndoesn't mean you have to keep doing it\nlike start leveling up and be the leader\nfor your friend group yeah because it\nreally everyone thanked you in the long\nterm it for sure for sure and I've seen\nwhole family and friend groups change\nbecause of one person deciding I want to\nlive a different way I want to start\ndoing things that love me back yeah\ntrust me in the beginning my male ego\nwith my wife telling me like my wife\nwould see me like grab a chocolate by\nputting my mouth just give me the look\nand everyone will be like Jay you are\nyou literally gonna let her do that I'm\nlike she's actually doing it for my own\ngood like I feel so much happier yeah\nsince I've let go you know of refined\nsugar like it's made such a big\ndifference in my life and I've still got\na long way to go I'm working on lots of\ndifferent things but yeah no I I love\nthat I wanted to ask you because I feel\nlike you're one of the few people\nactually talks about this connection\nhow are hormones the internal\ncommunication system for the body\nbecause I feel like hormones are not\ntalked about enough and there's not\nenough of a conversation about them but\nthat's been something you've been\nleading sure and that's part of the the\npsychological so sorry the physiological\nside of things that the psychological\nimpact so hormones are kind of akin to\nbiochemical emails and if you look at\nyour body as this sort of Corporation\nthe different systems of the body are\nnot always communicating appropriately\nthey're either communicating too much\nbecause the body's in that sympathetic\nnervous system overdrive whereas\ncortisol levels is being really secreted\nquite a bit you have we have What's\ncalled the hypothalamic pituitary\nadrenal axis so this is something that\nwe can quantify on with patients via\nlabs and see cortisol levels and\ncortisol circadian rhythm issues\ncortisol is too high when it should be\nlow it should be a nice s-shaped curve\nor it's always low or it's always high\nand it's that imbalance that breaking of\nthe Goldilocks principle it's\nhomeostasis it's you don't want hormones\ntoo high you don't want hormones too low\nbut you want them High when they should\nbe High when they should be low just\nlike our gut microbiome bacteria just\nlike inflammation levels it's all\nsubject to this law of the of Goldilocks\nprinciple so it's really\num hormones are a major influencer in\nhow we want to feel but both the\nphysiological and the psychological\nimpact how hormones are expressed so if\nsomebody has an unhealthy gut if they\nhave things like chronic infections I\ndeal a lot with people that have chronic\nlyme disease and people that have mold\ntoxicity uh quite often because they\nhave different genetic variants that\nmake them more sensitive to things like\nautoimmune problems so we can find and\nmeasure this on Labs higher levels of\nmold toxins Lyme bacteria different\nenvironmental toxins like glyphosate in\nthe body that's shifting their nervous\nsystem in that stress State as well\nthat's going to really impact hormones\ntremendously so that I could measure\nhormones on a hormonal test which I\nwould and you'll see cortisol levels all\noff you'll see typically estrogen\nprogesterone testosterone very low\nsometimes estrogen will be high with\nestrogen dominance but for the most part\nwhen you're in a sympathetic fight or\nflight stressed say most hormones will\nbe sluggish they'll be on the low end of\nnormal or really low but then if you\njust saw the hormones happening in a\nvacuum you'd think well it's a hormonal\nproblem well no there's a bigger context\nas to why the hormones were off in the\nfirst place so that's why context\nmatters when it comes to all these\ndifferent aspects of Health but\nsupporting hormones are certainly\nimperative when you're talking about\nsomebody's mood when you talk about\nsomebody's gut feelings hormones are\nthose biochemical emails so I have to\nmeasure them I have to optimize them\nthyroid is another major player too\nbecause many people\nthey're just getting basic thyroid Labs\nthey're not really getting complex\nthyroid Labs so we have to really look\nat the complexity of thyroid hormone\nmetabolism but is this something that\nlike\nat least and I'm asking is someone who\nwas born and raised in London obviously\nlike how much of this is accessible in\nthe United States or across the world\nlike\nhow do people ask for these Labs where\ndo they get them because I was one of\nthose people for years that got checkups\ndone and got my blood tests done and\nthings like that and they'd always be\nlike Jay you're fine and I was like but\nI don't feel fine like yeah I know\nsomething's going on and they'll be like\nno you maybe you're a bit stressed and\nI'm like yeah I'm sure I am but it's\nmore that like I can feel something and\nit took till I started working with\ndarshan at next health I don't know if\nyou know next Health I've heard of them\nyeah next out to the incredible facility\nin LA but again it's it's something that\nrequires like access and it's expensive\nand it's not you know it's not easy it's\nin La it's in Miami it's not something\nthat everyone can access and so I go\nwell how does someone get those tests\nand the same as me I was just told for\nages I was told oh maybe you're stressed\nyou know just just relax a little bit\nand I'm like no I don't feel right\nso how yeah how does someone get those\ntests how does someone get that detail I\nknow volume is a great source the gut\ntest that they send to your house and\nyou do the stool test but yeah how do\npeople get access to that yeah I think\nwe're living in a time where there's\nstill a massive Gap but to democratize\nthis where it should be but in the past\n12 plus years I've seen a lot improving\nthen and the reality is most of the\nthyroid labs and the hormonal tests\nactually are conventional tests meaning\nthey're mainstream tests that if you ask\nyour doctor your conventional pcpg they\nwill do it they have to do it they can\ndo it they can decline doing it but if\nyou have a decent relationship with your\ndoctor and if it's clinically\nappropriate they should be able to run\nthis panel even if it's slightly outside\nof what their routine Labs because look\nthe conventional model of care is\nlargely trained to diagnose the disease\nand match it with the medication so it's\nthe extra Labs the other labs that we\nrun in functional medicine is slightly\nSuperfluous to a conventional medicine\ndoctor because if it's not going to\nchange the treatment why would they run\nit the for example to use the thyroid as\nan example they just need a TSH a\nthyroid stimulating hormone and maybe a\nT4 to give the person that levothyroxine\nthat Synthroid that pharmaceutical\nthyroid replacement hormone okay so\nthat's all that they need so if we want\nto look at all the other conventional\nthyroid labs they are available but if\nthe end result's still going to be that\nmedication then why would they run it so\nI understand it from a model side of\nthings but these are conventional tests\nmost of the ones that I'm talking about\nare a very widely accessible and offset\nthrough insurance or completely covered\nby insurance they just have to be ran\nand coded appropriately and be\nclinically appropriate for you so full\nthyroid panel something called thyroid\nstimulating hormone like I mentioned T4\nbut then what we would add in functional\nmedicine is total T3 something called\nfree T3 free t for and then what are\ncalled thyroid antibodies the leading\ndrivers of low thyroid function in the\nwest are autoimmune in nature\nHashimoto's disease or autoimmune\nthyroiditis is the most common\nautoimmune disease as a whole let alone\nthe most common driver of low thyroid\nfunction so you have to run thyroid\nperoxidase and thyroglobulin to see\nbecause it's in that case it's not truly\na primary thyroid problem the thyroid\nproblem is because the immune system has\nlost recognition of self again and is\nattacking it so and Graves disease is\nthe other type of autoimmune thyroid\nproblem and then I have to run what's\ncalled reverse T3 which in states of\ninflammation your body can make these\nbasically thyroid break molecules that\nslow down thyroid function so the point\nbeing it's a lot more complex than just\na TSH and to make it more accessible and\nyou know I mean that's what we've done\nfor the past 12 years is try to make\nthis as democratized as it can be to\ndecentralize this so people can have\nagency over their health and be\nempowered with this information it's\ntheir body they have a right to know so\nwe have different Telehealth models to\nmake it accessible for people and\nthere's a lot of direct to Consumer labs\nto be honest with you even if you don't\nhave access to a functional medicine\ndoctor or if you don't want a functional\nmedicine doctor there are great Labs\nthere's one called inside tracker I have\nno connection to these Brands inside\ntracker and base are two that I'm I've\nhad them on my podcast before they are\nbrilliant and you don't need a doctor\nfor for it so you could just order it\nyourself I think it's just good to know\nright this is so useful because I think\nit's good to a know what to ask for what\nto look for I think as someone I\nconsider myself someone who's fairly\nuneducated uh as a recipient as a\npatient of these things yeah because\nuntil you study yourself I would say\nuntil I started studying myself and\nreading myself and interviewing people\nthat I wanted to learn from I had a very\nlimited understanding because that's how\nI grew up and so I think for me at least\nI find it very interesting to be like\nokay well these are the tests I need to\nask for these are the tests I can do\nbecause even the other thing I want to\nask you is what are the most missed\nhealthy food intolerances because that's\na whole nother thing that I think we're\nnot aware of so the the inflammatory\ncore4 that I mentioned that's an obvious\none but I wouldn't even call those\nhealthy foods right I mean most of them\nare really processed refined boxed foods\nbut I would say the healthy food\nsensitivities or food intolerance is the\nfood reactions and this is really\npertinent to most of the people that I\ntalk to because they are eating better\nthan most people but they're still\nstruggling so the number one and let me\nbring a caveat to all of these Foods\nit's not necessarily these Foods fault\nthe heart of what I do in functional\nmedicine is bio-individuality and even\nhealthy foods what works for one person\nmay not be right for you and I would say\nalso what serves you today and what your\nbody loves now\nif we're actually fixing the problem of\nwhy you had the problem in the first\ncase then over time you'll be able to do\nmore things so I'm going to say these\nfoods with that preface because don't be\nfearful of these Foods don't become\northorexic but just a massive problem\nwithin Wellness that's orthorexia sort\nof disordered eating around healthy\nfoods that is not what I'm trying to\nconvey here so that's important to know\nbut also for the people that are\nstruggling with these issues it could be\na massive game changer for them because\nthey may be thinking oh I've been doing\nwhat I thought was healthy but I was\nunintentionally sabotaging my health so\nnumber one people that have sibo small\nintestinal bacterial overgrowth that I\nmentioned it's linked to things like\nanxiety and depression it's linked with\nother autoimmune problems it's also the\nleading cause of things like IBS\nirritable bowel syndrome it's linked to\nbloating like uncomfortable bloating\npeople will tell me they feel like\nthey're nine months pregnant even though\nthey're not pregnant as far as\nuncomfortable bloating and things like\nacid reflux and GERD so there are\nthere's a class of foods that are known\nas higher FODMAP Foods fodmaps is an\nacronym that stands for uh fermentable\noligosaccharides disaccharides\nmonosaccharides and polyolys which is\njust a verbose way of saying fermentable\nsugars so things like onions and garlic\nreally healthy foods right cruciferous\nvegetables like broccoli uh asparagus\nbrussels sprouts really healthy foods\nbut they're all higher in these\nfermentable sugars so people that are\nthinking they're doing the good things\nwith sibo I've done that for so long\nyeah\nonions and garlic and they're getting so\nbloated they're getting so much\ngastrointestinal upset so look is the\nproblem\nyou get to heal the sibo so you can\nbring those high fodmaps in yes so\nfodmaps would be a lot for our people\nthat are probably a lot of our listeners\nright now it's just people that are very\nwell read but they're still struggling\nwith these problems they're eating\nhealthier but they're still struggling\nso look at higher fodmaps and\npotentially look at sibo as the driver\nof that FODMAP intolerance and then I\nmentioning a lot of uh people that have\nmold toxicity mycotoxins is what they're\ncalled higher mold foods can perpetuate\nflare-ups too so a lot of grains even\nyou know healthy grains like gluten can\nbeam and gluten-free grains can be\nhigher in mold coffee can be hiring mode\nwine other alcohols can be higher in\nmold and people that have a sensitized\nimmune system should look if they have a\nmold problem look at foods that could\npotentially contain mold and then\nanother one that I see are higher\nhistamines foods that are higher\nhistamines or histamine liberators or\nhistamine releasing foods can definitely\nbe problematic for people that have sibo\nthese gastrointestinal gut problems and\npeople that have I mean there's other\nsymptoms of histamine intolerance like\nanxiety because your gut and brain this\ngut feelings connection again here\npeople that have lots of Kombucha people\nthat have lots of bone broth people have\nlots of fermented pickled foods even\navocados can be higher in histamines\nso these are the gray areas that we need\nto look at because that's why you need\nto diagnose yourself effectively because\nyeah and or if you're doing all the\nthings and still struggling these are\nthe areas you need to look at to say\nwhat are these check engine lights in my\nlife why is my body reacting to kombucha\nit's not kombucha's fault but is it the\nbody telling me that this is releasing\nhistamines right now and then I have to\nask the question why do I have histamine\nintolerance in the first place which\nunsolved trauma can be part of that sibo\nmold toxins can be a part of that\nchronic lyme the psychological and the\nphysiological so this is what I see\nsadly play out in people's lives but\nit's only sad until you find out and\ngive it when you give them answers then\nit's anything but sad because then it\nsays aha Mona like wow I can do\nsomething about it I mean that's exactly\nhow I feel like everything you'd be\ntalking about like this is the journey\nI've been on because it's it's that\nfeeling of I feel healthy to that\nfeeling of recognizing wow there's so\nmuch about health that I did not\nunderstand\nthen getting accurate tests that\nactually tell you what's going on\nbecause I think there's a lot of like oh\nyou just need a bit of this so you need\na bit of that and that doesn't work like\nthe accurate testing is such an\nimportant part of this because then the\nrecommendations can be healthier yeah I\nthink a lot of recommendations are just\nbased on basic symptoms and that doesn't\nnecessarily always go the right way and\nthen of course consistency in the\nrecommendation that feels like the the\nfull Journey absolutely and I think look\nif what you're doing is working for you\nand you feel great don't look for\nproblems where there isn't any of course\nbut I think we have an epidemic rise of\npeople that are doing all the things\nthat are really compliant people that\nare doing things that doctors are\ntelling them to do but they're still\nspinning their wheels that's what I'm\ntalking about here we have to do better\nhere so I think that these These are\nwhat I find clinically to be missing\nlinks for people then they fix a few\nthings and it really kind of allows\ntheir body to take their health to the\nnext level and and start feeling the way\nthey want to feel and when you start\nrepairing these things whether it's\nrepairing their gut health or regulating\ntheir nervous system or whatever we're\ntalking about here all of those Foods I\njust made mentioned almost all of them\ncan be reintroduced so temporarily maybe\navoid them but longer term let's fix the\nproblem that drove it in the first place\nyeah everyone make sure that you grab\nthe book gut feelings and subscribe to\nthe art of being well podcast uh by will\nuh Dr Wilco I was just wanted to ask you\nis there anything that you haven't\nshared on today or something that is on\nyour heart your mind or in your gut that\nyou feel like you need to you need to\nshare that we haven't touched a point no\nman I really appreciate the opportunity\nit's been great we'll have to have you\non the art of being well I'd love to I'd\nlove to but no this has been so useful\nbecause I think you've given us a very\n360 degree approach of so many different\naspects of our health of course everyone\ncan read the book got feelings to go in\ndepth on all of this and listen to the\npodcast to understand more about\neverything we've discussed today and I\nhope this is the first of many times\nwe'll sit down and get to do this but\nthank you so much we end every episode\nwith a final five which are the fast\nfive rounds so you have to answer these\nin one word or one sentence or maximum\nso you can do one sentence all right one\nword in one sentence kind of nervous\nlet's go let's go for it okay uh\nquestion number one what's the best\nhealth advice you've ever received or\nheard it's what I actually said earlier\nit's one that I always telling myself\nand I'm telling my patients is you can't\nheal a body you hate it's a pointer to\nwork that we need to do as reframing our\nrelationship with our body and with food\nand with Wellness itself love that\nquestion number two what's the worst\npiece of Health advice you've ever heard\nor received well the antithesis of that\nthat somehow you're going to shame your\nway into wellness it's not going to work\nyeah okay uh question number three\nsomething you used to value for your\nhealth but you don't anymore probably\ntaking tons of supplements\nI have a simplified version I know what\nI feel the best on\num so I to me food is first supplements\nare a great bonus targeted 100 but food\nis primary so I think streamlining and\nfiguring what are the biggest needle\nmovers for myself is definitely that for\nme that's a great answer uh question\nnumber four what's your current purpose\nin life\nit's hopefully being a light for God and\nit is and what that means for me is just\nhopefully\nstaying in my Lane in the best of ways\nand just enabling me to bring hope to\npeople that are really struggling with\nsilent health problems and I get to see\nit play out all the time this is more\nthan a sentence but yeah I love what\nthey get to do that's beautiful uh Fifth\nand final question if you could create\none law that everyone in the world had\nto follow what would it be\nkind\nand think before you speak\na health law have any health nurse that\nwill help people as social diseases\nright a social relationship disorders\nbring about physical disorders too but\nif you want something a little bit more\non a micro level I would say\nAllah you said Allah to to people should\nlive by\nuh I would say use food eat foods that\nlove you back and find out what they are\nbe curious about what they are because\nwhen you focus on that the rest of the\nstuff kind of is put into perspective\nyeah I love that Dr will call everyone\nthe book is called gut feelings the\npodcast is called the art of being well\nuh Dr will call on Instagram as well\nmake sure you follow him everyone who's\nbeen watching or listening make sure\nthat you tag me and Dr willcole on\nInstagram on tick tock on Twitter let us\nknow what resonated with you what you're\ngoing to try what you're going to try\nand shift remember you don't have to\nchange everything all at once she's\ngoing to try to put one thing into\npractice and watch how your life changes\nuh thank you so much for being here so\ngrateful for you and I love this\nconversation likewise if you love this\nepisode you'll enjoy my interview with\nDr Daniel Layman on how to change your\nlife by changing your brain"
