    "transcript": "we're so scared of imperfection because\nit reveals there's parts of us\nthat are not ideal by some external\ncomparison or by some\ninternal Trigger or some past experience\nwhere we we have that feeling how do you\nnow deal with your imperfections like\nhow do you feel about\nparts of you that that are not perfect\nI'm okay with that I actually think a\nlot of who I am are\njust a few things that are not perfect\neven down to my laugh sometimes I used\nto be insecure about my laugh or you\nknow the fact that I'll always talk\nduring the movie or you know I always do\nsomething minuscule and I think little\nthings like that\nmake me happy because\nI feel like everybody else in the world\ndata recent for example a very small\nexample but if it's Halloween I was a\nbanana and I and I and I genuinely just\nlike got the cheapest outfit put it on\nand roam around Times Square with my\nfriends and have the best time and\neveryone kept sending me these memes\nbecause every everybody else kind of\nwent all out and maybe I could have\npainted my face and done a little more\nbut everyone looked really sexy and fun\nand and literally I was a banana\nthat's basically sums up who I am\num to a T and it was um that to me means\nthat I don't have to be perfect all the\ntime I'd rather be that girl yeah and\nhow does that apply to work like how\ndoes that perfectionist mindset work in\nterms of like music or creation or\nacting like because that's beautiful in\nyour personal life it sounds like\nthere's this acceptance of you know we\ncan be yeah we can be more in flow but\nthen how does that apply to like writing\nor creating or building like well I\nthink how I I don't I I well I always\nsay this in any session there are no\nstupid questions I always have to say\nthat out loud because sometimes I\ngenuinely will think well what does this\nmean and how can I unpack this and\ncreate a um a song from this or how do I\nunpack this scene and do the best I can\nyou know there are mistakes that happen\nin the studio and on set that actually\nend up becoming a part of it you know me\nmessing up a line actually ended up\nbeing funny and we kept it in the show\nor you know there's something I said in\na lyric that was wrong and it ends up\nbeing the biggest hook that we've got\nand I and I look for those moments yeah\nI crave I crave those moments that's a\ngreat example I love all the yeah and it\njust that's what feels like magic right\nlike it's it's when the imperfection can\nsomehow become a part of the process\nwhere you're just like wow this this\nactually feels like we got something and\nso I think when we start I love that\nidea applied both personally and\nprofessionally because\nI think even the parts of ourselves that\nwe consider to be imperfect the parts of\nourselves that we consider to be broken\nwhen you start seeing use in those when\nyou start seeing purpose in those it's I\nalways say that there's there's blessing\nin the breaking\nand every moment that you encounter in\nyour life even if it's just road rage\nit's as simple as that to maybe losing\nsomeone that you love\nthere there is no perfect way to heal\nthere's no perfect way of dealing with\nsomething it's more just\nhow am I going to be a better person how\nam I going to make the best choice for\nmyself so that I don't end up angry at\nthat person on the highway so that I\ndon't end up ruining my day because of\nwhat someone did to me on the 405. you\nknow I I want to also say that how can I\nturn something like losing someone I so\ndearly love into well how can I\ncelebrate that person and the great\nthings that they're that they provided\nme or that they gave me that takes a lot\nof work so I don't say that lightly but\nI try my hardest to do that and I try to\nhave my friends hold me accountable to\nreminding me hey let's try to flip this\nand try to turn it into something else\nyeah yeah absolutely I think\nwhat I'm gathering from listening to you\nis that again it's you're not saying\nI've arrived and this is how I think now\nyou're saying this is what I'm trying to\npractice like this is the this is the\napproach that I'm mining in my own life\nand absolutely this is my practice every\nday is practice I I even said it last\nnight at the premiere I was saying I\ndon't I don't have anything figured out\nI'm definitely not like I'm sold I'm\ngood it's it's more just\nthis is a continuation yeah my story is\nnot done and I can't wait to find out\nwhat's gonna happen next and doesn't\nmean it's going to be easy and sure\nthere's going to be bumps that happen\nbut I'm gonna learn how to live with\nthem yeah as someone who's so committed\nto moving forward what did it feel like\ngoing back to like your school and and\nall these old places I won't give away\ntoo many but in the documentary you go\nand visit\nyeah what does that do well going home\nis is like to me it's it's untainted\nterritory right it is safe it is simple\nand kind where I'm from it is all about\nyou know being together loving each\nother I go home and people are like\nwelcome home miss Gomez they're not you\nknow treating me any differently and I\nenjoy and I enjoy visiting you know what\nmade me who I am and it always gives me\na good sense of of like oh I hope I can\ninspire people from where I'm from\nbecause there's not a lot to do where\nI'm from but I hope I can Inspire just\none person to do something bigger than\nthat yeah was there any particular place\nthat you went back that almost gave you\na a special feeling or something\nsurprise you that you're like oh I\ndidn't think this was going to be well\nmy snow cone place I really I loved that\nplace I would go with my dad all the\ntime and my cousin and we would get the\npickle snow cones with like you know\ngrape in it and it would just be so\nyummy and amazing and it just you know\nbrought me back to when it would be so\nhot in Texas and I was with my family\nand we would just stop there and sit\noutside for an hour and just talk and it\nwas just the best yeah I love that yeah\nthat's that's that's great to hear I\nthink there's always I I have this park\nin my hometown it's called Broomfield\nPark and it's it's still Charming to me\neven though I don't think if anyone else\nwent\nthere'd be like I know but when I go\nback I know where I used to go and buy\nmy my ice cream from and you know where\nthe truck would be in this there's all\nthese special moments that you\nthat almost but it sounds like again\nlike it sounds like it's not like you're\nlike oh I missed that it's almost like\nthat was a part of me and it's a\nbeautiful thing but now I'm happy to be\nnew and even today when we were just\nwalking over here and we were talking\nabout just you finding places that fuel\nyou yeah uh and you it seems like you've\nbecome open to saying okay it's okay\nthat life is changing and transitioning\nyeah and there's new places that feel\nmore like home than old places I hate\nchange I really do but I felt in the\npast year\nwhich is pretty just it's pretty new\nyeah I have really really embraced\non the uncomfortableness of change and I\nthink it's because I get so exhausted of\nthe same thing over and over again and\nit scares me but I did learn that my\nworld can be bigger\num by being in a different destination I\nwork\num on my show only murders in the\nbuilding it's in New York where I shoot\nand I never I've never spent more than a\nweek or two in New York and I'm there\nfor months and just that alone was an\nuncomfortable you know experience but I\nloved it and I loved the friendships I\nmade and the knowledge that I was\ngaining the people I was around the park\nand walking and just how like Precious\nlife is it's\ncelebrated there's culture it just\nbecomes addicting to to want to put\nyourself in these situations and see\nwhat happens so I will say in the past\nyear I've felt more comfortable with\nchange and I'm grateful for it and I\njust I'm going to continue to do that\nand I want that how did you get\ncomfortable with that discomfort I guess\nin the first place if you're someone who\nsaid you know like hey it changed didn't\nlike change yeah like what I guess\nobviously naturally work and everything\nlike that but yeah was there something\ninternally were you like okay now I need\nbecause you've done this you've done\nuncomfortable things your whole life\nright yeah definitely like you've had to\ndo so many difficult things whether it's\ngoing on tour when you're young or yeah\ntransitioning careers you've constantly\ndone uncomfortable things yeah but I\nthink I had always kind of returned to\nthe same behavior and the same pattern\nof maybe well I'm nervous of going out\nbecause I don't want to be seen today or\nI'm gonna just stay in because I feel\nanxious or I don't want to go out to\nthat event because I don't want to get\nseen I just I was I was finding myself\njust being terrified of the world and\nthat just isn't a way of living and it's\neasy to go do a job because well I I'm\nwith a bunch of people they help me look\ngood I do my job I smile and I'm done\nbut taking spontaneous trips or you know\ngetting out and going to the Balboa Park\nwhich is a very simple Park just doing\nthat kind of stuff is necessary and I I\nnoticed that New York really helped me\nit just really opened me up the show is\nreally great and I think\nbeing around a bunch of New Yorkers it\ndoes something to you man it's good yeah\nwell one of the biggest changes in\natmosphere that you talk about the\ndocumentary is you go to Africa right\nand that's like a that's a big change\ndefinitely you know even if it's a\nshorter period of time but you were\nstill there for uh you're there for a\nweek yes but I mean that definitely\nwasn't the first time that I had taken\ntrips\num in in the in the vein of wanting to\ngo for a mission and it was one of the\nmost beautiful moments of the film for\nme because\nwe actually thought we were just going\nto make a quick little video about you\nknow what we were there to do and then\nwe fell in love with the people we fell\nin love with the story and we started\nnoticing\nthat everywhere in the world mental\nhealth is\nvery very real it's very much\nsomething that's\naffecting everyone\num and then you kind of realize that the\nworld is\nit's a small place sometimes because\nyou're all kind of walking through pain\nand you're all looking at things in a\ndifferent way but ultimately you all\nwant to be happy and\noh I felt like they inspired me more\nthan I could have done anything for them\nit was a really beautiful trip and yeah\nit was one of my favorite moments of the\nfilm people don't always understand how\nmental health exists ever in the world\nwhen you said that they're also\nexperiencing mental health what was\ntheir experience of it compared to what\nwe would understand as our experience in\nthe US so yeah well I was I was talking\nto a woman named Betty and she was you\nknow basically kind of the person\ntouring or giving us the tour around the\nvillage and the schools and she was\nlovely but when we stopped to have a\nconversation we just were sitting down\nand she\nshe told me her story and how she was\ndealing with suicidal thoughts\nand then how she went to a lake and\nsat there for two weeks contemplating\nnot a day or an hour of moment it was\ntwo weeks\nand that was something that I felt\nfloored by because that's different\nobviously we can have those thoughts but\nshe dismissed herself from everyone and\nshe had to find it with herself when so\nmany people don't need to walk through\nthat alone but she did and she did it\nwell and she's proud of it and now she\nis in\nan incredible school and she's going to\ngrow up to be the best influence for her\nVillage for her sisters for everyone\nthat she's around that's so\nso special and I I'm just having those\nconversations with someone from across\nthe world it's mind-blowing you don't\nreally know what people are walking\nthrough until you do stop and have a\nconversation if you want even more\nvideos just like this one make sure you\nsubscribe and click on the boxes over\nhere I'm also excited to let you
