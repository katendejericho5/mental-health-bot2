    "transcript": "I think a lot of the time in\nrelationships you make someone feel\nbroken because you keep fixing them\nwhereas if you teach people how to heal\nthemselves then you've actually helped\nthem so I always tell people that loving\nsomeone means you make them fall more in\nlove with themselves yeah not more in\nlove with you the best-selling author\nand host the number one Health

this\nperson just like I just it's so hard to\nfind a spot in their schedule like no\nmatter how much you try like we've been\nworking with their team for the last two\nyears this guest hasn't come on the show\nfor the last two years we're talking\nabout the one and only my heart my wife\nRavi devluk here foreign\ntwo years it took to get you back I\ndidn't even realize it's been two years\nbut

number one Health\npodcast in the world sometimes it's hard\nto get you to walk from the house to the\nstudio I know I know it's like 10 steps\nalso\ncome on eight rules of Love where's the\njingle I know I need to come up with one\nI did have one for think like a monk\ndidn't I I know yeah do you remember to\nthink like a manga\nI think that no thanks yeah yeah no idea\nthank you anyway I'm gonna come up with\none for that okay yeah when it's gonna\nbe more of a wrap I feel like because\nwe've got a number in it but the book's\nalready out I know I know I know\nchanneling what if someone makes a\njingle book I need to read the book and\nthen I'll get inspiration from it oh\nyeah Riley doesn't read my book I'm\ngonna I actually finished things like\nwell nearly finished with things like a\nmonk I've taken a break from it it was\njust so good I need time to digest eight\nrules of love I'm gonna start on the\nplane Journey today\nand I say listening to the podcast\na month ago it's a brilliant podcast\neveryone who's listening you should\nlisten to all the other 300 episodes\nthat how many have you done uh four\nyears\n150 episodes no no four years 100\nepisodes a year so 400. oh my gosh I've\ngot so much to catch up on but it's\nreally good honestly thanks I appreciate\nit\nso we're actually recording this in a\nplace that's quite meaningful to Riley\nand I when we first started dating this\nwas a place that we'd come for walks uh\nfor tea for hanging out together it's\nthe Grove Hotel it's it's a beautiful\nbeautiful place I'm so grateful that\ntoday we're getting to record this\npodcast here I can't wait to go outside\nand take a walk here and enjoy the\ngrounds it's a really special place to\nus so excited to be here at the Grove\nyeah I love this place I love it but\nthis is going to be fun because as\nalways what we do when Rady's on the\nshow is we answer questions that my team\ncomes up with so my team will\nuh randomly find ideas and thoughts and\ntopics for us to talk about we have no\nidea we've never seen them and so you\ntruly get a genuine raw authentication I\nhave no idea what we're going to talk\nabout I mean rather we have no idea I\nwill be bringing up some stuff Riley's\nbeen working on in the background which\nI'm excited about uh but yeah all right\nso the first question uh Tim wants us to\nanswer is what was the first what would\nit what the so what our team wants us to\nstart with is what did we love each\nother so what did the the question that\nour team wants us to answer first is\nwhat did we love most about each other\nfirst what did we love what do we love\nmost about each other now what's changed\nwhat's different and why well said well\ndone you're getting this I should\nbasically be the host of the show she\nbasically have a podcast I should have a\npodcast\num okay so I feel like it's pretty much\nstill the same stuff that was from the\nbeginning you're very consistently the\nsame person in a really good way like\nyou're a solid human you really are like\nthe same why are you laughing\nyeah it's the same stuff same stuff but\nin like the best way because you have\nbeen consistently the same person you\nsaid you were the things that you would\nbe at the beginning of the relationship\nyou are still that person\nall the good stuff\num and what would they be let me tell\nyou they are\nthere you go you know what's funny about\nthis I'm not a PDA person and I feel\nlike this is where the podcast gets it\nall because it's uh consist like\nquestions about it you're extremely\nhonest about who you were at the\nbeginning which I think was really\nimportant like you always told me what\nyou are happy to do not happy to do your\npriorities your values the main thing is\nyour integrity between what you say and\nwhat you do and who you are on camera\nand who you are off camera it's\nliterally the same person like what you\ntalk about is the same person as who you\nare behind\nclosed doors and I think that that's\nsuch a beautiful quality because I think\nlike living with Integrity allows you to\ngive yourself so authentically which\nmeans that you're able to just give love\nconstantly because you're you're\nconstantly fueled by yourself but also\nyou're just Forever Living in alignment\nwhich is the like people feel that\nenergy from you and I feel like I feel\nthat every single day which is really\ncool thanks for that\nI actually think that what I loved about\nyou when we first met\nwas that you've always been absolutely\nadorable you're absolutely hilarious\nyou're still working I want something\nmore i i i a lot no I'm saying what I'm\ndoing here yeah you're hilarious like I\nthink you're one of the funniest people\nI know you make me laugh all the time\nthanks and I think I love that I could\nalways be myself around you I never felt\njudged yeah I never felt I had to be a\ncertain person I never felt like I had\nto perform or act in a certain way and I\nthink you really give people permission\nI don't think you just do that with me I\nthink you do that with everyone you give\neveryone permission to be who they are\nand they don't feel pressurized to\nimpress you or change who they are mold\nthemselves to be more important to you\nyou like to make everyone feel important\nfor who they are and I also fell in love\nwith\njust how positive you are in a sense of\nnot positive in the way people think\nabout it like oh you're just happy about\neverything but positive in the sense\nthat you never liked gossiping about\npeople or you never like criticizing\npeople or you never liked comparing\nyourself to other people like you were\nvery happy to let people live their own\nlives and not get involved in anything\nnegative to do with them but be happy\nwithin yourself and I thought that was\nbeautiful thanks and I think what's\nchanged or and obviously I still love\nyou for all the same things but I think\nwhat's really amazing is I think you've\nbeen on a huge journey to get to know\nyourself yeah for sure over the last few\nyears so we've been together now for\nnearly 10 years yeah and we've been\nmarried for seven nearly and I feel like\nin the last seven years you've truly\nfound yourself and you've discovered who\nyou are trying what your values are and\nyeah trying but a lot has been revealed\nand I think I love you for going on that\nJourney so confidently when you were\nscared to move to New York when we first\ngot married so from going from the\nperson who was scared to move to a new\ncity and a new country which is fair\nenough to be scared for to now be\nsomeone who's used that as a way of\nlearning about yourself and becoming\nmore confident in who you are I love you\nfor that because I think that that takes\na lot of courage and I think that it\nwould have been easy to be negative\nabout that but you didn't do that thanks\nyeah\namazing this is fun wonderful brilliant\nso the next topic that we're going to\ndiscuss is Riley and I have been on a\ncrazy adventure in the last seven years\nwe've moved country we've moved State uh\nwe've moved Apartments we've moved homes\nand the question is how is our\nrelationship changed how has it been\nimpacted by all of this and what have we\nlearned along the way I think it's it's\nreally interesting going back to that\nfirst question we answered because I\nfeel like I've stayed so much the same\nyeah I look at how it's affected me as\nbeing very like\nsimilar in the sense that I've just kept\nmy head down and I've kept working I've\nkept building kept growing kept trying\nto do my best\nbut\nI think that it just made me realize how\nnot codependent and how tolerant you are\nit's really interesting to me like I\ndon't think and this is to your credit\nit's I again I think I'm a good partner\nbut more to your credit that in the last\nseven years you've never once said to me\nyou don't spend enough time with me\nyou're never around\nor you don't listen to me and like that\nis amazing like I think that requires so\nmuch maturity from you to be so happy in\nyourself and finding your own self\nbecause I think even though I never want\nyou to feel those things like I feel\nlike I'm sensitive to those things as\nwell I still feel like if I told you\nhave got to jump on a flight tomorrow\nI'm gonna be gone for two weeks\nthat would just be normal to you like\nyou wouldn't ever make me feel bad or\nguilty about that and so I think that\nit's made me appreciate you more because\nwe've actually been through so many of\nthe biggest changes there's a study that\nshowed like the changes that stress\npeople out the most and even put stress\non relationships and it's moving\ncountries up there moving job is up\nthere moving home is up there and then I\nthink it's having kids so we've\nliterally done three out of the four\nconstantly over the last seven years and\nthe fact that we've constantly found a\nway to find our way back to each other\nand connect with each other and had the\nopenness\nto not just point the finger and blame\nor I've just never felt like it's been\nmy fault if life's been harder or easier\nand so there were times when when we\nwere close to being four months away\nfrom being broke and you didn't change\nhow you felt and now that things are\nbetter you haven't changed towards me\nand so I just feel like that kind of\nsupport is really special where you just\nfeel like someone's consistently in your\ncorner and that's how I feel with you\nthanks\nI do feel those things I think again it\ngoes back to the consistency because\nyou're the same person it's not been\nsomething that you didn't it was always\non the table like change was always on\nthe table I think now my perspective has\nchanged in the sense of before I felt\nlike I really knew where I would be\nliving what I would be doing you know\nbefore we got married I had an idea of\nwhat that would be now I feel like I\nlive more day-to-day year to year not\neven like expecting what the next year\nis going to bring or like not allowing\nmyself to build expectations of what the\nnext year is going to bring because I\nknow they could like change is just\nalways happening and I think I used to\nbe someone who was quite scared of\nchange generally and this has really\nhelped me not\nbe like that because we've had so many\nchanges that it's it's all I feel like\nit's a better way of living where\nthere's no expectation of what's coming\nnext you just kind of live in the flow\nof what's happening so yeah I think in\nin that respect I think the change it\nchange part for me was scary at the\nbeginning but became something that I\nwas quite excited to embrace because it\nfelt like it kind of felt more like\nFreedom rather than like even though I\neven though when you're not in control\nyou feel like that wouldn't be Freedom\nactually not expecting to be in control\nand not knowing what's going to happen\nfeels more free than having that control\nor thinking you have that control but\nthen also I have those times where I'm\nlike oh this is great and then like the\nnext minute I'm like I just want to go\naway to a forest and do like and just\nhide away like I feel like I go in like\nsuch two different directions and I feel\nlike you deal with that really well\nbecause I am someone who can go from\nbeing like so excited about something to\nthen being like Oh I just want to delete\nmy Instagram and go live in a forest for\nlike six weeks and not talk to anyone\nand you're like okay\nokay if that's what you need\num\nyeah I know I know I just I have quite\nlike an erraticness about me so I feel\nlike you uh you handled that pretty\npretty well\nI think you've handled the change\nremarkably well I don't know anyone else\nwho'd be able to handle how much change\nyou've been through yeah I don't know\nthe way you have\nso in my book eight rules of love I talk\nabout how we play different roles in\nrelationships and if you have the book\nthere's a relationship roles quiz so you\ncan find out which role you've been\nplaying in previous relationships or in\nthis one so the team have asked us to\nanswer the question if we're usually a\nparent a partner or a child in a\nrelationship where do we find those\nDynamics in the way we connect with each\nother so where do you feel let's start\nwith where do we feel we're the parents\nI think you've been my parent\nwhen it comes to food and eating healthy\nyeah yeah I get the look imagine I had\nlike lots of sugar right now in front of\nme like how would you okay\nso you're the parent when it comes to my\nfood because I'm the kid when it comes\nto food like I'm the kid who wants to\neat Sour Patch Kids I'm the kid who\nwants to eat like candy I'm the kid who\nwants to eat chocolate like that's all I\nwant to do because of my mum who's\nsitting here as well my mum fed me four\nchocolate products a day when I was\ngrowing up chocolate biscuit chocolate\nyogurt chocolate bar chocolate ice cream\nso I became addicted and then this\nparent has been unlearning me from\neating sugars yeah that's where you're\ndefinitely I also love some sugar in my\nlife yeah but yo you're a bit more yeah\nyeah you've had to wean me off of it so\nyeah you've been a parent when it comes\nto that I've been there you're\ndefinitely been a parent in uh you know\nthey call it like midlife crisis I have\nlike a weekly or monthly crisis\nyou're definitely the parody that's it\nI'm like I don't know what I'm doing I\ndon't know what I don't know whether I\nwant to do what I'm doing right now I\ndon't know whether what I'm doing is the\nright thing I don't know whether I love\nit I don't know whether I like it I\ndon't know who I am that's pretty much\nwhat happens every month\num and you're definitely the parent in\nthat situation yeah but parent slash\npartner like you you're not like telling\nme what to do you're kind of guiding me\nthrough it so I say also I feel like\nyou're not very parenting many you know\nparenting the health stuff either like\nI've always said like I've never yeah I\nknow what you mean judge didn't\ncriticized or like it's not like you're\nlike oh tell me you're like guidance\nyeah Karen is just the person who's\nmaking you looking after you and you're\nbeing child yeah yeah being childlike I\ndefinitely am yeah that in that\nsituation yeah yeah I think like running\nlate for things oh yeah and getting to\nplaces on time\nand making sure I like actually follow\nthrough with things plan out my life\n[Laughter]\nI feel like I feel like I'm a child\nsometimes when I'm like like just being\nbeing literally being a child I'm just\nlike love me now like just being like a\nkid about like wanting attention and\njust being a bit Moody and lucky you\ndon't like throw yourself on the floor\nI'm close to it but I still put that\nvoice on sometimes yeah I'm doing that\nso then that's when I'm like being a\nchild for sure when else\nthat's it that's it I don't think you're\nmuch of a child in that respect it's a\nparent and then child oh we're on child\nnow no parent-child and partner so\nPartners when you're like actually\nsupporting each other yeah\nand I think we do that overall I'd say\nthat's overall where we end up I agree I\nthink you've been my partner for my\nhealth I think I think you've been a\ngreat partner when it comes to like\nencouraging me to exercise more and work\nout like when we met I did so much for\nmy mind but I never exercised my body I\njust played sports or I walked and I\nthought that was enough and you were the\none who was like training me and\nencouraging me and educating me and then\nduring the pandemic we worked out\ntogether nearly every day yeah which I\nmiss because then she left me to work\nout with people who actually know how to\nwork out so like with me what are you\nsaying about me no that's what I'm\nsaying I think like you were oh I left\nyou you left me to work out with people\nwho actually want to work out yeah\nbecause that was you parenting me like\nyou'd be like let's work this is what we\ndid this is what we do like this is what\nyou call a squat like you know and then\nall of a sudden now you are you just got\nlike real workout classes yeah I'm not\nallowed to come to this yeah I think you\nare yeah I wouldn't want to go no\num I feel like you partner again just DJ\nstuff but I definitely think you helped\nme to\nhave like figure out my own Voice\nthrough not just giving to me what I'm\nasking for but to help me you know\nsee my own journey through figuring it\nout and I think that takes a lot because\nit kind of is you know it takes a lot of\npatience to do that and I think it's the\neasier option is actually just be like\nokay here just hate just just do this\nand just you know this is how you can\nfix this and this is how you do this and\nI always I'm someone who has a habit of\nnot being certain in my own decisions\nand so I think you really helped to\nlet me navigate even though I'll be like\nno just tell me like what should I do\nand you'll be like no I'm not telling\nyou what to do like I'm gonna show you\nhow you can get to the answer you and\nsay this but that's how you would act\nlike I'm gonna show you how to get to\nthe answer but I'm not gonna just give\nit to you like that because then you're\nnever gonna be able to do that for\nyourself and so I feel like you really\ndid guide through through that as\npartner yeah I think a lot of the time\nin relationships\nyou make someone feel broken because you\nkeep fixing them yeah and if you keep\nfixing them then that means they remain\nbroken and then whenever they feel\nbroken they have to run to you and\ndepend on you whereas if you teach\npeople how to heal themselves and\nnavigate life themselves then you've\nactually helped them so I always tell\npeople that\nloving someone means you make them fall\nmore in love with themselves yeah you're\nmore in love with you and not more\ndependent on you yeah that's so true\nactually and again that takes so much\nmore I think that takes so much more\npatience to do it that way than it does\nto just be like okay fine let me just do\nit for you like you know it feels like\nthe it's actually the faster option\nyou think you're sacrificing more by\nbeing that person that's fixing but\nactually it's more of a selfish way of\ndealing with it from my experience of\ndoing it for other people around me and\nin other relationships around me that\nyou end up being someone who yeah\nactually thinking about it is probably\nmore of a selfish thing because it also\nallows you to feel more important yeah\nversus letting them feel their\nimportance\num and their value I think a lot of\npeople love people being dependent on\nthem definitely because it gives them a\nsense of significance definitely\nespecially if you don't know what you're\ndoing in your life or if you feel like\nyou're a bit lost helping other people\nand although that's a great thing when\nyou help other people but the intention\nbehind it and what you're receiving from\nit can make a huge difference in how you\nactually feel about it so like if you're\nhelping someone through intention of\ngenuinely caring for them genuinely\nhelping them or are you helping them\nbecause it fuels you into feeling\nvaluable and therefore like for me I\nremember it used to be just a way that I\nwould throw myself into so I didn't have\nto think about what I was doing in my\nlife or how to figure out my own things\nit was just oh this is great I I need to\nbe doing this this person needs my help\nI need to like create this space for\nmyself in their life because then I\ndon't have to think about all the\nimportant stuff I actually need to deal\nwith so was the easier option and more\nof a selfish option yeah\num yeah that's very true so the next\ntopic is that sometimes your partner can\nbe extremely annoying or you find them\nannoying in that case one of me and\nRadley ever experienced that when is\nthat as far as a deal breaker and how to\ndeal with feeling annoyed by your\npartner I don't think you've annoyed me\nwow like you're not an annoying person\nin that way like I feel like yeah there\nare things that irritate me and I'll\nhappen I don't really remember stuff\nlike that but this is the best thing\nwhen yeah I have a terrible memory and\nyou forget the good stuff yeah forget oh\nyou can't have you can't have one or the\nother you either have you have both\num but I would I would say that\nobviously there are times where I've got\nagitated and been really Snappy I\ndefinitely have more of a short fuse\nthan you do\num and I have a not Tantrums I wouldn't\ncall them Tantrums but I definitely\ncan be more defensive and have more of\nan ego about arguing but that's very\ndifficult when the other person doesn't\nhave that and that's probably the most\nannoying thing that you do that it's\nlike I want to have a fight and you're\njust like trying to resolve it within\nthe first three seconds when I'm still\nin fight mode and I'm like for goodness\nsake just fight a little bit like please\njust just give me something and he's\njust always trying to just make things\nbetter it's so annoying\num that's it really\nno come on I must do something no yeah\nthat is the thing that annoys me as in\nbecause sometimes you just need to have\na fight\nsuddenly you just need to like argue out\nsay things you don't mean you know just\nI know I don't say things that I mean\nbut what I mean is just like sometimes\nyou just want to have it out you've\nnever said something with you it's like\nme going and you're going\nthat's basically how our fights go\nyou've never said something mean to me\nno okay I don't I don't say that's true\nI'm very thoughtful about my words like\nI really with everybody that I talk to\nand that I argue with I may say things\nirrationally but I never say things I\ndon't mean or I'm very specific with my\nwords but I'm just saying sometimes I\nlike to you know have a bit of a tiff\nyeah I yeah but I would I would agree\nthat I genuinely don't believe you've\never said something you don't mean or\nsaid something like I don't think you've\nsaid something harsh you might be upset\nwith me I think I just go silent or I\ndon't say things yeah that's probably\nthe thing that annoys you no not anymore\nthat used to but I talk about that in\nthe book oh yeah I learned about that\nyeah oh yeah yeah that's the other thing\nyou don't want to no you know what the\nother thing is I never know what's going\nto be in podcasts never know what's\ngoing to be a podcast never know what's\ngoing to be in a book I didn't even know\nthat there was going to be a love book\nbut somehow there's a book about love\nand this happens to do with us I'm quite\nprivate with certain things and then\nsuddenly it's all over the news it's\neverywhere and actually sometimes I\nthink about it I'm like I don't think I\nhad a choice in this oh is that no\nbecause I annoy you there\num I think there are certain times I'm\nlike oh but but I also think it's like a\nit's a personal choice of how much you\nwant to share about different parts of\nyour life and I think it's like yeah\nwe're realizing it no not in a bad way\nat all like I think you are just someone\nthat really wears every like your heart\non your sleeve you're someone who wants\nto share things to to give lessons and\nexperiences to people you're never\nsomeone who shares to show off you're\nnever someone who shares to prove a\npoint to anybody like you are so wise\nwith how you share things and that's why\nit's not an annoying thing I don't mean\nan annoying thing but it's one of those\nthings I'm sure there are different\ntypes of of Partners where one person's\nlike way more like I everybody always\nsays to me like oh my God you're so\neccentric I can't believe that you don't\nlike doing things in public or that you\ndon't and it's such an interesting thing\nbecause you were you not your nature is\nlike you your nature is to be around\npeople in front of people in terms of\nlike you are so you exude that you\nthrive off it like that's when I think\nthat that's when your nature is it's\nwhen you thrive off something like part\nof it at least whereas for me it's\nsomething I definitely learned to grow\ninto and it's something that I\nabsolutely love like I love sharing\nthings with people but I think the way\nthat you share like you're you're a very\nopen person and so it's less annoying\nthing it's just something I randomly\nthought of yeah actually I don't I don't\nknow like some people would tell me oh\nI've heard this about you on the podcast\nand I was like oh my god I didn't even\nknow that was on the podcast or like I\ndidn't even know this was in the book\nand so I think it's just it's different\nways and it's just understanding the\nperson's intention behind it so it\ndoesn't upset me I think I'm very\ndifferent in terms of how I share about\nus but it's like it's you're also in the\nrelationship yeah but I really\nappreciate that kind of lens to it\nbecause I think someone else could be\nupset but I you're right I only share\nour ups or Downs or challenges because I\nwant people to recognize that there is\nno perfect partnership and I think when\nwe first started sharing about\nrelationship that's why I stopped yeah\nthat's right because I hate being seen\nlike I find it really suffocating when\nif people think anything about\nperfection to do me because I know I'm\nnot that person I'm not that person I'm\nlike trust me he wrote this book for me\nto read because I need the stuff that's\nin the book but like I genuinely don't\nfeel that I'm a perfect person and so I\nfind it really suffocating and kind of\ndifficult to handle no so do I and so do\nI and that's my point that the reason\nwhy I started talking about oh you're\nright should I get tissue oh you're good\nyou're right\nI'm going to tissue work you want some\nwater\nokay bro that was so beautiful\nyeah\nthanks oh\nthanks man sorry just break your mic\nokay when I'm happy I cry when I'm angry\nI cry when I'm sad I cry with every\nemotion it's just how I release things\nfor anyone who doesn't know that I've\nspoken about that a thousand times so\ndon't worry if you see me cry yes I'm\nnot telling you to stop no I know I know\nI'm just telling this yeah that's\nactually why I started to share and we\nalways did but like share like fights\nthat we had or challenges that we had or\nthings like that because I just found\nthat\nI too don't ever want to portray a\nperfect image of me of me and you of of\nanything in my life because no one's\nperfect we're all making mistakes we're\nall a work in progress and the last\nthing I want is for people to think that\nme and you never fight or that me and\nyou have it all figured out or that\nwe're not having to transition and grow\nbecause we have to do all those things\nall the time and I think the mistake\nthat happens though sometimes with like\nobviously like the question I the\nquestion I get asked all the time now\nthat you've written a book I love\nobviously is like oh my gosh and you are\nyou're like just to be clear Jay's\nliterally like one of the most amazing\nPartners you could ever ask for but they\nassume that the relationship is just\nlike I just don't like the idea of\nperfection I find that with my stuff as\nwell like because people think that\nyou're just a positive person and same\nwith you you must get that all the time\nwhere it's like oh my gosh you must\nnever get upset and you must you just\nseem happy all the time and I'm like and\nthen it makes you want to kind of be\nlike Oh I'm sad today everyone and I'm\nlike I choose what I share because I\ndon't want to share that energy with\npeople because I know that energy I want\nother people to feel when they watch my\nthings or when they experience it that\ndoesn't mean I don't harness that energy\nwithin me it's what I then choose to let\nother people experience and I think\nthat's also important to know what\nyou're giving out to people I know that\nif someone sad around me that's going to\nmake me sad\nand so\nI'm sorry and when people are happy it's\nthe same thing and so I'd rather give\noff contagious happy energy than sad but\nthat doesn't mean people don't feel it\nyeah\n[Music]\nI feel with you and and that's why I\ntalk about I mean I constantly been\ntalking about like when I get irritated\nor when I get agitated or like I always\ntalk about how I get more Moody and I\ncan get Snappy and yeah all those things\nwith you and and that's what I talk\nabout in the book about how when I get\nwhen we have a fight I want to solve it\nwhen we have a fight you want to hide\nand so I call it venting and hiding and\nthen there's another one called\nexploding which are the three fight\nStyles exploding is when someone just\nwants to let all their emotions out and\nwe found a way where in the beginning\nwhen you used to want to hide uh you\ntake some time out and I wanted to vent\nin the beginning I used to think you\ndidn't care and so I literally would\nfeel like you didn't love me as much you\ndidn't care as much and I would say that\nto you yeah only to realize that none of\nthat was true what I realized was that's\njust how you process an argument and\nlearning that that's how you process an\nargument and that what I'm doing isn't\nright it's just how I process and\nargument helps you realize that you\ncould actually be on the same team and\nthen and saying okay let's get back to\nthis in 12 24 hours we can actually come\nback having digested what the problem is\nand talk about the problem and so I\nshared those kind of examples of our\nrelationship in order to help people\nunderstand that even I used to think you\ndidn't love me because you wanted to not\ntalk to me for two days yeah yeah but\nthat's not true you just needed time to\nthink about it and just because I wanted\nto talk about it now doesn't mean I care\nmore but that's how we think about\nthings we all think we care more yeah in\nthe way we act right or that someone\nelse cares less yes and so\nyeah and and I yeah I think it's just\nit's that thing of whenever you're\nsharing things about you know you share\nso many different topics and there's so\nmany things that you speak on and you\nknow when it was purpose I'm sure you've\ngot lots of questions about purpose when\nit's love you get so many questions\nabout love and I just think there's this\nlike I I think I'm still learning to do\nyou've already I feel like you have this\nthing of not you're very good at\ndigesting not really knowing what your\nintentions are knowing what you're\ngrounded in knowing your purpose and\ntherefore what other people's perception\nof that is doesn't affect you as much I\nthink I'm still working through the like\npressure of perfection which I'm just\nlike it's so hard to be I'm just not\nperfect like it's not I'm not happy all\nthe time I'm not this all the time but\nit's very difficult to\nvocalize that in a way that's not like\nokay you're just saying that because you\nknow it's it's so hard to communicate it\nto people if they've already got that\nperception of you and I think that's why\nsometimes I hide away or shy away from\nlike discussing certain things because\nfor me it's like I just I find that too\ndifficult to at the moment something\nthat I'm dealing with myself of like\nthat's not what like whenever yeah\nthat's just the phase of my life that\nthat I'm in right now I think I think\neveryone in the world is looking for\nPerfection yeah yeah\nno but there's a part of us totally you\nwant to know like what is that yeah and\nit's like once you know biggest\nperfection in when I think about it and\nhave tried to think about that mindset\nit's like okay because Perfection equals\nhappiness in in Minds like and I can\nunderstand it's like whenever I see\nsomeone who I think whatever perfect is\nto me has that perfect life I'm like oh\nthat is what happy is and I think it's\njust through my own thing of whenever\nI've got the things that I think mean\nPerfection or what people like the\nthings that people perceive of you as\nbeing perfect you're like that doesn't\nmake me feel happy at all like those\nthings that you're saying to me or\nmessaging me saying that oh you've got\nthis which is like that's that's like\nthe perfect this or whether it's to do\nwith physical appearance or mental\nmental stay or whatever it is it's like\nthere's so many parts to Perfection that\npeople think equal Perfection but it's\nlike when you hear that from the other\nside I'm like oh wow if that's\nPerfection that hasn't made me happy and\nso I think there's from me when I think\nabout perfection now it's like I've\nrealized stripping back so much to be\nlike what is what would make me the most\nhappy and that's what Perfection is and\nto me right now it's really leaning back\ninto my spiritual journey and like\nreally trying to harness that because I\nknow that was the only thing that made\nme so happy not only but like the main\nthing that made me so happy and that\nthat includes the people around you who\nreally support that but I think when you\nend up just constantly hearing what\nperfect is and what people think the\nthink you are as being perfect it stops\nyou from actually being yourself and I'm\nlike this year I just want to be so much\nmore less what trying to be what other\npeople's perception of me is and just be\nyes yeah yeah I love that yeah and I\ndon't think there's a perfect person I\ndon't think there's a perfect partner I\nthink there's just navigating our\nimperfections and figuring them out and\nthe reason I I wrote a book about love\nwas not because I'm a love expert or a\nLove Guru or because I think I know\neverything about love or that we have a\nperfect love I wrote about it because\nI think I'm fascinated by it totally\nyeah I wanted to spend time studying it\nand learning about it and I wanted to be\nable to share insights and Frameworks\nthat I've created to not just manage our\nrelationship but manage and Coach other\npeople's lives that I've worked with and\nso what I'm sharing in the book is there\nis no story of a perfect love that no no\nit doesn't exist in the book there is no\nPerfect story even a proposal story I\ntell is a mistake and something that\nwent wrong and not wrong because you\nwere upset or because you were sad and\nwrong because\nit made me realize I was just trying to\nlove you in the way that I thought the\nmovies taught us how to love I wasn't\nloving you in the way that you wanted to\nbe loved no but I think the tools and\nthe Frameworks that you've even shared\nwith me have been so useful for not just\nour relationship but like every\nrelationship that I have so I personally\nthink like everything that you've even\ntaught me in the relationship has been\napplicable to every relationship that I\nhave and I think like genuinely think\nyou're like the perfect person to write\nthis book because it's it is so much\nabout you've spent so much time and so\nmuch energy building like the\nrelationships that you have not even\njust romantic relationship the\nrelationships that you have with people\nthat for me has been like the when you\nhave a qualification but not the\nqualification whatever that word is but\nthe qualification for you to write the\nbook like because seeing your\nrelationships with people how deep they\nare how genuine they are how authentic\nthey are like that is that in itself is\nthe most beautiful thing because it's so\nhard to build relationships in the world\nlike through all of this stuff that\nhappened\nthroughout life through the barriers\nthat we put up through the social media\nfilters through every photo there's so\nmany filters that we end up having\nthroughout our life now especially\nbecause you're exposed to so many people\nthe more people you're exposed to the\nmore you feel like you have to adapt the\nmore you feel like you have to change\nand sometimes you're you're putting on\ndifferent clothes and different things\nnot clothes but different clothes and\nlayers to be different people for\ndifferent people and I think you are\nsomeone who literally through every\nrelationship I have seen remain the same\nperson you've reacted things in the same\nway you treat things in the same way so\nthis is me saying separately as your\npartner saying that the way that you\nhave cultivated relationships and really\nwork through how you create authentic\nrelationships that for me is like I want\nto read the book because of that then\nthat obviously applies to our\nrelationship the way that you you\ncommunicate the way that you share\nthings like it takes so much work to\nbecome that person and to just read the\nbook to understand and by the way this\nis not a book club book plug guys I\nhaven't read it yet but I know it's\ngoing to be good just because of having\nexperienced that and seen it like for 10\nyears day in day out the way that you\nare and that's why people who are close\nto you and the people that you have in\nyour life and the the way that you have\ncreated those relationships there are\nrelationships that you have for years\nand years and years or they will and not\neven if if they're not they're\nrelationships that have got so deep so\nfast that it's never been about the\nsurface level stuff and I think like\nthat is just so powerful and so amazing\nbecause I know I've had relationships\nI've had friendships that I've had on\nrelationships for years and years and\nthere's you know they still don't feel\nwhat they should feel like because I\nhaven't invested the time to figure out\nhow to make it there and each\nrelationship is so individual that you\nhave to invest that time so if you want\nthat relationship with someone and you\nwant that friendship you want want that\nbrothership whatever it is it takes that\ntime investment it takes creating those\nFrameworks it takes creating whatever it\nis but you know it is an investment of\ntime and energy and I think that the\namount of relationships that you've had\nthroughout your life that have been so\nmeaningful that in itself shows that you\nhave so much to share and wisdom to\nshare on it and so you know romantic\nplus other relationships I think that's\nsuch an important skill that you have to\nhave through your life and I feel like\nI'll be so sad if I got to the end of my\nlife and I was like wow I had all these\nfriends but like no real relationships\nthe whole thing we need as humans I feel\nis to feel that connection\nand you can go 50 60 70 80 years of your\nlife not even having one connection to\nsomeone in that way and how sad to have\nmissed out on life sad I'm talking sad\nfor me not like oh that's sad but like\ngenuinely sad to go through a whole\nlife's worth of living and not actually\nhaving experienced what a relationship\nmeans like that that would just you know\nhow unfulfilling that would be and so\nyeah I'm like I genuinely am excited to\nread it because I feel like and you're\nlike they're teaching me along the way\nbut sometimes it's hard to really hear\nfrom someone that you spend time with or\nlike that you really that that you not\ntake for granted because I really value\nwhat you do but you kind of take the\nwords for granted when you're not\nstudying it or when you're not actually\nin you know when you're not in a place\nto even receive it and so I feel like\nI'm in that place right now where I\nreally want to build deeper connections\nand I think that's why it's yeah I think\nit's such an important thing from you\nfrom other people started listening to\nthe podcast recently I did this was this\nwas on purpose the question was what did\nwe find annoying about each other\nI did I said that it's when you share\nthings about me that I don't know about\nthat is something that genuinely annoys\nme\num and also because it's seen from your\nperspective and you have like filter of\nyour eyes when it comes to me because\nyou always think things I do are nice\nwhen actually I can be a terror but yeah\nI changed the question sorry yeah so I\nhave a chapter in this book called your\npartner is your Guru yeah uh and this\nwas inspired by you great\nwell it really was inspired from our\ntradition and the idea that yeah\nrelationships are more about education\nand Enlightenment than they are about\nentertainment yeah and I think that you\nget into relationships because of\npleasure\nbut actually\nrelationships that last are ones in\nwhich you grow and which you find a\npurpose yeah and I think that sounds\nreally unsexy and uncool because people\nthink like oh well my partner should\njust be someone I have fun with all the\ntime and we have a lot of fun together\nwe've had a lot of fun over the last 10\nyears for sure without a doubt like\nwhether it was when we've traveled\ntogether when we've started\njoyo together when we've uh moved\nwhether we you know we're in this tiny\nshoebox apartment or whatever it was\nlike we've had a great time but the\ngreatest great time is when you're\nlearning and growing together because\nyou actually\nlearn how to improve your relationship\nand that's what makes your relationship\nbetter so when I talk about your partner\nis your Guru what I love is that if you\nlook at Eastern Traditions gurus are not\nthe people who tell you what to do or\npreach to you or act smarter than you\nthe guru like the monk gurus they would\ncome and sit at the back of the class\nand listen to a young monk give a talk\nlike that's what gurus did or when you\nbow down to an elder Guru the guru would\nbow down to you on the floor even if\nthey were twice your age like the guru\nwas not a figure that made you feel\ninferior it's not authoritative yeah but\nthe guru was a figure that constantly\nmade you feel like they believed in you\nand that you had potential and that you\nhad value to offer and so when I wrote\nthis chapter called your partner is your\nGuru I break down the qualities of a\nstudent and I break down the qualities\nof a guru and all of the qualities our\nGuru is generally your partner who\nbelieves in you and I found what I found\nin relationships is that it's so easy\nfor you to be the most critical person\nof your partner yeah it's so easy for\nyou to say that oh yeah you're just the\nworst and you're so like lazy and you're\njust like you know ambitious enough and\nyou're not organized you're not like\nit's so easy and I found so many couples\nwere in that space even if you don't say\nit we feel that about our partners\nbecause people say it to other people\nthe amount of people that come to me and\nsay my partner's ambitious enough he\ndoesn't work hard enough like oh she\ndoesn't understand enough she's too\nclingy like we have these negative views\nand actually we should be the ones who\nsee the potential in our partner of\ncourse Beyond any and I make this very\nclear in the book beyond any abusive or\ntoxic relationships we should what look\nat the potential in our partner we\nshould be the ones who are like making\nthem feel like they can grow and become\nsomething of course not ridiculous in\nstupid ways but in a healthy way yeah\nthat's why I think that when I wrote\nthis chapter one of the ways in which\nyou've been my Guru is that and I've\nsaid this multiple times to other people\nI don't think I've said it to you fully\nbut I think that as I became more\nmaterially successful I wanted you to\nlove me more for my material success and\nyou didn't like you just didn't budge so\neven if I'd like win an award or I'd be\nnumber one or I'd whatever I did I never\nfelt like you loved me more and for a\nlong time in our relationship I just\nfelt like you didn't love me like\nbecause of that because you didn't love\nme more and then when I would talk to\nyou or I would hear about what you said\nto someone else and even when I listened\nto you today it's like I'm constantly\nreminded that you love me for who I am\nnot what I achieve and that has been the\ngreatest Guru thing that you've done\nbecause I think I would have started to\nlove myself\nfor what I've achieved and not who I am\nif you love me for what I achieved and\nnot who I am and today is such a subtle\nintricate point but\nthat's the kind of stuff that your\npartner can do for you because your\npartner actually sees you and then in a\nmore like\nin a more tangible way\nyou're the person that if I'm practicing\na talk to you or I'm practicing\nsomething to you or I read you a part of\nthe book when I'm first writing it\nyou'll call me out and be like that's\naverage or I don't like that or I'm so\ngreat that's crap and it's like your\npartner is only doing that and you say\nthis to me all the time when my ego gets\nin the way and you'll be like I'm only\ndoing that because I want it to be\namazing because I care about you yeah\nthe person who doesn't care about you is\njust gonna be like oh that's amazing\nlike that's awesome just keep doing it\nwhereas you're like I don't I don't want\nyou to look stupid on stage tomorrow I\nwant you to think about it and so I find\nthat that also is how your partner's\nyour Guru because they're the only one\nwho can coach you through your ego\nbecause if anyone else said that I\nprobably wouldn't take it but because\nyou're saying it's like I know she wants\nonly what's for my best yeah and so I\nwill listen more as well yeah thanks um\nbut I also think with what you were\nsaying about you know the awards and\nstuff I think there's you know what I've\nlearned from those situations is that\nthere's still an element to like even\nthough you know I always think about\npeople who achieve a lot in their life\nand they must and not saying oh my God\nit's so hard to achieve a lot of life\nbut to just ears no I mean no what I\nmean it's so it's such a hard life to\nachieve a lot what I'm trying to say is\nthat it's it's difficult sometimes for\npeople who and by the way this doesn't\nmean achieves a lot in the Limelight or\nachieves a lot in their day-to-day life\nbut you know people can get so used to\npeople achieving that every success\ndoesn't end up feeling like a success to\nto the other people but the the the not\ngo out what's like the craft graft\nthat's gone into it only the person\nwho's done it knows and even as someone\nwho's watched you through it or watched\nyou know watched you actually\num do what you need to do to to get you\nknow those achievements it's still not\nthe same as being that person and so to\neven be a person watching and observing\nstill to have that respect and that\nvalue for it and to share that oh my\ngosh that's amazing like and I think I\nyou know I genuinely think I just got so\nused to you achieving and you've always\nbeen a person who's achieving in but but\nthe work has just always been there but\nI think it's even just appreciating the\nwork even if you don't appreciate the\nwhat's come from it even if I'm not like\noh my gosh it's a ward because sometimes\nI'm like oh wow another streamy oh wow\nanother this like okay cool because I\nknow that there's always more coming\nbecause I know you are just such an\nachiever and like you are you put in the\nwork so naturally there's going to be\nachievement but I think there is so much\nin even though you're not looking for it\nwhat I've learned from it is there is so\nmuch to actually so much to sharing that\nwow I see the work that you're doing\nlike that's amazing and I never felt\nlike you needed that validation because\nI was like oh you just keep going and\nyou know that you're doing great like\nyou must know it because you are but I\nthink it's really important for loved\nones\npartner family to keep sharing people's\nsuccess and there's so and you know when\nyou end up celebrating other people's\nsuccess I've realized that in my life it\nmakes you so much more of a better\nperson because you're really thinking\nabout how amazing it is for someone to\nhave done that and not even just the\nsuccess the legwork that's happened\nbefore that and I really it's so\nimportant to do that it's not about\nboosting someone's ego it's not about\nmaking someone feel like oh what they've\ngot is it's so valuable but making\nsomeone know that we see the work that\nyou're doing and we see the hard work\nthat's going into it and I see you know\nI just it's a way of saying I see you in\nin a subtle way and I think it's really\nunderrated because because I think\npeople are used to being like oh wow\nthat's amazing you've got this but they\ndon't think about everything else before\nso now when I think about\ncelebrating someone's success or\ncelebrating your success it's like me\nactually saying to you wow I see\neverything that's happened for you to\nget there and I've realized how\nimportant that is and I don't normally\nand I've not been someone to do that for\nyou so now I'm like oh I really do want\nto do that for you and for other people\naround me and I think you're right the\nguru part is true like whatever I've\nnoticed I haven't been doing has been\ninstrumental for this but also in every\nrelationship that I have because it's\nshowing me that the little thing you\nknow you notice so much about yourself\nobviously they always say you notice the\nmost about yourself in relationships\nright like who you actually are and I\nfeel like in a lot of other\nrelationships I haven't seen that you\nknow with my mum she's always just like\nwhatever you know whatever you end up\ndoing your moms love you like all the\ntime it's like unlimited amount of love\nbut I think in relationships you're\nconstantly reflected back to you they\nthey don't in your relationships you\ndon't allow you know I feel like I see\nit on a constant basis of what I'm not\ndoing especially if your partner is\nsomeone who is so loving that the\nreflection is you know you can't help\nbut see the things about you need to\nchange because that person is constantly\njust pouring love into you and so I\nthink it's just anyway I just think it's\nsuch an important part but that Guru\npart that you were saying I completely\nagree because I feel like I've had that\nand that's been pouring into other areas\nof my life too\num and so\nyeah that's it\nwhy are you laughing you always do that\nat the end of when you're talking about\nsomething I'm like you're really\npassionate yeah yeah so that's it yeah\nbecause I feel like I'll just end up\nrepeating it in different ways willing\nto be succinct yeah so the question is\nwhat have we prioritized in a previous\nrelationship that we don't prioritize in\nthis relationship something we basically\nthought was important before but we no\nlonger think is important now in this\nrelationship I think it's what you've\ntalked about a lot and I'm sure many\npeople have heard you say this but the\ntime quality thing\nI think that's been something that you\nyou know the more time you spend with\nsomeone you think that time is the\ninvestment people think that time is the\ninvestment like the amount of time you\nspend with someone is what the\ninvestment is this person is willing to\nspend two hours with me but this person\nis willing to spend 15 minutes with me\nthat must mean the two-hour person\nvalues me more loves me more cares for\nme more but what is the quality of those\ntwo hours what is the quality of those\n15 minutes makes such a difference and I\nthink you know we I've just been so used\nto that concept that that's what I\nalways you know related to this friend\nor this relationship this person wants\nto spend the most amount of time with me\nthat must mean you know that person\nloves me more and so I think that's\nsomething I've really changed because\nyou can feel so much more fueled from a\n15-minute interaction with someone\num and loved with presents then you can\nwith you know two hours of someone's\ndistracted time and I'm that's something\nI'm still working on as a person of\nbeing someone who is present I think\nit's something I've really you know I've\nbeen up and down with it there are\ndifferent times where my mind can just\nyou know go everywhere and do everything\nand not even be in the same room as\neverybody else that I'm in the room with\nbut I think it's something that I I know\nit's some it's it's I want to be working\non and something I want to be improving\non but I think that's a value that I\nhave changed I love that\nI I think I've talked about this a few\ntimes but I do think it's it's important\nto keep reitering like I think I used to\nsee romance very one way I had a very\nsingular view of what romance men which\nwas like\nnice dinner Candlelight flowers movie\nlike that kind of very typical idea of\nwhat romance looks like or like Netflix\nand chill where you're like snuggled up\non the couch watching like I think we\nall have these very basic views like I\nhad someone ask me the other day they\nwere like\nyou know if I'm Netflix and chilling\nwith someone like we've gone beyond the\nfirst date phase of having a drink\ntogether but now we're Netflix and\nchilling like but I don't feel chemistry\nI was like you're not gonna film\nchemistry Netflix and chilling yeah and\njust watching a movie just watching a TV\nshow a movie like you can't feel\nchemistry for someone doing that because\nit's such a basic activity and I think\nour relationship by almost chance and I\ndon't know how but we kind of started on\nthat foot of like one of our first dates\nwas go ape oh yeah and go wait for\nanyone who doesn't know what that is is\na an assault course that's 80 feet up in\nthe air you know we're like swinging\nfrom Branch to Branch we're helping each\nother out like you you got to see what\nscared me I got to see what scared you\nlike there's just so much opportunity\nright for chemistry there and we would\nhave very easily figured out if there\nwasn't any chemistry there and another\nthing that we've done a lot of which we\ntalked about before is escape rooms\nagain it's very easy to like get a\nconversation started and like you don't\nhave to have that awkward silence\nbecause there's something to solve and I\nthink that's what life's kind of like\nlike life's about solving a problem life\nisn't just talking to each other and\noften when you go to dinner I see so\nmany couples on their phones and no\none's talking for like an hour and a\nhalf and the food comes and you kind of\nmention a few things that you like and\nthen you're back to your phone and\nthat's because you can't just sit there\nand have random conversation you need\nanother almost activator or something\ninteresting or fascinating to do like I\nknow when we've been to like a pottery\nclass or a painting class or recently\nyou tried to do wakeboarding right and\nit's like that to me is so much more I\nlearned so much more about you watching\nyou try to do this impossible task but\nan extreme sport I might add an extreme\nsport which made you feel like you had\nwhiplash the next time\nmuch pain yeah but it was like so fun\nwatching you try something new as\nopposed to like if we just sat at the\nbeach and had dinner like it it just\ngoes to me and I appreciate by the way\nlike we're tired at the end of the day\nwe do want to turn a show on that's fine\nbut at least once a week I think it's\nreally important to go do something\ndifferent things that builds yeah\nsomething that builds something where\nyou're learning about someone somewhere\nyou get more Curious you laugh at each\nother you laugh at yourself something\nwhere you're both doing a new experience\nbecause I find that in in my old\nrelationships I literally thought of\nlove and romance as a very typical date\nnight and I don't think we have a\ntypical date night I think we try and\navoid it generally yeah if we go to\nwatch a movie we don't see that as date\nnight we just see that as watching a\nmovie yeah we'll both be like oh we\nreally want to see this movie yeah let's\ngo and watch it but we're not like oh\nthis is date night like that doesn't\nbecome our bonding that just becomes\nsomething fun we want to do yeah or we\ndon't watch a TV show and think this is\nus bonding like this is where you're not\nconnecting yeah can't be something that\ndeepens or strengthens or creates\nyou know a different perspective on your\nrelationship it's just you know I used\nto feel the same way where it's like oh\nyou know that that thing of going on a\nFriday like movie night you know and if\nif every single time you're hanging out\nit's an activity where there's little\nconnection little like a connection on\nlike all levels connection on a mental\nlevel connection on talking like there's\nso much to do with connection that needs\nto happen within\num within a day or within spending time\nwith someone where if you're watching\nsomething or if you're doing something\nwith little of that how can you get to\nthe end of the day and be like you know\nwhat that was that was really good I\nreally felt like I connected with that\nperson because really you're just\nsitting there together in the same space\nbut there's connection isn't you know\nthat that's a different type there's not\na deeper connection that you're building\nduring that time and again I love going\nto watch movies and stuff but I think\nI've learned even if I want to get to\nknow a friend I won't ask her to come to\nwatch a movie with me that won't be the\nfirst time I'm spending with a\ngirlfriend I'm trying to get to know it\nwill be let's go work out together let's\ngo food shopping together like it sounds\nso much but something where we're able\nto connect on things find out Mutual\nthings that we like or love and you know\nthat's what really builds familiarity\nand and the connection and so yeah I\nagree\nso the question is if we rewinded 10\nyears what would have been our top three\nthings we were looking for in a person\nyeah at that time I think my mum was\nmore worried about me looking for a\npartner than I was\nand I'm joking she wasn't like pushing\nme or anything but\num your mom forced you to marry me yeah\nbasically it comes out now I I don't\nknow I was like in a big transitional\nphase of my life when I was when I\nstarted getting to know you or when I\nmet you at least oh that's a long time\nago well we're talking about when we\nfirst started dating ten years ago when\nwe first started right so at that point\nI don't think I knew I think I was just\nat the point in my life where I was like\noh I knew I wanted someone that I could\num grow spiritually with I think that\nwas that was probably top of my list at\nthe time because of the phase I was in I\nwas you know in deep at that time of\nreally trying to explore that phase of\nmy life at that part of my life and so\nthat was probably number one for me was\nsomeone that I know has has spirit in\nthem that wants to explore that part of\ntheir life too that's what I wanted and\nthat was my number one to me I didn't\nreally have any like at that time had\nany like financial goals or anything\nthat wasn't something I thought about\nvery often\num and then apart from that I'm trying\nto think oh and just laughing like I\nknew that I wanted someone that I could\nlaugh with and crack jokes with and just\nyeah I think laughing was really\nimportant to me and I I don't think I\nhadn't spent time to think about that at\nthe time so that's that's about all I\ncan think of yeah I don't think I ever\nhad a list either like I don't think I\nwas ever that kind of a person and\nthat's why I'm not a big list person now\nlike I don't I think lists can often\nminimize\nwho you meet because you have such a\ncriteria that's true and then you're\nfinding this person who has all of this\nperfect criteria but someone can be\nperfect on paper and still not be the\nright person and I think you see this\nlike I mean I'm giving a sports analogy\nhere but bear with me it's the idea that\nsometimes a team on paper can be the\nperfect team they have all the best\nplayers in the world yeah but they don't\nperform on paper on on the pitch or on\nthe field and I feel like that's what\nrelationships end up like where you have\nthis person who ticks all your criteria\nbut then they're not that in real life\nlike you don't feel that with them and\nso I think relationships are more about\ndiscovering someone like I couldn't have\nknown what you would be like in 10 years\nyou just can't know no you really can't\nI can't know what someone's gonna be\nlike in 10 years and so all I can do is\nbe curious and open and learn you are so\nmany more things than I ever thought you\nwere or would be or could be or anything\nbut you either have to figure it out as\nyou go and go oh I like that or I don't\nlike that and let that be what leads you\nrather than be like okay I think I know\nwho this person is but then what if they\nchange what if those three things you\nwanted became completely different like\nI did want someone who was spiritually\ngrounded you are still spiritually\ngrounded and that is a massive pursuit\nin you I wonder what I would feel like\nif you weren't supposed I don't know\nlike I didn't even know how I feel about\nthat because that would be something\nyou'd have to be open to if it came to\nthem right right and so I I think\ncriteria interesting uh but I think it's\nmore about exploring and discovering a\nhuman being that's two actually so many\npeople have lists of like so many of my\nfriends who are looking for a partner\nwill have all these lists of what they\nwant and every category they'll have\nsomething that they want in it and\nsometimes it's like oh I met this person\nand they make me laugh and they you know\nthey really give that feeling that\nthey've been looking for but then they\ndon't meet the criteria and it kind of\ncompletely throws them off and they\ndon't even know whether to go on a\nsecond date with them and it kind of\nfeels like a missed opportunity because\nyou know it's so a lot of the time it\nshould be so much more about emotion and\nhow someone makes you feel versus\nwhether they fit that\nthat perfect that you've created yeah\nlike some people like he has to be six\nfoot two yeah so oh my gosh so many\npeople and I'm like um like how my\nfriends like us we told dark and\nhandsome and I get I get being attracted\nto have tattoos and I get being\nattracted to your partner yeah\ndefinitely I'm not saying don't be\nattractive obviously obviously right\njust putting it out there but you can't\nmake that the criteria of it all like no\nif you're already getting along with\nlike if you get along with someone and\nyou've got that you know connection to\nthen go back to your list and be like\ntick tick cross because they're six foot\ntwo is not gonna keep that relationship\ngoing no that's the point like whether\nyou know that's not going to make sure\nwe're all going to shrink you know\nthat's what happens with old age so\nthey're married someone six for four\nexactly exactly so the question is how\ndo you re-shot for our partner even when\nour partner has so many other priorities\nhas a purpose has things that keep them\nbusy how do we still show up for each\nother when we're busy and they're busy\nand have so much going on yeah I I think\nthis was actually our weakness because\nbeing busy in our life came about on us\nso quickly like I don't you know I\nalways say this to people like I didn't\nplan for this life we didn't plan for\nthis life things transformed and moved\nvery quickly and changed very quickly\nand it it took off quickly even for us\nand we almost had to play catch-up with\nit and so I never thought when we got\nmarried that we'd ever spend any time\napart right right and all of a sudden\nmonths in our relationship before the\npandemic\nin the first two years of our marriage\nwe spent like eight months apart and\nyeah then it was the pandemic and we\nspent every day together and I loved it\nI'd have to say it was two of my\nfavorite years yeah of spending time\nwith you yeah I love spending time with\nyou for those two years and then when\nthe pandemic was over again our lives\nagain have been like we spent like\nnearly six months apart last year this\nmonth at the start of this year we've\nalready spent a month apart obviously\ndifferent reasons and last year again\nwas a surprise it wasn't part of the\nplan yeah it was challenges Beyond us\nthat we couldn't control that were\nkeeping us apart Visa issues things like\nthat that are like complex and you know\nthings that we have to deal with when\nyou are from different countries and\nlive in different countries and that was\nlike the first time where I realized\nthat I didn't have good tools for that\nkind of\nuh distance and actually because I just\nthought that it didn't matter you you\njust stay the same and things would be\nfine and so\nI think I've actually learned the hard\nway sometimes where I haven't been as\nwell informed or didn't think I had all\nthe tools I had it all figured out and\nI've realized the importance of checking\nin every day yeah which I never really\nused to think that was a thing I never\nthought you had to check in every day\nand I know that sounds stupid to a lot\nof people but no I think it's also\nbecause we're both very safe independent\noh yeah we're very independent as well\nwe're safe and secure we trust each\nother and then I realized checking in\nevery day was so important when we were\ntraveling or or not in the same place uh\nthat was a big one I'd say that the\nother one was for every day you spend a\npart you need to have a quality day\ntogether I really believe that like I\nfelt like last year when we didn't see\neach other for six months I felt like I\nspent the next six months only thinking\nabout a relationship because it had to\nbe the priority you can't just expect a\nplant or a tree to grow in your house\nwhen you don't water it you don't take\ncare of them and so if you've not seen\nit for six months because you've been\ntraveling you don't just get the company\nyeah you don't just get to come back to\nit and go oh great like I'm back now\nlike start blooming like it doesn't work\nthat way like you take so much of that\neffort and I think I didn't fully digest\nthat and last year was that year where I\nwas like all right that's what it's\ngoing to take it's going to take six\nmonths of recreating refocusing\nreprioritizing that's what I did last\nyear that's how I felt that I focused on\nthat at the end of last year yeah and\nthat's how I feel now as well like you\nknow you've been here because of uh\nfamily challenges and things like that\nwith your grandma it's not been well and\nwho obviously we know is your favorite\nperson in the world and it's like you've\nobviously want to be with them again we\nhaven't seen each other for a month\nbecause you've had to be within hospital\nand so there's so many things that come\nup in our lives\nthat are always going to be there so we\ncan't live in this perfect world of like\noh never go two days without each other\nnever life doesn't work that way like\nlife is what you can't make fake rules\nbut the rule I have made is that when we\nare reconnecting you have to go deeper\nin less time to rebuild the relationship\nwhen you are busy yeah and you have to\nspend quality time one of the things I\nlove that we did was and I want to get\nback to it as soon as we're in a flow of\nbeing together again it's like the idea\nof every 30 days we used to take three\ndays we disappear three hours away from\nLa we'd lock our phones away in the room\nand we'd just bike together walk\ntogether and be together and to me when\nyou all have a busy month having three\ndays a month where you go so deep with\neach other is so needed because you are\nbusy every month and not everyone has\ntime every day or the energy every day\nto like sit down with their partner and\ncheck in and make it amazing you can't\nbut you can once a month and I think you\nhave to have a monthly check-in even\nwhen we do these annual check-ins\nI think these are really important like\nyes we recorded and it goes out as a\npodcast but I think every couple should\nhave an annual check-in and answer these\nquestions that we're answering otherwise\nlike years go by and then a decade later\nyou're thinking about your relationship\nand so I think reflecting is such a\npowerful tool yeah and recording is\nactually a powerful tool and I think if\nwe were to reflect and record more often\nevery month and every year with our\npartners your relationship will go in\nthe right direction as opposed to your\nrelationship going off in a wrong\ndirection yeah and then you're trying to\nsave it years later yeah that makes\nsense I think check-ins yeah I think I I\ndidn't think they either I was like oh\nwe're in two different time zones\nit's so hard to just we'll just figure\nout when we see each other and we'll\ntalk when we see each other we'll we'll\num catch up with each other when we see\neach other but yeah I think daily\ncheck-ins is is a really important part\nof it message or call like whatever is\nfeasible and\neasy to do I think being really honest\nabout what you need as well like I feel\nlike yeah that's true I feel like just\ncatching the person like I you know that\neven if I've had a busy day if you said\nto me\nI really need to talk to you tonight or\nlet's chat totally you know I'd be there\nyeah even if I've had a really busy day\nand I'm exhausted or whatever it may be\nbut if you don't know sometimes you\nassume your partner just knows anything\nand I think that's always where things\ngo wrong where it's like well why\nhaven't you checked in with me for a\nmonth yeah and that mentality really\nruins relationships rather than just\nsaying let's agree to have a check and\neverything yeah let's see how we're\ndoing yeah see what you need help with\none thing I recommended in the book was\nfour questions\nso once every day is\num what have you done for yourself today\nonce every week is what have you got\ncoming up this week and what support do\nyou need every quarter is is this\nrelationship going in the direction you\nwant and how how can we get it in there\nand the fourth question every year is\nwhat are your goals and how can I help\nyou I ask you a lot of those questions\nall the time and so I just broke it down\ninto that formula because I really\nwanted people to have like really clear\nthings that they could do yeah I'll ask\nyou them from now on\ncool get my notepad out so the question\nis it's early 2023 what are our goals\nwhat are we pursuing what's important to\nus as a couple for this year I always\ntalk about in the book how there's three\ntypes of relationship the one you have\nwith your own purpose the one your\npartner has with their purpose and then\nhaving a purpose together as well and so\nlooking at that third part of it\num I think for me it's I really feel\nthat even though I haven't been\nneglectful or\nuh I don't feel I've caught our\nrelationship second or less important\nfor this much time I'm definitely in a\nplace this year where I want it to be\nreally important and so I want to travel\nmore together\nI want to spend even more quality time\ntogether especially because we've kind\nof gone from having like two years when\nwe first we went together two years\nmarried where we were like in the\npandemic where we're together every day\nso now again the busyness and it's\nalmost like I want to make sure that I'm\nconstantly investing in that in our\nrelationship and I think traveling\ntogether more having that deep time as\nI'm talking about together more of those\nweekends yeah more like that stuff is so\nimportant to me and I'm really looking\nforward to that with you yeah me too\nthat and like I think for me it's like\nlearning how to schedule in time for\nthat because sometimes I can be like oh\nyeah it will happen and we can do it\nwhenever and we'll just hang out and\nthey're like planning things and\ncreating experiences and moments for\nthat to happen I think that's uh that's\nsomething I want to work on because I'm\nnot very good at that yeah thank you\nRoddy for coming back on that's all\nright you'll be coming back on a lot\nthis year and next year because
