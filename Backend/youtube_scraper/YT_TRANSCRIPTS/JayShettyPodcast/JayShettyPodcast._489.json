there's a\nthere's an equal level of appreciation\nand excitement for the moment man you've\ndone some uh some groundbreaking podcast\nuh your guests to how you've got people\nto open up the conversations that you've\nhad more importantly you know um the\nlives that you're saving by just being\ntransparent authentic and true to who\nyou are I think it's it's dope as hell\nso uh it's an honor to sit across from\nyou I'm excited about the conversation\num and it's one that's been on my my\nlist as well so I'm glad that you know\nwe finally got it worked out it's where\nwe can make this happen yeah thank you\nman that's that's very kind and it's\nreally beautiful hearing that from you\nhonestly so let's dive in before we keep\ngoing back and forth with roses let's go\nlet's get it uh you know one of the\nthings I want to start off and this is\ngoing to take us anywhere and everywhere\nis how does it feel\nwhen you're winning and then you\ndiscover you got monsters because that's\nkind of the journey you've been on and I\nwant to go back and forth in this\njourney but I want to start there like\nwhat does it feel like when you're\nwinning you're succeeding but then you\nall of a sudden go I've still got\nmonsters in there you know when you say\nand and use the the word Monsters Just\nfor for clarity so people can understand\nof course we're talking about\num the the different levels to you right\nand um within the levels that I've\ndiscovered in myself uh of myself you\nknow you got your good versions and your\nbad versions and the bad versions I\nrefer to as monsters but just because\nthey're bad doesn't mean they don't have\ngood quality and when you're winning and\nyou're succeeding there's this idea that\neverything is right there's this idea\nthat Perfection is now presenting itself\nin life moving forward is going to be\njust an easy Road\num and it's not until you're in that\nposition where you expect perfection and\nyou think that that you start to see the\ntrue problems and flaws really present\nthemselves and you know my monsters have\nbeen\num masked in Disguise and in various\ndifferent ways but I've been able to to\npinpoint them throughout the years\num because some of those monsters uh\ngrew it got stronger\num developed you're talking about the\nworld of an ego the the the idea of of\nwho you think you are versus what you\nare or\num the idea of expectations and needs as\nto what you feel you need and what you\nhave to have that's a that's a monster\nthat's feeding that right that that\nengine of well now that I'm making money\nthis is what I should have this is how I\nshould look this is how I'm supposed to\nbe that's a monster that you're feeding\nbecause ultimately you're buying in to\nsomething that you're creating you're\nyou're enhancing this world of thought\nand it's not till you sit down and you\ntake a breather and you start to really\nkind of you start to really figure out\nthe true definition of happiness for you\nyou start to really understand\nuh the adult that you have grown into\nand the level of maturity that has now I\nguess you can say have been banked\ninside the the the the human that you\nare it's you're banking so much over the\nyears and ultimately you're shaping and\nmolding yourself into this this grounded\nhopefully this grounded individual that\nyou're proud to look at in the mirror at\nthe end of the day\nI had to start to I had to get to a\nplace to where I was looking in the\nmirror and I was proud of what I was\nlooking at and I was okay with checking\nmyself I was okay with\num pointing out my flaws I was okay with\nknowing would I do well and what I do\nwrong and at the end of the day there's\nno consequence to always improving\nthere's no consequence to Growing you're\nin a time now where people almost frown\nupon the world of growth I embraced that\nI embraced the world of Correction so\nthe monsters in the world of how to tame\nthem came from me understanding the\ndifferent levels of monsters that\npresented themselves to me over the\nyears and me getting them to a point to\nwhere I put them in a place where I\ncould control them they're still there\nthey can rear their heads but I can say\nsit down that's not necessary that's not\nneeded and I can tell when one is trying\nto take me back to a place of old but at\nthe age 43 it's exciting to know that\nI've grown from so much and and you know\nthe the world of want is significantly\ndifferent than what it once was it's\nreally interesting you use the analogy\nof like looking in the mirror and being\nokay with yourself and when you said\nthat I was thinking yeah when you look\nin the mirror there's no Trophies the\nreflection doesn't show the trophies the\nwins the money the whatever else it just\nshows you you and the fact that you've\nhad the courage to look at that where do\nyou think when you track back I've\nalways been fascinated by memories that\nwe hold from our childhood that have\nleft an imprint that's really strong in\nour lives whether it be positive\nchallenging whatever it may be what's a\nwhat's a difficult memory from childhood\ndo you think that has been the Catalyst\nfor so many things in your life is there\nanything that you go back to that you're\nlike I can see how that and I had to\nturn that into a positive I think the\nbiggest memory for me is the the one of\nbeing complacent you know as a child I I\nwasn't really a kid that embrace the\nworld of challenge right I was very\ncomplacent I was okay with being a\nsubpar to low\naverage student right I was okay with\nnot trying I was okay with not giving my\nall and I was kind of okay with getting\nover right so the biggest memory that I\nhave in my childhood is like when I got\nto that early teen years that 12 that 13\nat 14 being sneaky and thinking that\nyou're constantly\none-upping someone was the the that's\nwhat I was embracing at the highest\nlevel do your homework I did it did you\nreally do your homework I did it and you\ntaking my word for it and not checking\nmy homework oh I didn't do it but you\nthink I did I got over uh ultimately\nyou're you're slowly cheating yourself\nover the course of years and it's not\nuntil you get a reality check as to why\nthat work was necessary that you realize\nyou're just not doing what you're\nsupposed to do with your life right\nyou're not you're not giving your all I\nhad a lot of different examples of that\nI truly had a mom that made sure that I\nhad and I didn't take advantage or\nEmbrace\num the real work that she put in until I\ngot to an older age of true\nunderstanding but to be honest I really\nthrew a lot of those things to the side\nthe extracurricular activities the swim\nteams the the football teams the\nbasketball teams the track and field the\nbaseball all of these things as a kid\nyou don't understand your parents are\ndoing to try to provide you with a world\nof opportunity they're trying to keep\nyou occupied they're trying to embrace\nthis idea of hard work effort activity\nengage they're doing all those things or\nall of these things to their kids or\nhopefully right for their kids to put\ntheir kids in a position to just want\nright want the best compete study learn\nbe excited about their future that light\nbulb went off late thankfully when it\nwent off it went off at the the right\ntime and I was able to identify a lot of\nstuff that I couldn't then and also\nthankfully that a lot of the lessons\nthat my mom constantly embedded in me\nabout you don't start things that you're\nnot going to finish you don't quit apply\nyour all do this or don't do it you're\nnot cheating anybody but yourself all of\nthese things that I heard over the\ncourse of time there was a moment when I\ngot older\nit it it all hit at the same time but\nthe real memory for me now looking back\nis I'm glad that I do see that that I am\naware of that\nbecause not being aware of that is the\nhugest loss\nthinking that I took full advantage\nthinking that I really applied or tried\nmyself thinking that that was a hundred\npercent would be the real loss so one of\nmy best memories is knowing that at one\npoint I was a slagger you know I was the\nguy that wanted to look like he was\ndoing but never truly was unless it was\nsomething that I loved and embraced and\nyou know that was basketball but the\nchances of me making that were very slow\nbut you know that's to answer your\nquestion it's a ballpark of those\nmemories that I now look back on that I\nappreciate but it also act as the fuel\nfor the hard work and the hundred\npercent that you see that I put in\neverything I do today yeah that's such a\ngreat reframe around what you saw as a\nbigger loss I think that's so powerful\nfor you to sit here and say\nactually I'm really happy that I can see\nthat I wasn't putting my best foot\nforward because that helps me be\ngrateful to my mom it helps me\nunderstand it from a different\nperspective and the one thing that came\nto mind for me when I'm listening to you\nsay that is there's this quote that says\nthe day you realize your parents were\nright your kids are telling you that\nyou're wrong wow and and that's always\nbeen one of those statements that I\nthink about that in my own self I\nthought my parents were wrong my entire\nTeenage life and I think most teenagers\ndo and then all of a sudden I hit my\nmid-20s and I'm like oh wait a minute my\nmom's been through a lot you know my\nparents put in a lot of sacrifice and so\nI I love that you brought that up I mean\none of the reasons we pushed this show\nback was you lost your father recently\nand when I heard the news obviously you\nknow my love and condolences to your\nfamily and I was I was looking at what\nyou were sharing and and commenting\nabout and there was this one thing that\nyou said that that really stuck with me\nuh and you said that my kids actually\nthink I'm the coolest dad on the planet\nI know why I am the way I am my dad has\na lot to do with that the mistakes that\nmy dad made you know the decisions to do\ndrugs being in and out of jail in and\nout of your lives I saw firsthand what\nnot being present did because of that I\nnow know what being present means I know\nwhat I can do I know what effect it can\nhave when your child coming up but it\nsounded like obviously when you lost\nyour father recently it sounds like\nyou've you'd reconcile like you'd feel\nsomewhat of a connection you know me and\nmy dad we\nwe weren't the closest\num but we weren't not close\nmy dad I at the end of the day I I'm\ngonna love my dad for simply being my\ndad now my dad's life you know had\nseveral different versions of of drastic\nDowns right a small amount of ups but a\nlot of downs I can easily sit here and\nridicule or judge my dad for the\nmistakes that he made or for his past\nbut that does nothing it I don't I don't\nlike to focus on probably my focus on\nsolution yes so with me and my dad in\nour relationship it was always one of\nsolution like you can't go back and fix\nthe years that you weren't present\nthere's there was nothing that we can do\nabout that time we can have a\nconversation about it we can talk about\nit and then me and my dad talking my\nbiggest thing was you don't have to\nfocus on what you can't change the fact\nthat you're here now and that you made a\ndecision to uh get clean to turn your\nlife around it's never too late my dad\nwas you know 50 plus at the time when he\nsaid I'm gonna go ahead and figure it\nout and I'm a I'm gonna close that door\nand I'm gonna work on this other door\nthis door over here was like I said jail\ndrugs\num in and out of his kids life uh to the\npoint where you know there was a there's\na time when we didn't know where my dad\nwas and I I bumped into my dad on the\ntrain I tell a story\num I bumped into my dad on a public\ntransportation in Philadelphia like not\nseeing him in years I've randomly saw my\ndad and my dad was so embarrassed he got\non the train and ran but it's like\nthat's that's where wow that world in\nthat relationship was and what I do very\nwell I don't hold on to grudges or\ngripes\nit takes too much time it takes too much\nenergy things will work themselves out\nthey never not have it always work\nitself out I mean my dad worked it out\nright like\nit's about the grandkids and our\nrelationship got better as he embraced\nthe opportunity to be a great grandpa\nand seeing him try to do that right\nwas his way of saying I wish I could\nhave done this\nright for you\nI can't like I know what you're saying\nwithout saying it sometimes you don't\nyou don't need words although some\npeople do need them sometimes your\nactions are a little better and my dad's\nactions\num and trying his best\nto be an unbelievable grandfather\nmade our father-son relationship that\nmuch better and you know there was a lot\nof conflict between my brother and my\ndad and seeing that men over the time\nand just saying look I'm\nI'm not supposed to be here Dad look at\nwhat your son has done look at where I\nam\nbeing that I can I want to make sure\nthat you get to see some dope things in\nlife here let's do this and take that\nand live like this and do so things work\nthemselves out his reward for giving his\nenergy\nto something positive and life-changing\nwas his son becoming successful in his\nson saying Dad huh\nit's not expected that wasn't the plan\nyou got a great piece of light at the\nend of that dark tunnel that you didn't\nexpect that I didn't expect because I\ndidn't expect to be here so everything\nkind of it works itself out yeah and you\nknow and losing my dad is when you look\nback\nand you go yo he was all right right\nlike my my reflection my conversation my\nwords when I speak on behalf of my\nfather they're so positive and dope\nbecause he did good\nI'm all right\nit came out okay\nmom dad you did good like how whatever\nwhatever you did to to put whatever\nrecipe in this pot the food came out all\nright\nI'm a good person I got a good heart I\ntreat people with respect\nultimately I want the most that I can't\npossibly get out of life I love to love\nI'm a good dude\nam I perfect no\nI got some of them imperfections over\nthere I got some of the ones from over\nhere for my man Dad okay that's life of\ncourse I'ma figure it out but I I figure\nit out without the\nwant or need\nfor\nproblem that's real man I mean I I\nlistening to you say that what I\nappreciate so much is about how\nyou're changing our perspective again\nthat often we feel to heal what was\nbroken needs to be fixed and actually\nwhat you've just said is seeing him try\nwith the grandkids that's not even the\narea that needed fixing or was broken\nbut seeing that starts to create some\nhealing that's the best example that I\ncan ask for yeah because it's not about\nit's not about us right like me and my\nex-wife got to a point of realization\nyou know after having a significant\namount of ups and downs you know after\nour divorce we got to a point where you\nrealize it's not about us\nlike we we did it we had our opportunity\nand we're now adults how we choose to\nlive as adults\nwell that's the choice that we make but\nwe're trying to make the best choices so\nthat they have a better life\nso it's about them\nwhen I see somebody making the efforts\nto make life for them better\nwell then we're on the same page we have\nthe same vision we got the same vision\nyeah yeah it's not it's not about us at\nthis point it's not about us as a\ngeneration at this point it's about us\ntrying our best to do things to create\nchange to move ground shift the gears so\nthat they have a much better opportunity\nthan what we did yeah that's that's the\nworld of the Baton being passed\ncorrectly and if you understand that and\nyou have that mindset you approach your\nday-to-day differently and\nI do I do have that mindset and it's one\nthing that I'm very thankful for\nand\nthrough the things that should be\nproblems that were supposed to be\nproblems\nI've never held on to them long enough\nand by the way just bringing it back\nfull circle that's a monster\nthat Grudge monster that's a monster\nthat I'm gonna get you back I'm gonna\nwait you just watch\nI'ma hold on to that and I'm gonna prove\nto you or imma show you or I'm not\ntalking to nobody over here that's a\nmonster\nso you can feel that monster or that\nmonster doesn't have to have an\nexistence in me it's really really\ninteresting hearing that perspective\nagain because you know one one of my\nfavorite lessons that I've learned is\nthat often the thing that's holding you\nback is something you're holding on to\nyes it's one of my favorite lessons the\nidea that\nsomething you're that's holding you back\nis you're holding on to it so whether\nit's a grudge like you're saying The\nGrudge monster or a feeling or an\nemotion or an idea that you're not\nallowing it to let go when it no longer\nserves you and being able to walk away\nfrom that requires real strength and\ncourage but one of the things that you\nsaid about you and your partner your\nex-wife\nthat I think is really powerful is that\nwhen it's just about us\nwhoever that may be\nyou're either looking at each other or\nyou're looking past each other and what\nyou just said is now we're looking in\nthe same direction when it's the kids\nand so that switch if you think about\nany relationship in our life when we\nthink it's just about us when it's not\nabout anyone else you're always going to\nbe against each other but as soon as\nthere's a higher purpose or there's a\ncommitment or there's a value that\nsupersedes that and understanding and\nunderstanding yeah an understanding that\ncomes with the world of communication\nand great dialogue I can you know and\nhaving this conversation I can point to\nso many examples of how it's so hard to\nsee the good if you're only seeing the\nbad like there's so many people that\nstruggle with with their version of\nsuccesses because they're looking at\nsomeone else's there's so many people\nthat struggle with their world or\nrelationship because they're judging\ntheirs based off of someone else's right\nand when you're constantly in the space\nof not realizing or noticing your world\nyour reality because you're living in\nwhat appears to be someone else's\nwell your [ __ ] is never gonna be right\nit's never gonna be right right like if\nI'm if I'm looking at everybody's\nrelationship with their father and I'm\ngoing I want that yeah well I'm not\nembracing the world of good that came\nfrom my dad I could have went down the\nroad that my dad did I could have easily\nbeen wrapped into the same world of you\nknow drugs gangs\nviolence stick up boys right like the\nembracing The Hood At the highest level\nnot that I don't because I do that's\nwhere I'm from but I could have I could\nhave embraced it at a much higher level\nand followed in the footsteps of my\nfather because that's what he did\num but I was able to\nrealized the mistakes he made I was able\nto go I don't want to go down that\nstreet because I see the consequences of\nit that's a choice that I made right\nsome don't make that choice by the way\nno disrespect to those that haven't it's\nto each his own\num you do what you want based off of who\nyou've seen or what you want to be true\ntoo\nlive your life ultimately we get one\nlive it for you live it to the best to\nthe best space in place that you feel\nyou can win at that's my motto I'm not\nhere to tell you right for wrong I'm\nsaying\nI identify things differently and I make\ndecisions based off of\nexamples that I can look at as not bad\nbut ones that if I didn't have I'm I\ncould have made that mistake yeah so\nwithout a lesson that was intentional my\ndad's giving me lessons yeah right it's\nnot intentional my dad never said I went\nto jail so he didn't have to yeah you\nnever said that\nbut hey man\nsee you in jail that's my wisdom yeah\nwell that just made me realize I don't\nwant to go there yeah hearing how you\ntalk about it hearing how many times you\nwent well I don't want to go there\nseeing what drugs did to you and you\ntalking and telling the stories what you\nlost what you had what you don't well I\ndon't want to do that\nokay you know I'm gonna embrace my\nfather\nI'm going to embrace this imperfect\nhuman being\nbecause I'll be damned if he's not\nif he's not positioning me\nfor\npersonal success and just understanding\nwhat I should and shouldn't do and it\nseems so logical it seems like common\nsense but sometimes it's it's not that\neasy for the son it's not it's not that\neasy yeah and sometimes what I'm hearing\nis sometimes the greatest wisdom is\nunsaid and unintentional right like some\nsometimes the greatest wisdom is not\nwhat someone said to you and sometimes\nthe greatest wisdom is knowing what not\nto do I think we think of it as like\nknowledge or learning means someone's\ntelling me what to do and they told me\nthe right thing sometimes it's looking\nand saying well I know what not to do\nnow and what I'm fascinated doing I\nthink you're going to give people a lot\nof Hope listening to you today\nbecause when you say that you were\ncomplacent growing up and I consider you\ntoday to probably be one of the hottest\nworking people in entertainment from\nwhat I see and observe and when I've\nwatched your interviews or listened to\nyou\nyou work super hard you give it your all\nyou're invested from a mission purpose\npoint of view\nbut hey wait a minute this person says I\nwas complacent growing up and it's never\none moment it's never one thing so I\ndon't even want to simplify it with that\nkind of a question what were the shifts\nthat needed to take place in order for\nyou to go from being complacent to being\none of the hottest working people who's\ncommitted to something I'm big on just\nlike um logic right and\nthere's this there's this like\nmoment that I had\nwhere I I just kept saying why not like\nwhy right and uh Russell Westbrook is a\ngood friend of mine I tease him all the\ntime because the the one saying that he\nhas that I I wish I would have had or I\nwish I I got to First is why not right\nand it's so genius it's so genius it's\nso simple but yet so profound you don't\njust have to have one job and working\nany job and whether a job is a nine or\nfive or whether it's a you know half a\nday full day whatever it is you don't\njust have to do one thing you can do a\nlot of different things but there's this\nweird\nthis is weird mindset that a lot of\npeople have that you can only do one\nthing and when I realized\nI don't have to just do one thing I can\ndo a lot of different things\nyou can be good at a lot of different\nthings but you don't know that you're\ngood at a lot of different things unless\nyou try a lot of different things and\nwhen I looked around and I kind of just\nrealized how the world goes around it's\nall based off of creativity\nit's all based off of ideas it's all\nbased off of\nthought-provoking\nthen groundbreaking\nopportunities but the simplest things\nhave come from an idea from your chair\nto your table to your will to your light\nbulb to your car to your plane to your\nhelicopter\nto the idea of a hotel\nfrom hotels going to a place of people\nrenting out houses and airbnbs to taxis\nto then people\ndriving their own cars and these are all\nideas and the groundbreaking thought\nthat I had in realizing all these ideas\nis that these ideas have the potential\nto touch the sky if a person believes\nthat they can\nif a person believes that they can\nwell your world of idea changes\nyour reason for getting up your reason\nfor putting your feet on the ground\nevery morning it can change if you\nbelieve\nthat the purpose that you now have and\nthat you're working towards\nbased off of an idea\nit's something that you can succeed in I\ngrasp that understanding and I attached\nit to everything that I tried to do I\ndid not set out to be the\nactor the director the writer the\nproducer the CEO the chairman the advise\nI did not set out to do anything things\nand I'm going to make it very clear I\ndon't have the educational background\nfor any of these things\nwhat I had was an idea to try\nand after you get an idea to try what I\nhad was\nthe patience to sit and listen\nbe a sponge\nlearn\nfigure it out um\nand figuring it out\nthere was another side of\nnot being okay with the incomplete\nversion of figuring out the thing that I\ndidn't do\nwell why did I go ask all these\nquestions if I'm not going to try it now\nthat I know how yeah all right let me\nlet me try it\nthe only consequence is failure um by\nthe way not trying is failing yeah well\nI'm gonna make that very clear here not\ntrying it's failing\nthere's a lot of things that people\ncan't do\nsimply because you've never tried to do\nit and I'm not saying that you should\ntry everything I'm not saying that\nyou're supposed to do everything I'm\nsaying that for me\nwhen someone says something and I go now\nI never did that hmm\nI have to have a reason for why I've\nnever done it and a justification if you\nask me something I go no\nand you just say why and I go um\nthat's not good enough for me yeah yeah\nI like to have a reason why and that's\nthat's the foundation that I stand on\nthat's how I built this mindset this\nthis level of energy to go ahead um\nrhyming reason\nwithin my why hmm why not yeah it's the\nRuss again I love you to death my\nbrother it's the one that got away from\nme and you're a genius for saying it\nbecause it's so simple yeah but yet so\nprofound yeah so everything that I'm\ndoing or that I'm attempting to do is\nbecause I started so much and I'm just\ntrying to finish it yeah and\nI like the fact that I'm 43\nand I still got energy behind what it is\nthat I'm trying to do yeah it sounds\nlike it's like\nwhere you're going is not as important\nas who you're growing into for that\ndirection oh my God like the person that\nyou're evolving into the things you have\nto learn the things you have to be\nsurrounded by and I think that's the\npart that I get excited about it's like\nyeah like you said whether you get there\nwhatever there is or not\nand it's not just the journey and the\ndestination because I think that's the\nold cliche but what what I'm really\nhearing from you is\nthe person you grow into the people you\nsurround yourself by in order to reach\nthis big goal that is so fulfilling\nand that Pursuit is worthy right the\npursuit is the happiness it's everything\nyeah\nas I have said this before\nand and you'll hear so many people say\nit that come from where I've come from\nthe bottom or what's considered to be\nthe bottom we are not stereotypically\nsupposed to be in the rooms that we're\nin and when we say that there's a\nthere's a level of comfort right we're\nnot supposed to be in these rooms and\nit's kind of cliche when you say it when\nyou start to get in these rooms you go\nwow why are we not supposed right like\nit's it's so amazing when you get to the\nother side you see the other side and\nyou look back and you just look at what\nyou've grown from the conversations that\nI'm able to have the knowledge that I'm\nable to speak with and the understanding\nI understand not because I'm a trained\nmachine and I spent\nall of this time prepping for and you\nknow this is this is what the the idea\nof Education was all based off of no\nthe idea of Discovery enhanced the\nmuscle that made me want for so much\nmore information in the space of life\nthat I chose to love so an entertainment\nand business\nthe level of failures that I have had\nthat I'm still having in some regard\nthe world of fixing cleaning up making\nbetter understanding growing uh\nrelationships building\nit's there there is nothing more\nintriguing to me than being able to turn\naround and look at Kevin at the age 22\nand then looking at Kevin at the age 43.\nthis was not the plan what are you\ntalking every day is a new day and every\nday I found another thing to be excited\nabout\nevery day I found another goal that I\ndecided to attach to my tree and that\ntree got so many branches on it right\nnow and so many people say you're doing\nso much or\nwhy do you do so much how do you do so\nmuch what is the what's the end game\nwhat's the goal the game is being in the\ngame right like it's it's being in the\ngame\nthe foundation that I'm trying my best\nto create I hope and pray that with\nthese four kids that I have\nthat they look at it they see that they\nunderstand we just got a shot at\nsomething different\nwe got a shot at generational wealth we\ngot a shot\na changing\nthe quote-unquote trajectory within our\nculture of opportunity we got a shot to\nmake this normal\nonce again I'm looking past me I'm\nlooking at I'm looking at the bigger\npiece of the plan\nmy kids got a bigger shot\nat breaking ground in making this normal\nbecause other kids that looked like us\nthat came from where we come from and\nthat grew up how I grew up\nwe'll now have a different level of\nAssociation\nfor what can be achieved if it's based\noff of what I was able to do I'm\nigniting a different level of thought a\ndifferent level of want a different\nlevel of motivation and inspiration I'm\ninspiring at a different level\nabsolutely but I get there and at the\nlast second I miss it and I fall\nI got there\nI got there and all that does is show\nthem that they can get there they're not\ngonna miss and they can go further they\ncan go further they're not gonna miss\nyeah they're equipped with too much of\nthe weapons I've equipped you along the\nway with so much so you're prepared for\nall this war that's coming up here\nyou're not gonna miss\nthat might miss that might fall\nyou're not\nI love that and the kids coming up from\nunder them they're not gonna miss\nbut you have to have this energy yeah\nit's bigger than me what's that what's\nthat one mindset that you're trying to\npass on to that next generation your\nkids the kids that come off to that\nbecause it sounds like while you were\nhonest and saying look I didn't know I\nwas going to be a writer director or\nentrepreneur or a CEO I didn't have\nthese I didn't have the education as you\nsaid but it sounds like you have some\nyou have the mindset that's very clear\nwe know that but there's some core\nskills here that it sounds like you've\ninvested in very deeply and that you're\ntrying to pass on if you could narrow\nthem down to one two or three for us\nwhat would you say are the skills that\nyou're like this is how I want my kids\nto be able to operate in this world and\nthat's what they need the best skill\nthat I have developed is the skill\nof noticing and understanding\nthat nothing is done\nby one individual\nno level of success is reached\nby one person right like this there is a\nteam effort\nthat goes into the smallest moment of\nsuccess to the largest yeah and the\nperson that wants\nthe rewards and it accolades for it all\nand it doesn't embrace the world of team\nand the foundation that stands\nunderneath whatever that thing is is a\nperson that won't last long the thing\nthat I am most thankful for and the\nthing that I that I'm glad that it has\njust improved over the course of time is\nthe world of inclusion with the Wii\nthere's no I and and I hope that that's\nwhat I'm passing down\nto my kids is that you know\nnothing is given everything is earned\nand for things to be earned correctly\nyou know you you have to surround\nyourself with people\nthat you can not only earn with\nbut that will support and embrace\nalong the way right I have an amazing\nteam\nout to my team grows to be the stars of\ntomorrow\nfrom execs to creatives to talent to\nwriters producers directors everybody\nthat's underneath this umbrella of\nheartbeat of heartbeat ventures of the\nbrands and the brand Partnerships and\nthe space of entertainment and this\necosystem within media that we've\ncreated we've flourish because they\nflourish and knowing that identifying\nthat and trying my best to support that\nthat's the thing that I have had to work\non and when we talk about monsters Jay\nthere was a it was an eye monster yeah\nthere was a I need to do it yeah I'm\ngonna make the call me first I gotta I'm\na boat I'm I know\neverybody move watch out I'm gonna show\ny'all how to do it I'm gonna take the\nmeeting hit we're not listening to that\nwe're gonna do it my way it was this\nheavy thing of\nme I I\nI I\ngot the way Kevin\nget out the way and let other people be\ngreat they're only going to make this\nthing greater you're prohibiting that by\ntrying to stand in a moment of of great\nso that people can look and point at you\nlet other people do the thing that they\nwere brought here to do and while they\ndo it align yourself with them embrace\nthem support them\nand as they grow we grow yeah that's the\nthing that I flourish in the most which\nis why the first thing that I asked you\nyeah think about it the first thing that\nI asked you when we're hearing was\nsetting up I said how long have you guys\nbeen together yeah that's just me asking\nbecause I want to see what the world of\nyour team is yeah and when you say what\nyou say well there's no coincidence that\nthe level of success comes with a\nrelationships that's evolved from day to\nset date yes it comes with an\nunderstanding that comes with a level of\ncommunity more importantly a want for\nsuccessful we have it together because\nwe're embracing the world it's not just\none I love that you went there man like\nthat there could have been so many ways\nto answer that question\nand the fact that you brought it back to\nbeing bigger than you I mean that\nmindset\nI mean that mind says everything but\nit's so easily missed because we grow up\nin a doggy dog Society we grow up in a\nyou versus me I feel like when I speak\nto people in the entertainment industry\nas well for years especially if you were\na minority or a person of color you were\nput against the only other person of\ncolor absolutely and so it's like there\ncan be only one person of color comedian\nthey can only be one person of color\nactor right like it's all divided and so\nyou talked about this I already talked\nabout this it was oh wow it's you know\nDave Chris myself we're very close yeah\nand I love seeing that that makes me\nhappy the reason why I was so close is\nbecause you know there is no competition\nwe're not we're not competing with one\nanother and you know we all have\ndifferent level of success that makes\nsense for\nfor us right like one success has\nnothing to do with the other yeah and\nthe support the love that we give each\nother that we Embrace each other with\nit's it's all done with the\nunderstanding that we can all exist at\nthe same time yeah and the conversation\nof there can only be one is one that\nwe've created as a culture like you know\nwe really do Pit our own against our own\nright we we really have done it\nthroughout the time and by the way\nthere's nothing wrong with competition\nthere's nothing wrong absolutely with\nwanting to be the best there's nothing\nwrong with that conversation but it's\nit's a conversation that can be had and\nshould be had without the malicious\nintent behind it right because\num ultimately\nsuccess is success and that's what\nyou're that's what you're in the game\nfor yeah to have some type of level of\nsuccess that checks the box for you yeah\nand you know once again if you get to\nlooking\nacross the street and you're looking at\nwhat the others are doing over there or\nyou're missing what you've done over\nhere and I I just it's something that I\nthink over the course of time\nhas developed uh it didn't start off\nlike this I definitely was once again\nand being transparent I was a young\ncomic that was like man when am I gonna\nget my turn yeah I'm funny I'm funnier\nthan I need that I don't understand oh\nmy God nobody want like you do go\nthrough that and rightfully so there's\nfrustration in not knowing or not\nunderstanding why my opportunity hasn't\nor isn't there's frustration in that but\nthere's also a sense of calm that comes\nin confidence of knowing that you're\nputting the work in for a reason and\nthat it will pay off yeah and I had to\nmake that change yeah I had to make the\nchange of saying I'm doing work am I\nshowing up every day and am I prepared\nand if this opportunity does come am I\nready for it because there's nothing\nworse than it comes and I don't have a\nset\nI don't have a tight five minutes I\ndon't have a tight 10. I didn't have a\n25 minute set oh my God they wanted to\nclean material I didn't have no clean\nmaterial there's nothing worse than not\nbeing ready oh my God so you know what\nI'm gonna do\nI'ma do the work and make sure I'm ready\nlet me go take these acting classes\nbefore I even got an acting role\nI'm sitting a damn acting class I'm\nspending a little bit of money I got\ndoing one-on-one sessions because I\nwasn't comfortable being in the class I\nhad to get the space of comfort I don't\nhave any roles\nI didn't have any auditions yet\nI'm doing the work so that when I get\nthere I don't have to go backwards and\ndo it yeah I love that mindset I think\nthat is so underrated of are you even\nready if the opportunity came knocking\nare you even ready and two things that I\ntook away from that the first was\nsomething you said about you Chris and\nDave which and I love hearing about that\nfriendship it's so beautiful to hear\nabout that uh I read something from Bob\nIger where he was talking about how at\none point\nSpielberg George Lucas and I think it\nwas Tarantino they would show each other\ntheir movies before it went anywhere so\nthey'd sit in this tiny little theater\nor whatever they'd show each other their\nmovies give each other feedback and then\nthey'd all launch their movies and of\ncourse all of those people are you know\nI mean icons and it's unbelievable\nbecause you think they were so confident\nin who they were and what their style\nwas I mean a Spielberg movie doesn't\nlook like Lucas movie and a Lucas movie\ndoesn't look like a Tarantino movie they\nwere so confident in who they were and\nwhat they brought to the table that they\ncould even show their best work I I\ntrust your level of understanding\nopinion and story\nin the highest regard that even though\nwe don't share\nthe same love for\ngenre material whatever whatever you\nwant to call it right like uh whether\nit's sci-fi to drama to action like\nthese are all like you said different\npeople but you know story you know\ncharacter I trust that you'll be able to\nwatch my project tell me if my\ncharacters are easy to track and if you\ncare and if you don't care I also trust\nthat you'll be able to tell me why you\nfelt you didn't I also feel that in the\nspace of solution you're not going to\nthrow things at me that are not doable\nyou're gonna know the context of what I\nhave that I'm working with what's left\non The Cutting Room floor what I can\npossibly do to do reshoots everything\nthat you're going to tell me is within\nregards of having my best interest\nthat's confidence that's also a strong\nrelationship and a friendship that along\nthe Journey of success as we've all\ngotten to the top of this mountain we\nunderstand that your stance on your\nMountain has nothing to do with mines\nDave Chappelle\nhas made me and Chris Rock feel stupid\nat times when it comes to our choice of\nmaterial we have watched Dave in our\nearlier uh stages of just working on our\nset and we would spend time with the\nseller and one would come and we would\nall go and Dave would go up and me and\nChris just went up and we're happy about\nour material we're giving each other\nnotes we watched Dave there's been times\nwe have looked at each other and we\nballed our papers up and said we got to\nstart over we got to start over yeah not\nbecause of of jealousy or Envy no\nbecause we challenge each other and we\nwe we spark and amp the world of like we\nwant the best for not only each other\nbut for ourselves yeah and and you\ninspire me and you encourage me and\nI love the report that we have because\nwe do exactly the same thing yeah I\nthink my hour is ready I want you to\ncome see me Kristen what you think yeah\nKev I like it but I still think you can\nKev come see me I'm doing an hour and 40\nright now hour 40. yeah yeah tell me\nwhat you think I'm probably gonna trim\n20 out of it I like where it is all\nright I'm coming Dave what's up come to\nOhio\nyou don't like what I'm working on I\nwant your eyes all right like this\nthat's a that's a strong relationship\nand it's one that I embrace\num and I celebrate it often man I\ncelebrated often I think it's very\nimportant for people to see other\nentertainers at this level just simply\ncelebrate each other's success I love it\nwhether it's rappers singers actors\nactresses comedians writers directors\nwhoever I love to see a room where\npeople are in it and they're celebrating\none another mm-hmm\nwe're all a part of a fraternity and you\nknow if we treat it right that\nfraternity will have an amazing stance\nforever yeah right like you don't want\nto attach bad stories to it if we don't\nhave to yeah and I think that's the most\ninspiring thing for the kids because\nwhen I think about younger Generations\nif you grew up watching your favorite\npeople and you knew they were all\nfriends how does that change the game\nnow because if you're seeing your\nfavorite people fight each other and\nbattle it out for the crown what are you\ngoing to do with the person sitting\nright next to you at school and I think\nthat's I saw that so much growing up\nwhere I've always wanted to connect with\npeople regardless of what we do in this\nspace but you saw so many people who are\ncoming at it from the perspective of\nlet's see who does better let's see who\ndoes more and again I love what you said\ncompetition's not a bad thing let's not\ngive it a bad name but the idea that\nwe've got to be able to hold two truths\nwe can compete and still be friends\nstill be friends and and I think people\nwould be friends yeah you have to choose\nbut yeah you know there was a time\num where the uh the USA men's swim team\nthe Olympic team this team was just so\nElite and this is in phelps's like yeah\nPhelps was Phelps a human fish right\nbut when you look at a lot and you look\nat the other men that were competing on\nthat team\nand he looked at the world of\ncompetition between them\nthemselves\nthose practices were more than just\npractices\nthe the world of training before the\nOlympics and the battles that took place\nin those pools where they got ready and\nthey were by each other's side every\nsingle day when I tell you that\natmosphere\nis one that nobody else can understand\nexcept the ones that are competing to be\ngreat by the way at the end of every\npractice they would get out and shake\neach other's hands without me being here\nI'm willing to bet and say good when you\npush me today you kick my ass today hey\ntomorrow man I'ma see if I can lower my\ntime I'm not happy with my 200. I'll go\nI'll do it with you I'll push you hey my\nback stroke is whatever hey you know\nwhat today uh on those 50s we did the\nReps you seemed like you got stronger\nalong the way well I saw you next to me\nthat motivation that motivation that\nyou're pulling from being alongside of\nsomebody that's quote unquote the best\nor or the quote-unquote greatest you're\nusing that as fuel that's not bad but\nnot in one interview did you ever see\nthem have any type of Rapport that\nlooked as if there was animosity or\nanger towards one's success the happiest\npeople for Michael Phelps were the\npeople on this team the happiest people\nwere the people that that got the silver\nthat were on his team yeah that to me\nfeet that's the mold in the making of\nreal champions right yeah that's the\nmold in the making like if if you're in\nit and you have said this is what I'm\ndestined to do and I'm gonna give my all\nand every day I show up with a hundred\npercent regardless of the outcome I'm\nshowing up with a hundred percent that\nday Gonna Come\nwhenever it comes\nI'm Gonna Be Ready It's Gonna Come\nI'm gonna get my just doing my\nfulfilling my fulfilling like need and\nenergy and want for knowing that I have\njust delivered for myself that's what I\ncompete with that's why I look at the\nmirror yeah sometimes I let myself down\nbecause the thing that I'm trying to do\nI should know I can't redo yeah\nsometimes I'm chasing the thing that\ncan't be redone again sometimes the\nlightning in the bottle strikes once\nyou're not going to get that again\nthere's times where I'm so hard on\nmyself\nthat I miss the moments of success that\nI should realize that I'm having yeah\nbecause I'm chasing this thing yeah it's\na time where I was doing two shows and\nArenas a night\nfour shows in the city and arenas\nas a comedian\ngo back on tour the next one I only do\ntwo shows oh my God I'm falling off\nwhat's happening no sold out six seven\nshows Madison Square Garden what I feel\nbad cause I didn't do it again that\nain't gonna happen again that was\nlightning in the bottle you gotta get to\na place of understanding and realization\nbut once again it's the monsters man\nyeah it's the monsters it's uh it's the\nmonsters yeah you talk about this in the\naudiobook and I loved it it was all\nabout the addiction to number one yeah\nit's this this idea and you'll love this\nthere was a study that I saw that said\nbecause you brought up the Olympics it\nspot my brain\nthere's a study that I saw that said\npeople who win bronze are happier than\npeople who win silver\nbecause the people who came second were\nthis close to First oh my God yeah but\nthe person who came third they they were\nhappy they were like we weren't gonna\nget first but we got in we got on the\npodium and it's that Podium syndrome of\nat least we got on but the second the\nperson in silver\nthey are mad at themselves yeah because\nthey didn't get number one yeah and so\nthat addiction to number one is so\nstrong it's a bigger addiction when\nthere's multiple versions of it yeah I'm\nguilty of the multiple like okay I need\nit got a movie coming out\nmoving on the box so I need it I need\nnumber one I don't get number one I'm\ngonna fail like it failed you flop I\ndon't get number one over five it's a\nflop I gotta get him one yeah it's one\nor a floor there's no in between yeah\nit's one or five like I've always kind\nof one it's got to be number one yeah\nwhat happens is you're you're so you're\nso unrealistic in expectations\nand you're missing real success\nnow I've been fortunate and blessed\nenough to have a uh a ton of them\nbut I got to a place where the the wind\nwas attached to the project the wind was\nattached to\nme finishing a movie and being happy\nabout the movie that I did union workers\nare happy and a director coming out with\nthe finished piece of the product going\nyou're gonna like this and we see it we\nactually like it and then we screen it\nfor fans and fans go we loved that's the\nwin yeah\nthat's the win this this other thing and\nI'm trying to control Kev stop you can't\ncontrol that and and if you keep on\ngoing in the direction that you're going\nin\nif and when that thing changes you're\ngoing to be so hurt\nthat the world of recovery might not be\neasy for you your logic and what you're\nnow deeming as like reality for you it's\nnot reality yeah if you don't grasp the\nreal concept of what it should be now it\ndoesn't mean that you're saying that you\nare ready to fail it's saying be\nprepared for the world of real to\npresent itself at any point in time\ndon't get caught up in the world of fake\nand me acting as if I control these\nnumbers is if I can navigate and direct\nand and and make it happen when and how\nI want all the time\nI'm setting myself up so you know what\nI'm gonna do I'm gonna check myself now\nyeah let me balance it out now huge what\nare you doing\nI love what I do\nall right well then let's be happy in\nwhat we do I talked to David Letterman\non uh my my comedy podcast so I come to\ngold mines\nand Letterman said he was so dark at one\npoint\nbecause all he did was show up and he\nlooked at the numbers between him and\nthe other shows every day God that's\npainful every day my Instagram numbers\nhe said every day I got there and I\nlooked at it and and I would my team\nyou're not working hard enough and I was\nso hard he said I'm so hard on people\nand when you hear them talk love David\nby the way I don't know the Lettermen of\nold that some people ran into I know the\nLettermen of now and he's so transparent\nthe information and how he talks and\nwhat he's overcome his stories were just\nit was so good to hear\nbecause when you hear people that are\nopenly telling you you can't do this you\ncan't operate like this because it eats\naway at you it eats away it made me\nrealize I did go through a piece of that\nI just was able to catch mine early and\nin the worry of like we might fail\nwe risk being open to being broken right\nlike that's the risk like you don't want\nto go down but you don't realize that if\nyou're not prepared for that down the\ndown is going to be far worse it's gonna\nbe far worse man yeah we have had a live\nexample of a lot of those Downs right\nlike with in real time we're watching I\ncalled The Truman Show uh and for\neverybody listening to your podcast if\nyou're not familiar with The Truman Show\nit's a it's a Jim Carrey movie but\nbasically you know people's lives it's\nthe movie yeah right we're watching\nwe're watching real live movies every\nsingle day and you're watching people\nmake mistakes recover from mistakes not\nrecover from mistakes make rights\ninstead of lefts lefts instead of Rights\nand seeing that we choose to ignore it\nas if it's not real life yeah yeah yeah\nwe choose to ignore it because it feels\nlike it's TV and the biggest drug\nthe biggest drug it's not cocaine it's\nnot heroin it's not uh Molly or opioids\nand the biggest drug\nis Fame and now it's more accessible and\ndifferent doses it's the biggest drug\nand the reason why it's the biggest drug\nbecause it's a drug that makes you feel\nlike you are powerful and like\neverywhere you go anything you want\neverything you want it's it's a thing\nand if you can't handle this thing the\nconsequence is attached yeah to when\nthat thing is removed are severe nobody\nprepares you\nfor the world of Fame there is no\nhandbook there is no outline there is no\nguide by guide step one to step ten\nthere's nothing you get it\nand yesterday you weren't and today you\nare\nand tomorrow you're not what no we're\ndone people get shell shocked\nthat to me\nhas always been\nthe point of no return yeah at the end\nof the day this can wear off if and when\nhowever sees or decides in if that were\nto happen well what am I where am I\nit's all gonna it's all going to send it\nback to are you happy with who you are\nand what you did are you at a point\nwhere you are okay\ndo you know you and are you okay with\nyou if you are not it'll break you your\nenergy is incredible and and just the\ndepth what I love about this and this\nwas my vision with the show and you're\nhelping me achieve that which I'm very\ngrateful for is I don't think and I love\nthat you've been doing this more and\nmore with the audible with hot to hot\nlike we're getting to see your depth\nwe're getting to see the Mind behind you\nagain as we said earlier we like to\nlimit people we like to limit people\ninto like you just be a comedian or you\njust be a race car driver or you just be\na actor and it's like we're starting to\nrealize that like you said you're not\njust watching someone's life on TV\nthere's a human here there's there's a\nstory here and we're getting that with\nyou do you think it was was this\nsomething was this an epiphany that you\nhad before the accident or was it that\nthis really because in your audible when\nyou talk about like how when it's just\nsilent you figure out what really\nmatters like when I heard that\nI was just thinking like\nour near-death experiences you were told\nwhen you came out of it you should be\ndead and you're like well I don't\nremember anything does that feel like\nthat was a moment that there is a\nmassive Awakening or were you already\nkind of working with some of this no I I\nhad a I was always a transparent and\nauthentic person but yeah\nyou definitely change that's what right\nyou you definitely changed and by the\nway still changing I'm not sitting in\nfront of us yes to flawed man like I I\nam my dad's child and my my mother's\nchild as well there's nothing more\nhumbling\nthan a quiet room there's nothing more\nhumbling\nthan the realization\nof what\nis really like necessary what you take\nfor granted and what we don't think\ntwice about is not until that's\ncompromised that the true appreciation\nfor life I feel like can sometimes be\nhad I don't want to speak for everybody\nbecause I think there are some people\nthat truly do\nget it and that truly do think whatever\ntheir space\num or version of a higher power is daily\nfor life and for what they do you know I\nbelieve in God so I'm I'm not as\nspiritual as some may be but I'm very\nthankful for the life that God has\nallowed me to to live and the\nopportunities that I've been able to\nEmbark upon but I got a lot more\nappreciation\nafter\nlife was almost gone right like do you\nreally appreciate your toes do you\nreally appreciates your fingers like you\nreally think about your movement\nyour joints Vision smell you really\nthink about how fortunate\nand and lucky you are it's the only time\nwhere I get a little\nwhere I slow up right and when when I'm\nslowing up is because the reality of\nthat\nwas significant I really almost died my\nkids and all that like what as I'm\nmoving so fast I didn't even have\neverything\ndialed up for if said thing were to\nhappen what what\noh cause I'm I'm out here\nI'm just roaming I'm out here aimlessly\nliving and I'm moving so fast I've yet\nto grasp\nthe true Concept in reality\na responsibility immediately\nlet me get my responsibilities in order\nbecause if that had have been it would\nhave been a lot of people with their\nhands up as to what\nhow when Fame is great the lights are\ngreat have a heart can my heart give a\nheart number one one of one that was in\nthat room\nwith my goddamn wife my brother my kids\nyou look around\nyou got a lot of friends you got a lot\nof people that love you but then you\nstart well what really matters that's\nwhen my mindset started to change\nthat's when\nyou go okay\nmy approach to just me and working on me\nit needs to be different\nI've contradicted myself a lot since\nyou know\nI want to slow down I'm gonna make sure\nI get my family more time I have that\ndoesn't mean that there can't be more\n[Music]\nthe day-to-day Battle of am I giving\nenough am I that's you know how much dad\nloves you I'm here I'm like you know\nalways working to make sure do more but\nis it enough\nmy workaholic okay but that's not a bad\nthing because I'm you love the word yes\nyou do that's a passion you get you got\nsomething that you go after every day\nthat is a driving source for me I'm not\nin the business of letting that go but\nboy you better put your hands on these\npeople and make sure\nyou better make sure that you are giving\nthe time\nthat you said you would when you were in\nthat time of Silence okay all right I'm\nconstantly talking to myself I have\nthese conversations all the time that's\nthe beauty of taking my little runs the\nbeauty of working out being in the gym\nyou talk to yourself you better talk to\nyourself\nyou better have conversations figure out\na yin and yang of good and bad for me\nit was about personal involvement after\nthat accident\nand still trying man it's the biggest\nbattle it's the big the biggest battle\nis just doing right all the time that's\na battle and knowing you're gonna get it\nwrong that's a battle man when I go to a\nrestaurant\nand they bring out a plate the waiters\nsay it all the time don't touch that\nplate to play Hot you know what I do Jay\nyou know what I say after I touch it it\nwasn't hot yeah\nthey told me not to touch the plate yeah\nhe said it's hot yeah\nbut I still gotta I still gotta go\nuntouch the plate anyway it's a battle\nso being okay with understanding that\nI'm going to lose and win in this battle\nand this battle is not over\nuntil the day I'm in the ground\nbecause you're not gonna get it right\nnope\nyou're not gonna get it right\nand there's people with this idea\nand his mindset and mentality\nthey're going to get it right and\neverything's gonna be perfect it's not\ndon't play that perfect game\nbecause all you will do is get let down\nbecause Perfection does not exist I do\nfirmly stand on that and believe that it\ndoesn't exist man you should try your\nhardest\nto get things right in moments where you\ngot them wrong figure out how to never\nget them wrong again that's the that's\nthe world of compromise that's the world\nof growth\nthat's the world of evolvement um\nI mean I got a teenage daughter nobody\nprepared me for the world of you know\nlike you talking about gotta get it\nright\nare we talking enough am I loving enough\nam I present am I listening\nam I just delegating am I parenting am I\nyour friend am I there's so much yes so\nmuch teenage son little ones I mean my\nwife it's a constant battle\nof energy and as a guy who\nis an output right\nand I don't complain about that output\nbut those that I'm taking in from\nI just gotta I gotta make sure that I'm\nreceiving that\nand that I'm not moving too fast I'm not\nmaking the most of those moments and\nthat's this level of Consciousness I did\nnot have before the accident\nI was I was a thousand miles per hour\nand not that I'm not still moving fast\nbut I look at my peripheral yeah I'm\nlooking at my rear view mirrors\nslowing down I'm stopping\nI'm sleeping\nyou know what I mean like I'm there is a\ndifference I know there's a difference\nbut it's still a battle yeah it's still\na battle it's still a battle Yeah I love\nthat you describe it like a battle\nbecause\nwhat you just described is exactly the\npractice we have to have every day which\nis you have to revisit\nhow do I get it right today there isn't\na day where now you just get it right\nfrom now till the end of time it's\nrevisiting that every day saying I'm\nrecommitting to this I'm going to be a\ngood dad today right you don't get to\nmake a decision to be a good dad in 10\nyears you have to do today and then you\ndo tomorrow and and I think that\nwhat's what's really interesting the\nreason why I asked that question too was\nbecause I think memory is such an\ninteresting thing sometimes when\nsomething big happens to us\nwe feel the shift that this is going to\nchange how I think and then all of a\nsudden when things go back to normality\nit can sometimes feel as if it never\nhappened but it sounds like for you\nyou've really used it as an anchor well\nI did yeah you've used it it's even when\nyou say like you said like I'm going to\nbe a good dad today yeah right you can\nonly try your best try your best yeah to\ndo that ultimately just because you say\nyou're a good dad don't make you a good\ndad no of course not don't you say\nyou're a good boss to me you're a good\nboss I can say it every day I can think\nI'm doing it but if on the opposite side\nif I'm viewed differently well that will\nbe because I'm doing something wrong and\nI'm not aware what I now do is make sure\nthat I'm looking at things through both\nlenses it's not a one-sided POV I love\nthat it's not it's not just my\nperception of what I'm doing and how\neverybody else should see it yeah and\ndoing that the the way that I try my\nbest to back up the the hope of me be\nbeing perceived as that is about putting\na true work in to be that yeah yeah\nmaking sure that I'm really engaged with\nthe other people making sure there's a\nrapport that there's energy\num and you know the wife and kids the\nsame thing making sure that there's a\nrapport that there's you know I'm asking\nthe questions and I'm getting the\nanswers but I'm I'm asking for things so\nI can get the proper feedback so that if\nI do need to adjust or if I do need to\nfix at least I'm aware\num operating\num with the assumption that you are or\nthat you're doing it can be a a crutch\nlike it can be it can be a bad thing if\nI'm operating with the Assumption\nbecause one day you'll wake up and\nthey'll go you know I never liked win or\nwe're acting as a problem for me for all\nthese years was when you and then you\njust go I never knew you never said\nnothing yeah and sometimes people don't\nwant to say anything sometimes people\ndon't know how to say anything so the\nworld of dialogue communication and just\nopenness is what I think I've gotten\nbetter at yeah over the time but once\nagain what it's a it's a constant space\nof\nImprovement yeah you're constantly\ntrying to improve yeah and that's and\nthat's that is the only way it can be\nthere is no other alternative and\nthere's a beautiful conversation between\nthe Buddha and a student that I love and\nthe student approaches the Buddha and\nsays what's the difference between I\nlike you and I love you\nand the Buddha says when you like a\nflower you simply pluck it but when you\nlove a flower you water it every day and\nI'm like that to me is what you're\ndescribing that when I love my kids I\nhave to be trying every day to\nunderstand from their point of view the\nflower is going to show you whether\nyou're watering or not it's gonna die\nit's gonna will it's gonna not bloom or\nwhatever it may be and I feel like\nyou've got to be so in tune with\nyourself and someone else in order to\nsense that but I I know what you're\nsaying is true true and I really do\nrecommend this to anyone who's a big fan\nof Kevin's as I am please do go listen\nto the audiobook because\nmonsters and how to tame them I mean I\nhave never heard someone be as open and\ntransparent as you are in it and you're\nso open about all your flaws and there's\none thing that you say here that again\njust I was like I have to talk to you\nabout this because it was just it stuck\nwith me and you talk about it and you\nsay you know and you're just talking\nabout the fame and that's that's where\nthe idea came for you just talk about\nhow Fame makes you feel invincible\nand then when you talk about getting\ncaught cheating and you're like I was in\nthat frame of mind where I was like it\ncan't happen to me right it's not\npossible\nand then you open about it so raw and in\nmy head I'm thinking what is it about\nthe monster\nthat gets you to do things even that are\nagainst your own values right like the\nmonster gets so strong that you go as\nfar as that and when you get caught you\ngo that was an Awakening but it still\ndoesn't wake you up fully right there's\nthere's a limitation so walk us through\nthat well I mean look you're talking\nabout Fame you're talking about power\nright and that idea of invincible\nonce again this is a this is a thing\nthat\na very small percentage of people are\ngoing to be able to experience or\nunderstand right and it's very easy from\nthe outside looking in\nto go\nor how or I don't believe or how can\nright\num\nbut from the other side\nnot that it's\nright first of all wrong is wrong you're\nnever gonna hear me\ntry to justify or excuse wrong is wrong\nbut in being wrong\nsometimes comes with a world of\nsituation the world of opportunity right\nif you constantly around bad apples\nand you hungry and people keep saying\ndon't eat these apples\nsome people are going to be able to hold\noff but you have some people that are\ngoing to pick up that apple and bite it\nit's not right it's not something that's\njustifiable to some what's the worst is\ngoing to happen\nI'ma eat it and then what I'll probably\nbe sick for a second and I'll throw up\nand then I'll be fine\nwell that Apple killed you but your way\nof looking at it in that moment I'll be\nfine the idea that comes with that level\nof success and that comes with\nopportunity based on situation is one\nthat you look at is I'd be fine it's\neasy it's nothing but um\nit's not to your hand is in the pot and\nyou get burned or caught or whatever you\nknow that you got to sit down and then\nyou got to think about it you gotta you\ngotta look at it and then you realize\nthe layers that are attached to it and\nthat's when the life-changing side of\nthought happens right and\nthen it becomes about you or how you\nlook at yourself how do you view\nyourself and\nwhat do you expect from yourself right\nit's not it's bigger than just the\npartner of course that you want to\nrespect it's also about you and how you\nwant to be viewed at that point like\nwhat what's important where where are\nyou at\nwhere are you at with with you\nin that mirror you get to look into that\nmirror\nyou know if you all right but what\nyou're looking at and you're fine\nflawed and all and all right yeah\ngetting older put you in a position\nto where you just start to look at\nyourself and you're talking about the\ncomplete finished product that is and\nwill be you those are the moments that\nyou just got to do your best to not only\novercome but just get by yeah and and\nyou know once again it's a battle Yeah\nright marriage love you got to learn it\nand at a young age when you're embedded\ninto it you're not going to get it right\nyou got to learn it\nit's unfortunate\nhow the lessons come\nfrom whichever side however it happens\nbut when learned or\nwhen\ntaken as serious as it can be of course\nyou reap the benefits and you see how\namazing it is but you know I I wasn't\nthat smart and I'm not going to act as\nif I was and that's from my first\nmarriage to that it's is it is it hard\nto forgiving yourself or is it harder\nasking for forgiveness I think it's\nI can be hard on myself\nI can stand in the fire\nhaving another person do it\nthat's where it gets tough right like\nyou throw rocks at me all day when the\nother person is in there I think that's\nthat's a different level and the\nmistakes that I've made in my life\nthe biggest side of consequence\nhas always been the effect that it's had\non others I'll\nfigure it out and\ndo my best to evolve and grow and\nhowever that has to happen with me but I\ncan't dictate hmm\nhow you would receive and how you would\nhandle or how you would do so you know\nwatching other people hurt that's never\ngood I think that would be ever the\ntoughest side of it yeah right that's a\nreally thoughtful on somebody yeah I I\nfeel like that's that genuine\nCompassionate Heart saying I know I can\nfigure my way out but why would I put\nsomeone in a situation where they have\nto figure it out for themselves it was\nsomeone was reading me a quote the other\nday and it was like saying how\nI think it was Nietzsche who was saying\nI wish pain and suffering on anyone\nbecause that's what helps them grow and\nI was like hold up a second yeah I was\nlike I was like I would not wish Jesus I\nwas like yeah it was someone really out\nto me and I was like I was like I can't\nsubscribe to that I was like that's a\nlot it was a lot I was like I can't you\ncan't wish pain and suffering on anyone\nbecause even though we know you grow\nthrough tough things and you've grown\nthrough so many tough things that were\nnot your choice and then some things\nthat were your choice but we shouldn't\nexpect that other people can navigate\nthose situations it's good when you say\nlike you know the choices that you make\nright yeah\num\nand because of our times today the world\nof what one does or has done is\nAmplified because we're in a position\nwhere everybody can\nhave an opinion and there's a space to\nvoice set a pen right\nI'm going to dumb it down and I'm going\nto go to the lowest level right now when\npeople do some of the dumbest mistakes\nfrom crime\ndeath\nand Fidelity cheating all of the gold go\nall around\nwho has vetted out the consequences\nnobody has sat\nin vetted out the consequences right\neverybody just robbed a bank\nas attempted to rob a bank because they\nfound it to be\na very easy thing because I'm going here\n12 o'clock that man go on break\nbut he gonna break I'm gonna go in there\nand while he on break I'm gonna get the\nmoney and we're gonna come out all we\ngotta do is get back before he get back\nfrom lunch yeah and we we got it\nand they go in we're out of the bank\nthe alarms go off\nain't blow up on the money they don't\nknow nothing they get locked up and they\nsay something crazy like yo I ain't\nwanna I mean to do this\nand the world goes what you mean I mean\nto do it you rob the bank no some people\nare that some thoughts yeah are that\nsimplistic yes yes some actions\nare just that stupid and they're not\nthought out but everything is not that\ndeep\neverything did not have that many layers\nto the mistake when a mistake happened\nyeah yeah yeah I'm grounded in the world\nof reality everything that I have done\nin my mind\nI attached a piece of logic and\nmade it made sense to me yeah that's it\nyou can make anything make sense to you\nif you wanted to\nsometimes it's not until consequences\npresent themselves that you realize the\nidiotic way to thinking or the idiotic\napproach to what you feel you can do the\nbigger than a world like mentality\nhumbling is something that has to happen\nyeah\nyou can either welcome it or not\nbut we're all privy to it mines is Cam\nand and different doses\nshapes and sizes man uh but I just don't\nI don't want to say I don't like I think\nthe thing that like it just you have to\nshake your head it's not even worth the\nbattle in conversation it's simple yeah\nit's not yeah it's not deeply thought\nthrough it's just not deeply thought\nthrough I was watching Biden there's a\nclip of Biden\nwhat Byron says and this is I've\nprobably watched this clip I'm not into\npolitics at all\nBiden goes I got something important I\nwant to say in the whole world needs to\nhear it\nI need everybody to listen right now\nand he takes a beat he goes\nI forget it\nthe president of the United States\nnobody didn't mean to do that yeah if I\ndidn't even go up there and say I'm\ngonna set up I've got the best joke in\nthe world and and in the middle of it\ngoes\nyeah it's something later that he went\nand watched God I'm sorry and he\napologized yeah I'm sorry I know I know\nyeah I know guys I don't know\nyeah I'm sorry like\nhe didn't mean it yeah yeah he didn't\nplan it\nI hope I hope my way of making my point\nmake sense yeah it makes sense I hope I\nhope that I'm uh articulating you right\ncorrectly I'm saying that I'm related\nthere's no excuses there there should\nnever be any excuses yeah wrong is wrong\nproblems are forever I'm saying that I\ndon't like it when people tell you how\nyou thought about something and you go\nwasn't that I didn't even it wasn't that\nyeah nope I just\nI kind of just\nI just walked down there I didn't even\nknow that it was\nyeah do you think you just walked yeah\ndid you get out the bed did you put on\nthose boots on purpose yeah nope I just\nthere's actually no I didn't that's not\nwhat I did\nit's like yeah I don't like that yeah\nsome thoughts are not that deep in that\nlayer yeah that's that's the difference\nI found between being critical and being\na critical thinker everyone's critical\ntoday where it's just we try and find\nthe floor and what you're encouraging\nthrough this book through your work and\nwhat we're encouraging here on this\nplatform is critical thinking let's be\nopen to the fact it could be really\nbasic it could be really deep it could\nbe somewhere in between and most likely\nyou have no idea because you're not that\nperson right you didn't do that you\ndidn't have to live through that it's a\nvery slippery slope to go down when you\ntalk about it because like I said you're\nin a time yeah everybody knows\neverything everybody's the smartest\nperson in the room today yeah and I said\nthat's an amazing thing to me like yeah\neverybody's right all the time yeah\nyou're telling me nobody's wrong today\ntwo three four six XYZ yeah everybody do\nyou understand we're in a time where\neverybody's right\neverybody knows everything\neverybody is the smartest person in the\nworld\nI call them the best coaches that have\nnever won a championship people don't\nthink about that enough yeah the coaches\nunderstand I mean it's something that\nwe're eventually going to have to get\nout of yeah the world of anxiety and\nmental health is at the highest level\njust that it's ever been it's on the\nfront page I wasn't aware of mental\nhealth at the at the level that it is uh\npre-pandemic I had no idea that existed\nat the level and that so many people\nsuffered I had no idea about the battles\nof real depression or real day-to-day I\nhad no idea\nbut what that time did it put it on the\nForefront\nand you get to see how people are truly\nbattling\nbattling on a day-to-day\nbased off of perception doubt and how\nthey feel based off of what I think you\nthink like yeah yeah yeah that's a scary\nthing scary thing it's a scary thing and\nyou know I can I can only be transparent\nand authentic in hopes that people will\nfind it is what it is man yeah be you\nunapologetically\nand as you are correcting or fixing or\nevolving in you\nunderstanding you got a dope thing to\nlook back at and that's the old you\nversus the new attempt in who you are\ntrying to be that to me is beautiful\nevery piece of art that I look at that I\nlove that I embrace there's nothing\nbetter than looking at it from the start\nyeah yeah yeah what does it start out as\nyeah every house that gets built what\ndid it start out as\nyeah every Carter gets built what does\nit start out as\nclothes that we wear what was the design\nin the beginning everything has stages\nof growth\nwhy in today's time are we forgetting\nthat\nwhy are we forgetting that and expecting\nan immediate space\nof perfection\nI didn't know the babies come out the\nwomb and know it all off the back I\nthought they have to be taught\nthe way that we're talking today that's\ntough yeah it's tough yeah so I try my\nbest to\nremove myself from as much as I can I\ntry myself to\nact as a aid for\nlaughter Happiness joy and I can only\nhope that the conversation attached to\nmy name will be one\nof good I can't control it if it is\ngreat man if it isn't I tried\nthat's where I'm at yeah that's what my\nmind said today well when I when I\nlistened to your audiobook which I felt\nwas a very intimate take on you as a\nhuman not as an Entertainer I can\nhonestly say that I walked away from it\nsaying to my friends and people that I\nspeak to going you know what Kevin\ndidn't have to do that that's how I felt\nwhen I listened to you I was like Kevin\ndidn't have to do that like he's\nsuccessful he's winning he's great what\nhe does he didn't have to create\nanything to talk about his flaws like\nyou just didn't have to do that\nand to me that's why I was respect and\nadmire you because when I heard that I\nwas like well if he's happy to go then\nhe's happy to talk about how these\nmonsters never die and he's happy to\ntalk about how he's still dealing with\nthem\nI find it to be some of your most\nmeaningful work at least in the work I\ndo of course and I don't want to feed\nyour approval months to read them but\nyou know like I I really feel that way\nlike what I really feel that way there's\na place that you get to in life right\nwhen you start to you started like what\ndid I do yeah\nhey what did I do right like what's and\nit doesn't mean like you healed the\nworld or you you know changed World\ncreated this you have something like\nthis I'm not I'm not saying it for those\nanswers but for you like the question of\nlike what did I do and I'm at a place\nwhere okay outside of the success in the\nfame was like what am I what do I want\nwhat am I doing right and\nthe information that I now have the\nopportunity to give like the information\nif nothing else the information if you\nreally want to have impact and you want\nto try to position yourself\nto help create the opportunities for\nchange uh financial literacy in the\nblack community not understanding\nbanking haven't known it my alignment\nwould Chase and and well JP Morgan my\nbut my why there's a y attached to it\nokay I'm this is a reason I got I got\nsomething bigger than my famous success\nI okay this is a passion yes and\nsomething that we're trying to correct\nokay in the space of inspiration\nmotivation there's a passion attached to\nme trying to Simply Inspire and motivate\nthose that just simply aren't getting\nmotivating messages on a day-to-day\nbecause some households just don't do it\nsome may not have the households that do\nit I didn't grow up in a mom and dad the\ndinner every night the uh family prayer\nat the table I didn't have that I don't\nthat's not my life there's other people\nthat do have it there's some people that\njust this diminary mom them and their\ndad some people don't have anybody\nwhatever that thing is you don't know\nwho's pulling from what to try to get to\nwhere like you we have no idea so if I\ncan now act as a Aid\nthat is giving you nothing but verbal\nWarfare attached to truth and\nauthenticity if I'm giving you\nan adults and gems that are attached to\na real life\nconcept like this isn't it's not made up\nI'm giving you simple information based\noff of me and my battles I just told you\nthere's no handbook for fame\nyet still I'm giving you in some way\nshape or form yeah something that can be\ncamouflaged\nas an example of how I had to handle a\njust deal\nI have an opportunity to have an on\nseason and off season yeah my on season\nis movies maybe a stand-up comedy tour\nmaybe not my off season\nI can go and I can I can be a speaker at\nI can talk to companies about I can go\nto uh said conventions and give X Y and\nZ uh that's used to Simply amplify\nmotivate Inspire whatever those things\nare\nonce again I'm creating another door\nattached to a piece of passion that I\ndiscovered I discovered this I didn't\nset out to do it I discovered it\nand those that I see doing it you know\nwhen will right now Will Smith good\nfriend of mine you know Will's book had\na tremendous amount of success will sold\na million books\nit's not just because of the Will Smith\nFactor\nWill Smith\nis telling you the truth\nhey man\nyou guys got the glitz and glamor of\ngold from the perception that I gave you\nwithout ever really pulling the veil\nback to show you everything else that\nwas back here\nI can't hold it no more\nI was in this business for 30 years or\nwhatever I cannot\nI don't want to get to that point so I\ndo it all the time it's still going\nyou're still working but I promise you\nthere's a person that will listen to\nthis that will understand it and that\nwill go you know what man shouldn't be\nafraid to be who you are if I can embody\nand embed the space of confidence for\nothers to make people understand how\ndope it is to Simply believe that you\ncan do whatever you put your mind to if\nI can help and just giving you that push\nI did my part\nself-confidence and belief\nthat's how dreams get met\nself-confidence and belief that's how\nyou check off goals\nthat's how you march towards whatever\nyour versions of success are where the\nsprinkle of that humility that's it yeah\nKevin it has been such a joy talking to\nyou today man we end with five fast\nquestions these have to be answered in\none sentence 143 pounds sorry sorry one\nsentence one sentence only for each\nanswer all right Kevin Hart these are\nyour final five question one what is the\nbest advice you've ever received don't\nbe local\nChris Rock yeah do not be a local\ncomedian love that make the world laugh\nuh second question what is the worst\nadvice you've ever received or heard\nworst advice I've ever received or heard\nis sometimes you got to make a studio\nrespect you you said don't give long\nanswers after so I'll summarize I I want\nto know yeah it was based on what I know\nit was based off of\nyou know after you get to a place in\nacting when you become number one on the\ncall sheet if a studio isn't doing\nthings to your liking well you know\nsometimes you gotta not show up and the\nreason why I say that's the worst advice\nthat I've ever received I'm a\nstraightforward businessman and always\nhave been and the world of negotiation\ncan be simplified it doesn't have to be\nthe game of back and forth from True War\nright so being in a room and having a\nface-to-face conversation with\nFoundation of understanding of what you\nwant versus what I want you can succeed\na lot more and I've never not done that\nyeah all opportunities all business all\nrelationships have flourished because of\nan understanding of communication that\nI've done in the room uh whether it be\nmy team studio studio me my team\num that that to me has has allowed me to\nachieve much more success than allowing\nother people to talk for me and other\nthings to be elongated and go on and on\nand you end up with a perceptionist not\nof you yeah that's created based off of\nthe idea of what people think you are\nbecause of the way that you've handled\nbusiness and what's great about that is\nit breaks the pattern so that other\nTalent don't get that same advice\nabsolutely then it keeps perpetuating\nthe pattern and now 25 years from now\nyour kids having to deal with it because\nthat was the patent that you continued\nand set so yeah I love that uh question\nnumber three how would you define your\ncurrent purpose my current purpose is\nabout embracing the world of we and\nmaking the we bigger than the idea of me\num and that's that's for anybody in the\nposition of you know\nwhatever your version of star or success\nis it's it's embracing the world of we\nmaking other people feel like they can\nuh creating opportunities you know\nchanging the economy by by uh broadening\nyour businesses and and more jobs more\nopportunities Etc we right more further\nhow do we have more success more wins\nquestion number four what's something\nyou used to value that you don't value\nanymore the world of approval that you\ncan't control\nI can't control what the world thinks or\nwhat people thinks and I thought that I\ncould\nI thought that I could do everything to\nshow
