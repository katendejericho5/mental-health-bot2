for the\nsecond time Dr Mark Hyman oh thank you\nso much Jay it's okay to see you man no\nthank you for being here right I I mean\nit you know your work is\nso practical it's so accessible I'm glad\nwe get to finally be in person and I\nremember last time you came on the show\neveryone absolutely loved it uh so I\ncan't wait for this inhuman person\nconnection uh but I want to start\nbecause I when I was reading through\nthis book a lot of stuff came up this\nthis really stood out to me really stood\nout to me I want to dive straight in go\nlet's go you said for every 10 of your\ndiet that is ultra processed food your\nrisk of dying goes up 14 so wait I'll\nrepeat that for everyone for every 10 of\nyour diet that is ultra processed food\nyour risk of dying goes up to 14 you're\nsaying that's for every 10 percent yeah\nthat's 60 of our diet and 67 of kids\ndiets today in America and what's Ultra\nprocessed food\nit's basically food-like substances it's\nnot really food I mean processed food is\nnot bad sauerkraut is processed food\nmeasles processed food you know canned\nsardines and canned tomatoes that's\nprocessed food that's okay but it's the\nultra processed food which is where they\ntake the raw materials from soy wheat\nand corn that are grown through\nindustrial agriculture they break them\napart to the component parts they\nreassemble them in food like substances\nwhich are all color size and shapes of\nchemically extruded foods that have no\nresemblance to anything we've ever eaten\nfor most of our evolutionary history and\nare extremely triggering for all the\nancient pathways\nto cause disease\nso if you want to get sick and die early\neat processed food yeah well with this\nconversation of how our diet and our gut\nhealth being linked to longevity and\naging it's something that's I mean been\naround for\nfor a long long time but I feel like\nwe're only really having this\nconversation now and more and more\npeople are moving in that direction\nwould you agree with that I think it's\ntrue I don't think and honestly I've\nbeen practicing medicine for over 30\nyears and I can't tell you how shocking\nit is to somebody my well-educated\npatients that food has anything to do\nwith how they feel I mean like forget\nabout disease it's like and most doctors\nif you ask you know does food have\nanything to do with arthritis or\nrheumatoid arthritis or you know cancer\nor dementia oh no you know but it's\nabsolutely the biggest driver it's the\nsingle biggest thing we do every day\nwhich is interact with literally pounds\nof foreign material then we have to\ndigest breakdown and assimilate and in\nthe food is not just calories it's\ninformation it's instructions it's code\nthat regulates every aspect of your\nbiology for good or bad and so we now\nunderstand how these ancient systems in\nour body that either can activate\nlongevity and healing or can cause\ndisease are influenced by the\ninformation and food so food is medicine\nand it can also be poisoned so Ultra\nprocessed food is literally poison it's\naddictive it drives inflammation it\naccelerates every age-related disease we\nknow of from cancer to heart disease to\ndiabetes or dementia depression and\neverything you can possibly imagine even\nviolence and divisiveness and hatred in\nour society are driven by food and I\ntalked about this in my last book food\nfix were in in prisons if they give\nprisoners healthy food the violent crime\ngoes down by 56 percent if they give it\nin juvenile detention centers their\nviolence goes down by over 90 percent\nthe Restriction that these news\nrestraints goes down by 75 suicide goes\ndown by 100 that's the third leading\ncause of death in this population so\nfood is so important to so many aspects\nof our physical and mental health so we\nneed to understand how our bodies\ninteract with food and how we've\nco-evolved with food and how to turn on\nthe right signals in the body to\nactivate well-being and joy and and\npleasure and also all these ancient\nlongevity switches so that's really a\nlot about my book young credit is about\nit's about how do we activate these\nancient longevity switches these ancient\nhealing systems so the code from the\nbook from the ayurvedic science was that\nwhen diet is wrong medicine is of no use\nand when diet is correct medicine is of\nno need yes so I think that's a ancient\nbit of wisdom from your culture but it's\nit's as true as it ever was yeah no it's\nit's really interesting to me so my\nwife's an ayurvedic practitioner and so\nyeah and so she's an ironic health\ncounselor and that's kind of her field\nof study and what's really interesting\nabout what you're saying and when you're\ntalking about being young forever\nI think the challenge is when you are\nyoung in age you don't ever feel\nable like you almost feel and I and I\nremember relating to that feeling of\nyeah I'm probably gonna feel like this\nforever right yeah and then you start\ngetting older and I'm I'm not you know I\nmean I'm 35 now and and yeah and it's\nbut you start to notice different things\nand\nyou start thinking about these things\nmore often like I didn't have to think\nabout my digestion until I was like 30\nand then you start thinking about it or\nyour energy levels or like what was\npossible and what wasn't and I consider\nmyself to be someone who wants to live\nan optimal life yeah uh I don't just\nwant to sit back and do nothing to live\na long life I want to live a life where\nI'm of service and I'm living my purpose\nand I'm being able to have deep\nexperiences so when you talk about being\nyoung forever what are the things that\nwe're doing that are aging us faster and\nthere's so much I mean the first thing I\nsay is that the purpose of Being Young\nForever is not to live a heatedness sick\nlife and seek pleasure and just be\nnarcissistic it's about being able to\nshow up in your life fully being able to\nlove and serve and do the things that\nyou want to do to engage in life in a\nmeaningful purposeful way to be able to\nbe present in relationships to show up\nfor your friends and family and\nCommunity to give a be of service you\nknow like neem karoli Baba said love\neverybody serve everybody feed everybody\nI think that sort of sums up the book\nand I think I think the there's so many\nthings that we are doing unconsciously\nthat are disrupting our ability to live\nwell and age well and feel good and\nthere are many cultures around the world\nlike the blue zones which I visited like\nSardinia and icaria where the defaults\nare all automatically making them\nhealthy if all you have to eat is your\nlocal wild foods and whole unprocessed\nFoods you're going to eat that if if you\nhave to hike five miles a day up and\ndown Rocky terrain to Shepherd your\ngoats and sheep you're going to do that\nyou're not going to go to the gym right\nif you have to like lift big logs and\nbuild things that's how you're going to\nstay strong your your community and\ntheir relationships are such an embedded\npart of their whole culture so they have\nthese automatic defaults that create\nHealth everything in our society\nautomatically creates disease our\nprocessed diet which we just talked\nabout our sedentary Lifestyles chronic\nstress you know I was with this guy\nSilvio on top of this mountain in\nSardinia who was a 200 sheeps and goat\nand his family lived there for 100 years\nand we had this beautiful dinner of all\nhis food that he grew and he made and\nknowledge sheep cheese everything and so\nI said to answer I said Silvio so do you\nhave any stress in your life\nand he looked at me like it was the\nweirdest freaking question he'd ever\nbeen asked and he's it took him a while\nhe saw it and he pondered\nand then he said yeah you know sometimes\nat night a goat gets loose and I have to\ngo get it I'm like holy cow so we live\nin such a chronically stressed life\nwhere sleep deprived we were exposed to\nunnatural light at the wrong times of\nday we are exposed to an overload of\nenvironmental toxins\nwe have a horde of drugs for being given\nthat are destroying our microbiome\nantibiotics and all the things in our\nfood supply that are that are damaging\nour guts so we have literally a disease\nproducing culture and we have a society\nthat's focused on individualism and\nsuccess and achievement and you know in\nSardinia and they agree on where I was\npeople weren't like on this big goal to\nachieve you know something they were\njust living they were just enjoying life\nthey were celebrating together they were\nsavoring the sweet things in life they\nwere just enjoying being as enough and\nyou know I think so much of our culture\nis about doing and making and creating\nwhich is not bad I do it but I think it\ncan come at a cost if we are unbalanced\nin how we do it where are the starting\npoints for people in creating longevity\nin their life because I find like what\nyou just said you're so right and\nsometimes what I find is that\nthe world is overwhelming in the way\nthat it's set up but even trying to\nchange your habits can be as\noverwhelming as well where people go I\ndon't know where to start like I don't\nknow where to start with my diet I don't\nknow where to start with my stressed\nlifestyle I don't know you know so where\ndo you encourage people to start\nfiguring out what the root cause of\ntheir challenges are and and where they\ngo from there well you know everybody's\ndifferent but I would say you know it\nsounds maybe obvious but the fundamental\nthings that that keep us healthy and\nkeep us living long are really quite\nsimple and and you know there was a\nstudy many years ago by James freeze so\nwe published in the New England Journal\nmedicine where you looked at what he\ncalled the compression of morbidity the\nidea that we could have our health span\nequal our lifespan most of us spend the\nlast 20 of Our Lives sick right so you\nmight look to 80 but the last 20 20 of\nyour life maybe 20 years or a little bit\nless you're going to be unwell that's\nnot fun and you found if you just kept\nyour ideal body weight if you exercised\nand you didn't smoke you live a long\nhealthy life and you would die quickly\npainlessly and cheaply but if you didn't\nyou would die long expensive painful\ndeaths at early right so I think where\ndo people start I think they start with\nthe very foundational basics of\nself-care which is food\nand exercise and stress reduction tools\nlike you have in common where you teach\npeople seven minute meditations you\ndon't have to go to a monastery like you\ndid for three years you know\nyou can learn how to increase your Sleep\nQuality these are really foundational\nbasic things that everybody needs to\nknow how to do and there's little\ndifferences for everybody but the food\nstuff is really pretty straightforward\neat real food if it's basically grown in\na plant eat it if it's made in a plant\nstay away from it\nI'm gonna have another I used to do uh a\nlot of work with churches and\nfaith-based healing and wellness not not\nFaith healing but faith-based cultures\nand wellness and although I'm not a\nposter Faith healing either and I used\nto say it's really simple to know what\nto eat leave the food that man made eat\nthe food that God made it's something a\nfive-year-old can understand dude God\nmake an avocado yes did he made it\nTwinkie no it's not it's not that hard\nso stick with things that are as close\nto what their original form was\neat foods that are rich in plants plants\nI call it plant Rich diet which is all\nthe phytochemicals and plants are\nmedicines make sure you have adequate\nprotein as you get older because that is\nimportant for building muscle and muscle\nis the currency of Aging we get frail\nand decrepit as we get older because we\nlose muscle learn some simple practices\nof exercise that work for you whether\nit's taking a walk resistance training\nis pretty important as you get older\nwhich is either bands or body weight or\nweights or some there's all kinds of\ntechniques out there but Bill and I was\nlazy about this I didn't start till I\nwas 60 but I I really transformed my\nbody even starting at 60 years old\ncompared to where I was at 40. I'll show\nyou a picture later before and after but\nit's pretty impressive and I think the\nother part is you know optimizing your\nsleep and all the practices of how to do\nthat are in the book and then there's\nyou know extra layers of things you can\ndo which is the right supplements and\nthen there's all these emerging\nlongevity therapies that are out there\nthat are called hormesis which means\nthis things that are stressful to your\nbody but they won't kill you so exercise\nis a stress if you're lifting weights or\ntearing muscles you're building new\nmuscle everybody's familiar with that\nand you get stronger basically what\ndoesn't kill you makes you stronger and\nthere's phytohormesis which are these\nplant compounds that are the plant's\ndefenses that we consume but that help\nour bodies activate healing responses so\nlike all the colorful vegetables if I\nseen in strawberries there's things in\npomegranate your lip and a the catechins\nand green tea and you know those goes on\nand there's listen list of them in the\nbook and how to optimize that and then\nthere's really simple ways to sort of\noptimize your your timing of eating to\nactivate repair systems so one of the\nkey strategies around food is to use it\nto activate these ancient longevity\nswitches so we weren't meant to eat all\nthe time we have hundreds of genes that\nhelp us adapt to starvation but very few\nthat help us adapt to abundance or\nexcess which we have now so when you\nhave periods of fasting which has been\ndone throughout the centuries for\nvarious religious or spiritual reasons\nand various practice says but it could\nbe just an overnight fast for 12 hours\nor 12 hours or 14 hours or 16 hours that\ngives your body a chance to clean up\nimagine like being in your kitchen and\ncooking every night and never washing\nthe dishes and never cleaning up and\nnever you know like like you wouldn't do\nthat your body needs that repair system\nto be activated and only be activated\nwhen you're not eating for a period of\ntime so that that is a very powerful way\nto activate these ancient switches that\nshut off inflammation that increase your\nantioxidant systems that boost your stem\ncell production that cause autophagy the\ncellular cleanup where you have a little\nPac-Man cells going around and cleaning\nup old damaged cells and tissues and\nproteins\nit's a very important strategy for\nimproving your overall quality of life\nand health and Metabolism so there's a\nlot of hacks that you can use from a\nfood perspective that I encourage but\nthere's also other treatments that are\nout there like that that are not just\nfasting for hermesis but hot therapies\nand cold therapies so you might have\nheard about like saunas or cold plunges\nand it's kind of all the rage now but\nthe besides around this is really\nremarkable like in Finland if you just\ntake a sauna a few times a week your\nrisk of death goes down by 24 if you do\nit four or five times a week it goes\ndown over 40 percent and that was\ncompared to a control group in Finland\nwhich took us on once a week because\neverybody has a sauna in Finland I think\nthere's enough saunas in Finland for the\nentire population at once right and then\nthat increases your date immune system\nit it activates something called heat\nshock proteins that kill uh they clean\nup all the damaged proteins and help\nrefold them and make them work better\nand one of the Hallmarks of Aging these\n10 things that go wrong as we age is\ndamaged proteins\nand so there's all these benefits cold\nplunges also activate your mitochondria\nand brown fat and help stimulate all\nthese longevity Pathways so that we can\ntake a cold shower in the morning like I\ndid a hot bath at night if you have a\nsauna grade or a cold plunge grate and\nthere's even you know other therapies\nlike hypoxia therapies or hyperbaric\noxygen or you know even ozone which is\nbeing used now for all kinds of things\nso we have a lot of very cool stuff on\nthe margins but the foundations are so\nkey yeah and these blue zones were like\nI met a couple that collectively was 210\nyears old\nyou know I mean and you know they didn't\nhave you know they didn't have saunas\nand hyperbaric oxygen and ozone and\nsupplements and they didn't have any of\nthat they had they had these\nfoundational things so you know what I'm\nsaying is even given the basic things\nthat we do know we can easily get to a\nhundred and when these people move to\nthe West they die at the same rate as\neverybody else so it's not some special\ngenetic thing and then these other\nadvances and things I talked about in\nthe book can probably get us to 120. and\nthen what's coming down the pike might\nget us to 150 or even longer so imagine\na world where we can take advantage of\nthe wisdom I mean in this culture Elders\nthere's no such thing as Elders there's\nold people the elderly which is pejorda\nbut Elders I mean how valuable are they\nto society the wisdom Keepers you know\nwe lost all that and then imagine like\nnow I'm like going to be 63 next week\nyou look incredible you look amazing\nyou're the best you're the best\nrepresentative\nfor facelifts good uh no actually I I\nthink it's it's remarkable because I\nfeel like I finally figuring life out\nyou know I finally figuring out how to\nbe happy and have good relationships and\nlive my life in a balanced way and take\ncare of myself and I've kind of figured\nso much out not everything obviously but\nI feel like now I'm just beginning and\nnow most people at 63 are winding down\nand I remember as a kid 63 was like an\nold person like but I'm going heli\nskiing this year I'm you know I'm going\nI'm learning how to surf better than\nDecember I'm going to riding horses on\nthe beach in Mexico next week I'm doing\nall these things that I you know are\njust very physical active things that\nyou wouldn't think a 63 year old could\ndo yeah but the body is capable of that\nwith your journey though when you said\nyou started at 60 like doing strength or\nresilience Based training Etc was help\nsomething that came very late in your\nlife or was it like almost always\nmindfulness no you might not know the\nstreet but I was a yoga teacher before I\nwas a doctor I did not know that\nso yeah I studied Buddhism in college\nand I medicine was an afterthought so I\nwas living with a PhD student nutrition\nat Cornell and I studied nutrition I\nlearned about nutrition against the DS I\nwas a vegetarian for many years and I\nbasically was very focused on health and\nwell-being I ran five miles a day I'd\nyoga all the time but I didn't I didn't\ndo weights I didn't do resistance\ntraining so I was like ah you're doing\nyoga I run I bike it's fine I play\ntennis whatever but I thought I didn't\nlike it gyms are smelly and every time I\ndo push-ups I when my chest would hurt\nI'm like this is dumb but then I you\nknow I couldn't do 10 push-ups when I\nwas 50 and now I can drop and do like 75\n80 push-ups without stopping wow okay\nthat's impressive yeah it's just the\nbody has\nat any age to kind of recover and I you\nknow my dad was 89 he couldn't get up\nout of a chair because he just kind of\nhad gotten a little frail so I got him a\ntrainer at 89 for the first time and he\nwas able to get so much fitter and\nstronger and more functional so it's\nnever too late to start yeah I feel like\nthe CH the biggest challenge that I'm\nnoticing in all of this is that I was\nsaying to someone recently that if I\nasked everyone how many of you want to\neat healthier everyone would raise their\nhands if I ask people the question how\nmany of you want to work out more most\npeople would raise their hands we don't\nhave a challenge in desire we have a\nchallenge in habits where we don't know\nhow to move away from this\ncompelling feeling we have to go with\nwhat feels good in the moment right like\nwhen you look at Food it's like choosing\na bowl of vegetables or a bowl of fries\nlike you're gonna choose the fries out\nof habit and I find that sometimes we\ncan like put our willpower together and\nwe can kind of push through and have\nthat but then as soon as we get access\nwe cave again so how have you thought\nabout as you are helping guide people in\nthis journey like how have you found\neven for yourself you went from yoga to\nthen being able to do 80 push-ups today\nwhat were the key tenets in helping you\nchange your habits because I find that\nwe're in a habits crisis right now more\nthan anything I mean I've been always\npretty self-disciplined uh I think the\nthe thing that I've really learned\nthough Jay is that it's it's your\ncommunity that matters this your social\nnot your Social Network online but your\nactual social network in person that\ndrives so much of your behavior and I I\nknow I I for decades studied the the\nsort of molecular biology and Physiology\nand biochemistry and genetics and I was\nsort of in deep into like the inner\nworkings of the human body and you know\nEinstein said I'm not interested in the\nthoughts in the L and the spectrum of\nthis or that element I'm interested in\nthe thoughts of God the rest are details\nso I feel like I was so interested to\nknow the mind of God by understanding\nthe natural laws of biology which is\nwhat functional medicine is what's\ndescribed in young forever but but I had\nkind of missed something which is how do\nwe get people to change Behavior because\nI can change biology I can take someone\nwith diabetes and heart failure and all\nthese problems and I can reverse it and\nI went to Haiti after the earthquake in\n2010 and I met Paul Farmer who basically\ntook care of\nuh people who were the most underserved\npeople in the world Haiti is the poorest\ncivilization the Western Hemisphere half\nof the population lives in less than a\ndollar a day and these people were\nbasically affected by the public health\ncommunity and they had TBN AIDS and he\nsaid look I can cure these diseases with\ndrugs these are easy but people don't\nhave the ability to take the drugs and\nthey don't have to walk clean water and\nthey don't have a watch they want to\ntake it so he realized that the power\nwas community so he created this model\nof accompaniment we're going to\naccompany each other to health\nand so he used community health workers\nessentially and then I realized that wow\nyou know we call all these chronic\nillnesses of Aging we call them\nnon-communicable diseases\nthey're not infectious but they are\ncontagious we know that if you're\noverweight your family is overweight\nit's not a stronger predictor of obesity\nas if your friends are overweight if\nyour friends are overweight you're 171\nmore likely to be overweight than if\nyour family's overweight wow I didn't\nknow that which is crazy this is\nChristopher's work from Harvard and so\nit's our social fabric that determines\nour behavior these social threads that\nconnect us are more important than our\ngenetic Fields so if you all your\nfriends are you know drinking beer and\nhaving fries and burgers and watching\nfootball which may not be a bad thing\nbut you might like that and you might\nnot be as healthy as if all your friends\nare drinking green juices and going to\nyoga every day right so it's a very\ndifferent framework so I realize that\nthe power of community is so important\nso we did a program at this church\nSaddleback Church in California where we\nuse the small groups that they already\nhad built and we put a healthy\ncurriculum levian curriculum through\nthose groups and we thought a few 100\npeople would show up fifteen thousand\npeople signed up the first week and they\naccompanied other health and they lost a\nquarter million pounds in the first year\nand through this process I really\nlearned that it was the power of each\nother to help each other get healthier\nto lift each other up to inspire each\nother to hold each other accountable\nit's like AAA or it's like Weight\nWatchers these things work because they\nhave a community connected component and\nthat was one of the things I learned\nfrom the blue zones Jay that was so\nimportant it was little nursing homes\nyou know they their whole society was\nbuilt around\nrelationships and community and\nconnection and celebration together so\npeople weren't isolated and lonely and\ndisconnected like they are in the\nsociety but they were deeply connected\nthe Sangha right is like that's the song\nis the one of the three pillars of\nEnlightenment which is community that\nhelps you build and work towards the\nright action and the right life and the\nright kind of loving and the right\nbehavior all these things so I think we\nreally underestimate the power of that\nso what I would say to people is find to\nsomeone a friend a buddy a group you\nknow my friend Rick Warren a pastor of\nSaddleback Church said every body needs\na buddy\n[Laughter]\nlike that like\nyou know it can feel like such a complex\nquestion sometimes and then when you put\nit like that you're like oh yeah that\nmakes so much sense and I start thinking\nabout the people I spend time with and I\nthink people struggle with\npoints of transition in communities in\ntheir life so it's like they've built a\ncommunity they built a group of friends\nnow they want New Visions with their\nlife they have new habits they want to\nadopt and it's like letting go of\nan old set of habits which are linked to\na group of people\nis the most difficult part right if\nyou're used to going and watching\nfootball with a group of people who you\nwill drink together and eat unhealthily\ntogether\nto you you're not just giving up the\nfood you're almost giving up company\nthat's what I mean my friends if you're\nan alcoholic and you're hanging out with\nother alcoholics you got to find new\nfriends yeah you know yeah and that's\nthe hard part and that's the hard part\nand I think that's a what I found having\nmade many transitions in my life of\ngroups of friends and habits\nI found that the first thing was don't\ntry leave your friends or break\nrelationships but try and build new ones\nfirst and so a lot of people spend time\ngoing okay well I've got to somehow talk\nto this person about how we're not going\nto spend time together and it's almost\nthe other way around find the new\nCommunity First find the new Sangha\nfirst and the more you start associating\nwith that group of people it becomes\nnatural for these things to have less\nenergy and less time for and the second\nthing was that I found that the people\nwho wanted to be in my life continued to\nbe in my life right that's right they'll\ncome along yeah they'll come and you'll\nInspire them I can't they she's doing so\ngood he looks so good he's he's feeling\ngood I want to know what he's doing\nwhat's he smoking exactly exactly and\nthe people that want to be in your life\nwill come along with you and I think\nthat we sometimes just get so tired in\nin those groups that we just can't break\nout of them but I I love that answer I\nwant to talk about some of the uh in the\nbook you talk about the 10 Hallmarks yes\nand I want to dive into this because I\nthink we're just again and I come at\nthis as a patient of the book like as as\nyou know when I'm reading the book I\ndon't count myself as someone who knows\nI count myself as someone who is\nconsiders myself quite uneducated when\nit comes to physical biological health\nand when I'm reading this I'm going I\ndon't even think most of us know like\nwe're just not even aware so I want to\npick up if you you didn't get a handbook\nwhen you were born that says this is how\nyour body works yeah I mean most people\ncan run their iPhone like nobody's\nbusiness but they don't know how to run\ntheir body\nat all and so I want to pick a few that\nthat really stood out to me and we've\ntalked about a couple of these but uh\nHallmark one is disrupted hormone and\nnutrient signaling and I wanted to talk\nabout the link between inflammation and\naging because I find that that's\nsomething that people are learning about\nslowly or at least if you're not\nlearning about it you're experiencing\ninflammation oh for sure yeah yeah a lot\nof the diseases of Aging or inflammation\ndiseases right heart disease cancer\ndiabetes dementia I I think you know\nbefore we kind of dive into those I just\nwant to sort of set the stage which is\nof course you know what's really\nexciting for the first time when I\ntalked about the mind of God for the\nfirst time we're understanding these\nfundamental laws of biology like we\nunderstand the laws of physics and from\na very few natural laws of physics we\ncouldn't see and create an enormous\namount of phenomena right think about\nthe things that we can create with\nphysics that's rocket ship going to the\nMoon you know a bridge and build a\nbuilding and we may talk on the podcast\nit's all physics right and and that's\namazing to me and it's just from a few\nnatural laws what are those natural laws\nof biology they haven't really been\ndescribed so scientists for the first\ntime are understanding these fundamental\nlaws that describe all the disease\nphenomena we see the diseases are way\nDownstream and medicine is focused on\nwhack-a-mole treatment you know you\nlet's find the cure for heart disease\nand diabetes and cancer and dementia\nwhat if they're all the same what if\nit's all the same disease with just\ndifferent manifestations like leaves on\na tree where the trunk and the roots are\nthe same\nso that's what we're finding and the\nHallmarks of Aging are these things that\ngo wrong as we get older\nthat cause all these diseases and if we\njust cured heart disease and cancer from\nthe face of the Earth like how many\nyears would we live longer and these are\nthe number one in two killers three to\nfive years\nwhich is kind of shocking right if we've\ndealt with these Hallmarks these causes\nwe might get another 30 or 40 years wow\nand what's important to understand is\nthat scientists are looking at how do we\ntreat these and that's helpful but from\nmy perspective and I think what's unique\nabout my book Young Forever is that I go\nto a deeper level what is the cause of\nthe Hallmarks because if the Hallmarks\nare the cause of disease what causes the\nHallmarks yeah and it's really quite\nsimple it's either too much of something\nthat our body doesn't like or not enough\nof something in our body needs to thrive\nwhat are the impediments to health and\nthe ingredients for health and it's a\nshort list impediments for health are\nbad food too much stress physical or\npsychological environmental toxins\nmicrobes can be you know got microbiome\nbeing messed up or infections and and\nalso allergens things that cause\ninflammation so those are the\nfundamental things and what does our\nbody need to thrive we need the right\nfood the nutrients right bounce of\nhormones light air water connection\nmeaning purpose rest restoration sleep\nexercise movement all these things are\nare the ingredients for health it's a\nvery short list so that's the framework\nof functional medicine you're either\ndying of too much or dying too little\nright and so understand the information\ncoming in from food and what to do with\nit so when we eat protein and sugar and\nfat our bodies know how to handle this\nwe have all these Pathways that digest\nand metabolize these things when these\nsensing pathways are overloaded with too\nmuch of the wrong stuff if you have you\nknow we need glucose and sugar fine but\nif you are eating like a pound a day of\nsugar and flour almost which is what\nmost Americans do today that's like an\navalanche of sugar and flour that's a\ntoxic you know poisonous pharmacologic\ndose so that overloads for example the\ninsulin signaling pathway one of these\nfour longevity switches that are part of\nour nutrient sensing system that\noverloads it and causes you to have a\nCascade of Downstream effects from\ninflammation to increasing belly fat to\noxidative stress to mitochondrial injury\nall these things that lend to a rapid\naging process so that's the biggest one\nand that's kind of sugar and starch so\nif you want to do one thing to extend\nyour your life cut out or cut down\ndramatically on the amount of sugar and\nstarch you're eating every day and have\nmore fat and have more vegetables and\nhave more you know good quality proteins\nthose will all help you you thrive the\nother is the pathway around the nutrient\nsensing is something called mtor and\nthis is something people have heard\nabout maybe maybe not but essentially\nit's kind of cool because there's this\npathway that is so important in\nactivating the cellular cleanup\nmechanism called autophagy and now we've\nheard about this which is why we talk\nabout intermittent fasting or time\nrestricted eating or ketogenic diets or\nall these things that people are kind of\ntossing around the reason those are\nimportant is they give your body a\nchance to do cleanup at night right and\nwe need to clean up like the kitchen\ninstead of leaving it the dishes in\nthere for a week or a month so that\nprocess is so important so we need times\nof not eating to activate this autophagy\nprocess and that happens by the\ninhibition of mtor now mtor when it's\nover stimulated by too much protein all\nthe time or too much sugar all the time\nwe'll just keep making stuff in the body\nand it's like you know if you just keep\nmaking food in your kitchen it's going\nto overflow and it's gonna be a mess and\nthat's what happens inside your body so\nwhat we found was it was this compound\nthat they that they discovered in Rapa\nNui which is Easter Island now who's who\nknows the aliens came down and put those\nthings there I don't know it's those\nstatues that are on the this island off\nthe coast of Chile right\nand they scraped off some stuff off the\nback of the statue and they took it back\nto the lab and they said well maybe this\nis an anti-fungal no it doesn't work so\nwell maybe it has some immune properties\nand it's used in transplant medicine but\nthen discovered it it inhibits mtora in\nfact the name mtor stands for mammalian\nTarget of rapamycin rapamycin is named\nafter rapanui or Easter Island so the\ndrug that they've developed is named\nafter this and this inhibits mtorin is\nnow being studied for longevity and so\nwe need periods of time to inhibit mtor\nof fasting and not eating anything and\nwe need times to stimulate them to her\nto build muscle so we don't get frail\nand decrepit as we age and then there's\nother Pathways like sirtuins and mpk\nthat are part of our nutrient sensing\nsystem that detects scarcity and will\nactivate DNA repair and people have\nheard about for example Resveratrol and\nand Longevity and this is the work of Dr\nDavid Sinclair and this you know they\nworked but they gave them you know it\nwas from Red Wine the equivalent of 1500\nbottles of red wine so you don't want to\npractice this at home but but it was\namazing what they saw was animals living\nlonger and they got healthier even\neating a bad diet if you activate these\nlongevity switches it's so powerful and\nthe beautiful thing is that a lot of the\nplant foods that we can eat the\nphytochemicals that are rich in this\nplant Foods all activate these ancient\nlongevity Pathways like green tea or\npomegranate or or their spiritual from\nred grapes and the list goes on and so\nwe have\nthese ancient systems that we can play\nwith and so the book is really about how\ndo we\nturn on the longevity switches how do we\nactivate those in the right way how do\nwe eat in a way to optimize each of\nthose in the right time at the right way\nwhen I hear that\nin my head I've I've become more close\nand clear about this because of my wife\nso so it comes back to me where like it\ncomes back to your point of view you\nwant the Burgers and Fries and she's\nlike yeah for sure any day of the week\nany day she's making you like you know\nyeah exactly you know it's so I've been\nthrough this journey with her we've been\nmarried for six years and together for\nten but for the six years that we've\nbeen married\nshe's been on this journey with me of\nhelping me transform my diet and my\nhabits and\nI've felt all the benefits you're\nspeaking about having gone on that\nJourney\nand I've also felt some of the shocks\nthat my bodies had in missing out on\nsome of those things that it's used to\nlike my body loved bread like it still\nloves bread like it feels great when I\neat bread uh and I'm talking I'm talking\nabout gluten-free bread I'm talking\nabout bread that has gluten in it and\nbut I know that gluten's uh yeah can be\nmassively inflammatory especially for me\nas well from the test that I've done but\nI find it really interesting that\nsometimes I can feel great eating things\nthat are bad for me but there's\nsomething happening inside that I'm not\naware of yeah I mean Sugar's a drug\nbread's a drug I mean in fact uh you\nmight not know this but one of the\nthings that happens when you eat bread\nin in you're consuming gluten is that\nthe gluten gets partially broken down\ninto these things called gluteomorphins\nwhich actually are like morphine and\nthey bind to The receptors in your brain\nthat make you feel good so yeah heroin\nmakes you feel great it doesn't mean\nit's good for you right and so it's very\naddictive and it also uh you know gives\nyou a jolt of sugar and adrenaline so\nwhen you eat sugar you get a jolt of\nadrenaline literally your cortisol goes\nup your adrenaline goes up so it's like\nit's like being jacked up on steroids\nand and adrenaline which feels good for\nthe moment and then you crash yeah\nexactly uh number four I wanted to talk\nabout you talk about damaged proteins\nyeah and dysfunctional molecules I think\nthat was\nI think damaged proteins is something\nwe're not very well educated on no I\nthink you know what happens is you know\nyour body has it's just it's just a\nmiracle to me Jay the body has this\nancient systems to handle things that go\nwrong and to repair things and clean up\nthings so we are constantly making\nproteins people don't really realize\nthis but what does your DNA do right\nyour DNA all it does is code for\nproteins proteins do all sorts of things\nfrom you know build tissues your muscles\nand Joints to building your immune cells\nto being communication systems and small\nproteins like peptides are messengers at\n80 000 that tell your body what to do\nand regulate all kinds of things from\nbrain chemistry to hormones and sexual\nfunction to metabolism to mitochondrial\nfunction I mean the list goes on so\nproteins are so important but as we age\nthose proteins can get damaged or they\nthey are injured and they are misfolded\nand they're broken and so the body has\nto one address this and two hopefully\nprevent you from making these so one one\nthing that happens for example it's\nreally dangerous is when you eat sugar\nit kind of binds with proteins in your\nbody and it damages them and causes\nglycation which is basically just the\nthe phenomena that that happens when you\nget a crispy chicken skin or crust on a\nbread or creme brulee and you get that\nlike little crack it's so good right we\nall love that stuff yeah but that that\nthat reaction happens in your body and\nand that and that creates what we call\nages Advanced glycation end product\nwhich ages us and that binds to rages\nreceptors for advanced glycation and\nproducts so that rage literally they're\naging and raging is what happens so when\nyou when you eat a lot of sugar and\nstarch you're causing these damaged\nproteins so the measurement for example\nof your diabetes control we call\nhemoglobin A1c that's a measure of\ndamaged proteins that's sugar binding to\nhemoglobin and damaging it and we can\nsee that on a blood test but this is\nhappening throughout your body and\nwhat's amazing is things like we talked\nabout hormesis and these stresses like\nsaunas saunas create heat shock proteins\nwhich are actually repairing proteins or\ncleaning up proteins when you have\nautophagy which is as we talked about\nwhich is a self-cleaning mechanism you\nactually clean up these old proteins and\nyou recycle them so the body has a\nrecycling system basically like takes up\nall these old damaged things Globs onto\nthem like a Pac-Man digest them breaks\nthem down into component parts and says\nokay I got new parts let's make new\nproteins and you start over it's pretty\namazing actually yes yeah it's\nunbelievable I've never I've never heard\nanyone say that before but uh the body\nhas a recycling mechanism it does it's\namazing I mean the like that's what's so\nexciting to me is you know when I went\nto school I I in medical school in their\nsecond year we get a book called the\npathologic basis of disease which is\nreally great it's like the foundational\ntextbook but I didn't get the scientific\nbasis of Wellness textbook I didn't\nlearn anything about that like so how do\nyou create Health you say to your doctor\nI want you to treat this this is okay\ntake this drug if you say doctor I want\nyou to make me optimally healthy like\nokay well eat better exercise take\nvitamins I don't know but like they\ndon't have an answer right but it but\nit's scientific Wellness what is\nscientific Wellness why is what is the\nscience of creating Health that's what\nfunctional medicine is and that's really\nwhat I've given people is an owner's\nmanual for their body how to detect\nwhat's wrong what tests to do how to\nfind out what's out of balance and and\nhow to correct it and how to optimize\neach of the systems in your body so you\ncan create health and uh and and what's\nreally exciting is now we have a metric\ncalled a biological age clock that we\ncan measure so before we kind of say oh\nis this working or not maybe your blood\nworks better or maybe your weight\nweight's a better blood pressure is\nbetter that's all in sort of indirect\nmarkers but there is something that we\nnow have discovered which is a\nbiological clock and it's measured by\nlooking at at little marks on your DNA\nthat are called your epigenome now we\nall know what your genome is which is\nyour genes and you've got about 20 000\ngenes that's your DNA that's not really\nchangeable except for Gene editing or\nwhatever but your epigenome and the\ngenes are like the keyboard and a piano\nyou know 80 88 keys you can't change\nthat but you can play jazz Ragtime\nMozart classical whatever you want Blues\nit's amazing right on the same keyboard\nsame thing with the epigenome the\nepigenome is the piano player\nand that controls which genes are turned\non or off or expressed and your\nbiological age is the sum total of every\ninfluence every food you've eaten every\ntype of exercise you've done every\nthought you have every relationship\nwe've been in all the talks you've been\nexposed to washing over your DNA\ncreating these marks to determine your\nbiological age so I I I've done my\nbiological agent I'm 63 but biologically\nI'm 43. that's unbelievable yeah well\nit's really cool I'm going for 25. I'm\ntrying to get younger than you Jay\nexactly and I think you know we have so\nmany technologies that allow us to now\ndo this that are even beyond the diet\nexercise and lifestyle stuff so we we\nnow can measure the effective\ninterventions on these things and check\nhow we're doing through this epigenetic\nclocks and our biological age doesn't\nhave to match with and track with our\nchronological age you know I was born in\n1959 I can't change that I can't you\nknow be chronologically younger but I\ncan't be biologically younger even as I\nget chronologically older and what's\namazing is it doesn't take that much\nlike I've seen studies were using a\ndietary Intervention which is an\nanti-inflammatory Whole Foods diet you\nknow some phytochemical support a little\nbit of exercise and lifestyle support\nwithin eight weeks they were able to\nreverse biological age in this cohort of\npatients by three years and then what if\nthey did it for a year you know so we\nhave we have the ability to do this to\nmeasure it now it's very exciting\nscience yeah and let's let's\nsome of the things that people are\nfeeling today\nbecause I think that's how we get in\ntouch with our health or we start I\nthink people who read this book are\ngoing to get that manual that you're\ntalking about I want to guide people to\nthis book through things that we feel so\nwhat's really interesting to me is uh\nhow commonly people are experiencing\nbrain fog today yeah and I think as we\nexperience brain fog I don't think we\noften know what to do about it we often\nalso start going internal this is also\nthe same thing as connecting well you\ntalk about in the book to our mental\nhealth I think a lot of the time when\nwe're experiencing mental health\nchallenges we're trying to solve it\nthrough the Mind Correct and I think\nthat that's not working right it's it's\nactually very difficult and I recently\nhad and I know you know Mona Sharma well\nwho I work with who owner works with me\non my diet and my plan and everything\nand uh yeah she's a functional medicine\nnutritionist yes and so we I I did a\nvitamin D test and my vitamin D was 10.\nthat's like very and and I'm still\nfunctioning doing everything I do on\nvitamin D and she was just like jay most\npeople have that level of like have\nforms of depression depression muscle\naches yeah and I'm and I'm not having\nyou know the depressive aspect of that\nand so which which was great for me but\nmy point being that there is this big\nconnection between physical and mental\nhealth or like physical diet sleep\nenergy levels and then impact so talk to\nus a bit about that it's so huge here\nyou know I think you know there's\nthere's so much to work on on your\nbiology but I wrote a book probably 15\nyears ago now called the ultra mind\nsolution about how to fix your brain by\nfixing your body first\nso you can meditate all you want but if\nyou're Mercury poisoned or your thyroid\nis not working or your vitamin B12 or\nvitamin D deficient or your microbiome's\na mess it's going to be hard to achieve\nthe goals you want to achieve so set\nyourself up for dealing with your Soul's\nEvolution with your spiritual growth\nwith healing your emotional life and\nTrauma by setting your body up to\nfunction better to help you to help you\nright and so you know it's it you know\nthis book isn't about getting to 120.\nit's about how to activate these Health\nswitches longevity switches to make you\nfeel good now because most people have\nwhat I call FLC syndrome which is when\nyou feel like crap right and so what\npeople walk around with all sorts of\nsymptoms and not realizing how good they\ncan feel and how quickly they can feel\ngood and so by doing some of these\npractices simply changing your diet and\nlifestyle changes people can experiment\neven 10 days of it can have a profound\neffect you know I do workshops around\nthe world where I take people through at\n10 day or even a five six day program\nand universally within a week people\nhave a 70 reduction in all symptoms from\nall diseases by simply cleaning up their\ndiet and you know how many days five to\nseven days where do you do this well all\nover right come join me yeah we're doing\nnext on Sardinia in April you should\ncome outside you should come it's a\nlittle Boutique Hotel tour in April\nwhen's the one after that I might do one\nin June in Ibiza okay June would be\namazed okay yeah be great yeah but you\ncould teach with me too I don't know I'm\ngonna I'm gonna come you can read some\nmeditations yeah oh yeah yeah I'm being\nserious man no for sure oh that would be\nso fun it's great it's so beautiful\nthere so so we have this ability to\nactivate these these healing mechanisms\nthrough changing our diet and heal our\nmind so uh there's an amazing\npsychiatrist who is at Harvard who wrote\na book called brain energy Christopher\nPalmer who's just brilliant and he\nbasically was a traditional Harvard\npsychiatrist who had a patient with\nschizophrenic and now schizophrenia is\none of those conditions it's not like\nyou know people's anxiety or depressed\nor it's like emotional this is a pretty\nserious mental disorder right and we\nthink it's not changeable and he on the\nmedications gained a huge amount of\nweight which a lot of The Psychotic\nantipsychotic medications cause weight\ngain and he this he this a guy would\njust hide in his room all day and I'll\ncome out and only see the same\npsychiatrist and they he said I want to\nlose weight and the psychiatrist knew he\nwouldn't go to anybody else so he said\nwhy don't you try a ketogenic diet\nbecause I heard it it really works and\nmaybe it'll help you know and he did it\nand his schizophrenia went away wow and\nthe psychiatrist like what's going on in\nthe metabolic function of the brain\nthat's affecting the mind\nright the brain and the mind are not the\nsame thing but the brain function\ninfluence the function of your mind and\nso by healing the brain you can then\nstart to really deal with your stop with\nyour mind it's not going to fix your\nthinking overnight or your mindset and\nall the things you need to work on but\nit'll allow you the ability to do it so\nmuch better and it might even change\nyour thinking it might even change\ndepressive thoughts anxiety you know a\nlot of even panic attacks can be caused\nby fluctuations in blood sugar you know\nwhich I've seen patients so\nI'm so excited you asked that question\nbecause we have such a mental health\ncrisis in this country and we know from\ndietary studies where they they've\nlooked at uh traditional diets like the\nset we call it the sad diet the standard\nAmerican diet which makes us sad\nactually and uh they swapped out that\nfor a Whole Foods you know basically\nMediterranean kind of diet and it was a\nvery large study it was a clinical trial\na randomized controlled trial and it was\na better at treating depression than\nalmost anything else I want to call it\nthe Glad diet\nand we've seen in like in in these\nstudies like I mentioned in prisons and\nother places where people giving a Whole\nFoods diet will dramatically reduce\ntheir their violent Behavior or their\nmood will improve and so these foods\nthat we're eating are inflaming our\nbrain they're inflaming our emotions\nthey're inflaming our minds and\ndepression is an inflammatory disease of\nthe brain autism is an inflammatory\ndisease the brain add is an inflammatory\ndisease of the brain Alzheimer's all\nthese things are brain inflammation and\nhow is this inflammation being caused\nprimarily through our diet and lifestyle\nand toxins so it's a totally fixable\nproblem yeah I mean listening to you\nit gives me a lot of Hope in that you\nknow anyone who's listening to us today\nand goes and grabs a copy of the book\nyounger forever the secrets to living\nyour longest healthiest life uh which I\nhighly highly recommend we'll put the\nlink to the book in the notes and the\ncaption as we're having this discussion\nI'm feeling as a great sense of\nconfidence and I the reason why I have\nthese conversations as well is because\nthey remind me of why I'm trying to have\na clean diet and why I'm trying to do\nthe right thing and I think it's so\nimportant to strengthen that why totally\nbecause it just becomes so easy to go\nback to our you know obvious habits so\nquickly\nbut I think the challenge is that for so\nlong we've been trying to deal with our\nhealth in silos so if we have a mental\nhealth challenge we try and deal just\nwith our mind yeah and if we have a\nphysical health challenge we try and\njust deal with our body and we don't\nrealize that they're so interconnected\nthey're not separate there's no mind\nbody body mind it's it's one thing right\nit's all one thing and and try to\nseparate out doesn't make any sense and\nand so medicine is really bifurcated\nPsychiatry and the rest of medicine and\nit just doesn't make any sense to me and\nwhen I call myself The Accidental\npsychiatrist because I basically wasn't\ntreating people's mental disorders but I\nwas treating their physical health and\nand I saw their brains get better and\ntheir mind get better and their mood get\nbetter and bipolar disease go away\nschizophrenia get better autism get\nbetter add get better depression get\nbetter I'm like what is going on here\nand it just blew my mind could you give\nus a few examples of those or people\nthat you worked with in those spaces\nbecause I think that's something we\ndon't hear about as much like I think we\nhear a lot today about when people are\nstruggling with those things they're\ngoing to therapy yeah but we're not\ndoing one patient who uh you know was\njust severely depressed and was\nstruggling for years and years and uh\nand and you know I found out she had\nmercury poisoning and we got the Mercury\nout of our system and she got better\nthere was a patient uh who really been a\npatient of mine who was someone who was\npart of The Daniel Plan this faith-based\nwellness program I mentioned who came up\nto me after the six-week part of the\nprogram we started in six weeks later we\nhad another rally\nin a gathering and she said Dr Hyman I\ndon't get it like I've been in and out\nof psychiatric hospital my whole life\nI've been in every psychiatric\nmedication I'm about to get divorced\nabout to lose my job I'm I'm just\nstruggling so much and I changed my diet\nand in three days it all went away and I\nfeel so good now is that possible I'm\nlike yeah it's possible it happened to\nyou so it's clearly possible so people\ndon't realize how quickly we can see\nthese changes and so that was really\nremarkable I had a kid with ADD who was\njust so out of control and his behavior\nyou couldn't pay attention he couldn't\nfocus he was kicked out of kindergarten\nif you can imagine being that bad being\nkicked out of kindergarten oh yeah you\nknow and uh but he had all these other\nhealth issues he had asthma and you had\nto roll a bowel and he had all these you\nknow headaches and cramps and so I\nbasically treated his biology turned out\nhe had a leaky gut and food\nsensitivities and Lead toxicity and he\nate a total junk food diets we have so\nnutritionally efficient and Omega-3s and\nzinc and magnesium be vitamins and so we\njust fixed all that we just cleaned up\nhis gut we gave him good food we gave\nhim good nutrients two months later it\ncame back and all the Sims were gone\nphysically and all those mental symptoms\nwere gone and his handwriting which we\ncan show in the in the in the show notes\nand on the video that this handwriting\nwent from being illegible at 12 years\nold to being perfect penmanship and it\nwasn't because I gave him handwriting\nlessons wow it was because his brain\nwent from completely chaotic and\ndisorganized to completely coherent and\nfunctional yeah I hope everyone was\nlistening to this if you're struggling\nwith anything based on your mental\nhealth your brain health I hope that\nyou're also going to take some time out\nto research on your diet to of course\nread this book because I just want\npeople to make that connection quicker\nyeah I and I spend years doing the\nopposite Mark like and that's why I'm so\nfascinated by all the work you do\nbecause I spent years and I got to a\nplace where I'd mastered my mind but my\nbody was just not catching up right and\nso I could take care of my thoughts and\nmy emotions and my feelings but my body\ncouldn't match that pace and so I've\nkind of come the other way yeah it's\ngreat\nhey whatever doorway you get is again\nyeah yeah exactly uh you talked to us\nabout and again we're only doing a very\nhigh level of the book because I want\npeople to get a sense of yeah some of\nthe depth of what you talk about in this\nbook could you explain to us again at\nthat top level what the seven core\nbiological systems are yeah so this is\nreally important Jay so so like I said\nyou know what are the laws of biology\nwhat's the mind of God and right now\nwe're going to growing a revolution of\nmedicine that's as big as anything has\never happened in history you know from\nthe discovery of The Germ it's\nremarkable how we're now understanding\nthe body as an ecosystem this is called\nsystems biology or functional medicine\nis the clinical model that applies this\nand so the Hallmarks of Aging are are\nwhat these emerging scientists in\nlongevity are talking about that go\nwrong with aging but what is causing\nthem is what functional medicine is\nreally good at figuring out and what\nhappens is that these seven core systems\nin the body that go wrong to get out of\nbalance just like in ayurveda they have\nthe doshas you know or in Chinese\nmedicine they have the five elements or\nand we have yin yang have a you know\nimbalances and deficiencies or excesses\nand this is exactly how the body works\nthese ancient Technologies from\nthousands of years ago figured it out we\njust now were putting a scientific\nlanguage on it and understanding and so\nthere's instead of 155 000 diseases\nthere's these disturbances in these core\nsystems many of which are also the\nHallmarks of Aging like your microbiome\nyour immune system how you make energy\nyour mitochondria your detox system how\nyou get rid of toxins your transport\nsystem how you move things around in\nyour body and through your circulation\nand lymphs or some communication system\nis just your hormones neurotransmitters\nyour peptides all the millions of\nchemical reactions that happen all the\ntime it has to be coordinated and your\nstructural system from your\nbiomechanical structure your skeleton to\nyour subcellular structures all of those\nsystems have to be in balance for you to\nbe healthy so as a functional medicine\ndoctor as a systems thinker I look at\nhow do we find out why they're out of\nbalance how do we take out the stuff\nthat's causing the imbalance and put\nback the stuff that's creating balance\nso let's say the gut for example well\nyou might have food sensitivities you\nmight have bad bugs growing your guts\nyou got to remove those things you got\nto remove those foods like gluten or\ndairy and you gotta get rid of um you\nknow the bad bugs that are growing in\nthe gut maybe you need some herbs or\neven an antifungal or an antibiotic and\nthen how do you repair that how do you\ngive the gut what it needs you need\nprebiotics and probiotics and\npolyphenols and you need the right\nnutrients like zinc and vitamin A and\nand omega-3 fats to help the gut heal\nglutamine so we know what the\ningredients are for each to take out and\nput in and so we apply that to each\nthing including the immune system I mean\nyou know one of the most shocking things\nto me during covet was that you know we\nare about four percent of the world's\npopulation in America and we have an\nextraordinary Health Care system and\nspend twice as much as any other\ndeveloped nation and we were 16 of the\ncases of coveted deaths so four percent\nof population in the world four times as\nmany deaths as we probably should have\nhad and we probably should be even less\nthan the rest of the world because of\nour health care System why was that it's\nbecause our diet is so bad that we're\npre-inflamed so when covid came it was\nlike throwing gas on the fire and we\nwere pre-inflammed because we were obese\nwhich were chronically ill because we\nhave all these diseases of inflammation\nand so that's really why and it was it\nwas sort of shocking to me that that you\nknow nobody has talked about this and\nyet we have the power to regulate our\nimmune systems by what we're eating\nsugar suppresses your immune system you\nknow being overweight suppresses your\nimmune system even the response to\nvaccines if you're overweight or you're\nelderly because you're inflamed\nyour immune system doesn't respond to\nvaccines I think everyone's experiencing\na low immunity you know in in general as\nwell because of all these factors that\nyou've talked about today as well and I\njust want everyone to see I want to\npoint this out for everyone who's\nwatching the show if you're listening\nthen\nI'm explaining what I'm doing I just\nwant to show this to everyone who's\nwatching because you can actually see\nhow the book breaks down\nthe Young Forever program which is the\nprogram that Mark recommends in the book\nyoung forever and what I love about it\nis that as you're flicking through this\nbook you're just going to see a very\nsystematic and formulaic breakdown yeah\nit's of the system it's not just it's a\nhow-to manual for how your body works so\nyes yes if you didn't get born with that\ninstruction manual this is a good one\nyeah I want to point that out to\neveryone who's sitting there going like\nme often I can get you know I can often\nstart thinking wow this is a lot of\ninformation I don't know enough where do\nI start what do I do but the book to me\ndoes a great job at simplifying it yeah\nI mean the book is really three parts\nthe first is is the why like why are we\naging what's going on a little bit of\nscience geeky if you don't like any of\nthat you can skip it but I like to know\nwhy yeah and then there's the what like\nthere's the what to do yeah and then\nthere's the how to do it yeah so it\nreally is a is really you know I'm a\ndoctor I take care of patients and so I\nget results by giving people a\nprogrammatic plan to follow so this is\nwhat I've been doing for 30 years yeah\nyou know and there's a lot of great\nlongevity books out there but they're\nOften by academics and I've learned so\nmuch from them but they but they're like\nwell what do I do how do how do I what\ndo I have to do exactly but this just\nbreaks it down exactly even day by day\nand what you can do yeah Mark is this\nsomeone that you've worked with that was\nso negative and felt that they were too\nlate\nto solve their challenges but you were\nable to find some change in them could\nyou tell us about somebody yes I mean\nyou know one of their most remarkable\npatients I had it which was part of a\ngroup program we had at Cleveland Clinic\ncalled functioning for life which used\nthe power of community to help people\nchange behavior and she was a woman who\nwas about to go on her way out she was\n66 years old she had type 2 diabetes for\n10 years she had heart failure\nshe had kidneys that were failing liver\nwas failing and fatty she had high blood\npressure she was in a pile of pills that\nher co-pay was twenty thousand who knows\nwhat she was costing the Health Care\nsystem in and out of the hospital her\nbody mass index was 43 which is severely\nobese you know 25 or less is normal 30\nis obese 40 is just like next level\nright\nand she came to the program she changed\nher diet she was a fairly educated woman\nbut she and it was a minister in her\ncongregation but she really grew up in a\nfamily that never ate real food so\neverything came from a box a package it\ncan highly processed and that's just\nwhat she did for her whole life at 66\nyears old and she was on her way to a\nheart transplant and a kidney transplant\nand you think oh from a traditional\ndoctor point of view well you know you\ncan't really do anything about that\nmaybe you can manage these diseases and\nmake her live a little longer and make\nher quality life a little better but I'm\nlike no way I don't want to manage\ndisease I want to get rid of it so we\nput her on a diet it's a very\nanti-inflammatory diet it's Whole Foods\nplant Rich lots of good fats\nwe didn't even get her moving or\nexercising in the beginning because it's\nhard when you're that big to move but\njust change your food maybe a few\nsupplements not a lot vitamin D fish\nstraw multivitamin\nin three days she was off for insulin\nin three months she reversed every one\nof her diseases objectively by you know\ntraditional conventional medicine\nbiomarkers or heart failure reversed or\nkidneys normalized her liver normalized\nher high blood pressure normalized her\ndiabetes her blood sugar went from A1C\nwent from 11 which is like probably\nshould be in the hospital level blood\nsugar 3 400 to like 5.5 which is\nactually perfectly normal\nshe lost 43 pounds a year she lost 116\npounds and I've got pictures of before\nand after I'll share with you it's\nreally remarkable I had holy cow you\nknow there is no drug on the planet that\nworks as well as food I mean if I could\ngive her a pill to reverse all diseases\nas a doctor I'd write that prescription\nall day long I'm agnostic when it comes\nto the therapy I don't care if it's\nexercise or exorcism whatever a patient\nneeds you know I'm going to give it and\nso I'm like wow this is such this is\nsuch an eye-opener for so many people to\nsee it's possible you know another\npatient with kidneys were failing any we\nknew we did this whole program and and\nuh he went to see his nephrologist and\nthe guy's like what are you doing I've\nnever seen a kidney failure reverse what\nare you doing and he couldn't believe it\nbecause doctors don't get trained to do\nthis so they don't see it so they don't\nbelieve it they go well there's no\nevidence for this well maybe you haven't\nlooked because there is plenty of\nevidence even though there's so much\nevidence on lifestyle and diet do we pay\nfor food is medicine no yeah and it is\nthe most powerful drug yeah well I hope\nthat gives anyone who's listening and\nwatching a sense of confidence as well\nthat you know no matter how far you\nthink you are or how many challenges\nyou're going through right now that\nhopefully this can at least be another\nalternative option to try completely if\nyou haven't tried it already yes it's so\nneeded uh Mark we end every episode with\nthe final five uh which are a Fast Five\nso every answer to be given in one word\nto one sentence maximum okay got it um\nand so Mark these are your final five uh\nquestion one what's the best health\nadvice or diet advice you've ever\nreceived it's probably Michael pollan's\neat food not too much mostly plants it's\njust so simple so clear and it needs to\nbe defined like eat food what food real\nfood Whole Food you know but yeah yeah I\nlove it uh second question what's the\nworst advice you've ever heard Health\nadvice you've ever heard received or oh\nGod eat a high carb diet 6 to 11\nservings of bread rice cereal and pasta\nday to save your life which has caused\nmore deaths and more disease than almost\nanything in history which is a\ngovernment's food pyramid in 1992. and\nthat's so common and in all meals today\nright oh it's terrible yeah we're still\nwe're still yeah we're still promoting\nthat stuff it's not great question\nnumber three uh what's something that\nyou used to\nthink was true about health but now\nyou've changed your mind about it I\nthink I used to believe this is a very\ncontroversial topic which was much\nhealthier to be a vegan or vegetarian\nand I think as I've sort of gotten to\nunderstand the science and the biology\nof longevity that we need adequate\nprotein as we get older and if we don't\neat enough we can't make muscle and\nmuscle as the currency of Aging so I\nthink it's eating the right stuff and\nyou know I think if people have a moral\nissue with animals I we can work around\nit but I think from a health perspective\neating regenerally raised animals that\nare well cared for that are humanly\nraised that regenerate ecosystems\nincreased biodiversity reverse climate\nchange and create nutrient-dense food is\nis really a was a big shift for me from\nbeing a vegan vegetarian to kind of see\nwhat happened when I did that amazing\nthank you for the answer uh and I'll\npick your brain about that please uh\nquestion number four what's the smallest\nchange someone can make today to\nexperience some positive impact in there\nwhere they feel\nI think it's do one small thing you know\nwhen they say floss one tooth yeah do\none push-up tomorrow do two so start\nwith small things you know uh you know\nmaybe you're drinking 12 Cokes a day\ngo to 11. go to ten you know do one\nsmall thing to improve your health and\nthen that will build over time\nabsolutely and Fifth and final question\nif you could create one law that ever in\nthe world had to follow what would it be\noh that's easy I would I would make a\nlaw that would make food quality and I\ncan Define what that is the most\nimportant determinant of all of our food\npolicies and all of our agriculture the\nmost nutrient dense whole real food we\nshould be promoting and subsidizing and\ngrowing I love that that would be\npowerful I mean that'd be so useful yeah\nsolve so many problems I I I I mean\nthat's you've talked about that in your\nprevious book I remember we discussed it\nlike just how much could change at a\nsystemic level to transform the\nHealthcare of the world well think about\nall the things we talked about from the\nmental ill health issues to the physical\nhealth issues to you know the cost of\nsociety to the damage the environment is\nall driven by the production of ultra\nprocessed food and the dissemination of\nit and the eating of it which is 60 to\n70 of our calories yeah that has got to\nstop it's just it's crushing us with the\nweight of that the figurative and\nliteral weight of that absolutely ever\non the book is called Young Forever by\nMark Hyman uh the secrets to living your\nlongest healthiest life with a\nstep-by-step program to reverse disease\nease pain and renew energy make sure you\ngo and grab a copy of this book uh order\nit right now I highly recommend deeply\nreading this with a group if you can get\ntogether uh with a bunch of your friends\nis Mark was talking about and to read\nthis together and to support each other\nmaybe you're going to take a Chapter\nreach and help teach each other I just\nfeel that when Health becomes this\nCollective responsibility in a community\nit becomes a lot easier when we feel\nwe're learning with each other from each\nother and growing together as opposed to\nwhen we're trying to do it ourselves so\nmy recommendation is go and make this\nyour book club pick uh go and follow Dr\nMark Hyman on Instagram and across\nsocial media if you don't already and\ntag me and Mark with what you're testing\nwhat you're experimenting with what in\nthe book is resonating with you makes\nyou take pictures tag us both uh share\nit with us because I love seeing the\nchanges you're making based on these\nconversations uh Mark any final words\nany last thoughts you want to share with\nus yeah I think that you just said it\nall day I think that the the beauty is\nthat that people are just a few short\ndays away from feeling better it's not\nabout living to 120 it's about feeling\ngood now this is not about a hedonistic\nnarcissistic pursuit of longevity it's\nabout optimizing your health and\nwell-being so you can show up in the\nworld and love better and serve better\nand be better and add value to the world\nand add your contribution to the world\nand not be caught in a spiral of\ndysfunction and disease that makes us\nkind of retreat from being part of the\nlarger community of humanity that's\nbeautiful mark thank you so much for\ndoing the work you do thank you for\nshowing up as you do and I'm so excited\nto join you hopefully next June\nbut I'm very excited and uh June 12th to\n19th in uh Ibiza at six senses and
