good to\nhave you in the studio nice to meet you\nfor the first time and for the few\nmoments I've spent with you uh just now\nI can tell that you're very thoughtful\nuh reflective individual and so I'm\ngrateful that you've allowed us this\nopportunity to be a part of this\nexperience thank you so much for\nbringing me into the space\num as always curating a space of\nWellness is something that is really\nnecessary but also difficult to do so\nalready the fact that we have this easy\nbreath and you know the nerves and\nJitters aren't necessarily bubbling to\nthe top I'm really excited to be able to\nhave this conversation with you both I'd\nlove to hear more a bit about you and\nthen that can go further into what you\nwould like to talk about today first and\nforemost I'll say I'm from the land of\nwood and water the birthplace of Reggae\nDance all and the fastest man and woman\non the planet none other than Kingston\nJamaica so you have to represent you\nknow\num but outside of that growing up I've\nalways been into Athletics and I come\nfrom a really unique family structure my\nmom's from England but my brother and I\nborn and raised in Jamaica and on top of\nthat we have this eclectic sense of\nfamily and as I was maturing my mom sort\nof saw an opportunity where my mental\nhealth was concerned moving from spaces\nand schools where there were so many\nthings brought together all at one time\ngrowing up in Jamaica you realize that\nonce you get to a particular school\nprobably high school which starts in\ngrade seven there are so many\ncommunities that come together all at\none time it's not as spaced out as the\nUnited States so on an island you can\nhave someone that lives two three\nparishes over that starts their journey\nto school at 5am in the city where we\nwere and I just happened to have a\nchallenging time where my mental health\nwas concerned and that was when I met Dr\nAgri irons it was a really unique\nexperience because I was so young I\ndidn't even know what therapy was but in\nthis space not only were we dealing with\nanxiety and depression but we were also\ndealing with family structure how can I\nshow up as the best version of myself so\nthat I can be the best brother that I\ncan be older brother at that and then\nalso simultaneously be the best son that\nI can be because the that was my first\nsense of Duty that I can really think of\noutside of being my own individual I\nrealized I had this other title I had\nsun and then soon thereafter I had big\nbrother and I really started to find out\nwhat those two terms meant through\nsitting down with Dr irons you really\nconnect with other people and I see that\nidentity is really tied to context of\nview and relationship with with your\nfamily yeah family is where it starts I\nbelieve and then we open from that to\nculture because then the wider scope or\nThe Wider lens looks at the fact that\nthis really nuanced and\num I would say it was somewhat of a\nbenefit that was offered to me and my\nbrother wasn't something that a lot of\npeople around me had the opportunity to\nexperience and I thank my mom for\nworking so hard for that because it's\nbeen something that has shaped the\nrelation that I have with both of them\nto this very day and so in those spaces\nI realized that relating to other people\nis not just something that you do to\nsurvive or to move yourself forward but\nit's something that's actually necessary\nto humanity we can't sort of exist\nisolated and finding ways of\ncommunicating are super important as\nwe've learned over the last maybe two\nand a half years as well so I'm glad\nthat those skills have sort of stuck\nwith me skills of being able to\ncommunicate relate with other people you\nmentioned your mom saw an opportunity\nthat's the way that you mentioned to get\nyou into you know what a lot of people\nwill say Services into therapy you are\nstruggling what would you say you\nremember about your own struggle not\nwhat your mom noticed about you but what\ndid you feel and if you even remember\nthat kind of thing I can honestly say in\nthe simplest form the things that I\nremember\nare\nbeing exceptionally present with myself\nbut not fully understanding what that\nmeant\nso there are these things happening\ninternally there are these thoughts that\nare running a little faster than I can\nkeep up with my body's responding in\nparticular ways that I'm not able to\ncheck and really bring back and before I\nknew it I was competing heavily in track\nand field it's something I did all the\nway up through college ran\ninternationally as well and I found\nmyself constantly in this not just a\nspace of Doubt but then also saying I'm\nnot the biggest on the field\nand sometimes when you perform in uh\nlike a space like Jamaica where we have\nlike the biggest high school track and\nfield meet in the Western Hemisphere\nHigh School Champs\num there's a lot of pressure because\nagain We're a nation where this is one\nof the ways that you can make your your\nway out big up to Usain Bolt us off a\nPowell\num hands of parchment those are some of\nthe people that I had the fortune of\nwhether being able to watch train or\nbeing part of a high performance track\nteam with Fitz Coleman those individuals\nbrought me into a space where I saw what\nwas tangible and I put a lot of pressure\non myself\num not just uh to perform but then also\nto make a mark my desire was to make a\nmark on the world and that was the first\nway I understood it and combination of\nlike just being in high school going\nthrough puberty and then also performing\nat a high level in a sport put me in\nthis intersection of well who's helping\nthis athlete to process what he's\nfeeling on and off the track and I think\nthat's the opportunity that my mom saw\nbecause\nthere was a big moment in high school\nwhere I just everything froze and it was\nmy actual my first absence seizure that\nI realized that I had and that was the\nimpetus to say hey\nhe's not having the craziest of physical\nresponses and that's how I ended up in\nmy first therapy session and in in that\nsession I imagine you had a lot going on\nyou said something really poignant here\nabout like being extremely self-aware\nbut not understanding what that means\nand now you're reflecting on that later\nin life you've gone through a lot of\nthings including that therapy so what do\nyou understand about yourself now that's\ndifferent from then when I was small\nthere were the doubts the pressures the\nas my favorite author Anthony C Winkler\nwould say like the little pasta that's\nin your head that's telling you right\nfrom wrong the voice that isn't yours\nyet the voice that is probably Societies\nor your families that is there to guide\nyou but no one necessarily sits down and\nallows that process to be\num a very present one where we detail\nlike how are you feeling actually what\nare you thinking about and how does life\nfeel for you and your little body right\nnow as you continue to develop and so in\nreflecting now I realize that I'm more\nskilled with these techniques I'm more\npatient with them as well\num as a kid you sort of want to\nunderstand you want to do you want to\nget done and yet at the same time you\ndon't have the understanding of how to\nprocess all of that and you might Center\nyourself under all the isms and schisms\nthat are around you and so now I found\nthat I give myself a bit more space to\nbreathe give myself a little bit more\ntime to relate not just to\num myself but to my environment and then\nI'm able to like analyze a bit more and\nthat allows me then with even some of\nthe things that I still deal with today\nthat may not have disappeared but\nthey're now instead of challenges or\nproblems they're friends that I can\nbring closer\nyou know and sit down and calm them down\nso that they don't rattle me\nbecause at the end of the day I'm still\nthe one in control\num my emotions are a reflection of the\ninternal side but they're actually not\nwhat makes the decisions Hey sir I just\nwanted to maybe just share a few\nobservations for our viewers and\nlisteners back at home or wherever you\nare what I love about watching a therapy\nsession in this way or a conversation\nwith a therapist is you get to notice\nthe really attentive listening that Jesu\nhas of like finding like something very\nspecific that you said and using that as\nan opportunity to ask a follow-up\nquestion which we don't always get in\nour day-to-day life I was I was thinking\nabout if you were sharing your\nvery honest truth on an everyday basis\nsometimes our friends and family they\ncan be really well intentioned but it's\nreally hard for them to ask a question\nthat does Justice to what you just\nshared and and to really create a space\nof listening very attentively and I\ncould see what ASU was picking out and\nI'm sure you felt it too that you you\nhad to sit and think oh wow yeah I just\nsaid that like what does that really\nmean\num and I think that that's one of the\nbeauties of therapy as well that you\nactually have someone who's sitting with\nyou who is listening far more\nattentively and skillfully than than\nmost of the people we meet uh every\nsingle day and then I was also just\nreflecting to what you said\nI I think that a lot of our listeners\nwill be able to\nempathize with what it feels like being\na young person who has pressure on them\nso whether it's sports or Athletics or\nwhether it's dance or gymnastics or\nwhether it's swimming or whether it's\nyou know whatever it is that any of us\ndid When We Were Young I think everyone\ncan empathize with that experience of\nfeeling like I'm not big enough I'm not\nthe F I'm not fast enough I'm not uh\nskillful enough like and and I can't\ncan't even imagine what it begins to\nfeel also when you feel that that is a\nmethod in your nation to to create some\nyou know impact in your life like that\nif you add that layer to it that's you\nknow a really remarkable layer so I just\nwanted to share some of those\nReflections quickly from what I was\nhearing as well uh through this session\nso if you're listening or watching right\nnow uh I hope you're appreciating and\ntaking in all of these cues thank you I\nmean you're noting\nI think a very key difference from\ntalking to people that you care about\nthat care about you your friends your\nfamily the folks that you generally want\nto turn to first when you're going\nthrough something\noftentimes when they respond when the\nfolks that love you are listening to you\nspeak they're trying to respond in a way\nthat's kind of like emotionally tied up\nin who you are in the relationship so\nyou're listening\nto respond with you in that response\nwhat therapists are generally doing are\nlistening to respond to you with you in\nmind I'm not responding with like\nanything that has to do with my life or\ntrying to connect it to something about\nme and that's what people do that's what\nfriends do with each other is I'm going\nto respond in a way that helps us\nconnect on this friend level so I'm\ngonna bring it back to like oh that\nreminds me of a time when I was in high\nschool and I was running track like\nyou're gonna find that therapist\ngenerally don't do that very much\nbecause the focus should remain on the\nclient so that is something that is is\nintentional and something that somebody\ncan expect when they go to therapy is\nthis person is here\nwith undivided attention to you which\nmost of us don't get in our everyday\nlife with anybody definitely you know it\nallows for a relationship to form but it\nis different it's different than what\nyou're gonna have with your friends you\nknow your loved ones yeah like it's like\nthat small bridge between them maybe\nlike a sympathetic relationship versus\nan empathetic relationship which the\nsympathetic to my understanding is oh\nI've experienced that too I know what\nthat feels like whereas what we're\nnoting now is just sitting down with the\nperson and being like\nI actually heard what you said and you\nmentioned this would you like to speak\nmore about that which allows for the\nperson that's actually going through\nsomething or the person that is coming\nfor help to actually express what they\nneed without\num this other perspective\ninterfering and not to say that it isn't\nhelpful sometimes because I I do believe\nthat in these sessions there are\nobviously moments of the oh I know what\nyou mean by that yet at the same time\nthey come even at more specific\ninstances and so it's really a pleasure\nbecause also as a man of color having\nthese conversations too can lead to some\nvery nuanced moments where those lines\nsort of get blurred for one or many\nreasons so this definitely feels great\nspeaking of connecting things back to\nsomething you just said what are these\nlines that get blurred well I think I\nfound that for me I've been fortunate to\nhave individuals of color black men and\nwomen for the longer sessions that I've\nI've been able to commit to and I say to\ncommit to because there's a reality that\ntherapy isn't always as affordable or\nconvenient with the world that we we\nlive in and so we're trying to through\nsomething like this make it feel more\ntangible and more accessible to people\nbut then being in America I have found\nthat if I do happen to work with a\ntherapist that may be of a different\nethnicity or a different race there are\nsome times where\num depending if I haven't done enough\nresearch or we haven't had enough time\ntogether those lines of like well\nI don't get to talk about this often\nlet's actually investigate this when the\nthis that they're investigating isn't\nwhat's most important to me it's the\nthat\num and the only reason I'm able to have\nthat a little bit extra of awareness is\nbecause my experience lets me know that\nI should be able to speak about the the\nthat and not the this you know it's if\nI'm understanding it sounds like\nyou've had experiences where the person\nin front of you is focusing in on\nsomething but that isn't necessarily\nwhat you want to talk about\num but it sounds like you're over there\nkind of taking care of this other person\ntoo thinking like oh I can understand\nwhy you would want to focus on that so\nthen you go with that which takes the\nfocus of that\nso what is the that for you right now\nwhat is something going on with you\nright now I'll share this is actually a\ngenuine concern of mine\num I've recently moved into a new\napartment\num the first time it's me my one bedroom\none bath taking care of myself\ncongratulations thank you very much I\nappreciate that and\none of the things I had to ask myself\nrecently is how safe I am in my\napartment we know the the context of\nwhat it means to to be in America and\nthanks to Morehouse College my\nundergraduate experience that the world\nisn't as Fair sometimes and we have seen\nthe stories on the news\nwe hear it on the radio we see the\nsocial media posts\num but Brianna Taylor's experience\nresonated with me in a very different\nway\nto know that you can be in your home in\nyour bed\nfast asleep that was something that it\nwas real but now that I am a hundred\npercent on my own\nsitting in that space\nI ask myself how do not even how do I\nprevent that\nbut is that a reality for me and the sad\nanswer in some senses is yes\nthere is the small chance that if I\nhaven't introduced myself properly to my\nneighbors\nor if I leave at different hours\nif I wear particular things I might be\nseen as suspicious instead of mysterious\nand cool you know that I always want to\nbe that low-key sexy neighbor like oh my\ngosh he's leaving he said oh he's coming\nback you know but the reality that I\nalso have to navigate is that before\nthey get to to meet me there are might\nactually be I guess\ncolored by the Hue of my skin\nand\nit's something that I have to be aware\nof regardless of of where I am and it\njust so happens that I live here and so\nall the contextual matters of like what\nit means to be black in America like\nsort of came back to me all at one time\nso thank you for sharing that for many\nother people who are describing to folks\nlike I just moved into my first place of\nmy own the first thing that a lot of\npeople are going to think is like that's\nawesome congratulations that's amazing\nand then you continue to share that\nactually you also have to be concerned\nabout your safety this is not something\nthat many people have to think about\num and you know as you're speaking I\nalso have a lot of my own emotional\nreaction to hearing you because our\nhomes are supposed to be our sanctuaries\nour homes are supposed to be the safest\nplace where we can let our hair down\nwhere we can feel comfortable where we\ndon't have to be on edge about anything\nwhat I'm hearing is up for you that is\nnot always the reality yeah and you want\nme to believe in this progress\nright and yet at the same time on the\nnews I am able to literally see a\nphysical representation of my features\ngoing through these extremely traumatic\nexperiences\nright I'm seeing it not only\num represented by people advocating for\nit but also sensationalized and\num debated\nas to whether\noh it's just or not\nwhen in reality there are so many faces\nthat look like mine that dream like I do\nthat sound like I do\nthat are\nslowly absorbing all of that information\nand without proper resources without\nspaces like this the discussion around\nempowering you in the face of that\nadversity is somewhat lost and that is\nprobably one of the goals of being a\nmore house man it's to be a candle in\nthe dark to represent that even though I\nknow this reality is around me this\nShadow might be following me that's a\nlot of pressure for yourself again\na lot of pressure to be light in a very\ndark world\nso what are the things you'd say in your\nlife that continue to motivate you to\novercome that pressure to meet that\npressure I think of my my granddad that\nrecently passed again we go back to\nfamily so needless to say my mom my\nbrother my my grandmother my my family\nbut outside of that in the world we get\nsome small glimmers of Hope\nand one of the ideas that I constantly\nhave is what's my hope and that happens\nto be my art what gives me hope is a\ngreat story but a story that doesn't\nreflect a lot of the stereotypes I don't\nknow if you all watched my favorite\nmovie of the year thus far\num everything everywhere all at once\nreally fantastic movie outside of that\nuh I love the world championships were\nearlier this summer you know big of\nChilean Fraser price Elaine Thompson\nbigger Panzer part the whole like\nanytime I can see people like thriving\num it's always big for me I I noted that\nthere must be an immense pressure to\ncontinue to share this light that you\nhave inside of yourself with other\npeople on top of also having to wonder\nif you're safe in your own home if\nyou're safe in any space like you said\num\nand it's hope that you come back to that\nallows you to move through this world\ncontinue navigating it gives you kind of\nthe freedom to continue to see Beauty in\nthe world\num what about times where it doesn't\nfeel so easy to do that well this is\nwhere the skills kick in is it not and\nso it's going to the skills that I have\nor taking a moment um grounding myself\nand when I say grounding myself\nsometimes it's the difference between a\nshallow breath and an actual deep breath\nand knowing the difference in my body of\nlike what that actually feels like\nthere's a lot of people don't know what\nit means to breathe you know below their\nrib cage\nand it's something that's uncanny to me\nbecause\num as an athlete I was also never taught\nto breathe I learned about it's like an\nimportant thing that's the important\nthing I learned about aerobic and\nanaerobic respiration but no one ever\ngave me an exercise to expand my lung\ncapacity right I'm putting my body under\nduress I'm putting my body under stress\nI like to use Sports as an analogy\nsometimes for life right and yet still\nthe one process that is going to go\nwhether or not your body is under that\nright the fire the part that fuels you\nis not so much so expounded on and so\nthe skills really come into play when\nI'm not feeling my best\num I typically in those dark moments\neither go to art\ngo to my loves or go to my my family\nit's all still about connection\nrelationships you know being together\num interconnectedness and it's making me\nthink of intersectionality how things in\nin all of our Lives meet each other in\nsome way it's clear that you're a person\nof the world that is absorbed you said\nthat you know life is an active choice\nthat you're doing all the time that you\nhave these skills that get you through\nthe more challenging times can you share\nwhere you started learning these skills\nif nobody taught you how to breathe\nwhere did you learn how to do that I\nhappen to be in these really amazing\nspaces collaborating with these great\npeople and I ended up working with after\ngrad school\num I ended up working with this Wellness\nbrand and while we were there in that\nspace that was my first introduction to\num probably like mindfulness in that\nextent\num sound healing those types of things\nand that was where there's a bit of\nInterest started to like develop\num but while I was pursuing my masters I\nwas conducting research and what I found\nis that all cultures across the world\nwhat connects us to the eurobod the\nGreeks the Ashanti the Aztecs is the\nfact that we all have the same\ninstrument can you actively make the\ndecision\nto go to your breath can you actively\nmake the decision to just relax your\nshoulders relax your forehead stop\nbiting on your jaw\nthese are always the things that we\ndon't realize that we're doing but no\none is ever saying to you hey\ntake a second and actually stop bracing\nbecause people think bracing means this\nyou going out there and grabbing the\nbull by that you know what I'm hearing\nis like even when\nmaybe you were conscious of it or not\npeople weren't teaching you things but\nyou went out to be taught by the world\nin some way or another you're an active\nstudent of life it sounds like in that\nthat Alaska learner and I'm also seeing\nthat this lifelong learner has taken all\nthe beauty that he's found and you\nreally want to share it with other\npeople you you mention your family a lot\nand you mentioned art and art is\nsomething to be seen art is something to\nbe experienced and something to move\nother people and it sounds like you've\nbeen moved you want to move other people\nI definitely do how can I do my work so\nthat my cup is somewhat full so that I\ncan water the next person so that I can\ngive just a little not everything\nbecause I need something for myself but\nI can't start until I've poured\nsomething as we've heard the angel\nsaying into the cup my mind keeps going\nback to something you said earlier\num the pressure that I don't know if\nit's a pressure that you felt for\nyourself off but a lot of people in your\ncommunity felt when you're in high\nschool to achieve to perform in a\nparticular space in order to get out I\nwould be remiss if I don't ask like do\nyou feel that kind of thing still\npresent in your life do you feel like\nthere are pressures to get out of\nsomething even if I do happen to make it\nto the place where I'm financially free\nand I'm able to\nprotect and provide for my family\nthere's also this question which I'm\nsure both of you have asked yourself how\ncan I help the The Wider World The Wider\nCommunity\num it's through things like this\ndefinitely but the beautiful aspect of\nit is that I don't think it ever stops\nbecause my reality is until I see things\nchange in the world around me that means\nthat there's still work to be done\nand the question that I I beg of myself\nis what can I do you've said so many\nthings that I I want to continue\nexploring with you but really it's like\nyou've done quite a lot of\nself-exploration is what I'm hearing\nit's interesting hearing you both\ncontinuing the conversation I think a\nlot of the time people have an\nassumption that\ntherapy or conversations around therapy\nend up being like these\ndeep dark secrets and these deep dark\nholes where it's like\nyeah I always feel like sometimes people\nfeel they have to invent a huge problem\nbefore a therapy session\nand people feel like oh well if I don't\nhave a really big problem in my life\nthen I don't need therapy and what I'm\nwhat I'm hearing today and and hearing\nthis conversation is actually we're\nspeaking to someone who has a great set\nof skills has some good good ideas and\ngood thoughts but\nwe're getting and I'm hoping you're\nfeeling this way and you're the only\nperson who can really tell us this but\nthere's a sense of like healthy\nreflection in and of yourself of your\nown ideas Jesus asking you questions\nthat are making you pause and and stop\nand and really think about\nwhere some of these strengths are where\nthey're not so I start looking at it so\nmuch more of a wholesome discussion as\nopposed to like\nI'm like in an emergency situation where\nI have a problem and I need a therapist\nto solve it which is often a feeling I\nthink people have where they're like I'm\nnot going to go to therapy because I\ndon't have that or I only go to therapy\nwhen I have something that extreme yeah\nand people have shared with me that they\nget stressed out before sessions because\nthey think that they're supposed to be\nprepared with this big problem that\nthey're supposed to bring up or you know\nI've been asked like what am I supposed\nto bring to you am I supposed to become\nprepared with something do I need to\nhave a topic on hand\num and I've shared with folks like it\ndoesn't always have to be that way of\ncourse if you have a topic on hand\nthat's something we're going to explore\nand dig deep into but you're right\ntherapy can also just be about digging\ndeep into you into\num something that's going on now\nrelating something that's happened in\nthe past to the present and it doesn't\nhave to be deep and dark although that\ndoes happen in therapy\num but it doesn't have to be that way\nit's not about like pathology or what's\nwrong with you or what's wrong with your\nmother or what wrong with anything\nsometimes it's so refreshing and healing\neven if there's no wound there\nnecessarily at the time but it's like a\nrefreshing thing to be able to just look\nInward and ReDiscover your values what's\nimportant to you because being able to\nreflect on this stuff externally I think\non a regular basis allows you to\ncontinue nurturing your sense of self\nand when you don't have a strong sense\nof self what it seems like you have a\nlike what's stronger than strongest you\nknow like a strong sense of self it is\nwhat allows you to you know have an\noutpouring of love for other people to\ninstill hope in others\num\nand continue to be influential\ninspirational these things don't happen\nif you don't know who you are two things\nto that my grandma always says you\nshouldn't eat because you are hungry you\nshould eat so that you do not get hungry\nthis is coming from a woman that at some\npoint knew what it meant\nto be right so I have learned that\ntherapy isn't necessarily because you\nneed the help at the moment it's so that\nyou can be prepared for that that moment\nwhere you might not actually have access\nto the therapist right\num and then the second thing is that the\nissues that I think that I've gone\nthrough are actually like chilling\nthey're actually a lot heavier than I\nthink maybe it sounds like in the moment\nbut I had to realize that the issue is\nalways going to be the issue it's your\nrelationship to the issue that is\npositive or negative right life is going\nto be what life is it's your\nrelationship to life that is either\npositive or negative it's a real thing\nfor me when I'm in particular\nneighborhoods\num I remember like working and\nperforming in in Europe and\num the first time I was in Poland I\nremember what the response was to me\nwhen I walked into certain spaces but my\nrelationship to those things is that\nagain not only am I a candle in the dark\nthat is allowed to feel what I feel but\nthen\nwhat can I do to shift this space\nto leave it better than I saw it you\nknow like\nI am the one person here that was born\nin the United States I was born here I\nwas raised here having said that I also\nlook like someone that has this like\nPerpetual Foreigner label stuck to them\num regardless of having been born here\nraised here educated here I still\nencounter on a fairly regular basis the\nidea from other people that I don't\nreally belong here that I am a visitor\nto this country\num which is weird because I'm the most\nAmerican one in this room right like and\num I think that experience like ever\nsince I was very small because my\nparents who decided to have their kids\nin this country and still name them like\nforeign like I have a very ethnic name\nand that is very much part of my\nexperience and my journey it shaped who\nI am it made things difficult when I was\na small kid but at this point it's not\nsomething I would want to change but I\nthink\nthat and like navigating the world in\nthis like yellow body it leaves this\nlike gaping hole this thing I'm trying\nto fill of wanting to be included of\nwanting to be accepted of wanting to be\nlong and and I think that's one of the\npillars of humanity it's like we're all\nlooking for that sense of belonging\nand I think you know my journey into my\nprofession and the career track I've\nchosen and everything that I've done at\nthis point is all related to that and\nyou said something about you know\ngetting to know\npeople on an individual level on a\none-on-one experience when I get to\nlearn about somebody else's life and\ntheir pain and their hope and their love\nit allows me to feel closer to that\nsense of belonging it's like we're all\nactually kind of the same in many ways\nregardless of all kinds of stuff and it\nallows me to feel included\num you know I entered a field too mental\nhealth is still very predominantly white\nand you know I find myself in\nprofessional spaces where I still feel\nlike the extreme minority which I think\nis still something that I grapple with\nit's still something that I'm navigating\nand still something I'm trying to feel\ncompletely comfortable with because\nultimately I can say that I feel\ncomfortable in my skin\nI feel good that I live authentically\nbut there are still contexts and there\nare still spaces and there are still\ntimes where I don't feel that same\nconfidence in myself and it's something\nI bring with me I think to my work\nbecause I know I look like a certain way\nand I know that people are thinking\nabout something as soon as they see me\nand and that's that's part of the work\ntoo and part of my uh personal and\nprofessional challenge is always feeling\nlike I have to prove myself and you know\nthe nice thing when I'm in an actual\ntherapy session when it's just me and\nthis other person a lot of that pressure\nactually dissipates it's not really\nthere as much because as soon as this\nother person starts to recognize that\nthey can feel safe because I'm not here\nto talk about anything that would make\nthem feel othered in this one-on-one\ninteraction I feel accepted by them too\nmy clients and I think that's what\nintersectionality is about\num even for example you sharing that\nallows me to feel like you can\nunderstand my plight\na little bit more because it's also one\nthing that I've noticed because\nthere are individuals that may look like\nus\nthat also don't have that awareness\neither right\num and growing up in Jamaica I was\nreally fortunate to be able to grow up\nand see black billionaires to see\ndoctors that look like me to have\nteachers both male and female that looks\nlike me and when I went to Morehouse I\nwas very fortunate to have that continue\nbut I will let you know that since\nleaving Morehouse almost every\ninstructor that I've had every teacher\nthat I've had in my master's program I\ndid not have one black instructor\ndirectly teach me I had to go out and\nfind\nin the department right and one of the\nthings that really grounded me was\nactually knowing that I know that it's\npossible\num and I think that's also like a\ndouble-edged sword because knowing\nwhat's possible and then being in a\nspace where it's not visibly seen it\nthen frustrates you because it's like\nwhy isn't it happening but the reality\nis that if we can be intentional and\ncreative and mindful in not just our art\nbut the way that we live the impact that\nwe'll have is so much longer lasting\nthat we can literally shape the way\npeople are going to experience the world\nwell I mean hearing from you today\nI mean I feel very uh inspired by your\ncommitment to the work that is so\nimportant to your heart not just to your\nheart which is so important to the world\nright like this is work that I think we\nall believe is valuable and needed and\ncritical it's not even you know it's not\na it's not a luxury there's a this is\njust a necessity for what we need is\nhumankind but\nwhat I find\nvery indicative is that the work that\nyou've been able to do with your family\nthrough the amazing experiences that\nyou've had thanks to your family\nthrough the work that you have done in\ntherapy has given you the ability to now\ngo out and want to share this message\nwith the world like that's that's what\nat least what I mix and you can totally\nagree disagree but that that's what I'm\nperceiving in someone like you where\nyou've been through your pain you've\nbeen through challenges of course we're\nalways going through pain and challenges\nbut you're someone who's created a\ntoolkit for yourself whether it's the\ntools that you develop through therapy\nor you know and so now you're in a\nposition of strength and empowerment in\nwanting to go and be this light that we\nwere discussing and dealing with the\npressure of being that light but that's\nsome of the work that so many people are\ntrying to do\nright now is even feeling like I think\nI think we all know that it's hard to be\nthe light when\nall you've seen is Darkness\nand\nwe know we don't want people to\nprematurely try and be the light and at\nthe same time we also know that\nultimately when you've walked out of\nyour own Darkness it's great to turn the\nlight on for others right so much of\nwhat therapy is doing is helping us make\nsense of our emotional and mental self\nin order to figure out what we want to\ndo in the outside world and\nit sounds like that's work that you've\nbeen doing and continue to do which is\ngiving you a sense of strength to try\nand help others right now and I think we\nas human beings have the capacity to\ndevelop that unlimited toolkit but it's\nnot until we have great teachers and\ncollaborators\num access to information access to basic\nhuman needs that we can stop thinking of\nsurvival\nand we can then start to thrive and so I\nhave to give thanks for the blessings\nthat I have thank you so much Ilona\nthank you hey so did you have any final\nwords or remarks for us for today that\nyou wanted to share\num wish I had something Super Wise my\nrelation to that is is that's part of\nwhat I think I aim to have my clients\nstrive for in therapy is integration of\nseparate pieces of self integration of\nyou know all these different components\nthose are all very important things that\nI I think about in conceptualizing a\nclient case also really integrating all\nthese things that may feel\ndisconnected or disjointed is what\nallows you to continue to be authentic\nand and move through the world as\nsomebody that you feel really\ncomfortable being somebody that you want\nto be around thank you so much for\nsharing\nthat everyone has been listening and\nwatching at home\nI hope today's episode has been uh\nenlightening in so many different ways\nin\nnot only the process of therapy which is\nwhat we started with but in helping each\nand every one of us recognize more\ncoherently\nthe amount of work that we need to do as\nindividuals uh and as a society I think\nthat's ultimately what I always take\naway in these conversations is just\nhow much progress\nwe need to make individually and\ncollectively and I think anyone who's\nlistening to on purpose is dedicated to\nthat believe that everyone is dedicated\nto their personal growth and the growth\nof the society around them and when we\nrecognize that those two things are not\ndisconnected that they're actually one\nand the same\nI often say to people if we care about\nourselves then we care about our kids\nthat's obvious and then when you care\nabout your kids you care about your kids\nschool and then when you care about your\nkids school you care about your kids\ntown and when you care about your kids\ntown you care about your kid's City and\nthen when you care about your kids City\nyou you can't if you care then your care\ndoesn't stop and I think when we take a\nmoment to invest in our own selves and\nour self-care and then expand that\nradius out uh we can create a better\nSociety for all so thank you so much\neveryone has been listening and watching\ntoday uh thank you to ulada Sam for\njoining us opening your heart opening\nyour mind uh Jesus thank you so much for\nalways guiding us and helping us\nnavigate these wonderful conversations\nuh and to everyone
