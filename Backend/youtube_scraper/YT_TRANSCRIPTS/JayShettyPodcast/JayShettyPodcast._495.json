narcissism\nat its impact on relationships now I\nknow all of you are fascinated by\nrelationships narcissism and your mind\nthere's no one better than Dr Romney uh\nDr Romney thank you so much for doing\nthis that's a very big introduction so I\nI hope I can live up too oh it's true\nand I think we have we've been in so\nmany rooms we have a lot of mutual yeah\nwe do yeah uh people that we work with\nand I I really mean it like I I love the\nway you listen and I love the way you\narticulate what you're hearing and\nconnecting and putting the dots together\nand you're so in demand so to actually\nhave you here today is is really really\nspecial I I wanted to start off by\nunderstanding a bit about how you came\nto this work and like how narcissism\nbecause today you're known as the person\nwho knows\nliterally everything about narcissism\nalways deeply studying it when did\nnarcissism become an obsession or a\nfocus or a point of study for you it's\nsort of around 2004 2003 thereabouts and\nit was it was in a research capacity\nlooking at what was happening in\nhealthcare settings when you had really\ndemanding antagonistic uh entitled\npatience and the toll that was taken in\nhealthcare settings which seems so\nobvious but that led me to do a deeper\ndive and I realized how little this had\nbeen researched in sort of Health Care\nsituations I was specifically working in\nthe area of HIV and so that started a\nresearch program at that same time I\nalso had a clinical practice and in my\nclinical practice you know more and more\npeople were kind of coming in with the\nsame relationship story because I was\nstudying narcissism in my research I'm\nthinking how interesting let me just\nshed this light on the patterns they're\nseeing that are quite antagonistic and\nand that just knowing that and they said\nwell can this change in the answer to\nthat's pretty much no once they knew it\ncould really be shifted that much it\ntotally changed their point of view and\nlifted a lot of self-blame so those were\nthe two things kind of happening and\nthat honestly should I say or should I\ngo my first book on narcissism came from\nafter the sessions these clients were so\noverwhelmed they'd often say could you\njust put this in an email right and I\nreally felt for them because I could see\nit was a real real deer in the\nheadlights experience so I'd knock out\nyou know something in an email it also\nhelped me organize my thoughts and then\nI thought okay I keep writing the same\nemail so\nlet's just make that a book so when the\nworld started sort of going upside down\nI thought this is interesting I am going\nto approach this topic because I thought\nwell this is actually what's happening\nright now and\neveryone was using the word a lot of\npeople weren't using it correctly and\nthat's where that came from\nthen from there was where it got\ninteresting was\nI'm a writer that's what I do but two\nyoung people approached me former\nstudents that had said\nthey were student they were finishing\nschool at the time they said you knew\nyou should really be on YouTube and I\nsaid that's ridiculous you know at my\nage it didn't make sense it wasn't how I\nconsumed media\nand they said let's let's take a few\nmonths let's see what kind how it how\nthis space works and over time years of\nsort of honing it and tuning it and all\nof that that was actually where all of a\nsudden this reach happened on this\nYouTube channel so it was an evolution\nbut what I found was where the real sort\nof pivot was for me the world of mental\nhealth was not recognizing what was\nhappening to people in these\nrelationships and that's when I got\nangry and to me anger is a great\nmotivator I thought these people have\nbeen going to therapists and being\ninvalidated and maybe it's how you\ncommunicate and maybe you weren't trying\nhard enough and I thought oh my goodness\nand that's really for me when it sort of\nfelt like a revolution I thought\nsomething's got to give and if this\nmeans that people are gonna say you know\nwhat's wrong with you and you have a\nTarget on your back I mean I've been\ncalled every name in the book and people\nsaid this is an unempathic therapist how\ncould she and I thought oh my goodness\nlike I thought people are trying to shut\nthis discourse down through shame\nand I thought nah let's just keep going\nI'm old enough to not really care what\npeople think about me anymore and so I\num that's that's really where it came\nfrom and now that's just sort of the\nfocus the narcissism piece to me is\ninteresting from a scientific Framing\nand all of that but the real passion for\nme is working with people who have been\nthrough these relationships and have\nnever really felt recognized seen or\nheard to help them with their healing\nand help them find themselves so they\nfeel that they can stand on their own in\nthe world and actually have their voice\nagain that's the mission yeah so\nimportant and so needed and I'm so glad\nthat you're doing it I feel like this is\nmore common as An Occurrence today than\nthan ever before and do you think that's\nbecause narcissism was somewhat hidden\nfor many years in the sense that it just\nhappened behind closed doors or like why\nis it only now that we're talking about\nit so much that's such a good question\nJay you know and it's almost like\nwithout giving you too pedantic a\nhistory lesson is that people have been\nthe word narcissism in this application\nlike about other people didn't really\neven start coming into the literature\nuntil maybe the very late 1800s early\n1900s then some psychoanalytic theorists\ntalked about it but it was a really\nquiet Backwater in the world of mental\nhealth and mental health and psychology\nare new Fields it wasn't even until 1980\nwhere we saw it come with the idea of\nnarcissistic personality disorder which\nis its own issue this is very recent to\nme what is that you know 40 not even 50\nyears ago and so the this people have\nbeen narcissistic since there have been\npeople and and actually an interesting\nframing on it can actually come from\nthere's fascinating work and if if\nyou've never read it I can't recommend\nthis book enough the book behave by\nRobert zapolski maybe one of the most\nextraordinary books I think has been\nwritten in the last 10 years and to me\nsapolski is is a giant in in all Fields\nrelated to to psychology and he makes\nthis incredible he he lays he's talking\nabout aggression sort of why are why do\npeople behave aggressively why do people\nbehave badly and we do know the science\nhas shown it narcissism is associated\nwith aggression and violence like this\nisn't just like oh these people are a\nhandful there's actually a risk here and\nwe're not addressing this risk but when\nyou look at what he says you see look\nwhen you look at the evolution of human\nhistory he said what we do see is a\ngreater level of antagonism in people\nwho came more from cultures where they\nwere hurting hurting animals goats\nwhatever cows why because you could\nsteal those things but people who are\npastoralists people who farmed you\nreally can't go get up and steal a field\nI guess you could steal some of the ears\nof corn but you're not going to make off\nwith the whole field farming is more\ncollaborative hurting is more individual\nso if you go back and that is we're\ntalking hundreds if not thousands of\nyears of human history how people sort\nof interacted through the world\neconomically you look at history lessons\nI remember my daughter was taking world\nhistory we had a very long drive to\nschool so I said why don't you teach me\nwhat you learned on the way to school\nshe'd study I'd learned something but\nwhat I thought over and over again over\n500 years of world history a lot of\ndrives over many years is that what we\nwere seeing is that these people in the\nhistory books were all very antagonistic\nthey were all very narcissistic they\ndidn't have empathy they were arrogant\nthey were aggressive they were\ncontrolling they lacked empathy they had\nto be the hero like it was always the\nsame story so I actually think\nnarcissism narcissistic relationships\nall of this has been around since time\nimmemorial it was only because\npsychology is a field in its relative\ninfancy that we're only talking about it\nin this way now and it is only in the\nlast 15 years that we have actually\nstarted paying attention to the harm\nthis personality style does to the other\nperson in a relationship it's incredible\nisn't it when you look at it from that\nperspective about how long people have\nsuffered from or suffered with something\nbecause our learning was still catching\nup with its experience and you think\nabout anyone who hasn't lived in the\nlast 15 to 25 years\nthey potentially were called names\nOutcast misunderstood unheard unseen as\nyou're saying apps I mean Jay I have\nworked with clients who are older okay\nso they've been in 30 40 50 year\nmarriages that have been difficult from\nthe very very beginning\nand they said you know what it wasn't\nuntil I watch your videos It wasn't\nuntil I read your books it wasn't until\nthe last five to ten years that this\nfinally had a name and until then I\nassumed it was my fault I wasn't trying\nhard enough I was complaining I was\nbeing unrealistic about what a marriage\nshould look like that's what they were\nthey were basically in essence turning\nit back on themselves blaming themselves\nand culture wasn't helping you know\npeople saying well I guess you're not\nmarriage is tough you have to make\ncompromises that's just how they are\nthey don't mean it their bark is worse\nthan their bite and so people would\ninternalize that and if you really want\nto look at it this way even historically\nwe didn't really start talking about\ndomestic violence until the late 60s\ninto the 1970s that's when Lenora Walker\nmade the whole sort of you know the the\ncircle of abuse and in a relationship\nand all of that this is all new and that\nwas in the 70s to this day we still do\nnot Accord emotional abuse the same\nlevel as as we do physical abuse and yet\nI've got to tell you everyone who's\nphysically abused is emotionally abused\nbut emotional emotionally abused people\nare showing up with the same level of\nsymptomatology often the same level of\npost-traumatic kinds of um decrements\nand functioning you name it so we're see\nit is this is all slowly evolving\ninterestingly the field of mental health\nis still slow to catch up that's\nsomething that's got to change yeah\nabsolutely no I'm so glad we're having\nthis conversation and thank you for\nletting us go on a history lesson\nbecause I think it's really important\nquite frankly to understand to really\nget context of where we are\nseeing as you said these words are\nthrown around now and they're also\neverywhere and you've probably done this\na million times but for our audience\ncould you please define narcissism and\nthen narcissistic personality disorder\nbecause I do feel now as you said a lot\nof people are using this on a daily\nbasis and while it's healthy that our\nlanguage is evolving I do often find\nthat people also get wrongly labeled or\nearly labeled or whatever it may be I\ntotally agree this is a big problem\nstruggle call it what you will is that\nso narcissism is a personality style\nokay so not if a personality style could\nbe anything including narcissism\nagreeableness\nintroversion neuroticism those are all\npersonality Styles right so narcissism's\non the Shelf with them now we would view\nnarcissism which sits under a bigger\numbrella called antagonism as a more\nmaladaptive style because their behavior\nCan often put them at odds with other\npeople things like the entitlement the\narrogance the manipulativeness the\ngrandiosity these are sort of really\nuncomfortable patterns that's narcissism\nokay now when we jump the rails to\nnarcissistic personality disorder it's a\nwhole different game\nthe reason people really get kind of a b\nin their Bonnet about this needs to be\ndiagnosed by a licensed mental health\npractitioner is because in order for a\nperson to be diagnosed with a mental\nillness not only do they have to have a\nlaundry list of whatever is associated\nwith that whether it's depression\nanxieties schizophrenia bipolar disorder\nsubstance use disorders doesn't matter\npersonality disorders are the same so\nyou have to have that list and this is\nthe ringer you have to be able to show\nthat that person is either experiencing\nsomething we call subjective distress\nmeaning that they're uncomfortable\nor social and occupational impairment\nmeaning that their life is kind of\ngetting wrecked by this and they're\naware of it it's a lot of awareness and\ndiscomfort that many people who are\nnarcissistic don't have in fact they're\nkind of sitting on top of the world they\ngot a partner they got a side piece\nthey've got a they've got money they've\ngot success they've got power they're\nthinking I ain't got no problems now\nthey're burning down everyone around\nthem but you cannot diagnose someone\nbecause someone else is unhappy with\ntheir behavior that's not what our\ndiagnostic systems were designed to do\nso when we get into these antagonistic\ndisorders like narcissistic personality\ndisorder it's pretty rare that people\nwith these personalities get into\ntreatment and when they do it's for some\nother reason their marriage is blowing\nup they're sub they're using substances\nin some cases they're depressed\nsomething's gone wrong at work they've\nbeen involved in something sort of\npublicly that makes them look bad so\nthey go to therapy to say face so the\nthing that gets them into therapy is not\nlike oh I've noticed I don't have much\nempathy and I'm really entitled and\narrogant I'm looking for help with that\nsaid no one ever okay so what they're\ncoming in with something else often very\narrogantly like okay I see your fancy\ncertificates on the wall doc so how long\nis it going to take you to fix me I'm\npaying a lot for your time very\ndismissive very arrogant now every so\noften you'll see a narcissistic not\nevery so often not uncommonly in people\nwho have narcissistic personality\ndisorder they may also have something\nelse going on like depression or anxiety\nor like I said a substance use disorder\nthe therapist is going to focus as we do\non the more acute issue the depression\nthe anxiety substance use disorder and\nthey'll try to manage that right through\na combination of therapy maybe\nmedication whatever they use\ntime goes on the mood's lifting a little\nor the anxiety is managed or they're\nsober but they're still really awful and\nentitled and arrogant and all this other\nstuff and because a lot of therapists\ndon't bring personality stuff into the\nroom they don't think about it they're\nthinking that maybe I'm not doing this\nright this person still is not like\nthey're still not behaving nicely but\nthey're not using anymore and they seem\nto be their sleep seems to be better and\nso you see what I'm saying the\npersonality is like the Baseline it's\nthe thrum under the other stuff that's\nhappening on top that's the disorder a\nperson you have a personality I have a\npersonality for example I'm introverted\nokay Believe It or Not incredibly\nintroverted person that is my\npersonality it is not going to change\nnext week I am not going to be the life\nof the party okay On Any Given Saturday\nnight I tell you the probabilities I am\nhome reading a book watching TV or doing\nsomething ridiculous at home but I am at\nhome okay\nI can't change that if you said to me\nwell come on Doctor we're gonna make you\nextroverted I'm like no you're not and\nand if you said but you have to become\nextroverted I might be able to stretch\nmyself but I'll collapse or I'll be\nexhausted or you know what I'm saying so\nthat's personality it is who we are it's\na psychological fingerprint of sorts but\nit's always right under the surface so\nyou're not going to make the introvert\nan extrovert you're not going to make\nthe neurotic person more sort of um\nrelaxed and impulsive you're not going\nto take a conscientious person and turn\nthem into someone who is sort of acts\nout impulsive and doesn't plan these\npersonalities sort of set who we are and\nso this is the in the case of people who\nhave narcissistic personalities they\nhave very disagreeable personalities\nthey have antagonistic personalities\nthat's the difference and so before\npeople say it I'm like I'll say does\nthis person have a lack of empathy are\nthey entitled do they seek validation\nsometimes people say well I think he's\nnarcissistic because he cheated on me\nI'm like well he cheated on you that's\nall I got here yeah I don't know if this\ndude's narcissistic you'd have to tell\nme a little bit more about this person's\nbehavior and I think people are using\nthis as a buzzword to to label or or\ntalk about someone who did something\nthat aggravated them and you got to\nremember narcissism is not a one-off\nokay so if one day someone did something\nlike having a bad week but in general\nthey're a very even tempered warm\ncompassionate kind mindful a self-aware\nperson that's who they are most of the\ntime but then\n20 things are going wrong parent is sick\nchild is sick job is going badly and\nthey're a little bit more short fused\nbut they're even saying I am not at my\nbest I am so sorry cut me a wide birth\nyou know I'm so so and they're very\naware that they're not behaving well\nthey may they're not they're not\nbehaving well in that case isn't\nnarcissism it may just be a bad week\nthat's such a great uh explanation and I\nhope everyone who's listening and\nwatching I hope that's giving you real\ncontext and a wider perspective on on\nhow this all fits together thank you so\nmuch for that genuine monster class as I\nguess what I want to start is do we do\nwe have any understanding well how much\nis our current understanding on how\npeople end up with a narcissistic\npersonality because I think that's\nhealthy for people to have context over\ntoo like you said like whatever\npersonality we are we can't change that\ncore root base of it so it's worth\nknowing how we ended up there because\nagain whether we're parents whether\nwe're thinking of being parents whether\nwe're navigating the world been\nconcerned about ourselves or someone in\nour life it helps us understand what are\nsome of those facets or elements that\nbrought people into being narcissist as\na personality right so this is where it\ngets interesting right so personality is\na funny little thing where it's it's\nthere's a little bit of a genetic piece\nto it and that genetic piece is\nsomething we call temperament okay so we\nall have temperaments and we see it even\nin babies some babies you hold them in\ntheir arms your arms they soothe like\nthis they're easy they're Smiley they're\noften they're just content you know and\nthey and they're often kind and even as\nsoon as that point where they're sort of\naware of who other people are and\ntoddlerhood they come into preschool age\nthey're very aware they'll take their\ncookie they'll split it in half there's\nsome kids like that right then there are\nthose kids who no matter what you do\nthey arch their back and they cannot be\nsoothes then they're and they always\nneed attention and they always want\nattention and they're mean to their\nsiblings and they take not only the one\ncookie but they take all the cookies\nright that stuff that biological stuff\nis foundational in many ways to our\npersonalities I'd say to everyone if you\nhave access to anyone who knew you early\nin life see how well like they describe\nyour infancy or your toddlerhood and how\nwell it tracks to who you are now every\nso often is a shrink I get to talk to\nlike a parental figure in that person's\nlife never been wrong yet every time\nthat baby temperament toddler\ntemperament tracks into I'm sure you\nwere a sweet baby I am so sure I called\nyour mom she'd say Jay is the sweetest\nlittle baby\nno oh my God no they'll say oh this one\nno definitely not and I was a super\nsuper super sweet baby you know and I\nthink I'm a pretty sweet adult actually\nyou know but a little intense but sweet\nyou know I can relate to that you know\nbut I bet you were and so that\ntemperament forms like a seed all right\nthat's a seed right there\nthat temperament is how the world reacts\nto us that kid who's on won't be soothed\nand needs attention and needs to\ncartwheel through the living room the\nworld doesn't like the kid that kid that\nmuch right they go through babysitters\ndon't like them parents just a little\nbit of eye rolling kids are perceptive\nand it might even affect attachment\nbecause the parent is so exhausted\nthey're dealing with that tough child it\ncould even impair attachment experiences\nand then they go into school teachers\ndon't like them as much even peers might\nbe frustrated by them they're having\nmore invalidating experiences right\nthat's a little bit of some of the seed\nof what we see can be narcissism right\nbecause narcissism also has an\nattachment piece to it in general people\nof narcissistic personalities often have\nmore anxious or avoidant uh attachment\nStyles a little bit more anxious than\nanything else and why that might be it\nmight be that there was chaos in the\nfamily there may have been you know a\nbad relationship between the parents the\nparents may have been distracted with\ntheir own lives they couldn't be\nbothered with having kids\num there may have been literal violence\nmental mental illness whatever substance\nuse something was happening in that\nearly environment that may have impacted\nthe attachment experience that's also\nassociated with narcissism we know that\nin some cases trauma early in life is\nassociated with narcissism but that gets\ntricky because in the vast majority of\ncases it's not because the person might\nsay well I had trauma in childhood I'm\nnot narcissistic yeah that's the bet I\nwould take but we do see that sometimes\nespecially if that impacts attachment\nthat that's going to make a difference\nthose are sort of what I consider more\nof the sort of the difficult early\ncircumstances the adverse childhood\nexperience origins of narcissism however\nthere's another side to it which is the\noverindulged kind of Pathway to\nnarcissism it's like think of narcissism\nas Rome and multiple roads coming into\nRome right\nand in the in the sort of overindulged\nPathways this is where you see sort of\nyour standard spoiled kid\nthe parents will give the kid anything\nthe things and experiences and money but\nhere's the ringer and it was a very\ninteresting study that came out a couple\nof years ago where it's not just the\nspoiling\nbut it's telling the child\nyou're more special than any of these\nother kids not just that you're special\nthat's a lovely message but you're more\nspecial\nyou don't that Line's not for you you\nknow the other kids wait in that line\nI'll figure you're too special to wait\nin that line that sort of that you're\nbetter than the others you're more\nspecial than the others which a\nnarcissistic parent may do to their\nchild and that's how we'll sometimes see\nnarcissistic parents May beget\nnarcissistic kids but not as a rule so\nbut all these Pathways I'm describing\ndon't always end up in narcissism why\nsome end up that way I do think the\ntemperament piece probably pays a bigger\nrole than we think and I've worked with\nmany many narcissistic clients over my\nyears of practice and I've seen all of\nthese etiology origin Pathways play out\nbut depending on the origin that will\naffect how the narcissism looks in\nadulthood the more kind of traumatizing\nneglect origin will result in\nnarcissistic people who are a bit more\num Sullen resentful aggrieved sad\nsocially anxious whereas the spoiled\nchild narcissism will end up a little\nbit more grandiose wow so that that if\nhope that makes it a little bit clearer\nyeah yeah it's a lot of color right I\nmean I think one of the biggest\nchallenges we see is that\nwhen I speak to people whether I'm\nworking with them or I meet them or when\nthey're working with a therapist and\nthen I'm connecting with them in another\npart of their life most people don't\nrealize they're with someone\nnarcissistic until after they leave like\nwhen you write a book should I stay or\nshould I go\nI've found a lot of people figuring out\ntowards the end it's not something you\nspot very quickly at least when people I\nknow and I would love to hear your\nexperience you obviously you've done\nthis for so long you you've had so many\nconversations around this I found that\nit's not something that people spot very\nearly or sometimes their early signs of\nit even seem positive or it seems that\nit can be attractive like you said a lot\nof people who are narcissistic can be\nambitious they can be successful they\ncould have achieved a lot of things\nthrough that pain that trauma so walk us\nthrough now if we're in that should I\nstay or should I go mode that's the name\nof Dr Romney's book as well so as we're\ntalking about it feel free to order that\nbook when you're in that position and\nyou start to sense there's some\nnarcissism in the person you're with a\nwhat are you gonna sense what are the\nthings that people usually notice why\ndon't we notice it early on like what\nabout narcissism is somewhat is it can\nit be attractive it's very attractive\nand here's the ringer in these\nrelationships\nI people want the narcissistic people to\nbe the cartoon villain right they want\nit to be in your face bad mean\nlying deceitful betraying all the time\nright well that would be easy No One's\nGonna put up with that the challenge\nwith these relationships whether it's a\nparent whether it's a partner colleague\nfriend sibling you name it\nis that there's often enough good days\nin there to keep you hooked all these\nqualities charm Charisma confidence\nambition being fun loving being\nextroverted\num wanting to have all kinds of\ninteresting experiences narcissistic\npeople are very sensation seeking\nthey're novelty seeking it can be really\nfun that's why we talk about the love\nbombing that happens at the beginning of\nthese relationships and what happens is\nwhen I've worked with people especially\nthose who've been in longer term\nrelationships they'll say Doc it isn't\nalways bad it wasn't always bad but the\nbad is really bad like the bad leaves me\nwondering if I'm any good and I feel\nlike a bad person and I feel like I'm\nthe one with the problem and on and on\nand on right but then there are those\ngood days and the person will often say\nsee I was the one who is wrong I'm being\nI'm being too demanding I've got this\nsilly notion of what a relationship's\nsupposed to be and I can set a clock on\nthe fact that it's going to go back into\nthe downward so I think that that's one\nthing I want everyone listening to this\nto know is that people say well maybe\nthis person in my life isn't that\nantagonistic maybe they're not that\nnarcissistic because we have these good\ndays plan on the good days it's like\nbeing in a relationship or it's like be\nliving someplace where the weather is\nalways extreme it's either like 85\ndegrees and sunny or like the most\nhorrific hurricane blizzard and that\nweather alternates like on an every few\ndays basis sometimes and so as a result\nof that it confuses people to no end it\nisn't always bad there were good moments\nthere are good memories and that's what\nconfuses people so this idea of\nrecognizing someone in my own podcast\nnavigating narcissism we've done now 30\nepisodes right it's amazing 30 episodes\n30 conversations about narcissism and in\nevery in many of these cases what I've\nseen especially in the intimate\nrelationships somewhere around one two\nthree years things were becoming clear\nalthough you see the red flags as soon\nas like the first month\nthe piece is turning into something like\npixels right a couple of pixels teach\nyou nothing lots of pixels make a\npicture and it takes a couple of years\nfor a lot of folks to get enough pixels\nto say okay there's no not seeing this\nbut by then they may be so deep into it\nthat cognitive dissonance kicks in and\nyou want it to work so you tell yourself\nwhatever story you need to tell yourself\nso the relationship can sustain well we\nhave enough good good times maybe it's\nmy fault I'm being too demanding you'll\nsee this especially if a person is\ntrying to find a relationship at a\npressured time of life they want to have\nkids they feel pressure to get married\nwhatever it may be but even in a family\na person will say I can't walk away from\nmy parents even though every interaction\nthe person has with them is wretched and\nand my job is to help people find that\nmiddle ground of having realistic\nexpectations but I do think that when\npeople red flags are always a story that\ncan be told retrospectively like okay\nthere was a red flag on the first date\nthere's a red flag in the first month\neveryone will say like okay all that\nbeing late or you know all that\num telling me that they told me not to\napply to that school because they cared\nabout me and didn't want me to feel like\nI was you know they didn't want to watch\nme go through the school telling me that\nI couldn't get in but in fact what they\nwere doing is holding them back on their\ndreams like the pixels turn into a\npicture and I think that that it does\ntake time and a lot of people will feel\nembarrassing how did it take me two\nyears to see this to which I say two\nyears is fast good for you and when the\nlove bombing ends and love bombing lasts\nanywhere from six weeks to a year I\nthink that's about the range and so when\nthe love bombing ends and the devaluing\nstarts people are almost this on this\nweird addictive treadmill of like how do\nI get back to that yeah and what and\nwhat do I need to change in myself never\nstopping to think oh okay this person\nbrought their a game for about three\nmonths they've shifted I have not\nchanged so if you can see it clearly\nthese you can see the patterns clearly\nthings like you know they'll get\nincredibly sensitive to criticism\nthat's a very common pattern in\nnarcissistic folks and so everything\nwill be going well and a person's\nfeeling more comfortable they might give\nthem feedback I don't know what they're\nwearing or the restaurant they chose or\ntheir job and a rage that feels like a\ntsunami will enter the relationship and\nthe person will be like what the heck\njust happened those ego injuries can\nreally result in these volcanic kinds of\nyou know sorts of shows of emotion\nthat's when people start getting\nconfused and saying maybe I was harsh\nmaybe I shouldn't have said that and so\nthat what we see invariably is the\nsurvivors in these relationships take it\nupon themselves to try to change\neverything about themselves believing\nthey can change the other person and if\nthere's only one takeaway here it's that\nnarcissism like all maladaptive\npersonality Styles is really resistant\nto change the more maladaptive the\npersonality the more rigid it is the\nmore healthy and flexible the\npersonality the more given to take so\nagreeable people are incredibly flexible\nso even if they don't want to do\nsomething they might think like I love\nher you know she wants to go and I'm you\nknow what they've always been there for\nme so I'm going to go to the horror film\nfestival might cover my eyes but then\nthink that that's the give and take of a\nrelationship and won't be angry about it\nthat's the flexibility narcissism is the\nopposite it's like it's solid as a brick\nyeah wow and and I think that when\npeople end up in those scenarios or\nthose experiences we have this\nyou you raised this point that we almost\ntry and counteract bad memories with\ngood memories like we that's how we like\nto make sense of someone is well if they\ndo a bad thing how many good things do\nthey do or if they do a good thing how\nmany bad things do they do right if we\ndon't like someone overall we'll come up\nwith a list of mistakes they made if we\nlike someone will come up with a list of\ncompliments they made what's a healthier\nway of making sense of someone because I\ndon't find good and bad to be that\nhealthy as you said it could mislead you\nI always say to people you've got to be\nable to be comfortable with this concept\nof multiple truths okay multiple things\ncan be true at the same time you could\nhave had a wonderful courtship you may\nhave great sex\nyou this person may regularly Gaslight\nyou this person lies to you\nyou really love how they cook spaghetti\nthey're wonderful with your infant they\noften raise their voice at you do you\nsee what I'm saying all of these things\nare happening at the same time\nthe hardest thing I believe a human\nbeing can do\nis to sit with those multiple truths and\nnot run away it is the ultimate test of\nmindfulness because we want we cognitive\ndissonance our brains are wired\nthey're not wired for inconsistency\nthey're wired for consistency and when\nthings are inconsistent we feel very\ntense we feel very uncomfortable and the\nhuman species gears towards homeostasis\nI need to not feel tense the best way to\nnot feel tense is figure out okay I want\nto stay in this relationship so he's a\ngood father what more could you want\nright now you can argue the flip side of\nthat too when a person's for some reason\nfeels ready to leave a relationship they\nmay say they may cherry pick all the a\nfew bad things and forget how much you\nknow that this person's actually really\nwell regulated and kind and\ncompassionate and all of that I think\npart of the struggle becomes what\nconstitutes a healthy relationship in\nany culture without that agreed upon\ndefinition I think that's half the\nbattle so when people say to me what's a\nhealthy relationship I'm like oh easy\nit's kind it's compassionate it's\nflexible it is respect full it is\ncooperative it's collaborative there's\nthere's you know equitability and it may\nnot it may be that there's very clear\nroles but there's a perceived sense of\nequitability in the relationship their\nself-awareness and there's an investment\nin the growth of your partner that's a\nhealthy relationship and people they'll\nlook at their narcissistic relationships\nthat say I don't have any of those yeah\nokay but unfortunately culture will\noften dictate what makes things healthy\nand then they'll be like well they have\na good job\nthey make a lot of money we are of the\nsame religion I like how they look yeah\nthat stuff is I understand why someone\nwould value it it's not the stuff of a\nhealthy relationship yeah those are the\nthings we start convincing ourselves\nthrough and and coaching ourselves\nthrough walking ourselves through it\ngets harder and harder and harder\nbecause we get so addicted especially\ngoing back to where you sing about love\nbombing like being love bombed is really\naddictive and it's really intoxicating\nbecause it's like wow this person's\nreally into me and if I could count the\namount of friends I have this year that\nhave been love bomb like it's insane\nlike how common it is and it's at the\nshorter end too it's at that six weeks\nMark or you know three months Mark where\npeople are showing their their full self\nI guess is the right way of saying it\nhow do you stop yourself from being love\nbombed like how do you avoid being love\nbombed or how do you navigate being love\nbombed because I think that's the\nconversation like we're not going to be\nable to stop being love bombed but you\nare going to be able to slow things down\nyou argue to be able to rethink you are\ngoing to be able to but we just love\nbeing loved so much and you know it's\nkind of like the confidence boost we\nnever had and it's it's the influx of\npositive compliments we never had so how\ndo we slow what do we do it's a tough\none Jay you know I mean listen if you\nput like\na bunch of I don't know cupcakes or\nsweets\nstarting to eat it right knowing that oh\nokay Romney you don't need to you don't\nneed the sugar you know we're going to\nturn we then I'd say you don't need the\nsugar you don't that's not good for you\nthen that's easy I think easier when it\ncomes to food I think that what happens\nwith love bombing might actually be more\naddictive than drugs because it's often\naddressing\na deficit many people believe they've\nexperienced in their lives that they\nweren't seen they weren't recognized\nthey weren't valued a lot of people\ndidn't get that in in the early part of\ntheir lives so that someone's coming\nalong or in their dating life they\ndidn't get it with other people so when\nsomeone comes along and is offering it\nit almost feels like an offset to those\nother relationships where a person\ndidn't feel valued or seen or any of\nthat I think part a number one is that\nyou need to know what it is so when it's\nhappening you're more aware of it's like\nit again using a hurricane analogy it's\nlike preparing for it so if a person\nsays oh hurricane is just rain and wind\nI'm like um maybe not like let's get\nthose you know let's board up your\nwindows let's sand bag your house\nevacuate like it's not just a rainstorm\nso knowing what it is means you're going\nto prepare yourself in a different way\nthat's one thing\nthe second thing is love bombing becomes\na place for you to test the waters okay\nso I tell people pull back on that\nthrottle let's come down in altitude\nlet's fly This Plane a little slower now\nin most narcissistic relationships if a\nperson tries I'm not saying end it but\ntries to pull back like can we go a\nlittle slower or you know what we don't\nneed to go to that place let's just go\nto this simple restaurant or I don't\nknow about traveling yet like I'd like\nto get you know to know you better\nyou put those lines down and set those\nboundaries\nin the majority of cases the\nnarcissistic person is going to jump\nthey're going to do things like doubt\nyour commitment I guess you're not that\ninto me or oh yeah okay I get it you're\nnot you're not vibing because what\nyou've done is you've taken away their\ngame\nright now if they were really really a\ngood solid person who just happens to be\nsuper into dating you then they'd say oh\nyou know what I was I'm so interested in\nyou let me slow this let me slow my roll\nI think I let my enthusiasm and they'll\nbe I let my enthusiasm get the best of\nme they'll be self-aware of what they're\nthey're doing and might say you know I\nthink that I just you're really\nwonderful and but thank you and they'll\nreceive the feedback and say and say you\nknow what let's go to that Hole in the\nWall restaurant that sounds great and it\nwon't be an ego injury and they won't\nview it again because you're taking away\ntheir game that's that's the example of\ngaslighting which by the way today was\ndesignated as the word of the year what\nyes Merriam-Webster Dictionary called\ngaslighting the word of the year which\nto me let me tell you I literally\nstarted crying I thought after 15 years\nof talking about this stuff quietly I\ncannot believe that this is finally\nentering into the mainstream but people\nstill use the word wrong but the fact of\nthe matter is when when you simply say\nsomething like I'm really enjoying\ngetting to know you but can we just step\nit back a bit and a person says well I\nguess you're not that interested in me\nthen you're being gaslighted because\nthat's actually not your experience you\nactually are quite committed and want to\nslow it down to see what it's like but\nthat's a great way to test the waters\nthat would like that would be me saying\ncan you take all those cupcakes away I'm\nnot interested yeah and I'd still be\nlike really want one yeah you know so\nit's that exactly yeah let's now that\nyou've said that I didn't realize that's\nthat is incredible that it's the word of\nthe uh in the sense that at least we're\nunderstanding it it's sad that it's the\nword of the year because it means more\npeople are experiencing it it's like the\nyou know but but can you again properly\nclarify us what gaslighting is again so\nthat we don't misuse it and absolutely\nand when I saw that I'm like I'm going\nto bring this up with Drake yeah when it\ncame up as the word of the Year\nGaslight a lot of people are confused by\ngas exciting right now the origin of the\nword is actually is only in the last\nless than 100 years it was a name of a\nplay that became a film and you know it\nwas literally about the psychological\nmanipulation of a Woman by her husband\nand how she psychologically sort of\nfalls apart because that's happening\nfast forward the only people who talked\nabout gaslighting were therapists it was\nhis therapists talk and we talk about it\noh my God her husband's gaslighting him\nyou know kind of thing and my shrink\nwould say it to me right and I was like\noh you're being gaslighted so it was\nshrink talk nobody else talked about it\nand then those of us working in this\nspace it was you know like oh that's the\nprimary tool of the narcissistic person\nbecause it's a tool of domination so the\nway gaslighting works is it's a it's a\ndenial of a person's reality that's step\none I never said that that never\nhappened you're what are you saying like\nI don't even see what you're talking\nabout right so you're like I didn't or\nthis isn't happening so you now you're\nalready a little off balance because I'm\nit very authoritatively saying to you\nsomething didn't happen\nbut that's not that's that by itself is\nnot gaslighting oh okay no yeah you\ngotta go now the step two of gaslighting\nis\nthen I tell you there's something wrong\nwith you right you're so sensitive like\nwhy do you see this everywhere or like\noh God you know paranoia much I you know\nwhat I'm gonna get you the name of a\nshrink you need to talk to someone\nbecause you keep imagining things that\naren't happening okay\nso imagine a person in a relationship\nwhere there's infidelity and they're\ngetting suspicious their Partners ours\nwhatever it is messages and they say to\ntheir partner what is this thing at work\nyou keep staying and you know you're\ntraveling like is there anything going\non that I should know about no there's\nnothing going on\nokay step one we have not gaslighted yet\nthough yeah gaslighting is but you know\nwhat I'm sick of I'm sick of living with\nan unhinged paranoid lunatic that's what\nI'm tired of right there's The Gaslight\nnow there's a step three is that it's\nnot a one-off one time yes that's a\ngaslighting episode but the true\ngaslighting abuse happens over time over\nand over and over and it won't just be\nabout one issue I never said that what\nis wrong with you oh I'm getting so\ntired of your paranoia you're so\nsensitive and what happens then is that\nother person being told repeatedly by\nsomeone they do trust because\ngaslighting is predicated on trust it's\nharder for a stranger to Gaslight you\npartner family member health care\nprovider\num teacher people who have some power\nover someone politicians\nin Gaslight entire societies Gaslight\nright what everyone is coming in on one\nparty line and denying reality and then\ntelling the people who don't believe\nthat that there's something wrong with\nthem and do it over and over and over\nagain you break the other person's\nSpirit you leave them completely\ndoubting themselves completely blaming\nthemselves and so what happens is when a\nperson's chronically gaslighted you'll\nsee things like no no you know what this\nis my fault they start they start\napologizing before they get into I'm\nsorry I'm sorry and I'll be like what\nare you sorry for it's just they got so\nused to saying it so they're they're\nthey really get Shattered by this where\nthey literally lose a sense of up and\ndown night and day they're just it's a\ncon it's such a cruel thing to do to a\nperson it is qualifies as emotional\nabuse so this idea of gaslighting great\nthat it's in the public Consciousness\nbut it's not just lying everyone says Dr\nRomney what's the difference between\nlying and gaslighting lying is a denial\nof evidence right so today we had our\ntime to get together and make it up you\nsay okay you're gonna be here at two\no'clock and I'd say that's not true you\ntold me to get here at one o'clock it\nwas one o'clock one o'clock one o'clock\nI know it was one o'clock and I insist\non that then you'll be able to show me\nthe email and say Romney look it says\ntwo o'clock and then and then I and then\nI went with that right then we were just\nclose the LIE got lies get shut down by\nevidence\ngaslighting is a lie but wrapped up in\nthis invalidating bow and that I mean\nwhen I hear that breaks my heart because\nI know so many people have been on the\nend of that\nand you see how\nsomeone may even have started off with\nan anxious or avoidant attachment style\nand now that anxiety is through the roof\nor that self criticism is you know their\nself-doubt is is even greater now that\nperson can't trust again now the\nperson's struggling with\ntheir value and their worth and I know\nthis is a bigger question and I do want\nto get into it but that individual what\ncould they have done differently to\navoid going inward because I what I've\nfound is that\nwhen someone is potentially probably one\nof the other personality types it's\nnatural for them to think that there's\nsomething that they need to change\nthat's the natural default of the other\npersonality types it's like when\nsomething's not working out maybe I\nshould change because then it could be\nbetter right or take responsibility or\ntake responsibility exactly and so and I\nand I've seen that myself even when even\nwhen someone would say the meanest thing\nabout me even if I know it's not true to\nmy core there's a part of me that will\nstill reflect on it because I'm like\nwhat if maybe it's something I'm missing\nabout myself\nbut how do you avoid letting it affect\nyou or are you saying there is no way\nand it is going to affect you I think\nthat it's a mix of things and it's\ninteresting when you when people get\nSavvy about gaslighting and they know\nthey're being gaslighted in real time\nnow the one thing you can never ever\never do is tell a gaslighter that you\nknow that they're gaslighting you\nbecause then they're going to double\ndown yeah okay so when it's happening in\nreal time\nis and this is what's so hard because it\nbecomes sort of a cart before the horse\nthing most people haven't done the\ntherapeutic work of who am I what am I\nabout\nwhat is my identity\nhow do I stand as a person what do I\nbelieve in what do I care about right\nvery few people do that work\nbecause then when you do that again I\nget this I get this a lot in online\nspaces because people a lot of people\nout there who are very pro-narcissism\napparently and so when I come out but is\nthere a big organized Community Dr\nRomney is a terrible therapist and she's\nvery unempathic that was one of last\nweek's comments okay wow it has less\nimpact Jay because I don't know this\nthere's a stranger on the internet but I\nhave to catch myself because I know\nthere's parts of me that have that\nneurotic structure where I believe\nthat's plausible just because that's\njust sort of how it is that's what I\nmean right yeah the work then becomes\nI have to literally talking myself out\nloud like Romney you are empathic you're\nsolid you are a very good therapist\nyou've seen really meaningful change\nyour clients literally I'm saying this\nout loud however and this is the\ninteresting rub this hurts you even\nthough this is from a stranger to give\nyourself a second\nand that might be talk to someone I care\nabout who cares about me to see if they\ncan uplift me it might be do something\npleasurable it might be doing a brief\nworkout it might mean whatever it means\nyou know that there's a moment when I'm\nsaying I need to show some compassion to\nmyself right now because this person has\nhit me someplace that hurts becomes a\ndifferent Call to Arms at that point\nyeah does that make sense but the\ninitial work is who am I and what am I\nabout yeah you know and I think that\nthis is why journaling becomes so\nimportant because having these places\nyou've written things down where you can\nlook back and say I really I really have\ncomment things from the heart and sure\nI've made mistakes like everyone does\nbut listen this is a this is a\nhighfalutin this is me having been in\ntherapist therapy for 50 000 years you\nknow so that's also there's a place\nwhere that work's been done and having\ngone through a life and had to learn\nfrom all of that that was not something\nI was doing when I was 25 years old so a\ntherapist though could if a good\ntherapist would be a place where\nsomebody could say you're being\ngaslighted and I can't tell you how many\ntimes I've sat with a client and said it\nsounds like they're gaslighting you're\nthe client like what and then we'll walk\nthrough what is their reality who are\nthere and then when that session is done\nthey'll often say I feel like a big\nweight has been lifted off of me because\nI was literally doubting the very\nessence of who I am and this is where\ntherapy becomes so important because\nit's sort of bringing a person back to\ndoing that work of who they really are\nwhat they really stand for what they're\nabout so in real time it's really about\nlistening to it I have to be honest with\nyou when I within the presence of\nsomeone who is gaslighting me and\nthey're actually somebody\nwho I do value I tend to disengage a bit\nyou know I'll just sort of let you know\nI'll say you know I'll often give the\nokay we're just seeing it in different\nways and\num I'll sort of soften and I won't get\ninto it with them anymore I will I I\ndon't in fact one of my techniques I\ngive the clients I work with is don't go\ndeep don't defend don't engage don't\nexplain don't personalize so I'll\ndisengage a bit and realize okay this is\nno longer a safe space yeah and and that\nsort of feels self-protective and I\nthink that that's almost like retraining\nan inner critic to say can I also have\nan inner bodyguard so that I could just\nhave someone's like hey hun let's just\npull you back a little bit yeah yeah I\nit's so interesting I had an episode\nwith a coaching client because obviously\nthat that's my either episode with the\ncoaching client earlier this year and\nI have a similar approach where I'm like\nI know who I am I know what I care about\nI know with what intention I work\ntowards and ultimately if that's an\nopinion someone has of me they're\nentitled to that but but I'm not going\nto go deep with it because I know that's\njust not my truth and that's not where I\nam but like you're saying that takes a\nlot of self-work beforehand and like you\nsaid there's also still an openness to\nfeedback there's still an openness to\nbeing better it's not like you think\nyou're complete and you're perfect and\nyour intentions perfect either so I I\nreally like that you brought it back to\nthat because I I'm glad that we got back\nto that that at the end of the day it's\nabout who you are your intention the\nessence of who you're trying to be and\nthat's ultimately all you have to go\nback to before and after but it's hard\nbut it's hard yeah it's really really\nand for people who've been through\nlifelong narcissistic abuse long-term\nnarcissistic abuse in a relationship\nthey'll be like I have no idea who I am\nso so I do say that honestly and the\nfilm The Original film Gaslight portrays\nthis as part of the storyline ultimately\nultimately she got ungaslighted if you\nwill because of just one person it only\ntakes one person and I always tell\neveryone you can be the person who turns\nThe Gaslight off for someone else you\nmay witness some something and say\nthat's you know you might be at a\nmeeting and someone might say that's not\nwhat they said and so now you're\nungaslighting them in real time it might\nbe you do it after the meeting if that's\nsafer thumb it'll tell you what's\nhappening in their relationship and you\ndon't doubt them say oh come on it\ncouldn't have been that bad you don't\nsay that you're like I am so sorry this\nis happening to you this sounds\nabsolutely terrible are you okay because\nwhat you've done is you've given\npermission to this person who's just\ntold you they're going through something\nterrible minimizing it oh in many ways\nis a gaslighted approach right oh it's\nnot that bad because of our discomfort\nwith some someone else's discomfort we\ncan hold this space for other people and\nsort of turn that Gaslight off for\nothers and you'd be amazed at how\nquickly that can turn the ship around\nyeah well what what are some of the\nrealistic expectations for someone who\nsays I think I can change them I think I\ncan be the person that helps this\nnarcissistic person evolve grow change\nwhatever word they use like what have\nbeen realistic storylines as to how\nthose\nepisodes and scenarios go they don't I\nam in in my book don't you know who I am\nthere is a letter in that book\nand I had been speaking in some public\nforum this woman heard me and in\nsomebody was asking me a question in\nthis form and she was in a relatively\nnew new marriage they've been together a\ncouple years married all the\nnarcissistic top notes were there in her\npartner\nand she was asking the question I don't\nknow can I stick this out for another 10\nyears I'm just trying to figure this out\nand then this woman just did it herself\nshe had she's one of the people who\ndecided to stay the next 10 years and\nshe beautifully lays out honey this is\nwhat's going to happen if you stay for\nanother 10 years just basically 10 more\nyears of gaslighting 10 more years of\nbroken heart I've worked with clients\nJay who weren't ready to go and so they\nsay they'd sometimes even drop out of\ntherapy and a few times I've had those\nclients call me back three five seven\neight years later\nsometimes tearful\nand say nothing changed\nand there's no sense of Triumph in me\nfor that I recognize that they needed to\nsee it the way they needed to see it I\ndon't get to dictate their Rock Bottom I\ndon't get to dictate when someone sees\nsomething I do all the psycho-education\nstuff I do online education to see if I\nmight be able to push the fast forward\nbutton on that but it's still where you\nget there when you get there but\nlike there has been I can say it\nprobably counts 10 instances of people\n10 of the thousands I've heard that\nwhere people have said\nyou know this person actually when I\nsaid I'm done I'm over it I'm in fact\nrecently this came up in one of the\nseminars in my healing program and this\nperson said I'm done I'm out\num and she moved into her own place\nand her husband ended up going to 12\nstep he ended up going to therapy he had\nbecome more self-aware and she had found\nherself thriving living by herself but\nshe did love him and he said I want you\nto move back in and she said you know\nwhat I'm still growing and finding\nmyself so the answer to that is no we\ncan continue having tentative\nconversations and he didn't rage at her\nthat was one of the more hopeful stories\nI've heard in the last few years uh and\nthat's like that's one in five years and\nso uh you know that in this case that\nthis person became more well regulated\nbut her telling me that 12-step helped\nled me to realize that perhaps addiction\nwas probably the more powerful piece of\nthat story we'll sometimes see sort of\ncompeting kinds of patterns but by and\nlarge I have not I mean it is the\nrealistic expectation though to your\npoint the reason that book is called\nshould I stay or should I go is about 50\nof people stay in these relations yeah\nthat's what they do yeah and the reasons\nvary from\nfinances to children to religion to\nculture to I still love this person too\nI'm afraid whatever their reasons are no\none not me not you not anyone gets to\njudge those reasons\nwhat I believe in as a therapist is to\nmeet them where they are at with that\nand say okay so that's I unders I hear\nyou I don't get to sit here and tell you\nyou don't love this person you love them\nyou love them I'm here to tell you this\nis what you can realistically expect if\nyou stay\nright and I I use this um sort of\nmetaphor of going into the Tiger's cage\nwhen I'm talking with survivors which is\nthere's a tiger there's a cage if it's\nreally a tiger and you go in that cage\nyou're gonna get torn apart if it's not\na Tiger It's a sweet little cat no you\nmight have a nice little experience\nbut maybe the only way you and I'm\ntelling you and even if I tell you it's\na tiger you may not believe me until you\nget in that cage\nso I know that sometimes my clients say\nI have to let them go and let them go\ninto the cage when they get torn apart\nmy job is to help bring them back\ntogether again and so going into the\nTiger's cage is something sometimes\npeople need to do is say I just need to\nbe sure that's what yeah yeah and I say\nI understand that's part of your journey\nand I'm gonna support you in that I'm\nhere I because I think some clients\nthink like well Dr Roman is going to be\noffended if I go you know and I'm like\nyou know as somebody who has gone back\nwho continues to maintain more than a\nfew narcissistic relationships in my\nlife four reasons of culture we're both\nSouth Asian we know there's a tremendous\npressure in South Asian Middle East are\nactually in many cultures to sustain\ncommitted relationships and family so I\ncan't roll into those cultures and say\nyeah you gotta go that's not an option\nbut saying to people that you are not\ngoing to get a depth of emotional need\nmet here you are going to be invalidated\nthe work has to be in you not believing\nwhat they're saying they are not going\nto grow empathy they're going to remain\nentitled you need to you need to develop\nother sources of support and that might\nbe through friends through family\nthrough spirituality however however you\nfind those spaces where you feel seen\nand heard like I said whether through\nother human beings\nthe universe God whatever that looks\nlike for you that's your work so when\nyou realize that maybe the normal depth\nof a relationship of a healthy\nrelationship is this you got this yeah\nand you're gonna have to be ready for\nthat roller coaster of the bad days the\ngood days and not personalize it but in\nthe long term jay staying in that toxic\nsetting is going to take a toll on those\npeople even with all the realistic\nexpectations it takes a toll on a person\nwell I think you've just hit something\nthat that's the real growth that whether\nyou decide to stay or you decide to go\nthe work of figuring out who you are and\nwhat's important to you what your\nself-worth is based on what your value\nis that's going to happen either way\nhopefully I hope what that's that's\ngoing to be a path that hopefully you'll\nhave to take either way and so whatever\nyou're going to do please take that path\nbecause that's a path that stays with\nyou forever but to take that path\nquietly so you don't get to so\nthe ultimate healing in the narcissistic\nrelationship\ncomes from a process called\nindividuation you become you out it's\nimagine like a tree some that's so\nshadowing that the plants under it can't\ngrow because they're blocked from the\nSun\nour goal is to get you out of the shadow\nof their branches to no longer have to\nserve as a in psychological servitude to\nthem that you get to individuate the\nproblem is they don't want to hear it or\nsee it sort of psychologically alive in\na narcissistic relationship you have to\nskirt a very challenging line of being\nauthentic in other spaces but not in\nthat relationship because that's really\nhard because your authenticity will be\nshaved away but if you make it a very\nconscious act that once again that inner\nbodyguard I am protecting myself right\nnow they don't get to see all of me\nbecause they are not able to hold me\nsafe and I deserve that so I'm going to\nput authentic me away for a minute and\nI'm just gonna show up not gonna be\ncruel not going to be unkind I'm going\nto show up and do what I got to do you\nknow whether that's just sort of keep\nthe trains running on time I work with\nclients honestly Jay coming up with a\nlist of neutral conversation topics the\nweather with someone who's said it\nbeautifully the other day they said\nsports news weather you know like that's\npretty much all you can talk about in\nthese relationships right and weather\ntends to be the safest can you believe\nthis rain it's really cloudy I wonder\nwhen it's gonna get warm again I mean is\nand people say but that's not a\nrelationship I said it never was yeah so\nyou learn that piece but you allow your\nauthenticity to bloom in safer\nsituations it's like a plant that can\nonly bloom in the night but not in the\nday right the flower is gorgeous at\nnight but there's reasons it can't be\nbloomed in the day you're still going to\nbloom but you become a much more\nintentional and mindful person in your\nlife that you really say yourself\nconsciously even like you might be\npulled in front of a friend's house and\nsay I can't bring all of me into this\nyou breathe in and you go and you show\nup as sort of part of yourself but not\nall of yourself and you know what you\nknow who the real loser in that is that\nfool of a person who doesn't get to\nparticipate in the full Glory the full\nauthentic Glory of who you are they lost\nnot you and you protected yourself\nand that that part requires the reason\nwhy I'm hearing from you why that path\nafter 10 years in the letter as you said\nis is even so tough is because being a\nless version of yourselves takes so much\nstrength and so much courage it's it's\nnot weakness it takes so much energy to\nbe a less version of yourself because\nsomeone doesn't allow you to be your\nfull self correct it's a restraint but\nit's not and I think for too many people\nin these relationships they're this\nattenuated less authentic version of\nthemselves they think that they're\nactually less than and I say you're not\nless than you are actually caring for\nyourself you're learning that you can't\nbring that in and I have to be frank\nwith you Jay when people really get this\nright they're like okay I'm not doing\nthis anymore because what they were\ndoing before was they really were acting\nin a way that they thought if I do it\nthis way they'll change if I do it that\nway I said change is off the table from\nhere on forward you're moving forward\nwith change off the table and I'll tell\nyou that pressed the accelerator for\nmany people saying even if they didn't\nleave entirely in Intimate Relationships\nthey often left but in family\nrelationships they'll say I think I'm\ngoing to take a pass on Thanksgiving\nthis year I think I'm going to not I'm\nonly gonna go for one day of the family\nwedding like they start setting some\nreal boundaries and they learn to\ntolerate other people saying well isn't\nshe uppity for not showing up like that\ntolerance of people engaging this sort\nof enabling discourse of oh you're not a\nteam player or now you're the one who's\ndifficult to recognize that when people\ntake these rather revolutionary steps of\ntaking care of themselves that again I\ndo believe that self-care and that\nrestraint in these kinds of toxic\nrelationships is literally an act of\nrebellion yeah and I love what the\nexample you gave that certain cultures\nwhether it's cultural societal Financial\npressures that stop us from walking away\nwhat are some of the healthier\nboundaries people can set up so one\nboundary is I'm gonna make time for\nmyself to bloom to be authentic in my\nown space I'm gonna find friends in\ncommunity that that I take strength from\nare there other healthy boundaries that\npeople can set if they are currently\nstaying in this situation based on\nfinancial societal or family\nexpectations or pressures not to engage\nin the same way I think a lot of people\nwould get sort of with the dog with a\nbone kind of a fight with them right\nit's just sort of letting it go people\nwill say I I don't want to relent I'm\nlike what then don't relent with people\nyou actually who are healthy and can go\nbe very sort of deep mindful circumspect\npeople don't get into that argument with\nthem unless you just want to get into an\nargument for the sake of getting into an\nargument something else that people need\nto be prepared with in these sort of\nnarcissistic relational situations is\nthat there's a lot of baiting if you're\nnot giving the arguments and being as\ngaslightable as you once were that's not\nvery satisfying for them so they're\ngoing to find a way to go for the\njugular to make you bleed and make you\nfight back and I say to people you've\ngot to know\nsort of your your true north as it were\nand you might not take 90 of arguments\nbut if they go after some of those\nthings you hold sacred it could be your\nchildren it could be a belief system you\nhave it could be\num people other people you care about\nwhatever it is if they go for that\nthen you're like you know what I'm I'm\ngoing in I'm a tiger's cage I'm going in\nI am going to I can't listen to this I\ncan't do this but recognize it's not\ngoing to change anything and it's a\nquestion of which depletion is worth\nworse at that point holding yourself\nsilent at such a point or actually\nhaving the argument and then I tell\npeople if you decide to go in and do\nthat you need to engage in some form of\njust coming back down whatever that\nlooks like for you after these kinds of\ninteractions because many many people\nwill say after they've had to spend time\nwith a very toxic difficult antagonistic\nnarcissistic call it what you will\nperson they'll feel really depleted and\nif you keep having those episodes of\ndepletion you're going to get sick yeah\nI've also found that I mean more from an\nexperienced point of view that\nthe more you're associating with that\nenergy the more likely you become or\nadopt certain behaviors too I don't know\nif you've seen that where certain people\nstart adopting similar patterns similar\nbehaviors in order to be able to fight\nback and defend themselves as a defense\nmechanism not saying that you become\nnarcissistic but that you also respond\nby gaslighting or trying to you know\nyou're using that person's game against\nthem because that's the only place to\nsurvive and you're doing it consciously\nbut eventually I mean it just becomes\nunconscious to some degree I don't know\nif you've seen it I've seen that I've\ndefinitely seen it where people will\nknow that you change you know that no I\nthink that people will say I don't know\nhow often you'd be willing to steal food\nbut you'd steal it if you were hungry\nyeah it doesn't make you a thief yes\nthat's right yeah yeah you know\nand that's the\num we would all do things we don't\nordinarily do to survive and I think\nthat some people until they understand\nthis personality style doesn't change\nthat you have to have these realistic\nexpectations all of of that until people\nget that they do keep sort of getting\ninto the tango with them which may mean\nyou know shifts in terms of frustration\ndysregulation\num their own empathy May Wane we know\nthat there's something called compassion\nfatigue compassion fatigue is very\ncontiguous to burnout and people in\nthese relationships will say my empathy\nhas gone to hell like people are telling\nme their problems I'm like I I don't\nhave it anymore and it's not that your\nempathy has gone away\nbut it's almost like it's been a one\nyou've just it's almost like a vessel\nwhere the compassion's only going out\nand very little is coming in yeah Dr\nRomney this has been incredible to talk\nto you and I just want to recommend the\nbooks because we only touch the tip of\nthe iceberg the book\num there's two books here that I highly\nrecommend one is called should I stay or\nshould I go\num you're gonna hear about chapters\nabout how did you get sucked in how do\nthey make you feel and of course\nanswering the question should I say or\nshould I go if you are a friend or in a\ntough position in this kind of a\nrelationship then this book's going to\nhelp you make that decision extremely\npractical applicable advice and the\nother book is called Don't You Know Who\nI Am how to stay sane in an era of\nnarcissism entitlement and incivility\num this book is also available right now\nand so I highly recommend both these\nbooks uh Dr Romney is there anything\nthat you didn't share that you really\nwant to share from your heart or\nsomething that's on your mind or\nsomething in the moment that you feel\ninspired or call upon to share with us\ntoday I think that for me it is the I'm\ntired of the loss of human potential I'm\nseeing in these relationships wow\nwhether it's a five-year relationship or\n60-year relationship and while it is\nvery hard for a person to actualize and\ngive light to their best self while\nthey're in these relationships it's not\nimpossible\nand I have worked with people who have\nbeen in Long long-term relationships\nlike this and yet I see this\ntheir empathy and compassion are deeply\nretained they still do laugh deeply and\nand they'll say you know and they'll say\nlisten we I can't in my in my world in\nmy life and my culture I can't end this\nbut that doesn't mean there's not joy in\nmy life and I think for me what I want\nto do is I think everyone's been\nmisplacing their hope in the\nnarcissistic relationship\nThe Hope needs to be in oneself\nand that the Hope has to be that there\nis this this tremendous untold story in\nyou and it is your story not the story\nof them in your life but you and yours\nand to give sort of flight to that\nNarrative of you that to me is that's\nthe work that's the healing and to let\nwhen people say do I does this ever\nfully go away and the answer is no it\ndoesn't it is something that's there and\nI'll say survivors have a unique beauty\nright it's roomy and it's the wound\nwhere the you know the wound is where\nthe light enters you and all of that\nthere we say the survivors can see each\nother in the room right they're the ones\nin the audience that are sort of like\nyou know with I'm finally being heard\nand seen kind of thing and they they've\nhad a different Journey it's I'm not\nsaying it's better or worse or more\nvirtuous but there is a there can be\nthis sort of depth you bring into your\nlife after having been through it it's a\nloss of Innocence yeah I have to say you\nwill you'll never sort of laugh and be\nin the same way but you may sort of when\nthe laughter comes it feels like a gift\nand I think that that many survivors say\nI'm I'm ruined not only not ruined\nthere's a depth to your to your inner\nbeauty that really comes out I'm not\nsaying anyone should seek it out by the\nway it will find you that's the problem\nwith narcissism in our culture and so\nlike I said this is being done through\nstorytelling in my podcast I try to\nteach about it but above all else to me\nthe work is helping people heal from\nthis because I don't believe anyone is\ndefined by this yeah no that's so\npowerful uh everyone's been listening\nand watching
