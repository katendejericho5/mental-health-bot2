    "transcript": "we are so attached to the idea of who we\nare you know whether it's designed by\nwhat our parents always said about us\nbut sometimes I find I I would get so\nattached to that that then I would be\nafraid to let go because I don't want to\nlose me I don't want to lose me and me I\nknow me if I want to lose me do I still\nlove me the best-selling author and host\nthe number one Health and Wellness\npodcast on purpose with Jay Shetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou that come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow now you know that one of\nmy favorite ways to learn is by learning\npeople's stories by diving into their\nhearts their minds their their souls if\nthey're willing to share that and try\nand understand what we can learn what we\ncan hear what we don't understand maybe\nthere's a part of their Journey that we\ndidn't know enough about and I found\nstories become a huge compass for me in\nmy life and that's why I try and share\nthose with you here and today's guest is\nsomeone that I've actually wanted to\ntalk to for a long long time I would say\nI've been probably trying to book this\npodcast for like two years in the making\nso I'm very very excited this evening\nand just so you know he's had a crazy\nbusy day it is officially 7 45 p.m on a\nMonday night when we're recording this\nin New York City I'm talking about the\none and only someone who needs no\nintroduction Trevor Noah Trevor thank\nyou so much for doing this thank you\nvery much I'm very grateful to have you\nin the in the seat finally it's good I'm\ngrateful to be talking to you in person\nmost of the time I see you I'm watching\na clip of yours online so this is nice\nno I really appreciate this and my\ninterview with you that we did when I\nwas out talking about calm was my\nfavorite interview from that whole\nexperience because I felt that the\nquestions you asked me were the most\nreflective they were pushing me they\nwere challenging me in a healthy way and\nI was just like oh well you know I want\nto sit down more and have more of those\nconversations with you so anyway but I\nwant to start with you but you know your\nbook born a crime is a brilliant\nbrilliant book and I don't want to go\nthrough the whole book I'd love for\npeople to read it if they haven't but I\nguess what I'm fascinated by is\nhuman experiences when we were children\nor early on in our lives that shaped us\ntoday and I know you've reflected on\nthat a lot but now when you reflect on\nit today\nwhat are some of the examples of human\nexperiences that you had that you think\nshaped who you are today what was one of\nthe earliest memories maybe my mom is a\nBible scholar\nand\nshe reads the Bible every day not all of\nit but she she moves through it every\nsingle day\nwhat I found fascinating is that she's\nbeen reading the same book\nfor decades now\nand every day\nshe'll send me\nan email or a message about a scripture\nand how it pertains to her life as she\nsees it now in this moment how it has\nbeen and how she thinks it will be and\nwhat I found particularly fascinating\nabout that is\nthe fact that it's the same book and yet\nit keeps meaning so many different\nthings to her the same story but it\nkeeps meaning too many different things\nand I sometimes think about my life in\nthat way is depending on where I am\ndepending on the moments depending on\nwhere I've been and where I'm going\nthe same experience reveals a different\npart of me the same experience reveals\nwhy I am who I am or why I'm doing what\nI'm doing or why I even have an idea of\nwho I am or why I am\nand so\nrecently maybe since you know you're\nasking me what is one of these things\nwhat is something\nI think back to how not having\nshaped how I see the world shaped how I\nmove in the world you know not having\nfood sometimes not having money\nsometimes not even having luxury items\nsometimes you know whether it be\nclothing or cause whatever it may be but\nbut recently I've found myself going man\nso much of how you define yourself\nis through the lens of having or not\nhaving\nparticularly\nbecause of how you grew up and so it's\nnot about having or not having now but\nit's in the small things you know it's\nlike how I order food or why I order the\nfood that I do in the way that I do is\npartially because of having or not\nhaving and so I would say that's maybe\none of the biggest experiences that I\nfind has um yeah has recently\nyou know just shining a light on on how\nI grew up yeah that's fascinating I I've\noften reflected on something similar and\nI've called it gifts or gaps\nthe having or not having interesting so\ncertain gifts that I had growing up I\ncould hand it to me by my parents or by\nmy family oh wow okay right and then one\nof the gaps well there were gaps like\nthere were things that you didn't have\nso whether that would be uh a present\nparent or a uh I didn't have the latest\nNike sneakers or Nike shoes as we would\ncall it in London yeah exactly like yeah\nyou sound like an idiot yeah exactly\nAdidas yes as I said Adidas no Adidas uh\nand and so those kind of gaps and\nobviously those are very crude examples\nbut and and do you find yourself editing\nthose now like do you find yourself\nsaying okay I didn't have this and\ntherefore I have this Behavior I did\nhave this and therefore I have this\nBehavior do you feel like your behavior\ntoday wants an upgrade because of your\nnew lifestyle or a downgrade or you kind\nof think no I'm happy living with the\nsame beliefs and values and systems that\nI had from back then all I'm constantly\ntrying to do is acknowledge them I try\nmy best to eliminate good or bad I\nreally do\nand the reason I do that is not because\nyou know I exist in a in a spiritual\nWorld although I think we all do but not\nbecause of that I think of it more\nbecause I realize\neverything and everyone is going to have\na good or bad you know so\nI have yet to meet a person who doesn't\nthink some parts of their childhood were\ntough yes\nbut now it's when we compare the\ntoughness that that people then say Oh\nactually I didn't have a tough you had a\ntough and and you know like people say\nto me oh man you grew up so poor in\nSouth Africa and you know growing up in\nthe township and whatever and I would\nsay to them I didn't feel like this\nbecause I would see for instance the\nslums in India I go like man yo that and\nand maybe I was lucky funny enough\nbecause in South Africa we had news that\nwas was Global and because it was\nit was so\num I think it was so broad I had an\nawareness so I didn't think what I was\nliving through was the worst possible\nthing yes but now relative to how many\nother people live they put me down at\nthe bottom of a list yes yes yes and\nyeah and so I I often don't think of it\nas good or bad I I just try and go oh\nthat happened that didn't happen because\nof that I adapted accordingly you know\nso you know there's there's a lot of\nrainfall so then this plant will start\ngrowing in that way there isn't as much\nrainfall the plant will grow another way\nis it good or is it bad that's\noftentimes something that's subjective\nbecause of who runs the world or who\ntells us how the world should be or\nisn't or you you get what I'm saying\nyeah no and and I love that you've\nsimplified it as awareness because that\nawareness or acknowledgment and try it\nof keeping it that way is often quite\nsacred to be able to say no I'm just\nobserving I'm just seeing yeah yeah it's\nhard and you reminded me I was I was\nnine years old when I first visited\nIndia I was born and raised in London\nbut my my mom I was actually was born\nand raised in Yemen and my father was\nborn and raised in India but my parents\nare in what part of India uh my father\nwas from Mangalore okay which is like\nSouthern India okay my mother is from\nGujarat which is Northern India right\nbut she was born and raised in Yemen so\nshe moved to London when she was 16. but\nwhen I went to India for the first time\nwhen I was nine years old I remember we\nwere in a car and we were not well off\nso we weren't staying in a fancy hotel\nor whatever but we had enough money to\nvisit which is significant for the air\nflight and I remember going in this car\nand you just bought this\nand I remember like stopping at a\ntraffic light and just looking out and I\nsaw these slums and I mean I'd never\nseen something like that in London and I\nsaw these little legs poking out of like\na barrel of a trash can\nand and I was just and the legs look\nlittle like of someone my age like\naround and then\nslowly I saw the whole her whole body\ncome out and it was this girl and she\ndidn't have any hands and she'd just\nbeen like trying to scrape the body and\nI remember being nine years old and she\nwas probably like maybe the same age\nmaybe a little less like and I remember\njust looking at her and feeling like\ntotally helpless because I was in the\ncar on the other side of the highway and\nI can't go and help her I want to but I\nalso don't know what help means as a\nnine-year-old\nand it was one of those experiences that\nyou know and then I went back I remember\nto my hotel and I remember hearing like\nsomeone was arguing about not enough\nmenu options on the buffet and it was\njust it was as a night it was like\nconnecting the dots as you're saying of\nlike you know when you see your\nexperience and then you see someone\nelse's experience\nhave you found that what you did go\nthrough that you ever needed to process\nit or heal it or because you had that\nperspective since day one that that you\nnever needed that that it was just like\nno this is my experience and I'm used to\nit or whatever were there moments of\nwhere you had to revisit and I work on\nhealing every day you know I\ngrew up in a world where we almost\ndidn't have the time nor the resources\nto heal and I think for a long time I\nwas very comfortable in accepting that\nas just being my world all that happened\nall right you know I shrug it off and\nyou keep on moving wow yeah you\nshruggled off that happen that happened\nto you you know domestic abuse okay\npoverty whatever it may be violence in\nthe community or at home whatever yeah\nthat happens you keep it moving you\nshrug it off because it is happening and\nfunny enough\nyou can grow up and I knew I grew up in\na world where I created this narrative\nin my head\nthat it was not bad because it was\nhappening to everyone\nwow and so yeah\nnow most of my life you know is spent\nacknowledging that it was bad and then\nspending a lot of time acknowledging how\nthe bad\ncreated coping mechanisms or tools that\nI then use in my life every single day\nand how I can accept those parts of\nmyself\nwhilst also not glorifying the things\nthat happened which is sometimes I I\nfight with a lot of people when they do\nthis I I fight with all my friends by\nthe way\nI have friends from back home anyone\nyeah anyone from Friends With Friends\nback I fight with anyone Jay anyone I'm\nnever grateful for suffering I'm never\ngrateful for pain I'm never I'm not\ngrateful for those things what I work to\nbe grateful for is the resiliency that\nmakes us in my family and our ability to\nadapt but I'm not going to be grateful\nfor a horrible thing that happened to me\nor the people in my life yes because we\nlearned how to deal with it yeah you\nknow I would like to live in a world\nwhere my child doesn't have to develop\nthat tool\nyeah let them let their tool be I had to\nfigure out uh you know how to feel good\nabout myself when I couldn't get as many\nTick Tock followers as I wanted let that\nfine let that be their too but I I I I I\nand I understand the you know the\nesoteric idea I understand what people\nare saying sometimes but I I'm I'm\nalmost allergic to it because I think\nsometimes what it does is it justifies\nwhat people are going through or it\njustifies the idea that we we don't need\nto do more or people aren't going\nthrough something bad because it creates\nthe best it makes diamonds it makes it\ncan create diamonds and I'm like yeah\nbut what it can also do is pulverize a\nlot of people into dust yeah you know\nand so diamonds are the exception I I'm\noften careful to think about you know\nyeah I'm sure I'm sure you understand\nwhat I mean yeah I mean hearing you\nactually what I find is that it at least\nwhat I took away from that is that it's\nthe same thought it's just a deeper\nlevel of the same thought like it's with\nmore clarity like it's like I think\nsometimes we hear that idea of be\ngrateful for everything or be grateful\nfor the suffering and if you don't\nreally think that through you can try\nand artificially put that Band-Aid maybe\nthat's yeah yeah and you just kind of\ntry and like oh yeah put the Band-Aid on\nand put the Band-Aid on a gratitude\ngratitude but it's like when you\ninternalize then you process it that's\nwhen you can what you're doing which is\nlike clearly sectioning it off and\nsaying I'm not grateful for the act of\nviolence or I'm not grateful for the\nsuffering as you said but I can be\ngrateful for the quality that\nresilience Etc that helped me push\nthrough but I think that's to me that's\njust a deeper more refined thought out\nof practicing gratitude almost do you\nthink like I've always I've always\nwanted to know as a like you know as a\nmonk are you forced to just be grateful\nfor everything regardless of of what it\nis no I I think what you're saying is\nfar more aligned with what I would think\nlike okay as in I think that there's two\nparts right one is what the philosophy\ntries to share or state and then it's\nwhat you learn in the practice of that\nphilosophy so if you try and be grateful\nlike I just had uh this this literally\njust happened hence I'm talking about it\nI just had a double inguinal hernia\nsurgery uh which means that both my\nhernias which are on either side of my\ngroin had to have incisions in my\nstomach and then mesh pretty yeah it's\nnot life-threatening but it's massively\ninconvenient and I was I didn't work for\nthree weeks this is my first week back\nat work and I'm feeling the funniest is\nwhen you you try and um you you have\nlike a sneeze or a cough the first time\nhave you had this yeah\nit happens\nand the first time you don't realize how\npainful it would be and now your body\ndoesn't allow you to cough or sneeze or\nbut it's amazing it's almost funny to\nwhat we're talking about this is what I\nmean right it is amazing\nhow quickly your body responds to trauma\nor pain yes it's amazing at how quickly\nit works to protect you from it because\nif I said to you don't sneeze or don't\ncough for three weeks it's impossible\nyeah\nbut one cough and one sneeze when you've\nhad your hernia or any surgery that's\nabdominal your body goes I never want to\nexperience that again never and then you\ndon't you know exactly I know exactly\nwhat you mean for the first I was scared\nthat I was going to pop my head here yes\nyes exactly it's the fear yeah there you\ngo yeah and so I'm walking around with a\npillow like halfway through the day my\nwife's like what are you doing I'm like\nI might cough and she's laughing at me\nI'm like you can't make me laugh either\nlike I was like I couldn't watch Comedy\nfor three weeks yeah because you can't\nlaugh it hurts so much but the reason I\nbrought that up was like am I grateful I\ngot a hernia no like why would I be\ngrateful that I've been working out I\neat healthy I'm like you know I'm very\nI'm a mindful individual but I ended up\nwith this from whatever from working out\neverything I'm not grateful for the\nhernia but I'm grateful for the journey\nI chose to take during the experience\nthat is help me have new appreciations\nand so I I think the point of at least I\nmean going to what you suggested like\nhow would a monk think about gratitude\ndude I don't think any quality or value\nwas embodied by force or by prescription\nwithout okay reflection okay if that\nmakes sense yeah that does make sense\nanything without reflection is\npractically okay yeah not the right way\nright but it makes sense no I I like\nthat I really do fight with a lot of\npeople about this and no and I you know\nI obviously when I say fights I mean\nthat's how we use it in South Africa\nfunny enough in India as well I'm sure\nyou know this yeah when I was in India I\nwent recently and what I loved is how\npeople argue about everything and like\none of the guys who was there's a friend\nof mine now and you know we're arguing\nback and forth we're arguing and then\nlike his friend steps in and he's like\nTrevor he's like I'm so sorry Trevor\nplease whip I apologize you know he's\nnot fighting with you that's how we do\nit in India and I'm like oh I was like\nthis is it I get it I want to live in\nthis country yeah yeah let's let's get\ninto it but this is what I I argue with\npeople about sometimes where I say yeah\nI don't have to be grateful for it yes\nbecause I often say and maybe I'm Maybe\nI'm Wrong here so I see it I have found\nfor myself and maybe for others at times\nwe are so attached to the idea of who we\nare the story that we've told ourselves\nthe story that we continue to tell\nourselves who we are who we wish to be\nwho we should be\nyou know whether it's designed by what\nour parents always said about us you're\nsuch a quiet child you're such a lovely\nperson you're so kind you're so polite\nand you go that I am I should be then I\nyou know whatever it may be\nbut sometimes I find I I would get so\nattached to that that then I would be\nafraid to let go of the things that may\nbe holding me back because I don't want\nto lose me because who is me if I don't\nhave the pain who is me if I don't have\nthe trauma who is me if I don't have the\nthe mistrust I don't want to lose me I'm\nme I know me what if I'm not me I love\nme and if I want to lose me do I still\nlove me and it that's what I find that\nyeah so what I found helps me you know\nand I'll say to some of my friends as I\ngo I do not need to live my life\nbelieving that\nI would not be me or I do not love me if\nI wish for these things to not happen\nbut I rather go I would have learned\nsomething else so\nI learned a different part of my body I\nlearned how to work through pain I\nlearned how to move differently because\nof a hernia fine yeah I'm grateful that\nI can learn yeah I'm grateful that I can\nrecover I'm grateful that maybe I even\nlearned how to rest a little bit yes\ntake some time slow down yeah slow down\nJay\nbut\nI also sit with it and go\nbut if I didn't have that hernia if I\ndidn't have that trauma as a child I\nwould have had the opportunity to learn\nsomething else yes so maybe my tool\nwouldn't have been used on this it would\nhave been used on something else and\nthat doesn't diminish me or or who I\nthink I am it just allows me to almost\nexist\ninfinitely and go well then I can try to\nbe whatever me exists uh you know and\nyou it's like skin it's like hey it's\nlike we're always losing us is what I\nthink yeah yeah I mean the cells in our\nbodies are changing all the time yeah\nI'm always trying that and it's scary\nthat's yeah it's scary because I think\nhumans look for certainty as safety yeah\nand security and stability but I was\ngoing to ask you that like what you\nstarted to touch on there which which\nI'm which I love is like identity\nbelonging and these are things that you\ntalk about so much in your past as well\nand what you're basically saying is that\nwell if we're open to our identity\nchanging and we're open to our home\nchanging I mean do you still feel\nattached to a sense of home like what is\nhome to you today like how would you how\ndo you think about the word home\nfor me the true definition of the word\nhome is familiar of the family it's a\nrepeated interaction\nthat's all home is to me you know the\nreason you call it my home is because\nyou go back to it every single day if\nsomebody flipped all the furniture and\nthe house every day you find you\nwouldn't you'd say it doesn't feel like\nhome yeah but it is your home yes you\nknow I think it's your house yeah\nexactly yeah my friends are my home the\nlanguages you know I speak on my home\nthe food I eat in South Africa is my\nhome but my home starts to grow it\nstarts to change you know I I said this\nto a friend of mine when I got back from\nIndia I said man it felt like home\nand he was like what are you India I\nsaid it's crazy but it felt like home\nwow you know there were parts of Delhi\nwhere I was like this feels like home\nwow you know the parts of Bangalore\nBengaluru where it's like this feels\nlike home do you know what I mean it's\nlike yeah and people like what how can\nit feel like home it's like well maybe\nbecause part of it is reminiscent you\nknow it reminds me of South Africa we\nhave an Indian population it's huge one\nof the biggest in the world we we have\nIndian culture but also it's just it's\nit feels familiar it feels like home and\nso for me that's that's what home means\nis is a sense of the familiar you know\nyou can even experience randomly if you\ntravel a lot in a hotel that you always\nfrequent\nIt Feels Like Home yeah so that's what\nyou know that's what home means for me\nyeah it's that you know and you feel\nlike in New York too and you're here you\nfind that you have that because of that\nfamiliarity yeah you feel like I've\nalways see you and always it seems to me\nlike you're always home I don't know why\nthat's that's a nice thing for you to\nsay genuinely it always seems like I\nnever feel like you\nyou're uncomfortable I never feel like\nyou but I don't know if that's just what\nyou put out no I I I I would it's I was\ngoing to Define it now it's contextually\nsharing now but I my definition of home\nhave has always been where I feel I'm\nliving my purpose\noh so that's always been my purpose so\nand I genuinely feel like that where I\ncould wake up and be in another city or\nanother country or another seat\nand as long as this is my like I feel\nthis I'm doing my purpose tonight with\nyou and that's why I'm here help me\nunderstand so how would you because I I\ncan try to understand but what would you\nsay you feel your purpose is so my\npurpose is to help other people find\ntheir purpose okay and to me my purpose\nis to be a vessel of being able to\nexpose people to a number of different\nideas insights paths stories walks of\nlife so that they can find theirs I\ndon't think everyone's purpose looks\nlike mine I don't think everyone's path\nlooks like mine because I think one of\nthe best things I got when I was a kid\nand again it goes back to my childhood\nexperiences my dad was really worried\nthat I didn't read enough\nand I would never be interested in\nReading fiction books at school so we'd\nget the fiction books like Goosebumps\nand then later on Harry Potter and all\nthese books and I would never read them\nand I wouldn't have any interest in them\nso my dad was worried my mom were\nworried that this kid's not going to\nread and now I was about 13 Going on 14\nand I still wasn't reading a lot and so\nmy dad started giving me biographies and\nautobiographies and so I read like by\nthe time I was 16 I'd read Malcolm X uh\nMartin Luther King wow I was also\nreading like David Beckham and Dwayne\nJohnson because I was a massive soccer\nfootball fan and so I started just like\ncollecting all these stories and then as\nI told you when I sat on your show like\nI met a monk when I was 18 and that was\nthe story that my purpose felt connected\nto got it and so now I feel I'm like\nwell someone's going to listen to\nTrevor's story and feel far more\nconnected interesting and that may spark\nthis kid out there to say hey maybe\nthat's the kind of Direction I want to\ngo in I feel like today we're we're\nexposed to this same people online and\non TV and streaming\nand we're also exposed to the same parts\nof them that's true and my hope is that\nthis podcast even if you're seeing\nsomeone who's famous and popular like\nyourself hopefully people get a deeper\ninsight into someone famous and popular\nor they get to meet someone random who's\nnot famous and popular but it's\ninteresting so anyway that's that's my\npurpose wow so I feel like if I'm doing\nthat in a city in a country I'm home and\nit's because uh one of the famous\nscholars in YouTube are your mother\nbeing a scriptural scholar and like such\nan Avid Reader I never met this scholar\nbut my monk teachers would often quote\nhim and he said that the only place\nhigher than like the spiritual realm uh\nand it would be poetry but also you know\nliteral as well that the only place\nhigher than being in heaven or the\nspiritual realm is a place you live your\npurpose and that idea always like\nconnected with me because then I was\nlike oh so I could be in the middle of\nchaos but still feel at home right and\nso it gives me a sense of comfort and\nyou know that's what keeps me going when\nthe day is tough when things are going\nwhatever they are it's it's something\nthat comforts me and it works for me\nthat's a really great purpose to have\nbecause I mean there's always people to\nhelp there are always Journeys waiting\nto be embarked upon that's yeah yeah and\nand there's no yeah and and it's and\nit's free but with you I see the one\nthing the thread that I've heard in you\nwhich I really appreciated is like\nliterally three times you've responded\nyou've said my friends my friends I was\ntalking to my friend like this person\ntalks a lot to their friends yeah which\nwhich is really beautiful because you're\nthinking wow that you're a busy person\nyou're back to back I mean I remember I\nwas in\nI think we were both speaking at the\nSharjah Book Festival you landed one\nnight I messaged you and I said Trevor\nlet's do breakfast you're like dude I\nleave I was gone I was there for eight\nhours you were there for like six or\nfour yeah and I was like I thought I was\nthere for not enough like I was there\nfor eight hours and you were like dude\nI'm literally leaving tonight\nand so you're a busy person but in this\nconversation so many times you said\nfriends friends friends friends like uh\nyeah like how hey who are the friends\nwhat are you talking to them about like\nwhat's your consistency I'm fascinated\nby that because so who are the friends\npredominantly my friends are from South\nAfrica\num friends I met doing different things\nall all organic meetings which um I'm a\nsucker for I'm terrible at making\nfriends partially because I I don't\ntrust people easily I exist in a world\nwhere I can be friendly with many people\nbut you know it takes me a while to\naccept that this person is actually a\npart of my life right and I think for a\nlong time it was because and still is\nsometimes because a I have an idea of\nputting something on that person where I\nmay need them means that they may\ndisappoint me and then on the other side\nof it them needing me means I could be\nin the position to disappoint them you\nknow and and and so\nas we learn people I find we learn what\nthey can and cannot do we learn who they\nare or not and it's always situational\nfor me you know that's that's when I'll\ncall you like a friend\nis that I know how you are in most\nsituations yeah it's a good definition\nyou know that that for me is the\ndefinition of a friend so you know I can\nbe we use it Loosely obviously but you\nknow I can be friends with you and we\nalways meet for lunch and always me for\nbut but then I only know you in in one\nway my friends I start to be able\nto\nI almost almost store in a vault in my\nmind I can say for a fact if we're\nfriends if Jay was here this would\nbother him he would like that he would\nprobably say this and that's why he\nwould act this way yeah and that's you\nknow that's that's how I think of my\nfriends yeah so they've been a a major\npart of making me feel at home you know\nmy my job stand-up comedy is a really\nlonely career you know and I remember\ntalking to a comedian it was a few weeks\nago and talking about how there was like\na period where a lot of stand-up\ncomedians were committing suicide you\nknow and would be you'd hear this\ndevastating story of a comedian that\neveryone loved they were in a hotel room\nand then they committed suicide and I\nwas petrified\nbecause I I always think it can happen\nto me you know I I go that if that\nhappened to them why did it happen if I\ndon't understand then\nwhat is it another comedian another\ncomedian another comedian another\ncomedian I think being a stand-up\ncomedian is a really lonely job in that\nwe're traveling oftentimes alone we\ndon't have a band we don't have backup\ndancers we don't we don't we don't\ntravel can you imagine\nand yet every night you're going out\nthere and you're making people laugh\nyou're having fun with them they come\nwith their families they come with their\nfriends they come with their loved ones\nyou leave alone\nand and it's this constant exchange of\nenergy and what I learned was my my\nfriends became that Hub my friends\nbecame my recharge my friends became the\ncouch I could lie on and say nothing or\neverything yeah and\nthanks partly to technology I've been\nable to keep in touch with them there's\nno there's no catching up for us\nit's literally a running we've got a\nWhatsApp thread that is now I'm gonna\nsay\n15 years old yeah like literally I can\ngo back and search something from maybe\n10 years ago sometimes I can go back on\nthe WhatsApp there and go what happened\nand I can search and I can find it\nthat's how long we've had the same group\nand the same friends and the same\neverything and obviously it's grown over\ntime\nbut that core has kept me you know I\nalways think did you end up reading\nHarry Potter I didn't ever read it I've\nwatched all the movies yeah oh you\nwatched it okay yeah it was still moves\nI know I'm a big fan actually okay okay\nso I feel like your friends in life\nare your horcruxes oh interesting okay\nyou know yeah I think as people what we\ndo is we break ourselves into pots\nand whenever we meet people we give them\na part of ourselves\nand some people we give more than we\ngive others but we give everyone a\ndifferent part of ourselves no one in\nyour life has the same path that another\nperson has they may seem similar but\nthey're not your mother and father hold\ndifferent parts of you your uncles your\ncousins your brothers sisters your\nfriends whoever it is it will hold the\ndifferent parts of you and the same way\nVoldemort could use that to come back to\nlife I feel like we can use that wow to\ncome back to life Wow you know what I\nmean yeah you watched a different movie\nyeah and so I always think that as I I\nman sometimes I can be at my worst I can\nbe sometimes I can be lost yeah really\nJay there'll be times when I'll be like\nwhat am I doing or where am I I'm\nstressed I'm tired I'm burnt out I I\nfeel lost and I can call a friend and no\njoke they can say to me\nwell the Trevor I know\nyou know and I love that they say that\nthey don't say this is who you are or\nnot they go the Trevor I know found his\nJoy here yeah hey you know I've noticed\nthat you're always happiest when you do\nit this way yeah hey I've noticed that\nyou know you stress more when you're in\nthis position hey can I go\nman I I didn't know that about myself\nwell I didn't hold myself that way\nbecause I'm always experiencing All of\nMe still Through My Lens\nbut thank you you freed me you\nencouraged me you held me\num you loved me\nand what what then happens is I start to\nfind what I need to get back to my\npurpose to my passion to whatever drives\nme and and that's why my friends are big\nparts of that that is that is the core\nof my world yeah you know and and it's\nfunny my mom even used to say that to me\nwhen I was growing up you know it's at a\ncertain age she said to me she'd say to\nme my friend you know I want to be like\nI'm not your friend you're my mom and my\nmom would say just because I'm your mom\ndoesn't mean I'm your friend she said\nthere are many mothers out there that\naren't friends with their child yeah and\nshe said I'm your mother and I will\nalways love you as your mother but\nyou are becoming my friend wow\nand that stuck with me I realized that\nfriendship is a choice every other\nrelation we have isn't\nand so even your your relatives\ncan become your friends or may not be\nyour friends and I think understanding\nthat illuminates a lot of how you\ninteract with people in the world yeah I\nI really resonate with what I mean\neverything you said but one of the\nthings that stood out was that kind of\nperformance loneliness\num\nmy work mainly starts with coaching and\nworking with people and I and I work\nwith a lot of musicians and people who\ntour and travel not comedians but but\nartists and you know they're performing\nto like 100 000 people like 80 000\npeople and then they would always talk\nto me about this and I didn't I didn't\nreally have a\nempathetic experience of it I I could\nunderstand it theoretically yeah and\nthen because most of the events I used\nto speak out were like corporate events\nor like a business event or things like\nthat and then a few years ago when I did\nmy first ever event with my audience and\nit was in LA people who came because\nthey followed my work not because of\nanything else it was only about 2 000\npeople in the audience and I finished\nthe event\nand I got into the car\nand it hit me and I was like oh like\nthis is chemical this is definitely a\nchemical because you've just had yeah\nthousands of people shouting your name\nand like loving everything you say and\nall this validation and everything else\nas what you were saying when you were\ncoming like the dopamine the everything\nyes and then all of a sudden I was like\nwell wait a minute this feels weird like\nwhy do I feel like you know a sense of\nloneliness and it was really interesting\nbecause I felt like that pretty much the\nwhole and I felt like calling someone\nyes and I couldn't because in London it\nwas too early none of my friends would\nbe awake and so they're eight hours\nahead because I'm in LA and I'm going\nI'll go wait another hour for my friend\nto wake up two hours I'm not gonna wake\nhim up in the middle of the night so I'm\nwaiting there and then all my friends in\nLa were just at the event so I just saw\nthem and so they were probably like\ngoing home and it was a week night and\nso maybe the end I'm like I don't wanna\nand then I get home\nand my wife had organized this surprise\nparty for me with all my best friends my\nclosest friends in L.A wow and it was\nlike a relief it wasn't even a\ncelebration I was like there's a sense\nof relief I was like oh thank God\nbecause I don't know what I don't know\nwhat I would have done tonight man like\nyou know I understand why people turn to\ndrugs I understand why people tend to I\nI understood like it was the first time\nI was like because you yeah yeah you\nneed to numb it yeah you need to numb it\nbecause you just don't know what to do\nwith that feeling and that was the first\ntime I'd felt that way and I can't\nimagine as you're saying for someone\nwho's on tour and traveling every night\nam I drunk as I said you my drug was\nchocolate oh I love chocolate too that\nwas like my I couldn't it's like my team\nknew my people knew it's like I'll do\nthe show and immediately and you\nprobably relate to this more because you\nknow coming from the UK in America they\ndon't really do it in South Africa our\npetrol stations our gas stations right\nthey have amazing stores attached to\nthem like here every gas station looks\nlike it's already been robbed you don't\nwant to pour gas I don't like it it\nlooks terrible they all look abandoned\nyes yeah yeah they all look like a ghost\ntown yeah yeah where's where we're from\nit's like oh you go and you buy a pie\nyou buy some you buy a few drinks it's\nlike cooked exactly it's like oh this is\nlive you can get some groceries although\nit's a very normal concept and that\nwould be me after every show I would\ndrive there would be the silence I\ncouldn't listen to music I couldn't my\nmind would just be it's like I could\nhear everybody but they were gone\nand then I would go in and then I would\nbuy chocolate would be my thing it it\nimmediately and then I I you know over\nthe years I would read and I'd started\nlearning that like you know chocolate\nthe dopamine the sugar all of these\nthings I was I was correcting a chemical\nthing without realizing it correct\nbecause it is a it is a shock on your\nbody yeah everyone nothing yeah it's\nit's so fascinating that that experience\nand and I'm sure people have that in\ndifferent ways in their life like you\ndon't have to be a performer for\nthousands of people experience that I\nthink people experience that in lots of\ndifferent ways it's beautiful that\nyou've been able to\ncontinue this 10 year WhatsApp chat like\nthat's you know that's like a brilliant\nachievement how did you do in such a way\nthat when you became unrelatable to\npeople like how is that affected your\nfriendships your life your relationships\nbecause at one point I'm guessing you\nknow when when you come to America you\ncrush on The Daily Show things are going\ngreat you know times 100 most\ninfluential people like crushing took\nsome time but yeah okay no no of course\nno no no no it took it I mean it took it\nit was like it actually goes into your\nout it goes into your questions\nand I just think that there's an\ninteresting thing about being so\ngrounded and like I've I'm enjoying this\nconversation it's fun we're like just\nhaving a real conversation but at the\nsame time to a lot of people externally\nyou can start becoming more unrelatable\nso what's interesting is the reason I\nthe reason I put it in the reason I say\nthe crushing wasn't instant\num when you're on a journey people\noftentimes will remember the beginning\nof the journey\nand\nthey will Define the journey by the way\nit currently is or how it ended you know\nyou lived a good life because of how\nyour life ended if somebody is you know\nreally poor for 80 years then they win\nthe lottery at 80 and then they buy\ntheir family stuff and they have a good\npeople like man it was tough buddy we\nhad a good life yeah I was like wow did\nthey though yeah did they though it's\nmore like oh we remember we that that\nending is is what we often remember and\nto your point of of relatable\nmy journey was really interesting\nparticularly in America because for many\nmonths maybe even a year and a bit I was\nhated you know by many people don't get\nme wrong there are many people who love\nme but it was such a visceral\nunderstandable visceral response to me\nas a concept who are you how dare you\nyou're on the show right away you know\nand you're trying to establish imagine\ntrying to meet people for the first time\nbut they have an idea of you and they've\nalready decided what the interview is oh\ngosh yeah and so you you you can't even\nrelate or make yourself relatable to\nthem and then overnight all of a sudden\npeople go are you crushing it\nit's a it's a really weird space to be\nin because it's\nit's terrible and then it's not but your\nbrain doesn't shift that quickly I\nremember learning once\nthat the human brain\nand and the human body\naren't necessarily always on the same\npage if you're running from danger if\nthere's if there's a threat and you run\nfrom the danger even when the danger\nsubsides your body's still in the danger\nand yeah I think I think they talk about\nsomething similar in the book the body\nkeeps the score but yeah great book\nyour body's still there and your mind\ngoes huh all right oh okay I'm done your\nbody's like whoa heart pumping you know\nveins throbbing everything is still\nhappening\nand and you know that was part of my\nexperience but what was interesting was\nto your points of relatable I didn't\neven have a moment to exist in relatable\nit was stranger\nyou know don't like different weird why\ndo you say words the way you do you know\nwhat is aluminum all these things coming\ntogether and then oh yeah our guy you\nknow which I'm grateful for\neternally grateful for I always tell my\nmy people everyone I go yo do not forget\ndo not forget how hard this was do not\nforget you do not take it for granted\nbut what happens is\nit's not that you don't become relatable\nor you aren't relatable it's it's it's\nhow people relate to you they have one\nidea of of who you are they have one\nidea of of how you are and it's\nunderstandable because of how they\ninteract with you you know I I have two\nyounger brothers\nboth in my opinion\nfar wiser than I'll ever be I always I\nalways\nyou know I'll cuss them out and say you\nguys you guys cheated because you you\nlike took what I did and then you just\nlike you leapfrogged me yeah you know\nand and my youngest brother said one of\nthe most beautiful things one day we\nwere trying to have dinner as a family\nand we're taking a quiet moment and you\nknow someone came over to the table and\nthey're like hey can I get a selfie and\nthis is happening in the dinner and you\nknow and and someone who was with us\nsaid oh man that must get annoying and I\nwas like well I get it and I said I just\ndon't understand\nthe familiarity and the I I don't\nunderstand it truly and my brother said\none of the most interesting things he\nsaid no what you're not understanding is\na disconnect in your relationship in the\nrelatability he said\nyou've met them and they've talked to\nyou and you've had a conversation with\nthem and so they've built up a\nrelationship with you but they don't\nunderstand that you haven't been\nbuilding up the same relationship with\nthem and so they he said they're\nreacting to you as naturally as they\nwould had you been\nconversating with them constantly yeah\nand so he said if anything they're\nacting normally you're acting weird\nbecause they go hey Trevor and you're\nlike who the hell are you and they're\nlike what do you mean we've been friends\nfor seven years I watch you on TV every\nday yeah and just through that lens he\nhelped me understand that\nit's it's that they were misrelating yes\nand that's sometimes what happens to us\nI think as people is we're misrelating\nyes we have an idea of the thing\nthat isn't incorrect from our point of\nview yes but is incorrect from the other\nperson's points of view and so that's\nwhat creates the conflict wow that's\nwhat creates the the disconnect and\nthat's what creates the loneliness\nthat's what creates the isolation that's\nwhat creates the you know yeah it it\ncreates an environment that doesn't lend\nitself to familiarity to trust to\nrelaxation I think that's where it\nbecomes even more important yeah to find\nyour grounding\nto find your space to find you like my\nfriends know me in the group I'm\nnotorious as the vacation guy I'm the\nholiday guy really I'm like where are we\ngoing what are we doing we're making\nthis happen I shoot out a list and\neverything because I don't live back\nhome yes they all do so I've learned\nthey can take for granted the fact that\nwe'll see each other and they might go\nlike oh did we plan anything for\nDecember oh we didn't oh well\nwe'll we'll do no I can't take that for\ngranted yes and so they know I go every\nyear I'm like guys what are we doing and\nwhat are we doing here three times a\nyear we have to be in the same place\nit's amazing and doesn't mean we're\ngoing somewhere fancy no we might just\nfind a place a house and we sit together\nand that's what it's going to be but I\nmake it happen because of that\nrelatability because that is where I can\nexist they can exist I can exist they\ncan exist you know because sometimes\nwhat's funny is it can go the other way\nfor me sometimes I will completely be\nmyself with people\nand they won't know what to do with it\nbecause they only have one idea of me\nyeah yeah you know yeah so they'll meet\nme and Trevor hey how are you hey hey\nbuddy cable if I say something back and\nthey go hey wait what was that I'm like\noh this is all of me yeah they don't\nhave a reference plan yeah and I get\nthat and so I yeah it's it's really\ninteresting when you exist in a\none-dimensional space in terms of you\nknow you know I guess it would be\nunidirectional just like you know it's\njust going in that one direction as\nopposed to it coming back and going you\nknow yeah definitely that's such a great\nanswer I'm one of those people that like\ngenerally if I get enough time to meet\nsomeone or if I know someone's going to\nbe in my life for an extended period of\ntime I I hire a new person on my team or\nsomething like that I try and show them\nall of me very quickly I'm not one of\nthose people they're like okay I'm gonna\nI'm gonna I'm gonna be as jokey as I\nusually am I'm gonna expose you to how I\ntalk to my wife like interesting and I\ndo that not as a no is it I definitely\ndo it as a conscious yeah it's not like\nit happens it's a conscious attempt at\ntrying to figure out whether this person\nactually wants to be around me like\ninteresting because I'd rather quickly\nfigure out whether I feel chemistry with\nsomeone yes as opposed to weight to\nreveal my full self for them to what you\nsaid to then let them down and then\nthey're like oh Georgie I didn't know\nyou were like this and so I I usually\nwarn people I'm like hey I make a lot\nmore jokes in person than I do on on\nInstagram and so if I'm like and I\nbanter a lot because of Britain yes of\ncourse right me and my wife will banter\na lot so most people think me and my\nwife are gonna get divorced every other\nday because it is like the way we talk\nto each other because we're both from\nEngland I I want people to be exposed to\nthat not because I I want them to\nappreciate you I like it I just want to\nknow quickly whether whether you vibrate\nokay but but aren't you ever concerned\ngoing the other way because you may go\nthis is me this is all of me yeah now\ndepending on your position in life the\nperson may\nbe a certain way to you sure based on\nthat sure because they feel they can't\nand then they reveal themselves then\nwhat do you do when they reveal\nthemselves in a positive or like a\nchallenge challenging way in a\nchallenging way then well that's where\nI'm saying that it's people that I I\nthink are gonna be in my life for a\nlonger period of time and then if it's a\nif it's a team member where we don't get\nalong then we can both move on and go\nour separate ways I wouldn't do it with\nsomeone that I I'm not getting enough\nquality time how does a monk fire\nsomeone how do the monk fires well I'm\nnot a monk anymore\nI'd love to know how does a monk fight\nlike you said oh God it is you know what\nthe thing about it is so uncomfortable\noh it is it is okay I thought maybe as a\nmonk it was like super chill and you\njust come in and you go in life\neverything is happening to you\nyou know everything that seems bad could\nbe good and so do not think of this as\nme letting you go but rather think of\nthis as me setting you free yeah I\nthought maybe it would be something\nsurrender then you have to end it no\nthat would be brilliant but so it is\nuncomfortable oh it's so uncut as in\nI've also been let go so I know what it\nfeels like like I've been in a position\nwhere I think I've been let go poorly\nwhere it hasn't been handled well and\nI'm very clear on how like having one\nskill set doesn't just naturally apply\nto everyone I being a monk doesn't make\nme go to recruiting people or letting go\nof people those are not transferable\nskills there's certain elements of\ncompassion and empathy okay but it\ndoesn't make you good enough that it\nwill cover everything and it doesn't it\ndoesn't right like I I think for to give\nyou a very practical example I felt for\na lot of a long time that\npeople needed love like I I felt for a\nlong time that I believe that if you\nlove people then they'll be happy and\nthey'll feel good about stuff and I used\nto believe that and after trying to\nexpress love to people even in the way\nthey wanted so not even unconsciously\nbut I would try and figure out how does\nthis person receive love okay let me\ngive them love in the way they want to\nreceive love\nI realized that so many people were not\neven operating on that level yeah that\nall they needed was safety damn like\nthey just needed a base level of safety\nthey weren't they couldn't even accept\nor receive love because that was such a\nlofty deep idea it's like they they\ndidn't understand how someone who\ndoesn't know them very well could\nexpress deep love for them because\nthey've never experienced that before\nhow do you find\nthe correct safety to convey and what I\nmean by that is we all have a different\nidea of what safety means you know going\nback to your idea of you know when\nyou're saying stability and stability\nearlier in the conversation one of the\nwildest discoveries I made in therapy\nwas where I was speaking to my therapist\nand I realized I am particularly\ncomfortable in chaos\num\nthat is where I'm most comfortable you\nknow if you're in an airport and you you\nknow flights are being canceled and you\nknow everything's being delayed you want\nme rolling with you like I'm that is me\nproblem I solve it I\ngenuinely I find\na beautiful hum of peace that comes over\nme yes when there is chaos traffic\neverything cars not that's where I'm\ncomfortable\nand yet the flip I also discovered was\ntrue is that when there's calm\nnow I'm in chaos wow you know and so I\nlearned that I felt safest\nwhere most people didn't yes and I felt\nat least safe\nwhere most people would yeah and I\nlearned a lot of that came because\ngrowing up in a home\nwhere there was domestic abuse\nyou you know this the silence meant you\ndidn't know anything could happen at any\nmoment what's going on what's Happening\ndon't know you don't know but when\nsomething is happening all you have to\ndo is deal with it yeah wow I mean that\ndo you get yeah I mean but that's like\nthat's such a challenging difficult idea\nright for people to grasp because what\nyou're saying is if I can hear gunshots\nat least I know well I know what\nshooting's coming from correct yeah yeah\nexactly so I know where to run away to\nfrom except you get what I'm saying yeah\nyeah no no I fully get what you're\nsaying but I'm just saying that that is\na challenging concept for people to get\naround because if you've not been\nbrought if you've not been raised in a\nspace like that like that's so much to\ndo with your upbringing yeah but that's\nwhat I mean by safety so that's why yeah\nyeah so how do you even find that\nbecause you know I understand what you\nmean by love because again how we\nprocess it what our languages are Etc or\nso specific but even safety you know my\nmy idea of safety isn't the same as your\nidea of course not yeah you know whether\nit'll be in a personal relationship in a\nromantic relationship you know some\npeople's idea of safety is hey you you\ntext me every day and you exactly you\ncall me to make sure I got home and you\nanother person's idea of safety is you\nleave me alone when I'm busy that makes\nme feel safe you take care of yourself\nit makes me feel safe you you know what\nI mean so how do you then find what the\nperson's idea of safety is yeah well I\nthink it's what you just said that\nthere's a hierarchy of needs right and\neveryone has their different like you\nsaid like the the base level and I'm\nlooking at The Vedas which is what I\nstudied as a monk and it says the base\nlevel of anyone's motivator is fear and\nanxiety right like people get motivated\nby fear and anxiety so the lack of fear\nand anxiety is a sense of safety okay\nright higher than that is someone who's\nmotivated by uh results or goals so they\nfeel safe when they're moving towards\nsomething they feel safe when they're\ndriving towards a deadline that is clear\nand active another level is trying\ntranquility and calm and it's like\nsomeone feels safe when they feel\nClarity okay right and so in similar\nwhat you're saying like there's some so\nI think what I realized though was that\nsafety was such a base need of humans\nright that until you fulfill that need\nit love just and this is just experience\nright I'm saying this from experience\nyeah I just felt like opening my heart\nto people or like trying to give love to\npeople in a very genuine way I just felt\nthat it it couldn't fully be received\nbecause I realized most people have\nprobably never received love even maybe\nfrom their parents or their family or\nfrom the people they expected to love\nthem so when someone unexpected comes\nalong and tries to show you love it's\nlike what is it what does he want or\nwhat is this going on no you know where\ndoes this land and so I was like all\nright like really back you know really\nback and just figure out Safety First\nanyway that was at least a personal\nexperience but but why did we get there\nwe got there because\nwe're talking about this idea with you\nof like you know we're talking about\nrelatability yeah and we're moving\nthrough to you know safety and love and\nthen meeting people and you're talking\nabout how you um will reveal all of\nyourself early on that so that the\nperson I guess is in the safest space\nreally yeah and and that's only My\nMethod I'm again I'm not saying that's\nright or wrong it's just kind of and\neven what you said earlier like you said\nlike Jay you always feel safe I think I\ndo I feel the opposite too I feel most\nunsafe when I think I'm somewhere and I\ndon't have a purpose there okay so if I\nget invited to a place where I don't\nfeel I have any purpose you will see me\njust like I will last like 30 minutes\nand then I will leave because I'm just\nlike what am I gonna do here I'm not\njust going to shoot the breeze so do you\npractice then not doing being in my\npurpose yeah yeah so when I'm in a space\nlike that I will I will look at I will\nbe there of course I can I can have\nconversations right twerk and everything\nelse you're not crying in a corner no no\nyeah what I'm saying but do you yeah do\nyou think I'm what I'm asking is do you\nhave to work on that yes absolutely yeah\nbecause it's discomfort yes it's a\ndiscomfort that I have to work on which\nis well I don't know why I'm here I\ndon't know what my purpose is and then\nthe and then sometimes my way of talking\nto myself is\nyou never know there may be something\nhere right uh and you have to be open\ntoday if I if I live if I sit here and\nI'm close to that then I may never\ndiscover anything if I'm open to it\nmaybe I'll discover something maybe I\nwon't how do you find the balance\nbetween\nknowing when to walk away and when the\nopportunity may present itself I feel\nlike that's the greatest challenge in\nlife because sometimes you you find\nyourself at an event whatever it may be\na work event a friend whatever it may be\nyou go oh man I'm not having fun here\nI'm not having a good time I'm not and\nthen as you say the one idea may be hey\nstay in this discomfort\nand what may come from it is something\nspecial which oftentimes can happen\nflip is true as well I stayed there for\ntoo long I stayed in that relationship\nfor too long I stayed at that job for\ntoo long I I stayed in that environment\nfor too long it was discomfort and I\nthought I was going to get something out\nof it I often hear people saying that\neven you know they'll you know friends\ncolleagues strangers sometimes I'll meet\nthey'll say\nyeah but I I've just I've been doing it\nfor so long now and I just feel like\nmaybe there's there's something and and\nyou know and then I I will say and I\ndon't know if even if if I'm right I go\nmaybe the lesson you're learning is when\nto walk away or how to walk up but I\ndon't even know this myself all right\nyou know you may leave the thing that\nthat's make me uncomfortable because of\nthat you have a serendipitous experience\ntotally and you go oh that's why I left\nbecause this was supposed to happen you\nwe always confirm we have another\nconfirmation bias absolutely or you stay\nand then something happens and you're\nlike ah I was always supposed to stay so\nhow do you how do you how do you know or\ndo you accept the fact that you don't\nknow I think that's I think you\nliterally just answer you're like\nwatching us on the whole journey all\nright yeah you don't yeah no no you're\nspot on you don't know like you don't\nknow right like and and you can only you\ncannot I think it's also a matter of\ntime right I think if I was and this is\nagain personal but there's a difference\nbetween like if we got here on this\nbeautiful setup that we have that you're\nadmiring and you're saying you like the\nenergy and how I do too if we got here\non Friday which was when we first\nstarted filming here if I didn't like it\non Friday if I didn't like the energy\nand I could tell the guests didn't like\nthe energy I would have shifted the room\nimmediately okay because I'm not going\nto wait around if I'm clear on something\nor I'm sensing it right I think jobs are\nharder because they provide survival\nexactly and so I think when things are\ntied to your survival we tend to spend\nlonger in them than we probably should\nyeah because that safety again and\nsecurity is so tight to that and I think\nthat's why relationships is you rightly\npointed out homes yes like I I was just\ntalking my my uncle and Aunt like uh you\nknow my grandparents have passed away\nthey've moved on and you know they've\nbeen wanting to move home they've said\nfor many many years but now they don't\nuh they live in London okay and they\nhave a house yeah and they want to they\nwant to move to a a different\nenvironment they've always wanted but\nnow they're like no no but all our\nmemories in this house right and so\nthere's that there's that familiarity\nand they're like no I don't want to\nleave even though I don't love this\nhouse as a structure and as a space I\ndon't want to leave and I think that's\nwhat we do with people yeah but but I\nguess that that's a good question for\nyou that you've you've obviously had to\nfind home again and again you've\ncontinued to find it in yourself like\nhow have you let go of previous\nidentities and personalities and are you\nbecause that's where we started like\nI think I've had to do that a lot of\ntimes like even when you said Monk and I\nalways say well I'm not anymore and the\nreason I say that is because I had to\nlet go of so many oh that's in parts of\nthat identity that don't serve me\nanymore there are lots of parts of the\nidentity that serve me massively there\nare lots of parts of the identity that\ndon't serve me anymore uh same with uh\nsame with anything like any work I've\ndone so I guess today when you're\ndeciding who you want to be\nuh one of the things I've taken away\nfrom this episode for sure and talking\nto you and I I genuinely enjoyed talking\nto you is we know you're a very smart\nintellectual thoughtful person about\nwhat's happening in the world but what I\nfind really beautiful and refreshing is\nthat today you're doing the same things\ninternally on your inner world has that\nalways been a habit you even said today\nwhen you walked in before we even\nstarted recording you were like chairman\nI've been on all day I need to just\nreflect and decompress and think about\nstuff\nhas that always been a habit is there a\nmethod you use is there a is there an\napproach or is it just something you\nnaturally just go into that inner World\nalthough I'm not particularly religious\nI would have to say growing up religious\ninstilled within me the idea that I\ncould have conversations with myself and\nthey were necessary\nin order for me to process\nwhat I was going through\nyou know that's that's what prayer is in\nmy opinion it's a conversation that you\nare having multiple times a day you are\nremembering you are thinking you are\ndiscussing you are exposing your\nvulnerabilities you are whatever it may\nbe\nyou are you're doing in in doing that as\na little child you know getting on my\nknees and praying one of my favorite\nlessons\nthat my mom taught me was\nthat your relationship with God is your\nrelationship with God you know she if I\nwas in trouble\nshe wouldn't say to me pray in front of\nme let me hear you pray no she'll be\nlike you go and go and pray and so what\nI am grateful for in that experience was\nthat my relationship with God was then\nalways my relationship with God it was\nmy conversation it wasn't performative\nit it wasn't I remember as a little kid\njust like asking random questions you\nknow I'd go to bed and I'd be like oh\ngod oh man why do I break things all the\ntime why I don't know what it is like\nI mean you were there with me I don't\nknow why why don't you stop me sometimes\nlike you know you never stop me and I'll\njust be there as a kid and I would I\ndon't want to break things but then I\nbroke it and I knew it was gonna break\nand now mom's angry and ah please try\nand make her not as angry and but I'd\nhave these conversations and I would\nfeel different afterwards I would feel\nbetter I would feel like I'd processed\nsomething\nand that is an element of prayer that I\nthink a lot of people take for granted\nis that processing of the information\nthat's oftentimes just running away in\nyour head like just really running away\nin your head in that I I just try and\nask questions I just tell people you\nknow I go like I don't know if I don't\nthink I'm smart I think I'm I think I\nI'm more and more confident in being an\nidiot to be honest with you\nyou know I\nI have friends who I consider smart\nbecause I can ask them about anything\nyou know I have friends who know about\nyou know quantum\ngravity and whatever it is of space\nbooks I always go like you're reading\nspace books again I have friends who\nknow about you know the the deepest\ntrenches of football history I know\nfriends who they they're smart in my\nopinion\nbut I'm proud to say I'm an idiot and so\nwhen you let go of that sometimes\nwhat I find is I I then enjoy asking\nquestions yeah yeah you know I\nin most of my work that's what I'm doing\nis I'm asking questions as a comedian\nI'm asking questions of how we live in\nsociety why do we accept certain things\nthe way we do and I think it's funny\nthat we do and have you ever noticed how\nand that's what a lot of comedians do\nthey're asking a question about\nsomething that everybody accepts as the\nnorm you know I do it in in my job on\nThe Daily Show I ask questions about how\npeople see politics and why they see\npolitics and you know whatever it may be\nI ask questions you know\nI remember one day someone said to me\nsome random person who said to me is\nlike oh it's crazy you know you came to\nthis country and you know as a Democrat\nyou probably I said oh wait what do you\nmean as a democrat in my country we\ndon't have that yeah\nand many political parties were not\nforced into a binary system that's\nalready you didn't ask a question you\nmade an assumption you know and so even\nthat has helped me where I come from\nthere is not just this or that yeah in\nAmerica it has like a very very\nplayer-hating vibe to it it's like look\nwhat that party's doing and look at that\nit's like yeah but what you know I mean\nif you voting for these things shouldn't\nyou be concerned about what you're going\nfor Wow Wow to your party yeah you know\nand so but as a comedian I'm going like\nwhere are the jokes I'll follow the\njokes I'll tell you that much because\nthat's what my purpose is in that moment\nyeah yeah\num and this goes to everything I do in\nlife you know I've been lucky enough to\nwork on different projects like yourself\nyou know I work in Tech I work with\nMicrosoft and things funny I remember\nthe president of the company one day he\nsaid he's like we're gonna call you the\nchief questions officer that's so good\nyeah because I've been lucky and you\nknow yeah I love Tech and a lot of tech\nis asking questions a lot of what I do\nin life is enjoying asking questions and\nbecoming less afraid of how stupid you\nmay seem or feel asking the question\nyeah that's oftentimes what I see with\nkids the reason they learn as quickly as\nthey do it's not just because of their\nbrains yeah but I feel like it's because\nthey they don't have an idea of who they\nare or aren't supposed to be and so they\nask questions and they ask questions and\nthey ask questions and they ask\nquestions and they ask questions and ask\nquestions and so what happens is\na they get answers but B they discover\nthat the people they're asking the\nquestions of sometimes don't even have\nthe answer they just assumed an idea or\nthe way you know the way the world was\nand I I often remind myself that if I if\nI become too tied to the idea of being\nsmart\nor being informed or knowing\nthen I'm trapped I I would rather say I\ntried to be smart I try to be informed\nbut if there's one thing I know I am\nwell it's an idiot and there's nothing\nwrong with that and I enjoy it you know\nbecause then I can be the smartest idiot\nyou've ever met and I can be the most\ninformed idiot you've ever met and I'm\nfine with that because I'm just trying\nto be the most natural me that's that's\na that's a good identity one thing I've\nnoticed about the way you ask questions\nin our interview when you interviewed me\nbut also today and something I\nappreciate and it was it's it's rare is\nI think most people when you were saying\nlike someone assumed you're a Democrat I\nthink most people ask questions in order\nto either agree or disagree with what\ncomes out the other person's mouth yeah\nbut we ask our best questions when we\nsimply ask to learn and infer and so now\nit's not asking to see whether we're on\nthe same page you're just asking to know\nbecause I think what we often do is we\nask a question and even if the base\nanswer kind of sounds similar oh we're\non the same page like oh me and you you\nknow we're like yeah we have the same\nvalues and it's like well no we don't we\njust haven't dug deep enough and I think\nwe're often not patient and I think\nthat's why in so many relationships in\nour lives and everywhere what you said\nyou said a friend is someone who I know\nhow they'd be in most situations yes and\nI think when you quickly go oh yeah yeah\nwe have the same values we have the same\nbelief system\nthat that's often incorrect because we\njust haven't asked enough questions to\ninfer because we really want to feel\ndoes that does that hit enough yeah no\nthat does actually I feel like that when\nyou ask questions and so I'm I'm\nthrowing that back at you saying when\nyou ask questions so going back to what\nwe're talking about about being an\noutsider being an Insider where do I\nfind a home where do I find familiar\nfamiliarity\nyou are familiar with this to a certain\ndegree because of moving out of the UK\ngoing to India you know going on that\njourney and then moving from there and\nthen coming to America it's another\none one thing that happens to you when\nyou leave home\nis that you have to then either find\nhome or you have to understand why this\nis home or you have to become\ncomfortable in a new space so that it\nwill be your new your new home\nand the best way to do that is by\nunderstanding is what I find oftentimes\nyou aren't forced to understand if you\nare in the majority if if the norm is\nyour world you're fine yeah if everyone\nhas your accent well then you don't need\nto understand another accent yes\nif everybody is your skin color you\ndon't need to understand another skin\ncolor everybody's your culture if\neverybody is your language if\neverybody's your you know socioeconomic\nclass whatever it may be um\nthen you don't need to understand\nand so\nwhat I've grown up with because I grew\nup with a black woman pasta woman being\nmy mother\nwhite man Swiss man being my father\nfamily mixed country broken up separated\nbecause of class because of race\npredominantly\nI I found myself often having to\nunderstand whatever it was language\nculture music food idea I have to\nunderstand\nand what I found\nis that is often the fastest path to\nhome\nis just understanding\nyou know a hammock is a terrible bed\nunless you understand how to sleep in\nthis\nand I think the same goes for everyone\nand everything\na foreign country doesn't feel like home\nuntil you understand the language and\nthen all of a sudden things start to\nwork yeah you know so when I ask a\nquestion of you as Jay I genuinely do it\nto understand you know because\nif you know with you I agree and I'm\ngenuinely trying to understand more\nbecause yeah I know the things I may\ndisagree with funny enough more is like\nhow I'm living my life and I'm trying to\nunderstand more about like how you see\nand then how do I you know it's not to\nagree or disagree but mostly like I need\nto understand this yeah and then\nsometimes it'll be with people who I\ndon't agree with them so I want to\nunderstand I see the world and it seems\nso clear to me can you explain why you\ndon't see what I'm seeing yeah you know\nthat's that's oftentimes what plagues me\nas as a person is I think we live in a\nworld now where there are fewer and\nfewer experiences that we all relate to\nor that we've all gone through and so\nwhile that's great for individualism and\nit's great for us you know living in our\nown Niche it has robbed us of a\ncollective understanding and so whether\nit's in politics or whether it's in\nsociety whatever it is you know I think\nit's healthy to disagree yeah you know\nJ.R I don't think that that's that I\nbut it's another thing to say you know\noh that's my parking no that's my\nparking versus that's my parking what\nparking wait you don't see a parking\nwell now we're in a bigger and that's\nwhy I feel like Society is moving\ntowards as as Everything Entertainment\nsocial media all these things become\nmore Niche I think we're losing that\nCollective space to be in and so because\nI've always been outside yes because\nI've never been part of\nI've always been forced to understand\nwhy do you do that why do you say that\nhow do you eat this you know so when I'm\nin India and I'm eating and I go can you\nhelp me help me understand why you used\nyour hand the way you do what are you\ntrying to okay great chopsticks for the\nfirst time I have all these things as\nopposed to assuming or even not being\nwilling to\nso maybe that's why I ask a question the\nway I do yeah is because I just don't\nunderstand why you see the world the way\nyou do and once I do I now get to hold\ntwo truths I get to see how you see the\nworld\nI get to know how I see the world and I\nmay augment my way of seeing it or I'll\nbe able to help you understand why I see\nit the way I do because I Now understand\nyours I don't think I can do that if I\nif I don't ask absolutely that that's\nexactly what I'm trying to say is that\nwhen I was saying learn that's what I\nmean understand like you're asking to\nlearn you're asking to understand you\nthere's not an asking to say yes we're\nthe same or no we're not the same and\nand I I read somewhere when when I was\nlooking at this interview about how you\nwere saying like because you've never\nfelt of something you've always felt\noutside you've always been able to see\nthe full picture and I was literally\njust saying this today that I grew up in\na home where my parents rarely agreed on\nanything and I was always the mediator\ninteresting and so I would sit and\nlisten to my mom and I would understand\nhow she felt and then I'd sit and listen\nto my dad and I always had an equal\nlevel of love and respect for them from\ntheir individual relationship with me\neven though Collective they didn't have\nit together and I found that when I read\nthat about you I I was wanting to ask\nyou about it because I was like that's\nwhere I I feel happier learning about\npeople and trying to understand people\nbecause I could see both my mom and dad\nwere right in so many ways like I would\nsit with my mom and be like how does Dad\nnot see that right and I would sit with\nDad and be like how does mom not see\nthat like how are we missing this part\nof the picture and I failed miserably at\ntrying to help the situation but I think\nthat's partly why I do what I do today\nbecause so much of me was exposed to\ndifferent opinions so I when I when I\nread that about you I was like\nI'd love to know how did you deal with\nthat feeling like how did you deal with\nthe idea and I know you're saying it\nflippantly in conversation but like how\ndid you deal with the pressure and the\nidea that you failed to reconcile what\nwas happening between the two of them I\nthink it took me years to accept that\nand to feel that way because I think\nwhen you're a kid it's what you said you\njust accept that this is normality so\nwhen I was a kid I didn't even think of\nit right so it's normal parents don't\nget along I want to help my mom out I'm\na good son I want to help my dad out you\nknow we're figuring it out and I'd\nprobably say I spent a good part of like\nat least my adult life so say from well\nmaybe not even adult maybe since I was\n10. maybe from 10 to 21 like probably 11\nyears trying to fix that and trying to\nthink I could fix that or that we could\nimprove it and while things got better\nsorry just disrupt yeah to your point\nbecause you were trying to create the\nsafety because as a child I feel like\nthere are a few things that make you\nfeel less safe than your two parental\nfigures you know sorry but carry on no\nno it's interesting no I'm just saying\ngoing back to the safety that you're\nsaying you're trying to make your world\nbecause love didn't work it didn't it\ndidn't matter how many Valentine's days\nthere were it didn't matter how many\nromantic gestures didn't have saying I\nlove you or a love letter but it was\nsafety yeah and so I was trying that\nprobably for a good 11 years and then I\nthink when I went off to the monastery\nit was still there in my heart and then\nI think while I was there I was like\nokay I have to let go of this because\nit's not my responsibility it's not my\nability I don't have the powers to fix\nthis and that's okay and that if I'm\nable to let go of this\nthen not only with things improve there\nI can help people who want to be helped\nas well and I think that was a whole\nlike probably like a 15-year journey to\nget to that because otherwise you hold\nit as your right like your like\nresponsibility like this is my job\nalmost yeah I think that's what many of\nus have done is\nwe have\nbeen burdened with\nand oftentimes subconsciously a job or a\nrole that our parents didn't realize\nthey were burdening us with well you\nknow oftentimes I I find it so\ninteresting how the loudest parents who\naren't good at reading a room will have\nthe the most shy child yes you know and\nand then the parents who aren't good at\nbeing outgoing and they'll have kids who\nare running and screaming and greeting\neverybody and talking to them because\nthere's this interesting thing that\nhappens in nature where I feel like you\nknow the child tries to correct for what\nthe parent may be lacking wow you know\nso true and and it's it's really\nfascinating that you say that yeah\nbecause what happens is over time\nyou get to an age where then you have to\ntake off you know that armor take off\nthat Cape take off that that designation\nthat designation yes and understand that\nnow you've lived that you've gained the\ntools from it it's become a lot of who\nyou are today\nbut you have to let it go and that that\nI find is terrifying\nbecause the only thing scarier than\naccepting\nWho We Are\nis accepting that we don't know who we\nare going to be when we let go of the\nthings that have made us who we are\ntoday yeah and that's that not knowing\nas simple as leaving a party early it's\nthat same feeling of discomfort of like\ndid I make the right choice if I stayed\nhere would it have if I kept that role\nwould it have and yeah I was talking to\na client the other day and\nshe said something really interesting\nshe was saying I just never grew up with\nan opinion she goes I've just never\nreally had an opinion\nand I've known her for some time so it\nwas a fairly uh it was a it was a\nprogressed conversation it wasn't the\nfirst time\nand and we were talking about that she\nwas saying well I've never really had an\nopinion on this or that and so when when\npeople ask me what I want to do or when\nmy partner asks me what I want to do I I\nkind of like go along with it but now\nI'm starting to question like am I\nliving my life or someone else's right\nand it was really interesting because we\nwe were really getting into it and\nI I started talking to her about her\nparents and family dynamic and she said\nsomething really phenomenal to me she\nsaid that\nmy brother and my dad always used to\nargue\nand I was The Peacemaker\nand she goes when I felt pain I never\nshared it because it would create more\ncomplexity right and so I accept that\nshe came to the conclusion that the\nreason I don't have an opinion is\nbecause it disturbs the peace and when I\ndon't have an opinion the piece is kept\nand I was you know those are the kind of\nthings that we're saying like we take\nthe designation of Peacemaker you take\nthe role in the designation of whatever\nI was yes sometimes the comedians take\non the role of being a comedian because\nyou you kind of get around to laugh and\neveryone you know and so I think these\nroles that you're talking about are\nreally it's a really beautiful way that\nyou said it that we we adopt this job\nand this role and this designation I\nthink I think we do and I often think\nsometimes it is necessary of course I\nthink it may be evolutionary I whatever\nit is I you know again that's why I\ndon't go to it's bad it's good I go it\nis it is it just is and and in\nunderstanding it's\nI realize there's nothing wrong with it\nbeing as long as you know when to let it\ngo you know I I often think of that\nabout seat belts when I'm in a car on a\nplane sometimes\nI forget that I'm wearing the seat belt\nI love wearing my seat belts especially\non a plane I buckled it long before they\ntell I'm like in strict I don't know\nwhat it is I love it the whole flight\neven when you see it go off you know\nwhen they'll turn sip up like on I'm\nlike what do you mean on the whole\nflight I will be wearing the seat belt\nthank you very much\nand what will happen sometimes I'm so\ncomfortable it's been the whole time\nwhen we land we chill I don't rush to\nget my bags any of that and then I'll\nStand and the seat belt will pull me and\nit's always like I laugh to myself it\nalways happens because it's because it's\nreally down and it just you know as I\njump I was like pulls me back down I\nalways Giggle and I I unbuckle it\nand I I found myself thinking the one\nday I was like it's amazing how this\nthis device is is brilliant it saves\nyour life you know in a car crash you\nknow you you know plane crash on a\nRunway or whatever I don't know how much\nit'll save you in a big one but still\nyou know but this thing is it holds you\nwow it's helping you stay intact it's\nhelping you stay in the place you need\nto be in but\nif you don't know how to let it go when\nyou need to now you're trapped yeah and\nand so that's what I'm constantly trying\nto work on which is so hard it's like\nman I go like okay all right my safe my\nsafety belt my seat belts all right it\nmight be my personality it might be the\nway I see the world it might be how I've\nlearned to interact with others it might\nbe anything how I eat how I think what I\ndo what I don't what I love what I will\nall these things and and I get that and\nI I'm always just trying to ask myself\nokay all right is this still your seat\nbelts or has it now become a trapping\nand I always just have to ask myself\nthat question it's extremely difficult\nit's been you know you just go round and\nround sometimes I do you know a lot of\nthe time I'll I'll be chill yeah\nsometimes I don't think I can watch\nHarry Potter the same again\nI don't think I could be on a plane the\nsame again like I I yeah I love how you\nthink I think it's so refreshing\nto hear that and I I the biggest thing\nI'm talking about this is just this\nability to really question our lives\nquestion things I think I think that is\nthe the purpose of life is is to start\nasking questions and what I loved about\nat least at least the scriptures I\nstudied on the Eastern side they're all\nq and A's like they're all cute question\nand answers really none of them are like\ntalking or lecturing or these are the\nVaders yeah yeah they're all q and A's\nand I think that was a big part of how\nwe were trained to believe that all\ninquiry was the birth of wisdom like it\nhad to be an inquiry it had to be a\nconversation it couldn't be a a lecture\nor a seminar and and you know I I think\nwhen I'd sit with you and whenever I've\nsat with you and whenever I've watched\nyou which I've admired you for so long I\nthink that the quality of questioning is\nreally what we should be more focused on\nthan than the result and the answers as\nyou were saying earlier that if we asked\nquestions we were actually interested in\nknowing the answer to we'd actually\nlisten yeah to the answer but Trevor we\nend the show with two segments these are\nfour segments okay uh you've been more\nthan generous with your time so the\nfirst segment is called uh the many\nsides to us okay and so this you have to\nanswer in one word okay and there's five\nquestions so are you ready I'm ready\nokay what is one word to describe what\nsomeone would say about you meeting you\nfor the first time\nfriendly friendly okay yeah friends and\nfriendly two different things but\nfriendly okay uh question number two\nwhat is one word to describe what\nsomeone would say about you that knows\nyou extremely well\nconsistent\nnice okay question number three uh what\nis one word you'd use to describe\nyourself Mercurial okay all right now\nI'm gonna have to ask you the expand\nlike that that I was not expecting that\none that is a very yeah tell me why that\nword like you can now go off one word\nlike I'm consistent\nin the fact that I'm also Mercurial part\nof it funny enough I I think was\nnot created by but as as somebody who\nhas ADHD it took me a long time to learn\nin life what that did to my brain how\nthat affected how I processed time and\nidea a thought a an object any any\ninquiry that I would have could be in\nsome way shape or form affected by that\nand I think funny enough there's a\nthere's a huge misunderstanding\nsometimes I actually you know hate how\nwe've created a lot of the conversations\naround the mind is the best way to put\nit you know because some of the some of\nthe terms have become so rote and some\nof the ideas have become so simple when\nthey're not\num I remember when I was young and I was\ndiagnosed with ADHD they made it seem\nlike you can't pay attention when in\nfact it's the fact that you can't choose\nwhat to pay your attention to very good\nat paying attention you know and so wow\nit's a very nuanced subtle yeah it makes\na big difference yeah it makes a big\ndifference even though it's a tiny thing\nyeah and so what what what's been\nwonderful for me in life is learning\nagain how to be grateful for how I've\ndealt with something\nnot even looking at it through the lens\nof good or bad but just going it is and\nthen understanding it like that you know\nand that's what I mean by I think we've\nreally hurt ourselves in society with\nhow we've had some conversations because\nwe've made it seem bad or good as\nopposed to understanding yeah because it\nmay not be the same as the norm you know\nso is a short person good or bad no\nthey're just short and the reason we say\nshort is because they're short relative\nto the general population the same way\nsomeone who's tall is tall relative to\nthe general population now if you're\ntall you may be bumping your head a lot\nmore than other people if you're short\nyou may not be reaching the things that\npeople have put at an average height I\nthink the same thing goes for the mind\nif you are blessed enough to have a mind\nor a mentality that is of the norm most\nthings will work for you and most things\nwill make sense in life\nif your mind isn't that's why they use\nDivergence it doesn't mean there's\nanything wrong but you you need to\nunderstand how your mind will react yeah\nto a world that has been designed in a\ncertain way\nand so that is why I've learned to\nunderstand and accept I go I'm Mercurial\nagain was a friend who taught me that\nand I loved it once I understood it\nfirst I was I was like no I'm not I'm\nnot he's like he's like yeah you're\nmaterial and I was like first of all\nexplain the words yeah and then explain\nit to me I was like I'm not that I'm the\nand then I realized I could I could be\ntwo things yeah I'm extremely consistent\nanyone who needs me knows me they know\nwhere to find me they know how I'll be\nbut I'm also Mercurial in that how I\nfeel about this on a day and how I feel\nabout that on a day may be more extreme\nthan somebody else's range and so in\nthat again just the understanding and\nasking the questions of myself I Then I\nthen exist in a space where I understand\nso it'll be funny is sometimes I'll meet\npeople and they'll get distracted and be\nlike oh sorry that's my ADHD and I'm\nlike let's not what it is but yeah right\nwhatever you know like people have done\nthis with everything oh I'm sorry I'm\nOCD it's like I don't okay yeah that's\nnot what it yeah and so we have these\nvery limited understandings of these\ncaricatures yes may be and we've also\ncreated an idea of them being a bad\ncorrect good whatever it's like no it's\njust understanding the same thing we did\nwith classes at some point nearsights at\nfarsighted I wear glass and now and then\nat some point it was just that's what it\nis yeah I think we have a long way to go\nin the conversations we have around the\nmind yes and it's getting us to the same\nplace where when you meet someone they\ncan say that to you and you now\nunderstand that oh I wear glasses okay\ngreat yes you know whereas I'm sure\nthere was a point where like I wear\nglasses so you're blind yeah now people\nare just like oh you do wear glasses or\nyou wake up you wear contacts okay cool\nthat's that's who you are yeah and I and\nI think that's what it is that our\nvocabulary around the mind and our\npsychology is very limited and your spot\non and one thing that you just said that\nreally struck a chord was the idea that\nif the world is designed for the average\nthen the challenge is that anyone\noutside of it feels broken and and\nthat's where I think we've gone wrong\nwhere it's like there's a weakness or a\nbroken yeah it's like no the world if\nthe world was designed for right those\npeople right then we'd feel broken and\nit's just that the world's been designed\nfor this few people if you created a new\nplanet that was for only people who had\na son uh disposition then it would be a\nvery different case yeah no I love that\nthat's a that's a great that's another\nwhole two-hour comment that's another\nwe'll come back yeah we'll save it all\nright question number four uh what is\none word uh that if someone didn't agree\nwith you or like you how would they what\nwould they say about you not like I'm\nnot talking about like an Internet troll\nor something stubborn right okay yeah\nthere you go that's a good way yeah yeah\nthat's good that makes sense I like that\nall right question number five what is a\nword that you're trying to embody right\nnow is there like a a focus a presence\nwith a particular characteristic or\nvalue or belief mindful great all right\nthere's a great there's a fantastic most\npeople struggle with this so you did you\nhit it out of the park all right these\nare the final five these are easy one\nword to one sentence what's the best\nadvice you've ever received never assume\nit's a great piece of advice second\nquestion what is the worst piece of\nadvice you've ever heard always be\nyourself\nthat's really it all right uh course\ntimes yeah to be don't just be yourself\npeople say though relax but you just be\nyourself yeah relax yeah yeah you know\nwhen to be yourself is a better piece of\nadvice someone can give you that's good\nuh question number three what is\nsomething you used to value that you no\nlonger value Fame so there was a time\nwhen it was important and yeah oh yeah I\nthink I\nI thought that it would give me\nsomething\nthat I searched for my whole life and\nthat was a certain sense of belonging\nyou know because there's a there's a\nfamiliarity you have with people when\nyou see them I never cared for through\nthe lens of like I'm better yes no but I\nwas like oh man everyone knows that\nperson Everyone likes that was and you\nknow here I was this kid and I grew up\nalone for so long I was like oh I I'll\nbe familiar and the word fame you know\nand you look at the root and I was like\noh that that thing I'll be familiar and\nthen ironically as I said it jumps\nstraight to your unfamiliar and so then\nI realized like oh man you don't think\nthat it will come from something but\nrather understand what you're trying to\nachieve and then you know figure out how\nyou're trying to get there that's\nbeautiful I love that uh question number\nfour how would you define your current\npurpose\nas being a fertilizer\nfour everything and everyone I come into\ncontact with\nI would hope to be\nsomebody who enriches the soil that I\ntouch I would hope to be somebody who\nimproves somebody's life in the\nslightest of ways whether it's helping\nyou solve a problem whether it's giving\nyou directions in the streets in New\nYork whether it's making you laugh at a\nshow you know talking about politics\nwhatever it may be I would hope to do\nwhat a good fertilizer does in that\nit enables the soil to be richer it\nenables the plant to grow taller it it\nbrings all of the pieces together you\nknow it becomes it becomes a food it\nbecomes it becomes a food that creates\nmore food you know it's not it's not a\nzero-sum game and so I would say that\nthat would probably be what I'd like to\nfocus on most right now even for myself\nbecause fertilizer even makes itself\nbigger yeah it grows itself yeah you add\nmore mulch to it and it keeps on going\nand so I think I think even for me yeah\num you know I I Look to try and\nfertilize as much as I can I love that\nthat's one of my favorite answers to\nthat question we've ever had all right\nuh Fifth and final question of the whole\ninterview if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be everyone in the world\nright I would create a law that said\neveryone everywhere in the world\nrandomly randomly randomly\ncould be\ngiven\nthe lowest person's bank account\nlike that it could be like that would be\nthe law is that we we do this with\nsystem where every whenever it may be\nevery year randomly the lowest person's\nbank account can just go out and become\neverybody's bank accounts wow the reason\nI would do that is because I think\nif we lived in a society\nwhere more people felt like their fate\nwas tied to the least of us\nthey would have a little more compassion\nand think a little more about how those\npeople may or may not be existing and\nthat's why I say I wouldn't say anyone\ncan't be rich I'm not saying that I\nwouldn't say anyone can't make as much\nmoney as they want oh no go ahead we\nshould all be doing that enjoy it go for\nit but I would just want us all to know\nthat the lowest bank balance the lowest\namount that someone has could randomly\ngot and it wouldn't be to everyone yeah\nit would be like 10 of the population\nthat's what's going to happen it's the\nlaw every year 10 of the population your\nbank balance becomes what the person\nwith the least amount has in that in\nthat in in the world I just wonder how\nwe would live yeah I genuinely would\nbecause\nyeah I I think sometimes\nand I understand it you know capitalism\nhyper capitalism you know this thing\nwe've been tricked into in believing\nthat in order for you to have I cannot\nhave as if trading didn't exist long\nbefore\nall of that has tricked us into a world\nof believing\nthat mine is only mine and yours cannot\ncome with it so I wonder what would\nhappen in that space I think even myself\neveryone would pay a lot more attention\nlike yo how much do you have yeah we\nneed to get your balance up yeah because\nI'm trying to keep my life as\ncomfortable as it is yeah and the\nfeeling of it could be any of us because\nit could be yeah that mindset people\ntake it for granted like it could it\ncould always be any of us 100 yeah luck\nis the most random and you can work as\nhard as you want luck is a huge Factor\nyou can be the best luck as a fact you\ncan be the worst luck is a factor so you\nknow it really could be any one of us\nand so I don't take for granted that I'm\nlucky I work hard I try and\nyou know I try and shape as much of the\nthe environment that my luck will exist\nwithin but I never take for granted that\nI'm lucky Trevor there's a new thing I\nlearned about you today that you don't\njust ask good questions but you really\nhonor answering questions and that's\njust I hate it when people don't by the\nway yeah oh you want to talk to one of\nmy pet peeves thank you thank
