    "transcript": "the key to finding someone is to write a\nlist of all the things that you want in\nthat person become the person of your\ndreams and you'll attract them you've\nbeen through some incredible\ntransformations and transitions in life\nstill doing it man every day every day i\ngotta grow and transition man but let's\ntake it right back to the beginning\nbecause i think that there was obviously\nwhen you took out the mask of\nmasculinity and you started talking more\nabout your childhood and experiences\nyou'd been through that it formed your\nlife today\nand you started to get this courage to\nbe able to share it which took so much\nvulnerability and humility and\nso much from you yeah tell us about how\nthat and coming to grips with that\nopened up more growth in your life well\ni think we all have some type of trauma\nthat we've dealt with whether it may be\nneglect or abandonment uh\nsexual abuse emotional trauma something\nwhere someone just said something to us\nthat we felt like we've held on to for\ndecades that we can't forget some kid a\nfriend a parent that said something to\nus\nand so i don't want to minimize or\nmaximize anyone's trauma because\neveryone has their own stuff they've\nbeen through\npersonally i grew up in a small town in\ndelaware ohio which is\nas middle america as it can get and\nmy third memory is being raped by a man\nso i have very few memories from my\nchildhood before five but when i was\nfive years old i was raped by a man he\nwas probably 16 or 17 year old\nguy who was the son of a babysitter that\ni would go to after kindergarten\nmy mom was working\nmy dad was working\ni was the youngest of four\nand so they were always working until\nlater at night\nso i would go to babysitters every day\nand\nthat was one of my first memories is\nthis experience\nexcept for 25 years i never told anyone\nbecause i was so ashamed that if people\nactually knew this about me they would\nnot love me they would not like me no\none would want to be my friends\nthey would look down on me all this\nstuff i would be less than a human if\nthey actually knew that i was sexually\nabused and i think that was a lot of the\nconditioning of just growing up\nin the 80s and 90s especially in ohio\nand i think in the midwest in general\nnot everyone had this but i think where\ni grew up i wasn't allowed to put my arm\naround a buddy of mine you know when we\nhang out it's like we hug each other i\npick you up with like we put around jump\non you i know you jump on me i'm like i\nloved it\nand but that wasn't acceptable as a kid\ngrowing up for me like i wanted to put\nmy arm around people and like hug my\nfriends but\nin school they would push me off and\ncall me names don't be a little girl\ndon't be gay don't be this don't be that\nlike it wasn't cool to be affectionate\neven in a non-sexual friendship way\nand so when i saw that i was i was eight\nnine ten eleven twelve that\nother boys didn't accept me for putting\nmy arm around them as a friend\ni was like if they actually knew about\nme what i've gone through\nthey would disown they would net reject\nme from society it was kind of the story\ni told myself\nand i also just didn't have examples of\ni was in sports and i never saw athletes\nopening up about sexual abuse i just\nnever ever saw it i never saw him\nopening up about mental health issues\nwhich was what was happening now more\ndoing that but as a kid i never saw that\nmodel so i just said okay i gotta act\nlike this didn't happen\ni gotta be as tough as i can so no one\ncan hurt me again i have to be as big\nand strong as possible\nto make sure that no one ever abuses me\nagain and that was kind of the\nstory of my life for 25 years my brother\nthen went to prison when i was eight\nuntil i was 12. he he got caught up in\nthe war on drugs in america in the in\nthe 90s for selling drugs to an\nundercover cop\nso in a small town\nthere wasn't a lot of people in the\nneighborhood whose kids went to prison\nthat i knew of he was the only one\nand on my block\neveryone knew\nthat my brother was in prison so that\nmeant the other parents wouldn't let\ntheir kids hang out with me for four and\na half years essentially\nso now i have this time where i'm not\nhanging out with people i'm essentially\ntrying i remember one time i\ni had to spend money to hang out with a\ncouple of kids who had a club in their\nbasement they had like this little\nprivate club\nand i had to either answer a couple of\nquestions that they asked me and if i\ngot it right i could be in the friend\nclub or i had to give them money and\nthey asked me a couple questions which i\nstill don't know the answers to today\nand i remember feeling like okay i'm so\ndumb\nthat because i'm not smart people don't\nwant to hang out with me and i went home\nand begged my mom for money she put it\nin a little shoe box all the change she\nhad to give them so i could hang out\nwith them i remember after that day\nspending that time with them i was like\ni felt really low i felt really sad and\ndepressed i was like man i'm just like a\nnothing like no one cares about me if i\nhave to pay money to have friends\nhow horrible of a human being am i i\nthink those moments like really shaped\nme and i said i'd rather be like\nisolated and alone then\nbeing around people that don't care if\ni'm like you know that i'm so dumb they\ndon't hang out with me or if i can't\nprovide them with money i was like i'd\nrather be alone so i spent a lot of time\nalone observing people\nand dealing with my own insecurities for\npretty much throughout my teens and i\nreally like look at my life in four\nphases like pre-teen\nteen to 22\nmy 20s and then 30 to now which was 37\nit's been kind of like four phases which\nhas been\nvery confusing up to the last seven\nyears\nand it wasn't until i finally opened up\nabout sexual trauma and sharing it out\nloud first with a small group of people\nthen with my family and friends then\nto my platform into the world\nit's still the most downloaded thing\ni've ever shared out on my podcast you\nknow it's\nit's still something i get every week\nfrom people where they're sharing in\nabout how they're opening up for the\nfirst time because i didn't have a model\ngrowing up\nand i felt like once i started to\nshare my shame about sexual trauma\nit no longer had power over me it took\nsome time to heal\nbut it no longer became a thing that\ncrippled me and made me insecure it's\nkind of like you know in eight mile when\nhe's like this happened to me and they\ncheated on my girl and this and i shot\nmyself and whatever it's like once i\nstarted to share a lot of\nvulnerable things that i didn't want\nanyone to know about me\nthen i learned who my real family who my\nreal friends were\nand i could start to fall in love with\nmyself more\nand i don't think i ever loved myself\nfully i love the mask that i wore i love\nlike that i'm a jock that i'm an athlete\nthat i'm successful in business but i\ndidn't love the inside\nand i think it's a hard life to live if\nwe don't learn how to love ourselves\nso that's in that's been the journey and\nyou know\ni was also in the special needs classes\ni almost flunked out of english senior\nyear so it's just a challenging i just\nnever remember really happy times\ngrowing up because i never learned how\nto love myself you have great videos\nthat say you know\nthey teach us how to memorize things in\nschool but they don't teach us how to\ndeal with failure\nthey don't teach us how to deal with a\nbroken heart you know those are the\nthings that i struggle with the most\nlike i was always failing in school i\nknow girls liked me you know i was\nalways heartbroken all this stuff and i\ndidn't know how to lose gracefully\nbecause my whole identity was tied\naround winning\nand gaining acceptance from people when\ni won in sports or when i broke a record\nit was like people acknowledged me and\nthey saw me for the first time because i\nhad a talent\nwhereas i never felt seen as a kid\nyou know my parents saw me and they were\nthere for me but i the story i said is\npeople don't care about me even when\nthey did\nand i think i just never learned the\nskill of loving myself\nuntil seven years ago really the process\nand if people could fully love\nthemselves\nand be proud of themselves there'd just\nbe a lot less mental and emotional\nsuffering so that's been kind of the\njourney\nin a nutshell\ni mean that's phenomenal man like it's\nyou know when when i know you as you now\nover the last three years you have one\nof the most kindest hearts i know you're\none of the most\nopen and loving people i know you're\nwithout a doubt one of the most generous\npeople i know\nand and to me it's like i can't ever\nimagine you not being those things yeah\nbecause\nyou do it so effortlessly in one sense\nit can appear that way so if i would\nhave met you 10 years ago i probably\nwon't even recognize it right it's like\nyeah you're a completely different\nperson but i didn't see that life i've\nseen only the last three years of you\nbeing like this incredible source of\nwisdom for the world that's gone viral\nand a great heart and a thoughtful mind\nbut i think\na lot of us go through these challenges\nyeah you know and we're we're in the\npublic so we're talking a lot about our\nour life\nand so it's it can be very scary if we\nhaven't accepted ourselves\nto then say this is who i am i know\nmichelle obama talked about mild\ndepression i think was a couple days ago\nor recently based on when this podcast\ncomes out where she's like i'm\nstruggling and she shared it publicly\nfor the first time which i think is\nreally courageous but when people are in\nthe public eye\nit's almost like we're forced to tear\ndown our masks and our walls\notherwise\nwe're being inauthentic to ourselves if\nwe're only putting out this perfect\nimage\nand for years i put out a perfect image\nor this ideal of like\nwho i wanted to be in the world\nand i was afraid of what if people\nreally saw who i was\nthey would never accept me kind of like\nwhen i was a kid if they truly knew what\nhappened\ni wouldn't have friends\nand again when i and i realized like at\n30 enough was enough i was dealing with\nso much inner suffering\non the outside everything looked great\nmaking great money sold a business for\nseven figures\nuh you know had girls that were\ninterested in me i had cool stuff i was\nplaying sports people were admiring what\ni was accomplishing on the outside\nbut i was\nnever proud of who i was on the inside\nand what i was afraid of i had such deep\ninsecurity\nthat if anyone knew who i was\nno one would ever love me\nand i think once i got to a place of\nfully accepting myself\nstarting a healing journey\nand sharing it with people and realizing\ni'm not dead like i'm not going to die\nhere and people still love me and people\nstill care about me even more they like\nme because i'm being more real it\ncreates a deeper connection and that's\nwhen i started to realize like oh\nthere's this thing called vulnerability\nthat is actually probably the biggest\nsuperpower in the world that most people\ndon't use\nand that's kind of all i've just done\nit's just been more and more open more\nand more real and it's still hard you\nknow it's like it's still hard to do\nsometimes but i feel like it's the only\nway\nand there are certain things i'm not\nsaying you should just publicly talk\nabout everything of your fears and your\ninsecurities i think it's a time and\nplace for everything i just felt like a\nresponsibility seven years ago to open\nup about these things because i didn't\nsee another model i didn't see another\nyou know jock white man opening up about\nstuff and now when i see guys like kevin\nlove talking about\nhaving mental breakdowns on the court\nand actually writing articles and\nspeaking being an advocate for this i'm\nlike great now there's more athletes\nthat look like him who might feel\ncomfortable opening up at 10 at 12 at\n14.\ni saw a young nba player\nforgetting his name recently like shaved\nhis head on instagram\nand said he's\ndoing this and he feels free because he\nwas sexually abused over and over as a\nkid i think he's a rookie nba basketball\nplayer and i'm like this is amazing that\nsomeone's posting this on instagram who\nhas a platform\nbecause he's starting to heal and maybe\nhe's he's a young black guy i'm like\nmaybe there's other young black men who\nwould never open up about this\nand now they have the permission\nto to share and i think that's\nincredible so i felt like a\nresponsibility\nto to start opening up publicly about\nthese things and i think you do such a\ngreat job on your videos of like\naddressing\nall these scary things that are hard for\nus depression mental illness\ncheating relationship breakups divorce\nlike all these things that people are\nscared\nto go through you're addressing and i\nthink that's what's helping heal the\nworld\nyeah man when you when i hear you say\nevery example that you're sharing right\nnow\nit's almost like you had to choose to do\nthe hardest thing\nthe scariest thing is\nlike\nthe way you know that whereas ryan\nholiday says the obstacle is the way\nlike your greatest fears is the way\nthis is something i've been doing as a\nkid\nsince my teens of realizing okay what\nare my fears\nbecause these are holding me back from\nbeing the greatest version myself so\nevery year i would create a list of my\nbiggest fears i remember when i was a\nteenager it was girls i think every\nteenage boy is afraid of talking to\ngirls getting rejected by girls like\nall that stuff is very scary and for me\ni remember i was like i don't have\nconfidence around girls i don't know\nwhat to say i'm a stutterer i don't have\nanything funny like i just stumble over\nmy words and i said to myself okay this\nsummer when i was 16 i said\nevery day when i see a girl that i'm\ninterested in or is attracted to i'm\ngoing to\nrun not in a creepy way up to them but\ni'm going to run towards them and start\na conversation when it gives me little\nbutterflies like i don't care if i'm at\nthe pool or the gym or the walking down\nthe street i have to go up to them it\nwas a challenge i love it for 90 days to\ndo this you should have videoed it i\nshould have i wish and for 90 days i did\nthis and i tell you what the first\ncouple weeks i was just humiliated it\nwas\nthe worst feeling in the world because\nyou're i faced my greatest fear\nrejection humiliation\nuh not being enough they don't like me\nwhatever it is\nand by the end of the summer i kid you\nnot i must have had i don't know 50\nphone numbers and just\nlots of fun you know i'm not acting on\nany of these things i'm just like having\nfun and overcoming a fear and i think if\nhuman beings were able to create more\ncontained challenges for themselves to\novercome their inner insecurities\nthat's the greatest game you can play\nlike i used to play a lot of physical\nsports but this is the greatest inner\nsport that you can play\nis writing a list of your biggest fears\nand then giving yourself parameters\nand a a time frame so i did this with\ngirls and i was like oh it worked i feel\nconfident i can say hi to people without\nbeing afraid\nthen when i was 23 i did it with public\nspeaking i could not stand up in front\nof three people and say anything without\nsweating without trembling it was that\ncrippling and i know public speaking is\na big fear for a lot of people\nand i met someone\nwho was a professional public speaker\nand i said tell me what i need to do to\novercome this fear\nhe said you need to join toastmasters\nyou need to go every single week until\nyou're not afraid so i gave myself a\nyear i said i'm going to do this every\nsingle week i would film my speeches it\nwas horrible\nbut i every week i would get better and\nat the end of the year i remember being\nable to speak in front of this group of\n15 20 people in the club\nand speak without notes you know\nremember my speech give it with poise\ngive it with everything i needed to do\nand\ni was like wow i'm not afraid anymore\nand i've done that with salsa dancing\nyou know for salsa dancing i spent 90\ndays\nall in on salsa dancing i was terrified\nthat i could not dance\nbut i did the same challenge for myself\nand i constantly do that you know i did\nthis with opening up about sexual abuse\ni was like i'm terrified for 25 years no\none's knows this except for me and i\nnever thought i would tell anyone\nbut i knew i was cheating myself by not\nat least processing the healing because\nit was something inside that was holding\nme back\nand every year i'm luckily i'm faced\nwith challenges every year that forced\nme to address my fears it forced me to\nlevel up to own my mistakes to\ntake accountability and responsibility\nand improve and i think that's a\nbeautiful thing of life is like i never\nwant to be not afraid of something\nbecause then i'm done so i always want\nto have something where i'm like right\nnow it's spanish\ni have been wanting to practice to learn\nspanish for 20 years now you have to now\ni've got a now i've got a mexican\ngirlfriend\nand even the first year of our\nrelationship i said okay i'm gonna do\nthis\nbut i put it off\nlike i keep making excuses\nbecause every time i jump into a new app\na new class whatever it is i get my\nbrain hurts so much from learning\nsomething that's challenging this is why\ni didn't do well in school because i was\njust like i can't do this i give up let\nme go play a sport\nand i was just like this is gonna suck\nfor a couple of years it's not going to\nbe easy but i'm going to be so much more\nproud of myself from accomplishing it in\na few years and what i'm going to learn\nabout myself in the process is going to\nbe greater than actually being fluent\nbut i just keep thinking back to like\nif i died today would i regret not going\nafter this fear\nbut i regret that i didn't share this\nwith my girlfriend\nmy husband my wife my kids that i didn't\ngo back to school that i didn't write\nthe book launch the podcast whatever it\nis would i regret it and for me i just\nnever want to regret so i'm like okay\ni've now found a process i've hired\nsomeone\nto do three days a week i'm fitting it\nin my calendar this is a priority every\nday and it sucks right now because i\nfeel like i'm not learning any\ni can't speak still but it's like it's\ngonna take years and i just need to\ntrust the process\nand\nappreciate all the little wins\nand they'll try to be fluent right away\njust be like okay i know a couple more\nwords today\nand that's what i think if people could\ndo that their life would be that much\nmore magical if you wrote down your\nbiggest fears\nand you started tackling them every year\nluis you're in flow man this is amazing\nstuff\nthis is amazing stuff like i want\neveryone who's listening and watching\nright now to do what lewis is saying\nright now i literally want you to get\nout a piece of pen and paper if you're\nnot then take a screenshot of where we\nare right now come back to this later on\nand do this because what he's saying is\nso powerful like literally it's so\nprofound like i love the fact that\nyou've just consistently challenged and\nchallenged and challenged absolutely and\nit just starts with writing down your\nfears and finding one thing you can do\nfor 30 days 60 days 90 days whatever it\nis for you and just doing that one thing\nevery day and it's doing it's acting\nit's not just thinking about it and so\nyour next book is going to be act like a\nmonk\nand it's going to be the actions you\nneed to take but yeah what would you say\nis your\nover the last three years yeah what were\nthe biggest fears you had\nthat you had to conquer or and what's\nthe biggest fear you have right now that\nyou haven't conquered yet i think that\nthe first thing that came to mind was\nafter my first video went viral yep\nso\nwe had a million views so yeah the first\none got a got a million views in like\nseven days the second one got like a\nmillimeters in 24 hours and then ended\nup getting like a total of 160 million\nviews across pages this is when the huff\npost was sharing it yeah it's 2017 2016\n2016 mid 2016.\nand my first fear became\ni don't want to make any more videos\nwhat because i was scared that they\nwouldn't do as well oh my gosh and this\nis the crazy thing of the fear of\nsee when you're starting your fear is a\nfailure\nand then when you kind of have a\nbreakthrough your fear becomes of\nsuccess it is i mean it's like who said\nthis uh\ni think liz gilbert says something like\nwell i'm never going to be as successful\nas my last book that sold like 10\nmillion copies of epray love and it's\nlike how do you live life knowing that\nyou may never hopefully you keep\ncreating stuff but but that didn't\nhappen with you you've been making\nvideos that have got 300 million views\nand beyond right yeah so that was the\nfirst fear i had to overcome was like\nthe the fear before that was well who's\ngoing to care so that was the biggest\nfear before starting but you talked a\nlot about that so yeah i see you at the\nopposite end of the fear of you've had\nyour little breakthrough you've got a\nlittle taste or a glimpse of\npeople now caring and now you're like\nwell what if they don't care the next\ntime so\ndid that\n you from wanting to create more\nor less or i made less i i think at that\ntime i was making one video per month\nbecause i was so scared when i met you\nat nasdaq were you still only doing one\na month at that time i had\njust started getting more\n100 weeks yeah probably yeah it wasn't\nwhen i met you and when i after that i\nwas like you need to be doing three a\nweek it's like you need to go hard like\nall in on this yeah because you were\nlike yeah maybe i'll start a podcast and\nwrite a book then i go\nwait and go all in on video right now\ntunnel vision on just how can i\nthis was your gift\ni think people get distracted too early\nwhere it's like okay this is my gift\nit's working and let me do this this and\nthis because it's cool but you went all\nin and you\nyou freaking crushed yeah so that was\nthat was one of the fears uh the other\nfear was you know when we were in new\nyork and we've talked about this before\nme and radi had moved there six months\nago yeah i decided that i had to venture\nout into creating my own thing\nand i was four months away from being\nbroke we had four months left to play\nrent and groceries that's it that's\nliterally what we had left and you were\nlike okay i'm gonna go leave huffpo or\nbe part-time and then go create more\nwhich takes money time and energy yeah\nand and i realized that i had to make\nthat journey to start building and\ncreating because i wanted to create\nstuff that i really wanted to create and\nput out\nbut at the same time that came with the\nrisk of hey we just got married a year\nago we moved here six months ago i know\nno one in new york no one really knows\nme\nand now i'm trying to create something\nfrom scratch in a city whereas full of\nunknowns right\nso that fear came out the only solution\nto that fear was literally i woke up the\nnext day\nand i emailed just like you did kind of\nwith the with the girls at that time but\ni emailed\nevery place\ncan you imagine i emailed every person\ni'd ever had any interaction with that\nmay need a video and i said i will edit\nyour videos i will shoot your videos i\nwill create videos for you and so i just\nstarted creating\nhustle scrappy mode literally just to\nsurvive yeah\njust to survive what happened when after\nlike a week of sending those out what\nhappened i was getting a few people\nemailing back and i realized that it was\nall a game of odds that i got back as\nmuch as i put in so if i sent 100 emails\ni got 10 responses if i sent a thousand\nemails i was getting 100 responses and i\nwas literally trying to find any way\nthrough to like seeing people who'd\nretweeted me on twitter and reaching out\nto them and smart like just anyway dm\nhey do you need some video work totally\nlike just looking at someone's job title\nand linkedin and going like who's this\nperson because i wanted to build\nsomething for myself but i wasn't sure\nthat people were going to allow me to\ncreate what i wanted to create straight\naway and also there wasn't like a\nmonetization plan three years ago on\nfacebook or i guess maybe youtube but it\nwasn't like a way to make money with\nyour content you were just i'm impacting\nthe world and\nthat's why maybe i'll do a book and this\nand that to make some money but you\ncouldn't monetize really then no and and\nit was monetization's never been my goal\nlike in the beginning the goal was\nsimply to make an impact and then i\nrealized that without money you can't\nscale the impact it's true and that was\nthe clear decision that i had to rewire\nmy relationship with money\ni had to rewind myself was not a big\nfear that was a big fear we've talked\nabout this a bunch before but why was\nmoney a big fear for you well i think i\ngrew up in a family where we always had\njust enough\nso the language of our money was we have\njust enough we have just enough we have\njust enough and almost there was not\nnecessarily through my parents but there\nwas a negative kind of narrative that i\ngrew up with that to be rich or wealthy\nyou had to backstab\nlie cheat steal or do something dodgy or\nnot be there for your family or you know\ncorrect sacrifice time totally like it\ncouldn't be done in a healthy way you\ncouldn't become wealthy in a healthy way\nright like that was kind of what was the\nswitch for you then when you realized oh\nno like money is a good thing to make\nmore of an impact and i actually need to\nfocus on this or add you know overcome\nthis fear well i think being in a place\nwhere you're four months away from being\nbroke you're like i didn't make some\nmoney you you realize that\nfear doesn't help you be creative\nso your creativity actually shrinks\nwhen you're under immense pressure and\nfear yeah because creativity of course\ncreativity also comes from pain but\ncreativity also needs abundance\nto really flourish that's true you have\na great part in your you have a great\nchapter or section in your book that\nsays follow the pain in your heart\nand it sounds like you had a pain in\nyour heart like i got to pay for rent\nand i've got this creative endeavor that\ni really want to take on and so you went\nall in on that yeah exactly the fear now\nthat i think that i'm i'm really i\ntheoretically understand but i'm still\nworking on you haven't done that i\nhaven't done yet\nis\ni wish i could\ntalk to every person\nthat\nfollowed me on social\nand share my heart with them like i wish\nmy fear is that people don't understand\nmy heart\nand theoretically i know that\nno one will ever fully understand me and\nso i have to be able to let go of that\nbut i think it's hard like you said when\nyou're living a public life\nand you want to be able to share your\ntruth with people and you want everyone\nto understand you like for example if me\nand you are talking we can give each\nother time of day to understand each\nother yes context conversation and back\nand forth yeah depth and like reflection\nbut when you have\neven if you have a video or you have a\npodcast\nspeaking to someone one-on-one is a\ntotally different experience that's why\npodcasts work because even though we\nknow other people are going to hear this\nreally it's a conversation between us\nwhat is the thing that you really wish\npeople understood about you\nabout your heart if you had\n60 seconds to two minutes to share that\nback to your audience yeah what would\nyou say that's i don't really want them\nto hear yeah i'd say that i'd want\npeople to know\nthat my intention has always been to\nserve it always will be that's the place\ni come from\nand that i try my best every single day\nto\ndo what i love in a way that can help\nother people grow yeah and that\ni'm not perfect\nuh i i'm i don't have it all figured out\nbut i'm learning along the way and i'm\nsharing what i've learned yeah and that\nto me is you know that to me is probably\nin 60 second version sure sure what\nwould you say yours is what would you\nsay i think it's a lot of pressure for\nespecially since you're a monk you\nprobably have more pressure because\npeople assume that like you're supposed\nto be this perfect spiritual i don't\nknow i'm just making an assumption but\nthat might be part of the pressure and i\nthink people need to understand that\nwe're all human beings just trying to\nlike figure it out and and i know your\nheart and i know what you've been\nthrough and i know the challenges and\nthings you've overcome\nand i think it's it's unfortunate that\nanyone with any size of an audience has\na pressure to be perfect with everything\nin their life\nand there's so much happening in the\nworld right now where they're just\ncanceling everyone where it seems like\nit's exhausting like you have to be\nperfect that's why people are more\nafraid than ever to be vulnerable\nbecause it's just another thing to knock\npeople down yeah but that's what i was\ngonna ask you has there ever been a time\nwhere you felt you were vulnerable and\nopen\nwhere actually you found people took\nadvantage of it or distanced themselves\nfrom you or have you always found that\nvulnerability\nhas acted in this superpower and there's\nno right or wrong answer i really want\nto know like have you always found that\nvulnerability and then and then what is\nthat vulnerability if that's the case\nhow was it done artfully um the first\nthing that's coming up is\ni was really worried i didn't think\npeople would receive me for opening up\nabout sexual trauma i didn't think they\nwould i thought they would like say\nnasty things or whatever distance\nthemselves but it was like the complete\nopposite where\nthat vulnerability really\nand again i wasn't doing it for some\ntype of marketing strategy i was just\nlike i need to get this off my chest and\ni wanted to share it\num\ngosh i'm trying to think of like being\nvulnerable\nbut time where it didn't work i feel\nlike it always works out\ni think uh you know a year and a half\nago i was going through a breakup\nand that was a very\nvulnerable time for me because i had\npeople that didn't have the full context\nand weren't actually reaching out to me\nto ask me questions they were just\nmaking assumptions\nand that was more of a painful challenge\nto go through of realizing oh here's who\nmy real friends are and here's who\npeople who have just like always taken\nfor years but when i'm going through\nsomething where they don't really know\nwhat's going on\nthey make assumptions and they don't\nbecome vulnerable with me so that was\nlike a moment where i was like man that\nkind of sucks that\nyou know but it was also great in the\nfact that i learned who my friends were\nyeah and so it was like i got to purge a\nlot of people and you were really\ninstrumental in helping me like you know\npeople are going to come and go\nyou can't hold on to relationships and\nyou don't want to hold on to a\nrelationship\nif they're single-sided or if they're\njudgmental or if they're\nwhatever righteous about something\nwithout actually taking the time to be\nthoughtful ask questions\nlisten with an open heart and hear\nwhat's actually really going on\nand i think that was a\nthere was a time where i was like\nit's hard in the moment when you're in\nit but i kept saying to myself i'm going\nto have hindsight now hindsight now\nheinz out now but the end of this year\nit's new year's eve\nlike i'm going to be in a completely\ndifferent place and this is all going to\nbe happening\nit's all going to be happening and\nserving me in a much greater way that's\ngoing to set me up for something that i\nwould never been able to do in the\nfuture and i feel like\nthe adversity that we go through sets us\nup for incredible things but it's so\nhard to see it and go through it in that\nmoment\nbut by the end of that year\ni was with a woman the woman of my\ndreams\ni\nwas purged relationships that were\ntakers of me for years just wanting me\nto promote them and help them and make\nintroductions who were only single-sided\ni purged these judgmental people on my\nlife i developed deeper relationships\nwith the people i had who were there for\nme\nyou being one of them and\ni freed myself of the need to please\nother people yeah and that was a that\nwas another fear of mine which is like\ni want everyone to like me i want\neveryone to understand me kind of like\nyou it's like yeah but if they actually\nknew what was really happening they\nwould know what's going on in my heart\nand all these things but\nand so when i freed myself of that it\nwas like\ni'm in a i'm in the healthiest\nrelationship i've ever been in\ni'll tell you why she's the woman of my\ndreams\nyet if we broke up tomorrow\ni'd be okay\nbecause i'm such a piece knowing that\nthis is happening for me and\nshe's in my life for a reason right now\nand hopefully it lasts a long time but\nif it doesn't for whatever reason\nwe weren't supposed to force it and it's\nsetting me up for something that i\nlearned to to use in the next\nrelationship or the next part of my life\nand i've never been really i'm getting\nchills right now because i've never been\nin a relationship where i've been able\nto say like i'd be okay if it didn't\nwork out\nand that's why i stayed in relationships\ntoo long because i was too afraid to let\nthat go and feel alone and feel insecure\nand i'm just like if she broke up with\nme or if we decided he wasn't the right\nfit\ni'd be at peace because\ni'm not attached this is something you\ntaught me it's about really being\nunattached to the outcome like being\nunattached\nto whatever it looks like and knowing\nthat if i keep focusing on my heart if i\nkeep focusing on giving if i keep\nfocusing on growing if i keep focusing\non loving people and loving myself\nthen i'm going to reject and attract the\nright things in my life whether it be my\nrelationships intimately business\npartnerships friends you're going to\nrepel\npeople that don't want to be in that\nenergy and you're going to be a magnet\nto beautiful things\nand that's why like in the first time in\nmy life in my mind i'm like\nmy mind is calm and my heart is at peace\nbecause i'm not attached to something\nneeding to look a certain way\nit feels beautiful what a beautiful\nplace to be i'd be sad listen i don't\nwant to end the relationship i'd be sad\ni'd be like okay i'm sure there'd be\nsome grieving\nbut\ni just like i feel like i've been\nthrough so many hard things\nin my life emotionally internally that\ni'm like\ni'm fine i'm okay i'm alive i'm here and\nit's actually\nit's almost like\nthat thing that didn't work out\npushed me up higher to the next greater\nthing yeah and that relationship\ntaught me this lesson that's allowed me\nto do this thing and\nthis person is getting me to actually\nlearn spanish which has been something i\nwant to do for 20 years and this person\ngot me to open my heart and talk about\nsexual abuse and it's like it's all\nhelping me and serve me to then serve\nand give more energy to the world\nand i think that's what people need to\nlook at is like the challenge that i'm\nfacing right now the adversity you're\nfacing whether it be cobit a\nrelationship you're you lost your job\nlike you need to look at this as the\ngreatest gift of your life because\nit is\nif you look at it as the greatest\nadversity then you'll stay in that space\nfor much longer until you realize this\nis a beautiful gift and it's serving me\nwhere do i find the lesson and how can i\nlean into the lesson and grow from there\nthat is beautiful man well said like\nthat is truly you know you're speaking\nto our hearts right now like that is\nsuch a beautiful place to live yeah it\nsounds like yeah because it is a\ncomplete relationship with yourself\ngosh first\nwhich is what you started with i i think\nuh\nthe most interesting relationship we\nhave is the relationship we have with\nourself or\nsource or god or higher or our power but\ni think the the self image we have\nlike i remember looking in the mirror as\na kid and not loving myself and if if\nyou can look in the mirror without\nnarcissism\nbut actually like pure love\nfor all that you've had to overcome all\nthat you've been through all you've\naccomplished your way of being how\nyou've been kind to human beings and\nkind yourself and if you can fully look\nin the mirror and say i love you and i'm\ngrateful for you and i'm proud of you\nthose are three of the most incredible\nthings that a person could say because\nmost people can't say those things today\ni bet if you're listening or watching\nthis right now\nthat there's a lot of people that can't\nlook themselves in the mirror\ntake their clothes off down to their\nunderwear and say\ni love you\ni'm proud of you\nand\nyou matter right those three things are\nprobably things that it's hard\nmaybe you love some things we don't love\neverything\nand i\nthere's a lot i want to work on i'm not\nperfect i there's a lot of flaws but\nit's like at the end of the day i ask\nmyself did i show up and do the best i\ncould like you\ndid i give to the best that i could\nand\nam i following my mission my purpose you\nknow i think like a monk you give a\nclear outline of how to discover and\nfollow your purpose\nwithout a purpose we are really feeling\nlost and we're going to feel like we're\nnever enough because we're chasing a\nbunch of things that aren't the mission\nso that's why i keep going back to your\nbook because i think it's really like\nthe handbook for living a great life for\npeople\nthat if you know i got an early copy so\ni feel blessed to like learn this stuff\nnow and apply it to my life but\nyou know it wasn't until a few years ago\nwhen i really was able to look at myself\nin the mirror and say like i'm proud of\nyou and i love you and you matter and i\nthink that's sad but also\nexciting at the same time because i\nthink if people can learn that\nquicker\nthey're gonna have much more peace in\ntheir heart and that's what we all need\nlewis has man this is literally\neverything you're saying today is just\nlike it's hitting the heart yeah like\ni'm hearing you speak today and we speak\noften so i'm used to having\nconversations with you we always have\nlike three four hour conversations\nwhether we're walking or sitting\nbut everything you're saying today is\nlike going straight to the heart like\nit's just decluttering for me yeah and\nso i'm hoping that everyone who's\nlistening or watching right now you're\nlistening to lewis going i need more of\nthis guy in my life because he's so\nclear so crystal clear\nand and i can tell that it's because\nyou've done the work over the last few\nyears like this isn't just see saying\nthose things like it's just a theory\nyeah it's really theory and it's also\nnot just reading the lines right you're\nnot just saying that to yourself in the\nmirror to say it to yourself yeah you're\ndoing the internal work\nto be able to say that to yourself in a\ngenuine authentic way\nwith the understanding still that you\nwant to grow yeah listen i'm not in\nfront of the mirror every day saying\nanything to myself i'm not like no i'm\nnot like i'm not like in my underwear\nbut\nbut i've done it before yeah and i think\nyou need to ask it could be a reflective\nquestion could i stand in front of the\nmirror\nand look at myself and every day\ni\ni think about something every day that\nis you know i don't meditate every day\nalthough i try to\nyou know i wish i was as disciplined as\nyou two hours in the morning but i i do\nabout a 15-minute meditation almost\ndaily\num called the soul sync that's really\nworked for me but every day it might\njust be a few minutes but every day i\nthink about\nthe greatest version of myself what is\nlike the greatest version of lewis howes\nlook like\nand if he was from a distance walking\ntowards me\nif i could soak that in for 10 seconds\nthe way he walked his posture his energy\nhis aura his love\nwhat would i be feeling what would i be\nexperiencing i try to imagine myself the\ngreatest perfect version of myself\nwalking towards me and then staring me\nstraight in the eyes and i try to\nimagine what are the things that i'm not\ndoing\nthat are not getting me closer to that\nright now how can i eliminate those\nthings\nwhat are the things i am doing that's\ngoing to get me closer how can i do more\nof those things\nand i'm a big visual guy so for me\nvisualization\nallows me to paint a picture in my mind\nand then and hopefully apply it in the\nreal world by taking action\nbut i tried that's my meditation it's\nlike what's what's holding me back\nwhat's missing\nand what does that greatest version of\nme have when he walks close to me\nand i think if we\nlook at our lives like that where we\nstart to imagine what could i do not\nthat i'm ever going to reach that but\nwhat could i be doing better\nand am i closer every single day to that\ngreat image of myself that i want to be\nthe thing that makes me proud that makes\nme feel like i matter that i love myself\nand i think\nit's a it's a powerful\nuh\ntechnique that i use daily to to help me\nget there dude that's so powerful it's\nfun that's so powerful\nbecause visualize it most of us are\nvisual thinkers or at least the ones of\nus that are and all of us love visuals\nwhether it's movies or music videos or\nand you're so right that when you start\nto see it clearly in your mind and\nyou've always talked about this i've\nalready talked about this on ellen i've\nheard you talk about this uh on multiple\ninterviews where you always talk about\nlike it starts with the dream yes but\nit's like the dream is something you\nhave to see first\nright and that is what a dream is when\nyou go to sleep and you dream it means\nyou saw something\nand that's where it starts and and i\nwant to start here by\ntalking about something that you've got\nthat started as a dream that started as\na visual in your mind that now\nis about to reach its 1 000th episode\nyeah which is your podcast the school of\ngreatness which is what the first book\nwas\nuh based on for those of you who haven't\nread it this is uh lewis's first ever\nbook new york times bestselling author\nof this book the school of greatness but\nyou're on your thousandth episode crazy\nman yeah i wanna you know i remember\nas i started to go through my healing\nprocess seven and a half eight years ago\ni had an idea i was like i just want to\ninterview great minds and because i'm\nlearning from so many great people i was\na great networker and i would\nget a seat at the table and i would get\na one-on-one call with them i was like\nman i just wish everyone could hear the\ninformation that they're sharing and i\nalways thought i was asking the dumbest\nquestions when i would talk to them like\nthe most basic dumb questions\nbut for whatever reason they were like\nso grateful that i asked them\nand i was like but i just feel like no\neveryone will make fun of me if i ask\nthese questions\nso i had you know i was like i feel like\ni'm doing a disservice by getting all\nthis knowledge and not sharing with\nother people\nmy dumb questions right and um i was\nlike i just want to launch a show this\nis way before podcast was popular\n2012 i had the idea and i was like i\nwant to launch this show i want to do it\nonce a week\nand i had one episode with one listener\nto start and now we're 250 million\ndownloads\na thousand episodes in\nand i didn't know what would what would\nhappen from the dream it was like i just\nwant to create this thing and start it\nand i want to do it for a year it was an\nexperiment just like everything else\nbecause i wasn't a polished interviewer\ni didn't have radio skills i wasn't like\nan on-camera host i was none of that\nbut i was like this is an experiment to\novercome fears to put myself out there\nand allow people to hear me ask dumb\nquestions and hopefully based on me\nlearning they can learn\nand i think a lot of people that\nhave a dream of doing something they're\nthey're just wrapped up in so much fear\nthat if you could just get it started\nand be consistent you'll see so many\nbeautiful things that come from it i\nnever knew i would launch a book from\nthe podcast or the second book or a live\nevent or coaching or court like i didn't\nthey all stemmed from people saying\nwe want more can you create something\nelse yes same thing with you you\nprobably never knew when i i'm gonna do\nthese videos once a month and\ninspire people you never knew that you\nwould have this book that is going to be\na number one new york time bestseller\ninternational phenomenon i'm calling it\nnow before it comes out you didn't know\nyou'd have a podcast that's now one of\nthe top 50 in the world on itunes you\ndidn't know these things would come\ncome from it but you had a dream of like\ni just want to create videos that\ninspire people and because you leaned\ninto your your talent your skill set of\nbeing like a great learner\nfrom your education years to monk life\nto then being a great teacher\nand your love for\nmovies and creativity and putting it\ninto your creation in a unique and\ndifferent way\nyou had the trifecta the perfect storm\nthat allowed you to share your gift with\nthe world\nand it worked and so you kept leaning\ninto it and then because of that\nimpact okay you're going to have this\nbook the podcast tv shows movies like\nwhatever you want to do is going to\nhappen\nbut if you never overcame the fear of\nputting out that first video and then\nthe fear of success of doing it\nconsistently you wouldn't have the rest\nof this i think about that all the time\ni consistently think about what my life\nwould be\nif i\nlistened to the rejections and the\nfailures and didn't put that first video\nout and i wonder how you would feel and\nby the way anyone who's listening or\nwatching right now you can tell that\nlewis is a really good interviewer\nbecause he keeps making it about the\nother person and that shows you why he's\nsuch a brilliant interviewer like it's\nlike why are we talking about me again\nwhy why do we keep talking about me\nand i'm not trying to make it about me\nat all but this is louis this is why\nhe's such a great interviewer and when i\nyou know me and louis we've interviewed\na couple people together or been at\ntables where lewis is asking questions i\nactually believe that you asked the best\nquestions like when you ask a question\nit's often a question i've never even\nthought of\nand i definitely don't think it's stupid\nbut but there's a depth to the way you\nanswer because you really want to hear\nthe\nyou really want to learn yeah and and\nyou have that and i remember my my one\nof my monk teachers teaching me that\nhe said that if you ever feel you gave a\ngood class\nor if you ever failed that you feel that\nyou gave a good sermon or a lecture\nhe said you should always remember\nthat it it is because of the sincerity\nand eagerness of the audience\nand he said that if you felt that you\ndelivered it's because that audience was\nso receptive\nto hear it's like we've both been at\nconferences where we've spoken where the\naudiences were not engaged and you might\nhave been like i'm up here dancing like\na monkey freaking sweating jumping\naround telling the best stories ever and\nit feels like cricket still and\neveryone's on their phone and you're\nlike but when you go into a room\nuh where it's just like they're just\nsitting on the edge of the seat because\nthey're just excited to hear you\nwhatever reason the context was set up\nyou're just like you can say whatever\nthey laugh in a moment it's probably\nlike a comedian where it's like you know\nyou're going into a comedy club yeah and\nif they're not receptive you got to work\nyeah it doesn't matter if you do your\nbest stuff it's about the audience but\nyou're that guy you're that receptive\naudience always i love to learn from\neveryone i think you have a chapter in\nyour book on how to learn from everyone\nand it's\ni've been i've as the this is one of my\nguesses i reflect back like every\nadversity is for us if we find a lesson\nin it i just felt like why am i so\nstupid like every year in class i never\ngot\nabove the bottom four\nin our on our grade cards so they used\nto rank us i don't know if they did this\nin london but they used to rank our\ngrade cards\nand i never dropped or never got\npast the bottom four ever\never from my memory and i remember just\nit was just a confirmation of how stupid\ni am it was just like well you suck it\ndoesn't matter how many tutors how many\nspecial needs classes you're in you're\nnever gonna be smart it was like the\nstory but i was like ah but i feel like\nif i observe people differently and if i\nlearn to connect with people in a\ndifferent way and if i ask different\nquestions and i just observe human\nbehavior\npeople will still want to connect with\nme not based on how smart i am on my\ngrade card but because i just care and i\nremember hearing the quote\nit was from roosevelt that was people\ndon't care how much you know until they\nknow how much you care and i heard that\nas a teenager and i was like i have a\nchance like in this life because\ni'm never going to know as much as\nanyone else\ni'm always going to be the dumbest\nperson in every room and in fact i try\nto be\nand yet\nit's not a competition of who's smarter\nwho's not and it's not a competition of\nwho cares more or not but just showing\nthat you do care\nis always going to be to your advantage\nyeah\nyeah absolutely man absolutely but i\nwant to do a quick activity with you\nwith the thousand podcasts okay i'm\nnowhere near so i can't imagine what do\nyou want right now i think we're on like\nwhat we're nearly reached one and a half\nyears so and we do two a week yes so 150\nyeah right\nyeah like tenth or a fifth of what\n70 okay exactly\nyou've done yeah\nso when you look at a thousand episodes\nand i really do want to focus on this\nbecause you know you wrote a whole book\nabout the podcast with with interviews\nyeah\ni i want to focus in on a few and i know\nit's not going to be an easy exercise\nbecause you know what's coming\nbut but the reason why i'm going to ask\nthese questions is because i want to\nhear\nhow much these are not just questions\nfor you they're really like you're in\nyour own classroom yeah like you know\nyou we're in lewis's classroom which is\nthe school of greatness\nwhich is what's so beautiful about the\nname\nbecause it's almost a school you didn't\nhave the school i didn't have and the\nschool no one has school i wish i had\nexactly and so you've created that so\nlet's start with\nwho do you think\nin your podcast would have made a\nbrilliant school teacher which guest\nwould have made like the best school\nteacher that you would have i mean\nthat's pretty easy i think you would\nhave been the best because because you\nwere a teacher and you\nstruck i'm not just saying this because\nyou're here you're probably the first\none i'd have thought of even if you\ndidn't say that\nbut because you just know how to\nstructure challenging things into easy\nconcepts\nand for me that's what i'm always trying\nto bridge the gap from this is a\nchallenging idea a concept i don't\nunderstand this\nso let me find the expert who can make\nit simple and then i can ask a question\ndissect it and say okay so you're\ntelling me that if we just do this this\nand this we'll be happy right it's like\nhow can i solve these problems\nand so i think you do such a brilliant\njob of showing it through visual and\nthrough\nquotes and through\nyour own\nexperience\nto make it something we can see feel and\nexperience uh as a teacher so i think\nyou're you're one of the best i think\nlet me think i mean renee brown because\nshe is a teacher yeah\nshe's a professor yes so i think she\nis great of of that um\nthis guy just had on dr ivan joseph\nwho's a sports psychologist professor i\nthink he's brilliant i've had a lot of\nprofessors harvard and stuff like that\nbut yeah the non-teachers i think you um\nyeah brene but she's a teacher so the\nnext question is who\nhas taught you the most and what is it\nthe most fascinating relationship lesson\nso who have you had on that's really\ngiven you a relationship uh the first\nthing that comes to mind is rob bell who\nis a i don't know if you know who he is\nhe's like a spiritual pastor i know who\nhe is but i've never met him i've had\nhim on a few times and i'm every time he\ncomes on i feel like he speaks to my\nheart\nhe told me about\nrelationships and marriage i'm probably\ngonna butcher it but he was like\nyou create love in the space between\nwhen you guys are together\nit's not when you're together where love\nis created it's the space to tweet\nbetween when you're thinking about the\nperson wow\nand it reminded me of a quote by i think\nit was yo yo ma who said like harmony is\nin between the notes\nlike in music\nit's like it's a harmony is made in\nbetween the notes right it's like that's\nwhere the music is actually\nheard in between the notes and i think\nwhen he said that it connected me to\nthat i was like yeah it's interesting\nthat love is like this the space you\nhave apart\nand that might be like 30 minutes or\ndays but it's the space in between so\nthat was really insightful and i'm\nprobably butchering it but it was no\nthat's beautiful\nand um i really remember\nwhen i had matthew hussey on i've had\nhim on a couple times\nhe said\nyou know the key to finding someone\ngreat someone you love like your soul\nmate the person you really want to be\nwith\nis to write a list of all the things\nthat you want in that person\nand then go become all those things\nso it's like in order to find the person\nof your dreams become the person of your\ndreams and you'll attract them yeah so i\nthought that was really cool just like\ntaking accountability for your own life\nand i and you see\nlike all these\npeople talking about like online dating\nlike the profiles people put on there\nlike\nyou need to be this and it's talking\nabout the other people like what they're\nlooking for and don't be this but it's\nlike are you those things are you just\nexpecting someone else yeah so always\nbecoming a better version of yourself uh\nin relationships i love that these are\nalready great ones like i mean that\nboth of those are beautiful but that\nfirst one especially about how love is\ncreated when you're not together space\nbetween i mean that that's that's really\nlike i'm gonna have to take that and\nmeditate on that\nyeah my girlfriend's in you know at home\nright now she's not here she's in mexico\nshe's in mexico right now and um\nyou learn about like how deep is your\nlove are you getting distracted because\nthey're not there are you\npaying more attention you know are you\nproud of yourself for\nthe actions you take when they don't see\nyou\nso i'm thinking of those things more and\nmore and i think it could be easy to be\nexcited when you're together but when\nyou have time apart out of sight out of\nmind do you still care and think about\nthat person do you still show up with\ndetails and attention and love and\ncommitment and compassion\nbecause it tests you when you have a lot\nof time apart yeah\nand so\nit's uh\nyeah it's a beautiful yeah what it says\nto me also\nin agreement with everything you said is\nis also like i feel like real friends\nare people that even if you don't see\nthem for some time for years it could be\nyears you just pick up where you left\noff because the relationship was so\nstrong in the in between\nthe space in between didn't affect it\nbecause you care about that person you\nget their heart and i have friends like\nthat back in london that i know that\neven if we don't talk for months and\nright now i haven't been back to england\nfor like seven eight months pick it\nright back up but you just pick it back\nup and i love that statement i think\nthere's so much truth in that okay great\none more thing on relationships unless\nyou want to cut me off yeah i just did\nan interview with a guy named stefan\nspeaks who who shared okay who shared a\nconcept that i believe you shared\nsomething very similar in one of our\ninterviews\nwhere he said\nhe said three things i asked about three\nthings i said\nchemistry connection compatibility and\nyou've talked about chemistry and\ncompatibility before and i think\nchemistry but i said can you be in a\nrelationship\ncan it work long term where you're truly\nfulfilled\nwithout one of these things and he said\nyes compatibility you don't need\ncompatibility\nto be fully like magnets he's like but\nyou can't do it with just\nconnection and compatibility alone you\nneed chemistry\notherwise it's a different type of\nrelationship it's just like you need the\nchemistry because connection\nhe was like connection can be\nlike you can get a group of people a\nsports team together they may not like\neach other but you can teach them how to\nbuild connection like to work together\nthey may not be compatible but you can\nteach that and they can be successful\nbut in an intimate relationship you need\nchemistry you need to be drawn to each\nother you can't just say and this is why\nyou hear all these people say these\ngirls say gosh he looked great on paper\nlike he checked every box off my list he\nwas the perfect guy\nbut there was just something missing\nthat sparked that chemistry\nand\nit's\nyou can make it work but you're never\ngoing to be truly like this is the\nperson i want to be with yeah because of\nchemistry so that was interesting of of\nhis perspective on it that you need\nchemistry\nand connection you don't necessarily\nneed compatibility because sometimes the\nopposites attract and you can if you\nhave chemistry\nyou'll sacrifice and go to the ballet if\nyou don't want to you'll you'll watch a\nmovie in spanish because you you love\nyour partner if you don't have chemistry\nyou're more resentful of trying to do\nmore for that person\nbecause you don't have the chemistry\nyou're just like okay well i have to do\nthis right as opposed to of course i\nwould love to do this because i love\nthat we have so much chemistry so\nthat was his perspective i thought was\ninteresting i love that this is this is\ngreat by the way okay now the next one\nthat i want to ask you is\nwho has given you the best money and\nfinance masterclass advice\ni know you've had some incredible like\nyeah um\ngosh man it's\nthe first thing that came to mind is\nsarah blakely and grant cardone um\nthere's a lot of them but those are just\npopped in my mind sarah blakely said\nsomething interesting to me she said\nfor years i think it was seven years she\nwas working as a door-to-door\nfax machine\nor copy machine sales person where she\nwould go to offices knock on the door\nand say i'm selling you this fax machine\nseven years i think it was how long it\nwas\nshe had an idea\nto do this\nlegging thing for women called spanx\nand\nshe said the idea would have never\nhappened without my dad asking me a\nquestion every day\nuh\nwhen i'd come home from school and at\nthe dinner table she she said my dad\nasked me what did you fail at today\nand she wouldn't really be celebrated\nunless she failed at something\nand her dad instilling that in her said\ni would not have gone and kept failing\nat this idea i would have kept my job\nand been door-to-door for probably 30\nyears or whatever\nbut because\ni had this idea of it's it's all\nlearning it's not failure that allowed\nme to grow and now she's a self-made\nbillionaire so that is kind of a mindset\nthing\nand i would say i think money is all\nabout mindset\ngrant cardone\num\nwhen i had him on he had a fun that was\nlike a hundred million dollar fund that\nhe turned into 1.3 billion i think in\nthe next year and a half when i had him\non again and i challenged him i said why\nare you not\nat a billion dollars when you're at 100\nmillion and i said what would it take\nfor you to get there if you needed to\nget there in the next few months\nhe's like it's just not possible it's\nnot possible to go that fast that big\nthat fast and i go but what would it\ntake\nif you had to if your life was on the\nline your kid's life or whatever like if\nthere was a way what would that way be i\nremember sitting there just being like\nkind of frustrated that i was asking the\nquestion but also like\nhe was like okay um\nwell and he starts thinking he's\nunlocking his mind like if i had to do\nit what would i do\nwell i would\nfind this person i would do this he just\nstarted unlocking something new it was\nalmost like he never thought of that it\nwould be impossible that quick that he\ndidn't allow his mind to imagine the\npossibilities so i truly believe that\nmoney is all around imagination and\nmindset\nbecause i never was\nnever thought i'd be an entrepreneur i\nnever thought i would make any money i\nwas like i'm going to get a job and i'll\njust take whatever people give me i was\nlike why would anyone ever give me money\na lot of it was i just didn't believe in\nmyself and i didn't think i had skills\nthat i could package and sell\nand once i shifted that and just started\nlearning about money more and what it\nreally is i was like okay\nthis isn't that hard once you get past\nthat initial like someone giving you a\nhundred dollars then i was like oh i can\ndo this over and over again and how do i\nmultiply\nso i say those two ideas those are\nbrilliant man this is great everyone's\ngetting recommendations so we've already\nhad recommendations of matthew hussey\nrob bell stefan speaks episode grant\ncardone sarah blakely like these are all\ngreat recommendations of episodes to go\nand listen to right now anyone who's\nlistening or watching and is asking\nquestions about relationships money\nfor me it's like i always think of like\nthe three biggest decisions we make in\nour life are uh how we feel about\nourselves who we give our love to and\nwhat we do for money like those are the\nthree biggest decisions you're gonna\nmake see you just do a great way of\nframing everything you know it's like so\nwhat we did what was the first one the\nfirst one is how we feel about ourselves\nlike what you said yeah like that's one\nof the biggest decisions you make the\nsecond one is who you give your love to\nand who you get love from and the third\none is what you do for money\nand and the fourth one is how you serve\nthe world who have you interviewed that\nyou think has\nreally found a unique or different way\nbecause i know you've interviewed like\nphilanthropists and charity people like\nhas there been anyone who like i would\nsay i would add a fifth one to that yeah\nwhat do you do to take care of your\nhealth yes like mental and physical\nhealth like how are you taking care of\nyour physical body to have the energy to\nthen absolutely give love and receive\nlove but sorry to cut that question off\nno no that's good no it's good so those\nactually let's do both those questions\nso who's given the best\nuh advice around service and making a\ndifference in the world not just advice\nbut someone who may be doing something\nreally amazing adam braun for me is\nsomeone i think of instantly he\nhad the idea to honor his grandmother\nwho was a\nholocaust survivor and say i wanted to\ndo something good in the world i want to\nbuild a school for kids i want to help\nkids in need i want to honor my\ngrandmother by having it named after her\nthe school he built one school and now i\nthink they've built i don't know three\nor four hundred schools\nand when i interviewed him just his way\nof thinking about service was so much\ngreater\nthan me at the time i was just like man\nhis life is truly on purpose like this\nis the essence of on purpose\nis adam braun and his\ncommitment to serving\nhis cause which was\neducation for all because he believed\nthat educate if we're educated we can\nmake better decisions we can have better\ntools resources we can help our family\nhelp ourselves and there's so many\npeople that aren't educated in in the\nworld so\nand you've been out to guatemala i've\nbeen to guatemala four times i've been\nto ghana once i've been to laos once to\nbuild schools and just be a part of it\nand i've been doing it for seven eight\nyears now so\nyou know we we can't solve every problem\nin the world there's a lot of causes\nthat we could serve and i think you have\nto find out what\nlights us up like the pain in our heart\ni go back to your book like you find the\npain in your heart and lean into that\nfor me being in a school that didn't\nwork for me\nis painful like school is a painful\nthing so how do i make it fun that's the\npoint guys and how do i\ngive back to kids who just don't even\nhave a structure or a teacher\nin their setting like who don't speak my\nlanguage how can i serve in that way and\nso that's why i i was drawn to pence the\npromise and and adam and how he's just\nlike such on a mission for it\nso for me my hand's pretty inspiring\nyeah i love that man and then you added\nthe fifth one which i agree with\nwho's given you the most interesting\nlike physical well-being insight because\nyou've been an athlete you are an\nathlete yeah you've consistently you\nunderstand your body really well you\nknow you you love taking your body to\nthe extreme\nyeah who's and your mind too who in the\npodcast has given you like physical\nhealth advice or insight that kind of\nchanged the way you saw it i had someone\nrecently dr rhonda patrick who is really\ninspiring she's been\nshe's like a human guinea pig she wears\nlike i think it's a glucose meter or\nsomething where she everything she eats\nshe tracks like her blood levels to say\nlike okay she's studying food and\nnutrition all day looking at every\nresearch paper\nso rhonda patrick was really inspiring\nmark hyman i've had on a few times he's\ngreat i think you've interviewed him\nyeah just two days ago oh you did yeah\nhe's great so\num dr gundry is great there's a lot of\ngreat experts out there yeah yeah it's\namazing what i love about your podcast\nis a thousand episodes is no small\nachievement like genuinely like i'm glad\nthat we're celebrating it together and\nand i want this to be a celebration like\ni want everyone who's listening to this\npodcast to go and listen to an episode\nof lewis's podcast so everyone's\nlistening to this one go and listen\nto an episode of let's listen to the one\nthat we did the recent one you can it's\npretty amazing because i feel like i get\nthe best out of you from i mean you you\ngot more out of me that day and then\nwe're doing a round two it's amazing\nyeah yeah it's amazing and it was such a\nweird day too but uh that's crazy but\nbut no i i really feel like the reason\nwhy i asked lewis these questions is i\nwanted you to hear the breadth of\nguidance and the depth of audience and\nthe fact that you've done a thousand\nepisodes and you still remember insights\nand you didn't do well at school shows\nthat you've built the school that you\nneeded right because when you're\ninterested in topics\nand you find the right teacher\nand it inspires you you're willing to\nretain more information and i trust me\ni've forgotten way more than i've\nremembered\nbut um but that's what it's about yeah i\nthink it's i think something i learned\nfrom you is like we should always be\nlearning you should always be learning\nfrom everyone\nwe should always be learning from\nourselves and what's working what's not\nworking we should always be seeking\ndifferent ways to learn whether it be\nlike i'm going to discover i'm going to\nlisten to something new that i wouldn't\nnormally do i'm going to read a chapter\nin a book that i normally wouldn't read\ni'm going to\ngo\nschedule a meeting with someone that i\nnormally is not in my industry and i\nthink if we can learn in those ways\nwe're always going to be full of life\nit's when we stop learning and start\nthinking we have it all figured out in\nour space or in our life and\nrelationships that's when we start to\nlose our life but we become full of life\nwhen we have more knowledge and richness\nto it so yeah you're a you're a great\nmentor in the fact that like you have\ndedicated your life to learning you know\nyou went you\nyou went away\nto essentially stop normal life to go be\na lifelong learner as a monk\nand then you came back and you continue\nto do it and then you share with the\nworld\nwhich is\na beautiful uh life man well no i i\nthank you for paving the way for\npodcasts like mine like genuinely like\nwithout the school of greatness\nbeing such a legacy podcast like\npodcasts like mine that are newer\nwouldn't you know you you're part of\ncreating the community and audience of\npeople aspiring to learn these things\nright like you've been a part of that\nand and that's not you know and and\nwhether you like hearing or not i want\nyou to know that i appreciate it because\nyou know i used to watch you do your\nthing before we even knew each other\nright so i had seen your books i had\nseen your work i followed you on social\nmedia i you know for me it was like you\nwere\nand are a leader in this space\nand and it paved the way for so many\nmore people to do it yeah and you know\nyou've interviewed everyone like you\nsaid from doctors to health experts to\nkevin hart and kobe bryant like titus\nrodman mike tyson like you know the the\nthe breadth of the people that you've\ninterviewed and the depth the brene\nbrowns and\nyou know so many incredible guests\nbrendan burchard and so many other\nmutual friends\nlike i just feel like\nit takes a lot to keep going for\nsomething for this long and i it's not\neasy yeah and i have so you've been\ndoing it for a year and a half now you\nknow how much work it is just for i mean\nthe podcast is potentially some of the\nhardest work it's so much energy time so\nmuch energy and time and and\nlongevity is something that\nyou\nit's not easy it's so easy to run and\ni've heard you say this before like you\nstart a podcast for like six episodes\nand no one listens so people close it\ndown or you make videos for 10 and no\none likes it so you close it down and\nyou know to keep going for a thousand\nepisodes and to keep growing like you\njust said to me you know we just had i\nwas saying to you we just had our\nbiggest month last month on the podcast\nand you said you just said right now and\nit's like the fact that after a thousand\nepisodes\nyou're still having your biggest month\nshows that you're doing something right\nit's crazy man i just feel very grateful\nbecause it's something i still enjoy and\nthe moment i stop enjoying it is the\nmoment i'll have to shift what i'm doing\nbecause i think\nor you know have someone else host it\nwhatever it may be but i i see myself\nwanting to do this for another five\nyears because\ni was asking questions dumb questions as\na five-year-old\n15 year old 25 37 now\nand i don't feel like i'm ever going to\nknow the answers yeah i'm going to know\nsome answers and i'm going to have some\ntools there's always going to be a\ndifferent tool or different way to look\nat things\nand as our society evolves i mean look\nat everything that's happened in\nblack lives matter and political world\nand as as things just of our health with\nthe coronal virus like as things evolve\nand information becomes more accessible\nwe need to learn these things to evolve\nas a society how can we be better human\nbeings how can we strengthen our bodies\nand our immune system how can we heal\nourselves when there's so much seeming\ntrauma in the air\nhow do we protect our own\ninner thoughts\nthere's always gonna be something we\nneed to learn and that's why i'm um i'm\nalways gonna be a humble student and\nservant\ni love it man the perfection perfection\nof life that's the perfection of life\nyou're a humble servant man and a humble\nstudent yeah i love it lewis i want to\ngive you your final five which are the\nfinal five questions that we ask on on\npurpose\nuh and these are the fast fives the\nquestions are usually answered with one\nword or one sentence one word or one\nsentence correct okay uh we'll probably\ngo into a few of these answers because i\nknow i'm gonna love them and be\ninterested what are the top three\nquestions that you think you ask a lot\nof guests\nthat give you their heart and how can\npeople also ask those questions in their\nown life\num\nit's usually before the interview\ni ask everyone\nis there anything off limits\nand if they say no then i say\nthen do i have permission to go anywhere\nand everywhere to make this the most\npowerful conversation you've ever had\nto ground them\nso asking people for permission i think\nis a great question do i have permission\nto ask you some challenging questions\nthat are going to help me and help us\nconnect more\ndo i have permission to\nmaybe talk about stuff you would never\ntalk about like asking for permission i\nthink is a powerful question\nsecond question did i i'm such an\nagainst the\nquestion of\nwhat do you do where did you go to\nschool\nwhat's your work i'm just like over that\nquestion because i've been in so many\nnetworking events and that's what i get\nall the time\nthat i try to just ask a question that\nmost people would never\nthink to hear or get when they meet\nsomeone new which is\nsimple stuff like what are you most\ngrateful for right now\nwhat are you most excited about in your\nlife right now\nwhat's something you wish you were doing\nthat you're not doing right now that\nwould excite you\nany one of those three gets people to\nlike stop pausing they must always look\nup yeah yeah\nbecause they have to search for it yeah\nit's not a quick response so i'm in\nmarketing i'm in this i.t i'm whatever\nit's\nlet me connect to like a higher source\nto my heart to like\nand dream for a second and if you get\npeople to dream and connect with their\nheart they're always going to get deeper\ninto the relationship and deeper into\nthe conversation that by the end of this\n5-10 minute conversation they're going\nto go away saying that's the most\ninteresting person i've met today\nand you didn't have to say anything you\ndon't have to show off you don't have to\ntalk about yourself you just have to ask\na better question\nso that would be the second one the\nthird one\num\nwhat are you most proud of in your life\ni think people really like to\nthink about the things they're proud of\nand it also thinks about what they're\nnot proud of so it gets them focused on\nhow they can become better so those\nthree things i love those man okay so\nnumber one challenge we're listening\nwatching right now i want you to ask\nthose three questions to someone in your\nlife yeah because there's such easy\nquestions to ask and actually even the\npermission question is so beautiful\nbecause it's gonna allow that person to\nopen up to you to be more vulnerable\nyeah i love that yeah yeah it's gonna\nit's gonna improve vulnerability in your\nlife yes so everyone i want you to find\none person this week that you're gonna\nask those three questions too because\nthey're beautiful okay great uh second\nquestion for you\nis what do you what is something in life\nthat you're certain about\nthat you think other people would\ndisagree with you on\ni mean something i grew up in which is a\nuh\na philosophy a religion a mindset\nthat um\ntwo things one\ni grew up in a religion called christian\nscience\nwhich is actually the same religion that\nellen grew up in\nher dad passed away a couple years ago\nand he was a christian scientist till\nthe day he died she did a nice little\nmemorial on tv talking about it\nbut alan had some challenges in the\nreligion because\num\nextreme christian scientists i would say\ndo not support like\nsame-sex relationships right so i think\nthere was some challenge there that was\nreally like\nuh struggling for her and i'm no longer\nlet's say you know in the religion per\nse but i believe in some of the\nphilosophies that it taught me early on\ni don't believe with all of it but\nthere's some of it\nnumber one is\nwe are just an idea we are thoughts\nand we\nare spiritual\nthoughts we can heal the physical body\nthrough spiritual thought\nso that's one thing idea that i think\npeople will say i don't agree with that\nbecause we're matter and this and right\nright and um\nmy grandfather used to tell me\nthat christian science also stands for\nthe ces the letters also stand for\ncommon sense\nand that if you are in pain if you've\nbroken something you know go to the\nhospital get it set take medicine if you\nneed to so you can get back to a place\nof a peaceful mind\nand then heal yourself with your\nthoughts yeah\nso it's funny coming back and doing the\npodcast now\nhearing guys like joe dispenza and\nmarissa pierre and all these other great\nand yourself talking about like it's all\nin the thought it's in the mind it's in\nlike how you think about yourself and\nhow you reflect about yourself and your\nimagination\nthat i'm like this is all stuff i heard\ngrowing up in this religion so i truly\nbelieve that we are spiritual ideas\neven though i wrestle with it sometimes\nwhen i feel physical stuff and i'm in a\nphysical body\nbut\nwe are led by our spiritual thought uh\nthe second thing\nis a lesson my dad taught me as well he\nnever celebrated my birthday and i think\nyou've seen a video of me talking about\ni love this video and i remember when i\nwas like 9 or 10 i was upset\naround my birthday time and i was like\ndad why don't you celebrate my birthday\ndo you not love me\nand\nmy friends have\nthe kids in school have like birthday\nparties and this and that they get cakes\nand balloons and presents and i never\ngot anything and i was like\ndo you not love me and he said i love\nyou very much\nbut i i love you so much that i don't\nwant to celebrate your age because i\nnever want you to be limited by how\nyoung or how old you are because so many\npeople that he\nknew would always say i'm too old to do\nthis wow i'm too young to do this i\ncould never do this my time has passed\nand i was like you can still buy me a\ncake dad\ntake me out to ice cream and he's he did\nhe just celebrated me in other ways but\nthat lesson has stuck with me because it\nwas painful\nand it hurt me that it didn't happen for\nmany years\nbut when i learned the lesson i started\nto really appreciate and say you know\nwhat\nyou're right like when i was an early\nteenager i was like screw it i can be a\nvarsity as a freshman like\nwho cares if these guys are four years\nolder than me i've been working harder\nfor the last four years i can play with\nthese guys like i never doubted myself\nmy abilities\nto have a shot at something\nand i think\nit was like this\ni don't know it was this\ni just didn't have a programming that\nlimited me early on in certain things\ni'm sure i'm limited in other ways but\nit wasn't holding me back from going\nafter what i wanted\nand i think that never has held me back\nfrom like launching a book or a podcast\nor events like things i'd never done in\nmy life and didn't know how to do it\ndidn't stop me from trying\nso i was grateful for those ideas those\nare amazing man yeah those are big ones\nthey're deep ones i love those it's\ninteresting what you were saying about\nyour\nfather\nand and it's really about understanding\nwhy he did it which is what makes it so\ninteresting and and whether they didn't\nexplain it for years until i came to him\nand said\ndo you not love me\nand and i felt that so with my parents\ntoo like we never really celebrated my\nachievement so we always celebrate my\nbirthday but if i achieved something we\ndidn't really celebrate it so if i got\ngood grades it was like okay if i got\nstraight a's they were just like it was\nexpected expected it was expected that i\nwould do something like that not because\ni always did but just because it was\nkind of taken not taken for granted but\nexpected is the right word and so\ni don't think they did this consciously\nbut what it did for me\nand this is partly why i think it's\nalways about how you perceive something\nthe way i took that is it stopped me\nseeking their validation\nbecause they never had a big response to\nwhat i was doing\ni just started having my own response to\nwhat i was doing right so i stopped\nwanting them\nor needing them to be proud or to be\nexcited for me or anything because i was\nlike i'm just going to give that to\nmyself so that was was that a good thing\nthen that they did not acknowledge your\naccomplishments i think for me i took it\nas a great thing yeah uh and and then\nthe other thing that it gave me was i\nalways\nstopped being complacent\nbecause because we didn't over\nexaggerate a celebration\ni could always gradually go and go okay\nwhat's next what am i going to build\nnext what am i going to focus next and i\nthink my wife definitely has brought\nmore of a celebratory aspect in my life\nyou've been to my life you've yeah we do\nneed because me and you were just like\nokay it's done go yeah next bigger\nbetter it's not good enough like we need\nto like okay let's take a moment yeah\nexactly you were at my surprise party uh\ntwo years ago by the way if you want to\nget on jay's good side he loves\nbirthdays so send him a nice gift or\nsomething or just have a nice card and\nhe will remember it for sure yeah\nmeaningful it doesn't mean yeah\nmy definition of a gift is something\nthat i wouldn't get for myself right\nright and so it doesn't have written\ncard is a meaningful gift totally\nbecause i'm gonna write a card to myself\nyou're amazing to myself\nno i appreciate birthdays because my\nparents always did a big thing on\nbirthdays but but yeah you've been to my\nparties and my wife has really brought\ncelebration to my life because she comes\nfrom a family where they celebrate a lot\num but anyway okay that is question\nnumber two\ngoing back to it okay\nnumber three is a question that i know\npeople would love to hear from you\nif\nsomeone\nwants to uh start\nreading what are three books that you\nwould recommend that have had a big\nimpact on your life i mean i've already\nread about 15 books in my life probably\ncover to cover so\nthe ones that have been impactful me is\nthe alchemist which i think is one of\nyour favorite i love it yeah the\nalchemist i think uh\nyou know it comes back to like the\ntreasure in our heart and what's already\nwithin us and like just discovering that\nand finding that and i think so often we\nget comparison game we get off track we\nget distraction game where we don't\nremember like what's\nour true legend inside of us so that's\nthat's one\ni would say\ni'm not i mean i'm not saying this\nbecause you're here i think you're both\nthinking like a monk is seriously\njust like an amazing like i want to keep\ngoing through it because it's just like\nevery two pages has an example a model a\nframework where you can apply to your\nlife\nso i think that's the modern version of\nprobably like 10 to 20 books of the past\nin the personal growth space and in this\nkind of mindset space that i think is\ngoing to be the standard for the next 10\nyears so i would say that one and i\nwould say\num\nthere's a book that just popped in my\nmind called influence by robert cialdini\noh yeah which i've never read that which\ni just believe\nso much about life is understanding\nhuman nature and human psychology and\nhuman behavior you know you and i study\nhuman behavior a lot\nand so much of this is\nit doesn't matter how talented you are\nif you can't influence someone to\nsee your talent or to buy your talent or\nto\nwatch your talent or read your talent it\ndoesn't matter unless you learn how to\ninfluence in an ethical moral way other\npeople to desire something that you can\ncreate whether that's\nuh influence people to desire you in an\nintimate relationship a friendship you\nknow your family members so they desire\nlike all these things\nunderstanding these are i think it's\nseven areas of how to influence\npeople on anything\nand i learned this back when i was\nlearning online marketing when i was\nmaking no money i read this book and it\ngave me the tools to then say i have an\nidea how do we get people to buy into\nthis idea\nit's the same strategies that\npoliticians use and you know when people\nare trying to build a campaign so\namazon uses these strategies like every\nbig company uses these kind of seven or\neight key factors of influence and so\nlet's say that book it's a much more\ndense kind of like research based book\nprobably stuff you would like\nit's not an easy read but it's like it\ntells all the research behind it all so\nnice those three all right thank you man\ni appreciate it thank you so much\nquestion number four and five four is\nwhat's the biggest lesson you've learned\nin the last 12 months\ntrying to think of the right word i\nthink it's i think it's patience\nuh\nit's it's probably patience\ncoupled with\nwhat's the word\njust not trying not to react and\nconstantly put myself in another\nperson's shoes it's just like\na lack of patience and perspective\nand not reacting when someone else is\ntrying to come at you yeah so i've it's\nbeen really challenging but it's like\nteaching i've been learning how to do\nthat better to just\nbreathe\nmake sure and when i react it's like oh\ni didn't follow the meditation in the\nmorning i need to meditate before it's\nlike\nso just having patience and more\nperspective it's been a big lesson i\nlove that man okay and fifth and final\nquestion\nif you could create a law that everyone\nin the world had to follow what would it\nbe\ngosh the first thing that came to my\nmind was\nyou have to believe in yourself\nbecause i believe that\ni believe that self-doubt is the killer\nof every dream and so many of us die\nwith our dreams in the graveyard we\ndon't have dreams that we have\nimagination we don't manifest the\nimagination we don't become the\nalchemists of our life and create\nsomething beautiful our talent our gift\nour purpose\nbecause of doubt\nand if we\nbelieved in ourself more we would be\nruthless in our actions on creating it\nor at least going for it so i'd say\nthe law of\nbelieving in yourself and that there is\nno such thing as self-doubt\num that's the first thing came to mind\nbut i was also saying like just loving\nand having more compassion like the law\nof love and compassion because that\nwould end every war and every fight and\npolitical issues like just having that\nlaw of love would be amazing\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love if you're\nlistening to this and you're in an\nunhappy situation i get it i get how\nhard it is one of the things that can\nhelp is to say\nthis demon\nwould come out with another person too"
