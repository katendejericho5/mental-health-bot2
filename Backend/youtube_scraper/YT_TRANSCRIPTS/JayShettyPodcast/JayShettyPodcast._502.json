much\nfor doing this for being here for giving\nus this access into your incredible mind\nand life and it's been wonderful sharing\na few moments of pleasantries with you\npreviously but I'm very excited for this\ninterview thank you thank you so much\nfor having me and I'm glad to be here\nyeah I'm I've obviously you know for me\nYouTube has been massively instrumental\nin my personal journey and so this is\ntruly an honor for me I remember sitting\nin a ethnic minority TV Training Day run\nby the BBC in London and so they're\ndoing this ethnic minority presenters\ntraining they're around six people brown\nand black people in in a room I signed\nup to see if I had any skills to be in\nthe world of presenting in media and at\nthe end of it they said to me they said\nhey you've got some really good skills\nand we really think you should pursue\nthis career and I was like great do you\nhave a job at the BBC obviously I'm born\nand raised in London and I said do you\nhave any jobs at the BBC or anywhere\nmedia I'll start for like next to\nnothing I just really want to be in this\nworld because I believe I have a message\nto share and I remember them looking at\nme with blank faces and they said to me\nthere's no jobs in media and there's no\njobs in this industry and I said well\ndid you just invite\nsix ethnic minority people to tell us\nthere's no jobs in media and they\nliterally said to me they said you\nshould start a YouTube channel and my\nreaction to them was well that only\nworks for Justin Bieber like that was\nliterally the thought in my head and and\nhere we are today so very grateful to\nyou very grateful to YouTube on on such\na deep level uh but I want to talk about\nyou today uh before YouTube I appreciate\nthat's right and I've heard that from so\nmany YouTube creators where they wanted\nto get started they tried and for\nwhatever reason they were not successful\non the traditional media path and then\nthey started a YouTube channel and had\ntons of success afterwards and\num and that's actually added a lot of\ndiversity in backgrounds and people and\nalso their what they want to cover as\nwell and type of content that we're\ncovering so I I love hearing stories\nlike that so thank you for sharing yeah\nabsolutely absolutely and I want to talk\nabout YouTube today of course but I do\nwant to talk about your life before and\nbe on YouTube and I think what I was\nfascinated about most and I don't know\nif people know this but a lot of people\nmay not recognize that you actually\nstudied history and literature in\nUniversity and now of course you're a\nhuge Tech icon I'm intrigued by what\nDrew you towards history and literature\nand have they been useful at all to this\njourney and technology that you've had\nso successfully so I definitely was a\nHumanities major and if you had asked me\nwhen I started college whether or not\nI'd wind up working in Tech I would not\nI would have definitely said no and I\nwould not have believed to if you if you\nhad told me that I would be doing that\nlater on in my career\nand I I love history and literature I\nlove looking back at what has happened\nreading hearing stories and storytelling\nand I really only discovered technology\nwhen I was a senior in college that's I\ntook my first computer science class as\na senior in college and that completely\nchanged my life and but what I saw in it\nin some ways is consistent with the\nhistory and literature which is that I\nlove being creative and making things\nand like doing art and all kinds of\nprojects and I saw technology as a way\nof extending that creativity of doing\nand creating products that could be used\nby people all over the world and that's\nwhat I fell in love with when I started\nworking on technology\nand I do think the history and\nliterature has been extremely useful\nespecially now because we deal with a\nlot of issues that are not just black\nand white there are a lot of ethical\nissues there are a lot of people issues\nuh and we're dealing with a lot of\nstorytellers particularly on YouTube who\nare covering a broad range of topics and\nso having a background where you have\nunderstood and spent time training to\ninterpret different meanings of books\nand literature and what it means and has\nhas really helped me and combining both\nthe technology as well as the humanities\nand putting that together has has been\nreally helpful to me in my career was\nthere any part of you that felt a sense\nof imposter syndrome or self-doubt when\nyou were moving into that space or did\nyou have a confidence that you'd be able\nto apply those skills and your passion\nalmost pulled you in that direction when\nI started the internet hadn't really\ncome of age yet as we know it today and\nso a lot of people were really confused\nlike why do you want to work in\ntechnology especially all the people\nthat I was working with who all the\npeople that were studying history and\nliterature were completely confused like\nwhy are you taking computer science and\nI even remember one of my job you know I\nhad no idea what I was going to do when\nI graduated from school I literally had\nno idea I graduated with no job I had no\nidea where I was going and I remember\ntalking to a career counselor and\ntelling them that I was thinking about\nworking in technology and she was so\nconfused and she kept saying like I I\ndon't see you as a that kind of person\num because a lot of people were not\nworking in technology and I think the\nInsight I had was like was that hey this\nis a really big growing field and that\nit's actually going to be creative and\nit's gonna it's gonna be a lot more than\njust people who are coders behind a\ncomputer like writing lots and lots of\ncode there were going to be all these\nimplications for what it meant and and\nhow the technology we would used and the\nthe storytelling that went into the\ntechnology or that came out of the\ntechnology and so that for me what I was\nreally interested in and I mean there\nwere definitely times where people were\njust really and there still are\nsometimes really confused\num like what are you doing here\num but you know I just really persisted\nand I've Loved what I do and so if I can\nget back to the parts that I love then\nthat helps me get through whatever is\nthe hard time I think that's going to be\nreally comforting for a lot of people to\nhear when they understand your journey\nand now when you look back I think it's\nalways easy to see people have these\nincredible wins and successes and not\nrecognize that they've had their own\nchallenges or pivots or or moments of\nuncertainty but taking a trip down\nmemory lane and looking into history I I\nunderstand that you lent your garage to\nLarry Page and Sergey Brin the founders\nof Google of course and I was talking\nabout it with my team literally two\nseconds before we went live and I was\nsharing that with them and I was like\nthere's so much history there when you\nthink about the things that have had\nsuch a big impact on the world Google\nand YouTube without a doubt have had you\nknow\ncolossal amounts of impact and influence\non the world today and continue to do on\nthe on the future when you gave them\nthat space\nwhat was honestly going through your\nhead like what was truly going through\nyour mind at the time people think I had\na bigger plan when I gave them the space\nI think there was some Grand strategy\nand they were this amazing company and I\nwas so lucky people would say questions\nlike oh how did you how did you get that\nlike how did you have them rent the\ngarage and the reality is I just wanted\nthe rent I just wanted the the rent\npayment\num that was my I know that might not\nseem super inspirational at this moment\nbut the reality is I was a student I\njust graduated from Business School\nI had student debt but I had managed to\nbuy a house and it wasn't that big a\nhouse but the thing is Sergey and Larry\nwere further behind me they were living\nin the dorms\num so they didn't have the house and\nthey needed a place to start their\ncompany and this was this was 1998 and\nthis time was it was a huge boom and so\nuh like every\num billboard on the freeway was like of\na.com company there was no space\nanywhere I knew them beforehand as\nfriends and so they knew I had bought\nthis house and I had moved also I still\nhad just stopped being a graduate\nstudent so I didn't think I needed all\nthis space and so I said okay well I'll\nrent it to you and I'm worried about\ncovering the mortgage I might not have\nenough money so I'll rent it to you and\nthey moved in and it was you know it was\nactually pretty fun\nthat's amazing I actually prefer that\nanswer that's that's a brilliant answer\nand it's so relatable and believable and\nand now I think I think you're going to\ninspire a lot of people to let people\nrent their spaces just based on that\nstory so if you have Founders come\nknocking at your door everyone's gonna\nbe like yeah sure you can have my space\nso hoping hoping that that's amazing I\nthink one of the most favorite moments\nin a YouTuber's journey is is getting\ntheir plaques for reaching these\nMilestones with a letter signed by you\nuh and of course you initiated the\nproposal of acquiring YouTube back in\n2006. that sounds like a much more\nintentional focused strategic decision\nthan letting Larry and Sergey rent space\nso tell us about what was going through\nyour mind at the time because\nagain I think it's so easy to look at\nYouTube today and say oh of course it\nwas going to do well and you know but\nthere were so many other platforms how\ndid you know that YouTube had this\npotential what did you see\nthat was happening culturally in the\nworld not even in technology what was\nhappening happening in culture and\nconsumer behavior that made you\nunderstand that YouTube was going to be\nsomething different at the time no one\nwas sure what was going to happen there\nwere not a lot of Believers in fact like\nthere had actually been a really\nwell-known article that had been\npublished the week before we uh bought\nYouTube that said only a would buy\nYouTube and that was actually like a\nheadline news story that ran and they\ndidn't understand user generated content\nthey didn't understand that average\npeople can post content and have that be\nreally successful and that other people\nwould want to see it and that was\nsomething that that I was lucky I had\nsome understanding of it because Google\nhad been working and we had built um a\nproduct called Google video and so\nGoogle video Yeah I had seen two\ndifferent things that really led me to\nbeing sure that YouTube had a future the\nfirst of which was that people wanted to\nshare their stories so like we said you\nknow upload your content here we weren't\nalways we didn't guarantee that they\nwere going to have views or revenue or\nany of the things that we guarantee\ntoday and yet all these people would\nupload and share their videos so there\nwas just something very human and people\nwanting to share and connect be found be\nunderstood\nand then I you know and I think that\nthat's reasonable I think people\ngenerally understand that people want to\nbe share their stories but what really\nsurprised me and was less understood was\nthat people want to see other people's\nstories right and and this was a time\nwhere all there was like the only thing\nwe knew was was Studios and highly\nproduced content and so suddenly you\nhave somebody and they're filming in\ntheir bedroom or they just upload\nsomething of them doing something funny\nin their backyard and a lot of\ntraditional media people thought that\nthis was really low quality content\nbecause the content had been produced by\npeople who were not professionals\nwithout the same type of cost or studio\nequipment but yet it was really really\ncompelling and so it What mattered is\npeople people loved it and we saw I I we\nhad one hit and this was the first one\nthat really convinced me was we had\nthese two students they were singing in\ntheir dorm room they have their roommate\nin the background found doing his\nhomework\nthroughout this entire performance and\nit just brought a smile and a laugh to\neveryone's faces and we got millions of\nviews and I realized that anyone can\nhave a hit and as a result of that\nYouTube will create this new form of\ncontent and there'll be a lot of success\nfor that going forward yeah I I love\nhearing that because\nI do think that it is a surprise seeing\nhow much\nso many technologies that come together\nto make it a success too the access to\nmaking high quality video or even video\nfrom your bedroom I mean you know even\nhow that's evolved at the same time and\nto see that all coming together and\npeople today I think being attracted\nmore to that authentic content more to\nthat relatable content more to that\nperson next door content is is really\nfascinating I mean you're running the\nmost famous video sharing platform in\nthe world uh it sounds like an exciting\nstressful hectic job I want you to walk\nus through what a day in your life looks\nlike because I think when you think\nabout Youtube CEO and you think about\nthe journey you've been on since 2006 I\ndon't quite think we know what what you\ndo every day and what you're going\nthrough every day so could you walk us\nthrough\nfrom the moment you wake up to the\nmoment you go to bed what's what's\nhappening in your day well first of all\num I am not a super early writer I wish\nI were but I'm not so I usually wake up\nat the last minute possible to still get\nmy kids off to school and I try to wake\nup\num get them get breakfast everything\nready\nthen I need to exercise every morning if\nI don't I I'm really grumpy\num I need that fresh air and exercise\nstretching just some opportunity to\nconnect with nature and do something\nphysical and then I go to work\num you know now with covid and hybrid\nand everything sometimes I'm working at\nhome sometimes I'm working in the office\nand there I'd say my time is really\nfocused on what I think are MO is most\nimportant for me to get done as a CEO of\nYouTube and that is a variety of\ndifferent aspects I'm going to start\nwith like you know one of them is to\nunder is to meet with my key reports and\nunderstand what they are all working on\nand\num to also to review the future products\nthat we're building and understanding\nwhere is YouTube going so I should\nunderstand like what is YouTube gonna\nlook like not today but what it looks\nlike a couple of years from now and are\nwe positioned based on what's happening\nin the external environment to be\nsuccessful so if I look at the future\nand estimate like this is what the\nfuture holds in two years or three years\nare we set up to be successful then and\nin order to do that I need to know a lot\nof times like well what's broken within\nthe company today and what I worry about\nthe most often is when there's something\nreally important for us to get done that\nnobody in the company is working on like\nthere's like generally like our core\nparts of our business we have really\ngreat people and they're smart and they\nknow everything you know better than I\ndo they do it all the time but there can\nbe gaps that companies have and those\ngaps can cause big issues if you don't\naddress it so in some level I'm looking\nat like what's broken where are the gaps\nhow can I help fix it and make sure that\nwe're set up for success in the future\nand then I go home and I have dinner\nwith my family\nand I uh you know my kids tell me all\nthe ways I'm screwing up probably\num and um you know we have dinner and\nput them to bed and I usually read oh um\nI I try not to do too much email at\nnight because I find otherwise I get\nreally wired and I can't go to bed on\ntimes I like to read\nhave a chance to reflect on other things\nbefore I go to bed has that changed over\ntime Susan do you think there was a\npoint in your career where you were more\nfocused on sending emails in the evening\nand having to do that has that balance\nchanged over time or is that something\nthat has always been that way where\nyou've been good at kind of trying to\nshut off at least as we all try and\nattempt to do that yeah well so when I\nfirst joined Google just to really date\nmyself because Google I've been at\nGoogle Now for 23 years like we actually\ndidn't have the ability to read emails\nat home when I first started that was\nlike and now I see that was a blessing\nbut that we got over that pretty quick\nyou know one of the things that has\nhelped me and I believe has given me\nsome of the longevity because Tech you\ncan really burn out in Tech you can\noverdo it work really hard and then say\nyou need a break and what has helped me\nin many ways is the fact of how I've\nbalanced my work and my family and in\nmany ways the fact that I have\nalways had to be home for my family has\nmade it be that I have to have hard\nstops in terms of my work and you know\nmy children when they're in a daycare\nyou have to be there exactly on time and\nif you're not you're charged a dollar a\nminute so there's no option to be late\nyou must finish at that time and that\nhas helped me in any many ways like\nsegment in my life of like here's my\nwork and I I only have from this time to\nthis time to get it done and then I have\nmy family life and making sure that I\ntry to keep those separate and that's\nactually it's hard to do that a lot of\ntimes people will think about work when\nthey're at home or home when they're at\nwork and so being able to separate them\nhas has really helped me and try to turn\noff my work when I'm at home but yeah\nit's definitely been something I've\nworked on and\nI've gotten better at over time yeah no\nit's it's made me think about I think I\nwas too I was someone was telling me\nabout the show the other day called I\nthink it's called Severance where it's\nbased on this concept of whether when\nyou're at work your memory of home\ndoesn't exist and you know it's it's an\ninteresting thought to think about like\nWhat would life be like but it sounds\nlike the most high performing leaders\nand CEOs are actually able to bring\nthose two worlds into one another uh to\nimprove it I mean you mentioned in an\ninterview that if you could describe\nyour management style in one word you\nwould say it's supportive and I thought\nthat was really quite unique I work with\na lot of leaders I've coached a lot of\norganizations companies and\nI don't often hear that word I I really\nbelieve it's quite unique when did you\ndecide that that was going to be your\nstyle and how does it look in reality\nbecause I think we all have connotations\nof what the word supportive looks like\nbut as a CEO I'd love to know yeah when\ndid it kind of feel like yeah that's my\nstyle and then what does it look like in\nreality well so I would say I definitely\nam a supportive CEO but there are other\nthings too probably I would I'd like to\nadd Visionary too because I do think\nespecially in Tech it's important to be\none step ahead of understanding what the\nfuture is and how you get the company\nthere so I'd like to say I'm like very\nsupportive in helping the company get to\nwhat's the right future and of course\nthere are hard decisions I mean there\nare times where you make a hard decision\nand that has to be it like you have to\nyou gotta make it and if you don't the\ncompany will suffer so you have to be\nwilling to make those hard decisions but\none of the reasons I said supportive at\nthe time and I I do believe that's an\nimportant certain part of running a\ncompany is that\nfor me it's really important to\nunderstand what's actually going on in\nthe company and it's possible as CEO\nthat everybody tells you how good\neverything is that you know that their\nproduct is great it's getting lots of\nviews it's doing all the right things\nthey have the right roadmap and there\nare a lot of problems and they're not\nnecessarily going to tell you what the\nproblems are and so as a CEO you need to\nfigure out what they are and if you are\na scary person that everyone is really\nworried about they're a lot less likely\nto tell you about what the problems are\nand so I really wanted to take an\napproach where people are open with me\nthat they understand that we can talk\nabout what's going well but also what's\nnot going well and then I will work with\nthem to fix it and there are a lot of\nthings that don't go well I acknowledge\nthat and I want to actually talk with my\nteams about what's not going well where\nare the problems and how do we get to a\nplan to fix it because if you don't get\nthat plan if you don't acknowledge it\nand you don't then it's never going to\nthey get fixed and so that's one of the\nreasons I I said supportive yeah I I\nfind that refreshing and and definitely\nI think the balance of maintaining\nleadership but also being supportive and\nbeing able to talk about and receive\nfeedback on what's not working requires\na lot of adaptability it requires a lot\nof openness as well and so\nyou know I I can feel that that may be\nchallenging to\nto definitely practice on a day-to-day\nbasis I mean how do you communicate to\nsomeone on a day-to-day basis that\nyou're like you're there for them that\nyou're supportive you're open you're\napproachable like what does that look\nlike or how do you make someone aware of\nthat I was really lucky I was able to\nwork with this person named Bill\nCampbell and he if you look up like the\ncoach of Silicon Valley you'll you'll\nread about Bill Campbell and he was I\nwas fortunate to work with him for many\nyears he also was a coach to Larry Page\nand Sergey Brin and and the Google\nmanagement team and also\num Steve Jobs\num he would he would they were very\nclose and he would always say it's all\nabout the people that that was one of\nhis big lines is that you really have to\nget to know the people and he would talk\nabout when you have your one-on-ones you\nneed to take them really seriously and\nyou need to get to know the people first\nand you need to know what's going on\nwhat makes them tick how to support them\nand he cared he really cared and like\nI'll actually tell you this like\nspecific example so I remember once we\nhad some performance review and and for\na variety of reasons there was something\nin this performance review that upset me\num does it doesn't really matter what it\nwas but there was something in it that\nupset me and I thought it was really\nunfair and I you know sent some emails\nand said I was really upset about it and\nhe knew\num that I was upset about it and so he\nsaid you know call me\num I want to talk to you about and of\ncourse like I wasn't calling him back\nand at 11 o'clock at night he called me\nat home\num because he was just oh by the way I\nwas leaving on vacation the next day\num he called me at home because he\nreally cared I knew he cared about me\nand he talked to me he said like I\nunderstand that wasn't fair I'm gonna\nfix it for you I don't want you to worry\nabout it he's I remember he said like go\non vacation like hug your kids have a\ngreat time don't worry about this and\nwhen we come back we'll address it and\nyou know that that to me made me feel\nlike somebody really cares about me they\nthat he went to this extra effort he\ndidn't have to call me at 11 o'clock at\nnight but he did and so I I that's just\na perfect example about feeling that you\nreally cared for that person and\num and as a result I would go the extra\nmile for him I would do whatever he\nneeded because I knew he was there for\nme I mean that's fantastic and also\nspeaks to the value of coaching\nmentorship uh having that guidance which\nI think so many of us think we have to\ndo it alone or that a lot of the people\nwe look up to have just been figuring it\nout all for themselves but the value of\ncoaching the value of having mentors in\nour lives is is profound and can be so\nimpactful especially at tough times I\nthink I think a lot of the times we try\nand these days document how great\nleaders deal with failure and how\nthey've overcome failure but I think\nsomething I find really fascinating is\nalso how they deal with success and\nyou've had so many career defining\nmoments I'm sure and I'd love to hear\nabout the one you're most proud of but\nwhat I'm most interested in is how have\nyou learned to celebrate better or has\ncelebration or has acknowledging where\nyou are been an important part of the\njourney or actually is it like well I\ndon't really think about that because\nwe're on to the next thing so I guess\nthat's a two-part question like what's\nwhat's been a career defining moment and\nwhere has celebration stacked in the\nJourney of reaching new milestones and\nPeaks yeah when I think about my career\nas a whole it's hard to celebrate it in\nits entirety\num that's just a reality I've realized\nthat people just move on they're like\ngreat you did that thing but you know\nwhat's coming next and I tend to focus\nmy celebration on\num what's happening right now like what\nare what are the events that are\nhappening today that matter for our\nteams and they may be moments that\ncrystallize that success like you know\num a product that launches or you know\nif we identified in issue a year ago\nlike let's say we identified something\non our survey like our creators are\nupset about a specific you know issue\nand then it's been you know we had a\nteam working on it to fix it and then\nit's been a year and we got a new survey\nback that says you know you're 20 points\nhigher on that uh that matters like so I\nreally I want to celebrate the big\nsuccesses but also the little successes\nand focus on what we do now and I worry\nif you spend too much time talking about\nlike oh all these things that have\nhappened and and like yes we went from\nlike a garage to a big company\num I mean yes like yes I celebrate that\nbut it but I I celebrate that for like a\nsecond and then have to focus on what\nwe're dealing with today because that's\nthat's what matters and you know and\nalso celebrate some of the small moments\nthat happen what's happening today and\nthe people who like people it's actually\nreally interesting people are always\nasking me just whenever I ask questions\nabout things that are just affecting\ntheir daily life like what's happening\nlike office space and whether people are\ncoming back into the office and what our\ncovid policy is and all these like\nlittle things like these little things\nreally really really matter to people\nlike yesterday we just had a really nice\noff-site where everyone came and like\nwhat got to meet each other's family and\nbe outside have a beautiful day like it\nwas great I I like I left that feeling\nfantastic I that's so fascinating\nbecause it sounds like the internal\nsuccesses that are almost invisible to\nthe outside world are actually sometimes\nmore satisfying and it's really\ninteresting in a world where we're so\nused to celebrating our successes\npublicly the private successes are\nactually the ones that bring us the most\nJoy so the things that people don't know\nabout may never hear about may never see\nexternally can sometimes be the most\nfulfilling I I feel like that's what I'm\nhearing at least or at least what I'm\ntaking away I mean there will be times\nwhere we'll do a launch and people will\nbe well received and we're like yay\nthat's great I'm glad this product is\ndoing really well or that it's being\nit's getting this kind of adoption but\nthose those moments just don't happen\nthat much\num and the reality is most of the things\nthat we're doing are what we're dealing\nwith in the everyday and how do we make\nsure that what we're doing in the\neveryday is celebrated\nand also uh you know I don't want to pin\nour happiness or the happiness of the\ncompany either just on what the external\npoint of view is like I think it's\nreally important for us to have an\nunderstanding like these are our metrics\nthis is what we think is important if\nyou disagree like we can have a\nconversation about what our internal\nmetrics should be or how they should be\nchanged or how we should measure that\nbut the external world is is Rocky and\nbumpy and unpredictable and they don't\nhave the same set of information that we\ndo and so I don't want us to just be\nswung back and forth like oh now they\nlove us now they hate us\num we're happy we're sad you know\neveryone if they come and be completely\nconfused like what's going on it was\ngood and now it's bad and and like I\nhave to be able to explain\nconsistently to the company about you\nknow where we're going are we doing a\ngood job and make sure that then we\ncelebrate when we work hard to achieve\nwhat we said set out to achieve yeah I\nknow a lot of young people\nI see you as an inspiration as you know\nbeing one of the iconic people in Tech\ntoday and you know what do you think\nis a good reason for a young person\ntoday especially young women as well to\npursue careers in technology like what\nwould be a good reason or intention for\ngetting into technology that you think\ncould Inspire younger Generations I\nwould say it's a great career for\neveryone in all backgrounds and one of\nthe things I've been really concerned\nabout is not seeing enough diversity and\nnot seeing enough women but all\ndifferent backgrounds like just not\nseeing a lot of diverse enough diversity\noverall in Tech and if you look at\nchange in our society it's cut a lot of\nit is coming from Tech and so who are\nthe people that are changing it who are\nthe ones that are driving that\nuh you want it to be a diverse set of\npeople and I think that Tech\nhas uh at least traditionally had an\nimage of being a very difficult place to\nwork fast moving long hours like you\nhave to be a like coder who spends you\nknow 100 hours a week behind your\ncomputer\nand so people who have that perception\nare driven away and they don't want to\njoin technology and they don't want to\njoin it as a field but the reality is is\nthat we need those diverse voices and\nbackgrounds to come in and to to help\nfigure out and shape what that future is\nand and reasons to go into it you know\nas you're asking is like you can make a\ndifference your products are used by you\nknow millions of people all over the\nworld\num it's a good career there's there's\nalways going to be demand for your\nskills and\nI so I think it's a really important\narea for us to have more diversity I\nthink computer science should be taught\nto everyone at school and the reason\nthat it's not taught at school right now\nis basically because there are not\nenough resources like there's not enough\ncomputers or not enough computer science\nteachers who can teach it and so as a\nresult it's given to a smaller set of\npeople and they don't have it's harder\nto get those skills\num and then a lot of times like the\nintroductory you know computer science\ncourse is not really as introductory as\nit really should be and so people join\nin and think it's hard and they're like\noh this is really hard and they drop out\nbut I think it should be taught\neverywhere and the introductory class\ntruly be introductory and if you did\nthat a lot more people would understand\nlike oh this isn't that hard I can do it\nI can get jobs I can make change I can\nbe part of this trend and an industry\nand make a difference and that would be\nreally welcome yeah I mean how how far\nobviously the Tech Industries changed so\nmuch while you've been in it\nhow much further do you think it has to\ngo like what what is that change that's\nneeded what are the shifts that are\nrequired to get it to where you see the\nfuture of it and how much has it\nprogressed during the time you've been\nin it and leading well it's definitely\nchanged a lot since I've been in it I\nmean I I know that from when I started\ntill now it's well either industry is\nmuch bigger but I it is a much more\ndiverse industry and I would say I do\nsee change across the board like if you\nlook at you know who's taking the intro\nto computer science class and you look\nat the percentages of how many women are\ngraduating if you look at most\nuniversities one of their biggest\nclasses now is the introductory to\ncomputer science class like and that is\njust in fact a lot of schools are saying\nlike oh my gosh we have too many\ncomputer science Majors we want people\nto go back to study the classics and you\nknow um Humanities and it's true we need\nall kinds of people so I I do see it\nchanging but it's just not changing fast\nenough there's still like when we look\nat our overall stats they're still not\nnot enough women here but you know I\nthink it makes a difference like I was\nthinking like who were my role models\nwhen I started like who and and I can\nonly remember one woman that I really\nlooked up to when I started which was\nDonna dubinski who started palm and now\nI think if you're a young woman there\nare like a lot of companies have been\nstarted there are a lot of women\nFounders and there's all there's you\nknow there's a whole range of tech from\nlike Hardware to\nyou know fintech to bio Tech\num right to Consumer software so there's\nmany different areas and I think there\nare a lot more Role Models too how do\nyou find as as the sea of YouTube like\nwhen you're\nplaying this role I feel like as you\nwere saying the industry is moving so\nfast there's so many things constantly\nchanging\nhow have you figured out how do you know\nwhen it YouTube is changing fast enough\nor not fast enough like how do you\ndecide whether you're iterating quickly\nenough or not and what is the scale and\nwhat's the Spectrum with which you rate\nyourself on I mean I often feel like\nwe're not changing fast enough that's\nlike that's actually like when I have\nanxiety that's like one of the things I\nhave anxiety about like wow the industry\nis changing so quickly and and we can't\nalways change fast enough\nand that's just the reality to like the\nsystems and the people and how we build\nand so at the end of the day it has to\nbe a prioritization like what are the\nmost important things to YouTube and one\nlet's put we have to put our people\nthere and make sure that what we do we\ndo that really well and and realize that\nwe can't do everything I mean we're\ntalking here right on on a podcast and\nthat's like an area where I would have\nliked to invest invested more\num if like you had asked me two or three\nyears ago I would have said yeah I know\nI know this is a big area I know this is\nreally important it's important to our\ncreators important to our users but we\nonly have so many people and so many\nresources and we need to focus on what\nis important to you know to the platform\nand what's core to the platform um and\nlike we're actually doing a lot with\npodcasts now which I'm excited about\num and so there'll be lots of good\nthings coming but if you had asked me\nyou know a few years ago I would have\nsaid yes I see it and I understand it\nand I want us to get there but there\nwere just there were a lot of other\nthings too that we need to do and that's\nprobably one of the hardest aspects of\nthe job is doing that prioritization and\nrealizing that there's some really\nimportant stuff that we're just not\ngoing to be able to get to we can't do\neverything you have to choose and and\nmake some hard decisions yeah I know I\nknow it's exciting though and I'm\nexcited about that because obviously I I\nbelieve I I remember my team was sharing\nwith me\nI sat the other day separate of this\nconversation but it I don't know it\nexactly but it was around the idea that\nyou know the number one platform where\npodcasts are being viewed for the\nlongest amount of time is YouTube\nobviously and so the fact that it's\nalmost yeah the almost the fact that\nit's happened in an opposite way is\ngreat because uh you know people are\nalready using the platform in that way I\nknow it's been incredible for us from\nthe video but we always wanted a video\nversion of the show and you know it's\nalways been YouTube first in the way\nit's been edited and designed and we\nknow that that's where it's consumed and\nto me\nthat's what's so beautiful about about\nthe platform is often you're able to\nthen see the stats and the data and then\nI guess invest accordingly and\nprioritize accordingly so very excited\npersonally and for the rest of the\npodcast the community for the\nadvancements and the announcements that\nI come from that area if if there was a\nwarning Susan that someone could have\ngiven you before the beginning of your\ncareer what do you think it would have\nbeen if there was a warning maybe just a\npiece of advice but something that you\nwould have liked a bit of caution around\nbecause I think when we when we start\nsomething we can be highly optimistic\nand then we start to learn the reality\nof a situation what would have been\nuseful one of the things you know when I\nI look at my career like certainly being\npersistent\num like there are a lot of setbacks I I\ndon't want to say like it's always been\neasy or everyone's always been nice and\nfriendly and helpful like there have\nbeen a lot of hard times\nbut for me it's been really important\njust to be persistent and and to not\ngive up and to believe and for me a lot\nof it has been just that I believe in\nthe mission of what we're doing and\nproviding information and access and\nenabling people to have jobs and and\nlike share their voices and tell their\nstories and when people tell me about\nhow that's made a difference for them\nlike that makes all the hard times\nworthwhile that that like that just\nmakes them all melt away and so having\nthe mission has helped a lot but you\nknow I certainly understanding that it's\ngoing to be hard it's not going to be\neasy and and you can't give up you have\nto just stick with it is there a habit\nthat you've developed over time a\ndiscipline a habit a a mantra and\naffirmation a practice that you feel has\nmade\nlife easier that you feel like if young\npeople if if anyone listening not just\nyoung people but if anyone wants to\ndevelop that it would massively support\ntheir career and support their life has\nthere been something that you point\ntowards well for me it's been balanced\nlike I I have to take time off like if\nI'm working all the time it's it's not\nhealthy and and I actually don't think I\ndo good work either like I want to say\nIt's a combination of both so for me I\nhave to have my weekends off I have to\nhave a time where I actually just turn\noff my job and just completely reset and\nI find that it doesn't happen right away\nlike it actually takes time for that to\nhappen and but then when I come back to\nthe work I actually have a better\nunderstanding of what needs to get done\nand things that seemed really important\nsuddenly don't seem as important two\ndays later and uh so I think having some\nbalance is really really important\num I mean yes and and you know certainly\nhaving your family time in the evenings\nand sleep and exercise like that's given\na lot of longevity I mean I've been in\nthis industry for a long time and I've\ndone this job for a long time\nand and that is what has kept me going\nis just being able to keep that balance\num I think the other thing too is when I\nget really frustrated with something I\njust stop doing it I mean that's another\narea and it could be a few things like\nit could be like something like I'm just\nhaving a really bad day like over gotta\njust go to bed do something different\num not think about it but also sometimes\nlike when we're when we're having a\nproduct and it's like we'll try\nsomething multiple times and it's not\nworking just we have to try a different\napproach just acknowledge like this not\nworking let's just try something\ncompletely different and maybe bring in\npeople who are not on that team or from\ndifferent teams different perspective\nand and try something a whole a whole\ndifferent approach so I I think all of\nthat type of balance gives perspective\nand helps you do a better job I'm sure\nthat would surprise a lot of people too\nbecause often we hear the opposite but\nit makes so much sense that to be\ncreative and to be effective we need\ndowntime we need Stillness we need space\nwe need space to think space to imagine\nand and you shared in an interview as\nwell that your mom has been an\ninspiration for you uh I wanted to hear\nabout how you know the role she played\nin that Journey for you because I think\nit's it's always interesting I think we\nhear both stories sometimes when people\nfeel limited and restricted by their\nparents and sometimes supported what was\nit for you that she's played such a\npivotal role my mom is um well you know\nyou should call you should talk to her\nI'm sure she would love to be on your\nshow\num my mom always has something to say\num let's start start with that and um\nshe actually wrote a book about being a\nparent and she's like likes to you can\nlook her up on YouTube or Google and\nlearn a lot about my mom\num but you know in many ways the fact\nthat my mom always had something to say\nwas like as a kid was was horrifying\num like I you know I she would embarrass\nme she would complain she would tell\npeople how things weren't done the way\nshe wanted or she would protest or she\nalways has she always had an opinion so\nmy mom is a teacher I will say that my\nmom is an amazing teacher she's been a\nteacher for 50 plus years she literally\nshe literally she retired during covid\nand she's when she was 80 and she\num started in her 20s so she literally\nis an expert teacher but she really\nbelieves in giving people and like\nstating her opinion and not holding back\nand thinking for yourself and there were\ntimes that as a kid that was a really\nhorrifying thing because she would be\nembarrassing me and you know she also\nsays like look if you're wronged and\nsomething happens to you\num like you go to a place and they\nyou know it's not as advertised or they\ncharge you something different and you\ndon't say anything then you're actually\nmaking it harder for the next person who\ncomes along like that next person is\ngonna also have that same negative\nexperience and so it's your duty and\nresponsibility to speak up and to try to\nfix it and so as a kid that was always\nlike worried like what was my mom gonna\nsay and do and\num but that that helped in many ways\nbecause in business you have to be\nwilling to speak up and say what you\nthink and and not be afraid if people\nare criticizing you and so in many ways\nI was like inoculated against being\nembarrassed as a kid because I was\nembarrassed so many times\num and\num she I I think also just taught me to\nlike think for yourself that if people\nare saying things that don't make any\nsense you should just think for yourself\nand believe in yourself and believe what\nyou\nwhat you think and not just go along\nwith what's a common thought and um\nshe's done a really good job and she's\nreally innovated a lot in the field of\nEducation herself by not going along and\nthinking her own ways about how she got\nher students to think for themselves\nshe's a journalism teacher so she's\ntaught a lot about gotten a lot of\nstudents to write stories and to\nquestion and to ask hard hard questions\nand then be willing to say it and to\nwrite it and that has gone a long way\nshe's a big a big fan club of students\nthat's that's incredible I wonder how\nwhen you became a mom how did that\nchange your view\nabout your relationship with your own\nmom but then also your relationship uh\nto work as well well my kids love having\nthey have lots of stories about their\ngrandmother\num and uh you know I think being a mom\nyou know gives you appreciation for your\nown mom right because you realize like\noh my gosh this is so hard\nand and you start thinking like what did\nmy mom do well what do I want to\nincorporate and I'll say like what I\nlearned from my mom was just the fact\nthat she believed in her kids and and\nbelieving in your kids and not\nnecessarily expecting them to fit into\nan established mold like everybody has\nto be the same everyone has to do like\nthey're you know the same classes and go\nthe same school and get the same grades\nright that everyone is an individual\nyour kids are not necessarily like you\nbut you still have to support them to\njust be whoever they are\neven if that's nothing with like what\nyou are\num and support them and so like my I\nmean my oldest kid\nwas really into magic for a while right\num like I know nothing about magic I\nlove magic too now I have a lot of\nappreciation for magic\num and actually I've learned I've\nchanged in the sense where now I\nactually am really thankful when my kids\ncome up with some interest that I know\nnothing about but they want to learn\nabout like how do I get into that with\nthem how do I support them and go on\nthat Journey with them but but I I\nbelieve I got that from my mom which was\njust supporting people on who they are\nand believing in them that they can\naccomplish even if it's different than\nwhat the established Norm is well Susan\nI've been so grateful to talk to you\ntoday it's been such a joy uh hearing\nabout you from you and learning more\nabout you as a human as a person as a\nleader and we end every on-purpose\nepisode with the final five these\nquestions have to be answered in one\nword or one sentence maximum so one word\nto one sentence uh Susan are you ready\nthese are your final five okay great all\nright the first question is what is the\nbest advice you've ever received not to\nbe defensive when people criticize you\namazing what is the worst advice you've\never received that you can't do\nsomething Lots people like to tell you\nlike all the things you can't do and I\ndon't think they're true absolutely uh\nquestion number three what's the biggest\nrisk you've ever taken probably joining\nGoogle when I was pregnant and they had\nno revenue and I had a house and a\nmortgage and I was leaving an\nestablished job amazing question number\nfour\nuh what would you say has been your\nbiggest failure on this journey I would\njust like to have more free time that's\none of the things like even though I\nreally try to create balance I still\nneed even more time than I probably have\ngiven myself I can relate in my own my\nown way too so I'm with you on that one\nuh Fifth and final question if you could\ncreate one law that everyone in the\nworld had to follow what would it be\nwell I would love at least in the US\nwhat we don't have that is we have in\nmany other countries is for there to be\npaid family leave\num and to have early childhood education\nand I've I've personally seen like how\nimportant that is and it's something\nthat we don't have for a lot of working\nmoms and I I really think it would make\na huge difference to be able to and\nWorking Families across the board like\neveryone is impacted so like really\nsupporting the youngest our youngest\ncitizens\nhow to make sure that they have the\nright time and support so those are\nthings I would love for us to have\nthat's a fantastic answer Susan it's\nbeen incredible talking to you you know\noften when I\nsit down with CEOs if I'm honest it can\noften be challenging because there's\njust so many barriers to what you can\nsay and can't say and and I just want to\nthank you for having been so open today\nand been so vulnerable and it's just\nbeen such a beautiful conversation with\na a grounded and uh very very open\nleader and I'm very very thankful for\nthat so thank you so much thank you I\nhave a question for you please so from\nyour book I saw you offer so much wise\nadvice across the board and you know I\nsee\nthe some of the people who may need it\nthe most particularly are young people\nand teenagers like I want to know how\nlike do you offer classes do you offer\nseminars do you offer camps like I think\nthere would be a really big opportunity\nfor young people to learn some of the\nlife lessons that you provide in your\nbook\nwell first of all that's very kind of\nyou thank you so much and I'd say that\ncurrently the part of my work that we've\nfocused on up until this point has\ndefinitely been aimed at people 18 years\nand older and at this point in my life\nI'm definitely starting to work with far\nmore younger audiences and younger teens\nbecause I see the need for that and I've\nalways wanted to do that I think that\nsome of the themes that we've covered up\nuntil now are often realized at a later\nage and Stage whether it's passion\nwhether it's purpose whether it's uh\nchallenges through work and\nrelationships but we are as we as we\nspeak we're currently working on a lot\nmore programming around those ages so I\nmean I would love to partner with you\nfigure out a way to work together to do\nthat more because that's where my heart\nis too and I too share that belief and\nvalue that you stated around really\ninvesting in our future leaders and not\njust saying that and talking about it\nbut really giving them access to those\ninsights and ideas so it's it's right\nthere and it's we're right on the cusp\nof doing that okay good no I think it\ncould be really valuable especially the\npandemic has been so hard for a lot of\nyoung people it seems like you have a\nlot of really valuable tools to help\npeople adjust with challenging\nchallenging situations so well thank you\nso much for having me thank you so much\nto you and your team and thank you for\nyour time and I hope we get to hang out\nwhen you're next in La I hope so too and\nthank you for being on YouTube yeah\nthank you so much thanks Susan if you\nwant even more videos just like this one\nmake sure you subscribe and click on the\nboxes over here I'm also excited to let\nyou know that you can
