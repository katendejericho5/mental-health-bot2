    "transcript": "you know one thing that occurs to me is\nthat often times in our life our dreams\ndon't show up in the package we thought\nthey'd show up in oftentimes even who\nwho you end up eventually falling in\nlove with might not be the person you\npictured when you were 10 years old or\n14 years old definitely yeah so we're\ngoing to dive straight in and i want to\ntalk about this baseball career\nbecause i feel like every kid has a\ndream yeah my dream was to be a soccer\nplayer or a football player but i don't\nthink i ever got serious enough to ever\neven really consider it how serious were\nyou and how snatched did it feel wow\ngreat question i was very serious i\nprobably in my mind i was a little bit\nplayer than a better player than i\nthought i was but i got a chance to i\ngot drafted to play professionally and i\nwent to college to play a top-level\nprogram\nand uh kind of a catastrophic injury\nhappened now i always say things happen\nfor you not to you i think probably what\nit did is it prematurely ended something\nthat might have ended eventually anyway\nbut it was devastating to me at the time\ni really never conceived of doing\nanything other than play baseball and\nthen i was hit by a pitch tumor formed\non my leg they take part of my leg with\nit it's actually grown back it's been in\nmy leg now for about 30 years this this\nnew version of the tumor i'm benign but\nit altered the direction of my life like\nmany people my first dream just\nliterally died\nand uh it knocked me back and uh it took\nme a little while before i recovered\nfrom it for sure i mean now when you're\ntalking about it it sounds like you know\nyou push through it but when you go\nthrough that first moment of like your\ndream collapsing\nand you're back at that age how old were\nyou i moved back in with my parents when\ni was 23. right so you're 23 years old\nyes\nand i'm sure there are people listening\nand watching right now or having their\nfirst dream is either dying about to die\nor has already died\nwhat does it take to dream a second time\nwow\nno one's asked me that before because i\nfelt like i i felt like\nmy life that i thought i was going to\nhave was over\nand i know a lot of people feel like\nthey go through a divorce you know or\nthey're going through a bankruptcy or\nsomething you think it's over um what it\ntook for me was to find my actual home\nmy actual passions in my life and i\nthought what i wanted was to be rich and\nfamous and successful and all of those\nthings but a great you know a\nconvergence of experiences happened that\nput me in a position where i was humbled\nbut i got a chance to serve other people\nfor really the first time when you're an\nathlete\neverybody kind of caters to you how\ngreat you are you know you move to the\nfront of lines in life and all that and\nall of a sudden i couldn't even get in\nthe line and i got a job at a place\ncalled mckinley home for boys that's a\nstory we probably should tell them yes\n100 that just altered my life but what\nchanged for me was\nfinding a path where i served others\nlike literally took my unique gifts\nwhich i have a couple every human\nbeing's born in my opinion with a couple\nunique blessings and gifts i had a few\nironically they weren't being used on a\nbaseball field\nand and frankly you know what you and i\nhave talked about this off camera you\nknow what i think\ni think that was not my dream\ni think that was a dream i sort of\npicked up somewhere from mom and dad or\ntv or somewhere else that that i went\nyou know i that looks like it would be a\ndream but it really wasn't something\nthat was mine it was more like modeling\nsomeone else's yeah and so i don't know\nthat ironically that it was my dream it\nwas something that kind of got given to\nme that i just sort of took and ran with\nand i was decent at it and i got close\nto having it but failed yeah it's crazy\nthese adopted dreams that we have right\nvery well just adopt them from other\npeople and i love you putting it that\nway because i think\nfor everyone listening and watching just\njust take a note of what ed's saying\nwhat he's saying is that actually what\nyou're chasing may not be what you want\nto chase and it may have been planted\nfrom someone actually you may not even\nknow your real skills and passions and\nthat could start there so i loved that\nand\ngone no what i was going to say was that\ni think i wasn't intentional about what\ni really wanted i thought well if i play\nbaseball you know what i really wanted\ni wanted to be happier\nlike if you really get down to it i i\nwanted to be happier and i thought well\nif i make professional baseball\nthen i'll be happier and i think a lot\nof people you know they think they want\nthese things but if you really strip it\ndown\nat least for me i just wanted to be\nhappier i want to be more fulfilled and\ni thought baseball would get me that\nbecause these guys looked pretty happy\nyeah you know and it was a childhood\ndream that i carried with me into\nadulthood but as i became a little bit\nolder bro i was like you know what\nreally fulfills me you know what really\nmakes me happy not hitting a round ball\nwith a wooden bat over someone's head\nit's actually making a difference for\nanother human being and be honest it\nshocked me because i really had never\neven conceived that that would be\nsomething that would fulfill me you know\nwhy would that fulfill me working with\nkids or making no one knows it's not on\ntv nobody broadcasts it you don't get a\nlot of money for doing it why would that\nbe a dream yeah it's the thing that\nfilled me up more than anything i've\never done in my life to this day yeah\nthat's incredible that's that's\nabsolutely phenomenal and you mentioned\nthere and i really wanted to dive into\nthis the trajectory of your life\ntransformed when you\nhelped to this\nhome for disadvantaged boys\nand i'm like i'm fascinated by how that\nfirst of all even came about into your\nlife because i'm thinking as a young\nperson who who thinks about going to\nhelp and support and serve tell me about\nhow you got there\nand what you learned\nabout the challenges that the patterns\nthat you saw in the boys and what they\nexperienced wonderful you know one thing\nthat occurs to me is that often times in\nour life our dreams don't show up in the\npackage we thought they'd show up in oh\nyou know so good and i really i just\noccurred to me as you were saying it\nlike that was not a dream that in any\nway i thought would be a package i would\nuncover oftentimes even who who you end\nup eventually falling in love with might\nnot be the person you pictured when you\nwere 10 years old or 14 years old yeah\ndreams show up even my other careers\nother businesses they they weren't\nthings i really thought i would be doing\nright they show up in unique packages\nbut everything happens for you and not\nto you and i just fundamentally believe\nthat and i grew up my dad's my best\nfriend now\nbut my dad was an alcoholic when i was a\nchild\nand\nironically my dad's drinking in many\nways his alcoholism happened for me and\nnot to me although it's so hard to\nunderstand that when you're a little boy\nand you have all this chaos and anxiety\nin your life and fear is what having an\nalcoholic family member can do for you\nbut one thing i gave you give you three\nthings it gave me number one\nwhen my dad would come home when he\nwould i'd have to deduce really quickly\ni have to look at him and be present\nwhich dad am i getting am i getting\nhappy sober dad who wants to play with\nme or am i getting drunk kind of angry\ndisconnected\nmean dad wow and so i built these skills\nas a young man because of my dad's\ndrinking of being present with people\nand assessing them really and that's\nthat's a unique thing that i developed\nbecause my dad drank second thing that\nhappened was my dad got sober\nhe's at an a.a meeting\ni'm now living back at his house as a\ngrown man and he comes back from the aaa\nmeeting first aaa meeting first sobriety\nmeeting and says hey i got you a job\nyou're getting off the bed tomorrow\nmorning get down to mckinley home for\nboys i said what is that he goes i don't\nknow but i got you a job at six bucks an\nhour show up 6 a.m i walk in the door at\nthat 6 a.m meeting i said i'm here for\nthe job what is it i said i have no idea\nmy dad sent me here this is where my\nlife changes grown man college degree my\ndad sent me here what are you supposed\nto be doing here i said i have no idea\ncome back when you know do you even know\nwho referred you\ni said well his name's tim i think my\ndad said i get to the door and they're\nlike come back and i said well\ni think he's an alcoholic because he was\nat an a.a meeting with my dad last night\nand they go oh drunk tim cottage eight\ni'm like holy crap and i walked down to\ncottage eight and all the boys there's\neight there's ten boys they're all eight\nto ten years old getting ready for\nschool and i open the door and the whole\nroom stops and they all stop and stare\nat me\nand little did i know in that moment my\nlife would change i became their father\ntheir big brother i went\ntrick-or-treating i was there for\nchristmas i'd do their homework with\nthem as a young man athlete full of ego\ni was humbled that i needed to start\ngetting chills i had to serve these boys\nand the third thing my dad's drinking\ndid for me is it equipped me for that\nmoment\nbecause these boys all had the same\nanxiety they were wars of the court\ntheir parents were dead\nincarcerated or had molested them and so\nalthough i didn't have that kind of\nanxiety i knew what it was like to be a\nlittle eight-year-old boy and be fearful\nand be scared and i could connect with\nthem based on that and so ironically the\nentire time\ngod the universe life was equipping and\npreparing me for that moment if my dad's\nnot an alcoholic i don't learn to assess\npeople he's not at the aaa meeting that\nrefers me and i can't connect with these\nboys when i get there and so eventually\nin life the dots all connect if you stay\nvigilant you stay after it and in that\nmoment my life changed that is\nunbelievable yeah like to have that\nresponsibility\nto be a dad to be a friend to be a\nbrother to all these kids at that age in\nyour life correct when you're trying to\nfind yourself yes and you've just had\nthis massive failure\nand to have the emotional intelligence i\nmean what you just said about what you\nlearned\nfrom your father is such a beautiful\nlearning point for everyone out there\nit's like the lessons you learned just\ngave you emotional intelligence it did\nand what happened it was so funny you\nsay that because i remember thinking i\ndon't know anything about being a big\nbrother or a dad or those things and\noften times when our dream starts to\nshow up we start saying that to\nourselves i'm not ready i'm not prepared\ni don't have this experience\nthey're going to figure out i don't even\nknow what i'm doing but the truth is\nthere were a lot of things in my life\nthat equipped me for that moment that\nmade that moment mine and that and the\ndifference was bro is that you know what\nwhen you get obsessed i really believe\nthis because i've tried to practice it\nsince that time the last 30 years or so\nlike if i'll really get out of myself\nand get into the other person in total\nservice of them there's a wisdom in the\nuniverse that sort of guides you in the\nright direction you drawing upon\nprevious experiences that you didn't\neven know were preparing you for these\nmoments and i got pretty good at it and\nthose boys some of them have stayed in\nmy life to this day i love\noh i loved it bro like i loved it when i\neventually had to leave there because my\nfinancial business had taken off i\nstayed many many months longer than i\nshould have financially because i just\nloved being with these boys because it\nwas my home i finally found my calling\nin my life which was to kind of make a\ndifference in other people's lives and\nsince that time i haven't been happy\nevery day of my life i've had all kinds\nof trials and tribulations but i do kind\nof know my recipe to find it and it's\nalways getting outside of myself it's\nalways making a difference it's why i do\nmy show and why you do things that is\ntrue that's so powerful man yeah and now\nyou are a father i am a friend i have a\ndaughter called bella that's right bella\nmy 16 year old yeah tell me about the\nlast thing that she taught you about\nyourself oh humility\nthat is no big deal right so we uh she's\ni'll give you it yeah she's regularly\nletting me know that i'm in a mid-life\ncrisis\nso you're she's 16 but she's constantly\ni'm like what do you mean i'm in a\nmidlife crisis she's like come on dad\nthe beard instagram you know all the\nvideos all these famous friends i mean\nher dad's doing really well\nwhen you have children they just want\nthey just they just love you and they\nknow all your weaknesses but what i told\nher it sounds cheesy i said i am in a\nmidlife crisis but before you were born\ni was in a young life crisis i'm in a\ncrisis literally to get this best\nversion of me to the next one when\nyou're i my son was little we're at a\ncar wash the same man was there every\nweek and he he read the newspaper back\nin those days a million years ago and he\nsaid to me one day goes how old's your\nboy and he's i said he's he's six and he\ngoes well enjoy the six-year-old because\nwhen he turns seven the six-year-old's\ngone forever and when he turns eight the\nseven-year-old's gone and i remember\nthinking to myself and i didn't mean to\nbe rude to him because it's so true if\nyou have children they replace\nthemselves every other a new person\nliterally and i said to him sir when did\nthat stop for you\nthat change and he just sort of stared\nback and he goes i don't know i said you\nshould think about that and it hit me\nthat the 48 year old me though there\nshould be a brand new man at 49 and the\n48 year old should be gone forever the\n24 year old listening to this when you\nturn 25 that 24 year old should be gone\njust like your six-year-old version your\nseven-year-old virgin but something\nhappens in our life brother at some age\nwhere that progression\nthat growth begins to become stunted\nwhen we start to get affected with all\nthese insecurities and worries and just\nlife starts we think happening to us and\nwhen we believe that\nthat process stops and 25's a lot like\n26 26 is a lot like 29 and you wake up\nand you go man it's been five years of\nthe same chapters of the same book of my\nlife yeah right yeah that is so powerful\nyou've just hit a light bulb for me it's\nlike\nwhen we're young we actually want change\ncorrect we're excited about getting\nolder we're excited about going to\ncollege we're we're excited about change\nand as we get older we get scared of\nchange\nwe're still going i don't want to change\nanymore i want life to just stay this\nway yes and i love what you're saying\nabout the death of the last year and the\nbirth of the new and the constant\nchanging and the crisis tell me about\nwhen did you feel comfortable like what\nyou're saying that these boys became\nyour life\nbut then you also realized that you\nweren't stable and supported financially\nand had to build yes when because i\nthink so many people are like that\nthey've found something that they like\ndoing or they love and they're\npassionate about it but they don't know\nwhen to distance how did you feel\nconfident and comfortable to say to\nyourself okay i've done this it's always\ngoing to be important to me but i need\nto take care of me very difficult\ndecision by the way i you know i'm such\na giant fan of years and the things that\nyou teach and i've told you your your\ncontent grips me i watch it from\nbeginning to end so i think you're more\neloquent about this probably than i\nwould be but what i realized was that\nthere was a recipe of things that made\nme happy kind of a hot button thing if\nwhen i was younger for you to get me to\ndo something you had to link it to\nsignificance and recognition if you do\nthis people will clap if you do this\nit'll get you money and i realize what\nmoves me is contribution contribution\nand growth is what moves me and so when\nthis financial business approached me i\nwas not interested in i'm terrible at\nmath i didn't like sales people i was\nnot interested in that industry at all\nand they convinced me that i was making\na difference in other people's lives\nwhich i was and the one thing all my\nboys had in common were families in\nfinancial disarray every boy this is a\ncampus of group homes by the way\nhundreds of boys\nevery single one of them came from\nfamilies in some form of financial\ndisarray and i believe to this day\nthat the way that i could best serve\nthese children long term was to somehow\nbegin to serve the people that are\nsupposed to be raising them and so i\ndecided over time i convinced myself\nthat that service was being taken to\nanother level i know my formula i know\nmy intention my intentions are service\nlike for you i do my show it's it's free\ni do it because i want to make a\ndifference for other people and not\nbecause of reciprocity as you say so\nwell\nthere's a reciprocal effect for sure\nbut i do it because i feel like that's\nit's who i'm supposed to be it's my home\nis to make a difference in these other\npeople so that was a very hard choice to\nthis day if i talk too long about it i\nget a little bit emotional because i\nremember the day where i told the boys\nand it was a very difficult day but i do\nfeel like since then the last 25 years\ni've i've made a little bit of a\ndifference in adults lives now\nabsolutely\neveryone's if you haven't yet listened\nto ed's podcast make sure you go over\nand listen to it as phenomenal guests\nand more importantly you get more of\nthis man's amazing energy it's called\nthe max out your life podcast make sure\nyou go check it out after listening to\nthis obviously after but please please\nplease go listen to it because you'll\nget to see how service is so deeply\ningrained into everything he's talking\nabout\ntell me ed like\nwhere is it that you i've heard you say\nthis before and i love this statement\nand and i think it's so powerful you\ntalk about being blissfully\nright yes dissatisfied correct yeah\nthat's like i love oxymorons i love\nparadoxes and when i you say blissfully\ndissatisfied i'm like that's the kind of\nlife that sounds real yeah that's what\nyeah so tell us about living a life that\nis blissfully dissatisfied okay sure so\ni think that uh we all want bliss we all\nwant happiness but a lot of us conflate\nand i used to\nall of my content's for me number one by\nthe way everything i teach is stuff that\ni need to work on or i need to learn\nright like everything right so blissful\ndissatisfaction means don't conflate\nhappiness and satisfaction they're two\ndifferent things most people confuse\nthem they think they're the same and so\ni think the happiest people i know what\nmistake i see people make is they're\ngoing to delay their happiness i will\ngive my self permission to feel bliss\nwhen i get to the house when i get the\npromotion when i find a relationship and\nthey delay it thinking that i gotta wait\nfor this future destination the\nchallenge is you're going to bring you\nwith you to your beach house and i can\ntell you because i've been there you can\nbe the most beautiful places in the\nworld but if you don't enjoy your own\ncompany if you don't love yourself you\nare not going to love the building that\nyou're housed in you have to love\nyourself the second thing is achievers\npeople that really listen to a lot of\nyour content too they think well\nif i let myself enjoy this right now i'm\ngoing to i'm going gonna lose all my\ndrive and ambition because they confuse\nhappiness they think wow my formula so\nfar is i don't really enjoy myself and\nthat keeps my drive alive nothing can be\nfurther from the truth what you're doing\nis you're robbing your brain of dopamine\nwhen you don't celebrate your victories\nwhen you enjoy it and you are heading\nright towards a place called burnout if\nyou don't celebrate and enjoy and have\nbliss in your life but a lot of\nachievers wrongfully believe this and i\nused to believe it i was sort of\nmiserable i was building the house i'll\ntell you where the breakthrough was we\nwere building a dream home\nand i ended up coming there they were\nthey were inside working on it and i\nwalked i was angry to stay mad about\nbusiness and mad something about the\nhouse and and all of the men working in\nmy home were these beautiful um latin\nmen their music's playing they're\ndancing they're having a great time\nworking on my home and if you measured\nlife in that moment by happiness\nthey were beating me terribly because\nalthough i had these external things i\nwas robbing myself from any bliss in\nthat moment it was ironic the man\nbuilding the mansion was miserable and\nthe men in there working on it were\nblissful and it just struck me watching\nit that day i said shame on you and what\ni was lacking as you talked so\nbeautifully about was gratitude i didn't\nhave sincere specific gratitude i was\ngrateful for being alive grateful for\nthe breeze not grateful for the specific\nbeautiful things in my life and you\nteach it better than i do the more\nspecificity you give to the things\nyou're grateful about\nthe compounding effect of that emotion\nhas in your life and so blissful\ndissatisfaction long version just simply\nmeans this you can live blissfully and\nstill want to achieve and have an\nincongruence between what you know\nyou're capable of and where you are\ngreat answer great answer that was\namazing especially what you said about\nthe achievers mindset because i've been\nthere\nso i remember that when i would do well\nat school or i'd perform well\nmy parents wouldn't celebrate or they\nwouldn't get upset like it would just be\nlike oh cool it was very neutral so what\nended up happening is i was always\ncontinuing to achieve but our response\nwas always neutral\nnow my wife comes from the opposite\nwhere my wife's parents celebrate\neverything like the tiniest thing in the\nworld they'll celebrate it for her and i\nthink the balance is somewhat what i\nthink helps because you need some hunger\nbut then you need that happiness and i\nthink you're so right that that just\nthat visual you literally said it so\nwell that i could visualize\nthese men working away feeling joyous\nand then you like looking from your\ntower and your window just feeling\ndissatisfied what a jerk i was you know\nand learning from that jerkedness of\nmyself you're right i said chivas get\nthere tell us how can we\nif anyone's in that achievement i think\nyou've touched on something really\npowerful here anyone is in that\nachievement mindset driving themselves\nto burnout\nwhere and how do they practice that\nhappiness or that joy or whatever it is\nthat you think we should be experiencing\nhow do you do it in a way that doesn't\nmake you complacent wonderful questions\nso you achievers you know what you're\ngreat at doing you're great at getting\nwhat you want you're great at getting\nwhat you're intentional about the reason\nyou are not happy this is a real fact\nyou are not intentional about making\nthat a priority in your life just the\npower of intention of pursuing it of\nlooking for there's a part of your brain\ncalled the reticular activating system\nand you achievers use this system far\nbetter than everybody else in the world\nit's a filter basically it filters out\nall the things in your life that aren't\nimportant to you so you don't feel the\nblood rushing through your left ear\nyou're not thinking about the clothes on\nyour back it filters why when you're in\na room and there's a hundred people in\nthere when someone calls out your name\nyou hear it above all the other auditory\nnoises\nso or\nif you're in sales if you're really\nprioritizing you'll hear a customer\nhaving a potential customer having a\nconversation so when you achievers\nreally get intentional about pursuing\nbliss pursuing happiness your reticular\nactivator begins to filter that into\nyour awareness you will begin to see\nexperience hear feel things that were\nalways in your environment that you were\nscreening out before because it wasn't a\npart of your intention wow so intention\nis a huge thing my wife i'll tell you a\nquick funny story yeah when you're\nmarried a long time man you start to see\nquirks in each other you're going to\nlearn this you probably are starting to\nlearn this i love my wife but she's\ncrazy right and uh when we she's\ndeveloped this habit recently of when\nshe eats\na blissful meal\nand she usually she'll make the meal\nshe started this thing where she moans\nlike\nenjoy so she'll bite into a great steak\nand it's a little weird because she's\nbeautiful right babe you're doing this\nin front of the kids\nand we're at dinner for my birthday this\nlast year and a couple guys were\nchecking my wife out that you know\nthat's okay you can look at my wife once\neven twice three times we may have an\nissue and we end up sitting next to\nthese guys and she bites into the steak\non my birthday and she starts into this\nthing she does this like orgasmic\nmoaning she does for food\nlike babe\nshut it down this is not fair to these\nguys and the kids are like mom that's\ncreepy she's like what am i doing she's\nlike mmm it's so good and she says to me\nin the moment she goes\nyou know the more i enjoy it the more i\nwant another bite\nthat's this principle if you're not\nenjoying the bites of your success\nyou're not going to want to take another\none so any great meal you've all bitten\ninto vegan or otherwise when that thing\ntastes great you had yours earlier today\nthe bliss of how great it tastes makes\nyou want another bite so for you\nachievers thinking that if you enjoy the\nbite that somehow you'll be less hungry\nis absolutely not true you will be\nhungrier the more bliss you allow\nyourself to experience dude that is an\nepic analogy does she know that she's\nbeing used she absolutely knows lately\nbecause it's still a little weird\nbecause she's still doing that but that\nis such a powerful point that is so\npowerful and bringing it to life in that\nway is is brilliant by the way it's\nawesome and and it totally makes sense\nit completely it completely makes sense\nuh and and and i think that's what we\nstruggle with so much is that we we get\nscared\nbecause i used to be like okay i need to\nstay curious and i don't want to be\ncomplacent and then you start living in\nthis and it's such a it's such a cold\ntense place to live that's perfectly\nright and you begin to convince yourself\njay you're so right you begin to\nconvince yourself that somehow\nthese patterns that i have that don't\nserve me are the reasons why i'm\nsuccessful but the truth is you're\nwinning in spite of these bad habits not\nbecause of them i used to think all the\ntime i'm winning over and over and\nachieving over because i don't enjoy any\nof this i'm going to stay really neutral\nbecause i was raised like that too if i\nhad a home run we expected you to yeah\nyou know really you expected me to i got\nstraight a's you expected me too same\nexact thing and i married someone who is\nwhat i call very easily blissful simple\nthings make my wife happy right simple\nthings she doesn't need a mansion or a\nbeach or fancy clothes or anything like\nthat she is easily happy particularly if\nwe're together people make her happy and\nshe always taught me when we were little\nbecause you know we met when we were\nfive and four as a little girl there was\nthis wisdom she'd always say because i\nalways want stuff you know i'm gonna\nachieve we're gonna live in a beach\nhouse and a mansion and a jet and all\nthis stuff and she'd always tell me babe\npeople matter things don't\npeople matter and this little girl would\ntell me this growing up and then when i\nwalk into mckinley home for boys those\nwords start to really be true because\nguess what it was in my reticular\nactivator all the time and people did\nstart to matter to me and things really\ndidn't and ironically i got a lot of\nthings\nbecause i helped a lot of people\nbut it really wasn't my intention so\nanyway she's right and i was wrong\nas usual great principles yeah i love\nthat now now you mentioned patterns then\nyou were saying how some of the patterns\nwe build\nwe think serve us or sometimes they're\nnot serving us now one of your patterns\nyou've always said is a little extra\nalways doing a little extra one more\nlike yeah one more like tell us about\nwho\nyou saw that in or how you perceived\nthat and how it became a practice for\nyou in a healthy way so actually name\ndropper time but i got a chance uh when\ni was a pretty young man i'm in a gym\nand sylvester stallone was in the same\ngym as i was he and i just the two of us\nin this very private gym we both still\nbelong\nso much\ni was a huge rocky fan me too i'm a huge\nfan and he's and he's got his shirt off\nbecause it's a little private gym that\ni'm in and um it was pretty surreal\nexperience because in the middle of i'm\nlike i'm working out with rocky and\nwe're doing the rocky workout this is\npretty cool but every single lift we\nwould do\nif we had to do eight he'd convinced me\nhe's going to do eight and i'd go\nseven eight to go one more i'm like one\nmore and every single rep was one more\nand i walked out when we were done\nthanked him and we've become friends\nsince then and i remember thinking to\nmyself that's a great metaphor for life\nif you're gonna max out your life it's\none more and so it's one more phone call\none more i love you to my children one\nmore reach out to one of my friends one\nmore uh rep in the gym so i have this\nadage in my life where i just always do\none more and ironically i've linked my\nself-confidence to keeping that one\npromise because i think self-confidence\nis the process of keeping promises you\nmake to yourself\nand that's a promise i can control right\ni can make one more text to a friend at\nnight i can reach i can tell my wife one\nmore time i love her before we go to\nsleep i can walk in one more time and do\nmy prayers and meditation with my\ndaughter and that one more in my life\nhas sort of become part of my identity\nand i have this weird thing in my mind\nthat i think that if i'm willing to do\nthings most people aren't willing to do\nperhaps i can produce results that are\nuncommon for most people and that's the\none more adage that's why i do i love\nthat and i think that's such a beautiful\nthing anyone who's listening or watching\nright now like that is something you can\nstart practicing right now and you're\nright you know why that's so perfect is\nwhen you lose someone or something bad\nhappens you always think of that one\nmoment that could have been different\nthat one call that could have gone\ndifferently that one dinner that you\ncould have had like it's always that\nright like when you lose someone that\nyou love or someone dies or you\nyou break up with someone you always\nlike that one like it's always one you\nnever go oh there were like seven things\nthat we wish we did\nright like it's always like that and so\nif you're always living one more\nthen you're already that step ahead that\nyou're actually stopping yourself from\nliving with regret i i i've told you so\nmany times i think there's so much\nwisdom from such a young man with you\nand one of the things ironically when\nyou say that that i started as a\npractice to help myself be present\nbecause being present is a difficult\nthing in today's age i think you'd agree\nfor many people it's projected children\nare great at being present but dreaming\nabout the future still and adults were\nnot so good at that and it's funny but i\ndo this thing with the one more where i\nflip it a little bit and what if this\nwas the last one\nso if it was the last one the last time\ni see my dad\nhow would i treat this engagement would\nmy phone be done how would we talk what\nwould i say what would i do what if it\nwas my last wave i get to surf out there\nin the ocean what if it's my last\nworkout what if it's my last meeting\nlast time i saw my wife last time i\ntalked to my friend last round of golf\nlast whatever because when something\nbecomes scarce we give it value and we\nbecome deluded in our life into thinking\nthat somehow these are going to last\nforever i'll always have one more that's\na perverted way of looking at one more\nwhat if it's the last one if we've\nlearned anything recently with some of\nthese people that have affected us all\nso deeply that have passed away a kobe\nor somebody like that it's because it\noccurs to us in that moment that this\ncould be the last one i s i was with\nkobe\nthe last sunday tournament he was at\nwith his daughter our daughters played\nvolleyball against each other and i\ndidn't know kobe very well not as well\nas you did but i observed him that day\nand he i remember thinking when he\nwalked out of that gym what if someone\nsaid kobe you have six days left\nwhat if someone would have told him we\ngot in the car can you imagine in that\nmoment knowing that this is finite we\ndon't have forever and so i do utilize\nthat with myself our conversation day\nwhat if this is the last time i get to\ndo your show i want to make it gives it\nimportance it gives it value scarcity\nmeans value so i use last ones a lot too\ndude that is a great flip like that's\nawesome like that is awesome that's so\ncool and\nand i love that because these are all\nthings people can start living today and\nguys if you're loving this conversation\nso far make sure you go follow ed on\ninstagram i mean like he is sharing\nthese truths every single day every\nsingle morning and he's engaging and\ninteracting with his audience the\nengagement that ed gets on instagram is\ninsane and through the roof because he's\nso present there and so if you want to\nfeel that more of that make sure you go\nover to edmund on instagram and and\nfollow him to learn more about this this\nis by the way i am loving this\nconversation so far everything you're\nsaying\nis is so practical and real but i love\nhow it originates like how it actually\ncomes to you like that's true i mean\nsylvester stallone i've only met him\nonce in my life and shaking his hand was\nenough for me but it was like it's you\nknow he he had that power and you see\nthat these greats they have these simple\nhabits\nthat make a change these simple things\nthat they repeat to themselves etc these\nmantras that that transform things now\nfor you\nyou're now giving\nspeeches\ninspiring\ntons of powerful people and also not\njust inspiring people you're inspiring\ntons of powerful people in the room like\nyou're on stage with leaders of their\ncompanies and businesses and industries\nbut you weren't always like that no\nright i've heard you say before that you\nactually lack confidence and you get\nanxious big time and like i can't\nbelieve that when i saw you coming today\nlike you've got this larger-than-life\npersonality tell me about that evolution\nof what were the steps to building real\nconfidence yes not just fake not just\nthe fake stuff not just the like oh i've\ngot muscles and i'm cool now it's like\nwhat really helped you become really\nconfident because you you exude real\nconfidence wow thank you because that is\nsomething i certainly lacked i think\nanything you get really great at in life\nit's out of necessity i mean i needed it\ni was i was such an insecure little boy\nso shy and i would say even into early\nadulthood even into when i walked into\nmckinley that was a very insecure shy\nlacking self-confidence man and so i had\nto build these tools so the first thing\ni would say to you is clearly this thing\ni said earlier about just beginning to\nstack the pattern of keeping the\npromises that i make to me\nis a huge thing\nhuge thing but i'll give you a\nsecondarily identity is kind of like\nthat thermostat on the wall right there\nthere's a thermostat that thermostat\nregulates the temperature of this room\nso it's pretty cold outside today\nactually it's still 73 degrees in here\nthe external conditions don't change the\nregulated temperature your identity your\nself-worth the values and truths you\nhold to be true about yourself\nare your personal identity they regulate\nyour life they're a thermostat setting\nand so regardless of what external\nthings happen you see if it's really\ncold outside there this room turns the\nheater on heats it back up to 73. if\nit's super hot outside it will cool it\nback down to 73 degrees it's not the\nexternal conditions it's the internal\nthermostat that governs your life it\nwill govern everything that's why often\nin your life you'll get life going maybe\nyou've got really fit for a while or\nyou've made a bunch of money and then\nall of a sudden you wake up six months\nlater and you're back at that weight\nagain you don't want and you're\nfinancially back where you were you've\nturned the air conditioner back down to\nget life comfortable where you believe\nyou deserve it so this thing regulates\neverything you can have everything else\nin your life together if you're a 73\ndegree or a fitness or faith or\nhappiness or money you are going to get\n73 degrees eventually just like this\nroom how do i alter it i believe in the\npower of other human beings so i'm a\nspiritual person i'm a praying man and i\nbelieve god uses other people to alter\nour thermostat so i became\ni mean meticulous crazy i've told you\nthree times today intentionally i want\nto spend more time with you\nthe reason is is i believe you helped me\nwith my thermostat in certain areas so\nwhat i did my recipe was keeping the\npromises i made to myself and adding\npeople close to my proximity who could\nalter those temperature settings in the\narea so i have a lot of forget wealth i\nhave a lot of really happy people i\nsurround myself with because they they\nthrough association raised me to 80 and\n85 and 90 degrees of happiness if you\nwant to increase your faith you all have\nseen this if you're around incredibly\nfaithful spiritual people your internal\nthermostat changes same with money you\ncan't be around super fit people in your\nproximity and not eventually become more\nfit through proximity so mine has been\nproximity of people that raised my\ntemperature dude that is such a great\nanalogy again that is amazing when you\nstart talking about i was like yeah wow\nlike that's exactly it like that's the\nmistake we're making we're letting the\nout if you just left the doors open\nright and you took the thermostat off\nyour temperature would be based on\nwhat's happening outside today's not the\nbest day weather-wise would be freezing\nand freezing and that's how most people\nlive bro that is exactly how we live\nyeah we just leave the doors open let\nthe outside decide the inside you got it\nand you just let it figure out wow that\nis such a great way of looking at it and\nfor the record i want everyone to\nunderstand this i only know this because\ni lived the wrong way so long i wasn't\nborn with this is something and by the\nway something i still\nnavigate i still protect to you some of\nthe terminology i protect people the\nproximity of people around me and it\ndoesn't mean that i don't have people in\nmy life that live at lower temperatures\nof course i do but i manage their\nproximity to me so if you have people in\nyour life that are blood and they can't\nleave your life but maybe they don't\nfeed you they take your energy you need\nto evaluate their existence in your life\nbut most importantly you can evaluate\ntheir proximity yeah how much you let\nthem affect you how regular you\ncommunicate with them how close they are\nto you that's where they have influence\nover you my kids you said kids early\ni'll just say this yeah please my\nchildren you worry about their teachers\nright who their teachers are because\nthat shapes them but who i really worry\nabout with my kids what do you worry\nabout who their friends are who's in\ntheir proximity it changes everything\nyou've got that little time in your life\nwhere you kind of went the wrong way i\nguarantee you there were some people you\nwere running with then that moved your\ntemperature setting in the wrong\ndirection\nand then after college you end up being\nwith the monks right my gosh did you get\nin the proximity of people who live life\nblissfully and more happy and more\npeacefully their temperature setting on\nbliss happiness and peace is off the\nradar and part of it is your proximity\nto them i'm sure absolutely i love that\nyou said it best you can't change the\npeople you can change the proximity\nand and that is such a great piece of\nadvice tell me now how\npeople can go about that like do you\nobviously we know that as you grow in\nyour career whether it's finance whether\nit's success whether it's fame whether\nit's status\nmore things become accessible more\npeople become accessible especially when\nyou're a good person and we know that\nthat we both know that that is the\ncurrency really because\nhey wealthy people are not attracted by\nwealth they're attracted by people like\nhumanity right like famous people are\nnot attracted by fame they're attracted\nby humanity\nbut how does someone who's listening or\nwatching today how do they start\ncreating that proximity with the\ngreatness right with that higher\ntemperature with the people that can\npull them up when they're sitting there\ngoing yeah like i i just like you know\ndo i email people right i don't have\naccess to walk-in workout semesters\nthat's what i mean yeah that's a great\npoint that's one of the powers of\ndigital media number one let me say one\nthing to everybody like your book that's\nout right now my book podcasts those\nthose are in extreme proximity to you\nthey're they're literally in your ear\nthey're in your visual awareness so it's\nguarding myself i watch very little\ntelevision now i keep aware of it but i\nguard myself so it's it's giving the\ndigital influence to myself the second\nthing i would say is i would ask myself\nwhere do these people congregate i'm not\nabout wealth i'm talking about where do\npeople congregate that i could begin to\nbecome into their proximity and so i'll\nbe honest with you one of the places\nthat's been great for me in my life has\nbeen a gym oh wow i'm telling you people\nthink that's a very simple thing but in\nmy gym people that are typically trying\nto care for their physique and their\nbody care more about growth and\nproximity in their life and so the gym\nhas been great for me that way\nit's also actually asking somebody and\nit's bringing something to the table of\nvalue for them so what i've always tried\nto do without giving to those people\nwithout expecting something arrested\nprostate i try to think of how can i\nserve this person how can i contribute\nto them how can i make a difference my\nneighbor here is this gentleman that\nlives next door to me if he ends up\nwatching this\nhe's so generous with constantly we're\ndifferent guys he's a he's a doctor he's\na lot smarter guy than i am but he's\nconstantly always ed can i help you with\nthis can i get and i i want him around\nme even though we're very different\npeople i don't think naturally chuck i\nwould say that's a dude just like me\nbut he is so generous with wanting to\ngive i want to be in his life and i want\nto give back to him on a regular basis\nand now we become very dear friends\nbecause i think of his wanting to serve\nme and make a difference for me so that\nwould be the other element i would give\nyou is think about how you can make a\ndifference for those people how you\ncould serve them yeah that's great\nadvice and i love how practical it is\nlike i don't think when you say the gym\ni'm like no that that's right i've met\nsome amazing people in my channel so so\ni think you're spot on like you did it\nyou did it when you sought out your\nspiritual part of your life by going\nwith the monks you have to go where they\nare yeah yeah so true you've got to go\nwhere they are because yeah we're\nexpecting them to turn up right they're\nnot going to disappear yeah they're not\njust going to appear where are they\nwhere are they somewhere where you go\nfaith-based do they go to a particular\nyou know um social organization is there\na club you could join where are they on\nsocial media um the gym for me was a\nplace that just really i met a lot of\npositive\nit's hard to be moving your body all the\ntime and be negative yeah because their\nstates are high so people that work out\nhave a higher physical state yeah and\nand what you're saying is so important\nbecause i think the challenge also\npeople have is they want to be sitting\nnext to richard branson or you want to\nbe sitting next to jeff bezos so you\nwant to you want to be with that and\nit's like well actually you don't even\nneed that right now no you just need\nsomeone who's like three degrees ahead\nfive degrees ahead\nyou're just better at that than me\nbrother because you're so right in fact\nif there's too much separation they have\nno magnetism to alter your thermostat if\nyou're at 73 degrees and i'm at 150\nour vibrations are too different you\nwant someone who's at 78 or 79 degrees\nand those people are around you all the\ntime and through time\nthere's a progression where that\nthermostat setting keeps changing you're\n100 right above you yeah and that's why\ni like the places you chose because you\nmay not bump into\nx person there but you will bum into\nsomeone absolutely i love that you talk\na lot about having huge reasons yeah and\nhigh standards yes when you said huge\nreasons why you speak about that i love\nthat because i feel like\nmost people today when you ask them why\nthey're doing something\nyou don't really get a solid answer and\ni think we struggle with that most of us\nand and i know in my time in my life\nwhen i chose to become a monk that was\nthe first time if someone asked me why i\nwas a monk i knew exactly my reasons i\nhad huge reasons for being a monk i had\ntwo regions for leaving being a monk i\nhave huge reasons for the way i live\nright now but there were times in my\nlife where i had very weak reasons or no\nreasons\ntell us about\nhuge reasons and high standards great\npoint so reasons um the one thing i have\nfound is that people think they have\nreasons and they're very general\nspecificity is one of the rarest things\ni can get from people when i coach them\ni don't know if you observe this too but\nit's like well why do you want to do it\nwell i want to be happier well why do\nyou want to do it god i want to be rich\nreally like what specifically is the\nreason what's your specific emotional\ncompelling reason to do something for\nexample i am relatively fit and it's not\nbecause i'm super disciplined i'm a lazy\nperson naturally i have massive reasons\nwhich has caused me to create\ndisciplines around me\nwhen i was 30\ni had a heart attack\nand most people don't know this i've not\ntalked a lot about this\nand i went and saw a remarkable doctor i\ncould have seen a normal doctor where\nthey do they give you the prescription\ntake your stat and do whatever and see\nyou he got reasons so what happens is\nyou go do the scan he does the scan and\nyou go to lunch i'll never forget this i\nliterally ate a burrito at the lunch\nthat's how after it and i come back from\nthe scan there's nobody in the lobby and\nthe doctor comes in and he goes i'm\nlooking for edward milet i'm like i'm ed\nmylett he knew who i was and he looks at\nthe chart and he looks back at me and\ngoes i can't believe those arteries are\nin that young of a body\nand i went oh my gosh what's in the skin\nhe's loading me up with reasons so he\ngets back listen to this jay he says he\nputs my chart down and he goes do you\nhave children\ni said yes he says do you have a\ndaughter\ni said i do he said how old is she and i\nsaid she's a baby\nand he said um are you interested in\nwalking her down the aisle on her\nwedding day and i went what did you just\nsay he said i want to know if you want\nto be there and walk your daughter down\nthe island or wait you don't talk to a\ndad about his daughter you got my\nattention i go what is in that scan man\nand he goes i want you to listen to me\nright now if you don't change what\nyou're doing another man is walking your\nlittle baby girl down the aisle on her\nwedding day do you got it and i said yes\nsir i do and he goes but if you listen\nto me and you do exactly what i tell you\nyou'll be there for her wedding day\ni'm telling you brother when i don't\nwant to get out of bed in the morning\nand it's 5 15 and i've had a long night\nbefore bella's wedding day bella's\nwedding day bella's wedding day maybe a\nhund a hundred times a year bella's\nwedding day flower that's what gets my\nbutt in the gym my big specific reasons\nget me to take actions i otherwise\nwouldn't take so what's your specific\nreasons for the things you want and if\nyou anchor and link those to them you'll\nget the standards that you set for\nyourself what a great huge reason yeah\nyeah i mean that gave me shows like\nhearing you say that looking at my eyes\ni'm like literally like you can feel it\nwhoa like that's the reason to stay\nalive that's why i'm fit\nthat's the best reason i've ever heard\ni don't think i've ever heard a better\nreason that's exactly my my reason's\nalways i don't want to dive by my own\nfault\nbut that's a real reason that's my\nreason like my reasons like if anything\nhappens and i die i can deal with that\nbecause i couldn't do anything have you\nnot found that though for you take\nanyone that's been on your show or\nanyone who has achieved something at an\nextremely high level they have an\nextremely specific big reason to do it\noh 100 and so to the extent that the\nreason is big and specific and by the\nway you may go well i don't know what my\nreasons would be let me give you a\npathway yeah almost always your reasons\nwill be your dreams or other people\nalmost always they'll fit one of those\ntwo categories big dreams or other\npeople because most of you have such\ngood hearts and are such good human\nbeings you will do a thousand times more\nfor another human being than you'd ever\ndo for yourself and so if you can link\nthe things you want to the people you\nlove to to the things you love meaning\nthe causes you love or the people you\nlove your dreams or other people you'll\nalmost always find your pathway to your\nreason oh so good man so and it's also\nwhat i love about what you're saying is\nthat it's emotionally driving it's not\njust logical very rarely isn't it\nlogical it's not like just a list of\nlike if i don't work out then i will put\non this much weight if i don't work out\nthen i will that's it's not logical it's\nemotional human beings are emotional\nbeings we're emotional right what we do\nis we make decisions emotionally and we\nrationalize them logically and so if you\nat least know the way that you think\neven if you're in sales\nyour customers buy things emotionally\nand justify and rationalize them\nlogically and so in life you're selling\nyourself all the time on getting you to\ndo the things that you otherwise aren't\nnormally doing you're gonna decide it\nemotionally and then rationalize it\nlogically and it's love\nlike love is pulling you to your\ndaughter's wedding\nright like that love is pulling you\nthere it's obviously fear always pushes\nus a little bit and that's good we i\nthink fear is a good push\nbut love is a beautiful pull and and\nwhen it works together it's just oh that\nthat is that's blown my mind like i\nthink that's the best reason i've ever\nheard to staying healthy and fair i'm\nexcited for bella\nsorry i know better you're 16 years old\nby the way take your time yeah\ni intend to be around a long time you\ncan wait another 26 years if you want as\nfar as i'm concerned i love it man i\nlove it this is incredible i am loving\ni've got a few more questions for you\nthat i want to that i really want to\nthrow out now i've i've heard you spoke\nabout when you were\nwhen you were broke\nwhen you've you know lost your car yeah\nyou're like in like the worst day or the\nyou know the water turns off at your\nplace you're in like the worst place\nlike i mean like\nobviously sitting in your beautiful home\ntoday and people now seeing you on your\njet and the life you live\nthat's hard to\ncalibrate for a lot of people like\nthey're like really like did he actually\never have that like and not in terms of\nlike not believing you it's it's just\nhard to understand sure how bad it can\nget for someone it was bad right yeah i\nknow i believe you uh\ntell tell me about\nwhat you wish someone would have told\nyou at that time or what you were\ntelling yourself great so that people\ncan say that to each other or themselves\nyeah i got so broke as you illustrated\nthere that we didn't just lose our power\ni didn't just lose my home but they\nturned the water off and we had to\nshower at the apartment we were living\nin their pool it was just shameful and\nand a lot of you know i was i was\nselling a dream in my life and living a\nnightmare and i don't know that i was\nfeeding myself if i could go back and\ntell myself i would say something really\ntrue but i've learned it all through my\nlife and this too will pass this time\nwill pass\nand uh not everything in life is\npermanent but\nwhat i what i think changed for me at\nthat time in my life is\ni really was producing in my life what i\nbelieved i deserved and it was really\ndifficult for me to accept that there\nwas a part of me deep down that really\nwas getting what i believed i deserved\nand the reason was i had a pattern j in\nmy life when i was young of anything i\ndid wrong any mistakes i made i would\ncarry that shame forward like kind of\nbags you carry around with you\ni just was so hard on myself so if i\nmade a mistake there or i wasn't\ncompletely truthful somewhere else or i\nhad hurt somebody or i just failed i\nstarted stacking all of it like bags\nthat i carried and i did get to the\npoint in my life where i think that's\nwhat i thought i was worth\nand i had if i could go back i would\ntell myself that's not true\nthat you're special that you were born\nto do something great in your life if\nanyone listening to this is carry those\nbags number one you can decide to drop\nthem at any moment they're a figment of\nyour imagination you can drop those bags\nanytime you want and if no one's told\nyou in a while\nremember you were born to do something\ngreat with your life there's a purpose\nfor you you're special you're unique you\nwere born with two three four five super\nspecial gifts that are yours they may\nnot be mine in yours maybe they're not\ngreat orators or they can't articulate\nbut their their nurturing skills their\nfaith skills their intellect their humor\ntheir beauty their touch their concern\nthere's all kinds of skills that you\nneed to identify in yourself and you\nwere given those skills to make a\ndifference in the world to do something\ngreat in small ways and big ways i'll\ntell you one last thing there's people\nthat do huge things in life that never\nget credit the person that recruited me\ninto that financial company quit that\ncompany\nright and people say what a failure\nbut because that person reached out to\nme and made a difference i've gone on in\nmy life to really reach millions of\npeople if that person didn't have that\none act of kindness that one generosity\nthat one hey i believe in you you'd be\ngood at this they made a huge difference\nin their life through me and without\nthat seed they planted there'd be no\nharvest so we all are called to do\nsomething great and i just want everyone\nto hear that today no matter what bags\nyou're carrying you were born to do\nsomething great i i think that's such\ngreat advice and we see all the time and\nwe just don't apply to ourselves like\nwhen you say that the first thing that\ncame to my mind was the x-men and\navengers\nand i was thinking of like you know or\nanything in yeah any marvel you know\ncharacter or whatever character it is\nand you think of something like\nwolverine like you know he's got his\nblades coming out of his hands and he's\ngot this healing body but guess what\ncyclops got the laser beam coming out of\nhim and like captain america doesn't\nhave the same things as iron man does\nand iron man doesn't have the same\nthings that spider-man does and\nspider-man doesn't have the same things\nif we're going to dc universe that\nbatman does and i'm like\nbut they're not looking at each other\ngoing oh i wish i could like shoot\nspidey things out they don't care that's\nexactly right brother and this funny\nthing about that is all of us at any\nwe're playing a character yeah at any\ntime you could decide to turn the page\nand write a new chapter in your life and\nbecome a whole new character there just\nbecame a point i'm like you know what i\nam confident i am stronger i i am\nfunnier i just started to step into this\nperson i started to write a new\ncharacter and along those lines i just\ngot to tell you like people say what's\nyour overriding belief about life\ni believe there's a man i was born to be\ni believe there's a man or woman you\nwere born to be it's kind of the\nultimate version of you and i have this\nhallucination no matter what your faith\nlife is that's completely your personal\nbelief but i think at the end of life\nyou're gonna meet that person you were\ncapable of becoming i really do believe\nthat i believe you're introduced to this\nperson the ultimate version of you the\nplaces you could have gone the\ndifferences you could have made the\nmemories you could have had the moments\nof your life and to me bliss heaven if\nyou will is meeting that person and\nwe're identical twins\nand hell and a typical terrible way to\ndie would be to never never be anywhere\nnear close to be total strangers with\nthat person i think about that is this\ndecision is today is meeting you getting\nme closer to being that man i was born\nto be incapable of and it does fill me\nall the time with joy and with a little\nbit pain you said earlier fear i'm not\ngoing to get there and i live every day\nchasing that guy everyone that is ed my\nleft what i mean those are beautiful\nwords\nto come towards the end of our interview\ni wanted to read something to you we\nfound this on your youtube page from a\ncomment from one of your fans and i\nwanted to share it with you because i\nthought it was really really powerful so\nthis person is being an entrepreneur is\nno joke and not for the week we all want\nto be in control of our life time and\nmoney but are we really strong enough to\nweather the storm and believe in\nourselves enough to stick it out and win\ni love the part where ed talks about not\nselling yourself or your family out wow\ni will listen to this over and over and\nshare it with everyone on my team and\neveryone i know\nthank you edmylet for sharing your story\nas it has really touched me to the core\nthis is something that i needed to hear\nand i know that so many others do as\nwell\ni mean you know that feels great yeah i\nmean it sounds like you know i wanted to\nshare that with you because i feel like\nyou know i might we don't always get to\nhear that from someone else and we don't\nget to hear it in a voice because it's a\ncomment sure and i wanted to share that\nwith you because\ni yeah i just want you to recognize just\nhow powerful your work is well thank you\ni believe what he said there with or she\nwhat they were referencing was that\nyou're gonna have to pay a price to win\nin your life yeah there's a price tag\nand when i was poor what do you do when\nyou're you don't have any money because\ni lived a long way that way you\nnegotiate prices all the time you're\nalways flipping the price tag what's the\ncost what's the cost what's the cost so\nmany people live their life in scarcity\nand they're always negotiating the price\nwhat am i paying i'm suffering so much\ni've got to go through this and they\nconstantly are negotiating the price in\ntheir mind and eventually most people do\nis they'll sell their will to win the\nprice will get too high for them to\nchase their dream for them to win\nthere's just a point where they just go\nprice is too high and they make an\nexcuse well it wasn't for me timing\nwasn't right no you sold your family's\ndreams there was a price you weren't\nwilling to pay and for me i just decided\nthere's too much energy drained in\nnegotiating it all the time i've\nnegotiated in advance as long as it's\nlegal ethical and moral i'll pay any\nprice to make\nbliss and happiness for my family and\nthat i'm not for sale my will to win is\nnot for sale and i would just recommend\nall of you negotiate the price now your\nfamily your dreams the people you love\nhow much are they worth to you how\nimportant are they to you how important\nare you to you whatever your faith is\nhow important is your god to you and\nwould you ever sell the price tag on\nthat and as long as you keep that in the\nfront of your mind all the time you have\na chance to achieve anything in your\nlife as long as your will to win is not\nfor sale i love that ed that's beautiful\nwe're going to end with two last\nsegments that we do they're quick\nsegments we've got fill in the blanks so\nyou got to fill in the blanks so i no\nlonger tolerate\ni no longer tolerate\nwhatever you want to fill in the blanket\nno i'll give it to you i no longer\ntolerate fear and worry in my life\nbecause i was a chronic fearful and\nworrying person i no longer tolerate\nthat nice being average will\ndestroy me\nthe last win i celebrated was\nmeeting you today\nthank you man uh the way you get out of\nyour own way is by\nalways coming back to my purpose and my\ncalling in service of other people being\na leader means\nservice of other people again my\nfavorite question to ask someone is\nwell the one question i ask people all\nthe time\nis what do they believe will make them\nmost happy in their life and the\ndiversity of answer man sorry to go\nlonger it just blows my mind at what\npeople tell me i love it i want people\nto be able to use that question when\nthey're out about so i love that you can\ninspire someone today by living\nyour true authentic self don't be afraid\nto be you\nmy favorite self-care practice is to\nmeditate beautiful\ni wasn't a good person when\nmy ego was in front all the time nice\nall right man these are your final five\nso these are\none word answers to one sentence maximum\nokay uh so you did well on that last\nfill in the blanks that was really\neffective actually you're probably one\nof our best for that so here we go\nwhat's something you view as a blessing\ntoday that you initially resisted\nmy baseball injury\nnice\nuh what's your current biggest\ncontribution to the world for you what\ndo you feel\ni have to say brother that what came to\nmy head is my children beautiful i love\nthat yeah i love that all right\nquestion number three\nwhat have you been chasing in your life\nthat you no longer pursue\npersonal\nrecognition from other human beings\ngreat answer great answer okay question\nnumber four what's the biggest lesson\nyou've learned in the last 12 months\ni've learned the power of\nkindness\nand\nthe generosity of human beings is so\nmuch greater than what you might see in\nthe media every single day brother i\nknow that's a long answer\nhuman beings are good human beings are\nkind and it's the exception when people\naren't not the rule i agree and question\nnumber five of your final five when do\nyou throw closest to god\nwhen i'm with my children\nbecause god gave me them but i feel\nclosest to god when i am making a\ndifference in someone else's life\ni feel like he's kind of looking down on\nme going well done\nand when i'm when i'm doing that i feel\nmost close to him\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo\nif you enjoyed it here's another one i\nthink you'll love to say okay it's okay\nto fail because you're going to be loved\nno matter what i had to look at it from\na long term because i wasn't going to\ngive up on the game right so i had to\nsay okay this year i'm gonna get better\nat that\nnext year this and so forth and so on\nand then patiently i was able to catch"
