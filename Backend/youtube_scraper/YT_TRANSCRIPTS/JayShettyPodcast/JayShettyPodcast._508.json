Jay\nShetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou that come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow now this happens now and\nagain but there's someone that I've been\nfollowing admiring from afar and then\nyou see they follow you and you just go\nI need to I want to connect with this\nhuman and I want to get to know them and\nsomeone that when you watch their\ncontent you feel like you already know\nthem and the few moments I've spent with\nher just as she'd been walking into the\nstudio I already felt like I had a\nconnection with her and there's a really\nbeautiful warm hug and just like this\nreally positive feeling but this is\nsomeone who has dominated as an\nentrepreneur being extremely successful\nas a business person an incredible host\nand interviewer someone who is so\nmulti-talented across the board whether\nit's being authentic on camera off\ncamera editing creating I mean the works\nand I'm speaking about the one and only\nAlex Cooper Creator host and executive\nproducer of the hugely successful which\nis an understatement the podcast brand\ncalled call ahead daddy Alex is one of\nthe most listened to female podcasters\nin the world with millions of listeners\nper episodes and Alex continues to break\nall boundaries by shattering stigmas and\nstomping on misogyny all while keeping\nmental health and personal empowerment\nat the Forefront and that's what really\ndrew me into her work was when I started\nto see her talk about mental health and\nwell-being and habits I was just blown\naway and I was like we have to make this\nhappen for our on-purpose community and\nto the millions of devoted gen Z and\nMillennial listeners the daddy gang the\ncoal head which I'm a part of uh the\ncaller daddy brand represents a new set\nof values and standards and in addition\nto Alex has a successful merchandise\nline as well as several exciting\nbusinesses and Endeavors in the pipeline\nwhich I can't wait to discuss Alex\nwelcome to on purpose thank you so much\nfor having me I need to make that like\nmy alarm clock every morning of like\njust like really hype myself up oh my my\nGod you are so good at doing those\nintros no well it's part of like this\nculture that I adopted through living as\na monk and it was just when you met\nsomeone or when you introduced people\nit was always part of the culture to\nlike genuinely feel or with who you're\nin front of and to genuinely take in\nwhat they've done because it a helps you\nfeel more grateful when you're with them\nI feel very grateful to be with you\ntoday I feel more inspired I feel like I\ncan learn I feel curious and I feel\noften at least from the culture I grew\nup in we always played people down like\nwe always kind of like thought oh well\nwe don't want to say this stuff about\nthem but I actually thought you have a\nworse conversation because then you're\nthinking well what do I have to learn\nfrom this person or this person's\nprobably going to be up themselves so\nwhat am I gonna get yeah\nthat's a great concept because I always\nthink I feel like with social media\npeople now everyone Millennial gen Z\neveryone's like we're all egotistical\nand so sometimes you try to downplay\nwhat you're doing but it's actually such\na great concept that you're taking a\ncomplete different spin you're like\nlet's actually embrace our successes and\neverything we're doing and embrace it\nand enjoy it rather than feel shamed and\nlike want to be hush-hush about it or on\nthe other side don't be jealous of some\nsomeone if they're thriving and like\nbecause you can learn from them like I'm\nso excited to sit across from you today\nbecause I'm like Jay Shetty like let's\nget into it because I'm I'm geeking I'm\na huge fan what you're doing is so\nincredible I listen to your podcast and\nI don't listen to many\num but I'm very excited and humbled to\nbe here so thank you oh that's the\nbiggest compliment I had no idea so now\nand now I'm like blushing if you're\nlistening we're both blushing it and I\nhave to tell you this because I just\nlove people knowing this and I really\nappreciate that coming from you but I\nhave a rule that whenever we bring on a\nnew team member not one of the questions\nI ask them in the interview is who would\nyou love as a guest of on purpose like\nwho would that person be but then Helena\nwho's a podcast producer\nit was you and and she was just like\nyeah and I was like she's already\nscheduled I love it daddy gang Daddy\nand so it was just this beautiful\nfeeling where she was like yeah I'd love\nAlex cute and I was like we've already\ngot her schedule she's coming on the\nshow like it's already happening yeah so\nanyway you have a lot of love in our\ncommunity for you thank you uh we're all\nbig fans but but let's dive straight\ninto it get into it for me when I'm\nobserving someone like you looking from\nthe outside in I I think one of the\nthings that fascinates me is like you\nknow what's someone interested in behind\nthe camera I just saw you in Italy uh me\nand my wife were so jealous and fomoing\nbecause we used to go to Italy every\nsummer when we lived in London we were\nboth born and raised in London what was\nyour favorite thing about Italy the food\nthe pasta I have never been I rarely\ntake like big vacations like that and I\nwas so excited to just try the pasta I\ngrew up in Pennsylvania and so you know\nI don't know if we're like running to\nthe fish but Department in Pennsylvania\nyou're like oh what can we eat so it was\nkind of like Italian but it was kind of\nbad Italian sorry to everyone in\nPennsylvania and so but I've always\nloved carbs and I was an athlete so I'm\nlike when I get there it was breakfast\nlunch dinner pasta let's go dessert\npasta let's go so it was amazing but um\nwe went to the Amalfi Coast that was\nbeautiful I just felt so fortunate to be\nthere and it was it was incredible yeah\nI love that yeah I was genuinely living\nthrough your stories and I was just like\noh I want to go back I want to go back\nso we're planning next year amazing but\neveryone from the US felt like they were\nin Italy this summer everyone I know\nevery single person on my Instagram was\nin Italy so I was like okay great I'm\ngoing this is the first year I won't\nhave fomo because I always see people in\nthese places like Ibiza or you know\nMykonos and I've never been any of those\nplaces and I was like this year I'm\ngoing to Italy and I'm doing it and it\nwas it was amazing one of the things I\nlove about you in person that I'm\nobserving is that you're so warm like\nfrom the moment you walked in so warm\nlike you know I love it when I always\nwhen someone gets out their car and they\narrive at my home they first thing I\nwant to do is hug them then when I when\nI see that same energy I'm like this is\nawesome but one of the things people\nobserve about you online is that you're\nconfident you're very confident on the\npodcast you're you're very confident in\nyour stories which is a beautiful\nquality with young Alex confident too I\nknow we heard we've heard about like you\ngrew up in front of the camera with your\nfather and like you know so was\nconfidence always easy for you and how\nis your journey with confidence evolved\nand the answer is no\num absolutely not I it's actually been\ninteresting because the past year I've\nreally started to get into this in\ntherapy with my therapist and I haven't\nreally like I've I think I've mentioned\nit a couple times to the daddy gang but\nI don't talk about it a lot because I'm\nstill kind of going through it in\ntherapy when I was younger I had a\nreally hard time in school\nnot grades wise you know I was a solid B\nlet's throw it out there maybe I tried a\nlittle harder we could have gotten to\nmaze but I was severely bullied for my\nlooks I was super super skinny people\nmade fun of me said that like I looked\nlike I had an eating disorder I had\nawful awful acne to the point where like\nI would beg my parents to like let me\nstay home from school and I was it was\nso bad and I turned inward a lot like I\nnever wanted my parents to know that I\nwas going through it because I was\nashamed it's embarrassing to not be able\nto connect with your peers and also to\nbe I was physically bullied like the\nboys would be like let's play a game her\nlegs are so tiny like if we trip her\nthey will snap in half and like it was\nawful and I never really talked about it\nbut what got me through it actually was\nmy dad works in sports and he's a\nproducer and I remember at like seven\nyears old he handed me a camera and was\nlike go make something\nand so my escape from\nreally hate like I hated everything\nabout myself I hated my my skin my face\nmy hair my teeth my body my torso my\nlegs like I could pinpoint every single\nthing about myself that I hated and it\nwas almost Everything Exterior wise but\ninside I knew I was a good person I knew\nI was a good daughter I knew I was a\ngood friend but I felt like it was all\nbased on looks of why I was getting\nbullied so I turned to creating content\nthat's what I was my escape and I would\ngo in my basement and I would make music\nvideos or I would write scripts and make\nlike little short films or silent films\nand I would put on wigs and put on\noutfits and makeup and it was the first\ntime that I truly felt safe like I could\nbe fully myself meanwhile I was fully\nalone so I'm like I'm like a weirdo in\nmy basement but it was that and soccer\nspecifically I played extremely\ncompetitive soccer and I realized why I\ngot I felt so safe also and seen in\nsoccer because it was all women can you\nscore a goal like what are you doing so\nwhat do you bring to the team you know\nso I I don't talk about that a lot\nbecause it was actually interesting\nI recently was interviewed by the New\nYork Times and I don't do a lot of\ninterviews I read that\num and it was in a follow-up\nconversation we had like an hour and a\nhalf interview\nthe reporter asked to do a follow-up and\nsomehow we got on the topic of my\nchildhood and he and I started talking\nand I shared with him that I had been\nbullied\nand quite literally physically his\ndemeanor his fate like his jaw dropped\nand I could tell he was shocked and\neverything that prior that hour and a\nhalf interview I first did with him kind\nof was shattered because he was like\nwait what like you were bullied and I\nrealized something that moment was like\nthe character I've created on call her\ndaddy there's this dichotomy of for me\nthe girl that was bullied and then the\ngirl I've created or the woman I've\ncreated in the show but I think a lot of\npeople have a hard time because everyone\nwants to put things in boxes\nunderstanding like there's no way Alex\nCooper The Confident color daddy girl\ncould have also been bullied when she\nwas younger and what I've come to\nrealize in therapy is actually that\nugly awkward acne girl is who started\ncall her daddy because if I had not gone\nthrough that there's no way I would have\nstarted call her daddy I remember\nreading um Malcolm gladwell's uh\noutliers and it was like you've got to\nhave 10 000 hours to even be considered\nan expert by eighth grade I was\nconsidered an expert in editing I was\nlike obsessed with creating content and\nso that's kind of a little bit of my\nstory where I definitely struggle\nsometimes to open up about it because\nI'm also aware on the internet sometimes\npeople like you're lying that's not true\nand it's it's I think it's hard for me\nbecause it's still so raw like I still\nhaven't even fully gone there in therapy\nthat I don't talk about it a lot because\nI don't want to be dismissed or\nquestioned over something that is so\npersonal and still really hard for me to\ntalk about I guess yeah yeah well I want\nto thank you for\ntrusting us and and me and being\nvulnerable but also talking about the\ncomplexity of vulnerability I think we\nthink we live at a time when if someone\nis vulnerable that everyone's response\nwill be like oh you know all a people\nthink that's why someone's doing it B if\nthey don't think then they think you're\njust being vulnerable sometimes it's\ncomplex to say well maybe it wasn't that\nhard as someone's making it out and then\nthere's a third where it's like well can\nwe just listen to someone's experience\nand recognize that I think if all of us\nreflect like I just realized we have so\nmuch in common which I had no idea and\nif you looked at it from the outside I\ndon't think people would think we have\nmuch in common at all which is partly\nwhy I love conversations like this\nbecause I'm like these are the\nconversations that bring me to life so I\nalways believed for being overweight\ngrowing up I was obese growing up and so\nwas my wife actually and so separately\nwe didn't know each other at the time\nbut we were both bullied for being\noverweight I was bullied for being\nIndian because there weren't many Indian\nkids in my school and so the color of my\nskin and all the rest of us bullied for\nthat and I wasn't the coolest kid in\nschool I was a straight A student so I\nwas the opposite and it was like and it\nwas considered dorky to be smart where\nespecially where I grew up and so I\ndealt with all of that too and so when\nI'm hearing you say that I was beaten up\nat school regularly my mom used to come\ndefend me in school like that was really\nembarrassing like and even now when\npeople are like no way like and I'm like\nno that was my entire childhood and for\nme I turned to listening to Eminem and\nwriting music so I did a lot of spoken\nword I used to produce music it's why I\nlove word and language and and just the\nArtistry of what you can do with words\nand then when you said\nyou played soccer which I which I know\nbut I'm like that is my first love like\nif I could be anything in the world it\nwould be a professional soccer player\nlike Beyond everything that is crazy to\nhear because I agree with you and that\nis why I love podcasting and why I love\nyour show my show is like you really\nhave no idea what one you can connect\nwith someone on empathize with someone\non or just like learn about them and I\nfeel like we've gotten to a point where\nwe want to like discredit and call\npeople out and it's it's scary to be\nopen and vulnerable on the internet and\nI think like almost my Persona there was\nparts of me that I had to like try to\nclaw back what I started for color Daddy\nbecause I was like hold on I need to\nalso like there's other parts to me\nother than the salacious wild crazy and\nI it was a great transition for me which\nI know we'll get to but the bullying\nthing when you're that young and truly\nall that matters is peer acceptance and\nyou feel so\nalone you hate yourself and I realized\nrecently like I know my Persona is one\nthing and that's why I always struggle\nwith this I'm like oh I gotta like ease\nmy listeners into like me talking about\nthis because it's a complete different\nside of myself but we all have that\nright we all have those things like I\nremember the first time I shared this\nwith my mother was when I was 21 years\nold in a cab that I had been bullied and\nI told her mom\nin high school I used to put on three\npairs of leggings tape it to my leg and\nthen put on my school pants just to hope\nthat everyone would think my legs were\nbigger wow and by the time I would have\nsoccer practice after school my like my\njoints were in so much pain from sitting\nin class and I told my mom this quite\nliterally as we're pulling up to Penn\nStation she was getting out and I was\ngonna keep going I told her this as\nshe's getting out of the cab and she's\nlike Alex like what and it was my\ndefense mechanism of like I don't really\nwant to talk about it but I need to let\nmy mom know what I was going through\nwhen I look back thank God I had my\nfather has been the most supportive\nperson in my life with my career and I'm\nso grateful for that like he any moment\nI needed anything he was like let's go\nfind you I want to make a green screen\nin the basement and he's like let's go\nto Joanne Fabrics like here we go let's\ngo to Home Depot like let's go lights\nlike it was I was so fortunate to be\nraised by people who support me but I\nalso realized I had these like people\npleasing tendencies because and I still\ncatch myself doing it in media like I\njust want to be liked because of my\nchildhood because of feeling left out\nand it's hard and I think comparison\nlike my best friend was the beautiful\ndoll baby perfect girl that I wanted to\nbe and it's like there's so many\nremedies I tried to look up um on Google\nwhen I was younger of like how to how to\nlike fix your skin and how to make your\nlegs look better bigger and is there a\nprocedure and it was like I just can't\nbelieve how much I hated myself but I\ntruly don't believe I would be sitting\nhere if I hadn't gone through that\nbecause I think that's the thing like\nyou just said you had no idea what I\nwent through right why I feel like I am\nhalf decent at my job is when I sit down\nwith people there is this empathetic\nside to me that yeah maybe I don't need\nto talk about because I don't think I\nneed to prove anything to anyone as to\nwhy I'm a good friend why I'm a good\ndaughter and partner but like it really\ndoes come from feeling so alone and\nisolated and hating yourself that in\nthose moments when I'm in my basement\nmaking and creating I had to find a way\nto love myself because\nI found like this journal of mine when I\nwas younger oh my God it's so sad and it\nwas like really dark thoughts\nof like what if I did this would then\nthe kids would feel so awful and it's\nlike whoa\nI was really alone when I was younger\nand I I never talked about it and I had\na friend recently that shared similar\nThoughts with me we were best friends\nand I had no idea what she was going\nthrough and she had no idea what I was\ngoing through so it's\nit's just like a reminder of like we\nreally don't know and I know that's such\nan over said thing but you have no idea\nwhat people are going through and\num I think especially with social media\nwe can make judgments especially snap\njudgments you see a headline you see a\npicture but like we have no idea what\npeople are going through yeah absolutely\nI couldn't agree with you more and I\nlove the point that you're making that\nand I think everyone has it through some\nway whether it was your parents whether\nit was your friends whether it was your\npeers there was someone who made you\nfeel less than in your childhood\ninadequate incomplete and now we're all\nin our creative and Endeavors seeking\nthat completion through whatever role\ncharacter whatever it may be and I think\npeople forget that half the time the\nmost successful\npeople who do the most incredible things\ndid them because they had this huge gap\nin hole to fill and the world needed to\nfill that hole in gap absolutely only\nthen to realize that that doesn't work\neither right to then have to go the\nother way but sorry you're going to say\nsomething no I I agree with you it's\nlike there's there's a reason I'm so\npassionate and interested in what I'm\ndoing it's because like I love\nconnecting with people I love learning\nabout people because I know that the\ndichotomy of call her daddy girl first\nugly awkward acne girl it's like you you\ndon't expect it and you don't really\nunderstand it until I fully explain it\nwhich I know I haven't explained yet but\nit's it's when I sit down with people\nyou I love learning about people because\nwe're all going through such similar\nthings it may look different it may feel\na little bit different but depression\nanxiety\num happiness love joy whatever emotion\nlike we are all human beings and we we\ngenuinely actually all can connect we\nevery single person can connect on at\nleast one thing in the world and so I\nfeel like we've kind of lost that along\nthe way and I I hope I think with shows\nlike ours like I hope it brings a little\nbit of that authentic nature back\nbecause\nwe're looking past like what could be\ninside of someone we're just looking on\nthe surface level and that to me is a\nnightmare because when I was younger I\ndidn't want anyone to just take me by my\nlooks because then I wouldn't be given\nthe time of day yeah it's incredible to\nhear that I was literally having the\nsame conversation I was with one of my\nclients this morning and we were talking\nabout this and he was saying how\nunrelatable his life has become now\nthrough his success and everything that\nhe's gone through\nand I looked at him and I I was talking\nto him and I said to him that you know\nI'll be honest with you that whether\nsomeone's rich or not famous or not if\nsomeone goes through a breakup\na breakup hurts the same because none of\nthe other stuff is medicine like none of\nthe other stuff is the cure so whether\nyou have Fame and status and wealth or\nwhether you don't if you go through a\nbreakup if you lose a parent if you lost\nyour job like or you missed out on\nopportunity there is a similar amount of\nexperience human pain that you go\nthrough and I think what you're saying\nis really interesting though like I\nthink you're talking about that time\npeople always often ask like oh what\nadvice would you give to your younger\nself with you I'm more interested in\nlike what do you think your younger self\nwould say to you now like if that acne\ngirl like saw you now as you described\nuh what would she say what would she\nthink if younger me only knew like Alex\nyou're you're gonna make it you're gonna\nlike your dreams are gonna come true\nlike you're gonna get out of this\num I remember one of the boys I went to\nmiddle school with that bullied me ended\nup going to my college and at that point\nI had a little glow up KJ and uh he was\nwas like trying to hit on me and and\ngiving me all this attention and it it\nonly made me just feel actually awful\nbecause I was like I'm the same person\nI'm the same exact person if if not like\nmore grown and obviously experienced and\nhave a little bit more of a higher IQ at\nthis point in my life but I'm the same\nperson to my core and you're only\ntreating me differently because I got a\nprescription for Accutane got some hair\ndye got my braces off put on some muscle\nbecause I'm playing soccer like it's\nquite literally just the physical as to\nwhy you're you're acting differently\ntowards me I think my younger self would\nlook at my older self and would not even\nbelieve it probably\nI actually was thinking like what would\nI say to someone that's younger and\ngoing through this and it's like there's\nnothing of like walking to school that\nday and stand up for yourself it's\nactually like find yourself in your\nalone moments because you're all you\nhave truly and so trying to get peer\napproval short it may make the moment a\nlittle bit easier but like these people\ndon't actually matter they matter to me\nto my core of who they've made me their\nimpact on my my childhood and making me\nhate myself like it's so crazy I always\nthink about before\nI would say about before like fifth or\nsixth grade we're so innocent you have\nno almost concept of even what you truly\nlook like or or your peer dynamic or oh\nboys are looking at me and I don't have\nboobs yet and my friend does and so\nthey're I'm not on their top five and I\nknow it sounds so you know just dumb and\nbut it's so means so much when you're\nthat young so I look back and it's like\nthose years where you start especially\nto be judged for what you look like when\nwe're actually just trying to figure out\ninside who we are it's so problematic I\ndefinitely think that it affected me of\nwhat I I put then I did put emphasis on\nmy looks I can talk about that in\ntherapy now like\nhating every single thing about myself\nof course I was like I want to go bleach\nmy hair I want to be the girl that I saw\non the magazines and then I did all of\nthat and I even looked back at pictures\nof myself when I took it way too far but\nit was all just for me to try to feel\nlike the women that I thought had it all\nbecause if they looked a certain way\nI guess I would just tell my also I\nwould tell my son younger self like keep\ngoing down in that basement it sounds\ncreepy guys my basement was like\nfinished don't worry and leaning into\nyour craft because in the darkest of\nmoments creating content\nactually\nformed who I am and gave me the strength\nto keep going and it made me a full\nwhole individual in my own right and\nwhen I was getting bullied and when I\nwas going through those Hard Times\nrealizing I'm gonna turn my passion into\nmy purpose\nthat's all I needed to be like okay\nlet's keep going\nso it I was really fortunate to find\nthat at a young age but I think a lot of\npeople do when you're at a young age and\nyou are going through something so hard\nyou find that outlet right and everyone\nhas that one thing that like I love this\nand I'm I'm just fortunate enough to\nhave made that into my career Alex I\nlove listening to you like I am just so\nhappy right now because I'm like what\nwe're hearing and I love what you said\nearlier that you're in therapy right now\nyou're working through this and so you\nhaven't shared so much of this but I'm\njust hearing so much coherence and so\nmuch Clarity and it's so beautiful like\nhearing someone who's gone through so\nmuch pain so much stress and yes\nexternally there's the success but then\nto hear the what's happening internally\nand you've just reminded me of a moment\nof my life I'm just I remember being at\nthe final year of elementary school or\nprimary school as we call it in London\nand there was one girl that everyone\nfancied in class and I I fancied it too\nlike she was the cutest girl in school\nwe're like 11 years old so whatever cute\nmeans at 11. I I think it was the first\ntime I'd ever like liked a girl in like\nin that way I come late to school one\nday and everyone's looking at me weird\nlike everyone's really looking at me\nreally strange and everyone's laughing\nand some of the girls like in the corner\nlike laughing and pointing and I'm\nthinking what what happened like what\ndid I miss out on I can't remember I was\nlike maybe doctor's appointment whatever\nthen I found out that all the guys who\nequally fancied this girl had told the\ngirls that I fancied her so not anyone\nelse knew apart from just me and I was\nconsidered the\nugliest fattest kid in school and so now\nshe knew this all her friends were\nlaughing and then the rest of that day\nthey all stood I used to be a goalkeeper\nbecause I wasn't very athletic at the\ntime I used to be a gold and goalkeepers\nare very athletic so no no offense to go\ngivers at least at that time when you're\na kid in school it's okay Jake yeah I'm\njust like yeah you know all right guys\nwe gotta clarify just being clear just\nbeing clear I think goalkeepers are very\ndamage the hair all the way I'm in goal\nand all the girls are standing behind\nthe goal and they're just like they're\nlike Jay you can never get her I can't\nbelieve you thought it she's out of your\nleague and they're literally the whole\nday throughout the playground like every\ntime we're playing football soccer\nthey're just behind the goal like making\nfun of me and it's such a like no it\nmakes me memory it makes me honestly\nbecause I think it's it's interesting I\neven watch you we can smile through it\nnow but like it honestly makes me want\nto cry when I think about it because\neven hearing that like I can picture\nthat happening to you because I it\nhappened to me and it's so traumatizing\nwhen that happens to you and you\nliterally are just fighting back tears\nand you're like just get through it just\nget through it and all you want to do is\ngo home and it makes you hate\ninteracting it makes you nervous you get\nreally like clammed up and it's it's\nawful like I remember when I was in um\nuh Middle School also like my teachers I\nwent to Catholic School\nand I just like never thought I belonged\nin Pennsylvania yeah I was like what am\nI doing here like I just it I knew I\nwanted to do something that was\ndefinitely like big but I also knew this\nis a very conservative town and we were\nshamed for anything regarding anything\nbecause it's Catholic and I remember we\nweren't allowed to wear makeup and I was\nbreaking out so bad like it was so awful\nthis week\nand it was Final so I couldn't skip\nschool like I would beg my mom to let me\nskip school and she thank God to my\nmother would see when I was really\nstruggling would be like okay you can\nstay home I put a tiny bit of concealer\nover some of my acne because I would sit\nnext to this kid that was like the\ncoolest kid in school and he I would\nalways be so upset because he got to see\nthat side of my face\nand in front of the entire class\nmy teacher I want to call her out Mrs G\nI'll just say okay I'm like getting\nthere um she comes over to the entire\nclass and looks at me goes Alex you're\nwearing face makeup go to the bathroom\nand wash it off she escorted me into the\nbathroom made me rub my skin raw in a\nschool bathroom no soap just water\nscrubbing it off my face was so red and\nI remember just being like can I can I\ngo to the bathroom she's like no get\nback to class and I just trying to hold\nback tears and my entire face was\ninflamed and I was like so now I'm not\neven experiencing bullying from kids\nlike this is like how does this teacher\nnot know and she has kids so it was like\nit was a lot but I will say\nit made me who I am today I look back\nand I'm like had I not gone through all\nof that like I said earlier I know who I\nam now I didn't back then I was trying\nto figure it out but I know who I am now\nand I know my morals and my values and I\nknow that a lot of that stems from the\npain that I went through and I am a very\nempathetic person\num maybe I don't show that a lot on my\nshow but but I I think it's it's all\nrelative I'm like oh if I could go back\nwould I redo it no maybe I would have\nwish I told my parents a little bit more\num but still I think it made me really\nturn inward and that created a different\nlevel of strength and self-reliance that\nlike I can't even put into words so that\nis such a powerful point I mean you've\nmade so many amazing points that I'm\ngoing to be drawing together for Allah\nlisteners at the end but like that is\nsuch a powerful point that I think and\nand I don't wanna\ntell people to go either way but there's\na different strength that comes from\ngoing inward than than the strength\nthat's required from asking other people\nfor help and both strengths are\nimportant like going out and knowing to\nask your mom or your dad or your best\nfriend for help is extremely important\nbut knowing how to go and ask yourself\nfor help internally is equally important\nI think that is such a beautiful Point\nI've never heard it been put that way\nthank you and and I love that idea of\nbecause I feel the same way I felt so\nisolated and alone and even today when I\nfeel that way sometimes but now it's\nbecome solitude it's become a strength\nbecause I've got used to depending on\nmyself and and I know what that feels\nlike when I'm like I'm all I have and I\nknow what that feels like so now it\ndoesn't scare me totally whereas at 12\nor 13 or 14 it really did I think one of\nthe things we're talking about is an\nevolution and identity and awareness and\nthis has been something that I've\nstruggled with as things have become\nmore public as well because\nso I went from being that kid that was\nbullied\nto being fairly in with the cool kids in\nhigh school to then going to college and\nbeing\na budding spiritualist like my college\nlife if anyone met me at College they'd\nbe like Jay was like nice and loving and\nspiritual and and mindful and all these\nthings that I was practicing if you\nspoke to my high school friends it'd be\nlike Jay was a party animal he drank too\nmuch he was crazy like he was the class\nclown like he tormented teachers like\nthat was my reputation and so you get\nthis complete dichotomy and I feel like\nevery transition my external life took I\nsaw it as an opportunity to become who I\nwanted to be so as I left High School I\nwanted to become this mindful thoughtful\nindividual and that's what I was at\ncollege and then I went off to be a monk\nwhich was a whole different external\nidentity left that and now obviously\ndoing all of this for the past few years\nand and so many more in between but the\npoint is that\nI've given myself permission to accept\nthat I am the same and different person\nall at the same time so beautiful right\nlike and I've given myself that\npermission even when other people\nhaven't and I feel like I'm constantly\ngoing through that where I did used to\nbe a monk I'm not now I'm married I have\na home I have businesses I have money\nlike so life has changed but there are\nparts of being a monk that are still me\nI they're still there I still think like\na monk and there's parts of my lifestyle\nthat are still like among they're posted\nor not so coming back to you you've also\nbeen on an evolution of identities we've\njust talked about a very clear one you\nthen have the beginning of the podcast\nwhich is very well documented it's all\nthere I I don't want to dive into it and\nthat part of the Journey's there and\nthen now it becomes another label where\nit's like Spotify 60 like it just it\nbecomes so like diluted to a number and\na brand uh and you can go wherever you\nwant to go with this but the question\nI'm asking is what has been the hardest\npart of that Evolution for you to where\nyou are now and what do you think people\nmisinterpret about that Evolution it is\ndifficult because I feel especially as a\nwoman in the industry\nI have to tiptoe on not being overly\nconfident like I think women can all\nfeel it don't be too much of this always\nVeer on the side of just be quiet well\nI've got a podcast that's a little bit\ndifficult right so I I definitely have\nstruggled with the person and who I've\nbecome is confident and I want to embody\nthis confident and determined\nbadass CEO running my life that any\nwoman could do what I'm doing right in\nwhatever aspect they want to do it in\ntheir life and whatever their passion is\nbut it is difficult when that I walk\ninto board meetings or meetings with\nthese men that and I'm like I'm telling\nyou what I want and I feel like if a man\nwas sitting here it would be a very\ndifferent conversation if anything he'd\nbe going light and so I've struggled\nwith\nwhy am I always called the female Joe\nRogan does anyone compare say oh Joe\nRogan's the male Alex Cooper no we have\nsimilar numbers we've really loyal\naudiences we both are with Spotify like\nand I know shade to Joe I'm actually\njust saying it's frustrating that it is\na de-qualifier it's it's putting me\ncomparing me it's not even comparing me\nthey're just saying like oh she's\nbasically him but like as a woman I\ndon't want to be compared to anyone and\nI don't it's been hard for me to\ndo it in a way that yeah I'm not coming\noff as like angry and mad and I think\nthere has been times where I feel like\nI can't be\nall in business mode at times as I want\nto be because I'm as a woman gonna be\nlabeled and it's like no I actually just\nknow what I want and I'm a boss and I am\nrunning a huge company and I have so\nmuch going on and I don't want to waste\nanyone's time and I know what I want\nwhat a concept so I think I think that\nis something that people have\nmisinterpreted also on the internet of\nlike oh she comes off so like I don't\nknow if I don't even know if it's\naggressive like I think as a woman\nespecially even if I don't know what I\nwant pretend I know what I want because\nwe're at a time where as we've seen in\nthe world we are not equal to men we\ndon't have autonomy over our bodies and\nso it for me using my platform right now\nto be like let me be the boldest I can\nbe even if people are a little taken\naback it I hope it just helps other\nwomen be like I'm gonna go in today and\nadvocate for myself to my boss or I'm\ngonna stand up to that per because it's\nlike we're getting nowhere if we don't\nkeep shoving it forward a little bit and\nI I've gotten at times a little nervous\nand I'm like I could just sit and do my\ninterviews and stay quiet but that's not\nfor who I've been I've always had an\nopinion I'm a Leo okay I know what I\nwant\num but it is hard because it's it's like\nuh I think there's a lot of people that\nare a little skeptical of a really and I\nhate when people say loud am I talking\nthat loud no people like she's so loud\nI'm like am I loud or am I just speaking\nabout something that maybe you don't\nwant to hear because you don't like\nchange and we need change so that's\nsomething that I'm currently working on\na therapy I don't think I've ever done\nI'm about to clap on the podcast I don't\nthink I've ever done this but any now\nI'm just gonna clap I'm gonna take a\nmoment to go out and there should be\nmore people copying Jordan I need\nsomeone come on hold on there there we\ngo oh my God\nI no I I and I'm and I've genuinely\nnever we've never done that podcast ever\nlike that's the only time the first time\nthat we're done uh I really mean that\neverything you just said like it's so\ntrue I'm totally aligned with you I can\nonly look at it from the perspective\nthat I grew up with a Powerhouse mom who\nuh worked cooked raised me and my\nyounger sister provided for us both when\nmy dad was figuring his life out\num my mom was the breadwinner in the\nhouse she was the one who helped me with\nmy homework she taught me how to shave\nlike like that's literally who my mom\nwas in my life and so I grew up seeing\nthe most powerful woman in the world in\nmy opinion as a young boy and like my\nmom would take me to all the meetings at\nnight whatever whatever needed to happen\nand then I was kind of like an older\nlike a father figure to my younger\nsister and so I've seen it in her too\nand I've seen like the stuff she's gone\nthrough at work and wherever it may be\nso I can only empathize from that\nperspective but when I'm listening to\nyou speak I'm just like\nit's sad that we're still there like it\nit just pains me I'm like how can we\nstill be there and how can we still be\nstuck there and I want to dive into the\nthe gender part with you because I do\nthink it's it's important that we talk\nabout it here\nI deal with that in a different way and\nI've never talked about this either but\nI I feel like we're both yeah yeah and\nit's also like I feel understood with\nyou and I also know that you are because\nyou interview and you do such an\nexceptional job with it it's like I feel\nlike I'm getting to like open up my\nheart together I'm like opening up my\nheart to you but no I mean in the sense\nof so I often get perceived as like well\nJay you're a monk and you're mindful so\nyou're not allowed to be driven and\nambitious so if I have goals in a\nbusiness meeting or a PR meeting or\nwhatever it may be it's like oh but Jay\nlike you shouldn't have goals right I'm\nlike\nyeah can I not be both am I not allowed\nto be both like and so people are\nconstantly like but Jay like and and\nit's like if if we reach for something\nand I've you know I come from a\nbackground of a straight A's I worked in\nthe corporate world I'm highly organized\nI'm a high performer It comes naturally\nto me and that's me and then I was a\nmonk and I have the the meditative side\nand I meditative two hours a day and I\nwake up early and take cold showers and\nall that kind of stuff but it's like to\nme I've tried to put both together to\ncreate this real world because neither\none makes me happy without the other so\nI get the perception of well Jay how can\nyou be mindful and driven how can you be\nambitious and meditate how can and I'm\nlike but that's what we should be\nencouraging people to be like I feel\nlike it's because we have gotten so\ncomfortable putting things in boxes and\nI love that you're saying that because\nit reminds me this is I think such a\nrelatable topic take me and my deal and\nmy podcast and being a public figure out\nof it you mentioned something about how\nyou have these different stages of your\nlife and I feel like it's so normal and\nhealthy honestly to progress and almost\nbe different people of your versions of\nyourself and try things out I remember\nin high school when I was a little bit\nmore now secure with my looks okay and I\nwas now The Jock I was on the soccer\nteam I was a freshman I was thriving\nwith my soccer girls they were like big\non campus and I was still obsessed with\nmaking content right\nI was so embarrassed that I was in the\nvideo production class because people my\nvideo production Professor God bless him\nhe was I guess people would consider\nlike a little nerdy and a little too\ntechy and I was like I am so honored to\nbe his student and a teacher like have\nhim teach me he would we would watch\nmovies after class and like not in a\ncreepy way um but he was educating me on\nfilm and before me too we would watch\nAlfred Hitchcock I remember the first\ntime he showed me psycho and so I was\nlearning but I lied to my peers because\nso my mom I convinced my mom please can\nwe go in and talk to the dean of\nstudents I want to do video production\nfor all four years as my elective I\nnever took Health which is interesting\nnever learned about sex education okay\nso interesting\num but I remember people being like why\nare you in that video production class\nfor all four years this is so weird and\nI was embarrassed and I lied and I was\nlike I don't know like they think I'm\ngood at it so like uh whatever I don't\nhave to take Health at least like\nwhatever I downplayed it I was so\npassionate I loved it more than soccer\nit was my literally my existence it felt\nlike that is why I'm here this is what\nI'm meant to do but I was so embarrassed\nbecause I couldn't be a jock and also a\ntech girl sort of like a tech geek or\nwhatever they would call me and so I\ntried to hide that part of myself and I\nfeel like a lot of people do that even\nhearing you say that like why can't you\nbe mindful and also determined and it's\nlike I actually think that is the such a\nbeautiful human being when you can\ncombine all the different parts of\nyourself to all be in a somewhat\ncohesive working situ situation it works\nso much better for your mental health we\nshouldn't all just be narrow-minded we\nshouldn't just have one thing that we're\nfocused on are you do you have a\nrelationship are you a good friend you\ndon't act like you're to your romantic\npartner like you do to your friend what\nabout are you a good son a daughter like\nit all is in the scheme of being humans\nwe have to have multi-dimensional parts\nof ourselves but something about\nbeing in a box it doesn't work Jay if\nyou're both of those because it can't be\ntrue well why not and I think just\ntalking about it anyone listening you\nshould not Veer away from a passion\nbecause it doesn't align with something\nother publicly that you're doing because\nit's like almost a contradiction I love\na contradiction I that is what I do on\nmy show they're like well you said this\nlast week I changed my mind this week\nand not in like a okay Alex well we\ncan't believe anything you say but\nthings change and things shift but we\nhave to be cognizant of how we're\nembracing different parts of ourselves\nbecause if we try to not do that and\njust stay in one lane we're not going to\ngrow we're not going to be happy with\nourselves and we're just going to be\nappeasing the people around us instead\nof what do we want I appreciate you\nsharing that because I think it's a\nreally relatable thing of like how can I\nbe both of course you can be both it's\njust Society has made us feel like well\nyou're a poser you can't be both which\none isn't as true they're both true I'm\nabout to clap again\nno I'm just I I hope it's okay like I\ndon't know I'm I'm opening up because I\njust feel like the stuff we're talking\nabout is is relatable in different ways\nright like I don't know what it feels\nlike to be a woman in the industry I\nnever will I will never be able to be\nlike I get that I totally know what you\nmean but I I get what I'm feeling in the\nsame expression of sometimes I feel\ntold to be quiet sometimes I feel told\nto be like well Jay you shouldn't have\nthat desire like I'm told to like calm\ndown sometimes uh not because I'm\naggressive in any way but in the sense\nof just because I'm a driven ambitious\nperson so going back to what you were\nsaying earlier there's a part of it\nwhere\nit sounds like especially and I love\nwinter like it's not about it's not\nabout what Joe's doing it's not about\nwhat anyone's doing it's just why does\neverything have to be a comparison and\nthat then starts to be a respect issue\nright it starts to be an issue in like\nare we giving enough respect to what\nyou've achieved and what you've built in\nthe same way as I'll be giving respect\nto anyone else for what they've achieved\nand what they've built what has been\nyour relationship like with respect it's\nhard because there's a couple Dimensions\nto it right my listeners quite literally\nand I know this sounds corny but like\ntruly feel like an extension of myself\nlike we have an understanding we have\ntalked about the most\ndeep in depth maybe taboo topics\nuncomfortable topics and I'm when I meet\nthe daddy gang shout out everyone\nlistening to Saturday game when I meet\nthe daddying out in person I always joke\nbecause whenever I'm with anyone they\ncome up to me they're like oh my God\nAlex I'm like hi what's up\nand they're like okay and they start\ntalking and the person that's with me\nthat's my friend or my parent or\nwhatever they're like oh who is that\nfrom college or high school I'm like no\nthat's daddy gang like wait how did wait\nyou guys just started talking about her\nbreak like what we have this\nunderstanding of like if you listen to\ncall her daddy and I'm sure you have\nthat with your audience like you build\nsuch a rapport the respect I have for\nthe daddy gang and my listeners and\npeople that give me a chance it is so\nmutual and it is so beautiful and I I\ncan't still to this day believe what has\nbeen built of caller Daddy and the daddy\ngang and my relationship with them and\ntheirs with me\nI think where it becomes a little bit of\na struggle is in the beginning of call\nher daddy\nit was this beautiful storm right a\nfemale-led podcast working at Barstool\nSports which people are like oh is that\na misogynistic company it was like\nactually The Perfect Storm of like Oh\nI'm a woman and I'm gonna have the\nbiggest show at Barstool Sports Watch Me\ndance okay and it was like this really\ncool challenge\nbut I think because of the nature of the\ncontent at the beginning of call her\ndaddy it it's difficult because I am in\nno way shape or form I wouldn't change\none thing about the beginning of that\nshow it was so provocative and in your\nface and women needed it at the time it\nwas like oh instead of because I think\nthe feminist movement has had many\ndifferent forms right it continues to\nchange and evolve and at that point as\nsomeone who had just graduated college I\nwas everyone can be a feminist right and\nyou can have a different version of how\nyou associate it with it but as long as\nyou believe in the quality of the Sexes\nboom okay and you respect women great\nbut for me it was like if men can say it\nto us let's say it right back\nand they're not gonna like it and it's\ngonna be really uncomfortable but let's\ngo for it and I think a lot of people\nloved it no I know a lot of people loved\nit the show blew up and it was\ncontroversial and it was amazing my\nstruggle was being so proud of what I\nbuilt but also we just talked about that\nbox of like\nbut I kind of want to talk about other\nstuff too yeah and I felt like I got\npigeonholed into this like that's the\ngirl that talks about sex and dating and\nit was really difficult for me to\nrespect and acknowledge what had been\nbuilt and and it was it is like\nbrilliant What call her Daddy original\ndays was\nbut I also now I'm 28 and I started it\nat 22 23. I don't want to be the same\nperson I was at 22. I'm not I have a\ndifferent outlook on life I have a\ngreater interest in what's happening in\nthe world\num in making a difference are you\nkidding me out of 22 I was like let's\ndrink Let's Talk About Sex and let's\nhave fun and that was so and that's what\nyou should be doing right at that age\nyeah yeah but now as I've tried to\ntransition the show not because and I\nwant to clarify no one has told me to do\nthis I made the decision because two\nthings happened in the pandemic I think\nwhen you talk about something like sex\nand people are so freaked out by that\nconcept and and a little nervous to I\nremember back in the day engage with the\nbrand because it was like oh they\ntalking about sex\nthat is one of the most intimate topics\nthat you can really talk about and a\nuniversally inclusive topic right we all\nthink about it in some capacity right I\nfelt like if I can talk that deeply and\nthat openly and that vulnerably on this\nplatform to millions of people still in\ntherapy about that why was I so okay\ndoing that we're working on it okay but\nthe point is is if I can do that my\naudience was ready when the pandemic hit\nwe need you to talk about some other\nstuff because none of us are enjoying\nour sex life right now but we trust you\nenough Alex let's have deeper\nconversations and that is when I began\ntalking about mental health and that is\nwhen I opened up and acknowledged I'm in\ntherapy and the stigma around therapy to\nI know a lot of people is what's wrong\nwith you my mother is a psychologist I\ngrew up where mental health was the\nnumber one prerequisite in the house of\nhow's your mental health what's going on\nin your head where are you at\nso I think that transition for call her\ndaddy for me felt so organic it was like\nof course we gotta talk about more stuff\nit's like eventually you graduate from\nhigh school you got to go to college or\nalgebra one we go to algebra two like\ncall her daddy is cemented as one of the\nbest sex and relationship podcasts\nthere's 80 episodes it is fire you can\nlearn some amazing tricks of the trade\nokay but what's next and I could feel my\naudience ready for something new and I\nwas ready for something new I wanted to\nexplore other topics not that I'm not\ngoing to continue to talk about those\nthings and that I think was a difficult\ntransition that some people that don't\nwant change not my audience my audience\nnot only stayed with me but then grew\nbecause people were like oh we're\nspicing up a little bit there's more\ntopics there's more conversations just\nnot about sex but I saw people that\ndidn't like the show in the beginning\nthey're like nope you're still the sex\ngirl you cannot be talking about mental\nhealth and talking about sex you can't\ntell me you're talking about sex in a\ndeep deep conversation that has to do\nwith mental health or you're not getting\ndeep enough because well no pun intended\nbut um but when I talk about that it's\nlike what we're going through in the\nworld right now with sexual identity and\nfluidity and trying to understand I mean\nit's so beautiful now that we've started\nto embrace the concept of non-binary and\nit's like letting people do what they\nfeel comfortable doing that is mental\nhealth and that is sex right\nso I think the struggle of respect has\nbeen people\nnot loving me venturing out and straying\naway from what initially was the bread\nand butter of call her daddy and I have\nbeen an athlete my whole life Jay I love\na challenge When someone tells me I\ncan't do something and but I will not\nlie it has been so hard like trying to\nstay true to myself authentic to the\ncontent but also knowing and cognizant\nof the fact that there are people that\nare like she's still sex she it's just\nsex and I'm like I what what and so it's\na difficult balance but I've tried to\njust block out the noise not read as\nmany of the comments and now I think\nthrough the the new kind of version of\nthe show it's so cool that I've taken on\nthese interviews and kind of like going\nback to what we kind of said in the\nbeginning I'm having on these celebrity\nguests that everyone's like oh you're\ngonna have on celebrities now but the\npoint was and it goes back to what we\nwere saying earlier I love this\nchallenge of like you're gonna leave and\nyou will relate to Demi Lovato you will\nrelate to Miley Cyrus you will relate to\nChelsea Handler like the these people\nthat are coming on that seem so their\nlife is so unattainable no we can relate\nto them and I've been fortunate that\nthis new format and I think through my\ntherapy journey and just because I know\nmyself and I am a warm person I am so\ninterested in people's lives I want to\nunderstand people better it makes me\nbetter it makes my audience better\nalmost every single time a guest leaves\ncall her daddy they say wow\nI have never felt so comfortable in an\ninterview and I've never opened up as\nmuch as I did in this interview\nand I take pride in that because I put a\nlot of effort into making people feel\ncomfortable because when you're talking\nabout really really intense topics like\nwe're talking about today you need to be\nopen-minded you need to come into an\nunbiased and you need to provide a space\nwhere it's like you're safe let's have a\nconversation and no judgment and I think\na lot of these celebrities feel ex\nlisten they have so they have there is\nno denying we're not saying they don't\nhave privilege and they don't have so\nmany resources we don't have\num but it's trying to humanize and I\nthink in a cool way my listeners have\nloved the new kind of version of call\nher daddy\nand then I guess this is the last part\nof also I don't plan there's one day\nthat it's not like I need an episode\nlike this one day and then this it's\nevery week I walk in and I'm like I\nthink I know who I want to interview\nbecause it feels right and I read all\nthe DMS from the daddy gang and I'm I\nstill have all my social media accounts\nno one runs the caller daddy account or\nmy account and I just read all these DMS\nof someone struggling with a\nnarcissistic parent and immediately I'm\nlike let's get Dr ramani on let's have\nher come on let's talk about how to\nsurvive a narcissistic relationship like\nit Ebbs and flows I it's I would love to\nbe like I have this perfect structure I\nam eyeballing it because I also am a\nconsumer and I'm like what am I\ninterested in because I'm so I love\nbeing in tune with my audience that I'm\nable to be like I know what they want\nbecause I want it too it's an ebbing and\nflowing relationship with respect\nthere's always going to be haters\nthere's always going to be people that\nwant me to fail but I do think\nspecifically this last year I've come\nreally into my own of like I want to\nmake amazing content for the people that\nwant to listen and if you don't want to\nlisten you don't have have to listen but\nI always do say give it a chance because\nyou will be surprised at the new caller\nDaddy it's different and I'm really\nproud of it because I put a lot of work\ninto it and you should be I personally\nI'm a fan and I've I've loved the\nevolution of it I've watched a ton of\nthe interviews I mean for me\nI couldn't agree with you more that\nwhoever sits in front of me whether\nthey're a celebrity whether they're not\nwhether they're a scientist a doctor or\na host you know whatever they may be\nlike I just want to create exactly what\nyou said like we're so aligned on that\nlike create a safe space where people\ncan feel they can be themselves and\nthey're not being forced to be someone\nand they're not being forced to be the\none version that we see but I think what\nI really took away from what you're\nsaying is that even though you're right\nI know what you're saying that there's\nno weekly structure it's not like you're\ntrying to figure out like oh we're gonna\ndo this and that\nactually when you hear you explain when\nI just heard you explain how sex and\nmental health are so interconnected\nthat is very coherent and that's very\ncohesive so even if there isn't a plan\nevery week if you're talking to all that\nkind of stuff that makes a lot of sense\nyeah and it's like no one would ever\nknow that or think about that and this\nis what I think we think so shallow now\nright like everything's a shallow\nthought and when I say shallow I don't\nmean the subject matter I mean how\ndeeply we consider an idea so Alex has\nchanged what she talks about on her\npodcast slightly right she's still she's\nstill uh doing the sex part because\nshe's still talking about those things\nbut she's also talking about mental\nhealth and therapy and whatever she\nwants to talk about that's a shallow\nthought oh she's just spotify's told her\nto do that she can't talk about sex\nanymore because whatever right like\nwhatever whatever it is I don't know\nwhat it is literally making stuff up but\nthen when you take that thought deeper\nyou go okay wait when I actually listen\nto Alex explain it she's like I should\nbe willing to do about mental health and\nsex because they're so interconnected I\nshould be able to talk about mental\nhealth then anything in my life because\nit's so interconnected and I I feel it I\njust love that description like I'm just\nholding on to that that's my biggest\ntakeaway from what you said because I\nthink it's unhealthy mentally\nemotionally spiritually psychologically\nfor us to think that any subject matter\nis separate from from any other in The\nHuman Experience I agree and I feel like\nespecially with sex and having been a\nwoman and trying to now like I'm not\ntrying to get away from it I'm just\ntrying to prove like there's other\nthings about me how what a concept and\num that respect has been something that\nI keep pushing up against of like it\nalmost I think at first I'll be honest\nmade me want to go so far away from it\nbecause it's what everyone just wanted\nto pigeonhole me as and I feel like\nespecially with the season two that's\ngonna come out of call her daddy\num at the end of September into October\nlike you're going to see a shift because\nI feel like when I was in my 20s I kind\nof mentioned this earlier your\neveryone's self involved we're just\ntrying to understand like I remember\ngetting out of college being so\nmiserable I hated my job I hated my life\nI was like what am I doing with my life\nyou're just trying to quite literally\nsurvive and\nwhere I'm at now in my life at 28. I\njust turned 28 and I feel\nI genuinely have a different interest\nfor what is happening in the world like\nI know this may not be the most\nrelatable thing but like I have one of\nthe biggest platforms specifically well\nI know I just found out my show is the\nnumber one biggest listen to show for\nwomen on in the world for a podcast\nall I think when I hear that that's\ngreat let's frame it my mom may frame it\nresponsibility\nthat's what I take from that\nhow am I not going to start talking\nabout\ndeeper topics and things that are\ngenuinely going to affect generations to\ncome having such a big platform I feel a\nsense of responsibility of what am I\ndoing open my eyes start reading the\nnews like I just feel there's a\ndifferent level that I'm taking this\nshow to and it's not to become preachy\nand it's not to become political and\nit's not to become in your face it's\ngoing to have that same genuine nature\ncolor that he has always had I am coming\nto them just having a conversation I\nwant both sides to participate I want\npeople to feel so comfortable I'm not\nasking you anything I'm just wanting\npeople to listen and to maybe have a\nthought-provoking conversation that\ncould potentially change your mind or\nstrengthen your view on something I feel\nlike in a world of such snap judgment\nbecause of social media people are\ninclined to make decisions so quickly\nbased off of a headline or a photo or or\nwhatever it is or gossip and I I like\nhow what I want to do with caller daddy\nis wouldn't you feel so much better\nif you could make your decision with a\nmore 360 POV on something and that is\nwhat podcasting does long form sit Downs\nget to know someone get to understand a\ntopic an issue an argument and then make\nyour judgment because that is amazing if\nyou leave being like I have the same\nopinion amazing but now don't you feel\nbetter that you have a bit more of an\neducated opinion rather than a snap\njudgment or most times what people do\nwhen they listen to caller daddy is okay\nI admit I was judging them\nI yeah my mind changed I just had\nsomeone on and all of the DMS were oh\nI don't know if I really\nthought I liked them anymore and now I'm\nobsessed again because I forgot what\nthey went through in their life and I\nwas completely unattached to the empathy\nlevel because all I see is social media\nposts so I hope people feel that and\nagain I'm not trying to be this like\npreachy I don't know what I'm doing half\nthe time you know but I just feel a\nsense of responsibility and I hope that\nmy audience can feel like it's just a\njourney because what else are we doing\nhere I want everyone to have fun we want\nto have laughs we're going to continue\nto have that and especially being a\nwoman right now it's like if I don't\nspeak up I'm not doing my job and I\nwon't be able to sleep at night knowing\nthat I didn't do something that actually\nwas just right in front of me that I\ncould have done and I have such a\nplatform and so I'm sure everyone can\nknow what I'm kind of talking about but\num yeah\nvote okay\nyeah yeah no I mean personally hearing\nthat\nI and you don't need to hear this from\nme and I'm only saying it because I\ngenuinely mean it and for whatever it's\nworth it's like I love that like I\npersonally appreciate that so much\nbecause I only went out to start\nbuilding a platform in the desire to\nserve like we only I only started this\njourney hoping that we'd be able to help\npeople uh it never came from anything\nelse it started in that place and it's\nstill in that place today and when I\nhear someone who's like hey I was 22 and\nnow I'm growing up and this is life and\nI like look at that I go I love people\nwho do that and you know a lot of people\nthat I work with in my in my coaching\npractice it's like that's where there\nare like they became famous through\nmusic or they became famous through\nmovies so they became famous through\nwhatever and now they're having that\nsame journey in their life where they go\nJay I have like hundreds of millions of\npeople who listen to me and they care\nabout what I have to say I don't want to\nbe the person who just has a great home\nbusiness and life I I want to do more\nthan that and to me I think when people\nwho have the opportunity to say that say\nthat and then go follow it up that's\nwhen the world starts becoming a better\nplace it does and I I think it is really\nit's a it's a hard concept especially\nwhen you have a podcast I don't see all\nthese people right you know when when\nI'm told oh your your podcast is also\nthe biggest podcast for Millennials in\ngen Z I'm like so that is an audience\nthat has the opportunity to quite\nliterally change the world yeah what am\nI doing yeah and it doesn't need to be\nevery episode I I just think there's a\ndifferent level of awareness I have\nright now and I'm I don't have it\nfigured out I I am not perfect by any\nmeans I definitely present a certain way\non social media for my business but like\nI'm I'm what I'm trying to do is just\ntake my education public and just use\nthis platform and not be better than\nanyone just genuinely be like I'm\nlearning I literally said to my team and\nI was like I will publicly say this like\na couple years ago I remember when I got\nout of college I had to call my dad and\nbe like I don't know how to like how am\nI gonna vote dad like what I'm in Boston\nI'm from Pennsylvania where am I\nregistered like I don't even know how to\nvote and I am not ashamed to say that I\nthink people feel so overwhelmed with\ncertain things in life of college does\nnot prepare us for a lot right and\nthere's a lot that we're like what are\nwe doing and I think when you have\npeople on platforms that are acting like\nyou don't know what you're doing it\nmakes you feel ashamed it makes you feel\ninsecure and then you just don't do\nanything so I think call her daddy also\nthis season is really trying to just\nmake it ingestible for everyone of like\nI'm with you guys I am also still like a\ncouple years ago my dad was helping me\non Turbo Tax okay I didn't know what I\nwas doing but I'm learning and I hope\nthat it's just I hope that people\nappreciate me just trying to make a\nlittle bit of a change because there's a\nlot of power in podcasting and in these\nreally intimate conversations that's the\nbest part about podcasting it is such an\nintimate relationship that we have with\nwith our listeners and I don't take it\nfor granted so there you go\nno you're spot on like I think we\ngenuinely close off when we think we're\nsurrounded by a community of people who\nknow it all's or and and I think that's\nwhen people start to lie that's when\npeople start to hide like I think\neveryone everyone like Millennials and\ngen Z everyone right now feels the\npressure to know how to be an investor\nlike because investing is the cool thing\nright and it's like if you don't know\nhow to buy an nft if you don't you know\nif you didn't know how to buy crypto\nwhen it was like booming and everyone's\nlike talking big it was like if you\ndidn't know how to do those things it\nwas like who are you you can't be cool\nif you don't know if you don't know how\nto vote like oh well then you don't care\nor all of these things and it's like I\ndon't think any of those things were\never explained to anyone anyone and\nwe're just listening to One random 30\nsecond Tick Tock and being like Oh my\nGod I need to buy that I need to do this\nand I'm like I fully believe I fully\nagree with what you're saying like yeah\nsocial media has definitely made us all\nfeel a little bit like we're behind like\nwhat am I missing or I don't oh I'm not\nin on that or I'm feeling excluded or\nmaybe I'm not cool enough I don't look a\ncertain way I don't know how to do\nsomething and it's like that's what I've\ntried to say take a little step back\nfrom social media recently and really\nfocus on like\nI have the same three best friends since\nI was\nsix years old I have my family I have my\nrelationship I have my amazing team now\ncaller daddy comprised of all women\nthey're amazing I feel so for everyone's\nalways like what's the best thing that\ncame from your Spotify deal and I was\nlike that I can now hire a team of these\namazing people but I do feel like you\nhave to also\neverything's with a grain of salt on\nsocial media try to also just be more\npresent like I found myself the other\nmonth on my phone on Tick Tock scrolling\nI'm by myself there's a beautiful sunset\nat my new house and I'm scrolling on\nTick Tock and I for a minute had this\nmoment of like hold on\nI'm watching a random girl in her\nbedroom\ndoing whatever she's doing\nand I don't know her and I'm sitting on\nmy couch\nlovely woman whoever she is wasting my\ntime watching someone that I don't know\nand this is not changing my life go\noutside Alex go watch the sunset go take\nmy dog on a walk be present because it\ngives me anxiety I realize when I don't\nfeel good enough I don't feel pretty\nenough I don't feel like I'm fitting the\nbody standard and then I start to spiral\nand it's like why are we doing this to\nourselves if we know that it's not\nhelping us let's I'm just trying to be a\nlittle bit more\nin the moment with my thoughts of okay\nso step back you can take it out of your\nhand and put it down and I know it's\nquite literally doctors are comparing it\nto an addiction so that's also something\nthat's helped me with my mental health\nrecently is like really putting\nboundaries on social media what are some\nof the new habits of this new Alex and\nvalues of this new Alex that are really\nbecoming integrated into your life like\nyou just said like learning about what's\nhappening in the world like being well\ninformed educating yourself taking that\nonline obviously therapy we've talked\nabout like what are some of the I guess\nthe smaller habits that you've developed\nthat's one of them and that's a\nbeautiful one I always joked I'm like\nI'm a vowel I never say this word again\nI in the beginning of call her daddy and\nshortly kind of in the pandemic went\ndown a spiral of like reading Reddit\npages about myself and awful awful\nthings about myself and I was crushed\nlike I said earlier being bullied I am a\nfull people pleaser I want everyone to\nlike me if I see that one comment I'm\nlike and then it's going to affect my\ncontent the next week and I'm going to\nhave a Freudian slip and somehow talk\nabout something that I saw in the\ncomment I'm trying to like oh my God it\nwas about like a year or so ago sat down\nI think it was it was with my therapist\nand I said\nI am never going to open this app again\nand if I do I'm hurting call her daddy\nand I almost got it helped me take it\nout of myself of like because I was it\nwas affecting my content and and I I\nstopped looking at these people that I\nremember I always used to also be like\nthey're just hurting in their own life\nand we can talk about why people are\ntrolls on the internet for hours but\nit's not my problem I I need to drown\nthat out whatever those people are going\nthrough why ever they hate me\nI know I'm a good person I know what I'm\ntrying to do so I stopped reading that\nabout a year ago and my life\nI feel like a different human being I am\ntaking notes from people that truly care\nabout me and I'm someone that my uh\nproducer was like it's interesting you\nlove a note I love a note I love someone\nto tell me when I'm doing something\nwrong what I'm doing wrong I love a note\nand so I I don't surround myself with\nyes people I'm very\nI came to LA and I had to make a\ndecision of you know who I wanted to\nhang out with what I wanted to do and\nlike I am sticking to the people that I\nhave known my whole life I am not not\nopen to meeting new friends I have made\nnew friends in LA but I'm very specific\nabout who I share my time with and I\nthink that is totally fair to say and I\nthink sometimes people like oh this is\nthat or oh you don't have as many\nfriends I am taking care of my mental\nhealth by making sure the people that\nI'm surrounded with aren't yes people\nbecause they're like oh we want to come\nand hang out in Alex's cool house with\nher cool job it's people that are like\ncheck yourself what's up like how are\nyou doing and I could do the same to\nthem and so I have made efforts to make\nsure who I'm around not only they they\ndon't even make me feel good it's it's\nthat they're real with me and they treat\nme if all this was gone tomorrow I know\nthose people are gonna still be there\nand I think with social media I've kind\nof just\nI've really gone through periods where\nmy I felt like my whole existence was\nimmersed and defiant or defined by\nsocial media and literally just through\nmeditating\nbeing alone with my thoughts\ngoing through therapy of when you\nactually dissect does something make you\nfeel bad yes so why are you doing it\nit's so simple and it is so hard but the\nmore that I train my brain it's really\nhelped me and I think when I go through\nreally awful times on social media if\npeople are coming at me if I get the\nmean comments this is something that\nkeeps me kind of grounded is I always\nget through something in the moment when\nyou are going through something it is\nawful and it can be heart-wrenching it\ncan you can feel it physically you can\nfeel alone you can feel scared whatever\nfeeling comes when something bad is\nhappening in your life but you you get\nthrough it and when you get through it\nyou look back and you're always like oh\nI wish I could have told myself like\nstop stressing stop overthinking stop so\nwhat I've had to do is in the moments of\ncrisis when I'm freaking out having a\npanic attack anxiety I'm like okay hold\non in two days this will be over\nlet's go on a walk let's take a breath\nlet's call people I love let's talk to\nmy mom let's call my therapist let's\nlike take all of the stuff that's\nhappening in my head and just calm pause\nconnect with people that love me and get\nout of your kind of psychosis that's\nhappening in your brain you're going\nover and over I always think about like\nI always get through it I've had so many\nmoments where I'm freaking out I always\nget through it I always so look at the\nother side and it's I don't know it's\neasier said than done again but like it\nhelps me be like I'm gonna be there in a\ncouple days or hours so like this it's\nnot as bad as it feels\num I don't know that makes any sense\nyeah it does it does I think what you're\ndescribing is like everything is simply\na pattern of thought right it's just a\npattern of thoughts and the current\npattern of thoughts we all have are not\nserving us they're not helping us\nthey're not improving our lives and the\nhard part is knowing which thoughts to\nchange and then how to change them and\nso the tools you just gave us were\nreally simple ways and practical ways\nthat anyone can start changing their\nthoughts and if I literally if we just\nunderstood that that simply by changing\nyour thoughts you can transform every\nhuman experience in the world whether\nit's sitting in a cold plunge and you're\njust changing your thoughts whether it's\nyou know doing a hike in the morning\nwhether it's just getting to the gym\nright like whatever it is it's just\nchanging your thoughts and it's\nbeautiful to hear you figure that out\nand and work through that also\njournaling I've had when I go through\nreally hard times I always Journal\nduring and after and then when I'm going\nthrough a crisis again I'll read the\nafter and even the during and I'm like I\nwas spirally look where I am now I'm\nsitting on the beach like what I'm or\nI'm driving to work everything's okay we\nget through I have gone through people\ndying and it's like it is the worst it\nis the worst but you have to find a way\nto keep going you have to find the\npositive right and and um I have a lot\nof friends connected through trauma of\nthings that happen in our childhood and\nit's like we I had my two best\ngirlfriends come and visit me and they\nwere with me for a week and we were just\ntalking about life how am I going to\nkeep going but then you remember the\nmoment after that where you're laughing\non the beach with your friend and you're\nlike imagine if I didn't keep going I\nwouldn't have this beautiful moment with\nthese people and so it's like always\ntrying to look to the other side and if\nyou can get there you can take that\nbreath and be like thank God I I hung in\nthere yeah what's a belief that you\nthink you've had about yourself that you\nthink LED you down the wrong path like\nis there a specific belief that you once\nhad about yourself that you think kind\nof went the other way like you just said\nsometimes you have to push through right\nsometimes we carry a belief about\nourselves and we end up somewhere we\ndon't want to be I think because of\nthings that have happened publicly and\nthere's so many things that have\nhappened publicly for me in my career I\nwould say it really hurts me when people\nassume I'm a bad friend\nmy entire life that has been the one\nthing\nI have felt\nI'm proud of myself for truly like\nmy friendships are so valuable to me and\nI take such pride in those relationships\nand when you have public things and it\nhappens to happen with a woman it's like\nthe person that comes out on top is the\nvillain and then the person that didn't\nis the victim and I'm not like going at\nanyone saying that they're calling\nthemselves a victim I'm just saying\nthat's how the public perceives it and\nso as a woman it upsets me and I would\nfind myself really struggling at times\nbeing like I know I'm a great friend\nlike I had a friend recently say to me\nbecause she's going through something\nand almost like through the tools of my\nshow and therapy she mentioned to me she\nwas like I have never I think I've never\nfelt you being a better friend than In\nThis Moment Like I can't thank you for\nhow much you're taking on for me and I\nwas like I'm in a good place right now\nlike it's all I can picture doing is is\nhelping a friend and being there for\nsomeone because you've been there for me\nwhen I I've been at the absolute bottom\nthat's how friendship works right and I\nthink friendships are so beautiful\nbecause you have to choose to keep it\nmoving keep it strong a romantic\nrelationship it's there you're together\nall the time friendship that's hard my\nfriends live across the country my three\nbest friends do not live in Los Angeles\nCalifornia and it is a constant effort\nand they know me just as much as I know\nthem and we have been through so much\ntogether but I think that kind of ate at\nme and I'm sure you've had it of like\nthere's nothing worse than when someone\nbelieves something about you that you're\nlike oh like I want to prove it's that's\nnot true and I have so many things that\ncould prove that that's not true but\nI've had to work on in therapy of like I\ncan't please everyone and through do my\nfriends know I'm a good friend\nthat's all that matters the internet\nthinking I'm this or that like if you\nlike my show you're gonna listen but\nyou're not listening because I'm a good\nfriend so it's like I need to prioritize\nknowing who I am knowing how deeply I\nfeel for these people that I I consider\nfamily\nthat's all that matters and I don't need\nto prove that but I definitely went down\nmoments of like oh my God am I trying to\ntalk about this in an episode and prove\nit's like Alex you if if I tried to\nwhack em all everything people think\nabout me I'm not gonna get done\ninterviews I'll be just doing solo\nepisodes for the rest of my career so\nthat was something that was kind of hard\nyeah and there'd still be something\nabout your explanation that wouldn't be\nenough yeah and yeah I found that I mean\nI was asked in a podcast a few years ago\nsomeone asked me the question uh what's\nsomething you used to value that you\ndon't value anymore and it was a really\ngreat question and we have the video of\nit I'm like sitting there thinking about\nit and you can tell it's you know when\nyou ask a question and you actually have\nto think rather than like you've got a\nmillion things to say\nand I said being understood I was like I\njust don't value being understood\nanymore because it's just it killed me\nthat desire I had and I get that people\nit's like for years I just wanted people\nto know I was a good person and that I\nhad pure intentions and I was trying to\nserve the world and I was and I was like\nyou know what No One's Gonna Give me the\nbenefit of the doubt no one cares and at\nthe end of the day I have to lose that\ndesire to be misunderstood I'm sorry to\nbe understood because most people are\ngoing to misunderstand me and that's\nokay that is like freed me that is so\nbeautiful because I relate to that\ndeeply and I love that you're saying\nthat because being understood is so\noverrated and exhausting because who\nyou're mostly trying now in the age of\nsocial media to be understood by is\npeople you don't even know yeah and what\nabout the people you do know how much\ntime are you putting are we it was a\nmeasure for me of am I putting more\neffort into the people I don't know than\nthe people I do know that's check your\nyourself because I've done that to\nmyself and I love that you said that\nbecause it when you get to that point it\nis so freeing because you're like I'm me\nI don't need if I say something people\ntake the wrong way I don't need to not\nbe like oh my God I promise I'm a good\nperson no\nyou either know or you don't and I'm not\ngonna run around and chase people and\ntry to convince people of my character\nI go to sleep at night I know I'm a good\ndaughter a good partner and a good\nfriend and I know I am not perfect by\nany means but I am trying every day\nthrough therapy through just looking\ninward a lot and trying to be with my\nthoughts and being more present with the\nuncomfortable silent moments trying to\njust be a better person and I think it\nsounds corny even when I say it out loud\nbut like what else are we here to do you\nknow what I mean like do you are you\ngood with the people you love and who\nlove you that's kind of all that matters\nand the rest is noise and we have huge\nplatforms and it's so great but if all\nof it ended tomorrow I would be okay\nyeah and I don't think I could have said\nthat a couple years ago and I don't want\nit to end I love you all but it is it's\na good feeling because that then I can\nreally put all of me into the podcast\nbecause it's like I'm gonna be me and\nI'm gonna do me until I don't want to do\nit anymore and no one can tell me\notherwise you know what I mean so it's\nit's kind of a freeing feeling yeah and\nhere's what we know we know that the\npeople that do listen to us every week\nthey do know us like I feel so seed\nheard and understood by my community\nthat listens to me here and whether they\nlisten to the solos or these guest\nepisodes like I know they know me they\nunderstand me and I always say that if\nyou see me on the streets please come\nand say hello because we can have a\ngreat conversation but at the same time\nas that one thing I do know is that I\nread a study that said you have to spend\n200 hours with someone to consider to\nknow them deeply and I started thinking\nabout who in the world have I spent 200\nhours with whoa and I started to realize\nit wasn't that many people and that\nwasn't something that made me sad it\njust made me value those people so much\nmore so my best my best friend who's my\nbest man at my wedding I've known him\nfor 18 years and he I still talk to him\nthree or four times a week I don't know\nwhere I find the time I don't know where\nhe finds the time but every car Journey\nwhatever I'm doing around La I'll call\nit he's in London London so he had an\neight hour time difference too and he\nalways picks up we always find a way to\nconnect and we still our friendships got\nbetter since I left England and so all\nmy best friends are in London because\nthat's where I grew up my family's in\nLondon my wife's family's in London so\nfor us like I I totally hear what you're\nsaying that then statement you made that\nreally resonated with me today on off of\nwhat I said was that being understood as\noverrated and it's so true because I\nwould say that I'm still trying to\nunderstand even the people I've spent\n200 hours with\nso how am I expecting someone who met me\nonce for two minutes absolutely to\nunderstand 200 hour version of me I\nwould hope not I hope I'm complex enough\nI really love that and I I think it's um\nI think that I always say to anyone and\nespecially in 20s 30s when you're out of\ncollege it is so so depleting at times\nbecause you are stripped of that\nimmediate Comfort friends in you know\nproximity wise and you're immediately\nall of a sudden you're across the\ncountry and your friends across it and\nyou're like I don't have friends and\nit's a really isolating and lonely time\nbut I would start with do you have one\nperson do you have one person that you\ncan call that's really all that matters\nand of course we want friend groups we\nwant friendships we want connections\num we want to go to parties guys come on\nbut you but you have to just start slow\nwith yourselves and and I think a lot of\ntimes in your 20s it's a you almost get\ndismembered and you have to build\nyourself back up and we're really hard\non ourselves with those friendships it's\nso much easier said than done but\num it is a great reward when you can\nmaintain those because it's they're\nbeautiful and like I said you're not\nhaving sex with these people hopefully\nso your friends are just there because\nthey love you hopefully\num gets messy don't do it guys but no\nit's a really it's a really powerful\nrelationship yeah we've talked about\nfriendships and I want to talk about\nrelationships a bit because it's it's a\nbig thing here on on purpose and I'm\nasking this because for me and this is\nwhat we do right and this is why I'm\nvery clear on this and this is one of\nthe best skill I learned from training\nto become a coach was to not project my\nintentions onto other people's actions\nso what we often do is when we see\nsomeone who does the same thing as us we\nassume they did it because of the same\nreason as us so if you see someone lied\nto someone if you're someone who would\nlie to someone because you don't want to\nupset someone's feelings you're like oh\nthey lied to them because they don't\nwant to upset someone's realings yeah\nbut if you're someone who didn't do\nsomething because you were jealous of\nsomething when someone doesn't do that\nsame thing you're like oh that's because\nthey're jealous of them so we project\nour intentions onto other people's\nactions so interesting and so I'm I'm\nprojecting now and so I'm I'm being very\nhonest and open about it my wife and I\nhave been together for 10 years long\nbefore I my public life and we got\nmarried six years ago and I started\ncreating content online around the same\ntime as we got married we'd already been\ntogether for four years and I've been\ncreating offline content for 10 years\nbefore I started doing online content so\nI did events and I spoke and did\nseminars and workshops and coaching and\nall this stuff anyway for the first\nthree years of my content life no one\nknew I was married uh it wasn't that I\ndidn't talk about it it's that I used to\nmake four minute videos on Facebook and\nYouTube and those four minute videos\nwere based on ideas long form content\nhadn't really taken off and I didn't\nreally feel to post selfies with me and\nmy wife because I was\ngaining traction from talking about\nphilosophy and psychology and ideas that\nI cared about and we just got married\ntoo and it was all new to us it was like\nall of a sudden like when I would post\nthat I was at a restaurant people would\nturn up and things like then so I was\nvery protective of my mom my sister my\nwife and just everyone in my life and\nthen my first ever podcast episode was\nme interviewing my wife and us talking\nabout how we met and our journey and\neverything else that came with that and\nthat was in 2019 when we talked about it\nI am so grateful that I didn't do it\nbefore then because it gave my wife time\nto a acclimatize to the new life we'd\ncreated it gave her a sense of stability\nin what we were doing and where we're\ngoing and it helped me deal with what I\nneeded to deal with in this journey it\nwasn't something I would even say I was\nfully conscious of I guess my question\nto you is do you think having a\nrelationship that you're open about but\nthat is private consciously improves the\nquality of relationship you can build\nI'm projecting that I think it's healthy\nbut you don't have to buy into my\nprojections you know what I'm gonna buy\nin okay\num I I do I definitely it's interesting\nbecause when I met my boyfriend I had\nalready podcasted about him before our\nfirst date and he I remember podcasting\nI was in Los Angeles and we were going\nto a dinner and I'm podcasting about my\nwants and my needs and all the things\nthat I'm expecting for this date to go\nthis I had never met this man in my life\num classic Alex just going for it for\nthe podcast Gotta Give the daddy game\nwhat they want and I show up to the date\nand halfway through I'm like oh you're\ngonna be on next week's episode and he's\na very private person and he was like\nwhat and I was like it's gonna be so\ngood and then I'm gonna go back and\nrecord whatever happens at the end of\nthe day and he was like so shocked I\nwill say I think he thought it was quite\nCharming I love how men are always like\noh I don't want to be on they love being\non\num but with him it was interesting\nbecause I I went all the way in and I\nstarted talking about him from the\nbeginning and then I had to pull it back\nbecause I realized oh well this is a\nreal relationship and I have so much\nrespect for him and he's in the um\nentertainment industry\num but he's private and he he in a great\nway this is how I knew he was the one he\nnever said don't talk about me but he\nasked that we just have conversations\nabout it and just keep talking about it\nand I've had past relationships where it\nwas like f your show I don't care and he\nis such a respect for my craft that he\nrecognizes that is kind of what you do\nfor a living and your life is your\nliving\num but I did start to pull back and I\nknow it's not fun to hear but my\nrelationship couldn't be better because\nof it all of a sudden he didn't have to\nwake up in the morning and press play\nand listen to what I said and and we\nweren't\num getting DMS about our relationship\nand it really allowed us to just be\npresent of hey do we like each other\nyeah I I've said to people I and I'm not\njudging people that post on social media\nwith their partner I I always just like\nto check myself and then I just tell\npeople what I'm doing and if you want to\nyou know do it too but it's like there's\nsome relationships I worry are you just\ntogether still because the public loves\nyou and that is not healthy and I think\nthat with social media people can become\naddicted to the concept of\nperfect relationship and what it looks\nlike what is it like behind closed doors\nI am so fortunate that I don't have that\nwith my partner I'm with him because I\nlove him and I love our relationship and\nnone of it is contingent upon either of\nour jobs so that's been very healthy was\nit hard yeah of course there's great\ncontent in there and occasionally I will\nshare\num but I I told my listeners one rule\nthat I implemented with my partner was\nif we have an argument or a fight or a\ndisagreement or whatever and it's an\nopen wound at the time for the\nrelationship I made the mistake once of\ngoing and talking about it on the\npodcast too soon that we hadn't even\nhealed and\nmy partner is so mature that he was like\nI love you so much but I think we need\nboundaries because hearing that is not\nfun and it almost made it worse for me\nbecause we haven't resolved it and so\nnow I have this like I have a boundary\nwhere it's like a couple months later I\ncan totally talk about it because he was\nlike some of our arguments are great for\ncouples to think about and talk about\num they're very relatable but I think in\nthe moment it's always good to just put\nmy relationship first and it doesn't\nmean I'm not putting the show first it's\njust having a good set boundary that I\ndidn't have before and I'm really really\nhappy I've done it yeah I've lived\nhearing today about how many different\nboundaries you put into different areas\nin your life\nyeah winning a boundary setting like no\nbut it's so important because I think\nthe problem is that we think of life as\neither or and life is more boundaries\nand layers and levels and it's like we\nthink I'm either close to this person or\nI'm not and I'm like no you're closer to\nthis person than this person it's not\nthat you're close or not and I think\nwhen you start looking at life as\ndegrees and you know you see a little\nRipple and different degrees versus like\nyes or no absolutely and I think the\nconcept of again this is all for public\nconsumption yeah posting your partner\nfor people in my case that don't I don't\nknow right and even a lot of people even\nif you have a thousand followers on\nInstagram do you have a thousand friends\nabsolutely not Becky okay you do not\nhave a thousand friends so I always am\nalso just like what is the motive behind\nposting your partner is it to get\nvalidation that you're not getting in\nthe relationship is it to seek approval\nis it to show off something that you're\nproud of but well if you were super you\nknow confident like would you need that\nexterior validation right and again I'm\nnot saying not to post your partner it's\nreally just I think with social media\nwe've been so quick to just throw stuff\nup about our life and it's like well why\nare you doing that who was that for why\ndo you feel the need to show people that\nyou don't even know how your\nrelationship is going and write these\nlong captions about it I totally get\ntrying to connect with people\num but there is a level that I started\nto find of like I think I'm just doing\nthis because this is like is helping\ncontent it's not good for my\nrelationship I need to pull back yeah\nand I love that who it's for question\nbecause I do that exercise with myself\nwhen I post stuff like I post certain\nthings and I know no one cares but I\nreally care about it like it's like it's\na big deal for me or whatever and then\nI'll post and I'll always tell it to him\nI'll be like do not look at the likes do\nnot look at the comments I know it's\ngonna do terribly but it's really\nimportant to me and I want it to be out\nthere because to me that's really really\nyou know powerful and and obviously we\nwe only put out things that we think are\npowerful of course but there are certain\nthings that I know no one cares about\nabout for me and at the same time I\nthink for me what I was getting at was\nthat three years of being married for me\nand my wife gave us a sense of getting\nto know each other in that way without\nhaving to deal with any opinions any\nlike right now all we ever get when we\npost anything is just you guys like\nbrother and sister and I'm like that's\nlike that's not what I would have wanted\nto hear when we just got married so I'm\nvery happy that we didn't because that's\nall we ever get and so I'm like all\nright this is this is great like so\nthat's the thing you're never gonna it's\nreal there's always gonna be the\nnegative and so that's what also I'm I'm\nreally protective of it because I'm like\nI'm so happy he's so happy our families\nlove each other we're doing good we are\nby no means a perfect couple but I have\nno interest right now in opening that up\nfor public consumption to just have an\nopinion yeah I don't need it I want to\nknow am I in this because I like him\nthat's it yeah great stick with it last\nquestion on relationships I think a lot\nof people ask like you know what do you\nlook for in someone I think for me it's\nthe opposite way around like what do you\nthink\nyou want someone to bring out in you\nthat you see as a healthy relationship\nlike what are you happy being when\nyou're in a good place I'm a lot I'm\nself-aware enough to know I'm a lot and\nreally when I say I'm a lot I think my\njob is a lot right and I I am\nso passionate like I've said I've been\ndoing this since I was so young I would\nbe making these videos no one was seeing\nthem I was acting like they were going\nto be up for an Academy Award no one was\nmy parents were barely watching them do\nyou still have them oh they're awful yes\nit's shocking they're like we're gonna\nplay it one day at your wedding like so\nI'm not getting married then\num but the point is is I I have always\nfelt like\nwhat I'm doing and my passion is so a\npart of me and I need a partner that is\ngoing to support me especially in a\nheterosexual relationship can a man be\nokay with\nI'm okay if I'm the breadwinner it's not\nthe case my relationship were pretty\nequal but it's like I need to be able to\nbe myself and I need my partner to not\nbe intimidated by My Success not try to\nhold me down let me be me and you be you\nand if we come together we make each\nother better amazing but I've had\nrelationships with men where they were\nextremely intimidated by my success and\nit was constantly trying to push me down\num language that was semi-abusive of\ntrying to make me feel less than and it\nwas really toxic and it affected me and\nnow being in a healthy relationship with\nsomeone that is like you are incredible\nI support you is like my number one\ncheerleader that to me is the hottest\nthing that someone can do and I'm so\nattracted to my partner because of that\nI also think someone that is so honest\nmy partner is so honest with me\nsometimes I'm like oh my God it's like\nI'm not used to the honesty and I really\nrespect that because I am a noble person\nand like what's up what's going on and\nto meet my match kind of with that we do\nno dance arounds like it is just like\nwhat is up and I know some people don't\nlike that you need a little like cushion\nI am like hit me where it hurts let's\nget this over with so I think those two\nthings the honesty\num and also just allowing me to be who I\nam and I know it sounds pretty\nstraightforward but a lot of people try\nto change each other you're laughing\nwhat did I say\nreally I really no no yeah I'm laughing\nbecause you literally there's something\nyou said that just like\nit just totally reminded me of some this\nweekend so anyway but carry on yeah I'll\ntell you okay the point is is you I've\nlearned in relationships like you talked\nabout projection there's so much\nprojection if you don't work on yourself\nand whatever your form of therapy for\nyourself is if you don't know who you\nare you're gonna go into a relationship\nand quite literally look for the things\nyou want out of that person and you're\ngonna be put unrealistic expectations\nonto this person and you don't even know\nif you actually like them because you're\njust trying to get what you want it's\nlike wait you don't even like the homie\nlike get out of here like and so I think\nstripping it down to do you like them as\nwho they are as a human being and not\nhonestly also for how they make you feel\nall the time do you like them as an\nindividual and do you two match up of\ncourse you want them to make you feel\ngood but I think sometimes we project\nour wants and our needs and everything\nonto a person it's like hold on work on\nyour own yeah and then come back and see\nif you like the person because a lot of\ntimes the person you're with is just\nfulfilling something that's an\ninsecurity of yours if you feel that\ninsecurity would you still need to be\nwith that person absolutely absolutely\ntherapy session 101 okay no I love it I\nlove it you remind so I was doing\nsomething important last week and my\nwife is doing something important as in\nbeing at a wedding I was gonna open this\nentire episode with so how was the\nwedding I miss our interview I will tell\nyou that simply I will tell you about it\noffline I will tell you very offline but\nI Was preparing for something last week\nand my wife is that person to me so I\nknow that and I have an amazing team\nwho's very honest with me for sure like\nI definitely like we literally were look\nwe look at the head shots for like my\nbook coming out next year and so the\nteam was like look and we were like no\nno no like with I'm doing it with my\nteam and it's always the most painfully\nthing I'm like looking at your own face\nand all yeah and anyway but my wife like\ntakes it to another level so she's like\nall right do your speech in front of me\nso I'm like all right I'm gonna do it\nand and I'd set myself up for it every\ntime because I know she's gonna give me\nreally good feedback but my male ego\ncan't take it so I'll do it and then\nshe'll be like oh yeah but this part\ndidn't make sense I'm like no but this\nis why I did it that way this is like\nbut I'm telling you as a viewer and\nyou're not gonna be able to explain to\neveryone why you said Charlie and I'm\ngetting and I guess to be defensive and\nthen she's like but say it like this and\nI'm like no but the way you just said it\ndidn't sound good anyway and it's like I\nget so defensive but she's and then I\ntook all of it back and I did it exactly\nthat way that is no that is Iconic also\nmy boyfriend did that he had a speech he\nhad to do at his brother's wedding and\nwe were upstairs in the room and he's\npracticing he's pacing he's freaking out\nand I'm like it's coming off weird when\nyou say it like that it's not hitting\nyou're trying to be funny you're not\nfunny okay he's like oh okay and I was\ntrying to give constructive feedback and\nhe was freaking out and he's like losing\nhis mind and I'm like sit down let me\nrewrite it for you I'm the comedian the\nrelationship let's move forward and it\nwas funny though because he was really\nfreaking out but then at the end of the\nday he's like okay I trust you yeah\nexactly you got to do a little push and\npull and then you're like okay I\ntrust you yeah and then there's some\nstuff that I just hide from her in the\npractice because I know I I want to do\nit anyway and so then I don't show her\nthat bit and she was like oh that bit\nwas really good I'm like see if I showed\nit to you you would have thought it was\ngood so but the constructive criticism\nwas good\nadded your little flare flare and it all\nwent well yeah okay exactly exactly uh\nAlex we and every on purpose episode\nwith uh two now two you're the first\nperson ever do this okay uh so we have\nour Fast Five but we also have our new\nsegment which very aptly is called the\nmany sides of you one word\num we're still figuring out the name\nwe're getting there we're getting there\num but we're gonna do this so what this\nis is you're gonna give a word for every\none of these things just one word oh God\nand it's all about you oh God so are you\nready I don't know if I like that okay\nall right what is a word or phrase to\ndescribe what someone would say about\nyou when they meet you for the first\ntime I would say\nwarm and trustworthy which is really\nweird oh I forgot you said warm in the\nbeginning\nyeah yeah I agree I honestly agree yeah\nyeah I've had a lot of people that just\nI think again on social media you think\none thing of me and then you meet me and\nyou're like oh wait like she's I had a\nwaitress I met this past week and she DM\nme after I was like I didn't think you'd\nbe that nice I'm like guys I'm I'm not a\nscary person but I I do think I have um\na warmth that makes people feel really\ncomfortable yeah I believe I agree okay\nuh what is the word someone that knows\nyou very well would use to describe your\nphrase ooh determined sometimes scary I\nI think my boyfriend and my parents are\nlike oh God here she goes like I'm like\nI'm gonna finish this and it's gonna be\nthe best and they're like okay it just\ngot out of her way here she goes like\nvery determined I love that uh what is a\nword or phrase you would you use to\ndescribe yourself\nloyal and passionate\nthose two things like resonate so much\nwith me and into completely different\nways but a part of who I am truly is my\ncraft and I'm so passionate about it\neven if I made no money on it tomorrow I\nwould go back I would still be making\ncontent and I'm also passionate about\nanything I'm doing in my life I have to\nbe passionate about my family my\nrelationships my friends and loyalty to\nme is number one I respect anyone that's\nloyal and to me it's like the number one\nthing on the list of something in a\nrelationship that I look for and I take\npride in being loyal I love that that's\nbeautiful I love those qualities thank\nyou easier than asking you what your\nvalues are I like it uh yeah sure what\nis the word that maybe someone who who\ndoesn't like you would say about you how\nwould they describe you\num cocky damn right damn right You Gotta\nBe You Gotta Be and the last one what is\nthe word or phrase you're trying to\nembody something that you're working on\nright now intentional I I really am\ntrying to in every aspect of my life\nalways ask what is the objective try to\nbe more intentional about things because\nI think when you do things with care\neverything is better people feel better\nabout it you feel better and also it\njust there's a different radiating\neffect when you're intentional about\nthings so whether it's in my\nrelationships or my craft like I'm very\ntrying to be intentional especially this\nyear I love that that's a great word\nthis is a good game that's great you did\ngood you did good all right these These\nare the final five before we do that I\nwant to ask you Alex like was there\nanything that you shared that you oh\nsorry anything you haven't shared today\nthat you really wanted to share or\nsomething you wanted to talk about and I\nI mean I'm asking this online offline as\njust to honor you in terms of if there's\nsomething that we've missed or do you\nwant do you want to dive more into like\nand I and I'm happy to because I could\ntalk to you for hours I have no time\nlimit I'm happy to dive into you with\nlike talking more about the\nentrepreneurship side and the cross side\nand the business side I mean I think in\na really cool way I didn't I didn't know\nwhere this was going to go today and I'm\nreally happy I I hope that\nwho I am behind the camera kind of came\nout today and I guess I would just say\nto anyone listening and this is not like\na plug for my show it's more like I\nreally\nI think this year I've tried to start\nespecially when I'm sitting down with\npeople to give people the benefit of the\nDow and a chance to hear even if I have\nmisconceptions about someone and so I\njust hope anyone listening if you maybe\nhad a judgment about call her Daddy back\nin the past or of me I ask\njust to be open-minded and and kind of\njust give it another chance because\none I think everyone deserves that and\ntwo I I really am proud of what I'm\ndoing and I'm proud of the show and the\ndirection it's taken not to say that I'm\nnot proud of the past but I I think\npeople would be surprised at where it's\ngone and how much it's grown and I just\nwould ask for a chance and give it a\nlisten and\num yeah that's it I love that I love\nthat and and you're doing it and and\nhonestly for like I keep saying you\ndon't need it from me but whatever it's\nworth it's like I just love watching\npeople grow and try new things and take\nrisks and like do something that's fresh\nand new and then everything you said\nabout impact and responsibility and even\nthe interviews you have done like for me\nit's it's beautiful to watch that and so\nyou know congrats not on this external\nsuccess of course on that but more on\nlike doing the hard thing right like\nthat's what's more interesting to me and\nI think as a Creator and as a host it's\nlike doing the hard thing it's like to\nkeep feeding\nwhatever everything on everyone wants is\neasy but to actually switch and say I've\nchanged I've grown I've evolved and this\nis where I'm going now that that and\nthat's where so many people at 50 60 70\nyears old feel so empty because for the\nlast 25 years they just did what other\npeople wanted them to do totally and\nit's like you gotta go for it I just\ndon't want to be in that position no\nanyone listening if you've wanted to do\nsomething you got to go for it because\nwe have literally no idea how much time\nwe have here and that's what I'm doing\nwith this especially the season I'm like\noh I'm going for it I believe in\nsomething I'm gonna go for it and I will\nI'll handle whatever comes with that\nyeah I love that all right Alex I've got\nfive questions left for you okay these\nare the first five okay uh what is okay\nAlex Cooper these you're fast five uh\nquestion number one what is the best\nadvice you've ever received oh this is\nso generic but it's so true it's for my\nmother be yourself in a world of people\ntrying to tell you what to be what to do\nbe yourself know yourself and the\njourney of knowing yourself is is going\nto be just as long if you're going to\nknow yourself or you're going to go with\nwhat people want you to be be yourself\nit's so much for more rewarding at the\nend of the day I love it all right\nsecond question what is the worst advice\nyou've ever received\num be quiet where would that have gotten\nme guys I mean a microphone myself here\nwe go don't be quiet speak your mind go\nfor what you want and bulldoze through\ndoors question number three
