makes me happy to be with you\num you know I think of Happiness as a\ndaily practice and appreciating the\npeople you love Is Just critical to it\nyeah yeah and and I really appreciate\nyou you said you were happy to be here\nwhen we were just filming it a couple of\nseconds ago and then you're telling me\nthat I I looked good and I was saying to\nyou it's because I've been doing all the\nright things and following your advice\nand I remember I think it was our second\ninterview not our first one our second\ninterview\nI was saying to you like I have only one\ncheat day a week now and you just looked\nat me and you were like well you know\nwhy they call it a cheat day right\nand I didn't I was like what do you mean\nand you're like yeah because you're\ncheating your brain like you know and\nand you gave this beautiful explanation\nand I was thinking you always have these\nthings that you say that stick with me\nand if anyone doesn't follow Dr Danny\nLayman on Instagram make sure you go and\nfollow him because I love how you post\nthe brain scans of befores and afters of\non a certain drug and without a certain\ndrug on weed without weed like I just\nthink that the way you communicate brain\nhealth is is fantastic and so great for\nyou know my generation the generation\nafter me I think we have so much to\nlearn from you so thank you for what\nyou're doing and how you're doing it too\nand always makes me happy to see you and\nyour wife as well uh and this has\nprobably been the longest I haven't seen\nyou since you scan my brain so that was\nso much fun that was so much fun I was\nvery relieved to know that my brain was\ndoing all right so well when you see it\nyou develop a relationship with it and\nyou want it to be better and it's hard\nto hurt it once you see it yeah that's\nso true and it's it's crazy to me that\nwe don't get exposed to our brains like\nyou don't ever see your brain which we\nuse every day that works for us every\nday and you have no access to it apart\nfrom see your body you see you know\ndifferent organs maybe sometimes but the\nbrain's not talked about a lot what is\nour brain\nwhat does it do and how do we develop a\nrelationship with it because I feel that\npeople are very confused with what is\nthe brain what is the mind you know what\ndoes it do what does it not do I think\nthere's a lot of stuff out there how\nwould you describe it well it's very\nclear to me after all the scans I've\ndone that your brain the physical\nfunctioning of your brain the moment by\nmoment physical functioning of your\nbrain creates your mind and if your\nbrain's not right your mind's not right\nand there are a lot of spiritual\nteachers that'll separate the Mind from\nthe brain but you can't because just\nthink of Alzheimer's disease you know\nvery damaged brains and they're very\ndamaged Minds The Go I mean people that\nact in ways they never act if their\nbrain was healthy that they don't\nremember people that they're deeply in\nlove with and so if we want a healthy\nmind it actually starts with a healthy\nbrain and you know I've had the blessing\nor the curse to scan over a thousand\nconvicted felons and over a hundred\nmurderers and their brains are very\ndamaged so if your behavior is so bad\nyou end up in a cage\nand they're not thinking oh I have to\nunderstand evaluate rehabilitate that\nperson's brain and then that better and\nthat helps all of us stuff stafsky once\nsaid you can tell about the soul of a\nsociety not by how it treats its\noutstanding citizens but by how it\ntreats its criminals and it's you know\nwhen I first started scanning people I\ndidn't really have an opinion on the\ndeath penalty I just really hadn't\nthought about it I thought of Free Will\nas black or white you have it or you\ndon't and then as my work became known\ndefense attorneys would send me people\ndid really bad things and their brains\nwere so damaged and when I would go to\ncourt a lot of people hated me for that\nyou know if you have a bad brain and you\ndid something terrible you don't get to\ngo home\nbut should you kill them I mean it's a\nreally important question\nand I'm like no you know it's not the\nsign of an involved Society to kill sick\npeople I mean you have to protect\nSociety from them but what I've seen is\nif we rehabilitate their brain they can\nhave a meaningful life and people just\naren't connecting it's your brain it's\neasy to call people bad\nit's harder to go why\nand oh can I fix it what are the things\nthat damage our brains because I think\nwhat we find is we often think like oh\nthat person was totally normal and then\none day they just changed or we say\nthings like oh yeah if you just met them\nlike they were just quiet and calm like\nyou would never have noticed anything\nand then they did this horrific thing\nlike what are those habits what are\nthose patterns that start damaging our\nbrain because I don't think we're aware\nas you said we never see our brain we\ndon't really talk about it we don't\nreally know much about it what are the\nthings we do since birth that damage our\nbrains that could lead to something as\nExtreme as that well even before birth\nyes so since marijuana's been legalized\nin many states babies born with\nmarijuana in their bodies has gone up\nSeventeen hundred percent I mean it's a\nridiculous amount so even before before\nyou're born what happens in utero can\ndamage the trajectory of your life to\nhave more behavior problems they have\nmore attention problems they have less\nempathy for other people and then you\nknow as you go through life this\nstandard American diet is damaging\nbrains you know you talked about how\nhealthy your diet has been I follow this\nguy on Tick Tock for some reason my tick\ntocks has gone crazy and he he looked at\nhis blood sugar before and after\nPop-Tarts and Pop-Tarts was like the\nworst thing he looked at almost worse\nthan Coca-Cola and but what are we\nfeeding children I mean in public school\nfree lunches\nPop-Tarts which means we're damaging\ntheir blood sugar levels we're damaging\ntheir weight and we're damaging their\nbrain and I have a mnemonic called\nbright Minds which helps me remember you\nknow like B is for blood flow low blood\nflow number one brain Imaging predictor\nof Alzheimer's disease so Netflix right\nnot in front of the TV too often not\nexercising that damages your brain\nprobably the number one thing that\ncauses brain trouble your brain is soft\nabout the consistency of soft butter\nyour skull is really hard and has sharp\nbony ridges mild traumatic brain\ninjuries ruin people's lives if you said\nhey Daniel single most important thing\nfrom 210 000 scans mild traumatic brain\ninjuries\nphysical right from snowboarding falling\noff a horse football soccer\nphysical abuse will do it falls car\naccidents\num you know and people are texting and\ndriving and texting and walking and\nthere's three million new concussions\nevery year in the United States which\nmeans over the last 30 years there have\nbeen 90 million people that have had\nconcussions it's very common and a\ncommon cause of depression homelessness\naddiction suicide panic attacks ADHD wow\nyeah I mean when you spell it out that\nclearly I think what I love about you is\nI think the two times I have done an\ninterview and then when I was with you I\njust go away going I need to so I need\nto do something for my brain I need to\nfigure it out right and it's it's a good\nthing like I enjoyed that healthy sense\nof an Awakening and a healthy sense of\nfear because I think we are so scared of\nbeing scared in society today like we\ndon't want to listen to the truth\nbecause it's scary it's inconvenient it\nforces us to change something if someone\ncould do something starting tomorrow\nwhat is the thing that someone could do\nwaking up tomorrow that could be better\nfor their brain what would you say that\nis well you know and you happier I talk\na lot about the tiny habits the smallest\nthings that'll make the biggest\ndifference and brain and mental health\nit's a daily practice just like physical\nhealth right as I said you look really\ngreat that's a daily practice right you\njust don't do that one day a week you do\nit every day if you want a really great\nbrain and a really great mind their\nhabits every day and some of my favorite\nevery day is this good for my brain or\nbad for it I I just like when my\ndaughter she turned 19 yesterday\nand when she was little we played\nChloe's game and Chloe's game was is\nthis good for your brain or bad for it\nfrozen blueberries so two thumbs up\nGod's candy or avocados oh two thumbs up\nGod's butter hitting your head with a\nsoccer ball no very stupid thumbs down\nright and so just playing with her with\nthat question that takes three seconds\nright I mean it doesn't take long and\npeople go what's good and what's bad\nsecond graders know it I went into her\nsecond grade class put 20 things on the\nboard and I went separate them for me\nand they got 19 out of 20 right so I got\na 95 percent and the only thing they got\nwrong was orange juice which they put in\nthe good category which is like way too\nmuch sugar yes and so whenever you\nunwrap sugar from its fiber source right\nturn fruit into juice it turns toxic in\nyour body so you have to be really\ncareful with that so that's one two\nwhenever you wake up in the morning\ntoday is going to be a great day you\nhave to nudge your brain right we have a\nconscious mind we have an unconscious\nmind we have a self-image and your\nsubconscious is paying attention to the\nwords that the conscious mind is saying\nand so if you're like oh I don't want to\nget out of bed today is going to be a\nbad day you're gonna have a bad day\nbecause you just programmed your\nsubconscious mind to do that every day\nwhen my feet hit the floor today is\ngoing to be a great day and then my\nfavorite of all of them is\num\nwhen you go to bed at night and bed is\nso important because if you want to have\na good day it starts the night before is\nwhat went well today so when I go to bed\nI say a prayer and then I go what went\nwell and I go on a treasure hunt because\nI'm purposefully looking for\nwhat are the right things that happen\nand I look for the micro moments you\nknow like what's the smallest thing and\nfor me where I live I see a lot of\nhummingbirds and butterflies and I just\nI just focus on them\nand I've been doing this for years and\nit's so helpful and about two and a half\nyears ago my dad died and I was an awful\nawful day\nand when I went to bed that night I said\na prayer and then went what went well\ntoday and then the voice in my head you\nknow started criticizing me like you're\na bad kid and you don't love your dad\nand whatever\nbut because it's my habit\nI went what went well today and I saw\nthis interaction between my mother and\nthe police officer and it was so funny\nand so beautiful that just made me smile\nand then I thought of all the texts I\ngot from my friends who found out about\nmy dad and that was peaceful and then I\njust thought about holding his hand\nbefore they took him away and I went to\nsleep\nbecause I'm mastering my mind and not\nbeing a victim of the situation didn't\nmean I didn't grieve I still grieve I\nstill miss him but it's these Habits\nLike every day to direct my mind to help\nme while taking care of my brain yeah I\nlove those practical tools because in\neffect what we're trying to do is change\nour thought pattern right we have a\npattern as you said to wake up and say\nI'm tired\nand we put it on snooze and then we get\nup and then we're having breakfast and\nwe're like I'm still tired and then we\nget to lunch time and we're like looking\nat the clock and we're like I'm still\ntired and then by the end then I'm still\ntired but then we're up at midnight\nwatching Netflix or whatever it may be\nsaying I'm still tired and then that\nbecomes our reality that we just\ncontinue to feed that fatigue and we're\njust more and more and more tired\nwhereas when you nudge your brain in a\ndifferent direction as you said and you\nsaid today's going to be a great day you\nnow start making great choices because\nyou want it to be a great day but what I\nlove about what you've defined and this\nis different and I appreciate it is that\nyou don't talk about positive thinking\nyou talk about accurate thinking as\nbeing a healthier way to live and I\nreally like that clarification because I\nthink the positive thinking approach can\nalso be quite toxic like you just said\nabout your father it's not that you\ndidn't feel grief it's not that you\ndon't miss him like of course those are\nvery real human emotions but you know\nhow to direct them can you clarify for\nour audience today what is the\ndifference between accurate thinking and\npositive thinking or positive thinking\nis I can have this third beer and it\nwon't negatively impact me or I can\ndrive at 125 miles down the freeway in\nthe rain and it won't hurt me positive\nthinking is I can stay up and be on my\nphone until two in the morning and it\nwon't have a negative impact they did\nthis great study out of Stanford Lewis\nTurman 1921\nevaluated 1400 153 10 year old children\nand then they followed them for 90 years\nlooking at what goes with success Health\nand Longevity and the don't worry be\nhappy people actually in the beginning\nof the book I talk about the lies of\nhappiness and this is one of the lies\ndon't worry be happy they died the\nearliest from accidents and preventable\nillnesses I have an older brother and I\nadore him but he's like 150 pounds\noverweight I always sort of wanted to be\nlike him because I'm intense and I work\nhard and I've always got projects and\nhe's like off at three o'clock playing\ngolf and you know he just seemed to not\nhave a care in the world but\nmy health is so much better than his\nbecause I worry about it and so you want\nto have the right dose of anxiety people\nwith low levels of anxiety go to jail\nbecause they don't like think oh if I do\nthis this bad thing could happen but\nobviously too much makes you suffer and\nI love the verse in the New Testament\nJohn 8 32 know the truth and the truth\nwill set you free and I want to live my\nlife in truth so I want to tell myself\nalways so what's the truth so if I think\nTana never listens to me I'm like well\nis that true right it's another little\nhabit right to always carry around those\nthree words I don't have any tattoos but\nif I did is it true would be one of the\ntattoos because I don't want to believe\neverything I think and that's very\nimportant you your mind\ncreate trouble you know thoughts they\ncome from all sorts of places they come\nfrom your ancestors they're actually\nwritten into your genetic code I don't\nknow if you ever read the book it didn't\nstart with you yes of course yeah\namazing I love that book and\ntrauma and successes actually get\nwritten in our genetic code and our\nthoughts come from the voices of our\nmoms our dads our siblings our friends\nfoes the news you listen to which by the\nway is no longer the news anymore let's\njust be really clear they bastardize\nthat industry and it's about tribalism\nand money and it's not about news I\nstart every day with the good news\nnetwork it's just a cool app I have no\nfinancial interest in it I just love it\nI'm always smiling you know sending uh\narticles to my kids and the music you\nlisten to I actually did a study on rap\ncountry rock and classical music and\nheavy metal we did a memory task with\nhigh school students and heavy metal was\nthe worst classical was the best the the\nsecond best was country which shocked us\nwedded wedded rap fall in the uh right\nbehind\num heavy metal oh wow wow because that's\nlike one of the biggest forms of music\ntoday is rap and hip-hop so and music so\ninfluences\nhow we feel and so you want to be\ncareful with the inputs because you\nmight not think they matter but your\nsubconscious mind's listening yeah\nabsolutely well that's why I want to ask\nyou this is really interesting to me\nbecause so I've been listening to Jazz\nin the car now jazz is my new jazz is my\nnew I usually don't listen to anything I\nusually just talk to myself when I drive\nthat's been like my habit for for years\nis I see driving as a moment of\nspending more time with myself so I\ngenerally drive to nothing but when me\nand my wife are in the car together we\nboth like music and recently we've been\nlistening to jazz music together but\nwhat I find really interesting about\nwhat you just said is that there's a\ndifference between what feels good\nand what is good for you\nso someone may say I feel good when I\neat junk food when I listen to music\nthat isn't good for my brain and when I\ndrink but when I miss out on that meal I\ndon't feel good when I choose classical\nmusic I don't feel good and when I\nchoose to eat healthy and maybe don't\ndrink as much I don't feel good and so\nwhat I'm fascinated by is our\nrelationship with feeling a certain way\nversus being a certain way so when I\nstarted to have to remove refined sugar\nfrom my diet which my wife encouraged me\nto do\nI didn't feel good about that like that\nwas painful I didn't enjoy that feeling\nin my mind right or when I started to go\nto the gym every day or hike where I\nhike outside here every day now and when\nI'm working out I don't feel good about\nit but it's good for me so I started to\ndiscover that the things that are\nactually good for me don't always feel\ngood so how do you approach the idea of\nfeeling a certain way because I feel\nlike everything that I do that's good\nfor me I didn't feel good about when I\nstarted doing it now I choose it because\nnow there's because you're getting the\nbenefit correct the benefit I'm also\nfeeling the pattern shift now if I uh so\nI still get a craving for junk food I\nstill have that craving sometimes and\nmaybe once a month now I'll be like or\nI'm gonna have a burger like I'm gonna\neat you know like a burger and fries and\nwhatever and now I don't like the taste\nof it like after I feel really regretful\nand I'm like I didn't even like that I\nneed to remember that then now I've\nchanged my tastes so now it's changed so\ntell talk to me a bit about that like\nwhy do we always want to feel happy and\nfeel good but we don't often make the\nright decisions secret number four is\nlove food that loves you back and during\na relationship I want you to love what\nyou eat but I also want it to love you\nand so if you're in\nlove with alcohol and alcohol is clearly\ntoxic to your brain for so many reasons\nbrain and your body then it's sort of\nlike you're in an abusive\nrelationship and you know I just want\npeople to think about what do you really\nwant do you want that mountain of fries\nor that swimming pool of alcohol or do\nyou want energy do you want Clarity do\nyou want memory do you want Vitality do\nyou want creativity\nand ultimately what what I want\nis I want to feel good\nand I want to be good and I want to do\ngood\nand that comes from a brain and body\nthat work right so I don't want to feel\ngood now but not later right that's a\nfour-year-old's mindset I want to feel\ngood now and later so the things I do\nday in and day out I love now it just it\ntakes a while sometimes to change your\nhabits the brain is lazy\nit just wants to do what you've allowed\nit to do so what you said is just so\nbeautiful it's like well I still get the\ncravings and I'll give in and then I'll\ngo why did I do that yeah that's right I\ngenuinely feel right because then I just\ndon't I just don't feel awesome so for\nthat momentary pleasure\nit's like well is it worth it does it\nfit so another tattoo I'm going to get\nsomeday does it fit so I recommend this\nis actually part of secret seven live\neach day based on clearly defined values\npurpose and goals and quite frankly\nHedonism it's not on my goal list it's\nit's not in my value list and Hedonism\nso giving in to every craving I have is\nthe enemy of happiness because it ends\nup wearing out your dopamine or pleasure\ncenters in your brain and I always talk\nabout you on a drip dopamine don't dump\nit because when you dump it with the\nfries and the alcohol the porn you don't\nhave much left and so then you have to\ngo back and do it again and all of a\nsudden chemicals are controlling you\nrather than you are controlling you the\ndopamine gets so addictive\nand as you said with the pleasure\ncenters now we're having to the same\namount of what we had doesn't even\nfulfill the amount of pleasure so we\nhave to have more to hit the same amount\nof pleasure as far as I understand is\nthat correct like it's absolutely true\nyeah and fame uh wears out the pleasure\ncenters in your brain and I've been\nblessed I mean I'm friends with you\nJustin Miley and and you know we talk\nabout this over and over again how Fame\nis just such a trap because you know\nonce you know like had a video go viral\nand it was like 40 million views and I'm\nlike oh it's so exciting and so when the\nnext one gets eight million views you're\nlike well that sucked and you realize\njust you know how stupid that is you\nhave to be very careful and you want to\ndrip dopamine how do you drip dopamine\nhow does someone do that let's say\nsomeone who's not getting 40 million\nviews or 8 million views but they're\nposting on social media they're eating a\nburger they're having that glass of you\nknow alcohol every night whatever it may\nbe like how does someone learn to I love\nthat idea I'm thinking how does someone\npractically drip dopamine because that's\nreally it's the micro moments of\nHappiness so for me I mean it's like\nholding Tana's hand and then but\nnoticing\nand feeling her skin and feeling the\nwarmth the softness it's it's like being\npresent being connected or seeing the\nhummingbird uh watching the sunrise or\nthe sunset depending on where you live\nit's being present noticing what you\nlike way more than what you don't like\nplus sunlight drips dopamine pumpkin\nseeds drip dopamine\nomega-3 fatty acids I just gave you a\npresent of our vegan\nomega-3 because I know you're vegan and\npeople have been wanting it for so long\nbut all the vegan Omega-3s they don't\nhave EPA in them so Omega-3s there's EPA\nand DHA they're almost all DHA but EPA\nis critical for mood for Focus for\ncirculation and it's the first product\non the market that I'm know of that is\njust loaded with the right balance of\nOmega-3s and what is the difference\nbetween EPA and DHA they work on\ndifferent systems in the body both of\nthem are absolutely essential and\nthey're essential which means you've got\nto get them from an outside Source your\nbody doesn't make them and people who\nare vegan it's really hard to get\nhealthy EPA and DHA levels from flax\nseeds and avocados for example yeah no I\ncan't wait to start taking them I'm\nreally excited what am I going to notice\nwhat's gonna be like well your Skin's\nalready good but your skin your hair\nyour nails that's the things people\nnotice right but their mood is better\nbrand new study out just today\nomega-3 fatty acids help decrease the\nincidence of depression also helps with\nfocus and helps with memory it's just\ncritical because they make up the fats\nin 20 five percent of nerve cell\nmembranes in your brain I mean that's\nhugely important the reason why I find\nthis so fascinating is I think so many\nof us are trying to solve a mental\nchallenge when actually it's a physical\nbrain tangible challenge right like I'll\nmeet a lot of people are saying General\nfeel focused I feel cloudy I feel no\nenergy I feel lethargic what do I do to\nget motivated and it's like well no no\nthe motivation is not the issue it's\nlike you're dealing with a lot of other\nstuff physically tangibly that could be\nsolved and then with good values good\npurpose good goals you can actually go\nin the right direction but just having a\ngood set of goals and targets and values\nis not going to solve the fact that your\nbody is crying out for attention and I\nthink I was definitely in that space for\na long time in my life where I'd like\nhad such a strong mind that I didn't\nrealize how much I was is weakening my\nbrain and that actually if I strengthen\nmy brain my mind was even stronger my\nbody was even better and you know it was\nall interconnected and so\nfor anyone who's who's listening to this\nI want you to remember that if you've\ngot an energy issue a fatigue issue a\nfocus issue like this is the podcast for\nyou like this is what I want you to\nlisten to because chances are it's\nbecause you're missing out on some of\nthis stuff like there's there's a part\nof your diet or something that's not\ngoing into your body well and if you\nthink of it like hardware and software\nyes that setting goals which is so\nimportant and not believing every stupid\nthing you think which we'll talk about\nis so important but those are software\nprograms and you got to have the\nhardware that will run it plus I hate\nthe term mental illness and you and I\nhave talked about that before it's it's\nnot mental it's brain and when you call\nsomeone mental you shame them when you\ncall them a brain you elevate them so we\nneed to change the discussion\num and mental illness is in right\neverybody's talking about their mental\nillness and but it's the wrong\ndiscussion the discussion is about brain\nhealth and yes you have to program it\nbut what's happening in our society now\nit's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nwe're the unhappiest we've been since\nthe Great Depression that depression\ntripled from February of 2020 to August\nof 2020. unbelievable never seen\nanything like that and children suicide\nskyrocketed depression anxiety drug\nabuse skyrocketed and children and it's\nlike\nthe pharmaceutical industry is winning\nthat the incidence of antidepressants\nanti-anxiety medications like Xanax went\nup 20 percent in teenagers that is a\nnightmare because it's the wrong\nsolution and I'm not opposed to\nmedicines it's never the first thing I\nthink about it's like let's get your\nbrain and your habits right and then\nwe'll see what you need and more than\nhalf the people taking medicine really\ndon't need it last year\n337\nmillion prescriptions for\nantidepressants in the United States\nthat's insane that I mean yeah it's\nalarming I think we've all experienced\nit in little\nuh micro doses of our family our friends\nthe news but then when you hear it as a\ncollective it's super painful I mean how\ndoes a society that's going through so\nmuch pain how do we collectively heal\nbecause that's like that we're all we're\nfurther behind because of the pandemic\nit's like it was already tough now we're\nreally dealing with if someone's dealing\nwith a friend or family member or\nsomeone in their life who's going\nthrough that it can feel overwhelming\nfor anyone like not everyone's a trained\npsychiatrist not everyone's trained as a\ntherapist to be able to support that\nkind of individual where would you\nsuggest someone starts if someone in\ntheir life is really spiraling or\nstruggling well I would start by\nfollowing me on Tick Tock or Instagram\nor you happier or the end of mental\nillness there is this is a completely\nnew way to think yeah and I dedicated my\nbook the end of mental illness to my\nnieces and right at the beginning of the\npandemic we adopted them because their\nmom and dad couldn't stop using drugs\nand I am so proud of them because of how\nwell they're doing by just getting\nthe right supervision the right love the\nright food\nand the right habits now they grew up in\ntrauma do you know that Ace test adverse\nchildhood experience oh we should talk\nabout it yeah please\num it's a test and originally done by\nthe CDC and Kaiser and it's ten\nquestions on did you experience early\nchildhood trauma so things like physical\nabuse emotional abuse sexual abuse\nparents who divorce parents who were\naddicted incarcerated you watched one of\nyour parents being beaten in domestic\nviolence okay so 10 of these questions\nso how do you score\ndo you score zero like you had no trauma\nI score one my wife is an eight because\nshe grew up in trauma and she wrote\nabout it in her book The Relentless\ncourage of a scared child the nieces we\nadopted it's a nine if you score four or\nmore\nyou have an increased risk of seven of\nthe top ten leading causes of death if\nyou score six or more you have a twelve\nhundred percent increased risk of\nkilling yourself you have a higher risk\nof depression addiction virtually every\nbad Health thing and our daughter is a\none\nso eight to one that's the goal right\nhow do you take your trauma heal it and\nnot\ngive it to the next generation and when\nI met Tana I just dearly loved her I\nmean she's beautiful she's smart she's\nawesome but when I learned about the\ntrauma I gave her 10 sessions of EMDR\nit's a specific psychological treatment\nfor trauma it stands for eye movement\ndesensitization and reprocessing she\nended up going for a year because there\nare a lot of stuff to work out but\nchange the trajectory of her life she's\nlike my best friend we like never fight\nwe get along we have the same goals we\ndon't live out of the past we live out\nof the present and what we want for the\nfuture\nand so many people live\nwith trauma and they're living being\ncontrolled by the traumatized\neight-year-old in their lives when they\ndon't have to be and so part of being\nhappy is\ndissipating\nthe traumas from the past where can\npeople do that test that sounds\nfascinating the way so they can go\nonline and just search for adverse\nchildhood experiences NPR has a free uh\nversion of it online and you pretty much\nknow once you take it how long does it\ntake to do just like three minutes oh\nwow it's very super it's just 10\nquestions oh wow that's basically yes or\nno but\num but you know if you're a four or more\ngetting help\nand amdr is so cool I want to hear more\nabout it I'm so glad you raised it\nbecause I was like I've I've had a few\nclients I'm coaching right now and\nthey've been working with someone else\nin the EMDR space obviously that's not\nmy expertise but I yeah I wanted to get\nyour thoughts on it like explain if\nanyone who doesn't know what is the EMDR\nnot the name but like what is it as a\npractice\nwhat you do it's actually an eight-step\npractice is you take a good history and\nyou're looking for like what are the top\n10 traumas you've had in your life and\nyou do this with it you do it with a\ntherapist uh with somebody who's trained\nand certified in it then you begin to\nTarget so what's the worst one\nand what's the negative belief with that\nand what's the positive belief that you\nwould rather believe and where do you\nfeel it in your body and so you hold\nthat image and then imagine just being\non a train and we get your eyes to go\nback and forth or sometimes they'll do\nalternate tapping on your knees or this\nthing called The Butterfly hug to do\nalternately while you bring that up and\nwhile you're on the train you just sort\nof see where it goes and it'll often go\nto the early traumas\nheighten them but then with the eye\nmovements it helps the brain integrate\nit from an adult perspective rather than\nliving as a four-year-old's perspective\nand it takes the distress from like an\neight or nine out of ten\nto zero and it's so cool and it's one of\nthe fastest therapies because a lot of\ntimes people go to a therapist and\nthey'll talk about the trauma and they\njust feel worse because what they've\ndone is they've brought it up they've\nlike say subconscious let's pay\nattention to these awful things you've\nbeen trying to forget but it's the\nintegration and I did a study that we\npublished in the Journal of neuros\nPsychiatry and clinical neurosciences a\ngreat journal on eight police officers\nwho were involved in shootings and they\ncouldn't go back to work because they\nwere traumatized because you know\nwhatever you think about the police I\nwork with a lot of police officers most\nof them are just kind caring service\noriented people and they don't want to\nhurt anybody and so they were devastated\ncouldn't go back to work I scanned them\nand in their brain there's a pattern for\ntrauma where there are emotional brain\nwas working too hard and after an\naverage of eight sessions\ntheir brain had calmed down and they all\nwent back to work with EMDR with EMDR\nwow and so and with the MDR there's no\nyou're not under anything there's no\nsubstance it's just no and in fact just\nsitting down talking to you I began I\nmade this connection because what\npsychedelics do and people asking me\nabout that all the time now and I'm not\na fan of it\num because I think it's risky and I get\nto see the Fallout of people doing it\nthat have bad trips what psychedelics do\nis they begin to fill in some of the\nholes and the ruts in your brain like\nyou know if you've been traumatized and\nI'm bad I'm bad I'm bad or it's my fault\nit's my fault my fault it can help\ndissipate that for some people but their\nside effects with EMDR there's no side\neffects and you come out of it Freer so\nmy first experience with EMDR so what I\ndo in my profession is\nyou know I've often said I've been\nbleeding on The Cutting Edge because\npsychiatrists don't look at the brain\nwhich is completely insane but when I\nstarted doing that 30 years ago my\ncolleagues like hated me it's like no\nyou shouldn't do that that's not what we\ndo we make diagnoses based on symptom\nclusters we don't need to know about the\nbrain which I'm like you people are\ninsane but I got investigated by the\nMedical Board in California for like a\nyear it was the worst year of my life\nand I had an EMDR therapist working for\nme in my office and one day I went into\nDr Lendl and I'm like I am not okay do\nthis thing on me and after an hour I\nleft her office and I didn't care I'm\nlike it'll whatever will happen will\nhappen you know I love to say my friend\nByron Katie says argue with reality\nWelcome to Hell\nand my anxiety just went away and\nultimately\nthey dismissed any complaint against me\nand I've obviously been doing this a\nlong time but I just saw how powerful it\nwas I didn't have to stay attached to\nthe pain I I mean I'm fascinated to try\nit myself now and and like I think\nthat's the only way to know and I but\nit's great to hear that again I just to\nclarify I think what you're saying is\nthat this is a great practice it helps\nyou move along and then all the habits\nstill have to be in place because do you\nfeel like people doing it yeah right\nit's like others you can just go back\nand like well like dancing is a great\nbrain exercise but if you drink while\nyou dance you're completely messing up\nthe benefit yeah yeah that's great\ntabletops brand new study out today I'm\nso excited that um Rocket Sports people\nwho play racquet sports live longer than\neverybody else 16 longer longer than\nRunners longer than anybody else I love\nthat because I play ping pong tennis and\npickleball\nbut no I literally pay I play all three\nof those I'm getting a ping pong table I\nplay tennis and I start playing\npickleball and it's like it's so much\nfun it's easy you only need one other\nperson easy to do and they're good for\nyou and it's fun and you don't need to\nbe that good yeah and it loves you back\nyeah so you just have to find what are\nthose habits what are those activities I\nlove that love me back yeah that's\nfantastic I want to let everyone know if\nyou don't have you happier already which\nis the book that we're talking from make\nsure you grab a copy because we're you\nknow literally touching the surface but\nthe lies of Happiness are fantastic\nthere are 11 lies in here that we're\ntold we've talked about a lot of them\ntoday having more and having more of\nsomething like love sex Fame drugs uh\ndon't worry be happy we talked about\nthat positivity mindset we talked about\nadvertisers and fast food we talked\nabout needing you know Tech technology\nwe talked about and we'll talk a bit\nmore about that too we talked about\nconstantly being in the news constantly\nbeing aware of the news we talked about\nalcohol marijuana we've touched on a lot\nof those lies but I really want you to\ndive into it because I think those lies\nare what's governing our Pursuits but\nfocusing on the seven secrets of\nHappiness to talk about that no one else\nis talking about you said the brain\nneeds targeted nutrients every day to\nboost happiness what are some of those\ntargeted nutrients because you also gave\nme along with the vegan omegas you also\ngave me theanine could you tell us a bit\nabout why that's so awesome for calm\nClarity and focus well especially if you\ntend to be anxious right theanine from\ngreen tea\nhelps you focus and calm you at the same\ntime and yes green tea does have a\nlittle bit of caffeine but why green tea\nis better than coffee is the theanine\nhelps calm down the effects of the\ncaffeine and but theanine by itself is\njust magical for so many of my patients\nand those gummies they taste great and\nthey have no sugar right because sugar\nfor me would be a brand violation and we\ndon't do brand violations where does\ncanine come from what is it from Green\nTea okay that's where it comes from\nright yeah it's one of the active\ningredients in green tea green tea\ncatechins are another uh great substance\nfor your brain my favorite of all of\nthem we talked about Omega-3s but my\nfavorite is saffron and I've been\nfollowing the science of saffron for\nover 20 years because over 20 years ago\na study came out showing it was equally\neffective to Prozac and I'm like whoa\num and there's folklore in India India\nyeah my mom is gonna love this moment of\nthis podcast she tells me it's saffron\nall the time that if you're too happy\nyou must have had saffron so now there\nare 24\nrandomized controlled trials head to\nhead against antidepressants showing\nthat it's equally effective to boost\nyour mood but as opposed to\nantidepressants which can decrease\nsexual function saffron increases sexual\nfunction increases pleasure increases\nresponsiveness even in some studies\nsperm motility\nsaffron has been shown to enhance memory\nand I'm like memory mood and sex and at\nthe beginning of the pandemic right when\nmy dad was sick I'm like I make\nsomething called happy saffron with\nsaffron zinc and curcumin I've taken it\nevery day since and I just think it's\njust a nice thing to help keep people\nbalanced but then the supplements in\nlarge part depend on your brain type so\nthat's secret number two is what makes\nsome people happy makes other people\nmiserable and a one-size-fits all with\nhappiness is just not reality some\npeople need novelty and they love\nsurprises where it's type two there's\nfive primary types that's our\nspontaneous type\nbut type 3 the persistent type they hate\nsurprises and love routine and so know\nyour type and the type of your spouse\nand children and then ask yourself every\nday I do something that makes me\nuniquely happy and this book's going to\nhelp people figure out their type you\nhave the types in the book so we have\nthe balanced brain type the spontaneous\nbrain type the persistent brain type\nsensitive brain type at the cautious\nbrain type and the book helps you\ndiagnose and figure out which brain type\nyou have so you can do this with your\nfriends your family your partner your\nyour kids and that's going to help you\nunderstand what they need more of or\nwhat they're missing in fact my nieces\nthey had friends over and they were in\nthe spa at home and they were taking the\nace quizzes with their friends and\nknowing each other's brain type it was\nsuch a great discussion yeah I love that\nhow do people as in walk us through some\nof the process you created to help\npeople figure out their brain type well\nyou know based on my Imaging work yeah\nI'm like I was looking initially for the\none type of you know where's depression\nin the brain and then I realize oh\nthere's not one type of depression\nthere's seven where is add in the brain\nwell there's not one type of ADD they're\nseven that's why Ritalin is\ncontroversial for some people it's a\nmiracle for other people it's a\nnightmare and it depends on how your\nbrain works and then I realized I was\nseeing patterns of Personality like if\nyour frontal lobes work too hard you\ntend to be worried and rigid and if\nthings don't go your way you're upset\nand I have of my five girls two of them\nhave this pattern and I know no matter\nwhat I say to them they're gonna dismiss\nit it's gonna bounce off it's like they\nwear Teflon and so for like shopping I\nlove shopping with my girls and I go oh\ndo you like this the answer will be\nimmediately no so for them I know their\ntype and I wait for them to show me\nstuff and if I want them to do something\nI'll actually ask them the opposite of\nwhat I want them to do because they're\njust you know these people they're just\nsort of naturally oppositional and if I\nwant them to go to the store with me I'm\ngoing to go I'm going to go to the store\nyou probably don't want to go with me\nyeah it's like what do you mean I don't\nwant to go with you we don't spend any\ntime together\nthat approach of personalization and\nindividualization is just so needed\nespecially in healthcare because like\nyou're saying you can and that's what me\nand my wife see that in us like odd\ndiets are completely different for us to\nbe an optimal level and our workouts are\ncompletely different like my wife is a\nhigh intensity workout person I'm a low\nintensity workout person I just don't\nenjoy high intensity it doesn't work for\nme I I feel more inflamed I feel you\nknow more heated in my body where I\ndon't need that I'm pretty you know\nactive heat as it is and then my wife\nreally enjoys it it's really great for\nher body she feels great for men so I\njust think it's so fascinating that we\nkeep trying to take like whatever works\nfor everyone must work for me and we get\nthis trend or this fad and I think this\ndiagnosis of your brain type though I\nthink this is the best thing that you\npossibly could have done for us the\npersistent people they need carbs they\nif you put them on a ketogenic diet they\nget depressed and they get angry I was\non Rachel Ray's show and she was the\npersistent brain type and on national TV\nwe're talking about this and she said I\nwent on a low carb diet and I was so\nmean I wondered why my husband didn't\nleave me because the persistent brain\ntype needs serotonin and if you think\nabout a higher protein lower simple\ncarbohydrate diet it's a dopamine diet\nit helps you focus but if you give it to\nthe persistent type they focus more on\nthe things that make them unhappy and\nmake other people unhappy so the wrong\ndiet can cause divorce and so you have\nto like Target it to the person but it's\nalso why people get addicted to Sugar\nbecause sugar is a simple carbohydrate\nand sugar raises serotonin and it makes\nyou happy have you ever wondered when\nyou go to a restaurant why they\nimmediately give you bread and alcohol\nbecause both of them drop your frontal\nlobe so the bread simple carbohydrate\nraises your blood sugar and your\npancreas sees it and produces insulin\ninsulin drives tryptophan into your\nbrain tryptophan makes serotonin and you\nfeel pretty happy which is why people\nget addicted to pastries and bread and\npizza and donuts and then they give you\nalcohol because it drops your frontal\nlobes so if they give you free bread and\noffer you alcohol they're going to make\nmore money because you're going to order\nthings you said before you walked into\nthe restaurant you weren't going to\norder including dessert that is so true\nand I love it when they give me bread\nit's like my favorite but it's not\nanymore but that's like my favorite\nthing that I love it when I walk into a\nrestaurant I'm like do you have a bread\nbasket like you know it's such a it's\nsuch a habit right it's it's all habits\nwhat\nI find that happiness is such an\ninteresting goal that's what I meant by\nlike we want to feel happy\nbut the things that you have to do to\nfeel happy are not necessarily the\nthings you want to do if something like\ninitially initially that's what I'm\nsaying until it switches until it\nswitches and oh by the way and I start\nthe book with this happiness is a moral\nobligation because you know people like\noh you're writing a book on happiness\nthat's fluff can't you do something more\nserious and I'm like but it's a moral\nobligation why because of how you affect\nother people I guarantee you if you ask\nsomeone who was raised by an unhappy\nparent or married to an unhappy spouse\nor raising an unhappy child whether or\nnot happiness is an ethical issue so\nthis is important uh for us to seek\nhappiness in the context of Health\nunbelievable everyone that is Dr Daniel\nAmen speaking about you happier this is\nthe book I genuinely genuinely recommend\nthis book I think you know so there's\ncertain books that will just transform\nhow you think about your brain I know\nthat working with Dr Danny Layman has\nbeen really powerful for my brain so\nmany of the habits I've developed\nconsciously or subconsciously have\nhappened through our conversations I\nmean when you told me about uh Rocket\nSports that's what led me to start\nplaying tennis and then I started\nplaying pickleball and then I picked I'm\ngetting a ping pong table and it was\njust there were these really tiny things\nthat we've exchanged in our\nconversations that have made huge\ndifferences in my life and so today when\nyou told me I look great I was like yeah\nthanks to you Dr Dennis because of you\nuh but I want you to go and grab this\nbook The Seven Neuroscience secrets of\nfeeling good based on your brain type\nthe book's called you happier uh Dr Dan\nLehman you'll know uh this will be no\nsurprise to you we end every interview\nwith a fast five which is our final five\nuh every time that we do this so you\nhave to figure out new answers every\ntime you come on uh but these are your\nFast Five so the first question is what\nis the best brain advice you've ever\nheard receive or given every day ask\nyourself this question is this good for\nmy brain or bad for it it's so simple\nit's the mother tiny Habit to have a\ngreat brain for the rest of your life\nokay second question what is the worst\nbrain\nhabit advice you've ever received so\nwhat is worse brain advisory you've ever\nreceived everything in moderation which\nis the Gateway thought to hell it's the\nGateway thought to cheating as soon as\nyou hear someone say everything in\nmoderation they're going to do something\nbad for their brain wow explain let's\nlet's dive into that a little bit\nbecause I feel like that's such a common\nmisconception that people have oh I need\nto have a balanced life and a balanced\ndiet right so yeah but balance for them\nwhen they're saying moderation means\nsugar right or it means alcohol or it\nmeans marijuana or all the things that\ndoesn't matter well it means Comfort\nit's their excuse it's it's one of the\nlittle lies people tell themselves that\nkeep them fat depressed and\nfeeble-minded yeah let's let's do I\nactually want to take a little segue\nlet's talk a bit about marijuana because\nI think that that's become so popular I\ndid it a bit as a kid I messed around\nwith MIT means I never really got into\nit you did my brain scan there's no\nthere's no signs of it because I was\nnever too deep into it uh and obviously\nsince I lived as a monk I don't I don't\nmess around with anything so I haven't\nyou know I haven't drank alcohol for\n16 years or something like that and like\nno marijuana for 16 years\num but what is marijuana doing because I\nfeel like so many people do\nfeel like they need it or like it's\nbenefiting their life or it's become so\nnormal now like what are the chat what\nare the issues well they need it because\nit changes their brain to need it in\norder to feel normal what is it doing it\nin a way to make people feel like it's\nhelpful what's calming things down right\nin the brain so I published a study on a\nthousand marijuana users every area of\ntheir brain is lower in activity and\nthen I published the world's largest\nImaging study on 62\n454 scans looking at how the brain ages\nand I looked at well what accelerated\naging and marijuana was the second worst\nthing to accelerate aging the worst\nthing was having schizophrenia but the\nsecond worst thing it surprised me quite\nfrankly it was worse than alcohol worse\nthan marijuana it dulls slows down nerve\ncell firing so if you have a busy brain\nand you're anxious you feel like it's\nhelpful but it's also been shown to\ndamage some of the structure of neurons\nand kids who smoke or use have an\nincreased incidence of anxiety\ndepression and suicide in their 20s kids\nwho use have a 450 percent increase risk\nof developing psychosis and people have\nbeen I've been a psychiatrist 40 years\nwe've all seen cases like that their\ncases now because marijuana is so much\nmore potent than it was when I was\ngrowing up that there's a word called\nscrometing which is screaming and\nvomiting at the same time that if you're\nin an emergency room people like oh oh\nthis person's poisoned with marijuana\nnot to mention the 1700 percent increase\nin babies being born with marijuana and\nthe trouble that that causes it's like\npeople go to that before\nthey learn diaphragmatic breathing\nbefore they learn meditation before they\nlearn self-hypnosis before they go for\nEMDR to deal with their traumas and\nthat's just not right\nlike let's do the non-toxic things first\nrather than you know and that's my\nproblem with psychedelics it's like you\nknow maybe at some point if you have\nsevere PTSD that's not responding to\nanything that could be helpful but have\nyou done the basics first yeah and the\nchallenge I find that most people say is\nthat non-toxic things are slow you have\nto learn something right it's not\nimmediate like meditation for example or\nas you know meditation let's take uh\nwhat was the first thing you said you\nsaid um diaphragmatic breathing I can\nget you to break a panic attack in two\nminutes yeah if I just get you to\nbreathe yeah four seconds in hold it for\na second eight seconds out hold it for a\nsecond do that for three minutes you're\ngonna feel so much better so much calmer\nthis isn't hard yeah but it's not taught\nand so people don't know oh yeah and\nthen they're like so where's my dealer\nthat's the hard part that's the hard\npart we're not taught and then we go for\nthe quick fix and then we get addicted\nto the Quick Fix because it's a quick\nfix and then that becomes our reality\nand that's right but there are other\nquick fixes that are quick yeah if we\njust are taught yeah\num like you know one of my favorite\nthings is killing the ants the automatic\nnegative thoughts whenever you feel sad\nmad nervous write down what you think\njust write it down and then go is it\ntrue and then write the opposite Tana\nnever listens to me Tana does listen to\nme and then go\nis that true and you'll often find the\nopposite of the thought that's torturing\nyou\nis true\nI do that all the time with my wife I\nfeel the same way doing with your spouse\nis very helpful when I'm like all righty\ndoesn't care about me and then yeah\nasking myself right he does Carol yeah\nlike oh I can find lots of reasons yeah\nit's it's beautiful and then you don't\nhave to believe yeah the negativity\nbecause where you look determines how\nyou feel if you find the negative you're\ngoing to feel negative and if you find\nthe beautiful you're gonna feel\nbeautiful absolutely all right question\nnumber three this is that was a great\ntangent I'm glad we did that uh question\nnumber three\nuh what is your current purpose how do\nyou define it my current purpose is to\nchange how psychiatric medicine is\npracticed to take it out of the Dark\nAges to end the whole concept of mental\nillness and create a revolution in brain\nhealth\nI love that what a great purpose uh\nwe're here to support we have a big Gala\nI'm so excited December 7th at the\nBeverly Hilton Hotel uh the end of\nmental illness uh we're going to be\nwhat's the goal of that what's the\nwhat's the purpose you didn't have in so\nthe purpose of the event is to really\nraise money for the foundation for\nresearch and the whole concept of mental\nillness for Education we actually have a\nnew preschool course to teach kids to\nlove their brain called brain Thrive by\nfive and service to raise money\nespecially for First Responders because\nyou know they got hurt really bad in the\npandemic uh so that they can get this\nnew brain health way we're so excited\nCarrie Anna Nava is going to be the\nemcee of the event Miley Cyrus says\nshe's going to come so we're excited\nawesome congrats very excited for that\nI've got two more questions for you then\nI'll let you there you go all right\nquestion number four is\num and is that something everyone can\ncome to by the way that's yeah it's a\npublic event so we're gonna\num start advertising it soon perfect\nDecember 7th December 7th Beverly 2022\nBeverly Hilton Hotel it's a public event\nthat people can buy tickets to come to\nright to support the cause that you just\nmentioned correct amazing love that uh\nwe'll put the details in the notes as\nwell so everyone has them question\nnumber four what's something you wish\nyou knew about the brain earlier in your\nown life so 1991 I'm 37 and I'm a double\nboard certified psychiatrist I was the\ntop Neuroscience student in medical\nschool\nand I don't care about my brain at all\nand I'm like and I was overweight and I\nwas only sleeping four hours a night I\nwas chronically stressed and I scanned\nmy brain because I just started scanning\nso I scanned everybody I knew I scanned\nmy six-year-old mother she had a\ngorgeous brain and when I scanned myself\nit wasn't healthy and I was horrified\nand\num I come from a very competitive family\nand I just really unhappy that my\nsix-year-old mother had a better looking\nbrain than I did so I developed a\nconcept called brain Envy I always say\nFreud was wrong penis envy is not the\ncause of anybody's problem I wanted a\nbetter brain and I think I've spent the\nlast 31 years just trying to get a\nbetter brain wow so you just wish you\nknew about that I wish I knew about that\nearlier I wouldn't have played football\num\nand I wouldn't have drank diet soda like\nit was my best friend do you want to\ntell us a bit about that because I feel\nlike soda people have agreed it's bad\nbut now diet sod has become I used to\nthink diet soda was free right I mean\nit's like no calories but the aspartame\nand what we know now was sucralose is\nreally bad so there's a brand new study\nout looking at sugar\nsucralose or splenda and Stevia and they\ndid brain scans and cognitive testing\nand Stevia nothing happened before or\nafter it seemed actually pretty safe\nthat's amazing sugar new learning\ndropped Splenda was the worst\nnew learning drop long-term memory\ndropped and you got a surge of slow\nfrontal lobe activity which means it\ndeactivated your frontal lobes and I'm\nlike and you know the yellow packets are\neverywhere yeah it's over it's so scary\nit's like I don't know how the I don't\nknow how
