    "transcript": "all suffering is created and it's true\nfor every human being we believe our\nthoughts we suffer we question that we\ndon't suffer so an unquestioned life is\nnot worth living and that's certainly my\nexperience too when you said that you\nwere depressed for over a decade\nand I want to start about asking you how\nwould you describe that chapter of your\nlife\nof of what it felt like and how\ndifferent it is to how you feel now\noh gosh it was it was horrible it is\nsomething that I would never want\nanother human being to have to live\nthrough and and\nin my world people on are experiencing\nthat you know their their emails that\ncome into me and they're they're um\nuh I love my emails that you know there\nis a way out of suffering but I didn't\nknow that and\nto wake up in the morning Jay and\nrealize that I was still breathing felt\nlike\nsomething was intentionally torturing me\nand I was I was so suicidal and and\nagoraphobic so just trapped most of the\ntime in my bedroom and it was it was not\nfun\num let's see describe it to you\num\nmy my self-esteem and self-loathing was\nso strong that I was sleeping on the\nfloor one morning as I usually did and\nnext to my bed because I was so full of\nof um\nself-loathing that I didn't believe I\ndeserved a bed that's the bottom line so\nall I deserved was asleep on the floor\nbut this particular morning\nAs I Lay sleeping on the floor I was in\nlike this dead sleep and a cockroach\ncrawled over my foot I opened my eyes\nand\nI\nbasically\nall the suffering was gone all the\nsuffering was gone and the valuable\nthing\nwas that I saw when I believed my\nthoughts I suffered\nbut when I didn't believe my thoughts I\ndidn't suffer and the way that I saw\nthat is when I opened my eyes the ego\ndid not have opportunity to fill that\nspace\nand everything was present\nand in that I began to laugh it was like\nI got the joke\nI got it and I saw you know it I\nwhat I was thinking and believing was\nthe cause of my suffering and then the\nwork was born on the floor in in that\nmoment you know it was it was how how\nall suffering is created and it's true\nfor every human being we believe our\nthoughts we suffer we question that we\ndon't suffer so\num I some great minds said an\nunquestioned life is not worth living\nand that's certainly my experience too\nthat's that's incredible that you were\nable to buff a whole new way of thinking\nin that moment and I wonder what would\nthose thoughts that you are believing at\nthat time where were they coming from\nwas it family was it parenting was it\nrelationships\nit was from me it was\num there's something terrible is going\nto happen there's something wrong with\nme the the world doesn't really care\nabout me no one cares about anyone on on\nhe doesn't care about me and I can't do\nit all these and I didn't even know what\nthe it was most and that I couldn't do\nbut it was just this this crazy and the\neffect of believing those thoughts is\num Depression was depression and guilt\nand insanity and from that moment on the\nfloor\nanytime\nmy head we would say thoughts would hit\nis it true it would just the thoughts\nwould happen like something terrible is\ngoing to happen and it would evaporate\nit couldn't continue after that moment\non the floor\nand so when people began to ask me which\nwas really strange and agoraphobic being\nasked anyone being in touch with an\nagoraphobic is pretty rare but uh people\nbegan to just\num call me from all over the world it\nwas just you know just one by one by one\nand\num and ask what you know could they come\nlive with me you know the strangest\nquestions and\num I didn't know if it was the water I\nwas drinking the food I was eating I had\nbecause everything had so radically\nflipped just like from one polarity to\nthe other and but then when they'd asked\nwhat happened\nand they would they would say uh life\nisn't worth living and it would blow my\nmind because I knew they knew better\nI I knew they knew better because I'm\nstill I once you know your own true\nnature you see it in everyone and\neverything and so I began to show them\nthe experience on the floor I asked the\nquestions like something terrible is\ngoing to happen\nlike they would say something terrible\nis going to happen and I would say is it\ntrue and that puts them on the floor not\nliterally but it puts them into that\nexperience on the floor and then how do\nyou react what happens when you believe\nthe thought and then they become aware\nof in that meditative State how do I\nreact when I believe the thought of\nseeing those images of the past not now\nand the future not now\nand and it moves their focus and\nattention from presence where the given\nlife is the blessed life is right here\nright now without\nbeing so convoluted or we're not\nconfused when we are present and\nwhatever we need to do can be done there\nand everything to do it with is also\npresent and then that third question how\ndo you react when you believe the\nthought they become aware of the images\nand what they believe onto the images\nso we have the the the image of let's\nsay this morning at breakfast and we see\nthat image of that past and then we\nbelieve words\nonto that image and then the imagined\nlife is created and really that is all\nof life that most humans understand it\nkeeps us like in the not now in the not\nnow that paths Future Past future that\nis not is not and and and the movie\nis so it's so\nall encompassing we really like I see me\nat breakfast but I really believe that's\nme even though I can't take it out of my\nhead I can't touch it I can't move it I\ncan't I can't throw it like there's no\nthat's not I so that me of the past me\nof the future now there's three of me\nand now all of these paths there are a\nmillion of me there are million of me in\nthe future to say who am I and if we\njust who would it be that fourth\nquestion who would I be without the\nthought\nsomething terrible is going to happen\nfor example dealing with that one and it\njust it just drops the image of the of\nthe past where something terrible\nhappened the future where it's going to\nhappen it dissolves the nothing all\nthose eyes and the answer to who am I\nit's pretty\njust\nand then\npeople are taking this on as a practice\nand as they do take it on as a practice\nthey see these horrors of the the guilt\nof the past and the horrors of the\nfuture and they are awake too not I not\nI not I not I the all them not now so\nthey are with the one they love the\nBeloved themselves awake to the given\nyou know the love of life not life\nimagined but the love of of oh you know\nyou know Jay you you know of all people\nwhat it's like to see\nto see\nit's oh my goodness I could add stuff to\nit like it Sparkles it shines and it's\nnone of those things and it's all of\nthose things and it's and it's humbling\nit's it's\nbeing gifted and so I understand why\npeople want to be in the now but how and\nof course I was shown this one way and\nthere are so many beautiful ways it\ndoesn't have to be just this or just\nthat there's something for everyone and\nand\num\nand what I love about inquiry is it\nworks with everything\nit's not it doesn't oppose anything it\ndoesn't even say answer me you know it\njust is like like given freely and so it\num after all these years you know more\nthan three decades still excites me just\nto answer your question and feel like\nI'm taking over your entire program\nI I love listening it's beautiful and\nwhat I'm hearing so wonderfully is when\nthese questions and you use the word\ninquiry it's like when these questions\nare these\ngenuine sincere requests and Americans\nas opposed to these demands and I feel\noften our questions in the world are\ndemands to the universe as opposed to\nthese inquiries and so we often ask\nquestions we're always asking questions\nyeah even with our thoughts but often\nwe're asking demanding questions like\nwhy is this happening to me when is this\ngoing to end yeah why is this not\nstopping and those are not really\nquestions they're rhetorical demands\nyeah and and I find that when we ask\nquestions like that we know that let\nalone the universe even our friends\nwould not respond to questions like that\nbecause they're not really looking for\nan answer and so you I love the way\nyou're reminding us now tell us Katie if\nsomeone right now and you have shown us\nthe work you've told us about the\nquestioning process but if someone right\nnow is and especially right now is going\nthrough anxiety depression suffering\nfrom mental health they are looking at\nthe scenario of the world and they're\nhaving those thoughts yes and and one\nwould say they're very valid to have\nthose thoughts especially right now and\nthere have been multiple times in\nhistory what would be the first thing\nyou would say\nthat they need to do in order to realize\nthat there is hope for them because I\nthink for so many people they get to\nthis point where they believe their\nthoughts so much that they feel there is\nno hope left and there's no chance just\nlike you were saying you fell\nI would say first get in touch with your\nemotions because they're the most\nthey're the closest thing to you and\nwhat blocks us from my emotions what\nstops us from them\nthe truth sets me free and and that's my\nexperience\nunless it's drugs\nalcoholics you know what you know we do\nour best\nand so I tried all of that and I did it\nwell and it took me literally to the\nfloor but I would say get in touch with\nyour emotions like when we're angry for\nexample we feel it and we dance and so\nto first get in touch with your emotions\nin other words notice notice\nand then move up to your head\nand notice because those emotions let\nyou know remind you of what you're\nthinking and believing is the cause of\nyour suffering\nand so then you can identify the\nthoughts you're thinking\nand then don't trust them to stay\nmove them from your head to paper\nand then\num sit with those four questions with\num like he doesn't care about me\nthat belongs on paper and then you\nquestion it using these four questions\nand and turnarounds and the turnarounds\nare just finding opposites so it's all\nalways free anything I have a value if\nif I have something of value it's always\nfree on byronkady.com and or the\nwork.com and and how to do this is there\nbecause if someone who had told me you\nknow when you feel your emotions just\njust get in touch with them and what are\nyou thinking and believing I would I\nwould I would say give me a cigarette\nand in the days we used to smoke yeah\nand I I love that about getting it down\ninto paper I think it's so important to\nget out of all heads and you know when\nthings are in your mind you think that\nthey're there but they can get cumulated\nand polluted and so yeah I often say to\npeople as well which I love is getting\nout on the paper is almost sometimes a\nvoice noting and recording your own\nvoice and hearing it it puts you in such\nan absorb\nwhen you can hear yourself you can hear\nwhat you're really trying to say and or\nyou're really trying to communicate it's\nalmost like hearing in between the lines\nfor yourself same with writing it down\nwhen you can read out to yourself I\nthink those are such powerful tools I I\nlove it when I've heard you say that to\njudge people is to keep them separate\nfrom me\nand and I like that so much especially\nright now because I feel that judgment\nis what creates so much divide and\nsometimes even even what I find is more\nsubtle is Judgment of judgment\nso so it's we think that we are being\nright by judging but actually we're\nsimply judging someone for their\njudgment if you know what I mean it\nkeeps us separate it is the sense I put\nbetween you and me and and I feel that\nseparation so I'm just going to come at\nyou whether you like it or not until you\nunderstand me but it's my sense I have\nput up\nbetween us\nthe cause of all suffering is what we're\nthinking and believing so what you and I\nare talking about right now is the cause\nof suffering\nit's it's what we're thinking and\nbelieving that is attachment you know\nthe Buddha talks about attachments\nreligions talk about attachment and and\num gosh something there's something else\nbut we'll say attachment and and\num\non\nwhat we're talking about is the most\nimportant thing to identify what we're\nthinking of believing is to identify the\ncause of suffering and to question it\nis to set ourselves free and to question\nthat really is a meditative process for\nexample if I think there's\nthis is a terrible place this world is a\nterrible place\nmy mind will show me all the images of\nthe past the prove it and the future\nthat says it's going to happen again\nit proves it what we're thinking of\nbelieving is proven within us but it's\nas we say nowadays fake news it's fake\nnews and because it's not real it's it's\nImaging it's dreaming it's the dream\nworld so to ask is it true begins to\nwake us up to reality and the valid\nanswer we when we ask is it true to\nmeditate to get still in that and not to\nask the question of ourselves if we\ndon't really want what we're asking to\nmeet the question and what we're asking\nto meet the question is that don't know\nworld that is so unavailable to us when\nwe are living as Believers in these\nthese terrifying depressive uh states of\nmind what are some beliefs that we\nshould have then because if we have if\nwe're believing\nso many of the wrong thoughts what are\nsome of the thoughts that we should\nbelieve is there well words become like\num matches for on our true nature\nand are a match to the heart like\num if I think there's something wrong\nwith him or her or them you know a\nsociety for example but there's\nsomething wrong with him then my mind\nimmediately shows me all the proof\nand but it's not proof it's a state of\nmind\nand then it shows me the future where\nhe's going to do that to me too you know\nthat's going to happen here too and so I\ndon't see that him I'm with I see who I\nimagine him to be so that's who I'm\ntalking to so I'd like to say no two\npeople have ever met we're crazy we are\ntalking to a phantom and we're so\nconvinced and and\num so you know this this work wakes us\nup wakes me up to reality and I forgot\nyour question actually slipped\nno no that was beautiful I my question\nwas\nbecause you're saying that we sometimes\nbelieve our negative thoughts and that's\nwhat creates our suffering oh the\nreplacement so are there any thoughts\nthat we should have are there any\nbeliefs we should have well let's let's\nsay um I think there's something wrong\nwith him and is it true\ncan I really know this how do I react\nwhen I believe the thought I see that\npast future and a gene and all of that\nwho would I be without it and I'm just\nmeditating dropping my story dropping\nthat identification on him taking all\nthe Post-its I believed on to him and I\njust see him\nand I see him\nand with without what I'm believing on\nto him and then when I turn it around\nthere's something wrong with him turned\naround there's something wrong with me\nand I'm not exchanging one belief for\nanother I am I am going to try it on as\nthough it were on a shoe I tried on and\nI fell in love with in a shoe store I\ndon't know if it fits I've got to try it\non so uh there's something wrong with\nhim turn around there's something wrong\nwith me I'm going to try it on now in\nthat situation with him there's\nsomething wrong with me\nokay my attitude\nI was experiencing a little fear a lot\nof Separation there's something wrong\nwith me\nI see him differently when I dropped my\nstory on him\nthat was mine there's something wrong\nwith me so I am meditating in a moment\nin time\nand I'm present\nand if I see something\nif I see something unacceptable in my\nworld I Look to me I don't look to other\npeople they cannot give me the answers\nthat I'm seeking and often they say\nthings that enlighten me that wake me up\nthat change my life\nbut I'm the one that heard them and as\nI'm in a hurry I was in a hurry and and\nI was\nI was\nI was granted a a gift and it came\nfreely and now that belongs to everyone\nand no one has to be open to it either\nbut I just know my job like you know\nyours we're we know our jobs we\nimmediately give the gift and and and we\nit grows in US each time we do and what\nabout so many people I hear today who\nare\nreconnecting with some of the pains in\ntheir childhood that they may not have\neven been aware of so when we look at uh\nchildhood trauma we look at abandonment\nissues we look at the feeling of not\nfeeling nurtured like we look at the\nfeeling of being rejected or neglected\nas a child and we carry this and yes\nyes sometimes we don't become aware of\nit until we're much older so true how\ndoes someone go about processing that\nbecause I feel that that also reflects\nin the type of Partners we choose for\nourselves\ncommunication with our friends and our\ncolleagues it creates so many issues it\naffects everything it affects our\nidentification the people I work with\nthat so that they understand how to work\nwith it themselves is I and I asked them\nto go into like go into the trauma get\ninto the center of that trauma where it\nwas the most painful and identifying\nmeditating in that situation and that's\nasking a lot\nbut to go back into that situation and\nidentify what they were thinking and\nbelieving then because what they were\nthinking and believing then was the\ncause of the trauma no matter what that\nperson did to me what I was thinking and\nbelieving was the cause of my trauma so\nI identified those thoughts I write them\ndown and I have a judger neighbor\nworksheet on my website people can\ndownload or work it there and and and\nit's a form with six questions\nthat include in allow us\nto recall what we were thinking and\nbelieving then right so um so that\nsupports it and then there are their\nthoughts what they were thinking and\nbelieving them the cause of the trauma\nand um and then they question those\nthoughts and they question it from a\nmeditative state from that situation\nfrom the center of that that terrible\nsituation it doesn't mean the other\nperson isn't guilty\nbut it's still what Still Remains is\nwhat I was thinking and believing is the\ncause of my suffering so I question\nthose thoughts and and the trauma breaks\nand um and I am enlightened to the cause\nof my suffering\nand that's what I was thinking believing\nand then there I have a lot to do I have\na lot to do after that it's another\nworksheet and another worksheet and you\nknow my mother uh for example said\num one day that's that's hypothetically\nsay she said Byron Kathleen and I'm just\na little kid I'm just googoo gaga\nand and it doesn't mean anything to me\nand she says Byron Kathleen and it means\nnothing to me and then let's say three\nweeks go by and she says Byron Kathleen\nand then one of my siblings say Byron\nKathleen and and it and my mother says\nit my father says it and then one day my\nmother says it\nand I believe\nI believe and prior to that I was not\nwow the moment I believed\nI am\nand the same with I'm a female I'm this\nage I have this color here I have this\ncolor skin I have this and now you have\nthis and you are that and you are that\nso I'm multiplying like being in a\nmirror and and the whole world is\nreflecting what I believe back to me so\nto go back to the beginning and and and\nand and and and question you know my\nname is Byron Kathleen you know and\nthat's so close to the ego I don't\ninvite people to go there but if you're\nlet's say you you're raising children oh\nI just I just this work is free all it\nwill cost you is your identity and leave\nyou in a Kinder one\nthat is so powerful what you were just\nsaying there about constantly taking\nback to when what was your belief at\nthat time what were your thoughts and\nyour belief at that time because there\nare so many times when we believe and we\nhave created a thought that we trust\nthis person yet we never knew if they\nwere trustworthy we never allowed them\nto earn our trust we just gave it to\nthem and then we wonder why they broke\nit and it's because at that time we\nchose to give them our trust when we\nconsider what we were thinking and\nbelieving you know we look to ourselves\nthey didn't they didn't call me into\ntrusting them I believed this this and\nthis and\nI trusted that yeah now you say in that\nregard you also say that there's nothing\nthat isn't a gift uh it's a friendly\nUniversity yes oh my gosh yes it was a\nfriendly Universe I get goosebumps just\njust um hearing it from you it is a\nfriendly universe and but what I'm\nthinking and believing about this about\nthis the universe could use a little\nwork if I don't love it\nas it is\nand and we question what we're thinking\nand believing about life and it leaves\nus in a friendly universe\nit's it's the most it's a radical thing\nto wake up to reality no downside it's\nhard to accept because of our desire to\ncontrol\nand our desire for my ego for things to\nbe the way we want them to be yeah our\ndesire to be God right and and that's uh\nand and our desire to be God is on is an\nhonest thing it's just flipped Into The\nego's Possession so it's um so we\nquestion what we're believing and\num we become very humbled and then\neventually we see that that we oh boy\nthis is this is um\nthis is wild but still it's like I I\nbelieved this universe into being\nand if I don't love it I need to\nquestion my universe and that means\nquestion what I believed about you about\nme about them about it about God about\neverything and wake up to reality\nand without any preconceived idea about\nwhat it is\nand in my experience it's nameless\nanyway nameless would take away from the\nbeauty it is that beautiful and to even\nclaim it is\nsays what it isn't it's more than that\nit's it's um\nit's disrespectful for me to even\nattempt it's more beautiful than that\nand I love I know that my community will\nbe really interested in this case is how\ndoes this then affect our relationships\nand our communication with those that we\nlove\nhowever Closer Closer Closer Closer no\nspace no no distance no no separation\njust living out of our true nature and\ntrusting that it's a fear of the state\nof mind which means that there's nothing\nwe cannot accomplish you know we want to\naccomplish something\nif we don't we consider and we consider\nwhat we were thinking and believing that\nstops US\nthen\ninquiry leaves us in this Fearless State\nof Mind\nand it's\num and it's really good to be clear what\nyou're going after\nyou know what it is you really want\nand so for me that's um that's that's a\npart of the journey I want people people\nto be free and um and and why I'm why am\nI why am I doing what I do because I\nhave seen they're already free that\nleaves me jobless they're already free\nand then I discovered that that that\nwhat we're thinking and believing what\npeople are thinking and believing is the\nonly prison they've got so I see like on\ntelevision hungry children people\nsuffering and I have been in some of\nthose positions\nand I have set in the in the center of\nthose experience and identified what I\nwas thinking and believing and other\nthan that I was okay\nso I understand\nthat the world is\nagain it's a it's a friendly Universe\nJay and I'm very open to\num to it not being so I continue to test\nit and your test seems to be proving\nyour hypothesis correct um I see a lot\nof good\nI I would say I see only good in\nanything less than that I question\nI love what you say about the three\nbusinesses\nuh can you share about the three\nbusinesses yeah I really like that if if\nI look at it at um and like my daughter\nlet's say one of my the way she's\nraising her children for example or one\nof my sons there are three kinds of\nbusiness in all of the universe there's\nmine yours and gods and that's the god\nof your understanding and if I'm\nmentally in my daughter's business I'm\nsitting here with you but mentally I'm\nin her house\nknowing how she should raise her\nchildren knowing what she should do all\nof all of this I'm talking to you but\nI'm over there in my daughter's business\nso if I'm feeling disconnected from you\nI can just ask myself mentally whose\nbusiness am I in and notice and emotions\nwill let me know for sure and then just\ncome right back to right here right now\nand this is where I can make change I\ncan't make change over there I'm you\nknow I can't be in all these places at\nonce but we are we're all over the world\nhis business her business their business\nGod's business the weather's business\nthat's a great Point that's so true we\nreally are in our own business oh so and\nI think huge takes us to everyone else's\nbusiness our social media takes us to\nother people's business we're always\ntalking about other people's business\nand how do you get your business done if\nyou're always in someone else's business\nand when you're present when we're\npresent we can observe life from um out\nof a it sounds strange but out of a\nproactive state of mind and\nunderstanding I think is the better word\nand and stay present and watch these\nthings on televisions and and and and\nand walk in Black lives matter events\nand and we can do the most marvelous\nthings on and still be present\nit's um but fear fear stops us from I\ndon't have the right clothes and and I I\nwonder if if uh I need to take a lunch\nand I did that oh well this is just you\nknow I don't think I'll bother today you\nknow\nyou know what would stop us from doing\nthe right thing our hearts desire\nand literally our hearts desire and to\nlive out of that fear\nyeah what Katie what is the uh secret to\nyour long incredible relationship with\nSteve\nhow did you both find each other how did\nyou both know that you were right for\neach other and how did you continue he's\nbetter at telling this story but but\num on my\num\na friend of mine said that I just needed\nto meet him and\num and that\num he's the one person in the world that\ncould write\num on\nmy book loving what is and um\nand oh gosh how do I tell this story\nhe's so good at it\num\nyou know the bottom line oh this sounds\nthis sounds so he asked me to marry him\nand I didn't know why not and that's the\ntruth of it and I asked my three grown\nchildren do you who do you have a reason\nwhy I shouldn't marry Stephen and they\ndidn't have one and I didn't have one\nand what I knew of Stephen is he is good\nand kind and wise and there just was no\nreason in the world not but when you\nhave a perfect life when you're never\nlonely let's say I'm always alone and\nnever lonely as far as people go\num I don't need anyone\nand and\nI married him and he I mean just he is\njust so completely lovable a dear and\nkind and and um just I don't know how\nhow this story sounds but um who\nwouldn't love that absolutely you know\nit's goodness and kindness and fairness\nand\nBrilliance and oh the you know all the\nthings I on in my life before the work\nthe opposite would attract me on looks\nand the real man and the the you know\nall the the usual usual and\num I didn't do well in those areas\nthat's that's your powerful point I'm so\nglad you raised that because what we're\nattracted to is also what we're thinking\nand believing and so sometimes when we\nsay well this is my type or this is the\nkind of guy or girl or whoever it is\nthat I'm attracted to what we're saying\nis we think and believe that this will\nmake us happy yes their appearance their\njob their status their whatever maybe\nwill make us happy yeah and we don't\nquestion that we wonder why the person\nlet us down but it using your\nmethodology the work as soon as we go\nback to what were we thinking and\nbelieving at that time we start to write\nthat what we've thought and believed\nwould make us happy is what led us down\nyeah not that person yeah but we were\nthinking and believing about that human\nbeing yeah on was the cause of our\nattraction but once we question what we\nwere thinking and believing about the\nhuman being that it loses its validity\nreally and leaves us in an open State of\nMind where we're uh more able to see and\nhear rather than think over yes yes so\nwell said and that's it's really\nregistering and for everyone who's\nlistening or watching right now when you\nwhen you're listening to this I really\nhope that the repetition every time\nKatie keeps talking about thinking and\nbelieving what are your thoughts and\nwhat are your beliefs if you genuinely\nrevisit those pivotal crucial\ntransitionary moments of your life you\nyou recognize that all of that pain and\nsuffering that you are experiencing or\nholding on to comes from a thought and a\nbelief that you're still holding on to\nsometimes we're holding on for decades\nto a thought and belief that this person\ncan still make me happy and that's why\nwe want them to be back into our lives\nwe are holding on to believe that only\nthat job can make me happy or only that\nthing can make me happy that is a\nthought and belief and in that one\nbelief is encapsulated all of our\nsuffering it's almost taking a suffering\ncollaboration and then when we get that\njob we can appreciate it because we're\ntaking the same same thinking into that\njob so really not a lot changes maybe\nthe money but that's never enough either\nyeah it's so
