    "transcript": "if you can't feel gratitude if you can't\nfeel love i just want to know what\nyou've been practicing feeling every day\nbecause\nthat feeling that you're practicing is\nwhat you're always feeling now let's\npractice feeling something else in the\nbeginning it's not going to be easy one\nof the ways that we find our audience\nstruggles is deducing the energy of the\npeople around you and the energy that\nyou attract into your life and the\npeople that you keep often like you said\nthere are people coming to your seminars\nthat are dragging their partners yeah\nand they have to drag their partners\nthere because their partners are not\nunderstanding it initially\nwhere is that\nis there a method for people to start\ndeducing the energy\nof people they meet and connect with to\nbe aware if they're on the same\nfrequency or on the same path ah\nwell well i don't i don't know if\nthere's a machine that does that\nbut once again like\ni think that if we share\nthe same experiences because we like the\nsame things we share the same emotions\nand if we share the same experiences we\nshare the same emotions i can relate to\nyou so we can exchange ideas and\ninformation\nand if we share the same energy energy\nis information so many people as an\nexample\nthey use each other to reaffirm their\ntheir dependency on suffering so i\nsuffer more than you then you say i you\ni suffer you suffer more than me we have\nthis thing we just complain with each\nother well that's the same resonance the\nsame frequency and there's a match right\nbut goes to the same means if you if\nyou're if you're someone who's has a uh\naccountability partner that that you\nexchange ideas like this with and it's a\ndifferent frequency and different energy\nso when energy comes together and it's\nconstructive something comes out of it\nyeah you feel it right it's and you feel\nan elevation if there's dissonance then\nyour your sensing meter is how you feel\nabout that person many times in your gut\nor in your heart or wherever and there's\ndecon there's a\ndestructive interference and there's no\nenergy involved so\ni think that's just a practice but\nreally\nthe ultimate mastery\nis to be able to be in such residence\nsuch coherence\nthat when you walk in the room that you\nraise\neverybody's energy and you don't let\nyour energy drop because of any\ncircumstance or any condition and that\nwould be greater than your environment\nright and that's that's the model\nthat we use so imagine 1 500 people\nin an event\nwhere everybody's getting super coherent\nand the interference that's going on in\nthe room is creating these high\namplitudes and we've measured that in\nthe room and the energy in the room is\noff the chart many times there's i mean\nthere's energy for healing in there\nthere's energy for all kinds of things\nthat can happen so we brought it to life\nwith our awareness and so\nthe more elevated the emotion love\ngratitude freedom bliss ecstasy the\nhigher the frequency\nso but it turns out you can have a\ncollective group of people with a lot of\nenergy and be incoherent and it creates\nentropy yeah you could have a smaller\ngroup of people that are highly coherent\nand put out a very big signal\nso when we see a collective really get\ncoherent\nwow the energy in the room opens up\ndoors\nof possibilities that i would i would\nnever expect i mean i i don't i don't\nknow how to explain some of the\nphenomenological things that happen\nbut that's that's everybody's divine\nlike everybody's everybody's in that\nstate they're they're in that elevated\nstate so\ni think our i think our truth meter\nis really whether we feel it lifted\nuh or we feel like uh we've been robbed\nyeah yeah and often often our feeling of\nfeeling lifted\nis based on everything we've just talked\nabout it's based on a void\nbased on an unhealed trauma\nbased on a gap or a\npart of ourselves that we haven't yet\nbroken a belief and so often feeling\nlifted is not feeling lifted in the way\nyou're saying right it's feeling lifted\nin the just the external superficial\nsense\nreaffirming the emotion you need just as\njust as you said earlier at the\nbeginning that an external event could\nmake you feel sad right the external\nevent is making you feel good right\nright but it's still extensive exactly\nthe opposite right\nso then that means then when things are\ngood you feel good yeah when things are\nbad you feel bad so there's dramatic\ncontrast and polarity and this is the\nrealm of polarity right so how do you\nfind the middle path well the heart is\nthe middle path it's the union of\npolarity it's the union of opposites\nit's it's oneness it's wholeness and\nthis is where we have to begin to create\nfrom all of this down here is all\nhumanity this is all our animal nature\nwe get up in here things change right\nyou go from selfish to selfless and\nsomething else happens so\nit's really funny too because when\na lot of people come they say i i don't\nknow i'm having difficulty opening my\nheart\ni'm you know i'm practicing but i'm not\nfeeling anything yet and then it comes\ntime to do our healings on other people\nand\nthe moment you it's no longer about you\nall of a sudden something happened well\nof course that's what the heart is about\nright so so it comes in ways that uh we\nleast expect at times yeah i love that\nyou've incorporated that element of\npeople\nhaving that experience and and often\nmost people can't open their heart to\nothers because they haven't even opened\ntheir hearts themselves right like they\nhaven't been through that process of\nsitting long enough yeah to let the\nheart i mean i always say to people\nwhen was the last time you sat with your\nheart and just worked with it like so\nthat it's not contracted and afraid and\nprotected\nit takes practice to to do that and and\nso we we we work with people in letting\nthem\nwe give them numerous opportunities\nto practice this over and over and over\nagain and sooner or later pedal by pedal\nit starts to bloom and all of a sudden\nthere's an authentic smile on their face\nand once energy meets the heart it goes\nright to the brain we have\nwe did this study where we hooked up an\nelectrocardiogram to an\nelectroencephalogram an\nelectroencephalogram is a brain mapping\nmachine so we measure 19 or 26 different\ncompartments and we're looking to see\nall different kind of activity in the\nbrain\nbut we measure the heart along with it\nand when the heart starts beating\ncoherently\nin in a sense of order\nlike a like taking a big sheet jay and\ngoing like that\nthe heart sends a wave right up to the\nbrain\nand the brain goes into these beautiful\nstates of alpha the heart is telling the\nbrain it's safe to create again it's\nsafe to imagine it's safe to dream of a\nnew future\nand\nthere's the stroke volume of the heart\nin order and then you see these two or\nthree seconds of beautiful coherent\nalpha the brain is in it's it's in that\ncreative state then there's a pause and\nit happens again and\nit's it's it's beauty it's a it's a\nsymphony\nif you don't have that mechanism you can\nhave all the intention in the world but\nthere's no carrier wave i mean\nwhen people when they make energy reach\ntheir heart there's an external field\nthat's created it's it's it's magnetic\nit's it's it's measurable\nand that energy\nis frequency and if that frequency is\ncoherent it can carry the intent\nor thought on a coherent brain of that\nfuture the energy of suffering\ncannot carry the thought of health or\nwealth it's not consistent with it it\ncarries a different set of thoughts\nso then\nthe training then\nis getting people into those hard states\nbecause\nonce they start trading that fear or\nthat pain or that frustration or trying\nor whatever forcing you know control\nfor gratitude and they just let all that\ngo and i say to them listen\nif you can't feel gratitude if you can't\nfeel love i just want to know what\nyou've been practicing feeling every day\nbecause that feeling that you're\npracticing is what you're always feeling\nnow let's practice feeling something\nelse in the beginning it's not going to\nbe easy but you got to keep following\nthe formula keep doing it keep doing it\nkeep doing it\nwell\nwhen they start feeling gratitude it's\nvery interesting because\nthe emotional signature of gratitude\nis that something wonderful just\nhappened to you\nsomething favorable is happening to you\nright so\nyou've just received something or you're\nreceiving something you say thank you so\ngratitude\nis the ultimate state of receiving\nemotionally\nso when you move into a state of\ngratitude and you open your heart you\nwill accept believe and surrender to the\nthoughts equal to that emotional state\nand you'll program your autonomic\nnervous system into a different destiny\nyou could say i'm healthy i'm healthy\ni'm healthy i'm wealthy and wealthy and\nwealthy and wealthy and free i'm free\ni'm free and your body is conditioned in\nthe misery and it's saying no you're not\nand that thought stops right at the\nbrain stem\nit never makes it to the body because\nthe body is on a different program\nso then\nwhile the person starts trading that and\nthey start opening their heart well\ntheir immune system gets stronger by 50\npercent 50\nin three days they start making\nimmunoglobulins their bodies natural\ndefense against viruses and bacteria 50\nnot a little bit\na lot that's that's one study and so\ntrading that\ntelling the body it's in the in the\nenvironment where it already happened\nand so that's when the miracles start\nhappening that's when people say\ni'm not doing anything well of course\nyou're not\nyou don't have to yeah so then\nlast point about this because it's so\nimportant that people\nunderstand that most people are creating\nmatter to matter\nso the more you live by the hormones of\nstress the more altered you are inside\nof you the rush of those adrenal\nchemicals\nnarrows your focus the senses are\nheightened and we become materialists\nand now all of our attention is on our\nbodies and our environment and on time\nand now we're lost in the vr machine of\nthree-dimensional reality everything\nappears as separate so i'm here and\nyou're there and there's space and time\nbetween us then there's me here and\nthere's my dreams i place them way out\nthere in the future why do i place them\nout there because i'm estimating how\nmuch i have to work to get that house to\nget that car how much i have to save how\nmuch overtime i have to work what things\ndo i have to do how do i have to cheat\nrob steal lie whatever i have to do to\nget it right that's matter trying to\nchange matter\nand so when it doesn't happen we feel\nmore separation we try harder we force\nwe pray we control all that stuff\nso then\ncreating from the field instead of from\nmatter\nmeans that you have to take all of your\nattention off your body\nall of your attention of all the people\nin your life all your attention of all\nthe objects and things all the places\nand even time itself and become nobody\nno one no thing nowhere in no time and\nif you're not any of those things what\nare you your consciousness\nand now you are liberated from the rules\nof three-dimensional reality where\neverything takes time and energy to get\nwhat you want now when we create from\nthe field\ninstead of from matter because it's not\nmatter that's emitting the field\nit's actually the field that's creating\nmatter change the field you change\nmatter right now this is not something\nyou take one bite of and you get it's\nsomething you got to really practice\nso then\nby doing this properly with a coherent\nbrain and a coherent heart you got a\nwi-fi signal\nand if you're creating from the field\ninstead of from matter\nyou no longer have to go anywhere to get\nwhat you want if you were connected to\nthat invisible field of energy called\nthe unified field the quantum field\nwhich connects everything physical and\nmaterial and you're aware of it and\nyou're connected to it you're connected\nto source why would you if you were\nsource why would you go get anything\nyou'd draw it to you so the thought\ncoherent brain is the intent it's the\nelectrical charge the elevator the\nmotion the heart has a magnetic\nsignature it's the magnetic charge the\nthought sending the signal out it's a\ndirective the feeling is drawing the\nevent back\ncreate that\ncombination and now you're going to\ncollapse space and time and you're going\nto draw those synchronicities to you now\ni'm here in this lifetime\ni'm clear that i want to master that i\nwant to get good at that because i don't\nwant to i did the other stuff you can\nget successful the other way but you're\ntoo tired it takes too much energy i\nwould rather synchronize my energy to\nsynchronicities\nin my life and be mystified yeah by wow\nthis stuff really works and every\nsynchronicity that happens that catches\nyou off guard and brings you joy and awe\nand wonder\nyou're going to use that energy to\ncreate the next one and it gets weird\ni've had some crazy synchronicities in\nthe last three days i'm laughing while\ni'm driving going oh my god this life is\nso incredibly mysterious what an amazing\nride this is\nthat's a different perspective one is\nwhen you're not synchronizing well you\nasked the person was it worth it you\nshowed up every day was it worth\nabsolutely\nso when it starts happening\nand you start seeing those you see\nfeedback in your world\nyou're going to pay attention to what\nyou did and you're going to do it again\nand you're going to be like okay i've\ndone this i've done this and this people\nwho heal themselves\nhave very little difficulty healing\nsomeone else yeah that's just the next\nstep and then with kovid and we couldn't\ndo the healings in our events we had\nstudents just get together and say if\nwe're in the quantum\nokay and everything's connected\ndo i really need to be there i just need\na target give me the face give me the\ncoordinate love transcends space and\ntime yeah okay\ngive me that coordinate i'll love that\nperson in the life\nand these people do it and we have we\nhave reputable universities now that are\nstudying this phenomena and they're\nsaying\nthey're telling me\nthese are universities that have some of\nthe most advanced laboratories this is\ni'm talking the nobel prize researchers\nthey want to change the conversation in\nmedicine and today i got a video of\nsomebody being healed remotely\nand she's laying there her cancer\nwent from really bad to\nnothing\nand she videotapes herself when the\ngroup works on her she is laying there\nand her body\nis moving all over that floor\nit's twisting and turning there's energy\nmanipulating that body they're changing\nthe pattern in the field they don't need\nthe body is the illusion the tumor is\nthe illusion that's the hologram\nchange the pattern in the field you\nchange the projection in\nthree-dimensional our\nperson who's healed themselves and been\nin a circle where they've healed someone\nelse\nhow and then when you do that what's\nnext i don't know you won't know until\nyou have that experience yeah i've sat\nin on the groups\nwhere they get together on the zooms and\nfive people that they've healed tell\ntheir story\nyou know a mother whose daughter is\nunresponsive with a with a with an\ninjury or a handicap from birth who's\nnow looking at her brothers who's trying\nto talk who's smiling who's present the\nmother's telling the story there's 40\npeople on the zoom we're all crying\nnot crying for any other reason but the\nspecies\nis helping the living organism called\nthe human being is healing one another\nthey're informing one another they're\ntaking care of one something innate is\nawakening us we're\nwe're crying the experience of that\nproduces an emotion\nthat's different than any other emotion\nyou could ever feel that's a new\nexperience\ndo you think that that person who goes\nto heal the next person is going to have\na problem opening their heart after that\nthey know what the payoff is\nand so they don't contract oh my god\nthat person has in a coma you know how\nmany people have come out of comas\nbecause of this healing group\nthey're spot on they can hit a target\nand they lay their energy over that\nfield and another one over there and\nanother one over and all of a sudden you\nget these complex coherent patterns and\nit's creating a change in matter and and\nthey they figured it out and we have\nuniversities that are we're collecting\nall the data and they're crunching all\nthe algorithms we know that it works\nreally well for anxiety it works really\nwell for insomnia for neurological\ndisorders parkinson's disease\ninflammation we're capturing that pain\nhuge changes in pain and they're they're\non the other side of the planet it's\nkind of and we're synchronizing we're\nmeasuring heart rate variability and\nwe're sending electrodes and sensors to\nthe people that are being healed and\nwe're seeing if there's a correlation\nbetween the coherence of the group\nthat's doing the coherence of the person\nwho's having the experience and\nwe're measuring dna before\nthe healing and three days of healing we\nmeasure the dna after why because\nevidence has allowed his voice\nyou see that it's the four minute mile\nthat you can't go back\nto being the same person i scratch my\nhead sometimes when i'm standing on the\nstage\nand there's someone\nspeaking to the audience\nwho has had a very serious health\ncondition and they don't look like a\nvegan and they don't look gluten free\nand they don't look young and they don't\nlook buffed and they don't look like\nthey're in shape\nthey just look like a normal person that\nhas struggled with a health condition\nand they're telling the truth\nthey\nyou are witnessing\nthe truth\nthey are the example of truth in other\nwords they have the scans they have the\nblood test it's gone\nand i'm looking out in the audience jay\nand everybody is leaning in\nnobody is moving there they are in awe\nof the four-minute mile right in front\nof them somebody broke through somebody\npierced that veil somebody broke out of\nthat level of consciousness\nand that story is filled with truth not\nnot my words yeah it's star wars they\njust showed up every day for themselves\nthey just kept showing up and believing\nit and they became it right you asked\nthat person\nwhere's the disease they'll tell you\nit's in the old person i'm somebody\nthere's i'm not the same it doesn't\ncan't be there\nthe person in the audience\nwho's relating to that person with the\nsame rare genetic disorder the same\nlupus the same cancer don't you know\nthat their belief is going to change\nright in front of them and instead of\ntaking two years to do it\nthey do it in three months\nwhy because as soon as the four minute\nmile was broken yeah the next one that\nbroke it was two weeks later and there's\nbeen 1400 people have done it i mean\nit's not a thing anymore right so\nto me that's\nwe have such compelling evidence in\nscience with brain scans you make your\nbrain work better you can make your\nheart work better you can make your\nimmune system work better you can make\nyour cells go from really sick to really\nhealthy we've got great evidence you can\nbecome immune to serious viruses you can\nbe immune to bacteria we've got the\nmeasurements you can lengthen your life\nwe have great evidence and the people\naren't monks they're not they're not\nnuns they're not religious scholars\nthey're just common people\nand then we have testimony\nof people who are the example of truth\nthey are they are the example of truth i\nwould rather have dinner with those\npeople than anybody anybody else\nthey know something right\nso evidence then becomes the loudest\nvoice right and and that's what i think\nwhat people are looking for right now\nthe truth is so lost in sensationalism\nand the truth is so lost\nin emotional agreement\nand so people who want to feel fear\nthey program themselves and accept\nbelieve and surrender that people who\nwant to be hate be hateful\nit's all there it's all there and it's a\nit's a matrix to find the way out right\nand and\nand i think i think there's a door i\njust i just think that we have to\ntrust the innate information that that\ncomes from within us absolutely\nfascinating and i can't wait to actually\nexperience an event in in real i'm going\nto invite you one more time and then i'm\ngoing to send somebody over here in a\ncar to pick up you well i think last\ntime we wanted to do it and then the\npandemic yeah so you know from from last\ntime but uh no i would i would love to i\ncan't wait to experience that into\nexperience it personally not just to\nwatch others but to actually go through\nit myself too but\nwith all of that said and seeing these\nbreakthroughs seeing these breakthrough\npatterns you having transcendental\nexperiences what do you believe in this\npresent state of ignorance as you said\nwhat do you believe is the purpose of\nlife overall\nto figure out the purpose of life\nokay i know i mean i mean i i really\nthink it's i think the mathematics\nthat i've looked at says there's\ninfinite experiences to have you will\nnever know the end\nso then\nif you study any religion i i mean i've\nlooked at a lot of them\nthis concept of eternity that the soul\nis going to be around for eternity\nthat's a long time\nand that means you got to be okay with\nyou\nfor a very long time yeah so\ni think it's i think it's the creation\nof more experiences and i think\nto to\ni think we came from source from\nsingularity from oneness\nand we have descended down into density\na fooled by our senses into separation\nand every\nsingle being has a spark of oneness of\nthe divine within them and we got so\nseparate\nthat we now have our own free will to\nanswer the question is there more\nbecause if your oneness it gets kind of\nboring after a while like is there\nanything else well the moment you ask if\nthere's anything else you're no longer\noneness you're something other than\noneness right and you're\na a different consciousness separate\nfrom oneness\nso i think then we live life and then\nwhen we can predict the feeling of\neverything that can happen in our life\nand gets boring and\nwe're not impressed by anyone or\nanything we ask the same question\nis there more and that's when the soul\ngoes\nall right well it's been how many\nlifetimes you've been doing this okay\nthere's an awakening and the and we ask\nthat question and then all of a sudden\nwe start getting information and books\nand stuff and meet people and it gets\nexciting and and it's the it's it's how\nthe universe works and so we climb out\nof this\nand i just think there's so many\nincredible experiences that are left in\nthe unknown uh that we get to have and\nand then of course when\non the journey is over and you evolve to\nthat point uh then you take that wisdom\nand you want you say here's what i\nlearned and it was scary down there and\ni was like boy i tell a great story and\nthen you hang out there and you go\nis there anything else besides and here\nwe go again it just never ends\nthat's my theory that's a great answer i\nloved it i resonate deeply with many\nparts of that answer i think it's a it's\na really\nbeautifully put way of thinking about it\nand bringing in that like i said at the\nbeginning bringing in that spiritual\nthat science and the experience of of\nwhat it would actually look like to live\nfor eternity so it's a beautiful\nbeautiful answer dr joe we end every\nepisode with the final five these are\nthe fast five questions where the\nanswers have to be one word to one\nsentence maximum okay so this is uh i\ndon't remember this from last time so\nthis is good yeah and i'll probably\nbreak my rule with you because you give\nphenomenal no i'll i'll do my best i'll\ntry my best as well me too i'll try my\nbest as well okay so dr joe these are\nyour final five\nuh the first question is what is the\nbest advice you've ever received\nhow to show up for yourself\nwhat's the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\nuh believe what people tell you\nwhat's something that you've said in the\npast that you were confident about it\nthen but now upon reflection you're like\noh i should have changed my mind about\nthat oh that it takes a long time to\ncreate reality i'm going to ask you to\nexpand on that because i like that\nanswer i want to know more that's\nfascinating\nwell um i think just like anything else\nyou learn how to snowboard you go\nthrough that learning curve you learn\nhow to ride a bike you go through that\nlearning curve\nthat i used to think that creation was\nhard\ni just thought it took a lot of energy\nand it took a lot of sacrifice and it'll\nwork for it and great onsen and uh god i\nmean even my definition of surrender\ntoday is very different than it was just\nthree months ago because i'm always\ndoing it\nand so\ni think that\nit doesn't have to be that way i just\nthink that it could be any way you want\nand that and then working on that uh\nchanging that belief i love that\nbeautiful answer thank you for sharing\nyeah question number four\nuh what's one thing that you think\npeople value but you don't\noh other people's opinions\nif i really\ncared what people thought i would have\nstopped this a long time ago and now\nit's so great because i have so many\nresearchers and physicians and everybody\ni'm very glad you didn't stop and we are\nvery happy you didn't stop i think it's\ndeeply meaningful work and the more time\nwe spend together and the more time i\nhear\nwhere you want to take people where you\nwant what you want people to experience\nis just beautiful so thank you for what\nyou're doing thanks uh fifth and final\nquestion\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be\ntake care of one another\nnice and simple it's beautiful why do\nyou think anonymity is so\nimportant for all of us in our life to\nexperience why is it such a fascinating\nbecause\nwhen you\ngo past your ego identity\nthere's a bigger identity that is\nso huge it's incomprehensible it can't\neven be described and there's a freedom\nand a joy\nthat comes from that and\ni had had glimpses of that but this\nperiod of intense\nstillness and by the way since then i've\nkept a week of silence\nevery year sometimes i'll do more\nand uh that week of silence usually in\nseptember i do every year\njust to go back to the taste of\ntimeless being yeah instead of you know\nour ego identity which we keep polishing\nevery day now especially these days with\nsocial media and books and promotions\nand\nyou name it\nwhat's something that people can do\ndaily to access that experience because\nlike you said our days are just busy\nwith work and family and commitments and\nevents what's something people can do\ndaily that helps them access their true\nidentity their self going beyond the ego\nand the mind and the body\ni think the basic of it is to still the\nmind as much as possible\nand just become a silent witness\num to that which is happening on the\nscreen of your consciousness\nso if you um close your eyes and take a\nfew deep breaths\nand then um\nyou know i usually start with a little\nreflection who am i\nwho wants to know the answer what is it\nthat wants to know the answers to the\nquestion who am i\nwhat is my purpose\nwhat do i want for me and the world\nwhat am i grateful for that's how i\nstart\nthen i go into a little bit of breathing\nand then mantra meditation and then\nwhat i do is i witness\nwhat's happening on the screen of my\nconsciousness just becoming aware\nand sooner or later you realize that\nwhat's happening on the screen of\nconsciousness is not who you are you're\nthe one who's watching that\nand then what's happening on the screen\nof your consciousness ultimately leads\nto deep insights about\nmind and body and the physical world\nwhich actually doesn't really exist but\nwe can get into that when we talk about\nmetahuman but i think if people just ask\nthese four questions every day before\nthey start the day even without a\nprolonged meditation\nprocess who am i\nwhat do i want what's my purpose\nwhat am i grateful for suddenly the\nwindows to the bigger reality starts\nstart to open absolutely this is such a\nbeautiful point that deepak's making\nright now for everyone listening and\nwatching it's just such a simple way of\nstarting to transcend the noise and the\nclutter that we feel every morning when\nwe wake up and the first thing we do is\nlook at our phones\nall you have to do is just switch that\nhabit for asking yourself these\nquestions and you don't need to know the\nanswers because you know there are no\nfixed answers these answers keep\nchanging\nall you have to do is live the questions\nand then life keeps moving you into\nanswers that you need at that moment in\nyour life and it all happens\nspontaneously synchronistically such a\ngreat point because these answers are\nrevealed and received they're not\nthey're not found and they're pertinent\nfor that moment in your life not\nnecessarily the answers i love that i\nthink that's such a good point because\nso often we put this pressure when we\nask a question that we must find the\nanswer now it's like the education\nsystem has drilled dust and believing\nthat you have the right or wrong answer\nwithin moments now what was that poet\nwho said uh live the questions and life\nwill move you to the answers when you\nneed them because if you got them right\nnow you may not be even prepared for\nthem wow yeah that's a good point i know\nlife has done that to me a lot of times\nyeah when you ask questions\nand you think you want the answer now\nbut then when you actually receive it\nyou realize yes i wasn't prepared that's\nright absolutely wow what a profound\nwhat a profound way of thinking about it\ni love that that's that's made a huge\nshift in my mind not even to want to\nanswer the questions now no just ask\nthem and let your day and let them go\nyeah alum in the form of insight\nintuition\ninspiration\ncreative um\ncreativity but most importantly they\ncome in the form of meaningful\ncoincidences\nof what kalyan called synchronicity or\nwhat religious people say grace yes\nthat's it yeah yeah meaningful\ncoincidences absolutely yeah how\nbeautifully said i love that so this is\nwhat i love about your journey deepak is\njust that\nat every point it seems that you've\nbeen a seeker for more like you've\ncontinually\ngone in the direction of more learning\nmore growth\nnever settling how have you seen\nthe medical industry shift how have you\nseen other things around you shift with\ntime because you've really gone all the\nway do you think that we are seeing\nshifts in the media yeah we are seeing\nshifts when i started i felt like a\nloner yeah i can imagine but now\nintegrative medicine is part of every\ninstitution including academia and\nin the last 15 20 years\nour foundation has done a lot of\nresearch so\nwe made it pretty mainstream right now\nso\nto summarize very shortly what has taken\n30 years to learn or more 40 years to\nlearn\nis that only five percent of disease\nrelated gene mutations\nare fully penetrant so let me explain\nthis\nfor a lay audience so a genetic a\ngenetic mutation\nis a\nis a mistake it's an error\nin the gene\ngenes are stretches of dna that code for\nproteins\nso dna is\nstands for deoxyribonucleic acid and\nthere are four of these\nnamed after alphabets adenine guanine\ncytosine thymine atcg so atcg are the\nfour letters of life in english we have\n26 letters\nand most languages human languages we\nhave more than 20 letters but the\nlanguage of life dna has only four\nletters atcg\nand these spell out words\nthat we call genes and the body is a\nstory spelt out by those\ngenes so when people say first there was\nthe word word was made into flesh in a\nway it's very literal actually when you\nstart to look at the biological\nmechanism\nnow once in a while\nor\nmore than once in a while there are\ngenetic mistakes so you might think of\nthem again with\nspeaking metaphorically\nbut\na spelling mistake so instead of the\nword being spelled correctly maybe one\nof the letters atcg is missing or it's\nin the wrong place or it's upside down\nor you're redundant two letters instead\nof one\nthat mistake genetic variation is called\na mutation\nnow only five percent of these genetic\nmutations that are associated with\ndisease\ncancer heart disease\narthritis\nstrokes\nyou name it autoimmune diseases\nalzheimer's\nonly five percent actually\nguarantee the disease\nwhich means if you have one of those\nmutations you're going to get the\ndisease like angelina jolie had a gene\ncalled the baraka gene which predicts\nbreast cancer 100\nso she had a mastectomy to prevent the\ncancer\nrightly so\nfor those five percent there are new\ntechnologies that are being developed\nright now\nand crispr is one of them which means\nyou can cut and paste the gene the way\nyou would in email so you would take the\ndefective gene you'd read the bar chord\nwith the molecular scissors you delete\nit and then you'll insert the right\nchain\nit's not happening right now but it'll\nhappen in the near future\nbut what people don't understand is\nthat's five percent of illness wow the\nrest even the genetic mistakes that are\nassociated with disease\ndepends on how you live your life and\nvery simple things like sleep\nmeditation and stress management\nmovement\nyoga and pranayama now yoga and pranam\ngoes way beyond exercise because with\nyoga and pranayam there's a particular\nnerve in the body called the vagus nerve\nit's the tenth nerve and the word vegas\nis a latin word but it's related to the\nenglish word vagabond so this nerve\ncomes from the midbrain\nit influences your facial expressions so\nyou can now do micro expressions and see\nif a person is happy or not\nit influences the\neye movements\nit influences the tone of your voice are\nyou threatened are you stressed are you\nfriendly are you happy it influences\nyour heart rate activity then it pierces\nthe diaphragm\nand it influences the activity of every\nother\nbranch of the vagus nerve that goes to\nall the organs in the body\nso when i discovered this through yoga\nteachers and masters\ni realized that the yoga asanas you know\nwe say yoga asana\nand people usually translate that into\nas postures\nbut actually the word asana means seat\nas you know seat of awareness seat of\nconsciousness so each yogasana is a\nparticular seat of consciousness\nthat stimulates a particular nerve that\nis going to\norgan in your body\nand the only\nreason for that nerve is self-regulation\nor healing or homeostasis\nso when i discovered that i became\nfanatic about yoga i haven't missed yoga\nnow for as long as i can remember that\none amazing wow okay not one day of yoga\nor meditation\nor um\nor pranayama so yeah it was a long time\nso when you put together you know yoga\nmovement sleep stress management\nhealthy relationships and emotions like\nlove compassion joy equanimity\nuh\nfood that doesn't kill your microbiome\nwhich is the two million extra genes in\nour body which are not human so you only\nhave 25 000 human genes but you have two\nmillion bacterial genes in your body\nthis is called the microbial microbiome\nit is much it's as important as the\nhuman genome so\nyou can change the activity of your\nmicrobial genes just by changing your\ndiet so if you go\nnot even vegan but if you go maximum\ndiversity on plant-based foods\nand foods that are not contaminated with\nantibiotics or hormones or\ninsecticides\num you can change your genetic activity\nwow and the population of your genes\nin less than six weeks and which means\nthen you're reinventing your body\nbecause your body is spelled out by your\ngenes so this got me going\nstrongly into how do we reinvent our\nbodies\nby resurrecting our souls\nand\ngoing past our minds and that's what i'm\nobsessed with now wow i love that i'm so\nglad you're obsessed with it because\nthe fact that we're so responsible\nfor our own well-being\nis huge in the sense of belief that\nthere are ways in which we can rewrite\nthat story you can write the genetic\nstructure\nof your body you can't change the human\ngenes by the way because you got them\nfrom your parents but you can change\ntheir activity so right here's one of\nour researchers um we put one\nwe put people through a one week\nretreat\nwhere they not only learnt mantra\nmeditation but they also practiced the\nyoga sutras of patanjali from the\nchapter on the cds\nparticularly transcending the senses\nin one week\nliterally and this is published now in\nmajor\npeer-reviewed journals if people want to\ncheck them out go to chopra\nfoundation.org and you'll see all the\nresearch and the research was in\ncollaboration with scientists from\nharvard from ucsf from duke\nfrom scripps of course chopra foundation\nmount sinai in new york and what did we\nfind we found that in one week of this\npractice of meditation\nand the yoga sutras of patanjali all the\ngenes that are responsible for healing\nand self-regulation they went up some\n17-fold over baseline these are human\ngenes\nand the genes that cause disease or\ninflammation went down drastically the\nenzyme there's an enzyme in our body\ncalled telomerase it influences the\nlength of telomeres which are like\nlittle buttons at the end of your\nchromosomes\nthe the\nlevel of the enzyme went up 40 in one\nweek which means\npeople were reversing their biological\nage at a genetic level wow okay now how\nfar does this go we don't know and that\nwas just one week which is one week and\nyou know the people who are in samadhi\nfor weeks at a time\nthose traditions are not that prevalent\nyou know there's a technique in ayurveda\ncalled kaya kalpa where you go into a\nretreat\nwhere it is totally dark\nwhere you have no communication with the\nworld where you transcend\nwhere you eat minimal\nmaximum diversity of plant-based foods\nand within six months you come back a\nyounger person biologically\nphysiologically you know i'm 72 now\nyou're looking at i'm i'm i you know i'm\nnot\nfocused on aging anymore yeah i've got i\nthink that's a mistake for anyone who\nuh follows deepak on social media\ninstagram or facebook if you don't\nalready i highly recommend it but i've\nnever seen you miss a day of yoga\nmeditation i see you every time when you\ninspire me so much because i just think\nlike if you're able\nat your current body's age to be able to\ndo the things you are with your body and\nhow healthy you are and how healthy your\nbody and mind are i mean we have no\nexcuses there's biological age which is\nthe exact biomarkers so\nwhat's blood pressure bone density body\ntemperature regulation fat content\ncholesterol\nvision hearing skin thickness wrinkles\nhormones\nthat's biological age then there's\nchronological age when you were born\nwhat your birth certificate says yes\nthen there's psychological age how do\nyou feel yes and then there's spiritual\nage which is timeless which has no age\nwhatsoever\nso you know we have to make these\ndistinctions and see which\nof these we're talking about 100 100 and\nwhen you said at the end there that\nyou're not thinking about aging anymore\nwhat did you mean by that when you said\nthat\nit's now um\nsomething i talk about\nin my new book made a human\nthat\nwhat we call body\nmind\nand world\nand aging and birth and death\nare actually human constructs they're\nnot real now uh we can go into that\nto the extent that you want yeah yeah\nyeah control can we dive into the book\nfor a bit we can yeah yeah let's do it\nif that's what you want to do let's see\nyeah yeah yeah yeah no no i'd love to\ni've got so many questions on the book\nthat we'd put together for you so i'm\nhappy to do that so in one of the things\nthis is what i was looking at the you\nstart the book by prompting two\nquestions\nright in moments where you feel very\nhappy do you watch yourself being happy\nand when you're angry\nis someone is some part of you free of\nanger\nright\nwhy did you start with this so in all\nthe spiritual traditions um not\nnecessarily just the eastern\ntraditions\nthey speak of two worlds the imminent\nand the transcendent\nso the imminent is this world that we're\nin right now this space-time causality\nnew york city the hotel we're in\nand then the transcendent world is the\nworld of\ninfinite\nbeing or consciousness\nat all times we're in both these worlds\nwithout knowing\nbut once you become aware even slightly\nthat the awareness of a thought is not a\nthought\nright\nif you're able to observe a thought then\nyou the observer is not that thought\nright\nsimilarly the observer of the emotion or\nwhich is the awareness of an emotion is\nnot the emotion agreed\nor a perception or a color you know\nright now we are perceiving through our\nfive senses\nand what we are perceiving is colors\nforms\nshapes\nsounds\nsensations in our body\nmaybe emotions\nand thoughts\nand maybe images\nthat's the raw material of experience\nthat's all there is\nokay\nthe words body mind and world are human\nconstructs\nbased on the interpretation of these raw\nsensations\nso once you start to become a witness\nof experience you realize that you are\nintrinsically free of the experience\nunless you identify with it unless you\nsay that's me yes it's not you it's an\nexperience you're having right\nabsolutely so once you bind yourself to\nthe experience which we call the karmic\nweb\nof existence\nthen you are in that\ncircle of karma memory desire\nyou are constantly seeking validation\nyou're afraid of people who criticize\nyou you're flattered by people who\nflatter you\nyou feel beneath someone or superior to\nsomeone it's the melodrama of our daily\nexistence yes when you can observe\nwhat's happening\nin the realm of experience\nand instead of reacting to it you\nobserve the reaction to react even for a\nsecond\ninstead of reacting to the experience\nyou observe the reaction to react\nyou suddenly realize that your range of\noptions or choices\nright this moment is actually infinite\nand you don't have to be a bundle of\nconditioned reflexes and nerves\nthat's constantly being triggered by\npeople and circumstances into\npredictable outcomes so you become\nyou become you're at the mercy of every\nstranger on the street so i think it's\nvery important to know that yes i'm\nhaving this experience\nbut i am intrinsically free of this\nexperience so that's how the book starts\nyeah and i absolutely love that because\nit's\nan analogy i usually used to share that\nexperience is like when we're in a car\nand someone hits the car we say oh\nsomeone hit me yes but actually they\ndidn't hit you they hit the car yeah and\nyou're identifying as the car as\nyourself\nyes now how about if they hit your body\nyeah you know and and your body perishes\nright yes so that's the argument people\nhave against\nthe argument\nthat\nspiritual people have which is\nyou're not your body you're not your\nmind so but you know you remember that\nfamous\ndialogue between samuel johnson and\num and whoever that idealist was and he\nsaid you know the world is a projection\nof consciousness\nand i think it was samuel johnson who\nhit his leg on a piece of stone and said\ni refute you thus\nsaying that you know\nyou get hit by a bus you're going to\nyou're going to break your bones and you\nmight die sure so uh why do you say that\nthe physical world is an illusion now if\nyou want we can address that yeah let's\naddress that yeah let's address that\nyeah so\nyou know this is of course i take people\nthrough the book very slowly\nbut if you asked a regular person on the\nstreet\nwhat is this\nthey'd say it's a microphone\nif you ask them what's this\nyou'd say this is a watch\nwhat's this this is my hand what's this\nthis is my body\nnow if you really start to look at this\nvery carefully\nbefore you call anything by its name\nmicrophone hand body\num watch\nbefore you use that those words\nit's an experience\nand the experience is actually not a\nphysical experience\ncolor form and shape are not physical\nexperiences if i asked you where in the\nphysical world is the color red located\nyou would say\nnowhere in fact there's no color red in\nthe physical world what's coming to your\neyes are electromagnetic vibrations\nwhich have no color what's happening\nin your eyes there's no color and if i\nasked you to imagine a beautiful run red\nsunset\nyou have a picture in your consciousness\nbut there's no picture in your brain\nthere's no picture in your eyes\nand actually the sunset\nis not if you're imagining it it's not\nin the physical world now what you don't\nrealize is when you're looking at a real\nsunset all you're experiencing is color\nthe rest is a story\nokay that's a sunset\nthis is a body\nokay color shapes\ntextures sensations smells images\nemotions\nand thoughts have no location in the\nphysical world\nand yet out of this raw material we\ncreate the idea of a physical world\nso in sanskrit that's called jagat\nmithya the world appearance\non the screen of your consciousness and\nyour body is part of that world\nappearance because people you know they\nsay where are you people say i'm here\nbut there's no one inside there\nokay because this is also an experience\nin consciousness\nthe mind is an experience in\nconsciousness moreover it's a shifting\nexperience in consciousness\nno you know a thought is ungraspable\nit's ephemeral it's evanescent you can't\ncatch one\nokay you can't catch a perception look\nhere i look there these are two\nsnapshots of perception and they're\nevanescent i look at my body and by the\ntime i look at again it's a different\nbody because it's recycling so fast at\nthe level of atoms and molecules and\ninformation and energy\nso the fact that we call this a body\nit's actually a changing experience of\nsensations images feelings and thoughts\nthat is a modified form of your own self\nand it's changing it's ungraspable same\nthing with the mind it's ungraspable\nsame thing which we will call with the\nworld it's a changing experience\nof shifting what we call qualia in the\nin the spiritual literature now in the\nconsciousness literature there's this\nword qualia instead of quantum a quantum\nis a unit of measurement but a qualia is\na unit of experience so if i tell you\nthink of your wife right now and you see\nan image that's a qualia now feel the\nemotion connected with that that's a\nqualia\nnow think of what you want to do with\nher this evening go out for dinner or a\nmovie that's a qualia so qualia are\nunits\nof experience when we string them\ntogether\nwe create the construct of mind body and\nworld\nand once we create that construct then\nwe're stuck with constructs like birth\nand death and karma and memory and\ndesire\nand all the things which make a very\nfascinating human experience\nbut it's not reality\nit's we are already in a virtual reality\nokay so today with\nvr\nand immersive augmented experiences and\ndreamscapes\nit is becoming clear that the world that\nyou and i are inhabiting right now is a\ncollective human dreamscape\nand as body minds we have fictional\ncharacters in that\ndreamscape\nand it's an illusion that we can upgrade\nor we can downgrade\nyou know we can create heaven out of it\nor hell but it's still not fundamental\nreality and now with the new\ntechnologies this is becoming very clear\nonce you realize that the world is a\nconstruct\nyes the construct has been evolving\nthrough mythology through religion\nthrough economics through history\nthrough society through culture\nbut it's still a construct\nand what these great seers these great\nrishis were able to do is they were able\nto deconstruct it once you deconstruct\nit what are you left with you know when\nyou left you've heard that expression\n1880 i'm not the mind i'm not the body\ni'm not the intellect i'm i'm the\nobserver\nwhat are you left with\nonce you deconstruct everything what\nyou're left with\nis formless\ninfinite\ndynamic\nfield of infinite possibilities infinite\ncreativity\ninfinite love\nand the source of intention\nso that's what yoga originally was and\nshould be\nyoga means union union with the self\nwhich is also the self of the universe\nand this is where you know i got\ntotally\nseduced\nthat human suffering as the vedanta says\ncomes from not knowing true reality\nfundamental reality confusing\nperceptual reality with fundamental\nreality\ngrasping and clinging\nthat which you cannot grasp or cling the\nfear of impermanence\nthe construct of the ego and the fear of\ndeath these are all the same thing not\nknowing what is real and what is a\nprojection and even the projection\ncan be changed absolutely wow what a\nclass in what a master class in in in\nreality an illusion\nhow does then one function within the\nworld\nbut then still understand because i\nthink the challenge people have on a\nday-to-day basis as you've probably\nheard for decades is this well if it if\nif what i'm experiencing is not complete\nreality\nthen where do i go from there like what\ndo i do\nmarry do i fall in love why not do i go\nto the movies you know i used to go to a\nlot of movies i don't that much anymore\nbecause\nwhat we call everyday reality is a more\ninteresting movie than most movies yeah\ndon't have the imagination to capture\nthe what is happening\nin what we call everyday reality\nso we are in it\nwe might as well enjoy it and\nupgrade it and that's\nwhat\nthe expression is to be in the world and\nnot of this world okay or we are\nspiritual beings having a human\nexperience or non-local beings having a\nlocal experience\ntimeless but in time\nonce you understand that and once you\nalso get into the habit\nof self-reflection self-inquiry\nobserving perceptual experiences without\nnecessarily judging them so i'm right\nnow having the experience of\ncolors and forms and tastes and smells\nand sounds\ni don't necessarily have to\nqualify this experience\nand transcendence where you know you go\nto that place where there is no mantra\nand no thought and just\ndeep stillness\nthen the shift starts to occur that\nyou're not identifying with your body\nmind or experiences of the world and yet\nyou're enjoying them or not enjoying\nthem and now you want to do\nsomething to\nshift\nand since you're in the world you know\nabout\n25 years ago i wrote this book\nhow to make that practical and\ni don't know how but\nbasically i came up with the idea of the\nseven spiritual laws of success the law\nof pure potentiality the law of giving\nand receiving karma\nintention desire\nleast effort\nand detachment and dharma\nthose seven principles guided me into a\nnew idea of what success is\nthe progressive realization of worthy\ngoals the ability to love have\ncompassion\nbut most importantly to identify with\nyour creative center instead of the\nprojection that's coming from that\ncenter because most of the time\nour experience of\nis coming from identifying with a\nprojection that has been created by the\nconditioned or ego mind now the ego mind\nis not going to disappear\nas long as you're in this body or\nactually you're not in the body the body\nis in you but whatever\nso it's not going to disappear but if\nyou keep it in the background and you're\naware of it\nand you ask yourself what am i motivated\nby and i have these little tricks in my\nmind pursue excellence ignore success\nand then everything happens\nsynchronicity meaningful coincidences\nthe state of grace effortless being\nspontaneous fulfillment of desire these\nare little things over the years that\ni've gleaned as my little catch phrases\nto remind myself yes\ni must\nlive a life that is based on love\nand if it's not based on love at the\nhighest level you know as\nthe vedanta say\nlove should radiate from you like light\nfrom a bonfire yeah not focused on\nanyone and not denied to anyone it's\njust the light of the sun i really think\nthat entertainment and education should\ngo hand in hand like\ni don't under i'm like why do we have\nlike billions of billions of dollars\ngoing into entertainment and yet we\ncan't add like 20 percent of that into\nlike just put education within the\nentertainment yeah it should be fun it\nshould be exciting like it's like i said\nin the beginning like it's what we're\nhere to do is learn and like create\nlearn create learn create it's just like\nthis circle and so it's like\ni don't know finding how to\nre\nreignite their passions is\nuh for themselves like fall in love with\nthemselves and then reignite the passion\nis\nreally really powerful to me and then by\nhelping these girls like i know that\nwhen they're they become moms they're\nthey're gonna understand not to give\naway their identity because one of the\nthings that i see in moms like so much\nof the time is they just like\nthey just become mom\nand i and i'm like no you're still\nthis girl before you're a mom and you're\nstill and i i i think one of the things\nthat i wish that i wish or i wish for\nall of this to help is\nto make sure that these girls\ncontinue on with who they are and then\nit's like who they are and then they're\nall of the subcategories all of the\ncharacters that they play go below that\num\nbecause i've seen it too much in\nmarriages like the\nthe female just loses her identity and\nthen becomes resentful\nit's what happened in my family i've\nseen it way too many times with the\npeople around me i'm just like how can\nhow can we heal this and this is like\nactually an ongoing conversation in my\nhead so\nit's just like yeah no i'm really glad\nyou brought that up i've i'm i'm working\non my second book right now and i talk a\nlot about how\nyou know in a partnership\nin any relationship the goal is to\nalways help each other find each other's\npurpose exactly because if you're not\ndoing that like when i think about me\nand my wife when i met my wife i was\nquite clear about what i wanted to do\nand she had loads of talents and skills\nbut didn't quite know what she was going\nto do with them\nand over the last five years of us being\nmarried she's really coming to her own\nand she's\nreally growing and flourishing and\nthriving and it's been beautiful to\nwatch\nbut i fully agree with you that it's\nyou can't think that oh no but your\npurpose is just to do this or your\npurpose just to look out look after the\nhome or your purpose even as a whoever\nthe role is doesn't matter what gender\nyou are but the idea of your purpose is\njust to make money for the house like\nthat's not a purpose like we all have so\nmuch more to do so i love that you\nbrought that up because you get lost in\nyour role yeah you you get lost in your\nroles that's like a real thing and\nthat's what i'm learning from acting as\nwell i was like don't get lost in your\nroles like don't do that like i've i've\nheard people do method acting that have\nactually lost relationships in the real\nworld because of that\nand so when i hear that i'm like wow\nexactly well it's a great example of\nwhat we do in real life as well yeah\num because i do think like at some point\nwith like a long-term relationship or\nfriendship whatever it is it's like you\nchoose\nto have them come with you\nand if you're not choosing that then\nthe relationship didn't work not because\nit was like you didn't bring them along\nor they didn't or you didn't see where\nthey were going and wanted to come with\nthem it is as much as like we love the\nbutterflies and we love all that this is\na team partnership yes like if you go we\ngo yeah you know yeah\nwe go and you can't be someone's purpose\nlike don't try and make it like no i am\nyour purpose like what i do is your\npurpose and my purpose is the same as\nyours it doesn't work it doesn't work\nlike that like you can't project your\npurpose onto another person\nand expect them to just want to live for\nthat right exactly exactly and then this\nis all of these things i've been\nlearning recently like in the last\ncouple of years especially with like\ngoing through like so many public\nrelationships and having\nthat be\noh god public relationships are\nterrified oh my god after i was like i'm\ngood after\nafter my last public relationship i was\nlike i'm good i'm so good i'm gonna just\nbe me in my own little world\nno one gets no um because\nnot only\nare you creating roles in the\nrelationship but now you have the public\ncreating characters of the people that\nyou are so it's like you're fighting\nlike\nyou're\nit's like you're having conversations\nwith like four different versions of the\nperson you're dating and you're like oh\nmy god like and half of them aren't even\nreal\nyeah\nit's like a foggy mirror you're just\nlike hello um so that's been really\ninteresting and then i always feel that\nrelationships are\nthe\nbest reflection as to where you are\nright because they're just like i'm just\nyour walking reflection right now that's\nwhy we're in this together right so i i\nalways get excited\nwhen i because i'm starting to just meet\nso many amazing people and i think\nthat's like what i've been learning as\nwell is just like\nthere's no there's no villain anymore\nit's like we can\nstay together or we can leave\nin good faith and good heart and like\nit's just it's not you know in high\nschool you're just like\nwhat\num now it's just like oh good like you\nyou did me a service by leaving because\nyou were being disserviced to me and you\nfor staying because you didn't feel so\nit's like at the end of the day it's all\nperfect like what can i it's all perfect\nyeah and then trusting that like what\nhelps you trust and accept that when\nmost of our minds hold on to the\nbut it could have been like this or\nbecause i feel that's what it is right\nit's always this battle between\nimagination and reality\nand a lot of us prefer our imagination\nyeah but then we have to yeah and then\nwe have to deal with reality and i oh\ni've read something actually i want to\nread this to you because i think you'll\nlike it wait let me find it let me find\nit i have to read it to you because i\ndon't want to mess it up you know it's\nit's you know when you like try and say\nsomething\nso this is by\njohann wolfgang and he said few people\nhave the imagination\nfor reality ooh\nand i read that and it literally\nlike it really that's like there's\nsomething it packs a punch right it's\nlike few people have the imagination for\nreality and i was thinking\nwow wow like i think my imagination's\ngood but if i had a really good\nimagination i'd be able to accept and\ntrust my reality well you're kind of\nlike i'm a great storyteller and the\nuniverse is like\nsit down\nsit down you can tell it later once it's\nover you can say it's yours but it was\nmine like that's like fully like what i\nexperienced that's beautiful\nyou know it's like\nsit down like you you write it while i\ncreate like you know what i mean like\nyou remember it you tell the story it's\nours you know but it's mine but it's\nours you write i'll edit it yeah and so\nlike that's kind of the relationship\nthat i always see and per your question\nearlier\nimagination and reality it's\ni always at this point with heartbreaks\nthere i don't see it as heartbreak\nanymore i see it as growing pains and\nthat's sometimes even worse because\nyou're just like i was i was good\ni was good with just this like i didn't\ni didn't i don't want to grow like i'm\ngood like i'm tired i just want to like\nwatch netflix and chill like i don't\nwant to evolve anymore\neven though i like just got here in\nretrospect but like it's still and so if\ni look at it as growing pains\nand then\nyou know as because we're all artists\nwe're all artists and so what i'll do\nnow and it's actually so intoxicating is\ni'll\ncreate\ni'll write poetry i'll write music\nbased off of the experience i mean we\nknow all of the biggest artists in the\nworld are like let me tell you about my\nheartbreak\nand then they get they blow up because\nof that and i'm just like\nthat's in all of us and so every single\ntime that i have a new experience of\nheartbreak or just not working out or\nwhatever it is\ni'm like there is there is gold in this\npain there's gold in this pain and i\ncannot wait to get it out i'm just like\nso i get i get this weird like i get\nheartbroken then i get really excited so\nit goes back and forth it's almost\num\nand i always i always tell people i'm\nlike when someone leaves your life\nit's okay to feel like you're grieving\nand death because the character that\nthey played in your life is not there\nanymore and so you are grieving someone\nthat's no longer there like you are like\nwhen i get broken up with with someone i\ntruly love and i'm crying and i'm in\nthat space it is\nvery similar\npain to when i lost my mom and so like i\nalways wish when any time like my\ngirlfriends me and she's like crying\nsobbing i'm just like this is valid\ndon't worry like feel it like feel it\nbecause you lost a character that you\nthought was in this season but it's not\nand like you thought he was going to be\nyour season finale he's not but it's all\ngood there's a season\n60 there's season 40 like you know\nthere's so many seasons in your life so\nit's just\ncoming back to\noh so if if he wasn't meant to be here\nthen\nwhat i attracted was more parts of\nmyself i became more me because he came\ninto my life and that is the biggest\nblessing i could have ever asked for\nlike i\nam a product of everyone that i've dated\nand i've and i've found i've fallen in\nlove with them\nand then those parts that i fall in love\nwith i've like\ni like i took them for myself and so\ni almost i'm getting to the point now\nwhere i don't grieve it anymore because\ni'm like well the person that i was in\nlove with i became\nand so that's so interesting how even if\nthat person wasn't there no the parts\nthat you thought you fell in love with\nlike how powerful it is like\nrelationships always fascinate me\nbecause i've always been a relationship\ngirl and\nseeing\nhow much\npeople grow after relationships it's\nlike i mean you guys have ever seen like\ndon't break a girl's heart you know what\ni mean like it hap i just i just watched\nmy sister do this and i'm just like\nshe's gonna be so good after this like\ni'm so\ngirls get hotter like it's just like\nit's such a vibe i i get i get so\nexcited because we need it's almost like\num the fire\nit's like it breaks your heart open so\nyou can light fire and i'm just like yes\nlike let's go so\nit sucks it always sucks um but once\nagain like back to that same belief that\ni had like the more he pulls you back\nit's like a slingshot he'll just like\nlaunch you for it so i just at the\nbeginning of 2020 i was just like\noh this is painful\nthis is painful i wonder what's going to\nhappen and\nnow it's like i can honestly say i've\nhelped more people than i ever would\nhave imagined and\ni'm also like playing with this belief\nand like i think all companies should is\nlike\ncan we just like stop this idea that\nlike\na company or a brand\nliving forever is success because it's\njust it's not like it's not sustainable\nthings evolves and so i always tell\nmyself i'm like whether this company\nstays whether it does that's not the\npoint that was never the point the point\nis is i've helped i would say over now\nlike 10 000 girls truly like actually\nhelp them like speaking to them talking\nto them one-on-one and that i will carry\nwith me they will carry with them like\nthat's good enough\nso it's like it's almost like this is\ngood enough it's okay it doesn't have to\nlast forever none of these things have\nto last forever i feel like we're so\nin in companies in general even though\nthis is a community but like companies\nit's like we're so thirsty\nto just be the monopoly and i'm like no\nyeah what is this world going to look\nlike if we're all trying to be\nmonopolies we can't yeah like\nare you good are you safe you have a\nroof over your head you can host people\nlike you're good\nyou're good like let's now how can we\nreturn the fate and and do more and it's\nlike\nso i\nthat's kind of where i'm at with weird\nwarriors is like it will continue and\nit's going to be amazing but\nthe impact is already there and i'm so\nhonored to like do have that impact on\nthem you know it's just because it's so\nreal no you i'm so glad that you're\nowning that\nand accepting that because i can agree\nwith you more i think we're fascinated\nwith\nlongevity and lasting till the end and\neven in relationships you stretch out\nfar longer than it needs to be just\nbecause we think end means failure\nfailure and and you're so spot on that\nthe impact\nthe end is insignificant really it's\nit's all about what's happening right\nnow in this place right today\nand forget i'm like it's right here fam\nyeah if you're making an impact yeah if\nyou're making an impact on all of these\nwomen today\nand they're impacting each other and\nyou're empowering\nthem to also become their own experts\nand discover their skills i mean\nthat's beautiful yeah and i'm so glad\nthat you made that point because i think\nour\nour obsession with making something lost\nis unhealthy everything yeah it's\nunhealthy it's unhealthy it's unhealthy\nand you're only 24 yeah right now yeah\nyeah which is amazing yeah like that's\nthat's that's the insane part here i\nfeel like i'm speaking to the oldest\nsoul in the world and then i have to\nremind myself\nand it's that's that's such a wonderful\nthing because you know you're carrying\nyour mother's energy in such a special\nway yeah no it comes through it's like\nit's it's so\nclear yeah that that you know and it's\ncool too because like for anyone who's\nlost someone\ny'all have a speed dial up there like\nyou guys can just like\ni literally i'm like mom\nand she's\nshe's right there and so i'm like you\nhave the strongest connection to the\nother side or whatever you believe it's\nreally truly whatever you believe\nbecause\ni'm pretty sure all this is made up i\nmean we're just like i'm sitting on an\nidea right now which trips me out\nsometimes i don't know like it's weird\num but\nit's like we have such a deep connection\nto the other side because we have that\nperson on the other side and so i\nutilize that as much as i can and\nwhenever i forget\num\ni just like i'm like how can i remember\nhow can i remember i think that's where\ni am right now i just i i will\num it's always the environment too so\nlike\ni'll choose incense i'll make lights\ncandles and i'll just sit down and i'll\nremember like whether that's just\nsitting in silence it's helping me\nremember but\nor just writing until something else\ncomes out that's what it's or talking to\na friend about it like i\ni think i'm at and i think we're all at\nthat point where it's not it's not so\nmuch you're learning something new\nit's almost you're just remembering\nwhat was already there on top of\neverything else per what my sister said\nabout the onions and just unraveling it\nand so um\nit's constantly coming back to that but\nlike i still you know still suffer like\nwe all suffer like it's all good it's\nall good\nhow have you got through that you know\nyou talked about this earlier and i\nthink\nyou've experienced this like you've and\nand i love what you said because we were\nwe were connecting on this beforehand\nand i i sometimes feel the same way\nbecause i thought i was going to be a\nmonk and that's\nliterally what i\nbuilt up so before that i had so many\npassions but\nmy parenting was ignore the passion do\nthe safe thing\nand so my passions were music my\npassions were spoken word and my passion\nwas philosophy\ndo you still write spoken books i do i\ndo yeah it's it's such a passion for me\nand i feel like a lot of my videos and a\nlot of my content is still\nwordplay and and has so much i still use\nthis spoken word in a different way\ntoday exactly and so that's so much a\npart of my life but it was like do the\nsafe thing and so i was studying\nbusiness and i thought i'd be an\ninvestment banker or a consultant or\nwhatever any of that stuff and then i\nbecame a monk that became my dream\nand\nmom dad yeah literally like from all of\nthat to that but even letting go of that\ni would say i'm most myself in what i do\ntoday\nand being a monk was part of that but\nit's not all of me\nand being in media which is what i am\nnow is not all of me it's a part of me\nand then being in the world of business\nwas a part of me it's not all of me and\ni think you are so right that we limit\nourselves we feel society limiting us\nand we feel we have to choose to be one\nthing and i think that the fact that\nyou're 24 years old and you've allowed\nyourself\nto continue to do this and you still do\ntoday i think that's so wonderful\nbecause i think a lot of people stay\nstuck until\nagain\nwanting to make something last yeah\nwanting to make something last and like\nevery single thing and i i will say this\nwith absolute certainty like every\nsingle thing that any of you guys have\nbeen doing and that you feel like was\nthe thing and then it's not it is\nserving yes\nwhat your thing is like ballet i spent\nliterally 20 almost 20 years every day\nfour five six hours a day i would be on\npoint and my feet still hurt you know\nlike it's just like but\nbecause of that it's translated into\nstorytelling i know how to use my body\nmy work ethic is insane i understand i\nknow how to take direction there is\ni know how to feel when i move like it\nhas literally serviced me in everything\ni've done and so it's just it's almost\njust like being okay with\nletting it go but then you don't\nactually let it go it's always there\nthat's the thing it's like it's always\nthere serving you yeah um\nand so that's that's how i feel with\npretty much everything i do my mom said\nanother thing my mom said is like she\ngoes um just be passionately curious\nbecause\nput so much pressure on us so my mom\nwould always just be like just be\ncurious\nlike just like follow your curiosities\nand if if it doesn't lead you anywhere\njust be like oh that was interesting and\nthen go over here and so that's that's\nwhat i do and like given i do i still of\ncourse have big dreams but like i let my\ncuriosity\ntake me\nlike\nand i don't\nthe big dream is not the goal it's like\nthe little moments that get up to it\nright right so like when i'm\nwhen i'm having a director meeting and\ni'm like talking to them about\na role or whatever it is it's like my\nintention in that call is to make the\ndirector feel good not to get the part\nand so just like having those little\nindirect of like wow that's such a huge\nthing you just dropped yeah\nthat's a huge thing it's who you are\nit's who all of us are it's like if you\ncan\nstop going well this is my goal to like\nmy intention i think intentions are\nactually the most underrated most\npowerful things i've ever like i still\nlearn about how we have an intention 24\n7 with everything every single thing we\ndo we just like sometimes we're aware of\nit sometimes we're not and so when you\ncan put an attention an intention on\nsomething before you do it it's\nit's crazy how powerful it is so it's\nlike\ni always make sure because at the end of\nthe day and this is kind of what we're\nall looking for i think even more so\nthan the diploma than the thing and the\ndegree is someone that we connect to\nsomeone that we feel close to someone\nthat we almost feel like we've already\nmet before like that essence comes from\nthe intention\nof making that person feel connected\nnot from\ni hope i'm right for this i hope i'm\nthis and so like i whenever i hire from\nmy company that's my intention i was\nlike i don't really i don't care where\nyou went to college\nwhy would i care like i care about who\nyou are like what like what's your like\nwhat's your intention like\nhow are you gonna be fun to work with\nlike are we gonna because ideally i want\nyou to be in this for the long run and\nso do i wanna be talking to you for the\nnext five to ten years like what does\nthat look like and so having that\nperspective on when it comes to jobs\nwhen it comes to\nmeetings anything ever is like the human\nconnection should go first no matter\nwhat no matter how bad you want it like\nthe human connection is first um that's\nactually\nbeen the best like magic trick my mom\ntaught me because it's like it it always\nit always provides what i need and then\nwhat the other person needs so for\ninstance i was like\nvery excited for this role that i almost\ngot a couple weeks ago i was very\nexcited i won't say any names\nand\nhe was so sweet and we were talking we\nwere having such a good time and i\nreally understood the character and it\nwas really great but then you know\nbecause i don't i'm not very experienced\nin the space he was like we're gonna\nchoose someone else and i was like\nthat's completely fine but then i was\nsitting in meditation and i had this\nurge to write him an email and i didn't\ni didn't know why because my goal wasn't\nnecessarily to get the part i just\nalmost felt like the the connection of\nme and him wasn't finished and so i just\nsent him a thank you and i was like\nthank you so much for speaking giving me\nyour time like learning about me because\nwho i am matters because you need to get\nto know if i fit the care like all of\nthese things and because of that it\nalmost solidified our relationship and\nthat but that wasn't my intention my\nintention was just like this isn't over\ni don't know why and i'm just gonna sit\ndown and see so like listening to\nalmost like letting it overpower whether\nor not\n[Music]\nwhat happened it's like if you don't\nfeel like it's finished like go in there\nwith the intention\nthat\nyou want to just solidify\nthe mirror that you guys are reflecting\ntowards each other as opposed to like\nthe opportunity that's kind of on the\nsidelines yeah um so that's been a huge\ntool huge it's like actually like the\nprobably the reason i'm here to be\nhonest\nso\ncheck it out\nshout out tool did you say\ni love that today i've discovered how\nfunny you are which is great which is\nreally awesome which is really awesome\nso i i love that we're going to have so\nmany memes made out of this interview\nfor you\nthere's going to be so many great ones\nalexis is there something that i haven't\nasked you about that's like on your mind\nyou're like i have to share this i want\nto share i want to say this uh before we\ngo into the final five but i want to\nknow if there's anything that you're\nfeeling intuitively as you are just\nthank you so much like actually thank\nyou so much i'm going to deteriorate\njust like saying it but thank you i feel\nlike i don't know\nit was weird like once i finally\nsolidified this podcast with you\nthere something like clicked inside of\nme and i was like\nlike i am becoming the person i want to\nbe and like i and so just like thank you\nfor showing that to me because it really\ni i'm not yeah i just thank you i have\nno i just like words don't\nthey they're not it right now so but\nthank you\nyeah so just that's it that's all i have\nto say\ni love that i love that that means the\nworld to me and and i'm and i'm hoping\nthat\nthat synergy and synchronicity continues\nand you know this is the beginning of a\ngreat friendship so\nthat's that's that's my hope i i i\nreally believe that\nhonestly the podcast for me has either\nbeen a place where\ni had a lot of relationships offline\nthat people didn't know the types of\nconversations we were having and so the\npodcast was a great way of me sharing\nhey i'm really good friends with the\nperson this is what we talk about\nand i want everyone to hear it\nand then it's also been the opposite\nwhere it's been like here's someone i'm\nreally interested to get to know\nand i wanted to start a friendship and\nso it's perfect yeah and so the podcast\nfor me has been so much more than and\nit's what you're saying about a\ncommunity more than a company or a brand\nlike the podcast for me is not a\nshow like that's that's not the point of\nit like it's it's a it's a way i can get\nto know humans that i'm interested in or\ni find interesting and help people learn\nabout them so actually i should be\nthanking you\nbecause\nyou know i think sitting down with you\ntoday has just\ncompletely blown my mind and opened up\nmy mind to just so many possibilities as\nto\nhow\nsomeone\nwho's navigated so many stressful\nsituations and i think the closer you\nget to it the more you realize how hard\nit is so when i was a young kid and i\ngrew up in london i knew no one in the\nentertainment industry i was not in la\nor hollywood everyone in my area was you\nknow\nnot going off to work in anything to do\nwith the world i'm in now\nand because of that you look at people\nand you go oh life must be easy for you\nyou guys have money you guys have fame\nuh you guys are attractive you you m\nlife why are you complaining right\nand as i've got closer to the industry\ncloser to people that i coach that i\nwork with clients of mine\ni've only just had more compassion\nfor everyone\nboth the people that are\nlike me sitting back there judging and\nthen both the people are in this\nsituation because i realized we're all\njust feeling some type of pain\nand the more we can rise to that point\nwithout judgment\nthe better it's going to be for us\nbecause we can evolve together yeah if\nwe expect anyone who's successful to be\nalways happy then what we're saying is\nwhen i become successful i have to\nalways be happy\nand that pressure is right back on us\nit's interesting how that works and it's\nalmost like um\nyeah anything that we direct outwards\nis an exact manifestation of what's\ngoing to happen inside of us and so we\nhave to be so careful with our words\nlike i don't why do you think they call\nit spelling\nspells like i'm like wow\nthat's true that's good i've not heard\nthat before i like that that's good the\nwords are like i am oh my god\nwhen i hear girls say like i am\nugly or i am i'm just like\nno\nno like you can no i refuse to let you\nsay that about yourself because you\nwould never say that about your daughter\nyou would never say that about your\nfriend and so it's\nit truly is like having these honest\nconversations with anyone at any level\nhas been eye-opening to me and that's\none of the reasons why i've always loved\nthe podcast so much because i got to\nactually just see\nthe person and not the characters that i\nsee them play\nin life um\nso that's really it's really inspiring\nand then also knowing that\npain happens on any level like pain is\npain you know like\nme\nlosing someone from a breakup is just as\npainful as me losing my mom to death and\ni was like that was a weird that was\nweird i was like and you almost feel\nguilty or like you feel like can i feel\nthat do i allow myself to so it's like\nyeah validating on any level because\nthat's actually what connects us as well\nand and i almost feel like until we\num we have\nthe goal right now is to to connect at\nevery level of being human and then from\nthere i mean i i'm pretty sure like an\nevolution would happen which would be\nreally cool that'd be really cool i'd be\nlike whoa\ncan you imagine if we had everyone at\nthe same time be like love yeah\ncan you\nthat would be crazy i've heard i'm sure\nyou've like heard of those stories where\nlike um\nthey have like monks praying at same at\nthe all at the same time like 3000\nmonths or whatever and like the crime\nrates goes down in the city\ni've definitely heard i've seen studies\non that before yeah same um but just\nthose kinds of scenarios would be like i\nthink that's\nthe i that that's what that's what my\nwork\nwould ideally my like\nhard work i guess is what it's there for\nis to like have just\nmore moments of like just people being\nan absolute like love and even when i\ncan facilitate like we were talking\nabout hosting and how like it's like i\nhave the big house if you're not\nputting everyone in it like posting it\nlike why do i have a balcony i'm not\ngonna do anything on it like i'm gonna\nhave all my friends like there and like\nhost people and like why do i have more\nthan one bedroom so i can let my friends\nbe there and like just hosting and\nhaving that environment where like we\ncome together and bring like real\nconnection it is\nso it's it's helping the planet so much\nmore than we know i've got two more\nquestions for you before we go into the\nfinal five because i've just there's so\nmany things i can talk to you about uh\nthe first question i want to ask you was\naround your passion for acting now\nso\nyou know what right now is making you so\npassionately curious about acting what\nis it about\nroles what is it about your development\nas an artist\nthat connects you so much to acting\nit's it's almost like proving to myself\nhow many\ndifferent\npersons or identities i can be i think\nit's like\nwe almost i feel\neven though i seem outgoing i'm actually\nquite terrified all the time\num and i would say i'm like an ambiver\nlike an in-between\nbut when it comes\nto acting i don't have a choice\nlike i have to show up as this person\nif i'm nervous like it doesn't matter\nand like once i'm not thinking about\nlines once i'm like in that state where\ni just like have it memorized to the\nheart and i can just be there\num it's it's similar to flow state i'm\nsure you've written i've read all i love\nflow state\nyeah i love this it is the goal yes for\neverything always\nso it puts me in flow state basically i\ndon't there's no time i don't remember\ni'm not thinking about myself i'm not\nthinking about my body i'm not thinking\nthere's it's just i'm just here\nand like similar similar to the way like\nwhen you surf like you're on a wave it's\nlike it's those like 30 seconds of just\nlike i blacked out i wasn't even there\nno and you're saying that you can\nactually surf so you've actually had\nthat experience\nlike most people use that analogy but\nwe've never served so but you actually\nsaid\nanything yeah yeah just like any but you\ncan actually serve yeah i deserve\ndecently not good enough to the point\nwhere i'm like\nthat guy in the surf being like where'd\nyou catch my wave bro i'm like but just\nthose moments like i think i'm right now\ni'm just searching for those moments in\nmy life i'm just like\nwhen am i am i going to forget time here\nam i going to free a time here and so\nacting is just one of those things that\ni've\nseen is such a powerful\nand also it's it's best because i think\ni get to lose track of time with another\nperson and i feel like like connection\nis so strong for me and so it's like i\nremember oh my god this was such a cool\nmoment on my first set\num it was an older actor he's been\naround for a long time i'm sure you know\nhim i don't remember his name but he was\nvery very kind and we had a scene\ntogether where he was kind of just like\num\nlike getting in my face about something\num basically saying that i like wasn't\nworthy or what i don't know and i was\njust like i got this i got this\ni got this scene don't worry guys um\nand he was like getting in my face and i\njust remember a moment where like we\nlike lost i just it was i just wasn't\nthere and he wasn't there and it was\njust a pure moment and i wasn't acting\nand i was actually feeling everything\nand then afterwards he comes to me and\nhe looked at me at crafty's the little\nuh snack area he was like you get it\nhe was like you get it don't you i was\nlike yeah and he was like keep doing it\nkid like keep doing it it's amazing\nand he was like you get it\nand he was like\nhe almost it was almost as if he like\nsaid like\nyou're closer to\nsource in those moments like and so he\nlooked at me like you get it and i just\nflipped out after because i was eating\nbanana being like i did it i did it\ni get it and so after that i was like\nokay this is like what i meant to do now\nfor now i guess\nand like we'll see where that goes\num but yeah i just once again like the\nintention\nthe paths change but the intention stays\nthe same\nso i think that's what keeps me again\nloved that i just love that yeah i\ncouldn't agree more yeah i think that's\nbeen the challenge for so many people we\ntry and keep our path the same\nand then but we don't know our attention\nyeah we don't have our attention yeah\nyeah but keeping your intention the same\nand the path changing oh i can so relate\nto that so back to those notes yeah like\nany intentions that you guys have like\nany of it just\nwrite it down so at least you just know\nyeah you just know because i forget my\nintentions of course yeah you have to\nrepeat them daily i repeat them daily in\nmy prayer in my affirmation\nat the beginning and end of the day i\nhave to exactly exactly and then from\nthere it almost like i\nand this is this may be a weird belief\nbut i've been seeing this a lot in my\nlife all the best things in my life i\ndidn't work for\nand i keep seeing that as a pattern i'm\nlike maybe god maybe god doesn't want us\nto struggle like the way like\nit's because everything that i've\nstruggled for wasn't meant for me so\nthat's been really interesting of almost\nbeing like\nyou take the rings like you take the\nreins i'll create the intention but you\ncreate the story and like i'll trust the\npath and like whatever that is like\nlet's go like let's make it fun right\nbecause like i i do feel like\nthe more you can give\nto god to like if he if he gives you\nlike a ball a red ball for instance like\nlike if you have fun and you're playing\nwith it he's gonna be like oh he's she's\nplaying with it i'll give her something\nelse like oh and it's just like it's\nalmost like entertain like show him or\nshow the universe that like you're so\nstoked of what it gave you that it wants\nto give you more like you almost you\nknow when like you have i have a puppy\nher name's angel and whenever i give her\na treat she's so stoked that i ever\ntreat that i'm like i gotta give you\nanother one\nand so like i almost feel like that's\nand then when i walk my dog and she like\nis not least trained yet so she'll just\nbe like like choking yourself out trying\nto like go everywhere and i'm just like\nis this what i look like\noh no i learned so much from dogs also\nwhen a dog my dog is obsessed with a\nball\none ball in particular it's gross i\ncan't believe she still has it i'm just\nlike oh my god um\nso obsessed with this ball and i'm like\nthat is amazing and literally her only\ngoal with this ball is to give it back\nto me so that i can throw it so she can\ncatch it so i can give it back to her\nshoot there's there's no point to this\nwhatsoever and so it showed me i was\nlike\ndo it just for the act like don't do it\nfor like the the idea the goal or the\ndream just just do it and so like\nwhenever i play ball with her i practice\nthat i'm like i'm acting just because\nit's fun because i just do it or i'm\ncreating this company because it's fun\nand i just this is just what i do like i\njust it's just fun and like because\nevery single time i've gotten caught up\nin like the huge image of things is like\nwhen i've lost sight\nof my heart's path and i'm just like ah\nyeah so\nbut the greatness isn't within that path\nlike for sure but it's never like the\nsame path as you would see because it's\nliterally just you playing with a ball\nand you're just like what's the point\ngod yeah like just wait like just keep\ndoing it for fun yeah yeah keep doing it\nfor fun you're doing it for fun and so i\nalmost and like now that i'm 24 i'm i'm\nin this adult life and i'm just like\ndo i need to get serious now\nbut it's so strong you i feel it heavy\non me now yeah i need a schedule i need\nto wake up this time and\ngod's like no you're not lazy if you\nsleep in that's a belief let's get rid\nof that like no you're not like did you\nno it's just\nliterally i'm now taking off layers that\ni just got i'm like whoa what is this\nwhat and now that i'm coming into my\nmid-20s i'm just like\nwhat\nis this not supposed to be fun anymore\nbecause like that's what i've heard and\nthat's what i like see a lot of times\nbut i just refuse because it's so\ninspiring to meet\ni have a few friends that are like i\nwould say like in their 50s or 16s and\nthey're like\nchildren having the best in their life\nyeah\nand everything works out for them\neverything works out for them and i'm\njust like\nthat is\nif i'm gonna tell a story i'd rather it\nbe like that yeah i've added play back\ninto my life so much like play is like\none of my number one values that's why i\ngot a dog in life yeah you're going to\nthe park yes not for the dog for you but\nyou're going to the park yeah i just\nwant more play in my life and there was\na there was a beautiful quote by richard\nbranson where he said that\nyou know you don't stop playing because\nyou get old you get old because you stop\nplaying\nand and i love that because it's it's\nbeen so big for me i'm at a place in my\nlife from like i play is a huge value\nand it sounds insane and people don't\nget it i just got back from miami i was\nthere for two weeks and we were on a\nreally busy schedule we were working\nfrom like 8 a.m to 9 00 p.m every single\nday but at 9 00 pm every day we'd go and\nplay paddle tennis from 9 to 11 yes and\ni felt like a kid every night where i\nwas just waiting to be out in the paddle\ncourt and i was just like have you ever\nplayed paddle tennis okay it's amazing\nit's it's i i am the biggest advocate of\nthis sport i've introduced many\nbut but play is just such a big value\nfor me now yeah and even when i'm with\nfriends i'm like what can we do that's\nplayful that's playful like we've been\ni've been doing crazy things with\nfriends like archery and like painting\nlessons and whatever it is because i\njust want to play you just want to play\nand it's it it's\nit's where we create new passions play\nis where we create new passions so also\nboredom i i\nalways am like bornhem is so valuable\nespecially now with our phones and like\nall of this instant gratification and\nwe've heard a million times and it's all\nknown now but like\nfor real though like i can't even drive\nwithout being like\ndon't text and drive but look at all\nthese billboards yeah you know it's\nweird i'm just like they're telling and\nit's just all of this is trying\neverything is trying to get your\nintention everything is trying to get\nyour attention like to the tea\nand so i'm like okay\nhow do i work against this and it's only\ngoing to get probably more intense i\nwould assume so\num\nso that's like literally i'll say it\nagain that's why i got a dog that's like\nfully why i got a dog because i was like\ni need something that's i'm gonna get\nbad news on the phone i'm like okay bye\nand then the dog's just like\nokay here so you know how like in any\nlike disney like movie like pixar\nwhatever there's always a sidekick yes\ntangled the chameleon like there's a\nbunny and the abominable snowman yeah\nthere is always like this really funny\ncomical relief olaf in frozen yeah\nspirit animal yeah\ni was like i need to i want a sidekick\nlike i want that idiot that's just like\nrunning and hitting a wall while i'm\ntrying to like do business like i can we\nneed that like that's so cool yeah so\nlike movies are so powerful in the way\nthat they like kind of they give us\ncharacters to like replicate and so i've\nalmost like whenever i watch a movie i'm\njust like i like that character like\nthat character is really cool like one\nof the shows that i actually like loved\ngrowing up with is entourage yeah okay\ni've got a funny story to tell you about\nandroid so i was a monk when entourage\nwas famous so i never watched it so i\ndidn't know what it was so my wife just\nmade me watch entourage so we literally\njust finished it\nit's one of the best shows ever it's\namazing yeah\ni would watch it i i would watch it\nagain i loved it i literally just\nwatched it this year exactly so it's\nlike you have like the characters around\nyou that are just like they're\nthey're so needed and you don't know why\nbut they're so needed like they're so\nimportant to the story and that's how i\nlook at all of my friends i'm like you\nguys are so like\ncreating your your your show like he's\nlike and in a healthy way of course\nbecause but it's taught me a lot like\nas much as hollywood is very um toxic\nand and dangerous in ways but it's also\na great way to get to understand how you\nwant your life show to go like it's just\nlike i can find\nparts of myself in different\nlike uh have you watched dave yet no oh\nno no i have what what's the first\nseason not the second yeah i need to get\nit in my life like he's so funny i was\njust like he's just like he's there\nalways making jokes always there always\nholding it together always holding\nstrong like you need that per and\nsometimes it's you that's that person\nbut i always that really helps me just\nlike understand the the thing i'm doing\nso it sounds like everyone needs to\nrevisit their childhood or remember and\nand write a memoir even if it's not a\nmemoir that gets published and goes out\nto the world it almost feels like\nreflecting is really important what what\nhelped you were you speaking to friends\nfrom back then or were you speaking to\nyour\nyou know who who are you connecting with\nto to reignite some of those memories\noh everyone in the memories you know i\ncalled\nmy mom my brother um my cousins who i\ngrew up with friends from the time i\ncorroborated the stories because memory\nis a weird thing you know i remember it\na certain way somebody else remembers it\na certain way\nand there was this one story i remember\ni was kicked out of moma for touching a\npainting when i was 15 16 or something\nand\ni remember\nthat day being wonderful because we went\nto the statue of liberty after and like\nyou know\nwe\nwe got hot dogs and we were walking\naround new york city and i remember it\nbeing like oh i touched you know a\npainting that's so cool that i touched i\nthink it was a starry night\nand\nmy cousins who were with me remember the\nday completely differently they were\ntortured embarrassed my cousin was an\nart student she was like you got me\nkicked out of moma and like\ni was like wow i didn't remember that at\nall\nthat's brilliant was that your was that\nyour rebellious side or was that a\nmistake\nor was it curious just curious\ni just i feel like\nrules sometimes\nand trust me i mean i'm in a public\nprofession i have to follow them\nbut um you know sometimes we conform to\nrules that\njust sort of stop our ability to grow\nand\nunless it's like hurting someone or\nsomething which by touching starry night\ni probably was hurting the painting\nbut at that time i didn't know\nthe value of the paint the value of the\npainting just went up it just went up\nbut you know like otherwise i think like\nyou've got to sometimes you have to push\nthe envelope\nthere's been too many generations that\nhave been defined by what people think\nyou know we can achieve or\nyou know limitations that have been\nimposed because of\npeople not being able to\nthink or dream big enough um and i think\nit's every generation's responsibility\nto show the endless possibilities to the\nnext\nyeah you've definitely done that i mean\nyou're constantly breaking rules in in\nyour career and your journey starting\nfrom touching that pain to get moma all\nthe way through today\nbut\nwas that was that an energy and a\nmindset that you believe you had at that\nyoung age or is that something you think\nyou gradually developed where did that\nconfidence come from because when i hear\nyou say today it comes with confidence\nobviously it comes with having done it\nand i think there are a lot of people\nout there who may feel that way but they\nthen also feel\ninsecure that are they the right person\nto do that do they have permission to do\nthat there's there's something that then\nstill holds them back what was it for\nyou that allowed you to go all the way\nwell two things uh my parents for sure i\ngrew up in an environment where i was\nnot shamed for my ideas\num at 12 years old i told my parents i\nwanted to live in america with my aunt\nand you know my parents were like bye\npeace you know it was fine we had a\nlogical pro and con conversation i was\nraised sort of to have opinions even if\nthe room was hostile\num so i think that really gave me a\nsense of self and i think it's really\nimportant in parenting for us to treat\nour children like they're developing\ntheir own minds because that's so\nimportant\nfor\nthem to have a sense of self and feel\nlike you know they're not robots but\nthey're actually thinking and they have\na say in their decisions it really\nlends for\nadults being able to have a sense of\nconfidence and second\nto really understand and accept that\nconfidence is not something you always\nneed you don't you know so put it in a\nbackpack it's okay give it a break let\nit be in your purse let it be in your\nwallet let it chill for a second feel\ninsecure feel like scared just feel\nafraid feel vulnerable\num but when you need the confidence and\nyou walk into that room you'll have it\nbecause you didn't keep using it you\ndidn't need to constantly have a you\nknow cover of or um sort of like a\nuniform of confidence you don't have to\nalways show confidence you don't have to\nexude confidence you never you don't\nyou just have to pull it out when you\nneed it and then when it's in the\nreserve it's so much more powerful\nbecause you're allowing yourself to be\nall the things i feel insecure i'm\nterrified that this book is coming out\nit's the first time i've ever written\nand i've never been so personal\nin my whole life i've been a public\nperson for 20 years\nnever scratched beneath the surface i've\ngotten away with sharing whatever i\nwanted to share about my life and not\nmore you know my story is\npeople think they know it but they\nreally don't\nand i've managed that for 20 years but i\nthink\ni\nnow on the other side of 35 was\nfeeling a sense of confidence and a\nsense of self in my capabilities\nin what i bring to the table it only\ntook 20 years for me to get there but i\ngot there\num and i think all those insecurities\nthat i address in my book don't scare me\nthat much anymore as they did at that\ntime as you know they worried me and i\nwas like i don't want to talk about it\nnobody needs to\nknow about my life and you know but now\ni'm at a place where i'm just like well\nit's still on my terms and\num you know i'm hoping that\npeople maybe get to know me a little bit\nmore than a fashion meme or a headline\nor something like that\nyeah i i think that's what i love about\nit from the few pages that i've i've\nflicked through i definitely see you\nallowing yourself and that's that's the\npower of a book though and so i relate\nto that insecurity my first book came\nout last september i know we know your\nfirst book i was i have it\ni was so oh that's awesome i'm so glad\nyou have it i was i was so nervous so i\ncan i know what you mean by that and\nespecially for you at this stage in your\ncareer of yours is a memoir mine had\npart stories it wasn't a memoir so i can\nonly imagine but\ni see you doing and books are so\npowerful for that and that's why i\nreally hope everyone who's listening and\nwatching right now if you're enjoying\nthis conversation\ngo and pick up the book because i do\nthink that media the news the the short\nmeme the clip it portrays such a\nlimited view of of someone like yourself\nand it's a superficial view really yeah\nand you\nand it's okay it's a choice also i yes i\nwant to for people to consume only a\npart of me you know i want to be able to\npreserve\nmy humanity my family my life my\nopinions i may have chosen a public\nprofession but i'm not an elected\nofficial i don't owe an explanation to\nanyone for the choices that i make you\nknow i'm here to create work i'm doing a\njob just like everybody else mine\nhappens to be in entertainment and it\nhappens to have a lot of cameras on my\nface it's fine you know i made a i made\nthat deal with the devil so i've kind of\nmade peace with the fact that\ni i prefer it being from a distance um\nbut at the same time i think now\ni've\nbeen a public person for more than half\nmy life it's my normal and\nonly now have i reached a point where\ni'm\nallowing the walls to sort of fall down\nand\nletting whoever wants to know me get to\nknow me as the person that i am before\nthat i was very protective of\nwho i was because maybe i was insecure\nabout who i was or i was i still didn't\nhave a sense of self i don't know\nbut i think in the journey of life i've\nreached a place where you know i'm i'm\ngood with who i am yeah so\nwhat's that's wonderful to hear by the\nway and and i can feel it off your\nenergy what's the part of yourself in\nthis book\nthat you share that you think most\npeople are going to be surprised by\nwhere you think that people may just be\nlike what like and i'm sure there's many\nbut but what's something that stands out\num\nit's there there are a few um\nwhich i think\npeople may be surprised by that i was\nvulnerable enough to discuss um\nand\ni think my my failures\nmy\nstruggles rejections\num\nsadnesses\nthat um i've never really people have\nnever seen\ni always wear a brave front most women\nin\nlike\nyou know tough jobs have to always have\nlike a little bit more of a stronger\nfront um to be taken seriously i built\nthat very early\num at 18 to be thrown into\nthe limelight\nof this job i mean\nyou know it you've been in it for a long\ntime you know it's it's a crazy\nprofession the expectations the pressure\num\nyou know to deliver under that scrutiny\num to be artistic to yet have a point of\nview to be unique not you know have your\nown trajectory because that's the only\nway it'll work um you know nobody wants\nme twos in the entertainment business\nyou want new kind of you know you have\nto always have a sense of evolution so\nit was really really\nscary in in the beginning and um\ni think everything just changes with\ntime and this was one of the good\nchanges that came out of it\nfor me yeah no absolutely and i'm hoping\nthat\ni wonder do you think that's changing\nnow if someone's coming into the\nentertainment industry today at 18 or do\nyou think it hasn't changed where's your\nperception on that when you're guiding\nyoung artists or seeing people that you\nfollow on social media or you know\nwhatever it may be\nare you feeling it's changing has it\nimproved or or no the pressure you mean\nuh not the pressure more the\nlike you were saying like you when you\ncame to the industry you had to put on a\nbrave front you had to wear that face it\nwas the only way to survive do you feel\nit's the same now for young talent as\nwell\ni i think\nwell i was talking about definitely as a\nfemale in yeah\nbusiness oh as a female okay yes um i\nthink so i think um\nyou know um\nit's still hard when you're starting out\nfor women to be taken seriously for your\nideas to be given the kind of credence\nthat\num\na man's would as quickly probably you\nknow um especially in professions where\nyou you know\nnormally you don't see women because\nyou know women have never been pushed in\nthat direction or women have never\nwanted to go in that direction because\nit was never normalized for them that\ntheir ambitions could go in that\ndirection business politics um you know\nto be heads of companies um engineering\nlike you know coding um policy making\nlike stuff like that lawyers women\nhave just about in the last few\ngenerations been coming to the fore and\nyou know are standing neck to neck with\nguys but it's still an anomaly it's\nstill not as normal in terms of numbers\nit's still not equal so until that\nhappens i think it will be hard for\num\nyou know young girls to be sick and\ntaken seriously when they come into\nprofessions that are predominantly male\num but it's okay\num you know women before us have fought\nthe fight and\nwomen after us will fight the fight\nit'll just hopefully not be the same\nfight hopefully our generation will\nnot let\nour kids inherit our problems you know\num\nas women um\nwe are definitely working in that\ndirection but i think as the world needs\nto sit up and take notice that\nthis demand is loud because it's a\nrequirement this demand is loud because\nthat's what's right and that is the\nreflection of the world women are 50 of\nit and we should be reflected in\num\nyou know every area and basically\nfeminism is that right like\ndon't decide for me\nwhat i should be doing when i should be\ndoing it and how i should be doing it\njust like men have had that freedom give\nme that as well yeah so\ni guess it's that\nsorry\ncompletely no no no you're not deviating\nat all it's a strong message and i stand\nby it so it's uh it's a great message\nand\nand it's really interesting\nwhere male privilege is a really\ninteresting thing to reflect on i\nremember when i first started reflecting\non it was a prob even really a few years\nback and i feel very much i was raised\nby my mom and i have a younger sister so\ni'm very close to the women in my life\nbut\nit started to strike me in a crazy way\nthat i grew up\nhaving had certain dreams of becoming\nsomething that my sister couldn't have\nhad\nand and that wasn't because of the way\nwe were parented it was because of what\nyou saw and and when that really hit me\nand i stood and looked at that and i\noften encourage a lot of my friends in\nthat direction too i'm like if you\nreally think about if they have a son\nand a daughter i'm like if you really\nthink about some of the options that\ndon't seem available to your daughter\nthat she may never consider\na career and i really think that that\nconsideration\nis where the equality is like the\nopportunity of even having that idea of\ni could do that opportunity of\nof having choice i think you know a lot\nof women we are i'm i'm extremely\nprivileged that i was raised by a\nfeminist i'm married to a feminist um\ni'm extremely privileged that my parents\nwhich is why i brought up parenting um\nearlier\na big reason i have a sense of\nconfidence and i am on this side this\nside of the fight because\num it's not as hard as it is on so many\nwomen around the world i still had to\nfight of course i had to break down the\ndoors and i had to you know prove a\npoint to be taken seriously i was kicked\nout of movies and replaced and you know\nall the things\nbut\ni still had it so much easier there are\nwomen around the world that don't have a\nsay in their life that are married off\nwhen you know other people decide that\npeople choose who they are married to\nwhether they can work or not when they\nshould have children what kind of\nchildren they should have and that\ndoesn't mean giving up culture that\ndoesn't mean giving up tradition\nyou know it just means creating\nopportunity my father told me when i was\nvery very young my mom since i was nine\nyears old you will have financial\nindependence before anything you do it\ndoesn't matter whose daughter you are it\ndoesn't matter um you know who you're\nmarried married to you'll stand on your\nown feet and there's such a power to\nthat um to having you know to be raised\nby parents who put that in my head so i\nwas ambitious from\n12 years old i decided every year what i\nwanted to be\nand it changed every year\ni i love hearing that and i it reminded\nme of something you've said before when\nyou were speaking about your father\nthere\nabout how\nuh nick for you shares this same\nadmiration of your power\nand and your ambition\nand and feels you know supportive and\nexcited and enthusiastic about\nthe way you carry yourself\ntell us a bit about how\ni feel like that's such an important\nthing for both them anyone in a\nrelationship to feel like their partner\nis inspired by their values their\nbeliefs and their dreams\nwhat has it felt like in the past where\nyou feel like you haven't had that and\nif someone who's listening or watching\nis feeling like maybe i don't have that\nhow does how do you think someone can\nnavigate that or to ultimately attract\nthe partner that that does have that\nwhat's that journey like because i think\na lot of people\nfeel like they're with someone who may\nnot understand or get their dreams\nespecially when they're starting out\nthen it's the wrong person for you and\nif you have the\num\nespecially if you're starting out and\nyou know you're testing the waters and\ni think it's so crucial\nif you have a choice in your life to end\nup\nwith someone who\nis not like enthused by your dreams is\nat least interested in them\nis at least excited about them or\nyou know is at least um\nencouraging\nlike that's that's exciting\num because you know everyone's busy and\neveryone has a thing in their lives but\nto take to make the effort\nto um\nto make the effort to make you feel like\nyour dreams are as important as the\nother one is such a gift and\num i have been very blessed to have that\nyou know i find wherever you are in your\nrelationship obviously you and nick lead\nextremely busy lives\nyou know my wife and i lead busy lives\nand i feel even if someone's not in the\nentertainment industry or the media\nindustry\neveryone feels like they live busy lives\nwhat does support look like\nwhen two people are busy driven and\nambitious because you obviously have it\nyou're speaking about it right now and\nit's beautiful what does that actually\nlook like in a real practical sense\nobviously the last six months or the\nlast 12 months have been different\nbut in reality what does that look like\nbecause i feel that maybe sometimes we\nhave false expectations sometimes you\nwant\nyou know it's not natural that you can\nbe at every show nick does it's not\nnatural for him to be at every set\nyou're doing same with me and my wife\nlike my wife can't be at every event i'm\nspeaking at i can't be at every uh\ninterview or something she's doing\nwhat does support look like what does\nlove look like in a very real practical\nsense\ni think when it comes to support\nspecifically i think\ngiving the other person the space\num\nto do what they're doing is very\nimportant without\nyou know them feeling like oh my like\nfor example i'm here in london for a\nyear right now and nick is filming in la\num\nand i can't travel but before the hall\nhe made sure he was here for two months\nto settle me in you know\nto make sure that the house was all set\nup and everything was sorted and we were\ntogether for the holidays that's because\nhe was free um at the end of the month\nand that support um you know it doesn't\nhave to be\nlarge it doesn't have to be\nuh um\nyou know a big expression of\ni don't know love and or big gifts it's\nnot it's it's about giving space it's\nabout giving freedom it's about\nappreciation and i find this one thing\nreally helpful um\ni always think about when you know he's\nbusy or he's having a crazy day which i\nhe does for me as well which is amazing\nand everyone can follow this and it's\nsuper easy\num is to think about how can i make that\nperson's day easier\njust like and that's such a lovely\nloving thing just sometimes i'm you know\nback to back especially when i was doing\npromo i was doing like 20 interviews and\nsuddenly there'd be like a really nice\ncocktail that would come in in the\nevening or suddenly there would be a\nreally nice like cup of coffee or you\nknow something to eat for me that would\ncome in and it's just like so\nsweet to think about that or if i'm\nsitting outside you know you'll bring a\nblanket and put it it's just being\nthoughtful and aware\nabout\nyour person and you know that's the\ngreatest form of love is\nshowing it without really\nasking for it\nyeah that's such a great piece of advice\ni love that to be you you said to be\nthoughtfully aware\nand i think that's that's so true and\nand the beautiful thing about everything\nyou just said is that it's it's free\nit's cheap it's small it's simple it's\nin it's it's exciting it's the best gift\nyeah and it's the best gift yeah when\nyou feel like someone's\nin tune with you and and your emotions\nand how you feel\nhow you might be tired or how you might\nbe sleepy or how you might be cold like\nthose small things when you feel\nsomeone's aware and and i love that\npiece of advice i think it's something\nthat everyone's definitely learned more\nabout in the pandemic\nwhere we're exposed to each other\ntell me a bit about the the title\nunfinished because\ni obviously it leads to your determined\nambitious voice\nbut what other parts of your growth\nuh maybe internally personally do you\nfeel you're unfinished on or working on\ni mean so much i've just about\nyou know i'm in my 30s and this decade\nhas been amazing because\num\ni've just you know found my strengths i\nthink as a woman\nand um what i'm looking forward to going\nforward is i'm very nascent in my career\nin america right now it's just been five\nyears since i've\nstarted working here i just about have\ndone my first\nyou know

because i was building my\nacting career so much so you know\nfounding my own brand\num investing in tech i find that really\nfascinating\num\nmy philanthropy\ni want to be able to set up my\nfoundation really well\num my work with unicef\num i've just about moved into\nour new house um after almost 10 to 15\nyears of living in rentals or hotel\nrooms you know because i always just\nkept moving i was so nomadic um i'm\nlooking forward to you know watching\nthe trees grow in my garden\n[Music]\ni love that watch it watching trees\ngrows great i love that\nthat's brilliant i\nhearing you\nhearing you say that\nuh i love hearing you talk about\nthe\nsouth asian storytelling like obviously\nthat that relates very strongly to me\nand my roots growing up in london as\nwell where i think we have an incredibly\nstrong south asian community where you\nare right now where i was born and\nraised and\ni definitely felt this\nyeah lack of lack of representation lack\nof the ability to lack of opportunity\nlack of opportunity to dream in a\ncertain way and you know my my career\nhas been totally random but\nit's and and you know i'm doing\nsomething today that i would never have\nimagined even knowing it existed see\neven that you and i two south asians\nsitting\nin these boxes\nand talking about the fact that the\ncareers that we are thriving in that we\nhave worked so hard to make was never in\nour minds\nwas never a possibility\nbut i would have never dreamed about it\nbecause it wasn't in my realm of\ndreaming but that's not how it should be\nconsidering the\nwe're one-fifth of the world's popular\nwe're huge we're everywhere okay and i\nthink and it shouldn't be so hard for me\nto you know come into\nan industry and say i want an\nopportunity and for people to be like oh\nwell we're gonna have to create that now\nwon't we\nwe've existed for a really long time\nyou know\nit's the irony of it is so amusing but\nsad at the same time\nyeah no that resonates very strongly\nwith me because i didn't even know any\ncareers existed\nand and when i say this i i don't say it\nlightly i genuinely didn't believe\ncareers existed out\noutside of medicine\nengineering and business like i didn't\nreally know i didn't know that you could\nhave a\nsuccessful career in anything else\nat 17 when i was\nit was a fluke why i got got into the\nmiss india pageant and that kind of kick\nstarted everything for me\nbut\ni wanted to be an engineer because those\nwere the options doctor engineer lawyer\nand you know if you come from an\nacademic family of or failure um if you\ncome from an academic family or you know\nour parents\nour immigrants and our parents like my\nparents even in india were you know\nbuilding their businesses for the first\ntime it wasn't inherited from them so\nthey also were surviving and i think\nit's that survival instinct that sort of\npushed them to put the aspirations that\nthey knew best\nyou know on their kids like this is the\nbest job you'll always make money you\nwill be stable\nyes you know but\nalso the internet sort of changed our um\ni think our generation\nthe the fact that the internet made the\nworld such a small place which is\nanother big reason why we should see so\nmuch more representation is because we\nare catering to the whole world now what\nwas different about your ability to\nbreak out and and i'm not saying and i\nyou know you're not an egotistic person\ni'm not asking you to be autistic i'm\nasking you to share lessons\nwhat was different in that you were able\nto break out and do something that now\nyou're more aligned with who you want to\nbe as the future moves on versus the\npeople that don't make that step what is\nthe difference i think it was abandoning\nany connection to practicality and\nreally living in faith you know it\nreally tested my faith it because the\nreason i was able to do it is because\nand this is with julie's help\nwas because i embraced the fact that it\nwas a spiritual journey fundamentally so\nyes i left being a lawyer and i became\nthis ultra endurance athlete and author\nand podcaster but it wasn't because when\ni was a lawyer i got out my whiteboard\nand created a wish list or you know\nbasically tried to you know create this\nis my dream scenario for my life i just\nstarted engaging in what i felt was more\naligned with my\nunique blueprint\nand with that i would start pulling on\nthe threads that would appear every day\nand i was tested it was very difficult\nwe went through incredible financial\ndismantling like i was tested in every\nregard you can imagine\npeople saying i was crazy all of it\nright\nbut by having faith and trusting\nin that sense of what was right for\nmyself and and learning to\nlisten to and rely on that instinctual\nvoice\ni think taught me a lot about who i am\nand also about resolve and ultimately i\nthink that's why i was able to see it\nthrough so if you look on the internet\nit kind of looks like it all happened\nlike this like overnight i just made\nthis decision and became this other\nthing this is this was like i mean i've\nbeen doing this for you know 15 years at\nthis point and i got sober at 31 it\nreally began\nwhen i went to rehab at age 31 and\nstarted to\nre-configure my life based on spiritual\nprinciples and here i am\n22 23 years later still learning still\ngrowing still making mistakes so it's\nvery much not an overnight thing and\nit's all a spiritual journey and what is\nyour faith in at that time because it's\nalmost like\nmost people when they're in that\ntransition it's like you don't really\nhave faith in yourself or you may not\nhave faith in your skills like is your\nfaith in the belief that doing the right\nthing is the right thing either way or\nis your faith in the fact that you have\nyour wife who's supportive like what is\nthat faith in because i feel like that's\nthe hardest thing for people and i can\nonly speak for myself that i knew that\nmy faith was in the guidance of my\nteachers my faith was in the books that\ni'd read and the philosophy i believed\nin and my faith was in\nthere's a beautiful beautiful verse in a\ntext called the manusmithi which says\nthat if you protect your purpose your\npurpose protects you right and that was\nwhat my faith was in was that statement\nand i was like i'm gonna test that\nstatement to its limits but that\nstatement requires that you understand\nwhat your purpose is correct yes and i\nvery much did not know what that's what\ni'm saying what was your faith in so\nwell first of all i will say that i was\non a i was on a journey to discover what\nthat purpose was\nand i had a fundamental belief that that\ni did have a per that there is or was a\npurpose for me to discover\nand i used\nendurance training as a vehicle for that\nprocess of self-discovery because\nthere's something about\nbeing out on a trail for hours and hours\nand hours around an eight-hour bike ride\nyou're stripped of all artifice and the\nkind of low-grade suffering that you\nexperience\nforces you to confront yourself in a\nvery honest way right and you meet\nyourself in a place that you're not used\nto\nand there's a lack of of artificiality\nand artifice in that place where you can\nbe really honest like you're you're\nyou're wrestling with your soul at the\nmost profound level i think and and\nthat's what attracted me to this world\nand that's what helped me answer all of\nthese questions getting comfortable in\nthat crucible but if i had to say what\nis the philosophy philosophical belief\nthat kind of underpins that i would say\nthat we are here to grow and we are here\nto\non a journey of greater\nself-actualization and the closer we can\napproximate\nthat place of self-actualization the\nbetter position we are in to express\nour unique blueprint and purpose in\nservice to other human beings\nright and for me it's been a process of\ntrying to uncover what that is for me\nand then ultimately bring greater\nexpression to that\nfor the betterment of other people what\ndoes it feel like right now that is for\nyou compared to when you first started\non this path where's the\nevolution of that yeah well it's\ninteresting because for a long time it\nwas like oh you're the vegan ultra\nendurance athlete guy and it's like yeah\ni am and i did those things um but\nthat's just one expression of who i am\nand the podcast you know much like your\nshow has been about trying to continue\nthat growth and to understand that that\ni was able to do those things in the\nendurance world\nbecause i understood that we are all\nsitting on top of gigantic reservoirs of\nhuman potential that remain untapped and\ni was able to tap into that aspect of\nmyself in an athletic context and\nexpress that but there are all these\nother areas of untapped potential in my\nlife and in my friends people that i\nmeet everybody's life right and i wanted\nto\ncontinue that growth curve and that\nlearning process of of tapping into\nthose other areas spiritually mentally\nemotionally intellectually socially\nevery aspect of what it means to be\nas self-actualized as we possibly can\nand what do we do that you've mentioned\nthat a few times now like you know it's\ninteresting that when you achieve\nsomething your identity becomes crafted\naround it so it's almost like you're\nthat healthy vegan dude and you know\nlike you do like and then and i can see\nthat there's a part of you that\nalmost there's a part of you that's like\nbut that's not all of me and and i'm\nmore than that yeah i don't want to be\ndefined by\nsucker how do you process that because i\nthink a lot of people struggle with that\nwhether it's their past failures or\ntheir past successes that start to\ndefine everything about who they attract\nin their life who they spend time with\nwhat opportunities they come their way i\nmean i'll give an example of something\nthat's coming to my mind right now is\nwhen uh when we had kobe bryant on the\nshow\nand kobe started to talk about how like\nand this this was huge for me he was\nsaying basically no one believed that he\ncould make tv or movies\nor media because he was a basketball\nplayer they're like what do you know\nabout this space and so when he was\ntrying to sell these shows no one wanted\nto buy them\nand that's why he had to build his own\nstudio and that's where he was building\nthe studio for dear basketball and he\nwas writing these novels and these books\nthat were then being turned into movies\nand tv shows and podcasts so he even\nsomeone like him was totally being\npigeonholed and defined how do you\nprocess that for yourself and how do you\nhelp other people process anyone who\nfeels limited by their past failures but\nalso limited by their past successes\nwell a couple things yeah first of all\num that identity or whatever it is\nthat's looming out there is just a story\nit's only as powerful\nas as you allow it to be right\nyou always have\ncontrol over that narrative or how\nstrongly you want to be reminded of a\ncertain identity you can always recraft\nthat you only have control over your own\nbehaviors and your own thoughts and your\nown interactions with other human beings\nyou can't control how other people\nperceive you that's none of your\nbusiness so if you're unhappy with the\nstory that's being told about you all\nyou can do is act in contravention of\nthat you can't control how other people\nperceive that but you can control the\nstory you tell yourself about who you\nare so it's about becoming you know you\nyou hear the adage of like be the be the\nmovie star in your own movie of the\nmovie of your life right and understand\nthat at any given moment\nyou that these stories are just they're\ndrawn out of thin air they're they're\nthey're they're not real this is a\nprojection\nthat comes from a collective imagination\nso change the story if you don't like it\nand if you don't like this story that\nother people are telling about you you\ncan mute that and just do your own thing\nso when i didn't you know when i didn't\nwant to be pigeonholed as the vegan you\nknow athlete i just started a podcast\nand started talking about other stuff\nyou know and then seven years later\nthat's still a thing but you know i'm\nknown for other things now yeah people\nwill fall into line you know with with\nthat you know based upon your behavior\nand your actions yeah with your identity\nthe way it is right now what are you\nmost excited to\nnot be known for but\nbe acknowledged for what you're doing\nlike for yourself not from other people\nnot for the external validation but what\nare you most excited about doing for\nyourself just continuing to learn you\nknow i just i want to be a lifelong\nlearner and i think that that growth\ncurve you know always exists and there's\nalways people out there that you can uh\nthat you can take valid information and\ntools from to improve your life\nso i don't spend a lot of time thinking\nabout how i want to be perceived no of\ncourse um but i think that uh and and\npeople ask me like oh what's the what's\nthe vision where do you see yourself in\nfive it's like i don't think about that\nlike i'm so fulfilled in doing what i'm\ndoing right now and the fact that i get\nto\nbe on this personal growth trajectory by\nhaving amazing conversations with\nincredible human beings and then you get\nto share that with other people and it\nimpacts them i mean i don't know about\nyou but i can't think of anything more\num\nyou know more gratifying any any kind of\ncareer trajectory that would be\nmore gratifying than that what's the\nmost interesting thing you learned\nrecently whether it was a skill or a\ntechnique or a fact or a stat or some\nresearch that blew your mind or some\nexperience that just really changed the\nway you were thinking about something\ni'd probably go back to kamal ravikant\nlike him and his simple practices of\nlearning how to love himself like he\nwent he walked me through these\nexperiences where he really hit rock\nbottom emotionally in a very in in a\ncouple different ways throughout his\nlife and how these very basic simple\neasy to apply practices have transformed\nhow he\nsees the world and experiences the world\ni think is really profound because of\nits sheer simplicity and power do you\nthink based on that what you just said\nnow\nhumans only change through pain i get\nthat a lot i mean\npain is pain is is is the best motivator\nfor change obviously and i think the\nbiggest changes that i've made in my\nlife have really been forged through\npain\ni'm stubborn like i don't i'm not going\nto change until you know my whole world\nis falling on top of me and then oh yeah\nokay i guess i need to\nmodify that\nbut it is amazing how human beings are\nwired that way because\nthe possibility of change exists in\nevery moment right and yet we seem\nincapable or or challenged in our\nability to leverage that unless\nwe're being pressured by some external\nforce to do so yeah if someone's\nlistening or watching right now but is\nfeeling like they're a\nsafety\nsecure\nstability motivated individual\nand they're like oh that's just too much\nrisk for me it's like\neven the spiritual faith everything you\nguys are talking about like that's just\nyou know to live in that uncertainty to\nlive with that much faith to to push to\nthat degree what what are your advice\nfor them like what would you say to that\nkind of well i would say that security\nis an illusion i think people that are\nfocused on security have control issues\nthey think that they can control the\nworld outside of themselves and their\nown behavior and i think that is a\na vast illusion that is an epidemic in\nour culture i think in every moment we\nhave this sense of i'm good things are\nstatic like i can just stay in this\nplace and the truth is\nwith every breath with every thought\nthat we entertain with every word that\ncomes out of our mouth we're either\ngrowing as an individual or we are\nregressing that's the truth right and\nthere is no security everything is a\nrisk\nwe're here for a very short period of\ntime\nso my call to action to everybody is\ndon't wait until you find yourself in\nsome existential crisis because you've\nbeen living your life based upon some\nyou know social rule book that doesn't\nfit your own blueprint instead\nembrace\nwhat is uniquely you and have the\ncourage and the fortitude and the faith\nto try to bring expression to that it\nmay be scary and it might contravene\nwhat your parents want for you and it\nmight seem risky but ultimately\ni think the riskiest thing to do is to\nplay it safe and live your life in\naccordance with you know somebody else's\nexpectations of what you should do and\nbe\nhow did you know that you'd found\nsomething about yourself that was\nuniquely you like you've said that a few\ntimes now uniquely you how how do you\nknow when something is uniquely you\nbecause i feel like so many of us are\neither so influenced by everything\nthat's happening or we just\ni feel like we've lost our ability to\ntalk to ourselves and know that that's\nour voice yeah right like it's like\nmost people when you hear a voice they\nhear a voice in their head they don't\nknow if that's them or something else\nand they can't tell the difference so\nwhat are those indicators or signals\nwhere you're like yeah that i'm getting\ncloser\neven if i'm not it's a really good\nquestion\num and i don't have like a simple pithy\nanswer sure\ni think it's i think it's hard you know\ni think you're correct in that\nwe're so distracted\nyou know our phones are always in our\nhands there's always a reason to not be\npresent with ourselves and the more\ndetached we become the more difficult it\nis to\nknow what that internal voice is so i\nthink the process of of\nof trying to understand what is uniquely\nyou know what is unique about jay\ninvolves that looking inward process\nright it's about meditation and\nmindfulness and getting quiet and trying\nto you know spend time uh contemplating\nlike what was it that made you happy as\na kid like what did you like to do\nwhen you were left to your own devices\nthat now you feel like\nyou haven't done in a long time or would\nbe foolish as an adult to spend time\ndoing and maybe there's a lesson there\nfor you to see you know i don't know i\ncan't answer that for you yeah but i\nknow that those answers reside within\nall of us\nand in order to heed them or get clarity\nyou really have to you really have to\nhave the discipline\nto um carve out that kind of quiet time\nsolitude with yourself what's the best\nadvice you've received on solitude on\nthe podcast is there anyone you remember\nthat\nkind of you just felt embodied solitude\nthe best or that kind of quiet or that\nyeah i mean there's been a couple people\nyou know of course you have like\nmeditation masters like sharon salzberg\ni think maybe the most profound though\nin in in the most grounded\nway was you've all know harare basically\ntalking about how like clarity is a\nsuperpower\nand now because we're so distracted\ndistraction is our natural disposition\nto just be clear and quiet to have\npresence of mind to have clarity about\nwhat you think about a particular thing\nis a superpower where that used to just\nbe normal right yeah which kind of makes\nit easier to distinguish yourself\nbecause all you have to do is put the\nphone away learn how to be quiet learn\nhow to connect with your\ninternal voice\nand that makes you much more capable\nthan the person sitting next to you\nwhat was the conversation that surprised\nyou the most was anyone that not blew\nyour mind but just surprised you with a\nbelief that maybe something you held\ntrue\nwhen you spoke to them they they changed\nyour mind on it was there anyone like\nthat that changed your mind on something\nthat you thought was\nvery concrete in your life or i'm always\nfascinated by our beliefs and how they\ncan shift like i've always considered\nmyself to be someone who it's like i\nfelt like when i was spiritually\nimmature i felt like i had my beliefs\nand they were the answers and then\nnothing else was true yeah what i\nbelieved was true and anyone else's\nanswers were completely false right and\nthen as i started to grow more you start\nto realize you know nothing\nand you're like okay i don't know\nanything now because i'm not really sure\nabout any of these beliefs and then you\nget to a point where it's like well i\nhave some values and beliefs they work\nfor me and now i'm willing to trade and\nupgrade\nbased on what i'm exposed to because now\ni learned that i need to have a map or a\nguidebook or a rulebook that works\nbecause you need that for life yeah but\nthen i hear someone say something and\ni'm like\nah like\nthat has just opened up my mind in a\ncompletely different way i think um\nin addition to that what happens when\nyou're confronted with a truth that\ncontravenes your\nyour world view\nthe first thing that it does is it\npushes that cognitive bias button and\nyou're like\nthat can't be right because this is the\nway i see the world right so you feel\nthe resistance coming up so for you to\nsay oh wow i didn't think of it that way\nand to embrace that difference of\nopinion or perspective i think is the\nhealthiest thing to do so for me it's\nless about oh here's an example and more\nabout\ntrying to be in that place of of empathy\nand compassion and openness and to\nnotice when i feel like my resistance\ncreeping up whether it's somebody who\nhas a different you know nutritional or\ndietary perspective than i do or\nsomebody who uh\nyou know\nwas able to get sober and maintain their\nsobriety you know by way of a protocol\nthat is at odds with like how i think it\nshould be done you know what i mean yeah\nand to just be like the world's a big\nplace the human condition is is\nmulti-varied like i don't have all the\nanswers and to be able to sit with\nsomebody who's coming from a different\nperspective and try to find mutual\nground and meet them where they're at\nwith compassion and with empathy i think\nis\nreally powerful\nit's something that i'm always\nendeavoring to do with whatever guess\nthat i have on my show\nand i think it's what's sorely lacking\nin our culture right now and i think if\nthere's anything that i'm trying to do\nwith my show and the example that i set\nwith how i conduct my conversations is\nto say\nlook if we want to move forward as a\nhealthy culture as a healthy society we\nhave to be able to meet each other\nin our differences with compassion with\nunderstanding that doesn't mean that we\ndo it with unhealthy boundaries but we\nhave to be able to have mature\nconversations about our differences\nbecause this polarization and the\nseparation that we're seeing and the\nunhealthy siloing of opinions i think is\nreally\npolluting and denigrating our ability to\nmove forward as a as a healthy society\nand is deeply concerning to me yeah i'm\nso with you on that i think that's\nthat's a great answer because\nyeah that that lack of judgment\nand openness and just stopping yourself\nfrom like you said letting your\nyour controls creep in\nthat's probably the hardest thing right\nbecause you've been on a train of\nthought or a school of thought since you\nwere a kid and it's built and built and\nbuilt and it's got you to somewhere\nwhich is probably okay\nand then all of a sudden come someone\ncomes and just surprises you with the no\nwhat's been the best way you've found\napart from having conversation on the\npodcast have you found that people are\nable to create their openness in their\nown lives is it more travel is it\nwatching things that you wouldn't watch\nlike what have you seen that like how\ncan we encourage that more\nfor people to be okay with exposing\nthemselves to opposing ideas without\nplacing judgment on them\nyeah it's tough i mean i think travel is\na big one right investing in experience\num people who have who have you know\ndone that tend to have broader views and\nperspectives and and more open-minded\nare more open-minded about a variety of\nissues than people just stay in one\nplace and have their news feed yeah and\neven who they follow on their newsfeed\nbecause\nthat again if it's diverse you you're\nagain\nmeeting diverse people there too right\nyeah\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love go in there go\ninto the suffering go into the pain of\nyour life and say why did this suck for\nme so bad\nwhy am i afraid of all this stuff the\nonly way you're going to fix yourself is\nto go all the way back"
