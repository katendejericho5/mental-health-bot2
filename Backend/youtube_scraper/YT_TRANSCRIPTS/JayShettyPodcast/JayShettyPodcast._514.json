    "transcript": "there's many many ways in which these\nemotions show up\nand one of the things that psychologists\ntalk about is this phenomenon that they\ncall disenfranchised grief which\nbasically means that there's a thousand\nand one versions of these griefs and\nthese separations that are not\nsocially acceptable to mourn\nand so we don't warn them we don't even\nname them to ourselves\nas something that requires mourning\nbecause we don't think of them that way\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each

please\nwelcome to the show susan k and susan\nthank you so much for being here uh\nreally grateful really excited to learn\nfrom you today and these are actually my\nfavorite conversations on the podcast\nsitting with someone who has studied and\ndeeply\nabsorbed a theme a transition of life\nthat is often uh not spoken about enough\nso thank you so much well thank you so\nmuch jay for being here it's it's just\nsuch a joy i've been a fan for a long\ntime\nwell the feeling is very mutual let's\nlet's dive right in because\ni think\nyou know the work that you've done up\nuntil now on on being an introvert and\nbeing quiet and stillness is is really\npowerful but this new book bittersweet\nwhat i find really interesting about\nthis is\ni find that as humans and i'm speaking\non my behalf and i think a lot of my\ncommunity feels this way as well is that\nwe've never been taught\nabout what to do with pain\nuh we've never really been taught about\nwhat to do with the feeling of loss or\nsorrow\nwe don't really know what to do with it\nand the\ngeneric advice we get with is well it\nwill heal with time\nor it will go away naturally\nand and i wanted to ask you like\nwhere\ndid you start on this journey of\nfiguring out what to do with pain\nand when you started that journey\nwhat surprised you the most\ni had had experiences in my own life and\nthe generations in my family before i\neven entered into this world had had\nexperiences in their lives that i think\num kind of set me up to be\nthinking about these kinds of questions\nthis particular journey really started\nfor me when\ni noticed that i was\ndr i mean i love music of all kinds i\nlove\nhappy upbeat dance music but\ni found myself drawn especially to\nminor key kind of longing yearning music\nand i started to notice that that music\nhad this effect on me that wasn't about\nsadness the only word i could use is\nlove actually i mean look the music\nwould give me a sense of uplift and i\nrealized that the uplift came from love\nand it was because\nthe\nmusician\ncomposing music like that they are\nexpressing the pain that all humans\nexperience at one time or another and\nthey're basically saying we all feel\nthis some of the time\nand\ni'm letting you know that i i'm the\nmusician who felt that way everybody\nelse listening to to this has felt this\nway and um and the music is then going\nto take this extra step of turning the\npain into something beautiful which i\nthink is is kind of the call that we all\nhave in this world\nand um and so anyway it was really\ntrying to understand like what that\nmusic was all about\nthat got me started on this inquiry of\nwhat bitter sweetness is and i started\nlooking at all these different\ntraditions from all over the world and\nacross time\nand they're all telling us that the\nwillingness to accept the fact that life\nis a mix of joy and sorrow\nis one of the great bonding agents we\nhave because we all are humans who are\nin that same state of being\nso it's a great bonding agent and it's\nthe source of our creativity and it's\nthe source of transcendence\num but it all started it all started\nwith music and it probably started\nbefore that you know with various family\nexperiences that had primed me to be\nthinking in these ways and do you\nbelieve that it's our avoidance of\nthat\nidea that life is both bittersweet\nand that life is both joy and sorrow is\nit the avoidance that causes us more\npain or causes us more stress and\npressure and and is that why we need\nacceptance is acceptance the right word\nhow are you constructing that thought\nprocess for us\ni would say acceptance is the first step\nwe we do have to accept and acceptance\nby the way looks like many different\nthings you know it doesn't only look\nlike kind of sitting calmly and letting\nthings wash over us it's also\num understanding that some of the time\nwe're gonna feel overwhelmed or angry or\nwhatever it is in response to\nan aversive event um and being okay with\nall of those kind of chaotic emotions\nthat come up but all of that that's only\nstep one um there's a guy named steven\nhayes who's developed this thing called\nacceptance and commitment therapy and it\nbreaks down this process acceptance is\nstage one commitment is stage two what\ncommitment looks like is\nit's identifying\nthe source of your pain\nand realizing that the only reason you\nfeel pain in the first place is because\nsomething has happened in an area that\nmatters to you\nso to use it as a kind of signpost of\nthis is what matters to me you know\nmaybe you've just had a breakup um or a\nbereavement or whatever it is and you\nrealize wow like this this thing that\ni've lost this matters so now you want\nto like\ncommit yourself to that area of life\nbecause now you know how how much it\nmatters\nand we see people doing this in\ndifferent ways all the time they're just\nnot always aware of it just as examples\nafter 9 11\nsuddenly in the united states there was\na huge rush of people signing up to\nbecome firefighters and in the wake of\nthe pandemic there's a rush of people\nsigning up for medical school and for\nnursing school\nand you could say both of these\ndecisions they're they're kind of\ncounterintuitive it's kind of like\npeople are signing up to be\nyou know closer to the source of the\nthing that has brought us pain um but\nwhat humans want to do ultimately is\nhumans want to create meaning\nso like\nif we can accept but then also take that\nextra step of making meaning out of\nout of the thing that has caused us pain\nor making a kind of human connection out\nof it that's really what brings us\ncloser to wholeness ah that's such a\nbeautiful answer and and i love hearing\nthat from you especially because you've\nspent\nso much time in this space of it's\nalmost like acceptance with meaning that\nturns into action like some sort of as\nyou said the examples of uh the\nfirefighters and and the healthcare\nworkers of people opting to take action\nbecause of some meaning that they've\ngained\ni\ni think often we're scared of\ntransforming sorrow or loss or pain into\nacceptance or meaning\nbecause it means we have to spend more\ntime with it\nright like it's when you open up the\nwound you have to spend more time with\nthe wound\nand so it's often easier how do we\nis it courage that's needed\nto look at a painful area and i love\nwhat you said about\nultimately if something caused you pain\nit's because it matters to you\n[Music]\nwhat is required to take a closer look\nat what matters to you that's caused you\npain is it courage is it curiosity like\nwhat is that what have you seen that\ngives people the\nresilience required or is it resilience\nthat's required to actually assess that\ni mean i suppose it's all those things\nbut i think one of the\none of the biggest factors that we\noverlook all the time\nis connection there's no pain that\nexists that many other people haven't\nbeen through or or that people who have\nbeen through it could still gather\naround together\nbut you know there's a reason for\nexample like with alcoholics anonymous\nlike what do you do people gather around\ntogether to lift each other up they\ndon't do it by themselves um or i think\nof\nif someone who i talked about um\nor who i quoted really in bittersweet\nshe was describing the funeral of her\ngrandfather and she was describing how\nshe had never before seen her father cry\nit was her father's father who had\npassed away\nand she said you know it was incredibly\nsad and a group of friends gathered\ntogether and they they were like a\nbarbershop chorus and they sang this\nbeautiful tribute in honor of her\ngrandfather and the tears were streaming\ndown her father's face and she says\nwhat she remembers of that moment most\nwas actually not the pain it was what\nshe calls the union between souls\nthat happened at that moment\nand\nthere is something\nabout\nthese painful moments that can open us\nup\nto that union between souls and i think\nwe need to look for that everywhere we\ncan\nand you see it everywhere around you\nonce you're\nonce you become aware of it um\nthis is one of the reasons that i think\nit's such a problem that in our culture\nwe don't like to talk about stuff like\nthis we see it as\nkind of distasteful or maybe a little\nbit weak or something like that um\nbut god knows we need more of a union\nbetween souls right now we have nothing\nbut division this is actually one of the\nthings that most opens us up and most\njoins us yeah that's such a great\nreminder and\nyou're so right that we\ni feel a lot of us including myself at\ntimes in my life\ni've had the feeling that\nno one understands me and only i'm going\nthrough this\nlike only i'm struggling and i think\ntoday\nif we take a look at it through the\nangle of social media or\nthe idea of yeah anything from instagram\nthrough to tick tock through to facebook\nor whatever it may be and people are\nlooking at that going well my life\ndoesn't look like that my life's a lot\nworse than that\nand that comparison or that judgment\nconstantly makes us feel like we're more\nalone\nin our experience of pain\nhow do is that unhealthy to feel that\nour pain is unique or is it useful to\nfeel that your pain is unique to you i'm\nfascinated by the uniqueness of of pain\nespecially when you're talking about the\nidea that actually pain is what connects\nus and and but often our experience of\npain is well no no my pain's different\nor\nsometimes it's my pains worse than yours\nor\nsometimes people gain perspective by\nthinking well someone else has it worse\noff and so i'm intrigued by\nis pain healthier to see it when you see\nit as unique or when you see it as\nconnecting oh that's interesting i mean\nso i would always say every single\nperson's life story is unique and and of\ncourse there are some pains that are\nmore difficult than other peens for sure\nbut yeah at the end of the day\nunderstanding the\nconnection\nis\nthe most healing of all it really is um\nthere's there's a a japanese buddhist\npoet who i i talk about in bittersweet\nhis name is issa i issa he's one of the\ngreat um famous poets of japan\nand he had this life experience where he\nkept\nhe married late and he and his wife kept\ngiving birth to children who didn't live\num they would die like stillbirths and\nthen and then finally they had this\ndaughter sado\nand she was healthy and beautiful and\nbeloved\nand then she too like the age of two or\nthree she dies of smallpox and he's\nutterly heartbroken and he's also\ntrained as a buddhist monk and so he's\ntrained like in the idea of impermanence\nyou know in the idea of accepting\nimpermanence and so he writes this poem\nafter his baby's death he writes this\npoem or he's basically saying i i get\nthis world of dew is just a world of dew\nyou know meaning it's just dew drops i\nget it everything's impermanent and then\nhe says\nbut even so\nbut even so\nand he's basically saying you know like\neven i who's trained in impermanence\neven i am going to say\nthis hurts you know for for my baby\ndaughter to have\ndied this way this really hurts\nand you have to ask like well why are we\nwhy first of all why did he write that\npoem and second why are we reading it\n200 years later\nand the answer is that\nhe wrote it because he knows that\neverybody\nhas trouble with that idea of\nimpermanence no one fully accepts it\neverybody grieves\nand we read it 200 years later because\nour lives are completely different from\nhis and yet they're exactly the same we\nwould grieve too in in the exact same\nsituation and 200 years later we'll\nstill read it\nand\nthat's\none of the great sources of uplift\nthat we have\num it's one of the great truths you know\nthat we're we're all in this\nkind of like amazing state of like\nconstant\nlove and loss that go together as humans\nthat is that that's our situation and\nwe're in that together and there's\nsomething incredibly beautiful about\nthat that's why we listen to music it's\nlike one reason one big reason we listen\none big reason we consume art is because\nwe're kind of allowing our artists and\nmusicians and theologians and everyone\nelse to tell us\nthese truths on behalf of all of us and\njoin us together that way yeah that that\ntruly is i'm really glad i asked you\nthat question because\nuh hearing you deepen that understanding\nfor us around\nwhat we're looking for in that\nconnection and transitioning to music\ni i realized that a few years ago when\nyou know you're traveling all across the\nworld and i know you do too and you're\nspeaking or you're doing events or\nyou're meeting people\nand you realize that everyone's playing\nthe same music in every single country\noften and i know every country has its\nown traditional\nmusic as well of course which is\nbeautiful but i also find that often you\nfind that music just you know crosses\nlanguage crosses boundaries crosses\nbarriers\nbut i think one of the interesting that\nyou that you bring up is that normally\npeople would think that\nwe listen to happy music to feel happy\nand sad music when we're sad\nbut you talk about how\nsad music can transform into something\nbeautiful that can uplift someone and\nbring them closer to a feeling of joy\nwalk us through that\nconcept\nyeah i mean so we know this that um like\nthe music that reliably gives people you\nknow shivers and chills and goosebumps\nit's this it's the sad music it's the\nsad slow music um and people will tell\nresearchers that when they listen to sad\nmusic they feel like connected to states\nof wonder and awe\nand transcendence um\nand you know sad music is incredibly\nuplifting it lifts the mood it lifts the\nspirits um i'm sorry i meant happy music\ni'm not sure what i just said but anyway\nbut it's the sad music that makes us\nfeel like you know we're we're touching\ntouching something higher\nand i think this is because\nas humans we all enter this world it's\nlike part of our emotional dna\nto feel that we\nbelong\nin another more perfect and more\nbeautiful state um\nyou know whether you use religious terms\nto express that of like that we belong\nwith with the divine or um we belong in\nthe garden of eden or in zion or in\nmecca or whatever it is there's this\nfeeling of we belong somewhere else and\num you know the wizard of oz we belong\nsomewhere over the rainbow that's just\nthat's a state that human beings\nfeel on a fundamental level\nsad music minor key music puts us in\ntouch with this state so instead of\nmaking us feel sad\nit's making us feel\nconnected with the more perfect and\nbeautiful world to which we feel we\nbelong\num and you know you're talking about\ndifferent cultures you you can see this\nand music all across the world you know\nthere's like like in in\nportugal and brazil well portugal is the\nmusic of fodo and um portugal and brazil\nthey both have the idea of soda you know\nthe idea of like the longing for\nlike a lost love that you may never have\nexperienced in the first place and this\nis embodied in the music\num and as i understand it um in hinduism\nthere's an idea of viraja which is the\nsame idea kind of like longing for\na lost love and and the idea there is\nthat music the legend has it that music\nand poetry like began\nwith that sense of loss and there's like\na\na tale of a bird that is weeping because\nits lover was killed by a hunter's bow\nand\nand that moment of the birds weeping is\nsaid to be the the start of all\nof all art and poetry so there's\nsomething very deep in us\nthat feels these things um\nbut is uplifted by them because we're\ntogether in that state of exile and\nwe're together in that state of longing\nfor a better world that we're always\nreaching for yeah what is that's so\ninteresting and i i agree with you and\nand you're spot on that especially in\nthe bhakti tradition\nuh there's a statement similar to varaha\nit's called vipra lumber above which\nmeans\nservice in separation or love in\nseparation\nand love and separation or longing is\nseen as higher than love in connection\nbecause there's a deeper longing there's\na deeper sense of connection and\nintimacy that is experienced in\nwanting to be reunited with a loved one\nwhether that be the divine in certain\ntraditions or whether that be a person\nbut\nwhat i find really interesting is how\nsome of these concepts can be so easily\nmisconstrued or swayed like the idea\nthat\ni think a lot of people would feel\nthat\nlonging for a better life\nactually causes a lot of pain as opposed\nto the idea that you're really putting\nforward is longing of knowing that there\nis more and i'm just trying to really\nget into that subtlety of like longing\nfor a better life actually causes us\nmore pain and stress sometimes\nwhereas what i think you're saying and\ni'd love to clarify that more deeply is\nlonging knowing that there is more there\nis meaning there is purpose to this\nexperience could you does that help is\nthat and i'm really allowing my mind to\nlike connect random dots right now i'm\nnot following my my notes or my\nquestions at all because i i just feel\nlike there's so much depth here to\nuncover i hope you don't mind me doing\nthat by the way susan i apologize are\nyou kidding oh my gosh i love that no no\nno um\ni think it's a spot-on question and i\nthink that what you might be getting at\nis the difference between longing for\nyou know material things or that kind of\nthing versus\na kind of more existential longing for\nyou know that which is beautiful\ngood\ntrue um longing for like\nperfect love longing for the divine\nthose are very different kinds of\nlongings for you know like i'm longing\nfor a nicer car\nthat maybe we're using the same word to\ndescribe\ntwo very different states of being\nyeah no no that that clarifies it i\nthink that's a great\ngreat thought that affects that and for\nme\ni think\nwhat i love about what you're saying in\nthis\nin this book is that\nyou know artists and musicians most of\nthe time get their inspiration from\nsadness\ndarker emotions and\nexperiences and it's often a really\npainful\ntraumatic\ntransition in their life that creates\ntheir greatest art form you gave the\nexample of the bird just a few moments\nago\nand do you think that the opportunity to\ntransform pain into something creative\nlike music or art or poetry\nis possible for everyone\nor is the right way for everyone when a\nlot of people would say well i'm not\npoetic or i'm not artistic or i'm not\ncreative\nis that still what you've found and\ndiscovered to be a really healthy form\nof healing\noh yeah absolutely i'm so glad that you\nasked that question because i use it\nwhen i talk about this and i do say you\nknow whatever pain you can't get rid of\nmake that your creative offering um but\ni'm using that word creative in in a\nvery loose sense\nlike it doesn't have to be you know the\nthe painting hanging on the wall it\ncould be like the the cake you bake or\nthe organization you found or you know\nthe time you reach out to the friend who\nreally needed to hear the thing that you\njust said at that exact moment you know\nthere's a lot of different kinds of\ncreative acts\nthe real creativity is the\ntransformation\nof\nof pain into beauty\nand\nbeauty can take endless different forms\nin the book i talk about a lot of\ndifferent people who do things like this\nyou know like the mother who's whose\nchild is killed by a drunk person on a\nhighway and starts mothers against drunk\ndriving you know there's a thousand\nexamples like this though i was\nhesitating as you could see even to give\nthat example because i i also wouldn't\nwant people to feel like well it\nnecessitates you know starting some\ngigantic famous organization it doesn't\ntake anything like that it just takes\nsome kind of act\nit could be an act of extremely modest\nand private transformation but i think\nthe transformation is the key yeah i i\nlove that as a solution i i think what i\nnotice in my work is that often\nfor people to get started\neven when things are\nsomewhat more stable starting is so\ndifficult\nand the idea of starting anything when\nyou're in\ntrauma or pain\nand you are right that when you look at\nsome of even the greatest careers of\nmusicians or actors often\nwhat they create\nis to\nheal their trauma but they don't\nnecessarily heal their trauma in that\njourney what do you think is the\ndifference there's two questions here\nlet's start first like i'm i'm really\ngetting excited about this topic uh\nlet's start first with how does someone\nstart\nsimply when they're in so much pain\nthey've gone through a really tough\ndifficult situation they're not buddhist\nmonk trained they're not\nexposed to feeling that they naturally\ncreative in what the world considers to\nbe creative i agree with you this could\nbe a business it could be a\nit could be a painting it could be a\nroom in your home that you redesign like\nit doesn't need to be\nan entity or a huge charity but how does\nsomeone just start when they're actually\nlike how do how can i start i'm just so\nstuck in my pain well i mean the first\nplace to start remember at the beginning\nwe were talking about before there's\ncommitment to the thing that you value\nfirst there's acceptance and um\nan acceptance includes\nkind of like sitting with a wash of pain\nso it may be that you're not really\nready to do any kind of like grand act\nor modest act of transformation for\nquite a long time\nand and that's okay you know when to\naccept\nthat also\nto the extent you start to feel\nlike open and ready to it\nconnection really is the key you know\nand maybe it's one other person who\nyou're connecting with and maybe it's a\nperson you don't ever meet in real life\nand it's just somebody you're you're\nconnecting with over the internet you\nknow i\nhear i'm like coming from my introverts\nbackground of knowing that people have\nvery different\nwishes and how they want to connect and\nyou should be honoring your own wishes\nyou know some people will want to be in\na room full of\nof friends or strangers and some people\nreally don't want that and all that's\nfine but i do think that connection of\none kind or another is always going to\nbe the key it's what it's what humans\nwant most of all i'm just thinking of\nsomebody who i am who i talk to a lot uh\nfor the book and i wrote about her this\nis my\na good friend of mine her name is lois\nshe's my sister's mother-in-law and um\nand she\nshe lost her daughter wendy um to\novarian cancer\num\nand they were like incredibly close and\nand lois is an incredibly upbeat\ncheerful person by nature\nshe's not a bittersweet type at all um\nbut you know she kind of went into\na time of really dark despair\nand it was something like two years you\nknow that she was like in her house and\nhardly coming out and um\nshe said just kind of like creating a\nshrine to her lost daughter all over the\nhouse she said like she was hanging\npictures of her like up at all these\ncrazy angles all over the house like she\ndidn't even have the wherewithal to hang\nthem straight or in any way that made\nsense um\nshe was really in an altered reality\nand\nwhat started to bring her out was\nrealizing that\nshe still loved her husband deeply um\nloves her other children deeply her\ngrandchildren deeply and\nfeeling that the message that she was\nsending to them was that maybe they\nshouldn't be\nmoving forward with their lives or maybe\nthey didn't matter so much because she\nwas so lost in the love for her one\ndaughter\nand it was\nthat that was one of the things that\nmost pulled her out and it doesn't mean\nthat her grief has gone away at all\num\nbut\nthere's this incredible way of putting\nit that comes from uh the writer nora\nmcinerney the difference between\nmoving on versus moving forward you know\nthe message we get in this culture is\nyou know eventually you should move on\nlike get over it that's that's the\nmessage we're getting one way or another\nand instead we can move forward which\nmeans\nyou do go on with your life\nbut you're carrying the lost person with\nyou always you don't ever have to leave\nthem behind\nthey they have shaped you they will\nshape you forever they will always be a\npart of you you're carrying them with\nyou even as you move forward\nand i think that's a much\nhealthier and more manageable way\nfor people to deal with their loss\nbeloveds and and with all of that i i\nthink connection is at the heart\nof all of these ideas were there any\nspecific examples you saw of how people\ncarry someone with them long term\nin a way that becomes\nhealthier and healthier for them as\nopposed to more and more debilitating\nfor them were there what were some of\nthose examples i'm intrigued as to\nhow someone who's had a really like you\nsaid like you're talking about people\nwho've lost you know children or people\nhave lost partners or of course parents\nlike\nwhat was the healthiest way or methods\nthat you saw people keep people in their\nlives\nuh without it impacting\ntheir current relationships and their\ncurrent outlook as well well with lois\nwho i just told you about who who lost\nher daughter\num\nshe often talks about how she really\nwants to still be talking about her\ndaughter all the time and you know she\nsaid people around her would very\nunderstandably often like not talk about\nher daughter because they were afraid to\nlike remind her and upset her but of\ncourse you know someone in that\nsituation doesn't need any reminding\nthey haven't forgotten anyway um but but\nmuch more to the point than that\nthey want the person still to be\npart of their lives so they want them to\nthey want to be able to talk about them\nin everyday life\nand just bring bring up their name\nnaturally\num now i'm not saying every single\nperson feels that way and if like if you\nknow someone like this in your life it's\nprobably a good idea to ask them what\ntheir preference is\nbut\nbut i do think many people feel that way\num\nand then another example\nis from norah mckinnerny who who has\nthis idea of moving on versus moving\nforward and her situation was that she\nhad lost her husband when she was still\nquite young\nand\nand she did end up remarrying\nbut she says that the marriage she has\nnow\nand the relationship she has now with\nher new husband\nis the way it is because of her lost\nhusband you know she is the person who\nshe is and she is the wife and partner\nthat she is because of the experiences\nthat she had with her lost husband and\nso he's still present with them and a\npart of her and\nand and it's all integrated it's not\nlike there doesn't have to be this stark\ndelineation you know between\nthat which was and that which is it's\nmore like\nit's all one continuous flow\nhow do we need to adapt as a society do\nyou think to allow for this kind of\nhealing this kind of life because as you\nsaid\nmost often we don't want to talk about\nit if someone does talk about someone\nthey've lost in their life it can be\nquite unsettling and uncomfortable\na because i think\npeople are not used to talking about\nthese themes as we discussed previously\nbut also because\npeople are scared of saying the right\nthing or the wrong thing and they'd\nrather not and then ultimately it's\nabout well\nyou know when is it right to talk about\nit i think there's a lot of\naspects of this that make it complicated\nwhat are you seeing a good progress did\nyou even come across any communities or\nany\ntribes or societies or places in the\nworld or people that you found were\nhaving healthier conversations around\nloss do those even exist yeah there's\nactually and i i don't know if i'll be\nable to give you um you know names at my\nfingertips but it's actually fascinating\nthere i would say there's a movement now\nthat has sprung up to talk more about\ndeath and grief and loss and all of it\nit's a broader movement with many\ndifferent subgroups to it i think we\nkind of reached a tipping point it was\nlike in the early um\nit was around the early 20th century\nthat we started\nmoving loss\nand death and all of it you know\ncompletely off stage it was like seen as\nbeing completely non-appropriate don't\ntalk about it ever\nthis was a period where it also became\nlike out of fashion even to talk about\nbad weather like you weren't supposed to\nnotice anything negative at all um\nand i think there's a reclamation\nprocess that's going on right now with\npeople realizing\nwe will actually\nbe more whole if we can integrate all of\nthis into our daily lives it's not about\na love of the macabre or the moribiter\nit's nothing like that it's just like\ntell the truth about\nbeing alive like integrate it all um\nand so yeah the these movements are\nspringing up and um\nand then i think you see it in other\nways too you know like i don't know the\nlast 10 or 20 years it's become it's\nbecome increasingly common to talk about\nthings like compassionate leadership\nand what does compassion mean we\nwe think\nit means yeah be nice\nthe word compassion it literally means\nto suffer with someone\nthat's what it means\nand\nso this movement for compassion is\nreally talking about making a place for\npeople to be able to bring their joys\nand their pains and for other people to\nand colleagues to be there with them um\nand of course it's uncomfortable and\nmessy and no one has the answer yet of\nexactly like how to do business with all\nour lives and all our emotions out there\ntoo um it's complicated but i do think\nwe're starting to wrestle with it yeah\nyeah absolutely and and i think that\nat least being able to have honest\ntransparent non-judgmental spaces seems\nto be a good beginning point\nand i think that that requires a lot of\nopenness because\noften there's a judgment on how we want\nto be treated\nabout our loss\nand then there's a judgment from the\npeople on the outside of how you should\nbe reacting to your loss\nand so\nthere's this mishmash of\nexpectation based on judgment which\nseems really uncomfortable like if\nyou've just gone through a loss but then\nyou're expecting that people should deal\nwith you a certain way that's really\ntough because chances are most people\nare not equipped with the tools to know\nhow to interact with you but then those\npeople are also expecting you to get\nover it as you said or\nmove on instead of move forward and so i\nfind that there's often this yeah this\nthis tension\nbetween these\nuh two sets of expectations that ends up\ncausing a bit more stress so\nit really requires a lot of openness and\njudgment a non-judgment from everyone\none of the most moving moments i've ever\nseen\nat a conference\ncame when the organizer of the\nconference asked everybody to\nwrite down on a piece of paper just\nsomething that they had been through\nrecently or were going through you know\nsome like life trial\nand\npeople wrote these things on their\npieces of paper and put them in a hat\nand they all went up to the\nfront of the room and\nand then the organizer sat and\non the stage and he just started pulling\nthese pieces of paper out of the hat and\nreading them aloud and it was so\nprofound because it was like you know\none person was going through like\na terrible divorce and another was\ndealing with an illness and you know\nit's just like one thing after another\nand you realize\nif you had looked around at these people\nall of them cheerfully milling around\nthe conference and you know like happily\nshaking each other's hands\nyou'd have no idea of what their true\nstories are because we don't present\nthat particular face to the world that's\nnot what we do\nand so just the moment of being reminded\nof all our complexities that\nare existing behind our smiling faces\nthat was very profound and i think\nthere's probably a lot of different ways\nthat we could do that you know\nlike at in schools they sometimes have\nwhat's called a parking lot of like a\nwhite board where the kids could write\ndown what they're experiencing or\nfeeling or thinking or whatever and they\ndon't have to put their names you look\nat the whiteboard and you suddenly see\nlike a picture of the emotional\nand experiential state of of the class\nand i think we could be looking for more\nand more ways to do that with each other\nso that\nso that even if we're not so skilled yet\nat\ndealing one-on-one with how do i\nyou know how do i talk to you about what\nyou personally are experiencing\ncollectively we can unders we can see\neach other a little more clearly yeah\ndid you find a difference in approach\nsusan to\npeople who lost someone to death are you\npassing away etc or\nlosing someone who is still alive who\nmay even still be in your life to some\ndegree who who maybe maybe they're\ngeographically distant but\nthey're still present they still have\ntheir own life you may be aware through\nfriends or through social media\nwhat was the\nwas there a difference in approach to\ndealing with those two types of loss did\nyou see different\nways of\nemotionally regulating or reacting to\nthe different types of loss i think what\nwe've been talking about now especially\nthe examples you've shared have been\nvery much\nyou know losing a child or losing in\nthat sense but what about like losing a\npartner or losing a long-term friend or\nsomeone in that capacity yeah and it's\nfunny actually or not funny but that we\nwent in the direction of bereavement\nbecause um i mean i talk about\nbereavement in the book but that's not\nreally the focus the focus is much more\non just like\nin general the fact of\nof uh you know this human condition of\nthere being a pain of separation and a\ndesire for a union that that animates us\nin so many ways um so yeah to your\nquestion\nof course it depends on each individual\ncircumstance but\nbut people do go through quite profound\nlosses and separations there's many many\nmany many ways in which these emotions\nshow up\nand one of the things that psychologists\ntalk about is this phenomenon that they\ncall\ndisenfranchised grief which basically\nmeans that there's there's like a\nthousand and one versions of these\nthese griefs and these separations\nthat are not\nsocially acceptable to mourn\nand so we don't mourn them we don't even\nname them to ourselves as something that\nrequires mourning\nbecause we don't think of them that way\nyou know if you broke up with somebody\nyeah everybody knows that you know you\nmight\nhave a few tissue boxes out for for a\nfew days or something but nobody thinks\nof it as a subject of mourning um\nand other people aren't primed to react\nthat way you know your colleagues aren't\nprimed\nto support you in the way that they\nwould if you were having a classic\nbereavement so i think the real\ndifference has to do much more with\nour expectations for ourselves and what\nwe expect of each other\num in terms of how we process all this\nyeah i think as i'm talking to you and\ni'm listening and thinking about some of\nthe areas i saw in the book what i'm\nalways fascinated by is the balance of\nhow do we encourage people\nand ourselves\nto talk about our pain to discuss it as\nwe're encouraging here\nand to be more transparent about it\nwhat is the balance that allows you to\nuse that to then turn it into something\ncreative or action-based or meaning or\nmoving on\nand it becomes like a form of\nself-expression and when does it\nactually\nlimit you because i i think we\nexperience both right like so you see\npeople\nbuild empires\nout of their pain and no one knows\nthey're going through anything\nso so they can build something really\nphenomenal coming from a place of lack\nduring their childhood or their pain or\nwhatever it may be and no one even knows\nand no one's unaware and we've seen that\nplay out in unhealthy ways\nbut you also see the opposite where or\nyou see two other ways where\nsomeone is\nexpressing their pain but they're\nconstantly in their pain they don't they\ncan't find a way out of the cycle\nwhat is the balance between expressing\naccepting finding meaning and\ndiscussing your pain on a daily basis\nversus being able to transform it as\nyou're encouraging into being like what\nhave you seen as that difference maker\nbecause\ni think we are encouraging people to\nshare more and that's massively needed\nbut i guess what is that\nwhat creates momentum towards\na shift and like you're saying there's\nthis tyranny of positivity right it's\nnot about just well we should just be\npositive or you should look at the\nbright side like that's that we know\nthat that's out of date and that should\nnot be\namplified across the world but\nwhat is the balance i think it's a\ncommon concern it's like well if we let\nthis in maybe it'll take up all the\noxygen you know maybe there won't be\nspace for anything else maybe maybe i'll\nkind of like never come out of it again\nand\ni guess that's where i think that the\nthe bittersweet view of life is so\nhelpful because\nit's a bittersweet view of life is\nsaying life will include pain life will\ninclude sorrow but\nit also will always include joy and\nbeauty and so the\nyou know the job is to like never\nforsake\none for the other you know so if if\nthings happen to be going amazingly for\nyou\ndon't forsake the\nthe fact of the tragedies in the world\nthat exist now and may one day exist for\nyou but by the same token if things\naren't going well\ndon't forsake the miracle of this world\ndon't forsake that either and i think\nthat\nthat's really useful and i'll tell you\nthis one\nparable that i came across\nthat i found so helpful for framing all\nthis\nthis one comes from the the kabbalah\nwhich is the mystical side of judaism\nand\nand the parable is that all of\ncreation was originally an intact\nand divine vessel\nthat then shattered\nand that the world that we're living in\nnow is the world after the breakage\nso it's a broken world\nbut it's also a world in which scattered\nall around us are the shards of light\nfrom this vessel\nand the job for all of us\nis to bend down and pick them up and\nlike and you're gonna notice different\nshards of light from the ones that i\nbut we each have the capacity you know\nto be aware of the breakage and to turn\nin the in the direction of beauty like\nthose those two things\nalways can and must coexist\num\nyou know and and the idea of this\nparable is is to kind of\nlike bring bring more of the divinity\ninto into this kind of lower realm in\nwhich we live\num and you know whether one takes that\nin literal religious terms or as a\nmetaphor i think makes no difference in\nterms of its\nhow helpful it can be and how to live\nyeah and that that is the hardest part i\nfind that\nfrom people i speak to when they look at\nwhat's happening in the news and\nhappening around us and happening all\nacross the world i mean it just feels\nbitter bit a bit a bit bitter like\nthere's there's not really\nmuch sweetness or the sweetness feels\nvery fleeting or the sweetness feels\nvery short-lived\nand the sweetness is more ephemeral than\nthe bitter and the bitter feels so bold\nand large and big that it just\novershadows i'm sure you have the same\nconversations\nand\nand and i found that getting to that\nbalance of seeing both and recognizing\nthat like it's it's it's tough it's i i\nfind that it's tough for people to\nunderstand that and and that's just a\nreflection based on what you're just\nsaying i i i agree that the balance is\nuseful and powerful and recognizing\nwhere we can support and help to me\nthat's always been the\nthe greatest lesson i think i learned\nlearned was you know in times of\nuncertainty don't look for certainty\nlook for service\nlike look for meaning look for purpose\nbecause you will always find meaning and\nservice and purpose in life\nyou will not always find pleasure and\nhappiness and joy\nwhich are not you know possible and when\ni look to\ni think the work of edith eager\nin her book the gift or\nvictor frankel in man search for meaning\nand you know two people who lived\nthrough\nincredible atrocities like\nthey\nturned towards finding meaning\nuh and and finding purpose and so i\nloved what you said at the beginning and\nso to me that's that's always been what\ncreates the balance is you can't just\nlook for joy i think looking for joy or\nexpecting pain\nare both\nreally tough places to live\nbecause if you look for joy you may not\nalways find it and if you live in pain\nthat's\nreally difficult and so looking for\nmeaning service and purpose seem to be\npaths forward to me at least i i agree\nwith that and and i would say to each\nindividual person listening to use the\nword and the ideal that speaks most to\nyou you could speak of of truth you\ncould speak of beauty you could speak of\nlove but but basically it's talking\nabout like look for the higher ideals\nbecause those kind of like transcend\nwhether you happen to be in a state\nof of joy or sorrow at any given moment\nthere's still\nthe higher ideals on top of all of that\nfor which we can live and i'll tell you\nlike just for me personally one\nexercise i found myself doing over these\nlast few years um and i just kind of\nstumbled into it but i start or i try to\nstart most of my days especially my work\ndays with an act of beauty\nso like i look at a lot of art on social\nmedia and almost every day i share art\non my social media feed and it's like\none of the first things i do and i start\nworking that morning and it's attracted\nall these other people who love that too\nand it's become a kind of community\nbased around that shared ideal and it's\na small act you know it's like\nhere's a piece of beauty to start our\nday with it's not going to save the\nworld but there's something about\nstepping in that direction that i think\nis\nis just incredibly helpful and uplifting\nyeah absolutely absolutely\nhow do you think we can i what i love\nabout this book is that\nyou're obviously talking about the\nindividual but you're also talking about\norganizations and companies and\nand and systems and\none of the things that fascinates me is\nthis idea that you bring up about how do\nyou think we can end the\nyou know the whole winners and losers\nidea and and tell us a bit about that i\nthought that was really interesting you\nknow people say well why do we have this\nwhole toxic positivity thing in the\nfirst place\nand i kind of went back and looked at\nour history and i\nthink a lot of it has to do with the\nfact that around the 19th century when\nthings became very focused on on\nbusiness like people started asking the\nquestion if somebody is a success or\nfailure at business\nis it because of good luck or bad luck\nor is it because of something in the\nperson\nand increasingly the answer became it's\nbecause of something inside the person\nand so and we started looking at people\nand characterizing people as either\nwinners or losers\nand over time the use of the word loser\nhas increased astronomically over time\nand if you think about it if we're all\nafraid to be losers and don't want to be\nassociated with being a loser then of\ncourse we're going to\navoid\nany discussion of anything that has to\ndo with loss or pain or you know sorrow\nor longing or like anything that we're\ntalking about you you would want nothing\nto do with it basically what it's meant\nis we're existing in this false\ndichotomy\nso\nwe have to get to\na place\nwhere collectively in in our\norganizations we can just kind of be\nmore comfortable with integrating\nall of these things together and that's\nso tough susan because like and i've i\nworked in the corporate world for uh for\na few years and i've i felt that they\nwere really trying to develop that\nculture and investing in it and they did\na pretty good job and that was around\nnine years ago now where they were doing\na good job which i'm sure it's improved\neven since then but\ni think that it's tough because like you\nsaid when you're chasing promotions\nand pay rises\nand career growth\nturning around saying hey i'm really\nstruggling at home\nit's very hard for an untrained manager\nor leader\nto recognize that those things can be\nconnected but also disconnected i i have\na team today and i know that i have team\nmembers that\ncould be going through something at home\nbut actually being at work is what lets\nthem get away from that and\nchannel channel their pain into work so\nwhat they're doing what you're saying\nwhich is they have a painful environment\nwhatever that it may be but they're\nfueling their work with that passion and\nmomentum to say i'm going to be more\ncreative i'm going to love this so it's\nnot necessarily that because they have a\ntroublesome\nhome that they're going to perform less\nat work but i think that\nthat requires a lot of emotional\nmaturity from leaders and managers to\nrecognize that work performance is not\ndirectly correlated with\nhome situation uh and and that it's a\nlot more complex than that so\nis there something that leaders and\nmanagers and people who lead people\neven if it's two people or one person\nlike even if it's leading your family\nyou know it's like how do how do you\nhow do we help people develop that\nemotional maturity because\nmost of us and and i i know i would say\nthat if i told my boss that\ni you know even if you told your boss\nlike i'm feeling like i've got a\nheadache this morning\nthat would feel like oh no no i can't\nsay that to them because if they think i\nhave a headache then they won't\nchallenge me or they won't think i'm\nreliable or they won't think that i'm\nsomeone they can trust because they're\nworried about me does that make sense\nyeah i mean it makes perfect sense in\nyour reminder i used to be a corporate\nlawyer before i became a writer and i\nremember so much this feeling of like i\nmean i did this in the 1990s i stopped\nin 2001. it was actually really before\nanyone was talking about this stuff\nbut i so remember the feeling of\nwalking into work and feeling like i had\nto put on a kind of emotional superhero\ncostume like you know everything had to\nseem like completely together all the\ntime and there was a way in which\nthat would make you feel really good in\nthe short term\nbecause you because you were wearing the\nsuperhero costume and that feels good um\nbut in the long term you get kind of\nburned out from it um so what can\nleaders do\nas with everything it's so helpful when\nleaders go first you know like\nfor leaders to model being able to talk\nabout something that's going on with\nthem at the same time that they're\nequally committed to their work\num that's opening the door let's showing\nother people how to do it and that it\ncan be done\nand and i do want to say and again this\nis me wearing my introvert hat here i i\nwant to say like\na lot of people don't want to show up to\nwork and divulge everything that's going\non in their private lives so\ni'm not talking about some kind of\nexpectation or obligation to be able to\ndo that\nbut rather for all of this to just\nbecome a more matter-of-fact\nno big deal way in which we relate to\neach other on a daily basis you wouldn't\nhesitate because why would you any more\nthan you would hesitate to say that\nyou're you know moving from one house to\nanother like\nthere's no real reason that's so much\nthat these topics have to be so loaded\nyeah i i really feel what you're\nencouraging is really healthy and\npowerful and i when in my own\nsubjective experience\nuh\nyou know when when i trained to be a\ncoach many years ago and today i do a\nlot of coaching whether it's\nuh private clients or exec coaching or\ncorporate coaching and\ni find that the greatest skill that i\ngained through\nmy monk time and and in my coaching work\nis the ability to hear someone's\nexperience\nwithout projecting my own value onto it\nso\nthe challenge with the human mind is\nwhen you hear someone has a headache\nyou think well when do i have headaches\nhow does that affect my performance\noh not good that means their performance\nwon't be good\nor even in a positive sense if we feel\nwe are trustworthy people\nwhen someone says something that sounds\ntrustworthy in our vocabulary we project\nthat they are trustworthy and so it\nworks both ways like we we give people\nbenefit of the doubt because of our\nprojected self\nvaluation and then we also project our\nnegativity or flaws onto other people as\nwell that if we would lie in a situation\nwe're more likely to think someone else\nis lying in that situation as well\nand so there's this projection mechanism\nthat's going back and forth and so\nit really requires so much emotional\nstillness\nto hear someone's experience and to\ntruly believe that that is just what\nthey're going through and that we need\nto almost be\ninvestigators not interrogators\ncuriously of what that means for them\nand and i think that's that\nbalance that i'm trying to do as a coach\nbut but even through the monk tradition\nwas like\ni think often in the corporate space\nespecially there's an interrogation\nversus a\nuh intrigue around someone's current\nexperience\nso you know it's if someone's not\nperforming well we interrogate them why\nare you not performing well what's going\nwrong like why haven't you shown up like\nwhy are your numbers down right like\nthere's that interrogation but because\nwe're thinking well oh if\nif i was performing badly then there\nmust be something wrong\nrather than the intrigue of like\nwell is there something happening like\nis there some way we can help you or\nor do you want to talk about anything\nwhich is far more of that\nintrigue versus interrogation so but i\nbut that requires a lot like\nit's so easy to slip into interrogator\nmode isn't it\nyeah i think this is one place where\nculture can really help um and here\ni'm thinking of one organization um\nthat i looked at in the book it was a\nuniversity of michigan case study\nuh by jane dutton and others and and it\nlooked at\nthis organization called midwest\nbillings\nand midwest billings was basically um\nthey were bill collectors for a hospital\nso so their job was to collect the\nunpaid bills of people who had been in\nthe hospital\nso this is not a fun job no one likes\nthis job the turnover in the industry is\nreally high because no one wants to do\nit but at midwest billings they somehow\ndeveloped this culture of compassion\nwhere everybody just like got really\ninto helping each other like in this\njoyful way and you know so if somebody\nshowed up with a cold\nlike they they were running to cvs to\nget the box of tissues you know if\nsomebody um\nwas going through domestic violence they\nwere like you know gathering around to\nsupport them um there's this one amazing\nquote from a woman who\nhad lived all her life with her mother\nher mother was her best friend her\neverything and then her mother died\nunexpectedly and it was like the worst\nyou know the worst time of her life\nand she says\nshe remembers how um\nshe felt like when this happened she's\nlike i have to get back to the office i\nhave to get back to the office\nand\nand she said it was partly because\nshe knew it would take her mind off\nthings\nbut she said she's like to this day i'll\nnever forget\nthe look of love\non leticia's face leticia was her\ncolleague and\nshe was like you don't expect that from\nyour co-workers i will never forget that\nlove\nand this unit\ntheir turnover was something like two\npercent it was like nothing compared to\nthe rest of the industry they got their\nbills collected in record time\num\nand it was because they had this culture\nwhere it was like pro\nit was proactive compassion it was like\nthey were all looking for the chance to\ndo it so as opposed to the\nthe attitude you were talking about of\nan attitude of interrogation and inquiry\nit was more like\nyay when we get the chance to be helpful\nto each other um and that's just it's a\nvery different\nemotional starting place yeah i mean\nthat's that's beautiful that's that's\nbeautiful and i can only hope and wish\nthat\nmore and more we can move towards that\nand i think the best thing you've just\nsaid now as well is that it's something\nwe have to create in our families in our\ncommunities and our towns it's it's not\nsomething we can expect from leaders or\ndecision makers it's something we're\ngonna have to bring to the spaces where\nwe have influence susan i could i could\nspeak to you for hours and hours because\ni feel like\nthe work that you do and the way you\nwrite and and even this conversation\nlike\ni feel like you've really given me\npermission to kind of\nreally reflectively have a conversation\nwith you rather than you know\nsystematically interview you and i\nappreciate you for that and and being\nable to go there as well but\nwe end every podcast and on purpose\nepisode with a final five so i'm going\nto ask you a final five and this is\ncalled the fast five where we answer\nevery question in one word to one\nsentence maximum\num okay which i'm terrible at okay no no\nproblems i'm terrible at sticking to it\nmyself but let's try uh so the first\nquestion is uh\nwhat is the\nbest thing you can say to someone who's\ngoing through something painful\ni love you\nthat's beautiful what is the worst thing\nyou can say to someone that's going\nthrough something difficult get over it\nor you know or some variation or\nanything that you do that that signals\nthat what uh third thing what's the\nfirst thing you do every morning and the\nlast thing you do every night\ni'm laughing at myself because the i\nwant to say the first thing that i do\nevery morning is listen to music but\nhonestly the first thing i do every\nmorning is look at my phone and i'm\nreally trying to get out of that\num\nwhat music would you do what music would\nyou like to wake up to i like that\nanswer that's beautiful oh i you know i\ni just kind of like go to my\nplaylist i i should say by the way i\nhave this bittersweet playlist that i\ncreated it's on spotify and it's on\napple music if people want to go there\num so lately i've been busy\nyeah yeah like if you google my or look\nin spotify under susan kane and\nbittersweet you'll find it i love that\nthat's so cool i hope everyone goes and\nuh\nuh downloads the playlist that's that's\ngreat i love that all right well\nquestion number four\nhow would you define your current\npurpose\nyeah telling the truth of what it's like\nto be alive you know like hopefully like\nand talk talking about the things that\npeople don't\nfeel like you can chit-chat about at the\ngrocery store but the things that matter\nthe most that's beautiful i love that uh\nand fifth and final question\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be i don't know what to say\nbecause i'll tell you the very first\nthing that i thought of\nis be kind but i'm really i'm resisting\nthat only because i think that when you\nstart\nmandating or regulating kindness that's\noften like the road to hell\num\nso it is my highest value but i\ndon't like to associate it with law or\nyou know or compulsion it it has to come\nfrom a different source than that\nabsolutely absolutely well susan thank\nyou so much for your time your energy\nyour presence in this conversation your\nyour vulnerability and for everyone\nwho's been listening and watching i hope\nyou go and grab a copy of bittersweet\nhow sorrow and longing make us whole we\nwill put the link to this in the caption\nin the comments uh please please please\ngo and grab a copy of the book if you\nenjoyed today's conversation if you want\nto learn more about how to deal with\nloss how to deal with sorry how to deal\nwith pain uh in the workplace in your\nlife when you're seeing it all around\nyou and the book evolves into the\nconversation we actually started with\nwhich is also dealing with death and\nloss in that way so i really hope that\nyou enjoyed this conversation susan and\ni would love to see what resonated with\nyou what connected with you so please do\ntag us on instagram on twitter on\nfacebook on whatever platform you use\nplease do let us know\nwhat were the insights that you're going\nto practice or remember what's going to\nchange the way you think about something\nand i'm hoping that this episode makes\nyou reach out to someone and say how are\nyou doing how are you doing really what\nis it that i don't know about you what\nis it something that we haven't spoken\nabout in a while so please do share this\nconversation with a loved one as well\nsusan any last words or anything you'd\nlike to share with our community no i\nmean thank you so much for having me so\nwonderful and unique to talk to you and\num\ni don't know to
