    "transcript": "sometimes you want to die sometimes you\nwill sit there and try to inflict pain\nto yourself or maybe my kids to sit me\ndown and say hey pay attention\nit's not all about you every day last\nyear\nwhen I say it and I said um I saw Jesus\nwalked down a golf course\nand people didn't realize what I was\nsaying I said did you see Jesus walk\ndown there\nbecause I saw [ __ ] Tiger Woods come\nback and win the damn master and had\neverybody gravitated to him\nand Michael wrote gave him that\nprivilege to say man go ahead this is\nyour turn now oh that's the last time\nI've seen something like that\nI was just saw it on TV oh you saw on TV\nyou know and then if you really want to\ntake it really back\nwas a tragedy and maybe somewhat\nunfortunate incident the OJ thing that's\nsomething I could really think of that's\nreally there was a really striking the\nlast 10 years so yeah for mine\neverything's a bit longer Michael\nJackson and Princess Diana right those\nare probably the two in my lifetime that\nI've definitely witnessed in no way but\nthank you for sharing that as well and I\nmean where I want to start is and I want\nto hear it from your own words because I\nthink when anyone is as in the public\neye as you are and the people that we\nsee and the people that we perceive\neveryone has their version of who they\nthink that person is but what I'm\ninterested in is who is Dennis Rodman in\nthe current version of how you see\nyourself\nwho is Dennis Rodman I think I just laid\nhim with some cool stuff right there but\num you know OJ you know you said Michael\nJackson now Kobe and I was trying to put\nthat in perspective for me who was in\nthe shortman let's see\nif it would have been me that that died\nI would have had a whole different\neffect in the world\npeople would have celebrated\nthere'll be no emotion it'd be oh this\nis what he wants stuff like that but for\nKobe and stuff like that\nmy level of uh power and control about\nthings on this planet it's different you\nknow people expect me to do certain\nthings don't respect when you do the\nKobe thing\nexpect me to do the cool stuff and have\nbreak breaking news around the world\nokay great then it's gonna do this for\nus then it's gonna do this for us then\nit's going to do this for us and excited\nabout not even trying to do this\nI'm just fortunate enough to be able to\nput my foot in the door it's okay you\nknow what\nlet me try to see how this is going to\nwork\nand uh for me it's not about the money\nthe praise and acceleration I give a\ndamn if it happens it happens I think\npeople look at me and more like\nwow he's still living\nyou know he is still living how we don't\nknow\nbut for me I know I'll understand that I\ncould persevere in certain certain\ntragedies so no certain Madness and\npeople\nlook at me such a\na creative and a weird light\nyou know\nand\nit's very difficult to explain Who I\nReally Am\nwho I really am you know in the\nbeginning I was such more like a diverse\nindividual but now it's more like\npeople expect me to do something great\nto do something really big\nand um if I did something that's going\nto be really normal uh he just looking\nfor you know some attention\nif I do something really big that's\ndifferent\nand that's why I'm at my love of my life\nright now they want to see me do\nsomething really big again you know not\nbecause they saved my life or help my\nlife it's more like wow it's unexpected\nbut I gotta do it not the cold Reason\nNot the Michael Jordan not this Tiger\nWoods but me of all people\nyou know so I think that's that gives\nyou a good light about me right yeah\nabsolutely and what does big mean to you\nlike for you when you think of doing\nsomething big for the world now and you\nfeel like that's what's expected but\nwhat does that mean to you\nI don't need to really\nprove myself anymore\nyou know I'll expect to be this human\nbeing that's that's fortunate enough to\nbe in this situation you know if it was\nmore like a\nyou know when it's a hard task for\nanyone to try to do anything that's\nreally creative because life today life\ntoday is really moving fast and it's so\nit's so dangerous to live life today\nand so because now we expect people to\ndie quickly\nback then the Elvis's the the guys in\nthe 60s stuff like that we had a trend\nback there 15 20 years ago 25 years ago\nthat the number 27 is kind of weird\ndo anybody know about this\nto number 27 every every Entertainer was\ndown here 27 years old at 27.\nand nobody knows this and it's like wow\nI didn't know that yeah I didn't you\nknow I mean why not she died at 27. all\nthe all the great artists between the\n60s and of the 70s all that at 27 years\nold oh wow\n27.\nI was just when I was 2017.\nI was just barely having sex\nthat's kind of weird I'm gonna be a\nsuperstar but it was it's just it's just\nso weird for people today don't really\nlook at life so seriously anymore they\ndon't because it's moving so fast\nbecause we need some we need some type\nof I don't need to keep our mind moving\nin the right direction yeah and it's so\nhard to sit there and try to control\npeople's mind and independency to say\nokay great here's some positive stuff\nfor you today yeah no no the fact that\nthere could be some negative stuff over\nhere too\nso it's like okay which direction are we\ngoing as human beings\nyeah and people don't want to people\ndon't have to take time out to sit down\nand understand that well you've said\nbefore that you think that things have\nbecome too easy for this generation\nright what do you mean by that it's two\nyears I think it's everything that's\nhanded to this generation right now I\nthink the people that like us in the 80s\nhas brought a lot of coolness to some\npeople in the 90s and now the 90s became\nthe 2000s and I was saying something the\nother day uh before the New Year's right\nI said do people don't realize that 2020\nis gonna be an important year for a lot\nof people\nyou know if 2020 is going to be\nimportant because everything you hear is\nabout is 20 20. High site 2020. so what\nyou do 20 years ago\nto now what you do everything's 20 20.\nand you ask people what does that mean\nwhat you're thinking me\nwhat do you think 2020 meets to do\nbecause we've been using this turn for a\nlong time 20 20. yeah you know you can\ngo out you can go to eye doctor oh\nyou've got Vision 2820 right that's what\nyou're going to find Clarity but we'll\nprobably find Clarity with it but most\nof the time we get 10 15 15 20 and stuff\nlike this but I said but this is at 20\n20. it's significant part gonna be this\nyear pretty much\nand I just think that people should\nreally take time out\nto think\nbecause for the world is moving so fast\nright now and like I said we had a\ncouple of transits this year\nand it made us think for a minute yeah\nand then when we it's going to happen to\nus again\nnext week\nwe're gonna all slow this world down for\na minute and open our eyes it can happen\nto us in this day and age\nbecause I see a lot of people in 50s and\n60s were doing so many hard drugs so\nmany so many stuff in the world man and\nyou see these people still living today\nwhy is that\nand you're seeing people's inflicted\ninflicting themselves with pain and\nstuff like that and I do it a lot and\nthat's what I'm surprised I'm still here\nbut\neverything is happening because we're\ninflicting all this negativity in our\nlives and we expect people to come and\ngive us positive positivity energy every\nday like this right here\njust like this right here you do it for\na living right\nand I don't want to insult you anything\nlike that but I don't know who the hell\nyou are I'm being honest\nI have no clue who you are but these\nguys gave me some information that the\nfact that you must got a powerful voice\nthat's why I'm here to share my voice\nwith you I'm grateful though man and I\nhave no I have no issue with you not\nknowing\na beautiful thing I have no clue I said\nbut I just heard so many good things\nsince I've walked up here and it's like\nwow is that he's that good because\nyou're only 32 years old yeah man I'm\njust very grateful that I met a lot of\namazing people when I was young so it\nall goes back to my mentors my teachers\nmy coaches it's not it's not me I can't\nreally take credit for it I'm just very\nfortunate I met a lot of amazing people\nwhen I was young yep awesome yeah so\nthat's just like uh it's just like if I\nbring them to uh the subject\nKim Jong-un yeah\nlet's go there let's go there let's go\nthere because a lot of people always ask\nme about that Kim Jong-un hmm\nI think people ask you about that but I\nand and I'm and I'm doing it differently\nbecause I think my perception and this\nis what I'm saying to the team before as\nwell is\nI'm more fascinated by you your choices\nthe way you live like I heard you say\nthat you know one of the only demon that\nyou're fighting right now is convincing\nyourself you're a good father right like\nlike what's fatherhood been like for you\nwhat's your favorite thing about it you\nhate that question I hate that question\nwhy do you hate that question because\nI'm doing it to myself\nyou're doing what to yourself in pain\nso that's that's a great place to that's\na great place yeah I want to go there\noh we don't need to go that's that's\ndown on the road right okay no no man\nit's just hard it's hard to understand\nhow you became such a great human being\nin the beginning of your life and all of\na sudden it's all about you now\nyou don't care about what people think\nwhat people do to you but you're always\nsitting there like I say about that\nself-inflicted\nbut for me it's more like it's me me I\ncan give about nobody pretty much that's\nmy kids and that's the tough part\nwhy I don't know\nI have no clue I'm like that yeah but\nit's hard\nwhat helps you think because you were\nsaying earlier that and I agree I'm\ntotally with you when you said that the\nworld is moving too fast so Gandhi has a\nbeautiful statement he said that there's\nmore to life than increasing its speed\nand everyone's trying to live their\nspeeded life right now we don't have\ntime to think we're focusing on\ndistractions I'm totally with you what\nhelps you think and process where do you\nfind time and space and gaps and the\nright people that you've got in your\nlife to help you think through this type\nof stuff or where do you want to find it\nwell it's funny though you know I was I\nalways ask people in Newport Beach have\nyou been in Newport Beach I have yes\nright and I asked people in bars\nrestaurant I said do anybody realize\nthat the fact that\ndo any black people live here\nI ask people all the time in Newport do\nany black people live here\nyou know probably you\nlived a lot\nyour license a lot but they said you\ndon't hear any black people living in\nNewport besides me Kobe shy who has a\ncouple other people that got money\nand like I said but things are moving so\nfast even the sports world even a sports\nworld it is so it is so\nit's so it's so hard and dangerous to\nlive the sports life now\nit's hard man yeah because this is more\nlike okay great\nand when it comes to religion and pride\nand\nand color and indivisions and stuff like\nthat I get so sick and tired of hearing\nthis this stuff about black white like I\ncan't stand it I cannot stand it it's\njust it's just you know like I said\nAwards when we're too down fast but it's\namazing though it is amazing when you\nsee\nblack and white\nand that's what I was trying to say\nabout the Kobe thing\nI said wow\nall I saw was around the world\nblack and white hugging each other\nwow\nbut we want to we want to put certain\nthings in our lives\njust screw it all up\nbut it takes something like this to\nbring everybody together yeah\nand it's that's the sad part\nI'm with you that's the sad part right\nthere it's no it don't matter what what\nwhat color creed you are but it takes\nthis type of this type of mess to put\neveryone together yeah and and for me\nI've been like that from day one I don't\ncare man\nthe only thing that I came seem to\nfigure out is that question\nwhy I'm a bad diet\nand I think I'm a good dad but and my\nkids ask I suck\nand I talk real I don't care a lot of\npeople like me because I talk like this\nand it's it still work out every day\nit's difficult to get out yeah all the\ntime sometimes you want to die sometimes\nyou want to sit there and try to inflict\npain to yourself [ __ ] that'll fix the\nwhole problem but for me it don't seem\nlike that's working either yeah but for\nme I think I need someone maybe my kids\nto sit me down and say hey\npay attention\nit's not all about you every day\nI think that's the key I think I need\nright there wow I'm gonna see if that's\ngoing to open the door and my eyes and\nsay okay great let me pay attention to\nmy kids finally wow so\nthank you for sharing that man thank you\nfor opening up absolutely and I'm with\nyou on that let's there's two points you\nraised there that I think are super\npowerful the first one is why does it\ntake a tragedy to bring about unity and\nI actually went and did\na few mini docs last year where we went\nand focused on areas in the US that had\ngone through tragedy so like the the\nhurricane in Houston and we looked at uh\nsome of the shootings that happened in\nOrlando and and because of that so many\ncommunities that were initially against\neach other actually came together right\nand that's exactly the question we were\nasking right and and sometimes it's the\nsame for us like what you're sharing\nlike sometimes it's the same for us like\nunfortunately sometimes until we\nexperience deep pain we don't feel\nforced to change and I'm sure you've\nexperienced that in your life where deep\npain brought about big changes in your\nlife yeah that right there is a good\nstatement that's a great statement I\nthink the Deep pain for me has really\nelevated my whole life as far as\nthinking\nyou know sometimes I understand it\nbecause sometimes I don't understand it\nbut it just it's just hard to really\nwhen you've done so much in your life\nit's hard to really wake up in the\nmorning and wonder what can you do\nthat's different it's going to excite\nyour life every day yeah you know\nI hear a lot of people say you know I've\ndone everything in the world\nI'm one of them I'm saying\nwhat's love for Dennis Rodman yeah\nthat's there's only other one person\nI've I heard Joe Walsh say something\nfrom the Eagles so when he was speaking\nand event I remember a few years ago\nhearing him say that I wonder how much\nof what you've experienced though and\nyou can be honest I don't know the\nanswer to this I'm asking as a student\nof your life how much of when you say\nyou've done everything how much of that\nis material versus spiritual how much of\nthat is internal versus external trying\nstuff out I think when I started talking\nlike that\nI'm always talking about this this whole\nthing I said\nI see why I'm talking like this but I\ntalk just like my mother I talk like my\nmother because she's a you know\nspiritual person\nI never been so spiritual in her life\nbecause she's been playing for the truth\nfor like 50 years 55 years piano and she\nbelieves in the spirit of love but every\ntime I start talking like that when I\nsaid that's my mother talking huh and I\nstarted seeing myself doing a lot of\nthings my mother's done in the past and\nI'm like wow man\nand I put a smile on my face and I\nstarted thinking about her yeah because\nshe's she's like like a lot of mothers\naround the world they've been through a\nhard hard stretch in their lives in the\n40s to 50s 60s you know and now things\nare easier but\nfor me I just think that God man I just\nlook at the whole lot of cool things\nthat's happened in my life and see what\ncan I do to bring It Forward in this\nlife you know I'm trying to elect this\n[ __ ] I'm trying to do something 20 20. I\nwant to do something about as 20 people\nabout as 20 people 20 questions and\nfocus on the last 20 years of your life\nand show me hindsight 2020 and you'll\nlove that in your life only 20 people 20\nQuestions doing 20 years 20 years let's\ngive me 20 years of your life right here\nthat's a great idea that's it 20 years\nof your life show us your life and see\nyou know I don't I don't care what it is\nwhat generation whatever this existence\nyou could be five years old you'll be 25\ntoday\nso I'm read 25 years to come to 20 years\nof your life to this day wow I like that\nto this day people are so fascinated by\nyou who would be your 20 people that\nyou're fascinated by like I'm I'm like\nyou said like you've done everything I'm\nfascinated to know who you would be\nfascinated by to ask that question to I\nthink that's a brilliant that is the\nbest idea I've heard all year well yeah\nthat's a great idea but I want to\nbasically I want to basically get 10\nkids\non the age of 10. okay\non the age of 10.\nsee what this what they would say they\nweren't born 20 years ago I want to hear\nwhat they say they would have been doing\nthe last 20 years\nI want to hear that under the age of 10\nand we get 10 of 10 kids we're gonna be\nfive six seven eight nine years old I'm\ngonna ask those 10 kids because\nthey're gonna give you the answer\nsomething like you know I wasn't born 20\nyears ago\nbut if you throw a question the kids\ntoday especially that they're young\noh but you're working iPhone can you you\ncan sit there and do anything to work\nwith a iPhone you can go to all these\nlittle secret compartments and stuff\nlike that but you can't tell me what you\nwould do 20 years ago until now you\ncan't tell me but you could tell me\nabout my life yeah\npromised myself I want to put that to\nkids and see how kids respond to that\nyeah and then give me 20 give me give me\n10 people\nage or 25 to 40.\n25 to 40. now I want to hear you I want\nto hear your answers\nhear your answers I want to hear those\nkids I'm a 10 years old it must sound\nsimilar are they\nI don't want to say how similar are they\nand people will be surprised it could be\nso similar\nwill be so similar because it if you\nlook at families lives today\na lot of people that have kids that are\nparents or those and stuff like that\nthese kids are pretty much the parents\nif you see people that are parents these\nparents are walking behind the kids now\ndon't worry about their kids they listen\nto these kids that's five to ten years\nold\nyou know\nthere's no control about anything in\nlife today but but we do have\nself-control in certain areas of our\nlife\nyou know just like they say in China and\nHong Kong they got a different regime\nover there\nthe week when we start speaking about\nChina and Hong Kong and Tokyo and stuff\nlike that we got no business saying\nanything about those guys\nno business\nbut to deal us though they love us\nthey love American people\nthey love American people\nand for people to sit there and say look\nreligions around the country\nand with China and Tokyo and Hong Kong\nis doing\nthey are trying to do they try to create\nthis new regime now\nor whatever that's been there for\nhundreds and hundreds of years they want\nto see this stuff change\nstuff change stuff like that it's just\nlike Donald Trump he wants to be the\nfirst thing the first guy to do\neverything first\nyou know oh I broke a mirror together\nbecause of Kim Jong-un yeah he did to\nforget that black guy that's right don't\nforget don't forget that black guy then\nfirst okay so she said you know but\nthose things that people don't\nunderstand about life I think you do\nbecause I think you have a a full\nreligious about really cool stuff in\nyour life at 32 years old you know you\nsay you should Buddhism right so like\nstuff like that\num but\nit's just just it's just a beautiful way\nto look at life through my eyes and\nthrough your\nand try to see some type of weakness and\nsome type of a consistency as far as\nhappiness and joy with people I try my\nable to see that let's see that but it's\ndifficult to see because too much\nnegativity in people\nyou know people next door over here will\nsit there and tell you to get the hell\naway from me quick\n[Music]\nyou know but but I love the experiment\nman that's a great idea that's a great\nI'm just saying people people would love\nto tell you get the hell away from them\nquick right\nbut then when you go to an airport\npeople are so sad and their voice the\nman that's sad\nman I understand\nyou know you'll get more happiness in a\nhospital you're doing an airport\nwhy do you think that is do you ever\nthought about stuff like that you go to\na hospital you'll get more happiness\nthere do you want to get a damn Airport\nbecause again it takes that it's when\nwe're in that deep pain with that deep\npain or something like that you know\neverybody in the airport is so like if\nso like if Russia Russia Russia Russia\nRussia but you can't go anywhere unless\nthat plane goes somewhere okay so you\nsit here you don't want to sit back next\nto somebody because you know if I sit\nnext to them I gotta go with it then\nwash my hands sanitation okay you know\nwhat\nyou know what we're so like disease to\npeople I'm like okay great so boom if\nyou go to a hospital at least people are\ntrying to these people crying for a\nreason\nthese people are sad for a reason at\nleast people are doing one thing trying\nto bless bless the Holy Spirit to help\nhelp that's right there's a whole\ndifferent story right there\nokay so when you leave the hospital the\ndoctor said it's okay it's okay\ndon't have to run away oh okay it's okay\nit's okay\ndon't have to hide away\nthis is my voice this is my choice\nunderstand that one damn I understand\nthat one quick I'm quick but this is how\nI like to talk yeah I'm pretty sure\nyou're talking a different way but I\nthink no it's great man we come like\nthis right here so and and I can say\nthis about me\nI try not to try to go too deep into\nsomething I don't know anything about I\nlove that me too man me too tell me tell\nme I want to know out of you've said\nyou've done everything you've had all\nthe experiences tell me about\nthe most joyful experience you've ever\nhad\nthe experience that you had that made\nyou the most happy for you whatever it\nis\nbeen broke\noh wow when was that\nnot too long ago I'm sorry\n[Laughter]\nI'm scared\nno just I mean seriously not having\nmoney okay why why was that the most\njoyful happiest time in your life versus\nhaving money and having Fame and\nwhy was that the one that you chose I'm\nintrigued\nwhen I life back then let you live a\nlittle bit that's no precious there's no\nthere's no agulation to do anything\nthat's you know significant to hurt\nother people so you go outside every day\nand live live and be happy happy happy\nand there's nothing there's nothing\nthat's going to continue to sit there\nand say okay you got to go over here\nokay great I love the fact that I got\nkicked out of the house I love that I\nlove the fact I live on the street love\nthat one because it got me going today\nhow I live today I love the fact that I\ndon't like about money because it hurts\nme more than anything in the world so uh\nif you look at some of the things I've\nsaid over the years my interviews I said\nyou know what I didn't play the game for\nthe money I didn't play the game faculty\nI didn't play the game to be famous I\njust love the game I love making people\nhappy\nthat's all I always say\nso that right there is the most happiest\ntime I've been in my life when I was\nbroke wow that's powerful man so I\ndidn't know a lot of people who would\nsay that it takes a lot to say that so\nyou give me 20 bucks a week I've had\nthat best going on for 10 days\nI'll ride it out for 10 days\nthat's me right there they'll tell you\nthat yeah but and what's been the most\nwhat's been the most challenging part of\nyour life where you overcame a big fear\nof yours or you overcame a big challenge\nof yours that you were struggling with\nbecause that was the one that most\npeople would have put into that for\nchallenging so now I'm intrigued to hear\nwhat what you have found is a challenge\nor where you feel like you've really\nbroken through a fear\nmy brother to a fear I think that's like\nthat\nI think uh\na man in my life I called him my father\nI didn't let that bother me\nI said you'd be my friend\nI broke through that right there I\ndidn't let something that was so missing\nout of my life\ndeterred me to keep living the way I'm\nliving so when something like that comes\nback in your life and it was it's a\nhurtful thing it's all [ __ ] painful\nthing painful\nas a distance I'm trying not to be like\nhim or something like that I want to do\nthat I want to keep it aware I can say\nokay great this is my friend\nbut I've got I broke through that right\nthere because I could have just bowed\ndown to him it's okay great you owe me\ntwo or three million dollars man you\nknow you came here and ruined my life\nyou know you wrote a couple books about\nI mean you didn't give me a damn dime so\nand I'm like I'm like the first kid you\nhad out of 49.\nbut you still didn't care about me\nbut you will not get anything anyway\nwhat I asked to me and I said it's okay\nit's okay everything's gonna be all\nright every little thing is going to be\nall right\npeople don't know about that every\nlittle thing not the big thing every\nlittle thing is going to be all right\nthat's beautiful man right that's huge I\nmean I'm I don't know many people who\nhave been in that situation that's\nthat's huge and that's definitely a huge\nfear to break through it's a huge fear\nto break through I just want to\nacknowledge that because it's important\nto recognize that and it's funny that\nwe're doing we're doing your podcast\nhere and they said you're the number one\nin the world\nso I guess they'll get a great uh vision\nand a view about me and saying that we\nknow we didn't know some of these things\nabout Dennis\nI hope I've written both some dead\ninterviews and stuff like that and like\nI said for you to be 32 years old and\nhave this knowledge that I probably\ndon't have at you know when I was 32\nyears old\nyour wisdom and your and your outlook\nand your praise about you know Holy\nSpirit and whatever you believe in the\nworld a lot of people can't get to this\ngravitation what you got\nand I have to pretty sure that's why\nyou're so famous that's why this is this\nis really happening for you around the\nworld you're reaching to people\nthat can't say you can't do what you do\nat 32 years old bro 32 years old\nthat's very kind to me\nI'm listening like I said I've never\nheard this before but I'm pretty sure\nI'm gonna hear about it after we leave\nhere so so I hope so so yeah no I hope\nso but but no man like I said to you and\nthis is why and I mean this I'm not just\nsaying this I mean it like\nwe are all\nfortunate or unfortunate based on who we\nmeet in our lives and the impact that\nthey have on us right like for you Pearl\nJam like I mean like you know I want you\nto share about that because I think that\nwe have people who either change the\ntrajectory of our life extend our lives\nI was just you know if I'm completely\nhonest I was an average kid who loved\nthe same stuff that every kid loves\nright I I I wanted to date hot women I\nwanted to make a lot of money and I\nwanted to be famous when I was 18 years\nold like what else do you want when\nyou're 16 17 18 I wasn't a saint growing\nup I was just one of those people who\nwanted to do everything that was out\nthere in the world but when I was 18\nyears old I met someone\nand and now in hindsight I look back\nwhen I was 18 I'd met people who were\nRich I've met people who are famous I've\nmet people who are beautiful but I never\nmet anyone who was happy and when I met\nthis monk I believed that he was fully\nhappy and now after knowing him for 14\nyears I'm still convinced that he's\nhappy and when I saw that and\nexperienced that at 18 I was like I want\nthat I don't want any of this I want\nthat I want that experience I want that\nfeeling because I could see everything\nelse around me so for me it's I owe it\nall to the people that I was exposed to\nand similarly with you when you talk\nabout like when you're exposed\nsaid in things that saves you from it\nsaves you from your own self or for your\nown self pretty much yeah a program that\npretty much put me on on the um on\ndifferent levels for his living\nthey gave me opportunity when I you know\nbecause I was lost at a particular time\nand I wanted to shoot myself kill myself\nor kill the old dentist and um and they\njust came my life at the right time\n1991.\nand for you to do what you do I say I'm\n32 years old 18 14 years ago hey you\nwant that I just say the same thing I\nwant to be happy I don't give a damn\nabout anything I'd rather be broke don't\nbe unhappy it's hard to be honest but\nPearl Jam's a big part of my life I\nthink uh certain people that this has\nreally integrated into my life you know\nyou got Darren will you got there you\ngot certain people that can sit there\nand say Brian that's really been an\nintegral part Jerry bus yes blessing\nsoon Genie bus bless my heart\num Phil Jackson Chuck Daly James Rich\nthose four men right there I can say his\ndad too but you know you know they make\na whole team right yeah\nbasketball team right well you just pick\ncertain people in your life but as you\nsaid you met this month\nand I I met people like that like I said\nthere's four or five people right there\nI mean literally right there\nthey actually changed my life in such a\ndifferent way I always say if you put\nthis in a blender if you have a great\nhuman being\nbecause they got different things\nchanging seasons change your mind change\nthe way you think but guess what they're\nstill not ready they're going to the\nsame path\nyou know and always be right but you\nknow what they're talking about you know\nwhat they're trying to get you to uh get\ninto and try to live your life in a\ncertain way and uh like I said I love\nlistening to people that has more than\nme mentally wise me too mentally wise\nyou know you give me a hundred million\ndollars trillion dollars I don't care\nabout that you know I would be someone\naround somebody that's happy as hell and\nthis has a clear voyancy about how to\nlive life to the day you know 15 20 25\nyears down the road you know I want to\nget to that happiness that happy place\nyou know you know obviously you know I\nwas happy playing basketball I was happy\nas a retirement person as I'm doing now\nretired but it's still man there's\nsomething still missing for me yeah\nsomething's still missing man you know\nlike I said I've been a lot of things in\nmy life could have changed my world\ncompletely I could have died many times\nthe last 15 years it has nothing to do\nwith drugs\nmaybe I'll call but not drugs drug is\nalcohol too but but as far as like many\ntimes I could have been damn when I look\nat this all the time man you know I just\nsee death man like for me it's a\nhappiness it's a blessing you know I'm\nafraid of living that's the key I'm\nafraid of living I'm afraid to live\nmaybe that's why I keep pushing those\ndamn buttons\nall the time but there's a message in\nthat way if you are still here having\nnearly had all those opportunities to\ndie in the last 15 years\nthere's still an experience here for you\nthat is waiting for you that is calling\nyou that's pulling you to it and and in\nmy opinion it's an internal experience\nbecause you know whatever my opinion's\nworth I really feel that external\nexperiences and internal experiences\nexternal ones are tangible they're gross\nyou feel them but the internal\nexperiences take some time and they\nbecause they're harder to see and we're\nnot trained to see them we can miss them\nsometimes right you know I see things on\nTV he's gonna laugh when I say this one\nI was just saying straight up\nJoe Osteen I'm just gonna have to say\nthis down man excuse me\nI don't know\nhow happy can you get\nI mean how happy can you get and he's\nlike seeing like the most happiest\ncreature on this planet I mean when he\nstarted speaking oh I can do this I'm\nlike oh my God right\nlike damn\nhow happy can you get is anyone in the\nworld that damn happy\nis anyone out there that's that damn\nhappy that you have new trials and\ntribulations that you need no help but\nyou're that damn happy every day that's\nthe but that would be if you define\ndeath happiness as being free of Trials\nwhich is not true and happiness not\nneeding any help which is not true\nthat's not how do you define happiness I\nhave to play this you know I try to\nspell it in different like languages I\ntry to put it in backwards I try to put\nit angrily you know it's not trying to\nput it every different way but you know\ndamn for some real reason it comes back\nto the damn\nwhy are you trying to get that Dennis\nwhy are you trying to get to this happy\nplace\nI don't know Disneyland said the same\nthing it's the happiest place on Earth\nit's pretty close it is a happy place\nalready when you leave or you'll miss\nher as hell so it's like okay great so\nI've been trying to look for happiness\nman for a long time\nnow you know I got keys I got keys in my\npocket\nsome some things work and some keys\ndon't\nso basically you know I do have a key to\nopen a door for my kid's life\nI do have keys to open the door for\npeople that need me\nbut I don't have a key to open the door\nto keep me you know together\nwow I don't but it's around me it's\naround me man you know like I said\neveryone needs help I need help every\nday yeah we all do we need help every\nday we all do yeah I gotta say one of\nthese days I'm gonna sit down with my\nkids\nand then have them tell me what's up I\nthink that's a great idea because a lot\nof people a lot of people don't sit down\nwith their kids and say how you doing\nwhat's up no no okay great but I'm gonna\nask my kids just sit down maybe in an\ninterview and feel they can be one of\nthe 20 people 120 people I don't know\nwhat they have to say but I'm saying in\ngeneral just I would love to ask them on\nTV so people can see what I've been\nsaying here on TVs and get my reaction I\nlove why I won't do this why why I won't\ntake time out to to express why how much\nI love you so much but I'm so afraid the\nfact that if you tell me no I hate you\nthat we'll reject you\nthat's my only fear with that\nso if you tell me something like that\nI'll probably do something really bad\nyou know\num speaking wise yeah so I don't want to\ndo that but I just I would love my kids\nto sit down and ask me three questions\nabout my life and about them three\nquestions I said\nyeah so I want people to see what I've\nbeen saying for so many years\nand watch me see my kids eyes the pain\nthey go through yeah well I'm hoping\nthat\nthe way I'm hearing it from you is very\nsincere like the way I'm hearing it from\nyou is like you really want to learn you\nyou really want to throw like I'm not\nhearing it from her and I'm hoping that\nif your kids hear it in that tone then\ntheir initial reaction may be what you\nthink it may be but after that I think\npeople I think sincerity of intention\nthe way you're living this sincerity and\ngenuineness of just wanting to know I\nthink that will help them actually tell\nyou the truth I think that will actually\nmake them go beyond what you think\nthey're going to say and actually give\nyou an opportunity to hear from them\nbecause of the way you're asking it yeah\nwhen I asked them I mean I think that\npeople don't understand that it takes a\nlot a lot of a lot of heart\nto break down to someone oh 100 that\ntakes the biggest cause that's the\nbiggest courage right there to just let\nsomeone break you down for a day let\nthem break you down for a day let them\nsee let me see you see to you let me see\nopen up to open up to me it's it's okay\nit hurt it's okay to cry it's okay to\nhave this pain it's okay and whenever I\ndo get emotional I love being happy\nafterwards because I think I'm just just\ncleansing\nyou know that day of the system misery\nand pain yeah and I just man I get\nemotional I love it I just start smiling\nI start smiling when I do that and and\nI'm pretty sure these three guys right\nhere these two guys right here pretty\nsure he had a better off go get\nemotional today I'd be quick yeah you\nknow but I you know this is a good\nformat for me there's some people around\nthe world understand\nhow I am in life you had Kobe you had\nall the great people in the world on the\nshow\nyou know a lot of people like like Kobe\ntiger or whoever had on you on your on\nyour own show here a lot of people try\nto ask smart people and try to outsmart\nthemselves\ninstead of looking in deep and say you\nknow what man\nI do it I do have the ability to show a\nlittle light to the world\nand like I said it just took\n41 years somebody's life to realize how\nyou stop the world like that quick that\nquick\nand that was insane that's what stopped\nthe world\nand it's powerful\nthat's powerful so I think this is going\nto be a good thing for people to see me\nwhen I you know leave here today go to\nMiami and stuff like that for the way\nyou're gonna probably express it\nafterwards and stuff like that so I\nthink what I really appreciate and I\nthink we're living in a time now where\nwhat you just said like\nyou sell yourself short when you\noutsmart yourself right and you sell\nother people short when you outsmart\nyourself and people can tell when you're\nkind of outsmarting yourself right so\nwhen you kind of put all that smarts out\nthe way and you just go I'm just gonna\nbe right and I'm just gonna talk as if\nI'm you're literally I feel right now\nI'm hearing your thoughts you're not\nfiltering them to me no you're not\nchecking them you're not like oh I can't\nsay this you're not like oh I should cut\nthis out like you're not filtering them\nand I think people like hearing an\nunfiltered thought process because\nthat's what it sounds like to be in any\nof our heads right right and so and\nthat's the same with me and this in this\nconversation that we're having I'm also\nasking you my most unfiltered question\nright because I'm just like okay we're\ngoing unfiltered I'm unfiltered too like\nthat's where we gotta go so my next\nquestion or next thought that I have is\nout of all the experiences you had what\nwas the one that was crazy for you and\nthat was surprising for you which one of\nyour Ventures or experiences that you\ntook was the most surprising to yourself\nnot just to the world the one that you\nthink is the most extreme the most crazy\nthem it could have been me and Kim\nJong-un but it could be anything all\nright what's this stream I think\nthe thing that you did that surprised\nyourself that you were like wow I can't\nbelieve I did this you know because\npeople think that of you well I think\nthe most surprising thing I think a lot\nof people\num play this uh video more than anything\nfor me I like the fact that people saw a\ninnocent\nguy I come from Oklahoma\nand he left the most simplest thing in\nthe world\ntouching\nand that video is so powerful just just\nthat video alone that's when I met when\nI was in the NBA\nand they say you want to defensive\nplayer of the year\nthat won't even know money that was\nsomething like that for me to sit there\nand show the world how much emotional\nthat I felt the fact that these people\ngave me an opportunity and I'm not\ntrying to fail these guys and thank you\nfor letting me be myself thank you guys\nthank you and I wasn't about no money it\nwas just the fact that I got so emotion\nbecause I worked myself to do what I got\nto do now because I could have went to\njail I could have been a drug dealer I\ncould have did so many negative things\nin my life but for some damn reason\nsomebody's got to handle my damn\nshoulder every day when I leave here so\nlet's go have a hand on my shoulder\nso and I just praise it all the time I\nwas thank you when I go home one time I\nsay thank you let me live man\nyou know I'm not playing no guys or\nanything like that I'm just just\nwhoever's around thinking let me live\nanother day it's simple\nand have you explored that a little bit\nlike in terms of like looked into like\nwhat you think is there for you what's\nsupporting you like because obviously\nthat's a special that's very rare and\nspecial for you to feel that and\nexperience that as extremely as you have\nand you've always had a big heart like\nyou've always been you're known as\nsomeone who has this immensely big heart\nwhere does that come from tell me where\nthat I have no that right there I don't\nthink I've ever expressed that what what\nwhat why do I have this this heart that\nthis this totally so big to people\nand the same sense it's so bad to people\nit's like I'm saying the same damn\ncategories like damn I got this heart is\nso damn big but damn over here I'm so\nbad you know I was like\nand and it reminds me of something that\nwas cool man remind me of something\nthat's cool\nI think it's only been one man that's\nwalked in this this planet Earth One Man\non this planet Earth\nit wasn't I don't think it was Jesus I\nthink it was Moses\nand he went and parked around to see and\nhe told if you guys want to join me come\non everybody's inviting\ngood or the bad or ugly come on\neveryone's invited\nand he didn't say anything he said my my\nhands my heart is open for everybody\nand they really came down and gave you\nthe Ten Commandments until this day do\nyou realize those Ten Commandments\npeople do not even buy it by those Ten\nCommandments\nand that's a set of rules right there we\nalways try to teach our kids to try to\nbe you know contained in certain things\nin life\nbut if you look at the Ten Commandments\nyou look at this this Freedom if you ask\nanybody in the world do you know the Ten\nCommandments\nhe said what is that\nI don't know man what is it you know if\nyou ask anybody what is to take command\nlet's hear the name of all Ten\nCommandments and say no that's a good\npoint shoes that they will say no\nmatter of fact have you seen the Bible\nsay you know you know what what does the\nBible say to us\nkids don't know that\nwhen did you get exposed to Ten\nCommandments in the Bible for you oh\nthank you man I've been Exposition I was\nlike two three four five years old you\nknow I've been to church three times a\nday three\num three days a week you know\nbut it's just funny how\nwhen Moses said I'm gonna part the Red\nSea\nI wanted to see somebody do that today\nI just want to do that today part\nsomething that you've never seen before\nyeah\nand I told you I said I've seen I've\nseen Tiger Woods do like last show for\nthe master was that last year Masters\nwhen he won the Masters and everybody on\nthe planet Earth\nthousands of thousands of people are\nfollowing him you thought that was you\nthought that was Black Jesus or black\nMoses or God\nand obviously I've never seen them in\nhistory you know since I've been living\non this Earth they still have one human\nbeing Captivate the world\nin a happy way even though he did a lot\nof crazy things sexual uh uh marital uh\nkids stuff right there he turned it all\nthe way around in one damn day\npeople loved his ass\nand all he did was curse something\nthat's all they did but you saw people\ncrying you saw people laughing you saw\npeople doing one that's what I'm saying\nthat's how powerful certain people in\nthe world can do this that's how\npowerful people Minds can be just like\nthat if you're thinking a good life\nsometimes\nyou know good love would happen to you\nyour life I have a lot more shining than\nit has a lot more meaning you know so I\njust like looking at things like that\nthat really profound me to keep me alive\nkeep me focused keep me in a good light\nso\nare you that kind of person like are you\nsomeone who looks back and thinks I wish\nI could have done it differently or are\nyou someone who thinks I'm I'm looking\nfor\na moment where I can kind of cleanse and\nlet go now like are you someone who\nlooks forward or looks backwards and and\nwhat helps you push forward I look at I\nlook a lot of things you know backwards\nstuff forward I was looking at things\nthe other day I said wow\nthat Kim Jong-un thing was really big\nright and it was really bad too\num\ntell us about it what a funny huh\nit was big you know it came really bad\nthen became big again\nthat's the things I'm talking about\nright there\nright there I wanted a few people in\nthis planet they could have that type of\nsay power\nyou know one of three people in the\nworld I can't do this right here this is\nnot this is your thing you know but I do\nthings out there because now I'm trying\nto tell these guys you know I said hey\nthere is no way in in the hell I can go\nout there and try to do this right here\nand people believe me at all yeah we all\nhave different people I understand for\nme now since I've been able to do these\ncertain things around the country people\nlooking for the next big thing for me\nthat next big thing for me\nand I said to people I said you know\nwhat\nI said you know I'm gonna tell you\nsomething\nyou want to see another powerful man\ncome to America am I sit not the\npowerful man I mean a powerful man and\nwatch people in America would literally\nglobally watch him\nobviously Kim Jong-un\nbecame traumatic even though people say\nhe's daddy kills people I don't know I\nhaven't seen that I've seen the country\nbut I've never seen that what did you\nsee when I did a history very well and\nstuff like that but I try to put in\nperspective I said this is the 21st\ncentury man you know you can't keep\nhaving a hatred every damn day\nI mean it don't go no don't go too that\nfar\nI mean we want to see some happiness in\nthe world I'm listening to some big\nthings around the world you know we want\nto see Kim Jong-un hey man come to my\ncountry I love you guys come to my\ncountry hey let's go to you know South\nKorea oh okay great president Moon oh\nokay let's go over to Russia and get\nthat guy a chance and so when you get to\nthe bat let's get this guy a chance so\nyou know that's what I liked right there\nbecause either way\ndo you go around this neighborhood\nthere's different cultures living with\neach other man different cultures just\nlike your culture you know I'm here\ntalking to you I love talking to you\nlike this me too because I love this\nright here all day long you know so but\nI think that uh\nI think people going is looking for me\nto do the next big thing in 2020 and\nit's gonna happen I don't know when how\nbut it's going to happen in 2020 for me\nokay man I I see that we're looking\nforward to it I see that yeah so you\nknow like I said it's but it's it's not\ngonna be about the money yeah you know\nwhen I went to North Korea I never got\npaid\nyeah never got paid doing that you know\nso but what was what was your uh\nhappiest you said basketball made you\nvery happy what was your happiest moment\nin basketball\nyou're like happiest memory from that\ntime\nuh my daughter came and saw me play when\nI was 30 33 34 years old she saw my\nfirst game ever she was like nine or ten\nI had like\nI had a triple double that day I had\nlike 13 points 22 rebounds and 10\nassists and I was like wow that was\nhappy mother got shoes with that\ncheering cheer Insurance that's the only\none of my one of my kids that's ever\nseen me play basketball oh wow she's the\nonly one wow so uh speaking of kids\nchange gears on that right there yeah\nsure but the happiest moment in my life\nI mean one of the few had happened I was\nin uh Thomas friends\nand these three kids I'm walking in the\nstore these three kids are running\naround running around with a camera\nphone running around I'm like what's\nwrong with these kids but they just kept\nrunning around and one kid said hey can\nI ask you a question I said what is that\nhe said is this you\nI said yeah that's kind of cool huh that\nmade me feel good as hell right there\nthat made me feel good as hell for that\nday cause this kid was out of his way to\njust just to let me know is this shoe\na clown\nand I threw it back I said damn I used\nto be that happy but without a phone but\nI was like he went out of his way to ask\nme is that you yeah and that's that's\nkind of kind of make you feel good\nbecause this kid probably eight nine\nyears old I have no clue where the hell\nI am but he went out his way to go check\nme up and check me out and say is this\nyou I said yes that's a great\nI still got it yes yeah so those were\nthe things like that makes me happy I\nmean it was right there so\nI think if people get anything out of\nthis podcast here they don't get a good\nRevelation the fact that\nI don't try to get too deep in a lot of\nstuff\na lot of simple things in the world I\nlove to tell them my life simple I love\nto say simple things\nand I always say the most simplest\nthings make you happy the most simplest\nthings in the world make you money the\nmost obvious things in the world\nit's the problem\nbut to me to me most obvious thing you\ncan do anything in the world the most\nobvious things because a lot of people\ncan't make money\na lot of people can't make money\nbecause you you play this you can go sit\nthere and try it but a lot of people\ncan't make money\nand that's a big process today\nmoney\nyou know we gotta when you got Amazon a\nguy go in his damn uh garage or house\nand wrote a damn book and he's worth\nabout 250 billion dollars off of books\nplease help me out I mean these guys\nwere 250 damn dollars I mean 250 billion\ndollars off of bucks\nthe simple thing in the world\nand these books are all about us in the\nworld\n[Music]\nhe so pretty much I sold to the world so\npeople can understand us\nwow\nI'm just saying awful books\nwith books to everything else\nand it's funny though man you know other\npeople say oh my God he was he wrote his\nwife for 40 billion dollar check and\ndidn't care\nuh\nI like what you said about the simple\nthings I get that simple things man what\nwas it about what has it been for you in\nrelationships and dating what are the\nsimple things there that were\nsteady\nlet's go there we all got that problem\nright we all got that problem\nthings that dang's tough and it's got\ntougher now with technology and I say\nthis with a great great admiration to my\ncommunity the gay community and they've\nbeen discussed a great supporter of me\nyou know they asked me in 1983. they\nsaid Dennis\nif you came out and said that you was\ngay\nI said you know what probably the most\nhappiest guy in the NBA\ndamn huh\num damn wow\nif people don't even get that part you\nknow and people look at me in that light\nwe've been talking the whole time about\nthis light and stuff like that if I\nwould have said that I was gay which I'm\nnot gay I'm sorry but my gay community\nsupported me when I was dressed in\nwomen's clothes and doing drag shows it\ngoing stuff like that I would probably\nbe the happiest guy in the world in the\nNBA\nforeign\njust because\nthe community that I love the most is\nthe gay community\nthey don't show no filter by anything\nthey love living life they love living\nlife\nso I you know it's funny though people\nsay oh he's gay so whatever you know\npeople expect me to be gay people expect\nme to do all these things in the world\nman all these things in the world all of\nthem\njust because you expressed yourself how\ndo you express myself you express\nyourself which gave everyone permission\nI gave people permission years ago 1993\n94 95 in San Antonio\nto understand this guy Dennis Rodman\nbecause back then you know I wasn't even\nacting out I was just more like just\nshowing this this the real Dennis Rodman\nthe life of Dennis Rodman and stuff like\nthat and people start to gravitate that\naround the world we live around the\nworld\nand now today\nthat's what we talked about\nwhat is the big things you want to do in\nyour life I've done it I've created an\nimage in the in the Sports World the\npeople of praising\nthe tattoos and dependency to say what\nyou want to say but don't hurt nobody I\ndo everything in the world in sports\nI'm not everything in the world is\nsports people didn't think I can do\nbut everybody's taking credit for which\nI don't care\nI don't care I don't care who takes\ncredit I know everybody's happy and I do\nget pissed off at professional athletes\nso are you guys going to stand I'm gonna\nsay\nyou make all lists down money\nand you\nyou make it 40 50 60 million dollars\nbut for some of the reason you ain't\nhelping a sold around the world\nbut I'm saying this to every Athlete on\nthe planet and I wrote a book and said\nsomething this whole thing I'm just\nsaying now I said what's what's up\nwhat's one thing about uh the playing\nsports in the NBA playing basketball in\nBSF\nfifty percent is money at 50 sex\njust like that\nand it's true\nso nothing bad about that\nyou know that's what life is all about\nespecially in Sports World\nwell for athletes in the world\nwe're not I mean the Super Bowl Super\nBowl All-Star Game stuff like that I get\nmad man at this stuff I don't care what\nthey how much money they make but it's\nnot like they're trying to give back\nlike Ron Kobe stuff like that they give\nus a lot of people they killed back but\npeople that's making all that money man\n40 50 million dollars a year\nto hear you complain\ncomplain about what\ncomplain about what oh I don't I don't I\ndon't want to be with this person I\ndon't want to play with this team I\ndon't give a damn because you forgot you\nforgot who you were now you forgot who\nyou were now\nyou know you you came in here when you\ngot drafted anyone got drafted used all\nemotional [ __ ] I'm hung up in the NBA\nnow you're making 50 million dollars oh\nscrew this guy really wait a minute what\nhappened to that guy\nyou know we'll have to always do that\nthat uh that human side of us what\nhappened to it it's gone\nthat's why I said the world life is\nmoving so damn fast have you ever said\nthis to some of the players or people\nthat you know they don't hear it now\nyeah\ndo you like it or not I don't care yeah\nthese are things when you go around the\nboard and try to explain to people that\nlive out there\nand and understand life in general just\nlife in general you know so your soul is\nprobably a great place after 14 years\nyour soul is probably right there with a\nlot of people needs to be you know at 50\nyears old going 59 I need to try to get\non that path to try to have some type of\nhappy fine line about Dennis Rodman\nI've been going around the board but\ntalk about this person these people\nthese people how I am stuff like that\nbut I'm seeing I'm trying to reach\ntrying to find which door is open for me\nto go in to say hey\nyou know yeah so you know but for me to\nkeep talking about it over and over you\nknow I mean I just can't it's kind of\nhard sometimes because you know I'm\nsitting here you know repeating myself\nabout the same thing and it's like but\nif they're saying but it's like but but\nyou understand people understand what\nI'm saying absolutely people understand\nwhat I'm saying I mean if I'm completely\nhonest that's why I said to you before\nabout it\nwhen I'm speaking to you because you're\nso unfiltered\nwhen I'm hearing you talk that's kind of\nlike how everyone's mind sounds like our\nmind repeats stuff every single day our\nmind keeps the same story going on like\na broken record flight but it's like\nthat's how you process stuff he brought\nthis stuff when we sit with it when we\nthink about it when we steal ourselves\nwe process it when we let it most of us\ngo I can't think the same thought again\nbecause then I'm crazy I can't say the\nsame thing again because then I'm crazy\nbut actually you're not because that's\nactually what it takes to really process\nsomething so I respect that I appreciate\nthat and I have nothing against that but\nit's not against that yeah I'm the same\nif you if you want to take the frost the\nword process break that down\nbrief process down for me the process of\nthinking no I want to just want to play\nthis breakdown of the word process\nthe word process for me is a series of\nsteps that help you get from A to B\nwhatever that A or B is for you so for\nme a thinking process is a process that\nhelps you step by step break down your\nthoughts so that you're happy with your\nthoughts at the end of them or you have\na thought that is useful and insightful\nthat you can do something with that's\nwhat a process is to me personally for\nyou right yeah\nas a 10 year old the same thing\nI think they'll say something different\nno no no no no it was as a 10 year old\njust one day just has to tell you can\nyou break down a process yeah the first\nthing you're gonna do is get on the\nphone oh process\nthey're gonna sit there and then break\nthat down real quick to you they're\ngonna say oh like a process oh look\nthere it is okay great it's a processing\nsomebody you know I'm gonna say well\nokay great so basically that's that's\nyour process but a 10 year old say man\nthey got different process right yeah\nand stuff like that but you didn't get\nthat at home you said oh you break down\nI promise this is my thought process\nit's just I'll acknowledge you real\nquick yeah\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo If you enjoyed it here's another\none I think you'll love to say okay it's\nokay to fail because you're going to be\nloved no matter what I had to look at it\nfrom a long term because I wasn't going\nto give up on the game right so I had to\nsay okay this year I'm gonna get better\nat that next
