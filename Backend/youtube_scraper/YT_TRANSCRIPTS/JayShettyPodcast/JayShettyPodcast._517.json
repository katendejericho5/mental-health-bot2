    "transcript": "and so i remember at the age of nine a\nteacher pointing to me talking to\nanother adult saying that's the boy with\na broken brain parents have to be very\ncareful with the words they use because\nyour external words become a child's\ninternal words but your journey actually\nstarted off differently right you\nactually struggled at school i did when\npeople see me on stages that we've\nshared together or on video they'll see\nme do these mental feats right memorize\ni'll have 100 people stand up and\nmemorize their names or\nyou know 100 names or 100 numbers or 100\nwords forwards and backwards but i\nalways tell people i don't do this to\nimpress you i do this more to express to\nyou what's possible because the truth is\nevery single person who's listening\ntoday can do that and so much so much\nmore i mean we discovered more about you\nknow the human brain you know this more\nin the past 10 years than the previous\nthousand years combined and we're\ngrossly we've found as we're grossly\nunderestimating our own capabilities and\nour own superpowers as you were and i\nreally do i love your work because i\nfeel like in this age of information\nwe're drowning in data we're drowning in\ninformation but we're starving for real\nwisdom\nand so that's why i really appreciate it\nbut you know as you know i grew up with\nlearning difficulties some people are\nsurprised to hear at the age of five i\nhad a bad accident had trauma brain\ninjury and i had these learning\nchallenges if you were you know i had\nbad focus i had no memory to speak of i\ndidn't teachers would have to repeat\nthemselves four five six times and then\ni would i wouldn't get it i would\npretend to understand and i don't know\nif anyone could relate to that but i had\nthis like imposter syndrome when i was a\nchild\nand um\nand it took me an extra few years to\njust learn how to read i remember i\ndon't talk about this but in school in\nelementary school\nall my friends they they got invited to\nbe part of this mask program because i\nalways played with all the dungeons and\ndragons and comic book geeks and the\nonly difference with them and me is i\ndidn't have the grades they're really\nreally smart right and um\nbut they um there was this group called\nmasp and maths stands for more able\nstudent program\nand uh it was me and my friend joey we\nweren't invited in this program so we\ncreated our own little group our own\nclique we called it lasp and we were the\nless able student program\nand um and so i remember at the age of\nnine a teacher pointing to me talking to\nanother adult saying that's the boy with\nthe broken brain\nand that was my label and\nand anyone who has a child or anyone who\nwas a child at one point in their life\nparents have to be very careful with the\nwords they use because your external\nwords become a child's internal words\nand that became my internal talk every\ntime i wasn't picked for the soccer team\nevery time i did badly on a quiz and a\ntest which was all the time i always\nsaid oh it's because i have the broken\nbrain and that became my my internal\nconversation and um i always tell people\nif you fight for your limitations you\nget to keep them if you argue for those\nlimits they're yours and i and i had\nthat all through school i had such a bad\nfear of i was painfully shy not just\nintroverted but shy\nbecause when you uh when you feel like\nyou're broken you don't feel like you\nhaven't anything to add in terms of\nvalues uh i didn't have a lot of friends\ni i would just watch people and study\nthem and just wonder why was this person\nyou know so successful at school or have\nyou know so popular or picked for all\nthese teams and um maybe it's painfully\nshy i would actually i remember i don't\ntalk about this a lot but i i\nmy um they pulled my parents in my\nenglish class in high school and\ni was failing and it was like the\nteacher said okay i'll give you one\nchance you need this extra credit report\nand um you know and it was on einstein\nand da vinci and you know and i didn't\nknow anything about them but this is\nwhat's gonna allow you to pass and i was\nso excited because i put all my energy\nin there for months and i did this book\nreport and that and i've never put all\nof my talent and time and focus into one\nproject before\nand uh the day i had to turn it in i had\nit professionally bound i mean it was\nlike so proud of it because i've never\nbeen good at anything and um\nand at the end of class the teacher's\nlike i have a surprise for everybody jim\ncome up in front of the class and tell\neveryone about einstein and da vinci and\ni uh i was so scared i didn't realize i\nhad to give a talk like a book report on\nthis\nso um i i said i lied i said i didn't do\nit\nand after three months of pouring my\nheart and everything into it\nmy potential if you will um i just uh i\nlied i said and do it because i was so\nfearful of keep getting in front of a\ngroup of people i know fear public\nspeaking is a big deal for a lot of\npeople and after you could look at the\nteacher's face she was so disappointed\nand i was disappointed myself also and\nbut after the class left i remember\ntaking it out of my backpack and\nthrowing it into the trash and i felt\nlike when i did that i was also throwing\naway\nsomething else like maybe my dreams if\nyou will but at the age of 18 i um i\nthought i could turn it all around i was\nuh lucky enough to get into a college\nuniversity i wanted to make a fresh\nstart and show my family show the world\nfor myself i could do it and i did worse\nand\nand at that time i just i just doubled\ndown and and i was just ready to quit\nand the friends like hey why don't you\nget some perspective before you tell\nyour family you're quitting school come\nvisit my family this weekend i'm going\nhome and i did and the family was pretty\nwell off and and happy and successful if\nyou will um and the father walks me\naround his property and says jim you\nknow how school and i just that's the\nworst question you could ask me and i\njust start bawling\nand i just i was like i tell my whole\nstory about the broken brain he's like\njim why are you in school what do you\nwant to be what do you want to do what\ndo you want to have what do you want to\nshare in the world\nand uh and i honestly don't have any\nclue because it's funny when you don't\nask yourself that question you don't\nhave answers you know those were\nconversations i had growing up\nand i um\nand i and i go to answer him and he\ntakes out he says stop he takes a piece\nof paper out of his back pocket makes me\nwrite it down and you know how important\nit is to write and reflect i've never\ndid that before but when i was done i\nhad this bucket list of all the things\nthat i want to accomplish and when i was\ni started folding the sheets and he\ngrabbed it out of my hand and he starts\nreading it and i'm freaking out because\ni wasn't expecting him to look at my\ndeepest dreams\nand when he's done he's like jim you're\nthis close to everything on that list\nand he spreads his fingers about a foot\napart and i was like no way give me 10\nlifetimes i'm not going to crack that\nlist and he takes his fingers and he\nputs them to the side of my head meaning\nwhat's in between is really the answer\nthe key the bridge if you will which was\nmy brain and he walks me into a room of\nhis home and to a room i've never seen\nyou would love it it's wall to wall\nsailing the floor covered in books and\ni'm phobic of books right i mean i'm\njust not a good reader never finished a\nbook in my life\nyeah and this is like maybe now i read i\nread a book a day and i'm so they're my\nbest friends\nbut um but they're like you know a lot\nof people afraid of snakes it's like\nbeing room full of snakes but makes it\nworse he starts grabbing snakes and\nhanding them to me and i start looking\nat these titles and their classics\nthere's these incredible biographies of\nmen and women in history and some very\nearly personal growth books like norman\nvincent peale the power of positive\nthinking dale carnegie i mean napoleon\nhill all the classics right he's like\njim i want you to read one book a week\nand i was like no way i don't know i'm\nfighting for my limitations i can't do\nthat i have so much schoolwork and he's\nlooked at me like jim don't let school\nget in the way of your education and i\ndidn't realize this was a mark twain\nquote at the times like over 25 years\nago and i was like that's really\ninsightful but i still i can't commit to\nthis if i'm gonna commit to it i'm gonna\ndo it and very smart man he reaches into\nhis pocket and he still has my bucket\nlist and he starts reading every single\none of my dreams out loud and i don't\nknow what it was jay just hearing\nimagine you're this insecure 18 year old\nkid\nand you start hearing your deepest\ndreams you've never articulated out loud\nyourself much less you hear from another\nman's voice encant it out into the\nuniverse and it messed with my mind and\nmy heart something fierce and honestly a\nlot of the half that list were things i\nwanted to do for my family you know my\nparents immigrated here from asia we i\nmean typical story we lived in the back\nof a laundry mat didn't speak the\nlanguage didn't have any money\neducation any of that and i just i\nwanted to do stuff for my family that\nthey all because of all their sacrifice\nand with that leverage and\nunderstanding the importance of of of\ndrive and motivation to get to do i'm\nvery curious what motivates people to do\nthings you know to take i don't believe\nknowledge is power at all you know i you\nknow all the\nits potential as a potential be power\nright you know but all the podcasts\nonline programs coaching seminars none\nof it works unless we work it\nand\nand so\nwith that motivation i agree to read one\nbook a week so fast forward i'm back at\nschool and i'm sitting at my desk i have\na pile of books i have to read for\nmidterms and i have a pile of books that\ni promise to read and i couldn't even do\none pile of books so what do i do i\nsacrifice i don't eat i don't sleep i\ndon't work out so i spend time with\nfriends i don't i live in the library\nand i just it's not very sustainable and\ni end up passing out one night at a\nsheer exhaustion i fall down a flight of\nstairs in the library hit my head again\nand then i wake up two days later in the\nhospital and at this point i've lost all\ni was i lost i was down 117 pounds the\nscariest point in my life ever i thought\ni died and you know when you have a\nnear-death experience\ni mean it makes you think about like\ndeep about who you are and you know i\nthink a lot of people have you know\nhonestly near life experiences where\nthey're not they're not you know\nstepping into that place but um made me\nask a new question you know why am i\nhere why am i struggling like this and i\ndidn't have any answers just like man i\nhave a really slow brain and then at\nthat time you know the nurse came in\nwith a mug of tea and it had a picture\nof the same one the person i did the\nbook report on it's albert einstein\nand it was like and there's a quote on\nthere i felt like he was speaking to me\nit said the same level of thinking\nthat's created your problem won't solve\nyour problem and i was like well what's\nmy problem i was like i have a very slow\nlearner i'm a very slow brain it's like\nwell how do i think differently about it\nwell maybe i can learn how to learn\nfaster maybe i can learn how to have a\nfaster brain and i put my studies aside\nand i just start studying learning you\nknow learning how to learn i think it's\na superpower if there's one skill to\nmaster in the 21st century you know with\nall this change that's going on rapid\nchange it's the only constant is just\nhow do you learn it and absorb it and\nthink differently and apply it and so i\nstarted studying neuroscience adult\nlearning theory multiple intelligences\num anything i get my hands on mnemonics\nspeed reading everything and then about\nsix days into it light switch went on\nand i started to understand things for\nthe very first time i mean it was just\nlike and i remember i never talked about\nthis but i i remember the time the\nmoment it happened it was um we were in\nclass it was about 300 people in a\nlecture center and back then there were\nthese um at least overhead projectors\nright and with these you know heads like\nwith these with these like yeah he's\npulling like\nand um and\nthen professor put something on the\noverhead projector and you know a few\nseconds into it i just start laughing\nand i'm so quiet i'm the quiet one in\nclass i do everything to not like if i\nwas to have one superpower back in\nschool it was\ninvisibility like i didn't want to be\nseen i didn't i mean i wanted to be seen\ni want to be heard but i didn't want\nthis spotlight you know and so because\nyou know when you're broken and you feel\nlike you're not enough you don't want\nthat attention but i start laughing out\nloud really loud and everyone turns\naround and looks at me and i'm freaking\nout like oh my goodness i didn't realize\nit and then about 30 seconds into it\nother people started laughing there was\nthis ripple effect and we were laughing\nat what was on the screen but i had just\nread it and learned it really fast right\nat that moment and i didn't realize it\nat the time\noh wow but with my grades when my grades\nimproved my life improved and here's the\nthing when\nmy inspiration really was my desperation\nyou know how i ended up on this path all\nthose years ago was i couldn't help but\nhelp other people right you talk about\nyour passion and my passion became\nlearning but my purpose also became\nteaching you know sharing with other\npeople because i felt really\nupset that i wasn't taught this back in\nschool and i had to go through all that\nsuffering and struggling every single\nday you know sometimes crying myself to\nsleep not feeling i was enough\nand so i started helping other\nindividuals\nand\ni don't share this story um very often\nbut\num i didn't know how to help other\nindividuals so i was like okay i'm gonna\ni was walking and like doing this\nmeditation around campus and i noticed\nthere was this classroom that wasn't\nbeing used late at night on a thursday\nnight and i was like okay um next week\ni'm gonna put five or ten people in that\nroom teach them for free and then maybe\nafterwards one or two of them want to be\nmy students and i could tutor them\nand then um\ni go back to my dorm room and i take out\na piece of paper and i write free speed\nreading memory tips get better grades\nand less time thursday 7 p.m\nand the next morning this is like my\nfirst like you know opportunity to share\nthis next morning i make some\nphotocopies and on the way to class just\nput some around the campus not a lot um\nand then fast forward to thursday seven\no'clock i go i'm walking around the\nhallway i'm just hoping five people\nshowed up were interested in this and i\nturned the corner and there's a crowd of\npeople outside the door\nand i'm freaking out\nbecause i was like honestly i was like\noh i hope whatever's going on and soon\nso i could do my thing\nand i go up to there and there's this\ncrowd of people and i can't even see\ninside because this big tall guy i was\nlike tapping on like what's going on\ninside he's like there's a speed reading\nclass and i'm honest to god jay i was\nlike wow what a coincidence\nwhat are the odds there's another\nspeeder in class the same room the same\nnight the same time and i pushed my way\nin and there's rooms full of people\npeople standing in the back but nobody's\nteaching and it takes my slow brain all\nthat time to realize why they're all\nthere and i do a head count and instead\nof five or ten people there's 110 people\nnow keep in mind i'm phobic of public\nspeaking i'm 18 years old i look you\nknow like really young i'm wearing\nt-shirt shorts i have nothing prepared\nto talk about\nand there's teaching assistants in there\ngraduate students\nand um\nmy heart's beating on my chest i can't\neven breathe and so i leave\nbecause i can't i can't do it and uh\ni will go to this um the fountain and\ni've always meditated in my life it's\njust something more my nature because i\nspent so much time in my imagination to\nmyself\num as as an introvert and um and i when\ni was meditating i heard this voice\ninside my head and it's my mom's and she\nsays i won't tell you exactly what she\nsays but essentially it's like 100\npeople came out because you promised to\nhelp them and you're disappointing them\nyou're disappointing me\nand\ni'm doing this walking meditation back\nto the my dorm room and i stop and i\ntake one step back to the classroom and\nisn't it interesting that one step in\nanother direction can completely change\nyour destination\nor your destiny right absolutely and i\ngo back and honestly as a memory expert\nit's embarrassing i don't even remember\nwhat i talked about i mean i don't know\nhow you are on stage but sometimes it\njust flows yeah it just flows through\nthe right days yeah and uh i remember\nyou know on stage with wayne dyer he's\nlike he never preps he just yeah he does\npray you know praise his servant just\ncomes right through and\nbut after two hours i come out of this\ntrance and i was just like okay but i\nremember when i said then consciously i\nwas like oh i don't know if i can help\neverybody here but it does take about 10\nhours for me to teach you some of the\nthings that i'm doing two hours a week\nyou know um you know over the next five\nweeks and i just said oh you know i get\nthirty dollars an hour to teach us\nbecause that's what i got um teaching\ntennis back in high school if you're\ninterested i'll be in the student center\ntomorrow at noon and then i i swear to\nej 100 people just get up and they leave\nand then no no interaction at all and i\nam i feel two things number one i feel\ncompletely confused i'm just like what\nhappened did everyone just not did i\njust what did i say while this was going\non\nand did i just was a complete idiot and\nthen the other feeling i had was\ncomplete exhaustion because you know\nwhen you get yourself to do something\nyou never thought you could do like you\nknow whether it's public speaking or or\ntalking to that person that you're\nalways you know you're attracted to or\nstarting that business or jumping out of\nthat plane or whatever i was completely\nexhausted mentally emotionally\nphysically and i end up falling asleep\non the floor on that carpet it was the\nbest sleep of my life i've ever had to\nthis day and i get woken up by the class\ncoming in the next morning and i mean\nscary you're like drooling on yourself\nlooking up and seeing like you know\nclass students and i run back to my dorm\nroom and i um i shower i go to breakfast\ngo to class 12 o'clock comes i promised\npeople i'd be in the student center i\nrun there and i just hope one person is\nthere and when i get there the entire\nthat crowd is this is there showed up\nand um at the end of\nin about an hour or two\n71 of the 100 kids signed up for a\nprogram that didn't even exist\nand i was at a price point of a 300\num because i didn't even do the math\nbecause i wasn't doing it for the money\nit was like 100 you know 71 times 300\ndollars i didn't realize kids could go\nto the atm machine and take out 300\nbecause i didn't i didn't have an atm\ncard i didn't have that guy i never saw\n300 in my life and so\ni so now i'm not even 19 years old and i\nhave 21 000 cash\nin my backpack\nand and i go back to um my mentor\nhis wisdom saying don't let school get\nin the way of your education and i feed\nmy body because i lost all that weight\nbut mostly i use that to invest in\nfeeding my mind and i buy every book\nevery audio cassette at that time\nthere's no\neverything was it wasn't digital i\ntraveled the world\nto learn my craft and the reason why i\ndo this today\nis because one of those students 71\nyoung adults she was a freshman she read\n30 books in 30 days\ni mean can you imagine going online and\npicking up 30 books you know and\njust absorbing not skim it but just\nreally understood it and i wanted to\nfind out not how but why going back to\nmotivation and i found out that her\nmother was dying of terminal cancer and\nwas only given to 60 days to live two\nmonths to live doctors\num\nand so i wished her well prayers six\nmonths later i get a call from this\nyoung lady she's crying and crying\ncrying i can't get a word out of her and\ni find out they're tears of joy that her\nmother not only survive but is really\ngetting better doctors don't know how or\nwhy they called in a miracle but her\nmother attributed 100 to the great\nadvice she got from her daughter who\nlearned her from all these books\nand that's where i realized at that\nmoment if knowledge is power learning is\nyour super power and it's a superpower\nwe all have inside of us and i devoted\nmy life to showing people how to unlock\nand unleash it\nwow um\nso i get i i get a little choked up\nthinking about about that but that\nthat's my mission the boy with a broken\nbrain i just wanna no brain left behind\nyeah yeah i wanna show people really\nwhat they're capable of and then they\nthat we all have genius inside of us\nthat it's not how smart you are it's\nreally how are you smart\nand um and we've had this conversation\nyou know with\nand that's what i feel like people are\nlooking for that\nyeah\ni love that man that's yeah listening to\nit\nin full like that and i'm sure there's\nso much more but thank you so much for\nsharing those stories as well they're\nreally powerful and\nthe the genuineness and sincerity with\nwhich you're doing this just comes\nacross\nreally naturally i can feel the energy\nit's not even a\nand i already knew that about you but\nit's not about anything else apart from\nno brain left behind i love that\nbut yeah let's let's look at that a bit\nmore and i and i want to unpack parts of\nthat story because i think that a lot of\npeople are listening right now while\nwatching right now\nand they're saying\njim i feel exactly how you felt yeah\nright i was the same i never felt i\nliked reading growing up because we only\nread fiction books at school and i've\nnever been a fan of\ncertain types of fiction that we were\nexposed to at school okay and when i got\nexposed to non-fiction when i was 14 i\ngot fascinated with reading and i just\nkept reading and reading and reading\nbecause i loved reading about real\npeople and real stories and at the same\ntime i've been fascinated by superheroes\nor magic but we never read books like\nthat fiction books like that at school\nright right so i also had challenges\nwith what i loved and what i didn't\nloved and what i believed so our biggest\nchallenges you know this i know this are\naround our beliefs are around what we\nbelieve is possible right you had a\neight from eight years old to 18\nthat seems like a really tough time in\nyour life\nin terms of your projections of yourself\nyour beliefs about yourself\nwhat is your advice now to people who\nhave those limiting beliefs how do they\nstart that journey or that process yeah\nof opening up their minds or whatever\nyou feel is right for them i i really do\nfeel this is one of the most important\nconversations people could be having\nright now\nbecause to create any kind of results in\nour life we need to behave a certain way\nbut in order to do a behavior we need a\nbelief that enables that to happen\nand um\ni think the nature of a lot of the work\nthat we do is is about transcending\nis when i say we i mean everyone who's\nhere in this community it's about\ntranscend it's about ending the trance\nending this mass hypnosis\nthrough marketing through media that\nsays\nthat you're broken you know exactly what\ni experienced as a child that you need\nto be that you need to be fixed that\nthere is something wrong with you and i\nfeel like\nyou know all this fear of not\nfeeling like you're enough is is at the\nroot of a lot of challenges because in\nin actuality we're not so much a\nthermometer\nreacting to the environment all the time\nas we are thermostat and our beliefs are\nkind of like the temperature we're\nsetting and when we set a goal or a\nbelief or a vision for something you\nknow the environment changes but i think\npeople make them kind of money that they\nbelieve that they are worth that they\nare in the kind of relationship or lack\nthereof\nmaybe because of of what they believe\nabout you know relationships or they\nbelieve about who they are and how\nvaluable that they they are or\nmaybe even the state of health right\nthat power of a belief or placebo that\npeople could change the level of health\njust by having a certain thought\nand and we know that there's a biology\nto belief also as well and so what i i\nknow\nin in my experience of having students\nin over 180 countries working with\nchildren with the most severe learning\nchallenges to adults you know i don't i\nknow i never talk about this my my\ngrandmother died of alzheimer's you know\nand so that affects your beliefs when\nyou're a child along with my brain\ninjury labeled the broken brain i\nremember going to see my grandmother and\nshe would call me by the my by my\nbrother's name you know i would remember\ntalking my grandmother about something\nand then two minutes later we're talking\nabout the same exact thing and people\nwho know\nyou know who have had this experience\nand who doesn't know somebody who has\nyou know who has been affected by\ndementia or alzheimer's\nyou just it's like you lose your mind\nyou lose part of you know who you are\nyour identity\nand so all those things affect your\nbelief about what is possible so the\nreason why i do these demonstrations on\nstage is to really shake up what people\nfeel is possible\nbut i know and this is what research\nshows that regardless of your age your\nbackground your career your education\nyour financial situation your gender\nyour history your iq\nonly about a one-third according to\nresearch is pretty your intellect your\npotential your memory is predetermined\nby genetics and biology but two-thirds\nis in your control now some people will\nsay 100 your control you know\nepigenetics and your beliefs the power\nof it but at research you know\ntraditionally saying two-thirds is you\nhave more influence than you think that\nit's not two-thirds is good enough\nexactly that it's not it's not it's you\nknow the whole mindset between a fixed\nmindset and a growth mindset is that um\nthat it's not set like your iq when you\ntake an iq test when you're a child it's\nnot what you're set for life it's not\nfixed like your shoe size\nand uh plus you know the beliefs around\niq people feel like that that a\nstandardized test could this is your\npotential i mean that's ludicrous right\nthat that something like that is set and\nso i think when we're talking about\nbeliefs\nall of it is has to do with our our\nculture and what's our influence is what\nwe're imprinted on early on\nand i also believe part of it has to do\nwith our self-talk i remember i was\npreparing to to run a marathon you know\nwith a name like quick and people talk\nabout my name i i didn't change my name\nto do what i do it's my father's name my\ngrandfather's name that's so cool you\nknow and so it's um it's something that\ni was born with and and i would say that\num when i was running this marathon i\nread this chapter in a book on the\npsychology of it and it said this word\nfor word because i'm a memory expert it\nsaid your brain is like a super computer\nand your self-talk is a program it will\nrun so if you tell yourself you're not\ngood at remembering names you will not\nremember the name the next person you\nmeet because you program your super\ncomputer not to\nand um you know i always tell people\nyour mind is always eavesdropping on\nyour self-talk it's always listening you\nknow this if if people knew how powerful\ntheir minds were like right now when\npeople are listening to this you have\nhundreds of millions of neurons firing\noff you know and they say a person's\nmind one stretch by new idea never\nregains its original dimensions right\nneurogenesis neuroplasticity we're\nalways you know thoughts that you know\num brain cells that wire together they\nthey fire together they wire together\nthese thoughts are things and so i would\nsay if you knew how powerful your minds\nreally were you wouldn't have a thought\nor say something you didn't want to be\ntrue and now that's not to say you have\none negative thought and it ruins your\nlife right any more than eating a donut\nruined your life you know you know your\nbody but it's the habit of doing it\nright we talk about habits like\nmeditation and working out and eating\nright and gratitude\nbut you know what about the habits of\nour feelings the emotional habits that\nwe have what about the habits of our\nthoughts that were the the things we're\nsaying to ourselves all the time inside\nlike i have a friend like you know i\nfeel like we ask these things all the\ntime we have these thoughts that we have\nto be conscious of in order to change\nbut um and we have certain thoughts that\nare just constant like um like like\nthese dominant ones and i remember\nwhen a friend of mine went through this\nexercise and her primary thought is how\ndo i get people to like me\nlike can you imagine if you ask yourself\nhundreds of times a day consciously or\nunconsciously how do i get people like\nme like jay you don't know this person\nyou don't know her age her background\nher her career any her her financial you\ndon't know anything about her but you\nknow everything about her\nright if somebody's asking them\nconstantly like themselves you know how\ndo i get people to like me you i mean\nwhat's that person like like what's\ntheir personality like\nyou know they're always\ntheir people pleaser you know their\npersonality is changing depending on who\nthey're spending time with they're a\nmartyr they're always looking to serve\nand they're and and you know all that\nstuff because you know one of their\nthoughts because thoughts are things and\nso i would ask people to evaluate you\nknow your beliefs your self-talk because\nit runs these programs and it's so once\nyou're conscious of it you can make\nchanges like you know i don't have a\ngreat memory yet you know simple as a\nsimple three-letter word at the end of a\nsentence changes everything because\nwords have power\nyou know there's even this little pet\npeeve i have is that you know people\ntalk about nice and they talk about kind\nbut those are two completely different\nthings like night and day you know in\nterms of what motivates somebody who's\nnice\na person who's nice could treat\nsomebody who's going through a bad day\nor a homeless person they could treat\nthem nice but somebody who's kind is\ndifferent they invest their their time\nthere there's caring there's work you\nknow nice person does things when they\nhave the time a kind person does they\nmake the time to do things right a nice\nperson is more it's a beautiful\ndistinction externally motivated\nmeaning somebody's nice usually\nsometimes they placate they don't want\nto create waves they don't want to upset\nanybody um because they don't want to\nlook bad um and but somebody who's kind\nthey're more internally motivated and\nthey um they they do what's right\nbecause out of caring and compassion\nbecause you know a nice person might not\nrecognize the the the broccoli in your\nteeth because they would they don't want\nto create anything but but a kind person\nbe like hey you got something there or\nthey'll call you on your stuff and\nthey'll tell you what you need to hear\nbecause they'll speak the truth because\nthey're not trying to get validation\nyou know that's a beautiful and so like\nlittle distinctions in words even things\nlike you know people say all the time i\ngotta pick up the kids i i gotta journal\ntoday i gotta meditate but you change\nthat word got to get\noh my goodness i get to pick up my kids\ni get to work out today i get to eat\nright i get to meditate so you know\nthose those words affect how we think\nand they affect our core beliefs and so\ni would say one of the fundamental\nplaces that is changing those that\nbelief is to really be conscious of your\nyour thoughts especially those automatic\nthey call them ants automatic negative\nthoughts right you want to want to be\nable to squash those ants because it's\ndefinitely good for your brain i love\nthat yeah i know and and i couldn't\nagree with you more i couldn't agree\nwith you more it's\nit's it's incredible how simple it\nsounds and seems\neven though it has such a profound\neffect on us\nright like it has such a profound effect\nlike changing adding that three-letter\nword yet right right just that small\nthing can have such a huge impact but we\nneed to give this attention in our lives\nbecause otherwise that negative\nself-talk has been playing for so long\nthat it could just keep going on in the\nbackground right and we don't even know\nwhere it came from you know even when\nwe're children so we're not and i feel\nlike that in order to be able to make\nany kind of change you have to recognize\nwhat it is otherwise\nthen\nwe're at the effect of it then we're\ngoing back to being a thermometer if you\nwere and that would that would be the\nbig challenge but then you would call it\nfate when it's really you know you get\nthis awareness having those distinctions\nabsolutely and we have to think about\nwhat we also want to invest in learning\ntoo of course because i feel like\nthe pressure of i remember\nyou've just made me think of this when\nyou talk about your school experience\nevery year in my high school so\nsecondary school we call it secondary\nschool you call it high school\nwe used to get\na ranked for every subject out of 180\nstudents\nand it would be put up in front of\neveryone\nso you'd be ranked against everyone in\nyour peer group out of 180 in every\nsingle subject in school so math english\nbiology chemistry physics art design\nenglish history geography politics\nwhatever it was and then you'd be able\nto see where you were and i remember\nthere were certain subjects like\nphilosophy art and design economics\nwhere i would always perform well i'd\nalways probably be in the top\nfive three and one more often than not\nin those subjects and then subjects like\nmath and english i was always pretty\nhigh but things like math and geography\ni was always kind of in the middle or\nmaybe towards the\nlatter half and\nand it's interesting how that we amplify\nthat which we're not good at that's\ninteresting right we it's like saying\nfor example you're given the broccoli\nexample but imagine you dress up to go\nout to an event right everyone at the\nevent was just like oh jim i love your\nshoes i love that t-shirt i love the\nslogan and then you get one person who\ncomes up to you and says jim that slogan\nmakes no sense\nand we go home\namplifying that one person who said that\nmakes no sense why does that happen and\nhow do we stop that happening how do we\nstop the mind from doing that because i\nactually think more people receive\ncompliments they receive encouragement\nthey're receiving support but actually\nour mind tricks us into amplifying and\nmagnifying yeah the one negative piece\nit's like in your comments i'm sure you\nsee it yeah when you're scrolling\nthrough your comments your mind\nnaturally goes to the critical ones\nright right and we see so many social\nmedia people so many influencers so many\nmodels actors actresses\nwho get consumed by the negative\ncomments on their feeds yeah so how do\nwe stop that from happening yeah i'm\nreally concerned about this digital age\ni feel like it serves and enabled i love\nknowing what you're up to and it's great\nfor staying up to date with with friends\nand family and learning and inspiration\nand i love that and you know we talk\nabout superheroes and superpowers but\nthey're also\nthere could be like this super villain\nin that this digital age we have digital\noverload too much to learn too little\ntime we have digital distraction i mean\ngoodness i mean when we pick up our\nphone every dopamine\nfix from every like share comment\neverything and then you have digital\ndementia relying on your phone and\nyou just does everything for you so you\ndon't have to use your your mental\nfaculties as much so you know we're so\ndependent on that but then there's this\ndigital depression that's coming from\ncomparison right you see sometimes we\nsee all the good stuff and we focus on\nthe bad or we see everything highlight\ncurated filtered life of everyone's\nincredible life and know that you know\nyou don't see this struggle sometimes as\nmuch and that's why i can appreciate\nyour work because it brings it's it's\nit's it's full and it's it's rich\num\nfull spectrum and i think that one of\nthe challenges is part of your brain\nthrough survival you have this reticular\nactivating system that because right now\nthere's two billion stimuli we could be\nfocusing on i mean you would go\nstargrave mad if if you did right the\nflood of information that noise if you\nwill so we could only pay attention to a\nsmall bite of information you know at\nharvard george miller says it's seven\nplus or minus two you know five to nine\nbits you could consciously be aware and\nso what do we become aware of and you're\nright a lot of that stuff is the the the\ncriticisms it's the uh it's the people\nit's a negative stuff that you know you\nwant to protect yourself from because\nyou it's feeding that fear that we're\nnot we're not enough right and then you\nstart asking those kind of questions\nbecause you can delete so primarily your\nbrain people don't realize it's a\ndeletion device is trying to\nget keep things out right so it deletes\nit distorts and it generalizes and all\nof a sudden you see one bad comment out\nof a flood of maybe 100 people rooting\nfor you and then you obsess about that\none thing and then you generalize like\nthat's the real thing and it's kind of\ninteresting when it comes to your\nhappiness because i feel like people who\nare generally happy will focus you know\non the glass half full as opposed\nbecause at any moment there are negative\nwe could always be sad and depressed and\nnot feel good enough because there's\nplenty of stuff to focus on you know but\njust also right now they're you know\npeople getting married they're people\nhaving you know babies they're people\nwho are learning new things and starting\nnew careers so it really is a matter of\nfocus and i and i think you know i i did\nthis podcast episode where i was in the\npower plant and i tell this story about\na power plant that's very active and one\nday it just shuts down and the middle of\nnowhere just shuts down and the\nemployees are running around they're\nthey're frantic with their heads cut off\nand finally operations manager after\nthree hours says okay we gotta get some\noutside help they call local technician\ntechnicians like you're lucky i'm right\naround the corner technician shows up\nand\nhe surveys the power plant for about a\nfew minutes and there's full beams\neverywhere he goes to one specific beam\nand on there there's all these\nelectrical boxes he goes to one specific\nelectrical box he puts a big x with the\nmagic marker on it he opens it up and\nall these bolts and wires and screws he\ngoes to one specific screw and he turns\nit not a quarter of an inch and all of a\nsudden the whole power plant lights up\nagain and an operations manager like\nthank you saved our our business you\nsaved the day how much do i owe you he's\nlike that will be ten thousand dollars\nand he's like what you were here for\nfive minutes all you did was turn the\nscrew he's like you know how can you\neven justify that he's like give me an\nitemized bill he's like no problem\ntechnician reaches his back pocket takes\na piece of paper scribbles on it tears\noff the sheet gives it to him and he was\nlike i understand he goes to his desk\nwrites a check for ten thousand dollars\nhands it to the man and he basically and\nyou look at the\nthe the invoice if you will and it says\nturning screw one dollar knowing what\nscrew to turn nine thousand nine hundred\nninety nine dollars and and the lesson\nis for people who are listening is not\nthat you have a screw loose\nis that little things can make a big\ndifference right it's like that it's a\nwhat i call a focal point or a force\nmultiplier you know where same amount of\ninput multiple output or the lead domino\nif you will that could hit a lot of\ndominoes and the same thing applies to\nour our focus and our thoughts and i\nwould say at the core level people are\ntrying to change their behavior at all\ntimes right they want to change they\nwant to stop smoking they want to\nmeditate they want to go for walks or do\nsomething with their kids but you\nstruggle and willpower only goes so far\nright but above that level is this level\nof capability you know and that's why\nyou know people like you say doing the\ndeep work because people avoid the deep\nwork but if you don't do that you know\nif you procrastinate put things off and\nyou just do the easy things life is hard\nwe know that but if you do the hard\nthings\nlife becomes easier right so the\ncapability so check do you have the the\nskill set on how to be able to do that\nbehavior of stop smoking or meditation\nand such because there's a there's a\ncompetence confidence loop that the more\ncompetent you get capable the more\nconfident you get totally and then\nyou're more likely to do it and get\nbetter so it's positive momentum but the\nlevel above that is the conversation\nwe've been having about beliefs and\nvalues because maybe somebody wants the\nbehavior of\nof let's say\num meditating every single day\nand maybe even\nwe're trained right to do it in\ncapabilities but the belief is\nyou know i can't quiet my mind or maybe\nthe the value is they don't value being\nstill and silent with themselves or\nbeing present with themselves or maybe\nthe behavior is they want to remember\nnames better right but then they maybe\nthey went through one of our podcasts or\nsomething and they got the capability\nbut the belief is i have a horrible\nmemory right or the value is i don't\nreally care about people you know and so\nthat's going to affect the behavior but\npeople are trying to force it and try to\nremember names when they should be\naddressing a different level but the\nlevel of beliefs and values is this\nlevel of identity and you know you've\naddressed this before it's like the two\nmost powerful words in english language\nthe shortest words i am because whatever\nyou put after that is\nyou know if somebody let's say their\nbehaviors they want to stop smoking but\nthey you know and maybe they have the\ncapability to do it they even have\nbeliefs or values around health but\ntheir identity is i am a smoker that's\ngoing to be a hard change to make or\nmaybe they want to stop procrastinating\nbut their identity is i'm a\nprocrastinator you know that could be a\nbig challenge for a lot of people and\nthe last level i would say below\nbehavior is this level of environment\nand the environment really is like let's\nsay somebody has the behavior of they\nwant to you know do something like\nmeditate but their environment doesn't\nallow them to have time for themselves\nor maybe they want to um read 30 minutes\na day but their environment doesn't have\nyou know it's too dark or whatever now\nthe big thing going back to pulled us\nall full circles the power of beliefs we\ntalked about the power of questions\nbecause your questions determine what\nyou're focusing on your particular\nactivating system what do you focus on\nis most real now in school you learn\nthere are six major\ncore questions right five w's and the h\nso look at this again these levels of\ntransformation identity answers the\nquestion of who\nright beliefs and values answers the\nquestion of why\ncapabilities answers the question of how\nbehavior answers a question of what and\nthe environment answers the question of\nwhen and and where so when you're\nlooking to make complete change whether\nit's getting people to read three times\nfaster remember names be able to learn\nanother language be able to meditate to\nbe able to you know do any kind of\nchange start that business you want to\nmake sure all those levels align then\nyou have alignment here you know mind\nbody and uh\nand life yeah absolutely yeah that's\nthat alignment that point you just made\nat the end there is unbelievable because\ni couldn't agree with you more just\nlooking back it's funny when you've\nstudied something at school and we just\ntake it as like ah you know right it was\ncute and fun but when you actually break\nit down like you just explained it and i\nrecommend everyone who is listening go\nlisten back to that what jim just said\nbecause\ni think it was gandhi who said that when\nwhat you think\nwhat you say and what you do are aligned\nthen you experience harmony in life yeah\nand you're not and i love that word\nharmony because a lot of people they\ntalk about about balance and it's going\nback to like and kind you know somebody\nwho's nice and kind there's a difference\nbetween balance and harmony like so many\npeople i was like i want to balance life\nbut balance when you look up the\ndefinition it's balance is like an\nequality like an equal amount of time\nand effort like i i don't want to spend\nthe same amount of time at work as i do\nworking out with the kids and everything\nso you don't want to equality there of\ntime but you want harmony like a\nlike an orchestra right like if you have\nnot every single instrument or person is\nhas equal amount of time but they come\ntogether and they create this incredible\nsymphony and i feel like we could do\nthat with our with our life also as well\nand i think that exactly is what you\njust said what this everything we're\ntalking about has just been brought back\nfull circle because our mindset about\nour life is i need everything to be\nbalanced right to fit this in like the\nlanguage around i need to fit something\nin right or i need to make time for this\nright and it's it puts pressure\nartificial pressure and then it feels\nlike we can't balance balance kind of\nfeels like you're juggling right or\nspinning lots of plates or something\nyeah yeah spinning lots of plates that\ndoesn't feel like a great visualization\nfor the mind or a mindset and then what\nyou've just said that actually shifting\nbalance to harmony right and you start\nthinking about it like an orchestra\nright it's like oh wow okay so you know\nthe the string quartet is playing for\nthat long percussion comes in then etc\netc\nand it and it all of a sudden even the\nvisualization of that\njust just calms the heartbeat right down\nyou know i do an annual uh quick brain\nevent and we had in our audience uh\nquincy jones we actually had quincy\njones domingo who is from you know we're\nat the four agreements i mean the\nfounder were but they're all sitting\nlike and i just like quincy comes up and\nhe's 85 years old and i was like tell me\nabout everyone talks about successes we\nare the world everything i want what are\nyour biggest struggles what are the\nproblems you went through and you had to\novercome he's like jim i don't have any\nproblems i'm like what like i mean\neverybody has problems i mean if you\nknow any problems you're putting you're\nsix feet under right he's like no i\ndon't have any problems i have puzzles\nanother\nchange in word and languaging and all of\na sudden you know for me a puzzle is\nlike fun you know a puzzle has a\nsolution to it it's something that's\nsomething that i could take on so that\nlanguaging plays a big world even when\npeople are going back to that levels of\ntransformation using words people say i\nam i am busy yeah i mean this is such a\npet peeve for mine just like nice into\nkindness is people say oh you know how's\nthinking i'm just so busy and it's like\nthey get the secondary gain\nof you know significance you know\nbecause the meta level message you're\nsending somebody when you're busy saying\nyou're busy it's like oh i'm really\nimportant and successful and for me like\nyou people will have this badge of honor\nsaying they're busy all the time and\nthen they wonder you know they design\ntheir whole life around being busy and\nthey wonder why they're stressed all the\ntime that they have anxiety they're not\ngetting any sleep but we're constantly\nprogramming it with our thoughts all the\ntime what's your switch for busy value\nso you do have one what do you use\nmine's productive i like that i like\nthat mine's productive so when someone\nsays how's your week been yeah it's been\nproductive because when i say productive\nyeah i feel empowered i feel like\neffectively with what we teach you know\npeople\ni don't share this publicly but i um i\nhave very bad sleep apnea\nand so besides my learning challenges so\nmy two biggest challenges growing up as\na kid were learning in public speaking\nand the universe has a sense of humor\nbecause what i do every day is public\nspeak on learning but of recent um\ni've been struggling with sleep apnea\nand usually it's caused by um someone\nbeing overweight because they have this\nextra excess\nweight around their neck so it's hard to\nbreathe and that's not my case it's you\nknow it's genetic and i stopped\nbreathing 200 times a night and each\ntime is at least 10 seconds so\nyou know i went to ucla and like no\nwonder the doctor's like it's like\nyou're not sleeping it's like somebody\ncoming in with a pillow and suffocating\nyou 200 times a night and yeah i'm\nwaking up because i can't breathe and i\nuse a cpap device a dental device i flew\ndown to spend two weeks with john of god\nin brazil i mean i've done all of this\nstuff\nyou know but i do believe that if\nanyone's watching this or listening to\nthis right now that\nthe question i ask we're talking about\nthe power of questions and beliefs is\nthat there's a gift in every struggle\nand i ask myself you know what where's\nthe gift in this you know people talk\nabout post-traumatic stress and i've had\npost-traumatic stress we've all had loss\nwe've all had you know\nloss of loved ones loss of relationships\nfinancial issues health issues but i\nbelieve that post-traumatic stress what\npeople don't realize there's also\npost-traumatic growth\nthat some people and i am sure you could\nidentify this and a lot of your\ncommunity can also is that you've gone\nthrough adversity and difficulty and\nit's something you would never wish upon\nin our soul\nbut\nthose people come out on the other side\nsome people will say i honestly wouldn't\nchange it as hard as it was going\nthrough it\ni have a new meaning in my life a new\nstrength a new clarity a new life\npurpose or mission\nand um and that sculpt my my soul\nbecause\ni believe that difficult times they\ncould diminish you they could define you\nor they could develop you\nand ultimately we we decide and that's\nthe that's the power we have\nthat whether or not you belong you\nbelieve in fate certain things that\nmeant to happen we also have free will\nto decide what to focus on what things\nmean\nyou know also as well so with the sleep\napnea my gift from it is i i search i'm\nlike what you know if i'm only sleeping\ntwo hours a night it's not like i gained\nsix hours of productivity you're talking\nabout being productive but my gift is\nnumber one\nit's forced me to double down on\neverything i teach so i have to be very\nhighly productive because i like so i\ncould read faster and be you know all\nthe stuff that i teach and learn because\ni'm at this disadvantage so i live you\nknow i i we had started this\nconversation with the life you live or\nthe lessons you teach you know and so i\ncan roll out of bed at four o'clock in\nthe morning and do this because all i\nhave to do is tell people what i'm doing\nbecause i don't have to rehearse it\nbecause i you know i live it i'm like\njust like yourself or anyone watching\nthis but the other thing is not only is\nit the gift was me um learning these\nskills and developing the capability\nit's um forced me to be very protective\nof my time you know so we're talking\nabout being busy\num you know everything in my life is\nheaven yes or heaven no like right now\nthere's nowhere i'd rather be than right\nhere with you you know what i mean\nbecause a lot of people who are stressed\nand overloaded it's self-inflicted\nbecause they are self-opting in saying\nyes way too much you know and we've all\nread that book good to great say no to\ngood so you can say yes to great but a\nlot of people have too many tabs open in\ntheir life they're saying yes yes yes\nand a lot of people in this community\nalso do that because they're martyrs\nthey're helping their friends their\nfamily their loved ones their customers\nor clients but they're not taking care\nof themselves and we've all heard\nself-love and self-care is not selfish\nthat you have to give you know to\nyourself before you give to somebody\nelse and what i would say to everyone\nmaybe this is a wake-up call saying that\nif you have opportunity stress you're\nsaying yes way too much is to take care\nsay no to to things so you could say yes\nto yourself and that's what i've learned\nto be able to do you know with myself\nbecause i you know i don't have a\ninfinite energy because of my sleep and\nnot everything that comes from that and\nso you know through struggles\nyou know can lead to strengths could\nlead to superpowers for sure absolutely\ni love that you've helped so many\nthousands of people through your\nteaching lectures courses online\nand so many influential people i mean\nyou've worked with everyone from like\nelon musk to will smith to\nquincy jones is at your event which i\ndidn't know but\nall of these incredible people you've\nhelped and helped them learn what have\nthey taught you in the process what have\nyou learned from them so i learned\nsomething from everyone you know with\nquincy um not only was it um you know he\nis amazing when people find their\npassion they use it for purpose but one\nof the things i learned from him is the\npower of perspective\nyou know he people don't realize this\nbut when i was um you know\nwe've been\ni've celebrated eight of his past 10\nbirthdays and we talk about things we\nstay up way late in the night and he\nspeaks 23 languages\nwhich is extraordinary you know so\nthere's definitely a correlation between\nmusic and languages you know that part\nof your brain if you will but what i'm\ntalking about what i've learned from him\nis the power of perspective meaning he\nhas this phrase saying you have to go to\nknow meaning he travels all around the\nworld because he really you know i don't\nthink there would be any kind of\nprejudice you know with with other\npeople people just travel more you know\nin their mind even if it's from books or\nanything because when you're exposed to\nculture and language and food and\ndifferent things you learn a deep\nappreciation for so you have to tolerate\nit you know tolerance is one thing but\nyou could actually appreciate and\nacknowledge and be more accepting of\nthings and notice that the patterns of\nhow we're all the same also so the power\nperspective and you know even when i\nwent to my friend's house when i was you\nknow ready to quit school um you know\nthat perspective of changing place in\npeople because when you change pete\nplace you should have a different\nperspective so i encourage anyone who's\nstruggling right now with a difficult\ndecision or a different situation to\nstep out of it and change your place\nmeaning just even going for a walk you\nknow helps but also changing your people\nbecause\neveryone's heard that who you spend time\nwith is who you become you spend time\nwith nine broke people you become the\ntenth right but there's a there's a real\nneuroscience reason you have mirror\nneurons\nwhich is your imitation um cells that\nare always imitating what other people\nare doing it's why we empathize so well\nwhen watching a movie we can feel scared\nwhen the person's going through a scary\nmoment\nor you know sports you could feel what\nthey're feeling but we also when we\nimitate though also are those things\ntheir capabilities their beliefs we\nstart imitating their values that's why\nit's better well done than it is well\nsaid for parenting you know certainly\nit's not people and even in online i i\nthink people who are most successful\nlike yourself is they don't just say it\nthey show it you know they don't promise\nthat they prove it and i feel like that\nyou know the things that we do\nis teaches people more than anything\nelse especially for children who don't\nlearn you know maya angelou said you\nknow people will forget what you say\nyou know they they'll they will they'll\nliterally they'll forget what you say\nand they'll forget what you do but they\nalways remember how you made them feel\nyou know through your example and so\ni've learned that from quincy you know\nfrom\nelon and i actually bonded over uh\nsci-fi\nour love of sci-fi books going back to\nfiction a lot of people and i i love\nsci-fi fiction but we never had that in\nschool i know and so like you know so\nmany people in our community they read\nnon-fiction books i totally appreciate\nthat if somebody has decades of\nexperience they put into a book and you\ncan sit down in a couple of days or a\nfew days and read that book you can\ndownload decades and days leaders\nreaders completely but\nso much research is coming out saying if\npeople spend more time reading fiction\nit helps with imagination\ncreativity by the way like everyone's\njob right now like because where this\ndigital age is going you think about ai\nartificial intelligence you think about\nautomation everything is being\noutsourced right now it's asia so those\nare the three a's automation asia and um\nand uh artificial intelligence so what\nwhat's where's our humanity here it's\nwhat makes us special\nthings that they that computers aren't\ngonna do imagination\nyou're right imagination is power you\nknow einstein said that um what about um\ncreativity right creativity is like the\nfuture belongs to the creatives yeah\nright and but that's not taught in\nschool you know school teaches you what\nto learn math history science spanish\nand poor class and let's learned but no\nclasses on how to learn they teach you\nwhat to learn and what to think not how\nto learn and how to think what are the\nclasses on imagination creativity\nlistening you know concentration focus\nand tell you know all these different\nareas you know i always thought just you\nknow at least remembering teach people\nhow to remember what they learned you\nknow reading writing arithmetic the\nthree r's but what about recall\nretention you know socrates learning is\nremembering because if we lost half of\nour memories we lose like a big part of\nwho we are you know and and the other\nreason why is people i was doing this\nprogram at google and somebody said like\njim why do i have to remember all this\nyou know i could just it's on our search\nengine and this is the truth\nif\nour life is a reflection of the\ndecisions we made up to this point you\nknow the the the\nthe um the sum of all our decisions you\nknow but we can only make good decisions\nbased on the information that we know\nand remember but if we forgot half the\nwords we needed have the people we knew\nhalf of our expertise we wouldn't be\nable to make good decisions for our life\ngood decisions for our health good you\nknow decisions on our relationship and\nwhat to do and so memory really is as is\na superpower and so with with um\nwith elon you know i read this book um\nwe were bonding over this book called\nthe structure of scientific revolution\nand it and um and by the other the other\nthing you get from ring\nfiction is not only creativity and\nimagination um but also empathy you know\nwhen you're when you're identifying with\nthe person's in there you get to feel\nwhat their feelings have built emotional\nintelligence\nso we bonded over ender's game and all\nthese great sci-fi books but then a book\nwe were talking about structure of\nscientific revolution and which\nbasically says that all innovation\nfrom every industry fashion technology\nautomotive comes from somebody usually\noutside the industry because it takes\nsomebody from the outside who didn't\ngrow up with the same limiting beliefs\nand education as someone traditional to\nlook in and say why aren't you guys\ndoing it like this so that outside\nperspective i learned from from elon\nstanley\nstanley recently passed and he was a\nreal superhero in my life you know i was\nthere through you know many times even\nwhen he got his hollywood star of fame\num you know and different moments the\nreason why i was you know i\ntaught myself how to read you know four\nyears it took me a long time by reading\ncomic books something about the\nsuperhero journey brought that the\nillustrations the story brought it to\nlife words to life for me so he's\nresponsible for teaching me literacy and\nfor me stan represents\ni'll give you three things um for me he\nrepresents play\nbecause at 95 even like you know because\ni was with him recently he um\nhis later years\nhe he was the youngest\nold person i knew\nyou know what i mean and he and that's i\nthink that's so important because a lot\nof people say they stopped playing\nbecause they grew older but it's the\nopposite you grow older because you stop\nplaying and he was so playful you know\nso play is a huge lesson for me number\nnumber the second p i would say is\npassion he found his passion to his\nlater years you know even when most\npeople have retired he had two passions\nnumber one he still went to work nine to\nfive in his in well into his eighties um\nyou know in early nineties because he\nloves telling stories mm-hmm you know\nbecause he found his passion and as a\npassion it was his wife he was one year\nolder yeah so that what a role model\nthat is for me and then finally the\nthird p is his purpose he turned his his\npassion of superheroes and he turned it\ninto a real purpose meaning\nsuperheroes you know what the underlying\nthing about superheroes is for us i feel\nlike\nthe lesson is one person can make a\ndifference totally you know what i mean\nwith all their flaws exactly a mistake\nexactly and then the biggest the most\nfamous superheroes out there they had\nthe biggest challenges you know all most\nof our my favorite superheroes they were\norphans spider-man was orphans\nsuperman's orphan wonder woman's orphan\nbatman was orphans you know\niron man orphaned you know they had the\nthe biggest difficulties you know and\nthat's the same thing i love about\nsuperheroes and then and they really\nrepresent hope you know look to the sky\nyou know one person we could all make a\ndifference and that's purpose for me\neven i was a big supporter of the stan\nlee foundation and it was all we all we\ndid is we brought entertainment and what\nstanzas brought entertainment into the\nclassroom because he knew education by\nitself is just it's boring you know you\ncan't just\nyou lecture to somebody kids don't learn\njust by consuming they learn through\ncreating you know and you talk about\nthis a lot education is one thing but\neducation if you want real empowerment\nyou melt education with entertainment\nthen you have that empowerment and stan\nwas was epic on that the lessons he\ntaught even back in the 60s you know\nwhen we lost\nyou know martin luther king and you know\nkennedy and everything he talked about\nhe talked about bigotry like back in the\n60s you know stan so he was a real role\nmodel because for me when we're talking\nabout play we're talking about passion\nwe're talking about purpose it also is\nabout um\nmaking a difference you know superheroes\njust having a super power doesn't make\nyou a superhero totally right everybody\nsomebody have a superhero power and i'm\nnot talking about superpowers or leaping\ntall buildings and shooting leaves out\nof your eyes we all have our own super\num unique abilities our unique talents\nyou know our unique strengths but just\nhaving those don't make you superhero\nyou have to use that those powers to\nmake a difference\nto make the world a better place and\nthat's what he did through his his\nfoundation yeah no absolutely his work\nbig honor to him and his incredible work\nand yeah teaching so many lessons\nthrough\nsuperheroes whether it's comics or\nmovies i feel exactly the same way the\nreason why i love superheroes super\nsuper hero movies and comics is because\ni literally look at that and go\nthey've all got flaws they've had really\nchallenging lives but they're still\ntrying to save the world yeah and\nthey're working together yeah right they\nwere working together they worked\ntogether that's huge with all of their\nflaws and with their different traits\nthey're not you know one superhero's not\nlooking at the other one going oh i wish\ni had uh lasers coming out my eyes right\nright happy and confident in their own\npower their ability but at the same time\nthey can appreciate the need for the\nother one yeah and that's kind of like\nany kind of relationship even even in in\na marriage or in your team in your\norganization you know they talk about\ngetting the right people on the bus and\nthen getting them in the right seats\nyeah then we're all driving you know\nthrough this vision together\nbut i believe that the greatest thing i\nmean i love books but i think a single\nconversation with somebody could go so\ndeep and so i'm naming famous people\nlike you know like a richard branson or\na you know because it the reason why\nthough is is not to drop names is\nbecause it creates these mnemonic\ntriggers so when you see this like for\nexample with jim carrey um you know i\nhelp actors um speed read scripts or\nmemorize their lines better and i\nremember we're in their kit in his\nkitchen we're making guacamole which is\nby the way great brain food avocado is\ngreat for your brain and i asked him\nlike you know um you know why do you do\nwhat you do going back to purpose and\nmission and he was like jim i act like a\ncomplete fool on camera\nand so extreme because i want to give\npeople watching permission to be\nthemselves he's like my my mission is to\nfree people from the concern of other\npeople\nand i really do believe jay that you\nknow we could go broke buying into the\nopinions and expectations of other\npeople that if we're being energized by\npeople's you know fueled by other\npeople's opinions then we could run out\nof fuel and gas really really really\nfast\nand i think one of the things that\nrepresses our ability to express\nourselves at the highest level\nis\nyou know you know i spent a lot because\ni lost my grandmother to alzheimer's i\nspent a lot of time in nursing homes\nstill to this day to senior centers not\nteaching them memory tricks but really\nshowing them you know having them share\nthese stories and you know so we could\npolish off their memories but the\nbiggest regret at that hey you know when\npeople are passing or you know that when\nthey have limited amount of time\nis their biggest regret is you know not\nliving their life i believe jay for\npeople that feel truly fulfilled and\nhappy they want to have the curiosity to\nknow themselves\nbut then also the courage to be\nthemselves you know the curiosity to\nknow yourself you reflect you journal\nyou meditate you go through all these\npersonal growth experiences to know who\nyou are\nbut then once you know more about who\nyou are you know being who you are is it\nyou know it takes courage it takes\nboldness because you know you don't want\nto look bad and you don't want to make a\nmistake and those are you know big\nchallenges people have yeah so um\nyou know i don't i don't want people to\nhave that regret because if people are\nscared about looking bad i think people\nshould use that fear of saying well what\nif what if you would have done it it\nwould change your life yeah what if you\nwould have done it it would have changed\nthe world\nabsolutely we've all been there yeah\nmoments where even now where we stop\nourselves i've got five last big\nquestions for you this is it now so it's\nthese are the questions what was the\nlast thing that you learned for the\nfirst time you probably asked that a lot\nwas a laugh that was the last thing you\nlearned for the first time like recently\nwhat did you learn for the first time\nagain the learner\nyeah i think one of the most important\nlessons i've ever learned is that\nthat i am 100 responsible nice for my\nlife i constantly get that lesson over\nand over again that i'm not a victim\nthat i am responsible for everything in\nmy life you know and\ni think that that's that's him having\nthat\nreally serves people awesome if you\ncould have any superpower what would it\nbe and why\nthis is a big one right\num\nmy i would love to have the superpower\nhelping other people unleash their\nsuperpowers that that's i'm very i'm\nvery passionate about that self's you\nknow like the ability to superpower to\nheal other people because we all know\nsomebody is struggling right now\nselfishly it would be the ability to\nteleport because you and i travel so\nmuch and we've seen each other in so\nmany different countries so uh that's\ntrue you know so teleporting would be\nnice but the ability to help keep other\npeople unleash their superpower same i'm\nwith you on that i want the same one\nyeah i feel like that's i think the\nworld modern day superheroes the world\nyou know\nthe world and people\nthe best version of ourselves showing up\nyou know imagine that like when you talk\nabout it with team right and culture\nit's just like yes\ncaptain america is great on his own\nthrower is great on their own iron man's\ngreat on their own but when they come\nall together in the avengers or batman\nsuperman in one room come together in\nthe justice league it's a different it's\na different story absolutely absolutely\nokay this question best advice you've\never received the best advice i've ever\nreceived or the one you can remember\nright\nwell i can remember a lot\ni would say\ngoing um going back to\nmy my story about my original mentor is\nnot to let school get in the way of\neducation that if you didn't perform\nwell in school\nthen that's okay that is not how smart\nyou are it's really how are you smart\nand everybody has everybody has these\ngifts totally uh worst advice you've\never given someone the worst advice i've\never given somebody\noh goodness um i would say this i would\ni would say this\nthis is my favorite advice to give\nsomebody but then there's the caveat of\nthe worst advice so i'd say\nknow yourself trust yourself love\nyourself be yourself\nbut if you're a jerk be somebody else\nso don't be that person so that would be\nmy advice to give somebody who's a jerk\ndon't don't be that person i like it i\nlike it and if someone wants to become a\nbetter learner\nright now in their life what's the\nnumber one thing that they can do to\nstart that journey yeah i would say this\num rumi said sell your cleverness for\nbewilderment\nyou know what i mean like i people do\nnot learn because they feel like they\nknow it all and we talked about stan lee\nand his age 95 i believe age is a state\nof mind it's a state of heart\nand if you were you know the fastest\nlearners on the planet their children\nyou know they have the sense of wonder\nthe sense of bewilderment is there\nthey're fascinated they ask lots of\nquestions they're not afraid of making\nmistakes\nand you know a child could fall a\nthousand times to learn how to walk you\nknow but sometimes somebody wants to\nlearn how to sing or to dance they try\none or two times and they have this fear\nof looking bad yeah and i would say\ntrade and sell your cleverness for\nbewilderment and play a whole lot more\nthat is beautiful\nwe'll end on that that is gym quick\neveryone mind blown absolutely\nmind-blowing it was absolutely\nincredible man that was just\nsuch a pleasure and joy to listen to you\nspeak and share those stories thank you\nfor showing so openly as well i know\nyou've really thank you wendell thank\nyou for that and thank you to everyone\nwho's listening and watching because\nyeah yeah i would i recommend everyone\nto listen to this one again and watch it\nagain yeah i would say in parting words\nis to listen to this maybe even take a\nscreenshot of this video or a podcast\nand then post it and then tag both of us\nand then share your big aha if you want\nto learn faster the other thing i would\nsay besides being curious and playful is\nto teach\nwhen you learn how to and then you learn\nwith the intention intention matters\nwhen you learn with the intent of\nteaching somebody else you're going to\nlearn it faster because when we share\nwhen we teach something we get to learn\nit twice so i'd say if they can take if\nit's appropriate take a screenshot of it\ntag us both but share your big aha or\nyour big learning so re-watch it\nre-listen to it and that goes a long way\ni believe that our life\ni compare it to an egg that if an egg is\nbroken by an outside force life ends but\nif it's broken by an inside force then\nlife begins and all great things begin\non the inside and everyone here they\nhave greatness inside of them they have\ngenies inside of them and i love shows\nlike yours because it helps people to\nlet it out no absolutely and it's\nexactly what you just said i remember\nwhen i was studying as a monk\nmy biggest inspiration was also a quote\nfrom einstein who's standing right there\nbehind us\nthe quote was if you can't explain\nsomething simply you don't understand it\nwell enough\nand that's how i would study i would\nstudy saying how do i simplify this to\nexplain it to someone yeah because if i\ncan explain it to someone articulate to\nthem in the way that they can remember\nit and they can remember and apply it in\ntheir own life again and again and again\nthen i'll be able to do it too\ninteresting if we're not no you're\nliving this like you're a great example\nof this that if we're not unpacking it\nin that way then there's no chance that\nwe can live it so i love that study to\nlearn i mean study to learn yes study to\nlearn and then when you teach you learn\nmore too yeah yeah so we we learn and\nthen we earn and then we return\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love you don't even\nknow the number of amazing things you do\nevery day instead you focus and ruminate\non the one thing you didn't get to and\nthen you use that as evidence again dust\non the mirror\nto see a human being that's not\nmeasuring up and never will and all that\nstuff their stupid fourth grade teacher\nsaid to you must be true dust on the\nmirror no\nyou need to interrupt this"
