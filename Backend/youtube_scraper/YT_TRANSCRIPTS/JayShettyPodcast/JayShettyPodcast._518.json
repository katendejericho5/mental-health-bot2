for me\nsupporting my community having great\nFinancial Health is a really important\npart of my mission and who better to go\nto the news so you know I'm really\ngrateful that I get to connect my\ncommunity with you I'm sure many of them\nare already listeners anyway but Dave\nyou know let's let's start learning a\nbit more about you and your journey I\nwant to hear about when Dave wasn't the\nfinancial expert that he is like what\nwere your mindsets what was your\nrelationship like with money when it\nwasn't where it is today I grew up in a\nhousehold of entrepreneurs and so they\ntaught us uh that you can do it that all\nyou've got to do is leave the cave kill\nsomething and drag it home I mean\nthere's you can go out there and make\nsomething in this world and that the\nfree enterprise system is not broken and\nit's tough It's hard but you can do it\nand so uh I believe that and I still\nbelieve it and uh I I went and got my\nreal estate license when I turned 18 and\nwhen I graduated from college I started\nbuying and selling real estate and\nstarting from nothing I got rich at\nleast by a kid from Antioch Tennessee\nstandards I ended up with about four\nmillion dollars worth of real estate and\na little over a two million dollar uh\nnet or a little over a million dollar\nnet worth I was making a couple hundred\nthousand dollars a year that's 1982 20\n000 bucks a month from the neighborhood\nI grew up in that's called Rich and so\nuh we were having a blast but I'd\nborrowed too much money and the short\nversion of story is the bank got sold to\nanother bank they called our notes we\nwere doing flip this house before uh\nchip and Joanna were born and so you\nknow we uh the bank called our notes and\nwe spent the next two and a half years\nof our life losing everything we owned\nwe were sued and foreclosed on and with\na brand new baby and a marriage Hanging\nOn by a thread we had the opportunity to\nstart over after bankruptcy and it was\nuh it was brutal it was brutal it was\ngut wrenching it was life defining\num and it was at the time the worst\nthing that had ever happened to me at\nall the worst trauma uh the to not be\nable to keep your word to have your\nintegrity just crushed by your stupidity\nand um it was I come from an honor\nculture and it's just uh it's a horrible\nthing and so obviously now 30 years\nlater I realized thing that ever\nhappened to me because I learned a whole\nnew way of looking at money I realized\nthat borrowing money was a bad plan and\nwe've since been able to put lots of\ndata to that and millions of lives to\nthat idea that the idea of if you don't\nhave any payments you've got money and\nyou can build some wealth and so we\nbegan a debt-free life at uh 28 years\nold and I'm 62. so uh it's worked out\npretty well that's incredible Dave I\nmean you as you said you've been talking\nto people about that money for 30 years\non the Ramsey Show you've given you know\nhelped so many people over those decades\nare you hearing new financial problems\ntoday or is it the same ones repeated\nover and over again is there a new\nchallenge a new issue or are we stuck in\na similar mindset over the last three\ndecades there's the uh problem and then\nthere's the symptom\nthe symptoms are always new\nuh you know a Bitcoin a get rich\nopportunity right that's a new symptom\nuh you know there's been all kinds of\nsymptoms pop up over the years that are\ndifferent there's a period of time where\ncredit card debt was the most awful\nthing on the planet then there was a\nperiod of time where student loans are\nthe most awful thing on the planet and\nuh you know the the thing that is\nholding down the middle class the thing\nthere's crushing families and these\nkinds of things and then there was a\nperiod of time in 2008 when the\nmortgages were failing and the real\nestate market failed and so we've seen\nall these things but they're basically\nthose are all symptoms and underlying\nall of that again very similar to to\nyour insights uh is the idea that\nprinciples have been violated when you\nviolate principles you're going to get\nthese symptoms they'll have all kinds of\ndifferent colors and looks to them but\nthey're the same root cause\nDave you know you've talked about this a\nlot uh through your book through your\nwork\nthrough a number of your books about how\nwe don't really get educated on these\nideas in school and you must find it\nshocking that across 30 years that\nhasn't massively changed uh what is it\nthat you think we're missing out on at\nschool what are the key principles as\nyou were mentioning that you need to\nlearn at school or that you need to\nlearn to start so that you can have a\nhealthy relationship with your finances\nand money well there's a level of\nMythology that has been spread about\nmoney in our culture that was spread\nwith an agenda frankly it was all uh if\nI was a bank I would teach everyone that\nthey needed a credit score\nand the reason I would teach them they\nneed a credit score and the way to get a\ncredit score is to borrow money from me\nso and pay it back to me so that you can\nraise your score so you can borrow money\nfrom me so you can pay it back to me so\nyou can raise your score so you can\nborrow money from me so you can pay back\nto me so you can raise your score it's a\ngreat plan if you're a bank and uh so\nbut then it was put out there that now\nthe FICO score is like biblical truth or\nsomething and it's not it was a it's a\nbanking program to get people to borrow\nmoney but now and so what's happened\nwith some financial literacy programs in\nschools is they're they're going to\nteach you to build your FICO score\nbecause that's been accepted now as Norm\nrather than as rather than actual well\nit's accepted as fact even though it's\nnot a fact and so what we've done is\nwhat we have I mean our antidote would\nbe to say okay we're going to teach\npeople to live on a budget and how to do\na budget we're going to teach them to\nlive on less than they make concept\nCongress can't grasp we're going to\nteach them to uh to be generous\noutlandishly generous and we're going to\nteach them to save and invest in the\npower of compound interest and these\nthings are agnostic to the banking\ncommunity\nand so we don't have to Infiltrate The\nLending community and the people the\npieces of the financial industry that\nhave an agenda into this curriculum but\nbasically a lot of teachers have been\nindoctrinated by the culture that this\nis the way you have to live you're\nalways going to have a car payment you\nhave to have a credit card you're uh you\nknow you can't be a student without a\nstudent loan and then they bring that\ninto the classroom because they\npersonally have been taught this but\nwhen you back it out and say well the\nteaching is with an agenda then you have\nto stop and go ah there's a villain in\nthis story and so instead we need to be\nteaching the basic premise of Common\nSense and good news is we've actually\ngotten our high school curriculum and\nabout 48 percent of the high schools in\nAmerica so far so we're waking up a few\npeople here there we're causing a bit of\na Ruckus but certainly the banks and\nthose kinds of folks are not happy about\nthat because we're teaching people not\nto borrow money I actually had that\nexperience so I grew up in a house where\nmy parents never wanted us to be in debt\nso we I didn't even know what a credit\ncard was quite frankly growing up and we\nonly ever used debit cards and so when I\nmoved to the United States from London\nand I went to buy a car\nthey they wouldn't give it to me because\nI didn't have a credit score now I had\nenough money to buy that car maybe\neven 10 20 times if I wanted to but they\nwouldn't let me because I didn't have\nthe credit score and so I had to get\ninto this habit of building up that\ncredit score in the same way and that\nwas massively different for me because I\njust never been in that mindset So when\nyou say that it it resonates with me\nvery strongly because I just couldn't\nimagine ever feeling like I owed people\nor that I was buying things with money\nthat wasn't mine uh because of the way\nI'd been raised around it I mean what's\nthe craziest financial situation that\nyou've ever heard on the show like\nwhat's what's something that really\nblows your mind and you go even this is\ncrazy for Dave Ramsey the line that we\nalways use and it's true is I haven't\nborrowed money in 30 years so I don't\nhave a credit score mine's\nundeterminable or zero uh and so the\njoke is and it's it's the truth I if I\ngo down to a local apartment complex and\nthere's a sweet little 26 year old\napartment manager that is Corporate has\ntold her what to do and they have they\nrequire a FICO score to rent I can't\nrent an apartment there and I'm a\nmulti-millionaire I can write a check\nand buy the complex but I can't rent an\napartment there now that's that's just\nasinine that's just ridiculous and so\nthat that illustrates the absurdity of\nthis as far as the crazy stuff on the\nshow oh my goodness I mean we do we do\nthree hours a day for 20 for 30 years\nnow I mean it's we've had crazy on on\nparade at times and you the thing I have\nto try to do is laugh because I've done\nso many stupid things I've got a PhD in\ndumb so when somebody calls with\nsomething stupid we just laugh together\nI mean I'm not shaming them but oh my\ngosh I mean people with just I mean I\nhad a guy with a million dollars in\ncredit card debt one time how do you do\nthat I mean that was like a full-time\njob to pull that off and we've had lots\nof people with with hundreds of\nthousands of dollars of student loan\ndebt and um\nthey just get themselves in all kinds of\nstuff and so you know you get stupid on\nsteroids and it just explodes it gets\nexponential and it's really you know\nit's it's crazy humorous because it's so\nabsurd but you know also while you're\ntalking to them it's just sad because\nthey're completely trapped and how am I\ngoing to get this uh this young dentist\nthat's in one of our documentaries it's\ngot a million in student loan debt and\nhow am I gonna how am I gonna help him\nget out of that oh it's just\nheartbreaking yeah I mean those stories\nas you said like I love that you create\nthis open welcoming space for people to\nfeel heard feel seen and like you said\nwe've we've all made mistakes uh but\nthen at the same time I really value how\nyou give very specific strategic advice\nfor people to get out of those places\nnow your new book uh baby steps\nmillionaire like what I really love\nabout it and what I want to do on this\npodcast is I want to kind of touch on\neach of the chapters because whenever\nsomeone has a book out and I I deeply\nvalue books books have changed my life\nlife I believe they're absolutely\ntransformative they they start\nincredible Journeys I believe yours is\ngoing to do this for so many people it\nalready has but with this book your\nfirst chapter is called can anyone Be A\nMillionaire and I think a lot of people\ngrow up with the feeling that they will\nnever be one they're not planning for\nthat and they don't even think about\nthat I would say that I grew up with\nthat mindset too uh because of the\nfamily that I was raised in and the\npeople I was raised around tell us a bit\nabout that question and why you take the\napproach you do to that answering that\nquestion well it's an important place to\nstart because it's one of the reasons we\nwrote the book\num we've got a group of people in\nAmerica I call them hope Stealers who\nare saying that it's impossible to win\nnow it's impossible to win there's too\nmany systemic problems there's too many\nthings that are broken in the culture\nand in the economy that the the little\nit's the ultimate line the little man\ncan't get ahead thing and yet I kept\nrunning into\nmillionaires everywhere who were first\ngeneration they started with nothing\nthey did not inherit their money and\nthen I started running into them that\nhave followed our baby steps that's why\nwe named it baby steps millionaires that\nbecame millionaires and so I thought\nI've got this all this data and\nanecdotal evidence both on one side that\nit is possible and I've got these hope\nStealers out here telling people they\ncan't do it and stealing their hope and\nso I thought well you know the first\nthing we've got to do is we have to fix\nthat because it's still Henry Ford line\nif you think you can or you think you\ncan't you're probably right and so uh\nyou know you you have to and I I'm if I\nthink I can be in the NBA I'm wrong I\ncan't okay there's not a chance I don't\nhave the physical skills I'm an old guy\nwith a pot belly it's not happening\nright so that's ridiculous but but when\nit comes to over time can I have a\nsuccessful marriage even though maybe in\nyour past there's not one in your family\ntree over time can I raise good kids\neven though in most of your family tree\nNo One turns out can you break that\nchain and if you don't believe you can\nyou won't take the steps to do the hard\nwork to be successful in that area that\ncompartment that department of your life\nand money's no exception to that and\nmoney's particularly weird in the\nspiritual in that uh in this area of\nbelief because it just\nit will run from you you can't catch it\nuh you know if you don't believe uh\nbecause you won't do the you won't do\nthe the sacrificial things you won't\nlive like no one else so that later you\ncan live and give like no one else\nthere's no reason a farmer would ever go\nout and toil in the Sun and Pla and plow\nthe field and get the stumps out and the\nrocks out and then put corn in the\nground if he didn't think corn was going\nto come up after he did that that would\nbe absurd only a crazy person would do\nsomething that they don't think is going\nto turn out and so you have to believe\nfirst and so what we try to do is we try\nto bring in emotional Behavior Uh data\nof other people and math and any kind of\na lens I can get you to look through to\nmake you believe that you can do it I\nknow you can do it but I've got to\nconvince you you can do it before we can\nmove into the Tactical steps yeah and\nwhat are some of those what would you\nsay are the mindsets\nor the traps that keep people broke\nwhere you are having to convince people\nthat they can what are those things that\nkeep us in that mindset I think we've\nbecome number one who we hang around\nwith uh there's not any question about\nthat so you have to be careful uh and\nI'm not talking about being snobbish to\nsomeone we're not I'm nice to anybody\nI'll talk to anybody about anything I'm\nhappy uh but but I'm talking about your\ncrew the people that are your inner\ncircle who do you hang with your income\nis going to approximate theirs over time\nuh your physical condition if they're\nall overweight you're gonna be\noverweight if they if they take care of\ntheir bodies you're going to take care\nof your body if they have good marriages\nyou're gonna have good marriage you're\ngoing to become who you hang around with\nyou're even gonna have an accent like\nthey do you know and you're going to\nread the books that they read and so you\nnumber one you need to get yourself in a\ncommunity of people who are Achievers\nwho believe it can be done who\nunderstand it's tough\nand I'll encourage you when you're\nhaving a hard one because I mean some of\nus have had a hard couple years here a\nlot of us have you know and so you gotta\nhave guys and gals in your corner that\nsay go champ you got this you can do it\nI'm I got your back man and and so\nthat's so much different than growing up\nin a neighborhood where my parents were\nsaying you can do this but a lot of kids\nI ran around with their parents were\nsaying well the little man can't get\nahead\nyou're always going to have a car\npayment\nyou're stuck People Like Us\nyou know people that have a Southern\naccent their Hillbillies and rednecks we\nwe don't get ahead we just we we just we\njust uh you know give them middle finger\nsalute to the man and we move on and you\ncan do that from any racial background\nany cultural background there's a group\nof people that that declare themselves\nstuck then there's also a group of\npeople within that same community and\nthat same tribe it's a smaller group\nthat declare that it's possible to be\nfree it's possible to prosper it's\npossible and it's victims or Victors and\nthe neat thing is that once you begin to\nkind of get that inside of you anyone\ncan just make that choice\nI decide\nand here we go yeah I think you're spot\non I think you're absolutely right and\nyou know I know what that feels like\nbecause that's the culture I grew up in\nI I grew up around that culture that\ndidn't believe and that often saw money\nas evil or we always believed that\npeople who had money must have done\nsomething sketchy to get it or they\nweren't really living a life of\nintegrity and so that was the mindset\nthat was built up for a long long time\nthat had to be massively unlearned and\nunraveled and I wish I had you at that\ntime I I didn't uh but you know I'm glad\nthat we do today I think you mentioned\nspiritual and belief and what I really\nappreciated about the book is that the\nbook is filled with knowledge about how\nto handle your finances but at the same\ntime it has Bible verses that can\nEnlighten the readers too and I wanted\nto ask you that why did you think it was\nimportant to talk about the Bible and\nyou know the word of God as well as\ntalking about finances like what was the\nreasoning behind that I was fascinated\nby that now that's always a uh sometimes\nit's off-putting for some folks\nobviously uh and so I try not to be over\nthe top it's not a a Christian manual on\nfinance uh but the the books of wisdom\nin particular the Proverbs uh it can can\nbe applied regardless of your faith uh\nregardless of your background or your\nbelief system uh wisdom's wisdom if Ben\nFranklin said something you know it's\nokay you you can you can kind of look at\nthat and think that's possible right and\nhe's not in the Bible but I mean you see\nwhat I'm saying so uh and but what we've\ndiscovered about personal finance and I\ndiscovered this years and years ago the\nhard way I kept when I was doing\ncounseling and coaching with people when\nI first started I would go in and fix\nall of their budget and negotiate with\ntheir creditors a set of payments that\nwould fit within their income\nand I and they were about to file\nbankruptcy but we we stopped their\nforeclosure we got them on a plan with\ntheir bank right on the edge we pulled\nthem back from the edge and said okay\nnow work this plan\nand then I would see them six weeks\nlater and say how's the plan going we\nfiled bankruptcy what I did 90 hours of\nwork to get that to where it would do\nwhat do you mean you filed bankruptcy\nand I started realizing it wasn't math\nmath wasn't the problem the problem with\nmy money is the guy I shave with if I\ncan get that guy to behave he can be\nskinny and Rich oh my gosh he's a\nproblem and so we start realizing\npersonal finance is 80 behavior only 20\nhead knowledge and behavior is a\nspiritual thing\nI'm an Evangelical Christian so for me I\nimmediately gravitate to the Bible as a\nas a spiritual instruction and there's\n2500 scriptures dealing with money so\nwhether you're a Christian or not\ndoesn't matter to me the reason I'm\nbringing that up is it's an indication\nof this is a set of behaviors and a set\nof views a set of beliefs a spiritual\nwalk that influences your behavior and\nyour behavior creates your outcome it's\neverybody's trying to fix their finances\nwith a math formula and if you were\ndoing math you wouldn't be in credit\ncard debt yeah well said and I'm so\nhappy that you do that as well I know\nyou know from my work my the the\nTraditions I studied spiritual\nTraditions are such big Inspirations to\nme and I find so much uh validity and\ntimelessness in in how they apply to\ntoday's modern day challenges Dave the\nchapter two in chapter three talk about\nwhat a baby steps millionaire is and how\nto become one can you define to us the\ndifference between a millionaire and a\nbaby steps millionaire because I think\nthis is something that a lot of people\nstruggle with well first it's good to\njust say the definition of a millionaire\nis not a Dave Ramsey definition this is\nan accounting definition personal\nfinance has been taught for decades\nbefore I was born this is a it's a math\nformula it's a very simple formula\nassets minus liabilities equals net\nworth what you own minus what you owe\nequals your net worth when your net\nworth is one million dollars or greater\nwhen what you own minus what you owe is\none may integrate you're a millionaire\nwell I don't feel like a millionaire\nit's not a feeling I I don't believe\nanybody ought to be a millionaire it's\nnot a moral construct I don't think\nthat's enough it might not be but it's\nstill a million it's still what's there\nthis is a math formula and when you\nreach that the way you're a billionaire\na thousand million is if you your assets\nminus your liabilities it's not your\nincome you can make a million dollars a\nyear and not be a millionaire you can\nmake thirty thousand dollars a year and\nbe a millionaire so it's your it's a\nit's a net worth balance sheet\ntransaction it's an accounting function\nit's not up for negotiation now we can\ndiscuss all kinds of things about what a\nmillion is and whether it's enough and\nthe moral construct around it those kind\nof that that's a that's a fair\ndiscussion to have but first you got to\nadmit and just say that is a millionaire\nwell I just don't feel I don't care you\nare a millionaire you know I talked to a\nguy today on my show he just paid off\nhis house and it's worth nine hundred\nthousand dollars and it's gone way up in\nvalue he's out of Denver and the\nMarket's shot way up and he goes it\ndoesn't I don't feel like a millionaire\nbecause he got several hundred thousand\nin his 401k so he's got a net worth of a\nmillion dollars and I said it's not a\nfeeling and he goes I don't feel like I\nearned it it doesn't matter I don't care\nwhere you got it it's still a million\nit's still that's you got to really get\nback to that so once we do that then we\nsay all right now then where do\nmillionaires come from and several years\nago we did the largest study of\nmillionaires ever done in North America\nmy friend Tom Stanley who's passed away\nnow did a book in 1992\num called The Millionaire Next Door\nand he studied millionaires in 1992 many\nyears ago uh and he's his sample size in\nthe research was 750 millionaires and\nthe people who did not like the\nconclusions of his study used the sample\nsize to criticize and say it wasn't\nvalid now those of us that know\nstatistics know that's a valid sample\nsize uh that you know that that that's a\nit fits the numbers but uh so we decided\nas a PR part of the study to do 7 500\nmillionaires 10 times what was necessary\nto be statistically significant 750 is\nstatistically significant and then we\njust went overboard and ended up doing\n10 167 before we were done so we've done\nthe larger study and here's what we\nfound\n79 percent of America's millionaires\nairtight research data not a feeling not\na political agenda not your broke\nbrother-in-law's opinion at Thanksgiving\nnot how he feels about rich people none\nof this data\n79 percent inherited precisely zero wow\n8 out of 10. five percent more inherited\na small amount like fifteen hundred\ndollars or five thousand dollars\nmathematically could not have possibly\nmade them a millionaire another five\npercent inherited substantial money like\na hundred thousand two hundred thousand\ndollars after they were already\nmillionaires so five and five and\nseventy nine we're at 89 percent nine\nout of ten of America's millionaires did\nnot become millionaires because of an\ninheritance wow so that's a millionaire\nand I'm running into these guys\neverywhere in 30 years of doing this and\nit's screaming at me this is possible\nand and they're not rocket scientists\nthey're not rock stars they're not one\npercent of the millionaires in America\nyou would know their name meaning that\nthey're on TV or they're a rock star or\nthey're an NBA or MLB or something you\nknow they're in that but one percent 99\nare a teacher and a policeman you know\nand and they're a a a a number one cat\ncategory our number one career was\nengineer so then we started hearing from\npeople I've been teaching this stuff for\n30 years getting people out of debt\ngetting them on a budget so that they\ncan invest in their 401K so they can pay\noff their house and they were following\nour baby steps and becoming millionaires\nso we had first generation millionaires\neveryday millionaires we called them and\nthen we had millionaires that had become\nmillionaires following our process and\nthat process is called the baby stuff so\nthat's the it's a nuanced subset of what\na millionaire is too much talk but\nthat's that's the deal not too much\ntalking at all that was brilliant I'm so\nglad you went there not too much talk at\nall I think you know that's fascinating\nfirst of all the fact that you did this\nstudy second of all I think when you\nhear that everyone's just surprised\nbecause you just assumed that everyone\nis a millionaire is either a you know a\ntech founder or a celebrity or a\nmusician and you know I think we have\nperceptions as you rightly said earlier\naround wealth what are some of those key\nsteps if someone's in their 20s right\nnow or in their 30s and they're like I\nwant to be a baby steps millionaire I\ndon't want to walk through the seven\nsteps because I know they're beautifully\nlaid out in the book what are some of\nthe first things that they need to start\nthinking about Dave let's go back to it\nand and say out loud the tech person or\nwhatever the stuff we're teaching will\nnot make you a billionaire\nit won't do it mathematically it won't\nthese were millionaires one to ten\nmillion dollars worth of net worth okay\nand so it these are that's a lot of\nmoney\nbut it's not a billion these people\ndon't have private jets they don't have\nsix houses they don't have a Lamborghini\nthose are billionaires that have that\nand a lot of those are people that that\nare household names the gates or the\nbuffets or the whatever that kind of\nthing and that's but that's a different\nworld in this world the way to get the\nfirst one to ten million ends up being\n80 percent of them a little about 83\npercent of them had two things that\nshowed up almost every time number one\nthey funded their 401K in good mutual\nfunds and their Roth IRAs and good\nmutual funds over an extended period of\ntime 12 to 17 years\nthat's not that long but that was long\nit's longer than five minutes this and\nit's not get rich quick it's the\ntortoise not the hair so 12 to 17 years\nduring that time the average millionaire\npaid off their home in 10.2 years\nand so what we've got is we've got a guy\nthat or a gal that's got a million five\nnet worth and they of it as a in there\nis a 500 000 paid for home and a million\ndollars in their retirement accounts\nand that's almost all it was those two\nthings you know the power of compound\ninterest building up your emerging or\nbuilding up your mutual funds winning in\nyour 401k and just steady steady steady\nnever stopping never panicking when the\nMarket's down just steady steady steady\nsteady just keep doing it just keep\ndoing it just keeps boring it's not sexy\nsee it all you're not going to be on the\ncover of Fast Company magazine you know\npaying off your mortgage nobody knows\nyou did it it's just kind of book but\nhere you sitting with a paid for house\nand a million bucks I think you're going\nto be okay so that that's what most of\nthem did a few of them were Farm\nmillionaires large enough to be uh to\nmention here meaning that they uh not\ninherited but they were a farmer that\nbought land and then they bought more\nland and then they bought more land and\nthat land in and of itself became worth\nover a million dollars that's that\nwasn't that unusual we saw several of\nthose as well but what we discovered was\nprocess people are the ones that did\nthis whether they were baby steps\nmillionaires or just Millionaires and so\nthe number one career was engineer\nnumber two is accountant number three\nwas teacher\nnumber three was teacher number four was\nan executive and number five was a\nlawyer MDS didn't even make the top five\nmedical doctors made number six and now\nif you count even the MDS if you count\nevery one of those okay engineer\naccountant teacher\nexecutive and lawyer every one of those\nare systems people they believe in a set\nof principles and when you follow those\nprinciples you get a result as you so so\nshall you reap if you plant corn don't\nbe shocked corn comes up and every one\nof those it's a cause and effect world\nthat they live in they believe in\nsystems they believe in processes figure\nout the system work the system you build\na bridge this way it stays up you do a\nlesson plan this way the T the student\nlearns you know every one of you know\nthere's a you follow a set of decorum\nand laws and processes in court or the\njudge puts you in jail for contempt you\nhave to and so all of these are\nprocessed people so it turns out it's a\nprocess you spoke about something really\nbrilliant it's not sexy\nit's not quick\nand it's not what it looks like on\nInstagram on social media in the\npictures\nI feel like half the battle is building\nthat discipline muscle that habit that\npattern of consistent Focus\nwhat is taking us away from that how do\nwe build that muscle because it sounds\nlike to me that that's what's blocking\nus we want it to be sexy we want it to\nbe fast we wanted to look a certain way\nand you're like wait wait it doesn't\nlook like that at all you know I think\nit's disturbing the the wonderful things\nabout social media are obvious the\nwonderful things about the internet are\nobvious we're able to do this interview\nthis way it's obvious that it's a\nfabulous convenience and everything the\ndownside is is that we're creating\nGenerations now even up into mild\ngeneration of people who have the\nattention span of a gnat I mean they\ncan't stick with anything and in order\nto do something of greatness it requires\na steady application over a period of\ntime the old days of a Craftsman going\nthrough years of apprenticeship in order\nto be world class at something now we\nwant to just snap our fingers and\ninstantaneously be able to do this\nbecause we carry this magic wand around\nin our hand that if we push stuff push a\nbutton Stuff shows up on our porch I\nmean it's magic and anything we want you\ncan do you can get anything you want on\nthis thing in very very quickly it's you\ncan't even have a good argument because\nyou can get the answer to the problem\nout there and and you know we used to\nhave to sit around have fights at dinner\nand our family and argue about whether\nsomebody was right or not now somebody\ngoes and looks on the internet and finds\nthe answer and well Georgia's just wrong\nHenry's right you know and it's just so\nthis attention span thing is a problem\nand\num and really what that is uh underneath\nwithout shaming someone or trying to\nshame a whole generation I'm not doing\nthat because there's people within each\ngeneration that don't do this or that\nbreak free from it is it's emotional\nmaturity\nthe ability to delay pleasure\nis a sign of maturity that's what\ngrown-ups do children do what feels good\nYOLO you only live once quick instead of\nlike I'm gonna sacrifice\nto get a greater outcome I'm going to\nlive like no one else so that later I\ncan live and give like no one else I've\ngot to have the moment at this moment\nthat is a childish expression of any\narea of your life it will destroy your\nmarriage it will raise horrible children\nuh you know it'll mess up your career\nand it certainly will mess up your money\nshort-term thinking the get rich quick\nhas never worked at any time in the\nworld as an ongoing provable sustainable\nprocess it's always and that's where the\ntortoise and the hair esop's Fable comes\nfrom right and so we've got to stick\nwith this idea and that even includes\nour generosity uh you know we're\nstarting to talk about generosity and\nthe the generosity with these folks with\nthese millionaires that we studied is a\nsteady thing like their savings is a\nsteady thing they're not trying to have\nthis one big event that says look at me\nhow generous I am instead they're fairly\nquiet about it almost absurdly quiet and\nAnonymous about it and they steadily\ngive in to something that they believe\nin if they're a Christian they're going\nand giving a tie that their local church\nif they're Jewish they might also be\ntithing at their synagogue\num the the um you know regardless of\nyour faith background there's not a a\nreligious background on the planet that\ndoes not have a steady giving Rhythm as\na part of its teaching every one of them\ndo because it's how you build character\nand when you're giving it's almost\nimpossible to not become grateful\nand as you become grateful the next\nthing that happens is you become more\nand more content\nand the more content you are in a\ntotally discontented culture the great\nAdvantage you have to build wealth ah\nDave that is such a fantastic answer I\nlove how we're talking about money but\nwe're talking about emotional maturity\nwe're talking about you know character\nand developing character and developing\npatience and developing discipline and\nyou told us earlier how you initially\ncame to wealth the first time around or\nwhat was considered rich where you were\nfrom the first time around\nhow emotionally and mentally prepared do\nwe have to be to even be wealthy because\nwe talked about the discipline and the\npostponing of pleasure before we get\nthere but then even when you get there\nto stay there requires a different level\nof mental and emotional maturity talk to\nus a bit about that because I think\nthat's often undervalued it's a\ndifferent level of nobility not not in a\nuh not an aristocracy sense or a looking\ndown on the Little People's sense that's\nnot what I'm saying at all but this idea\nwhat happens is the people that do this\nthey grow into uh they may be in the\nacquisition mode early and as it goes\nalong but as the weight of the\nresponsibility of the wealth starts to\ngrow on them over time it doesn't seldom\nhappens quickly then it flips from\nacquisition to Servant to serving\nand they see their wealth as an\nopportunity to serve your spouse I can\nget her a nice car I can serve my\nchildren they can go to college and we\ncan pay for it I can serve my community\nand we can open a homeless shelter or\nfund a homeless shelter I can serve uh\nthe The World At Large and the more you\nstart to realize then the more money\nyou're managing the more people you can\nhelp because at certain point that you\ncan't ingest enough stuff you know if\nyou eaten you know when I was a good kid\ngrowing up I never had Lobster that was\nthe Red Lobster came to town it was a\nbig deal right and if I got Lobster with\nthat drawn butter on my mouth watering\nright now if I got Lobster with that\ndrawn butter you know I thought that was\nrich people food and so you know I\nthought rich people ain't Lobster all\nthe time and and so once I had some\nmoney I finally figured out if you eat\nenough Lobster it tastes like soap you\ncan't get enough cars\nto to be okay\nwinning winning does not heal you\nbecoming wealthy does not heal you it\nmakes you more of what you already are\nand if you gain wealth gradually and\nbuild the character as you're doing it\nit will flip at some point and you will\nbecome a noble servant of your family\nchange your family tree of your\ncommunity and that's really all money is\ngood for after a certain point I mean\nagain you can have some nice things and\nI'm not against having nice things uh\nbut but your nice things will have you\neventually they'll Eat You Alive if\nthat's where you think happiness is\nbecause it's not while winning does not\nheal you that's that's definitely a\npowerful powerful message for you know\neach and every one of us to hear\nespecially because I think society as\nyou said earlier has actually programmed\nthat feeling is that if you win you\nwon't even well actually we've been made\nto believe if you win you don't even\nneed a healing and we end up seeing\nthese folks that are in the celebrity in\nthe spotlight whether it's sports\nfigures or Hollywood figures or whatever\nand they become massively successful\nwithin their craft and financially\nsuccessful too but we we they prove out\nthe concept of what we just said they're\ntheir lives are a mess many times and\nthat they didn't get what they hope to\nget from all of it uh they didn't get\nhealing they didn't get happiness they\ndidn't get wholeness they didn't get\ncontentment uh quite the opposite\nbecause what money does is it's a\nmagnifier it makes you more of what you\nare\nand so to to the extent you are whole\nit's going to make you Noble and serving\nand to the extent that you are greedy\nyou're going to be unbelievably greedy\nto the extent you have a temper problem\nyou're going to be a rageaholic I mean\nyou're going to be more if you're crazy\nyou're gonna get crazier I mean whatever\nit is it makes you more it magnifies\nwhatever you are and so it it is it is a\nit's a powerful weapon it's a powerful\ntool to be used but it is very dangerous\nbecause it's a magnifier yeah and that\nthat links nicely to this really\nimportant question you ask\nand answer in chapter 7 which is Will\nwell through in my kids right I think\nthat's a very common again misconception\nit's a common question and you talk\nabout how sometimes parents actually\nwait too long to talk to kids about\nmoney because we kind of things like oh\nthey're not going to understand it\nthey're not gonna get it they're not old\nenough yet talk to us a bit about why we\nhave that fear that wealth will ruin our\nkids and how early can you start and I\nknow in the book you talk about the five\nbehaviors to raise money smart kids but\nmaybe if you can just touch on one or\ntwo of them that you really feel is the\nright time to start and where to start\nwell if we go back to our earlier\ndiscussion understand that handling\nmoney is 80 Behavior\nit's not different\nand so in the sense that our we have to\nteach our children to behave\nwe have to teach them to have discipline\nself-discipline they don't have\nself-control that they're they're going\nto be a horrible spouse\nthey're gonna be a horrible parent to my\ngrandkid uh if they don't have\nself-control they're not gonna be a good\nemployee or a good boss a good leader in\ntheir organization and so they have to\nlearn behaviors at home and we can use\nmoney as one of the things we do that we\nuse to teach them to have behaviors and\nso one of the things we all use had used\non us and we used on our kids was you\nknow you have to do your homework and\nyou have to get good grades well that's\ncontrol self-control and we're gonna\nwe'll walk with you we'll coach you\nwe'll help you if you're struggling we\nsupport you but not doing it is not an\noption you're going to learn to do you\nknow you have to brush your teeth you\nwon't have teeth when you're old you\nneed to brush your teeth that's a good\nthing and so you can't just ignore this\nyou have to bathe because that way\nyou'll get a spouse later and leave and\nso you know you have to we want to teach\nour kids these things right so money is\nthe same way and we teach them age\nappropriately you know when you pick up\nyour toys\nin your bedroom and your three what that\nreally means is is that I picked up all\nyour toys and you picked up two of them\nbut I'm going to give you all the\npsychological and emotional credit and\ngive you a high five as the best room\ncleaner that there ever was on the\nplanet oh and I'm also going to give you\na dollar bill\nto put in your piggy bank over here I\nwant to put your P I want to put that\ndollar bill on you because I want you to\nemotionally associate work\nwith money work is where money comes\nfrom and that's absolutely vital and if\nyou can do that then then you get the\nability to teach them to save and to\nspend wisely you can participate but I'm\nnot I'm going to send a five-year-old\nassault Minds we're not doing that you\nknow but but we are gonna we're gonna\nwhen you're 14 you're gonna do some work\nbecause if you wait till they're 18 to\nstart teaching work ethic they don't\nknow how to do anything yeah and then\nthen some poor soul is going to hire\nthem later and they don't know how to\nwork yeah and so it's a gradual\nparenting is a gradual process like so\nmany good things in life and so\nyou know the the idea that that uh we're\ngonna gradually teach them to work give\nsave spend uh and and if you can teach\nthem to do those things age\nappropriately gradually over time then\nthey've got the character they have the\nthe skeletal structure in their\ncharacter's self-control self-discipline\nthe ability to delay pleasure the\nability to set a goal work towards a\ngoal progressively age appropriately and\nwith some help with some Grace when they\nfall down with some love but not\nhelicoptering in and saving them let\nthem let them feel the pain of the of\nthe struggle it's good because that's\nwhere it all comes from man you get a\ncallus that way and so uh then they're\nready to manage money oh by the way the\nlast step then is that they move from\nthis is how money Works to now it is a\nresponsibility\nmoney is a responsibility you have to\nmanage money for the good of others you\nget to participate in some good things\nby managing it but you're managing it\nfor the good of your family your kids\nyour grandkids you're changing your\nfamily tree and that's what I did and\nthat's why there's some for you in this\ninheritance and a good man leaves an\ninheritance to his children's children\nProverbs and so we're going to do that\nbut you don't get that if it's going to\nharm you and it would harm you if you\ndon't have the skeletal structure the\nmuscle tenue in this area to carry it\nand so when you leave kids that were\nquote in the old days we used to say so\nand so is a spoiled kid if you have a\nspoiled kid and you leave them a bunch\nof money well they're a reality show\nstar later that's what they in that's\ntheir only skill and so they can't do\nanything and it's sad they're sad humans\nand they struggle and then they fall all\ndown all over the place and everybody's\nwatching them do it and they do it with\nbig numbers around them it's awful and\nso\ninstead what we want is we want you know\nthis is a family that that is a family\nof service and this money is a\nresponsibility and if you view it that\nway you will have the opportunity to\nmanage it for the good of others and and\nfor the people of faith for God for the\ngood of God we're going to manage it for\nGod's good and so you know you can have\nthese kinds of ethereal discussions but\nyou had to build the built the character\nalong the way yeah what a what a\nfantastic and phenomenal answer Dave\nbecause\nI made I did an activity recently where\nI sat down and I wrote down all the jobs\nI've had in my whole life and I was\nwriting down what I learned from each\none of them it was a really fun thing to\ndo and I realized that I when I was 14 I\nwas a paper boy in my area so I\ndelivered newspapers in my area and I\ngot paid for it and I remember all the\nother boys would go and throw the papers\nin the trash so the organizers started\ngiving me more money to do all their\nstreets as well and then I worked at\nMorrisons which is our version of\nWalmart it's you know a grocery store\nand then I and then I worked in retail\nand you know so on and so forth and so\nin the last 20 years I've had so many\njobs since I started working and you're\nso right there I remember paying for my\nfirst ever phone bill paying for my car\ninsurance like my parents never paid for\nthose things I had obviously lived in\ntheir home and uh you know was taken\ncare of with shelter and food but beyond\nthat any expenditure was personal and\nI'm so grateful to them for that because\nit set me up for this understanding of\nhow hard it was to make money how hard\nit was to save money and how often as a\nkid I was a bad spender and saw Zero in\nmy bank account and what that felt like\nfrom an anxiety point of view they let\nyou fall down but they never let you\nfall down hard enough that you were\npermanently harmed yes yes just that you\nlearned the lesson and so that's a love\nthat's a loving parent and it's not\nchild abuse to teach a child that money\nis limited it's not child abuse to say\nno\nno is a complete sentence it's not child\nabuse to teach a child to work age\nappropriately so that they can be have a\nsustainable life with dignity it's very\ndifficult to have a sense of dignity if\nyou don't have a sense of power over the\ncontrollables out there and people that\ndon't know how to work have no power\nover those controllables yes yes very\nwell said chapter eight uh Dave you\nspeak about something I mentioned\nearlier wealth and the wealthy are not\nevil you know that has always been a\nstruggle and you had this beautiful\nsentence in the book which you say is\nequal is not fair\nright equal is not fair and and I\nremembered I don't know if you've seen\nthis there's this graphic on social\nmedia that's gone viral a few times it's\nI don't know who made it but it's a\npicture of like three people one's\nshorter one's a bit taller and then\nthere's a really tall person and they're\nall standing on an equal sized block to\nwatch some sports and it says equal is\nit's similar to that where it's like\nequality doesn't work because each of\nthese people need a different set of\nsteps to be able to see this Sport and\nas soon as I read that line in your book\nequal is not fair I thought okay that\nmakes sense to me but to a lot of people\nthat's worrying a lot of people would\nrather wealth be distributed equally and\nand you know figuring that out and\nworking from that perspective but walk\nus through uh your thoughts on why equal\nis not fair and and how we should think\nabout that differently if you throw the\npapers and you actually throw them and\ndeliver them to the people's houses\nand you get paid the exact same as the\nguy who threw them away\nthat's not fair you you provided a much\nmore service to the community\nyou had Integrity you didn't steal\nand the guy who threw them away took\nsomeone else's papers they weren't his\nand he threw them away that's stealing\nand he didn't follow through on his\npromise and he was getting paid for a\nservice he didn't even attempt to do\nthat's also stealing so his lack of\nintegrity\nand and lack of service in the\nmarketplace and to say that those two\npeople should be paid the same is an\nimmoral statement\nequal is not fair\nit would not be fair for that guy to get\nthe same money over time as you got uh\nnow I I would never propose that two\npeople doing the exact same thing and\nproviding the exact same level of\nservice somehow got different because of\ntheir skin color or their sex or\nsomething like that no I we've got folks\nof every background every ethnic origin\nand everything else on our in our\nleadership team and we don't we're\ncompletely blind to all that we're all\nwe want to know inside Ramsey is did you\ndo the job and if you did the job you\nget the money and that's how that works\nand so uh that that's that's the only\nmeasure and but to say that that we're\ngoing to spread it out across the people\nwho did the work didn't do the work who\nwho plowed the field or didn't plow the\nfield who showed up in the when the\nstorm came through and got the tree out\nof the road the other one just sat at\nhome and what and you know and played\nyou know some kind of game on the TV or\nsomething what I mean that's just\ncommunism is what it is at its course\nand he economic system it's not\nname-calling this idea that things are\nequal so we have to eliminate that\nnumber one then once we eliminate that\nthen we start to understand what my\nfriend Rabbi Lapin says Rabbi Lapin is\nan Orthodox Jewish rabbi we become\nreally good friends because I just love\nhis teaching\num like I love yours he says that uh\nmoney comes to people who serve that\nwhen you serve your customers give you\ncertificates of appreciation with\npresidents faces on them and so you know\nthis idea that evil people Prosper no\nthey the percentage of evil people among\nthe wealthy is about the same percentage\nof evil people among the poor\nbecause again money makes you more of\nwhat you already are you're magnified\nand so here's the thing you think about\nif you got a uh a guy that works on cars\nhe has a he has an auto repair shop\nand you go in there and he he Tinkers\naround on the car he says that'll be 150\nand you drive away and the next day your\ncar breaks down again you come back in\nthere you go hey I'll give you 150 you\ncan fix my car he goes I know but it'll\nbe another 150 you know I'm not giving\nyou another 150 and you go back finally\nyou go okay this guy's a crook\nokay or he's incompetent one of the two\nhe doesn't know how to fix my car now\nwhat do you do do you keep going there\nand giving the guy money obviously not\nno you no more than that you go tell\neveryone you know this guy's a crook\ndon't do business with him\nnow does that guy Prosper at the end of\nthe story of course not he goes out of\nbusiness\nover time the marketplace will punish\nhim for his crookedness now\ntake the guy next door who's got an auto\nrepair place you go in there he looks\nunder the hood and he goes oh there it\nis he goes you're okay what do you what\ndo I owe you nothing just remember me\nwhen your car really breaks because I\njust fixed it it's no big deal and your\ndriveway going I found a guy who fixed\nmy car for free and he actually is\nhonest this is a unicorn I'm gonna tell\neveryone about this guy and then this\nguy you know we visit this guy now 20\nyears later he's got a franchise\noperation he's got this color of store\nfixing cars in 56 cities Across America\nhe's worth eight million dollars and now\nhe's evil\nwhat yeah that's absurd the line of\nthinking here the critical thinking\nskills that get you to that are\nnon-existent it's impossible to be a\ncrook and prosper in a free Marketplace\nlong term or to use crookedness as a\nmethod of wealth building because it\nactually works against you so that\nthat's rabbi's you know that's his line\nof thinking on that and that that's\nwhere we go to so yeah there I know evil\npeople that are rich\nbut I know a lot more that are\nunbelievably kind\ngenerous\ngrateful\nthey got more time for you\nthan than and they'll do anything for\nanybody I mean they're just unbelievable\nhumans\nand that's the one I know a lot more of\nthose than I do crooks money is a moral\nit's not about money it doesn't have\nmorals it's about the human being and\nwhen it touches that human it reflects\nwho they are\nDave uh this has been so much fun\ngetting to know you I've always watched\nyou from afar admired you uh you know a\nbig fan follower in me and to sit down\nwith you and to have this conversation\nwith you
