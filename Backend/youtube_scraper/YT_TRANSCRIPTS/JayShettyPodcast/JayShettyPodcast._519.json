thank\nyou for sharing that yeah i'm deeply\nlooking forward to this conversation i\ndo like to remind people of the\nincredible awards and accolades and the\nincredible success that you've achieved\nbecause\nyou've been on your own path to get\nthere it hasn't come to you you've\nmade changes shifts transitions as i\nsaid but i wanted to start off kind of\nhow we did when you first came in\nbecause\ni love that we discovered that you're\naddicted to junk food and sweets and i\ncan relate\nand so i had to ask you what is your\nfavorite junk food to start off with i\nmean i'm like i love taco bell i am a\nfast food i grew up having fast food i'm\na fast food and of course it's the most\naddicting thing in the world\nso very addicted to fast food well you\nsaid to me you had something on the way\nin i had mcdonald's okay uh regrettably\nand i and i said as i was pulling into\nthe drive-through that i'm\nactively hurting my body in my brain as\ni'm participating in this but\nsometimes you need\nfast\nfood i was like i need to i have my\npodcast i need to be\ni'm sure it'll actually be slowing down\nmy brain but\ni needed to\ni needed to eat something it was there i\ncould have stopped into air juan and\ngotten something but i've actually never\nbeen inside an iron in my life so\nyou know we had to keep it real today i\nget it i got off a flight the other day\nand i was exhausted and i had to drive\nhome from the airport and i got myself a\nsprite and i got myself a burger and\nprize on the way home at 10pm\nthat's always you know even when you're\ntrying to make the healthiest decisions\nin the world it's just convenient yeah\nthat's the hardest thing\nanyway you love sweets too and i wanted\nto find out does that mean like sour\ncandy does that mean sweet tooth like\nwhat what is sweet is that chocolate\nsweet i'm not i mean i love ice cream\nokay i love everything\ni love\ni love candy i i love like milk duds are\nmy candy of choice but i love sour patch\nkids\ni love savory ice cream like savory ice\ncream i don't know i don't know if\nthat's the right word actually probably\nnot the right word i just love ice cream\nin general yeah yeah i'm always happy to\nconnect on this these truths because i\nthink as soon as we start talking about\nhealth and wellness everyone everyone\nthinks that you live this perfect life\nand i know i don't too i like i said i'm\nlooking forward to sunday to kind of\nordering my burger and fries but\none of the things that\ni find fascinating about you when we\nwere doing our research is that\nyou started out and you've had multiple\njobs before this\nyou've had multiple different careers\nand things i looked at was like you were\na hostess at a restaurant you worked at\na bakery you're a sales associate a role\nat pier one imports yeah and when i saw\nthat list i was like this is incredible\ntalk to me about what you learned from\neach of those roles in each of those\njobs it's funny because i was literally\na hostess at a restaurant for three\nhours and then i quit because i had a\npanic attack in the bathroom\ni worked at a bakery for one shift five\nhours had a panic attack quit\nfor some reason pier one imports is the\nonly\nit's like the only job that i was able\nto have outside of acting where i didn't\nhave a panic attack although i'm pretty\nsure i did have a panic attack but i\ndidn't quit that one but yeah i mean i\nhad to make money i\ni wanted to pursue my career in la and\nyou obviously need\nfunds to move across the country and do\nso and support myself so\ni i struggled through\na job there it wasn't that it wasn't\nthat bad it was mostly i i know how to\nbreak down boxes really well i worked in\nthe stock room breaking down boxes\nit was fun during christmas time opening\nall i was like it's christmas i'm\nopening all the christmas stuff\nbut i also uh did i was like enjoyed the\ncash register i remember it was so weird\ni i was so used to saying my full name\nfor self tapes like hi i'm lily\nreinhardt i'm however old and i'm\nauditioning for\nso the phone rang at pier one once and i\nwas like this is lily reinhardt and i\njust thought that was the weird like the\nworst i love that i was like this\nperson's probably like\nwho\nthat was such a weird that's really good\ni would think you were really\nprofessional and i was like wow this is\nthis is let me this is my phone\nimpressive yeah can i help you i want to\nknow who lily reiner is yeah very yeah\nvery memorable i'm i'm sure that person\nremembers it\nquite well yeah that would be amazing if\nthat person is watching this or finds\nthis somehow please let us know because\nwe would love to yeah\nlove to discover you yeah talk to me\nabout those episodes i mean to start a\njob and in three hours to have a panic\nattack to have five hours and have a\npanic attack i mean that's you know let\nme know how old you were in both those\njobs but like\nwhat\nwas the cause of that where was that\ncoming from yeah uh how did that happen\ni was 18.\nso i was living in north carolina at the\ntime\nwe had moved from ohio to north carolina\nfor my dad's job when i was 16. so i was\nprepping to move to la and obviously\nneeded to\nhave money to do so so i was trying to\nfind a job\nmy anxiety at that point really stemmed\nfrom\n[Music]\noh my god\nthis is so not what i want to be doing\nbut it's the means to make it happen so\nthe anxiety came from\nthis is absolutely not where i want to\nbe but i know i have to be here because\ni need money i have to make money so the\nanxiety was like don't have money\nneed it\nhave crippling anxiety and can't hold a\njob but i need a job so it was very\nvery isolating and i i've you know i\nhave i've been fortunate enough i have\nreally terrible anxiety but i don't\nsuffer from too many panic attacks but i\nobviously have had them i know how they\nfeel it's the worst thing in the world\nand having those\nin those environments was so awful and\nand i always immediately text my mom\ni don't know how she does it she she has\nbeen very much the person that i turn to\nduring these moments in my life of of\npanic and anxiety she's always at the\nother end of the phone or the other end\nof the skype or the facetime or whatever\ni need her in\nshe's there so i feel very lucky to have\nsuch a grounded\ni'm like if i'm having a panic attack\nyou know amy is gonna know about it\ni really appreciate you sharing this\nbecause i think so many people\ncan relate to that anxiety\ni i remember when i came out of the\nmonastery left india moved back to\nlondon\ntook me about 10 months to get my first\njob\nfinally got a job i was working at this\nyou know big consulting firm i was back\nin the professional corporate world\nwhich is what i would have done if i\nhadn't become a monk and\ni was working at a client where i didn't\nreally understand what we were doing i'd\nbeen out of the working world for like\nfour or five years at that point so\nkind of lost a lot of my training in\nthat world i struggled with small talk\ni'd come back from this and i remember\nfeeling so anxious that i would take the\nlongest lunch breaks like i would\ndisappear from work for like two three\nhours yeah because i just couldn't\nhave those conversations i didn't know\nwhat to do i wasn't very good at my job\nand i remember going up to\nour senior manager at the time and\nsaying to him that i know there's a\nspace for me in this company but i don't\nthink this is the right role or this is\nthe right client because the work we're\ndoing here i feel really a deep lack of\nconfidence yeah and i'm really just\nfeeling anxious yeah\nand the way he responded increased my\nanxiety i was going to say was he\ncomforting no and so i did this you you\ndid three to five hours and you knew\nyourself i lasted two weeks and so this\nis after two weeks\nhe said jay you realize people work\nreally hard to get this job and then\nthey do as they told\nand they don't decide to shift after two\nweeks and he said if you shift after two\nweeks you'll pretty much be ending your\ncareer with us like that's what it's\ngonna be like\nand i just still knew that this was just\nnot where i needed to be yeah and so\nwhat ended up happening was\nthey told the client that we were\nservicing so my company gave services to\na client they told the client that i\nwasn't performing well and so that they\nwere going to let go of me and they\nliterally walked me out of the office as\nif i'd just been fired and i wasn't\nfired i was just let go of that climate\nright right but they made me feel like i\nwas fired so i had to pack my voice\nshame like so painful yeah how did you\ncommunicate you obviously texted your\nmom but how did you communicate how were\nyou received by your\nthe people you worked with the person\nwho was the boss or the owner like how\ndid they respond i mean they didn't know\nme and i didn't know them it wasn't even\nlike a two-week thing that was genuinely\nnice to meet you here's this shift oh\nnow she's quitting right so i genuinely\ndon't even\nknow what their impression was i\nremember the bakery i worked at the man\nthe boss was just very concerned with\ngetting the apron back uh it was like a\nvery like okay well make sure you return\nthe apron i was like okay i will make\nsure the apron gets back to you\num so that was strange did you did you\ngive the apron back i actually don't\nknow if i ever did um sorry but\ni think i felt more shameful about it\ntowards like my parents and and my\nsister my older sister because my my\nlittle sister was young and didn't have\na job but i think i just felt like oh\nlook how pathetic i am i can't even\nlike my anxiety is really that bad i\ncan't even hold down a job when i know\nmy sister at the time was like a\nhard-working waitress\nat at a restaurant and had been for\nmultiple years so i just felt pretty\npathetic\nat the time which is obviously a very\nshameful\nfeeling i mean that's so tough and\nespecially for it to happen twice\nand when you start judging yourself and\nyou start\ncausing pain towards yourself verbally\nor yeah yeah you become internally\nabusive towards yourself and as you said\nyou start comparing yourself to to\nsiblings and and partners or whoever\nelse family that's in your life yeah how\ndid you get the courage to\ntry again when when you've got into such\na dark space of\nand not it's not just a dark space it's\nlike you're actually experiencing\nphysical panic attacks so it's not just\nmental it's physical and mental it's\nemotional yeah how are you still getting\nthe courage to go okay i'm gonna go peer\none input so i'm going to go even in to\nacting of course it was my drive to be\nan actress it's it's something that has\ntruly lived so deep inside me it's the\ncore of who i am um which will come back\nto that because but uh but it was truly\nmy undying ambition and drive to be an\nactress where i knew i needed money i\nneeded money to make this happen\nand\nthe anxiety was just gonna have to i was\ngonna have to find something that i\ncould handle tolerate i think was the\nright the right word you know i\nobviously couldn't be going to work and\nhaving panic attacks every day so i just\nneeded to find something that i could\ntolerate and pier one ended up being a\nsituation where i was working around\nmostly older women which i think also\nsays something about who i am i didn't i\nwasn't comfortable working around these\nyoung people who i felt because i have\nsocial anxiety and at the time it was\npretty bad i was living a very isolated\nlife so being around these young girls\nwho were also there made me feel\neven more out of place and so i found\nmyself more comfortable in a job where i\nwas around middle-aged women who like\nweren't judging me\nweren't necessarily interested in\ntalking to me about my personal life i\njust really wanted my job to be my job i\ndidn't want to make friends i didn't\nwant to create relationships i just was\nthere to make money and then bounce\nbasically\nthat's a great lesson for all of us\nbecause i think we\noften feel that you can get into such a\ndark place then nothing can get you out\nbut what you're saying is actually your\ndrive\nto where you wanted to be and who you\nwanted to be was able to pull you out of\nthat space to try again it was and i'm\nvery thankful very thankful for that i\nnever really gave myself a plan b\ni didn't have\na backup option i knew i was going to be\nan actress i didn't know what my career\nwould look like at all and i still don't\nknow what it's going to look like but\nit's because it's still you know a\nhustle and you're still always always\nworking always but uh\nbut i really\nknew this is my dream\ni have to do what i have to do to make\nthis work and\num i had moved to la when i was 18.\nhad had such bad anxiety while i was\nhere tried to hold down a job in l.a\nwas hired didn't even work a shift had a\npanic attack and quit\nand that was the moment i decided i\nskyped my mom literally hyperventilating\nin a paper bag and said i need to come\nhome i'm not okay because i had been\nthere for five months at the i've been\nhere for five months at the time and\nwasn't making any money and i clearly\ncould not handle the stress and anxiety\nof holding down a job here so moved back\nhome for six months\nwent back to pier one\nworked as many shifts i think i was\nworking two to three shifts a week\nbecause my anxiety could not handle more\nsaved up very little money\nwe're talking like seventeen hundred\ndollars in the span of six months\nbecause i just could not work that much\nbut i moved back to la because there was\nno other option that's incredible thank\nyou so much for going into detail with\nme i know we like really unpacked every\njob in every role\nbut i feel like it's so needed for all\nof us to hear that because obviously\nwhen people see you doing your thing and\nyou know right now you're like executive\nproducing and you're an author and you\nknow you're acting curious booming it's\nlike it's easy to believe that you're\njust confident and you just you know\nit's easy and it's effortless and\nand even today i've met you you're\nyou're wonderful like you have great\npresence you have great energy and it's\nlike it's been so easy to connect with\nyou but\nto hear that that's the journey that it\ntook\nto get\nslightly more comfortable with these\nthings yeah uh is is really useful to\neveryone who's listening and of course\nhard when you're living it but tell me\nabout the role you played in your home\nyou have two sisters i do and you spoke\nto a bit about your mother who i want to\nfocus on in a second but\nwhat was the role you played in your\nfamily like or what is the role you play\nin the family has it changed middle\nchild\ntwo sisters my parents are happily\nmarried after 30 plus years so very\nhappy to have them as beautiful loving\nrole models in my life\ni was the kid who was very stereotypical\nperformer kid did the theater did at\ndancing classes loved recitals loved\nperfor i performed in front of my when\nwe went on big family vacations i would\nmake my cousin sing with me in front of\nthe family\ni was that kid\nand\nlook who was terrible at sports that\nkind of like this kid is meant to be an\nartist for sure\nand\ni\nbegan struggling with anxiety\nat a young age when i was like 11\nas when i got really bad which sounds so\nyoung thinking back on it like i really\nwas feeling such complex anxiety and\nmy parents had no idea where it was\ncoming from\nmy older sister was\nbullied very badly and she\nstruggled with her own issues and so it\nwas sort of like\nvery\nhard for my parents to understand why i\nwas struggling so badly because there\nwere no real external factors\nthat made sense nothing was really\nadding up like oh you have you have\nfriends you\nhave extracurriculars you don't have any\nof these\nany blaring issues it's just\nwhy are you so anxious why do you hate\nschool so much why why are you feeling\nthis way and so\ni felt a lot of isolation\nat that age from the kids around me to\nmy own\nfamily it just felt very misunderstood\nand that's really when i started going\nto\ntherapy for the first time and\ni really don't remember a lot of the\njourney because\ni think you're just so young you only\nremember so many things but also i was\nin such a\na weird tunnel vision stage of your life\nwhere you just are in fight-or-flight\nmode\nand you're not really taking in your\nsurroundings or really living you're\njust surviving\nand\nso it's it's interesting to think back\non those times because i\nbarely remember all i remember is\ncrying before school every morning\nbegging my mom to let me be homeschooled\nbecause i couldn't stomach the idea of\nwalking through the doors and sitting\nthrough an eight-hour day with the\npeople the kids around me everything was\na\ncountdown\nconstantly counting down how many hours\nleft how many hours until this class is\nover when can i go to the bathroom so i\ncan have five minutes to be alone\nwhen can this happen when can i do this\nblah blah blah always counting down to\nsomething so very much not\nliving my life it was always rushing\nthrough it\none of the hardest things about mental\nhealth i feel is that it's invisible\nlike no one can see it yeah no one\nunderstands it and often people feel\nwell you have this so why would you be\nanxious yeah it doesn't add up you have\nthis or then why would you experience\ndepression\nand it's hard when it's your own family\nand you know when you're talking about\nbeing that young it's probably when the\nmental health conversation wasn't as\nopen as it is now not at all where i'm\nhoping today that at least parents are\nhearing about it are more open to the\nfact that they could be providing a\nbeautiful loving atmosphere at home and\na child could still be struggling with\nsomething and i think that's one of the\nhardest things for parents is that it's\nalmost like they see it as a reflection\nof them it's like what am i doing yeah\nwhat's wrong with my kid what did i do\nwhat did i do exactly and and that idea\nof what did i do stops us from thinking\nabout the other and thinking about that\nperson when that's really the moment\nwhere a child is saying i'm struggling\nwith something and and the ego inside\nall of us not just parents the ego and\nall of us goes but no no but that's not\nmy fault like i or i i don't i don't\nknow this can't be right this can't be\nright because i didn't do anything for\nthat it sounds like your parents are\nwonderful right like from what i'm\nhearing yeah and so obviously for them i\ncan imagine it's hard when you start\ngoing to therapy at that young age when\nyou start getting exposed to this when\ndo you start to feel like you're gaining\ntools clarity\ninsight that you're like oh i can cope\nwith this because it sounds like from\nwhat we were talking about\nit's not something that ever goes away\nit's not something that ever just\ndisappears but you start coping better\nyou start managing it better is that\naccurate yeah no for for sure i think\nthe therapy was a really beautiful\nfor one hour a week i was talking to\nsomeone who just got it\nshe was an older woman\ni instantly\nreally loved her and connected with her\ni still felt like it wasn't okay for me\nto be feeling what i was feeling like it\nwasn't justified and maybe i would be\nlooked at as crazy so i remember\neven in my therapy sessions would be\nlike oh god my allergies are so bad as i\nhad tears streaming down my face i'm\nlike girl you're in a therapy office\nyou're allowed to cry\nand it's interesting like the messaging\nfrom when i was a kid to to what it is\nnow is so radically different\ncompared to even you know 20 years ago\nhow insane but even just from\nwhen i was a kid\nbeing i feel like you heard the thing\nyou heard the term don't cry you don't\nneed to cry\ncrying is the most beautiful thing you\ncan do i encourage people to cry i cry\nall the time and i think it's the most\nhealthy expression of how you're feeling\nand i i sometimes wish\ni just could have been told\nyou can cry\nthere's no shame in that there's no\nshame\nin how you're feeling and also you don't\nneed to always be justifying it because\ni think i was constantly trying to come\nup with reasons why\nrather than just\nbeing accepted for what it was i have\nanxiety i have depression okay but why\nwell sometimes\nthere isn't\na\nand and navigating that space when i was\nso young and trying to defend myself\nhaving my first panic attacks and not\nknowing\nwhat this feeling was how i could escape\nit\nwhat resources i had you know i was too\nyoung to really be going on the internet\nlooking for\nhelp elsewhere i just really had like my\nparents and i guess the kids around me\nat school who had no idea what to tell\nme or how to help you know my friends at\nthe time it's not like they\ngot it they just didn't so i was so\nisolated and i'm happy that now this is\na space we're moving into where\nwe are saying\nfeel your feelings\nand that\nthey're they're justified you don't need\nto defend\nyourself i'm like damn that's the kind\nof environment i want to raise my future\nkids in to where it's it is a beautiful\nthing to cry and you're allowed to\nfeel you're just allowed to feel\nif everyone would just listen to that\nover and over and over and over and over\nagain every day like our lives would be\nso much better because\ntelling someone not to cry\nis like telling someone not to laugh\nadvice right like the worst advice it's\nit's such bad advice and because yeah\nlike telling someone not to cry is like\ntelling someone not to laugh that's a\nfeeling there's a natural expression\nthat needs to be released in order to\nfeel an emotion and you're being told to\nblock it and not feel it you would never\ndo that with any other emotion but when\nit comes to crying and especially as a\nman too you know that's a big part of\nhow boys are boys don't cry boys don't\ncry right and boys never cry and you\nknow you'll be fine you're okay there's\nnothing wrong\nand so it's like oh if i cried that\nmeans there's something wrong\nand that association of crying is bad\nis actually the biggest issue so toxic\nyeah it's so toxic that crying becomes a\nnegative emotion yeah so now when i cry\ni feel sad\neven if crying was going to actually\nmake me feel better which it does\nusually it does yeah yeah and we cry\nwhen there's happy tears too yeah at the\nend of the day it's a release yes and\nthere are so many things that need to be\nreleased from the body the mind the\nheart\nand\neverything you just said i i wish\neveryone would just listen to that part\nagain and again and again and play it to\ntheir children and play it to their\nfamily members because\nif that's all you take out from this\nconversation it will change your life\nand i know there's so many more but but\nthat was true truly truly powerful oh\nsorry going no i mean i just to kind of\ngo deeper into that i feel\nthe last two years have been a very\nlarge\nspiritual awakening for me\nuh really became\nawakened to the spiritual side of life\nand really what wellness means and i\nthought i\nknew who i was before and was\nconfident but really i was\nso much of my identity was based off of\npleasing other people and\nputting my identity in other people's\nhands and\nthe concept i read a lot of self-help\nbooks uh you know did a deep discovery\non all those things and and the biggest\ntakeaway i was gathering was\nhow vital it is to sit with your\nfeelings\nand experience them which again just\ngoes along you know the concept of don't\ncry you not you're pushing it away\nrather than doing the opposite which is\nhow you heal\ni was on a very big healing journey two\nyears ago which is how this all really\nstarted and\nthe biggest thing i kept reading was\nfeel like feel your feelings sit there\nand let the feeling be in your body ex\nlike let it flow through you observe it\ndon't judge it\nlet it happen as it needs to to happen\nlet it flow through you and\nso that's what i\nthat's what i did and that's what i\nmy perspective has changed quite\ndramatically over even the last couple\nmonths and\ni sort of look at things this way as\nsomeone who\nvery much struggles with anxiety and\ndepression when i feel very overwhelmed\nby those things and sort of like i'm\nbeing burdened by these things\ni like to think of it as\nif i started out as this celestial being\nthis just energy\nand the universe or god or whomever\nsaid hey\ndo you want to go to earth\nfor an incredibly short amount of time\nlike a blip\nand experience every emotion that you\ncould possibly feel as a human\nyou get to have all these experiences\nlove heartache anxiety joy euphoria\nwhatever all of it\ndo you want to do that\nyeah i do\nand so when i am feeling these intense\nfeelings\nit's sort of like a reality check to\nstep outside and say\nalthough this is a very uncomfortable\npainful feeling\nit's quite beautiful\nthat i have the capacity\nto experience it\njust in general like i\nam so lucky\nto feel to the extent that i feel and to\nfeel as deeply as i feel because it can\noften feel like a curse\nwhen you're having a heartache and you\nknow when you're experiencing love it's\nabsolutely euphoric and then when it's\nthe opposite it's a curse\nand so\nunderstanding that both of those exist\nin the same timeline and in the same\nlife\nand\nthat is sort of something that i use to\nground myself when i am\nstuck in a feeling of\ndarkness\nthat is probably the best description of\nthat i've heard before\nthe idea of\nif we were given the choice to have this\ndiverse set of emotions experiences\nfeelings and what you rightly said was\nthat\nif you're experiencing loss\nit means you've experienced love yeah\nand if you've experienced pain\nit means you've experienced joy yeah it\nactually means that you've had the\nfortune yeah of\nreceiving a glimpse of greatness yeah\nand\ni lost my mentor to stage four brain\ncancer\nand i lost him a few years before that\nbecause of how brain cancer works in the\nsense that he wasn't mentally mentally\nthere even though he was spiritually\nthere yeah\nand\nwhat i always referred to him as which i\nfound fascinating was\nso when someone has staged for brain\ncancer obviously they start to lose\naspects of their memory they start to\nlose aspects of identity\nand\nhis memory became so short he had\nlong-term memory he lost his short-term\nmemory so if he'd see me he'd be like\nhey jay how's it going and then 30\nseconds later be like hey jay how's it\ngoing is if he just seen me so he'd\nstill know i'm jay and he'd still\nremember our relationship for many many\nyears\nbut in the moment he you couldn't have\nattention\nbut what i found fascinating was that\nall he did was thank people for their\nservice to god oh wow so all he'd do if\nhe saw you and he was a he was a\ncommunity leader he was he was a priest\nin his own right and\nif he saw you'd be like thank you for\nwhat you're doing for others thank you\nfor your service wow and i was like how\nspecial was that that that was his\nbroken loop was gratitude that's the\nmost wholesome thing i've ever heard\nliterally and and to experience that was\njust unbelievable and it's what you're\nsaying that\nyes i miss him\nand yes of course i wish he was there i\nfeel like calling him up every day to\ntell him what i'm doing and different\nthings that happened in my life but the\nfact that i can experience that i miss\nsomeone yeah means that i just had\nsomething really special yeah i'm not\nsaying that makes it easy i'm saying\nthat it reaffirms the point that you're\nmaking that\nwe're fortunate to have both experiences\nbecause they only come together yeah and\ni do think no one really talks about how\npeople leave your life\nyou know what death is you know people\nare gonna die but you don't really\nuntil i think you're in your 20s\nhonestly experience how often people\ncome and go\njust in general\nand\nit's loss it is grief it's not death but\nit's but it's loss and how profound of a\nfeeling that is and\ni almost wish and i don't know what this\nlooks like or what the teachings look\nlike or what the advice is but just that\nthere could be more of a conversation of\nwhen you are growing up like people are\ngonna come and go and let's\nfind ways to\naccept that because i think\nthe last two years i've had\nwhat feels like a revolving door of\npeople in my life new people that i've\ntried to make connections with and then\nthey leave or people that i've been\nmaybe not make a connection with so\nthere never really is one and then the\nthe relationship kind of just ends\nbut but you know there have been\nobviously meaningful relationships that\ncome in and then they end\nand so it's weird because you are going\non this journey of\nloss and grief but it's not death and\nthe person still exists\nand they have their\ntheir own conscious mind that you're\nsort of trying to figure out well how\nare they experiencing this because in in\ndeath the person's just gone and you can\nthink whatever thoughts you have and\nthey're yours and no one can take those\naway from you\nwhereas when someone leaves your life\nand they're still around it's like oh\nthere's two sides to this story and what\nis this person's experience and i just\nthink that's like a very interesting\nconcept is how do you\ndeal with\nthe loss of someone who's still around\nyeah especially when we've been\ntrained in society to believe that\nlength of time equals success\nyeah or that's the measure of love\ncorrect yeah that the measure of love\nthe measure of success is important\nlongevity yeah length we know plenty of\npeople that have been in a job for 25\nyears that they hate yeah or have been\nin a relationship for 15 years that they\ndon't love right and you constantly find\nthat but also what you're saying i think\nmore deeply the idea that\nwe actually deal with coming and going\nand the seasons of relationships far\nmore\nand it's like we know that when it's\nwinter you put on a coat right and we\nknow when it's summer you get to put\nyour shorts on and when it's\nspring you may carry if you're in london\nespecially you carry an umbrella and if\nit's fall you get to wear fall colors\nlike you know it's like with the seasons\nof nature\nwe know how to adapt our clothing our\npreparation but not with the seasons of\nlife absolutely it just doesn't happen\nlike you don't you don't ever talk about\nthe winter of life no it's what you're\nsaying if you talk about loss or death\nor grief as the winter of life yeah\nyou don't ever talk about it and then\nyou're unprepared yeah i feel very\nill-equipped\ngenuinely and and as i've been in my the\nlast two years dealing with so much of\nit\ni'm like there's got to be\nsome solutions out here there's got to\nbe people who are talking about it\nbecause\ni know i'm you know not the only woman\nin their 20s who's going through cycles\nof relationships and and meeting new\npeople and then having\nthose people uh leave or me choosing to\nleave so\nit's like uh\ncome on guys let's rally and and\nbrainstorm and be there for each other\nbecause i don't want to turn to google\nand read stupid articles that tell me\nthat when someone leaves your life you\nshould go on a hike\nbecause if someone tells me to go on a\nhike one more time\ni'm like\nuh okay\nthis is what people say they say when\nsomeone leaves your life when when\nsomething when you're going through\nsomething pick up a new hobby\noh\nokay\nsure i'll do that and that'll take up\nthree seconds of my time and probably\nlike 400 to buy all this equipment for\nthis new hobby whatever it is maybe i'll\ntry crocheting and you know all of a\nsudden i'm spending 300 and all these\nthings and it lasts two seconds it's\nlike there's\nthere's got to be\nwhat else can i be doing\nyeah so what i'm personally been dealing\nwith is the struggle of\nwhat is my identity outside of\neverything else what is my identity\noutside of\neveryone else so just me\nand outside of work because i'm a\nworkaholic and i\nsince i was a kid\nas a survival\nbecause a coping mechanism had to\nbasically make acting\nmy identity\nto push me out of the situations that i\nwas in and launch me into my career so i\nfeel that i have been in fight-or-flight\nmode\nfor most of my life\nand\nwhat that has done to my\nbrain and my body\nmy mental well-being is\nif i continue at this rate catastrophic\nyou know i will lose my brain power\nthere's no way humans are not meant to\ncontinue living in that state of\nyour adrenaline is always going\nyou know just that fight-or-flight\nresponse and i'm basically on this\njourney right now in my life of\ntrying to calm that down and\ntrying to just simply exist\nand\nsit in stillness\nwithout\nfeeling like i need to fill a void\nand that is the biggest\nthat has been like waking up with\nanxiety i'm not working this summer i'm\nnot filming anything i'm promoting my\nmovie\nvery thankful for that um you know i\nhave my own production company so i'm\nyou know i'm doing a lot of i do a lot\nof zooms i do all the things but\nthere are days where i have nothing to\ndo that's amazing well that's the\nchallenge is is where i'm thinking what\ndo i do\nwith myself because i have been\nprogrammed to constantly\ngo\npick up a new hobby go on a hike yeah\nlet me do that i'm gonna do that\num besides that i'm like how do i find\nserenity\nand acceptance and peace\nwithout running away from myself because\neven\nand i'm stopping myself in these tracks\nbecause the past\nweek i've had such bad anxiety about not\nworking and and being bored the fear of\nbeing bored has been\nhaunting me and i've been thinking what\ntrips can i go on okay i'm gonna reach\nout to like literally everyone i know\nwhen are they available i'm filling my\ni'm looking at the calendar on my phone\ngoing i oh i'm alone that day need to\nfill that up like genuinely how can i\nfill my time so i'm not alone because\nloneliness equals\nmy existential crisis thoughts and i'm\ngoing to spiral yeah\nso\ni'm very much on that journey of\nbecause i know i don't want that\ni do not want that i do not want to be\nsomeone who has to fill that void i\npride myself on being someone who will\nnever\njust succumb to that and be the person\nwho always has to have friends around or\nalways needs to be doing something i\ndon't want that that's not the identity\nthat i want i want to be able to be okay\nby myself\nand\nthat's a really hard thing to do\nyeah it's sort of like\nhow do you do that\nbut even hearing you verbalize and\nvocalize it is so powerful right like\neven to have that as an aspiration yeah\nis an unbelievable power\nbecause it's a recognition of\nyour true feelings going back to what we\nwere speaking about before you're\nactually responding to\nand listening to how your body mind and\nheart feel\nand so you're already making so much\nprogress because\nif you weren't listening then you would\nbe going against the advice that we\nshould be allowed to cry and we should\nbe allowed to do this and so you're\nsaying well\ni just need to take the next three\nmonths or however long it is off\nbecause that's what i'm feeling i need\nand even if you don't know yet what that\nlooks like you're still deeply\nresponding to that need\nand so i think there's a real power in\nthat\nbecause identifying it as one thing then\nimplementing it which you are is another\nthing yeah and then as you said building\nyour identity as this new identity is\nalmost like step three\ni want to dive into that and how we do\nthat with you and how you have found\nways of doing it because i'm guessing\nthat you've had glimpses\nin these last two years\nwhere you have felt at peace with\nyourself or you have had moments where\nyou recognize the value of solitude over\nloneliness or there are moments where\nyou're starting to realize you said in\nyour own words i don't want to live\nbased on the opinions of others or for\nothers so there are glimpses of\nwhat this looks like\nand you're piecing together the puzzle\nbut you were saying that you know you're\ngoing through this transition\nin your life right now\nand our identity gets wrapped up in\nother people our jobs our work\neverything around of us and so when\nyou're saying you're trying to\nunderstand your identity beyond this\nas lily ran out today\nwho are you beyond those things right\nnow\nit's a process for me if\ni'm trying to take it\nday by day because i\noverwhelm myself by trying to fix it all\nright away i'm a very all or nothing\nperson and i'm a very compulsive person\nlike once i find out what's wrong oh god\ni have a solution immediately\ncan't i don't want to wait for time yeah\ni don't want to that's the worst when\npeople say just give it time no i don't\nwant to do that but i would like to do\nit right now yeah to be honest\ni was just in maui recently and\none of the most beautiful moments i had\nthere was when i was in a very spiritual\nuh\nit was like a spiritual shop they had\ncrystals they had\nbut they had a labyrinth\nlike a maze on the ground that that you\ncould walk in and just sort of it was\nthis it took you like\na good 15 minutes to walk through all\nthe little pathways and then you get you\nget to the center and you can meditate\nor\nand then you can and then you walk out\nand it's it's a it's there was like a\nwhole\nbook about about the ideology behind\nthis labyrinth and and i didn't i didn't\nread\nit but i but i took it as an opportunity\nto use it as just like a\njust meditating a moment of meditation\nand\ni felt so close to myself\nwhen i was doing that\nlike\nit was\nso true to who i was in that moment to\njust be doing this activity\nit was so comforting\nit's hard just like anything you can\nlose yourself in something you know you\ncan lose yourself and\nbecoming overly like\nawakened and your whole identity becomes\ni'm a spiritual guru and i'm\nhealing like all about heal like it's so\neasy to just fall into that trap\nand i'm obviously trying not to do that\nas well and i'm definitely not but i my\nfriends wouldn't would never\nnever let me do that but\nbut i do find so much\ntherapy\nthrough\neven just talking about it even if i\ndon't have the answers yeah i don't have\nthe answers to\nwho really am i outside of\nmy fight-or-flight mode and who who am i\noutside of being an actor i don't really\nhave the answers to those questions but\njust even\nsaying that out loud makes me feel like\ni'm closer to figuring it out and i\nreally appreciate that honestly because\ni agree too like i'm i'm hearing you\nspeak and and it feels the same way to\nme where i'm like\nokay you're not\nforcing yourself at least in this moment\nto arrive at an answer or to give an\nanswer to\ncomplete the sentence but at the same\ntime i'm i'm seeing a self-awareness i'm\nseeing a\nacceptance of that path and that's\nwhat's so useful and you are right that\nif you've never allowed yourself to be\nyourself how would you know how to\ndescribe it so if i asked you to\ndescribe yourself as an actress you'd be\nable to describe yourself it would be\npretty easy because you've been an\nactress plenty of times or you could\ndescribe those roles that you've played\nbut then when someone asks you who are\nyou to pretty much 99.9 of people on the\nplanet we can't answer because we've\nnever actually let ourselves be\nourselves so it's not alien to not know\nyeah well i think we we know who we are\nin relation to other people yeah into\nthings\nyeah\n100 but then when you take like take the\nroles away\nwhat are you yeah like whoa\ni do not know\ni do not but that is the beginning of\nfiguring it out like that's yeah that's\nbecause you now can go okay am i playing\nlily the actress\nor am i playing\nlily the daughter friend whatever or am\ni trying to discover what lily would do\nyeah right and it's and it is that\nconversation of it's kind of like with\nmy sister when i'm giving her\nrelationship advice and she'll be like\nstop being j shetty like you know be my\nbrother\nright and it's like that's what my\nsister would say to me because she\ndoesn't want a\ncoaching conversation with her brother\nshe wants me to be her brother\nand so then i'm like okay so she gets\nthe brother version and then there's\nthis version that\nthis community gets but then it's like\nbut then who am i beyond all of those\nthings and i really realized that when\ni left the monk hood because even so\nmuch of my identity had become wrapped\nin being a monk\nand the whole point of being a monk was\nto not have an identity that you're\nwrapped up in yeah that was the whole\ngoal everything you're talking about is\nexactly what we were working on when i\nwas there for three years\nbut even then it was so easy to get\nwrapped up in another identity and so\nwhen that identity collapsed after three\nyears when i\nwhen it all fell apart for me\nthat was when i allowed myself to learn\nabout who i was beyond that identity and\neven now i have to hold on to that how'd\nyou do it\ni'd say that the first of it was a a\nsense of\nand this sounds painful but and it is\nthere is a sense of\nrole destruction yeah\nlike panic panic and\nfeeling something and a part of you that\nyou\nuse for safety to dissolve\nand that's the hardest part it's hard to\nlet go of\nthe false identity because it's a sense\nof safety that being a monk is a sense\nof safety being an actor is a sense of\nsafety being whatever is a sense of\nsafety and unless you're willing to go\ni'm letting that safety go\nto some degree it's very hard to say\nokay well i'm open to what this is so\nthat was the first part it was like\nletting go of that identity externally\nin my language\nin my intellectual thoughts about who i\nwas in how i thought people perceived me\nand then the next step was saying\nrather than who am i was who do i want\nto be\nso what i realized was we're trying to\nfigure out who we are rather than create\nwho we are yeah and we do this as humans\nwe go into finding and seeking\nrather than creating and being\nand finding and seeking is the\nnever-ending journey because there's\nnothing to look for there is only things\nto be and create\nand so i realized that everything i was\ncurrently being and creating was based\non values i'd adopted from family\nfriends or society so i literally made a\nlist of what are my current values\ni then asked myself where did they come\nfrom and so it was like my parents\nsome kid in school who bullied me my\nteacher who told me i wasn't this or\nthat\na friend who thought i was cool or\nuncool based on whatever and then i\nasked myself do i still have that value\ndo i still want to live that value\nand so i shifted to creating a new list\nof values and principles that i wanted\nto live by and i just started practicing\nthem yeah with everyone i met\nand that's how i started to create and\nbe my new identity\nrather than subscribing to an old one if\nthat makes sense it's a very quick\nversion no it makes perfect sense\nbecause i\nrecently have been having those\nthoughts to myself as like who have i\nreally\nif i were to explain myself describe\nmyself in a couple words there are\ncharacteristics that i use that i don't\nactually like\ni don't like\nbeing a negative person but i think i\nwould describe myself\ni or i used to\ndescribe myself as a negative person as\na pessimist as a full realist\nnot entirely hopeful kind of person\nand recently\nwas thinking well\ni don't like that i don't i don't\nactually if i had the choice i would\nchoose to not be that person i would not\ni don't want to be a negative person i\ndon't want to be a pessimist\nbut it's safety yes it's not getting my\nhopes up it's protecting my heart it's\nshelter\nand\nhow do you\npart ways with something that you have\nidentified with for so long and that's\nobviously a challenge in itself but it's\nsomething that\ni'm very much\ntrying to do even with my food choices\nlike someone who has enjoyed\nreally food that's really terrible for\nyou your whole life and now making that\nconscious effort to\nchange that and and fuel my body and\ntreat my body in a better healthier way\nit's it's all just\nmaking these conscious decisions of oh\ndo i i'm just fully an autopilot right\nnow just choosing the same thing because\nthat's what i've always done oh i'm just\nbeing pessimistic because that's what\ni've always done and it takes\npausing and reflecting and making an\nactive effort\nto shift that behavior and that's so\nhard it's so hard we're simply living\npatterns yeah right that's that's\nliterally as simple as it is it's like\nwe've adopted a pattern\nand now we have to choose to practice a\nnew pattern based on who we want to be\nand that's why i think the journey of\nwho am i is really who do i want to be\nwho do i want to create\nwho do i want to live as because\nwe've never known who we are so trying\nto figure out who we are is is a fool's\nerrand because you just\nkeep getting stuck and then like you\njust said now you accept oh i'm a\nnegative person because that's who i've\nalways been not realizing it's just a\npattern you developed it's just a habit\nyou adopted it's just what you\nabsorb through your environment\nas opposed to selected it that's truly i\nmean it's such a profound thing that's\njust like settling into my brain now is\neven the last couple days been thinking\ni need to find out who i am like find i\nneed to find it i need to search for it\nrather than\ni will never get anywhere if i do that\nit's a matter of\nwho do i want to be and then\nactively doing that yeah and selecting\nthose values selecting those principles\nselecting the habits like you just gave\nfor your food\nit's like if you just said who am i\nyou'd i'd be like yeah i'm someone who\nloves chocolate like i'm someone who\nloves ice cream i'm someone who loves\njunk food fast food\nbut that's not who i am that's just a\npattern i built and i can change that\npattern yes it's hard i'm i and i'm i'm\nwith you on that like it's been when i\nmet my wife she's the one who\ntransformed my diet because i was always\nsomeone who is focused on mastering the\nmind and i kind of neglected the body\nand kind of didn't care\nand my wife is a nutritionist and\ndietitian and iratic chef and so her\nwhole world is food quite convenient\nvery convenient hugely convenient if you\nwant to change your life wow yeah and\nand it was like she got me off refined\nsugar she got me off the wrong oil she\ngot me off like packaged and processed\nfoods on a daily basis and it was so\nmuch education and so much coaching that\ni received from her\nthat allowed me to make transitions\nwhere i the first thing i said to her\nwas like i don't know how i would live\nwithout sugar yeah like i don't know\nyeah and it sounds ridiculous now but\nit's like yeah when i got married six\nyears ago and i was like yeah i don't\nknow what you want me to do and then we\nstarted looking for alternatives and and\nnow if you ask me i pretty much would\neach like\ni guess refined sugar maybe like once a\nmonth oh and and so that's amazing and\nthat's amazing for me like that's a big\nthing for me\nbecause i didn't know i grew up eating\nfour chocolate products a day my mom\ngave me a chocolate biscuit chocolate\nbar a chocolate yogurt and a chocolate\nice cream every day and i was addicted\ninto sugar yeah and so\nit's pattern formation though and yes\nyou're so right it requires discipline\nit's painful it's it's hard but i love\nthat that's dropped for you like and i\nlove that you took us there today\nbecause\ni think too many people are finding and\nlooking and seeking and searching and\nit's being and creating and building and\nforming yeah which is where our energy\nneeds to go because you've seen yourself\nbuild a career\nyou've seen yourself create\nyour your roles you've seen yourself\ncreate a book you've seen yourself\ncreate a show like you created those\nthings you didn't find them very true\nyou didn't search for them you didn't\nseek them so you know you have creative\nenergy and creative power yeah like damn\ngotta create myself now yeah\nhow exciting it is very exciting and\nthen there's a sense of selection and\ncontrol and\nnot controlling a control freak way but\nin a sense of like i can choose yes yeah\ni can make\nthe choice and and my first step was\ndefinitely the epiphany of\noh wait i actually don't want to keep\nidentifying with this\nyeah\nyeah were you\nalways\nyou use the word spiritual\nwas that a word in your vocabulary\nalways did it arise two years ago like\nhow did that become a path to a lot of\nthis healing and journey that you've\nbeen on as opposed to something else\nlike i think there's so many options\nyeah yeah why this why\ni mean i grew up christian uh it was i\nwent to a presbyterian church which i\ndefinitely do not uh align with those\nteachings anymore but i do believe in\ngod i i do call myself a christian but i\nalso call myself very spiritual and i\nthink\ntwo years ago\nthe the lockdown was was forcing me to\ngo through this\nthis healing journey\nby myself and\nmy journey through healing was through\nspiritual healing\nand\nthrough\nworking with actual healers and\nand energy and i studied and i started\nto study reiki and i'm\ngonna get my math my masters i mean i'm\ngonna going to be a reiki master yes at\nthe end of the summer that's amazing\nthank you\nso it became a\ni'm going to look inward is sort of what\nwhat it was and i found that that became\noh that's clearly a very spiritual route\nyou're looking in towards your spirit\ntowards your soul you're doing shadow\nwork soul-searching so i was like okay\nokay\nspirituality is the word that i'm\nresonating with and i i actually went to\nmount shasta\nwhich which is a very high vibrational\nhighly spiritual place in northern\ncalifornia and i went there by myself\nand i worked with a\nshe calls herself a sound healer\nuh and i and i worked with her and found\nthe experience\ni just again felt i felt very much like\ni was\nso at home with myself while i was doing\nthose things so connected to myself\nconnected to my higher self the person\nthat i want to be\nand so i thought yes this is the right\npath for me\nand so kind of ever since then i've been\nvery into\nspirituality and you know i've always\nloved crystals everyone's crystals but\nlike looking past that into a deeper\nform of energy healing and that led me\nto\nreiki which led me to\nsound healing and going to sound baths\nand and then meditation and\nand i took a course and i learned tm\ntranscendental meditation which wasn't\nreally\nthe it didn't super resonate with me it\nhasn't stuck with me but it is something\nthat i tried so it's been a\ntrial you know trial of just different\nthings and\nuh\ni guess that's just what i call when i\nsay i'm spiritual i'm i'm on that\nvery\nuh personal journey with myself looking\ninward yeah sort of what i mean by that\nyeah but i but i love those examples\nbecause it is a practicing of different\nmethods and techniques to find what\nworks for you and you've obviously found\nyou know both in reiki and sound healing\nwhat what really suits your\nsoul and your your healing which i think\nis such an important part of it i think\nspirituality or\nhealing or any of these terms can often\nget\nthey're so big yeah and they can get a\ngood or bad name based on a particular\npractice and the idea is that\nit's just such a big umbrella term for\nso many practices\nthat it's so important that people keep\nan open mind to finding what works for\nthem and you're right there may be a\ncertain aspect that just doesn't you\nknow float your boat and doesn't make\nyou feel great but there's other parts\nthat could reveal it to you you know\nvery powerfully i think\nwhen i lived as a monk we traveled a lot\nin southern india where a lot of temples\nare around\ntwo to five thousand years old\nand i never had been anywhere that old\nlike my school was 500 years old that i\nwent to in england and so that was\npretty old yeah but then when you go\nmine was like 80 years old yeah yeah\nyeah\nmy school is literally 15 73 i think was\nthe year it was found oh my gosh by the\nqueen\nyeah and so our school was pretty old\nand had this big history but\nwhen i when i went to these temples that\nwere like two thousand five thousand\nyears old and you see this incredible\narchitecture it's you know it's\nmaintained\ni never realized that i found going on\npilgrimage to be so\ndeeply healing for me\nbecause i would go into these\nchambers where\nsound\nsimilarly has been\nmaintained and preserved for thousands\nof years people have meditated chanted\nplayed\nballs uh gongs whatever maybe in these\nspaces and you can still feel the\nreverberation when you walk in\nand it's and it's really powerful like\nit really feels like you know and so\nagain that was something that i never\nwould have known growing up in london\nand\nyou know having to go to that experience\nand those temples are mainly in southern\nindia\nit sounds like i need to go to southern\nindia yeah where you see that like real\nancient history of of uh spirituality in\nin southern india and so those kind of\nplaces for me were like things that i\nnever thought i'd discover and\nand then there's parts that i'm like\nyeah i would never go and do xyz so\nhow did you find these things or were\ntheir friends were their recommendations\nwas it the internet like how were you\ndiscovering certain things for you\nbecause i feel like that's quite\ndifficult for people to\nyeah to find i mean it's easy in l.a yes\nbecause you're surrounded by people who\nare\nyou're there's a crystal shop on every\ncorner genuinely and it's a tarot card\ntruly and i think i was always like\noh tarot is interesting that happened\nyou know a couple years ago bought my\nfirst tarot deck and\nreiki actually my a makeup artist on\nriverdale who worked on the first and\nsecond season she was a reiki master and\nshe was telling me about it and one day\nperformed reiki on me and i was like\nwhoa this is so cool and so i was always\nsuper interested in diving into that and\nthen the lock down just kind of gave me\na boost to explore that because i was\nlike damn i could use some healing maybe\ni should heal myself\nand then it also just came from\ni think the word wellness like what is\nwellness and i\ngoogled\nwellness retreats in california\nand i was like okay maybe not a retreat\ni don't really want to be doing yoga and\neating vegetables for a week like not\nnecessarily my vibe i wanted to be a\nlittle bit more\npersonalized and grounding for just me\nand i found\nmy sound healer in mount shasta and so i\nwent and saw her by myself and\nreally kind of had a first-hand\nexperience of\nsound healing and past life readings and\ncord cutting ceremonies and\nnot astral projection but just sort of\nyour astral bodies and things like that\nit was like this world that was suddenly\nopening up to me that was so i've always\njust found\nthis\nkind of the the afterlife i guess very\nfascinating i've always\nbeen terrified and intrigued at the idea\nof ghosts and like what what are what's\nthat like what is\ntalking to a spirit you know it's so\nweird and\ni've always felt like i've been very\nhighly intuitive\nkind of in tuned person oh i see symbols\nand i see\nthings are very serendipitous and\nthere's not there's all these\ncoincidences that are happening and and\nso i uh also was looking into\nand to be honest tick tock was\nbad that was not what i was expecting i\nwas not expecting but there is such a\nspiritual side of tick tock that is so\nvast can you put me onto that side yes i\nmean it's the algorithm you start seeing\none video and then you're seeing a\nmillion of them and\nand i\nwas stumbling on these pages of just\nlike highly intuitive\npeople\nand i reached out to one of them and\nsaid do you offer\nmentorships or something and she said\nyeah and so i did a mentorship with a\npsychic for three months where she\ntaught me\nhow to\nheal my\nancestral trauma and\ni believe we all have psychic abilities\nit's a matter of training your brain\nsome people are just born being more\nin tune and tapped into that skill but i\ndo believe that we all have the ability\nto tap into them so i was really just\ntrying to learn how to do that because i\nthought that was so fascinating\nshe did teach me how to talk to the\ndeceased\nnot that i can do it well i will say\ni've only i feel that i've only\nsuccessfully done it\nlike twice or three times and even then\nwhile you're doing it you're sort of\nlike am i doing this like most people\nwhen they would hear these things\nthere's judgement about oh yeah that's\njust wacky or that's whatever like and\nbut what i'm seeing in you which i'm\nappreciating is just hey i'm trying to\nbe me like i i'm right now i'm exploring\nthis\nright now i'm experimenting with this\ni'm learning this yeah\nmaybe it's something that i believe is\ntrue maybe it isn't but\ni'm at least doing what i want to do now\nyeah without worrying about what\neveryone else thinks and believes yeah i\nmean when i chose to become a monk at 21\ngoing on 22\n99 of my friends thought i was\nabsolutely insane because they're like\nwhy would you do that like why would you\nnot want to go make money and\ndate more women and get into another\nrelationship and get a home or whatever\nit was and so i know what it feels like\nto make a decision that most people\naround me feel\ndoesn't make any sense and is completely\nagainst the grain of but it was the best\ndecision i ever made in my life yeah and\ni have zero regrets about that decision\nor how i spent that three years\nand i look back at it all the time and\nbut at the time everyone around me\nthought i was making the worst decision\nmy family said i was committing career\nsuicide\nyou know my friends were completely\nconfused my society and people in our\ncommunity were like oh you're letting\nyour parents down you'll never get a job\nagain you know there's just so much\njudgment yeah\nbut i was just trying to do what felt\nright\nin my intuition at this time and it\nwasn't harming anyone and i think that's\nthe\nyou know that to me is like the the\nbarrier where it's like well you're\ntrying something it's not harming anyone\nyeah it's harming you it's not harming\nanyone around you and\nif if that's allowing you to explore a\npart of yourself you just never know\nwhere it could go so it's very\ncomforting for people to hear about\nbeing into unique things because\nwe all it's almost like we all followed\nthe same people\nwe all watched the same thing yeah and\nthere's nothing wrong with that but it's\nnice to have a few things break from\nthat\nexactly a break from the norm i want to\ntalk to you about\na bit about you know this this new show\nand we were talking about this\nidea of you get to play these two\nparallel lives which kind of with\neverything you're talking about yeah\nit's interesting yeah connected\nand\ni love that idea of parallel universes\nof multiple lives of the multiverse\nright now is a big such a big thing big\nthing and a big talking point\nwhen you're playing these roles\nhow much of these roles are you\nidentifying with especially i guess like\nmoving to la for a career that's very\nmuch in line with you yeah uh and then\nobviously becoming a pregnant mother\nhave an experience yeah when you have an\nexperience like\nwhen you're doing that\nhow much of what you've just talked\nabout that you're interested in kind of\nfeeds into those roles and when you're\nplaying those roles and becoming these\nnew identities well for the i mean for\nthe film people are people ask like was\nit so hard to play two\ntwo different characters no that's the\nsame woman so it's the same girl just\nexperiencing two very different things\nand so that was\namazing to play\nthis this woman and i know who she was\nand i created her as a character i knew\nwhat she valued what she wanted and i\nwas you know were fortunate enough as an\naudience to see both things play out it\nis weird because i\ni'm very into i do have those\nexistential like if i did make this\ndecision what would have happened yeah\ndeciding and how you know how how would\nthings have panned out\nand the reason why i loved the script so\nmuch when i read it was\nshe's okay in both lives she ends up\nbeing okay wow and there is no one path\nthat you go oh that was the right path\nor that was the wrong path it's truly\njust two different paths and i think\nespecially in your 20s things happen\nevery day relationships end things you\nknow people\nyou can get pregnant and you think oh my\nwhole life is just\ngone or my whole world is shifting\nand i don't think that's always a i\ndon't think that's a has to be a bad\nthing yeah i think there are\nmillions\nof ways your life can turn out it's\nbased off decisions you make every\nsingle day but in the end\nthings are okay yeah things end up okay\ni think if you stop and put too much\nthought into every decision you make\nyou're gonna live a very treacherous\nlife of feeling like you're walking on\neggshells i think it's it's a matter of\nsaying\ni mean i personally like to look at it\nas the universe has my back yeah and so\ni think this film also resonates with\nhow i feel in that regard of\nthis woman had two\nshe had a positive pregnancy test and a\nnegative one and\nyou see\ntwo possible scenarios out of a million\nof what her life could have been\nand\nand you see the journey she goes on\nthrough both and how she still has the\nsame ambition and she doesn't lose\nherself in\nin in having a child she still stays who\nshe is and she doesn't lose her ambition\nand when she goes to la and goes through\nthe hardships of trying to make her\ncareer work she doesn't\ngive up you know it's sort of a\nperseverance story and how you don't\nhave to lose yourself in the things that\nhappen to you you can still\nstay you yeah the thing that resonates\nmost with me with that message and this\nwhole conversation we've had today is\nthis idea that even in one life\nyou can be so many things yeah and i\nthink we always are trying to make this\nchoice as you're saying like it's like\nwell do i do this and how will that\nimpact me or do i do this and it's like\nyou could probably do both yeah i mean\nwe've probably you've lived so many\ndifferent lives and i know most of you\nyes\nand most people i know have lived loads\nof different lives and i think we feel\nforced to live one life and one truth\nand i don't think that's true for anyone\nin reality\nand when you force yourself to live one\nlife and one truth you actually limit\nwhat you started with was with all these\nexperiences and all these\nexperiments and an openness to all these\nfeelings so\nyou know i i like that idea of the two\nlives into\nultimately that both work out okay yeah\nand recognizing in one life you can live\nthree lives or seven and\nthings can be okay yeah with that in\nmind i want to shift towards you've made\nso many changes in your diet your health\nyou've experienced chronic fatigue yeah\nyou know and we haven't talked about\nthat so let's let's dive into that\nactually deeply i've been through\nchronic fatigue it lasted a long time it\nled to deeper gut issues\nit led to so many lifestyle changes it\nwas stuff that also just snuck up on me\nwithout me even being aware\nbecause i was living so much in the mind\nof my heart that i wasn't even aware of\nwhat my body was going through\nand so i was you know grounding back\ninto my body\nhow does it feel to live your career and\nexperience chronic fatigue you know\nactive days are sometimes 18 hour days\nif not more\nearly mornings late nights i think\npeople don't realize the lifestyle of\nmaking a movie or making a show where\nyou're in a trailer all day it's not the\nmost comfortable inspiring atmosphere\nyeah as people think the career yeah\nuh\nhow does that work with chronic fatigue\nand diet\nyeah i mean i say to myself i'm like\ndamn i'm in the wrong career not i don't\nactually believe that but you know when\ni when i i'm someone who very much needs\nat least eight hours to function so\nsometimes when it's\na four hour turnaround or i have to get\nup and go on a plane quickly i'm like oh\ngod this is a challenge for me but\nbecause it's something that i love to do\nso much\ni truly\njust run off of\nthe pure joy i find and when i do\nand it's not so you know i\ni take naps when i can\nbut i also am very much under like now\nat this point in my life really taking\nmy gut health seriously trying i've\ntreated my body like a junkyard for a\nvery long time with what i've been\neating\nand\nit's it's got to a point where earlier\nthis year i knew i needed to make\nreal changes because\ni was so unhappy with how i looked\nbe one but also i felt that i was doing\na great disservice to my body i spend so\nmuch time trying to better my mental\nhealth and i don't put any of that into\nmy physical body\nand there's all this new research on how\ndepression is directly related to your\ngut and and all these things and i'm\nlike okay we're gonna take this\nseriously\nand it is a\ntruly reprogramming of bad patterns and\nhabits that i've grown up just\nimmediately going to the fast food to\nprocessed foods and\nand it's truly been about educating\nmyself on the better options and reading\ningredients and choosing\nthe less convenient alternative and\nactually think that the chronic fatigue\nhas slowly started to amazing\nimprovements\nbecause\ni mean me too it's been i've been\ndealing with this basically since i was\ndiagnosed with depression when i was\n14. yeah so it's it's just now and it's\nalways i don't know if it'll\nfully cure itself with my with my diet\nwe're getting there we're trying\nbut it is a it's an everyday\nsaying small steps not trying to\ncompletely change everything all at once\nand\ni think obviously in these hard times\nfood is a great comfort and offers a lot\nof\nto me at least it can be very comforting\nso i do turn to food sometimes to fill\nthat sort of emotional\nneed but again recognizing that\nnot judging myself for it just trying to\nmake healthier decisions overall is what\ni'm\nvery much trying to do\nme too yeah yeah i can relate to\neverything you just said it's a daily\nyeah\nit's a daily practice it is how would\nyou describe your current purpose in\nlife like you know as in where you're at\nright now or even today or like current\npractice and the reason why i ask that\nis because\ni believe that\nyou know when you're healing when you're\ngrowing when you're going through all\nthese journeys like there's somewhat of\nan intention yeah if you will what is\nyour intention than if that's easy my\nintention\nand i've actually had this intention\nfor a very long time and i i i don't\nreally believe that you know you make a\nbirthday wish if you you don't sell\ndon't tell someone your wish you know\nlike i\never since i can remember every time\ni've seen a shooting star\nblown out birthday candles my wish\nalways has been\ni want to be happy\nand\ni my intention is to find\ntrue\nhappiness\nand and peace\nwith myself\nand that is\nmy purpose\nyeah right now to find that and that's a\nbig task\nbut um\nbut it is but that's the that's the\nintention and and two\ni find it so\nthe spiritual journey has has been so\nencouraging to me because\nonce you start you never stop it's it's\nnot something that one day you're gonna\ngo i'm healed i'm good i'm done\nit's truly a for the rest of my life i\nwill be seeking out growth and that is\nso\ni'm so happy about that so liberating it\nis i'm like i will always there's always\nmore things to learn there's always\nsomething else to explore within myself\nand that is so\nexciting and wonderful yeah i love that\ni am you're so right like the feeling of\nsomething ending or figuring something\nout is where all the pressure comes yeah\nright when you're trying to complete\nsomething or you're trying to end\nsomething you're trying to get something\nover the finish line like that's where\nall the stress and pressure and\nintensity comes from whereas when you\nsay\nwell i'm pretty much going to live with\nthis i had someone the other day asked\nme actually it's just jogged my memory\nsomeone said to me they were like well\nhow do i\nforget my past so i can move forward\ni was like you probably won't no forget\nyour past no and it's probably not a\nuseful place to put your focus right in\ntrying to forget your past yeah and\nknowing you'll never forget it liberates\nyou and then you can actually move\nforward\nand keep developing and i find that\nsometimes our fixations on completely\nthe wrong target i agree and so we spend\nall this time trying to forget something\nyeah not and knowing that pretty much\nnone of us can actually physically do\nthat well that's what i feel about our\nconversation i'm like damn i truly have\nbeen thinking i need to find myself and\nnow i am oh i actually need to just\ncreate it yeah so that's been yeah thank\nyou for that\nthat has been uh you led us impactful\nyeah\nthing well you led us there well\nwe we got there\nall right now we'll go to the final five\nthese have to be answered in one word to\none sentence maximum okay one more one\none sentence is i don't know what the\nofficial breakdown is maybe seven words\ni don't know making it okay okay all\nright so\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nreceived\ni will say my dad always told me growing\nup find a job that makes you happy have\na career in something that makes you\nhappy it makes the world of a difference\nthat's grace yep uh second question what\nis the worst advice you've ever heard or\nreceived probably\ndon't cry\nyeah question number three uh something\nspecial that your mom did for you and\nyou called her all those times something\nthat you remember that stood out i think\njust her telling me\nthat she would be there whenever i\nneeded her sometimes just hearing that\nis so\ncalming\nso her her reassurance that you can text\nme when you need me\nokay thank you absolutely i love that uh\nquestion number four something you think\npeople misunderstand about you if they\ndon't know you deeply\ni think my outspokenness\ni think is sometimes misinterpreted as\nignorance\nwhereas or attention seeking whereas i\njust\nsometimes\ncan't keep my thoughts to myself\nyeah but it's never from a bad place\nit's from a place of let's have a\nconversation not\nthis is my opinion and it's right it's\nno i'm just trying to add my bit to the\nconversation whether it's helpful or not\nyeah\nit's gonna be there\ni love that and fifth and final question\nwhich we ask every guest since day one\nis\nif you could create one law in the world\nthat everyone had to follow what would\nit be\nyeah\nit could be anything take your time take\nyour time this is a okay one law that\nanyone had to follow\nthe law that i would create is you are\nnot allowed to tell another human being\nwhat they can and cannot feel\nperiod\nthat's a great one we've never had that\nokay good i was like people
