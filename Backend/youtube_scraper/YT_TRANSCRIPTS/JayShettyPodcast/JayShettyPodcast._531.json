    "transcript": "when i'm making choices\nthat have a financial incentive\na lot of the times i'll ask myself\nif all the money was off the table do\nyou want to do this i found that when i\nwhen i re-met like\nyou know 18 19 year old alicia\num\nshe\nreally didn't have the time yet or the\nopportunity yet to\nbecome\ndoubtful\ni'll say\nlike\nyou know\nyeah\nyou know of course of course we all go\nthrough different moments in our life\nand\nand we\nsurely feel doubt and insecurity and all\nthose things and that's supernatural but\ni think she had like\nthat 19 year old alicia had a certain\nconfidence about her\nthat was really sure she knew what she\ndidn't want she knew who she didn't want\nto be she wasn't trying to trying to\nbend too much to be that person\nthat other people might have thought\nwould do better for her because she was\nvery very very very clear\nand she hadn't yet had the taste of of\nof uh\nacknowledgment to\nit to\nto then start to change or to feel the\nneed to please or whatever happens i\nthink sometimes when in different parts\nof our life\nwe find ourselves in and for me i think\nafter\nafter that time\nsome of me changed in a way and i\nrealized that now i've found my way back\nto where i was then\nand i found that to be so interesting\nbecause in a way i started out\nmore clearly myself and then maybe lost\nmy way through the middle\nyeah interesting and then have found\nthat i've been able to find my way back\nand and when i look when i look at\nmyself today and i'm like oh okay\nuh i realize i'm most close to the\noriginal me which was probably\nyou know right before everything started\nto pick up take off you know\nsuccess and things like that and so\nthat's that's to me really really\ninteresting\nan interesting revelation and that makes\nme smile because in a way i kind of\nalready had it\nyeah\nyeah it's it's that's that's that's so\nfunny isn't it i\nrealize that it's\nit's crazy to think that\nit's almost a process of unlearning\nand rewiring and and reconnecting back\nto who we were or what we knew and\nletting go of all the noise and the\nlayers\nand you talked about in in part one of\nthe book you talk about\nand you say this and when you say it\nthrough the story you share it's so\npowerful when you talk about i no longer\nbelong to myself\nand when you said that and and what\nyou're sharing around that space the\nquestion i had is\nwhen people say the phrase don't sell\nyour soul to achieve between\nhow do you interpret that now like how\ndo you interpret that in context of\nyou saying\ni no longer belong to myself\num\nyou know\ni think when you when you hear that\nphrase don't sell your soul you\nautomatically assume\nthat it has to do with financially right\nyou automatically assume that you know\nokay\nyou know people might offer you some\nabsorbent amount of money and to do all\nthese things that maybe you don't want\nto do\nand and so automatically you kind of\nthink financially don't sell your soul\nliterally don't sell it for a certain\nnumber which is a great guiding light\nand i agree with that as well because i\nthink that a lot of times when i'm\nmaking choices\nthat have a financial incentive a lot of\nthe times i'll ask myself\nif all the money was off the table do\nyou want to do this if you had to do\nthis for free\ntomorrow would you be passionate about\nit and to me that's like the equalizing\nspace and question that really makes\nsure that your soul and spirit and heart\nis in the right place you know and that\nyou actually are in love with something\nyou know so so but but going back to the\npoint that's not the point i digress the\npoint it's beautiful keep keep doing it\nbe free\nthe point of what you asked was yeah so\ni think when i now when i hear don't say\nyour soul\ni don't think so much financially i\nthink\nmore spiritually because there is like\nthere is a\nwealth\nand a richness that you have\nby\nprotecting\nthe beauty of who you are and your\nsanity and your wellness and the\nspecialness of who you are and each of\nus are special in this really beautiful\none-of-a-kind way\nand a lot of the times i think\nyou will find that i found that in order\nto maybe ensure\nthat this dream that i've always had\ncould be be real or be obtainable or\ncontinue on or whatever i\ndidn't value enough the beauty and the\nand the safety and the and the\nimportance of my worth and and my and my\nthe need of being\ngood to myself and so in those ways\nthat's why i didn't belong to myself\nbecause i started to\nwant to do things from the best\nintentions by the way i did it because i\ni wanted good things to come from it i\nwanted people to be happy i thought it\nwould make people feel good you know it\nwas all from the best intentions but i\ndidn't put myself first in that equation\nand therefore in some ways\nyou know i i started to not belong to\nmyself yeah i think that's a beautiful\ndistinction you've made there between\nselling your soul usually being a\nfinancial reference or you know i think\nyou're spot on that's what we usually\nthink we go okay that means i'm not\ngonna sell out financially\nwhat about it's so much more of an\nexistential\nspiritual question\nand and i think that that's a really\nbeautiful distinction that that are not\na lot of people make\nand and it almost feels like the one\nyou're more tested on\nand then that's actually harder to\nmaintain because you may still be able\nto stick to your passion but i'm\nfascinated that since you were four\nyears old\nthere were two constants i noticed in\nyour life so one was and i wanted to\nshare both of them because i think both\ni admire in different ways one of them\nwas you say you knew that one day you'd\nbe a singer and you knew that in your\ngut since you were four\nand and i'm fascinated by how you\nnot knew that because i think you're\nright i think when we're younger we do\nknow things but what i'm intrigued by is\nwhat made you trust your intuition at\nthat age\nbecause i think when we're young\nwe're more malleable and moldable and\nwe're more\ngo along with what society or family or\nfriends or noise tells us but\nyou knew but what was it that helped you\ncontinue to commit and follow that\num\num\ni didn't feel that\nyou know i think that back to this\nsimilar theme about like we kind of\nstart out knowing\nthe truth and then we start\nlearning the lies and the lies start to\nget in the way and start to make it\nreally\nor inheriting the lies maybe\nand you know and and again it's not\nbecause somebody actually lied to us\nit's because\nthey just told us what they knew\nand what they knew was probably not\nreally the truth either\nand each person has their own truth\nanyway and so it really doesn't matter\nwhat other people tell you because\nyou have to find your own truth and each\neach person's truth is different\nand so i think that at that\nfour-year-old place i was very very\nclear i was super clear that i didn't\nhave that interference yet i didn't have\nthat kind of societal oppression yet\nbecause i was just so pure and so\nyou know open and my mother has always\nbeen a performer and i remember us doing\nlike there were these cute little talent\nshows at my little kindergarten and we\nwould perform together and we'd practice\nthese different routines and it'd be me\nand her and\nand she's such a you know she's such a\nperformer and she's always you know had\nsuch a passion for the arts and that's\nwhat she came to new york to do and you\nknow so in so many ways i've always said\nthat i'm i am her\ndream\nmanifested in some way\nand\nand so and so she always had that spirit\nto her and and i think because that was\nher dream as well\nshe\nwas excited when she saw that spark in\nme too you know and so we just were a\ngood match you know we just were a good\nmatch so so i think it wasn't until\nlater that i started to get out of that\nyou know sweet innocent\nthat really i think where this truth\nlives um\njust because you know you start meeting\nmore people when you start being more\nexposed to different things and and then\nmaybe you start the doubt creeps in or\nthe fear creeps in or the you know\nwhatever else comes in to try to un\nunseat us but in that four-year-old\nspace i definitely knew and there was no\ndoubt and i'm clear i'm clear about that\nyeah and i love what you said there we\nwe start with the truth and then we\nlearn the lies we inherit the lies that\ninherit the lies i think that's\nsuch a\nbeautiful statement it's poetic but it's\nso true as well and the the other\nconstant that i noticed in your life as\ni was reading through the pages was your\nfriendship with erica since you were\nfour\nyeah and when i saw that i'm blown away\nby anyone\nwho can have a friendship that lasts\nthe changes of life the seasons of life\nthe\nthe ups and downs of life like and you\nwork together right\nyes yes\nso many seasons\nhow do you maintain a friendship through\nthat time since four years old someone\nwho's known you\nyour whole your whole life basically\nlike tell me tell me what that's like\nthrough the journey you've had of\nmaintaining a friend who's been a part\nof your life the whole way\nyeah you know i think it was quite\nnatural you know we we knew each other\nfrom\nvery young and and just because we\nour fam you know her family lived in the\nbuilding that i lived in and so that's\nhow we kind of connected and met and\nthen we and then we had similar\ntrajectory just meeting up in that way\nand then we were reintroduced to each\nother\num\nlater when she was in college and and\nour her uncle norman was the one that\nsaid you know hey erica is doing music\nand i know you're doing music and maybe\nyou guys can connect and so we\nreconnected because we already knew each\nother and and then we\nrealized how much we\nunderstood each other which i think is\nso rare you know it's like i can\nliterally count on my one hand the\namount of people that actually\nunderstand me and i'm sure\nthat and that i understand them and\nthere's like a real a real connection\nthere that that's that's so genuine and\npure so\nso you know you when that happens you\nknow that it's rare and it's special and\nso from there we just continued to\nconversate and and she was you know\nreally smart and finishing college and i\nwas just about to embark on this whole\ncrazy world and touring and you know\nand and and and it just the timing was\njust as it was meant to be\nand so then we started transitioning\nfrom kind of\nall the friend only to the friend and\ncolleague and growing together in this\nin this space and it was very comforting\nfor me because i it was nice for me to\nhave somebody that i knew and trusted\nand felt\nyou know close to my age and to my\nexperience and that type of thing and so\nit just was all timing man you know so i\nthink that for most of it\nit was quite\neasy yeah you know as i think the best\nrelationships are you don't\nhave to make sure all relationships take\nwork to maintain to understand to have\nthe you know communication that's\nnecessary for them but i think the best\nrelationships are always quite easy and\nfluid and so that was that was one of\nthem oh yeah that's interesting you say\nthat the best relationships are\ngenerally\nmeant to flow naturally like it's almost\nlike it doesn't it shouldn't have to be\nincredibly hard work\nright yeah\nyeah that's that's beautiful it's it's a\nnice way to look at it because i almost\nfeel like\nwe're programmed as humans to believe\nlike if we're working harder for\nsomething then it's more important\nyou know what i mean\ni don't understand that yeah\nwe feel like that we feel like if i'm\nnot working hard then it can't be worth\nit like we have that conditioning that\nthat storytelling in our mind and so\nsometimes i feel like people stay in\nrelationships because it's harder work\nand they wear that as the badge of honor\nand we see that as like we've achieved\nsomething today\noh my gosh it's so\nno i i you're so writing in fact in the\nyou know\nmore recently have i truly truly like in\nthe past four years to be honest have i\ntruly said like if it's not flowing i'm\nnot doing it because i had to finally\nunderstand that it's like this whole\nidea is driven swimming upstream\nand this whole idea of like it's just\nthe most difficult thing ever\nand and and yet we still fight for it\nand fight for it and fight for it i did\nthat for so long for so long and and\nfinally i realized like wait if it's not\nflowing it stopped flowing for a reason\nyeah it's quite hard it's quite hard\nbecause even you know but i listen even\nto you know\ntwo months ago when i was preparing for\nthe grammys i had i had you know the\nhosting\num all of my ideas for that and this one\nvery particular idea that i had was\nabsolutely not coming to life\nand i could not let it go i could not i\nkept fighting and pushing and finding\nanother way and i'm gonna find it and i\nwon't give up on it and i kept on i kept\non i kept and i i you know here i was\ntelling myself\npreviously that you know you know if it\ndoesn't flow just let it go but here i\nwas back and i said no this is worth it\ni'm gonna fight for it i'm gonna find it\nthis they won't defeat me i'm here i'm\ngonna do it i mean and and finally it\ntook my husband\none night he was like alicia i\ni'm watching you and and\nthis thing is consuming you i mean you\ncan't even think about anything else\nbecause all you're working on so hard is\nthis thing that it's obviously not\ncoming together\ni think you should let it go\nand he finally had to bring me back to\nlike my own\npromise to myself\nyeah wow it's it's so crazy that you\ntouched on that because i'd actually\ntaken an excerpt out of the book that i\nwanted to to read to the audience\nbecause it it just it just really like\nit was like a punch in the gut when i\nwas reading it in a good way\nand it was exactly this piece so\nthis is reading from the book more\nmyself\nand alicia says\noh wait i'm going to find the exact\npiece that i love here we go\nsorry it would be much better in your\nvoice but i'm reading it out because\ni've picked it but it's uh\nat the time i wouldn't have described it\nthat way nor did i truly understand that\nthere was a flow with my name on it but\nfrom this side of life i can see how\nevery moment every experience every\npivot even my supposed missteps have\nbeen life's way of getting me where i\nhave always been meant to go\nrather than resisting the current i've\nlearned to surrender\nuh and you know i i thought that was\nabsolutely beautiful so i guess my\nquestion there is like how do you give\nthat because i i agree with you on both\nsides and i see both in myself too\nand and i want to learn from you here\nhow how do you\nknow when too much is too much for\nyourself and i don't mean as a principal\ni mean as a principal for you how do you\nknow when it's worth the fight because\nthere are times in this book where you\nhave to stand up for your values you\nhave to believe in what you're doing and\nthere are times where you're like\nactually i just have to surrender\nhow do you find that balance between\nthose two places\nman i\ni still struggle with that\nyou know\ni i sometimes i'm so clear\nand i know yeah you know this isn't it\nand i i have to let it go it's better to\nlet it go sometimes i'm so clear\nand a lot of times i\nit takes me quite a while and i find\nmyself like i just explained you know\nhaving to remember and relearn what i\nthought i already knew\nand i thought i already knew i didn't\nwant to fight or have to go against the\nflow\nyou know um so sometimes it's quite\nclear\nand sometimes it's not it's not as clear\nto me and i guess that's okay you know\nthat's okay but\ni know that if i'm if i feel it if i'm\nif i'm feeling i know i definitely have\nlearned to trust\nreally much more that\nthat that\nsensation in the gut you know that thing\nthat kind of just\nreally\ntells you\nno\nyou know or or yes you know whatever\nwhatever it is i've definitely learned\nto pay a lot more attention to that and\nthat that is a part of\nthe the piece of what you're asking like\nhow do you know when it's when it's\nenough or you know what's your own\npersonal\nkind of barometer there but\nyou know i think that i think that\nthat's pers that's personally something\nthat i'm i'm constantly working through\nto really drop into my\nto what i know to be true and you know\nbecause i think we're all around so much\nnoise and we're around so many damn\nopinions like\nlord the amount opinions it's like how\ndo you navigate yourself through all the\nopinions because\npart of it is great it's wonderful to\nhave these different perspectives and it\nfeeds you and you kind of can see it\nfrom different points of view and that's\nreally great but then there's another\npart of it that it can just become so\nnoisy so to drop into that space in your\ngut that literally like\nif you don't feel it you do know you\ndon't feel it you do know that and yeah\nyou can try to convince i'm good i'm a\ngood convincer i try to convince myself\nthat i feel it and i try to explain in\nmyself then i try to rationalize myself\nbut i do know when it's not when i'm not\nfeeling it and so i'm learning much\nbetter to just be comfortable with that\nand to know that that's for a reason and\neven if i don't understand that reason\nright now\nthere's a reason why\nit's not feeling right and to\nreally just trust that\nyeah no absolutely and i appreciate your\nhonesty with that it is such a\nhard thing to know and that's why i\nasked you because i think we we all\nstruggle with that in in in\nwhere the book gets gets you know it\nstarts to get really uh\njust where you just open up even more\nand you get such an intimate look into\nhow you've got to where you are today\nand the relationships in your life in in\none of the chapters you talk about your\nrelationship with kerry\nand and what i find fascinating about\nthat is just how you're able to\nunderstand how\ndifferent people come into your life for\ndifferent reasons and you talk about how\nwomen and men but we choose someone you\nknow you talk about women specifically\nto where you choose someone that's\neither like your father or not like your\nfather right like that\nextreme and\na lot of people can relate to that and\nyou know me and my wife often talk about\nthat we talk about the similar traits we\nhave to our parents and how i complement\nsome of those things that she loves in\nher father or you know the differences\nthat we have and we start to see that\ntell me what you were able to learn from\nfrom these different people in your life\nat different times\nthat that helped you with the\nrelationship you have now\nright you've got two beautiful kids and\nhappily married like what were the\nthings that you learned that helped you\nbuild\nthe relationship you had now\noh man and just overall with anyone and\neveryone\nuh wherever specifically\nwherever you feel comfortable to go with\nit\nso what so so what situations or what\nrelationships have\nshown me\nor helped me to get to where i am now\nwhere i'm able to have a really healthy\nyou know\njust loving\nreciprocal relationship is kind of what\nyou mean yeah yeah what i mean is sorry\nif i'm not explaining myself well what i\nmean is\nthat\nwhen you talk about your relationship\nwith kerry and you talk about you know\nhow you\nfeel that how he was brought into your\nlife to teach you certain things so i'm\nfascinated by what some of those lessons\nwere and how they\ncontinue to be useful in your life now\noh my gosh yes so i mean the biggest one\ndefinitely and it's just so incredible\nand and\nagain back to that self-reflection and\nand back to that being able to look\nyou know look at it from this clear\nvantage point now it's so apparent what\nkerry and i were brought together to\ncreate and\nand and what he was brought to teach me\nwas very very very important deep stuff\nand i and i know one of the stories that\ni share\nin the book is um you know i\nlike like i said we inherit all these\nthings and i i had this habit of uh\nthat my mother is she does all the time\nand she it's kind of like this this\nself-deprecating thing but i guess it's\nlike a little bit of you know it's a\nlittle bit of like takes the weight off\nand kind of maybe it's sort of a joke\nbut it's actually you know just uh you\nknow and and i would do this thing\nthat i picked up from her where i would\nsay well you know my luck\nyou know and it was it was almost like\nit's almost like protection\nso that if everything if something\ndidn't go right i already knew that that\nwas okay you know and well because you\nknow my luck so\nyou know it was like a disclaimer or\nsomething and and i didn't even know i\nwas doing that and i didn't even realize\ni was doing it and it became just like\nit became just a habitual\nthing that i would say and so we'd be\ntalking like well because you know my\nluck and that and he was like why do you\nsay that and i was like what and he was\nlike why do you what is making you say\nthat and i was like what are you talking\nabout it's like\nit's not that serious what he's talking\nabout\nhe really pointed out to me\nthat you know by me using those words\ni was\nbasically\nasking the universe to give me bad luck\nbecause i was saying that well since i\nwas claiming that my luck was not good\nyeah and i was doing it in a joking\nmanner\nthat i thought was\nthat i had picked up so i didn't think\nit was a big deal\nbut in actuality it was blocking me\nand i mean i was probably at the time\nlike 16.\nwow\nand i was able to receive that message\nso loud and clear you know from him\nand i know that it changed the\ntrajectory because i started to learn\nearly\nthe power of words and how what you say\nis definitely a million percent\nwhat you gonna get\ni mean and so i didn't know that and\nand so when he opened my eyes to that\nit really changed a lot for me\nand so so things like that he really you\nknow he gave me those kind of gifts and\nand and it really helped to shape a lot\nof my you know um the way that i looked\nat things and the way that i started to\nsay things and\nand what i would remove from my\nvocabulary or just remove from from the\nthings that i learned you know before\nhim so\nit's so\nthere's so much that he shared with me\nand taught me that i know has\ncontributed to\nmy you know my mindset my the way i see\nthings\nyeah that's beautiful thank you for\nsharing that it's when you talk about in\nthe book and you look like just how it's\nit's shocking to me because the things\nthat you're talking about and then i\nlook at how old you are in that section\ni'm like what no way like you know it's\nit's almost like\nthat there's so much wisdom in your soul\nand you're you're so mature and then at\nthe same time you're reflecting so\ndeeply at you know choices or decisions\nthat\nyou saw leading you the wrong way and\nit's so interesting just to see that\njuxtaposition of\nof just rechecking i'm like oh wow\nyou're only 16 then you know it's and\nand there's so much\nthere and one of the things i love about\nthe book that i think has been done\nbeautifully is you have these short\nnotes at the beginning of some of the\nchapters from people in your life like\nyour father your you know sound\nengineers like so many different roles\nand\nyeah those could be an incredible window\ninto\nthe scenario and situation when i'm\nreading it and i was wondering how\nyou know because i think this is such a\ncommon thing for so many people like as\nthey grow up\ntheir relationship with their parents\neither strengthens or weakens\nhow did this process help you heal your\nrelationship or or further or deepen\nyour relationship with your parents of\nyou know going through this process of\nreflecting on all of this again or how\nis that journey\ntaking place for you through your\nspiritual growth\nyeah no definitely i mean\ni think in so many way in in in a lot of\nways\num\nit's done\nso much of that so much of that even\nhearing the stories that my mother\nshared and\nrealizing her perspective and\nrealizing\nhow things must have been for her\nduring these different times\nyou know especially when she talks about\nkind of you know choosing to have me and\nyou know it wasn't the\nit wasn't the kind of traditional\nscenario\nwhen she got pregnant and she wasn't\nkind of on the trajectory to marry my\nfather and it just it wasn't you know it\nwasn't the you know what we are told is\nkind of the way things are supposed to\nhappen it didn't happen like that and\nand that could have been really really\ndifficult for her and and surely it was\nand\nand she had to make some really hard\nchoices\nand so just hearing kind of her\nperspective and her story and but then\nstill understanding that regardless she\nin essence you know chose me she chose\nme\nyou know that\nthat is what uh\nthat is\nlike things like that just as a daughter\nyou don't\ni mean of course if you step back of\ncourse your parents like guests choose\nyou because once they choose to go\nforward they chose you and they're gonna\nstick it out for good bad or indifferent\nbut as a daughter you don't think like\nthat like you don't\nreally think like that and and so to\nhave those moments\nnow on this side um and also being a\nmother and understanding like\nthe weight of what that actually means\nis\nit just deepened my respect\nand my you know love for her so so much\nwhich i don't even know how that can get\nany deeper because she's literally my\none and only like truly you know\nin regards to consistency and actually\nbeing there for me for real it's her and\nthat's it you know so she so but to\nlearn more about\nthat and her you know\ndoubts and insecurities and and things\nshe had to overcome really just brought\nme closer to her i think just as a woman\nyou know as a woman\nso that that was that's really cool and\nreally powerful and\nand then and then for my father as well\nyou know we've definitely been on a deep\num\na deep journey to understand\nour relationship and\nand it's taken many incarnations and\nit's taken many turns and taken me many\nplaces that have had to do with anger\nand rage and worthlessness and and\nmany many emotions and and even\nand and and even you know moving towards\ngratitude and and definitely like a\ndeeper understanding of\nhis\njourney and his\ndifficulties and what he's had to endure\nand experience and and his upbringing\nand you know he also was raised by his\nmother only and he didn't really have he\nhad a he had a he had a father figure in\nmy grandfather who my grandmother\nmarried later on you know what i mean\nbut in regards to like him having a\nfather figure you know how does one\nlearn how to be a father what are you\njust born knowing how to be a father\nlike how do you and how do you know how\ndo you know\nso\nso or how does one learn how to be a\nmother you know same so it's just\nit's just so deep in this kind of\nthis kind of\nplace of\nempathy\nand understanding and\nreally you know as opposed to just only\nseeing everything from your view and\nyour perspective\ni think that's what i that's what it's\ngiven me the most of being able to see\nit from multiple perspectives and\nmultiple views and to your point even\nthose intro chapters and things like\nthat create\nanother perspective of how to look at it\nhow to see it\nand\nultimately\nthat's our experience i think is\nhow we see it is the experience we have\nwith it\nso it's been really really dope and\ngreat\nand beautiful and you know my father and\ni are really in a very wonderful place\nand closer than we've ever been and and\nreally able to be\nfriends and just like humans and without\nall of the extra attachments or without\nof the extra\nus\nwhat i want to call it it's almost like\nthe\nthe pictures were painted that we\nassume we're supposed to live up to and\nand then we hold each other to these\nimages of what it's supposed to be but\nwe each have to create what it is and\nyou know hey you might not be the daddy\nthat was in my life at four years old\nand threw me up on your shoulders and\nwalked around and then tucked me into\nbed at night that might not have been of\nour experience but that doesn't mean\nthat our experience isn't valuable and\nthat our experience isn't special too\nin the way that it was meant to unfold\nso\nthat that empathy has definitely come\nthrough in a lot of ways and\num\nand and i love that this book has\nassisted that\nwow that yeah that's so powerful to hear\nthat that the the pictures and the\nvisions that\nwe like our fiction writing brains\ncreate\nwhat it should look like and\nwhat it should feel like\nand then you start realizing that no one\nhas what it should feel like or look\nlike like it doesn't really\nexist and that our experience is\ndifferent and what i'm hearing you say\nalso is\nwhen we\ndevelop the emotional skills our parents\ndidn't have\nthat's when we realize how hard it is\nright like it's it's almost like\nthere's an expectation of your parents\nto be a certain way but then when you\ntry and become that yourself you realize\nhow hard it is to gain those qualities\nand\nand and those perspectives does that\nmake sense\nyes\nabsolutely that does that does man and\nyou're a mother now so you know you must\nsee it from that perspective again like\nalmost like a\nthe 180 flip of being in that situation\nand\nseeing that in your children\nit's oh man that yeah no that\nthat's definitely a a mind trip it's\nreally interesting and i think the\nbiggest\nthe biggest part for me\ncomes back to what we talked about\nalready with the unlearning yeah and the\nyou know just the\nwhat the truth is for you\nand um and just really\nrecognizing what it is that you want to\nbring\nfor it toward them for them you know\nwhat what do you want\nto let go of even in yourself because i\nthink there's constantly that's one of\nmy favorite things about being a parent\nis that they're teaching me so much\nabout what i want to let go of\nand what i what i no longer want to\nbring forth you know and and that is so\ninteresting and crazy and so it's\nit's something else\nyeah it's it's always nice hearing that\nabout how much i don't have kids yet we\ndon't have kids yet so\nwe haven't we haven't had that gift in\nour life yet but to to\nhear that from your perspective of how\nmuch you're learning back from them is\nis phenomenal and i know that my my\ncommunity loves hearing about\nhow relationships form especially\npartners and husbands wives or marriages\nor partnerships of any any form and\nwhat i found fascinating was that you\nand your husband\nactually go way back but it's funny to\nread that you were actually turned off\nby him because of how flashy he was and\nthe fact that he'd brag about completing\na beat in 10 minutes\nand by the way i've been a big fan of\nhis beats for a very long time\nmusic too so i was kind of like i i you\nknow it's it's tough this way so what\ntipped the scales in his favor like what\nwas it that\nthat allowed you to recognize that this\nwas the person you wanted to be\noh it was like it was so\ninteresting it's such a journey because\nyou know like you said\nand we talk about it i actually love\nthe story of us in the book a lot\nbecause it really i think comes through\nreally purely as to the experience and\num and and\nand we've known each other for so long\num you know since we were like 15 and 14\nand we've seen each other through these\ndifferent incarnations in our lives and\nwe've watched each other become\nsuccessful without even really you know\nnot you know we knew each other in the\nsense of we'd met in these different\nplaces and we of course were happy for\neach other's success but\nyou know it was kind of in passing in so\nmany ways and so i i found that with him\ni i really was quite judgmental about\nhim\nwhich is something that i think we do\nlike as humans you know we just are\nsuper judgmental\nabout a person and you know and and so i\ni always had this idea about what i\nthought that he was in my mind and and\nthat particular thought that i thought\nthat he was was something that i didn't\nfind to be something i wanted to really\nget to know more of or you know i i\ndidn't i thought it was to your point\nlike i wrote quite flashy very over the\ntop very kind of obnoxious ostentatious\nit was completely the antithesis\nof what i\nwho i believe i am or who i believed i\nwas and and and and just what i the\nenergy that i carried and so i was\nalways so like ah\nthere he goes again and like he can't\njust have a fancy car he has to have the\nwhite phantom\nyou know he can't just have like a\nreally nice chain he has to have like\nfive diamond chains like it was just\nlike so over the top and so much so i\ndrew these conclusions about him and\nevery time that i\num connected with him\ni was always like wow\nhe's so cool like huh i didn't realize\nhow cool he was and i'd always be\nintroduced to the real him because as we\ndo a lot you know we we judge each other\nand assume that we know something about\npeople and we don't\nand\nand so it wasn't until that i actually\nstarted to communicate with him or\nconversing him that uh then i started\nthis i was like wow he's he's quite\ninteresting\n[Music]\nhe's he's always thinking about\nsomething that's so interesting and so\nthat it was it was it was that it was\nthe the actual getting to know him and\nreally just the peeling away the layers\nof what i assumed and actually getting\nto know the spirit of the person and i\nthink that when i look at it from\nnow you know um\nand i look\nand i look i i know\nfor a fact that the universe and god\ndefinitely knew what they were doing\nwhen they brought us together\nbecause it's completely\nthis we both have what each other didn't\nhave before us\nand\nso there's this beautiful thing where\nhe's taught me so much\nabout\nlike\ngreatness and bigness and being unafraid\nof this this this enormousness that we\nhave within us and you don't have to be\nafraid of it you don't have to\nnot step into your five diamond chains\nnow you might express that in a\ndifferent way and you might want to\nexpress that brilliance and brightness\nin another way\nbut you don't have to be afraid to\nexpress it you don't have to hold it\nback and repress it you don't have to\nnot want wonderful things for yourself\nyou don't have to be afraid of\nanything not your wealth in any capacity\nnot the wealth of the love that you have\nthat you want to give not the wealth of\nthe ideas that you have that you want to\ncreate not the wealth financially that\nyou want to be able to have and give and\nshare you do not have to hold it back\nand i only held everything back until i\nmet him and he was a really really big\nteacher to me about how to walk into my\ngreatness and not apologize for it\nand\nand it was and it's really deep it's\nreally deep and really amazing and i'm\nso grateful for it and i've also given\nhim\na sense of grounding and a sense of\ndeepening and a sense of really looking\nat things from a a\na a more\nexpressive place or a more\nyou know\nintimate place because\nbecause i'm more internal he's more\nexternal and so it's it's really uh it's\nreally been so special to witness the\nway that we were both\nobviously meant\nto\nbring each other this energy and so we\ncomplement each other so beautifully and\nand it continues to be that way i'm and\ni'm so blessed for that\nyeah i'm so glad you shared that because\ni feel like in this\nin this online dating world or you know\nsocial media dating world that we missed\ni i often find that people are judged so\nquickly\nand we make decisions over\nwhether we could or could not have a\nfuture with someone\nso instantly and it's almost like\nyou you guys wouldn't have been together\nif it was just based on that initially\n[Music]\nand then like you're saying like you can\nsee the greater reason for you come\ntogether you can see the abundant life\nthat\nyou've been\nempowered to live for yourself through\nthrough both of you coming together\nand it's incredible to think it wouldn't\nhave happened because of an initial\njudgment\nand one of the parts i love\nis where\nyou talk about this so it says you know\nthat uh your husband said for years that\nyou wouldn't take your wedding ring off\neven after he presented you with an\nupgrade\nand i quote that's alicia for you less\nis more and and you know so i was like\nbut so it seems like you've you're still\nyou've still stayed to that like less is\nstill more for you\nyeah but you've been you've been able to\nappreciate more right that's that's kind\nof what i'm hearing\nyeah i'm still who i am yeah and i am\ni am a person that does\nprefer simplicity i realize you know it\njust feels better for me\num\nbut i also have learned to appreciate\nand within that simplicity to find\nthat that the simplicity doesn't mean i\nhave to\nwant nothing for myself as well you know\nit's like it's like a beautiful line you\nknow but so yes there's a much more i\nthink a much better balance although\nstill at my heart that's the type of\ngirl woman that i am i am i'm a quite\nsimple person\ni love that\none of the big things that you see in in\nyour life that shift is your experience\nin in egypt and when you returned\nto new york from egypt\nyour whole team noticed that you you\nchanged you shifted\nand you go on to say that you started\nusing the single most powerful word a\npleaser can ever speak and\nno right and i think so many of us today\nhave a challenge with that word in in so\nmany areas of our life tell me what the\nexperience was in egypt that led to\nled to you getting that confidence\nbecause i think for a lot of us it's\njust we're not giving ourselves the\npermission to say no\nbecause we don't want to let others down\nbecause we\nwant to be seen as good people and\ncaring people tell me about the\nimportance of using that word and how\nit's changed things for you\noh my gosh\nit's so important man and it's like you\nknow we just we associate\nso much guilt with\nlooking out for ourselves\nyou know and i don't know why we do this\nlike well we're so comfortable to make\nsure that we're\ndoing all the best things and the right\nthings for everybody else for that it\nfeels like you're you're you're you're\nyou know you're completely in the right\nin the in your rightness\nbut when it comes to looking out for\nwhat's best for you\nwe are so guilt-ridden about it and i\nthink it's just i am so finished and\ndone with that i just i would really\nlike to rewrite\nthat whole\nstory it is whack and it's not real and\ni don't know what it is and i don't know\nwho told it and i don't know if it's\nlike\nwomen\nlike really deal with this even more\ndifficultly than men i don't know i'm\nnot a man i can't speak for men\nall i know is whoever feels like how i\nfeel in this place where we\nsuddenly are racked with guilt when it\nhas to do with protecting or taking care\nof yourself\ni want to rewrite that\nnarrative because it's just awful and so\nand it's totally counter-intuitive and\ncounterproductive and it's just kind of\ntotally stupid and i don't even use that\nword i don't like that word but in this\ncase\nrelevant\nit's relevant in this case and and and\nso i think that you know that trip to\negypt was definitely\na really big big marker in in my journey\nto\nstart to understand what it is that felt\ngood for me and how to\nbuild things around me that um\nthat\nthat makes it uh\nbuild things around me that that that\nfeel right and feel good and and be okay\nwith the change that has to come\nnaturally like nothing can just continue\non forever and ever it would it wouldn't\neven work so\nso that\nthat\ntrip was a big part of me arriving to\nthe place where i could finally\nstart to say no and and that definitely\ntook a long time and much much more\nafter that\nbefore i actually got the hang of it and\nbefore i even understood\nwhy it was so valuable and so important\nbut um but i think i started to\nrecognize\njust the the things that were happening\nin my life that that i needed to let go\nof and and that was the beginning of me\nrecognizing this pleasing tendency that\ni was carrying with me um that i that i\nhad that it was time to start shifting\naway from\nyeah it's so powerful hearing you share\nthat and i i know a lot of people\nlistening right now will get so much\nstrength from that because you're right\nmen men and women and and maybe women\nmore like struggle with saying no and\ni think we struggle with our work we\nstruggle within our relationships we\nstruggle with it\nin our families there's so many places\nthat we\nstruggle with it that that it's such an\nimportant\nskill and habit to learn\nand and be able to become comfortable\nwith ourselves and and making that space\nfor ourselves so i think i think you're\ngoing to give a lot of people a lot of\nstrength hearing you talk it through and\ncalling it stupid um\nyou say that in life\nwe don't get what we are sorry in life\nwe don't get what we ask for we get what\nwe believe and i i thought that that\nsting was so powerful when i read it i'm\ngoing to read it again guys because\nit it may sound like something you've\nheard before but it's not so so listen\nto it carefully\nin life\nwe don't get what we ask for we get what\nwe\nbelieve and when i when i read that i\njust thought you know that's that's so\ntrue because there's such an asking\nmovement and manifesting movement and\nyou know just asking for things from the\nuniverse god whatever whatever anyone\nhas a belief in\ni'm intrigued by when you came to that\nrealization\nand what you're believing right now so\nhow did you get to that realization and\nthen\nwhat are you believing right now\noh oh my gosh\nwe're going there today i'm sorry oh\nit's so good it is so\ngood and man\num how do you\ni just\ni just have seen\nso clearly and even\nup to\nquite recently you know\nthat\neven i was\ni was operating from these places that\ni didn't\nrecognize my value\nand\ni thought that that was humility\nwow\nbut i was wrong\nand\nit's absolutely not humility to not\nrecognize your value it's\nit's it's issues with self-worth and\nit's issues with\nyou know\nthings that we all have inside of us\nthat we definitely have to\npay attention to and think about and\nwork on and practice all the time to\nthis day\ni have to\npractice saying i\ndeserve this\ni\nam meant to have this special moment\nand i do not have to\nfeel like\nyou know\ni was doing this thing where i would\nuh you know\nsay i don't need that the similar to\nthat thing that i did when kerry told me\nwhy do you say you know my luck it was\njust a different version of it it was\nlike a more evolved version of it where\ni was you know i was saying no i don't\nneed it to be too complicated it's cool\ni'm just simple i'm just i just need it\neasy and i don't need much just a little\nthis and a little that and i was i was\ntelling the universe that i didn't need\nmuch\nand there's a difference yes difference\nbetween\nyou know\nrecognizing that you're content\nand and telling the universe you don't\nneed\nmuch because once again i was blocking\noff the blessings i was blocking off\nmy potential to reach\na greater greatness\nand\ni realized man look how blessed i am to\nhave reached\nso many beautiful\nplateaus and places and and\namazing\nspaces and\nstill\ni\nam struggling with the belief that i\ndeserve more\nand and when i talk about this every\nmorning i'm not talking\nabout financially deserving more which i\ndeserve that as well by the way and i\nreally encourage us\ni encourage us to not be afraid of\nfinancial success i really do i think\nthat that's also\nanother\nfallacy that that's another narrative\nwe've\nthought that\nsomehow there's something to be ashamed\nof by\nachieving you know any number of things\nwe might achieve so i just i just\nso but that's not what i mean what i\nmean is\nlike the the greatest visions that i\nhave yet to\nvision for myself the greatest visions i\nhave yet to envision for the planet the\ngreatest\nthe the greatest\ncontributions that i have yet to\nto\nactualize all these things if i'm\ntelling myself i don't need much how can\ni reach those\nunimaginable places\nand\nand so\nand so\nthat's what i meant when i was saying\nthat\nit's not\nthe experience\nis fully\nbecause what you believe you deserve\nwhat you believe who you are\nthat's how you walk into a room and\nthat's how you speak to that person and\nthe words that you use to them that that\nyou feel you belong there with them or\nyou don't and we all belong there you\nknow i don't just belong there we all\nbelong there\nand in this in this highest greatest\nspace that we have yet to imagine\nbecause it's that big\nwe might not even be able to see it and\nthat's and that's what i wanted that's\nwhat i want to feel so i don't want to\nsay any longer\nthat\ni don't need much\ni need the greatest version of myself\nthat i can possibly manifest so that i\ncan be the greatest version of myself\nfor the entire planet and that is what\nwe deserve\nso well said so so beautiful so powerful\nso so amazing to hear you say that i can\nresonate with it so much because i talk\nso often about how\ni grew up in in a\nin the rhetoric of\ni always had just enough\nand i always\nand it was always about just enough\nwhich meant you never had enough because\nit was just enough right it was just\nand it ended up\nleading to so many\nchallenges in so many areas of my life\nwhere you end up not realizing that\nthere's a difference between\nselfishness\nthere's a difference between sufficiency\nand then there's a difference with\nservice\nand that's what i'm hearing you say is\nlike selfishness is where you just want\nmore for yourself\nsufficiency is like i've got enough and\nthen there's service where it's like i\nwant more for the whole planet i want to\nbe able to you know give and serve and\ndo bigger and extend myself\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love for me\npersonally it was because i didn't have\na choice\nthere was no other option\nthat was taken away from me with the\npassing of my son's father that i was\nforced into\ni'm alone now who do you trust when you\ndon't have anything else to lean on and\nstand on all you have is what you came\nhere with it's you and the divine"
