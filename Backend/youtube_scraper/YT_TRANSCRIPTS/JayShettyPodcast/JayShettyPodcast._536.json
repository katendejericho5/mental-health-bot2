    "transcript": "you're in control you\nyou you decide what you consume you\ndecide what you believe you decide who\nyou surround yourself with you decide\nwhat you put out\ntake on accountability yeah everybody\nwants to blame right now\n[Music]\ngary it's been three years since i've\nseen you man it's been way too long it's\nnice to be back it's nice to be back man\nwe're always back here this is like i\nthink the third time i've interviewed\nyou in this room\nand\nit's just it's always awesome when i\nhear from you when we're in touch man so\ni'm hoping that we can kick that off\nagain i love it yeah i love it i want to\nstart off i have to ask you i've got a\nton of questions i know we've got\nlimited amount of time i want to start\noff asking how was recon i was watching\nit looked amazing i was following\neverything online it was great we um\nwe're really happy with it i've been\ntelling a lot of my friends and family\nlike you know i really held back a lot\nmeaning it was since it was the first\ntime i didn't know what i was getting\ninto\nso it went super well\num which has me crazy excited for the\nnext one\nit was educational it was about\ncommunity\num\nit felt right and now i think i can\nbuild off of that base i i like context\na lot\nand so i needed to contextualize\nthrowing an event of that size\nnow that i've calibrated i think about\nit like a like a fighter the first round\nthey want to feel each other out you\nwant to take that first punch can you\ntake the guy or gals power\num\nnow that we've done that i feel like i\ncan be even more ambitious with the next\none so\nit was it was really good nice man yeah\nthe people i know that went as not as\nspeakers but as visitors they had a\ngreat time i'm glad so yeah yeah and\nthat's been the universal takeover which\nis for a first year event at that size\ni'll take it your team posted this\nbeautiful videos literally yesterday and\ni was just i was scrolling through\nand it's this video of a moment between\nyou and your dad yeah\nand i was just like you know to hear\nthat from your dad i'm gonna read it out\nhe said you don't even realize what you\ndid on that stage you completely changed\nmy brain\nand and then he said you're really\nspecial and like we've seen moments with\nyou and your dad on social a ton before\nobviously\nwhat was different about that moment and\nand what was he what did you sideline\nyeah what's challenging for me is like\nyou know\nlook\nmy dad's a very popular figure i do a\ngood job making him popular\nhe's the best\nbut my dad and i are very different\nmy dad grew up with a very different mom\nthan i did my dad grew up in a very\ndifferent place the ussr\nis not an optimistic place you know a\nlot of americans a lot of people\nlistening around the world don't know\nthis the ussr was a jail\nit wasn't only that it was a difficult\ncountry we have difficult countries\naround the world you couldn't leave\nyou know i'm not educated i think you\ncan't leave north korea right like if\nyou leave it right\nnorth korea is the comp like you\ncouldn't leave the ussr so\nthat's called jail\nand so\nyou know he grew up in a very different\nplace that manifested in my father\nlooking at his employees very\ndifferently than i do looking at the\nworld differently\nand um we had some very serious\nconversations in the last 96 hours\nbecause i made this connection point i'm\nnot going to put them out there yet i i\nthink that's for him to put out there if\nhe wants to\nbut\nmy last book 12 and a half ingredients\nwhat i realized when i wrote it was oh\nit's not just empathy\noh it's not just ambition\nlike we're the makeup of like these\nthree combos these four combos in this\nsituation these two combos\nand what i think happened is there was\none ingredient that my dad wasn't using\nin combination\nthat if he starts using the way he has\nbeen the last two three days\na everybody around him is gonna be\nhappier but for me selfishly\nhe's gonna be happier and it um i'm\nreally glad that moment's connected my\ndad's had stop and starts of like\noptimistic points of view in the past\nwe all have i've had stops and starts\nwith candor let me make it about myself\ni've had i'm finally over to hump in the\nlast three four years um but uh it was a\nspecial moment and like i'm incredibly\nemotional about it because\nit could be a really big impact it was\nreally beautiful to see man thank you\nbrother and i loved how your response\nwas like dad you should have come\nearlier\nand look it's fun to do this with you\nbecause you're also one of the human\nbeings on earth that communicates in a\nway\nthat helps people it's a very\nheavy feeling to know that you can say\nsomething and can change someone's life\nyou know i think it's intoxicating i\nthink it's why a lot of therapists love\ntheir job i think it's why a lot of\npeople that are into meditation i think\nit's why teachers love their job i think\nit's why a lot of parents my mom had\nreal real sadness empty nest when aj\nleft she was a hall of fame mother when\nhe left she didn't get to play her you\nknow like so i think for\nmany of us around the world we do it\npublicly but a lot of people do it\nprivately or in small micro climates\nthere's nothing like saying something\nthat provides someone else value\nwhen that person ends up being some of\nthe people you love the most that goes\nto a different planet yeah no it's\nreally special and uh i think what you\njust said there it accord with me\nbecause\ni think we always want the answer to be\nlike well should i be this or should i\nbe that right you're talking about the\nopposites and it's like should i be\naffectionate or should i be assertive\nand it's like always shouldn't be\nassertive it's always and yeah something\ni've been really tapping into is and\nversus or yeah i feel like i'm very\neffective because of our political\ntemperature the last decade\nyou know purple\namerica has been really told in many\ndifferent ways and it's a left and right\nissue yeah this is not picking on any\none party it's just the climate it's the\npopular culture\ni'm watching my friends and\nacquaintances and business associates\nchange their opinion on issues because\nthey feel they have to be 100 red or 100\nblue it's it's incredibly devastating to\nme i know where they stand i'm watching\nthem change their mind\nbecause they're treating it as a tribe\nand the answer is purple\nyeah and so\npurple\nand versus ore this is a lot of the work\ni'm working on\nwithin myself through my content\naffecting my team um\nand then you know you know family team\nemployees the world you know i'm\nspending a lot of time on it and that's\nwhy that book was so fun for me because\nyou know i'm an enigma i confuse people\ni'm a contradiction people struggle with\nit and i see it as the strength\nit is the and that makes me work like i\nwant to build the biggest companies of\nall time yet i haven't come across a lot\nof people really genuinely naturally dna\ni'm not special luck of the draw\ni really want everyone else to win like\ni'm really about that life\ni love that you just said that because i\nhad a really dear friend who i respect\nwho's who we both know is is very\naccomplished in their own world he said\nto me recently he said to me jay the\nreason why i love having conversations\nwith you is because i can have a\nspiritual conversation we can then\nswitch to strategy and then we can talk\nabout content and he's like i appreciate\nthat you're one person that we can go\nthere and i was and that gave me\npermission to be that because by the way\ni'm the same paradox people are well\nused to be a monk but now you do media\nand you manage companies and people\ncan't not always figure that out like\nbut i am all of them and i'm okay with\nthat and i'd rather be all of them than\nhave to choose one a hundred percent and\nand a lot of people don't like\njuggling six balls\nand i think that's awesome i think life\nneeds to be talked way more around\nself-awareness and self-love like i\ncan't pick one thing gary so many of my\nfriends well-intended\nmost accomplished people on earth gary\nif you ever decided to pick one thing in\nfocus you would and i'm like i would die\nyeah you think because you did and it\nworks for you that's awesome that's why\nwhen i make content\ni say it with such passion and\nconviction i'm always trying to use\nlonger format platforms like this to\ntake a step back and create some clarity\ni'm asking people to do the things on\ntheir terms as passionately and all in\nas i am\ni'll talk about tactics yes tick tock is\nan arbitrage attention machine right now\nyes i believe you should post three four\ntimes a day but you don't have to yeah\nand more importantly if you dislike\nposting on tick tock\nthe way i dislike reading then you\nshould do it never yes and that's the\npart that people they want everything so\nblack and white when everything\neverything is gray absolutely i'm always\ntrying to\nshare my conviction\ntalk about the ease of leaning into\noneself but remind people don't be me\ni have high energy i have i have levels\nof charisma that aren't trained like\nmommy and daddy made love at the right\nsecond and i was born with certain\nthings it's the same reason that i've\nstruggled with candor do you know any\nfive minute meetings i have that are\nsuch a waste of time because they could\nhave been an 18 second reading of an\nemail but i can't do it\nand and and i just\ni was a dnf student because even as a\nchild i had some sort of subconscious\nforce\nthat just wasn't interested in not being\nme\nyou know yeah and i just want that for\nmore people like and and then that goes\ninto a framework that i get very\npassionate about\nmy\nfavorite thing about walking around\nearth is how visceral i am against\njudging people\nin an era that judgment of others has\nbecome the most popular pastime\nbut it starts with me not judging myself\ni have standards i have morals\nbut i don't beat myself up and as you\nknow because i'm sure you're on a\nreceiving end of\ndifferent but many of the same messages\nthat i get oh of course people are just\nso good at beating themselves up and i'm\nlike why\nlike everybody else sucks too like great\nso you're not good at this or you missed\nyour kids baseball game and you you're\nnot a bad parent when you're we need you\nknow another thing jay that i'm very\npassionate about\nintent needs to have a seat at the table\nwe've eliminated\nthe ability to try to figure out one's\nintent you suck because of this do you\nknow why they got there do you know how\nthis happened like we've just eliminated\nintent so these are all the feelings i\nthink through but you know like\ni am\ni definitely like doing a lot of things\nyeah and i and i love what you're saying\nbecause we'd rather project that label\nof judgment onto someone because then we\ndon't have to do the work to figure out\nhow they got there yeah i mean envy and\njealousy yeah are\nincredibly powerful traits\ni tend not to a lot of my friends throw\nit out about me about themselves i\nactually never go there it's very real\ni'm just trying to figure out the solve\nyes which is like\nbig things like can we reframe success\ncan we create clarification for example\nwith me i've spent the last five years\ntrying to really explain why i want to\nbuy the new york jets yeah because it's\na fun game\nnot like i need the new york do you know\nwhat i mean like\ni'm in a weird place now where i kind of\nwant like karen thompson to buy the jets\nand be the biggest person like good job\nkaren you did it like\ni'd want to try to buy the jets i don't\nneed the jets i want to try to build big\ncompanies it's fun\nprocess over the trophies i don't need\nthe trophies to close gaps of insecurity\nyeah and so like redefining success that\nwas that talk right after b-con a couple\ndays ago in vegas\nthe lady said you know she was so damn\nhappy and she's like but i'm not you\nknow making the dollars like everybody\nin this room like are you happy she's\nlike really happy i'm like you're the\nwinner of the room\nwe have to redefine success\nyou know i'm not against money i'm an\nentrepreneur i was born in the ussr and\ngrew up in america i'm like very pro\nanything in balance capitalism and\nbalance excites me to no end it's around\nmerit\nbut we need to teach all of ourselves\nthe simplicity of like what how like\nredefining success yeah yeah well that's\nthe fascinating thing about\nself-awareness going back to your\nearlier point that i found that\nenvy and jealousy when you don't have\nself-awareness you're envious and\njealous of everyone correct when you\nhave self-awareness it at least limits\nyour envy and jealousy to what you do\nand then you can actually do something\nwith it and do something about it and so\nself-awareness actually gets you halfway\nthere in the battle against gender cnn\ni'm obsessed with it you know it it\nbrings you better relationships when a\nhuman is tone deaf of like how people\nare affected by them they're in a very\nvery vulnerable spot um self-awareness\nis very attractive and something that i\ni hope society keeps pounding on i\nbelieve that you're someone who\nhas a even better\nprivate life than you do public life\nyeah i mean you know obviously listen\ni've gone you know through my personal\nthings like anybody else but\nyou know what you know how i would\nanswer that\ni'm\nwildly content and at peace\nand i don't think that\nwould make sense to most people that\nconsume me because i'm so frantic as a\ncommunicator i'm such high energy\ni think the thing i always enjoy\nwhen people get close to me and i'm\nlooking at dustin and seth behind is\nlike\nthere's incredible levels of confusion\non the calmness\nand like the ability to absorb\nyou know\nbad situations and that has so much to\ndo with personal life right like friends\nand family\ni feel really good about it i think a\nlot of it has to do with the lack of\nexpectation i have of others\ndoesn't mean i don't require like any\nhuman being but like i'm\nincredibly compassionate\nnot just empathetic and i think when you\ncombine compassion and empathy you get\ninto a really zeni fun place i find that\nyou know i've been really thinking this\nthrough i'm like oh\nthose two because not only can i feel\nyou\nbut when you come with something that\nisn't great\ni'm going quickly to\nare you okay\nversus this hurts me\nand so that gives me a very good\npersonal life yeah i again trials and\ntribulations like any human on life from\ndifferent various things especially\ncandor i would tell you that everything\nthat i've had challenges with in my life\nprofessionally and personally has been\nbecause i'm non-confrontational which\nagain blows people away because on stage\ni'm incredible at it because i'm talking\nto the world\nwhen i'm talking to the world i can't\nsee your name or your face and so i can\njust have really good observations to\nincredibly\nclean data because very few people on\nearth read the comments from human\nbeings at the level that i do that's\nwhat i do for a living yeah yeah so i\nhave crazy insights uh one that really\ncaught me was how many wealthy kids were\nupset with their parents for paying\nthings\nbut didn't want to give up\nthat one really triggered me in four or\nfive years because i didn't grow up in\nthat environment i was like oh this is a\nwild one this is a very unhappy 25 year\nold with a tesla a sick apartment in la\nan unlimited uber equinox but they real\nbut the subconscious\nis starting to take over and they\nrealize their parents think they're\nlosers that's why they're paying for\neverything and it becomes you know\nbreaking those things down yeah so yeah\ni think i think i am very happy because\ni'm very simple\ni'm way simpler in business and content\nthan people realize i'm very simple in\nlife i don't really want stuff\ni like playing\ni like playing you know i like\ncompetition that's something i'm\npassionate about i've been thinking a\nlot about competition\nyou know i'm thinking about why is there\nso much anxiety in the system of course\num\nsocial media pipes i i don't blame\nsocial the way people do i just think\nthat people are being exposed yeah i'm\nwith you yeah this was this was\nhappening at dinner tables yeah and so\nlike that's right yeah like so like so i\nthink people want to blame platforms\nthis is about a human thing and i think\nevery country is different every\nreligion is different race gender is a\nlot going on but i really think that\nthere's a lot of fun little pieces put\ntogether that got us to certain places\ni think eliminating merit and demonizing\ncompetition has been a misstep\ni i think it came from great\nintent i think parents didn't want kids\ncrying they didn't want them to feel bad\nbut we started training that 18th place\nis the same as first place eliminating\nmerit\nis not a happy place yeah it leads to a\nvery unhappy place yeah and so you know\nit's funny the things that get me going\nambition and competition i'm in feels\nvery red\nkindness over anything else including\nthose two things\nyou know and because it's purple yeah\nand that's where my soul is right now\nyeah for the world because i think so\nmuch of what i am and what what i became\nwas my mom and my dna and my\ncircumstance\nfilled all the gaps along the way i\nwalked into high school 4 foot 11\nfour foot eleven\nconfident yeah not because i thought i\nwould get the cheerleader or it was\ngonna be the most popular because i had\nzero interest in that validation yeah\nnot that i thought it was better not\nthat i thought it was better and i think\nthese you know these papa\ni just wanted to be nice to everybody i\nwant to do my baseball card shows i want\nto get my d's and f's on my way to going\nto the wine business i wanted everybody\nto be happy and it really hasn't stopped\nthe buddha thousands of years ago called\nit the middle path right the idea that\nwe're trying to go is it left or is it\nright is it this or that it's like no\nit's the middle path and what you were\njust saying around eliminating merit i\nthink one of the bigger challenges is\ntrying to eliminate pain early on in\nlife 100 because you just become fragile\ncorrect and it's fascinating to me how\nmuch we don't realize that fragility is\nbeing spread by limiting i was beaten up\nevery day at school primary school every\nsingle day because i was the only indian\nkid at school i was the only overweight\nkid in school yeah and so i got beaten\nup every single day my and it was just\nwhat i went through and same same as you\nsimilarly funnily enough and we've never\ntalked about this but\npeople are like did that affect you i'm\nlike no not really because i wasn't\nlooking for love from that person\ncorrect because even then i knew that\nthat person had more pain in their life\nthan me they grew up on the councillor\nstage yeah they they had their parents\nhad a broken marriage they had so much\nmore context even at that age that i\ncould go home to my mom and dad i think\ni think it's real i think kids not going\noutside like parents are too involved i\nget it again\nbest intent\nbest intent\nbut i believe in it yeah i believe that\nwe have demonized losing when losing is\nthe best\nlike for me it was school was telling me\ni was going to be a failure so you have\ngrown-ups left and right friends parents\nand teachers you will be a garbage i\nmean the favorite thing back in the 80s\nyou're going to be garbage man big shout\nout to the garbage yeah and women first\nof all but that was the cliche thing in\n84-87 like i can't wait to be like i'm\ngoing to be garbage like like they just\nreally\nit was only college it was only grades\nso that and then i competed 24 7. i was\nalways competing and when you compete\nall the time you're losing a lot and i\ncried i cried from 6 to 12 every time i\nlost anything video games checkers uno\nfootball because i hated the feeling but\nthe layers of skin that i have\nyou know and that makes sense to me\nabout you you can't be out there at the\nlevel we're out there if you don't have\nthat stomach you won't do it you won't\nput yourself we all now can everybody\ncan put themselves out there\npeople won't do it if they don't have\nthat layer of skin and i you know i\nagree with you like and it's a tough\nchallenge but we have to get kids to\nlike get comfortable with losing yeah\nget comfortable with discomfort even if\nyou're not losing yet just getting\ncomfortable with disco and we've really\ngone the other way especially if there's\nmoney if the family has a couple bucks\nit's been completely eliminated yeah\nyeah parents are going to school\nfighting for their kids like my kids\nshould have got an a like we're doing\ntoo much and then they're 22 and they\nhave to live life\nand they go into the workplace and\nthey're like i should be the vp of this\ncompany gary i'm like you've been here\nfour weeks yeah i'm like you start your\nown company like yeah\nyou know like have you found have you\nfound clever ways with your daughter to\nbe able to do things like that like have\nyou found yes i'm hacking all the time\nwith my two kids like encouraging\ncompetition how do you do that with give\nme because i'm not a parent\noh beat them in everything my dad used\nto do that to me\ni wish aj was here like aj my mom used\nto get so mad at me because we were\nsiblings not it's your child and i'm 11\nyears older\nso we're playing one-on-one basketball\ni'm 18. he's seven and i am beating him\nfor a couple of reasons one i believed\nit\ntwo i didn't want to lose\nthree\ni always knew when it happened i'm like\none day he's gonna be 17\nand i'm gonna be you know 28 and he's\ngoing to beat me he's going to be and\nyou know like i needed to get my wins on\nthe board because yeah i think beating\nthem i think talking about adversity\nexplaining\nnon-conformant\nleaning in\nyou know and so that's how yeah i like\nthat my dad was like that it was really\ninteresting because i think men and\nwomen react differently to that but as a\nguy like my dad was like that he would\nnever pass he would he would get in\nfront of an open goal soccer i'm talking\nabout yeah came from an open goal he\ncould pass to me for his son to score\nand he'd go and score we'd be playing\nfather and son yeah and honestly you\nknow i've been thinking a lot because\ni'm so soft-skilled yeah there's so many\nmoms i know that were like we'll never\nlet like the dad is i'm thinking about\none couple right now where it's like i\njust think it's a dna trait it's a\nculture trait\nbut i think competition and losing\nand adversity need to be championed zero\nto twelve yeah when they've been\ncompletely taken out of the equation\nyeah and i believe the entitlement\nand the pain\nis a direct correlation i really do yeah\ni really do what i got out of that was\nthat it helped me\nbecome my own man because i didn't have\nmy dad passing me the ball i didn't have\nmy dad passing it on and so for me it\ngave me no framework\ni took that to the extreme by the time i\nwas 18 or 19 i was\ni mean this is really i think my dad's\nabout to start consuming my content so\ni'm going to be very i'm going to tread\nlightly here but dad if you're listening\nat 18 or 19 i became equally as\nimportant to the business and by 22 i\nwas much more important in the business\nand so like i took it to the extreme\nright like you know the\nresponsibility the\nthe\nputting it on your own two feet like\nwe need a lot more of that yeah no\nparent is doing their kid a favor\nby putting training wheels on their life\nyeah\nyeah i love that\ngary i'm asking this with love and you\nknow for me this was a big thing i i\nthink it was like\ni think i'd been making content for two\nyears\nbefore i introduced my community to my\nwife yes\nand everyone's like jay you're married\nlike people had no idea because i just\ndidn't talk about her because we just\ngot married we'd been together for a few\nyears before that i was like i need to\nbe careful about of course what we're\ngonna say where this is going how this\nfeels you've recently been more open\nabout your relationship yes we don't\nhave to go there this is you're being\nvery kind and i appreciate it because i\nrespect you i'm asking it from the time\ni am incredibly private as you know and\nthe world knows\nbecause i'm going through a transition\nin my life i felt like it got to a place\nwhere it was not sustainable for me to\nbe 100 private and so i've been\na little more public it is something\nthat i'm\ndesperately not interested in even the\npart we just talked about with my kids\nlike it's not somewhere i want to go\nyeah i don't want to go i don't want to\ntalk about my kids yeah i don't want to\ntalk about my personal weakness no no i\nwant you to keep this okay and i'll tell\nyou why i want to remind people you're\nin control yeah\nit's incredibly important and\nappropriate\nand i appreciate especially being very\ncordial for people to ask and things of\nthat nature but i want to remind people\nthey're in control yeah i want to\nprovide value and put out things in my\nprofessional career\ni'm incredibly private and\nfeel that the world is entitled to what\nyou give it\nso when i watch people get upset when\npeople get into their business i'm like\nyou're giving them your business by the\nway you're leveraging your business\ni don't want to leverage nor give\nmy personal life to the world\ni don't think that's the right way yeah\nby the way yeah i just think it's my way\nyeah um so the reason i have a little\nbit to what you're referring to is it\nbecame not sustainable because it's been\na long time and like i was in a transit\nlike it just it was the appropriate time\nyeah and i needed to just get some\ncontext out there but i'm uh it's not\nwhere i'm gonna go yeah and that's what\ni was more interested by to me it's not\nlisten us being together my brain goes\ninto maximize the value\nat the highest levels because we have\nthe opportunity to for as many people\nare listening the takeaway there from my\nperspective is you're in control yeah\nyou have a learning disability and you\nwant to share it mazel tov you don't\ngreat yeah it took me back to something\nless serious it took me\n15 years of public life to say i'm not\ncandarous and it's hurt me my personal\nlife and it's hurt me in my business\nlife\nyou get to share what you want to share\nyeah and and i think people\nshould be careful of what they share yes\nyou share your abs as a like as a like\nyou're a good shape dude people are\ngoing to talk about your body for the\nrest of your life yeah\nyeah but you did that you're going to\nshow your kid all the time they're going\nto talk about that relationship they're\ngoing to talk\nyou're giving the world permission yeah\ni prefer not to give the world\npermission because that's a sacred place\nfor me yeah you know even look at my mom\nshe like the greatest gift i could give\nto the world is my mom to the world the\ngreatest\nshe's alpha me\nshe's more experienced she's a different\nperspective as a mom as a she doesn't\nwant it the end\nright\ni thought my dad and mom would be\nreverse\nmy dad i never thought would love the\nlimelight so much um but you know so\ni think if you're listening right now\nplease if you're not going on social\nmedia because you have a skeleton in\nyour closet\nyou have a disease\nyou have a bad you know situation you uh\nyou're like me and like grew up in a\nfamily where like personal life is\nprivate that's i think you know in\nrussia that was like people would go to\njail if anybody knew anything about you\nso i think it ingrained in my parents\nwhich then ingrained in me and my sister\nand brother like we're private that way\num you know i think you have to\nunderstand you're in control\nfacebook and tick tock and podcast and\nyoutube don't make you do anything yeah\nthey don't make you do anything i'm so\nglad you addressed that because i think\nthere's and this is why i brought it up\ni think there's been a\nmosque of false vulnerability that's\nbeen encouraged because of social media\nso people think that the more vulnerable\nor more open you're sure that shows\nauthenticity yeah i totally disagree i\nlove you for that you're going to a very\nsmart place i would argue\ni see more lack of authenticity in the\nway that people are leveraging their\nfamily and personal life\nbecause they know it does well yeah i\ndon't want to go too deep because again\nthis is what's fun about being candice\nin general but i would never ever say\nthis to a human being\nthere's people who\nare leveraging their children\nfor brand deals\nthat's something worth thinking about\nyeah\nlike like right now those kids aren't\ntalking about that to you because they\ndon't talk because they're four\nor because they're 16 not ready to have\nthat combo but like i think all of us\nhave to think about things like that\nyeah and i think for me as an observer\nof you\ni always respect that and that's why\nwe're so intrigued and i still respect\nthere's still some respect but it's\nbecause i went through that journey in\nmy own head yeah even with my own wife\nthat i've been together with and even\nwhat we share\nand where we should it's like really\nintense like to me\nyour family is the most sacred like\nthat's who's going to be around you when\nyou're dying yeah like right and so like\nyou have to think three times\nbefore you start letting anything in\nright and by the way the other thing is\ni don't want to make decisions for other\npeople yeah i was built to be\nunstoppable you know what i mean like\nlike when you see where i'm going\nfor that judgment if that person it's\nhard enough if you choose it imagine\nsomeone else choosing it for you yes and\nso like please everyone be thoughtful on\nthis one yeah and by the way if you're\nlistening right now and it's really\nhitting but you already opened up\nkimonos box it's never close it's never\nlate to close actually you can close\nthat yeah we evolve we change yeah i\nwill\nmake mistakes i will change i will\nevolve i will do good things like we we\nneed\na lot more\ncivility and patience for each other\nyeah if you've been sharing everything\nand you decide off of this podcast which\ni'm sure there's five to 500 people that\njust decided right now\nthen you just stop and when people ask\nwhere's johnny your boyfriend because\nlike you you can answer it you don't\nhave to answer it but like you're in\ncontrol people have to understand\nthey're in control accountability you\nknow be friends is my is the scaled\nversion of me mm-hmm you know be friends\nyou know this is actually something i\nshould talk to you about offline you\nshould really debate this yeah the\nbuilding intellectual property to scale\none's message is very powerful that's\nwhat me and ryan were just talking about\nso i'd love to yeah yeah like like i met\nthis woman in her late 60s early 70s\nsomebody introduced me to her i want to\ni'm looking to potentially hire her to\nbe a storyteller and be friends she\nworked for jim henson well\nwe're just getting to know each other\nbut like the brief for fraggle rock the\nbrief for the entire show was stop war\nand it was like the most profound out of\nall these 16 months that's been the most\nprofound moment so far of my journey of\nbe friends because v friends is\nto make people happier\nbut i think happiness comes in a lot of\nforms not demonizing competition\nmy favorite character i want to develop\nis a countable aunt\njay i think the lack of accountability\nis leading to so much unhappiness\nlike life is so much better when you're\nlike this was my fault yeah absolutely\nyou're in control yeah and so like you\nknow this was like a wrap up to control\nyou're in control you\nyou you decide what you consume you\ndecide what you believe you decide who\nyou surround yourself with you decide\nwhat you put out\ntake on accountability yeah everybody\nwants to blame right now the algorith\nthey're acting as their algorithms are\nlike hypnosis and i understand endorphin\nhits and all that but like you can\ndelete the app\nyou can\nlike where is accountability in this\nyeah right yeah absolutely no we have\nalcohol we have tobacco we have drugs we\nhave weapons and we have all sorts of\nissues but most people play within\nmoderation that's on you yeah and it's a\ntough truth right it's a it's a tough\nit's a tough it's a tough truth\nespecially when you're unhappy yeah yeah\nthat goes back to why it's important\nit's like the chicken and egg it's like\nworking out like\ni got into better shape the last eight\nyears nothing comes less natural to me\nyeah nothing comes less natural to me\nright like\nbut like i was like i just would like to\nlive longer yes i would just like to\nlive longer yeah and\ngo figure it's not apple cider\ngummies it's not steroids it's not\nimplants i've thought about i'm like can\ni get chest implants i've put in a lot\nof work i feel like i've got like sets\ngood like i feel like i'm demonic seth\nbut like my body type like you know and\ni'm like i probably haven't but uh but\nbut no it's like eat well\ngo in the gym yeah do the right things\nand so same for life\nyou know whether it's meditation whether\nit's exercise whether it's therapy\nwhether it's good conversations whether\nit's surrounding you know you know back\nto us not having to certain you know\nwe've had some meals we've had some\ninteractions they're always like they're\nnice we need more i would like that yeah\nand we'll build on that i think you know\ni i'm spending more time thinking about\nspending more time with more while\ndoubling down on core\nyou know yeah\nyou know because i've been i did a\nreally good job in the last 10 years of\ndoubling down on core\nbut but i think being as busy and i love\nwhat i do\nyou know i really do want to build out a\nmore of a friend network more i want to\ntake more people from\nlightweight acquaintance to solid\nacquaintance i want to take people from\nacquaintance to friend from friend to\nbest friend and so i'm on a journey like\neverybody else but\ni think that um\ni god i think\nbelieve it or not this is going to sound\nso crazy for so many\nthe world actually has so much potential\nfor everybody listening\nto be\nthe best time to be alive\nmedicine and technology and there's so\nmuch but we're caught right now it's\nlike a hamster wheel we're in the\nmomentum of focusing on\nyou know the bad yeah and there's\nthere's always bad yeah\nthe the holocaust was bad\ngenocide is always going on genghis khan\nwas not a fun time to be a human yeah\nlike you know like we we are very bad at\nhistory i was a really bad student but i\ndid well in history like but that starts\nwith you what are you going to do about\nit because right now everyone's like\npointing\nand feels like it's on someone else it\nstarts with ourselves i mean when you\nsaid that and you brought up the\nholocaust i recently read edith iger's\nbook the gift she lived through the\nholocaust\nand she had that mindset in the\nholocaust so she said the only way she\ngot through it is she realized that she\nwasn't a prisoner that the only\nprisoners were the guards because they\nwere prisoners of their own conscience\nunbelievable that was her mindset she's\nright and it's and you know\nshe's like overnight you know or even\nolder and it's like\nit's just phenomenal that her victor\nfranco who wrote man search for meaning\nthese two phenomenal books if anyone\nhasn't read them like they had that in\nthat scenario well that's the point i\nalways make to everybody like you know\nthe only thing that works for me is\ntrying to contextualize moments in time\nyeah and like you know our great great\ngreat grandparents had it rough by\ncomparison the way we have it and sure\nthey had some things that were better on\nsimplicity but we must choose optimism\nbecause what's the alternative pessimism\nlike are you just gonna decide because\nonce you decide\nwhere are you\nonce you decide it's bad it's actually\nbad\nand so like\none of the things that makes me very\npassionate to communicate is\npractical optimism\nor\nthe fact that i believe negativity is\nmuch better at marketing than positivity\noh for sure i feel a huge sense of\nresponsibility what has become out of\nall the things you've pursued because\ni'm guessing at different stages in your\nlife and anyone who hasn't heard i've\ninterviewed gary twice before so you can\ngo back and listen to those\nyou've pursued different things at\ndifferent times and every time i meet\nyou it's a really\nwhat i love about it is that you just\nthere's so much growth and acceptance\nand embracing of this new you every time\nwe talk i feel like i'm talking to a\neven more self-aware human which is a\nreally fun feeling when you're checking\nin with someone in this way\nand so i go what what have you found\ncurrently to be the most worthy pursuit\nlike what what is it that you're\npursuing that you've found worthy of\nit's always been the same thing for me\nit's almost as if i'm living two\nseparate lives the most worthy pursuit\nis i'm wildly gifted\nand helping other people and i'm\nincredibly comfortable\nof also being okay with feeding myself\naround my own interests the most\nworthwhile pursuit my friends i think is\ngoing to land with you is\nthe continuous\nbalance beam that i walk on that is\ncalled equal parts selfish\nand equal part selfless and refining\nthat skill set and i think in the three\ntimes if i may off of your analogy i\nthink the beam is getting thinner and\ni'm still walking it\nyou know yeah maybe the first time we\nmet it was like an olympic beam or a\nhigh school beam maybe the second time\nwas you know my hope is that as i\ncontinue to go i'll be on a tightrope\nacross manhattan and walk it easily\nbecause\nme playing my game of entrepreneurship\ngives me so much energy that i'm able to\ndeploy it\nin a positive manner at scale\nand i find it fascinating and so that is\nwhat i continue to go after i love that\ngary 40 minutes with you feels like an\nhour and two hours with someone else\nthank you man thank you brother the best\nthank you bro i appreciate it so much if\nyou want even more videos just
