    "transcript": "if i really wanted to i'd be the biggest\nguy in the financial industry you know\nthat line so it's not that if you really\nwanted to you don't think you can do it\nso that's really a cop-out way of doing\nthat we've all done this before so one\nof the first questions i wanted to ask\nyou\nbecause i've seen this in your videos\nand i get fascinated because i'm i'm\nmassively into visualization of being\nsurrounded by\ninspiration tell us about the\nsignificance behind your dead mentors\npainting in your office\nbecause\nthat we see in all the videos and i also\nsee the uh the marvel characters too and\ni'm just like dude like it looks like\nyou've got like universal studios\ni love it you know it's funny you say\nthat it's it's right over you to the\nside i don't even know if you can see it\nor not it's all the way over there so\nit's the office turned into studios so\nyou know the painting to me is eight\ncharacters that mean a lot to me\nuh einstein is obviously one of the most\nbrilliant minds out there and have a big\nstatue of einstein in my house\nand einstein's philosophy on math is\nslightly different than milton friedman\nwho was a famous economist capitalist\nbut they kind of debate they clash a\nlittle bit and you have kennedy and\nlincoln and they clash a little bit and\nthey're both presidents you got tupac\nand mlk they clash a little bit you know\nso and then you have the shah of iran\nwhich is uh you know the shah was there\nwhen i was born in iran three months\nbefore he was in exile\nand then senna which in my opinion is\nthe greatest formula one race car driver\nand i named my daughter\nafter his last name ceno so my\ndaughter's name is senna be david\nafter his last name and then they're\nsitting there debating two books\none book is one form of economy the\nother book is another form of economy so\nthey're debating atlas shrug and\ncommunist manifesto which j it's kind of\nlike the complete opposite\nof religions in economy\nand then you know they're just having\nthat kind of a conversation in a bank\nvault and then the three uh characters\nthere with the hulk and um\nbatman and joker is an element of my\npersonality i have a little bit of all\nthree of them\nand then at the front i also have\ncaptain america not captain america um\noptimus prime he's 93 1400 pounds and it\nwas custom custom-made in malaysia we\nbrought it in i thought i said i gotta\nhave it so those are some of the things\nthat have in my office here\nyeah i mean that already tells us so\nmuch about you and how your mind works\nand uh we we share a lot of people in\ncomments so on this wall and my other\npodcast wall which i'd love to see when\nyou come to la we have einstein mlk\ni have mohammed ali on this wall i have\ntwo pack on my wall too i also have uh\nsome of nikolai tesla's first ever\npatented\nmotors but what i love about what you\njust shared there is this\nembracing of paradoxes like opposites\nand and i'm someone who gets fascinated\nby that too like what is why do you find\nparadoxes and opposites and\nideas that seemingly collide so\nfascinating that you have in that\npainting\nyou know what's crazy when i was a kid\ngrowing up i watched rocky iv and when\nyou watch rocky in iran\nwhen you watch rocky and iran with\npersian dialect because it was all i\nmean you know you watch some of the\nmovies whether it's whatever dialect it\nis and you're in iran watching it in\nfarsi sly sounds different but when you\nwatch the movie\nat that time the the\nyou know tensions in america and russia\nwas very high i mean a lot higher than\nwhat it is today with russia today\nrussia has been replaced by china but\nback in the days it was really russia\nand u.s going at it right\nand you saw him\ngoing to russia to fight drago who\nkilled his best friend and then at the\nend he says a message he says if i can\nchange if you can change if he can\nchange\nanybody can change i just i just got the\nchills all over my body thinking about\nthis message and in my family my parents\nmy father was an imperialist and my\nmother was a communist i mean complete\ndifferent philosophy when it comes onto\npolitics and i watched him go at it all\nthe time so it always came down to\nrepublicans think democrats have no clue\nwhat they're talking about democrats\nthink republicans have no clue what\nthey're talking about i have friends on\nboth sides that are brilliant and i\nalways want to know how did you come to\nyour conclusion of your views how did\nyou come to your conclusion of your\nviews and there's truth on both sides\nand there's a lot to be learned on both\nsides so\nfor me you know the reason why i look at\nit from that standpoint is you look at\namerica today we're pretty divided\nsometimes\njust because somebody else is a\ndifferent color or a different\nbackground or different age or different\nreligion or different political\naffiliation\nwe probably have a few thousand things\nin common\nand maybe 11 things that are not in\ncommon if we focus on more the things\nthat we have in common we'll figure out\na way to bring people together so this\nis one of the reasons why i love a\nhealthy debate i love watching debates\nlike for me\nyou know people like to fight you know\nmaybe watch a ufc fight or a box i like\nto watch a good debate on youtube that's\nwhat i enjoy that's entertainment for me\nthat's why these two topics always sit\ndown to get it kind of fascinating to me\nyeah what a great answer man that really\nreally refreshing to hear that what's\nsomething what's something that you've\nbeen debating with a friend or or your\nfamily or your wife recently like what's\nbeen what's been a discussion or debate\ni mean it doesn't need to be serious it\ncould be anything yeah i mean\nfriendly stuff i have a friend of mine\nhis name is steve let me tell you steve\nand i we go back he was the michael\njordan of our high school okay so this\nguy holds all the records\nand\nhe was the guy that we would i would\nbring my dad just to watch this guy play\nhe was fascinating now\nif he and i can go anywhere we can be in\nuh you know madrid colombia you're\nanywhere we can be there's gonna be a\nmoment where we debate the greatest\nbasketball player of all time and we can\ngo for five hours just say heat it\npeople think we hate each other we're\nscreaming you out of your mind you're\ncrazy\nand it's just exciting you know he says\nhe's a lebron guy and secretly he likes\nto say jordan but he's really a lebron\nguy and i'm going back with data and i'm\ngiving him data but it's not about data\nand he comes up and he says you never\nplayed organized basketball i play with\nthe highest level guys you don't really\nunderstand basketball but it's so\nentertaining am i we have two of our\nfriends who just sit there and they just\nenjoy it you know and then you can talk\nabout debates about what's the greatest\ngame you know what's the greatest leader\nof all time i mean it could be anything\nwhen i was a kid\nwe would come down from uh chevy chase\nwhen i lived in glendale we would come\ndown from doran because i went to wilson\njunior high school and we would walk all\nthe way down and i lived off of broadway\nright by the post office it was a good\n20-minute drive a 20-minute walk that\n20-minute walk when we would go my\nfriends\nwe would talk about things we would say\nhey jay let me ask you this\nyou could be the most powerful person in\nthe world president you could be the\nrichest man in the world you could be\nthe person that is the most spiritual\nleader that's from whatever church you\nchoose a billy graham-esque type of a\nperson a chopra tap somebody that has\nthat kind of a stature you can be the\ngreatest athlete the greatest performer\nso michael jackson michael jordan\npresident all this stuff who would you\nchoose and then people would say i would\nchoose this\nand that would lead to a dialogue why\nwouldn't you want to be the billionaire\nwhy wouldn't you want to be the\npresident and i wouldn't want i would\nwant to be the person that makes an\nimpact who cares about making an impact\nyou wanted it was exciting and you're\nlearning so much and i think you know uh\nmore today if we had more people from\nopposing sides debating topics we would\nlearn so much rather than just one-sided\nmessage being given to us yeah what a\ngreat answer man you then you feel and\ni'm hearing this from you that\nit sounds like when you're debating with\nyour friend or we're having these\ndiscussions\nthese debates are\non when they're on but then when you're\noff you go back to being friends again\nand there's this mutual respect and\nunderstanding and\nyou know when i i remember being part of\nmy school's debate team and i i really\nenjoyed it back then so i was i was big\ninto it back then not so much anymore\nbut what i found is that the way we were\ntrained was you could only debate\nwhen you knew both sides fully\nso you couldn't debate just\nunderstanding your side like you had to\nunderstand the opposing side so if i was\ndebating with you on this movie versus\nthat movie yeah i should have had to\nhave watched and analyzed both movies i\ncan't simply argue it on the basis of my\nknowledge of my\nuh my you know my most powerful as you'd\ncall it and i just think that i think\nthat's what you're you're raising like\nwhen i'm hearing you i'm like yeah what\npatrick's really saying is that\nhealthy debate is needed\nwhen when you're able to do in a\nmutually respectful way but sometimes\nthe debates we watch today are just so\nlike\nlowballing and you know they're not\nrespectful i don't know if that's the\nright word but that's the word that's\nkind of coming to the top of my mind\nthat\nyou know debates are ones where you have\ncomplete respect for the person you're\nspeaking to it's not it's not like a rap\nbattle where you're demeaning them you\nknow it's it's not putting them down\nbecause debate isn't about putting the\nother person down\nyou made by the way what school was this\njay what school did you go to i went to\nschool in london called queen\nelizabeth's boys school so it was it was\na grammar school it wasn't paid for but\nit was uh it was yeah it was good school\nthat's powerful i mean i love that idea\nwhat you you know it's interesting it\nreminded me of me of something because\ni i sat down with the bush family and i\nsat down with rfk because i'm always\ncurious about the kennedy family how do\nyou build a legacy like that where so\nmany people\nand robert f kennedy robert kennedy jr\nthe son of robert kennedy who was\nrunning\nhe said i said how was it like being a\nkennedy and he says you know it's crazy\nevery night\nwe had to debate a topic and our dad\nwould sit us down and he would say so\nwhat do you think about\nyou know fascists what do you think\nabout germany what do you think about\nwhat's going on here with what do you\nthink about this do you think war is\ngood tell me about drugs why shouldn't\nwe use drugs i said your dad would ask\nyou these questions he says yes he says\nbecause every night at the dinner table\nhe wanted us kids to debate each other\nand that was a kennedy thing that was a\nkennedy thing i remember one time arnold\ntold a story\nsaying when he met john f kennedy he\nasked john f kennedy what's your\nfavorite color and john f kennedy said\nwe like red\nand arnold's like what do you mean he\nsays what is your favorite color and he\nsays we like red what what i don't\nunderstand what this means it's just we\nare a tight knit of kennedys and we back\neach other up right and on the bush side\nit's the same thing as well the the\nfather all the way back grandfather\nprescott which is senior's father\nsimilar situation which is a healthy\ndebate so you know when you said the\nonly way you can debate another topic is\nto sit down and actually\nuh know more about the other side so you\nhave the moral authority to debate a\ntopic i think that is a brilliant point\nyou just made right there and the other\npart i would say is the following you\nknow how in boxing\nif you go under the belt they take a\npoint away you know if you go a certain\nsite\nwhat if they had a point system you know\nhow they i don't know if you're a\nbasketball guy if you watch the nba a\nlot if you watch the nba all-star this\nyear do you remember the fourth quarter\nhow d how great of a fourth quarter was\ni don't know if you watched the fourth\nquarter jay\nit was\nthe greatest quarter of basketball i've\nseen in my lifetime and i've watched a\nlot about and here's why they changed\nthe guidelines because all star\nalways had a black eye because\nnobody would watch the all-star game\nbecause no one played defense just like\nwell you know you go score and you go\nscore and do whatever you do they\nchanged the format and it was\nhere's who gets to 155 first so it\nwasn't like who wins by 19 points so\nthey took the clock off and they said\nwhoever gets to 155 wins all of a sudden\nyou saw lebron playing the kind of\ndefense you've never seen before john is\nplaying defense you've never seen before\nand it changes so you bring up a good\npoint to know that maybe we need to we\nneed to change the format of the debates\nand have a scoring system behind it i\ndon't know i think there's a way of\nimproving this thing because the way\nit's going right now this is not how\ndebates were years ago today when you\nlook at debates\nand it's getting uglier and uglier and\nugly and it's almost as if everybody\nfeels they need to do that\nto advance because if they don't then\nyou don't take a shot first and you got\nto take the shot so i don't know if we\ndebate issues i really like the approach\nyou're taking but for me\ni just feel like when it comes down to\nissues i i really think we need more\ndebates uh i do think we need more\npeople that are on both sides that are\nwilling to be open to the other side's\ndecision hey here's how i feel the way i\ndo why do you feel the way you do like a\nlot of times when i'm interviewing guys\ni'll say what brought you to this point\nso i'm interviewing uh uh joe arpaio\nwho's one of the hey this guy in arizona\nsheriff you know i'm sitting down it's\nlike how did you become the way you are\nwhy are you such a nat like you want you\nact like you like being an why\nare you this way what happened in your\nfamily and then you go back and you go\nback and you go back then he told the\nstory then like no wonder this makes\nsense of course a person like that has\nto be this way because you went through\na moment where you were bullied and you\nhad to almost stand up and it happened\nso many times and you lost trust in\nsomebody and you felt like this was the\nonly thing so we have to kind of look at\nall those things combined together but\nit'd be great to go to a different\nformat of debating i think a lot more\npeople would learn more about the topics\nwe're dealing with today this is a\nfascinating conversation already because\ni wasn't expecting to go here at all so\ni'm really glad that we've kind of gone\ndown this because i think the point is\nthat for so many of us we're actually\nscared of debate because we see it as a\nnegative thing like we see debates as\nlike challenging conflict you know full\nof like and so because we've made debate\nthat way it's now something that people\nshould you know hide away from and try\nand avoid but if we can find a way where\nwe can all start entertaining ideas that\nwe may not accept yet and and processing\nit there's a lot of value in that and\nit's and i'm glad that you've kind of\nbrought that value out of it for us and\nand kind of pushed that because yeah\nit's it's definitely needed more of but\ni mean when you talk about that where\nyou are now what i find interesting just\nlistening to you\nis\nyou and this is how i feel when i watch\nyour videos and and i've been really\nwatching you during the pandemic and i\nthink you've made some incredible points\nyou have this ability where you'd like\nto really analyze things and you like to\nlook at it from lots of different\nperspectives and\nit's it's kind of like how what you were\njust saying now if you watched and i by\nthe way i'm a huge rocky fan too so if\nyou watch just one fight of the rocky\nmovie let's say uh number three with mr\nt\nand you watch the first fight where\nrocky loses\nand you only see that fight you now have\nno context of anything else apart from\nrocky just lost\nand and that's sometimes how we approach\nlife that if you look at things through\njust one lens or one snapshot you don't\nget the bigger picture and so i want to\nask you when you were in debt when you\nwere in that snapshot of your life\nwhat were you analyzing that helped you\nmove out of that position because i\nthink a lot of people listening or\nwatching right now maybe experiencing\ndeath maybe expensive experiencing\nfinancial challenges\nhow did you analyze that situation or\ndid you analyze at all\nwhen i was at my lowest point is that\nwhat you okay yeah you know it's a good\nquestion because um\nuh it is december 31st of 2002 okay i'm\nin my fourth focus with a buddy of mine\ntony we're at laurel canyon right behind\nuniversal studios we're listening to\nryan seacrest do his countdown we're\nacross the street from that in and out\nif you know what i'm talking about\nthere's an in and out i'm parked right\nacross on an uphill like this\nand we're sitting there and i hear\nryan's secrets go ten\nnine on you know 102.7 eight seven six\nfive four three two one and typically\ni would be in vegas typically i would be\nin vegas or party or a night club or you\nknow oh my gosh you know and then you're\ndancing you're doing what you're doing\nand it's exciting when it's a new year\njay was the first time when new year\nhappened and i'm just sitting there i'm\nnot excited about anything\nit's kind of like\nso what we're going into 2003.\nnothing's changed life's the same why\nwould i be excited about this\nwe just bought it in and out we split it\nwith our hands we bought water and\nbought lemon on the side and squeezed it\nwith sweetener to make lemon i'm just\nsitting there saying let me get this\nstraight you are 23 years old 24 years\nold at the time\nyou have some gifts you have some\ntalents your dad's in and out of the\nhospital your mom went back to iran\nbecause you ran out of money\nand your party in here what do you want\nto do about this i mean you have a few\nchoices right now you're in that 49 000\nyou can go back in the army it's kind of\nlike you know what i quit i'm going back\ni was in the army i got out didn't work\nout i'm gonna go back and be a soldier\nyou can go back and work at another gym\nas a gym salesman because that's what i\nwas doing and then i kind of started\nlooking at everything and i said you\nknow what\ni went through every single one of my\nalternatives and this is the decision i\nmade i said i'm either going for\neverything\nor i'm going to lose everything i have\nand i didn't have anything to lose at\nthe time\nbut i'm not willing to settle for a\nregular life because it doesn't excite\nme\nif these other guys can do it you know\nit's always a statistic when you look at\ntoday in america i was doing a talk\nand i was on a tour and i got up and i\nasked a simple question i said let me\nask you guys a question i said uh how\nmany guys would like to one day live in\na million dollar home and oh we'd love\nto have a million i said how many\nmillion dollar homes do you think there\nare in america jay i wish you would have\nheard the answers two thousand\ntwenty two thousand thirty thousand and\nthey're giving me all these numbers i\nsaid you know there's a million that\nmillion million dollar homes in america\nthey said what i said there's a million\nmillion dollar homes in america so i\nsaid i would have never guessed there's\na million million i said let me ask you\nhow many friends do you have that have\nwalked up uh mount everest and they say\nno one that's okay so can we say that\nclimbing mount everest is what we can\nyou can say maybe it's impossible maybe\nyou and i cannot do it okay fine we can\nmake the argument i'm 62 years old\nthere's no way i can walk up mount\neverest fine that's fine\nbut\nmaybe 80 people have climbed my mount\neverest but there's a million million\ndollar homes what's the big deal about\nit so it's not a big deal to think it's\nthat that big of a deal i was uh talking\nto an economist from harvard and i said\nhow many people last year because he was\nsaying the fact that it's so tough in\namerica to become rich i said how many\npeople in america last year do you think\nfiled their taxes that they made over a\nmillion dollars last year how many\npeople filed taxes in 2019 that they\nnetted over a million dollars and it\ngives all these small numbers i said\nover 500 000 people in america last year\nmade that's a lot of people you're not\npart of a small community but it's like\nhey i'm one of five hundred thousand\nnobody says like you're not a big deal\nif you're part of five hundred thousand\nyou know you wanna be one at a billion\none in five hundred thousand that made a\nmillion dollars so when i started\nbreaking down these types of things in\nmy mind\nand i said if these other guys can do it\nwhat is so special about that guy what\nis so special about her what is so and i\nreally started questioning and the more\ncloser i got to people that were very\nsuccessful\ni just realized these guys have a higher\npain tolerance than i do at the time and\ni started asking myself do you really\nwant to go through the pain the moment i\nstarted seeing the human side of other\npeople that were winning\ni said i'm all in i'm going to be able\nto go out there and pull it up because\ni'm willing to put up with the pain that\ni got to go through and it's just a\nmatter of time and then obviously\neventually great things started\nhappening but in that moment jay it's so\nclose to go either direction you can\neither just i settle i'm just gonna go a\nlittle regular life\nor you're willing to go live that life\nit's so unique\nhow close everybody is to it's it's if i\nsit there and i\nmeasure it when people say oh my gosh\npat look at your life i'm like i wish\nyou knew how close i was to go back in\nthe army and do 20 years i would have\nretired three years ago you would have\nnever known who i was it's this close\nand most people don't realize that but\nit's very close i love that answer\nespecially when you're talking about the\nhuman\nflaws that everyone has\nand that you see that because i think\nyou're so right that we often put\nsuccess\nor fame or power on this pedestal\nthat we feel like oh like i that's not\nactually real but you're right like\neveryone has their bad habits their\nweaknesses their flaws and i love that\nyou said that was your motivation\nbecause i think i think that's such a\nrefreshing thing i've never heard that\nbefore and the second thing that i love\nthat you said\nis is you're so right like if you were\nin my shoes at that point you would\nrealize how close i was because right\nnow it's easy to look at patrick david\nyou know the best seller and all the\nviews and all the interviews and be like\noh yeah yeah you already had it together\nand that's what i'm interested by that\nyou were saying that you could have gone\nto the army\ndid you gain a lot of do you think you\ngained a lot of mental discipline for\nthe army or what was the habits that you\ndid gain from the army that you think\nreally have stood the test of time in\nwho you are today there's no question\nabout it you know the in the personality\ntypes you have the s's the t's the a's\nand the r's the s's are the structured\norganized system\nstrategy they're all about like\nstructure the t's are very analytical\nthey're analyzing everything data\nnumbers the a's are let's go get them\nlet's go beat these guys i'm gonna take\nover the world and ours are all about\nharmony relationship empathy\nunderstanding\nin that moment of my life pre-army i was\na and that's it that's all that was it\nfor me i was an a guy\nbodybuilder you know i want to be mr\nolympia partying woman it's the only\nthing that was a priority for me so then\nuh i'm at my sister's place i lost my\none of my cars uh and i'm on my sister's\nplace they stole my car my my sister's\nplace i go to sleep i wake up in the\nmorning\nuh four o'clock in the morning we got\nhammered with my friends at her place in\nencino and i wake up i have nothing\ngoing on for myself i'm working at\nburger king at the time i'm going to\nglendale community college i said listen\nif i go the way i'm going right now\nnothing's gonna happen in my life i call\nmy dad i said dad i need you to come\npick me up take me to the recruiting\nstation i went to the recruiting station\ni said i'm making a decision right now\nbecause if i don't do it right now i\nwon't if i even have to think about\njoining the army i'll change my mind i\nwas 18.\nso i said you have to sign me up right\nnow they said we can't do it right now i\nsaid i'm going right now two weeks later\ni was in south carolina and i joined the\narmy when i went into the army jay the\nbiggest thing i picked up\nfrom the military was\nthe structure and the system like\nliterally the system the structure it\nwas a every day was a routine and you're\ncoming in four o'clock formation then\nyou're running then it's chow then it's\nformation then it's going to the motor\npool then you're working on your trucks\nthen it's ciao again then going back on\na motor pool working on the second\ntrucks and you're coming back then it's\nmore training\nit was so routine and that routine kind\nof i'm not a routine guy for the longest\ntime i was not a routine person and then\nyou had to mentally an emotion and be\nable to take the torture torturing you\nwould take\nwords it was words the drill sergeants\nthe stuff they would say to you jay\nto see how tough you are hey tell me\nabout your girlfriend and you're like oh\nthis guy wants to get to know me what\ndoes your girlfriend look like oh my\ngirlfriend's like this oh she's hot\nain't she tell me about your best friend\noh my best friend man he's the best guy\nin the world oh really yeah you know\nthey're hooking up right now i mean that\nkind of stuff you know they're like what\nthey're together right now that wouldn't\nyou love to call them oh i'm sorry you\ndon't have access to phones for two more\nmonths\nthis is the kind of stuff they're\ntelling like who needs to go through\nthis kind of stuff right but then you\ncan handle that then when you come out\nand in the business world somebody's\ntalking trash or somebody's rejecting\nyou're going back and saying you're not\nas bad as the drone sergeant\ngames they played so there was a lot of\nbenefits to probably one of the best\ndecisions i made in my life\nwow man that yeah that's so interesting\nthat\ni'm still cracking up for that because\nthat's like the worst thing to hear but\nit's interesting right like that\nresistance of being pushed to that\nextreme means then when you're getting\nthe normality i think we feel scared of\nthis sometimes i feel like\nright now we always feel scared about\nwhat our limits are and i always say to\nthe people that i know and my friends\ni'm like you have no idea what your\nlimits are like if you keep stretching\nit and we know this because of\nneuroplasticity and how the brain can be\nrequired and stretched if you keep\nstretching it you just expand your\nabilities but we're scared of doing that\nbecause\nwe feel we might break right we feel me\nwe might break and i guess it's having\nthat openness because you had that\nopenness to be stretched or even if you\nweren't open to it you still allowed\nyourself to get stretched and now that's\nallowing you to deal with a bigger\nspectrum\nof the same challenges and stresses that\nyou see but i i find like the biggest\nstruggle is in convincing yourself that\nyou're not going to break if you stretch\nyourself how do you do that how do you\npush yourself\nand know you're not gonna break because\ni think so today we're so much more\nfragile today\nbecause we\nare fragile because of the trauma we've\nexperienced through our parenting or\nthrough our childhood and so now we we\navoid pain and there the whole time you\nkept saying\npain pain pain right like you have to go\nthrough that pain so tell us about how\ndo you go through pain without stopping\nyourself from breaking feeling like\nyou're gonna breathe you know it's it's\nfunny you say that when it comes down to\nmy kids i have a\ni have a couple rules with my kids i\nhave an eight-year-old a six-year-old\nand a four-year-old right i've been\nmarried 11 years these are the three\nkids and they're very different my\noldest likes vampires have no clue why\nthe middle one looks like a middle\neastern bo jackson you look at his butt\nis like this he's got calves bigger than\nmine he's got muscles i mean you\neverybody likes the middle one he'll\ncome to the office\nand during the pandemic he was here\nevery day for 12 weeks and they were you\nknow making 102 shots a day they were\nsupposed to read 20 books 20 pages a day\nand they would watch a documentary every\nsingle day with me during the pandemic\nat the office and then this was a\nroutine every day they would do this the\nmiddle one would come to the office and\njay he'd go sit in people's offices and\nhe would say\ni don't know if you know her now my\ndad's your boss\ni'm like\nyou can't say that kind of stuff to\npeople dylan and he's kidding with them\nthat's how he is he's so witty and he\nwould say so what do you do he says i do\ncustomer service can i make some of the\ncalls you want to make kell of me can i\ntalk to the customer he takes the phone\nand talks to customers at six years old\nthen the four-year-old is a smack talker\nshe's a whole different story right how\nshe is but there's a few things i talk\nto these guys about i say we lead we\nrespect we improve we love as a family\nthese are four things we do when we pray\nfor four things we pray for courage\nwisdom tolerance understanding that's\nwhat we pray for but we also talk about\nbullying i spend a lot of time talking\nto my kids about bullying a lot of time\ntalking about bullying i tell them\nyou're gonna be bullied but in life\nthere's two things that david's don't do\nwe don't bully and we don't get bullied\nnow having said that\nmany times when you see kids that are\ngrowing up you'll see the younger one\nend up becoming the peak performer and\ndoes a lot of big things in their lives\nthe older ones a little bit more\nresponsible maybe make some conservative\ndecisions the younger one pushes the\nenvelope a little bit you know it's a\nlittle bit more reckless than all the\nother guys why because the older one\nbullied the other guys a little bit\nright they pushed him around they\npunched him why'd you punch him why did\nyou hit him give it to him and and and i\nknow this is going to sound weird\nespecially to your audience\nthere's a bit of it that we do need i do\nthink we need to be pushed around a\nlittle bit i do think we need to be\nchallenged a little bit i do think we\nneed a little bit of resistance i do\nthink we need a little bit of pushback i\ndo think we need it because\nwhen that happens to you you get tested\nand when when you're tested\nyou actually learn a lot about yourself\nyou find that if you have what it takes\nyou find out if you have the goodies\nwhen we were first starting the channel\nvaluetainment here's what i said to the\nguys i said look we're gonna find that\ni'll do 52 episodes but within 52\nepisodes we're going to find out if\nthere's an audience for this or not if\nthere's not i don't want to use the\nresources i'm going to go back to doing\nwhat i'm doing it was 52 or 104 episodes\ntwo years i went and i said two years\nlater we'll make a decision i said okay\nthere is an audience let's see what we\ncan do with this and then we build on it\npodcast same thing let's see because\nsome people can do good long-form\ninterviews but they're not good for\npodcasts some people do good short\nmotivational videos and it goes viral\nbut their content on vlog is not that\ngood people are not entertained you have\nto find your niche what you're good at\njust because you're getting one thing\ndoesn't mean you're going to be good at\neverything on blogs podcasts so you have\nto kind of find that and be honest with\nyourself to me it's all about that test\nyou'll sit there and say i'm not good at\nthat but here's the scariest part about\nthe question that you ask here's the\nscariest part about the question that\nyou asked\njay there is nothing scarier than uh\nnever experiencing the unknown let me\nexplain what i mean by the unknown to me\ni cannot tell you how scary it is for me\nif i never find out the potential\npatrick like to live a life without the\nunknown is just not worth living for me\ni'll sit down with somebody and you know\na lot of people this morning i was doing\na conference call with some of my\nexecutives and i said\nin the last 19 years i've been in this\nfinancial business and we have around 15\n000 agents right now nearly a half a\nmillion square feet of offense space i'm\nthe majority owner we have raised a lot\nof money we've done good stuff for\nourselves right\nand i've mentored a lot of people and\ni've watched a lot of people how they\nare and what drives everybody's driven\nby different things some of them are\nmadness some of them is advancement some\nof them is individual some of them is\nabout you know a purpose they want to do\nsomething but everyone's different\nthe one line that they a lot of people\nthat never wanted to put up the effort\nthey would say a line like this i would\nsay pat\nlet me tell you if i really wanted to\ni'd be the biggest guy in the financial\nindustry you know that line if i really\nwanted to i'd be the biggest guy on\nyoutube if i really wanted to build the\nbiggest podcast if i really wanted to be\nthe biggest instagram if i really wanted\nto if i really wanted to and it's a form\nof a cop-out it's a form of kappa\nbecause let's just say you actually did\nwhat you you think you could do let's\nsay you came you became the biggest\npodcaster let's say you became the best\nin the financial industry let's say you\nbecame the biggest real estate guy let's\nsay you became what you think if you\nreally want it you become the biggest\nwho benefits from it who benefits from\nyou become the biggest if you have kids\nis it fair to say that trump benefited\nfrom the trump last name yes\nis it fair to say that kennedy benefited\nfrom the kennedy last name of course is\nit fair to say that there's a benefit to\nchelsea clinton for her last name being\nclinton is it fair to say that if you're\nborn in the\nduchess family you want to talk you know\nsome of these families the royalty from\nyou benefit from it yes\nso if you do what you're saying if i\nreally wanted to do it i would really be\nthe biggest in xyz who would benefit\nfrom it um your kids your family your\nloved ones why wouldn't you do it if you\nknow what's going to benefit them why\nwouldn't you do it if you know they're\ngoing to have a bigger advantage at 18\nyears old than you do why wouldn't you\ndo it so it's not that if you really\nwanted to you don't think you can do it\nso that's really a cop-out way of doing\nthat we've all done this before but the\nreality is if somebody's watching this\nman i\ni just don't recommend i would much\nrather get in the ring and fight\nsomebody\nand have an answer by the end and the\nanswer is he beats you i'm good i can\nlive with that\nthen not go in the ring and for the rest\nof my life think you could have beaten\nthat person let's get in the ring and\nhash it out let's go out there and see\nif we can build this business let's go\nout there and see if i can do this\npodcast let's go out there and see\nbecause i am not willing to live a life\nknowing that i couldn't take it to a\nwhole different level but i was too\nafraid of the risk i'm not willing to do\nthat that's the unknown you gotta you\ngotta be willing to accept not\nexperiencing the unknown and i'm just\nnot willing to do it i can fully relate\nto that man that is like that is that's\nthe truth it's the simple truth and\nyou're spot on that if you don't explore\nit you just never know where it may go\nand and i think you know we can all feel\nthat and experience that i know i i\ndefinitely identify with that in my life\ni am so grateful\nfor that moment where i decided that i\nwas going to try and do what i do now\nbecause it was i was exactly what you\nsaid when you said like i was this close\nto settling for normality security\nstability and safety i was this close\nand every time i look back and i'm just\nlike wow i'm so grateful and the funny\nthing is people think you only make that\ndecision once you have to make that\ndecision all the time\nbecause there's a new safety net there's\na new stability there's a new security\nand even five years in your mind still\ntrying to get you to settle for that so\nit's not that you make the decision once\nand everything changes you have to\nremind yourself that you made that\ndecision and one thing i mentioned that\nuh one thing i've heard you mention is\nthat you say you visualized your dad's\nfuneral maybe 50 000 times\nand and i wanted to ask you what purpose\ndoes that serve you like what is what\ndoes that do for you when you do that\nvisualization so you you have to realize\nthat for when i go through the category\nof madness lifestyle individual and\npurpose and what people are driven by i\ntalk about people being driven by 20\ndifferent things this is having worked\nwith a lot of different people before\ni know what i'm driven by i'm in the\nmadness quality right i'm the guy that's\ndriven by\na chip driven by you can't do this\ndriven by an opponent opposition doing\nsomething that's never been done before\nthat's my and i didn't know this for a\nlong time by the way for the longest\ntime i thought i had issues until i read\nuh two of these books back here one is\ncalled hypomanic edge and the other one\nis called first rate madness which is\nsuch powerful neither one of the books\ndid very good but they're such a\nhypomanic edge talks about the\nthe the link between craziness and a lot\nof success and it talks about all of\nthese people the the upbringing of bill\nclinton how hypomanic he was and the the\njacksons and all these other leaders\nit's a brilliant book both of those\nbooks i highly recommended once i got to\na point where i said listen you hear all\nthese different people speaking you're\nnot that guy\nyou have nothing in common with her when\nit comes down to style and vision that's\nfine\nthat's not you you don't have his gift\nthis is you you are wired this way based\non the life that you live right okay\nso once i saw that and i brought it back\nand i saw that what i was driven by\nwhat moved me\nfrom there it was about okay what do you\nwant to do with it now at what level do\nyou want to go with this how high do you\nwant to go with this what levels do you\nwant to take it what you know how big do\nyou want to scale this then i use that\nas a way to motivate myself to go to the\nnext level so i think the biggest thing\nwhen you think about\ndifferent people out there and what they\nwant to do is they have to sit down and\nfigure out what drives them too often\nlike you know like you do your videos\nright you've had what 40 billion views i\ndon't know what the number is you are\nall\none of your videos got a quarter of a\nbillion views no like you have one of\nyour videos got a quarter of a billion\nviews i don't know how many people can\nsay they have a video with a quarter\nbillion viewers now here's the thing i\nsee so many people jay that try to be\nyou they can't\nyou're not j shetty this is jay's\npurpose jay is\ndriven with a certain demeanor that\nyou're so you calm people down your your\nstrength is just you're you're you're a\nunifier you're a synergist you're good\nwith bringing people together you're\ncommon you're good for the world we need\nmore people like you right but not\neverybody's like you so you'll see a lot\nof people that'll watch you and say i'm\ntrying to be like jay and then they'll\nwatch tony i'm trying to be like tony\nand then i'm trying to be like gary i'm\ntrying to be like once you figure out\nwhat moves you and you get clear on that\npart the rest is history that's one of\nthe reasons why\ni wrote this book your next five moves\nwhich uh you know when when i was\nwriting this book and i was working on\nthis it's an interesting thing on what\nhappened this is years ago so i started\nputting all this content together for\nthis book years ago one morning i wake\nup\ni wake up in the morning and it's six\no'clock at six o'clock i had a message\nfor my mom okay my mom's message was i\nam so disappointed in my son what\nhappened to my son who loved his mother\nso much that would call me and tell me\nhow much she loves you know the typical\nguild trip type of message that moms are\nsupposed to leave sometimes she left\nthat message right so i get that message\nand at six o'clock i'm like okay that's\nthe first message then i get my text\nfrom my girlfriend at the time who says\ni think you love your business more than\nyou love me we have to really reconsider\nour relationship because if it's gonna\ngo this way i don't see this going\nanywhere that's my second message okay\nthen i just had closed the big deal the\nweek before in email the client sends me\nan email saying i found another policy\nthat's going to give me better returns\nthan yours i signed with new york life\nyesterday i'm canceling the policy with\nyou i was wrong this is the time i\ndidn't have money i'm relying on this\npolicy cancelled\nthen my number one agent leaves me to\nnew york life at that time and i'm\nsitting there saying what and at this\npoint jay it's 607\nfor seven minutes of the day i have an\nissue with my mom i have an issue with\nmy girlfriend i have an issue with my\nclient and i have an issue my number one\nsales guy\ni'm sitting there in bed and here's what\ni'm processing\nwhat do i do next so first thing i\nthought about okay\nso you're going through and you're\nthinking okay do i call my mom first to\nmake her feel good do i send her roses\ndo i call my assistant do i call my girl\ndo i talk to her and say come over to\nthe house let's try to rekindle you mean\na lot to me do i really want to do that\nam i really going to compromise my\ncareer why would i say that to her no\none i'm going to have to choose my\ndreams over her and she doesn't buy into\nme but i love her but what if i draw and\nshe's so beautiful what are my friends\ngoing to say about me when i go to the\nclubs every what if my you're thinking\nall these thoughts what am i do i call\nmy sales guy do i call the client you\nthink about that moment here's what i\nsaid this is what i thought about that\nmoment you can have 10 different people\nexperience the same exact situation and\nthey're going to handle it in a\ndifferent way all i wanted to know was\nwhat is the right next five moves in the\nright sequence to make right\nlebron james and his partner uh buddy\nmaverick carter they just got a\nfunding of a hundred million dollars to\nstart their own black media company\ncalled green hill right big deal\ncongratulations to them right\nso you look at this lebron james guy\npeople think he's just a basketball\nplayer the guy is as methodical as they\ncome right so he's in high school on the\ncover of sports illustrated goes in the\nnba everybody's expecting him to be\ngreat he does more than that\nso he says i'm first going to be a great\nbasketball player because he's studying\neverybody he's studying i'm going to\ntake a play out of jordan's playbook go\nbecome the greatest buy a basketball\nteam i'm going to take a page out of\nkobe i'm going to take a page out of i\nknow this one's going to sound strange\ntrump because of social media and\napprentice and all that stuff he puts it\ntogether he becomes one of the greatest\nin basketball so that was his industry\nnumber two\nhe goes out there and uses his market to\nmake money which he's made god knows how\nmuch money then he starts a media\ncompany while he's playing at a peak of\na time like this with what's going on\naround the world perfect timing\nthen he's going to retire from\nbasketball after playing with his son on\nthe same team brownie which is going to\nhappen he'll be the first to do it then\nhe's going to own a basketball team what\nis lebron's inspirations long term is he\ntrying to run for office one day what's\nhe setting up for what is this he's not\njust a basketball guy is he trying and\nwhen i'm studying that i say brilliance\nright when you think about amazon just\nbought zuke's yesterday a self-driving\ncompany for 1.2 billion what are you\ndoing what did amazon do buying whole\nfoods just four years what are you doing\nbuying whole foods what did amazon do\nbuying this company and you saw then\nelon musk tweeted out saying he's just a\ncopycat what are they doing what are\ntheir strengths then you realize\nit's all about your next five moves so\nin the game of chess a grand master is\nsomebody that knows their next 10 or 15\nmoves right a master knows their 10\nmoves a pro knows five to six moves and\namateur knows their next one to three\nmoves\nif you play chess you know here's what\ni'm gonna be doing some of the guys know\nseven moves they beat you the whole\npurpose of life to me is whether it's\nmarriage\nwhether it's having kids you get people\nthat comments i want to get married why\ndo you want to get married what's the\npurpose of getting married why do you\nwant even i want to have kids why do you\nwant to have kids because everybody's\ndoing it i want to become a millionaire\nwhy do you want to so when you go\nthrough the process and put it down then\nyou put the right 15 steps in place\nthat's the right 15 steps then\neventually you get to go exactly where\nyou want to go to and that's one of the\nreasons why i wrote this book your next\nfive moves because\nmost people\nhave the right intentions most people\nhave the right vision most people are\nthinking big there's not a lot of people\nmost people do think big but they don't\nknow what they need to be doing in the\nnext 5 10 15 steps and once they figure\nthat part out the rest is history\nyeah no i love that man and and i i\nabsolutely love analyzing\nstrategy and mythology methodology and\nall those people you just picked out\nit's it's fascinating to watch but i\nlike the way that you break it down into\nthe next five moves because i think like\nyou're saying for anyone\ntheir their next five moves may not even\nbe building the next big thing their\nnext five moves is just getting off\ntheir couch someone someone and that's\nwhy i love love the theory in the book\nbecause it's so practical because it's\nlike hey whether you are sitting on your\ncouch or whether you already have a\nmillion dollar business or whether you\nuh just got rejected from a girl that\ndoesn't like you anymore whatever it is\nit's like we all need to know what our\nnext five moves are right it applies to\neveryone and and i love that you start\nwith the principle of master knowing\nyourself as move number one and and my\nquestion to you is let's let's dive into\nsome of these because i think it's fun\nto break them down so people can get an\nidea of what's in the book but tell me\nwhat is the sign\nwhen someone can say i feel i know\nmyself versus i don't know myself how\ndoes someone come to that decision of\nbeing able to say yeah i think i know\nmyself right now enough to make this\nfirst move it's it's actually learning\nwhat you don't what you can't do and\nwhat's not you you know for me it's\nwhat's not you're like when you want to\nget married like uh i was dating three\ngirls uh in uh nine years and each of\nthem was like a two-three-year relation\nthese are serious relationships\nno not at the same time that was 21\nyears old but not not at 28 29. so i'm\ndating these girls\nand at the end of it one day jay i'm so\nfurious because i'm like oh my gosh look\nat all these girls they're all the same\nsame upbringing same issues it's the\nsame challenge with everybody i'm dating\nand then i sat there and i'm like\nwell is it the girl or is it the way\nyou're presenting yourself what is it\nwhat what is it what are you looking\nforward to being do you want to be a\nhusband or do you want to be a daddy\nwhat do you want to be what are you\nreally solving for so i made a list and\nuh one of my assistants her name was\npatty changed my life she said\ni said listen patty i've made a decision\ni was 20. i said i'm never getting\nmarried i enjoy my own company i like\ngoing to movies by myself i have a lot\nof friends i'm good i'm happy i don't\nneed to get married i'm fine she says\nlisten before you decide to not get\nmarried go read this book so what's the\nbook she said i heard it on the radio\ntoday i've never read it but i thought\nabout you\ni said what's the book's name she says\n101 questions to ask before you get\nengaged i said 101 questions to ask\nbefore you get engaged\nso i go buy the book it's by a man named\nnorman wright it comes in i start going\nthrough every single question together\nby myself i'm like okay it's pretty\ninteresting i thought i was looking for\nthis but i have no interest in this i'm\nlooking for this but for the longest\ntime this was a priority and one of the\nthings is non-negotiables of what you\ndon't want once i figured out what i\ndidn't want it was a lot easier to go\ndate\nand and you know what to say no to and\nwhat to say yes to it became so much\nfrom the moment i got clear\non who i wanted to marry and what things\ni needed to improve in\ni read the book a year later i found my\nwife and then we got married i mean it's\nso funny how this thing worked out when\ni got clear so now who do you want to be\nright when you talk about who do you\nwant to uh you know master knowing\nyourself\nthere's a lot of different routes in\nlife one of the best things that a\nfriend of mine told me a mentor my name\nis tom he was a former president at php\nfor three years tom used to be with jam\ndad they sold their company to ea sports\nfor 680 million dollars and 04. and he\nwas the number six guy the number six\nguy jay okay but he still got a fat\ncheck right and one day he sat me down\ntold me the most powerful thing he says\npat\nhere's what i've learned he was 48 49\nwhen he told me this\nhe said i founded four companies\nas a founder and the ceo i made nothing\noff any one of these companies\nany time i was number two or number six\ni made millions anytime i was number one\ni didn't do well he says it took me 49\nyears to realize i'm not a number one do\nyou realize how powerful of a statement\nthat is to make because everybody is\ntrying to be what a number one\njordan was a great number two\nyou know jordan was a great number one\npippin was a great number two lebron's\nthe number one you know you had to look\nat everybody and then sometimes\nyou may be a number one at a phase of\nyour life but at 58 maybe you are better\nbeing number two or maybe at 28 you're\nbetter at being number two maybe at 39\nyou're a good number one so you kind of\nhave to go through these phases that is\npart of understanding and knowing\nyourself so once you know and say you\nknow what\ni don't care to build a billion dollar\ncompany because it's not me i'm just not\na founder i'm somebody that wants to go\nthis route i'm somebody that wants to go\nthis route great entrepreneur\nentrepreneur salesperson solopreneur but\nthe biggest thing is to go through the\nquestion i have a set of questions that\ni went through years ago and i put 28 of\nthem in the book here to find out\nexactly who you are to find out like\nquestions such as okay jay who do you\nget along with and you write down these\nare the people i get along with then you\nwrite them who do you not get along with\nyou know what kind of a question is that\nwell why don't you get along with those\ntypes of people then you say\nyou know i don't get along with those\nthree guys because they're just like me\nwell maybe you got to kind of like\nyourself you got some things you got to\nlike about yourself so when you go\nthrough that part then comes the second\nstep so number one is master knowing\nyourself yeah i love that man that's a\ngreat answer right i think\nthat example of when you're a one or a\ntwo or six that's that's kind of\ncurrently one of the biggest challenges\nwe have in the world because as we know\nsocial media\nentrepreneurship the conversation that's\nhappening in business the\navailability of seeing the big business\ndeals that are happening unfortunately\nyou know we see this all the time in\nsociety and i think it's it's been out\nthere like whatever's rewarded we end up\nrepeating\nand so we we go where the reward is\nrather than thinking about what's going\nto be a reward for me right what's going\nto help me get there and so i think\nthat's that's a brilliant answer i'm\nreally glad you made that distinction\ni'm glad that there's questions in here\nas well because i think people need to\nstart asking the right questions in\norder to get there and that's really the\nstep of self-awareness tell me about\nthis one move number three i'm skipping\nbecause number two we kind of talked to\nthe beginning by the way for everyone\nwho doesn't know move number two in the\nbook is mastering the ability to reason\nwe were speaking about that earlier but\nmastering building the right team i'm\nasking you this as a personal question\nactually\nbecause as i've been growing my team and\nmy company and my world\ni'm realizing that the biggest skill\nthat i personally need to work on is how\nto hire\nlike how to recruit and i'm realizing\nthat this is something that i need to\ninvest in at this time in my life if\nsomeone says to me right now what's the\nnumber one skill you need to improve\nthat's number one skill i need to\nimprove like i'm aware it from a\nprofessional level\nso\ntell me about building the right team\nsomething that people\ni feel like it's so hard to figure out\nwhether someone's right for you or not\nright for you there's so many different\napproaches i want to hear your approach\nfor\nfor making sure that someone is actually\nright for the long term so a specific\nquestion here not just someone who's\nright for you someone who's right to\nbecome a long term number two number\nthree number four number five number six\net cetera et cetera et cetera in the\ncompany so very good question very very\nvery very good question and i'll kind of\ngive it to you in the way i processed it\nprocessed it myself so\nuh first things first is it's not just\nwho's right for you it's who you need\nnext today right so for example who i\nneeded in\n2005\nwas different than who i needed in 2008\nwas different than who i needed in 2010\nso for example i came up i first needed\nan assistant to help me out with\npaperwork so you get an assistant right\nthen i needed three assistant because\nsomebody were on my calendar somebody\nsent my cards and gifts to the client\nsomebody followed up so it was three\nassistants so then i got a person that\ndid all my paperwork and compliance so\nthat person is a technical person so\nthey protected my business and i got\nthis person so then as we're growing and\nwe started php and i'm a sales guy\ntraditionally i've never been a ceo\nbefore i've never worked under ceo\nbefore i've just been a sales guy i've\nbeen a good sales leader and i've made\nmoney selling so when you go from an\nemployee to sales person to sales leader\nto starting a company as a founder this\nis a whole different language you don't\nknow what you need to be doing here\nbecause you've not got i'm not i don't\nhave an mba i don't have a a business\ndegree so when i became a ceo jay it was\nit was three four years of anxiety panic\nand\nworry about making the right the wrong\ndecision and it was constant i didn't\nknow what to do as a ceo and so as i was\ngoing through this and i kind of started\nlooking at everything that i was doing i\nsaid okay i need to figure out what i\nhave to do on a daily basis myself what\ni need to do on a daily basis as a ceo i\nwent to a course i took and i spent the\nuh four weeks together with 144 other\nceos from 64 different countries and the\nguy i teamed up with for four weeks\nwas the founder of the victoria secret\nof australia in south africa okay he's\nworth 900 million dollars at the time\nhe's worth about a billion and a half\nright now and four weeks is my partner\nso here i am trying to be a ceo he's in\nhis mid 50s look what he says to me jay\nand i said you know bob i'm trying to be\na ceo what are the keys to being a ceo\nsays well\nhe says i'm trying to get seven ceos of\nmine that are running seven different\ncompanies to be ceo so his challenge was\ngetting his seven ceos to be ceos my\nchallenge is i'm trying to be a seal\nlook how many levels behind him i am\nbecause he went from being a founder to\na ceo to giving up his position then\nthey bought a bunch of different\ncompanies he's got seven seals reporting\nto him and we started processing through\nall these different things and he said\nlook there's a couple things you got to\nbe thinking about there's a linear\nthere's exponential there's a lot of\nthings that people do when they start a\nbusiness\nthat doesn't explode the business it's\nlinear meaning uh i need systems so you\nfix your systems and your protocols and\nstandard operating procedure it's like\nhere first step we do the second step we\ndo this third step is this okay fine\nand then it's busy that you go shake\nhands collaborate networking all this\nstuff it's fine it's good but it's not\nat the highest level that's linear helps\nyou grow but it's linear it's not\nexponential then he said at the highest\nlevel is exponential is one the next\ninnovative campaign a next innovative\ncampaign is\nj shetty coming out with a new show okay\nwhat is that new show it could be a new\nseries of videos it could be a new\npodcast it could be a new collaboration\nit could be a j\ndebate topic with compassion and you\nbring two people in la and they come to\nyour studio and they debate boom that's\na great idea all of a sudden you got 17\nmillion new followers they love jay's\nnew show right that's a next innovative\ncampaign that jay came up with and the\nlast one is leadership development\nleadership development is is two ways of\nlooking at it one is how good you are at\nbuilding leaders which that is the\npinnacle because if you can take a six\nand tournament eight you're always going\nto be needed\nthere's a lot of people that don't know\nhow to turn a six into an eight where\nthey have to go just find an eight and\nthey're never gonna improve the eight\nthey just go find an eight right and the\neight stays in eight won't improve\nbecause of you so one is improving\nleaders and developing leaders the other\none is being able to find the right\nleaders i wanna work with you so when\nyou want to find the right leaders to\nwork with you\nmy phrase jay is very simple everybody i\nhave here that are working for us behind\nthis window\ni ask him a question and i say so what\ndo you think about what we do\nand all i'm trying to get to is are they\ntrue believers in me the smaller i am\nthe more important it is for you to be a\ntrue believer in me and once it's a\ncompany are you a true believer of what\nwe're doing as a company like right now\nwe are looking for a new cool and a ceo\ni'm looking at i'm interviewing a ceo\nfrom a fortune 50 company to replace me\nthis is a man that ran a company that i\nsent\ntens of thousands of insurance policies\nto he's not going to replace my position\nand one of the biggest challenge we had\ntogether was look you're coming from a\nfortune 50 company we're not a fortune\n500 company we're not a fortune 1000\ncompany how are you going to be from the\nsnobby people in your world to being\nable to level down and work with these\ntypes of people you're going to make the\nsame money that's not going to change\nbut maybe you're not fit for this so we\nwere going that was the biggest hiccup\nfor us by the way yeah so i had to see\nif he would be a fit for us and\neventually when i saw people that were\ntrue believers in me so if i hire\nsomebody who says jay man i'm such a\nbeliever in you you're awesome you're\namazing i'll do anything for you but\ncapacity is low and talent is low what's\nthe purpose what am i going to hire you\nfor but if you get somebody that says\njay\nobviously i love the work you're doing\ni'm a true believer in the difference\nyou're making i like the values and\nprinciples you have in place but if i\ncan be open with you i can talk about a\ncouple things what i can help you in the\noperations i think what i can do is the\nfollowing i don't need the limelight i\ndon't need to be on the camera i don't\neven want to be doing any of that but\nbehind closed doors i think you're\nmissing out on an opportunity to make\nsix million dollars you're here i think\nyou're missing out on an opportunity to\nturn this thing to business over here if\nwe come out with this this app and sell\nit this way and team up with this guys\nover here if we go to cnn or get a\ncontract with pepsi or coca-cola i can\nhelp you do that but i'm 100 with you so\nit's it's identifying the true believers\nin you around you and identifying who\nyou need exactly next and typically\nbig personalities like\nyourself and myself these are\npersonalities operation becomes a\nchallenge the challenge becomes finding\nthe right co i cannot tell you how much\na coo can change your life\na ceo can change the right co believes\nin jay shetty can take your business\nfrom what you're doing today to being\nastronomical and they're behind closed\ndoors so again that's some of the ways i\nlook at on who i need to hire next\ni love that man what a great answer\neveryone you can hear this patrick that\ndavid your next five moves incredible\nstorytelling i could sit and listen to\nyou talk for ages like look at just just\nthink about it for a moment everyone's\nlistening or watching obviously\npatrick's a great business person he's a\ngreat storyteller he knows the stats\nhe's analyzing but he's reflective it's\nnot just he's not just repeating stuff\nthis is his reflection it's his you can\nhear the process in his mind that's what\nyou're going to get inside this book so\nyour next five moves must be our\nbusiness strategy if you're struggling\nif you're like what do i do next here it\nis your next five moves right next one\nso going around copy this book patrick i\nwant to end with two segments on the\npodcast\nyou're gonna be great at this they're\nthe rapid fire segment so we have the\nfill in the blanks and the fast five\nwe're gonna start with filling the\nblanks first so you just gotta fill in\nthe blanks at the end of the sentence\nsure okay\nthe challenge with big massive success\nis\nstaying humble\nnice i love that answer okay the game of\nentrepreneurship is never about\nyou\nbeing the best version of yourself means\nconstantly beating your prior best\nshocking your business involves\nrecreating yourself\nnice the biggest mistake people make in\nbusiness is\nthinking it's all about them\nnice i love all of your answers but\ntotally about humility and uh getting\nout the ego so that's great\nokay these are your fast fives these are\nquestions\nthat the answer has to be one word or\none sentence maximum\nokay\nwell i've got so many for you all right\num\ni've got so many questions i'm gonna ask\nyou oh this is this is what i want to\nask you because i want everyone to go\nand watch this video\ni believe every creator has a video that\nthey make where they think that they've\nput their best message in their best\ninsight but for whatever reason people\nare not watching that video what is that\nvideo for you oh my gosh we did a video\nwe did a video\nuh about uh uh you know how nobody uh\nnobody pays attention to certain people\nand they've been rejected it's not even\nthe life of an entrepreneur it's another\none that we did and i thought this one\nwas for sure gonna blow up and he got 40\n000 views in a week we're like are you\nkidding me with this video so you know\nhow it is\ntell us i want everyone to go watch it\nyeah you know what let me let me i can\nit's uh it's two of them one of them is\nsleep sweat grind repeat i thought for a\nfact sleep sweat grind repeat if you\njust type in sleep sweat grind repeat\nit's 101 000 views but in one year you\nknow 101 000 views on a platform with\n2.4 million subs is not viral or\nanything of success but you know what\nit's my favorite video that's good\nthat's what i wanted to do yeah it's my\nfavorite video that didn't do anything\ni love that man please everyone who's\nlistening or watching this podcast\nplease don't watch that video because\nthat's the one that pedro patrick put\nhis heart into and and i can relate to\nthat i've got i've got tons of those\nvideos as well so awesome okay now we'll\nget into the past five because i wanted\nto ask that question okay uh if you had\nto start all over again from ground zero\nwhat would be your first five moves\na great question number one identify one\nindustry that can bring out your talents\nnumber one identify your uh industry\nthat can bring out your talents i'm a\nnumbers guy so what is it that you see\nthat you can go and bring your talent\nnumber two\nfind out who's the best in that industry\nand identify working for the best guy so\nsometimes you it's like let's just say\nif i'm a real estate guy i want to go\ninto real estate i'm in la who's the\nbest realtor in la i want to go work for\nthat guy but if i can't go for that guy\ni put a top five list and i go work for\nthem that's number two number three\nis i work for that person and i do\nanything i can to help this person\nadvance so if their goal is to get to 10\nmillion a year i'm going to do my part\nif you want to get to 100 i'm going to\ndo my if you want to get to a billion i\nwant to do my part the fourth thing is\nto replace you\nor ask you for equity in the company so\nif i've paid the price and i'm working\nfor jay shetty and jason pat i want to\nbe able to take the business to 50\nmillion a year i help you get to 50\nmillion i want to say jay i've gotten\nyou 50 million can i be your ceo and\nyou'll be the chairman of the board and\ni want to get four percent the company i\nwant to get two percent the company and\nif jay says no or whoever that person is\nsays no then go start your own company\nbut the last thing is to become an\nentrepreneur there are other ways to\nmake your millions and billions before\nbecoming an entrepreneur that's the last\nstep\ngreat advice man all right awesome what\nuh this is one of my favorite questions\nto us what's something that you know to\nbe true about business but a lot of\npeople would disagree with you on it's\nit's an ugly world very ugly\nuh very ugly i know it's not what people\nwant to hear it's not the whole let's\nhold hands kumbaya behind clothes people\nin front of will tell you oh we can't\nwait for you to blow up i support your\nbusiness all this stuff but you know if\nit has to come between them getting the\nclient and you getting the client you\nbetter believe they're going to do\nwhatever they can to get the client so\nyou cannot be\ni was a kid that grew up naive i didn't\nplay in the streets for 10 years in iran\nbecause my dad didn't trust me i went to\ngermany at a refugee camp j\ni experienced betrayal at 11 years old\nand i said wow i had no idea what the\nword betrayal meant until i just\nexperienced it but that kind of gave me\nideas saying okay in the business world\nhow different is it same how different\nis it in military okay got a little bit\nhow different is it so you have to\nunderstand that you cannot be naive in\nbusiness if you stay small\nit's fine because you're no threat to\nanybody but if you choose to want to\ncompete in ruffle feathers you better\nbelieve you're going to piss some people\noff\nabsolutely man well said well said all\nright if you could create a law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\neveryone in the world had to follow\nyeah uh if i had to create a law that\neverybody in the world had to follow say\nif i'm a president of the united states\nunited states at least the united\nstates what would i do every single\nmonth here's what i would do every\nsingle month every single month i would\nhave\na set of books that every everybody\nwould need to read and submit their\npaper\nand i'd put a scholarship behind it and\ni would go specifically on educating\npeople on the concepts of money and\nmindset because\nfor whatever reason we're not doing that\nand it's not a tough thing to do i i\ncan't think of the last time a president\nrecommended a book to read from stage\nyou know i just think education and not\neducation from a school standpoint\neducation from the standpoint of you\nreading the set of books there'd be a\nmonthly book club if i was a president\nthat'd be for sure\ni loved that the president's books\ncan you imagine that imagine that\nit would be a i mean i i it makes\nperfect sense it's a great it's a great\nidea imagine what kind of community that\nwould do it'd be really cool i love that\nman that's we've never had that answer\nbut not even close that is by far the\nmost unique answer we've ever had there\nall right two last questions for you\nwhat's the best thing that money can buy\nuh i'll give you a story so i'm uh my\nwife and i are going to dubai we're\ntaking 100 of our guys\nand when we go to the airport to go to\ndubai the flight attendant says from air\nfrance you can't go i said why not said\ni'm a u.s citizen now she says no you\ncan't go because your uh passport\nexpires in five months and france wants\nit to be more than six months so you\ngotta be kidding me it doesn't expire\nwell this is what it is so my wife goes\nand i say babe you go i want to go to\nthe federal building i'll fix it i'll be\nthere in two days so she goes she's with\ngood friends i trust her i go back and i\ncome to the house and my nanny's with\nour two kids at the time\nand we were getting ready to move to\ntexas\nand i said hey melva so we're gonna go\nto texas what's your biggest daddy i\ncan't go i said i heard you told mommy\nyou okay you told me you can't go two\nyears ago just change your mind daddy i\ncan't go mama why can't she go by the\nway she's the most amazing nanny she's\nnot even we feel uncomfortable calling\nher nanny she's like a grandma to our\nkids she's been in our lives for 11\nyears\nshe says daddy i can't go because i got\nsix grandkids in la i said melville\nquestion for you she said what i said\nwhat if i fly you back to la every month\nfor five days\nand you come to dallas you live with us\ni get you a nice master bedroom you get\nyour own shower in the corner privacy\ncar everything\nand i fly you back to la five days a\nweek five days a month would you be\nwilling to go to dallas she says you\nwould fly me i said yes she says i'm\ngoing to dallas i said perfect so when i\ngot on the flight i went to dubai i said\nbabe i got some news for you because she\nwas down she was worried i said melva\nhas agreed to go to dallas so when you\nsay money you know you get to do certain\nthings like that it's not the cars that\ntravel it's to be able to\nmake certain decisions that help some\npeople out and also helps your family\nout as well so i would say that's what\nit would be that's a beautiful answer\nman thank you for not giving a this is\nthis is what i really appreciate about\nyou and i appreciate you even more today\nit's like just no shallow answers you\nknow no quick answers no just really\nthoughtful really really special man i i\nappreciate you thank you\nfifth and final question what was your\nbiggest lesson in the last 12 months\ngood one so last 12 months when the\npandemic came up we were getting ready\nto go through uh uh we had our company\nvaluation everything was going on uh and\ni'm getting ready to hire ceo and i'm in\nla at beverly hills hilton we're having\nour board meeting with de la hoya\neverybody's getting ready to fly in and\nit's the day nba cancelled because uh\ngobert and some of those guys got\ncoronavirus and nhl cancelled and then\ndisney closed everybody closed and i'm\nwith my wife and my three kids and my\nnanny\nand my board calls me and they said\nwe're not coming to l.a i think it's\nlike february 12th or some number like\nthat so i said they're not coming in\nlate march 13th march 13 or march 12th i\nsaid what do you mean you're not coming\nearly well because of quran i said you\nmean to tell me one person has died and\nyou don't yes i said oh my gosh\nso i sat there and i talked to my board\nfor an hour and they said pat this is\nserious this is going to affect the\neconomy and we were scheduled to stay in\nl.a for five days i said babe we got to\ngo back we stayed in l.a for 23 hours we\nflew back to la j i have no idea what's\ngoing to happen here's why\n100 of all the insurance policies and\nannuities we sell is face to face\nit's at your house at the kitchen table\nand and now i can't do my sales meetings\ni can't do sales training i can't come\nto your house you're worried about\nsitting down with me\nyou don't even want to shake my hand i\nhave i mean this is a very awkward\nsituation and we're we're about to go\nthrough a transaction\nand i'm sitting there saying oh my gosh\nwhat the heck is gonna happen here\nand uh i said listen all i know is i\ngotta go and do my research so i came\nback i dropped off to kiss it at the\nhouse i made sure my dad was good\nbecause he's 79 i'm 78 at the time my\nmom was good 75 everybody's good i came\nto the office one night i was here for\n16 hours straight on a weekend and i\nstudied every single thing about how the\nmarket has reacted to a pandemic\nthree months later six months later 12\nmonths later\nso i come and i'm like okay we're going\nto lose a lot of money i call my uh\ninvestors i said what are you guys\nexpecting for us to lose the next 60\ndays he says well the investors are\nassuming you're going to lose 40 percent\n40 okay so in my mind i know when i'm\ndoing my next board call they're going\nto be okay with the numbers being 40\nless because they just said it it's\nnormal it's going to happen because it's\nface-to-face sale once i did the\nresearch on the pandemic and i know i'm\ngiving you the longer answer here but\nthere's a reason why this is going this\nplace i look at the data and i see out\nof the last 10 pandemics we've had the\nlast 50 years\nonly one of them the market was down 12\nmonths later and it was aids\neverything else\nevery pandemic six months later 12\nmonths later they all 100 recovered\nmeaning if the dow was at 10 it went\ndown to 7 it came back to 10 right\nso i saw this and i said there's a 90\nchance based on the data that the\nmarket's going to recover within 12\nmonths i didn't sell a single stock\nevery time the market went down i just\nbought more every time the market i\nbought more 18 000 i bought more right\nimmediately i called everybody all my\ncarriers everybody said guys we got to\nfigure out a way for us to be able to\nsell through zoom because if i can sell\nthrough zoom we have a problem here\nyou're going to take a hit then we have\nto get insurance carriers to not take\npayments from clients meaning if i can't\nmake a payment for four months you got\nto forgive them 100 they forgave them\nand 100 of them converted everything to\nsell where i can talk to you right now i\ncan get you on a share and have you sell\nthe policy and sign it it was all scored\naway once we did that jay we went from\nselling 4 000 policies in the month of\njanuary and february\nlast month in the month of may we sold\n10\n968 policies it was our biggest revenue\nmonth ever biggest profit month ever\nbiggest ebitda month ever biggest\ncommission month ever and this month we\nhad the most people ever make a hundred\nthousand dollars in a month in the month\nof june we've never had this before so i\ntell you\ni went four months straight during the\npandemic there's only three days that i\ndidn't come to the office three sundays\nthat i didn't come to the office every\nother day i was at the office and i had\nno idea what was going to happen we were\nready to be prepared that a lot of us\nwas going to shift but the best thing\nthat came out of it today\n90 of all the policies we sell is\nthrough zoom\n90\nso this crisis changed the entire\nbusiness model and it's fascinating what\nwe're doing today with with the\ninsurance company so ex but i tell you i\nsound excited today i guarantee you if\nyou would have talked to me four months\nago was an act i had to figure out a way\nto stay poised i get it man\ncongratulations by the way that's it\nthat's a great story of a greatness\nthat's come out at this time so that's\nan incredible experiment thank you for\nsharing it yeah huge congrats i mean\nthat's not easy to do at all and right\nnow so many people are panicking\nespecially like you're saying your\nbusiness is 100 face-to-face my mom's a\nfinancial advisor so i know what the\nwork's like uh she just works for\nherself she's a solopreneur but\nyou know it's yeah it's it's a tough\nindustry to be in especially this time\nso congrats man that's amazing thank you\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love you should\nalways take action\na little bit before you were ready\nseveral months before you're ready go\nahead and do it\ntry it because you're gonna rise to the\noccasion"
