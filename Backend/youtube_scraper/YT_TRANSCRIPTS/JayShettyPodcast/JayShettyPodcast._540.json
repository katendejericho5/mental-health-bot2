    "transcript": "when you give yourself permission to\npursue your dreams that is the moment\nthat your life\nbegins it's when you stop being a\nspectator and you start being the man in\nthe arena\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou that come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow now you know that i love\nto sit down with\nfascinating people with incredible\nstories and especially people\nwho share that through the written word\ni'm a huge fan of books you know i'm\nalways sharing my favorite books with\nyou and when i saw this book come out\ni'd met this individual and the author\nprobably\na few months before the book uh was\nannounced\nand we connected at a really special\nround table which we'll share in our\ninterview\nand i was really taken aback by his\njourney and as i researched more about\nhis story i was blown away by the\ndecisions he's made the choices he's\nmade and i'm speaking about the one and\nonly simu liu who made history as the\nstar of the first asian fronted movie in\nthe marvel cinematic universe and of\ncourse if you haven't seen it i highly\nhighly recommend it and which garnered\nhim the people's choice award for\nfavorite action movie star cemu also\nstarred in the award-winning cbc and\nnetflix comedy series kim's convenience\nwhich won the ac tra awards for\noutstanding ensemble in 2017 and best\ncomedy series at the 2018 canadian\nscreen awards it was the first canadian\ntelevision series with an all asian lead\ncast the series chronicles the\nday-to-day micro dramas encountered by\nkorean immigrant family that runs a\ncorner grocery store now simu\nlist of accolades now is unbelievable\nbeyond all of this he's a super cool guy\nsuper down to earth\nuh a wonderful human being and he does\ninsane backflips i've seen them in real\nlife not just in movies welcome to the\nshow uh see me leo simon thanks for\nbeing here man\njay it's it's such a pleasure thank you\nthank you so much for having me and for\nthat uh pretty amazing introduction well\nyou have to live it you had to live it\nso i'm pretty sure you've lived an\namazing life if the introduction is like\nand that's just scratching the surface\nbut\nuh i really mean it man when we met we\nmet when hussein put together husson's\nbeen on the show too hassan minhaj put\ntogether a youtube round table i believe\nit was\nto talk about\nuh the aapi community we had this\namazing dinner together that was the\nfirst time we'd met you did a backflip\nfor us in the waiting area out to us i\nwanted to say that i really enjoyed\nconnecting with you and then like you\nwere saying we were just together a week\nago after the oscars\nuh tell me\nabout why that round table was important\nto you at the time i'm just intrigued\nlike because obviously there was there\nwas such a diverse group of us do you\nremember what it was for you that that\nreally inspired you to be there i mean\nyeah the the context of that roundtable\nand what was going on at the time and by\nthe way still continues to happen to\nthis day is um is is just this this rise\nin in anti-asian anti-aapi\num sentiment and hate that's been going\naround i want to say america but it's\nreally kind of just pervasive it's been\nkind of everywhere\nin the western world um in over the last\ncouple of years you know in the wake of\ncovet there's just this there's been the\nsense that you know we are being blamed\nfor something that is that that we have\nabsolutely no part in and it's partially\nbecause of you know the the\ncolor of our skin and just just who we\nare and there are there are\ndeeply rooted um you know\naspects that that i made sure i wanted\nto attack in that round table you know\nthis idea of a model minority myth this\nidea of a perpetual foreigner that you\nknow no matter how many generations a\nfamily could have immigrated from a\ncountry that just because we have this\nface there's a perception that we're\nalways outsiders and so you know that's\nwhen when people ask me where are you\nfrom know where you really from and and\na lot of asian americans will know or\nwill have been asked that question and\nit's like no i grew up i grew up here\nyou know what are you talking about i'm\ni'm a canadian citizen or an american\ncitizen i pay american taxes\nand um and i deserve to be treated as a\ncitizen of the country not scapegoated\nas an other you know and so i think that\nwas the spirit of\nof you know what we were talking about\nand um you know again yeah it was such\nan incredible pleasure talking to you\njay\num and that backflip i have to say i\nit's just for anybody who's wondering\nlike why the f does this guy just go and\ndo backflips it was because caitlyn\nohashi was one of the people on our\nround table and so i was talking to her\ni was like oh you know i dabbled and\ntumbling back in the day and she was\nlike oh yeah i was like yeah i could i\ncould do a backflip and she was like\nokay show me\nyeah i wanna i want to support you there\nsimone say sema just doesn't just go\naround doing backflips it was a very\nspecific situation but i was more\nimpressed because you were doing it in\nlike dress pants and like dress shoes it\nwas not like you weren't like ready for\nit it's not like you were prepared for\nit so yeah that's a risky maneuver\nlooking back i must have i had a lot of\nfaith in that in the stretchiness of\nthose kids\nyou did and it was before the event but\ntoday we're talking about your book we\nwere dreamers which is\nbeautiful title uh an immigrant\nsuperhero origin story\nand i just want to say to everyone who's\nlistening or watching right now i highly\nrecommend that you go and grab a copy of\nthis book uh when this episode is out\nthe book will be available so i highly\nrecommend you go to amazon barnes noble\nwherever it is there it is simu has one\nof the early copies i i have the pdf on\nmy phone so you see my digital my\ndigital version uh that i had for\npreparing for this interview i was very\nlucky to have a have an early pdf copy\nuh but highly recommend it we were\ndreamers uh that i highly recommend you\ngo and get uh sima i want to start\ntalking to you about you know my wife\nand i saw shang chi with a mutual friend\nof ours dorothy uh who i believe you\nknow as well\nand so\ni guess yeah so we three went to see the\nmovie together we loved it you know huge\nfans of the movie it was it was\nphenomenal\nbut what i know is that you sent a\ntweet years ago right back in 2018 where\nyou kind of said that you wanted to play\nthe role now\nyou've talked about the tweet before i\nguess what i'm fascinated about more is\nhow did you have the confidence\nback in 2018 or the lack of fear\nto put yourself out there\nwhen that's a really vulnerable space to\nbe like i think today when i'm thinking\nabout the people that listen to us\nthey'd be thinking oh i'd never send\nthat out because what if i didn't get it\nor i would never go to that audition\nbecause i'm too scared or i'm feeling a\nlot of anxiety around starting my own\nbusiness because i'm struggling with\nthis this and this so we as a society\nstruggle to put ourselves out there\nwhat gave you the confidence back then\nor the\nthe lack of confidence whatever what was\ngoing through your head when you sent a\ntweet like that\nthe delusion\nno no that's a that's an incredible\nquestion jay um it\nwhere i was mentally in 2018 and just in\ngeneral in my life just being an actor\nin the industry that was working\nthat was the culmination of a lot of\nyears of work on myself personally and\nyou know\nif you've read the book you'll know i\nhad you know i i spent a lot of my life\nthat being that guy that was\npetrified of judgment and of the\nopinions of others and of putting\nhis true self out there\nand where that got me was in a you know\ni was i was working as an accountant\nhated my job and then you know\neventually found myself unemployed\nbecause i was i was laid off\nand um the moment that i started to give\nmyself permission and of course the\ncatalyst i hope that the catalyst for\neveryone is not this rock bottom moment\nwhere you lose your job but um if for me\nthat's what it was it was this idea of\nlike i have nothing else to lose so i\nmight as well do something that makes me\nhappy and what you know what\nincidentally that ended up being was um\nlogging onto craigslist and um you know\nsearching for\nacting jobs even even though i had no\nidea how the industry worked i didn't\nknow anybody but you know i remember\nthat feeling of being on set for the\nfirst time as a movie extra and being so\nenamored and blown away by the energy by\nthe people and just wanting to do\nanything that i could to get back right\nand um\nyou know in the years that i'm since i\nmade that decision i i just feel like\nyou know that lesson has been has been\nlearned in spades of this idea of like\nit all starts with permission now\nremember i said this when i was on stage\naccepting my people's choice award is\nthat when you give yourself permission\nto pursue your dreams that is the moment\nthat you can actually that your life\nbegins\nright it's it's when you stop being a\nspectator and you start being the man in\nthe arena you know and and for me you\nknow this tweet um and jay by the way\nthis tweet is only one of the many\nthings that i did over the course of my\ncareer\nmanifesting this kind of superhero role\nfor myself i wanted to play a superhero\never since since day one you know and\nand um i had like written short films\nfor myself where i played a superhero i\nyou know i tweeted marvel back in 2014.\nhey marvel how about an asian superhero\nand then yeah in 2018 when they\nannounced the movie i thought well why\nnot you know what's the worst the worst\nthing that could happen is that\nthey cast someone else but no one's you\nknow no one no one\nno one's gonna be talking about me\nanyway and so kind of tongue-in-cheek i\nmade that tweet i was like hey marvel we\ngonna talk or what and of course then i\nsuspected this and i had it verified\nmultiple times kevin feige\nnever read the tweet anyone nobody at\nmarvel or anybody along the decision\nmaking process ever read the tweet but i\nkind of love that right because the\nmanifestation is not for anybody but\nyourself\nit's for you to set a sight in the\nhorizon be it wherever you know you pick\na direction and you say i don't know if\ni'm ever going to get there but that's\nthe direction i'm headed and i'm just\ngonna i'm just gonna go\nand and that's that was the mentality\nthat that i had been\nliving with you know ever since i made\nthe decision to pursue acting\nthat i love i i love that point you just\nmade i think that is such a brilliant\ndistinction between how we\nenvision how manifesting works\nand how it actually works like that\ndistinction that simulator said the idea\nthat the tweet was for him\nto believe it to put it out there to\nfeel it to\nbecome really\nconfident that that's what i want to do\nthat was for him and no one saw it and i\nloved that no one saw it too like i'm\ntotally with you i think that's that's\nincredible so i want to go back a bit\ninto the book where you talk about your\nchildhood and i love hearing about\npeople's childhood because i i think we\nunderestimate how much\nour childhood\nimpacts how we grow up like i always say\nto people that their\ntheir adult pursuits are based on the\ninner child's needs most people's adult\npursuits are based on what they didn't\nhave as a child\ncan you share with us the relationship\nyou had with your parents growing up\nbecause you grew up with your\ngrandparents right so can you walk us\nthrough that scenario absolutely yeah so\num i was born in a in a city in\nnortheastern china called harbin or\nharbin\nand um shortly after i was i was born my\nparents actually immigrated to canada\nthey were\npursuing you know their higher education\nso my father was studying his phd\nand then he was able to bring my mother\nover and they actually ended up studying\nat the same university uh queen's\nuniversity in kingston ontario shout out\nto queens\nand um\nand you know it was it was not feasible\nat the time for them to bring you know a\nnewborn baby with them they would have\nhad to basically i would have been a\nfull-time job in and of myself but then\nthey also had to maintain a full course\nload they had to do research you know um\nit just didn't make sense and and of\ncourse they there was not enough money\nwe were so poor like they didn't have\nany money to pay for child care at all\nso um it really made sense to leave me\nin the in the care of my grandparents so\num\nreally like they were the ones who who\nraised me and and for about four and a\nhalf years i lived what i believed to be\na pretty idyllic life um in in china i i\nknow i knew that i had parents kind of\nconceptually that my grandparents were\nnot my parents but i also didn't really\ncare i had\num i had people who loved me i had a\ntribe i had a family\nand you know we slept in the same bed\nevery single night and i just i went to\nsleep feeling like\nmy heart was full and that i was loved\nand that was really you know at the end\nof the day you don't really need\nanything more than that um that being\nsaid\none day when i'm\nabout four and a half uh stranger shows\nup at the door\nand he says i'm your dad i'm your dad\nand i'm here to take you\nto this new life in canada where\neverything is better you know um you\nknow we have so many more opportunities\nin canada your mother and i are working\non building a life in canada um you're\ngoing to come with us and be in our\nfamily and um\nand i was like okay\nbut can i bring my grandparents you know\nthat like the fundamental\nyou think about a child and what's going\non in his mind he's like but but i don't\nwant to say good i don't want to leave\nmy grandparents they're my family\num but you know that that was you know\nthe whole family was kind of together on\nthis kind of messaging and i was\neventually convinced or coerced um to to\nleave the country and to go with my dad\nto canada\nand um you know effectively if you\nreally think about it jay i was i was\nadopted by my own biological parents at\nage five and you know whereas for my\nparents i think it must have felt like\nthis happy ending because after so many\nyears apart the family is finally\ntogether you know we could finally live\nour happily happily ever moment\nin in this new country um what it ended\nup being was a lot more complicated than\nthat in in truth in reality um because\nyou know first and foremost my parents\ndidn't know who i was they had no idea\nthe person that i had grown to become\nyou know a lot of things set by the time\nyou're you know the age of four and a\nhalf five developmentally you know a lot\nof things about your personality\nsolidify and i think\nthey were surprised by the child that\nthey eventually got you know and and\nyou know the other thing too is that\nthey had no learning curve in parenting\nit's just one day\nthey were all of a sudden responsible\nfor this child\nand you know whereas if you had given\nbirth and you had stayed by your baby\nday after day you would have at least\nkind of like\nhad the ability to learn as things were\ngoing but then there was this whole gap\nin time where they just you know they\ndidn't know and um\nand so what ensued in the in the next\nlike i want to say like one or one and a\nhalf decades was um you know a lot of\nintergenerational conflict and butting\nof heads and and just like you know\nparents and and\nmyself i didn't have any siblings but\njust me and my parents just having\ndifferent expectations of each other you\nknow fundamentally misunderstanding each\nother and oftentimes getting into big\nblowout arguments sometimes you know\nwith violence and um\nand uh you know not not great not great\ntimes all together but uh\nevidently you know the book you know\nhaving been out and and having come full\ncircle so many years later you know um\ni'm my parents are my best friends today\nand it's the recognition of that journey\nthat we went on together\num that um that really catalyzed the the\ncreation of this book so i'm really\nexcited to talk about it for people to\nread it thank you for sharing that with\nus because i think you know today\neveryone sees you as the superhero and\nthey see you as obviously you're just\ncrushing it right now and\nyou don't realize that there's a real\nperson behind all of this and there's a\nreal journey and a real story and\nthere's a real\nreal life is the right word i think we\ndisconnect superheroes and that's why\norigin stories have always been so\nfascinating as kids of like well how did\nthis person get there and i love that\nyou called this your origin story\nbecause it does feel very grounded\nthere's this line in the book that i\nthat really resonated with me\nand i think it's even more fascinating\nagainst the backdrop of what you just\nsaid\nand you said that my parents like many\nin their generation were willing to\nsacrifice greatly\nso they could provide financial\nstability for their children\nand the reason why that resonated with\nme is i think a lot of people can\nconnect with that\nwhen i hear that it sounds like\nyou reconcile\ntheir shortcomings\nwith\nwhat they were able what they were\ntrying to do at least from an intention\npoint of view what do you think you what\ndo you think you learned\nduring that time not now i love hearing\nthat you're best friends now and you've\nreally connected but what do you think\nyou took away during that time when it\nwasn't great and it was painful what\nwere you what were you learning what\nwere you developing at that time\ni mean i think i was i think i was\ndeveloping\nan internalized sense of of hatred for\nmy own identity i i could\nevery day at home was this constant\nbattle of culture and values and and you\nknow language because you know we were\nspeaking in different languages to each\nother how could we possibly fully\nunderstand where each you know the other\ncame from so i you know i grew up under\nthe assumption of like i've got the\nworst parents in the world they are\nembarrassing to be around they're\nembarrassing to take in public and they\ndon't unders you know all of my friends\nand my peers they have parents who\nunderstand hey our children like to go\nout our children like to go to parties\nyou know for me and my parents you know\nthey were so fixated on this idea of\nacademic success being the only way out\nor being the only way to maintain the\nlevel of stability and and to keep a\nroof over our heads that they were just\nlike you shouldn't be doing this you\nneed to be studying you know that was\nthe messaging that was constantly\nbeing repeated time and time again and\nand you know without kind of\nhitting too hard this idea of a tiger\nparent that i hate that narrative um you\nknow it really just comes from\nyou know\nmy parents coming to and i'm starting to\ni'm starting to look back now so you\nstop me whenever it's starting to get no\nno no i love it no i love it you're\nself-aware but but you know my parents\ncame here\nwith with nothing and so the anxiety of\nthat an immigrant feels i i think is\nsomething that you know even i never\nunderstood because i was sheltered from\nit right like of course but but looking\nback and like of course my parents were\nobsessed with the idea of having a\nstable career and of course they they\ndidn't pause to think about what they\nwere passionate about doing they just\nwanted to they knew they were electrical\nengineers so they were like this is my\ntrade this is my craft i can get work\nlike this and i can build a future for\nmy family and if i teach my son to do\nthe same he will be able to do the same\nthing for his family and\nwhen you look at it that way you're like\nof course they acted that way but but\nyeah at the time it really made me\nresent\nthem and it made me resent\num their their value and their culture\nwhich incidentally was is my culture you\nknow yeah\ngoing to regret that very deeply no i\nlove how real this is because i i can\nrelate to that as a south asian growing\nup in london it was the same thing my my\nmom moved to london when she was 16 she\nhad to like find a job economic\nstability like you know they didn't they\ndidn't have wealth and family or\nanything in england and then\nyou know it's like i grew up with the\nsame messaging and it was for the same\nreasons but i think\nit's so important that\nthat\ntime doesn't turn into bitterness for us\nor\nthat feeling of resentment towards our\nparents long term\nbecause when we do try and understand\nwhat you're sharing with us you're like\noh it it's not that you it's it's not\nthat it's okay that they didn't think\nabout these things it's that you\nunderstand why they didn't have the time\nright it's like reconciling so you tell\na story in the book when your mother i\nbelieve locked you outside of the\nhallway\nuh do you mind sharing parts of that\nstory with us about how different you\nthink parenting was in your home\ncompared to others because i think that\nreally highlighted that difference you\nspoke about\nyeah and i mean i mean\nthe way that my parents treated me was\nalso also by the way very different than\nthe way that my grandparents you know\never interacted with me and and i i\ntruly believe like you know with my yeah\nand my night and night like we we\nthey were they were perfect in every\nevery possible sense of the word you\nknow they were affectionate they\nyou know were reasonable it wasn't like\nthey spoiled me\nto become this like total entitled brat\num you know they were reasonable they\ntaught lessons they were patient\nand and with my parents i feel like you\nknow\nthat patience just wasn't there and of\ncourse they're you know a lot younger\nthey had you know had to take class they\nwere busy they were anxious about other\nthings but um\nthis i'll never forget the first time\nthat i was really punished was was when\ni you know what i wrote in the book and\num\ni had you know i think my dad had just\npicked me up uh from school and he was\nyou know kind of like well what did you\ndo at school today and it was just this\nreally innocent lie but we had gone\nswimming so i said oh we we were\nswimming and and my dad was like well\nare you know are you fast or who's the\nfastest kid in the class and\nbecause i i just wanted to impress my\nparents i was like i am\nand he was like are you sure\nand and then i don't know how this i\nmean it sounds ridiculous to say now but\ni was like you know after a while i was\nlike no i'm not sure i was lying\ni mean like how like it's not like we\nall hopped in a pool and and the\ninstructor was like all right everybody\nwe're going to grade this be like\neveryone's just having fun but of course\ni just you know i just really wanted i\njust really wanted to impress them and\nuh and and so i was like yeah i wasn't\nit was i was lying and my dad was like\nokay you did the right thing you told\nthe truth and i was like yeah you know\nplease don't tell mom because because my\nmother is um as you know as tough as my\ndad is my mom was like the real um\nenforcer of the family like very vicious\nand specific with her words like just\nthe words that cut you all you have this\none parent that sometimes you know whose\nwords just cut a little bit deeper that\nwas my mom and so i was like can you\nplease not tell don't tell mama like\nplease um and and he was like okay okay\ni won't\nand uh later on that night at dinner you\nknow we're we're together my mom was\nlike so how was school\num and i was like oh it's fine we went\nswimming and i\nmy dad\ni i remember this so vividly and it's so\nfunny because when i tell him he doesn't\num but i'm like no this happens my dad\nsold me out so he promised me that he\nwasn't going to tell my mom and then he\nwas like simu told a lie today\nand\nbasically like literally the moment that\nhe finished saying it my mom was out of\nher chair you know and grabbed my hand\nled me out of the door\nyou know shut it in my face and and\nlocked it\nand i was i was out i mean for uh for a\nfive-year you know for a six-year-old\nit's probably like 15 minutes for me it\nfelt like forever and i was struggling\nwith so many things you know like\nyou know first of all i was i was being\ndisciplined in a way that i had never\nbeen before my dad had like betrayed my\ntrust so it was really it was a really\num pivotal moment in my time in canada\nbecause i really felt quite alone\nyou know i miss my grandparents i wanted\nto be home i was promised i was sold on\nthis utopic life\nin this new country when really all i\nwanted was to go back you know\num so so yeah that i mean that that kind\nof was the\nwas the um catalyzing moment for\neverything that that came after really\nforeshadowed all of the conflicts that\nwe would that we would have issues about\ntrust you know the physical physical\ndiscipline and just remember feeling so\nalone out in that hallway what what i\nfind so great about this book and why\nwhy i want everyone to read it\nas as fans of yours is people who are\nstruggling with their own identity in\ntheir own journey maybe there's people\nwho are listening and watching who've\nmoved city moved country maybe\nyou've actually\nuh gone through an adoption process\nmaybe you've moved with your family like\nthe reason why it's so powerful is your\nmemory is really vivid like it's it's\namazing how strong these moments are and\nthat's why i wanted you to share that\nstory because it's like a lot of people\ni speak to don't really have strong\nmemories of five six years old like a\nlot of people's memories\ndon't start till a lot later memories\nthat they can really hold on to and so\none of the things i do i think you do so\nbeautifully as a writer in this book is\nthat we really go back with you like\nwe're really there in that environment\nlike it it almost feels like i'm\nwatching the movie right so i just want\nto congratulate you from from a writing\npoint of view that it's it's so strong\nthat i really feel like i'm there and\nand that's why the book is so powerful\nbecause\nyou know who hates that by the way is my\nparents yeah when they read it they're\nlike\nlike we've had so many conversations you\nknow they've been so wonderfully\nsupportive about the book and i\ndefinitely couldn't have written it\nwithout them you know without their\ncooperation and the hours and hours of\nsitting together going beat by beat you\nknow um you know the story starts in\ntheir infancy and their formative years\nin china in the 60s and 70s you know i\nreally wanted readers to have that\nperspective as well but it's really\nfunny they're like they just they read\nthose parts and they're like the world\nis going to hate us yeah like why would\nyou air out all of our dirty all of the\nworst things that we've ever done and\nyou know i i've been very i've tried to\nbe very diplomatic with them throughout\nthe whole process and like with the most\namount of love ever i'm like\nyeah but you did those things and you\nknow\nwhen you're when you're young too you're\nso impressionable it's like you remember\nthose cuts\nthose you know and every child has them\nthose moments where you know if\nit's a parent not being there when they\nwanted them to be and and you know of\ncourse no parent is perfect and you're\nalways going to have those moments as a\nchild but they exist and i feel like\nmy goal\nis to you know in telling the story is\nnot some sort of retribution for the way\nthat they treated me or spoke to me but\nit's that you know\ncomes from this idea or responding to\nthis idea that so many immigrant\nfamilies will will internalize what goes\non and it's not\nyou know it's not common practice for us\nto share\nin these in these moments share these\nmemories and these stories and what it\ncan create is this really isolating\nenvironment for for the children and you\nknow and oftentimes to the parents as\nwell you know it\nwhen when you come to a new country with\nno support system it can it already\nfeels so isolating and so what i wanted\nto do with with the book with the story\nwas to show immigrant children\neverywhere that they're not alone and\nthat you know it's okay to be vulnerable\nit's okay to share and and you know\nthere are millions and millions more\nstories just just like this and the way\nout you know the way to you know not\nnecessarily the solution to all things\nbut certainly\nyou know a step in coping is is in\nsharing and in you know\nfinding community and a sense of of you\nknow of of identity\nand commonality\nyeah well i think when you're sharing\nyour private experiences publicly\nthat's going to help people in turn with\ntheir private lives right like that's\nwhat's happening here it's like people\nbeing able to see like yeah that's\nexactly what i had at home or that was\nsimilar what i'm really interested by\nseeing is like\nactually the fact that you just said\nthat your parents were a part of the\nprocess and of course you talk about\nthem in the book until their journey to\nme actually that's a beautiful healing\nstory in and of itself that here you are\nairing out as you said dirty laundry\nbut actually the people all involved are\nfriends and uh a family\ntell us about what were some of the\nsteps to\nrepairing\nand amending that connection as you grew\nand matured because i think that's what\nmost of us need help with with our\nparents is\nwe may even understand what they did and\nwhy they did it but to really have a\npositive relationship with them as we\nget older\nthat's an amazing story in and of itself\nwhat were some of those early steps that\nyou took\nto reflect repair and amend i would say\nthe first steps toward well first of all\nto paint the picture of what things were\nlike in the first couple of years when i\ndecided to um throw away my entire\neducation and pursue a career in the\narts you can imagine\num you know my parents were not pleased\nand there was a there was almost like\ntwo years\nwhere we rarely spoke to each other it\nwas it was just very you know things\nwere very tense\num and then i i booked a show called\nblood and waters my very first you know\nseries regular role i was in the main\ncast and um\nthe reason i booked this role um you\nknow apart from giving a not bad\naudition was was i was one of the only\nactors in the country who could speak\nmandarin fluently and so\ni i had a bilingual character i was in a\nhotel room in vancouver i had\nmonologues and monologues in chinese and\ni couldn't read i\nwas i'm not literate in chinese right so\nit's a very difficult language it's i\nthink easy to be able to speak it\nrelatively\nimpossible to learn um the work because\nthere's no alphabet system it's just\nreally you either know the word or you\ndon't\nand um and i needed help so i\nrang my parents up and i was like you\nneed to you need to help me with this\nand\nthey very begrudgingly\nwere you know got on the phone with me\nand i feel like in the process of that\nconnection you know the process of that\nof that um you know learning there was a\nconnection that was formed\nand my parents came to understand just\nhow\nhard i was willing to work you know\nbecause i think up until that point\ntheir mentality was oh simu simu doesn't\nhave the toughness\nyou know he he couldn't he he wasn't\ntough enough to maintain a job at you\nknow deloitte with the accounting firm\nthat i worked at um you know simu just\nlacks mental fortitude and i think that\nwas the first time that they had their\nbelief system challenged they were like\noh simu's met very mentally resilient\nand he is willing to work hard it's just\nthat he it's you know\njust different passions of something\nelse that was calling him and from that\npoint on i think they started to really\nbuy into my career and they started to\nshare in the wins and the losses because\nbefore then they didn't really care you\nknow i'd say hey they'd be like what's\nnew i'd be like hey i booked i booked a\ncommercial\nfor this restaurant you know uh it's\ngoing all across canada and they'd be\nlike great so we\nso you threw away an education\nin private school and four years of\nuniversity to make commercials\nfor people to watch\ncongratulations like they were pretty\nsavage about it um so this was the first\ntime that they they started to really\nlike you know maybe respect my decision\nwhat i was doing and um you know shortly\nafter that i\nthankfully booked a show called kim's\nconvenience which ended up being this\nyou know big hit i mean countries all\naround the world\nand you know catapulted me out of this\nlike destitute state of like credit card\ndebt artistry to you know being kind of\nsomewhat middle class and and you know\njust not worried about where my my next\njob was was going to come from\num and from there you know from then on\ni think they they really started to be\nto be cheerleaders\nbut of course you know that doesn't mean\nyou know just because there was an\nexternal success in our in our lives it\ndoesn't necessarily mean that the\nrelationship is all in good you know i\nwas still very aware that i had trauma\nand resentment inside me and so\nin um\nsomewhere around that time i'm not going\nto say when because my mother's going to\nmurder me but um my mother turned 60.\nand um\ni know she's so sensitive about it oh my\ngod she's gonna kill me and um\nfor her 60th birthday i was writing her\nthis card that was that was very\nkind of just generic by all means you\nknow happy birthday i love you that's\nsort of actually not i love you um\njust kind of happy birthday about all\nthat sort of stuff and then i kind of\nstopped myself and i was like i there\nare so many things that i want to say to\nthis woman you know\nand um and i just i can't keep going\npretending like things are fine i felt\nlike that we were all just kind of in\nthis\nplaying out this this act we were all\nacting the scenario where there was just\nno trauma and everything was was all\ngood and sunshine and i was like i need\nto i need to get some of these thoughts\ndown so instead of this card i actually\nwrote her like an eight-page letter\nyou know talking about my feelings as a\nchild talking about how i always felt\ninadequate how i was constantly chasing\ntheir expectations of me and feeling\nlike i was coming up short and how\nultimately through it all\nyou know now i i understood\nyou know that that where where it came\nfrom wasn't wasn't this place of malice\nor evil or anything like that but just\nof of\nintense anxiety and wanting the very\nbest for for their next generation and\nand having sacrificed so much to be able\nto provide that opportunity right so i\nended the letter with you know i'm so\nextremely grateful for everything that\nyou've done i love you we don't say that\nto each other enough i hope you know\nthis will change the course of our\nrelationship but even if it doesn't i\nfeel like these are the words that i\nneed to say to you right now\nand you know i was very very nervous but\ni put in the envelope i you know i\nhanded it to her and she read it later\nthat night\nand um you know i knew that one of two\nthings could have happened right\neverything could have stayed the same it\ncould have been the status quo my mother\ncould not have you know reacted you know\npositively or she could really take the\nletter really understand and absorb its\nintention and then you know join me in\ncharting out a new path because one of\nthe other things that i said was it may\nseem like we've spent so many years at\neach other's throats um but we still\nhave so much time\nyou know if we if we started today we\nstill have so much time\nand um\nand my mother wrote me back and she said\ni've been i've been crying i've been you\nknow sitting with this letter and i'm\nready to join you and\nthat really was the moment that our\nrelationship stopped being\nyou know surface level and started to\nget so much deeper and the more\nthat we you know the more time we spent\ntogether the more we realize just how\nmuch we enjoyed each other's company i\ntook my mother out on a mother's day\ndate for the very first time that year\nand it was like the two of us just\nsitting across from each other it's just\nthe most beautiful moment um that you\nknow i i just i'm so incredibly grateful\nfor\num yeah and everything that's happened\nsince the success the fame and the\naccola i mean\nthat's allowed me to really fully bring\nthem along for the ride and to let them\nin you know whereas i feel like if we\ndidn't have those conversations there\nwould always be a part of me that\nsuspected that you know hey what what\nwould our relationship be like if that\nsuccess didn't come if i didn't book\nthis role\nbut i feel like you know because we did\nthe work\nbefore\num\nyou know i i that there's not even a\nsingle part of me that feels that feels\nthat way you know and instead i'm just\nfocused on being able to give my parents\nthe best possible life in their third\nact you know in in being able to for for\nimmigrant parents who are so who\nliterally like when we went to\nmcdonald's would would try to convince\ntheir son that they weren't hungry you\nknow but but would get their son the\nhappy meal you know and would watch him\neat\nlike my parents never wanted anything\nyou know like\nfor themselves\nand uh\nit's just an incredible feeling to be\nable to give back to them you know and\nto and to show them the things that they\ndeserve to have it's\nit's really wonderful\nsamia that's i'm so glad you went into\nthat with us man that that is just so\nwonderful to hear about the real work\nand i love that you drew that important\nconnection that\nyou didn't assume that the external\nsuccess was solving the internal problem\nand that the internal needed its own\nwork and i think that that requires so\nmuch maturity because for most people\nthey go well once i get this\nthat solves everything because now\neveryone's going to be happy\nand i think that that's\na\nvery\nuh undeveloped viewpoint because\nthey're complete they're two completely\ndifferent things and actually i want to\npoint out a few other things to people\nwho are listening\nthe connection you made with your\nparents around learning chinese and them\nseeing how hard you had to work\ni think that that's genius as a lesson\nfor all of us that if your parents or\nyour friends or your family members\ndon't believe in you they're not coming\non the journey with you\nlet them come on the journey that they\ncan understand right if your parents are\naccountants bring them in and have them\nbe involved in seeing how you're\nmanaging your finances if you're someone\nwho's trying to do something artistic\nyour parents may not understand the art\nbut they may understand the engineering\naspect like i think that is such a\nrefreshing way to think about it because\nwe want to be recognized by our parents\nfor the art but that's not what they\nunderstand and appreciate and so there's\nsuch a brilliant lesson there for for\nall of us in how we connect\nand and then another oh sorry go and see\nmy story go ahead oh no no no i was just\ngonna i was just gonna echo echo the\nimportance of that and to say yes like\nyou know you know parents are like we\nare all capable of evolving but only at\na certain speed yeah and so for my you\nknow for many parents i would say not\njust mine if you were just to show up\none day and say i'm gonna be an actor\ni'm gonna be a professional basket you\nknow basketball like that's a bit of a\nmental leap and so you do like you know\nmaybe start to take them on that journey\nor or and maybe understand that it's not\ngonna happen overnight you know yes um\nour value systems are just so different\nanyway yeah please go on no no i i love\nhearing this from you i i think the\nmistake we make\nis that when we share our passion\nwith our parents or our family we've\nalready been thinking about it for three\nyears\nand we just told them in three minutes\nso now we're expecting them in three\nminutes to catch up with our three years\nof thinking and that just doesn't\ncorrelate that doesn't correspond and i\nlove i i really really appreciate how\nyou've thought about this and and how\nyou've made those choices i never the\nfunny thing is i don't know if you know\nthis i spent three years working at\naccenture so\ni before i did yeah so when you said\ndeloitte i was like i know exactly what\nthat looks like i was a consultant at\naccenture so you said deloitte i was\nlike i know exactly what the world looks\nlike when you told your friends or your\ncolleagues at deloitte that you were\ngonna make a career switch\nwhat was their reaction then and are you\nin touch with any of them now\nand and tell us about that journey from\na friend's point of view you know you\nknow what's really funny i i don't i i\ndon't keep in touch with like a single\nperson\nalmost a single person from that entire\nkind of business school\nera of my life right which was like the\nyou know the latter half of college as\nwe were kicking off recruiting and you\nknow it was like so so you know jay\nhaving worked at accenture which by the\nway is very prestigious consulting firm\nfor uh anybody who who doesn't know\num you know there's a bit of a hierarchy\nat business school and it's like you\nknow you all get together you talk you\nknow you learn you talk about you do\ncases i'm sure you did case studies and\nall that and then you know\nafter when it starts\ngetting to time to recruit for summer\ninternships and full-time jobs it's like\ninvestment bankers management\nconsultants everything else and then you\nknow um accountants at the at the very\nbottom so i was always like my marks\nwere not good in business class i was\nnot the guy that read the wall street\njournal every day\num you know just like woke up every day\npassionate about capital markets or\nabout you know corporate strategy\num i was the guy that that went home and\nplayed video games with his roommate\nbecause i just like\nwasn't engaged\nand and so yeah i just felt like i was\nconstantly a fish out of water for that\nentire period of my life and the day i\ngot laid off at deloitte you know i\nremember very vividly again um we all\nremember our traumas and i remember\ngoing into the managing partner's office\ni remember the woman from hr that that\nwas like standing next to him\nand then the moment where he was like\nwe're gonna determine we're here to\nterminate your employment and then the\nhr lady stepping in and saying you we're\ngoing to give you 10 minutes to collect\nyour things and we're going to escort\nyou back\ninto the into the you know the office\nand and of course it's an open concept\noffice so everybody can see but we're\ngoing to escort you there so you can you\nknow pack up your final things and i\nremember\nyou know walking back out onto the floor\nand\nnot a single person made eye contact\nwith me spoke with me you know people\nthat i thought were my friends and i\ndon't necessarily put that blame on them\ni mean obviously there is just a really\nawkward moment and they probably were\njust like oh my god this is happening\nbut um\nthat was it that was my goodbye to a lot\nof those people was like i looked around\nnobody said anything\neveryone's heads were down they just\nlike wanted to pretend like it wasn't\nhappening and so in complete and utter\nsilence i packed up my things and then\nand then i left and it was almost like\nthat it was such a such a clean break um\ni did run into somebody i used to work\nwith um a few months later or i'd say\nmaybe like a year later when i was you\nknow just starting out as an actor\nand and of course auditioning more than\ni was working getting rejected more than\ni was getting hired and as one of my\nother jobs to kind of you know pay the\nbills i\ni was handing out dog food as samples on\nthe on that on this side of the street\nand that job took me into the financial\ndistrict near where i used to work and\num this fellow was on his lunch break\nand ran into and kind of tapped me on\nthe shoulder and was like simu\nand you know he had been like promoted i\ncould tell by his suit that he was like\nyou know he was at least a manager and i\nwas i was handing out dog food and um\nthat was a it was a really hard moment\nfor me\ni had to come home and like you know it\nwas like a re-evaluate all your life\nchoices moment but thankfully you know i\nthink i had become so happy with the\nperson that even if i wasn't getting the\nwork necessarily i was so happy with the\nperson that i became right out of the\nshell of somebody who\njust didn't care about anything couldn't\nseem to find any sort of motivation in\nlife came this person who was just like\nhungry every single day ready to attack\nthe day\nand um was even willing to uh you know\nhand out dog food samples yeah to be\nable to support that dream that that's\nwhat i'm hearing when i'm speaking to\nyou about this today and of course when\ni was reading the book and when we've\nhad interactions before what's really\nclear for me today is even though in the\nbook\nyou talk about how you wanted to always\nfind approval and validation from your\nparents\nand other people what i'm actually\nfeeling when i'm hearing you today is\nthat\nyou've kind of had to do that for\nyourself\nthe whole time because there hasn't\nalways been that external validation so\nat least from our conversation today\nwhat i'm garnering\nis that at every step you validated\nyourself\nbecause no one was there to validate you\nwould you say that's true would you say\nthat that was part of building that\nconfidence in who you were no matter the\nexternal position of your journey i mean\nyeah absolutely\num you know i i wasn't you know and i i\ndon't necessarily think i'm the most\nconfident person in the world i think i\nstruggle especially like you you want to\nknow what the imposter syndrome feels\nlike try me me at the oscars for the\nfirst time that is a crazy environment\nto be in\nand all of a sudden you're looking at\neveryone around you you're like oh my\ngod what am i doing here\nbut um\nyou know i would say this i spent\nso much of my life\ntrying to live up uh to somebody else's\ndefinition of success what what you know\ntrying to be somebody else's definition\nof successful whether it was my parents\nwhether you know in some cases even my\nfriends you know i have a lot of friends\nwho went into law and medicine and\nmanagement consulting um\nand um\nand you know i really it wasn't until\ni had that rock bottom moment that i\nsaid you know that none of that is\nworking i can't live for someone else as\nmuch as i can be grateful for what my\nparents have done for me i cannot\nsurrender my then surrender my own life\nin service of what they did you know i\nhave to\nlive for myself and once i made that\ndecision and i focus and i became more i\nmean i honestly became more\nself-centered became more selfish um\nyou know i i felt like a new\nlife started to kind of come out of me\nand\nit is to this day the best thing that's\nthat's ever happened\nwhat what are some of your daily weekly\nmonthly yearly habits or practices that\nyou've done to kind of build that\nresilience and mindset because i feel\nlike you know it's\nyou've you've made that decision and\nthen like you said you have to build\naround that decision it's not just\noh yeah i'm gonna become a movie star\nyou know it's it's not as basic as that\nand it isn't how you talk about it\neither talk to us about some of those\nhabits practices you spoke about\nmanifestation earlier like tell us about\nsome of those concrete examples of\nthings that you've done that you think\nhave been really integral to getting to\nwhere you are today which i believe is\ntruly just the beginning of a whole\nnother journey but you know you've\nyou've been on this massive journey to\nget here and i still feel like you know\nthere's just so much more for you to\nuncover i'm sure you feel that way and\nthat's what i felt from the book too\nlike but tell us about some of the ones\nthat have worked so far\nit is so important in in my line of work\nspecifically but all in all lines of\nwork really to identify\nwhat is in your control and what is not\nand if you are going to base your\nsuccess on factors that are outside of\nyour control then i believe that you are\nsetting yourself up for failure and not\nthe good kind of failure not the kind of\nfailure that you learn from and you\nevolve from and you think critically\nabout but failure like you know you're\ngonna just wonder where the time went\nand you're going to wonder why you never\ngot your opportunity right and so\nidentify you know having an internal\nlocus of control and being hyper focused\non the things that are within your grasp\nit has been the the\ncritical critical factor of success over\nwhen i look at the last 10 years of my\nlife and and as an actor this is so hard\nbecause so much of you know career\nprogression for a lot of us on the\nsurface looks like\nokay we go into acting class we we you\nknow work on our craft and then we get\nan agent and if you get an agent there's\nthis expectation that an agent is going\nto do a lot of the leg work for you is\ngoing to set up an audition is going to\nhelp you book a job and so i feel like\nit's a very dangerous place to be in\nwhen you start to place when you start\nto offload that responsibility to an\nagent to a third party who maybe doesn't\nhave your best interest in mind i mean\nthat's the way it's supposed to work but\nan agent\nis worried about so many other things\nthey might be focused on a client that\nis earning more than you they might just\nbe focused on protecting their own\nrelationships because you know what\nactors come and go in the industry but\nan agent you know has relationships with\ncasting directors and with studios and\nthat becomes the more important thing\nthose are the people that you know at\nthe end of the day pay them um in my\nopinion at least um and so the idea of\nfor me of waiting for the phone to ring\nfor my agent to give me my next\nopportunity felt like death and so for\nme you know from day one i had it in my\nmind that i was going to create i was\ngoing to be a creator you know i was\ngoing to be\nsomebody who wasn't just like acting in\nfront of a screen so screenwriting was\nsomething that i tried to develop in\nmyself very early on\nyou know i i couldn't take a lot of you\nknow usable skill i couldn't salvage a\nlot of usable skills from business\nschool but i feel like my writing was\nmaybe one of them\nand so um you know i just i just wrote i\nwrote and wrote and wrote and i wrote\nsome of the worst scripts you'll ever\nread um but i i constantly put myself in\nin situations where i could um be a\na more self-sufficient artist rather\nthan somebody who is dependent and that\nled me to apply for production you know\nconservatories and intensives you know\num one of my one of my most\nfulfilling experiences was um with this\ncompany called the real asian\ninternational film festival in in\ntoronto and and what the film festival\ndid every year was they had um a\nfilmmaking collective so they accepted\nyou know people under 25 years of age\nand they basically ran them through um\nyou know what it what it meant to write\na script what it meant to crew you know\nto crew a production to find a dp to you\nknow take um a a film project from\npre-production through to principal\nphotography through post-production how\nto do basic editing and mix sound and\nfrom there i you know i really came out\nof it feeling like okay i hold the keys\nto my destiny\nof course the way that things played out\ni had a few lucky breaks along the way\nthere is no\ngetting to this level without you know\na pretty significant amount of luck but\nthat being said you know i i have always\nbelieved that luck is is you know where\nwhere preparation meets opportunity and\ni wanted to be as prepared as i possibly\ncould be and so for me that meant\nyeah that meant doing the things around\nbeing an actor you know whether that was\nproduction whether that was\nscreenwriting or you know even\nhonestly even doing stunts at one point\ni was like a substitute stuntman i\nwasn't incredible at it but you know i\nwas just trying to find different ways\nto diversify my revenue stream and to\nfind just pay me to do something in the\nindustry i'll do it and yeah and\ni feel like you know people would ask me\nall the time what if you don't make it\nseem and my answer i was always like\ndon't you see i'm making it i'm making\nit right now look at all the stuff that\ni'm doing there's you know i don't know\nwhether i'm gonna make it as an actor or\nas a as a shooter or as a you know as a\nproduction guy or even as a stunt man\nbut i've got all these things going for\nme\nyou know i'm and i feel like i'm filling\nup my days with meaningful work rather\nthan just waiting and waiting for\nsomething that i have no control over\ni love hearing that i'm so glad that you\nyou brought that up because i think so\noften we get so fixated on\nwe get so fixated on i want to do this\nor i want to be this and if it's not\nthat i don't want to do anything\nand that mindset pushes that dream away\nlike you get further and further and\nfurther away because actually if you're\nin and around the circles of that\njourney you get closer and closer and\ncloser and closer and and i think that\nthat that switch you just made and\nyou've talked about and to hear that you\nhad to do that\ni i genuinely love hearing that because\nwhenever i'm speaking to someone too\ni'll say the same thing to them is like\nbe around the industry be in the\nindustry somehow be in those spaces in\nthose rooms because then it's more then\nyou're closer to where you want to be\nrather than saying well i only want to\nbe a movie director but i'm not ready to\ndirect a ad or a commercial\nand it's like that doesn't that doesn't\nwork like that so you know i think\nthat's a huge huge uh lesson amazing\nadvice\nuh sima you've been so generous with\nyour time you've been uh\nyou've been so kind i know it's late in\nlondon i want everyone to know right now\nit's like\n7 00 p.m in london uh eight hours ahead\nwhere simu's right now so he's been\ndoing this at the end of his day after a\nbusy day\nuh so that we can make this happen i'm\nin la so our eight our gathering it's a\npleasure don't even\nno no i just want to acknowledge and\nrecognize you man like i i understand\nhow how busy you're working out there\nyou're not you're not there on vacation\nuh and so\nwe end every on-purpose interview with\nthe final five and these have to be\nanswered in one word or one sentence\nmaximum so you can do one word to one\nsentence uh so simu these are your final\nfive uh the first question\nis what is the best advice you've ever\nreceived or heard\ngood things come to those who do\nah i like that nice we've never had that\nit's a great one uh okay second question\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nreceived or heard\ngood things come to those who wait\nnice answer all right question number\nthree what's the how would you define\nyour current purpose in life you want me\nto answer that in one word or one\nsentence um yeah yeah you can you can\nplay with it you can be an educator yeah\nyou can video your dad you've been good\nso far you've been like you've been\nkilling these two questions already\nthey get harder um yeah\nmy current purpose um\nit's to\nit's to amplify\nuh\nvoices of color\nit's to champion projects um you know\nfeaturing myself or otherwise that i\nbelieve\nspeak to similar to my book\num you know the the stories of\nimmigrants the stories of people who\nhave been traditionally underrepresented\nwho have traditionally not been uh given\na voice\nand to and to be a a living example of\nyou know of\nof the importance of diversity and the\nimportance of inclusion\nand um not just as an actor but you know\nas we've talked about\nbeing a multidisciplinary and being a\nproducer you know and being being\nsomebody who who can really affect the\nway the decisions are made in hollywood\ni love that man all right question\nnumber four what's the first thing you\ndo in the morning and the last thing you\ndo every night\ni am so bad with mornings\ngo for it i'm a good morning person\nso i probably the first thing i do in\nthe morning is wish i could go back to\nsleep yeah yeah that's right um\num the last thing i do every night\nwhat i\ni brush i brush my teeth that's like\nyeah that's cool that's not that's cool\nthat's good brush my teeth\nthink about\ni think i think about my lessons of the\nday if i have what what what what did\nthis day teach me yeah that's a great\none we never had that too i love that uh\nfifth and final question i'll put you\nout your misery uh fifth and final\nquestion uh if you could create one law\nor one habit that everyone in the world\nhad to follow every day what would it be\nwrite down the five people\nthat you most want to speak to to pick\ntheir brain\nand message all five of them i love that\nthat's a that's a great tip never had\nthat before i love that there's there is\nyou know\nthe the one you know it's like the other\npart of like the be self you know be\nself-sufficient be a creator is also\nthis recognition that you actually can't\ndo it yourself yes and um and in order\nfor you to be\nyou know a creative and you you have to\nfind the people around you and you have\nto steal ideas from people that you\nadmire and you have to look at other you\nknow ways in which people have found\nsuccess and cross-reference against that\nthat is so critically important i feel\nlike first sometimes there's a sense you\nknow to put\nfor us we glor maybe romanticize putting\nblinders on and just saying i'm working\non my grind i don't need anybody else\nit's just gonna be me that's never gonna\nhappen especially the arts you need to\nconstantly be talking to people that you\nadmire perspectives that you want to\nhear um you know that's the only way\nthat you learn and that you evolve this\nhas been way longer than one sentence\nit's a good
