    "transcript": "every single morning the first thing i\nwould do\nis cry just because being awake was that\ndifficult i felt like a like a ticking\ntime bomb it was just a matter of when\nreally\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to this very\nspecial episode of on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow\nnow i am so grateful for this amazing\ncommunity that we have for each and\nevery one of you\nthat lend me your ears twice a week and\nas you know i'm always always thinking\nabout new ways in which we can serve and\nsupport our community and your journeys\ntowards a better understanding of\nyourself and a better understanding of\nyour friends your family members and the\npeople around you and the world around\nus as well\nnow this episode is sponsored by better\nhelp online therapy\nand today i'm joined with jesus\nlicensed marriage and family therapist\nand head of clinical operations at\nbetter\nand in this new monthly series we will\nbe serving\nreal listeners of the show\nand community you'll hear the stories\nthe things that they struggle with and\nget to sit in on a real therapy session\nwith the intention of letting you know\nyou're not alone\nwe're all dealing with something\nand in every show we will address\ndifferent themes different experiences\nand our goal is to bring more awareness\nto taking care of your mental health and\nprovide everyone the tools resources and\nencouragement they need to heal their\npast for a brighter future\nnow when we were thinking about this\nidea one of the things i realized is\nthat today we hear a lot about\ntherapy people say oh my therapist said\nthis to me or i learned this in therapy\nbut rarely have we actually sat in on a\ntherapy session we don't know what it\nlooks like\nand often our family members don't know\nwhat it looks like\ni'm hoping that this is going to be a\nresource that you can share with your\nfriends your family so that they can\nunderstand therapy better so that you\ncan understand therapy better\nand as a community we can heal together\nas well\ntoday jesus and i are joined by a very\nwonderful and special individual named\nashley\nand ashley's joined us today to share\nher journey to share her story and i\nwant you to welcome her and give her the\ndeepest warmest most beautiful welcome\nfrom our on purpose community because\nshe so kindly agreed to be a part of\nthis today so jesus and ashley so\ngrateful to have you here\ni'm really really thankful to do this\nwith both of you\nand this is the first time we're doing\nthis uh it's historic and it's special\nbut thank you for being here yeah thank\nyou for having me yeah thank you for\nincluding both of us yeah it's exciting\nit is it is exciting and you know we\nwere talking a bit beforehand\nand\nwe really want to honor you ashley and\nand make sure that we\nserve you in an effective way\nand so i'm gonna now hand over to jesus\nwho's going to\nstart this wonderful conversation and\ndiscussion\nso\nover to you i mean just continuing a\nlittle bit of something jay was\nmentioning i want to make sure that you\nfeel safe that you feel comfortable so\nif there's ever a moment\nthat the conversation is going somewhere\nthat doesn't feel right for you you can\nindicate that in whatever way that you\nneed to\nbut thank you thank you so much for\nbeing willing and open to talk about\nyourself for so many people because i\nthink part of destigmatizing the idea of\nseeking support is seeing other people\ndo that right seeing other real people\ndoing that versus just hearing\ncommercial after ad about doing this or\ntrying this new thing so my\nunderstanding is that you've already\nbeen in therapy for some time\nand i was wondering if you could share a\nlittle bit about what initially got you\nto try it the first time so initially\ni was so against therapy i didn't want\nnothing to do with it like i thought it\nwas a lost cause i was like no one can\nhelp me like no one can\nimagine what i'm going through or even\ntrying to tell me what i can do to get\nbetter because\nin my mind nothing could help me\n2018 i believe\ni\noverdosed on like sleeping meds\nand i was after that i was kind of\nactually forced into it\nbut i didn't have a choice and that kind\nof started\nmy therapy journey and from there i was\nin therapy for two years\nsomething going on in your life led to\nsome unsafe behaviors like ways to cope\nlike people often turn to substance when\nthere is trauma because it helps numb\nstuff it helps you not think about\nthings\nand sometimes you you feel good right it\nmakes you feel not just better from this\nthing that has been painful but it feels\ngood and so i'm hearing that you had\nkind of like a mandated route into\ntherapy you mentioned that you\nwouldn't have considered it so what were\nsome of your ideas about what therapy\nwas before\ni didn't even know where to even begin\nwhat therapy looks like i just thought\nsomeone would just sit there and tell me\noh how do you feel about that\nwell how do you feel about that you know\nwhat i mean that's kind of like what i\nthought or like someone tried to preach\nto me or like tell me what to do or\nhow i should do it but really it wasn't\nlike that at all for me it ended up\nbeing something different\nexactly and i know you can't like give\nan entire synopsis of the therapeutic\njourney that you've been through but now\nthat you have gone through some of these\nsessions and it sounds like you found\nout it wasn't just so how did that make\nyou feel\nand i'm sure your therapist did ask many\ntimes well how did that make you feel\nwhat do you think of therapy navin what\nis therapy if somebody is to ask you a\nseasoned client like what to expect if\nthey were to try this out therapy is\namazing honestly i recommend\nit to everybody they tell me the\nproblem's like you know what you need a\ntherapist like i don't mean that in like\na negative it's not a negative thing at\nall it's very positive and i try to\nenlighten that\nbut for me when i was in therapy\nlike okay so you have these dark\nthoughts\nand when you don't recognize them or you\ndon't even know what they are it can\neasily spiral out of control\nand so with therapy she really helps me\nrecognize these thinking traps is what\nwe would call them\nand throughout the day i was more aware\nlike if i would say i'm worthless or you\nyou can't do that i was like wait a\nminute\nlike that's not true like let's kind of\nlay it out and understand like what this\nis like where it's coming from that's\nsomething i still practice until this\nday every single day catch myself\nthinking something negative and\nobviously there's more to it but\nit's something i really took away from\nthat yeah you're describing cognitive\nbehavioral things exactly that's what it\nis yeah you you went through this\nprocess where somebody helped you learn\nto identify and then articulate your\ninternal process because when you can\nstart talking about it or even\nunderstanding it a little bit better i\nthink that's when you really are able to\nmake strides in terms of finding healing\nfor yourself\nthe ability to let the things go that\nyou need to the ability to move on\nso you shared a little bit about\nwhat led to your first session right\nsomebody you were forced because you\nbecame unsafe to yourself exactly can\nyou share now what you think led to the\ntypes of feelings you were trying to\nnumb with substances\nwell\ni think it was just like a let up\num\nthere wasn't like a particular\nevent well something did trigger it and\ni can talk about that but it's overall\nlike i've been struggling with it for\nsince i was a young child\ni think it was like really just like a\nmatter of time\nand i think if i like received help\nsooner it wouldn't have gotten to that\npoint\nand for like a lot of people like me\nunfortunately something that drastic\nhas to happen for us even want to accept\nhelp\nyeah\nthe rock bottom experience right like\npeople not just people not i should say\nwe we often feel like\nthere's some kind of like\nshortcoming or something wrong with me\nif i need to reach out for support\nbecause a lot of us have this\nmisconception that therapy is for the\nweak minded yeah the people that are\nabsent of some kind of strong will of\ntheir own\nand it takes a lot of courage i think to\nfinally realize like vulnerability takes\na lot of strength being able to open up\nto someone being able to open up to\nyourself and admit a lot of stuff\nyeah and so you mentioned like\nyour life led to that moment i'm sure\nseries events and then you also said\nsomething about something did trigger\nthis so that's something that you're\nwilling to kind of open up about now\ni think at that time it was my\ndepression really had a hold of me\nevery single morning i would the first\nthing i would do\nis cry\njust because being awake was that\ndifficult i couldn't even i didn't even\nwant to spend the day with myself\nmentally that was going on for a couple\nmonths and\ni feel like no matter what i did like\none day i would wake up i feel like i\nwould do a good job\nbut i feel like it was still not enough\ni'm like wow i really gave it my all and\nit still was not enough i was like what\nis the point of being here one day my\nex-boyfriend and i got in a an argument\nand i was like wow i will\ni'm just again i'll never be enough i'll\nnever be worthy\nand normally in those situations i will\ncontemplate i'll have a conversation\nwith myself like okay ashley you know\none more day one more day like just hold\non hold on but that day there was no\nconversation with myself a switch just\nflipped and i just went through with it\nand i was like worst case scenario i'd\ngo to sleep\nand i wake up like okay but like best\ncase scenario for me i go to sleep and i\ni don't even know what happened that's\nwhat i was hoping for but didn't exactly\ngo as planned which is probably the best\ni felt like a like a ticking time bomb\nit was just a matter of when really\nyou're describing just like living for\nsuch a long time without knowing how to\nregulate your emotions and really\nprocess\na lot of stuff right and it like blew up\nin an argument\nit sounds like i want to shift gears a\nlittle bit and kind of ask a little bit\nmore about your previous therapy\nexperiences so far so while you've been\nin therapy i'm hearing you say that\nyou've learned some skills you've\nlearned some things to like cope with\nand navigate everyday life\nlike how did you learn that stuff like\nwhat is it that the therapist was doing\nto\nteach these things right so i'm a huge\nimagery person\nand like one thing we would do it was it\nwas kind of like how i describe it like\na court case okay like you have your\nlike the jury you have like the lawyers\nstuff like that\none thing i struggled with\nwas feeling like i'm not capable of\ntaking care of myself like i'm a grown\nadult i should be able to take care of\nmyself and i i couldn't and so we would\nbreak down the evidence like okay what's\nreal like what's false like let's just\nrecognize that there\nbecause when you're at this kind of\nmindset\nyou tell yourself so many lies stuff\nthat's not mean true\nand so i would i'm like okay well i do\nthis i do my laundry sometimes like i\nhave been working out past couple weeks\nlike oh you do feed yourself you have to\ngive yourself credit for the things that\nyou actually do\nand you i would we would write it down\nin the evidence section\nand we would write down like what was\nfalse\nand basically like the jury would come\nto the conclusion like no you are\ncapable so yeah you would just really\njust have to\nin that process give yourself credit and\nkind of look at\nwhat was real and what wasn't\nand\nyou would shift those thoughts of i\nshould be able to and you change it into\nno you are able to any and you do\nthat's a lot of just shifting the way\nyou think about stuff taking on\ndifferent perspectives hearing someone\nkind of\nre-word or like paraphrase your life in\na different way\nit sounds like you've learned a lot\nabout yourself too\nthere's like a period of time where it\nsounds like you didn't really know who\nyou were\nlike what parts of learning these skills\nlearning how to identify evidence for\nand against some kind of thought or\nbelief\nhelped you figure out who you are like\ndo you feel like there's some kind of\nself exploration self\nidentification type of process like\nit's not just learning skills right it's\ni guess i'm trying to get to your sense\nof\nany kind of change in the ways that you\nperceive yourself like how has that\nkind of shifted in that two-year period\nso a lot of people i believe feel\nlike they go to therapy and overnight\nthey're so much better\nand that's just not the case and for me\nagain again to this day i it's something\ni have to practice every single day so\nthere wasn't like one particular moment\nwhere i just like saw myself in like a\nbetter light\neventually you\nkeep practicing and practicing and\npracticing\nand eventually\nyou start to learn yourself you start to\nvalue yourself and you see yourself in a\nwhole different light you have you learn\nboundaries and you have them now and you\nhave rules for yourself and you don't\nallow\ncertain people or certain situations\ncontrol you as much because\nyou have more confidence in the tools\nand the coping mechanisms that you have\ndeveloped throughout therapy\nand that's definitely helped me\na lot and like to this day\ni really do see myself in a higher light\nand i don't let people\ntake advantage of me as much as i used\nto back in the day back in the day\npeople took advantage of you\nin what ways do you think that was\nhappening that you're able to prevent\nnow well just one example\nyou were mentioning earlier people\nthey they kind of self-sabotage whether\nit's drugs alcohol for me i didn't do\nany of that for me my reckless behavior\nwas being promiscuous and that's kind of\nlike what i learned growing up was\ngiving yourself for\nin return for love\nso that's what i thought i had to do\nin order to receive any sort of um\nlove\nand so i would give myself to guys you\nknow and like thinking oh this is how\nthey're gonna accept me this is like\nwhere they're gonna love me this is\nwhere i'm valued\nand now it's it's not like that at all\ni'm just like no i have so much more to\ngive than my body you know what i mean\nand so that's just one example of\nhow things have definitely shifted for\nme you're speaking to something huge\nhere right it's like we as people we\nlearn how to not only give love but how\nto receive love\nfrom very significant people really\nearly in our lives childhood\nand those people that are supposed to\nlove us unconditionally keep us safe\nnurture us show us that the world is a\nsafe place have a lot of power over us\nas young children and so what i'm\nhearing is when you were a young child\nsome kind of event or series events\ntaught you that love\nmeans\nsomething\nyou know specific right\nso\ni'm curious in your therapy experience\nhow much did you go back and talk about\nyour childhood in that time\nwhen i went to therapy\nwe did go\nwell you kind of have to understand why\nyou feel this way and it does stem from\nyour childhood everything\nso we we really did start from there and\nwe broke it down from there\nit really does\nhelp\nyou you start to realize\nwhat how you're acting in the presence\nis\nit stems from that we reenact we try to\ncorrect what happened to us as kids in\nour adult relationships and\ni think we all try to the best of our\nability but to try to correct something\nthat happened to us when we're six we\ndidn't we didn't know any better you\nknow trying to make this six-year-old\nyou know be smarter you should have\nknown better which we tell ourselves all\nthe time\nit sounds like you learn to have\ncompassion for\nthe small child inside of you yes 100\nlike even to this day\ni'm 27 years old and i still to say i\nstill feel like that little girl i feel\nlike it's my duty to protect myself and\nbe that person little ashley needed when\nshe was younger you really do feel like\nit's your fault like or you should have\ndone this differently or should have\ndone that you blame yourself and you're\nashamed of it\nbut really it's not in your control and\nthe people in your lives\nshould have been the ones protecting you\nyeah shame shame is a very powerful\nthing right it's like\nthere's like a difference between when\nwe feel guilty for doing something bad\nwe recognize that this thing we probably\ncould have made a different choice but\nshame was like adding some\nreally painful and uncomfortable stuff\non top of that i did this bad thing\nbecause i'm a bad person or this bad\nthing happened to me and i deserved it\nbecause i'm a bad person\nlike in therapy do you feel like you can\nremember some kind of shift in\nthat sense of shame like something that\nreleased you from feeling like all this\nstuff happened to me because i'm bad\nwhat about this process what about\ntalking about yourself and your life\nhelped you start to shift this idea away\nfrom being a bad person because i'm\nhearing you say that you are a good\nperson\nwhen did that change like how does that\nchange\nthere's not one moment where it just\nshifts it truly is happens over time and\nwithin my time of therapy the two years\nof course i relationships jobs real life\nsituations are happening\nand when i'm acting on them and i feel\nlike oh\nthis is happening to me i deserve it\nanyways i'm a piece of crap you know\nwhat i mean like\nand so you would accept that for\nyourself\nbut over time you realize like wait a\nminute like i don't deserve that at all\nit shouldn't be happened to me you\nshouldn't accept that and once you\ncreate those boundaries for yourself and\npractice it it does get better you know\na lot of people wonder like why do we go\nto therapy every week what is it about\nthis cadence of whatever and it's like\nwhy don't we go every day if i'm trying\nto solve this huge problem that's been\npart of my life for such a long time and\nreally your life your healing is what\nhappens outside of therapy it's just one\nhour a week\nmost of the time it's like you can't\nexpect this one hour of week talking to\nsomeone on the couch or whatever to to\nfix everything it's talking about some\nstuff learning some things identifying\nfeelings and behaviors that you could\ntry to start working on in a different\nway and it's in your real life outside\nof the session that this transformation\nis really happening for some people\nvery gradually and over a long period of\ntime you mentioned you're 27 that's like\nyou know potentially 25 years of\nlearning how to be in a particular space\nin a body and\nit's going to take time to like unlearn\nrelearn\nand start seeing the world in a way that\nis safe right so\nwhat would you say like\nif you had not gone to therapy\nyou know where where would we be where\nwould you be oh my goodness like if i\nnever went to therapy\ni would not be the person that i am\ntoday nor be the person that i'm\nbecoming\nmy self-awareness has grown so\nmuch and i'm able to take care of myself\nmore mentally i'm able to\nvalue my thoughts more or just like\nagain if i'm negative i recognize it\nreal quick and i try to change it into\nsomething more enlightening and more\nactually true\ni go from false to true you know people\ncome to therapy and over time after\nwhat's called the assessment period\nwhere your therapist is getting to know\nyou and asking you about your family\nhistory and like all your school stuff\nand everything you remember from your\nfamily childhoods whatever once you move\npast this initial period where you're\nbuilding this relationship\nyou start thinking about goals what are\nthe goals that i want to work on and so\nyou and your therapist like agree on\nthese\nusually two or three major things that\nyou want to achieve\nthrough this process\nand usually you're looking for something\ncalled smart goals people talk about\nthis all the time you want to be\nspecific measurable what's not always\nexplicitly stated as a goal is increased\nself-awareness but i think that's always\ngoing to be an outcome at least i think\nmost therapists are hoping that that's\nan outcome for their clients so i'm\nreally glad that you are able to even\nidentify that that's something that's\nshifted for you is self-awareness yes\nhonestly without my self-awareness i\nthink i would be so lost because i do\nbelieve self-awareness is the first step\nlike you have to even recognize\nwhat you're doing or how you're behaving\nor what you're thinking about yourself\nthat's where it's starting like from\nrecognizing it so if you don't recognize\nit you really can't\nmove forward or even try to get better\nyou were talking about the assessments\nright and so maybe like every six months\nwe would review\nand when i was feeling better you know\ni'm doing better\nwe're reviewing from six months ago\nand it was so\nsad i was i was my heart was breaking\nfor six months ago actually\nand\nshe was saying she was saying i'm\nreferring to her as another honestly\nthat's how i feel like i feel like a new\nperson like honestly but she was just\nreferring to her like a self like\nunworthy i'll never get better it's like\nit was very very dark thoughts\nand i was so sad for i'm like oh my god\ni'm like that was me are you sure you're\non the right assessment like how i said\nthese things and yeah it's true it was\nlike it was a transformation and\nto reflect back on all of those and like\nhow i was feeling where i am today\num it was a good feeling because i\nwasn't feeling that way any longer yeah\nwhat you said is like exciting to me\nbecause you're describing\nthis very powerful component of not just\ntherapy but just like tracking\ntracking your thoughts tracking your\nmoods your behaviors\nthis is like why a lot of people choose\nto journal they like to look back and\nsee how far they've come like if you\nnever wrote down or put somewhere where\nyou could remember where you were\nit's very very hard to identify how much\nbetter you've become how much better\nyou're feeling so in therapy it's a\nreally like\nspecific\nintentional place to be able to have\nsomeone else doing that with you\ntracking stuff bringing your attention\nback to like remember what you said last\ntime because that doesn't really fit\nwith what you're saying today i'm\nhearing that you had a great therapist\nreally it's like somebody that's great\nyeah is with you in this moment but also\ntaking you back to relevant moments in\nthe past to make connections\nthis is what helps people\ngain better self-awareness because\nself-aware people think about themselves\nin every chapter and season of their\nlives try to relate the past to the\npresent and how that's going to affect\ntheir future and really somebody that's\nnot self-aware is going to be really\nhard for them to practice empathy to be\na ability to feel for another\nso\ncan you say anything about like your\nexperience with empathy and whether\nyou've noticed like a shift with that\nwith your improved self-awareness yeah\nso i always considered myself an\nempathetic person\neven before then\nbut there would be times where i'd feel\nlike a robot like almost incapable of\nfeeling sorry for somebody\ni like just\ni feel like i feel bad so i'm like i\nfeel like i should\nfeel something towards them but i don't\nand i i really do i think that helped me\nlater on down the line to be more\nempathetic 100\nthat's like a big life thing it's like i\nthink we're all hardwired to connect to\nwant to be with other people to have\nintimacy with folks that are important\nto us and how can you do that if you\ndon't even know who you are yes 100\nwhen you're really not sure of\nwho you are\ni'm i mean i don't know who i am i'm\nstill growing you know but at that time\nwhen you you're just kind of like i\nwould describe myself as a loose cannon\nyou know what i mean like i couldn't\nprocess any type of emotions or receive\nlove like i didn't know what that looked\nlike i didn't know how to accept it nor\nlike return it it really affected how i\ndealt with relationships friendships\ncareers\njust because i didn't even know\nhow certain emotions or certain\nsituations\nwould look like\ni didn't know what was normal we have\nthese wounds inside right that i think a\nlot of us want to heal we attempt to\nheal them in so many different ways\nwhether it's substance that helps numb\nthese wounds a little bit\nor\nregular sexual behaviors where we're\ntrying to connect where we're chasing\nintimacy but it's still a little bit\ndifferent\nor you know burying ourselves in work\nlike all this stuff that we're trying to\ndo to feel normal like you say what i'm\nhearing is like a larger acceptance of\njust you as you are that you don't have\nto perform that you don't have to be\nlike a specific model of someone in\norder to be worthy of anything you\nreally accomplished a lot thank you what\nwould you say were your initial goals\ni mean you know\npast the point of like being forced into\ntherapy when did it become a choice to\nyou know be times where i i would look\nforward to therapy\nand things will happen throughout the\nweek\nand i go to their i used to go to\ntherapy once a week\ni would leave the room the house and\ni'll just be like my therapist is gonna\nget an earful today like i couldn't wait\nto share what i was going through with\nmy therapist like someone who understand\nwasn't judging me someone who can break\nit down for me and that was really\nrefreshing because i didn't i didn't i\nstill don't really have that support\nsystem family-wise so having that one\nperson\nin my life that i can trust and turn to\nit was amazing\nsomebody that's\nlistening to you to respond to you about\nyou you mentioned like i don't have this\nin my family and like even people with\nvery loving very caring very\nwell-meaning families\nstill don't really always have that with\nfamily because those good intentions\nalso come with their own baggage and\ntheir own feelings and their own agendas\nof what they want between them and you\nto somebody to break it down just hear\nyou out\nhelp you help mirror stuff right like\ntherapists say like we we're just here\nto hold up a mirror right to help you\nsee\nsee yourself a little bit better\nbecause we all go through trauma that\nthat makes it very difficult for us to\nlike see past\nall this stuff that we build up to\nprotect ourselves from future traumas in\ntherapy\nthe therapist asks you a lot of\nquestions what's your sense of like what\nthese questions are for why do we ask so\nmany questions or why do you think that\nwe ask so many questions in the\nbeginning obviously i'm just like nosy\nokay like\nwhat i was like geez my social security\nbut really\nit's come to find out like again holding\nthe mirror up it's really reflection\nlike who you are as a person how did you\nbecome this person why are you acting\nthis way so every question there is\nreally intention behind it it's not just\nsome aimless question like trying to be\nnosy you know like they're not judging\nyou\nso i feel like every single question\nfrom my therapist you know there was she\nwas just looking out for me and\nwanted to help me\nbecome more aware of\nwhy i was behaving a certain way or\nacting or thinking a certain way yeah\nall the questions intention i like that\nyou used that because\nyou know sometimes therapists who are\njust people or just people um sometimes\nthose curious questions or how you would\nsay nosy they do pop up here and there\nyeah but it is like a therapist's uh\nkind of duty to refrain from doing that\nlike you might be talking about\nsomething from your life and then you\nmentioned like a restaurant that i've\nbeen to and my initial reaction of\nwanting to talk about and make this\nconnection like oh i've been there and i\ngot this item from the menu like those\nthings\nwe often refrain from that because in\ntherapy it is about you of course it's\ngoing to somewhat be about me because\ni'm a human and we're connecting as to\npeople and my experiences beliefs and\nvalues are going to be present in this\nroom\num but it's very important for\ntherapists not to impose those things\nright or like make you have particular\ngoals or try to get you to think the way\nthat i do\nvery unbiased\nnon-judgmental it was very neutral\nlike you said she didn't try to impose\nher opinions or thoughts\nto in a certain extent with the thoughts\nbut opinions she she never really did\nthat right right the opinion stuff were\nlike we're taught and trained like leave\nthat stuff outside the door go to your\nown therapy so you're really sure of\nwhat your stances on a bunch of stuff\nare so that you don't have to come into\na session and argue with clients about\nit yeah especially in like you know\nheated climates like we have in current\nmodern society\num i can't imagine going to a therapy\nsession and she's telling me no you're\nwrong i'm just like\nwe're having like this debate you know\nwhat i mean it's not like that at all\ni'm very glad you had that because\na personal experience which i think a\nlot of people can relate to is we turn\nto sometimes a best friend\nand you know older family member maybe\nour mom we turn to these people with the\nexpectation\nthat they will be there for us without\njudgment that they'll respond to us in a\nway that's loving and caring and\nnurturing and a lot of times those\nresponses are loving caring and\nnurturing but they're also filled with\nthe judgment\nthe criticisms of you could have done it\nthis way it probably would have been\nbetter if you thought about it this way\nso family very well meaning\nbut also emotionally charged\nalso like entangled into your life and\nthey have their own like\nmotivations things that they're trying\nto accomplish to propel this\nrelationship in\nwhatever direction\nwhen you're in such a vulnerable state\nand you don't know what's going on\nand even though maybe a family member\nhas the great great intentions and\nthey're basically putting their thoughts\nand opinions onto you you're in a really\nvulnerable state and you might take\ntheir advice and it's just\ntotally wrong and totally not the right\ndirection to go so\neven though family members are\nsupportive\ntherapy is definitely\nhighly recommended from my end\nit makes me wonder like what what big\ndifferences you've shared some already\nbut some other differences that you can\nthink of between going to like a really\nclose friend for support versus talking\nto a therapist\nso even just\nwhen i was a teenager\ni turned to my best friend and it's not\nher fault because\nshe's she's not like she didn't she's a\nkid too and i'm like hey i think i'm\nreally depressed and she's like you're\nnot depressed you're just sad he's like\nokay\nand then my ex-boyfriend from around\nthat time i would try to express my\nthoughts and my concerns and he thought\ni was looking for attention and make\nlittle like snickers with his friends\nlike oh my god this girl's crazy you\nknow what i mean like psycho and at this\npoint\nlike you don't even understand yourself\nshe's like oh i am psycho i'm real crazy\nlike i'm gonna show you crazy\nlike you act on that you know because\nthat's what you believe you are\nand my mom\nthat's a different story you know i\ntried telling her i'm like i'm so angry\ni feel this way i'm like i don't\nunderstand why like i think i need help\nand i don't know what was wrong or why\ni'm this way i just knew it wasn't\nnormal\nand\nshe doesn't even lack or she doesn't\neven\nhave the depth to understand such a\nconcept and so\nmaybe she cared for me\nbut she wasn't the ideal person to try\nto go for help\nand so those were my three closest\npeople in my life\nagain it's not my ex-boyfriend's fault\nor my best friend's fault they didn't\nknow any better yeah but as a\nparental figure i definitely needed more\nguidance and more direction and a lot of\npeople don't have that\nand i think that's another thing that's\ndirt like steered me away from wanting\nto receive any more help\njust because of those kind of\nexperiences i'm like wow\num no one understands and no one's gonna\nwant to help me yeah i mean this is what\nhappens when i open up is i met with\nlike rejection or someone withdrawing or\nsomeone's shutting down or someone\ntelling me i'm wrong invalidating my\nexperience saying that i'm not really\nfeeling the thing that i think i'm\nfeeling you feel like you shouldn't be\nfeeling this way like you don't have a\nright to or like you're just looking for\nattention or\npeople have it worse\nyou know like why do you feel that way\nyou you have no right to feel that way\nso\nthat really does affect you and yeah\nhow you\nbetray people\nthere are people out there that have it\nmuch worse than you i think that is like\nsomeone's attempt to help you feel\nbetter because they're like trying to\nminimize the issue that you're bringing\nto them or even your friend like you're\nnot depressed you're just sad i can see\nthat being a 16 year old solid attempt\nat making the situation less scary but\nnot just for you but less scary for her\noh yeah same thing with your\nex-boyfriend like making a joke of this\nthing that you're bringing up that's\nactually really uncomfortable for you a\nlot of people respond that way because\nthey don't know how else to handle it\nthey can't hold space for it because\nthey're not really sure what to do and\nthey start feeling heightened they start\nfeeling emotional themselves and then\ntheir own defense mechanisms start\ncoming out and some people use humor\num which can be very harmful to like the\npeople around them\nyeah and then you know with mom\nit's a lot of moms they really mean well\nbut they are also people and a lot of\nmoms have i mean\nplenty of moms have been to therapy but\ni think a lot of them haven't\nand this thing that you mentioned of\nlike maybe she doesn't have the depth\nit's probably she doesn't have the\ntraining she doesn't have the\nunderstanding to help you\nfeel safe in the feelings that you're\nhaving and also you know our parents\nfirst instinct is like oh my god my\nchild is hurt i have to make them feel\nbetter versus my child is hurt we're\ngonna hold space for that and let them\nknow it's okay to be hurt\nright and that's like a big difference\nbetween parents and a therapist a\ntherapist is not going to try to\nimmediately put a band-aid on it but\nit's like let's like really get in there\nlet's take the band-aid off let's see\nwhat's how bad is this wound like what\nhappened to it like how do you even get\nthe wound you know what i mean oh the\nwound bringing it back i think i forgot\nto close that loop you know we have\nwounds inside and we do all these things\ntrying to heal them\nultimately if you don't heal that stuff\nit will end up like bleeding out on\nother people other people yeah yeah\nyes the gory siblings yeah the glory\nscene of like our emotional blood and\nbaggage just like following us around\neverywhere and it's\nit's contagious you know it's like any\nfeeling is contagious when you're with\nother people and when you're\nnot well\nother people feel that right yeah like i\nimagine\na cloud over me it's just raining you\nknow have my boyfriend here he's getting\nrained on and poured and i feel like it\nwas almost my fault like i brought this\ninto your life like you didn't deserve\nthis i'm just\ni really felt like\ni was bringing people down with me and\nthey didn't need that and that was\nanother thing that led to why i did what\ni did everyone everyone would be better\noff without me so if you don't address\nthe help\nblood's everywhere you know i think\nwe're we're\ntouching on so many stuff that's very\nrelatable to a lot of people and i'm\nhearing you sing praises of how\ntherapy's been helpful like what would\nyou say to someone that's like\nmaybe in a similar headspace to where\nyou were before of thinking like it's\njust not gonna help anytime i've tried\nto open up to somebody it led to\nsomething worse for me\nany pieces of advice to give to someone\nthat's still very skeptical resistant\nfearful of trying this thing number one\ni would say do not tell them\nhow you think they should feel so if you\ntry to tell someone like they're gonna\nautomatically tune you out like you're\nautomatically disqualified like in bad\nlike who are you telling me like\nso\njust listen to them like listen to what\nthey have to say\nand i wouldn't again put your opinions\nor your personal thoughts on it\nfor me personally because i have been\nthrough it\ni would\njust\nbe there with them and\nthis is so powerful to me rather than oh\nyou should do this\ni would say\nwe should go to therapy like let me help\nyou find somebody because i didn't have\nthat support i didn't have someone who's\ngonna hold my hand\nand help me find the help so for me i\nwould i would just hold their hand and\ntry to find somewhere to get them held\nthat they feel comfortable and you're\nlike i'm feeling like emotional because\nthat's what you're doing here right\nyou're like figuratively holding the\nhands now of so many people by sharing\nyour experience and being so open about\nall this stuff that you've been through\nand like you know rehashing a lot of\nyour own thought process from the past\nthat weren't very healthy sometimes\npeople just need permission i don't know\nif that's like from themselves or from\nother people to\ndo something good and do something nice\nfor\nthemselves nice for me and while your\nyour journey to therapy wasn't quite\nlike\ni'm gonna do this for me today\num you know at some point you were\nchoosing to keep going back yeah\nyeah and would you ever do it again\nwould you ever go\nlike i already know i'm gonna go back to\ntherapy not because i'm depressed but\nbecause i just need that extra\nhelping hand you know what i mean i i\ni definitely think i'll need therapy for\nthe rest of my life not because there's\nsomething wrong with me or like i'm\nsuicidal again or something like that\njust because it really is helpful\nwhat's helpful about it\nit really helps you\nunderstand\nwhy you feel\na certain way about a\ncertain situation and i know as i get\nolder\nmaybe marriage or kids i'll have those\nconflicts of like i'm letting my child\ndown i can't provide for them and you\nknow\nthat would probably stem from how i feel\ncertain times today or how i can't\nprovide for myself\nand i know that probably will not be the\ncase as i get older\nbut\ni'm sure therapy will\nhelp me understand that\nso it's helpful for navigating life\nevery day challenges right like we're\nall posed with a thousand decisions to\nmake per day and most of the time we're\nmaking those decisions largely on our\nown\nand that's a interesting thing about\ntherapy it's not that your therapist is\nmaking further decisions for you but\nhelping you identify what decisions like\nlie in there already like you already\nknow the answers and the truth to what\nlife is\nwe all know that for ourselves somewhere\ndeep inside and i think therapy really\nhelps us like unlock\nthis stuff that\nwe've pushed down\nyou know things like not having\nconfidence or not believing in ourselves\nto make the right choices or not feeling\nworthy not feeling adequate it really\nmakes it hard to listen to ourselves and\nto hear\nthose deep down truths that already\nexist\nyeah like you don't believe the truth at\nall\nlike you could look in the mirror and be\nlike you're so ugly like i'll stay lost\nlike you're not ugly you know what i\nmean but\nall truths are out the window and like\nyou don't even value your opinions when\nyou're dealing with like mental health\nissues\nyeah\nso you mentioned you've experienced a\ndepression\nwhich does sometimes include feeling sad\nbut like what how did depression\nmanifest in your life like what made you\nfeel like this is the word i'm gonna use\nto describe how i'm feeling to other\npeople for somebody listening to this\nconversation like that might be feeling\ndepressed themselves but they don't have\nthe words to articulate that yet like\nwhat would you clue them into like how\ndo you know that you're depressed for me\ni was\nvery very angry the moment i woke up i\njust filled with so much rage and it'd\nbe to the point where i just want to cry\nthat's how like angry i was\nand obviously you're being suicidal i\ndon't want to live\nthat's not normal like i just want to\nend my life and you're sitting there\nhave a pros and cons list trying to\nthink out like okay like why should i\nnot do it like that's not normal\nand\njust constantly feeling\nworthless like not feeling like you\ndeserve to live\nthese i knew were not normal\ni felt that way\nlike as a young child just it started\nwith the anger that's why i can tell you\nas i started with anger\nand that's insight because if you ask a\ntherapist how does depression manifest\nin youth in small children and anger is\nactually something that someone needs to\nassess for\num temper tantrums\nthis like really disregulated\nway of being if you're waking up really\npissed off every day that's not normal\nyeah and i definitely encourage parents\nbecause i see it a lot like if a child\ndoes act i don't ever all children act\nout but if it's like a constant pattern\nand you're punishing them i think that's\nlike the worst i'm like no take a take a\nmoment listen to your child try to have\na conversation and understand why are\nthey feeling this way\nand\nyou'd you'd probably learn a lot about\nyour child and realize punishing them\nsitting through the room making it worse\nessentially is not the way to go but\ngetting help it's probably the parent\nneeds help too you know it's a\nit's a\npartnership between the child and the\nparent\nyeah\nsome education around just emotions\nhow they creep up like what they look\nlike in kids i mean small kids\nespecially like\ntheir primary language is not english or\nwhatever language it is where they're\ngrowing up it's play they they\nunderstand the world through how they\nplay how they engage in a very active\nway outside of just like verbal\ncommunication so yes like paying\nattention to kids mood so you paying\nattention to your own mood and\nrecognizing something's not normal yeah\nand if i like my mom was more\naware and more educated about something\nlike that\ni probably wouldn't\nhave\ngrew up the way i did in certain ways\nand plenty of parents they mean well\nthey really tried their best um\nit speaks to like the importance of\neducation around emotional intelligence\nand\nmaybe incorporating a little bit more\ninto like standard curriculums at school\nhow to just like tune into your feelings\nhow your feelings affect your everyday\nlife\ni imagine many of us could have\nbenefited if our moms are a little bit\nmore aware about all this stuff\nyeah i don't mean to laugh but some\npeople are really they really are\nclueless i should say and i really think\nit's very helpful to start with children\nor even teenagers i think that's really\nwhere it begins because that's where you\nstart to become programmed to be a\ncertain way\nand you're going to love your parents\nhouse and you're going to live live your\nlife but yet you're still acting a\ncertain way and like you don't even\nrealize it's coming from your childhood\nlike you just think you're some like\nadult with an anger problem or you're\njust like super depressed like you don't\neven know why and that will carry on\nwith you if you don't\nrecognize that you have you have a\nmental health problem\ntherapy helped you\nin in those ways of recognition and\nyou know connecting the dots between\nwhat happens in childhood and how you're\nrelating to other people now\nthank you ashley for\nopening up so much and\nsharing about your journey\nit's really um\nyou know just sitting and listening to\nyou both\nhave a discussion\nabout the journey you've been on\nalso hearing you open up about your\nfeelings as someone who's in the room\nobserving\nit's actually really quite remarkable\nwhen you get to\njust be patient and listen to someone\nreflect on their own emotions\nbecause it encourages you to do the same\nfor yourself\nand so i know that you know to\nthe hundreds of thousands of people\nmillions of people that would listen to\nthis afterwards\ni'm hoping that everyone who's listening\nand watching is also\nthinking about the questions that jesus\nis asking thinking about the\nideas that you're mentioning and\nare gaining that self-awareness and that\nregulation of their emotions and the\nunderstanding of themselves\nbecause it's strange to sit in on a\nconversation i think\nmost of the time we spend our time in\nconversations thinking what am i going\nto say\nyeah like oh what should i say back to\nthat person\nand obviously as we see with jesus what\nshe's doing is\nshe's trying not to project\nher own feelings\nso that she can truly listen to you and\nthen i've just been silent for the last\nnearly 40 minutes\n45 minutes\nand that's actually a really powerful\npractice true because\nnow you're not sitting there thinking\nwhat should i say or how do i sound or\noh i can relate or not relate or judging\nbut i can just observe\nand so i think this has been a really\npowerful practice even for me to just\nsit and listen and sit in here i think\nit's just been a healthy\nconversation to\nhave a discussion about\nyou know the benefits you've seen and\nthe growth you've seen and i think\nthat's a great\nstarting point for this series and just\nunderstanding the benefits of therapy\nand someone who's you know committed to\ntwo years two years right someone who's\ncommitted to two years of therapy and\nand the benefits they've seen so i'm\nvery happy with the fact that everyone\nwho's been listening and watching has\nhad the opportunity to\nsit in on a conversation with a\ntherapist\nand and see how where some of the\nquestioning can go\nand and also to sit with someone who has\ndone therapy\nwho is able to articulate and explain\ntheir experiences\nyou know clearly yeah and concisely i\nknow there's a lot of people\nwho are like me i don't have a family to\nturn to or at the time many friends i\ndidn't have a huge support system so i\nreally truly felt\nvery very alone so to take those steps\nit takes a lot of courage and i hope\npeople listening\nreally take away like even though i am i\nam alone like i don't have that support\nsystem there's still hope for me like\ni'm still worthy and i hope i really\nreally really really hope\nthat\nthey do their research and really find\nsomeone that they connect with and i do\nnot want them to just get discouraged if\nthey get a therapist and there's\nthey're not connecting because not every\ntherapist is going to be for you and i\nthink it's very very important to find\nthe one that that is for you\nand\ni really just hope people who are\nlistening\nreally really really really do receive\nthe help that they need because there's\nnothing wrong or negative about therapy\nwhatsoever\nit truly is life changing and i do not\nregret it at all i know i'm gonna do it\nagain\nand i'm so grateful for my therapist\nwhen we were like we were on the phone\nduring the co-vid times and we were like\nsaying our goodbyes you know she's like\ni'm so proud of you ashley like you\nreally have come so far and i i just\nstarted crying because she really was\nalmost like that mother figure that i\nnever really had and like someone who\ntruly cared about me and\nwanted better for me\nyeah you're describing so many like\npinnacles of things that therapists\nlearn about in grad school like\nyou know psychologists love to label\nlabel human behaviors with all kinds of\nwords and stuff but like\nthe therapist\nbecoming like a mother figure to you\nthat's that happens a lot right it's\nwhat we call like a corrective emotional\nexperience\nthis person that is\nvalidating of you that can listen to you\nnurture you kind of show you\nwhat\ngentle love and acceptance looks like\nand feels like in a really controlled\nsafe setting\nand it's not that like you know\ntherapists are not set out to like\nbecome your new family\nbut i think experiences that come\nthrough sessions\ncan help someone recognize like i can\ncreate my own family whatever that means\nto me like the stuff that i feel like is\nsupposed to come from family which is\nlove acceptance support\ni can provide that to myself and i can\nlearn how to do that yes with this other\nperson that can model for me because\nunfortunately my mom didn't or you know\nwhatever it is\nthank you both so much for\nhelping us sit in on that conversation\nand to observe and learn and listen and\ni'm just really grateful for both of\nyour honesty and transparency and\nas if we're guiding this conversation\nand you know thank you
