    "transcript": "like i was shushed so much in in my\ntoxic relationship where it was like a\nphysical like or like hand on mouth and\ni'm just like when you're asked to be\nquieted and quiet who you are\nit takes away your identity one of the\nthings you talk about is past\nrelationships\ntoxic relationships\nperhaps uh difficult decisions in\nrelationships\nand and i wanted you to talk us through\nhow you were still able to\nfind so much meaning or lessons in those\nor how actually you don't see them as\njust bad decisions but you were able to\nlearn from them because i think that's\nsomething that we all need to do yeah\nyou know i don't know i've always been\nsuch an introspective\nreflective person um i've always tried\nto see the good even in the bad um i'm\nalways slightly more optimistic than i\nam pessimistic\nand for me i was very young when i\nexperienced um\nthe my relationship that was emotionally\nabusive um and at times i didn't see it\nas that in the moment um and then at\ntimes i did know that certain things\nweren't right but i was so far in and i\ndidn't know how to get out of it in a\nsense you know um\ni felt very small i felt very quieted i\nfelt um\nbelittled but at the same time it was\nkind of what i knew in that relationship\nand it was something that\npart of me was like but\nbut he does love me and there are these\nelements of of kindness at moments and\nand it's just\ni\ni would never say that i was weak\nbecause i've never been like a weak\nperson i think there were moments when i\ndidn't know how to voice myself in the\nstrongest loudest way because even in\nmoments when i tried to voice myself i i\nwas\nshushed\nand so i was you know i was called names\ni was\ni was told not to have an opinion on\nthings i was\njust\nvery much felt\nuh a lesser version of myself and i can\nsay all that now looking back on it as a\nstronger person because of it and it's\nit's something that took a lot i mean my\nfriends and family definitely played a\npart in vocalizing their thoughts and\nintervening in a sense um\nbut you know it's interesting looking\nback on it and even at the time i i\nalways look at present situations as\nones\nto\nwork on in terms of what am i learning\nfrom this at the time like\nit's going to define how i get through\nthis just as much as it's going to\ndefine me as to what happens in the end\nand it's it's about the journey which\nyou talk about all the time and for me\nthe lessons i learned in how i don't\nwant to be treated what i don't want\nfrom a partner\nhow can i become stronger\nalso just the idea of\nnot\nshaming myself for not leaving earlier\num\nbecause i think that if we if we only\nlooked back on experiences with the\nshame and the regret and the fear and\nall that then we don't allow ourselves\nto embrace any uh learning through what\nwe would have gone through and i think\nit's it's in anything difficult that we\ngo through if if we just\nlived in the shame of embarrassment of\nnot knowing how to act or you know i\ncan't believe i didn't know more about\nthis subject if if we if we let that\ncloud our judgment\nwe prevent ourselves from learning more\nand growing through it so i tried my\nbest to kind of keep an open mind even\nwhen it was the hardest because i knew\nthat there would be a more positive\noutcome in the end\nultimately i knew this person wasn't the\nperson for me and um i just needed to\nfind a way\nto get through it that felt right and\ngenuine to me and also that i\ncould kind of leave it clean um and know\nthat i did everything i could and not\nblame myself so i i'm i'm actually\ngrateful for the experiences that i had\nwithin myself i'm not saying that i'm\ngrateful for how i was treated because i\nwish that there were moments i had never\nexperienced but i am grateful for the\nmoments that i sat within my own head\nand my own heart and said enough is\nenough because at those moments i felt\nlike i was defining how i moved forward\nand i was defining the future that i was\nsetting for myself and now i know\nthat there are certain\nways in which a person acts that i will\njust never tolerate that no one should\ntolerate and that's not just in romantic\nyou know relationships that's in work\nenvironments that's in just everyday\nliving that's with friends and it just\nit really did teach me so much and i\njust i would encourage\nanyone\nthat has gone through something like\nthat or is going through something like\nthat to not allow the embarrassment or\nshame that you may feel prevent you from\nknowing deep within yourself what you\nneed to do and to prevent you from um\nmoving forward and being able to speak\nabout it openly because i think there is\na big fear in um\nin\nnot vocalizing oneself so i think that\nthat for me has really helped me raise\nthe volume on my voice wow i mean\ni mean it just you know when when i'm\nhearing it and obviously it sounds like\nyou've done so much introspection as you\nsaid and so much self-reflection but\ntell us about how at that time that\naffected your self-esteem\nbecause you talk a lot about that in the\nbook too it's just like how does that\naffect your self-esteem and how did you\nrebuild or realign with the courage to\nmake that decision\nto move away from that relationship\nbecause i feel so many people and you\ncan probably attest to the people that\nyou've shared this with so many people\nfeel stuck yeah and so many people feel\nthat that one moment of love or\naffection from that person\nbecause it's so rare yeah it kind of\njust over amplifies about all the\nmistakes yeah i mean it was it was kind\nof that like carrot that would be\ndangled and and i would be waiting for a\nmoment of of light but the second i saw\nit i took it almost as all the lights\nwere on instead of like\nyou know one bulb it's like that moment\nto me was\noh okay it's still there and it's gonna\ncause me to just forget everything else\nand i think i i put so much of my\nself-worth and my self-esteem in that\nperson and in\nthat person's attention to me um i found\nthat i was losing touch with a lot of my\nfriends i mean it also was that he\ndiscouraged a lot of those relationships\num\nand even the relationship that i had\nwith certain family it's like it was\nvery much\nhim and that was it um and so i i did\nfeel that so much of myself was then\nwrapped up in that\nthat what did that mean if i no longer\nhad that like who was i\nhow would i make decisions um would i\nfind someone else and and what was that\ngonna look like for me and that's scary\nespecially as someone you know when\nyou're young and you're kind of just\nfiguring out who you are\nyou're just figuring out what you want\nin a partner or who you are as a person\nlike i don't think you can be\nthe best version of a partner whether\nthat's again romantically friendship\nwork anything until you you know more of\nwho you are and when you're young you're\nfiguring that out and when there's\nsomeone that then takes advantage of\nthat\nyou know that journey and that\nself-discovery in a way to kind of make\nit work for them like i just got sucked\ninto that and it was really difficult i\nremember um i\nlike i've never ever had like bad skin\nand all of a sudden i was i was breaking\nout i had never had panic attacks i was\nhaving panic attacks there was a night i\nremember where\num there we had gotten into a\ndisagreement on the phone and i was on\nthe floor crying like\nhardly able to breathe like i'd never\nhad those experiences before my body was\nwas showing me signs i it was giving up\nin a lot of ways um\nand i just i listened to it and then i\nwould kind of forget you know um and at\nthe end of the day\nthere was just kind of a light bulb\nmoment when certain people intervened\nand had a conversation with me that i\nrealized\num\nwow\nthat quote of when someone shows you who\nthey are believe them\ni had been trying to justify\nyeah but but like but he's saying this\nand it's like right but the\nfollow-through is never the same or yeah\nyou got those texts of those emails\nbut look at what you're feeling like and\nthat's not right that's not real um and\nso i i finally was able to put that into\npractice and\nkind of\nrise above what i thought i was capable\nof and it was hard it was definitely not\neasy i mean\nthere were moments when i thought i i'm\ngonna have to start from zero i don't\nreally know where to go because i've\nalienated some friends\nwill they start talking to me again\nyou know now i'm embarrassed because\ni've basically said no everything's fine\nfor so long but nothing it wasn't fine\nyou know and now i'm having to kind of\nrebuild relationships and i'm so\nfortunate that\nthe people that i had stopped really\ntalking to\nembraced me right back they saw what i\nwas going through and they knew\nultimately that i would find that within\nmyself to kind of move through it but\ni'm forever grateful to this day to them\nbecause now we can look back on it and\nsay god remember when that happened and\nlike\nby no means make light of it but to show\nthe growth through what i had gone\nthrough and they just they stuck by me\nand i was so i'm i'm so grateful for\nthat and then i have to say another\nversion of healing was then writing\nabout it because\ni never\ni never really spoke about it to people\nthat didn't know what i was going\nthrough because it didn't feel\nappropriate and it didn't feel like i\nneeded to\nbut when i was writing the book i\nthought\nthis is something that truly shaped\nso much of my\nyoung adult life\nin terms of then trying to find a\npartner and how i felt about myself and\nmy self-esteem\nthat\ni i wanted to share it because it felt\nlike another way to connect to people\nthat\nhad gone through that or were going\nthrough that at a young age because\nyou don't see out of it when you're that\nyoung and also when you have parents or\npeople that are older than you telling\nyou it's not good for you\nyou're kind of less apt to believe it\nright because you're like you don't know\nwhat are you talking about and it's like\nbut when you're talking to someone your\nage or someone that's younger and you\ncan relate to\nfor me at least it made a huge\ndifference whenever i'd have\nconversations with people like that and\nand so\nit was a way to to try and\nmake other people feel less alone\num and\nand i truly just i would i then feel\nless alone when people share their\nstories with me yeah and that's why i\nwant to thank you for sharing your story\nbecause\ni feel so many people are going to be\nhelped by this like listening to you\nspeak i'm hoping that everyone who's\nlistening and watching right now is is\nreflecting on their own relationships\npast or present yeah and just getting a\nchance to just\nthe way you share it is so\ngraceful in the sense that it really\nhelps people just be guided through it\nin their own life and just like okay is\nthat what i'm experiencing is that what\ni'm seeing tell us about how\nwhat you experienced\nin toxic relationships\nis different from what you've been able\nto create today which is a real\nrelationship yeah which means it doesn't\nit's not that it doesn't have challenges\nand it's not that it doesn't have\nuh things that you have to work out and\nfigure out but tell me what's different\nand and how people can try and spot the\nright things because i think often we\neither see things as toxic yeah or like\nthe movies yeah and but it's like what\nyou know what you have and i know what i\nhave with my wife today is very real\nyeah and it's neither of those right no\nyou know it's it's interesting because\nwe're always going to have ups and downs\nin whatever relationship you're in again\nwork\num friendships or romantic and for me\nthe ups and downs of my toxic\nrelationship were my body was reacting i\nwas physically ill and i\ni had such anxiety and\nthere was there was nothing about me\nthat felt big like i i've truly felt\nlike the smallest version of myself and\ni didn't even realize how small until\nwhen i got out of it i found\nthat so many things in my life started\nto just grow so much bigger like my\nlight came back my energy came back um\nevery like different facets in my life\nstarted to grow again and\ni think that\nthere's just no doubt in my mind\nwhen\ni'm with my fiance and there are ups and\ndowns it's like we got this together\nthere's no\ncompetition there's no\num\nthere's just no negativity\nat all it's very much\nokay how are we going to get through\nthis what's going on let's have a\nconversation there's no shushing like i\nwas shushed so much in in my\ntoxic relationship where it was like a\nphysical like\nor like hand on mouth and i'm just like\nwhat it's it's when you're asked to be\nquieted and quiet who you are\nit takes away your identity like and i\nthink i went through a bit of a thing\nyou know when in my early 20s where i\nwas like okay then what is my identity\nlike if i've been told to be quiet so\nmuch\ni is being loud a bad thing and what\ndoes that mean to be the biggest version\nof yourself and to be with someone now\nwho\nis so encouraging of me being bigger you\nknow it's like no be the biggest version\nof yourself you can be all these things\nand you know what we can have\ndisagreements and let's have a\nconversation you know and it's like if\nyou disagree about something and you\nhave a conversation and yet you still\nfeel heard\nthat's the biggest thing it's like\nwhen you're talking and you can see\nsomeone's like physically listening but\nthey're not hearing you\nyou know it you know what i mean like\nyou know the difference and you're like\nyeah but you're not hearing inside\nyou're not understanding what i'm saying\nand the intention and\nthe deepest place that it's coming from\nand\ni'll say that when i was going through\nthis toxic experience i truly\ni was like yeah but he's saying\nthat he loves me and he's telling me no\none's ever going to love you the same\nthat i love you and no one's going to be\nable to do this for you and you know\nlike all the all these things that you\nweirdly like want to hear you want to\nhear someone saying like oh you know i\nlove you so much and no one's gonna love\nyou the same way and i can do this for\nyou and i'm your biggest champion and\nblah\nbut it's like it's being used against\nyou it's a tool it's a red flag it's a\ntool to draw you in and and kind of\nusing things against you and imprison\nyou and feel really\nuh trapped\nand when you feel trapped by someone\nthat is is supposedly your biggest\nchampion\nthat's a problem you know and i think to\nbe to be told to be quiet\num is a really\nscary thing because you know\nwhat you want to say and why you want to\nsay it but when someone that you love\ntells you to be quiet\nyou listen i or i listened you know and\nit and it has created\nthis\npost-traumatic\nstress in me\nat times within any relationship since\nthat day and i still have moments where\ni deal with it and have to i have to\ncheck myself i just have to remember in\nthose moments that i'm having\nlike okay why is my heart starting to\nrace why am i feeling anxious what is\nthis reminding me of what do i need to\nthink through myself what is it that i'm\nprojecting like i have found so many\ntimes that if a situation arises that\nmakes me feel anxious\ni know that i'm projecting what that\nperson would have said to me in this\nspecific moment what he would have done\nwhat he would have said what he would\nhave like you know um commented on how\nhe would have shushed me and so i need\nto remember that that's gone that's done\nbut i'm still dealing with moments like\nthat and you know thank god for\npodcasts and reading and therapy and all\nthose things because i think it's really\nimportant to stop in those moments and\ninternalize and think to myself\nthis has nothing to do with\nright now nothing there's nothing in the\nsituation that's the same there's no\nresponse that's the same from the other\nperson there's this conversation hasn't\neven happened before but i'm i'm still\ndealing with how that person treated me\nand and it takes a while um and it's\nsomething though that i will say\nin those moments when you catch yourself\nsometimes they're embarrassing because\nyou realize that you're falling back\ninto\nwhat that person was doing to you but\nbut it ultimately is a huge lesson and\nit's i'm so grateful to be with someone\nwho nurtures me through those and\ndoesn't judge me for them and says\ni'm here\ni want to help you let's talk this\nthrough you're going to be fine and i\nlove you and that is like guys it's out\nthere because i was like is it never\ngoing to be out there and and there\nthere is that hope\nyeah and and i'm so happy that\nyou had the courage to\nstand up for yourself and your voice and\nbecause otherwise we wouldn't you know i\nknow we wouldn't have this beaming like\nwonderful individual like that gets to\nshine and the truth is that everyone is\nthat and everyone has that opportunity\nand potential inside of them to be the\nbiggest version of themselves as you\nwere saying exactly but it's so easy to\njust be made small and like you said\nit's not just romantic relationships it\ncan be parenting it can be yeah work it\ncan be family yeah so thank you for\nfor living that and for sharing that and\nfor being so open about it because i\nthink that\ni know that a lot of our community is\ngoing to be listening to this today and\njust thinking wow lily thank you for\nbeing so brave because that's where i am\nright now you know and i think it's also\nimportant because and i was inspired by\na lot of\nmy book really came from me reading\npeople's stories on social media\nyoung girls and boys around the world\nwould message me with insecurities and\nthings that they had gone through\nthat they wanted to relate to me on but\nthey assumed because i was in a position\nthat i'm in you know in this industry\nthat i would have no way to relate to\nthem whereas in fact i would read their\nstories see their photo next to it so\nit's not anonymous it's super brave and\nall i wanted to do was reach out and go\nyou have no idea you have no idea how\nmuch i can relate to you and it was\ntheir bravery that inspired me to truly\nwant to share my story and i think it's\nso important to just say you know just\nbecause i'm in the industry that i'm in\nand i'm in the position that i'm in and\ni\nam the way that i am like doesn't mean\nthat i'm immune to any of these things\nit's like we all go through these and\ni just wanted to share that in order to\ntry to squash those myths that some\npeople are infallible like no one's\ninfallible no one you know and no one i\nmean i i'm so glad that you're making\nthat point because\nthere's also the other side i think\nthere's one side of like oh that person\nhas it all figured out or it's perfect\nand then the other side is almost like\num\nwell well that person has so much\nmaterial stuff that this stuff doesn't\naffect them yeah so it's kind of like a\nbit of both like when you think oh well\nthat person has so much money so they're\nnot upset by these kind of comments\nright or they're not upset by these\nthings yeah this person has so much fame\nor whatever it may be and the truth is\nnone of that's true like no matter how\nmuch money you have or followers you\nhave or\nwe're all humans and we all experience\nemotions\nand we all can be made to feel small or\ntiny or insignificant by anyone in our\nlives yeah exactly and it doesn't it's\nnot affected that way so anyone who\nhasn't already um who would love to\nlearn more about lily's journey and\neverything inside of it whether it's you\nknow lily talks about mental health\ntalks about eating disorders that she's\ngone through and i just really feel that\nif you're someone right now who's\nworking through a lot of your\nself-confidence self-esteem then um the\nbook's gonna be a great\nalmost\nsupport and friend for you to guide you\nthrough that you know and it's it's\nreally in a friendly tone and\nand and i think we can all use a a good\nfriend uh sometimes in that way to guide\nyou through\nso\ni i read this uh that you said this and\nit's just\nit was really new for me i'd never heard\nanyone say it before so you said that\nyou referred to acting as a form of\nmeditation yeah\nto sit in stillness if only for a moment\nand that was so beautiful to me because\ni can totally understand how acting is a\nmeditation but to hear you say that and\nyour journey tell us a bit about how\nyour acting journey started\nand what your intention was and what\nyour purpose was when you first got\ninvolved and then how that evolved to it\nbeing that it's super interesting\nbecause i know you're all about\nmeditation and that's how we met um and\ni\nit's funny because i\nwasn't fully versed in meditation for a\nlong time um i've obviously heard about\nit i've read about it and i didn't know\nwhat it meant for me i'm someone who has\n10 million things going on in my head my\nfriends say it must be exhausting being\nme sometimes that i didn't know how to\nquiet myself um in order to kind of\nthink reflect and be introspective and\nall that so it is an interesting thing\nto say that then taking on a new\ncharacter helps me do that but um i i\ntruly believe\nas a storyteller you get to take people\non a journey with you to another place\nas a kid my dad used to read stories to\nme before bed and he would make all\nthese different funny accents and voices\nand he'd he'd act out the stories and i\nremember falling asleep to these\ndifferent\nworlds in my head that had stemmed from\na book and i just i remember thinking i\nwant to take people on that journey with\nme i want to be\none of the facilitators in that escapism\nand i loved dressing up i loved i loved\ntelling stories i loved\nbeing different people in order to find\nme\num\ni find that it's very therapeutic\nto uh research a character to find our\nsimilarities and also our differences\nand see\nhow much about myself i can learn\nthrough not only the character but also\nthe experience of filming it um because\nsometimes\nfor me at least the process of filming a\nshow or a movie is almost more important\nthan how many people see it at the end\nbecause i know that this character is\ngoing to teach me a lot about myself\nand it's going to really push me whether\nit's physically push me\nwith the physicality of the role or the\nemotional side of the role\nand so for me\ni really feel like when i have certain\nmoments and they're not all the time\nthere are these rare moments that i\ncherish where\nat the end of a take\nyou can think back\n30 seconds before and go\ni don't even know what i just did i\ndon't know what just happened\ni could never repeat that that moment\nwas this magical moment of\ndeep stillness within me where i was\ncompletely\ncompletely present nothing else mattered\nthe text that i was sending before\ndidn't flash before my eyes tonight's\nlike show of whatever is not in my brain\nyou know\nnobody was on set around me even though\nthere's a crew of like 50. you know you\ntruly\ni have disappeared into that moment and\nsomething came out in me that came from\nthis\nplace of knowing and stillness and to me\ni look for that in meditation i look for\nthese um\nthese little gifts of magic that come\nfrom moments of being so present and i'm\nsomeone who as a kid i was like the\nultimate worrier like i would worry\nthat people weren't having fun i would\nworry that i wasn't doing enough or\nbeing enough being proactive enough and\nso i was so focused on either the past\nor the future am i doing enough did i do\nenough not am i doing enough now in the\nmoment and so anything that i can do to\nfeel more present uh i welcome and\nwhen you're acting uh you have to be in\nthat moment it's it's like what you do\nas well though when you're talking to\nsomeone when you're interviewing when\nyou're a human being who's having a\nconversation if you're focused on\nwhat you just talked about or a question\nyou want to talk about in five minutes\nyou could miss an entirely magical\nmoment\nof wow they're leading me down a path\nthat i'm not even following i'm just\njumping straight to the end you know and\nit's it's it's the same in acting and\nthere are so many moments as an actor\nthat you can pre-plan\nyou can know what you want to do but\nthen if someone throws you a curveball\nthey either forget a line they say a\nline differently they add something or\nthey're just a completely different\nenergy\nit won't make any sense if you don't\nread what they're doing in the moment\nand so for me that's very much\nmeditation it's being\npresent within yourself and and i find\nthat\nacting and my but the craft of acting\nallows me to be more present and it's\nweird because sometimes i'm not even\npresent as lily i'm present as the\ncharacter you know but at the same time\nit's obviously me so i i do find it a\ndeep form of meditation in that way yeah\ni love that that's beautifully described\nand it makes so much sense right and\nit's almost like\nall of us when you're discovering your\npurpose\nmaybe ultimately your purpose is\nsomething that makes you feel present\nyeah like maybe that's what it is it's\nsomething that really makes you feel\nhappy with just being in the moment yeah\ntell us about a role that you think\ntaught you the most about yourself\noffline or off screen oh my god i\nhonestly\none of those kind of\nmeant to be\nmeta\nmoments was when i i was writing my book\nat the same time and i had just written\nmy chapter where i discussed my\nexperiences with eating disorders and a\nweek later i got the script for this\nmovie to the bone where i play a\ncharacter who's suffering with eating\ndisorders and it was a real like aha\nmoment for me um i had goosebumps when i\nwhen i read the script because i went oh\nmy god i just decided to open up\nto myself about this and now to the\nworld in this book and now i'm having\nthis opportunity to explore playing a\ncharacter where it would actually be\nphysically me opening up on screen as\nthis character um and to me i knew that\nthe journey of making that film\nwith marty knox and the director writer\nwho also experienced eating disorders\nand it's partly biobiographical of her\nlife um\nthat i would be nurtured through it in a\nwhole new way and that it would be a\nhealing process for me even though i was\npast that phase of my life i knew i had\nso much\ninsight to give um\nas an actor to the character and\nand insight from experiences i had just\nreread in my journals and then i knew\nthat the story\nthat that my character was going through\nthe shooting of that would inform my\nbook and i thought oh my god this is\nthis is like a meeting of the mind this\nis when your craft\nyour art and life are completely\nmirroring one another and i would it\nwould be foolish not to jump on this\na lot of people\nof course were concerned that that that\nwould be a risk for me yeah\nuncomfortable to revisit it almost\ntotally and i and i and i understood i\nrespected i i really understood their\ntheir concern but i i had again that\ndeep sense of knowing that i channeled\nand tapped into and at that point i was\nso\ncentered within myself talking about my\nexperiences and so um\nlike i had admitted it to myself that\neveryone on set knew\num i wasn't hiding anything about my\nexperiences and therefore not only was i\nkeeping myself accountable but i had all\nthese people that knew all these people\nto keeping me accountable and i was\nnurtured through and it was a real sense\nof healing in a way that i never had had\nbefore um because my my story is\ndissimilar to my characters in a lot of\nways and\nseeking professional opinion for a\ncharacter\nreally helped me let go of things i\nthought i'd already let go of you know\nlike talking to\nprofessors at uh universities about\ncertain bullet points of characteristics\nof um\nof of people that have gone through very\nspecific eating disorders i could go\nback and look at myself and and read\nthings i wrote when i was 16 17 years\nold and go\noh i thought that was unique about me oh\nright okay i understand now that a lot\nof people feel that same way and i use\nit as an excuse to continue suffering\nwhereas i it wasn't an excuse it was\nsomething that was actually if i had\nonly opened up about it sooner i would\nhave realized there were people to talk\nto you know so it was really interesting\nto learn and grow through that and then\nat the end of it you know show the movie\nand and at the same time then say to the\nto the world\ni also went through this and that was i\njust let go of so much at that moment i\nstarted as a blank slate\num i could know i no longer felt that\nwhen i was taking on a role\nthat i was carrying baggage of my own i\ncould drop that at the door and only\ntake on the baggage of my character\nwhich by the way it was like super heavy\nbefore i like could hardly walk um and\nthen all of a sudden i was like oh wow\nlike no one's judging me that was just\nall me judging me you know\nwow there's so much bravery in that\nthough because i feel like\ni always feel like when you step out of\nwhen you've moved away from a state that\nyou were in yeah and then you help\nothers\nconnect with that and help others move\nout of that that's such a healing\nprocess i was wondering if you feel do\nyou feel that\nand and obviously you're so young\nyourself but i mean do you feel that\nyounger\nactresses and talent and music do do you\nfeel like they sometimes come to you and\nask you for insights and advice or share\nor do you feel that it's so hard for\npeople to share with people in the same\nspace because i just feel like what\nyou're sharing could be so helpful i\nhear about so many\nyoungest you know young stars who\nstruggle with\neating disorders or mental health and i\nalways feel like well if there was\nalmost just a community of everyone who\ntalked about just all because everyone's\ndealing with and it's not the same way\nor it's not the same feeling\nbut they're dealing with similar\nchallenges at similar stages in life you\nknow it was interesting um i had and i\nspeak about it in in the book but there\nwas um this young woman who i was\nspeaking to one day and she was talking\nabout a specific actress who she\nreally wanted to be like but had read an\ninterview where they stated you know i\nnever work out i eat what i want to eat\nand all this stuff and and and she said\nyou know i just will never look like\nthat and i know they don't need to do\nanything and i feel like i'm just like\nborn differently and i went okay you\nread an interview where i can tell you\nfirsthand\nthat was a lie\ni know that that's not true it's it's an\nimage that they're putting out there um\nout of\nnot feeling comfortable they're not\ngonna they're not at the point yet to\nshare what they've experienced but i can\ntell you that's not true of everyone\nthat's\nthat is\nuh\na facade um and you are not differently\nborn you know we're not from a different\nplanet because she said you know i just\nfeel like actresses in general are like\nfrom another planet like i'm never going\nto look like you never me and i'm like\nwhoa like that trajectory is so scary\nand so far from the truth and when i\nthen wrote about my experiences and i\nand i put it out there\ni did actually have quite a few emails\nfrom people within the industry saying\nyou know\nand again it was very much i think they\nknew that i would keep it private um and\njust said i just wanted to share with\nyou thank you so much for for for\nwriting this also thank you for making\nsomething like to the bone because that\nwas me um and i don't feel like we talk\nabout it enough and i'm not at the place\nyet to talk about it i hope i will one\nday but like thank you for\nsaying that this is something that's\nthat's a that's real and b that it's not\nshameful because i'm still feeling that\nshame and i know that one day i won't\nbut like\nmaybe i can talk to you and i was like\nof course you can i'm i'm\nseriously like an open book and i\nwelcome any of that um i was a teen\ntherapist when i was in high school so\ni'm like i'm all about that i love that\nyou know um but it's true i feel like\nthere's it we all have different\nexperiences within\num mental health um\nbut we all feel the same feelings they\njust may come from different situations\nand experiences\nno one or the other is better worse more\nimportant less important it's all\nrelative and the important thing is just\nthat the core emotions and where they\ncome from can be related to and it\ndoesn't matter who you are\nwhat you do what industry you're in um\nand i and i just i feel like it's\nimportant\nfor more\nyoung people within\nthe public eye that have a platform to\nat least just not actively put out a\nfalse image because that just continues\nthat domino effect\nyeah i know and i think the strongest\npart of what you said there which i feel\nis like it's all relative i feel like so\nmany people are struggling then they\ncompare their\nthey compare their challenge or their\nissue and their pain to someone else's\nyeah and then you feel like oh well i\nshould feel better because mine's not as\nbad as theirs exactly or i they\nshouldn't be allowed to share their pain\nbecause mine's much worse yeah and i\nthink that comparison oh comparison can\nbe the worst and i still find myself\nsometimes comparing myself even though i\ntalk about not doing that it's a human\nquality it's like it's natural to all of\na sudden jump to\noh well i shouldn't because it's not as\nbad or you know who am i to say this or\nand you you have to remind yourself\nthe fact that you're feeling these\nthings\nis proof that you're feeling these\nthings and you need to talk about it and\nand you just you cannot compare yourself\nto other people even though that's like\nthe first reaction you want to have\nbecause it is all relative and we are we\nall are going through the same things\nespecially at a time like right now it's\nlike comparison can be the death that\nyou just you cannot it you'll fall into\na trap that that makes things so much\nworse i think so lily i wanted to talk\nabout emily in paris because me and\nbradley ever since we saw the trailer\nyeah we've been like waiting for today\nto watch it because i saw the trailer\nand i was just like oh this looks like\nso much fun and you know i think all of\nus have been seeking uh not just travel\nbut like\nfun and experiences right now because i\nthink a lot of our experience has been\nlimited\nand i want you to tell us what drew you\ntowards this role of emily god you know\ni this was in no way something that came\nto me and said this is yours this was a\nfight this was uh i had to really go\nafter it and i knew that i loved it the\nsecond i read it um you know a darren\nstar project featuring this young woman\nwho was bright bold a little bit obvious\nand just optimistic i'm like okay\ndefinitely want that in my life and um\nthis idea that she was in paris i mean\nit was an american in paris two cultures\nthat are very close to me you know\neuropean and american um i grew up going\nto switzerland a lot um and to france a\nlot with my dad and my little brothers\nand so for me\nright away this character\ndrew me in\nshe had all these attributes that i\nthink\nsometimes get a negative wrap like\nloving to work and admittingly you know\nreally passionate about one's work a\nromantic optimistic\nlike i said bold bright a little bit\nobvious\nand um has this can-do attitude and i\nthink there is that fine line between\nthat being a little annoying\nand endearing and genuine and i think\nthat emily is just so unapologetically\nherself and that to me was\nthe kind of character i want to play i\nlove rom-coms i love them so much\nwhat's not to love especially right now\nwhen you know just laughing and smiling\nis like i crave that um but to play a\ncharacter within that kind of rom-com\nworld\nthat is just so unapologetically herself\nand has a depth and has that\nability to ask for help\nyou know like it goes back to everything\nwe were saying that asking for help is\nnot a weakness it's a strength it's like\nknowing when you need a team and know\nwho you know who has different skill\nsets than you and also knowing when\nyou're good at something and being like\nno i'm good at that yeah and not being\nashamed to say i'm good at that and this\nis my job and i'm here for a reason it's\nit's that boldness of voice that i loved\nabout her um\nand the brightness about her because i\nthought wow i think playing emily is\ngoing to help me a lot it's going to\nmake me be super resourceful it's going\nto make me be slightly even more\noptimistic than i already am and it's\nyou know she has to pivot so much within\nher experience she's judged a lot she is\nthrowing curveballs and\nand i i mean little did i know that we\nwould then be having it come out during\na time where everyone in the world has\nhad to pivot\ndaily like how do you stay creative when\nall your distractions are taken away\nself-identity who am i when these things\nare stripped away a metaphorical mirror\nis placed in front of you all the time\nyou're judging yourself\nyou're having to think about all the\nthings that you don't necessarily love\nabout the way you handle things and how\ncan i do things better and that's what\nemily\nwas going through and she almost like\ngave me these tools a year before i knew\nthat i was going to need them which i'm\nso grateful for but it's just fun and\ni'm\ni think i'm just so honored to be a part\nof something right now that can make\nsomeone laugh or smile like at the end\nof the day\nthat is the gift of why i want to do\nwhat i do yeah and i and i definitely am\nexcited to to feel that way and\nliterally the tiny trailer gave it\nanyway like\nthere's such a beautiful energy about it\nbut you've also said it's like it's a\nstory of self-love totally tell us a bit\nabout that elaborate on that of like how\nwhat you just shared with us is actually\na journey of self-love with this\ncharacter well so emily is in the city\nof love right so everyone you know i've\nbeen asked a question of you know so\nit's so much about romance and emily\nfinds all these different people and she\ngoes and has these experiences and i go\nwell you could look at it that way\nbut the way that i see it is you learn\nso much about yourself and what you like\nand what you don't like through your\nexperiences with other people so for me\ni take from it that she is going on this\nexperience and this journey of\nloving who she is and being unapologetic\nabout who she is that she's strong\nenough to say no thank you that's not\nthe one for me or oh i like that quality\nbut\nhe's not willing to give as much as i am\nor that was wrong\ngoodbye you know and so i think it takes\na real strong sense of self and love\nto be able to have those experiences see\nthem for what they are and move on and\nemily and you know it's not a spoiler\nit's from the trailer she and her\nboyfriend break up right when she goes\nto paris because he is not willing to\nmeet her halfway and she finds that it's\nactually a relationship that she was way\nmore into giving than he was and she\nrealizes that the upcoming journey for\nher she has no idea what it's going to\nbe like but she knows that that\nexperience is far more unnecessary\nwithin her life than someone who's not\nwilling to treat her the way that she\ndeserves to be treated and that to me\nset the tone of okay this is an\nadventure and story about self-love this\nis a girl going to a foreign city with a\njob that she wasn't expecting and she's\ngoing to have to thrive and she's not\ngoing to give up and you have to find\nways to love yourself while being judged\nshe's judged every day if she took all\nof that\nand and and took it to heart in a way\nthat made her upset and and deterred her\nfrom continuing she would have gone home\nyeah but she doesn't she stays and you\nknow she meets all these people along\nthe way and i think that she starts to\nembrace herself\nmore through the work that she does\nthere i feel like that sounds like how i\nfelt when i first moved to new york oh\nmy god i was not even a man like four\nyears ago i can relate to so much of\nthat like i feel like me and my wife had\njust got married and six months later we\nmoved to new york for an unexpected job\nthat i was had no plans for and it was\nyeah it was it was it's i it's almost\nlike i can relate to so many parts of it\nalready which yeah which is exciting but\ntell tell me have you and your fiance\nbeen to paris together yet yeah so he\nactually came out\nso many times during filming which makes\nthis\neven more special because\nalmost all the scenes that i reference\nin terms of like my favorite scenes or\njust my favorite memories i'm like oh he\nwas right behind the camera or in\nbetween takes weird the paris opera\nhouse we had that you know all night to\nshoot in and he was there and so there\nwe are like\nrunning down the hallways like\nyou know he kissed me in that hallway\nand i'm looking at the mural and we're\ntaking photos and i'm like wait this is\nthat was real life you know and so it's\nvery much a city that i associate with\nhim and i and just how wonderful to be\nable to have\na work experience and a job\nmean so much because of a personal\nexperience and to be able to share that\nwith him\nand i think it only aided me working you\nknow to be surrounded by that love\nof course then my character's gonna feel\nthat love within herself and it really\nhelped hold me up because it was the\nhardest i've ever worked um\nbeing in like every scene of that show\ntalking 24 7 and my character talks a\nlot and she has these like long\nmonologues where she just goes at it and\nso to have that like support system was\nwas so necessary i love that\nyou were there for four months you were\nsaying i was yeah you're filming tell us\nabout what i mean that was obviously all\npre-covered and it was last year and it\nwas yeah tell us about what that\nexperience was like being in a different\ncity for four months oh my god it was so\nfun i'd been to paris many times before\nbut usually only for a few days whether\nit's for a job or press or something\nlike that so to be a local of sorts um\nwith an apartment and\nyou know i miss so much the beauty of\nwandering and getting lost um everything\nnow is so intention-based whether it's\nyou know i'm going here for this amount\nof time i can't wander i'm going to pick\nthis up i'm going to go back home i'm\ngoing to be safe and i i'm so on board\nwith that of course but i miss the\nability of losing track of time because\nyou're just\num experiencing life and being\nspontaneous like i missed that and paris\nis such a beautiful city to do that\nyou're wandering down like cobblestone\nside streets and you're like i'm going\nto grab a coffee here i'm going to go\ninto this book shop oh my god it's been\nsix hours you know and you're just\nwandering and and the city is is so\naesthetically gorgeous and has such a\nrich history that you can't help but\nfall in love with the city every single\ntime you go\nthat being said i had many experiences\nthat were very similar to emily and that\nlike i lost hot water in my apartment\nfor two weeks no heating when it was\nstarting to get cold was that the\ndirectors playing tricks i literally\nsaid that i was like guys um i already\nhave enough empathy for emily um i don't\nneed to feel more uh and so i ended up\nlike showering at the studio or like you\nknow it was just it was pretty funny but\num\nparis is a character it's a character in\nand of itself and i feel like that\ntranslates aesthetically into the into\nthe show but also when you go there you\njust know\nyou know that you never know what you're\ngonna get and i kind of love that yeah\nwell everyone is listening and watching\nright now you have to go and watch the\nshow it's out right now\nand\nwe all need to laugh right now like we\ngenuinely do we need to laugh we need to\nsmile we need to\nfeel like we're having new experiences\nand uh you know i just i'm i'm i'm\ngenuinely so excited to see it because i\nfeel like me and my wife have been like\ncrying out for a new wrong comfort oh\nwow god it's like those rom-coms that\nyou wish they still made from the 90s or\nthe early 2000s i'm so glad you just oh\nmy god are you kidding me i'm like why\nis no one financing these movies anymore\nbecause we need them now literally all\nright so we get 10 episodes of that i\nlove hoping for a season too i love it\nyeah well no we're hoping too and i\ncan't wait to watch it i want to end you\nknow we end every on-purpose interview\nwith the final five yes which are the\nfinal five rapid fire round of the fast\nfive uh so you have to answer every\nquestion in one word or one sentence\nyeah i know this is always so hard yes\nokay so your first one is\noh i've got such a nice choice in\nselection\ni'm gonna go let's let's start with um\nhow would you define your purpose right\nnow\num\nmy purpose right now\num\nstay\npresent\ni love that that's right because there's\nso\nmany things right now that could take me\noff the ground into\nanother place and and just lose myself\nand what's most important right now\nis\nis being present and not allowing any of\nthe\noutside talk to\ntake me away from what's most important\nyou know i'm i'm so excited about\neverything that's going on\nprofessionally\nbut i also just got engaged and that to\nme is like\nthe most exciting craziest thing and to\nme i'm like\nthat's my that's my focus like that's a\nhuge part of my life that i just\nalways wanted but didn't know when it\nwould happen and that to me is like stay\npresent stay present stay present i love\nthat that's so beautiful i i remember\nback to um when me and my wife were\ngetting married yeah\nand indian weddings last for like seven\ndays\nyes\nand and it was just i look back and i'm\nlike i'm really glad it lasted for seven\ndays because it went so fast i can't\nimagine yeah and it was without it was\nthe most special time ever\nand it's really funny because in the\nrun-up to the wedding especially having\nlived as a monk like weddings weren't\nreally like top of mind for me so even\nwhen i was getting married about to get\nmarried i was so like yeah it's a\nwedding but we're going to spend the\nrest of our lives together we love each\nother and when i was actually getting\nmarried i was like this is amazing like\nyou know it was just and wanting to be\npresent with it like just recognizing\nhow special it was yeah and and is but\nyeah no i love that i think that's\nyou're giving yourself the best advice\nall right uh question number two what's\nthat two what's a non-negotiable in life\nfor you like what is something that you\ndon't negotiate with on a daily basis um\ndon't uh i don't want to feel small\ndon't don't um try to quiet my voice\nbecause i've\nbeen there i've done that it's taken so\nlong for me to\num\nbuild it up and to make it loud and to\nown it that i\ni\ni just non-negotiable is is making me\nfeel quieted perfect i love that that's\nbeautiful question number three what's\nthe biggest lesson you've learned in the\nlast 12 months it's okay\nto show someone that you're not perfect\nit doesn't mean that they're gonna leave\nyou know it's like\nyou've got to be all versions of\nyourself um\nbecause at the end of the day that's\nlife and the right person will love all\nthose sides uh and in quarantine you\ndefinitely experience all sides and\nyou can't be perfect all the time i love\nthat question number four what's\nsomething that\nyou've been certain of in life that you\nthink other people might disagree with\nyou on what's something that you're sure\nabout there\nother people may debate or\nmay not agree\nuh oh that's really good\num\ni\nokay i'm gonna\ni've got an answer but it's actually\nokay i'll just say it i'll just say it\njust say it um when i was 16 i was\npitching talk show ideas of um\nbeing a 16 year old vocalizing myself on\ncurrent topics\nemotional topics and bridging the gap\nbetween my generation and my mom's i was\nturned down at every single place that i\nwent i was told that no one wanted that\nperspective and why would anyone want to\nwatch a kid uh talk about those types of\nthings\ncut to now where\nthe youth\nhas an incredibly huge voice means\neverything in terms of the future and um\ni just knew it was something that i felt\nso strongly about that\ni continue to vocalize now in\nencouraging whether it's voting or\nvocalizing oneself in mental health\nissues or current topics in general um\nyoung people need to feel like their\nvoice is heard and i was like i really\nwas told no so many times but i just\nknew so deeply that it was something\nthat needed to be done and to be said\nlove it great answer and fifth and final\nquestion\nuh\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be oh my god\num\none law\noh boy\num\ngod your questions are hard\nthey're saying really you should have\nbeen prepared i mean you like you listen\nno i know um one law that everyone\nshould follow\nis\num\ndon't lie\nthey're gonna get it's gonna catch up\nyeah don't lie it's not worth it\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love we all have a\nplace of knowing inside of us\nand we sometimes it's almost like we get\nlost and we can't find it because we're\nso concerned about how people are going\nto feel about the way we feel"
