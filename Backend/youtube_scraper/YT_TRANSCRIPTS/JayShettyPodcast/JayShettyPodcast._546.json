    "transcript": "when we positively associate with a song\na person a face an object we don't just\nbenefit from those activities based on\nthe effects of those activities it's\nalso what we believe about those\nactivities combined and the release of\ndopamine makes you more capable of then\nleaning into life and going and doing\nother things the effect of a small even\nyou know half a percent increase in\ndopamine transmission in the brain is\nthe difference between feeling like your\nlife is bleak\nand you can completely\nattack the day in the positive sense\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\ni'm so grateful that you come back every\nsingle week to listen learn and grow and\nyou know that the podcast for me is just\nan opportunity to reach out to people\nthat i'm inspired by people that i feel\nare changing the world people that i\nfeel have amazing insights that i can\nlearn from and want to share with you\nand today's guest is someone that i've\nbeen connected with for a while but i am\nso excited to finally have him in the\nstudio because not only is his insights\nhaving a huge impact on how we live how\nwe think uh just the energy that i felt\nfrom him in the first couple of moments\nthat i've met him i can already tell\nthat it's all in his heart too and so to\nmeet someone who's super strategic super\nscientific has an incredible mind but\nhas a beautiful heart in person that's\nmy kind of person and today's guest is\nnone other than andrew huberman he's a\nneuroscientist and tenured professor in\nthe department of neurobiology at the\nstanford university school of medicine\nhe has made numerous significant\ncontributions to the fields of brain\ndevelopment brain function and\nneuroplasticity which is the ability of\nour nervous system to rewire and learn\nnew behaviors skills and cognitive\nfunctioning he also is a mcknight\nfoundation and pew foundation fellow and\nwas awarded the kogan award in 2017\nwork from the hubermann laboratory at\nstanford school of medicine has been\npublished in top journals including\nnature science and cell and has been\nfeatured in time bbc scientific american\ndiscover and other top media outlets in\n2021 dr hubermann launched the hubermann\nlab podcast which i'm a huge fan of and\ni know you are too the podcast is\nfrequently ranked in the top 25 of all\npodcasts globally and is often ranked as\nthe number one in the categories of\nscience education health and fitness\nplease welcome my new friend and uh\nsomeone that i'm a huge fan of and\nadmire andrew hooverman andrew thank you\nfor doing this\nthank you so much thank you for being\nhere and\nhonestly thank you for what you do in\nthe world i think it's\nbeen brilliant to see someone\nbring so much heart into science\nand science into heart\nand i know that people who listen to you\nand hear from you and communicate with\nyou and even i've really meant it a few\nmoments we just spent right now\ni i love that combination and\ni wonder how\nyou\nwhether you even see it that way whether\nyou don't but i'm fascinated by\nis that how you've always lived have you\nbeen fascinated by the heart and science\nfor a while first of all i just want to\nsay thank you for having me here we've\nknown each other uh through some mutual\ncontacts for a while and it's a delight\nto be here i'm an admirer and a fan of\nall you do and the way you approach it\nso um heartfelt thanks for for having me\nhere um in terms of\nyou know how things have evolved to to\nuh\nwhere they are now you know i don't have\nmuch of a mission statement but i\nsuppose if i had to pick one it's to\nshare the the beauty and the utility of\nbiology since i was very young\ni've been obsessed with learning and\ni've also had a compulsion to share what\ni've learned especially when i think\nthat the information can be of use to\npeople\nso the little six and eight year old and\nten-year-old version of me um\nwouldn't shut up i was just constantly\ntalking about all the stuff i had been\nreading about on the weekends and over\ntime\nit just made sense to become an academic\nfor that reason and then nowadays with\nthe advent of podcasting i have this\nwonderful opportunity to share things\nthat i think are useful in terms of the\nheart and the mind you know i\nuh can only frame it by saying that you\nknow our nervous system is our brain our\nspinal cord but of course all their\nconnections with the organs of the body\nand back again and so we really can't\ndivorce any of the organs of the body\nfrom our thinking and feeling in action\nand vice versa as you very well know and\nthen from a more personal standpoint you\nknow i had the great benefit of training\nwith mentors\nin science who really lived and breathed\ntheir science but also had a deep sense\nof humanity each one of them had an eye\nor an ear toward things that were\nrelevant to them in one case uh\none\nwith a particular interest in mental\nhealth and the struggles around mental\nhealth and mental illness\nthe other uh just a person who just\nloved animals and the natural kingdom\nand and then my other advisor was a very\nstrong advocate for scientists of all\nkinds and backgrounds and so i was\nso blessed to be weaned by people who\nreally instilled in me a love and a\ndesire for learning and sharing and\ndoing research but also understood that\nhow one shows up to the conversation\nmeans everything and so you know i just\nfeel very blessed to have had that and\ni'm just trying to do right by by them i\nlove hearing that like i had no idea\nthat that was a part of\nhow you were mentored and guided and\ni mean i'm sure they feel very uh proud\nin seeing that you continue on and pass\nthat legacy on and so beautifully but\ni think what i find even more intriguing\nabout that is so many of our early\nlearning experiences\nare not necessarily that way and you\nsaid that you loved learning and you\nlove sharing\ni think most people that i know are at\nleast that i talk to or i hear from in\ncomments or podcasts would say school\nwas not an exciting place for them maybe\nthey went to college or didn't go to\ncollege but they necessarily didn't have\na positive experience maybe it was\nfilled with fear or doubt or judgment or\ncriticism or maybe there was a lack of\nconfidence that could have been not only\nfrom teachers and the school system it\ncould have been from friends or bullies\nor or people in that environment so\nwhat i'm fascinated by is our\nrelationship with learning\nbecause when i look at my relationship\nwith learning too\ni\nremember starting off having that buzz\nand spark then almost feeling like i was\nforced to believe there are only certain\nways you could learn\ni grew up believing i didn't like\nreading\nbecause we were only encouraged to read\nfiction books and even till this day i\ndon't like reading fiction books i have\nno interest in reading fiction books i\nlove reading non-fiction and today i can\nread non-fiction books every day every\nweek every month every year and i'm\nfully engrossed and immersed that's why\ni'm excited for your book one day\nand\ni think that\nis something that i learned that i do\nlove reading i do love learning but i\nwas never introduced to that form until\nmy father gave me a biography when i was\n14 years old and so\nhow do you think our relationship with\nlearning has been formed over time\nhearing from your own as well i think it\nwas the great physicist max del brooke\nwho said that you know when teaching\nassume zero knowledge and infinite\nintelligence i try and keep that in mind\ni think that we are all innate learners\nby virtue of the fact that this thing\nthis nervous system as it's called is\nreally a map of our experience and it's\nthere to form itself it's unusual among\nthe organs in that it shapes itself\nright unlike the kidney or the liver\nwhich doesn't constantly update its own\nform and function the same way the\nnervous system is there essentially to\neducate itself so that it can operate\nbetter in a given environment and once\none understands that you start to\nrealize that the forms of learning are\nmany so for instance\nyou know math or i suppose in in the uk\nwas maths\nmath you know could be learned by way of\nof of different using different types of\nexamples right movement of trains or\nbartering systems or on paper just\nsimple long division and multiplication\nbut in the end what you're really trying\nto find anytime you're teaching or\nlearning is you're trying to find\na universal algorithm of how the brain\nworks and what i mean by that is that\nyou know all these nerve cells they only\ncan communicate through chemicals and\nelectricity you know it's really just\nmeat in there believe it or not um but\nthere are algorithms that are universal\nso whether or not one learns better\nverbally or visually or whether one has\na propensity for math or for verbal\nsubjects\nwhat is true for all of us is that the\nbrain is there always asking questions\nand trying to make predictions about its\nenvironment and i think what happens is\nwhen we're children\nwe are learning passively all the time\nas we get older and especially as we get\nto our mid and late 20s\nit takes an immense amount of focus and\nenergy in order to learn but of course\nthe nervous system can still shape\nitself well into adulthood but\nalmost certainly for the entire lifespan\nbut that focus and energy feels almost\nlike an agitation and i think that as\nchildren we don't necessarily experience\nthat agitation because we can for better\nfor worse we can experience and change\npassively neuroplasticity just happens\nby way of pure experience\nas we get older mid-20s early 30s and so\non\nthat\nthat threshold of agitation for people\nfeels um like it's something to back\naway from\nbut if we can learn to approach that and\nunderstand that that agitation is\nactually the circulation of chemicals\nwhich is the the brain and nervous\nsystem telling itself aha now i need to\npay attention and change we can start to\nactually modify the way that system\nworks so that's a bit of a convoluted\nanswer to your question but i think that\nat the heart of our nervous system is\nthis ability these algorithms by which\nit can change its themselves and it's on\nall of us to understand that that bit of\nagitation and discomfort need not be\ninterpreted as discomfort that's the\nedge where learning\nis beginning so confusion being\nperplexed\nfeeling somewhat overwhelmed by the\namount of information that's actually\nthe stir of chemicals that are cueing\nthe nervous system to change because if\nit can do something easily there's no\nreason for the nervous system to change\nnow in terms of different styles of\nteaching and learning i think that many\nof us\nexperience that agitation early on and\nwe\nfor reasons that are understandable we\nbacked away from learning anymore so for\ninstance i'm musically i can't i'm\nmusically deficient i love music but i\ncan't play music to save my life and i\nthink that's entirely because as as a\nkid every time i would try and play\nmusic it just sounded terrible everyone\ncringed the dogs dogs literally howled\nso i stopped right but knowing what i\nknow now that would be the cue to that\nthe agitation the stress the um\nembarrassment is actually the cue to the\nnervous system that it's about to rewire\nitself so i think if people just\nunderstood that um\nchildren and adults would lean into\nlearning\nmore regularly and hopefully with more\nease overall yeah definitely i mean even\nnow when\nwhat sparks from that answer which i\nactually really appreciated\nis the idea that\nas we get older as you said it has to\nbecome more conscious it has that\ntension\nit's almost like you have to\nstart figuring out how you learn bass\nbest and how you process ideas so for me\ni know that i love to first dive deep\nand immerse myself in something\nand then i like to create a structured\napproach to get there\nif i enjoy it so if i want to learn a\nnew skill i'll get obsessed with it for\na weekend i'll go on the course i'll\nread the book i'll watch every video i\njust want to dive in to really see if i\ngenuinely care or whether it's me\nthinking i care and to try and separate\nthat ego and that true desire for me at\nleast\nand if i do a weekend of something i\nrealize oh my ego liked that but i\ndidn't really like that i'm gonna step\naway or actually wow this is fascinating\nthen i'll go and build a step-by-step\nplan with small steps and incremental\nsteps that i've learned over a long time\nof\nlearning different things\nhow can people think about the best way\nthey can learn what are different styles\nwhat are different methods that you\nthink people can think if someone's\nlistening right now and they're like\nandrew well i want to learn a new\ninstrument or\ni want to learn a new language or maybe\nit's i want to learn how to start a\npodcast or i want to learn how to play a\nsport or whatever it may be how can\nsomeone start thinking about how they\nshould approach learning terrific\nquestion unfortunately nowadays we can\nlook to studies done in humans that\ndefine some very key principles the\nfirst principle is that the whole\nprocess of neuroplasticity and learning\nis really a two-stage process\nfirst there must be focus and alertness\nthat focus and alertness is associated\nwith the release of neurochemicals\nso-called neuromodulators things like\nacetylcholine in particular and which\nsort of acts as a highlighter pen if you\nwill for certain connections in the\nbrain to later be reinforced and the\nneurochemical adrenaline which is also\ncalled epinephrine also depending on if\nyou're in the uk or elsewhere a long\ninteresting story not for this time\nabout why it has multiple names\nepinephrine\nalso called adrenaline is associated\nwith an increase in kind of agitation\nand alertness acetylcholine think of it\nas kind of a spotlight or a highlighter\npen for certain connections in the brain\nso you need alertness and focus and then\nthe second stage is that it is only\nduring periods of deep rest in\nparticular sleep and something that i\ncall non-sleep deep rest which i've\ngiven an acronym because scientists like\nacronyms nsdr non-sleep depressed things\nlike yoga nidra things like shallow naps\nthings like forms of meditation that\ndon't involve a lot of focused\nconcentration you're a far more the\nexperienced meditator than i so i'm\noutside my wheelhouse when talking about\nmeditation but it is only\nperiods of intense focus and alertness\nfollowed by periods of deep rest that\nallow the nervous system to change and\nthere is an abundance of evidence for\nthat so that's the first thing to\nunderstand the brain actually rewires\nduring deep sleep and rest because\nduring deep sleep and rest naps yoga\nnidra deep sleep there's a replay of the\nvery same cells in the brain that were\nactive during learning often times in\nreverse for reasons that are still not\nunderstood but at a much higher\nrepetition rate so you're actually\ngetting repetitions while you sleep this\nis why one will strain to learn a\nlanguage or a motor skill or maths or\nsomething like that over and over and\nover it doesn't happen you take a couple\nof nights sleep take a break from and\nall of a sudden it's there it's because\nit happens in rest now there's some\nother things that one can do to enhance\nthis process further that are arrived to\nus from good data\nfirst of all there's a so-called\nultradian rhythm which is the 90-minute\ncycles during which we can focus pretty\nwell for a duration of about 90 minutes\nof course flickering in and out of focus\nnobody really focuses for 90 minutes\nstraight unless they've built up that\ncapacity or they are very interested in\nwhat they're learning right they're just\nwrapped with attention usually people\nflicker in and out and of course\nnowadays there's a lot of literature and\nideas about ways to maintain focus put\nthe phone away\nlimit noise some people like background\nnoise some people like music some don't\nit's very contextual highly\nindividualized\nbut 90 minutes is sort of the the\nbatch of time that the brain can focus\nreally hard on one thing before it needs\na true rest of of an hour or two before\nyou can go back to learning or working\nvery hard the other thing is that um\nthere's some very interesting data\nshowing that shallow naps or nsdr\nnon-sleep deep breaths done within four\nhours of one of these 90 minute learning\nbouts can be very beneficial for\naccelerating learning and then there are\nthese incredible data on so-called gap\neffects so there have been studies now\nof of skills that are physical skills\nmental skills where people will for\ninstance try to learn scales on the\npiano or a math problem or a spatial\nproblem or a physical skill and then at\nrandom\nevery so often a buzzer will go off and\nthe person will just be told to do\nnothing sit their eyes closed or eyes\nopen and do nothing just stop the\nlearning process for about 10 seconds\nand then return to doing what they're\ndoing these are these little micro rests\nit turns out that during those\nmicroarrests the hippocampus a brain\narea as you know that's associated with\nlearning and memory and the neocortex\nalso associated with learning and memory\nundergoes replay of the thing that the\nindividual is trying to learn at 20\ntimes the speed\nalso in reverse just as in sleep and\nthat has can lead and has been shown to\nlead to accelerations in learning so\nthere are these ways i wouldn't even\nthink of them as hacks because the word\nhack is a little tricky because when i\nthink of the word hack it seems like\ndoing something with an object or a tool\nthat wasn't designed for that purpose\nright\nthe nervous system already harbors these\nmechanisms and one can access them\nthrough these little micro rests so\nwhether or not you're a child or an\nadult every so often when trying to\nlearn something just pause for 10\nseconds or so do your best to just clear\nyour mind of course it's very hard to\nclear the mind but\ndo your best to clear the mind and then\ngo back to the learning task as as it\nwere and that has been shown to very to\nsignificantly accelerate the learning\nprocess and the retention of newly\nlearned information and then the last\nthing you touched on earlier which is\nthis notion of incremental learning you\nsaid you like to throw yourself into\nsomething as kind of a litmus test of\nwhether or not you enjoy it or not\nturns out that\nfrom beautiful work done by my colleague\nat stanford school of medicine eric\nknutson has shown\nthat yes it's true that early in\ndevelopment in humans this would be up\nuntil the mid-20s we can learn things in\nlarger batches and much more easily than\nwe can later in life however if one\nbatches that work into smaller\nincrements\nand for so for instance deciding maybe\nset a timer turning the phone off\notherwise and saying i'm going to spend\nthree minutes just three minutes in\ntrying to intensely learn this thing\neven if i feel like i'm failing\nif one does that repeatedly\nthose little increments of learning can\nlead to an outsized amount of learning\noverall and so the nervous system loves\nincremental learning it loves to batch\nthings into focused little bouts\nand you know if that's already the the\ntools that you've built up which it\nsounds like you have wonderful but if\nsomebody is out there trying you know\nstruggling to learn\nreally trying to break things down into\nvery brief periods of intense focus that\nis the cue by which during sleep the\nnervous system will change itself and\nthis has been shown over and over and\nover again even in very late life\nuh individuals people in there you know\nwe like to think life could go on\nfurther than this but people in their\n80s and 90s still have neuroplasticity\nthere's even evidence that new neurons\ncan be produced in the hippocampus of\npeople in their late 80s and 90s so the\ncapacity is there this is why i love\nwhat you do because you would never\nconsider that the answer to learning\nis depressed honestly provided the focus\ncomes first of course yeah of course the\nfocus and the attention is but of course\nsleep deprivation makes it very hard to\nlearn and there's something else\nimportant that happens in sleep nowadays\nwe i think most people thanks to the\nbeautiful work of matthew walker at\nberkeley and others really understand\nthe value of sleep for health immune\nsystem function etc there is a stage of\nsleep rapid eye movement sleep that\nwe're all familiar with of course and\nwhere literally the eyes are moving um\nthat tends to come later in the night\nduring the second half of sleep where\nthere's a there's a tendency to have\nvery emotional dreams\nor at least dreams that are\nlaid in with a lot of emotional content\nof some kind\nduring rapid eye movement sleep there's\nan inability to move the body we call\nthis a tonia it's a literally a sleep\ninduced paralysis that's healthy\nand\na complete failure of the nervous system\nto release adrenaline epinephrine\nthis is sort of like a trauma therapy in\nsome sense if you think about it it's a\nreplay of an emotional event minus the\nneurochemical that makes us feel tense\nand agitated so in our mind those dreams\ncan often feel very distressing it's\nbeen shown that if you deprive people of\nrapid eye movement sleep they fail to to\ndump the negative emotions of things\nthat happen the day before and the day\nbefore and i think all of us have\nexperienced the\nshift in emotionality that happens when\nwe are sleep deprived what ends up\nhappening is that the little things seem\nlike big things but after a few nights\nsleep we're okay and there's no mystery\nto why that is anymore i think almost\nevery sleep scientist believes it has\nsomething to do with this built-in kind\nof trauma release therapy where you get\nto experience the thing in your sleep\nminus the neurochemicals that make your\nbody feel terrible and somehow that\ndissociation allows people to then step\nback into life with it with a clean\nslate wow yeah no i've i've heard those\nideas before but the way you just\nwove it all together is really special\nwhat i'm intrigued by then is what's the\nlatest science on dreams\nuh because\nthere are so many spiritual\nwisdom-based\napproaches to dreams i've\nnever really\ndived deep enough i think from a\nscientific perspective into dreams apart\nfrom\nuh\nsome particular aspects but let's let's\ngo there let yeah where is so i love the\nidea that sleep of course is acting as\nsomewhat of a dishwasher cleansing\nhealing agent so that while we're\nsleeping um\nwe're actually being able to release\nthese ideas hence we have\nwhere do dreams fit into that picture\nyeah well i'm glad you said dishwasher\nbecause from a pure physiological\nstandpoint this is separate from dreams\nbut from a pure physiological standpoint\nit's now well appreciated that during\nsleep\nthere's a rinsing out of the debris that\naccumulate in the brain the brain is the\nmost metabolically demanding organ that\nwe have it consumes tons of energy most\nof the energy that we burn in terms of\ncalories is from our brain not our\nmuscles even if people aren't don't feel\nlike they're thinking very hard\nand thinking very hard as we know can\nfeel very taxing we can feel exhausted\nafter a hard conversation right\nthe\nthis washout as it's called is a\nso-called glymphatic rinse out the brain\nwasn't thought to have a lymphatic\nsystem but it does\ncerebrospinal fluid starts to reverse\nbasically its pattern of flow during\nsleep all these incredible ways of\nwashing out the brain during sleep now\nduring the first half of one's night\nthe\n90-minute cycles still persist that\nwe're talking about earlier these all\ntrading cycles and those 90-minute\ncycles are mostly made up of so-called\nslow wave sleep\nso we see big amplitude brain waves this\nkind of thing\ndreams tend to be pretty boring early in\nthe night\nuh they tend to be more associated with\nmotor function and movement and it's\nactually the case that growth hormone is\nreleased in the early part of the night\nand that most of the repair of the body\nand tissues is occurring during that\nfirst half of sleep as the night goes on\ndreams become more intense and more\nemotionally laden regardless of what's\nbeen going on in someone's waking life\nand\nin fact toward mourning almost all of\nthose 90-minute cycles that occur\nback-to-back is going to be comprised of\nof this rapid eye movement sleep\nso the sleep toward morning is going to\nbe a much more emotional\nnow the interesting thing is that\nif you look at the data on dreaming in\nhumans\nand you look at it purely through the\nlens of neuroscience you get a bunch of\nlanguage back about okay not much\nepinephrine happening so you're\ndissociating the emotion from the\nneurochemical state if you look to the\npsychology literature which i do you or\nyou read a book like memories dreams and\nreflections by jung or you start to look\nat some of the the kind of hybrid work\nwhich is psychiatry which of course are\nmds that are grounded in physiology but\nalso things psychoanalytically\nthey i think they're really on to\nsomething with this idea that dreams are\nbasically a time in which the ordinary\nsequence of life events is converted\ninto heuristics shorthand symbols and\nthe brain loves symbols in the daytime\ntoo right we don't walk around parsing\nevery angle of every um object the way\nthe visual system works is that the\nrecognition of your face for instance\nthere's a brain area that rec i've seen\nyou many many millions of times billions\nof times probably and i recognize you\nimmediately as chase shetty because\nthere literally is a neuron in my brain\nthat's a j shetty neuron we know this\nright from recording from brains of\npeople that recognize people right if i\ni met some of your staff today lovely\npeople for the first time\nnow those neurons exist for them but\nthat representation of you was built up\nthrough basic representation of just the\norientations of lines all right just\nlike a one would sketch your face and\nthen build in more elaborate\nrepresentation\nthe brain represents things in symbols\nin a very abstract way so without going\ndown too far of a rabbit hole if i were\nto for instance say you know what jay\ni'm going to play artists today um of\nwhich i'm not and i'm going to draw your\nface and i did my best to draw your face\ni showed it to you you'd probably say oh\nthat's not great but but you'd probably\nrecognize some of the features but for\ninstance if i decided that i was going\nto put your eyes in a different location\neliminate your teeth put a bunch of\ntattoos on your face for fun and and\nshow you this and i'd say you'd say that\ndoesn't look anything like me and i say\nah but that's my abstract representation\nof you it turns out that the brain\nrepresents everything in the external\nworld as a shorthand abstract\nrepresentation and in dreams\nthe reason that this that we tend to for\ninstance replace people with animals or\nobjects with um\nwith different objects\nis because the brain is thinking more in\nterms of the relationships between\nobjects than it is the objects\nthemselves and so this is where dream\nanalysis gets a little bit tricky so the\nanalysts would say\nuh you know the for instance i had a\ndream not that long ago where i was\nbeing chased by two animals it was a\nbear and a wolf a very salient dream for\nme\nand turns out that that bear in that\nwolf i realized only later that day i\nwas walking around i'd gone for a swim\nin the ocean got out of the ocean and i\nturned to someone and i said oh my\ngoodness i know what that was about that\nwas about these two children that are\nnow in my life that um and i thought\nthey're chasing me like they need\nsomething for me and it opened up an\nentire conscious discussion about that\nso in my mind these children were\nrepresented as animals not because\nchildren are always represented as\nanimals but probably because it was the\nfeeling that they were impinging on me\nand they're one of their lovely children\nbut nonetheless that they're impinging\non me so the point is not my dream the\npoint is that dream analysis always has\nto take into account that the brain\noperates in symbols where objects are\nreplaceable\nand\nthere is there are only relationships\nbetween objects and so if one has a very\nscary dream about a person or sees a\nmonster\nit's really in the early waking state of\nthe day that we are in a position to\nbest understand those relationships so\nhere's a tool i recommend that's\nactually supported by sleep science\nwhich is when waking\nand in the first 30 minutes or so around\nwaking you're in this liminal state even\nif you're somebody wakes up and feels\nvery alert you're in this liminal state\nwhere that symbolism is still quite\nfluid\ni highly recommend that people try and\nnot bring in too much new sensory\nexperience if they want to understand\ntheir dream stay lying down with your\neyes closed maybe tell your partner or\nsomeone else you live with if you live\nwith somebody that you just need a few\nmoments and just try and move about your\nday in a way where you're not trying to\nsolve the dream but you're also not\nbringing in a lot of new sensory\nexperience because in that moment you\nactually stand a chance of parsing what\nthat relationship is\nand\nthis is something that psychoanalysts\nunderstand this is something that\nbelieve it or not clinical hypnotists\nunderstand bring people into a state of\ndeep relaxation and\nbe able to capture that transition\nbetween the sleep and waking state\nforgive me for the you know excessively\nlong answer but not excessively long at\nall fascinating honestly like not not\nexcessively long please carry on yeah\nwell there so there's physiology that we\nknow and then there's the psychology of\nthis and and just to make it very clear\nthe brain thinks in symbols in the\ndaytime and in dreams in waking states\nand in dreams it's all symbols\neverything is symbolic representation\nbecause we can't parse all the\ninformation coming into our nervous\nsystem but because the nervous system's\nmain job is to make really good\npredictions\nto basically do statistics like when for\ninstance as a child one of the first\nthings you learn is that objects fall\ndown not up so the first time they see a\nhelium balloon it's like awe and\nexcitement that on excitement is the\nrelease of neurochemicals that teach the\nbrain sometimes objects fall up so to\nspeak\nso once one starts to recognize that the\nbrain is always trying to make these\npredictions you can start to look at\nyour dreams as\nsymbolic representations and how those\nrelate to one another the action\nfunctions are far more interesting and\nimportant than ah it was a vase and you\nknow when i was a kid there was a vase\nin my grandmother's home and that vase\nrepresented something maybe but more\nlikely you would want to think about the\nshape of it or what it what where that\nvase was in relationship to other things\nbecause that's how the brain works it\nmakes predictions based on context yeah\ni hope that's helpful to people um if\nthere's if there are other theories of\ndreams and i'm certain that there are\nthat extend past this i apologize for\nnot addressing them but i think for most\npeople just thinking about the\nrelationship between objects in their\ndreams is going to be\nmore useful than thinking about what\nexactly the dream was about quote\nunquote yes and and i want to just say\nplease do not apologize that was a\nbrilliant answer and and it was so\nuseful even for me because\ni i think you're so right that so often\neven people will ask me they'll be like\nhey i had this dream what does it mean\none thing we have not solved as\nneuroscientists is two things one why it\nis that people need to tell other people\ntheir dreams because other people unless\nit's a trained therapist totally aren't\nuseless of course\nunless they have intense knowledge of\nthe symbolic representations in your\nlife we should all be doing this\nourselves and the other one is a kind of\npeculiar one which there seems to be a\nneed among many people that if they wake\nup in the middle of the night and they\ncan't sleep to wake up other people who\nare sleeping but i haven't solved that\none no i love that and i completely\nagree with you i think\nwhen i think about that though what\nreally struck me was this idea of the\nbrain loving symbols\nand i think of what are healthy symbols\nthroughout the day\nbecause i think we forget i mean you\ncame into this room earlier we came into\nthe studio and you were looking around\nat all my symbols that i surround myself\nwith do they count as symbols do they\nnot count as simple absolutely right i\none thing i noticed immediately on\nwalking in here is these many things are\nbeautiful and they have a lot of depth\nto them and i have this um\nuh obsession with anytime i'm in a new\nenvironment provided that it's\nappropriate i just have to sniff around\nand look at everything yeah to kind of\nknow where i am in relationship to\nthings absolutely and i saw you do that\nand i didn't want to bore you with the\nhistory of everything i could set it to\nyou but the idea that\ni find as well this environment has been\nsculpted\nwith symbols that allow me to be present\nwith someone and what i hope will help\nothers be present as well or at least\nspark their curiosity and intrigue so\nthat we can have that in our\nconversation\ni wonder what are healthy symbols are\nthere certain healthy symbols for the\nbrain to connect with on a daily basis\nbefore sleep after sleep that allow us\nto\nprogram ourselves more effectively\nbecause i feel like most of the symbols\nthat we're seeing are unconscious\nor unintentional\nor mainly marketing or advertising or\npropaganda but we're not really\nselective around our symbols yeah i love\nthat you asked this question because um\nfor years you know we hear these things\nlike we you know you are the sum of the\nfive people you spend the most time with\nbut nowadays we spend more time with\nsymbols and people on social media than\nwe do often times with other individuals\nor at least equal amounts of time in the\nroom right rarely is it just the\nphysical bodies in the room it's all the\nthe people in our phone which i don't\nsee as a bad thing right actually for\nyears um when i was working more or less\nin isolation in my lab um\ni\nhad this little list i don't think i've\never shared this before i had this\nlittle list of people who uh i love and\nadmire many of whom i've never met\nand i just would read that list over and\nover again i didn't realize at the time\nbut i was developing what i believe the\nanalysts call this a um an interject or\nan introject perhaps someone should look\nthat up forget which one it is um which\nis actually a subconscious\nrepresentation of somebody else's ideas\nand approach to things that if we um for\ninstance listen to you\nover and over again the nervous system\nstarts to ask questions like what would\njay do in this circumstance that's a\nvery real thing and we're not always\nconsciously aware of it now physical\nsymbols are also very important because\nthe brain\nlikes to make predictions\nit loves symbols because symbols are a\nshorthand way of of eliminating a lot of\nuseless information but\nmuch of the way that we operate and feel\nreally does impact us at a subconscious\nlevel\nand this has been shown over and over\nagain i mean it's and it's always cast\nin the context of subconscious bias\nwhich has kind of a negative slant\nanytime we hear bias of course but there\nare positive biases as well so i think\nthat for some people having order among\nsymbols is very important equal spacing\neverything very aligned i'm sort of one\nof those but you know i'm kind of in the\nmiddle\nother people\num they aren't so\nconsumed with the with the relationships\nbetween how they arrange things\nphysically but they enjoy great depth\nand emotional relationship to things it\ncould be a pendant it could be nowadays\nyou know people like tattoos are kind of\ninteresting yeah they're much more\nprominent than when i was growing up\nthey are an externalization of how\npeople feel on the inside yes right so\nthose are very powerful symbols and\nthere's something about the process of\nstamping it into one's skin etc um the\nslighter intense pain involved depending\non where and who does it and who and the\nperson's pain threshold so symbols are a\nway in which we create an external\nreflection of who we are to ourselves\nbut also\nthey are operating at a subconscious\nlevel to keep us for instance in a place\nof order like\nto be able to organize one's thoughts in\na world filled with statistical\ninformation every ray of sunshine is\nstatistical information we can't pay\nattention to all of it so i think that\num to directly answer your question\nthere are a couple of things i think\nfrom morning till night make it outsized\npositive effect on our nervous system\nboth in terms of its ability to feel\nthink and act and its ability to learn\nthe first one isn't so much a symbol\nunless you adopt it as one and i\ncertainly have which is\nthere are now thousands of quality\nstudies showing that\nwe should all try and get some bright\nlight ideally sunlight in our eyes with\nwithin the early hours of waking this\ndoesn't necessarily mean waking with the\nsunrise although if you can do that\nthat's great some people wake up before\nthe sun comes out getting a lot of\nbright sunlight in one's eyes early in\nthe day puts a number of neurochemicals\nand hormones into a state of\nlet's just call it what it is positivity\nmood is enhanced immune system functions\nsleep is enhanced 16 to you know 20\nhours later and so on\nalso in the evening so the sun as a\nsymbol is very important but it's also\nanchoring our subconscious physiology\nbecause every cell in our body has a 24\nhour clock we need to time it to the\nrise and fall of the sun each day\nwhen human beings become\nmisaligned with that rising and falling\nof the sun bad things happen to the\nnerve system now fortunately it's very\neasy to fix there's a study done at\nuniversity of colorado taking college\nstudents camping i wish i had been a\nsubject in this experiment what they\nfound is that melatonin rhythms cortisol\nrhythms which can be a healthy thing we\nall have cortisol it protects us\nenergizes us dopamine epinephrine all\nthese rhythms of the body could be\nreinstated to their proper timing by\nwaking up and seeing the sun and going\nto sleep not too long after sunset\ndepending on time of year for two nights\nand two mornings\nand this lasted at least two weeks even\nthough people were getting artificial\nlight so i would say the symbol of the\nsun is not just um uh you know it's not\na trivial thing at all it's the anchor\nby which our our biology is designed in\nour psychology follows of course\nthat's a brilliant one by the way i\nthink you know many people who have\ntrouble sleeping many people have mood\nissues this enhances metabolism i mean i\ncould list it on and on and on people\nwill ask so i'll just put it out there\num\ntry and do this without sunglasses if\nyou safely can you don't stare directly\nat the sun never look at any light so\nbright that it's painful to look at you\ncan of course blink only takes a few\nminutes on a cloudless day if you're in\nthe uk in the depths of winter you're\nstill going to get more light coming\nthrough cloud cover by going outside\nthan you would indoors with bright\nlights on\nand it can take anywhere from two\nminutes to 30 minutes depending on how\ndark or bright it is outside\nsunglasses and excuse me eyeglasses and\ncontacts perfectly fine if you think\nabout if anything that just focuses\nlight onto the retina don't try and do\nthis through a window or a windshield\nbecause it filters out a lot of the\nlight that you want so the sun is a key\nsymbol\ni think if people could adopt that there\ni'm certain their physiology and\npsychology will benefit then in terms of\nphysical symbols\ni find it very useful and they're good\ndata if a you know if a picture is worth\na thousand words a movie is worth a\nbazillion pictures so having an image of\nsomething that makes you feel good and\nseeing that early in the day\ntremendously powerful having a mental\nimage of something in your mind is\nequally powerful because you also carry\nthat with you yeah and then if you do\nhave a meditative practice or even if\nyou don't being able to try and bring\nthe mind and the body into that\nexperience so taking a moment to look at\na photo of someone that you love or\nappreciate\nand or the actual person right and being\nable to actually sense that and feel it\nat a complete nervous system level it\nmight sound like kind of woo science but\nit's not the nervous system extends\nthrough the whole body yeah so the\nextent that you can make that a truly\nwhole body somatic experience yeah\nthat it leads to an outsized effect on\nthe just the ability of the nervous\nsystem to function and then of course we\nare bombarded all day with negative\nsymbols there's just no way around that\nbut we can buffer ourselves against\nthose negative symbols by very strongly\nassociating with certain things and here\ni'll just defer that great neurologist\nand writer oliver sachs had this\nobsession with minerals and stones he\nfelt they had personalities and he used\nto say that he had developed such a\nstrong relationship to them their touch\nespecially as he started to lose his\nvision later in life that the way they\nfelt and they made him feel safe they\nmade him feel good so these could be\ninanimate objects so find things that\nyou love\nand\nassociate the with with them on a\nregular basis and you are literally\nshifting your nervous system towards\nthis place of buffering yourself against\nnegativity and you're reinforcing the\nvery circuits that trigger the release\nof neurochemicals that make you feel\nbetter and some people might say well\nthen you're just kind of doping yourself\nup with your own chemicals but as a last\npoint here the neurochemical dopamine is\na very important and very misunderstood\nmolecule\nfirst of all it is the substrate by\nwhich epinephrine neural energy is\ncreated and people think of it as\ndopamine as just feeling good but\ndopamine is not about feeling good\ndopamine is the molecule of motivation\nand the desire to pursue additional\nthings in a particular line of life\nso when we positively associate with a\nsong a person a face an object\nthe sun rise\nwe don't just benefit from those\nactivities based on the effects of those\nactivities it's also what we believe\nabout those activities combined and the\nrelease of dopamine makes you more\ncapable of then leaning into life and\ngoing and doing other things and so it\nand these are not small effects right\nthe effect of a small even you know half\na percent increase in dopamine\ntransmission in the brain is the\ndifference between feeling like your\nlife is bleak and you can completely\nattack the day in the positive sense so\nfill your life with symbols you get\nwhat's wonderful is that you get to\ncurate what those are\nif you don't have access to them in your\nphysical environment they can be\nentirely internal yeah and when i think\nabout the great stories of the viktor\nfrankl's and the um yeah you know\nand people who have just overcome\ntremendous challenge\nthey've internalized symbols such that\nthe tiniest of things can actually evoke\nthis this dopamine release system and\ndopamine is just a generic\nneuromodulator it doesn't know anything\nabout your experience it only knows what\nyou believe about your experience and\nit's deployed according to what you\nbelieve about your experience so in\ntheory i could train my dopamine system\nto release dopamine every time i raised\nmy right hand if i genuinely thought\nthat that had if that has meaning for me\nand this is the art also of\nsuperstitions right this is why uh you\nknow people will engage in superstitions\nbecause they've built positive\nassociations with outcomes\naccording to a certain behavior so what\nyou start to realize is that the brain\nis making predictions about the external\nworld who's jay when's he coming back um\nyou know what objects are going to be in\nthe room this time versus next time if i\nsuddenly walk out in that painting over\nthere which i happen to love is now on a\ndifferent wall my nervous system would\nnotice that because it's but it's also\nmaking predictions about internal state\nand a lot of depression and anxiety is\nabout people feeling like oh when they\nfeel lousy that that lousy feeling is\ngoing to go on forever yes the way to\nrewire this is to understand that making\nand controlling predictions about how\nyou feel internally gives you a sense of\nagency and that sense of agency at the\nend of the day is just purely\nneurochemical so these are pretty\nstraightforward things to master i mean\nthat's mind-blowing to me because i've\nnever heard dopamine be explained that\nway well dopamine everything about\ndopamine release is learned yeah there\nare a few things like um\nall the ada all the ones that evolved\nfor us to be here uh okay so associated\nwith reproduction food sugar there's a\nvery powerful dopamine pathway in the\nbrain and in the gut\nbecause sugar has a nutritive value yeah\nright we should all probably be\ningesting less of it but you know you\nget it's a hardwired system um food when\nwe're hungry warmth when we're cold\nthose are hardwired but the dopamine\nsystem is designed to be trained up to\nassociate with anything yeah and this is\nhow a guy like uh you can meditate for\nlong periods of time and feel\nit i'm guessing there were times in\nwhich it felt brutal and there were\ntimes in which it felt incredible\nabsolutely um this is how a guy like\ndavid goggins can um you know punish\nhimself with running it\nyou know over and over and over and yet\nsomehow he's inverted that dopamine\ncircuit so that it feels like something\nhe either wants to do or that by\novercoming\nthe resistance to doing it he he gets a\ndopamine yeah release so\ndopamine is entirely a learned release\nsystem\nthere are a few things that trigger its\nrelease no matter what but and it i\nshould highlight drugs of abuse i was\njust about to say\nanything can become an addiction cocaine\namphetamine um excessive you know\npornography excessive dopamine release\nand the diabolical thing about dopamine\nunder those conditions is that the\nhigher the dopamine release the big\namplitude dopamine the bigger the crash\nalways it's the way the circuits are\ndesigned yeah now here we're talking\nabout self training in healthy amounts\nof dopamine yes non-addictive amounts of\ndopamine release or you could say mildly\naddictive patterns of behavior that\nserve us and the people around us well\nand in that case i think of that as kind\nof an adaptive addiction compulsion yeah\num and not one that we should\nnecessarily avoid absolutely i think\nthat for me the way i differentiate that\nand i think that's such a good\ndistinction that you're\nraising there because what you're\nbasically saying is we could convince\nourselves through the release of\ndopamine that anything is good for us\nand hence it can lead to addiction or it\ncan be these aspirational positive\nhabits for us and i think the way i've\nbeen able to at least differentiate\nis that which is good for me after\nthat which makes me feel good after i do\nit\nbecause that's that release of dopamine\nthat i'm experiencing after i do it is\nmore important than that which makes me\nfeel good before i do it i love that so\ni don't feel good before i go to the gym\nor maybe before i meditate or before i\neat a healthy bowl of protein and food\nthat's good for me but i always feel\ngood after it i love that and when i i\nfeel good before i stay up late at night\nand hope that we're gonna have a great\ntime i feel good before i eat a pizza i\nfeel good before i have loads of sugar\nbecause i have a massive sweet tooth but\nthen afterwards i feel the pangs of it\ni love that and it proves that um in\nyour heart you're a neuroscientist\nbecause there's something called\ndopamine reward prediction error this\nwas defined by a guy named wolfram\nschultz and others and it's an\nincredible thing and it can be made very\nsimple which is when we positively\nanticipate something\nthere is dopamine release i mean just\ntell kids that you're going for ice\ncream and you're seeing what is i'll now\nexplain is reward prediction error now\nyou get to the ice cream shop and it's\nclosed what happens is their dopamine\ndrops below baseline before they were\ntold they were going for ice cream\nif they're going to the ice cream shop\nand they have ice cream you might think\nthen they get even more dopamine but\nguess what if the ice cream isn't as\ngood or if one kid the ice cream cone\nfalls\nand they don't get another one what ends\nup happening is that\ndopamine is\nrelative to where they were just feeling\nit doesn't feel that great yeah and so\nthis is the\nthe diabolical nature of addictive drugs\npeople get a dopamine surge in\nanticipation of using and over time they\nget less and less of a dopamine surge\nbut the punishment signal as we say that\ncomes afterwards the trough afterwards\ngoes lower and lower and lower so it's\nlike a asymmetric seesaw it's not just\nback and forth it goes dopamine but then\nit goes punishment signal now you\nfigured it out because dopamine reward\nprediction error says that if you have\nless dopamine heading into something\nthan you do afterward\nthat tells the synapses the brain\nconnections that were involved to\nreinforce themselves and to engage in\nthat behavior again and this is also\nwhat happens with surprise if you go\nsomeplace you're not expecting you know\nwhat like let's let's go this place for\ndinner i don't know looks good and it's\namazing\nyou create a much bigger dopamine signal\nthan if i tell you jay i gotta take you\nthis place this is the best sushi in los\nangeles it's incredible that actually\nsets you up to not enjoy the meal as\nmuch yeah so we all should learn to kind\nof um control this dopamine knob you've\ndone it beautifully by simplifying it\ninto making sure that you get enough\nhappiness thrill excitement in\nretrospect that's the way to wire in\nhealthy behaviors and i i've never\nactually heard it put as succinctly as\nyou because academics are not trained to\nbe succinct as you can tell but i think\nif everyone kept that in mind they would\ndo themselves a great service which is\ntry and ask whether or not the pla you\nhad as much or more pleasure in the\naftermath of something as you did during\nand you will\nyou get two benefits one is you can\navoid addictive type behaviors\nand the other because you avoid that\ncrash if there's a dopamine release\nafter there's no crash and the other is\nthat you'll have a tendency to return to\nthat behavior over and over again this\nis also why i think a lot of people\nenter new relationships yeah and there\nis a well-established dopamine surge\nwith the early phase everything feels\npossible people feel like people go out\nand make purchases they're kind of manic\nright and it's a very exciting kind of\nmental illness that we all enjoy from\ntime to time but then\npeople start to enter the phase of real\nchallenge or oftentimes real challenge\nand if they can't make that transition\nseamlessly and they constantly focus\nback on how great things were and they\nlook at the differential it can be a\nkind of a dark picture and then people\nhave to start working on trying to\nreignite so to speak but the bigger the\ndopamine surge at the beginning the\nbigger the crash so i think that a\nwonderful model for relationship is also\nto\ntemper that dopamine release spread it\nout over time try and spread it out over\n50 years\nand you're home free now i'm not an\nexpert in relationship but it is\nabsolutely clear that dopamine is the\nhallmark of human bonding then you know\nearly on anyway then come the oxytocin\nand all the the feel-good warmth\nmolecules because dopamine fundamentally\nis about accessing things that are\noutside your immediate experience it's\nreaching for things beyond the confines\nof your skin a degree\nmoney a relationship that you're worried\nthat's developing and you're working on\nwhereas the serotonin and oxytocin\nsystem which i think most people have\nheard of are feel-good molecules they're\nassociated with things we already have\nknowledge of how wonderful our partner\nis knowledge of how much we love\nsomething or or how much we appreciate\nthe meal that we had so neither it's not\nthat dopamine is bad and\nand serotonin is good these are\nmolecules that have been built up in our\nsystem over time to allow us to\nestablish new relationships of all kinds\nto things and people and to ourselves\nand then to sustain them but that those\nbig dopamine peaks early on are very\nvery dangerous and we need to learn to\ntemper them and just spread that out\nover time it's a resource and we need to\nlearn to calibrate that resource andrew\nyou honestly you're just blowing my mind\nagain and again and again because\nthere are so many long-held beliefs that\ni have or techniques or tools that i've\nbuilt or mindsets that i've created and\nthat i share and and coach and\nand pass on from the studies that i've\ndone but i get so much joy out of seeing\ndeep study\nsupport those ideas i think i want to\nunpack a lot of the things you said the\nfirst thing i want to say is my new\nclaim to fame is that you said i'm an\nhonorary neuroscientist now so\ni'm gonna you you think like a\nneuroscientist because to be able to\nbatch things in time that way is a\nunique skill i'm not saying this for\nflattery but it makes you feel good even\nbetter like but the fact of the matter\nis being funny but i'm grateful but most\npeople think about experiences as one\nthing yeah we you know we went to costa\nrica it was amazing ah but and i'm sure\nit was and when dopamines flooding\nthrough your system there's also\nsomething really cool is it distorts\nyour perception of time it feels like\ntime goes by very very fast but in\nlooking back it seems like a lot\nhappened yeah think about when you're\nbored in the doctor's office waiting\nroom feels like it goes on forever and\nyou look back guess what happened\nnothing\nit's low dopamine state so dopamine\nactually acts as a it's like shooting a\nfilm at high frame rate yeah okay so\nit feels like a lot's happening you look\nback and and it it goes by very fast but\nyou look back a lot happen so you batch\nthings in time and this is fundamentally\nimportant to how we we work if we look\nat experiences only in terms of how we\nexperience them and not the aftermath we\nmiss a a huge portion of life and more\nimportantly we miss the opportunity to\naccess the right behaviors and thoughts\nyeah we can be very misled by things\nlike dopamine it's it's a uh\nit's really a a tricky molecule to work\nwith and we're all working with it no\none is immune from this of course right\nyeah but yes you are absolutely a\nneuroscientist that's my new that's my\nnew tagline wherever i go no i i have\nsuch a fascination with neuroscience and\ni hope that at one point in my life i\ncreate the time and space to deeply\nstudy and and study alongside we should\ndo an experiment it's genuine a desire\nin my life so i'm not sure it has a\nmind-body lab yeah ali krom's lab which\nis all about beliefs and how beliefs\nshape our physiology my colleague david\nspiegel in psychiatry studies hypnosis\nand brain states and beliefs and mind\nbody so stanford of course does all the\nyou know hardcore rigorous stuff around\nmolecular biology genetics etc deep\nsequencing but we also have a collection\nof people there that are very interested\nin mind body so we should design an\nexperiment yeah definitely i'd love to\nthat would be that's music to my ears uh\nunpacking more of what you said\nwhat i find so\ninteresting is that you said obviously\nthis painting that you like behind me\nand then you said if it was in another\nplace then you know it takes a bit of\ntime to reconfigure and recalibrate you\nknow what's going on here\nand when you look at our lives today so\nmuch of the anxiety that we experience\nis based on change\nor\nthe lack of being able to predict as we\ntalked about or unpredictability\nand we've long known kind of like what\nyou were saying before we've\nlong known that\nyou know things do not always stay the\nsame we realize that change is the only\nconstant that uncertainty is the only\ncertainty like we know these truths yet\nwe love holding on\nto\npredict even for me like when i walk\ninto this room i do predict that these\nthings will remain on the wall and the\nmics will be here and homer will have\nset up the lights and there's some\npredictability there which creates\nsecurity\nbut as we all know shifting and being\ngood with change is so integral\nwhat do we do with that like how do we\nstart opening up and being more\ncomfortable\nin the discomfort of change not just\ngrowth but just change in shifts that we\ndon't expect and predict yeah i think\ntwo ways um one i'll just go back to\nthis fundamental feature of the nervous\nsystem which is it's trying to make\npredictions so the reason why change is\nstressful even positive change believe\nit or not is quote unquote stressful i\nagree uh is because of this than the\nrelease of adrenaline and and associated\nmolecules with any time things change i\nmean if you look the psychologists have\nworked this out there's a hierarchy of\nstressors um and of course at the at the\ntop of that hierarchy are awful things\nthat we don't you know i think at the\ntop to be honest i think death of a\nchild is is perhaps the the greatest\nstressor divorce death of a loved one um\nthese kinds of horrible things that we\nwouldn't wish on anyone then\nas one goes down\nnot too far below you see things like\nmoving to a new home or apartment yeah\nyou think well that could be a great\nevent right birth of a new child and you\nthink wait a second i thought that's\nsupposed to be one of the greatest joys\nin life and indeed it is but it's\nstressful to the nervous system because\nso many things have to be reconfigured\nnot to say anything about the lack of\nsleep with a newborn and this kind of\nthing so\nchange is always going to force our\nbrain to make\nmore assessments of our environment one\nof the things that we can say about the\nbrain for sure is that once it learns\nsomething it likes to not have to think\nabout it when you walk because you\nalready know how to walk you don't think\nright left right left right left but\nwhen you learn how to dance a new step\nor something of that sort or a new skill\nsport skill you have to think about it\nand it's work and anytime we have to\nthink about behaviors and they aren't\nsimply reflexive that work as we call it\nisn't it's a combination of the release\nof things like adrenaline epinephrine in\nthe brain and body i should say from the\nadrenals in the body but also in the\nbrain from a little brain area called\nlocus ceruleus that is acts as kind of a\nsprinkler system for the brain to kind\nof wake up all brain areas saying okay\nlet's pay attention to a lot of stuff\nhere very basic system um but\nbut very fundamental system it's\nliterally a wake up system for the brain\nworks in parallel with the release of\nadrenaline into our body\nnow\none way to deal with change is to simply\nknow this right to understand that if\none feels stressed or agitated around a\nnew move or you have a partner who's\nreally stressed about a new move even\nthough it's exciting it should be\nexciting that that's perfectly normal\nbecause what they're experiencing is\nthis increase in agitation and alertness\nand it also makes it harder to enter\ndeep really relaxed states because the\nbrain is in a mode of predictions making\npredictions what's happening next\nthinking thinking thinking and one of\nthe things that's key to falling asleep\neach night and replenishing our ability\nto think and make predictions is the\nability to turn off thinking this is why\ni'm such a fan of what traditionally was\ncalled yoga nidro which literally means\nyoga sleep lying down it's a form of\nmeditation as you know and with\nbreathing etc um i i certainly i want to\npoint out that i have no desire to\nrename any of these ancient practices\nthese are beautiful practices they've\nbeen built up over thousands of years\nthe reason i call uh sometimes batch\nyoga nidra with so-called nsdr non-sleep\ndeep breast is that unfortunately\nboth in science and in traditional\ncultures around some of these behaviors\nthe language has become a barrier for\npeople to try them i agree i'm not\ntrying to wash away any of the the\nwonderful culture and tradition around\nthese i want to be very clear about that\nbut ultimately it it's about accessing a\nstate of mind as for anyone that's\nlistened to a yoga nidra script and i\nshould say i do nidra every day i have\nfor almost a decade now it's without\nquestion\nalong with viewing morning light\nsunlight the most powerful practice i\nthink i can recommend to anyone\nit\nis about as you always hear in a classic\nneed your script you move away from\nthinking and doing to being and feeling\nnow what is that if we take a\nneuroscience lens what is this thinking\nand doing being in feeling it's about\nshutting down on the prefrontal cortex\nwhich is making predictions what's\nhappening next right\nas we move into sleep you enter that\nkind of liminal state where things\nbecome disjointed right a cat flies\nthrough the room and then you might jerk\nyourself awake and it's kind of odd but\nthat's the state of not thinking and\ndoing and just being and feeling being\nin one's pure somatic experience so i\nwould say\nin order to\nmove through change designate 20 to 30\nminutes each day\nto put the brain into a state of\nnon-thinking non-doing and into a state\nof quote-unquote being and feeling so\nnot making predictions now\nthe tricky thing is when one is stressed\nthat's especially hard to do yeah and\nthis is why i think what is a technohan\nsaid you know what is that who said you\nknow um\nwhen stress you know meditate every day\nbut when stress meditate twice as long\nor something like that yeah yeah\nwhenever when i don't think i have time\nlike that is almost what i need to make\nthe time\nso this ability to turn off thinking\nenhances one's ability to enter sleep\nwhich is vital for mental and physical\nhealth obviously\nlearning etc for reasons we discussed so\ndevelop the ability to deliberately\ndisengage from thinking and doing and do\nthat during periods of low stress\nright 20 to 30 minutes a day even 10\nminutes a day of just learning teaching\noneself and practicing the art of\nturning off prediction\nis an incredibly valuable skill wow and\nthen the other one is to just understand\nthat we're being bombarded with\ncontextual change all the time you know\ni love instagram i teach science on\ninstagram i see you there daily yeah um\nand so scrolling on instagram is an\ninteresting experience because in five\nminutes you can look at a thousand\ndifferent contexts\nthe human brain has never dealt with\nthat kind of change before even when\ntelevision when i was growing up there\nwere three or four good channels then it\nwent to cable and then now you get onto\nan airplane or something you got 240\nchannels yeah that's that's a drop in\nthe bucket compared to what we can get\nin in a social media feed yeah so i\nthink we just need to be aware that the\nbrain can work with that\nbut then what you're turning on is an\nability to\nwalk into a new context and and figure\nit out the statistics imagine if an\ninstagram feed and i'm not demonizing\ninstagram i think they're wonderful i\nthink they provide a wonderful resource\ntruly but imagine if we walked out of\nthis room and it was a completely\ndifferent landscape it was a jungle then\nwe turned the corner and go into what i\nwould think was the kitchen and it was\nthe kitchen of the some you know some\nthomas keller uh\nrestaurant in new york turn the corner\nand all of a sudden we're underwater\nthat's social media and we can cope with\nthat so\nso if i think about it that way then i\nthink if we can cope with that then we\ncan cope with transitions in\nso-called real life with\nwith ease now some people have more\nsituational awareness than others they\nwalk into an environment and they're\nsensing all the things\nother people walk into an environment\nand they're very good at narrowing their\nattentional spotlight the latter group\nactually has a bit of an advantage they\nprobably wouldn't be so good as a\nspecial operator in the military that\nhas to develop situational advantage or\na police officer or a teacher but\nthey're going to be immensely good at\none-on-one interactions because they can\nmake the room disappear\nand so but we need both kinds of people\nand we\nall need to learn how to br sort of\nbrighten and broaden these attentional\nspotlights and narrow them as well and\ni'll just briefly say we are old world\nprimates as it turns out and we have the\ncapacity to do what's called covert\nattention yeah i can pay attention to\nyou but i can also notice that in my\nperiphery there's something else going\non so i've got two spotlights now but i\nam dividing my attention we can't do\nthree simultaneously but what i can also\ndo is decide to merge those two\nspotlights and intensify them and narrow\nthe aperture of my visual window and my\nauditory window so we should always\nthink of ours at our attention as two\nspotlights that can be very broad\nor it can be\nvery\nnarrowly focused and that we can overlap\nthem yeah and i think that's fantastic i\nthink we should all know how to do both\nyeah we should learn how to narrow the\naperture of our focus deeply engage but\nalso deliberately disengage and the\nprocess of falling asleep that we were\ntalking about before is the practice of\nlearning how to take that attentional\nspotlight\nmove those two apart and then\nd not dim them but extend that same\nluminosity out more broadly more broadly\nand then we're off to sleep yeah so so\nit's about deliberate control of the\nnervous system and unfortunately we all\nknow how to focus on something if we're\nvery stressed or excited by it\nmost people don't learn how to turn off\nthis focus and learn how to deliberately\ndisengage and one of my great hopes for\nhumanity is that children and adults\nwill learn how to deliberately disengage\nyeah because it benefits sleep which\nbenefits mental and physical health and\nalso if you think about it most of the\nbad things that we do to ourselves and\nothers and that people do to one another\nmost not all but most are from a\nheightened state of reactivity yeah\nwhere we're just not conscious yeah and\nthat's because our aperture our window\nof attention is too narrow we're not\ntaking in to account the full space and\ntime of what we're thinking about yeah\nand as a last point space and time are\nlinked in the brain uh if you have a\nnarrow visual focus you tend to have a\nnarrow time slicing right which makes\nsense if you think about like a little\nkid watching ants on the ground and then\ngets called into dinner and all of a\nsudden the way you batch time is\ndifferent when you're sleepy you tend to\nbatch things in big blocks\nokay or when you're bored big blocks of\ntime when you're very excited stressed\nor happily excited you're in that fast\nframe rate you've gone from 60 frames\nper second which i think is a\ntypical smartphone to a thousand frames\nper second\nwow so you're catching all the micro\nnuances but you're missing everything\nelse\nand and what i find most interesting\nabout that though is and and i read a\nstudy a few years ago and i don't know\nif it i don't know i can't remember\nwhere it's from but\nit said something along the lines of\nthat\ntoday in 24 hours we're exposed to more\ntragedy through the news or pain or\nstress whatever word we want to label\nthat as then we were in our entire\nlifetime 25 years ago\ni believe that sadly i yeah i think i\nhave to agree yeah and and what i found\nalso was that what you're saying and i\nlove this idea of we have these two\npoints of focus and putting it together\nor bringing out which i think is\nfantastic as a visual too\nthere's an element though that really\ndraws us in of judgment and criticism\nlike i find judgment i'm using judgment\nas the overall word criticism is a very\nspecific word but what really makes\nsomething harder like when we're\nprocessing thousand posts on instagram\nthe most difficult part is when judgment\ncomes in whether it's positive or\nnegative because that's what draws you\nin and i find that we have more things\nto judge\nand to make that many judgments in a day\nis quite exhausting and then to be\nexhausted by the number of\ntragic or\nstressful moments that we experience and\nlike you said that you know it's okay if\nwe're on instagram we're seeing multiple\nthings or we're seeing this kitchen into\nthis animation into this world\nbut when a lot of it is painful\nto deliberately disengage but remain\nconnected to reality i feel like that's\nsomewhere where people feel like they're\nin no man's land yeah and you know it\nit's a particular challenge now yeah\nwith the number of images and movies\nthat can come at us and and\nyou know i think that uh\nhere i\ni'm not one to to usually talk like this\nbut i think much of\nbuilding a good life\nis about both honoring and challenging\nthe asymmetries of our nervous system\nwhat i mean by that is you know\neverything we've talked about up until\nnow are\nwired into us from birth we have\ndopamine epinephrine these circuitries\nwe get an intentional spotlight that all\nwe show up in the world with that and we\nand we have to work with them we also\nneed to acknowledge\nthat there is an asymmetry to learning\nyou know before we talked about the gap\neffects and the two-stage process of\nneuroplasticity there are exceptions the\nexception is learning of negative things\nyou only have to touch the hot stove\nonce or the\nmetaphorically speaking the hot stove\nonly has to touch you once before and it\nchanges you so there's one trial\nlearning of negative experiences now\nonce we understand that asymmetry and\nonce we understand that negativity\nactually has a bit of a stronghold on\nour nervous system\nthen we accept i would hope we would\naccept the idea that then we have to\nwork a little harder to counter that or\nmaybe a lot harder in the same way that\nso-called highly palatable foods\nwhich is now because kind of science\ngeek speak for unhealthy highly\nprocessed foods because there's some you\nknow i do love fruits and vegetables and\nthere's some wonderful\nbaked goods let's see yes\ni love croissants so i don't want to\ndemonize highly powerful yeah highly\npalatable foods but but i think we could\nall do well to eat healthier foods and\nthey are not as rewarding in the short\nterm as some of these highly palatable\nfoods right and especially to the young\nnervous system you know there's you know\na milkshake or or uh um\ncandy just tastes better to these kids\nthan vegetables yeah for reasons that\nare hardwired into the nervous system\nbut we know that kids need their fruits\nand vegetables probably more than they\nneed candy okay so\nwe have to all learn to counter these\nbuilt-in asymmetries in our nervous\nsystem and as adults we probably thought\nwe had it made but then now we're\nbombarded with all this negative imagery\nand so the key is really\nthe symbols that we were talking about\nearlier to really build in positive\nsymbols\ninternal symbolic representations what i\nmean by that not just physical things in\nour environment and people but also how\nwe hold those things inside is so\nimportant i think this is what comes to\nthis notion of intentions it's work\nright right life and right action and\nall these things that we hear about it's\nwork it's it's working against\nthe tide that is pulling us toward\nnegativity that's in fact there's a\nstudy that was done in the 60s it was\npublished in the journal science there's\nan excellent journal that apex journals\nhad people with stimulating electrodes\nin their brain for reasons related to\nneurosurgery\nthese people could stimulate multiple\nareas of their brain one at a time\nand then they reported how they felt so\nthat the the human would stimulate and\nthey'd feel drunk or they'd stimulate\nanother area and they'd feel happy\nthey'd stimulate another area they'd\nfeel sad the fascinating we learned a\nlot about the human brain from these\nstudies the brain area that people\npreferred to stimulate the most this is\nreally going to upset a few people was\nthe one that led to anger and\nfrustration\nand you think to yourself well that's\njust terrible are we just doomed right\nyeah no well it turns out that anger and\nfrustration\nis a signal to the brain and body that\nyou need to do something in response to\nthat usually move away or move forward\nand and sort of enter an aggressive\nstate\nno one is trained right that's a like\nhabit like that's probably comes through\nin habit i think this is why people i\nspend more time um on instagram than i\ndo on other social media platforms but\nlisten\ni'm not embarrassed to say you go on\ntwitter and it's a more combative zone\nyeah it's just the nature of the beast\nthere it's a more combative zone in part\nbecause there are a lot of academics on\nthere\nit's more combative so i notice if i log\non to twitter i already get a little bit\nof an adrenaline surge it's like all\nright you're ready to fight and just\nknowing that we have this innate bias\ntowards frustration and anger and that\nkind of friction\nhopefully my wish is that it will allow\npeople to relax around that\nand to realize ah this is sort of like\nthe food that i immediately want to\nreach for that's the kind of dopamine\nsignal that you were talking about early\non but how am i going to feel afterwards\nyes how am i going to feel afterwards\nand i would say that 99 of online\ninteractions where people end up in\nthese ridiculous battles later both\nparties probably think well how did i\nget wrapped up in that that's absolutely\ncrazy you know you think you're scoring\nslam dunks on each other at the time but\nit's ridiculous yeah so i think the\nthing to understand is that we have\nthese asymmetries\nbut that we can learn to work with them\nthe way that a a really a i think a\nreally incredible psychiatrist he's done\na lot of work on trauma paul conte\ndescribes it\nin a different context is that\num and but and he's like in to my mind\nthe expert on trauma and just has done\nbeautiful work is that it's like those\nlittle kids toys where there's a little\nball bearing moving around in a maze he\ndescribed this to me so this is all paul\nconte he's an md and this is his work\nnot mine his words\nyou know\nthere are times in which we are like\nthat game where just a slight shift and\nall of a sudden the ball bearing goes\ndown you shoot and what we should all be\nstriving for is for you know slightly\nconcave and for it to kind of maybe move\naround a bit with the with the with the\nevents of life and what we hear and see\nthat's what we should be striving toward\nand that takes work\nsome people are naturally there but very\nfew people are natural but this is the\npower of meditation this is the power of\nnon-sleep deep rest this is the power of\ngood sleep or\nmost nights this is the power of\nexcellent social relationships this is\nthe power of mindsets and intentions\nthat stuff gratitude practices\nnone of that stuff is weak all of that\nstuff acts as a kind of a\nfoundation from which we can approach\nthings and go yeah the impulse is to get\npretty upset about that but i'm going to\nlean away from that very hard to do when\nwe're not tending to that those\nfoundational elements actually quite\neasy to do\nover time because it gives us the\nperspective and\ni think that if we understand that we're\nbeing bombarded with this it's like\nbeing at a buffet of junk food yeah but\nunderstanding that somewhere in that\nbuffet is really nutritious food and\nthat's what we should be aiming for and\nlearning to kind of override the the\nnatural signals of oh i really want that\nand i really want that by thinking about\nexactly what you said earlier which is\nhow am i going to feel afterward and\nwhat what's that that's dilating our\nperception of time we're getting out of\nthat slave to dopamine mode and we're\nstarting to think about no i'm not going\nto let dopamine control me i'm going to\ncontrol dopamine and that's powerful\nyeah i i what that sparks for me is also\nthis idea that i've\nbeen in love with for a while is\nfragility and strength and how\nnot being exposed to something\ndoesn't protect you but it makes you\nweaker it absolutely does and you know\nnowadays there's a big interest in\nso-called dopamine fasts i i think they\nhave their place you know if people been\nhave been engaging in things that are\nhigh dopamine evoking behaviors there is\na place for this this is one of the\nroutes to sobriety beautiful work by my\ncolleague at stanford uh dr anna lemke\nshe wrote dopamine nation incredible\nbook about dopamine in the context of\naddiction but all kinds of addiction\nuh she talks about this there is a role\nfor dopamine fast really moving away\nfrom intensely pleasurable activities\nfor about 30 days is necessary for some\npeople to reset yeah but it's naive for\nany of us to think that then you go back\ninto the world and you're not being\nbombarded with temptation of different\nkinds i mean the whole idea is to\nbring the system back into balance so\nthat you can notice the subtle\ninflections right i guess the the the\nmeditators and yogis i always loved the\nlanguage they used would be the kind of\nsubtle\nafter meditation you can notice the kind\nof subtle ripples in life right whereas\nif you're just hard charging all the\ntime you miss so much yeah again i'm\nusing that oh yeah beautiful yeah but i\nthink that um so dopamine fasts have\ntheir place\nbut better to have your hands on the\nsteering wheel accelerator and break of\nall these mechanisms and to go through\nit's only when you know the car has been\nwrecked that it needs to go into the\nrepair shop most of us don't need a\ndopamine fast we need to understand how\ndopamine works we need to do exactly\nwhat you described earlier which is to\nextend the time domain so that we think\nabout am i getting dopamine later also\nor is this just a quick up and down kind\nof event\nthen i think we can move through life in\na much more adaptive way and then you\nmentioned obviously when we talk about\nrelationships\nyou know we talked about how\ndopamine is there at the beginning but\nthen we talk about serotonin and\noxytocin these inner feelings which i\nlove that description also of like how\ndopamine is this pursuit of external\nthings and oxytocin and serotonin and\nmore about how we feel what we have i\nthink that was a another great visual\nand i love how you speak in symbols more\nthan you know like they're you know it's\ni really everything you've been sharing\ntoday\ni can visualize and i really enjoy\nvisual learning and so when you were\nspeaking earlier about how you can\nvisualize a symbol even if you don't\nhave it physically and even when you\nsaid that to me i'm like oh that's\nreally fascinating that dopamine is that\noxytocin and serotonin is this with\noxytocin and serotonin\nwe know that a lot of the habits you\njust mentioned they are what\ncreate this balance right so the reason\nwhy people talk about decreasing\ndopamine i guess is because we've\nnoticed that dopamine is shooting\nthrough the roof and often what we do\nfor oxytonin oxytocin and serotonin are\nnot really that balanced across the\nboard\nwhat are\nlet's look at relationships and go is\nthere a need to have dopamine in\nlong-term relationships or are serotonin\nand oxytocin enough and not just\nrelationships that applies to career it\napplies applies to everything i feel\nyeah absolutely um there's a wonderful\nbook about this written by a\npsychoanalyst in a slightly different\ncontext the book um the title of the\nbook is can love last and and it's an\ninteresting book\nit's it operates on the premise that\nwhen we first meet somebody and we want\nthis in the context of a romantic\nrelationship and we desire a romantic\nrelationship with them it's very much\nabout objectification of the other\nperson and i don't mean objectification\nin the traditional sense but we don't\nrely on them yet yeah right we only rely\non the ability to pursue and get them\nright or for them to for us to pursue\nthem however\nexactly but we don't rely on them for\nsafety at all\nif that evolves to become a\nromantic relationship right with trust\nthen what happens is there's a true\ndependency there if one person were to\nleave for any reason die or leave or\ncheat or break up it is truly\ndevastating to the safety mechanisms of\nthe brain and body right it's a\nreactivation actually of a lot of the\nmachinery that was designed for\nattachment between infant and parent\nright is it just as an important aside\nthe the all the work on attachment that\nwas done by bowlby and maine and others\nin psychology of taking\ndeliberately taking babies away from\ntheir mothers and then reuniting them\nand evaluating the responses batching\nthem into different all that circuitry\nisn't lost as we grow up it's repurposed\nfor a romantic attachment there's no\nquestion about that\nno question about that we just operated\ninto different domains of anxiety\nbecomes about waiting for a text message\nas opposed to you know mother to come\nback in the room or or nursing etc\nso same circuitry reapplied\nas we advance into relationships we\nbecome more dependent on people but\nthe idea and that it's touched on quite\na lot in this book can love last is that\nthere is a need from time to time in\nsome relationships to bring the dopamine\nelement back in now certain cultures\nhave actually built this in in a very\nstrategic way of actually having men and\nwomen not physically contact one another\nfor several weeks out of each month in\norder to maintain the kind of quote\nunquote excitement of a relationship\nnowadays we tend to have this model of\nlover and best friend and sometimes even\nbusiness partner right literally which\nfor some people can work and for other\npeople can quash all the excitement\nright it really depends and especially\nnowadays where people are working a lot\nmore from home\nthere isn't a tendency for people to\nspend much time apart and to miss one\nanother missing one another the yearning\nfor the other person is a beautiful\nthing yeah it's a painful but beautiful\nthing what is that yearning that\nyearning is the pain of the lack of\ndopamine and serotonin i actually just\ncame back from a trip and we were\nvisiting a couple friends of ours and\nthey said it was very beautiful they\nsaid they've been together a long time\nthey said they've had three nights apart\nin their entire relationship wow and one\nof them got sick during that time apart\nand i thought that's beautiful now for\nsome people that's a beautiful model for\nother people that would be excessive and\nit actually could eliminate a number of\nthe positive neurochemical features of\nthe relationship yeah and there's a lot\nof variation around this so dopamine is\nrequired to quote unquote re-up yeah\nexcitement in a relationship how is that\nachieved well dopamine is the molecule\nas you recall of reward prediction error\nof novelty so doing things that are not\nexpected\nis great routine is great for serotonin\nand oxytocin predictability routine\npredictability same thing\nsafety routine predictability\nserotonin oxytocin system no question\nabout it\ndopamine is the neurochemical of novelty\nand pursuing new things so for couples\nthat are very set in their ways and feel\nvery safe and homey together wonderful\nbut creating ways in which they miss one\nanother or creating new experiences for\nthem to kind of re-up the dopamine in\nthe relationship can have a tremendously\npositive effect and i look forward to a\nday where neuroscience is actually\nincorporated into\nrelationship design in an intelligent\nand respectful way that they're\nrespectful meaning that there are\ndifferences but we see a lot that people\nwill just go out and get a new\nrelationship right i'm of the mind that\nunless you know it's there it's\ndangerous situation better to probably\navoid divorce right um certainly for\nsake of children some\ni've heard of course that divorces can\nrescue relationships too i understand\nthere's a lot of nuance but i think\neveryone would prefer emotionally\nfinancially et cetera to be able to be\nin a great relationship for a long\nperiod of time yeah and so i think that\nunderstanding the the the push-pull\nbetween dopamine and serotonin is key\nand just to remember that missing\nsomeone yearning for someone is the\nanticipation of how great it's going to\nfeel when together absolutely i think\nthat that that could go a long way and\nalso for people that get very very very\nexcited about the new person the new\nthing\njust be\nwary that not everyone's dopamine system\nworks the same way yeah and with\ndopamine it's great to have increases in\ndopamine but where it passes a threshold\nand it's very big peaks where there's a\npeak there's a crash and the crash is\nalways asymmetrically deeper than the\npeak there is no way around this and so\nlearn to temper the excitement if you're\nan excitable person yeah and uh and i\nwould say learn to\nramp up the excitement a little bit if\nyou're somebody who's not so easily\noverwhelmed yeah definitely i mean me\nand my wife we've been married for six\nyears and nearly together for ten which\nyou seem to have an amazing from the ex\nfrom the outside yeah as in i would say\ni always like to clarify that i don't\nthink\nyou know i grew up wanting a hollywood\nromance and i\nmy views of love were defined by movies\nand music and i realized that is not\nwhat love looks like i told her my wife\nhas been a great teacher to me in that\nspace of showing me what a beautiful\nrelationship can look like but it\ndoesn't look like how we think it is and\ni think often when people see me and my\nwife they may think we have\nthat one version too and i would just\ni'm very careful about the idea that we\nhave a fantastic relationship but it\nisn't fantastic for the reasons that tv\nor movies has convinced us that\nrelationships are good but we spend\naround three months apart every single\nyear not by design or choice just by\nwork and life\nand i haven't seen my wife for the last\nthree months there will be one more\nmonth before i see it so the yearning is\nreal i cannot wait to see but at the\nsame time i get too focused on myself i\nget to have alone time i get to refill\nand refuel myself i get to discover new\nparts of my identity i get to learn a\nnew skill like so many healthy and of\ncourse we don't have children yet so we\ndon't have that responsibility um but\nbut\ngoing to what you said i see so much\nvalue in in how we can be open to these\nideas i think that's the point that it's\nnot about\nthere's one size fits all or one right\nway\nbut i want to shift andrew with uh our\nconversation to something you brought up\nearlier because um and and if you don't\nfeel comfortable why we don't but i i\nheard and i i've become aware that you\nare you have tattoos yeah you have\nsymbols yeah tim ferriss outed me on his\npodcast yeah thanks tim uh yeah i do i\num you know i grew up uh a child of an\nacademic and um\nuh but then when i was a teenager i got\ninvolved in skateboarding punk rock\nmusic i still have a lot of friends in\nthat world so the photographer for our\npodcast is from dc and nike\nskateboarding mike blayback have good\nfriends in that world uh become friendly\nwith guys like danny way and uh you know\nit's um amazing one of the greatest\nskateboarders of all time by the way i\nmean he and i aren't close friends but\nwe become friendly and um for me that's\nand you know i grew up in that and yeah\nthose were cultures that made a lot of\nsense to me given where i was at the\ntime and they'd have always felt to me\nlike my first non-biological family so i\nstarted getting tattooed pretty young uh\ntoo young and i will say to all of those\nout there that are thinking about it\nthink carefully\nyeah it is they are permanent um things\nhave changed around this i always cover\nup my tattoos for the following reason\num when when doing uh public facing work\nwhich is that\num\ngenerally when i'm trying to teach\nneuroscience i'm trying to download\nideas and transmit them so i just want\nto avoid any distractions about the\nsymbols that are meaningful to me\nbecause they just aren't relevant in\nthat context um i have a good friend who\nexplained it this way he said well you\nknow maybe tattoos should be an\nimportant part of the hiring process\nbecause\nrather than covering them up if you have\na lot of tattoos it is evidence that you\ncan sit still for a long period of time\nwhile in intense pain so that's true\ni'll also say this um i was fortunate to\nknow good tattooers a good tattoo there\nare there's a range yeah\nyes and um and along the lines of them\nbeing permanent i will also say that uh\nblack and gray lasts longer doesn't fade\nthan color so\ni'll say well what's your most uh\nwhat's the symbol on your body and i'm\nsure you have many but if you were to\npick one not your favorite but one that\nfeels really meaningful right now in\nyour life yeah well first of all it's\nfunny because people often will say what\nare you going to do when you're like 60\nor 65 you got all these tattoos and i\njust think okay well first of all now i\nhave an incentive to stay in shape yeah\nand second of all um you know i actually\nworry about them disappearing because\nthen i'd have to have them all redone\nand they were pretty painful it took a\nlong time i got a lot of them so uh took\na long time it's been\n25 years or more of getting tattooed so\num i can't pick just one but i do have a\npicture of my uh bulldog mastiff\ncostello and a paw print of his life\nsize or actual size i love that and i\nloved that dog i had to put him down um\nyeah and it was just you know the last\nline in the contract of good dog\nownership is that you're going to put\nthem down before they're in suffering\nand it was a it actually turned out to\nbe a beautiful\ntransition i i did it you know in a\nbeautiful location he went easy and i\ndon't talk about too long because i'll\ncry out of love i notice i i still cry\nwhen i think about him but it's not\nsadness it took me like three months to\nrealize that i was like i always cry\nwhen i talk about costello or i want to\ncry and i realize it's because i love\nhim the feeling isn't sad\nhe just he had such an incredible that's\nthat symbol that creates a physical\nexactly i feel it in my heart right now\nand anyone that knows me i i i loved\nthat dog like crazy so there's that one\nand then um and i don't want to focus on\nnegative things but again it's a feeling\nof love i talked about these three\nadvisors that i had earlier\ni was blessed with amazing advisors and\nsadly uh first one died of suicide\nsecond one cancer who i was very close\nto my third one cancer so the the morbid\njoke among people that know me is you\ndon't want me to work for you now i can\nmake that joke because all three of them\nhad an incredible spirit about life so i\nactually have all of their initials or\nsymbols of them tattooed on my body and\ni miss them every day but i also you\nknow i think there is something powerful\nto embedding something in your body some\npeople wear pendants um obviously some\npeople decide to get tattoos um\nand\nyou know\ni've been encouraged at times people\nlike you know just show your tattoos be\nout there with them i want to be very\nclear i'm not ashamed of them at all i'm\nproud of them oh yeah i don't think that\nyeah but for me if i'm teaching or i'm\ntrying to be an educator i really want\nto emphasize the information i also\nthink listen the world's a complicated\nplace and we can't always control\npeople's interpretations of why we do\nthings so for the young people out there\nthinking about getting tattoos um just\nunderstand that's the world we live in\nalthough i think nowadays people are are\nmore accepting so yeah thank you for\nsharing both yeah thank you i wanted\nthat more i just\nappreciate hearing about because we\nspoke about symbols and yeah and and\nthat for that reason i really wanted to\nunderstand the symbols that you know\nyeah for me something about having you\nknow um\nhaving experiences that i've\nexternalized to the surface of my body\nit feels right it's weird they feel like\nmy skin now yeah i feel like birth marks\ni never look at in i don't get up in the\nmorning look in the mirror and go like\nthere's a tattoo and there's a tattoo\nnormally i just think like oh yeah like\nit's just it just kind of becomes part\nof you\nas you know because obviously you yes i\nonly have three i had a plan it's not\nthe number it's the i had the plan to\nhave my whole upper body tattooed when i\nwas younger and then i became a monk so\ni haven't had any since yeah uh but up\nuntil i got my first one i was 16.\nsecond one i was 18 and the last one\nwhen i was like 21. okay and i did them\nall and then i became a monk and then i\nhaven't had any since yeah and my wife's\nbeen the other way around like since\nwe've been married she's had like she\nhad one before we met and i she had like\nseven more so she's great yeah\ni don't wear any jewelry except a watch\nbut yeah tattoos for me have been um\nit's been a fun journey and i i'm 46\nyears old now so i i plan to keep going\nyou know i love that yeah there's\nthere's at this point it's um it's i\nsuppose it's neuroplasticity it's built\ninto me\nandrew you've been so kind gracious with\nyour time uh\ni am\nyou know i i've always known how\nphenomenally intelligent and smart and\nsharp and\ndeeply studied you are but i'm really\ngrateful i got to experience your heart\ntoday in so many ways and uh\nto me that\nthat beautiful synergy you have is is\nreally uh meaningful to me to experience\ni'm so grateful to\nyou for being here for taking the time\nfor for me we've been in touch for a\ncouple of years maybe even it's been or\nyou know through messaging but to really\nexperience you in full today has been\nbeen a treat for me uh we end every\non-purpose episode with a final five\nthese have to be answered in\none word to one sentence maximum\nwhich for this academic might be it\nmight be hard but we will try so andrew\nhuberman these are your final five\nuh the first question is what is the\nbest advice you've ever received in any\narea of life know thyself right the\noracle said that and it's absolutely\ntrue we have to be good scientists of\nourselves\nand understand where we have\ntalents competency\nand or challenges and then work with\nthose beautiful all right second\nquestion what is the worst advice you've\never received or heard\nthat everything is just experience you\nknow the idea that all experiences are\nequivalent um i would love to think that\num\nall our steps lead us to enlightenment\nkind of thing but we have i do believe\nthat we or at least i need to be far\nmore intentional than that and that we\ncan be beautiful question number three\nwhat is something that you didn't value\nbefore but you've learned to value now\nalmost embarrassed to say it but um\nfamily you know i've relied very heavily\non friendship as a deep source of of uh\nreinforcement in my life i've leaned\nhard into that for many many decades um\ni think in recently i've become quite\nmoved by the the supports within my\nfamily that i hadn't realized that uh\nreally set me up so well to um to do\nwhat i want to do in life beautiful i\nlove hearing that question number four\nwhat's the\nfirst thing you do in the morning and\nthe last thing you do at night\nfirst thing i do in the morning is get\noutside and get sunlight and if the sun\nisn't up i flip on all the lights and\nthen i go get sunlight i also drink a\nglass of water before i go to sleep at\nnight\nyoga nidra you don't do that at night\nyou do not\ni actually\ni think about those three people i was\ntalking about before\ni do every night and just think about\nthem i don't know it's been a long time\nnow that accumulated over several\ndecades and um yeah i think about them\nevery night i love that i don't even\nthink to do it i just do it just trying\nto yeah i've i've a i lost one of mine\nmentors the others are still alive right\nnow one of them to stage four brain\ncancer and just couple of years ago\nand i i when you said that i was like\nyeah i know yeah no that feels like so\nyeah all right uh fifth and final\nquestion if you could create one law or\nset one habit that everyone had to do\nevery day for the rest of their life\nwhat would it be i think i know it's\ngonna be but i have to ask you well\nsince most people assume it's sunlight\nviewing and i'll just i'll just assume\nthey're doing that anyway\ni would\ndie a happy person if people would adopt\na practice\nof\nlearning to deliberately\ncalm down\nwhether or not through non-sleep\ndepressed or a couple deep breaths\nfind a tool\nbecause i really believe that much of\nthe misfortune and pain of life could be\navoided if people learn to calm down i\nalso know that there's a lot more joy to\naccess when we do andrew you're\nphenomenal you blew my mind multiple\ntimes today i hope this
