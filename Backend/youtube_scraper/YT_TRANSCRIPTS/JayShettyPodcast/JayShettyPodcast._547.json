    "transcript": "the truth is we used to have this the\nsaying in the secret service the truth\nis simple you don't have to work so hard\nbut so when somebody's really working\nhard to sell you something\nthat's when your red flags are up\ntoday's guest is none other than evie\npomporos now she is a former secret\nservice special agent she was part of\nthe protective details for president\nbarack obama and first lady michelle\nobama as well as former presidents\ngeorge w bush william j clinton and\ngeorge h bush she worked complex\ncriminal investigations and undercover\noperations executed search and arrest\nwarrants and investigated both violent\nand financial crimes ebby currently can\nbe seen as an assessor on the bravo\nseries spy games if you've not seen it\ncheck it out now today i'm excited to\ntalk to evie about her amazing new book\ncalled becoming bulletproof protect\nyourself read people influence\nsituations and live fiercely and inside\nshe shares the lessons from protecting\npresidents as well as insights and\nskills from the oldest and most elite\nsecurity force in the world to help you\nprepare for stressful situations\ninstantly read people and really make a\ndifference in your life evie holds a\nmaster of science from columbia\nuniversity in journalism a master of\narts in forensic psychology from augusta\nuniversity and a bachelor of arts in\npolitical science and international\naffairs from hofstra university and as\nyou can see super academic super\npractical and someone who literally in\ntwo seconds has made me realize she's\nalso just really nice and kind uh evie\npomporous evie thank you for being here\nhi jay thanks so much for having me you\nare such an accomplished incredible\nindividual\nthat the life that you've lived just\nabsolutely fascinates me i don't even\nknow how where to begin to be honest and\nthat's not usually me i usually know\nexactly where to start but also what i\nlove about it evie is and we've never\nmet before and i really hope that one\nday we do get to meet but even just\ninteracting with you now like how is\nthis person lived in such a\ntough\nstressful job yet your energy is so\nsweet and kind and soft and loving like\ntell us about that just to start it off\nwith how does that work i think though\npeople feel that there's only one\nversion of themselves like you're just\none thing\nand it's not true\nlike there's different versions of us\nand i learned this over time\nbecause i would hear people say i'm just\ngoing to be myself and i always wonder\nlike what is myself\nand i really didn't understand this it\nwas when i became a polygraph examiner i\nbecame an interrogator for the u.s\nsecret service\nand then i would interview so many\npeople jai like hundreds of people would\ncome through the door\nand i learned that i couldn't be one\nthing with\neverybody\nand that people respond to different\nthings and need different things from\nyou\nand so some people needed a more\nsensitive version of me\nsometimes i needed to bring out a more\nauthoritative version of me\nbut\nyou you assess people and you fear you\nyou realize all right who's my audience\nand what's going to resonate best with\nthis audience but it's still authentic\nit's still me\nand i found that when i started to do\nthis i began doing this at work\nbut then i began doing it in my\nrelationships\nand i realized that it actually\nstrengthened my relationships and\nstrengthened my communication skills\nwith people because i was really\npaying attention to people\nand becoming in tune to them so if i had\nsomebody who was soft-spoken and shy i\nwould say okay\nthis is not a person that\nsecret service devi would really\nneed to be with or to to to be that type\nof person but at the same time like you\ncan still be strong and you can still be\nassertive\nand you don't have to be a jerk about it\nyou know you can still have\ngrace and kindness\nand connect with people\nand there's actually\npart of my studies when i studied\ninterviewing and interrogation and it's\nreally about connecting with people\npeople you're interrogator and you think\nof the\nthe tv stuff and it's it's not like that\nat all but one of the things that was\ntaught is that\nthe most successful interviewers like\nthose people that would get confessions\nor admissions or information from people\nthey were the ones that were perceived\nto be competent\nand then warm\nso\nbeing fear-based making people fearful\nof you\nintimidating people being cold thinking\nthat that is going to get people to\nlisten to you more it actually backfires\non you\nyou you're already blowing my mind what\na great answer right i couldn't agree\nwith you more and i love what you said\nabout\nhow it can still be authentic even if\nyou're adapting because i think people\nfeel like if you're using techniques\nthen how can you be a you know how can\nyou care but if you're doing it from a\nplace of compassion and a place of\nconnection and a place of wanting to\nunderstand then that's what brings the\nauthenticity am i right does that make\nsense\nyeah it does because but that's but\nthat's what drives me i think\nyou know i mean think of it this way you\never go to a meeting or have a\nconversation with someone and it's just\nbumping heads confrontationally you're\nthinking\nwhy did that happen that way it's\nbecause both people are trying to\nshove their ideas and their perceptions\nalmost like down the other person's\nthroat and it doesn't\nit doesn't resonate\ni one one of the things i found like the\nbest in interviewers were the people\nthat uh\nthat made people feel understood like\nusually we just want to feel understood\nand some people want to feel understood\nand they're very aggressive about it\nlike you'll have someone maybe just yell\nand scream and\nyou know give you their\nopinion on something but what they're\nreally telling you is like i'm not being\nheard and so i'm screaming and i'm\nyelling because i want to feel heard\nand once people feel hurt and if you\ncannot take it personally and think you\nknow how dare you talk to me this way if\nyou can put your ego aside and he goes a\nbig sabotager but if you can put that\naside and just understand\nthis doesn't have to do with me this has\nto do with this person\nthey're not feeling heard by me or by\nanybody\nso let me kind of sit back\nbe quiet and listen and let that\nresonate with them\nand then after that's done\nyou know come back in a more meaningful\nway i can't tell you how many times i\ni sit in the interview room and people\nwould just be angry they're angry that\nthey're there they're angry that they're\ntalking to a special agent they're angry\nthat they're talking to me\nthey're just angry and\nrather than bump heads and try to put\nthem in their place because truly that\nwould be my ego doing it i'd say like\nall right let me just sit back let me\nlet them vent honestly\nand then once that was done and the\nsteam came out and you know they're\nexhausted too\nthen i could really come in in a\nmeaningful way and now they've also told\nme what's resonating with them what\nthey're upset about\nand when i speak to them i can make sure\nthat i i'm thoughtful in my conversation\nrather than coming in blind and just\npulling things out of nowhere and then\nsaying the wrong thing so\nlook could you use this to me manipulate\npower uh people like you know yes you\ncould but\nit's gonna backfire on you because\npeople can read through that nonsense\neventually\nbut if you use it in a way to connect\nwith people and you can use compassion\nor empathy i use empathy so much\nit draws information out of people\nbecause\nwhen you empathize with people you build\nrapport\nthen they trust you and the more people\ntrust you the more they open up\nand that is truly\nthat's interrogation that the best\ninterrogator so to speak and i use\ninterviewing and interrogation\ninterchangeably because in the world i\ncame from truly it's the same thing it's\na conversation\nwith people but when you can when you\ncan do that\neverybody opens up to you and you get\nwhat you want whether it's me wanting a\nconfession or admission or information\non the case\nor even doing a business deal you know\nand i work in television and negotiating\nterms\ni make sure to hear what that other\nperson is saying\nbefore i say hey let me tell you what i\nwant because also when i hear that i'm\nthinking okay this is what's important\nto them\ni can bend on this because i'm not\nworried about this so much but this is\nwhat's what's important to me so i'll\nbend here\nbut i won't bend here and so you can\ncome in a more meaningful way and\nconnect with people\nyeah do you do you ever find that people\nin your personal life because they know\nyour skills and know what you are\nthey're like always feeling a bit like\noh no evie can tell what i'm really\nthinking like do you find that people\nkind of sometimes like put their guard\nup when they're around you because they\nthey feel like oh heavy can see right\nthrough me\nyou know it's interesting some people\nwill say that actually let me say this\nmy family now they just do whatever they\nwant to be so\ni'll just put that out there i don't\nknow why it is but we can have like\ndegrees and expertise but when it comes\nto family\nnone of that matters it's true it's true\nvery good i want to hear it yeah but\ni think it's about\nconnecting with people and i don't but\nit's genuine you know i i genuinely\nlisten to people because i\ni i want to know what they think i care\nabout what they think\nand so when it comes from an authentic\nplace i don't think people see that but\nwhen it looks like manufactured when it\nlooks like and it feels like someone\nsell you some selling you something\nyou've probably had that we've all had\nthat where you feel like somebody\nalright this person's trying to sell me\nreally hard and if\nif something's truthful and genuine\nyou don't have to sell so hard you know\nthe truth is we used to have this the\nsaying in the secret service the truth\nis simple\nit's simple you don't have to work so\nhard but so when somebody's really\nworking hard to sell you something\nthat's when your red flags are up that's\nwhen you're kind of like\nwhy is this person working so hard\nsomething's not right tell me how you\neven get to the point before we dive\ninto the book and i'm really excited for\neveryone who's just tuning in and\nwatching or listening right now\nwe are talking about evie's new book\ncalled becoming bulletproof which is all\nabout protecting yourself reading people\ninfluencing situations and living\nfearlessly we're going to put the link\nin the comment section so you'll be able\nto buy the book uh if you're loving this\nconversation so eddie before we even\ndive into the book i just want to talk a\nbit about how you even get there like\nhow do you even become\nthe role that you became like what does\nthat process take what did you want to\ndo growing up and how did you find\nyourself you know becoming such a\nsuccessful\nsecret agent tell us about that journey\nin that process\nyeah i will tell you one thing work\nwork\nand more work\ntruly like i\nmy parents are immigrants they came from\ngreece\nand\nyou know they were very poor they grew\nup in poverty in greece my parents were\nvery very poor\nand they came to the united states\nand we lived in new york city i was born\nin harlem washington heights area which\nwas a very high crime very poor area\nand\ngreek was actually my first language i\nlearned english in school\nand we\ni think we grew up around crime a lot of\ncrime a lot of drugs\ni saw the difficulties my family faced\nas immigrants you know they had\nhad very heavy accents you know even my\ndad you know i would see the hardships\nhe would go through\nin fact when he came to america he\ncouldn't find a job\nnobody wanted to hire him he had like a\nreally thick accent you know i'm quite\nfair but he was uh quite tanned very\ndark very ethnic looking and\nhe they went through such hardship but\nin his first job actually in america\nhe he finally had gone through so many\nplaces i remember nobody would give him\na job and the last place he went to was\na donut shop a coffee shop in harlem\nand he went in there he's like\njust i'll work for free\nbecause the guy was trying to i didn't\nwant to give him work and he's like i\nwork for free i work for food he's like\nlet me just get experience here so at\nleast i can go somewhere else and say\nhey i have experience working\nin a donut shop selling coffees or he's\nlike i'll take your trash i'll do\nwhatever\nand my first my father's first job in\namerica was working for free he worked\nfor free and i think it was after a few\nweeks that the man actually hired him\nand so i think growing up\nwith that and seeing the hardship they\nwent through\ni was like\ni\ni'm not going to go through that\nand i want to make a better life for\nthem\nand i was like you know when i watch\nyou know it sounds silly but we watch a\nlot of tv because we couldn't we\ncouldn't really play outside that much\nand i would see on tv these people doing\nextraordinary things in extraordinary\nroles and i i went to greek school i\nwent to a greek american school and i\nlearned about greek mythology and heroes\nand i was so inspired by it you know\nlike when you're a kid you're like when\ni grow up i want to be this\nand i was inspired by courage and by\nbravery\nand\nhaving grown up you know we've been\nvictims of crime and dealt with so many\nhardships i was like i am not going to\ngrow up afraid\ni'm not going to grow up weak\ni'm going to protect my family you know\ni'm going to do well so i can help take\ncare of them\nand i think just intuitively it led me\ninto this career because i knew nothing\nabout law enforcement jay i didn't even\nlike police they would pull me over when\ni was a teenager and i was like the\nbiggest\nbrat\ni i knew nothing about that world but\ni knew i wanted to serve people and help\npeople and\ni created this drive where i was just\nlike work work hard work hard work hard\nand even in college\nyou know i got an internship working for\na congresswoman i'll never forget\ncongresswoman carolyn mccarthy\nand i worked for her\nfor two years\nfor free\nfor free\nand everybody's like you're crazy you're\nwasting your time and i was like no\ni'm learning i'm connecting with people\nthat i would never j i would never\nconnect to these people i had no network\ni had no access all i knew was my my\nparents immigrant community\nand no college of education i don't even\nthink my mom finished high school\nactually now that i'm talking or my dad\nand i was just like\ni have a choice and i have to drive\nmyself\nand i think just one thing led to\nanother i didn't grow up with this idea\nwhen i grew up i'm gonna be a secret\nservice agent i had no idea what that\nwas zero\nand but i also\nwas of the mindset like\nwhy not like why why can't i\nwhy can't i help my family and other\npeople in a meaningful way and i think\nwhen you're in the struggle and you see\nother people struggle and i think just\nauthentically i wanted to\nto help myself\nhelp my family\nand first i started in the i went into\nthe new york city police department i\napplied and i was just like\nwhy not\nand i got into the police department\nand and i had simultaneously applied to\nthe us secret service i i bought a book\non international careers and i spoke\nlanguages at the time i loved languages\nand i spoke multiple languages and i'd\nstudied in different countries while i\nwas in college on my own\ni worked like multiple part-time jobs\nand i'm like alright this semester i'm\ngoing to work and then next semester i'm\ngoing to go to\nmexico and do a semester there and then\ni come back and i'd work and then the\nnext semester i'm like all right i'm\ngoing to go to italy now and work and go\nto school there\nand i just had this hunger to open up my\nmind\nand i think all those things kind of led\nme down\na path where i was like what more could\ni do and honestly the u.s secret service\ni studied government i studied\ninternational affairs i bought a book\nthat said careers in international\naffairs\nand i was just and it had about\nabout 300\norganizations in there\nand i was like somebody's going to give\nme a job in here\nand i sent a resume out jay and this is\nback in the day when there was like no\ninternet none of that stuff was around\nand i sent out 300 resumes the summer i\ngraduated i'm like somebody's gonna say\nyes\nand i think\ni got maybe\n25 rejection letters and then\neight or seven people replied back hey\nyou know fill out this form and one of\nthem happened to be the secret service\njust happened to be them so i was just\nlike why not and i think although i\ndidn't plan that path\nsometimes i think that life takes you\ndown the path you're meant to go and\nalthough you don't\nyou don't realize it and i think like\nwhen people ask me what's your five-year\nplan or what are your hopes and dreams\nand\ni'm like look i i feel it i see it i\nthink this is it\nbut nothing\nhas ever turned out the way i thought it\nwould or expected it to work out and\nit's almost always for the better i'm\nnot saying it's not hard\nbecause it's a hardship\nyou know and even\nyou know i write it you know when i was\napplying for these jobs even when i went\nto the nypd\nmy family was very upset with me they\nwere like why are you doing this and\neven my dad had to get his paperwork you\nknow i needed his naturalization\npaperwork and all that stuff and\nalthough he was a strong resilient man\nlike he couldn't understand he's like\nwhy are you doing this\nwhy would you think\nthat they'd hire you\nand it was hard you know it's hard to\nhear that\nwhen you're like 18 19 and you're\nthinking\ni can't listen to this i have to just\ntry and i was always like let somebody\nelse tell me no\nlet somebody else reject me i'm okay\nwith that\nbut i was like i'm not\ni can't listen to other people because\nat the end of the day like i have to\nlive with myself\nand i learned over time because there\nwere moments where i would listen to\nother people and i'd look back and i'm\nlike man\ni shouldn't have listened to this person\nyeah i should have really done what i\nwanted to do and so what if i failed and\nthat really kind of became part of my\ndna after that why i could and it took a\ntime to get to that to that point where\ni could tune people out i mean i listen\nto people you need good counsel but if i\nfelt something jay like i would i would\ntune people out and i'd be like no\njust go forward do it\nyou know and and\ni think that just kind of became part of\nwho i am and my\nmy internal mantra maybe so to speak\nyeah for sure thank you for sharing that\nby the way it's it's always fascinating\nto hear about someone's background and i\nlove what you said about almost\nstumbling into this world\nand i i i often say that you know we get\nto where we want in life just not in the\nway you imagined it and i love the\nanalogy gift because\ni can connect with what you said so\nstrongly when i hear you say things like\nyou know you just sent out all these\nresumes and you just waited to see who\nresponded and\nfor anyone who's listening or watching\nright now eddie's talking about a really\nimportant principle is that so often we\nsit there and we try and figure out like\noh which path should i take and we try\nand construct it we try and build it\nperfectly and we try and technically\nfigure it out and it's almost like the\nreal answer is open all the doors and\nsee which ones stay open some of them\nare going to close and some of them are\ngoing to stay open and keep walking\nthrough the ones that stay open and so\nwe can see that in evie's life and it\nled to this uh incredible journey so\nevie what i want to dive into now is i\nwant to talk about some of the\nalmost the mistakes that we make\nin reading people\nand i think you know the biggest\nchallenge that people have is like how\ndo i know someone's telling the truth\nhow do i know if i can trust someone how\ndo i know to believe someone this\napplies to whether you're a ceo hiring\nfor your company whether you're an\nentrepreneur hiring for your startup it\nrelates to whether you just want to date\nsomeone or you're talking on tinder or\nhinge or whatever it is like there are\nso many places where i feel\nwe ask ourselves the questions can i\ntrust this person is this person telling\nme the truth tell us the mistakes we\nmake when trying to assess whether we\ncan reach someone right and and how to\ndo it properly yeah i think it's so\nimportant because like who you have in\nyour circle of people\nwhether business whether personal\nrelationships is so important you have\nto make sure that people\nare meant to be there and sometimes\npeople come in and they may have good\nintentions for us\ninitially but then sometimes it's like\nyou know this relationship needs to\nfinish and evolve and you i always talk\nabout you constantly assessing\neverything and everyone\naround me to make sure like is this\nworking now because it may be working\nbefore but maybe it's not working later\nand\nyou know how do you get people to trust\nyou but the biggest thing is to really\nread people and it's not like a gimmicky\nthing\nlike you really have to pay\nattention to people\ni think one of the greatest\nmistakes i see that people do is that\nthey will not look at the actions of a\nperson so you may have someone who's\nlike let's say they're in a relationship\njay\nand\ntheir partner comes home late all the\ntime or their partner makes excuses all\ntheir time or their partner\ndoes these things and so if you're on\nthe outside of the relationship and you\nsee all these red flags you're like you\nlook at me like that person's cheating\nno question\nbut then the person that's in the\nrelationship because they're not they\ncan't separate the actions from the\nperson\nthey're like well he's working late or\nshe's working late because of this oh\nwell they were talking to that person\nbecause of that oh well they could not\nunlock their phone for me because\nyou know they forgot the security code\nbecause you start to mix the individual\nwith the actions\nand that's where we make a mistake we\ndon't judge the actions we we look at\nthe person\nand that's what happens when we end up\ngetting betrayed it's not until after\nthe fact where you're like man like how\ndid i miss that you know how after\nsomething happens all the nickels start\ndropping yeah and you're like but they\ndid this i i knew it i dismissed it i\nshould have paid attention and that's\nbecause you're really focused on the\nperson and you help make excuses for the\nperson because it's in your benefit\nbecause if you've invested time in\nsomeone as we're talking let's say a\npersonal relationship\nyou don't want them to be unfaithful it\ndoesn't suit you for them to be\nunfaithful because it means you've lost\nall this time all this this investment\nin this energy so it's easier for you to\nfall into that narrative and\nlisten and believe their excuses because\nit's it's the narrative you want to\nbelieve\nyeah and so you really have to be\ncareful\nwhen somebody shows you things through\naction\nyou have to stop and say\nif this action was somebody else\nindependent someone i didn't have a\nrelationship with what would i think or\nif somebody else came to me and said\nthis person did this this and this what\nwould i think\nyeah look at the actions people present\nto you\nand believe\nin them\nyou know there's a great quote that\nalways says when people show you who\nthey are believe them the first time\nlike\nwhen they show you\nbelieve it like they're telling you\nthey're showing you don't don't create\nthat narrative i think that's one of the\ngreatest\nhurdles i see people that they can't\novercome it like the signs are there\nthey can read the person if they want to\nbut they choose not to because it's not\nit's not the narrative they want\nabsolutely and what about in situations\nwhere like you don't get to see their\nactions i i completely agree with you\nbut what about this scenario where\nyou're like\nyou're just interviewing someone right\nnow like when you were in an\ninterrogation like you're not getting\nyou don't get to see that potential\nsuspects actions but you're literally\nreading their body language you're\nreading their communication like how are\nyou doing it then when you haven't\nactually seen someone's\nactions i think about that often i\ninterview i have a very large team and\nand i'm always trying to become a better\ninterviewer as well because i'm like you\njust you don't know whether to trust\nsomeone whether to give someone a chance\nwhether someone's being like how do you\ndo it from that perspective without the\nactions\nyou know\nlike for yourself like if you're\ninterviewing people and you're hiring\npeople one of the biggest and most\nimportant things i tell people is\nwhoever you're talking to\nmake them feel comfortable so you never\nwant to interview somebody like from\nbehind a desk or table you don't want\nthem to feel this is the thing jay you\ndon't want them to feel like they're\nbeing interviewed because in that moment\ni'm like oh it's an interview i'm going\nto sit up i'm going to\nbe super careful and then also keep in\nmind like i always knew this i knew this\nfrom doing interviews that\nthe majority of people will tell some\nform of lie or they'll embellish either\nin their application or in the interview\nprocess\nand how do you corroborate that one the\nimportant thing is to know that somebody\nwill do that so that you're a bit more\naware and conscientious of it but body\nlanguage is super important if you can\ntalk to people in person\nyou should really try to do that i can't\ntell you how much you get from in-person\ninterviews because you also feel people\nnobody talks about that but you feel\npeople's energy you you sense them it's\nbefore even cognitively you've been able\nto make any type of assessment of\nsomeone\nintuitively your your sixth sense so to\nspeak which it absolutely exists it's\ntelling you something so when you've got\nthat nagging feeling or something's not\nsitting right\nabsolutely listen to it\nabsolutely listen to it\nand then read people look at their\nmannerisms so one of the things you you\ncould do we would start off i would\ntalk to someone in a conversation about\nvery neutral things how are you where\nare you from oh great what brings you to\nl.a\nkind of that but authentically build\nthat conversation and in that moment\nyou're really assessing that person\njay as to like how they are when they're\nrelaxed how they're sitting so if\nthey're for example sitting and i'll\ngive you a very very\nbasic example\nif they're sitting a certain way and\nthen they shift during the interview\nyou can take notice of that actually\ni'll use one of your interviews for an\nexample\nso i watched your interview with curtis\njackson\nfrom a couple of weeks ago\nand i was watching you ask curtis\nquestions about his book\nand any time you asked curtis a question\nthat had to do with him remembering\nsomething or recall calling something\ncurtis would always look up and to the\nright yeah always\nevery time he had to access a memory an\nidea and so i would watch that interview\nand i don't know him i the first time\ni'm really watching him during an\ninterview and in that moment i'm like\nevery time curtis needs to remember\nsomething that's where he looks up and\nto the right he's recalling a memory so\nnow in that situation if you ask curtis\nsomething else right you see curtis\ndoing this over and over again then you\nask him another question that's a\nquestion related to memory but then you\ndon't see him look up and to the right\nyou see him look somewhere else\nthat would be a pause you'd say okay up\nuntil this point every time i asked him\nsomething about memory or something\nabout recalling an event he looked this\nway but now he's looking somewhere else\nso in that moment you could argue or\nthere your red flag could go up maybe\ncurtis is creating a memory now and i'm\nnot saying he did this but sometimes\nlike when people create lies\nthey access a different part of their\nbrain so you may access a part of your\nbrain when you're trying to remember\nsomething and for him all that was was\nhe would lock it up and to the right\nthat was just curtis\nbut i wouldn't have noticed that if i\ndidn't watch and pay attention to his\npatterns and so i would watch a\ndeviation or if you ask somebody a\nquestion and they're sitting in their\nrelaxed posture\nthen out of nowhere you ask them\nsomething and you know it's a sensitive\ntopic or maybe you're not even sure and\ntheir posture switches to something very\ncommon something like this\nyou could say in that moment all right i\njust asked the question\nand his or her posture just shifted why\nnow could it be they got tired could it\nbe that that's their normal posture it\ncould be but if they're not like this\nthe whole time\nthat should be an indicator to you like\nthere's something that happened here\nthat they shifted their posture and so\nwhen you see these deviations and then\nyou you're able to to realize certain\npeople's patterns\nthat's when you become\na better reader of people and there's\ncertain things positions you want to\nlook for even verbal language is super\nimportant and i talk about\nred flag verbal language i talk about\nsomething like for example what i would\nsee a lot when i worked financial\ninstitution crimes\none of the things i would hear victims\ntell me a lot when i'd say hey why did\nyou give this person your money\nand not ask questions and they would say\nyou know well he you know i asked but he\nsaid you know trust me\nand\nyou know anytime i would hear that it\nwas a huge red flag it still is\nand so a truthful person will explain\nthings to you\na decep a deceptive person won't they\nwon't explain things to you because they\ndon't want to explain things to you so\neven there's certain patterns in\nlanguage\nor somebody's that repeatedly says i\ndon't know i don't recall i call it i\nhave a term for this it's like i think\nthat i have amnesia\num tactic that people use\nyou see it deployed when people don't\nwant to answer questions\nand that's really important with reading\npeople\nbut i think what's also important for\npeople understand is like the way people\ndeceive the way people lie\nand we think that a liar is going to be\nvery obvious\nso like there's three ways people lie\nthe fir the first way people lie jay is\nthey can make something up from\nbeginning to end it's a it's a\nfabricated story it's completely made up\nthe second way people lie is\ni put in a little bit of truth a little\nbit of lie a little bit of truth a\nlittle bit of life so i mix it up so\nit's kind of like a peak and valley\nthing\nthe the most common way people lie is\nthrough omission\nand it's what they don't tell you they\nleave it out\nand the majority of us because we feel\nbad most of us that do have a conscience\nand some people have it more acutely\nthan others\nbut most of us just won't say it because\nwe're like i don't want to be a liar\nbut i'll leave this part out the thing\nis it's still a lie because because you\nleft that out\nit changes the story fundamentally\nand that's where\nwe really have to read people\nbut when you see something you also have\nto be able to to come up with follow-up\nquestions\nand that's another big thing a lot of\ntimes we let things slide\nand don't we don't inquire we're not\ninquisitive we'll take what people give\nus and then move on yeah so if you ask\nsomebody a question he keeps saying i\ndon't know i don't know and you let it\ngo\nthat's\nthat's something that you have to look\nat and be like okay they're dodging this\nquestion how can i come back and ask\nthis or maybe ask it later you know it's\nkind of like you put a pin in it yeah\nand these are some of the fundamental\nthings that you want to look for body\nlanguage\nreading people connecting with people\nopenness when people feel relaxed too\nthey're going to give you more\ninformation with their body i call it we\ncalled it bleeding information it's also\n2j when people lie\nthey're they're nervous nobody wants to\nget caught in a lie there's a stress\nresponse that happens so you'll you'll\nsee them their body leak bleed we used\nto use bleed they would bleed\ninformation and so you'd say why are\nthey doing this with their body\nyou know why all of a sudden\nyou know they're sitting calmly and all\nof a sudden now they're scratching their\nhead when we're talking about\nyou know whether or not they got fired\nfrom their last job that's a deviation\nfrom what they were\nand so it really is about being in tune\nand looking for all those different\nthings but most importantly knowing when\nyou see it and then coming back in with\nquestions\nand another key thing that's really\nimportant is asking\nopen-ended questions and i i'm a huge\nadvocate of this if you get people to\ntell you a story\nyou want people to tell you a story and\nthe more they talk\nthe more you will learn about people\nthey'll tell you what they're thinking\nwhat they're feeling what their values\nare you get a really good read on them\na really good read and again that read\nwill help you later on when you get into\nareas that you're concerned about\nwhether they've been fired whether\nyou know they've been to jail or stolen\nmoney or done whatever or\nyou know whether what they put on their\nresume is truthful and that's what you\nlook for those deviations\nwow you're blowing my mind right now\nthis is great everyone i hope you're\ntaking notes right ebby's given us so\nmany practical tips already the three\ntypes of lying fascinating right the\nneed for open-ended questions we don't\nask enough of them and that's something\nthat we all know we know we should ask\nopen-ended questions but we don't know\nhow to ask them we don't know when to\nask them we we struggle to remember to\nask them when we end up asking yes and\nno and close questions and so everything\nthat everything i'll be taking notes\nbecause i'm taking mental notes a lot of\nthese things and i promise you that\nthere are so many\npractical tips in there as to how to\nreally build that rapport how to build\nthat connection and how to build that\ntrust now evie you say that law\nenforcement academies are there to break\nyou down\nand build your resilience how do they do\nthat because it's almost like i feel\nlike for anyone who wants to build their\nresilience first we have to break\nourselves down\nto in order to really build it i\nremember in my monk training i felt like\nmonk training broke me down before we\nbuilt anything tell us about how it's\ndone in the lower law enforcement\nacademies that you've experienced\ni i honestly think it's done in a\nsimilar way that the foundation of it is\nsimilar because it's it's stripping you\nof all your flaws\nit's stripping you of all the weaknesses\nthat you may have that you should not\nhave\nand\nand it feels it's hard my first week in\nthe academy jay like i was like i want\nto quit everyone's yelling at me i don't\nknow what i'm doing i'm super confused i\ni came here with good intentions no\nmatter what i do i can't get it right\nand it was done purposefully\nbecause they want you to know what it\nfeels like to have to be stressed out\nand they want to see how you're going to\nreact\nhow do you react to stress\nyou know and even like what we're seeing\ntoday when you see officers doing\ncertain things that they should\nabsolutely not be doing\nlike when you are out there you can't\nyou can't be like everybody else\nyeah people can get in your face and\npeople can be rude and people can put\nhands on you\nbut you\nyou can't be them\njust because somebody else escalates you\ndon't escalate\nyou have to keep it together and that is\none of the most important things\nwith regard to the profession and part\nof why they they try to do that in the\ntraining process\nand it's actually they call it hormesis\nchoromyces the greek word hormetic\neffect\nwhere you induce small amounts of stress\ninto somebody\nthey adapt to that stress\nthey overcome that stress\nand then they're stronger more resilient\na little bit and then you give them\nanother stressful situation they adapt\nto that\nthey overcome it and then another and\nthen another so then what happens is\nyou've created a pattern or a habit\nrather you create a habit in which\nstress comes you recognize it oh no big\ndeal i've seen this before you accept\nthe stress and then you adapt to it\nbut when we are really\nkind of buffered from stress\nin life and then when it does happen\nwe're thinking oh my god this stressful\nsituation happen what do i do\nthat's because you you're not used to\nthat\nyou've not adapted that and so with\ntraining especially secret service\ntraining i mean it was large amounts of\nstress\nand\nlike running and and being tactical and\nhaving somebody yell at you and treat\nyou like garbage and then failing at\nsomething and being humiliated and then\nridiculed you know all these things\nand then you have to sit there and take\nit and stomach it and sometimes it's\ntruthful and then sometimes there's a\nlittle bit of drama and theatrics\ninvolved because\nthey want to break you down but\nthe mindset was if you can't handle this\nin here right what are you going to do\nout there\nout there when people and you know\nespecially the secret service when\nyou're dealing with threats you're\nprotecting other people's lives like you\nyou have to keep it together so when the\nwhole world is falling apart around you\nor there's chaos\nyou you you ha you can't follow suit you\nhave to be so\nlike streamlined so focused like i get\nhavoc is happening around me but i got\nit i'm laser focused\nand truly that that can only be done to\nyou by breaking you down making you feel\nthat burden and that pressure and that\nstress and then you overcoming it\nand then\nit also makes you more confident after\nthat\nyou become more confident in yourself\nyou're like yeah i've been here i\novercame this i'm good and it and it\nreally does something for your\nself-esteem your self-esteem and your\ndecision-making abilities\nthey teach you to be decisive it teaches\nyou to be decisive to not look to like\nshop around for other people's answers\nbut intuitively\nto say to yourself\ni know the answer this is my answer i\ndon't need anybody else's okay to do\nthis\nso i think that like that process really\nhelps create\nstrong people\nbut there's also\nanother part of it that's called the\nself-selection process\nwhere only people i would see this\npattern like it is like this with\nspecial forces and even certain jobs out\nthere\nonly the people that really believe\nalready from the get-go that they can do\nsomething only those people put in for\nit you know i hear people\na lot of times say to me like oh my god\ni could never\nhave been a secret service agent i could\nnever have gone through training and i\nthink to myself why not\nwhy not how did i\nand we\nwe defeat ourselves\nbefore we even\ntry to do anything like we'll\nwe'll create a dream and kill it within\nlike a minute\nthat is so powerful you just said uh\nabout how we defeat ourselves even\nbefore we try\nand i don't know if you meant to rhyme\nit but you did rhyme you said uh we we\ncreate a dream and then kill it within a\nminute uh and it's uh\nit's so true it's so true and and what i\nwonder is when you describe the\ntough challenging resilience training\nthat you went through it sounds like for\na lot of people the stress of their\nlives feels like that high stress\nenvironment but we don't react well to\nstress and what you were taught to do\neffectively is how to deal with very\nacute levels of stress so what would the\nif you had to break it down into a\nprocess of like three or four steps what\nwere the steps of that training to get\nbetter at dealing with more stress uh i\ni loved one example that you gave of\nlike you know more and more stress like\nsmall amounts of stress and bigger\namounts of stress but what other\ntechniques that were used to help you do\nthat because i think a lot of people\ncould benefit from them right now\nwhen something happens don't resist it\nwe resist things\nlike even if you take jay like the\npandemic like i'll hear people like i\ncan't believe this is happening i can't\nbelieve this is happening i want things\nto go back and we don't live in the\ntruth of things we live in the past we\nlive in where we wish to be and that\nthat destroys you right there\nso the first thing is you have to accept\nthis is where i'm at it sucks\nbut this is where i'm at so you accept\nit\nand then now once you accept it and\nthat's the biggest hurdle believe it or\nnot\nit's you we are always our biggest\nhurdles but once you accept it now it's\nlike okay\nhow do i handle it how do i adapt and\ncan you filter out the noise because\nthere's always so much noise around us\nand filtering out the noise is really\nreally powerful and then you know and\nyou did say something earlier about how\ndo we we have stressful lives something\nthat's really important i want to\nto emphasize is that\nyou are also the gatekeeper of what kind\nof stress you allow into your life so if\nyou have access to people that cause\nconsistent and chronic\namounts of stress in your life that's no\ngood that's not a good thing you are the\ngatekeeper and so you have to say\nnoise chatter this is all not good for\nme because it makes you more chaotic if\nyou're around chaos you're going to be\nchaotic and you push you have to you\nhave to be the gatekeeper and keep that\nstuff away from you but for those\nmoments when things do happen\nit's the acceptance and then your\nability to adopt and to be okay when you\ndon't adapt right so there's plenty of\ntimes where i've not adopted right or\ndone the right thing or handle something\nright and i always go back and even\ntraining was like that what did you\nlearn what are you going to do better\nnext time training was designed to make\nyou fail over and over and over again\ni failed like failure was like my my\nmy cape crusade like\ni failed at so many things and\nbut when i failed i was like alright\nwhat do i need to do differently\nwhy didn't i perform at the level i was\nsupposed to and then the fear of that\nfailure the fear of like i might not\ngraduate as a special agent and i'm not\ngoing to lose this opportunity so\npassion is a big thing\nwhatever you're pursuing or dealing with\nyou have to have passion and drive you\nhave to say this is important to me if\nsomething's not important to you you're\nnot gonna\nit's not gonna matter you're gonna be\nflippant with it\nbut i think that that's those are like\nthe key things and then just\nwhen stress does happen to you\ni guess i tell people in the way i was\ntaught like don't look at it as a\nhorrible thing\nlook at it as an opportunity to learn\nand make it embrace it embrace the\nchallenge embrace the confrontation\nembrace the hardship yeah someone's\ncoming at you now what and i know i'm\nthinking talking in a tactical sense\nyou know i remember in training i didn't\nwrite about this in the book but we did\nsomething called red man\nand they would put us in the room as one\nof the final trainee things and they put\nus in a room to fight somebody like\nreally fight someone they're like okay\nyou have to go\napprehend somebody we call it red man\nbecause he was like covered in uh gear\nand jay he would beat the crap out of\nyou i mean he literally lifted me up\nthis guy\nit was an instructor i can't remember\nfrom his two instructors and like throw\nme across the room and they're like go\nget him go get him\nand when instinctually you want to like\nkind of hide\nyou know what i'm thinking man i'm going\nto get a beat down but i remember\nthinking i'm like\nyou're going to have to earn that beat\ndown\nyou may beat me but you're going to have\nto earn it\nand not being afraid to lose\nnot being afraid to fail not being\nafraid to be rejected and i've\nyou undergo those things in training all\nthe time your ego goes out the door you\ngot an eagle you're the first person\nthat\nleaves that academy they will they will\npush you out they will make your life\nhell till you go\nand so\nembracing that\nand embracing failure is so powerful\njust being like all right what's up next\nthat's insane that is insane it's it's\nit's crazy to think about it because\nyeah there are multiple ways to break\nsomeone down and i'm hoping as you're\nlistening and watching to this you're\nrealizing the messages that are coming\nout of what have you saying around how\nyou know we're not going we're not\ngetting chucked around in that way but\nwe're going through our own failures and\nour own rejections and our own stress\nand and learning to not resist that\nstress learning to not resist that pain\nallows us to actually strengthen our\nresilience muscle\nnow now you've worked with some\nincredible leaders\nand leaders that people have you know\npeople watched on tv and obsess over and\nlearn about and and i'm intrigued by\nwhat you feel you learned from them or\nwhat you observed in them so if you take\nsomeone like\nuh you know former president bill\nclinton like i've always heard that he\nwas extremely charming he was able to\nmake everyone feel special like they\nwere the only people in the room what\nwas something that you observed about\nhim that you think we're less aware of\nmaybe\nyeah i was so lucky there was i remember\nthere was a point i remember walking\ninto the white house years later and i'd\nhave moments like this i was like\noh my my office is the white house you\nknow and i'm about to go see the\npresident and that in the beginning you\nhave those moments and after a while you\nget used to it but even sometimes once\nin a while i'd be like oh yeah okay bill\nclinton's coming or okay oh barack's\ncoming down the hall you know\nlet's go um\nbut look i was there to do my job so i\nwasn't there to be a groupie i wasn't\nthere to be like sir sir i have a\nquestion how would you handle this\nproblem like\nthat stuff didn't fly like you were\nthere\nto do a function but\nlike jay i was like a sponge a sponge\nand i absorbed from everything because\nin the white house you'd have the\npresidents coming through the first\nladies coming through foreign heads of\nstate coming through\nsometimes really remarkable people who\nhad extraordinary lives nobel peace\nprize winners and i\ni was like i am so lucky to be here i'm\ngoing to absorb everything i can\nand like you know you bring up bill\nclinton because he was one of my first\nprotectees truly\nand i spent a lot of time with him\nand he really was like you'd see him\nhe talked to people and he was like hey\nhow are you he'd make he'd connect with\npeople he'd pull them in there was like\nit wasn't the superficial like oh hey\nhow are you and go\nand i saw with that why people loved him\nbecause i remember when i first started\neverywhere we went there was like droves\nof people and i was like is he like the\nmost popular protectee like the most\npopular president out there and after a\nwhile i saw why because he would really\ngo shake hands with people talk to them\nhe he would remember a face he'd meet\nsomeone and then see somebody later be\nlike oh yeah i met that guy five months\nago somewhere and you're thinking\nhow do you remember because this is\nsomeone who meets thousands of people\nand\nthat was a skill\nit came from a genuine place don't get\nme wrong but a lot of these are skills\nand habits that you\nyou tweak and you you you fine-tune\nespecially when you're a leader\nand sometimes people think\noh that's the president you know he has\nto be a leader and i always thought i\nwas like\nwhy why can i be a leader why can i have\nleadership qualities\nand then in anything i do i don't have\nto be president\nand\ni really was like a student i would go\nto work and i'd do my job but i was a\nstudent whatever i could see whatever\nassignment i could volunteer for i was\nthat person\nto be in proximity and to learn from\nsuccesses and failures and also\ntalk about stress\nthese their jobs regardless of your\npolitical affiliation or anything like\nthe presidents that i would be around\nthey would deal with high stress\nsituations they couldn't fall to pieces\nyeah they couldn't they couldn't be\nupset or cry because somebody called\nthem horrible names or insulted them on\nnational tv because that would happen\nthey were like i got to keep it together\nand they kept it together until\nsometimes when you're around\nnot sometimes when you were around\nstrong people like that\nyou you become that\nyou absorb the energy of the people\naround you you become resilient\nand so in that\nway although maybe growing up i didn't\nhave that i didn't have access to people\nlike that i'd have access to anything\nlike that but because i worked hard to i\nput myself in an environment\nthat allowed me to have access to people\nlike that\nyou know i did that i made that happen\nand then\nthe people around us like\nwe absorb that energy we absorb those\nhabits we absorb those characteristics\nand i i keep that to this day you know\ni'm like whose habits do i want to\nabsorb and then even jay also i learned\nfrom some politicians and not\nnecessarily like my the presidents or\nfirst ladies but you know other\npoliticians habits where i'm like that's\nsomething i will never do that's\nsomething that's not right you know you\ncan learn from not just the positive\npeople the positive things people do but\neven the negative things people do like\nthey that can teach you how not to be\nwho not to be\nso\nsad so well said i think that's\nbrilliant like and that's something all\nof us can do right like whether you're\nworking in a company or working at a\nstartup or anything like any one of us\ncan look to people and yeah people with\nnegative behavior teach us what we don't\nwant to be like and people are positive\nteach us what we do want to be like and\nand i think that that's something that\nwe can all do so practically because\nwhen people say like what's the good in\nbeing in a bad situation that's what it\nis you learn what you don't want to\nrepeat you learn what you don't want to\nrecreate and and i think that's really\nreally beautifully explained uh but yeah\nokay so evie what i want to end with you\nis your final five these are your rapid\nfire questions so you've given us some\nincredible answers with so much depth\nand insight now we got to turn it the\nother way so you'll be a pro at this\nbecause i'm guessing you you've done so\nmuch more of this than i have but you're\ngonna answer the next five questions\nwith either one word or one sentence\nmaximum\noh the pressure jay the pressure yes\nyeah i mean this is like easy for you\nyou're like uh come on i got thrown\naround the room uh but but let's do it\nlet's do it okay so\nthe first question is what question do\nyou usually open interrogations with\noh uh tell me about your day\noh interesting okay question number two\nuh what is the most powerful thing you\nlearned from barack obama or observing\nbarack obama it doesn't have to be\ndirected his voice the power of voice\nwow his his voice like he commanded his\nvoice yes and i never i never thought\nabout that till i watched him\nand how what a powerful tool that is\nparalinguistics not what you say but how\nyou say it yes\ngreat lesson love it uh what's one thing\nyou learned from michelle obama\nself-worth\nshe taught me like\nthat\ni think because i grew up a certain way\nand i we didn't grow up in poverty but\nwe didn't grow up\ngreat either and\ni always thought that taking care of\nyourself and doing certain things meant\nwas a luxury and you shouldn't do that\nyeah and i i had a wrong perception of\nit and i\ni learned from her that that just means\nyou love yourself and you respect\nyourself\nso i learned self-worth\ntaking care of yourself\nthat's beautiful okay question number\nfour out of your five if you could\ncreate one law that everyone else in the\nworld had to follow what would it be\nstop trying to shove your opinion down\nsomebody else's throat just listen you\ndon't have to like it but just allow\npeople to express themselves even if you\ndon't like it\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love if you're\nlistening to this and you're in an\nunhappy situation i get it i get how\nhard it is one of the things that can\nhelp is to say\nthis demon\nwould come out with another person too"
