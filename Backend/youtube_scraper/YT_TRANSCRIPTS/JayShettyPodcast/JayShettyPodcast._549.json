    "transcript": "so the five types of attraction are\nphysical financial\nmental\nemotional and spiritual and most of us\nget involved in a relationship based on\nthe first three\npeople don't know how they want to\nreceive love\nand they don't know how to give love and\nlike we said earlier that\nthe old wisdom that is\nis is like to love and be loved is the\nbiggest need but we don't know how to\nlove and how to give love and we carry\nso much of our baggage from previous\nrelationships and\nexperiences and we bring them into a new\nperson\nso it's like that person treated me like\nthat that must mean all men or all women\nare like that which means now when i'm\nwith this woman i'm going to look at her\nthrough the lens of the last person that\ni was looking for them to to\nto create this experience again right\nexactly yeah so you know evidence of why\nthis person is this way exactly and so\nnow you're approaching each person with\nthe baggage of the last person\nwhich doesn't make sense\nyou're not coming at it from a fresh new\nexperience with the same lessons for\nyourself but we start applying the\nlessons to the other person so i think\nthat's the reason\nwhy we struggle to have an intimate\nconnection now one of the things i talk\nabout here are the five types of\nattraction yeah and and the reason why i\nthink this is the best way to figure out\nlanguage no no these are the five types\nof attraction that i talk about right so\nthe five types of attraction are\nphysical\nfinancial\nmental\nemotional and spiritual and i'll explain\nwhat i mean by all of them so physical\nis obvious\nshe or he is heart attracted i'm\nattracted to them financial or wealth\ni like what they own i like what they\nhave i like what they've achieved i i\nlike that he went to princeton or\nharvard i like that she's a scientist or\na ceo i like that she's a supermodel\nlike you like their status right so\nyou're attracted to that\nthe third thing that we're attracted to\nis people's\nmental abilities this is like when\nyou're attracted to someone's mind\nlike you just love the way they think\nyou love the way they articulate\nthemselves you love all of that like\nyou're attracted to that\nthe fourth is\nthe emotional this is when you're\nattracted to someone's emotional\nintelligence you're like oh they're very\ncaring they're compassionate they\nthey're supported they have these good\ntraits and the fifth and final one is\nspiritual where you're like you're\nyou're connected to that person's values\non a very deep level like what they\nreally live by now notice the first\nthree i equate them to chemistry\nand the last two i equate to\ncompatibility\nso the first three are chemistry and\nmost of us get involved in a\nrelationship based on the first three\nbut here's the issue\nyou can feel chemistry\nmultiple times per day you can feel it\nwith the receptionist you can feel it\nwith your personal trainer you can feel\nit with the barista at the coffee shop\nyou can feel it with the waiter or the\nwaitress\nthe spot you can feel that anywhere like\nyou can find someone attracted by one of\nthose qualities every single day\nand the challenge is we get into a\nrelationship based on simply one of the\nfirst three\nand there's nothing wrong with that as a\nstarting point it just can't be the end\npoint and so what we do is we keep\nconvincing ourselves that the first\nthree of cam chemistry is more powerful\nthan the last two of compatibility and\nwe're letting chemistry do the heavy\nwood lifting\nand it can't when we're making chemistry\ndo the heavy lifting the heavy work\nthey're like pull and push and like okay\nlike you you just take care of this\nthat's why so many people rely on good\nsex to save a relationship they always\nbe in conflict if the values and the\ncompatibility are not there and you're\nrelying on chemistry there'll always be\nsome conflict always yeah and and\nchemistry really easily is those top\nthree and which is good to have so you\nshould but my point is you have both you\nneed to have both but you can't just say\nbecause i'm mentally attracted to how\nthat person thinks that's good marriage\nmaterial\nthat's not good enough you can't say\nbecause that because some we make broad\ngeneral generalizations we say things\nlike oh because he or she has a top\ndegree from a top college or a business\nschool and they're at a top company they\nmust be really kind loving and organized\nit's like what like how did you get a\ngood parent yeah yeah most of our good\nparents how did you just draw that\nparallel and so that's the way i would\ntalk about\nentering a relationship is it can start\nwith the first three but don't let it\nend without the last two yeah have the\nemotional and the spiritual the values\ncorrect that has to align for a real\nlong-lasting relationship i feel like i\ncould do this for another thing\nit's amazing so good i want to finish\nwith one yes one thought about service\nbecause\nyou live a life of service i feel like\nmy mission is to be of service to you\nyou are in my business and my\nrelationships with my friendships it's\nall about service for me as well and\nthis is a i think it's a quote from the\nbhagavad-gita\nwhich one is it plant trees no so this\nthis one is like a famous statement that\nwe see yeah\nyeah yeah when you say plant trees under\nwhose shade you do not plan to sit i\nremember you told me that this one's\nfrom the bug and you told me that a\ncouple of years ago and i remember that\nreally blew my mind\nbecause\nin\nbusiness when i started out i think it\nwas a lot of like okay let me do this\nfor you and you do this for me let's do\nreciprocal type of stuff i was in the\nonline marketing world where it was\nabout joint venture shifts it was about\naffiliate marketing and i'll do this and\nthen you promote me right\nand then i started to shift it when i\ngot to the podcast seven years ago i\nsaid i'm just gonna bring on people i\nlike and i'm just gonna serve it comes\naround cool if not cool\nand it's\nit's hard i think to switch that\nmentality but it's so rewarding to come\nfrom a place of giving and service to\nliterally wanting to see other people\nsucceed whether they help you or not in\nreturn\nhow do we get to that place of that\nmindset\nwhen we're like but i really need some\nhelp right now and i really want someone\nto support me in return and i don't want\nto give all my energy to someone if\nthey're never going to give me anything\nin return how do we balance that yeah no\nthat's such a smart question because i\nthink the challenge is that we\nbecome\noverly compassionate often\nto\npeople in a certain way so what i mean\nby that is\nbeing compassionate and being giving\nisn't about spending your whole day with\none person who needs your attention and\naffection\nif your purpose is to do something\ndifferent so for example you're putting\nout this podcast you put out video\ncontent you write books this is serving\nlots of different people in lots of ways\nand you're not expecting apart from the\nperson buying the book\nand and getting the value from you don't\nreally expect them to do anything for\nyou right you're not asking them to come\nand\nchampion for you if they don't want to\nso you're already planting those seeds\nyou're already sharing in that way and i\nthink the mistake we make is when we are\noverly compassionate to one person and\nwe're doing it expecting that they're\ngoing to do something back right so the\nonly way\ndon't be overly compassionate expecting\nsomebody in return yeah don't just just\nif you see yourself\njust don't do that if you're going to\nfeel that and that's okay like that\ndoesn't make you less compassion it\ndoesn't make you a bad person like if i\ndon't want to and i have rules about\nthere are certain people in my life that\ni don't ask for favors\nbecause i don't ever want to be in a\nposition where i'm having to ask them\nbecause not that they wouldn't do it or\nwhatever i just don't want to do that\nit's just not who i am and it's like but\nthat's fine and there are certain people\nin my life that i won't give to because\ni know they're going to keep asking for\nstuff and so you have to protect\nyourself and i think self-protection and\nbeing honest with yourself is the best\nway so the\nmy favorite analogy in this is if\nsomeone's drowning in the ocean\nif you're fit and healthy and you're a\nlifeguard great you can go and save them\nbut if you're not you might need to call\nthe real lifeguard to come and help them\nout\nand that's what real compassion is real\ncompassion if you can't help someone if\nyou're feeling toxic one day you're\nfeeling negative one day you're feeling\nyou're not really giving from your heart\nit's better to introduce them to someone\nor find someone else who can help them\nthen to go in there with all these toxic\nemotions and now you're expecting them\nto live return the favor it's better to\nnot do it if you're gonna do something\nand in your heart of hearts you're\nactually feeling bitter and regretting\nit it's better not to do it because\nguess what you weren't compassionate\nwhen you did it with that intention\ncompassion is about intention it's not\nabout the result like two\npeople could give the same amount to\ncharity\none person gives it for pr one person\ngives it because they care about the\nkids who's happy the person who gave it\nfor the kids the person both people's\nmoney had the same impact\nbut the intention is what defined what\nhappened so if you're\nbegrudgingly\ngoing out there and helping someone and\nin your heart you're like oh i can't\nbelieve they asked me who are they like\ni don't even like them like they never\nhelp me and then you help them that\nguess what that's not compassion protect\nyourself deal with it deal with that\ntoxic emotion so i don't help people\nthat when i feel like that\nand i give myself that that space i know\nor no yeah i just say\nyeah i can't well i'll be honest with\nthem i'll say i in honest in the best\nway that you can i've i don't think i\ncan support you on this because i don't\nfeel right about it it doesn't make\nsense to me or whatever it is like it's\nnot the right fit and i think that's\nactually stopping yourself from being a\npeople pleaser yes because we we\nactually are not compassionate we're\njust people pleasers we actually just\nwant people to think we're like\nmagnanimous and amazing so we'll go and\ngo to every you know everything to\nsupport everyone but it's like we're\nresentful people pleasers exactly please\nand then we're resentful that we've had\nit exactly\nand then now we want to make them feel\nguilty for not doing their back so i\nmake a conscious effort to support the\npeople i love\nto to make an effort with the people i\nlove and do more there and that's that's\nfine your compassion doesn't you don't\nhave to be this\noverarching person who's like doing it\nfor everyone like that's that's part of\nthe journey it's going to take time to\nget there\nhow do you know when you've found the\none and a lot of you been asking jay how\ndo you know when you've found the one so\nhere you go this is the video for you if\nyou've got any insights or ideas on how\nyou know when you've found the one write\nthem in the comments while you're\nlistening to me rambling on and giving\nyou these insights now think about it\nfor a moment in your life you've\nprobably had relationship and love\nadvice from so many different people and\nplaces you've probably had some from\nyour family your grandpa\nhe just\nasked me to marry him one time one day\nand i was like\nno\nno\nand you've probably had some from your\nfriends you're already saying i love you\nin this relationship\nit's been like a month it's been three\nmonths\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nnot to forget you've definitely had tons\nof advice knowingly or unknowingly from\nthe tv programs you watch dumper and\nwithout a doubt the movies that you\nwatch have had a massive impact on what\nyou think love looks like\nand last but not least the songs that\nyou listen to every year new movies\nsongs tv programs are all released about\nfinding love you've got dating shows\nreality tv and every week you have a new\napp that's promising you it will help\nyou find the one you've got apps that\nhelp you find vegan people non-vegan\npeople people who love cars people who\nlove traveling and then even cuddler it\nconnects you with people who are just\nlooking to you guessed it cuddle\nbristler matches people with beards with\nthose who want to stroke them and some\nof those are pretty weird and not only\nhave we been exposed to so many\ndifferent ideas and advice from what we\nconsume but even the people around us\nfrom watching our parents to watching\nour friends to watching our aunts and\nuncles to watching the people that we\ngrew up around all of these ideas have\nleft an imprint on what we think about\nlove and finding the one and all of\nthese things also put ideas into our\nheads about what the other person likes\nyou know girls like guys who drive cars\nlike this guys like girls who dress like\nthis and this starts to form our ideas\nabout what we believe about\nrelationships i'm gonna tell you one of\nmy favorite ones maybe some of you have\nseen the movie a bronx tale maybe you\nhaven't you can check it out and in the\nmovie there's a scene where this really\ncool suave i believe he's somewhat of a\ngangster guy says to the younger guy\nwho's kind of being mentored by him that\nyou know when you found the one when a\ngirl does this one thing you want to\nknow what that one thing is yes\nhe says that the ideal girl is a girl\nthat when you take her to your car you\nopen the door you let her in she sits\ndown and while you're walking around the\nback to get to the driver's seat she'll\nlean over and open your door for you if\nshe doesn't do that she's out right\nshe's not the one so it's crazy to\nbelieve that there's so many different\nstories so many different examples of\nadvice being given to us all across our\nlives what i'm gonna do today is give\nyou my top 10 ways of knowing when you\nfound the one are you ready here we go\nnumber one they'll support and mutually\nrespect your dreams now that doesn't\nmean that they're going to do your\ndreams for you it doesn't mean that\nthey're always going to be there\ncheering you on but it means that they\nrespect your priority about your dreams\nthey value what you're chasing they\nbelieve in it as much as you do and they\nwant to see you get there they're not\ntrying to hold you back they're not\ntrying to stop you from getting there\nthey're not trying to restrict you and\ntrap you in any way they want to see you\ngrow genuinely follow your dreams\nnumber two they'll really be present\nwith you in the moment i love being\naround people who help me forget to look\nat my phone that's the kind of person\nthat you want to be with someone who's\nnot distracted by their phone by their\nmessages by their friends by anything\nelse when they're with you they're with\nyou if they keep forgetting what you're\nsaying chances are they're not the one\nare you even listening to me number\nthree the person is self-aware and knows\ntheir self-worth they're independent\nthey're able to grow on their own they\nhave their own set of friends they have\ntheir own set of values they have their\nown set of priorities some of them may\nmatch with yours but some of them may be\ndifferent but they're their own person\nthey're not looking for you to complete\nthem they're not looking for you to\nfinish them they're looking for you to\nenhance them and help them grow they're\ngrowing with you and they're gonna help\nyou grow too i'm here to help number\nfour is the tough one it's called trust\nprobably one of the hardest rarest thing\nin the world and i'm talking about\nwithout checking are you spying on me\nnow this one's a tough one because\nsometimes you find out the hard way and\nsome of us have been there so my take is\nthat trust should be earned it's not\nsomething that should be given up front\nbut it's something that is earned\nusually we have this belief that i\neither trust someone or i don't trust\nthem at all my idea is that there's\nactually layers of trust you have no\ntrust at the bottom but then there's\nstep one step two step three step four\netc which leads to unconditional trust\nthe challenge is we put our expectation\nwhen we're with someone that we can\nunconditionally trust them and actually\ntheir trust levels down here that gap is\nexactly how much pain you end up feeling\nremember trust is something that's\nearned don't give it straight away let\nthat person through their actions and\ntheir thoughts and their words earn your\ntrust you're gonna have to earn it\nnumber five you don't always need\nsomeone or something else to keep the\nchemistry keep the entertainment and\nmake things fresh when you feel like you\nalways need an external form of thrill\nor excitement to keep everything special\nbetween you two it's a sign that you may\nnot actually be connecting with each\nother but connecting with that other\nthing i want to sit and watch some more\ntv\nnumber six you can spend time apart but\ncan't wait to be back so you're\ncomfortable traveling different parts of\nthe world for work studying in different\nareas of the world maybe in the same\ncountry maybe in a different one but you\ncan't wait to be together and the\nchallenge is that we usually get\nfrustrated when you're apart from\nsomeone that you love or want to be with\nyou start getting frustrated and you\ntake it out on them which actually\nweakens the relationship you know when\nyou found the one because you'll realize\nthat you don't let that frustration\naffect your relationship with them you\nfind other ways of releasing sharing\nthat but you're making sure that you're\nnot ruining your own relationship\nbecause of the frustration of not being\ntogether in the first place\ni don't want to fight with you\nnumber seven you can disagree this is\nthe tough one people think that you\nfound the one when you agree on\neverything when you like the same stuff\nwhen everything matches that's not true\nat all you can actually disagree with\nthat person you can have different ideas\nand you still learn to work together\nit's pretty difficult to find anyone in\nthe world who agrees with you on\nabsolutely everything so they expect to\nfind the one who has that that's pretty\nunlikely\ni disagree number eight you don't have\nto like each other's friends i think\nthere's so much pressure to be liked by\nthe other person's friends for them to\nlike your friends for your friends to\nlike them chances are that you're\nputting in way too many tick boxes that\nare going to be quite difficult to\nmanage now if your friends think that\nthey're totally crazy or they think your\nfriends are crazy definitely take a look\nat that she's very picky dude but the\ntruth is that it's important that you\nguys get along even if they're friends\nwith a whole different circle of people\nand you're friends with a whole\ndifferent circle of people that doesn't\nmean you can't be great together we are\ngreat together\nwe are a great team number nine you can\nbe your real self not your linkedin\nprofile not your facebook profile not\nyour instagram profile not your twitter\nprofile you can let go of all those\nidentities and just be yourself who are\nyou\nreally and finally number ten you argue\nnot to get one up on each other not to\nbeat the other person not to defeat the\nother person but so that you can come to\na healthy conclusion together it's more\nof a discussion rather than an argument\nor a debate because it's not about who's\nright but it's about making sure that\nyou come to the right conclusion\ntogether you telling someone like these\nare the three things she wants in bed\nlike that's not gonna change your\nrelationship if you aren't compatible if\nyou don't connect if you don't speak the\nright love languages if you're not\nempathetic if you're not vulnerable like\nthen that three list of this and\nseventies to that isn't gonna do\nanything it's void and and that's where\ni'm trying to get to with people because\ni don't want people to use sex as a\nsubstitute for that and i don't want\npeople to use sex as an excuse for that\nand i don't want people to use sex as a\ncover-up for not having any of that\nbecause i know having been in tons of\nrelationships where it was just physical\nand that's all there was\nthat's\nthe only time it felt good it didn't\nfeel good at any other time i didn't go\nhome with a beautiful feeling in my\nheart\nand then when it's only about that\nthat's also when it can be easily\nreplaced right because that's easily\nchangeable right and that's why i think\nso many people go through and i talk\nabout my videos so much about cheating\nand loyalty because when it is just\nphysical it becomes so much more easier\nto just disconnect and fall asleep\nyeah and now heartbreak yes what's your\nadvice on heartbreak\ni know you have you have a video up it's\nlike the five things people should do\nthrough heartbreak and one of them is\nlike get rid of everything from the past\nand only focus on the present and the\nfuture yeah i like that's hard for\npeople i like getting rid of visual\ntriggers\ni think the challenge in a lot of our\nlives is that we're surrounded by the\nsame sounds the same sights\nand the same people that we were in our\npast and i see this with anything and\ni'm sure you felt this when you went\ndeeper into your faith did your circles\nchange 100 right when you went deeper\ninto your faith did what you look at\nchange 100 right so you look at my heart\nchange your heart change because\ninternal anecd's done yes because for me\nwhen i transformed in my faith it was a\ntransformation of my heart yes not about\nwhat i was actually doing or not doing\ncorrect and that's what i feel for\nanyone anyone that i've witnessed and\nobserved go through transformation in\ntheir life their environments have\nchanged and so for me a lot of us are\nmaking it harder for yourself it's like\nsaying i want to start working out every\nday but i don't own any trainers right\nit's like that's not going to work it's\nlike doing the opposite like i want to\ngo on a diet but i'm going to keep\nchocolate cake in my refrigerator right\nlike it's it's that so you're saying\nyou're enabling i want to get over the\npast but i'm going to keep my ex's\nsweater right next to me and i'm going\nto keep all these text messages that i\ncan keep reading through again why do\npeople go back and read text messages\nbecause from someone that broke their\nheart because nostalgia and imagination\nis more powerful\nright the feeling of nostalgia and this\nis in studies too like the research by\nnostalgia is you always think things\nwere better in the past with something\nlike that so you read a message you're\nlike oh but they love me so much and now\nwhat you're doing is\nreality's here and you've got your own\nversion of reality playing here so\nyou're basically writing your own movie\nscript up here\nwhen reality's telling you this and\nnostalgia is that script that fantasy\nthat's never going to be that fantasy\nthat isn't real so it's you saying i\ndon't want to accept what is\nand i'm trying to accept what if those\npeople who can't get over that that hump\nwhat do you tell them\none of the biggest things that do you\nreally want no no no no no it's a good\nit's a good conversation i think\none of the biggest things i say to\npeople is just like let's kind of break\ntheir\nspace that they're in it's almost like\nthat person needs a space change and\nthey they need to get out of that zone\nand so for me i'm always encouraging\npeople to start doing new things i think\nit's so powerful when you go and have a\nnew experience when you try something\nnew you join a new class you've never\ndone it before because guess what it's\nabout finding yourself again so you're\nnow learning new things about yourself\nyou're now falling in love with yourself\nit's about falling in love with you\ncorrect and i think that the biggest\nmistake we make in that time is\neveryone's telling you oh when's the\nrebound like are you going to date this\nguy when are you going to start dating\nagain or this girl when are you going to\nbe out there again and it's almost like\nwell no maybe it's where i go inside\nthis time and spend some time with\nmyself\nand i think new experiences are a\nbeautiful way of doing that because you\nonly learn new things about yourself\nwhen you do new things with yourself\nright\nyou never like you never do new things\nwith ourselves you always you're always\ndoing the same things with the same\npeople but imagine you're studying new\nthings on your own and now you have new\nmemories and one of the things i've been\ntalking about a lot with people is\nforming new memories if you don't make\nnew memories the old ones will always\nhold you back and that's why we're stuck\nin the old because we're not making any\nnew ones so the new the old ones just\nkeep pulling you back the best way to\nmake new memories is a set up and\nexperience do with a friend that you\nlove and when you go out there it's this\ntechnique that's often used for\ngrounding in therapy and everything but\ni use it for presents and that's how we\nwere trained in it as monks when you go\nsomewhere and you're like i want to take\na mental picture of this how many times\nhave you ever said that where you go\nsomeone you're like i want to yeah have\nthis in my mind and i want to keep it\nforever and the iphone camera is not and\nthe camera is not going to do it it's\nnot going to keep it emotionally and i\nthink we're so bad at creating emotional\nmemories that are new so the best way to\ndo it is called 54321 okay\nso when you're in a space and let's say\ni want to do it of this i look at five\nthings that i could see so five things\nthat i can see right now so i'm gonna\nsay you obviously important part of the\nmemory you're important too yeah yeah\ni'm doing it with you yeah i'm gonna say\nthe rug okay so i'm going for space okay\ni'm gonna look at the ceiling so one two\nthree four i'm gonna say the couch so\nthere are five things that i can see\nthe second thing is four things that you\ncan touch okay so four things i can\ntouch my silky dress my really dry skin\nyou're good at descriptions silky dress\ndry skin this is good the rough textured\nraw texture yes and oh my gosh yeah\namazing three things that you can hear\ni can hear the light yes i can hear\nmyself swallow and i can hear your voice\nperfect\nand then two things that you can smell i\ncan smell my garlic\nbreath and\num i'm having a hard time smelling\nbasically anything because i'm seven\nmonths pregnant\nyou can hear how clogged i am yeah me\ntoo but maybe my perfume okay okay and\nthen once all about me yeah no that's\ngood and then one thing you can taste\ngarlic great\nso so if you did that\nin an experience then you want to turn\nit on forever\nall you have to do to to make a mental\npicture take a mental picture of\neverything you do five four three two\none five things you can see\nfour things you can touch\nthree things you can hear\ntwo things you can smell and one thing\nyou can taste i really like that yeah\nit's beautiful and so and this is what i\nmean by when you're going through a\nbreakup the biggest mistake you make is\nthe old memories hold you back because\nyou don't know how to make new memories\nand so my advice to everyone is go and\nmake new memories okay so i did tony\nrobbins right and it was enlightening it\nwas fun\nand the biggest thing that i came away\nwith was i don't live in the present i'm\nconstantly living for the what's next\nyes here we go you know okay team it's\ntime to hustle yeah and he said what are\nyou grateful for and i mean i could sit\nthere and say i'm grateful for my health\ni'm grateful for my family i'm great you\nknow like i could list a few things but\nhe said what are you grateful for in\nyour career and it's like i had to\nreally go\ndeep\nand\ni think that maybe if i started doing\nthe 5-4-3-2-1\ni would be able to go back to\nexperiences\nthat\ni thought my heart remembered but my\nmind didn't totally and i am totally\nimplementing 543 and that's exactly what\nit's so today it's used for a lot of\npeople who start with anxiety to bring\nthem back into the moment when we were\ntrained in as monks it was what we did\nfor presents like gazelle you said right\nand this is why the biggest mistake we\nmake is when you're having an experience\nthe only sense we activate is the eyes\nand that's why when you're trying to\nthink of a past memory you go what was\nit again\nbecause you have to close your eyes\nbecause that was the only one that was\nactivated whereas what we've done with\n5.321 is you've now absorbed this memory\nthrough all the five senses which means\neach one of them is going to give you a\ndifferent bun i like it yeah wow all\nright switching gears a little bit i\nreally feel like insecurities\nbreed negativity right\nand a motto that i like to live by is\nkill people with kindness\nwhat do you think about that yes i love\nthat i agree with you completely this is\nthe beautiful thing that happens when\nyou say thank you to someone who's kind\nto you it does three things the first\nthing is you recognize kindness so now\nyou are triggering your mind to start\nrecognizing kindness and you're now\nrecognizing kindness in them\nthe second thing you do is you reinforce\nkindness and then they realize they're\nlike oh when i'm kind people appreciate\nit right so i'm gonna be more kind so\nyou've now reinforced kindness within\nthem and the third thing is you help\nthem repeat it now that you've shown\nthem that their kindness is reciprocated\nthey're now going to be kind to more\npeople so now you've started this domino\neffect of kindness just by thanking one\nperson who knew yeah it's so interesting\nto hear you talk about being a monk and\nlike how you spend half the day working\non yourself and halfway the other day\nworking\nto give out to others and\nwhat is your take on putting yourself\nfirst and like is it selfish\nso with with monk teachings the point is\nyou are\ntaking care of yourself first\nin order to serve better\nso it's always like i'm going to put\nmyself first\nso that i can fill up so that i can\nserve with more because we want to serve\nwith our best selves right i always say\nthis to people it's like people are like\njay should i go to this party should i\ngo out to this event should i call up\nthis person should i do this should i do\nthat i'm just like well if you're going\nto show up there with that energy\nwell you're going to have to convince\nyourself to go then guess what that\nperson is going to feel that right\nbecause if you want to show up then\nyou're going to show up with your best\nso i feel for me it's not selfish\nif the intention\nis i want to give more and serve more\nthat's good it's it's selfish when it's\njust like oh i'm just going to take care\nof myself because that's all that\nmatters right whereas it's like no i'm\ngoing to take care of myself because i\nwant to give my best self to the people\ni love right to the people of the world\nto the people i care for and so i'm\ngonna keep prioritizing myself so i\nwent down the wrong journey when i first\nstarted wanting to serve i used to just\nthink oh yeah i'm gonna stay up all\nnight someone needs me to drive halfway\nacross the country i'll do that and i\nwould do things like that and i started\nto realize i was just people pleasing i\nwasn't serving i was actually serving my\nown ego that was the most selfish thing\ninteresting it was the most selfish\nthing because there's just people\npleasing but then i realized actually me\nsaying look you know what i need to get\na good night's sleep tonight but i\npromise you first thing in the morning\nwe're going to talk about this and i'm\ngoing to bring my best off to this\nconversation people started to respect\nthat value that and gave me that space\nare you tired of being single but sick\nof the dating scene are you thinking\nabout just giving up\nif

found\nthe one and you're thinking about giving\nup on dating keep watching because i\nhave some insights and solutions that\nmay help i got some really powerful and\nprofound insights into what's wrong with\nhow we're dating from relationship\nexperts and psychologists john and julie\ngottman who are also husband and wife i\ngot to interview them for my podcast and\nthey told me something shocking which is\nthat when it comes to dating we put too\nmuch emphasis on finding people\nlike us that doesn't mean we literally\nlook for people exactly like us but that\nwe put too much emphasis on finding\npeople with the same hobbies the same\ninterests and ideals as we have agreed\nto agree now that flies in the face of a\nlot of what we think we know about\ndating right we think it's about finding\npeople who share lots of things with us\nand then we're more likely to be\ncompatible with them the gottmans\ndisagree and that's one of the reasons\nonline dating algorithms can fail us so\noften i mean they don't fail in that\nthey don't work they do a great job of\nmatching people based on the criteria\nthat we determine are important to us\nbut maybe we're focusing on the wrong\ncriteria the problem is that in reality\na lot of this criteria doesn't actually\nmake for a great match for us as so many\nof us have discovered when we've\nactually met some of those people in\nperson we can't even necessarily tell\nwho we'll really be attracted to from\ntheir photos you look like your profile\npic finally one of the reasons for that\nsays the gottmans is our jeans and we\nknow this thanks to a bunch of sweaty\ngerman t-shirts\nwhat did you just say one swiss\nresearcher and his team took a group of\n44 men and gave them nice clean cotton\nt-shirts and asked them to wear them for\ntwo nights in a row while they were\nsleeping they also asked the men to\navoid things that would alter their\nsmell artificially like smoking eating\nheavily spiced foods wearing scented\ndeodorants and while sleeping with\nsomeone else you stink\nhere's where it gets really really weird\ni'm not even going to guess how the\nresearchers came up with this idea they\nput the worn t-shirts in identical boxes\nwith a small hole in the boxes then had\n49 women come in and smell each of the\nboxes you heard that right the women\ncame into a room and through the halls\ngot a whiff of the t-shirts sniff around\nnow they didn't eat smell all 44 shirts\neach woman was asked to smell six shirts\nand rate the shirts from 1 to 10 on\nintensity pleasantness and sexiness\nagain you heard that right sexiness from\nsmelling a t-shirt smells good now the\nsix shirts each woman got were specially\nselected to include three that were for\nmen with a closer genetic match to them\nand three from men who are less of a\ngenetic match consistently the women\npreferred the smells of the men who are\nless genetically matched remember they\nhad no information about the men no\nphotos no personal details\nonly the smell of dead t-shirts\nresearchers theorized that these\nparticular genes which play a role in\nthe development of our immune systems\nhelp to keep us from being attracted to\npeople who aren't genetically diverse\nenough from us which could potentially\nnegatively impact the health of our\noffspring and the smell of a t-shirt and\nour genetic matchiness is the kind of\ninformation that even the highest tech\nonline dating algorithm has not mastered\nif we don't give it the right\ninformation anyway beyond our genes i\nasked the gottmans what we tend to get\nwrong when it comes to dating they said\nthat we often screen for things that\ndon't really matter when you meet\nsomeone you're truly compatible with on\na deeper level lots of those things\ndon't actually matter when i asked the\ngottmans what does matter they gave me a\nlist of eight things to look for and\nhere they are number one does the person\nlisten to you do they show genuine\ninterest in getting to know you do they\nask you meaningful questions and really\nlisten to the answer i'm listening\nnumber two are they reliable and\nconsistent or do they play games like\nplaying hard to get that's a big red\nflag that's a red flag number three\nare they honest and sincere i would\nnever lie to you number four are they\nattentive is it clear that they consider\nyour needs desires and feelings it's not\nall about you number five are they kind\nor instead are they critical do they\nmake biting sarcastic remarks that just\naren't funny\nthat's not funny number six are they\ngenerous\nsharing is good number seven are they a\nperson of substance and character and\nare they respectful i do not respect you\nand eight finally does it feel good to\nbe with them this feels so\ngood so does that mean you should ditch\nthe dating apps i'm definitely not\nsaying you should stop using apps but\ninstead it may be helpful to shift what\nyou're using them for helen fisher is an\nanthropologist and the chief science\nofficer for match.com she says we have\nthe wrong idea about how much and\nsimilar sites in that they are not\ndating sites they are introduction sites\nentrepreneur christina wallace agrees in\na hilarious ted talk where she discussed\nsome of the perils she faced doing\nonline dating before she finally met the\none christina says that it's not the\napps that are broken it's our\nexpectations of them after countless\ndating fails christina decided to start\ngoing about her app use more\nstrategically and set up a screening\nsystem for every message she received\nfrom a new potential match where she\nwould evaluate them for three criteria\nnow remember these were things that were\nimportant to christina yours might be\ntotally different number one the message\nhad to be written in complete sentences\nwith good grammar number two it had to\nreference something specific about her\nso she knew they weren't just cutting\nand pasting their messages number three\nthe message could not contain anything\nsexual of 210 new messages christina\nreceived 14 percent met these criteria\nfor her next step christina decided she\nwanted to meet the guys quickly because\nas she said the things i cared about i\ncouldn't see online she was tired of\ngoing back and forth for days or weeks\nexchanging long messages or committing\nto full dates only to find out they had\nno real chemistry or the guy only wanted\nsex so christina created what she called\na zero date where the ground rules were\nthat they would include just one drink\nover one hour and in that time only one\nquestion she needed to answer for\nherself was would i like to have dinner\nwith this person would i like to spend\nthree hours with them if the zero date\nwent well she'd see if they wanted to\nhave a first date then just go from\nthere i absolutely love this approach to\nnot give an online dating app the full\nresponsibility of matching you with the\nperfect person but instead for just\npresenting you with a lot more options\nto choose from from there you can do\nwhat christina did and come up with a\nfew not 19 or 20 basic screening\ncriteria to see if you're interested in\nmeeting them in person that way you can\nimmediately rule out people who don't\nmeet your baseline but you're less\nlikely to disqualify a potential partner\ntoo soon over things that don't really\nmatter are you looking for the one are\nyou trying to find that big love of your\nlifetime and you feel like you've tried\neverything and looked everywhere if so\nthis video is for you the reality is\nthere are so many ways we can end up\nfinding our person there isn't really a\nsingle solution for everyone but i will\ntell you one big thing you need to stop\ndoing if you want to find the one and\nit's something most of us do and i'll\ntell you two things to do instead\naccording to the us census one in four\nmillennials speaks a language other than\nenglish at home in california it's one\nin two regardless of what language they\nuse at home there's one word that\nmillennials worldwide are speaking less\nthan ever marriage according to the\ncensus about 3 out of every 10 american\nmillennials have ever been married\naccording to data from the pew research\ncenter younger adults are getting\nmarried at the rates 11 to 20 lower than\nthe baby boomers and the silent\ngeneration\nlook all around and there's no shortage\nof opinions as to why some say\nmillennials are too broke to get married\ntoo expensive others say they're too\nbusy building their careers or pursuing\nhigher education i have more important\nthings to do then there's the idea that\nmillennials just don't believe in\nmarriage that it's a broken system whose\ntime has passed i don't believe in that\nsort of thing personally yet according\nto data from avo an online legal\nmarketplace 82 percent of millennials\nsurveyed disagreed with the statement\nthat marriage was an outdated\ninstitution and a study conducted by\nacuvue brand contact lenses found that\n52 of respondents strongly agreed that\nmarriage is important to them others say\nit's long-term commitment that matters\nto them whether or not it involves\nmarriage i know from all of the messages\nand questions i get from you and from\ntalking with my own single friends that\nmost of us do put a committed\nrelationship as one of our top\npriorities and the reason so many of us\nhaven't found the one is well we don't\nreally know\nthat's a question i get so often jay\nwhat am i doing wrong what do i need to\ndo to find the big love of my life and\nthat's what we're talking about today\nwhen it comes to dating and\nrelationships there's no shortage of\nadvice and a lot of it is conflicting\nshould you be scientific on data driven\nor dreamy do you need to take an\napproach that's organized or organic the\nanswer is both i'll explain in a minute\nbut first let's talk about the one thing\nthat most of us get flat out wrong when\nit comes to finding the one here's what\nit is we create an ideal picture of the\nperfect person you're probably like jay\nwhat isn't that exactly what we're\nsupposed to do otherwise isn't it like\ntrying to find a town you've never been\nto before without using a map not so\nsays relationship expert marla madrone\nmarla talks about that the biggest\nmistake we make in trying to find our\nideal partner is that we look for our\nideal partner she explains that we\ncreate this detailed picture of who we\nwant to be with then when we meet people\nwe fill in the gaps in what we know\nabout them with our own projections\nwhether those are positive or negative\nthe problem marla says is we're not\nreally seeing and learning who the other\nperson is we're creating a perception of\nthem based on a blend of our own prior\nexperiences along with our needs and\nexpectations and they're doing this with\nus too rarely do we actually see each\nother for who we are so we reject or\nembrace each other based mostly on\ninaccurate perceptions so we're either\nalone and we're not sure why or we're in\na couple's therapy trying to figure out\nwho we are and re-engineer our\nrelationships i love this because it\nreminded me of one of my favorite quotes\nwhich is from sociologist charles horton\ncooley the quote is i'm not what i think\ni am and i'm not what you think i am i\nam what i think you think i am as i\nwrite in my book think like a monk our\nidentities are wrapped up in what we\nthink others think of us so\nwhat do you think a common problem in\nmany of our relationships is that we're\nmethod acting we're relating to one\nanother from these false places or these\nroles not purposefully but because we\ndon't really know ourselves marla says\nthat the way we stop doing this is know\nyourself she says that cultivating\nself-awareness is the most powerful\nthing we can do to strengthen all of our\nrelationships it helps us build healthy\nboundaries nurture open and honest\ncommunication end toxic relationships\nand yes find the one i really understand\nthe value of self-awareness when i\ntrained as a monk it was like a\nthree-year intensive on learning who you\nare self-awareness is so critical to\neverything we do from creating\nfulfilling relationships and careers and\nfamilies to just being happy and\nexperiencing joy meaning and purpose on\nour own i first met my wife radi before\ni ever became a monk she was great but i\njust wasn't in that place and she wasn't\nin that place and so while we enjoyed\neach other's company there was no\nromantic connection after i left the\nashram and spent more time with radhi\nwho'd become one of my sister's closest\nfriends i got to experience a different\nbroader version of her because my lens\nhad changed i was so much more\nself-aware and i knew what was important\nto me and also what wasn't important to\nme and although i wasn't out on a flat\nout search for the one at the time\ni had that solid foundation in place and\nso did she so that we were both able to\nsee and connect with each other as who\nwe really are and every day i can see\nour continuing to work on our own\nself-awareness strengthens our\nrelationship with each other now that\ndoesn't mean things are always perfect\nand easy but that's one of the beautiful\nthings about loving relationships\nideally we're with someone who we can\ncontinue to grow with and who we still\nlearn new things about all the time\npsychotherapist and relationship expert\nesther perel says that novelty and\nnewness is a key element to lifelong\nattraction so when it comes to finding\nthe one how do we do it here are two\nsteps first begin with you build that\nself-awareness there are so many ways to\ndo this but here is a simple way to\nstart figure out your love language some\nof you know gary chapman's five love\nlanguages remind me again what that is\nthe five love languages are words of\naffirmation acts of service giving gifts\nphysical touch or quality time then as\nmuch as possible speak this love\nlanguage to yourself as i write in my\nbook so many of our problems occur when\nwe expect another person to fulfill all\nof our needs and to be everything to us\nit's all about me as marla says we're\nactually capable of meeting far more of\nour own needs than we give ourselves\ncredit for and when we learn to deeply\nlove and support ourselves we have more\nfulfilling relationships because we can\nfreely and gratefully receive what\nothers are willing and able to provide\nwe can love them for who they really are\nand we can be loved for who we really\nare so start by identifying then\nspeaking your own love language to\nyourself tell yourself you look great\nhave you been working out or take a nice\nhot bath buy yourself a gift you'd love\ni'm gonna buy a house or schedule some\nquality solitude time to be in\nrelationship with yourself hey it's fine\nto have a list of what's important to\nyou and what you're looking for and in\nfact that is a good thing when it comes\nto deep core values or goals such as\nwhether you want kids whether the other\nperson treats you with respect and is\ngenuinely interested in learning who you\nare and whether you truly enjoy spending\ntime with them remember those statistics\ni gave earlier about how millennials\naren't getting married well that's only\npart of the picture as anthropologist\nhelen fisher says the majority of\nyounger people today are practicing what\nshe calls slow love they're not just\ngetting married they're waiting to get\nmarried so they can be more sure of\ntheir choice today fisher says 86 of\namericans will marry by age 49 and\naround the world people are still far\nmore likely than not to settle down with\na long-term partner and the good news is\nthat those couples are more likely to\nstay together so that's the second step\npractice slow love really let yourself\nget to know people we struggle with\nambiguity is this person the one or are\nthey not and am i running out of time\nsometimes a match or no match is evident\npretty quickly but in most cases it\ntakes time but knowing yourself and then\nreally getting to know the other person\nfor who they truly are is the perfect\none-two combo for finding real\nlasting\nlong-term\nlove the first time i actually met\nraleigh was\nbefore i became a monk\nand i met her very briefly i thought she\nwas beautiful and\nand and attractive but i didn't really\nthink anything of it like i just\ni genuinely just was so focused on what\ni was doing at life at that time and\ni was so spiritually inclined\nand spiritually focused that i i\nliterally didn't think anything of it\nyeah and my mom introduced me to you\nyes so i should tell that story yeah so\nactually i met rodney's mom even before\ni met her yeah and so i was\ntraining\nto become a monk and i met radhi's mom\nand i was asked to show her how to do a\nparticular\nservice at the temple so i had to take\nher around etc now the incredible thing\nabout this is that that is the only time\nyou ever while i was there that i was\never asked to show another person how to\ndo this service so the one day that i\nhad to show someone how to do this\nparticular service this voluntary\nservice at the temple it was the one day\nthat her mom turned up and at that time\ni didn't know she had a daughter i\ndidn't know anything about this lady i\nwas like oh she's around my mom's age\nyeah and and she was she was wonderful\nand and we got along but i was just\nshowing her what to do and then\nliterally didn't speak to her no and\nthen my mom wanted me to get more\ninvolved in and i really wanted to get\nmore involved in\nlike the spiritual side of my life and\nso she met him and wanted me to\nget introduced to the youth community\nthere and so she passed on my number to\nyou but you passed on to your sister\nyeah absolutely yes i passed it on to my\nsister i was like no i need to stay\nfocused do my thing and my sister's very\nspiritually inclined too big shout out\nto amy\nand\nand then yeah and then you guys got\nconnected and you became friends yeah\nand actually at that point my mom said\nto me oh you know i met this really nice\nreally nice guy at the temple and she\nwas like to me after i met him i prayed\nand i was like i hope my daughter meets\nsomebody like this i know he's going to\nbe a monk but i hope she meets someone\nthat's like this because he seems really\nnice\num little did he know what was going to\nhappen\nand then um never happened he became a\nmonk\ni heard you speak oh i heard him speak\nall the time because he used to do\nlots of\nyouth programs or university talks and\nsessions on philosophy and meditation\nyeah philosophy meditation and i was\njust like oh my gosh he's such an\nincredible speaker and the way that he\nuh makes such incredible wisdom so\nrelevant to us who were like young\nteenagers or\n[Music]\ni'm the one who remembers it yeah i\ndon't remember anything i barely\nremember things happened like two years\nago um so no i wasn't a teenager i was\nout of university\nwhich feels like a long time ago so i\nwas in my 20s and yeah i saw him\nspeaking i just thought it was so\nincredible how he was able to articulate\nsuch\nyeah such deep wisdom in a way that was\nso relevant to\npeople who were so young and and\nprobably wouldn't have been so\ninterested in reading a book about it um\nand so i was in awe of him and he also\nlooked really cool he had like a bold\nhead he didn't look like the type of\nperson who was going to be speaking\nabout these things he had like tattoos\nand a bald head but then he was in robes\nthis is really really cool but weird at\nthe same time\nhe was so strange yeah\nand\nand then it was then when i left being a\nmonk\nwhich is our story in itself we can talk\nabout that another day when i when i\nleft being a monk her and my sister were\nreally really close yeah and me and my\nsister are really really close i trust\nmy sister she's one of my best friends\nand\ni sat down with her one day and she said\nwell you know what bradley likes someone\nand and i was just like oh who and i\njust think she was going to say some\nother person's name and she's like she\nreally likes you\nand i was like\noh i i really like her like i'd love to\nget to know her better and we'd we'd\ninteracted we'd had we'd got to know\neach other a bit better because we'd\norganize charity events together etc and\nso i'd seen her\nnot in\nthe role of being a girlfriend obviously\nor someone that i was dating i'd seen\nher interact with other people\nother other humans\ninside a project management organization\norganizing events so i'd seen her\npersonality and like observed how she\nbehaved around certain people how she\nhad talked to people how she interacted\nwith people and and based on all those\nthings i thought she was a great person\nso\nwhen my sister told me that i was i was\nsecretly quite happy as well and i\nalways heard about him through his\nsister and his sister would talk about\nhim with so much love and affection and\nhe treats her like\nshe's his baby no matter how old she\ngets she's literally like his baby and i\nused to see like conversations between\nthem and he's like oh my gosh he's so\nsweet like he's so sweet even though\nhe's yeah he's gone off being a monk but\nhe was still really really caring and\nloving towards towards his sister and\nhis family\nand then yeah i told her that i liked\nhim before\nbefore uh he knew about it or before\nyou'd probably even thought about it\nyeah yeah\nso then that was it really that's how we\nmet we\nalmost met before i became a monk\nwhen you had a conversation etc yeah\nnever had conversations never spoke but\nbut i just seen each other in our own\nelements yeah and then when i left left\nbeing a monk uh\nyou know\nlater that year we we started going out\nso that was around the towards the end\nof 2013. and then it just went really\nfast we both we both kind of as soon as\nwe spoke about it we both knew that we\nwanted to be with each other and we were\nreally certain about it and\nit could have gone really wrong but we\nwere like we could have both been really\ncrazy um but it ended up just working\nout we both really had kind of\nunderstood each other just by observing\none another i guess and um there were a\nfew surprises i'm sure but um\nwe yeah we got along straight away and\nwe were both pretty much went from yeah\ni really like you too yeah i love you in\nlike a day and then it was like yeah we\nwant to get married in like a week um as\nin we didn't get married in a week but\nwe wanted to we said we wanted to get\nmarried eventually in a week after that\num\nand then we ended up spending a lot of\ntime at each other's homes right\num he was spending a lot of time at my\nhouse for ages\ni mean that's pretty much where i took\nhim to have all of our dates because i\nloved being around my family and i was\nlike best of both worlds i can be around\nthe person that i want to spend the rest\nof my life with and the people that i've\nspent most of my life with\nand so yeah most of our dates would\nwould involve my parents\num and my sister and my brother-in-law\nat the time and so we got to know each\nother kind of in our own environments as\nwell really fast which i think helped\nus fast forward a lot easier yeah\nabsolutely and i remember that my sister\ngave me like an action plan she's like\nthis is all you're going to get along on\nthis is what you're going to struggle\nwith and this is going to be your\nchallenges and and i definitely owe it\nto her to bring us together yeah i think\nshe was a huge part of she was us being\ntogether my sister definitely and and\nshe was like because she knows me so\nwell and i feel she got to know you well\nas well she was just like this is what\nyou guys are going to agree on this is\nwhat you're not going to agree on this\nyeah it was just it was so nice to have\nthat yeah because you could go into a\nrelationship having more understanding\nof the other person can i just say one\nof the things she said that we wouldn't\nget along on is bollywood because i\nloved bollywood songs and films at the\ntime but\nlike a good bollywood song questionable\nquestion yeah questionable yeah\ni decided to get over there yeah\nand you you've barely eaten yeah yeah\nyeah you've got to go\nfor it yeah but yeah we spent a lot of\ntime in each other's parents homes and\nwith our families which was great\nbecause you had to be yourself i used to\nlove what your mom used to tell you my\nmom was so funny so obviously like it\nwas a person to her that was you know we\nwere dating and so usually you would put\nin a lot of effort in the way that you\ndress and uh doing your hair when the\nperson you're dating comes over\nbut um yeah i would literally be in the\nsame clothes that i was wearing like the\nwhole day which was pretty much like\npajama bottoms and and a really scruffy\ntop my mum would be like do you not want\nto maybe you know put a different top on\nor you don't want to change your\ntrousers i was like no mom if he can't\nlove me in what i'm wearing right now\nwhich is what he's probably going to see\nme for the rest of his life then it's\njust not meant to be okay we have like\nhe has to love me for and she would okay\nbut you could try you know a little bit\ni was like no and it worked so\nyeah\nand she's so beautiful and cute like\neven when she's dressed on her bow chic\ni'm just like i love it you know and\nit's quite nice actually like i i\ngenuinely believe this like i\nrarely see her with makeup on yes and so\nlike it's it's fun when you when you\nfall in love with someone based on who\nthey are and their personality and their\nenergy and all of that beauty shines\nthrough so yeah i love you so that leads\nus nicely on to the next point that our\nfriends wanted to discuss which is\nwhat's the key to starting off a\nrelationship well\nlike what's the key to starting it off\nwell so one thing for me was\nwas this that because we didn't see each\nother in\ndating environments a lot\ni feel like dating environments put this\npressure of being in an interview so i\ncompare dates to interviews it's almost\nlike you have to put your best foot\nforward you wear your best clothes you\ntry and say all the best things and even\nif it's not the best actually it's us\ntrying to be right and that's what we do\nin interviews when you go an interview\nfor a job it's like you want to be the\nright fit for that person yeah and\nthat's what happens in a dating scenario\nlike you're sitting opposite desk just\nlike you're doing an interview\nand then someone's asking you a question\nand you're like okay well what do i have\nto say to make them like me or to say\nthe right thing whereas we didn't really\nget to do that no and i'm not saying\nthat that was a conscious choice but now\nwhen i look back at it and i reflect on\nit and introspect on it i'm like we\ndidn't really get an opportunity to date\nin that sense and that means that i got\nexposed to the real her either by seeing\nher in a charity organization seeing her\nin a real life scenario how does she\ntreat normal people\nand then how she's with her family and\ni'm like that's the best view you can\nget of someone and so when i look at\nthat in terms of giving advice or tips\nor whatever\nmy recommendation is\nbe around people that you're thinking\nabout being with in an environment where\nthey're just being themselves because\nchances are if you like them the way\nthey are when they are with other people\nthen you're likely to love them when\nthey're with you too and so often we\nonly see people\nthat we are considering being romantic\nwith or dating etc we only see them in\ndates and dinners and movie nights and\nwhatever it is right\nyeah i agree i feel like you see and\nalso seeing people with the people that\nthey're closest to because you can't\nreally fake it with the people that\nyou're closest to i mean if you can you\ncould do it for a really short period of\ntime and you also end up seeing them\nbeing probably at their worst and at\ntheir best because you can be the most\nloving to your family but you can also\nbe the worst person towards your family\nbecause they're the ones that accept it\nand so yeah i feel like you get a good\nimage of who the person is through\nthrough interacting with them that way\nabsolutely yeah good point thanks nicely\nsaid\nit's true yeah and\nand the other thing is\ni so when we first got together i'd left\nbeing a monk probably like seven months\nbefore so it's been like a seven month\ngap\nand i didn't have a job\noh yeah i had no job i had no money no i\nwas getting rejected left right and\ncenter from every single place that i\nwas applying to because i'd been a monk\nfor three years and no one wanted to\nhire someone who had monk written on\ntheir resume like no one's like oh yeah\ni would love your transferable skills\nlike you know like what do you know and\nso oh you can meditate for four hours\ngreat we need that in our organization\nso it was just there was no\ni had nothing really yeah and\nthat's a great way to start dating\nsomeone because there's very i remember\ni used to save up so i used to like try\nand work part-time\nand i was doing everything i could you\nwere tutoring i was tutoring so i would\nlike i would be tutoring young people\nfor their exams or university exams et\ncetera and i would be making like you\nknow 15 pounds an hour or whatever it\nwas and i remember i'd save up so i\ncould take her out on a date at the end\nof the month and so that we could do\nsomething fun\nand and i loved the fact i loved that\nbecause i met her at a time when when i\nhad nothing and she accepted me for it\nyeah i love her for that and also\nher parents were always really cool\nabout it so sometimes that can be a big\npressure from parents and expectations\nbut her parents were really cool about\nit they never made me feel uncomfortable\nabout it or anything and my parents\nobviously were very comfortable with me\nthey were just like follow your heart do\nwhat's right for you very very\nencouraging and i'm not i don't come\nfrom a well of background at all or\nanything so it's not that i had a backup\nplan but my parents were still very very\nencouraging and supportive\nyeah i\ni that was never\nin my mind to be honest i was i knew i\nwanted to be with you and so i was like\nto my mom even if we end up living in a\nreally tiny house just by like near the\ntemple that i used to go to and just i\nknow that i want to spend my life with\nhim so whatever it ends up being and you\nwere really really\nenthusiastic and you had so much purpose\nand even from the beginning like you\nwere so driven to do whatever you wanted\nto do i didn't know what that was at the\ntime\nbut you were so driven that i just knew\nwhatever it was whatever we were meant\nto be was what was gonna happen and so\nand i knew you would never you're always\nlike gonna be there to take care of me\nand i felt that from the beginning like\ni always felt supported you wanna hold\nhands yeah i'm not good at pda so i'm\ngonna not do that oh my god\n[Music]\nit was it was really nice and i feel\nlike he had a lot of the qualities that\ni always felt\ni would always grow up saying oh i\nreally want a husband that was like my\ndad like i love my dad and he was always\nsomeone that i felt very protected and\nsupported by and so i just definitely\nnow looking back at it i felt those\nqualities in him as i got to know him\nand so i thought yeah that was that was\nnice and my parents yeah my parents my\nparents and kerry that i always thought\nit would be you know you always think in\nindian families that's going to be an\nissue\nbut they loved him from the start he's\ngot really good i don't know what you\nguys have noticed but he's got a really\ngood way of saying things and and\nwinning people over by his words so it's\nreal though i know that's why it's\ngenuine and it's sweet so from those\ninteractions i think my parents trusted\nhim very easily as well um i really get\nalong with your parents i know yeah and\nit was so great for me because amy was\nalready like my sister and me and your\nmom got along straight away because we\nbonded over food and so yeah it was\nreally easy for us both to to join into\neach family\nbut yeah another thing i think that's\nreally important at the start of a\nrelationship\nis\nself-awareness and setting expectations\nso i feel that having done the work as a\nmonk and having been through that\nexperience myself i'd gained so much\nself-awareness so i was really aware of\nwhat type of partner i needed in my life\ni was really aware of what i needed in\nmy life to flourish to thrive and so\nwhen i met someone it was very easy for\nme\nit was very easy and simple for me to\ncommunicate my expectations to her and\nbe like\ni i remember one of the things i said\nand this is not offensive at all it's\ngenuinely how i felt at the time and i\nsaid that if you want a husband who goes\nto ikea on the weekends and to the\ncinema like i'm not that guy and i\ndidn't mean that as a bad thing if\nanyone is that what i meant that as is i\nwant to be someone who lives their lives\nof purpose and i want my life to be\nabout service and i want my life to have\nan impact on people's lives and i need a\npartner that's going to\nunderstand that embrace that and roll\nwith that as well and wants to live\nnot a normal life because that wasn't\ngoing to work for me if i really wanted\nto have an impact if i really wanted to\nmake a difference if i really wanted to\nserve and so that wasn't an ego thing it\nwasn't me thinking i'm better or above\nor special it was me saying this is a\npriority for me\nand i don't need it to be your priority\nbut i need you to understand it to be\nmine and i think this is really\nimportant that we should feel that if\nwe're genuinely committed to something\nwhen you make someone aware and same\nback from her side too like when she and\nshe'll share hers but when she's made me\naware of what her priorities are and\nwhat's important to her you start\nrespecting what's important to the other\nperson rather than expecting them to\ntrade theirs right and that's usually\nwhat happens in relationships in the\nbeginning is instead of showing respect\nfor the other people's passion you\nexpect them to change their passion for\nyours or compromise and be excited about\nyour stuff and and i don't think that\nthat's the right way i think it's us\nbeing clear about ourselves\ncommunicating that and then respecting\nwhat the other person communicates yeah\ni think we discussed that really early\non actually yeah just to be clear he has\ncome to ikea with me on the weekends\nand movies\num but you know i understood the point\nof it and i remember at that time when\nhe was really pushing for what he wanted\nto do\num he was very very busy and so there\nwere certain things i mean he spent a\nlot of time with me and my family but we\nhad just agreed that look if there was\nextended things that i had to go to\nbecause with families there's always\nother things that you have to go to like\nfamily friends or relatives houses for\nevery event possible and if that\nhappened\nthen i knew that i was okay with him not\ncoming to them and i said that to him\nfrom the beginning\nif you need to go and do something which\nis i know for you more important not\nbecause for the purpose that you want to\nlive then i totally understand that\ncomes above you just coming to another\nparty which people are not probably\ngoing to remember like it's okay um and\ni think that was really actually really\nimportant for us because you can always\nhear what other people say like family\nmembers or friends or whatever will\nalways have a different opinion and so\nas long as you feel like\nyou have\ndiscussed it and you really understand\nthat person's point of view then you\ndon't feel kind of it doesn't rub off on\nyou when people say things because you\nunderstand it deeply whereas if you\ndon't then i think it's really easy to\nget swayed by other people's view of\nlife or other people's way of\nrelationships or whatever it is like you\ncan get that can rub off on you very\neasily but if you really understand that\nperson and why they're doing it i think\nthat can make a big difference to you\nsupporting them in why then why they're\ndoing it\nthank you\nthe first question that i have from our\nteam\nis\nwhat do you find hardest about love\ni was actually thinking about this this\nmorning when i think about coming and\nspeaking here speaking here coming and\nspeaking to you um and i was thinking\nabout how you know a lot of the time\nwhen you end up feeling um annoyed at\nyour partner or irritated in some way or\nwhen they really annoy you\num i actually actually made me realize\nthat a lot of the time you know they say\nit ends up being a reflection of you\nand i think a lot of\nwhen i think about what ends up like\nwhen we have our like petty arguments or\nwhatever it is i feel like it's actually\nbecause it hits at a sore point of me\nrealizing that it's it's my whatever\nwe're arguing about how i'm reacting\nit's my weakness and a lot of the time\nthat stubbornness and so i feel like\nwhenever we i think that's quite that's\nquite a difficult thing when it comes to\nrelationships or love is that the other\nperson because you spend so much time\nwith them and because um you know they\nthey know you better than anybody else\nthat they end up being a reflection of\nactually you so every time you end up\nhaving interactions with them that\naren't that great actually a lot of the\ntime you can sit there and be like maybe\nthat had a lot more to do with me how i\nreacted rather than that other person\nbut sometimes it's them too\nthat's a really good answer that's a\nreally good answer i think that's such a\ngood point i was i think what i'm saying\nis i would second that\nand to give another answer to give a\ndifferent answer i also feel the hardest\nthing in a relationship is you're always\nprojecting\nyour strengths onto the other person's\nweaknesses\nso\nyou want the other person to be more\nlike you\nbut when you really think about it you\ndon't like you yeah yeah you love the\nother person for not being like you\nbut when you say things like i'll give\nan example that\ni'm\nsuper organized disciplined lived by the\nschedule on time\nwho am i and and and at times in our\nrelationship i've wanted you to become\nlike that yeah and do things like me\nand when i've really sat with that and\nreally thought with that i realized\nactually i don't want you to be like me\nbecause i love you for not being me yeah\nand\nthe things that you bring to this\nrelationship whether it's spontaneity\nwhether it's being fresh whether it's\nbeing always alive like\nthat's the strength\nand i think what we do in relationships\nis we dampen our partner's strengths\ninstead of amplifying them yeah\nand what that does is it makes your\npartner feel like they have to do\nsomething different or be something\ndifferent but actually if you amplify\ntheir strengths which is the part you\nlove anyway yeah you're going to have a\nmuch more\nfulfilling and exciting relationship so\ni think that i find that hard because i\nthink we all live in our heads yeah it's\nso true and we think the way we think is\nthe right hey what do you want to do\ntomorrow and you're like well i kind of\nhave a nine to five like six schedule\nready to go for the next like six months\nand i'm like oh\nso you don't want to go shopping with me\nor you don't want to go to like get some\nplans\nand yeah no i agree and and i feel like\nit's but i also think from\nfrom that that you know it also helps\neven if you're not doing even if you\nfeel like it's a negative thing to um to\nnotice that and to um\nto try and correct it in the same way i\nthink you can also help the other person\ntighten up on that area of their life\ntoo like okay cool you may be super\norganized and i may be not very\norganized at all but at the same time we\ncan find like a good middle ground when\nwe're together where it's like okay you\nknow that i like being spontaneous so\nmaybe randomly you'll be like okay cool\nlike what you do you're like oh you know\ni won't i'll just cancel my meeting or\ni'll i'll i won't do this and let's just\ngo do this and for me i'm like oh okay\nand i i know that i try to be a little\nbit more organized where i'm like okay i\nneed to make sure i do this today i need\nto make sure i give you this today like\nwhatever it is like trying to\ntrying to make that better as well\nbecause even though it's a strength in\nsome ways every strength ends up being a\nweakness in some way too so i think it\nhelps you know kind of balance it out as\nwell and and help the other person\nnotice when they need to probably\nchange a little bit\nabsolutely okay second question is\nhow did your relationship change in 2020\nhow did you i kind of feel like\nthis felt like our like first year of\nmarriage because we um probably well no\nnot probably we have not spent this much\ntime together in our whole entire\nrelationship and so i kind of feel like\nfor me it felt like we were on our\nhoneymoon type field where we just got\nmarried and we were learning so much\nmore about each other but\nbut then we ended up um yeah just just\nreally understanding one another and\nsettling into each other a lot better\nthan we probably even have for the past\nhow many have been married like three\nyears four years i've nearly been\nmarried five years nearly five years but\nit feels like one year um but yeah no i\nthink it really made us um\nit really helped us understand each\nother better it helped us get into a\nrhythm together which i don't feel like\nwe ever really had a rhythm together\num\nand so i think it's actually changed um\nin most like in i can't think of any\nways that it's changing and negative i\nreally think that it's improved our\nrelationship through figuring a lot of\nstuff out but it's definitely got to a\npoint now where i'm like oh wow this\nthat whole year\nwas definitely a good jump or a good\nstep up for us yeah i'd have to say one\nof my favorite things was\nit was the first year where we started\ndoing a lot of\nphysical activity together\nbecause we always go and like travel\ntogether or something like that but it\nwas the first year we started actually\nworking out and exercising together yeah\nso we used to go on hikes up griffiths\npark\nand then runyon\nand then we'd go on walks and just so\nmany\nopportunities to be in nature together\nbecause we weren't going to the gym and\nthen we were doing in-home workouts\ntogether with a virtual workout\nand we'd put our playlist on with that\nsong that you were talking about the\nother day\nthat's the song of 2020 for me and i\njust think that we were forced to just\nspend so much time together but we\nactually found ways to do things we\nenjoyed together i think we actually\nrealized that um we were spending time\ntogether in the wrong ways before like i\nfeel like that's what it made us realize\nthat we thought going shopping together\nor going to watch a movie together was\nlike and sitting and watching a movie\ntogether were the ways that we would be\nspending time together and then we\nrealized that actually we just really\nenjoy doing\nwhether it's like normal things like\nworking out but it feels so much more\nfun for us than sitting there and doing\nsomething that feel i don't know i don't\nhave to explain it but yeah like\nsomething that when we're not talking or\nwe're not interacting um\nand the focus is somewhere else whereas\nthis it's like you're completely focused\non the activity completely focused on\nthe other person\nand um it was just so much more fun to\ndo that stuff together even if it is\njust like working out and or going for a\nwalk or whatever it is but it felt so\nmuch more interactive and\nlike yeah so much more fun yeah and for\neveryone who's listening and watching\nthis was the year\nthat radhi and i've spent the most\nactual time together since we've been\nmarried yeah and since we were dating\nbecause i'm always traveling she's back\nat home in london sometimes she's\ntraveling\nand for us to be in this space together\nwe we had to focus on learning about\neach other even more so\nit was a big change for us yeah\nand\nlike radi said i i think the same i\nthink it just brought about positives\nfor us thankfully\nand\nyou know we we grew a lot closer this\nyear yeah and i do think it's also\nbecause we\nit i don't feel like it it felt natural\nbut at the same time it was natural\nbecause we were both very aware and\nintentional of how we were interacting\nwith the other person because of how bad\nit's gone in the past i feel like we\nhave been able to use all of those\nmistakes that we made where we were\nreally trying to figure out a way for it\nto be better like we both had the\nintention of making it better\nwhether it was like quarantine whether\nit was whatever it was that like i feel\nlike we'd gone through so many\ntimes where we tried and it may be like\nwe still weren't understanding each\nother we were like no this time we both\nactually really want to intentionally\nmake an effort to\nhave conversations that we maybe don't\nhave to um\nresolve things in a way that we don't\nnormally resolve things and so yeah i\nthink i think that that's also important\nbecause it wasn't just like oh this was\nnice like it just happened this way i\nfeel like it was definitely something we\nthought about and tried as well\ni'll do a question for you\num\ni was thinking about this earlier too\nlike and i was gonna ask you separately\nbut i thought why not ask you on here\nput you on the spot um what is\nlike okay for example you know in a\nrelationship when one person asks the\nother person to do something like i\nalways think about this with you because\nyou always regardless of when i ask you\nto do something no matter if you're like\nlet's say something simple like we're\nboth sitting watching something and i'm\nliterally like to you oh i really want\nthis and like i haven't even asked you\nto do it but you'll literally get up and\nyou'll go and do it for me or like i'll\nask you to go get something and you're\nlike you won't even flinch like you'll\ngo out of your way to do it and actually\ni was thinking about it and like that\nseems like such a small thing\nbut i actually feel like it's not\nbecause a lot of the time where even if\nit's with your mom your dad whatever he\nsays oh do i really have to go and get\nit like can't you just go do it yourself\nbut you i feel have\ngenerally always been like that and so\ni'm just gonna ask you because i think\nit'll be helpful for other people too\nand helpful for me like what goes\nthrough your mind when\neven if i'm being really irritating or\nbeing a brat like what makes you just\ncontinually do that without\nyeah without like moaning the first\nthing that goes through my mind is you\nare such a brat yeah\nyou are you are closer to that light\nswitch right now you are closer to the\nwater container right now yeah why are\nyou asking me to do this that that's the\nfirst thing that goes through my life\nand then and then my monk mine comes in\nand\nthere's two sides to it first of all i\nknow you're not asking me\nbecause\nyou're trying to make my life difficult\nyou're doing it because you want to be\nloved that way\nand\nmaybe yeah and and i think that when you\nrealize if you're in a loving trusting\nrelationship you start realizing that\nyour partner's requests even if they\nseem unreasonable and irrational a lot\nof the time that's just how you want to\nbe loved in that moment and when you see\nit in that way yeah you go yeah of\ncourse i want to love you in that way\nbecause you're not doing it to hurt me\nbecause i know you love me you're not\ndoing it to upset me you're obviously\nnot doing it to irritate me\nso then the only reason you could be\ndoing that is because you need some love\nright now and you need love in that way\nor you need connection in that way or\nyou need intimacy in that way\nand so you're asking for it because it's\na request for love\nand i think we think of requests for\nlove as like oh give me a hug or i need\nto talk to you\nwe think of those things but actually\nit's the day-to-day moments in the small\nthings where someone's saying please\nlove me\nplease see me please show up for me\nplease bring me a snack please bring me\na snack\nand and i think we mistake that language\nbecause we think oh that person's being\nso irritable so demanding so demanding\nand maybe they are and and that's\nsomething that you have to check for\nyourself so\nif you are that person\nrather then then you have to check for\nyourself whether it is demanding and\nstubborn or whether it is a\nrequest for love yeah for yourself but\ni've made it in my mind that i believe\nyou love me and so if i believe you love\nme then i should believe that this is\nyou asking for love\nand so but if i didn't believe you loved\nme and i was then it was so annoying\nthen it would be really annoying yeah\nand so it doesn't mean that i don't have\nthat thought it doesn't mean that i\ndon't get internally frustrated with you\nfor a second\nand then straight after that this kicks\nin and that walks me through it and i\nthink\nwhen when people sometimes\nsay to me like oh well haven't you got\nit all figured out i'm like no the first\nthought is never\nthe thought that has it all figured out\nthe first thought is always\noh gosh whatever whatever whatever yeah\nit's the second thought it's\nit's taking that time to have that\nsecond thought rather than reacting to\nthe first yeah yeah so that's the answer\nto that question\nthat's great thank you i've always\nwanted that\ni have actually\nso this question came in from our team\nit says tell me about a time\nwhere\nyou think we've made a compromise and\nhow did it work out i'm going to go\nfirst i know the first thing you're\ngoing to say is i don't believe in\ncompromises in relationships you know me\nso well so that's exactly what i was\ngonna say i was like as soon as i hear\nthe word compromise i have a\ni have a very interesting relationship\nwith the word compromise because i\nbelieve that compromise makes you feel\nthat both of you are giving up something\nyou want\nfor something you both don't want oh\nyeah which doesn't make any sense repeat\nthat repeat that\nrewind\nthat's a good point go on\nhave a have a j moment\nso\nso i have a really interesting\nrelationship with the word compromise\nbecause i don't understand\nwhat compromise means is that you're\nboth giving up something you both want\nfor something both of you don't want\nthat's what a compromise is so it feels\nlike\none person is getting what they want and\nthe other person is not getting what\nthey want that's what a compromise is\nwhereas what i\nhave tried to live by in our\nrelationship is i want you to get what\nyou want and i want to get what i want\nnow if that doesn't\nmesh all the time or if that doesn't\nconnect all the time then the only thing\nthat's being compromised\nis this false view that we should always\nfeel the same way about everything\nand i think that just makes\nthat actually makes space for resentment\nit makes space for bitterness it's\nalmost like think about this everyone\nwho's listening and watching think about\nthis for a moment imagine\ni gave up what i wanted to do all the\ntime\nto be where radhi wanted me to be\ni'm going to be feeling upset i'm going\nto be thinking i should be doing this or\ni could be doing this and then you\ndevelop bitterness towards the other\nperson where you can't even respect and\nappreciate them and if you were always\ndragged to what i'm doing\nyou may be thinking well i could be\ndoing this or i could be doing that and\nwhat ends up happening is i feel like\nyou actually move\ncloser away\nby forcing yourself together we say that\nagain you actually end up you actually\nend up moving further further away you\nactually end up moving further away\nby forcing yourself to be together yes\nwhen actually you could move closer\ntogether by allowing yourselves to have\nthat space\nso that's my relationship with the word\ncompromise we've both been very happy\nfor the other person to live freely to\ndo what they want to do and without\npressure of being like okay cool it's my\nfriend's birthday for example\nand if you're not that interested in\ncoming or i'm not that interested in\ncoming with you it's not like oh my gosh\nbut you have to come like we're a couple\nwe can't go places without one another\nlike we're just okay cool like you don't\nneed to go and we understand that too\nit's like yeah it's gonna be boring for\nyou like you don't need to come with me\nand we're very good at making it quite\nclear if something is important to us\nwhether it's family stuff whether it's\nwhatever say okay cool you don't need to\ncome to this family thing but i would\nreally appreciate it if you could make\nsome time and and come here and so i\nthink it's also that where\nit doesn't feel like a compromise if one\nthe you know that it's that it's the\nsame thing as what you were saying about\nthe\nbringing me water or snacks it's like\nyou know that the person loves you and\nso\nif they if you make explicitly clear\nwhat's valuable to you and they still\ndon't feel and you still don't feel\nheard by them then that's one thing but\nlike if i know that you love me and you\nknow what's important to me i feel like\nyou always know when you need to show up\nand if for example you haven't and i may\nnot have communicated it to you if i\ntell you afterwards it's always like oh\ni'm so sorry i had no idea that's how\nyou felt um and so yeah i think it's\nimportant one like letting the other\nperson know what is of value to you and\nwhether it's actually that important not\nbeing like oh come with me and the\nperson says no and then you're like oh\nokay fine like it's it doesn't have to\nbe like that it can be a oh but please i\nreally i like this is really important\nto me so it's being is communicating and\nletting you know about that and also\nyeah understanding that the other person\nloves you and that if they are saying no\nit's not because they're trying to hurt\nyou it's because they maybe genuinely\nhave something that's more important to\ngo to or to do\nyeah and i think you're right that you\nthat's a really good point because you\nexpect the other person to read your\nmind and to know why it should be\nimportant to you and yeah yeah yeah you\noften have that thought like you should\nknow this is important to me yeah\nbut but the truth is that in every\nrelationship like no one knows until you\nexplain to them and i think in our\nlove relationships and our romantic even\nin our friendships yeah we just expect\neveryone to fully know what we value\nyeah it's like with even with family for\nexample just if if someone is really\nclose to their family you expect in your\nmind that they realize that that's an\nimportant thing but if for example that\nperson is not that close to their family\nin their mind it's like oh it's my\nuncle's birthday come to my uncle's\nbirthday and you're like i won't even go\nto my own not you but generally someone\nelse might be like oh i won't even go to\nmy own uncle's birthday because i'm not\nthat close to them so i think it's like\nyou are expecting the other person to\nlive how you live and how you have your\nrelationships or how you value things\nand it's it's an unfair expectation\nbecause people have been through so many\ndifferent things in life awesome all\nright next question on the list next up\nis we both have such hectic schedules\nin life and lots of work going on and\nall our commitments how do we find time\nto spend time alone and time with each\nother i guess that a lot actually i have\nso many so my family member is always\nlike but does he have time to spend with\nyou like do you guys have time and i was\nspeaking to one of my um family friends\nthe other day and she was just like are\nyou sure you guys spend time with each\nother and i was like yeah we spend a lot\nof time together but but i can\nunderstand why people may think that but\nyeah you know what i don't feel like\nwe've ever really felt i i feel like\neven if we've had the moments where\nwe've had like months apart\nwe do make an effort that when we are\ntogether especially recently within the\npast year\nor two years would you say you say two\nyears we've started doing yeah we\nstarted doing a thing where we make sure\nthat we have at least a weekend that we\nspend solid together and sometimes\nthat's more time that you spend together\neven if you were seeing someone every\nsingle day for like a month because it's\ncondensed time it's it's intentional\nand it's um with the sole purpose to\nspend time together and communicate um\nand be together in a meaningful way so\nyeah we definitely um make that time but\nit's also because we choose to do that\nyeah i think we both\nthankfully gravitate towards quality\ntime versus quantity of time\nand so\nwe'll both be like well if we're both\ntired today\nwe'd rather not force ourselves to try\nand spend time together and give each\nother space or give each other time to\ndecompress and this weekend we'll make\nsure we spend time together\nrather than the artificial force of like\ntoday\nwe had to spend time together because we\npromised or we said we would and it's\nlike but maybe we're both not got the\nright energy right now\nwe haven't got that presence right now\nand so\ni think it's a mutual understanding at\nthe same time i feel like\nyou know they've been different parts in\nour relationship like i remember when we\nlived in new york\nwe probably didn't spend a lot of\nquality time together because\nthe only time i had off was the weekends\nand i was busy working sometimes too and\nyou were doing all your courses and your\nwork on the weekends and so i spent a\nton of my weekends\nalone and you spent a ton of your weeks\nweekends weekdays alone yeah yeah and\nif you think back that's that's\nliterally the pattern of our life for\ntwo years and then there was travel to\nlondon and and everywhere else i was\ngoing and i think through all of that it\nwas always just about savoring those\nmoments it was about really cherishing\nand realizing that we were in a building\nphase and so i want to address something\nhere actually that i think will be\nreally interesting for people is\ni talk a lot about like the five cycles\nof life that we all go through so we\nhave learn\nexperiment\nperform struggle thrive\nand so these like different stages you\ngo through every year\nand\nwhen we were in new york we were in a\nbuild phase of our life like we were\nboth building we just got married i'd\nliterally just started my career you\nwere discovering your career we were in\na build phase yeah and i think when you\nexpect a lot from your partner when\nyou're both building it can be really\ndemanding\nbut now we're at a stage in our life\nwhere certain things we're performing in\nwhere\ni've got a bit of a rhythm and a role\nand so i'm able to give more time and\nyou're in this different stage in your\nlife and i feel like when you start\nlooking at your life as stages yeah as\nopposed to like everything this is gonna\nbe forever forever yeah it's like\nit can't be that way and there's\nactually a really good book on this by\ngary chapman\nand i think it's called the four seasons\nof love or the four seasons of marriage\nor relationships and it talks about how\nis your\nis your relationship right now in the\nseason\nof summer winter\nspring or autumn now when i think about\nthis i think that all of us want our\nrelationship to always be in summer i\nmean i like winter but oh yeah okay yeah\nyou just really well oh yeah\nyeah we always want our relationship to\nbe in summer in the sense that it's hot\nit's passionate it's cool it's like\neverything's good about summer right we\nall look forward to summer but maybe\nyour relationship's at a point in life\nright now as this book says that your\nrelationship might be in winter it's\ngoing for a dark period a cold period\nwhere you just got to stick it out\ntogether yeah when i think about new\nyork\nyeah when i think about us in new york\nit was a bit of winter and spring\nyeah like it was a bit of winter and\nspring and autumn's like where you've\ngot to let go and you've got to shed and\ni think about when we first started\ndating there were moments where our\nrelationship was in autumn yeah well we\nwere just letting things go\nand purging and removing energy i know\nwhen you were going to yoga classes and\nyeah yoga teacher training\nso i just i think that book's a great\nmodel and that reflection that i've had\nfor a while that your life goes through\nstages and seasons\nand stop trying to make every\nday and every week summer yeah i really\nlove that that's so cool what a great\nbook yeah i had a reflection i started\nresearching and then i found the book\nand the way i was thinking about it is\nlike if you know it's winter you take an\numbrella out yeah it's winter you put a\ncoat on yeah but if you think it's\nsummer you keep expecting your partner\nto you know\nanyway so\nthis is an interesting question what\nfilm or tv show do you think offers the\nbest example of a healthy relationship\noh my gosh that's such a good question i\nautomatically in my mind\ngo to um this is us because one of my\nfavorite shows ever i've never seen it\nyou've never seen it but it's so good\nand\num we love chrissy our good friend love\nchrissy\num but there are actually really lovely\nexamples of couples who like\nmake it through stuff in that whether\nit's like the main couple i'm sure to be\nhonest most people have probably seen it\nyou just odd one out but um\nyeah the the main mum and dad and then\nthere's um sterling what's his name\nsterling brown sterling\nthe actor yeah probably yeah i think\nthat's something sterling or sterling\nsomething you'll know who i mean uh but\ntheir relationship is amazing because\nthey go through so many ups and downs\nbut they're so good at communication and\ni i feel like that's a very good show\nto show very different types of\nrelationships even chrissy's\nrelationship with her partner her\nhusband on the show they're all so\ndifferent in the relationships and the\nway they communicate\nbut they show very good um\nyeah very\nvery realistic and and uh useful\nrelationships i feel yeah\nso good i actually struggle with this\nquestion because i think hey i don't\nwatch a lot of tv shows but i do watch a\nlot of movies\nand i think growing up i had a really\nunhealthy view of love because of movies\nit's so true so i grew up watching\nbollywood movies\na lot and i remember thinking that\nthat's what love had to look like yeah\nlike a flower comes up in the middle\nwhen two people are about to kiss yeah\nthey do in bollywood or like you're all\nlike dancing around and like there's all\nthis like field there's all this puppies\nyeah and like music's playing when you\nfall in love i'm running towards you in\nslow motion and my hair naturally falls\nlike this\nyeah and you're coming towards me and\nthen it cuts because they don't show\nanything else in bollywood films yeah\nback in the day and so so that's what\nyou\ni grew up with unhealthy projections of\nlove yeah and\nthe the thing that comes to mind when i\nam thinking about this\napart from the last dance michael jordan\ndocumentary which doesn't show marriage\nbut shows like love in a team and\ncamaraderie and collaboration i'll try\nand find a bit more of a i i actually\nthink the happy place uh the good place\nsorry the good stuff i always call it\nthe happy place kristen bell's character\neleanor and her relationship with chidi\nlike the way it shows relationship\ndynamics is really interesting about\nlike what is a good relationship what is\nsupport what is friendship like i think\nit answers a lot of deeper questions\nyeah that is such a good show it's such\na great show i'm enjoying it so much and\nwe came to it late but but we're loving\nit yeah and i just think it has so many\ngood messages so i'd have to go with\nthat okay cool this is us and happy\nplace yeah no is it the good place good\nplace yeah i call it the happy place\nas well and and yeah and i'm going back\nto what the shows i grew up and i grew\nup on the oc and desperate housewives\nboth not good good examples of\nrelationship ideas and and friends you\ngrew up on which again did you get i\nwouldn't say it's like the best\nrelationship stuff it's just comedy and\nyeah but i agree with movies it's for\ngirls and for guys i guess i guess i\ndidn't think that it was such a big\nthing for guys because you never i don't\nknow growing up i always think guys just\nlike i'm thinking about like romance in\nthat stage of their life but for girls i\nthink for sure you're just always seeing\nhow like\nthe\nthe girls like the damsel in distress\nand the guy like saves him saves her and\ni think it's um\nyeah movies mess you up\nokay this is an interesting question do\nhave you ever experienced doubt in our\nrelationship\nand how do you express doubt\n[Music]\ni guess maybe like right at the\nbeginning when\num\ni'm trying to think i'm sure i did write\nthe beginning and then like you know\njust before you're getting married and\nlike everything's like a bit confusing\nand there's just so much going on\nbecause of wedding and then you're like\noh my gosh i have to get married to this\nperson really\nyeah i think probably just i guess just\nat the beginning when everything was so\nup in the air because like you know\nas uh\ni'm sure in most cultures but in our\nculture it's like the man should have a\njob and the man should be the bread\nwinner and like which is not true you\nshould have no which is not true but and\nhe should have everything figured out\nbefore you get into a relationship with\nthat person like everything should\nalready be set before you even think\nabout marriage um and we really didn't\nhave that\nand so i think probably the beginning\nbut i was so lucky because my mum and\ndad really were just so okay\nthat i naturally feel doubts can come\ninto your mind when other people get in\nyour mind um but i think i was quite\nsure i felt like i felt like\nstraight away i knew i had a connection\nwith you i knew that your values and the\nperson that you were\num\ni i just knew we would be able to grow\nso deeply together um and that's really\nwhat i was focusing on and then i was so\nlucky that the rest of everything else\nfell into place\nbut and i'm so grateful for that but i i\nknew that the core thing that i wanted\nin the relationship was there\nfor us to grow\ndeeper in our spiritual lives together\nand that was the main focus for me and\nthen\nyeah and then we started having fun i\nwas like oh he is fun like he's just not\njust like a teacher and like just\nso deep but you also were so fun and and\nall the things that i maybe hadn't\nthought about was important to me slowly\nstarted coming i was like oh that is\nreally important to me gosh i didn't\nrealize that at the beginning that\nthat's what i wanted um\nbut yes the doubt was definitely um\nwas definitely\nlike taken away by\nme constantly going back to the fact\nthat i wanted to be in that relationship\nwith you for that reason\nand um yeah yeah that's a that's a good\nhonest answer yeah i think\ni think my only doubt was\nalways and and it's funny because it's\nso hard to express this because i\nremember\nit was really funny when your family\nhad mentioned this to you and it was\nlike are you sure he's not going to run\nback and be a monk\nback to the monastery\nand it's so interesting because my only\ndoubt in our relationship previously\nnot anymore had ever been that\nshould i have been alone yeah so my\ndoubt was never like you or another\nperson or if you were the right person\nyeah it's always been\nit's either you or me being alone\nand and i think that comes from me\nloving being alone and spending so much\ntime alone and i think there was a part\nof our relationship where because i was\nspending long periods on my own yeah i\nalways considered that and i and i had\nthat\nconsideration of like oh is this what\ni'm meant to be doing like should i have\ndone this like i and i think a bit part\nof my doubt came from a\ncame from a bit of sadness that i was\nlike oh am i taking her away from her\nfamily\nam i taking her you did her dreams am i\ntaking like that was where my doubt of\nshould i have been alone came from was\noh no maybe i'm like for my pursuing of\nmy purpose\nwhich i'm\nreally\ndedicated to totally yeah am i taking\nher away\nthat was where my doubt came from that\nam i so selfish that maybe i should be\ndoing my purpose alone why should i drag\nsomeone else on my journey and i\nactually think in the beginning i\nprobably felt that way too like i i\nprobably when we went to new york it\ndefinitely felt like compromising\nbecause i felt like the only thing i\nreally had at that time in my life that\ni truly valued and felt i was very\nconcrete in was my family and that's\nwhat my whole life revolved around and\nso i guess at the beginning because i\nhadn't matured in my thoughts of of what\nthis relationship was i did feel like\nthat and i and i remember there used to\nbe times i was like well\num\ni can't remember but i'm sure that there\nwere moments where in my mind and felt\nlike well we have to go back for my\nfamily to do this because you've taken\nme away anyway like you've taken me to\nnew york and so now we have to do this\nbecause i want to do this or we have to\nlike you need to do this for me because\nwe've done this for you\nand um\nyeah but but i but i definitely\nnow looking back i realized actually it\nwas all so much more for like it so i i\ndon't feel that way at all anymore but i\ncan um yeah i can i can relate i\nprobably had those feelings a little bit\nat the beginning that you're you're\nprobably feeling from me\nno it's good i i think these are great\nconversations to have and what's\ninteresting about these conversations\nthough is that\nsometimes you don't have them in the\nmoment yeah if you don't monitor that\nwell that could end up breaking\nsomething definitely and we're lucky\nthat it didn't i feel like it could have\nthere if i hadn't if if i then didn't\nchoose to like figure out what was going\non with me and i was projecting that all\non you and making it feel like it was it\nwas the issue was our relationship or\nthe issue was you but really it was me\nhaving a lack of awareness of myself\nthat i had to i had to do that otherwise\ni think i would have constantly kept\nblaming on that and constantly felt that\nway and i have so much admiration for\nyou and respect for you because of that\nbecause i think that it's so easy\ni was always trying to compensate and\nhelp in whatever way i could but\ni feel like\nyou doing that\nis what's made our relationship so\nstrong is that you've just really worked\nhard on the last few years of finding\nyourself discovering yourself working\nand you've tried a lot of things like\nyeah you've it's not been easy and\nyou know i i feel like i found my thing\nwhen i was 18 and\ni've been doing it for 15 years and it's\nfunny for me to think that because a lot\nof people\nonline are like oh jay you've only been\ndoing this online for like three or four\nyears and i've been doing this for 15\nyears\nbut for you i've watched you since that\nwe've met which was you know sorry since\nwe've been together which is what nearly\neight years now\nand\ni've seen you like try this try that\nexperiment with this and actually it's\nbeen really amazing why don't you tell\npeople about how you feel\nyour journey's been of discovering your\nreal passion because i think people see\nyou now and you've got your amazing\nyoutube channel and your instagram page\nand all the wonderful stuff you're doing\nand people may think oh yeah rather just\nand yes you've always had this energy\nthat everyone loves you for and that i i\nfell in love with you for\nbut the way you're expressing it now has\ndefinitely evolved right yeah definitely\ni to be honest i feel like i had no idea\nwhat i was doing until\ntill beginning of or like what march\nlast year um when all of this started\nhappening and it was the first time i\nhad to\nliterally sit there and be like oh crap\ni have no excuse of\noh i can't do this because\ni have to go with jay traveling like i\ncan't start my own thing because you\nknow i'm never really in the country and\nit's really difficult i just want to\nfocus on what jay has and i'm just there\nto support him and i realized as much as\nthat was true and i did want to do that\nit was probably a big um\ncovering\nfor me not wanting to actually figure\nout what i wanted to do because\neverything just felt so scary to start\nsomething um and yeah it just kind of\nstripped all of that away where i i was\nlike no i have to fill my days with\nsomething that feels meaningful and and\nfigure out what that is to me and how\nthat looks to me and so i just started\nand yeah i definitely tried so many\ndifferent ways and different things\nwhether it was like i\nmade a did a website during that time\nand you know it's not the best website\nbut it's like the website that i started\noff with and i put so much effort into\nit did like 100 recipes within\nwhat a couple of months because i really\nfocused on it and and it just showed me\nbecause i was such a person that i would\nstart something and as soon as\ni felt a little bit overwhelming or even\nfelt like it was getting good or\nsucceeding in some way i'd be like oh my\ngosh that means i have to take another\nstep forward and i'm not sure i want to\ndo that okay let's just shut it down and\ngo somewhere else and do something else\nand i and i i realized that pattern that\ni had and so i was really determined to\nnot do that with this because it i\nalmost like get in my own way of being a\nfailure but in my mind being a failure\nbecause i choose to not take the next\nstep not because anything else comes in\nmy way but because\nthe fear of the next step would always\nscare me scary enough to not want to\ntake it and so it was really amazing\nactually i was like\njust looking at myself from an like\noutside perspective and i was like oh my\ngosh i never ever thought she could do\nthis like i never thought i could do\nthat i never thought i would actually\nstill be making recipes i thought it was\nlike something i do for a month and then\nget bored and be like\ni can't bother to\nto keep adding onto this website anymore\nbut um yeah and then and then i did my\ndecided to try my youtube thing which oh\nmy gosh took so long to actually start\nbecause of fear again\npushing me away from it but i just i\nmean you've always been so amazing and\nsupportive in that constantly like you\nsee everything happening for me before i\neven dream about it and i think it's\njust been so nice because whenever i've\nhad doubts you've been so amazing at\nhelping me through them practically\nwhere it's either it's in like a\nsupportive way of just love but a lot of\nthe time it's really taking the time to\nhave the conversation with me and i\navoid the conversations and you're like\nokay what do you need to do next like\nwhat is it i'm like i don't want to talk\nabout it right now i haven't figured it\nout and i just don't want to speak about\nit but you constantly would help like\npush me through because you saw that i\nwas coming from a place of fear not\nbecause i actually didn't want to\nand i think that's really important too\nit's like\ni know with a lot of your stuff like 99\nof time you don't necessarily need to\nspeak to me about it but\nthere are certain times that you do want\nto discuss things and vice versa like i\nobviously like this i obviously need um\nyou to input in a lot more of my stuff\nbecause i feel like you've done a lot of\nthe things that i've done and i really\nappreciate your advice for it um\nbut i think there is so much of\nthe support being in so many different\nways throughout the times that i needed\nit and um\nyeah i just i typically don't know how i\ndid how i got here but i'm really happy\nthat i did it i'm so happy because i\nnever expected myself to be able to do\nthat ever and i i just genuinely feel\nfor any everybody else that's listening\nto this that\ni was like that's where my spontaneity\nthat can be a strength and ended up\nbeing something that was such a weakness\nfor me in the areas where i wanted to\ncommit to something and um\nyeah i just i honest and i'm not just\nsaying this genuinely if i can do it ask\nmy mom she will tell you if i can do it\ni 100 know that other people can\nwhatever it is that you love doing just\ntry it out\nand um\nyeah if i can do it oh my gosh you all\ncan definitely do it\nbut enough about me\nwhat i genuinely love about the way\nyou're doing it though is that even\nthough you have become\nmore organized and disciplined and\nfocused to figure this out you haven't\nlost who you are yeah and i think that's\nthe hardest part and i love seeing that\nin you like\neach and every video the amount of\neffort you put in\ni know the amount of effort that goes\nbehind the scenes when you're about to\nlaunch a video\nand like your nerves and your excitement\nand you just want to make everything so\nwonderful for everyone and i love that i\nlove that even though you've become\norganized and focused and disciplined\nand all those things that you've had to\nlearn that you haven't lost yourself in\nit because i think that's possible too\nso i i love watching it and\nit makes me really happy and and what\nyou were just saying at the end\nyou know there's there's an old\nrelationship rule of like don't keep the\nscore\nand it's been said for many many years\nof like don't keep score in a\nrelationship\nbut often score feels like oh i did this\nfavor what did someone else do\nand what i've realized is that score\nshould not be kept energetically and so\nwhat i mean by that is\ni really feel\nthat\nyou\ncarry the relationship sometimes\nemotionally\nand so i may be carrying it mentally but\nyou're carrying it emotionally and so if\nyou're only looking at the mental score\nright i'll be going like oh well i'm\ndoing everything why are you not doing\nanything mentally like you're not\nplanning you're not setting goals you're\nnot doing this but that's because i'm\nonly measuring it on my scorecard\nand i think it's so important to be like\nwell there are so many different\nscorecards there's physical financial\nmental emotional spiritual there are\nfive scorecards first of all it\nshouldn't be a scorecard\nbut i'm saying there's five types of\noffering in a relationship\nand you're only ever looking at the one\nyou give but it's also useful to think\nof it in that way like you're saying\nthere's not scorecards but i think it's\nuseful because i think naturally we all\nhave tendencies to\nwant to be the hero or like want to be\nthe person that like oh but i've done\nthis and i've done that and so actually\nlooking at it in that way\nallows you to see where your strength is\nin your school card but then realize\nhopefully where the other person is also\ncontributing so i think yeah\num but yeah that's so that's really a\ngood way of putting i've never thought\nof it in that way yeah no i've thought\nabout that so many times i think\nwhenever i've been in that position of\nlike oh i'm doing so much for this\nrelationship and\nand i do there are times when i feel\nlike i'm like yeah i'm doing this and\nthen you just stop and you're like\nthat's just stupid because there are so\nmany levels you carry the relationship\non totally and and i encourage everyone\nto do that with their partner is just\nreally look at like where are you\ncarrying the relationship and where are\nthey carrying the relationship and i\npromise you that someone in your\nrelationship is carrying something\nand if they're not carrying anything\nthen sure that's that's not a great\nrelationship but i think there are so\nmany relationships where we miss what\nsomeone's doing i think that really\nstops you from um and actually having i\ndidn't think of it in that way but\nwhenever i do think about when i'm\nirritated at something or when i feel\nthat way\nthinking about it in your way and\nsometimes i have thought about it in\nthat way it makes you really not be\nselfish like it makes you a lot of the\ntimes if you feel that way you can end\nup stopping yourself from continuing\ncontinuing to do that or continuing to\nbe the person carrying this section but\ni think when you think of it as these\nother four areas that could that other\nperson may be helping in or carrying it\nstops you from\nlimiting yourself and what you can give\nand and realizing that actually i could\nbe giving everything in this category\nand that's okay because he's giving\neverything in this category and i don't\nwant that category so i'm good for him\nto handle that um\nand so yeah i think like one that just\nreminds me of all the\nthe stuff i always get like even when i\nput up cooking stuff or i'll get dm just\nbeing like you know does jay ever cook\nfor you and does jay do this for you and\ni'm like no and it doesn't irritate me\nat all because i don't like doing\nfinance stuff like it may be such a\ncliche of like how you know i like being\nin the kitchen but it's out of choice\nlike i love being in this it's not\nbecause you're a woman it's not because\ni'm a woman that's what i mean\nyeah yeah yeah and like sometimes when\nyou\nthere's been times remember when like\nsome days i'll be like um someone will\nyou'll be like oh someone's come to a\nhouse and you're like yeah this is her\nwork area and some people don't even\nknow what i'm doing and i'm like\nare we both laughing yeah i always i\nalways show people my office which is\nwhere we are now yeah and then when we\nget a kitchen i will say and this is\nriley's office and i don't mean it in a\ncondescending or sexist way at all it's\nactually her office yeah like that's\nwhere you experiment and that's where\nyou create recipes and yeah but but yeah\ni just think it's it's really it's\nreally important that because i do still\nalways get people but like does it it\ndoesn't annoy you that he doesn't cook\ndoesn't it he doesn't even want to try\nor make you your meal and i'm like no\nbecause i really don't want to\nlearn about this that he does and he\nmanages and i think it's so important\nbecause you can get so wrapped up in\nwhat other people do for each other in\nrelationships\nand what other people are carrying for\neach other in relationships and you see\nthis one aspect of and you're like oh\nwell why doesn't he carry that for me\nand why doesn't she carry that for me or\ndo that for me and and i think it's so\nimportant because it can really\nyes stop you from giving as much as you\nshould be or want to be giving in a\nrelationship because you're putting up\nyour own barriers and telling yourself\nthat you shouldn't because he's not\ngiving enough exactly all right couple\nmore questions go on then uh this is a\ngood one when are you most scared to be\nvulnerable with your partner\nwhen are you most scared to be\nvulnerable\nlike when are you scared of like being\nreally honest and open i'm thinking\n[Laughter]\nsometimes when um\nyou know like if i'm supposed it's like\nyou've already given me advice on\nsomething and then like i'm kind of\nasking for like again and i'm like\nreally confused about something again\nand you're really nice about it but\nsometimes i feel like it's\nyou know when i know you're going to\ntell me something that i don't\nnecessarily want to hear because you've\nalready told me before and i don't\nnecessarily want you to give me the\nanswer because i know you're right that\nmakes me really annoyed\nso sometimes i don't feel like being\nvulnerable about how i'm feeling because\ni know the answer you're gonna give and\nthat i don't want to hear it\n[Laughter]\ni so what do i need to be to help you be\nmore vulnerable\nno i think it's more me\nno seriously\nno no i think it is this is very much so\njust me\ni think it's me just wanting to be\nstubborn and not wanting you to be right\nthat's like a recurring theme in this\npodcast right now\ni'm not stopping\ni'm not allowed to say it that's the\nthing that's the rule of life\ni'm not allowed to repeat something she\nsaid you know that makes me look good\ni'm like yeah i should really tidy up\nafter myself forever he's like yeah yeah\nwe should have you know tell me you\ndon't like tell me that i should tidy up\nbut i'll tell myself if i'm gonna tidy\nup after myself okay\ni i feel most i'm trying to think i i\nthink the time i feel most vulnerable is\nlike when i spent a lot of money on\nsomething\ni feel like that's it but i'm trying to\nthink of it like\noh yeah like when you tell me not to\noh yeah make sure you just park properly\nand don't ruin the rims i'm like if i\nwant to wear the rims i'll ruin the\nrooms okay\nno that no but i don't feel one i say\nthat to you i'm trying to think of some\nwhen am i scared of being vulnerable\nwith you\nwhen am i scared of being vulnerable\nwith you wait i don't send them anything\nno like if i've just bought like a\nreally expensive suit oh you don't want\nto tell them yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah\nif i've just bought an expensive suit\nfor like an award ceremony because he\nknows he's got a goody wife\nyeah so i get scared of being like yeah\nthis time as a suitcase because i'm\nwearing it and what do i always say i'm\nlike that's okay it's for your work yeah\nevery time yeah yeah you know you're\nalways nice in my mind i always i'm like\nit's for your work it's fine\nno you're nice about it i think i think\nit's a silly thing just because of\nupbringing raising yourself it's not you\nit's not you at all you you never stop\nme um and then i'm trying to think what\ni'm trying to think\nlike sometimes with health stuff yeah\nyou know why because sometimes like\nbecause i'm cooking for him i take\nthings quite personally and so sometimes\nif you try so hard no i know i know\nthat's not but i feel like sometimes\nfrom you i feel you get a little bit\nworried about saying if something has\nupset your stomach or if something\nhasn't made you feel right um whenever\nyou have been in your ups and downs with\nyour health um or whenever giving you\nsomething and i've suggested something\nand it hasn't worked and i'm like but\nwhy isn't it work like i just don't\nunderstand and i think it makes you\nvulnerable and i get quite defensive no\nno no i don't think so but you're trying\nto like i i don't think you get\ndefensive i think you try really hard\nand so it's hard for you because you're\ntrying to figure out so many ways to\nsupport me or help me yeah yeah and you\ndon't want to you don't want it to go\nwrong and this is what it always comes\nback down to it's like when you trust\nthe person loves you you know that\nsomeone even being defensive is out of\nlove yeah i am defensive though about it\nto be honest no but i i don't i think\nthat comes from the fact that you're\ntrying so hard yeah yeah maybe because\ni'm just like oh what and it's hard when\nyou're not in control of something and\nyou're trying to be in control of it um\nbut yeah i feel like that's what i know\nis you're you are a little bit scared to\nbe vulnerable because\nyou want to tell me but you also don't\nwant to upset me or or like that's a\ngood answer yeah yeah that's a good\nanswer i don't yeah i never want you to\nfeel like you're trying really hard and\nit's not working on something because i\ndon't think that's\nfair because it's not necessarily your\nresponsibility or like when you want to\nplay playstation and you pretend like\nit's like a work meeting with your\npartner and never say that away and\nreally you just want to play playstation\ntogether but you're like it's for work\nand i'm like\nyeah it's just because you want to play\nokay another one you're giving way too\nmany well as well\nokay so we're on to the final two\nsegments which is fill in the blank and\nfinal five fill in the blank and finally\nyeah so fill in the blank is you fill in\nthe blank at the end of the sentence\nwe're both gonna say it all right yeah\nokay are you ready i'm ready\ni feel most supported by my partner when\ni feel like we did this last time\nyeah but not the same question\ni feel most supported by my partner when\nhe brings me snacks when i don't even\nask for them that never happens no\nthat's why i just don't feel it right\nnow\nno i feel most that's my answer you go\ni feel most supported by my partner when\ni bring you cut up fruit\nno i mean that's a fun one yeah but\nhe likes his fruit cut up\nwhen he's eating it like a little baby\nbecause his mum used to do it for him\nwhen he was younger and when he goes\nback every single time his mom cuts his\nfruit up into a little bowl and um he\nhas a little assortment of fruit bowl\nevery day and he's like you know i\nreally love it when my fruits cut up so\num\nthat's what i've been doing cutting up\nfruit midday halfway through my work day\ni haven't had it today tomorrow sitting\nthere cutting up fruit\nfor this king over here\ncut up fruit makes him make some support\nfeels the boy\nmy honest answer was going to be when my\npartner's present with me like when i\nfeel like you're really fully present\nokay\ncommitment means\ncommitment means\ncommitment means\ncommitment means\ncommitment means\nlike showing up in different ways for\none another when the time is right\nknowing knowing when is your time to\nshow up and knowing when it's their time\nshow up\nyeah i think commitment means\nmutual\nlove\nboundaries agreements connection like\nwhen it's mutually\ncreated\nthat you create a plan together you\ncreate boundaries together you create\nexpectations together that's what\ncommitment means and then you honor\nthose totally\nconflict can bring\nconflict can bring\nwell let's just say i box so\nconflict can bring\ngod\ni'm joking i don't do that to him um\nconflict can bring\ndeeper love i was going to say something\nlike that no you weren't i was no you\nweren't you chose boxing\ncomplicated\nsaying conflict can bring um\nreally good like makeup meals\nwhenever we wake up we're going oh let's\ngo get some like coca-beta creamery ice\ncream is that really what happened\nthat's why we haven't had it for so long\nbecause we haven't had to make up we\nhaven't really had many fights lately\nlet's pick one now\nso there we go\nso then we can have coca bella\nfinal five so these are one word or one\nsentence yeah stop giving such long\nanswers\n[Laughter]\nwhat's one thing you recently discovered\nabout yourself that surprised you that i\ncan commit to things and just maintain\nit\ni always knew this but i guess i forgot\nit i love exercising with sport i just\nneed to play more sport i need to stop\nforcing myself so that lovely okay\nwhat about our relationship makes you\nfeel powerful\nthey're both on the same page like a lot\nof the time\ni'm like oh i like this and you're like\noh me too i'm like oh okay like even if\nsmall or big things like we are very\nmuch so\non the same page and even if we're not\nwe're both kind of okay with\ncoming to an agreement that we both like\nthat's mine\ncool my answer is you you you always\ntrust me when the chips are down what\nwas the question again like what may\nwhat in our relationship makes you feel\npowerful yeah i got you so for me i i\nwhat makes me feel powerful is when\nwe're all in you trust me even when\nthings are not working out yeah\nexternally i that makes me feel really\nconfident and stuff\ni'm glad okay just don't use my chips\nchoose your own\nwhat do you think our relationship will\nbe like by our 50th anniversary oh lord\ni didn't choose this\nwhat do i think i think the better\nquestion is how will we celebrate our\n50th wedding anyways\num my mind's always that with my family\nwith our family\nwe'd have a really nice 50th celebration\nwith the whole family all together\non holiday somewhere sounds great just\nlaying here that's my answer sounds\ngreat his would be like just us two on a\nbeach with a tennis court\n[Laughter]\nand cut throat\ni haven't had it today next all right\ntwo last questions\nwhat about your partner have you grown\nto love that you initially disliked\ni can't think of anything good you go\nfast no i can't think of many things i\njust like i'm trying to think of what\nwhat i now like about you i think it was\nyour like i think\ni've just realized that\ni think it was what i said earlier like\nyour lack of organization or whatever\nlike i initially that really irked me\nand then now i'm just like but that's\nwhat lets you be spontaneous like that's\nwhat lets\nyour ever freshness come out and if you\nbecame all of that thing then you can't\nyou know not saying that you can't be\norganized like you are organized now and\nyou have become but i mean\nif you became a\nan organizational rigid beast and you\nlose that yeah you lose part of that um\ni think mine for you is probably\njust like your general way of thinking\nwas not something that i was used to\nthat's true that's a good one that's a\nreally good one whether it was the\nquality versus quantity amount of time\nbecause i was not used to that whether\nit was um yeah your just general way of\nthinking where i used to be like oh well\nmaybe i don't do that but then i\nrealized actually is a really good way\nof thinking and um even though it used\nto like scare me to things like that\nbecause i felt like i was getting rid of\na lot of my old like habits and ways of\nthinking now i've actually become quite\nfond of it okay next i love that okay\nfifth and final question of the whole\ninterview\nwhat's the funniest thing that's\nhappened to both of you the funniest\nthing that's ever happened to both of us\num\ni was going to say i was going to say\nthat go on well we were a few weeks or\nmonths ago\nsomeone put us up on this\ninstagram page\ncalled sibling revelry\nand what this page does is that it puts\nup pictures of siblings or couples\nand asks people to vote whether they're\nsiblings or or couples and so they\nposted a picture of us and i think 60\nsaid\nsiblings and 40 said couple probably 40\nwho know who we are\nand it's really funny because all the\nawkward pictures on that page are\nsiblings\nso it's yeah that's probably one of the\nfunniest things that is really funny\nthat was a good good laugh that was good\nlaugh um\ni can think of another one too go on i\nremember when we were traveling to\nsomeone's birthday or something when we\nfirst started dating and we got lost in\nthe middle that's what i was going to\nsay no way that's literally when i went\nback to go on no i was thinking of when\nwe were um oh yeah that's what it was\nwe were going somewhere it was a\ncountryside and then somehow we remember\nwe drove into like a barn or like field\narea and i was so scared and that was\nthe first time that i was in a very\nscary situation with you and it was the\nthe time i realized like how you will\nalways be and always have been sins\nthat like calm my dad has always been\nthis person for me so it was so cool\nbecause you literally took on that role\nof like you are so calm you're so clean\neven even when you're scared\nwhen i was young even if my dad was so\nscared he would never ever show he was\nscared and he'd always have me like i\nwould never feel scared because he was\nnever scared and you literally had i got\na glimpse of that with you and i was\nlike oh my gosh i was so scared i was so\nscared you did so good that day\nthat was funny and funny now not funny\nthen yeah\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love instead of\ncriticizing the other person tell them\nwhat you want and tell them what you\ndon't without implying that they're not\ndoing it because then they pay attention\nonly to the fact that you told them\nyou're not doing it and then they will\nbasically do what every human being does\nwhich is defend themselves"
