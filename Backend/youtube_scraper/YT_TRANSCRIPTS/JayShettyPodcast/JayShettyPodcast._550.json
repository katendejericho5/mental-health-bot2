    "transcript": "you don't experience life you experience\nthe part of life you focus on right\nwhat's wrong is always available so\nthat's what's right right\nand there are different kinds of focus\nand my dad's focus that day was really\non what he hadn't done and i know that\nbecause he kept muttering it and i\nhadn't taken care of his family there's\nno money for thanksgiving somebody had\nto give us charity\nand then the second decision you make\nabout once you focus on something is\nwhat does it mean\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now today's guest\nis someone that i've wanted to sit down\nwith ever since i was a very young boy\nand it's extremely special to me to have\nthis opportunity i grew up in a home\nwhere i was surrounded by his books his\ncassettes his cds my father would be\ndiving into them playing them in the car\nwherever he possibly could and i was\nsurrounded by this man's wisdom\nand it had an impact on me both\ninternally externally and in so many\nways and today i've had the great\nfortune of sitting with him\nfor this podcast and this interview i'm\nspeaking about a man who needs no\nintroduction that is recently the number\none new york times bestselling author of\nthis book life force the one and only\ntony robbins tony i am so honored\nhumbled and grateful to be in your\npresence thank you\nbrother coming to visit to be in your\nhome you've opened up your home today\nthis is the first time we brought on\npurpose out into the wild\nfor a guest to be with you but we're in\nyour beautiful home that you've\ngraciously and sage was just an amazing\nhost and\nwelcomed me so beautifully and i want\neveryone to know also about i came here\nexpecting that we were going to do a\npodcast tony of course is one of the\nbusiest humans on the planet we just sat\ndown and we spent nearly an hour\ntogether just connecting and talking\nbecause of his kindness and generosity i\nwant people to know the work you're\ndoing i wanted to hear more about it so\nit's gorgeous what you're doing here so\nthanks for having me on oh well thank\nyou thank you so much so\nthis\nconversation is a long time coming from\nthe work that you've been doing the\njourney of this book doesn't start when\nyou started writing this book the\njourney of this book for you became\nsomething that you got focused on a long\nlong time ago yeah true and i wanted to\nfocus on one point to give people this\ncontext you know you're seen as someone\nwho's superhuman you're able to do\nincredible things on stage off stage you\nhave a phenomenal physical mental\npsychological presence have a beautiful\nspiritual presence\nbut at the same time\nyou talk about in this book being 31\nyears old\nand finding out about this brain tumor\nyes i want to hear about what that feels\nlike when you think you're doing\neverything right for your health yeah\nand it hasn't been a point of concern\nand all of a sudden you get this news\nhow does that feel\nwell it was scary obviously i actually\nit started a little sooner than that\nwhen i was really young i\ngrew up really rapidly i've worked\n20-hour days and i was also blessed and\ni got to work with some very important\npeople and i got great results and they\ntold other people so the time i was 19\njust almost 20 i had become quite\nsuccessful in external terms at least in\nthe world and\nsome part of me was you know the kind of\nthe mechanism in the back of our head\nthat two million year old brain right\nthe fight-or-flight mechanism i didn't\nknow how to manage that so well and part\nof my brain was like well maybe you have\nall this happening so quick because\nyou're going to die young and i\nliterally became obsessed with not just\ngetting hit by a truck or something it\nwas cancer i was going to wilt away i\ndon't know where it came from and i knew\nbetter intellectually but it was there\nand then um the first time i entered my\nlife was before 31 entered my life\nthrough someone else my girlfriend\nand she came home crying uncontrollably\nand jay i mean she was like like what is\nit what is it my mom my mom and my mom\nhas cancer and then even worse they gave\nher nine weeks to live they just sent\nher home\nand i think it would have been me\ni think my fear would have overcome me\nbut you know most people will do more\nfor people they love whether it be their\nkids or their family or someone else\nthen they'll ever do for themselves and\nso it's like i kicked into gear that's\nwhat i do it's like okay if there's a\nproblem there's a solution i said look\nthere's thousands of people that had\nstage four cancer and that are alive\ntoday we're gonna find out what they do\nwe're gonna do the same thing she's not\ngoing to die and then i just read every\nbook i could on cancer and i came across\nthis one book called\none answer to cancer it's not the book i\nrecommend today because there's so many\nbetter ones today but it was written by\nthis dentist who had pancreatic cancer\nwhich is the most vicious cancer of all\nhe was given six weeks to live and this\nis 12 years later and he's alive and so\nhe laid out what he did to cleanse his\nbody and it sounded radical in those\ndays pancreatic enzymes so i went to\nthis woman her name was jenny she was in\nher 40s and i said jenny you know i know\nyou don't want to die i said but just\ngoing home and do nothing why don't you\nread this book this guy was in worse\nshape than you\nand see if you wanted to apply this and\nshe read it and she got inspired and i\ngave her as a man thinking to kind of\nwork on her head a little bit\nanyway long story short within about\nthree weeks\nyou could she had a tumor that was\nprotruding in her shoulder and the one\nin her feminine organs and you couldn't\nsee anything three weeks later on her\nshoulder and at the period of i think\nabout nine weeks when she was supposed\nto die and she looked good she had great\nenergy and\nlike literally looked transformed the\ndoctor finally said this is crazy let's\ndo exploratory surgery so they went in\nin her body all they could find left of\nthe cancer was something the size of my\npinky's fingernail\nand so the doctor said this is a miracle\nand she said it is a miracle but let me\ntell you what i did he was like no no\nthis is spontaneous remission i don't\nwant to hear what you did what you did\ndoesn't matter but she's in her mid-80s\ntoday she's still alive and that shifted\nme from\nvictimhood like oh my god cancer could\nstrike me down to believe me i'll be\ngreat so all the more shocking now i'm a\ntotal biohacker i'm a health nut i've\ngot to get on stage and do you know 12\n13 hours with 20 000 people and i got to\ndo three or four days in a row and i\nmake these huge demands but i also have\nthis incredibly intense regimen of\ntaking care of myself and then i went\ni'm a helicopter pilot\nso i went to go get my license renewed\nyou have to do a physical and i come\nback and i keep getting these messages\nfrom the doctor saying my assistant's\nsaying doctor says got to talk to you\nand i was like i'm leaving for the south\nof france to an event tell them to just\nsend the report\nand i got homeless one night and taped\nto my bat my master bathroom bedroom\ndoor was a note from my assistant saying\nyou've got to call the doctor he says\nit's an emergency so what do you do what\ndo you feel like well all my old fears\njust started flashing backs like oh my\ngod i mean i treat my body so great how\ncould i have cancer but i do fly all the\ntime that's radiation you know your head\ngoes crazy at least mine did yeah um but\nself-diagnosis but at that time that i\nhad also found a center in my life and\nso i found my center as like okay\ncourageous person you know you know\ncoward dies a thousand deaths courageous\nperson once\nlet me deal with it if it needs to be\ndealt with in the morning i woke up\ncalled\nand the doc says to me you have a tumor\na tumor in your brain it's like what are\nyou talking about i came to you i'm\ntotally healthy i'm healthy as a horse\nand he said no no he said you have an\nenormous amount of growth hormones so i\ndid some tests i said you know how did\nyou notice the growth hormone my hands\nare bigger than your head i wear a size\n16 shoe i was five one now i'm six seven\nagain i grew ten inches in a year and he\ngoes no don't be funny he goes you need\nto hear me this is serious and he said\nyou really need to do this and we'll do\nwhat you got to come in for surgery\ni was like wait a second i said you're\ntelling me you're going to cut me open\ni said what's the prognosis he said well\nobviously you can die you can do anytime\nyou do surgery that's this complex but\nhe said it's your pituitary gland and he\nsaid he said the you know you're\nprobably not going to have the same kind\nof energy anymore because it'll change\nyour biochemistry\ni was like well i think i should get a\nsecond opinion who would you recommend\nand he he did not have a good bedside\nmatter and i didn't have a good side\nbedside matter either i was a young punk\nkid i was like well how do you tell me\ni'm going to have to have the surgery so\ni kind of blew it off since he was such\na jerk about it like i'll take care of\nwhen i get home i flew the south of\nfrance and i did this seminar\nbut then you know the mind you know the\nmind starts going like what if he's\nright what is this so i went and did the\nscan and i saw the look on the guy's\nface when i came out from the mri\nand sure enough i had a tumor there it\nwas interesting though jay it was a big\ntumor that's why i drew 10 inches in a\nyear\nand but it infarct which means it\nswallowed a portion of itself up but\nstill there\nand he said we still need to the surgery\nso i went and did i said okay he's a\nsurgeon let me go to somebody who's more\nbiochemically driven so i went to this\nman in boston uh a neurobiologist and\nhe was really completely different he\nwas super warm and he said look he goes\ni would never do the surgery it's way\ntoo risky there's a place in switzerland\nyou can go to and you can take an\ninjection once every six months\nand you'll never have to worry about it\nbecause what they worry about is have\ngigantism it's called it makes your\narteries get really big and then you\nhave a heart attack i said well doc you\njust said my arteries are perfect\nand this happened 12 years ago\ni said why would i do anything\nhe goes well we just want to be certain\ni said well what if what if i'm not\ncertain the drugs are not going to have\nside effects you know\nhe goes well it will really make you\ntired all the time i was like tired all\nthe time that's the opposite of my whole\nlife i said i'm that energy is the\nsource of everything for me and he's\nlike oh you're afraid you're like samson\nyou're figuring to cut your hair and i\nsaid you're damn right i am you know but\nhe was so cool and i said but you know\nthe surgeon wants to cut me goes yeah\nthe baker wants to bake yetis the\nbutcher wants to butcher the surgeon\nwants to cut and i want to drug you he's\nreally cool and i said what if i did\nnothing\nhe goes but i measured it like i'm not\nstupid i go measure it once a year or\nsomething goes well\nyou could do that and thank god i did\njay because six months later the fda i\nwas having to go to switzerland because\nwasn't available in the u.s and the fda\nnever allotted in because they found it\ncreated cancer so i missed a bullet\ni went to five other docks so six and\ntwelve seven in total and the last doc\ntold me what i wanted to hear\nwhich was tony you have a huge amount of\ngrowth hormone but he goes you literally\ndo you know i burn 11 300 calories in\none day on stage give you an idea i\nguess you've followed me for three years\nto follow olympic athletes and tom brady\nand people like that\nand so they've measured everything in my\nbody and he goes you're doing two and a\nhalf marathons basically and calorie\nburn in a day and you're doing four days\nin a row like that he goes your ability\nto recover is insane because in two or\nthree days you've recovered he goes\nthat's that's coming from that growth\nhormone i believe and he said so i know\nbodybuilders that are spending 1200\nbucks you know a month to have what\nyou're getting for free so that was when\ni was 31 i'm 62. i've never had a\nproblem since i've measured it but it\nreally changed my outlook and the first\none made my outlook look like there is\nan answer and the second one my outlook\nwas there's a price for certainty\nand you got to be very careful what\nprice you pay to be certain you got to\nfind that certainty within yourself\nwhich i know is a lot of what you teach\nand i do as well jay yeah thank you for\nwalking us through that and especially\ngoing back a bit further as well\ni think what i find fascinating about\nthat tony and\na lot of the work you do\nis why does it why do we as humans often\nwait\nto see not even see pain you saw pain in\nsomeone else and you tried to help solve\nit and that got you working yeah but why\nis it that we often wait to experience\npain\nbefore we decide to change a part of our\nlives make a different choice to create\na shift why is it that we wait so often\nfor stress impressions i have that\nquestion was burning at me because you\nknow i was traveling around had the\nprivilege of this stage of life you know\ntraveling around the earth\nfrom every walk of life right 100 plus\ncountries i've worked in and i'd see the\nsame problems even though you mean\ndifferent cultures like you know going\nto an asian culture it's not about the\nindividual it's about the group right\nbut i'd still see the same problems and\nthen i got obsessed with it like okay\nwhat what's the common human experience\nbecause i'm seeing the same problems\neven though it's a different culture\neven those different beliefs right and i\nbegan to realize that there are certain\nhuman needs and there are six that\nidentify that i've used ever since and\nit's helped me understand and so one of\nthose needs is certainty and it's the\nbase human need certainty that you can\navoid pain and that you can be\ncomfortable is the most basic need it's\na survival need because if you have\ncontinuous pain that's continuous damage\ncontinuous damage equals death right\nbut what happens for people is most\npeople\nthat first basic need is where they live\nthey don't grow\nanother need the second need is\nuncertainty because ironically if you're\ncertain all the time you're bored out of\nyour mind if you're completely uncertain\nyou're kind of freaked out and a balance\nis not it it's the ability to use both\nenter both worlds and then there's the\nneed for significance which is a big\npart of our culture today thanks to\nsocial media\nthat need to feel special unique\nimportant right it can be a very\npositive emotion or need it can be very\nnegative depending on how it's used how\nit's directed and then there's the need\nfor connection and love which everybody\nhas and those four needs everybody finds\na way to meetings you have to lie to\nyourself work 20 hour days you're going\nto find certainty somehow you're going\nto find where i variety you're going to\nfind some form of significance some\npeople do it by tearing other people\ndown some people do it by working harder\nyou know it's different you're going to\nfind some level of at least connection\nif not love but the final two what make\npeople feel alive which is growing\neverything in the universe grows or dies\nand contributing everything is in the\nuniverse contributes or it's eventually\neliminated by evolution so those are the\nspiritual needs growth and contribution\nwhere you get beyond yourself\nand i think that the majority of us\ndon't take moves because of fear and\nfear is just uncertainty it's that base\nneed and when i go around and i describe\nthis in more detail and i work with a\nbig audience fifteen twenty thousand\npeople and i'll say have to do a set of\nexercises and figure out\nwhere do they get what triggers them to\nbe certain or uncertain what triggers\nthem a variety and so forth so they\nunderstand that like everything i do is\nto meet these needs\nbut then i'm going to say what are your\ntop two not what you think they should\nbe not what you want them to be what are\nthey and 90 of the people in our culture\nour certainty and significance or\nsignificance and certainty even though\nthey really want love\nso they have this route like if i can be\nsuccessful enough then i'll be worthy of\nit or if i can just control it enough\nand know it's that way but you can't\ncontrol love right and so most people\nare\nthey're trying to meet their needs in a\nkind of a backwards way\nand i think that that fear that\nuncertainty is what keeps most people\ngoing until they get enough pain and\nthen that pushes them through a\nthreshold where their needs aren't being\nmet they got to change and unfortunately\nmost people wait till they have enough\npain i that's not my preference\ni'm sure it's not yours but i'm sure\nyou've had experiences as much as i've\nhad where you did have to be pushed that\nfar to get there right yeah by the way\ni'm so glad i asked you that question\nbecause that's the best answer i've ever\nheard today it's brilliant\nit's it's it's simple but it's it's\nprofound as well because\nusually we would say oh yeah the reason\nwhy we wait till we don't have to change\nis because we're comfortable and we're\nokay with it but really it's because\nyou're saying these needs keep us\ntrapped almost in fact if you're if\nyou're wanting to change but not\nchanging it's because some of your needs\nare met by what you're doing and some of\nthem aren't that's why you're in that\npush pull but you don't usually do\nenough until you're pushed over the edge\nlike smoking a cigarette what does it\ngive people comfort because you take a\nbreath of cigarette you take it nice\nslow deep breath in and take it out it\ncalms the nervous system right it's\nsomething that they're comfortable with\nit's variety if they're all stressed out\nand then they start to breathe\ndifferently it's variety in the body for\nsome people they did originally for\nsignificance i'm cool i'm smoking or\ntoday it's not really that cool to most\npeople but for some generations some\nplaces it is some people see it as a\nconnection with themselves but if all of\na sudden you're now in a relationship\nwith somebody who doesn't smoke\nand you really love them and you want\ntheir total love and attention and\nthey're completely disgusted by\ncigarettes\nnow my needs for love\nright are really strong and my need for\nthis comfort is really strong and so you\nhave this push-pull and then some people\nmake the shift some people don't yeah\nabsolutely well\nwhat you said to me really wrong a bell\nfor me and we spoke a bit about it\nearlier like i came to a point in my\nlife\nthere was one point earlier when i when\ni left the monastery where i really\nstruggled with my health which i've\nspoken about before but even more\nrecently and it's interesting you were\n31 i'm 34 now and wow and it was\nprobably around a similar time 30 maybe\naround 30 years old where i realized\nthat i had two choices i either had to\nslow down or i had to up my focus on my\nhealth right and that's why i'm so\nexcited about this book for the world to\nread yeah because you're giving us\nopportunities and access to thought and\nideas and practices and medicine that\ncan help us up our game of our health\noften what we do is we choose to slow\ndown we choose to just go okay well i'm\njust going to do less yeah and\nyou and i i think we both connect on the\nfact that actually giving and service\nand contribution and\nmaking an impact into such big needs\nthat i was just like i don't want to\nstop though like just as you said with\nthe energy point i don't want to not be\nable to do as much and give more yeah so\nhow do i change my health and that\nsimple decision it's what led me to be\nattracted to what you're doing in this\nbook and the work in this area talk to\nabyss talk to us a bit about that energy\npiece in the book you talk a lot about\nboosting your energy through natural\ncompounds yes and when i was reading\nabout this i was fascinated because\nwe're not hearing about this everywhere\nif somebody were to tell you five years\nago that you could reverse aging the\npeople would laugh at you but today\nthere are billions and billions of\ndollars being spent by the richest\npeople in the world mostly in silicon\nvalley and some of the greatest\nscientists in the world have been\nbreakthroughs in the last five years\nthat are amazing so there's a man named\ndr sinclair david sinclair from harvard\nhe's probably the number one longevity\nexpert in the world and i write about\nhim in the book and one thing says he's\n53 chronologically but he's 33\nbiochemically i've applied what he's\ntaught me for\nsix months now since i met him seven\nmonths maybe eight months now and i'm 62\nbut i'm 51. my goal is to get it down to\n41 and 42 if i possibly can but because\nhow's that possible well there are ways\nof reversing you know your everybody\nknows their body's made of stem cells\ni'm sure by now and there's ways of\nreversing the process of a stem cell\nliterally from skin back to a\npluripotent where it can become anything\nthe man who did that was dr yamanaka won\nthe nobel prize for it david sinclair\ntook his work applied it to reversing\nthe aging and he started with mice and\nhe took these mice that had um glaucoma\nso they burned out the nerves in the\neyes and those don't regrow\nand he's the first time he'll probably\nwon a nobel prize for this he reversed\nthe aging process and grew back their\neyes so they have sight again to give\nyou an idea\nthey're using gene therapy there's a\nyoung man that i interviewed in the book\nthere who was on america's got talent\nwho was blind to now can see by this\ngene therapies these are types of things\nthat just sound like magic the book is\nfilled with things where i interviewed\n150 of the smartest scientists nobel\nlaureates regenerative doctors and\nscientists to show you what's happening\nright now that you might think what\nhappened 20 or 30 years from now sounds\nlike magic or within 36 months that's\nwhat it's all really based on but here's\nwhat i want your audience to understand\nand run energy\nso everybody's heard of the genome or\ntheir dna right\nyou can think of the genome as being\nlike the piano keys\nbut the music is played by a player\nwhich is the epigenome epi means above\nand the epigenome is affected by your\ndiet your exercise how much exposure to\nradiation etc well most people have\nheard that\nbut the epigenome really is governed by\nseven master genes they're called\nsirtuins now your audience just have to\nremember all these names\nbut just stay with me just think there's\nseven master genes that do three or four\nthings that are critical first they\nconvert they turn on and off the\ndifferent genes in your body that's the\nepigenome and if you turn on the wrong\nones you age too soon or your energy\ndrops so when this is fully fueled when\nthose sirtuins are doing their job\neverything happens in the right way\nsecond thing they do is they reduce your\ninflammation which is the basis of most\nbreakdown the body third thing they do\nit's just critical is they help your\nmitochondria just the energy force\ninside every cell in your body convert\nfood into energy into atp it's pretty\nimportant and then they have a separate\ntask that is they clean up your dna so\nat 35 or 34 you have a certain amount of\nexposure more than when you were 20.\nwhen you're 50 it'll be even higher 60\neven higher well around 40 your stem\ncells drop off the cliff\naround 50\nthe sirtuins the fuel of the sertuans\ndrops off the cliff and that's called\nnad which i'm sure some of your people\nhave heard about you may have spoken\nabout you can do nad as an iv it doesn't\nabsorb a lot though\nnad though has a precursor called nmn\nlike never mother never i'm sure you've\nheard of it\nand so i've known about that\nand so but i didn't understand that if\nyou don't have enough nad and and then\nthen the body has to decide between\ndo i help the body turn onto epigenome\ndo i help it reduce inflammation because\nthere's only so much do i really help it\ncreate enough energy in the cell or do i\nclean up the dna\nso imagine you have a mansion\nand you have a young staff and your\nhouse looks perfect all the time because\nthey're young and bright and they're on\ntop things break down no one notices\nthey clean it up but as they get older\nand slower\nand then there's less resources any d\nnow the mansion starts to break down\nthat's aging so what dr sinclair did is\nfigure out how to supplement that nmn\nand you can go buy and then on the you\nknow like if you look on amazon even and\nthere's probably a list of a dozen or so\nbrands that do it so we tested six of\nthem\njust for price points is the 39 dollars\na month 129 a month\nand there was no nmn in any of them\nand i asked the lab guys said are these\npeople just thieves he goes well most of\nit comes from china so i can't say for\nsure he said but what i can tell you is\nwhat's more likely is nmn breaks down in\nless than 30 days so the time it comes\nfrom china gets to your door there's\nnothing in it so they built a more\nstable nmn which we haven't used but\nthere's something coming on what your\naudience know about little shut up i've\ntalked about some long time\nyeah there's a company called\nmicrobiotech\nuh and eden rock this merger of these\ntwo companies they saw the power of nmn\nand they said if you could find an m m\nthat was stable\nand was even more absorbable it would\ntransform people so for example in a\nmouse\nthey give nmn to mice and they live 30\nlonger so not all my studies transfer to\nhumans they take a an old mouse like a\n70 year old person be like a 20 month\nold mouse okay so it's an old mouse and\nthey put them on a treadmill and the\nmost they can run without collapsing is\nabout a quarter of a kilometer\na young dynamic mouse like a 21 year old\ncan run four times that a full kilometer\nwow 14 days on nmn and the old mouse the\n70 year old mouse will run two to three\nkilometers 200 to 300 percent more so\nagain i read about this i was like well\nwill that really transfer to humans yeah\nso this has been the break that only\nhappened a few months ago right before i\npublished the book the special forces in\nboston for two years has been doing a\nprivate study that's been top secret\nabout using this new form of nmnm it's\ncalled mib-626\nand it'll be available in 18 to 24\nmonths\nbut it got it got out because the\ncommander they just finished the\ntwo-year study first year was safety\nsecond year was efficacy and the\ncommander was debriefing his team and\ndidn't realize there was a newspaper\nperson in the room so part of it got out\nit was in the daily mail a couple weeks\nago also and they only know a part of it\ni can't tell you the thing is i'm an\ninvestor in the company i can't tell you\nwhat's not public but i'll tell you\nwhat's public what the commander said\nwas here's what i can tell you gentlemen\nwhat happens with mice happens with the\nmost powerful men and women in the world\ni mean the most conditioned men in the\nworld saw massive increase in endurance\njust from taking this mnn massive\nincrease in muscle strength without any\nmore stimulation and most importantly\nincreased cognitive ability which when\nyou're a soldier what's going to get you\nto stay alive when you're exhausted or\nbeat up or injured or complete the\nmission is going to be your brain so\nthey're now doing studies on covid with\nit they're doing studies with groups of\n40 to 60 year olds that are just\nunconditioned and they're seeing the\nsame result so in 18 to 24 months the\nfda will have this will not be a\nnutraceutical this would be a something\ngo to your doctor and imagine you get\nsomething that is natural\nbut you put in your body and now all\nfour of those things i've told you about\nare going full tilt now your turn on and\noff the right genes now inflammation is\ncoming down you've got more energy at a\ncellular level and your dna is being\ncleaned up so that's less than two years\naway from us right now that's incredible\nso you first approach it through\nbehavior change now you're changing the\nactual product that we've broken yeah\nthat's amazing yes and and do you think\nthough that\nand putting together both those\napproaches that you've\ninvested in from a point of view of your\nwhole career and what you're working on\nnow\nhow much is that change of behavior\nstill going to be required because my\nworry is as you know is people say okay\ni'm going to take this pill and it's\ngoing to drop my inflammation but then\ni'm going to eat things that create more\ninflammation like how does behavior\nchange go hand in hand with that i found\nthat when people have more energy i\ndon't know what your experience is that\ntheir behaviors change yes when you're\nlow energy kind of lethargic even the\nway you think i mean look at what covets\ndone by having people coped up and not\nmoving very much right i've had a chance\nto use this product\nthere's products available right now\nthen and then i've been using those and\nthey're very powerful but this one is\neven more visceral i mean you feel like\nyou're ready to buzz around i cannot\nwait it's like it blows my mind what it\ndoes right so i think when people feel\nlike that my experience is they tend to\ndevelop different patterns it's just\nlike if you've ever gone on a cleanse\neven for a short time your palette\nchanges and all of a sudden you don't\nlike the things that you once liked so\nmy hope is for people there but i don't\njust rely on that as you know because i\nteach people all the other ways to shift\ntheir life but i think it's important to\nknow that there are some tools available\nright now and some coming very quickly\nthey will radically change the value of\nyour health and also regardless of your\nage it's the whole idea is like to be\nable to take as you get older to stay\nyounger physiologically and\npsychologically and emotionally\nincredibly priceless yeah that's that's\nfantastic though because\nthat specific idea that once you've had\nthe taste yes of what energy feels like\nwe all know that we make better\ndecisions when we experience that and so\neven if that can give people that shift\ninto this is how you could feel this is\nhow you are feeling now yes then we can\nmake better choices and most people also\nif they're going to find out about it\nthey've been pursuing something anyway\nright yes so it's like someone's going\nto pick up the book life for us they're\nlooking for answers they want more\nenergy or more strength or they want to\nhelp somebody in their family that's\ndealing with a real issue and they want\nto know the best so it's like an\nencyclopedia yeah it is this is what i\nwas saying offline i was like this is an\nencyclopedia i said i said to tony i was\nlike i was reading parts of each chapter\nbut this is truly an encyclopedia by the\nway the cartoons make it unencyclopedic\nbut these are brilliant they're\nhilarious and and they they truly crack\nyou up so uh one of the things i wanted\nto dive into with tony was that same\nthing that i experienced and i want to\nhear it from your perspective you've\nbeen biohacking for a long time what a\nfew things that you've shifted in your\nbehavior that have created more energy\nyes that shifts that actually helped you\nexpand your energy right like you said\nyou're serving more people right now but\neven when you are traveling you're\nmoving around the world you're coaching\nsports teams you're coaching individuals\nyou have groups yeah how have you been\nable to expand your energy year over\nyear what are some of the simple tweaks\nthat people could do today while they\nwait for this amazing product\nwell there's products now\nbut for me it's you know i was a vegan\nfor about 10 years and then i ate uh\nfish and salad basically for about 12\nyears so dietarily i've always tried to\nmake sure that what i had was as clean\nas possible to start with then i train\nlike a crazy person um you know i do\noxygen restriction training type of\nthings so that my capacity is strong but\ni'm also trying to train so i can\nliterally do two and a half marathons\nand a day and then another day another\nday another day um for me the most\nimportant thing i think has been for me\nis believe it or not it's been a\ncombination of hot and cold temperatures\nthat i use like i start every single\nmorning in the freezing water and i do\nit for two reasons one is it moves every\nbit of blood in your body and all your\nlymph in your system but also kind of\ntrain my brain to say when i say go we\ngo you know it's like it's there's never\na day i look forward to going in the\nwater and i have you know 56 degree\nwater here but in my home in sun valley\ni go literally through the snow and get\nin the river which is you know like 39\n40 degrees in the winter time and\nbut you feel so incredible when you come\nout but also it's just training your\nbrain saying i say go we go it's not\nlike oh i'm not ready yet or let me wait\nfive minutes and that becomes a\ndiscipline in your mind for everything\nelse in your life which is huge and then\nbelieve it or not saunas i just in the\nlast year have started using the saunas\nthey've seen a huge change i've always\nknown about saunas they use them you\nknow every now and then but there's so\nmuch research on it now and have it in\nthe book that'll blow your mind like\nfour days a week in the sauna for just\n20 minutes at 160 degrees plus whether\nit's a you know a laser type sauna red\nsonic going in or or a traditional one\nwill absolutely change your health in\nmore ways you can imagine like people\nthat don't really work out i can get\nthem to do this now and they just go sit\nin the sauna but what happens it reduces\nyour chance of a heart attack by over 51\npercent yeah it reduces your chance of a\nstroke by 62\nyour overall health is reduced i mean it\nand then here's the thing i noticed that\nhappens that people i get doing this\nthey wouldn't work out now they do the\nsauna and they put some music on or they\nput a movie in the background or\nsomething and the great thing is after\ndoing it for about a month sweating\neverything else now they want to work\nout now they want to do something else\nso i look for the things the quick\nlittle hacks that can make it happen in\nmy life i also use cryotherapy and\ncryotherapy takes your body down to\nminus 250 you know fahrenheit takes out\nlike you know i used to ice myself\nbecause after an event i've been you\nknow running up and down the stadium\nwalls and everything else every ounce of\nme 14 hours on stage 12 hours on stage\nis gone\nand i go to go ice like i did in\nfootball you know 20 minutes on 20\nminutes off it's painful but i had to do\nit now i go in for two and a half\nminutes in a cryotherapy unit and\nthere's no inflammation in my body it's\njust mind-boggling for people have\nosteoarthritis also\nlike my mother-in-law had such bad\nosteoarthritis even medications weren't\nhelping her and she was crying at night\nand i was like i gotta find an answer\nthat's how i found cry out then i\nstarted reading about cryotherapy and\nstarted reading athletes doing it but i\nstarted reading what it does for\nosteoarthritis she has no pain now right\nso they're just tools and you don't have\nto own one of these things yes you know\ni'm fortunate enough to have one here\nbut you know you can go there's local\nplaces all over the united states all\nover the world now where you can just go\nin five or ten minutes and it's amazing\npeople just need to try it out so\nthere's lots of different tools there's\nexercises you can do that i love called\nosteostrong i invest in this company\nit's a 10 minute workout sounds like\ntotal bs this is the one that speeds up\nyour metabolism yes well it also it\nhelps you build stronger bones which\nmost people don't care about bones women\nunderstand you know in their 50s\nosteoporosis is really a huge thing and\nmost of the drugs will eventually\nfossilize the bones this is the only\nthing that's been proven to increase\nbone density by about 14\nbut my athlete friends love it i love it\nbecause when your bones are stronger\nyour your muscles are limited by your\nbone strength because otherwise your\nmuscles will rip open the bone right so\nthis is a 10 minute exercise you do four\ndifferent exercises and you go to a\nlocal place you have to own the\nequipment and literally you're done in\nthat time and you see the transformation\nfirst time i did this i remember\ni've worked with this woman she was\nabout 63 years old and i went to gold's\ngym with her because he didn't have\nthese machines then\nthere was a way of doing it with weights\nit was a little bit spooky if you\nscrewed up because the weight was so\nheavy and there was this guy who was\nlike i don't know 25 26 years old\nponytail\nsweating like crazy doing the leg press\nand uh and we had a camera crew there\nand uh and she says sure he took a break\nand he sweat and she goes sir can i just\nget a quick set in between you and she's\nin normal clothes and she's like 62\nyears old 63 years old it looked like\nshe was almost 70. and he thought he's\nbeing punked right he gets up and she\ngoes would you put another 100 pounds on\nliterally another hundred pounds on and\nso there's a technique where you use an\nextreme amount of weight for a short\nperiod of time and it stimulates it\nbecause you don't get growth by working\nout you get growth by rest but you have\nto have a stimulus that's strong enough\nand i started doing you know i bench\npress in those days like 240 pounds and\nthen all of a sudden i bench press 525\nand i did 1600 pounds on the leg press\nand the guy from gold's gym came over\nheaven and filming he's like this you're\ndoing this with your mind is like no\nanybody anybody can do this but now they\nhave these machines so you don't have to\nworry about the weight being too heavy\nor dropping on you so there are these\nlittle tools\nthat can make you stronger make you\nfaster\nand then there's simple things i never\ndid like i was working on the sleep\nchapter at 6 25 in the morning and i had\nto be up in two and a half hours like\nwhat's wrong with this for this picture\nbecause my whole thing was all uh my\nwife loves to sleep eight hours nine\nhours should be thrilled my thing is\ni'll sleep when i die right right but\nthen while i'm doing the research for\nthis book\ni met this doctor who's the top\nneurobiologist over at up in in northern\ncalifornia where he works for google and\neverybody else he's considered the top\nsleep doctor in the world and he says\ntony i think i can convince you\nand i said\ngood luck\ngive me your best shot and he said well\ni did a study we got to study with 1.6\nbillion people on sleep and i go you\ncouldn't have possibly coordinated that\nhe goes i didn't have to it's all the\ncountry's 70 countries that have\ndaylight savings times wow and he said\nhere's what you got his name's dr walker\nhe says he says tony all you got to do\nis look at the real numbers let me show\nyou the numbers and he shows me that for\nthree days after we spring forward you\nlose one hour\nin every country in the world on average\nheart attacks increased 24\nand when we fall back and you get one\nextra hour\nall around the world in 70 countries on\naverage 21\ndecrease in heart attacks and then he\ndoes the same stats on accidents and\neverything else and then he showed me\nstats that show you know a man that\nslept four and a half five hours a night\nlike i was doing usually had\ntestosterone levels\nbut somebody's 10 years older than they\nwere that got my attention so it's a\ncombination of sleep it's a combination\nof the right diet it's a combination of\nthe right stimulus of exercise it's\nreally doing those fundamentals that\nmake a difference for you and then it's\ndoing these cool things like stem cells\nthat completely changed my life yeah\nwhat is what do you think having said\nthat what do you think is the greatest\nhuman skill not habit but mindset and\nskill that's a great question i don't\nknow if i got the what the greatest\nthere's so many it depends on what you\nwant out of your life right yeah but i\nthink the ability to manage your own\nmind and emotions is probably one of the\nsingle most important and maybe the\nsecond is the ability to influence\nothers because that's what makes you a\nleader and hopefully you're doing that\nfor a higher good because there are all\nkinds of leaders as you know but i think\ni don't think most people are very good\nat emotional fitness\nmost people are just not as happy as\nthey could be you know i did a one book\nmoney master of the game it was kind of\nlike this well only what i did in that\ncase is i interviewed you know 50 of the\nsmartest financial people in the world\nray dalio carl icahn warren buffett\nand\nout of 50 of them\nand you know again it's in my judgment i\ncould be completely wrong and i've spent\na lot of time with them some have become\nreally good friends there's probably\nfour or five that are really happy\npeople you go oh well money makes people\nunhappy you know money it has nothing to\ndo with money money makes you more of\nwhat you are it just magnifies if you're\nmean you have more to be mean with your\nkind you have more to give you know but\ni think that most people are just they\nhaven't learned to manage what's going\ninside doesn't matter how much abundance\nthey have they're still unhappy we've\nall seen people that great comedians\nthat have killed themselves\nanthony bourdain beautiful man traveled\nthe world killed himself you know um you\nknow fashion designers that have done it\nwe've all seen all these different\npeople kate spade\nand it's like what they had everything\nexcept they didn't master what's going\non here and here and you know this is\nwhy you lived your life the way you have\nas well so i think that skill set is the\nmost important one that's why even in\nthe book my last two chapters i think\nthe most important because it's really\nabout power of the mind\nbecause like everybody knows about\nplacebos right\nthey're only discovered in world war ii\nand it was discovered by accident this\ndoctor ran out of morphine and he's\ntreating these\nthese people that are badly injured and\nyou know you need the morphine not just\nso they're out of pain but so they don't\ngo into shock\nand the actual person who discovered\nthis gets no credit was a nurse because\nthe nurse had him a syringe and said\nwe've got some more morphine so he\nbelieved it and he said you'll be out of\npain in just less than a minute he\ninjected them and in every case none of\nthem went into shock\n90 of them were out of pain and they\nused nothing it was saline right so\nafter world war ii he went back to\nharvard and he was the person that\ncreated what we now consider to be the\ndouble-blind studies which are always\ncompared to a placebo right\nand what most people don't know is\nthe bigger the placebo intervention the\nmore powerful the mind believes it so a\nsmall pill is less effective than a big\npill\num an injection is more powerful than a\npill in terms of its effectiveness the\nmost powerful is a as a sham surgery um\nthe the veterans administration did a\nstudy and they did it on people doing\nknee surgeries and they took one third\nof the people and they just cut them\nopen\nanesthetized them and sewed them back up\ndid nothing a year later this group the\ngroup that had no surgery had the least\namount of pain the most amount of\nflexibility most of us so they stopped\nfunding those surgeries give you an idea\nbut that's how powerful it is and so\nwhen you it's even more than harvard did\na study where they took\nbarbiturates babies big red pills and\nsaid this is an amphetamine you need to\nprepare your body because you're going\nto speed up\nyou didn't give them something fake they\ngave them an actual drug that slows the\nbody down and the body sped up so most\npeople understand the power of the mind\nand so what i've tried to do is show\npeople even in this book here are the\nthings that you can do to take control\nof your mind because if you take care of\nyour body and then you don't take care\nof your mind and emotions you're gonna\nbe miserable yeah okay yeah what sparked\nthat question was something you said you\nsaid that you start your morning by\njumping in the cold that's right and you\nnever feel like doing it and you said\nthat i just say to my body it's time to\ngo\nand that's what sparked the question\nbecause i was like that's a really\ninteresting skill that you've trained\nyourself to be okay with discomfort yes\nyou're training yourself as your first\nskill of the day is yes i am okay with\nuncomfortable things yes and i know i\ncan get through those yes and that to me\nis what sounds like a really important\npart of emotional fitness it is because\nunless you can push through discomfort\nthose things that are going to give you\nthe greatest reward require discomfort\ninitially yeah right and the discomfort\nit's like you know my original teacher\njim rohn used to always say you know\nthere's two pains in life the pain of\ndiscipline or the pain of regret he goes\ndiscipline weighs ounces regret weighs\ntons you know and so i've trained myself\nto do that then i meditate then i always\nmake an acknowledgement call briefly or\nleave a voicemail for someone just\nbecause to spark the day and then i do\nthe first thing i do is always whatever\nis the most difficult yes because then\nyou have momentum for your day and when\nyou train your brain to do what's\ndifficult first\nthen emotional fitness just comes\nnaturally and more importantly so does\nachievement so does your ability\ncontribute to other people because i\nhave 105 companies now to get an idea i\nmanage 13 of them directly you know\nongoingly\nand you know there are all kinds of\ndifferent industries from a.i to you\nknow my resorts in fiji to sports teams\ni own and i mean it's insane the the\ndichotomy of home we're doing seven\nbillion dollars in business so i gotta\ndo that while i'm being a good dad to\nfive kids and five grandkids while i'm\ntaking care of my body while i'm living\nmy normal mission so if i don't take\ncare of my body and my energy and my\nmind\ni mean you'd be overwhelmed by all the\ndemands because listen all i gotta do is\npick up my phone and you're gonna have\nall kinds of oh that's oh [ __ ] that's it\nbecause you know what are the chances\nwith thousands of employees on three\nfour different continents now that\nsomebody's messing up if messing up is\nnot what i think they should be doing\nit's 100\nso i'd always be in reaction until i\ntrain my brain to say no you know\nproblems are a sign of life\nand all they are challenges to be solved\nand what makes you a great leader is\nyour ability to solve problems or teach\nteams to build a culture where they can\nsolve problems and so it gives me\nthis tremendous creativity and\nflexibility but i've got the base of\nenergy to make it work yes yes exactly\nand you've given yourself a permission\nto say this\nthis matters first before we get lost in\nthe 7 billion and 105 companies and all\nof that and i think that permission is\noften the toughest part yeah but but one\nof the things that stood out to me was i\nsat down and this was\na really beautiful answer that i want to\nshare with you because i think it will\nspark where i want to go next i\ninterview a lot of navy seals and i like\nsitting down with people who had extreme\nexperiences because i feel that extreme\nexperiences\nhave opened up different parts of the\nbrain different parts of the body that\nwe've never had and the spirit and the\nspirit too exactly and one of the people\ni sat down with was joker willing yes\nyou know he's been a leader for 25 years\nand um\nincredible navy seal highly accomplished\nand i asked him and we were on zoom\nright this was during the pandemic so i\ndidn't even get to have this with him\nyeah and that's why i'm so grateful for\nthis too i sat with him and i said to\nhim i said you've done everything that's\ndifficult and uncomfortable potentially\nknown to human beings\nin your field\nwhat's the most difficult thing you've\never\nand i didn't i didn't know what to\nexpect and i never do i try not to\nproject or predict what i think\nsomeone's going to say and he said to me\nsaid the most difficult thing\nthat i've been through\nis watching a fellow trooper go down\nnext to me yeah and having to carry on\nthe mission yeah without getting the\nmoment to save yeah to mourn yeah to\nhold to carry he goes they just have to\ncontinue the mission yeah\nand that was just an answer that you\nknow he could have said oh i was like\nstanding in the cold water he was doing\nthis was doing that and so i wanted to\nask you\nwhat was the most difficult thing when\nyou know all this and you've seen\nsomeone's pain\nand either they weren't willing to apply\nit\nyou saw them too late has there been\nsomeone in your life that you're like i\nhad all these tools to help them with\nbut they weren't ready to receive or\nthat it wasn't\naccessible at that time for them has\nthere been that or or have you found\nthat you've always found a way to get\nthrough and not even you personally i\nmean in your personal life too yeah i\nfirst of all identify i agree with what\njacques told you which is um\nyou know dealing with the loss of\nsomeone you care about is probably the\nmost difficult thing of all i would say\nmaybe\nas a child seeing\nthe level of frustration between my\nparents you know i had four different\nfathers and watching them kind of um\nyou know accept whatever life gave them\nas a it's why a lot of my drive came\nabout is seeing my father's\nbe berated by my mother who i love\ndearly um and just watching them break\ndown like you know\nprobably the single most\npainful event of my life but also shaped\nme in such a beautiful way was when i\nwas 11 years old we had no money for\nfood it was thanksgiving which in\namerica is a you know big holiday feast\nand so we've been without food before\nwe'd have crackers and butter and you\nknow we survived but we weren't gonna\nhave a thanksgiving feast and there's\nknock out the door and i go the door and\nthere's this giant guy there with\ngroceries in each hand he had a pot\nbeside him on the ground with an\nuncooked turkey and\ni i just like i said\nwho are you here for he goes i'd like to\nspeak to your father and my mom and dad\nwere yelling at each other saying things\nthat you can never take back and i'm\ntrying to make sure my younger brother\nand sister they're five and seven years\nyounger wouldn't hear any of this\nand\nthat day changed my life because i\nthought it was gonna be the most\nexciting day\ndad dad go to the front what is it\nthat's it's for you you answered no it's\nfor you i remember open the door and i\nwas just so excited to see my father be\nhappy like we're gonna have a feast this\nis gonna be incredible and he got angry\nand he's like we don't accept charity he\nwent to slam the door in the man's face\nand the man's foot was there so it\nbounced off his foot\nhe still opened the groceries he's like\nsir i'm just the delivery guy he said\nit's it's not charity everybody has a\ntough time someone bought this and\nthey're sending it to you as a gift my\nfather said we don't take charity goes\nto close the door again\nthis time the guy's shoulder was there\nalso so it bounced off again\nand then i was standing right there and\nthere's this moment i'll never get where\nthis man looked at my father and he\nlooked at me and he said sir don't let\nyour ego make your family\nuh\nsuffer\nand the veins of my dad's face on the\nside of his neck i'll never forget the\nbulge i like his face turned around i\nthought i was gonna punch him in the\nface and then there's this moment my\ndad's shoulders dropped\nhe took the groceries slammed the door\ndidn't say thank you\nand stormed off and i almost remember\nthinking like how come he's not happy\nyou know you talk about pain it's like i\nlove my father so much\nand\nhe\nthere's basically three decisions that i\nthink everybody makes in their life that\nwhether aware of it or not moment to\nmoment i figured this out afterwards\nbecause i was so obsessed with what's\nwrong because he eventually left our\nfamily and that was the most painful\nthing i ever had so it's like feeling\nlike i failed you know i blame myself\nlike why couldn't i get through to my\nfather when i was 11 years old\nbut later on it helped me understand\nthat three decisions are first you\ndecide what to focus on every moment of\nyour life there's something grabbing\nyour focus and you don't experience life\nyou experience the part of life you\nfocus on right what's wrong is always\navailable so is what's right right\nand there are different kinds of focus\nand my dad's focus that day was really\non what he hadn't done and i know that\nbecause he kept muttering it and i\nhadn't taken care of his family there's\nno funny for thanksgiving somebody had\nto give us charity\nand then the second decision you make\nabout once you focus on something is\nwhat does it mean\nis this the end or the beginning if you\nthink it's the end of a relationship\nyou're gonna behave different than it's\nthe beginning right um my dad's meaning\nwas that he was worthless\nand so then the third decision is what\ndo i do which\nwhatever meaning you come up with\ncreates the emotions which affects what\nyou do and what he decided to do is\nleave her family but for me it was like\nthis is amazing i mean\nyou know we are having thanksgivings you\nknow this is a this is incredible we\nhave food what a concept and then the\nmeaning though is what changed my whole\nlife which was\nwow\nstrangers care\nthat completely changed my life that\npainful experience\ni couldn't deny that somebody who wanted\nno credit\ndelivered this food to my family and so\nwhat i decided to do is say someday i'm\ngoing to do this for another family so\nwhen i was 17 i had two families and it\nwas a euphoric experience i went and\njeans and a t-shirt i didn't go like the\ndelivery guy but i wanted to see the\nface of the people and then next year\nwas four people and then it was eight\nand literally my thing was doubling my\nlittle company and then i got to a\nmillion people a year and i got the four\nmillion people here then i was doing\nmoney master the game\ni'm interviewing these billionaires jay\nand i'm watching congress cut food\nstamps it's now called the snap program\nby i think it was six billion dollars so\nevery family that actually needs food\nand my family was one of those back then\nthey all have to come up with a week's\nworth of food out of every month so i\nwas like call my team and i said how\nmany people have i fed in my lifetime i\ndidn't know there was 42 million meals i\nwas like this is pretty cool and i was\nlike what if i fed 50 million people\nlike my entire lifetime in one year and\nthere's like what if i did a hundred\nmillion what if i fed a billion people\nin 10 years so that was seven years ago\nwe're at 850 million meals right i'm\ngonna hit the billion earlier than what\ni promised and targeted and then i've\ngot a sustainable approach but i tell\nyou that because\nmy worst day was my best day\nmy the most painful day the day where i\nfelt i could do the least where i felt\nimpotent\nled me to have new understandings new\nskills new capacities new drives new\nhunger i mean would i really be feeding\n100 million people a year 100 million\nmeals a year if i was well-fed as a\nchild probably not and i'd love to\nbelieve i'm such a perfect person but no\ni'm just i just know what suffering\nfeels like so i don't want anybody else\nto suffer you know so i think sometimes\nthe suffering experiences of our life if\nwe don't let them crush us\nwe let them drive us they they actually\nbecome the best day in your life and\ntaking your worst day and making your\nbest day is a beautiful target for\nanybody\nthat that is just it's magical even\nhearing it\nit's a magical experience yeah\nyeah exactly i can only imagine like\njust hearing it i'm just you know it's\nsuch a beautiful visual so to live it is\njust you know on the other end of that\nthank you for sharing that so much it's\nsuch a it's so profound and so wonderful\nwith the with the questions that's what\nyou see you see there's grace in life\ntoo it's like if you can like i always\njust think in the early days because my\nmom was beautiful she was the most\ninfluential person in my life and yet\nshe also when she drank alcohol and took\num you know prescription medication she\ngot crazy yeah so she smashed my head\nagainst the multi bladder feed me liquid\nsoap and i never told anybody about\nswitches live but i had this group of\nyoung kids that i could see a tall white\nguy who seems to be quite successful you\nknow what does he know so i told him the\nwhole story\nbut out of all that it's like if my mom\nhad been the mother i wanted her to be\nyeah\ni'd probably not be the man i'm proud to\nbe yes like i i had to grow i had to\nbecome a practical psychologist at 11 to\nmanage her so that my brother and sister\nweren't messed up and it's like there's\ngrace in everything and i always think\nit's like it's our job to realize that\nlife's happening for us not to us and to\nfind how it's happening for us that's\nour job if we do that then we have a\nmagical life if we don't but if your\nenergy's low and you're exhausted then\nyou don't you don't find those\nempowering meanings yeah you know that's\nwhy to me you can't separate the mind in\nthe body\nyou got to feed the mind and strengthen\nthe body yeah on a daily basis in some\nway and if you do that life can be\npretty miraculous yeah and i did that\nfor too long i i can actually relate to\nthat it was my wife that turned me on to\nthe body because i was one of those\npeople that focused on the mind and the\nspirit right and as i shared with you\nearlier ignored the body yeah because i\nthought well i'm young i've always been\nhealthy i don't really know what\nphysical health looks like yeah and then\nmy wife is a nutrition a dietitian is\nalready health counselor counselor she\ncomes into my life and she's just like\nyou need to do this this this this you\nneed to change this in your diet and i'm\nthinking why are you asking me to change\nbut it was so fascinating to me because\nit's exactly what you just said you\ncan't disconnect the two and going on\nthat you said focus and mood about your\nfather yes you have a whole section in\nhere dedicated to focus and mood yes\nwalk us through that because what you\njust explained to us is the emotional\nfocus and mood yes of your father but\nhere you're talking about how the\nphysicality of focus and mood can affect\nthem they go they go together\ni'll give an example how powerful they\nare for this psychological side uh right\nnow you know out of covid so many people\nhave been shut down terrible place and\nyou know i'm sure you've seen that um\ndrug overdoses are the largest they've\never been in history was over a hundred\nthousand people last year suicides one\nout of four kids under the age of 30\naccording to the cdc whether they're\naccurate i don't know have considered\nsuicide sometime in the last two years\nbecause we all need a compelling future\nwe need to look something look forward\nto so stanford came to me\nand their genetics lab has been doing\nresearch on depression\nand\nwhat they found was that on by doing\nmeta studies is only 40 of the people\nwho go in for therapy who they get drugs\nand therapy together usually only 40\npercent make any improvement 60 don't\nimprove at all that's not a lot more\nthan what you get on some placebos\nand so\nthey approached me and said a couple of\npeople went through one of your programs\none was clinically depressed they're not\nanymore but we don't have any science on\nthis would you be one of us do a science\ntest i said sure so they came out to the\nstate destiny seminar i do which helps\npeople to change their values and belief\nstructures i don't tell them what they\nneed to be they figure out what it needs\nto be and it changes the way you\nperceive life the way you experience\nlife how you feel what you do it's a\nrewiring of your model of the world\nbasically in six days\nand so they said we're going to model\nthis after the greatest breakthrough\nthey found in science and no one able to\nfollow up on they about two years ago\njohns hopkins did a study on depression\nand they gave people psilocybin right\nwhich comes from magic mushrooms and\nthey did therapy for 30 days and at the\nend of it 53 of the people were\ndepression-free 30 days later never\nhappened like when we say 40 are helped\nthe average amount of help is 50 less\ndepressed right that's what the average\nsome people completely turn around some\npeople in this one 53 of the people so\nit's four times the result of any drug\nthat ever been done but unfortunately\npsilocybin is not legal so they're still\nworking on that and they said we're\ngoing to copy that exact study and we're\ngoing to have a group that they compared\nto which is didn't go to the seminar the\ncomparison group is going to do\ngratitude journaling and so forth\nbecause positive psychology talks about\nthat and they said that's probably what\nthis seminar does it's just positive\nthinking well the cool thing was when\nthey came out the results were so\namazing at stanford that they went and\nhad two new additional double-blind\npeople do the research because it just\nseems so ridiculous\nat the end of oh the first week 63\npercent of people had no who had no\ndepression symptoms at the end of six\nweeks it can increase through time a\nhundred percent of the people had no no\ndepression symptoms 19 of the people had\nuh suicidal ideation zero had suicidal\nideation it blows away any study it just\ncame out coming out next week in the\npsychiatric journal which is general\namerican medic association psychiat\njournal are the two top journals in the\nfield they can't even believe it so\nthey're going to do more and there's\nthe actual scientific article says this\nis more powerful than any drug therapy\nor any forms of normal therapy combined\nand what are we doing\nwe're getting people to change basically\nthose three questions to some extent\nbecause your values control what you\nfocus on\nif you're\nsecurity driven and you're here down in\nmy basement right now you're like\nwhere's the exit right you came down to\nslide like how do i get out of here\nright if you're adventure driven you\ndon't care you don't even know where it\nis so your focus is controlled by your\nvalues and your belief systems right the\nmeaning of things is controlled by your\nbelief systems so those three decision\nmaking things you know what i'm going to\nfocus on doesn't mean what i'm going to\ndo shift and one good example this j is\nmaybe your audience can relate to this\nso we just took three patterns\nso let's say focus most people have a\nfocus either on what they have or what's\nmissing we both we all do both\nbut what do you think most people focus\non more often what they have or what's\nmissing what's missing that's right\nnow\neven achievers do that\nlike it's not like somebody's not\nsuccessful it's one of the reasons you\nsee these achievers that no matter what\nthey do it's never enough\nbecause think about if you're always\nfocusing what's missing from your life\nhow can you sustain happiness\nit's software that will not allow that\nyou'll feel happy for a little moment\nthen you'll notice it's missing again\num what do you think's more often people\nfocus on what they can control or can't\ncontrol well they can't control yeah in\nmy seminars it's can control that's why\nthey go\ni want to learn how to take control my\nbody or my finances or my business\nwhatever it is so it's the opposite but\nthe average person it's what they can't\ncontrol and with kovid there's so much\nyou can't control around you that people\nreally sunk in that well how's someone\ngonna feel just everyone think about it\nif you're constantly focused on what's\nmissing from your life and what you\ncan't control\nand then we'll add one more\ndo you focus more on the past\nthe present or the future we all do all\nthree but we tend to have one we focus\nmore on where do you think more people\nfocus\nthat's right\nand achievers focus on the future\nand happy people in the present\nso so that you know if you're going to\nbe achiever the ideal is the presence so\nyou experience it anticipating the\nfuture so you can shape your life right\nbut the past you can change so i ask\npeople in seminars you've got stadium 15\n20 000 people and they'll say how many\nof you know somebody that takes\nantidepressants and they're still\ndepressed and eighty percent of the room\nraise their hand saying they know\nsomebody wow well how come because all\nantidepressants do is numb you so that\nyou're less intense but they don't deal\nwith the source of the problem which is\nyou're constantly seeing what's missing\nand it doesn't matter whether you're\nsuccessful or not that's why there are\nthese people that have been wealthy and\ntake their own life they see what's\nmissing they focus on all the things\nthey can't control there's plenty we\ncan't control but there's plenty we can\ninfluence and plenty we can control just\na couple of changes like that completely\nchange someone's life and so those\nchanges in the beliefs and values change\nwhat they look moment to moment change\ntheir experience of life\nthey're no longer depressed yeah the\nbiggest thing that i learned from that\napart from all the incredible stuff you\nsaid is i didn't think about security\nonce when we came down\nthat's either because i trust you a lot\nwith you if it was someone else telling\nme to get down the slide i don't know if\ni would have done it but now and now i'm\nlike going oh wait a minute we're\nunderwater now i'm starting to have all\nthe thoughts\nuh that's incredible that's yeah that's\nthose questions are fascinating to me\nand you were saying that the people that\ncome\nto your seminars are people that are the\nopposite and i think the same of the\npeople i listen to this particular\nthey're choosing to listen to this\npodcast because they want to take\nprobably just watching a show or\nbinge watching another series they're\nhere trying to take charge of that\nwhat kind of assurance can you give them\nthat that mindset\nis one that they should keep watering\nbecause i feel that often and you've\nprobably heard this in your seminars\ntime and time again people are like tony\ni'm trying i read the book i'm i'm\ntrying to put into practice but i still\nkeep failing or i still keep struggling\nsomeone who's already on but feels that\nfailure that rejection that pushback\nwhat can keep them going\ni think it's understanding there's no\nreplacement for persistence as\nsimplistic as that is it's like you know\ndisappointment either destroys you or\ndrives you and you have to decide which\none it's going to be if you don't\nconsciously decide there's always going\nto be more\nbs for you to deal with and i think but\nthat's why i think you know when i do my\nevents the reason i do the\n12 hours a day it's not because i like\ntalking it's just that i can tell you\nsomething all day long or i can get you\nto build the muscle yes and to build a\nmuscle is by experiencing i always tell\npeople a belief i believe is a poor\nsubstitute for an experience like i\ncould have a belief about you but i\nexperience you so i get to know who you\nare right the same thing's true is like\nyou have a belief about china i have a\nbelief about working out so i try to\ngive people experiences that are so\nprofound and then you know the the\nstudies they did they found people 12\nmonths later 11 months later we're still\nin the middle of covet they did my\ndigital seminar and you know they\nmeasured my body like the amount of\ntimes i jump i jump a thousand times in\na day and i weigh 282 pounds and i come\ndown four times the body weight so it's\na thousand pounds times a thousand\npounds of pressure i'm a lactic acid if\nyou've ever been with a friend and\nyou're running and you can't talk the\npoint you can't talk is a level four of\nlactic acid i'm in an 18 is still\nspeaking so they decided to do that on\nmy audience and they found an\ninteresting pattern it's the same group\nthat works with some of the you know\nsuper bowl champions and some of the\nstanley cup champions and so forth\nthere's a ratio in the body\nof testosterone\nversus cortisol the stress hormone and\nwhen the ratio is balanced they call it\nthe championship bloodline or\nbloodstream it literally gets you to\nfollow through so when they did my\naudience in my live seminar they found\nthat people literally mirror me all the\nway through the experience that's\nphenomenal biochemically that is\nphenomenal but then we did it on we did\nyou know because all of a sudden\novernight they said to me you know we're\ngoing to san francisco and the governor\nof california says you can only have 10\npeople\nand we have 15 000 so i was like we'll\ngo to vegas they'll never shut down\nvegas they shut down vegas i was like\nokay we'll do 1500 movie theaters with\n10 people in him they shut down the\nmovie theaters like okay we'll go to a\nchurch in houston i got a buddy i'll\nrent his church 15 15 000 people they're\nnot going to keep costco open and shut\ndown the church they kept costco up and\nshut down the church so i finally said\nokay i'm not gonna do some crappy little\nwebinar so i get this vision i'm gonna\nbuild this facility with 20 foot high\nled screens 50 feet wide all around me\ni'm going to call eric yawn at zoom i'm\ngoing to get them from a thousand up to\n25 000 people so i could interact with\npeople live in real time want to build\nan app so they can shake it and the more\npeople do it the louder it gets so it's\nreal so i built this whole thing so now\nwe're doing bigger events than ever in\nour entire history but they did the same\nmeasurements on them in different parts\nof the world and saw the exact same\nmirroring process wow and\nthe average person even digitally\nclarified ever yeah um 71 of the they\nhad 71 drop in negative emotions 53\nimprovement and positive emotions and 11\nmonths later in the middle of covid it\nheld\nbecause it's a biochemical change so\nwhen people say oh i'm trying i wrote\nthat's i write books because it's it's\nan easy entry point to people there's so\nmuch you can learn from the book but\nthere's nothing like the experience\nthat's why i do the events and like this\nlast two years because of covert i did\ntwo like six day free events we had 800\n000 people at 10 for six days just four\nweeks ago because i just wanted people\nto have answers where they are and then\npeople start to see they get momentum\nbut it's hard to do just reading\nsomething or watching a couple of you\nknow you know 20 minute or 15 minute or\nfive minute little pieces on youtube\nthose are great they might inspire you\nbut a transformation requires immersion\nit's like if you ask the average person\ndid you study a foreign language in\nschool most people oh yeah high school\ncollege speak it they don't\nbut if you turn around and you said okay\nwhat if you want to learn italian and i\njust took you to rome and dumped you off\nfor six weeks\nwith no teacher you're gonna come back\nsix weeks later speaking you know\nitalian so it's immersion and if you\nwant to master something i think that's\nthe thing most people don't do they read\na little bit they listen a bit they dip\nin and out they don't go day and night\nnight and day and total immersion and\nsomething that transforms them and also\nsomething that makes them push through\ntheir fears yes because in the end\nthat's the only thing that stops me\neverybody's got a story i didn't know\nthis person i don't have the resources\nthey have all the things they don't have\nbut if you're resourceful you can get\nthe money you can get the time you can\nget the energy you can get anything you\nwant and you've got to get over your\nfear to be resourceful so we do\nexperiences that are so\nphysiologically profound\nthat those fears do not stop you anymore\nyeah and that's what that's how we get\npeople to get you know ten years later\nthey're still transformed from an\nexperience that was one weekend the fact\nthat people are mirroring you that is\neven you keep yourself through a screen\nthat is mind-blowing it is mind-boggling\nand i threw a screen too yeah that blew\nmy mind but you know what's really cool\nabout the screens is like if you're in\nmy seminar you're in a giant stadium and\ni'm a dot i mean most people watch me on\nthe screen anyway right unless you're in\nthe front rows and but you know i can\nsee your eyes and feel what's going on\ni'm running around the building here i\ncan scan so many people and i see them\nin their home i see them with their\nchildren i see the interaction with\ntheir husband or their wife i see what\nthey're eating you know it's just it's\nand i'm with them 12 13 hours a day\nfor three or four days and we start here\nfor example 10 a.m and we're in 195\ncountries so we got one for 25 000\npeople march 17th through the 20th here\nand\nwe will have people in australia\nstarting at midnight wow and going until\none in the afternoon the next day for\nfour days wow and people in\nitaly are doing at a different time so\nit's like we literally have the whole\nworld engaged so that's been the\nblessing of cover it's like i always\ntell people you use stress or stress\nuses you right you had to figure out how\nto use covid um and i wanted to serve\npeople we found the way but again none\nof this happens you remember energy yes\nbecause your brain will just go oh man\ni've tried everything yeah you broke\nyourself out of it and i love the thing\ni love about immersion in events or\nretreats is that you actually build\nfriendships like the community that\ncommunity for sure the community of that\naccountability we're doing this together\nwe're growing together we're building\ntogether that there are people who think\nlike me and look like me i'm intrigued\ntony at this stage in your life what do\nyou look for in a friend i mean a friend\nyeah well that's interesting question\nyeah most of my friends are people that\nare\nunbelievably driven to contribute i mean\ni think\nyou know if you want an extraordinary\nlife\nlike you don't have to do that much to\nhave a good life for yourself\nso it's like most of us if you find\nsomething you care about more than\nyourself and i know you know what i'm\ntalking about jay and you want to serve\nsomething like you and i both i think\nsee what we do as a calling it's not a\nit's not a work per se it was work i\ndon't need to work every another day of\nmy life but\ni'm called you know so i think my\nfriends are people that are called and\nmy friends are people that are funny\nbecause i love to laugh\nbut they're just i love\ni'm the kind of guy i'm so easy if i go\nto a movie and somebody\nsacrifices and does the right thing you\nknow i cry my eyes out it's like i've\ndone since i was a little boy there's\nsomething inside me that just says\nthat's the goodness of the human spirit\nyou know and so my friends are people\nthat are made up of that basically and\ni have friends that are incredibly\nsuccessful the best in the world they do\ni have a lot of friends that are 18\nyears my senior 20 years my senior and\ni've known them since they were you know\n45\nand now they're 75 or 80 and so they've\ngiven me kind of see the road ahead\neverybody's path is different but the\nroad of life changes and i'm i'm you\nknow i'm in a stage of my life now where\ni'm um\ni'm able to mentor people at a different\nlevel\nyou know just because i've had so many\nlife experiences i've taken to history\nyou know i've been there with\ngorbachev at point when he's trying to\nfigure out what to do or princess diana\nwhen she's deciding\ndoes she want to no longer be princess\nyou know i've had some wild experiences\nthe greatest athletes in the world at\nkey moments in their careers so i've had\nthese cool tickets to history which have\nput things in such a perspective\nthat when stuff happens that\nupsets people it's like you know\ncompared to what\nit's like you know it's a it's pretty\nsimple compared to what most people\nhappen to go through so i feel really\nblessed but i hope people in the book\none of the things i hope people pick up\nthat you know young people don't think\nabout very much\nis testing\ni was never a person that like kind of\nlike you with your wife right i'm gonna\ndo this thing and then in order to\nperform i learned every biohack\nbut like i don't want to get in the\nsystem and get measured but today\nthere are some amazing tests so like i\nwould used to be afraid of cancer\nthere's a brand new test the one thing\nin common the book i should mention is i\ntell you all these stories of these\namazing things that have created these\nbreakthroughs and\nwhat they all have in common\nthese huge breakthroughs some of which\ntook 20 or 30 years and are just now\navailable\nthey all lost somebody\nthey lost a wife or a husband or a child\nor a close patient and it drove them not\nto accept the standard of care and find\na new solution and so one of those is\nthis test called grail it's a simple\nblood test anybody can do now just came\nout nine months ago eight months ago and\nit allows you to test your body for any\ncancer in your body and so why is that\nimportant\nbecause the national cancer institute\ndid a study and they found that if you\nget diagnosed at stage two ch3 or four\nyou have an 80 chance of dying i prefer\ni have a 20 chance of living and\nfiguring that out but their point is\nwell made it's hard to turn around if\nyou get at stage one or two you have an\n80 to 99.9 chance of living\nso\nwith cancer is going to affect most\npeople in their lifetime\nbe able to do a quick blood test and or\nan mri for those pieces and know exactly\nwhat's going your body is amazing we had\na doc a gentleman who came to one of our\ncenters\nand um he had already had his physical\nand his wife said i want you have the\nvery best and he's like i've already\ndone he had a really negative attitude\nbad which we understood\nand one of the docs said listen let's do\nthe grail test on you he'd already had\nyour analysis blood test traditional\nphysical\nand a guy ended up having bladder cancer\nbut it was really early\nearly\nso it was a 20 minute outpatient\nprocedure he has no cancer if he\nwouldn't have caught it\nyou got a real problem another one is uh\nit's called a ccta scan it's brand new\nit's one of my doctor friends my\npartner's one of my businesses called me\nup and he says tony and he's like mr\nunderstated he built 12 hospitals and\nthen he sold them because he wants to be\nin prevention and regeneration and he\nsays tony there's been one of the\ngreatest breakthroughs in cardiology\nthat i've seen the last 10 years you've\ngot to come check it out what is it he\ngoes when a doctor does a ct scan you\nusually don't get that unless you've got\na problem\nthere's a lot it's hard to read those\nscans they're very gray if you're very\nskilled to still miss it but there's\nthis new scan now that uses ai and it\nliterally opens every artery in your\nbody because what they're looking for is\nsoft plaques soft plaques can break off\nand it's called the widowmaker they give\nyou a heart attack or a stroke if you're\nand it happens to people now 35 40 years\nold it's happening younger and younger\nbecause of the lifestyles that we've\ntaken on but what's interesting is\nhardened calcium which is what they see\nwhen they do just a traditional scene is\nhealed\nso i've heard about it so i'm gonna go\nto the scan and i took my father-in-law\nwith me because he's 80 years old and\nyou know people around you when you get\nolder start saying you should organize\nyour affairs and i could just see his\nenergy drop he's a great guy anyway i\ntook him did the scan he's perfect he's\nabsolutely perfect and his entire\nattitude changed plus you know we have\nthe stuff we do for a lot of the great\nathletes think their career is over\nwhere they scan an area where you've had\nan injury and they use ultrasound and\nthen they use this fluid amino fluid and\nthey open up the channel so that a nerve\nthat's been trapped or some area heals\nit heals in minutes and so my my\nfather-in-law also had this hip problem\nif he'll just hit problem in 30 minutes\nhis heart's perfect we get on the air\nthe airplane the way home and he looks\nat me he goes you know tony these people\ntalk about living 110 under 220. i don't\nknow about that but\ni could live another 20 years i got a\ngreat heart i got this great\nyou've only been married my daughter 22\nyears that's like another lifetime you\nknow and so what i love is what it does\nfor people and then um and then same\nthing with hormones\nyou know when somewhere between 35 and\n40 sometimes early 40s hormones start to\nchange radically women are more attuned\nto hormones but they've learned hormone\nreplacement therapy\nbut like i had a guy that came he was 39\nyears old\ngained like i don't know i think it was\nlike 35 38 pounds or something like that\nreally working out hard making no\nprogress lost a sense of drive\nand we said well if you looked at your\nhormones he goes yeah my doc looked at\nmy hormones mormons are fine we look at\nthe blood test and his hormones i think\nwere his testosterone was like 160. most\nmen don't feel alive but unless they\nhave seven to eight hundred some as much\nas a thousand\nso he doesn't need replacement\ntechnically to be alive\nbut to have his body functioning ideal\nwas missing so all he did was small\namount of testosterone total\ntransformation loses weight got his\ndrive got his libido back got everything\nelse back so there's some little things\nyou can do there's metal tests\ni had\na really bad\na bad hit with mercury because i was a\nvegan\nthen i felt like i needed some other\nform of protein so i started eating fish\nand all i had was salad and fish salad\nand fish but i had tuna and swordfish\nfor my favorites those are 75 year old\nfish to eat all the smaller fish and we\npolluted the water so much now they're\nfilled with mercury\nand so i went to go get this set of\ntests and they tested me and on a zero\nto five where five is extremely\nconcerning i was 123.\nand so i've spent the last four or five\nyears getting that mercury out of my\nbody it literally was make it interrupt\nyour atp your energy level like if you\nstart feeling foggy or exhausted or\ntired\nit can be metals yeah and about one out\nof every three people including friends\nthat are 25 years old because of the\nenvironment right now they go and they\ndiscover they've got cadmium or they've\ngot lead or they've got mercury so i\nreally encourage people to go do that\nmetals test if you're not feeling great\na lot of times when people think it's\naging yeah it's just metals yes and you\ncan get them out of your system when\nthey're small and it's a hell of a lot\neasier than what i've gone through my\nlife and it's always it's really\ninteresting because you keep pushing you\ncan get lost in the fact that it's all\nin your head yeah and the truth is it\nisn't always all it is it's\nphysiological as well yeah i had that\nrecently where i was actually feeling\nfine but i went and did i went and did a\nlot of micronutrient tests i did a lot\nof other tests i want to go and do a lot\nof the tests you just recommended i'm\ngoing to definitely ask you where i\nshould go\nbut i went and did a basic vitamin d\ntest right i've been doing this since i\nwas a kid yeah and i went and my doctor\nand my health coach was looking at the\nstats and everything and she said to me\nshe said jay you're at 10.\nthe average is 60 and 100 is good\nshe goes i don't know how you get out of\nbed in the morning yeah and that affects\nyour hormones by the way correct d3\naffects your hormones yeah and i was\nlike i get out of bed just fine and and\nshe couldn't believe that i could\novercome a lot with your psychology\ncorrect right i was doing the same thing\nwith mercury in my body correct but i\nwas thinking imagine if my body was\ngoing to like just imagine what would be\npossible yeah and i think that's why i\nlove what you've done with this book\nlife force because that's what it's\nplacing emphasis on yeah so go get\ntested go check it out i love how you\nuse the language of coaches not\ncommanders yes right like we're not\ntrying to you're not saying to anyone\nthis is exactly what to do and this is\nhow to do it you're saying please go and\nexperiment with these things please\ndon't practice them implement them into\nyour life\nand i cannot wait to figure out how to\nimplement all these things in my life\nbecause i think it's so easy to sit back\nwhen you're in your 20s in your 30s yes\nand just go home okay right now things\nare okay i can eat i can pretty much get\naway with a bad night out or\nyou know what i also wrote this before\neven the subtitle says it it's for you\nand somebody you love yes because i love\nthat you're at the stage of life you're\nin you're going to start finding more\npeople whether it be your parents or\nsomeone else's in a challenge and so\nthere's like whether it's like for me at\nthis stage of my life i know so many\npeople that i don't know two times a\nmonth at least someone calls me and they\nhave family member with cancer or\nsomebody's starting to develop\nalzheimer's or somebody had a stroke and\ni didn't know what the hell to do before\nright because the standard of care is so\nweak in those areas but here you've got\nanswers that'll blow your mind or you\nknow somebody with parkinson's for\nexample like a grandma or somebody like\nthat\nthere's this new technique it's\nunbelievable use ultrasound it's called\nincisionless brain surgery they don't\ncut you open anyway i saw this woman\nwho's on 15 medications i don't know if\nyou've seen some of the parkinson's but\nthey can't they can't even hold a glass\nthey can't she couldn't walk across the\nroom and they it's an outpatient process\nit's in a hundred universities and and\nit's covered by insurance now this is\nhow unbelievable this is and most people\ndon't know about it you go in it takes\nabout an hour to find the pinpoint spot\nthat's creating the tremor\nthey treat it for 30 seconds\nthe woman comes out of the mri right\nand she gets the blocks quest room and\ni'm watching her and then somebody hands\nher a glass and it doesn't hit her like\nat first i don't know if you've ever\nseen somebody gets those audio implants\nand they hear for the first time yeah\nyes but they enter the glass and she\ncould hold the glasses she just started\ncrying uncontrollably\nthat was two years ago um two months ago\nshe did a 50-mile bike ride\nright i mean it's that's the kind of\ntools that are available if you've got\naustralia someone's got osteoarthritis\nand even kids 35 40 years old the\nathletes can create some real challenges\nin their body there there's a new\ninjection this is not approved yet it's\na phase three trial so phase one is\nsafety and then phase two is efficacy\nand then phase three is efficacy at\nscale then you get approved so it's in\nthe final stage they think it'll be\napproved either in the fall or spring of\nnext year\none injection if you've got\nosteoarthritis it causes your own stem\ncells to regrow all your tendons based\non the original dna input so it's like\n16 year old tendons even if you're 30 40\n50 or 60 years old and no more\nosteoarthritis brand new tendons inside\nyour body so that's the kind of world\nwe're in right now these are things that\nare happening right now that people just\ndon't know about why and why don't we\nknow about them and why why is it that\nyou have to go and dig all because it\nseems like what you've done is you've\nmined you and the team have gone in mind\nand gone to the very best to bring this\nto the fore like all my billionaire\nfriends they all know this because they\nall want the cutting edge right so all i\ndid is kind of took what i did with\nmoney master the game that's how i got\nintroduced to some of this and then i\nand also it was my own needs i tore my\nrotator cuffs so severely i was gonna\nfollowing a 22 year old professional\nsnowboarder down a hill and i'm not a\nprofessional snowboarder i could not\nmake those moves and literally when i\nwoke up was unconscious i thought i\nbroke my neck i ripped my rotator cuffs\nso what do you do i go to four different\ndoctors they all say surgery surgery or\nwhat's the prognosis well you may not\nlift your arm above your shoulder again\nit could tear again\nhow long to repair how long did rehab\nfour to six months i'm going to be on\nstage doing this with one arm over here\nso i've i work with a lot of the\ngreatest of all time athletes and\nchristian ronaldo was supposed to be out\nfor three months he did stem cells it\ntook him two and a half weeks\nso i was like what about them no no they\ndon't work they don't work and then it's\nlike i i have a final doc literally look\nme in the face\nand he he was a fan of my work i didn't\nknow going there and he's like oh my god\nyou're the tony robbins he goes on and\non you saved my marriage you made me all\nthis money didn't it and he goes\nthanks for hearing that but now i got to\nbe your doctor and he puts my spine up\nand he goes life as you know it is over\nliterally what he said to me and i said\nwell you clearly didn't go to my\ncommunication seminar and he's like this\nis not funny don't make a joke this is\nreal and he goes you know you have\nsevere spinal stenosis i'm in pain for\n14 years and he goes one good hit and\nyou're quadriplegic no more jumping no\nmore running no more life\nand like if you're hitting the stomach\nand you're ready for it i wasn't ready\nfor it i gotta be honest it was two\nhours of my\nfeeling like my life was over and then i\ngot my head back and then i was like\nokay i'm going to check out stem cells\nand i met bob ferrari\nall the top guys in the world he told me\nwhere to go in the united states the\nones i needed you know for your elbow\nyour knee your own stem cells might work\nbut if you're doing a shoulder and a\nback or something you need something\nmore powerful he said you need four day\nold stem cells i go i said i don't want\nyou know something that comes from\nbabies no no no no he goes when babies\nare born the cord is filled with this\nand the placenta is filled with these\nand so i went and did four days of\ntreatment just an hour a day of an iv\nand a shot\nfirst day i felt you know sleepy second\nday i had a cytokine response i wasn't\nscared i knew what it was kind of\nshaking freezing for 20 minutes but then\ni woke up the next morning and not only\nwas my shoulder program you memorized my\nshoulder you won't even believe it no\ndowntime no surgery but my spinal\nstenosis is gone i got no pain in my\nspine and i've had that for 14 years so\nit's like that made me that's why i\nwrote this book i became obsessed then\nthe pope invited me to come speak he the\npope puts on the biggest regenerative\nconference every two years and they want\nme to clean up speaker i'm like i'll do\nthat but i want to go through all four\ndays yeah and then i met all these\npeople that were sent home to die with\ncancer who have been turned around you\nknow stage four cancer because they some\nof the techniques in this book i met uh\njack nicklaus the greatest golfer of all\ntime he couldn't stand for more than 10\nminutes the pain was so bad and now he\ndid was supposed to have a spinal fusion\nwhich he did not do thank god and he did\nstem cells and now he's 82 playing golf\nand tennis again so i was like i became\nan evangelist and then i just i once\nsaid i want to learn the best of\neverything and i learned it was much\nmore than stem cells it's this\njust like you see technology doubling in\npower every 18 months and having a cost\nwe are code now so most people have\nheard of crispr i mean we're literally\ncuring diseases that have never been\ncured in history before and we're at the\nbeginning of the beginning of that\ngrowth curve so it's only up from here\nand the opportunities are extraordinary\nbut you can think of yourself but you\ncan also think of people you love who\nmight need your help and now you'll have\nanswers definitely i'm so grateful to\nyou peter and\nrobert for putting this book together\nbecause\ni like i said i just dived into it and\neat into each chapter and\nit's just so comprehensive it's so dense\nit's got every study and research that\nyou need to convince you that it's out\nthere yeah and now and i love what you\njust added to what i was saying that we\nneed to go use it for the people we love\nif it's not for us let's go use it for\nthem and then one day because you helped\neverybody else it will be there for you\nyou know how to do it exactly tony you\nhave uh been so generous with your time\nthank you i've enjoyed it with you very\nmuch generous with your energy thank you\nuh and of course in doing all the work\nand putting this book together you can\ntell that i'm writing my second book\nright now and i can tell that when you\nsee a book that is this well recessed\nand this deeply done uh you know that a\nlot of work has gone into that so i want\nto recommend we're going to put this in\nthe link in the caption in the comments\nsection everywhere the link to this book\ni know that it's already been an\nincredible international bestselling\nbook all over the world uh so if you\nhaven't already got it i highly\nrecommend you go and get it get it for a\nfriend too get it for a family member\nget it to give it to someone as well if\nyou know that they need this right now\nand of course get it for yourself and\nwe're donating i'm building 100 of the\nprofits in this book as i've done all\nthree of my books last three

disease\nresearch from three of the best\nresearchers in the world so hopefully\nthe book only changes your life but\nit'll also help other people too yeah\nthat's phenomenal so you're contributing\nas well as reading yeah which is\nabsolutely beautiful no i'm saying i'm\nsaying the audience gets to contribute\noh yes through you simply by even buying\nthe books even buying the book is\ncontributing it's true tony we end every\non-purpose interview with the final five\nuh these are five questions that are\naimed at usually\none word to one sentence answers okay\nbut we're incapable of that yeah\ni don't even want to do it with you i'm\nlike i'm like i don't want to do that\nwith you i want to break the rules i'm\nlike why am i going to restrict your\ngreatness to that anyway so here we go\nthese are your final five we can totally\ngo off piste i do not go for it i don't\ncare at all all right question number\none is what is the best advice you've\never received i think um\nfor me\nmy original teacher was jim rohn when i\nmet him when i was 17\nand i wanted to know why\nall my fathers were broke because they\nwere good men\nyou know i loved all four of my fathers\nand um\nand i remember him saying tony we're all\nequal as souls\nbut we're not equal in the marketplace\ni was like what does that mean and he\nsaid well think about it he goes you\nneed to become more valuable\nif you want to have economic freedom he\nsaid you have to work on yourself more\nthan anything else and you have to work\non in a way where there's something you\ncan do for others better than anyone\nelse or at least more a better quality\nand he gave me an example of like\nworking at mcdonald's and he said you\nknow if you work at mcdonald's\nyou know you make whatever it was in\nthose days five dollars an hour whatever\nit was and he said you know i go yeah\nbut that seems so unfair and he goes\nyeah and teachers i give example of\nteachers and there's these billionaires\nyou know that make a billion dollars a\nyear hedge fund guy you know and he said\ntony the guy you just mentioned he\nprovided a 40 return last year\nand that went to nonprofits everything\nelse he said that means those\norganizations double their money almost\nevery two years\nhe is adding massive value hundreds of\nbillion dollars so he made a billion he\ngoes this person is doing a job that\nanyone can learn in 20 minutes or half a\nday\nso it's a beginning job he said you've\ngot you got to think of it as one thing\nit's all about adding value how can you\ndo more for others than anybody else in\nthe world and that\nstuck with me i mean i was like i i\ndecided i wanted to do more further than\nanybody in the world in order to do that\ni had of certain skills and i went after\nthose skills and i still do like it's a\nnever-ending thing if you think you're a\nmaster you're full of it right so i\nthink that's probably some of the best\nadvice i've received at least\non life and business and direction and\nit affected my mission yeah that's great\nuh second question what's the\nworst piece of advice you've ever heard\npiece of advice you've ever heard not\nreceived maybe received though oh my god\nwell i've had lots of pieces of advice\nabout what to do my body which would\nhave\nyou know like like the really sweet man\nlike sincere man\nand i realize that people can be sincere\nand be sincerely wrong yeah um but like\nif i would have taken that drug\nyou know i probably would have had\ncancer yeah um\ni don't know i mean i try not to listen\nto or forget i mean advice isn't too\ngood i think anybody who who advises you\nto give up is the wrong that's probably\nthe worst advice of all because anything\nthat you persist in long enough you can\nfind the answer to i believe yeah and\nbased on that also the first piece of\nadvice you get on your health yes is not\nalways the right piece i'm glad you\nmentioned this the mayo clinic did a\nstudy\nin 2017 they took 286 patients with\nvarious diagnosis and they took the\nfirst diagnosis and they had a\nsecond doctor do a diagnosis\nonly 12 of the time did they match that\nmeans 88 of the time the first diagnosis\nand the second were different\nas a result the mayo clinic says you\nshould always get a second opinion and\nthey believe getting a second even a\nthird one refines the diagnosis and\nmakes it better because everyone's\nworking through their perceptions it's\nnot we think of\nmedicine as like black and white you\nknow it's right or it's wrong and it's\nit's a lot of art in in medicine and\npeople don't realize that and that's why\nthe standard of care doesn't always get\nthe result they want that's why these\nbreakthrough doctors beyond the standard\nof care they were attacked some of them\nbeginning like there's a man named dr\njune and they're decreating these car t\ncells and i think it's nature just did a\npublication ten years later they're\nstill you know in cancer they never call\nit a cure they're actually calling it a\ncure for the first time for liquid you\nknow like like leukemia and things like\nliquid cancers and it's like it's\namazing so you you've got to understand\nthat there's more than one opinion and\nyou don't give up too easily with just\none yeah and that applies to life too in\nso many ways like you said i always say\nit's like if it's if it's about your\nhealth if it's about your relationship\nif it's about raising your children if\nit's about your spiritual development\nthose are areas where people should be\nyour coach not your commander yes get\nlots of input and you decide because\nthey could be and be sincerely wrong if\nyou're wrong at least you learn from\nyour own experience absolutely question\nnumber three uh\nwhat's something you think the majority\nof people value but you don't value\nfame but you know it's easy when you\nhave something then it's like easy to go\noh everybody wants it you know but it's\nlike when you experience when did that\nhappen did was there ever a time you\nvalued fame or or was it the experience\nof it that made you devalue it a little\ni wouldn't say a devalue i i still\nappreciate it it's it's a privilege like\ni get you know i can walk in the room\nand have people that i have a connection\nwith you know but it's been more based\non my contribution to them than just\nbeing famous perspective yeah okay i\nmean that's the difference you're like\nall my friends you know in the movie\nbusiness like somebody comes up and they\nget upset because they go they don't\neven know who i am they just want\nsomething from me and mine is it's a\nprivilege if somebody can be lit up by\nyour presence to me it's a privilege so\nbut i think i think\ni never i was never pursuing fame yes um\ni you know i certainly wanted financial\nfreedom because i grew up without it for\nmy family but i never uh i was never\nlooking to be wealthy\num but i'm fortunate enough to have a\nlot of economic freedom at this stage so\nbut i know that there are people that\nhave got billions of dollars i've worked\nwith them and they're miserable i've got\npeople that billion dollars and they\ntake their own life yeah you know what\nmatters is where's your emotional home\nnow where do you live emotionally if\nyou're\nwith a billion dollars and every day\nyou're pissed off and frustrated your\nlife is pissed off and frustrated if\nyou've got three beautiful children or a\nbeautiful husband or wife and all this\nlove in your life but you're worried all\nthe time\nyou don't feel the love you're worried\nso my my thing is valuing the emotional\nhome and making it the richest place\npossible inside yeah because that's the\nonly thing you can control yeah you\nreminded me i was with one of my clients\nwho\ngets recognized a hundred times for\nevery one time i would get recognized\nand you'd get stopped every two seconds\nif someone take a picture maybe someone\ncome shake my hand and talk to me\nand we spent a whole day together and\nthis would happen multiple times a day\nfor him and a few times for me\nand he said something really beautiful\nwith me that that mirrors what you've\njust said now he said to me he said jay\nthe difference between me getting\nstopped and you getting stopped is they\nstop me for who i play in the movies\nbecause they stop you for who you are\nthat's right and and that's what i feel\nwith you it's like what you were saying\nthere it's like that is a privilege and\nan honor\nand humbles me because it's the idea of\nyeah like that person he's like they\ndon't even know who i am they don't know\nwhat i stand for they don't know what i\ncare about so yeah that was yeah thank\nyou for sharing that thank you all right\nquestion number four is if you could\ncreate one law that everyone in the\nworld had to follow what would it be\nlove\ni mean i mean love is as corny as this\nlove is the answer right it really is i\nthink\nfear is what you know if there's a\ndisease of humanity\nthe disease that messes us up i think\nreally is selfishness yeah and i think\nif there's a cure it's love yeah and i\nthink um you can't mandate it but when\npeople experience it it becomes a\nmandate in their life you know i love\nthat absolutely and fifth and final\nquestion you mentioned a book to me that\ni must read and you said you wanted to\ntalk about in the podcast too so fifth\nand final question i thought maybe i'd\nlet you share on that point yeah if you\nwanted to talk about cycles there was a\nbook i read i think it came out in the\nearly 90s it's called the fourth turning\nand it's it has a the conceit of the\nbook is that there are seasons in\nhistory and as i mentioned to you\nearlier if you think about like what\ngives somebody power in any context it's\nthree things it's pattern recognition so\nif i'm great at running businesses as i\nam today i'm pretty good at it it's like\ni recognize there's only so many\npatterns i know what to do i can\nanticipate not react i can grow it if\nyou're great in let's say the stock\nmarket you know and recognize patterns\nif you're great with music you know case\npatterns if you're great spiritually you\nrecognize patterns\nbut the second skill is you don't just\nrecognize them you can use them\nand the third skill is when you've\nrecognized and used enough patterns you\nstart to create them and that's a\ndifferent dimension of what's going on\nso in this book you really start to see\nthat humanity changed when we recognized\nthe pattern of the seasons\nas soon as we understood seasons we\ndidn't have to be wandering through the\ndesert anymore searching for things we\ncould stay we could grow crops because\nwe found out if you plant in the winter\nit doesn't matter how hard you work\nnothing happens but when you know the\nright time to plant when you don't do\nthe right thing at the right time\nthen all of a sudden humanity go into\ncommunities and cities and states and\neverything else\nwell we have also seasons of our life\nso you know in in you know some of the\ntraditional let's say indian\nphilosophies i'm sure you know we can\nlook at these four stages but we can\nlook at it and say well first 20 years\nof your life roughly you're primarily\nlearning and taking things in some of us\nhad to work at five years old and so\nforth but overall that's how it is from\n20 to 40 that you know it's not spring\ntime summer you're figuring out who you\nare okay they told me all this crap now\nthey test it do i really believe that\ndoes it really work i now have real\nrelationships i think i'm invincible\nmaybe i'm not i've been discover 20 to\n40 is this massive growth period in your\nlife and if you grow during that time 40\nto 60 is really a reaping time right\nit's like the fall and the autumn and\nthings come together and things go great\nand then from 60 to 80 and maybe 80 on\nif you have an extended winter that's\nthe winter time where now you get to be\nkind of an elder so everyone is going to\nhit winter if they live long enough\nmeaning some people experience winter in\nthat zero to 20 stage some people 20 to\n40.\nwhen you experience it shapes your life\na lot so in america the generation we\ncall the greatest generation is the\ngeneration of world war ii\nand they were not respected as young\npeople i bring this up because\nmillennials you know older people very\noften look at millennials and go oh\nthey're snowflakes they can't handle\nanything and some are in every\ngeneration they're people like that but\nthe generation was born let's say in\n1910\nthat generation if you think about it\nthey came of age\ngoing to that 20 year old range what\nhappened in those 20 years well world\nwar one ended and america was one of the\nwinners and then there was the roaring\n20s and new technology and cars and\nparties and all this abundance it was\neverywhere so they grew up thinking\nthat's what their life was going to be\nlike and at 19 years old they were born\nin 1910 it was 1929\nand the whole world around the world\npeople jumping out of buildings the dust\nbowl in the middle of place jobs lost i\nmean\nit was intense and they were called\nflappers they were not respected they\nwere just partiers they didn't give a\ndamn about anything they had no\nresponsibility and suddenly life hit\nthem and they grew they had to and they\nwent through 10 years of that depression\nonly to make it to 29 years old when\nit's now 1939 and world war ii breaks\nout and you and i weren't alive then but\nanybody alive then will tell you hitler\nwas winning countries were dropping in\nyour country in london it was being\nbombed i mean it did not look like we\nwere going to win it was dark right and\nthey made it through that went over\nfought the war and won so they have this\nstage of their life from 20 to 40 which\nwas a horrendous experience but it made\nthem so strong and they came back heroes\nand they started the next springtime\nbecause that was winter right so next\nspring time was the late 40s after world\nwar ii through the 1950s early 60s until\nkennedy was shot that kind of 18 20 year\nperiod was a period of great prosperity\nand growth and everything is easy and\nthen you have a summer which is always\ninternal conflict and you can see this\nin a thousand years of roman history\nevery 1800 years he's seen the same\npatterns and then after that you have\nanother fall where finances flow stock\nmarkets rise everything glows again this\nhappens over and over and over again\nthrough history so when you see it it\ngives you perspective and so we're in\nwinter right now\nwe've been in winter since about 2008\nand we're not done we probably got\nanother six if history shows you know if\nit's repetitive it's not exact yeah\nthere's probably another seven or eight\nyears of this and what happens in winter\nis the external world gets the last\nwinter was world war ii\nand the external world is reformed\ndifferent countries relate in a\ndifferent way you know a new reserve\ncurrency happened the united states\nbecame the dominant force now you're\ndealing with china we're seeing the\nchallenges happening in russia and the\nukraine we're seeing things all over the\nworld people are looking at life\ndifferently people are worried about\nwhether planet's going to survive or not\nglobal warming and so there's going to\nbe a lot more turmoil there's internal\nturmoil within most countries including\nunited states but\nwhat i try to tell people it hopefully\nhelps them is winter does not last\nforever no pandemic has lasted forever\nno war has lasted forever and what's\nnext is springtime if you were god when\nyou work it out that way after the\nvicious night you have this beautiful\nday after the tough winter there's this\nnice springtime so the goal right now is\nget strong in winter not to fold\nto if you're gonna be strong in this\nseason in your business in your life\nthen when springtime comes it's a piece\nof cake and if you do well in business\nduring this time if you look at the\nfortune 1000 65 of them were born in a\nwinter in a depression or a recession\nwhether it's exxon or it's disney and\ndepressions or whether it's pizza hut\nfederal express that was done in\nrecession or apple or microsoft in a\nrecession\nso if you do well then\nyou tend to do well through time and so\nthis is a time you know not to say oh\nit's winter i'm going to freeze to death\nit's like no it's a time to learn grow\nexpand spend time with your family\nsnowboard you know take advantage of the\nseason and don't think the season is\nforever yeah and if you if you read a\nbook like this\nit's a book that like some of the\ngreatest leaders i know have all read\nthis book i got they also wrote a book\ncalled generations it's about 550 pages\nof anglo-american history and it shows\nhow each generation affects it so what\nyou start seeing is\nthere's patterns here there's patterns\nin history this isn't forever\nhow do i use what's in front of me\ninstead of freaking out and saying oh my\ngod the whole world's coming to an end\nbecause it looks like that when the dark\nknight of the winter happens with the\ndark night of the soul yeah tony thank\nyou so
