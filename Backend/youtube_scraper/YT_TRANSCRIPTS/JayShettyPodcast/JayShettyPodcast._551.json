    "transcript": "you can only attract to you what\nvibrates in harmony with you\nso if we see things coming into our life\nthat we don't like let's understand\nwhat we don't like is in harmony with\nsomething inside\nhow do we keep\npositive and\nmotivated in the journey\nof cleansing our paradigms\ntowards our soul how do you keep\na\nsustained level of enthusiasm\nin this journey that actually requires\nquite a lot of profound internal work\ni think you were\nsaid the right word there in enthusiasm\ni think people are looking for\nexcitement\nyeah yeah very well and there's quite a\nbig difference absolutely i've always\npointed out when you see a person that\ngets excited when something good happens\nyou're going to see somebody gets\ndepressed when something bad happens\nand\nthere's a great lesson in that\nbut rather than getting\nexcited we should get enthused we want\nto look where enthusiasm comes from it\ncomes from\nin theos which is in spirit\nand everything just is\nand if we can look at it it just is it's\nneither good nor bad\nit just is\nwe're not going to get excited we'll get\nenthused\nand if we look at\nthe negative it just is\nit's not going to depress us because it\njust is\nso i think the trick there is to\nunderstand the difference between\nenthusiasm and excitement\nand how do you maintain the enthusiasm i\nthink the only way to maintain it is to\ncontinually study who you are\nnever stop studying\nand now\ni don't think\nyou just sit and study do nothing else\nyou have to study you have to study\nunderstand and you have to apply it\nso it all comes out in results\nnow i have found a great way to measure\nresults is in money\nyou can measure it to the penny\npeople say happiness or health you can't\nmeasure a person's happiness\nand you cannot measure their health\nyou can go and you can have a checkup\nand they'll say\nguy's in perfect health he walks out of\nthe doctor's office so bang he drops\ndead\nhe wasn't in perfect health at all\nit appeared he was\nand\nbut in earning money you provide service\nbut you got to control the money you\ndon't let the money control you\nand then if you fall in love with the\nidea of providing service and it's in a\nprofit-making way\nyou can earn a lot of money well then\nyou can put that money to work to do\ngreat things with\nand that's sort of the path i'm on\nand uh like my partner and i we build\nschools over in africa\nand we do them through\ncynthia kersey out there in los angeles\nwhich is the unstoppable foundation\nand um\nwe take a lot of joy in that\nwe have people from the company go over\nand see the work that we're doing you\nknow that they're contributing to\nso i think you um\nyou've got to keep checking your results\nand you have to keep raising your own\nlevel of awareness and the only way to\ndo that is to continually study\nand but control your life don't let life\ncontrol you\nso you're living from the inside out\nwhich sounds very esoteric or\nphilosophical\nbut it's the only way i can explain it\nbecause that's really what you're doing\nsee when you talk about money bob uh\nyou know i feel aligned with that too\nthe idea of\ni i grew up in a mindset of where\ni often thought that you know money was\nthe root of all evil or that money meant\nsomeone had to do something negative to\nget it or you always had just enough to\nsurvive\nand i i find that we still see that\nparadigm\nexisting in society but see when you\ntalk about money and even when i learned\nwith the monks where we really\nunderstood the value of money you see it\nas a as an energy source of service you\nsee what it is\nyeah exactly you see it as an energy\nsource of service of helping of giving\nof providing\ntell us about that mental shift that's\nmade\nbecause i feel that you're obviously a\nteacher in the law of attraction and and\nyou know popularized and shared that\nconcept\nhow about when what are some of the\nmyths with the law of attraction when it\ncomes to money\nbecause i find that there are a lot of\nmisuses or misapplications of the law of\nattraction when it comes to money oh\nlisten when it comes to law of\nattraction\nit's almost synonymous with ignorance\nhardly hardly anybody understands the\nlaw of attraction\nthe uh the secret of course\nyou know\nreally blew up the law of attraction in\na big way caused a lot of people to\nthink about it but we didn't explain it\nproperly on that movie didn't get into\nit in depth\nand most people don't know how to get\ninto it in depth\nattraction\num\nis not a it's a secondary law it isn't a\nprimary law the primary law is the law\nof vibration and the law of vibration\ndecrees that everything moves nothing\nrests\nwe live in a notion of motion\ncirculation being one of the first laws\nin the universe when stuff when\ncirculation stops death sets in\nwell\nwe\noperate\non a frequency you do i do\nand what we're really attempting to do\nis raise the frequency that we're\noperating on we want to operate on a\nhigher frequency all the time because\nthat's where\nthe real beauty of life is\nwell\nthis thing we're living in is a\nmolecular structure in a very high speed\nof vibration\nand the brain is an electronic switching\nstation that alters the vibration we're\nin\nwell we operate on a frequency and the\nonly thing we can attract to us is that\nwhich\nis in resonance with us\nso the reaction is actually attraction\nit's like emerson said the law of cause\nand effect was the law of laws\naction reaction is the law of cause and\neffect well our thoughts\nfeelings and actions we send off\ninto the universe it's a vibration\nthe universe sends it back it responds\nin like manner well the response of the\nuniverse is the attraction\nyou can only attract to you what\nvibrates in harmony with you\nso if we see things coming into our life\nthat we don't like let's understand\nwhat we don't like is in harmony with\nsomething inside\nso we better try and understand what it\nwas or what it is\nand then\nget rid of it\nattraction's a secondary law\nand we've got to understand it is\nvery real\nand you only attract to you what you're\nin harmony with\nwhen you want something that's on a\nhigher frequency you've got to operate\non that higher frequency because all the\nthoughts and things that you require are\non that higher frequency\nmost people i say are living on an am\nfrequency trying to listen to fm music\nit doesn't work\nhow do you know what vibration or\nfrequency level you're operating at\nuh because\npeople often judge their\npeople judge their performance by their\nproductivity by their efficiency we're\nnot trained as you said with your\nparadigm again going back to that we're\nnot trained to observe our frequency and\nvibration and people are not sure so if\nsomeone's listening and watching us\ntoday how do they know what their\nvibration or their frequency is how do\nthey diagnose that\nwell i think the only way to do it is by\nthe results you're getting\nit'll tell you\nright makes sense see the results do\ntell the truth\nthey don't lie spirit manifests through\nits polar opposite\nalways\nwe're spiritual beings\nspirit flows to and through us\nand we'll do anything for us whatever we\nask it'll give us\nand we're asking in thought\nso what we want to do is take a look\nwhat have i been thinking take a look at\nyour results you'll know what you're\nthinking\nthat's how you can tell the frequency\naround you want to start\nfrequencies vibration vibrations feeling\nwhen you say i feel bad what you're\nreally saying is i'm not in a very good\nvibration\nyou say i feel particularly good you're\nsaying i'm in a pretty good vibration\nconscious awareness of vibration is\nreferred to as feeling\nso i think the way to really understand\nthe frequency and the vibrations you're\noperating on is by the results you're\ngetting\nyeah\nif you're continually having problems in\nall areas of your life\nyou're on the wrong you're in the wrong\nvibration\nyou know very low level of vibration\nand we can change it now i teach that in\nthe seminars i have\nways of illustrating and everything\nand um it's important and as people get\ninto it\nthey really like it see i think when you\nhear the truth you'll know it\nand\ni came across i don't know it came to me\ni guess i was searching for a way how to\nexplain that\nwhen you hear the truth you'll know it\nwell\nthere's music in this room right now\nthere's music in your room you may not\nhear it but we know it's here\nit's being broadcast it's in the room\nand we don't hear it because our ears\nare not operating on the frequency the\nmusic is being broadcast on\nbut if we turned on a radio the radio\npicks up on that frequency speeds it up\nas a zippo way up onto higher frequency\nand we can hear it\nwell\nit's the receiver on the radio that\npicks it up\nsends it off on a higher level where you\nhear it\nwhen you hear the truth the truth\nresonates with the essence of who you\nare\nand when it resonates it sets up that\nvibration\nit comes out on the conscious level as\nknowing it is no\nyou just know that's right\nyeah\nwhen you hear the truth you'll know i\nknow it that's true\nwell that's true when you're reading\nsomething\nwhen a person says something to you\nyou hear it you just i know that's not\ntrue\ni know that is true\nit resonates with the essence so we\nthere is perfection our spiritual dna is\nperfect\nand when we hear the truth it's like\nthat's the receiver\nand it clicks in you know\nyeah\nwe're pretty\nfascinating expressions of life you and\ni and\neverybody else i mean\nthe beautiful part is like i've studied\nthis like a scientist\nprobably\nmore serious as the time goes on\nbut\nfor 60 years starting on the 21st of\nthis past october\nthis is my 60th year and i study this\nevery day i mean this is\ni'm obsessed with this\nand\nat one time that bothered me uh it\ndoesn't anymore\nand so\ni i just don't stop studying it and it's\nso beautiful\nbring that that other thing up instead\nof bothering me\n[Music]\ni used to think you hear things and you\nthink the positives are negative i hear\nobsession i thought that was negative\nsomebody told me i was obsessed with\nsomething or i thought i was obsessed\nbut then i got a hold of lloyd c\ndouglas's book the magnificent obsession\nand i i thought\nhow could it be negative it's\nmagnificent you know yeah\nso i got the dictionary out and i looked\nthe word up i don't know why i hadn't\ndone it before that\nand it says an obsession is the\npersistent disturbing preoccupation\nwith an often unreasonable idea\nit's a magnificent\ndefinition\nand i'm obsessed with a beautiful\nconcept\nwho am i\nthat's that's the obsession you know\nyeah it's a great obsession um\nit's it's the beginning of all knowledge\nright it's the seed of all knowledge\nlike everything starts from that true uh\neverything starts from that question\nuh and and it's it's yeah it's the\nbeginning of all knowledge and and\nseeking of of true knowledge i loved\nwhat you said about the truth always\nresonating tell us a bit about bob\naround the\napplying the law of attraction to\nto love in our lives because i find that\none of the biggest paradigm blocks that\na lot of us have and i know a lot of my\nlisteners feel challenged with is the\nfinding of love the keeping of love the\ngrowing of love in a relationship with\nanother person\nit can be one of the biggest challenges\nas you said our spiritual dna is perfect\nbut our material experiences in dna\ncomes with baggage and pain and stress\nand we end up attracting or vibrating at\na level where we\nattract something that that actually is\nwhat we need at the time but isn't what\nwe really truly want\ntell me a bit about your experience in\nthat area in your field or study in that\narea\ni think that love\nis resonance\nwhen two people are in love\nthey're on the same frequency\nintellectually emotionally and\nphysically\nmost people\nthat get married are not in love\nthey're in habit\nor that stay married or not in love\nwhen two people are in love they enjoy\nthinking about the same ideas\nconscious mind deals with ideas\nthey get emotionally involved with the\nsame idea so they're setting up the same\nvibrations\ntheir heart is on the same frequency\nand physically they enjoy doing the same\nthings they have a great physical\nconnection\nthat's when two people are in love\nthey're in harmony intellectually\nemotionally and physically\nyou can fall in love with your business\ni'm in love with the business that i'm\nin\nintellectually emotionally and\nphysically i'm in it\nright up to here you know\nso that's where i see love comes in i\nthink i don't think most people that are\nmarried or in love i think\nthey see each other and he thinks god\nshe looks pretty good and she thinks he\nlooks pretty good and\nthey go to bed and go to heaven for 15\nminutes and they say we're in love well\nthey were actually having some fun\nbut they weren't in love\nbut they thought they were and so they\nget married and they have nothing in\ncommon really\nand\nsome of them will\ngive the marriage a quiet funeral and\nget on with life and others will\njust stay there and live like that but\nthere isn't any love there may be\nrespect and\nthings like that\nbut i see love is when it's harmony it's\nresonance\num you can love a person you can love an\nidea\nyou can love a vocation\nyou can love a place\nyou know\nit's like paul the apostle he said the\ngreatest thing is love and he's so right\nwell that's when everything you're in\nharmony with everything\nin all aspects of your life\nand pretty well the way i'm living\nnow it's taken me 87 years to get here\nyou know\nbut life's pretty good\nyeah i can tell i i feel it from the way\nyou speak it's it's definitely there\nwhich is beautiful\nwhere where does anyone who's listening\nto us today bob will definitely feel\ninspired and moved\nwhat would you want someone to do\nstraight after they stop listening to\nthis episode\nas they go back into their own life\nafter listening to you today what do you\nwant them to do what are you who do the\nwho do you want them to be where would\nyou like them to start\ni'd like to ask them to ask themselves\nwhat do i really want in this life\nwhat do i really want\nand take a pen\nand write it down\n[Music]\nwhat do i really want in this life\nthey might start out\nwhat do i love doing\ni think that's where you start your\npurpose in life is what do you love\ni'm living my purpose so your purpose is\nwhy you're alive why you get out of bed\nin the morning\nand some people never figure that out\nthey never even give it any thought\nwhen it's\nprobably the most important question a\nperson can ask themselves\nif you start out what do i really love\ndoing that's a good place to start\nyou know i had a\ndoctor here\nprobably a couple of years ago now in\nphoenix\nhe was in a seminar and he said\nhe was telling me he was thinking of\nquitting the medical profession they\nsaid why are you going to quit\nwell he said you've got to put in a lot\nmore time to earn less money today and i\nsaid well i've heard that\nhe said the medical profession is all\nmessed up and they said well i've heard\nthat too\ni said why did you become a doctor\nwell he said i'd love it\nwhy would you want to quit\nwell he said because you can't earn i\nsaid wait a minute i said if you're\ndoing what you love\nif you never earned a dime\nyou're spending your days doing what you\nlove to do that's the trick of life\ni said your problem is you think you\nearn money by going to work you work to\nearn money you don't work to earn money\npeople earn the most money don't work at\nall\nyou earn money by providing service\nbut you gain satisfaction from doing\nwhat you love\nand there's two forms of income one\nsatisfaction the other is money\nit's a material thing\nbut i said if you're not getting\nsatisfaction of what you do you should\nquit it\nbecause they said\nthat's where it comes in that's why we\nshould figure out what we love to do\nand then dedicate our life to it\ni got into this business\ni had been studying it for quite a while\nand i had the opportunity already\nmentioned a visiting early night yale\n1966\nand i was leaving his office right at\nthe end and i said earl what is the big\ndeal in life\nwell he said there isn't any big deal\nbob he said\nit's simply a matter of sitting and\nfiguring what you love to do and\nthen dedicate your life to it so the\nproblem with most people is they never\nfigure out what they love to do well i'm\ntelling i could feel the hair going up\nin the back of my neck i knew exactly\nwhat i'd love to do i would love to do\nwhat he was doing i was and i wanted to\ndo it with him\ni had a very busy company at the time\nwe're operating canada the us and\nengland\nbut i knew that i was finished doing\nthat i was going to come back i was\ngoing to work with him two years later i\nwas his vice president of sales i wanted\nto do in the what he was doing being the\nbusiness he was in\nthat's where i made the decision and i\nlove it i love what i do\nnow\nthat's what people should be doing what\ndo i love to do then dedicate your life\nto it now you earn money by providing\nservice you can earn money while you're\nsleeping just figure out how to serve\npeople\nyou don't have to be there you don't\nhave to physically be there and do it\nyou can serve people while you're\nsleeping and get paid\nand that's how you're in money so you\ngot to learn how to earn money but that\nhas got nothing to do with\na life\nof living what you love that's the first\nplace so if i was telling anybody sit\ndown figure out what you love to do and\nthen made it make up your mind you're\ngoing to dedicate your life to it\nwhat stops most people what they love to\ndo they think you can't earn any money\nat it that doesn't matter\nforget about the money\nthat's another subject figure out how to\nearn it go talk to people and not earn\nmoney i know how to earn money i could\nteach people how to earn money but that\nis not the thing is to provide service\nso the most important thing what do i\nlove to do sit down what would i really\nlove to do how would i love to spend my\nlife\nthat's what we should do\nand unfortunately\nmost people never get involved in that\nexercise what is the first thing you do\nin the morning\n[Music]\nto start your day what is it that you do\nthat you feel starts your day because i\nfeel that\na lot of the times what i'm noticing\nespecially now in the culture we live in\nwhether it's reaching for our phone\nwhether it's looking at the news\nwe're starting our day\nwith energy that's already\nputting us in the wrong direction or\npushing us in the wrong direction\nwhat are you doing what are you\nencouraging people to do first thing in\nthe morning to start with this\nunderstanding that we are awareness to\nstart with this understanding that\nnegative feelings need to be embraced\nit's so amazing because the first thing\ni do now is i lay in bed and\nas awareness so i be\nawareness and i just lay there for a\nparticular amount of time\njust\nfeeling the joy and the freedom of the\neternal being that we are\nand uh and just lay in an awareness and\nso that's what i do absolutely every\nsingle morning and what's extraordinary\nnow i mean at the beginning\nit was like i felt like i had to\nremember to\nremember to do that but that doesn't\neven kind of make sense but i that's\nwhat i felt i felt like i had to\nremember to do it\nand now at the moment i open my eyes is\njust awareness just fills the room and\nthe joy just fills the room and so i lay\ni lay in that prior to that\ni would wake up every day in gratitude\nyeah yeah prior to that was gratitude\nwas and you know jay even now if life\ngets a bit\num bumpy or something happens just\nsomething\nnot\nreally negative but just\nsomething where everything isn't flowing\nthen i will just\nlook at gratitude and and through\nawareness just be so grateful\nfor\nthe fact that we are this infinite being\nand that\nno one dies i'm so grateful to be aware\nof this and to know this\nit's quite\nyou know it's that's also quite humbling\nthat somehow or another in this lifetime\nis that i had this awakening and\nrealization of this and um\nbecause as you say i agree with you 100\ni there is nothing greater than knowing\nwho you are there's nothing there will\nnever be anything greater than that a\nthousand years from now 10 000 years\nfrom now nothing will be greater than\nknowing who you are and being who you\nare and it's just step by step little\nstep by step and now's a really good\ntime because\nthe ego is being challenged the mind is\nbeing challenged it's being hit on all\nsides with with the disharmony and the\nand the disruption on the planet\nand so now is the best time ever\nto really like welcome those emotions\nand and to look toward\nto look in the direction of who who you\nare instead of who you are not\nyeah absolutely absolutely and and i\njust want to address because i feel like\nsomeone may be listening to us and\nthinking well well rhonda j how does\nthis help me\nbe successful be happy live the life i\nwant how does you know how does this\ncreate it and i just want to and i want\nto dive into what rhonda's going to have\nto say about this but i just want to\naddress it from\nfrom how i see it the understanding is\nvery simple that\nas ronda's saying we're not our body and\nif we think we're our body we will\nsurround ourselves\nwith things that are good for the body\nbut if we're not the body then none of\nthose things can actually satisfy us and\nan example that we'd always learn from\nthe vedic tradition was a fish out of\nwater that if you took a fish out of\nwater you could give it a mansion you\ncould give it a car you could give it\njewelry you could give it money but that\nfish will die because it's not in water\nit's not where it belongs and it isn't\nin its natural habitat and and so\nsimilarly\nunderstanding that we are awareness\ngives us the opportunity\nto do what is right for us as awareness\nto truly feed that awareness because\ni think the challenge that we think\nabout when we think about success or\nhappiness we think of success and\nhappiness\non the basis of the body and the mind\nand that's why even after accumulating\neverything we still feel dissatisfied\nbecause those things only touch the body\nand mind correct ronda correct correct\nand and and\nreally the best thing that could happen\nto everybody is that their greatest\ndream comes true\nbecause when your greatest dream comes\ntrue the dream that where you are\nabsolutely convinced that when this\ndream comes true that is when i will\nreally be happy\nthe best thing that can happen is that\ndream comes true because when it does\nyou will realize that there is something\nmissing and that happiness that you\nthought you would have\ndoesn't last and so\nit's\nyou know it's it's it's such a beautiful\nthing and for people who have been\nsuccessful then they get to that point\nand they're like they're not happy\nand they're not happy because\nthose things were never going to make\nyou happy in the first place anyway and\nso um but in terms of success\ni would say this\nthat\nwhen you are who you really are when\nyou're living from the place more of who\nyou are than who you are not\neverything that you need\nand want will fall into your hands\neffortlessly and you are actually the\ninfinite being is effortless\nand the way to kind of tell who's in\ncharge\nis whether it's the ego or the mind\nthat's in charge or or who you really\nare that is in charge in any moment is\neffort and if you're efforting if you\ncan feel this efforting then it's the\nego and the mind and if you're coming\nfrom a place of effortlessness where\nathletes call it being in the flow and\neverybody has these kind of descriptions\nit's where the mind has stopped and just\neverything is flowing you just feel like\neverything in the universe is just\ndancing your dance and singing to your\nsong\nand so in terms of success\nwhen you were being more of who you are\nthat idea that was going to make you\nsuccessful is what will come to you that\noriginal idea because the mind just\nrecycles that's all it can do it's a\nprogram and recycles and the ideas\nthat business kind of business ideas\nthat have never been on earth they are\ncoming from awareness they are coming\nfrom above the mine so when you are\nawareness that is when everything will\nfall into your hands everything that you\nneed and it just your whole life flows\nand you're just happy all of the time\nlike there is it's just like the\nuniverse is just saying and i even wrote\nin the sacred you know the shortcut to\nthe secret is be happy now\nright just be happy let go of all of the\nthings that that you're saying why you\ncan't be happy and just be happy now\nbecause when you're happy everything\njust everything just falls into place\nit's so amazing so\ndefinitely for success\nthat is the fastest fastest way to\nsuccess is to be who you are\nand um it's not you don't we're not\ntalking about going in a cave or you\nknow or doing anything like that we are\ntalking about living\nyour life in the incredible form and\nhuman being\nthat you are and having the experience\nthat you are\nbut from a place of knowing that you are\nthe infinite being that you are immortal\nand we are taught as jay said\nit's got to be through your experience\nit can't be through\noh i heard you know want to talk about\nthis and whatever no not interested in\nyou taking on another belief\nwhat what it is is for you to experience\nit and it is not hard for you to\nexperience it because it's who you are\nalready it's not anything that you have\nto go out and get in some ways it's\nalmost frustrating isn't it i remember\nwhen i started it out i'm like it's who\ni am already but at the time you know\nit'd be like i can tell the minds\nmind's taken over at the moment\nand yeah it's already who we are and so\nwe've just what we've done is we've\nattributed everything that is awareness\nto the mind we've given the mind the\nwhole thing\nand it's awareness that is hearing these\nwords right now\nthat is what's hearing these words\nright that is what he's seeing uh\nthrough these eyes it's awareness\nit's\nwithout awareness we wouldn't even know\nwe're alive exactly well that's that's\nthe thing rhonda that\nyou know i've i've heard a lot of people\nsay that when they first saw an autopsy\nor they went to\na funeral that's when they realized they\nweren't the body like that was when\nthey've if you've ever if you haven't\nseen an autopsy i recommend\neveryone finds a way to visit the\nhospital and see to see\nto see that allows us to disconnect from\nwe're not this physical body we get that\nbut i feel that for a lot of people like\nyou rightly said it's difficult to think\nwe're not the mind because\nlike you said we have\ngiven the mind all of awareness we think\nthat that is us so\nso i think a lot of people are getting\nto the understanding that we are not\nthis body i think i think people can get\nthere to some degree at least in their\nmind but then\na lot of us struggle to get behind well\nif i'm not the mind then then what else\nis there tell us about how you\nstart seeing the the\nthe\ntell us about how you start seeing\nthe fallibility of us thinking we're the\nmind so let's just investigate and look\nat the look at the mind and what the\nmind is and so it's really good for you\nto find out what the mind is especially\nconsidering that most of us have given a\ntotal authority over our life and we\nbelieve all of the thoughts that it\nproduces\nand which is the voice in your head and\nthe voice in your head is not who you\nare so that was a really big revelation\nfor me\nso so all that the mind is made of is\nthought\nbeginning to end full stop it's thought\nand so it's memory which is thought\nand it has images which is just thought\nin pictures but it's still thought and\nthe current thoughts that we think and\nso all that the mind is is made of\nthought and so without a single thought\nand check for yourself\nthe mind isn't there\nif there's no thought there's no mind\nand so\nwhen you begin to look at that and\ninvestigate that then it's really quite\ninteresting but then so so now we know\nthat the mind is just thought\nand therefore when a thought comes and a\nthought goes if we were\nour mind\nthen that means that when a thought\ncomes and when a thought goes a little\nbit of us would go with it\nand then when a thought comes and a\nthought goes a little bit more of us\nwould go with the thought if we were our\nmind a bit of us would be disappearing\nwith every single thought but if you\nlook at it guess what\nyou are there aware\nbefore a thought comes\nand you're there after it leaves\nso how can you be the mind and the other\nthing is\nwhat is aware of the thoughts in your\nhead\nawareness is aware of the thoughts in\nyour head because a thought is not aware\na thought has no awareness whatsoever\nand so the one that is aware of the\nthoughts is who you really are and so\nwhen you start to and just sort of sit\nwith this a little bit i'm not\nsuggesting that oh in this moment you're\nlike oh i know i'm not the mind but if\nyou just kind of\nsit with this and next time when you've\ngot a whole lot of thoughts coming\nthrough your head\nthat you remember this and\nand and think about it oh i was here\nbefore all of these thoughts and i am\nhere still here after they go fully\nintact none of me has disappeared and\nwhat was it that was aware because you\ncould you could even ask this question\nam i\nthe thoughts that i think or am i the\none that is aware of those thoughts\nwe never say\ni mind we say my mind or my body\nor we say my car because\nwe realize that we are not it right you\ndon't say i mind you you you know so\nit's\nit's so clear to us in our even our\nlanguage that it's my mind that means my\nmind belongs to something that is me\nand hence the question is who am i\nbecause it's my body and my mind and i\nthink\nwhat you just shared so beautifully is\nexactly that is that it is something\nthat is existing\nbeyond the purview of the mind and\nthought simply\nand for anyone who's wandering and\ntrying to intellectually wrap their head\naround this\nthe reason why it's so powerful\nto understand this\nis because then\nthe\nnegativities of the mind and the body\nstart to affect you less\nbecause you realize that they are not\nyou and that they are not your life\nuh and and that's the key that you know\nif anyone's wondering well how does this\nhelp me that's how it helps you is\nbecause you start to recognize\nthat\nwhat happens to the body just like if\nyour car has an accident\nyou may feel a little bit of pain but\nyou don't feel the same pain as when\nsomething affects your body directly\nand the car is a shell and so similarly\nyou start realizing that i'm a driver\ninside my body\nand my mind and so even though my body's\nhurt yes obviously i need to go to the\nhospital and take care of it of course\nbut that still isn't me no and um and\nyou know lester levinson who is in the\num who's no longer in physical form but\nwho's quoted in the greatest secret and\nhe would say that\nuh\nthat our mind is was is just being\ncreated for one reason and one reason\nonly and that is to create what we want\nthat's it full stop that's its job\nthat's its tool to create what we want\nin this life and what we want to\nexperience in in this life\nand that it's not our psychiatrist\npsychologist psychotherapist and tells\nus what to do and and believing our\nthoughts and hey jay i believe my\nthoughts for decades\nthis is just amazing that you would\nbelieve these thoughts in your head and\nand if if people just notice the next\ntime and i hope there's no next time but\nthat you feel agitated or negative\nemotional feel stressed it's because you\nwere believing a whole lot of negative\nthoughts\nthat's it you were just believing\nthoughts\nand and then that sends you you know\ninto\ninto negativity\nand so our freedom is the mind is\nwonderful a fantastic tool nothing wrong\nwith the mind the only problem comes\nwith the mind is when we think it is who\nwe are\nthat's the only problem and and you give\nthis analogy which i loved you talk\nabout how we're in this dream state uh\nand and there's a need for awakening\nfrom that\nbecause\nwhen you're\nasleep right when you're asleep and i\nthink a lot of people feel that i think\npeople right now feel an awakening in\ntheir life\nthat's coming tell us about the\nawakening you're speaking about i just\nthink you know when you've woken up i\njust\nknow\nwhen you've woken up because\num like if you're wondering all my sleep\nnow i've woken up\ni just when you wake up\nyou feel incredible\nyou feel so much lighter than you've\never felt you feel so much freer happier\nuh life just becomes miraculous\neverything is a miracle the little\nthings that that you just kind of\nignored before now are just things that\nwill bring you to your knees because the\nsheer beauty and love of those things\nlike sunsets and i remember in my life i\nwould hear people speak of these things\nand i remember i used to think oh you\nknow i just need to be able to pay my\nbills you know forget about sunsets and\nall that kind of thing you know but uh\nbut as you\nas you awaken\nit's it's uh\nit frees it just frees you from all of\nthe\nall of the limitations and all of the\nconditioning that we've all had in our\nlives no one's to blame for that it's\njust kind of part of the journey\nand you you just\nyou just become free the feeling is\nincredible and you and people can have\nlots of little awakenings can they not\nyou know along the way like a little\nand it's usually when you've seen\nthrough\nsome belief\nthat um you're like oh my gosh i used to\nbelieve that and that isn't true\nand then you just suddenly feel lighter\nand freer and so awakening is just a big\none of those it's just a huge sort of\nrealization it's it's like a wow moment\nbut instead it's a wow wow wow\neveryone can have it there isn't anybody\nthat is that that can't have it\neverybody can have it because it's who\nyou are\nalready what are some of the daily\nrituals that people can do to\nexperience what you're speaking about\nbecause as we both know it's not a\nit's it isn't a life hack or it isn't an\napp download or it isn't a\nyou know it it isn't it isn't a\nmechanical operational logistical\nread this three page you know it's not\nthat so what is it like how do we\nmake it more tangible for our tangible\nminds because our minds are wanting to\ndo something daily and repetitively\nbecause it is repetition there is\nrepetition what would you say we can do\ndaily well one of the things that that\nyou can do which which\nreally helps\ndisidentify with the body and the mind\nis to\nis to take\nso let me see so first of all take your\nbody\nand um and just\nput your body aside over there because\nyou are not the body so just like put\nthat aside for the moment that is not\nwho you are you you can pick up the body\nin in a minute or two but just put the\nbody aside\nand then\nput aside your name and the age and the\ndescription of you\nand also put it put it aside the story\nof who you think you are put all of that\naside so now the bodies aside the\nstories aside um all of those other\nthings are aside now what you're going\nto do\nis you're going to take the mind and\njust for a moment you're going to put\nthe mind aside and that includes all\nmemory\nand all thoughts and all feelings and\nyou're just going to put that aside as\nwell just pop that aside and now very\nquickly notice what is left\nbecause what is left is awareness\nand so that is one\nway\nthat's a really good way in the\nbeginning to come back to awareness\nand it's like i think in ancient\ntradition some of them spoke about it's\nlike peeling the onion right so instead\nof us\naccruing we all we think we have to pile\non all this knowledge and everything we\ngo go through life and you know i need\nto learn more and i need to accrue more\nand i need to get all of these degrees\nand all of that has its place but it's\nnever going to set you free\nand so peeling away what we are not\nand seeing awareness is what will set\nyou free and once you can get to the\nplace i mean honestly the way that i did\nit was and i i put it in the book and it\nwas three and it's three steps i would\nask myself multiple multiple multiple\ntimes in the day\nam i aware\nand the moment i would ask am i aware\nawareness would be there there would be\nthis awareness and then i would go about\nmy day and then i would ask again am i\naware so i did that constantly that's a\npractice to do constantly after a while\nactually really short amount of time\num days really\nuh or a week or two weeks\nwhen you go to ask am i aware you can't\neven ask the question\nbecause awareness is just completely\nthere immediately like immediately and\nso the second step\nis the first step transforms into the\nsecond step so you go from asking the\nquestion am i aware to automatically\nnoticing awareness so then lots of times\nin the day\nnotice awareness and then the third step\nis\nstay as awareness\nand the second step merges into the\nfirst step\nbecause when you notice awareness enough\nthen you're going to find that you are\nstaying as awareness more\nand so what happens is just so people\nunderstand\nwhat happens is the mind is kind of in\nthe potentially for many in the\nforeground at the moment and sort of\nrunning your life\nand um an awareness is so quietly\nbeautifully\nmagnificently\nquietly sitting in the background but\nwhen you ask the question when you\nnotice awareness stays awareness what\nhappens is there's a total shift and\nawareness comes to the foreground and\nthe mind goes to the background and that\nway you can use the mind whenever you\nneed to use the mind it's great to make\na date like for us\ndoing this podcast it's really great for\nthings like that but then you can stay\nas awareness and then your life is just\nabsolutely effortless and you just have\nincredible happiness and\nthat's that's where it all is there's a\nbeautiful picasso quote that literally\nsums up everything we're saying and he\nsaid that the uh\nthe meaning of life is to find your gift\nyeah and the purpose of life is to give\nit away\nit's so poetically beautiful but it's it\nalso makes so much sense right that when\nyou use your passion yep in the service\nof others it becomes a purpose right\nabsolutely and i feel yeah i wish that\nfor everyone listening watching right\nnow and for anyone else as well that\njust\nyou find your passion and then you use\nit for everyone else and that's my like\nclass past why like at the end of the\nday i think once i felt that i was like\nhow do i have the whole world feel this\nas much as possible\nbecause it's it's like you said it's\njust it's the only thing that matters\nand it's it's a gift to each person and\ni think if you're if every person is\nable to find that they're going to be\nyou know 10 times a better person to\neveryone else right because of\nknowing that this\nthis exact feeling can exist for them\ntotally totally and that's yeah i'm so\nyeah i've got some exciting stuff coming\nout next year that's\nkind of\ngiving everyone in my opinion the\nfundamentals of being able to find that\nfirst step i love that because finding\nout how to use it for other people\ncan become a scale question yep because\nyou can always use it for just your\nfriends and then you can scale it like\nyou have to the whole world right\nmillions of users etcetera\nbut but most people struggle at the\nfirst step of just like what am i what\nam i passionate what i love like yeah\nand that's what i want to help i want to\nhelp codify that for people do you have\nany tips or steps that you recommend to\npeople because you found you were so\nyoung and early and yeah you know but\nhave you ever thought about that i mean\ni think you know part of and it's sort\nof built into class past a bit of like\nthis idea of discovery like try new\nthings because you don't know\nuntil you've kind of gotten to that\nphase and we've talked about this a lot\nwhich is people are you have to go you\ngo through different phases right so\nyou're maybe in an explore phase and\nthen you might be in a build phase you\nmight be in a scale phase um and i think\nit's a like being able to go through it\nbut make sure making sure that you keep\nthings\nreally\num you keep you keep it fresh right and\nyou try new things i was actually just\nsaying this uh just the other day but\nlike when we're younger we're told to do\nso many different activities and as\nadults we somehow\nstop you know and you know i don't and i\njust don't believe in that because i\nthink you have to keep your\nmind and you know body all refreshed and\ni think when you when you're we talk\nabout like me being able to take a lot\nof decisions in my life to keep dreaming\nand to keep kind of shifting into\ndifferent places is because i i kind of\nforce myself to do that i never want to\nkind of get stuck in being like this is\nhow my life is defined and especially\ndefined by other people and so i think\nyou have to just keep it fresh but i\nthink the number one thing is like get\nout of your comfort zone yeah you know\nbecause i think you just don't realize\nit and then\nand then if you find something you know\nit's it's so a lot of it is also\nreflective time it's taking time by\nyourself which i think people sometimes\nstruggle with as well\nis have you like sat in a room with\nyourself for a while and spent a day\nwith just yourself what would you really\nwant to do yeah i think a lot of the\nanswers lie right there but it's hard\nfor people to do yeah i saw that post on\ninstagram that you did about play\nright i was reading an article where you\nsaid that\nand that actually really inspired me\nbecause i started looking back and i was\nlike why do i still play yeah like a\nchild and i have to admit this because\none of the plays that i remember playing\na lot was actually video\ngames i love video games well actually i\njust like playing football on like fifa\nit's a huge soccer game all over the\nworld and it's i've lit recently with my\nbusiness partner he loves it too we\nliterally have all of our business\nmeetings playing fifa that's so great\nand it's just because he's one person i\ncan get away with that with yeah it's\njust so fun and we do it for an hour a\nweek it's great play it's like mindless\nbut i you you reinspired that in me\nbecause i was like oh where do i play\nand i love playing sports as well so\nit's making more time to actually play\nsports and play\nand and i just feel like yeah you're so\nright and the funny thing is that when i\ndon't start taking dance classes or\nstart taking start learning an\ninstrument again both two things which i\nwould love to do\na lot of people are like oh my god\nyou're going through a midlife crisis\nyou know it's it's seen i feel like\nthere's a bit of a yeah not taboo but\nthere is a bit of a like\noh yeah what are you going through like\nis everything okay at home people like\nalso just don't think it's a priority\nlike right you know and it's like even\nfor saw like i think people will be like\noh you're like you dance on the side\nit's a hobby we were talking about this\nsome of the girls came over last night\nand one of the girls she has two kids\nokay and her her husband of all people\nbecause we were talking about like what\nto do with the show and um she was like\noh we might tour it et cetera and she\nwas like you know she was so surprised\nbecause the person who was like you\nshould do it was her husband of all\npeople right because she was expecting\nhim to be like why aren't you home like\nyou have to take and it was amazing\nbecause i think like what he realized\nwas like this isn't just a hobby like\nthis was something great and i think\nthat's kind of what i think people\nshould do is like and look at the other\nday if you don't prioritize it no one\nelse around you is going to prioritize\nit and this goes back to the goal\nsetting and why i do it is it's if it's\na priority to me it becomes a priority\nto everyone else in my life and if i'm\nnot willing to stand up for it no one\nelse is going to so i do not let anyone\nmake me feel bad for dancing right and\nwhen people are like i mean it's crazy\nto put on a show in the hours i mean we\ndance from like eight to 11 p.m at night\nyou know and everyone has other lives\nand other things\nthey all volunteer\nand you do it because\nyou're you know like it's a priority at\nthe end of the day and i think like that\nto me in a way like even when we design\nclass pass like i think about all the\nbehavioral mechanisms that are required\nto get somebody to say yes because by\nthe way there are a lot of things in our\nlives that\nmake it very easy to say no right from\nbeing busy to where all these things and\nand my whole thing is if i make it to\nserve it to you so easy maybe you'll\nactually try and say yes and i just feel\nlike the more we can do that in our\nlives and for for our friends for you\nknow people in our lives is help them\nfight through those challenges because\nwe need to keep these passions in our\nlives like i don't like when people are\nlike i used to be an athlete or i used\nto be an olympian like i meet people and\ni'm like what like this like because\nthere were that means you would you\nbuilt something for 20 years of your\nlife like some work ethic some sense of\npurpose and you wanted to let go of it\nand it's okay if you want to change for\na little bit but there is something in\nthere there's a reason you worked hard\nevery day to get to such an like a great\nlevel and it had to be driven by\nsomething deeper so what is that and how\ndo we make sure we replicate that\npurpose in your life again even though\nyou might have kids and have a job and\neverything else going on in your life\nyou still need to keep that in your life\nabsolutely by the way just whenever i'm\nlistening i don't make\nbig business decisions while playing\nfifa just just putting it out there like\nin case anyone was wrong sometimes like\ni don't know like being creative is\nsometimes one of the best times\nyou can think to think it's great yeah i\nmean i get what you're saying but like\nsometimes people like things connect in\nyour mind when you let your brain\nhave those moments you know whether it's\nin class or doing something creative\nlike you'd be surprised at how much you\nknow the rest of your\nrest of your mind is working and how\nmuch more you're efficient your brain\ncan actually become yeah yeah well\nespecially you were just saying that you\ntake a lot of your calls walking\nabsolutely no reason i'm sitting down\nright now yeah yeah yeah yeah we should\nhave done this we should have done it\nwould have struggled yeah exactly\nbut i i don't know i just think better\nlike i i run on the treadmill close to\nevery day and people are like why do you\nand i also obviously go to class but\nlike my treadmill time is like\nmeditation thinking time like i\nsolve problems and you know what like\ni'm off my phone but i like i'm working\nthrough stuff in my head i don't i don't\njust i can't run i'd be i would be like\ncompletely bored so i would you know\nit's all about thinking through really\nyou know things i have to get through in\nmy head and i i'm like you like i don't\nknow everything has to be thoughtful so\nit's like even if i'm thinking through\nlike getting a gift for somebody like i\nhave to like i'm not okay with like just\nbeing like oh here it's like and he just\nbet like even if it's like two minutes\nlike it needs the two minutes to think\nabout it yeah yeah absolutely but i love\nwhat\nyou did because obviously you built a\nhuge company\nand got married too\nbut you never left dance\nyeah like it because i i feel like when\nyou were building class pass\nit must have been so easy to make dance\nnot a priority yeah like it must have\nbeen so easy especially at the scale and\nacceleration yeah the focus it must be\nso easy and so many entrepreneurs say\nthat that they lost their health when\nthey were scaling a business so they\nlost their passion and now they're\nusing the money they've got now to go\nback to their passion et cetera yeah you\njust never let go there you know and i'm\nnot going to say it was perfect like\nthere was definitely times i struggled\nand it was um that being said i always\nremember\num\nbeing like well i'm gonna forget why i\nbuilt this company if i stop dancing\nright and i that's like part of why like\ni always fought to keep keep it in my\nlife and even actually like till this\nday and i always love this like my board\nmembers have all come and watched me\ndance like they will when they even\nintroduce me to someone like of course\nthey're always like me like our founder\nlike you know it's really it's exciting\nbut they'll always be like wait here's a\ndance video of her you know like they're\nproud of it too in a in in a really\nspecial way which makes me\nfeel because that's how people should be\ncelebrating these things right these are\ndifferent types of achievements and\naccomplishments that\nhuman beings have um\nbut at the end of the day like i would\nlose my why\nand it would and i i do remember there\nwere times where i stopped and it\nobviously my team would be like when was\nthe last time you danced like they would\nknow because my fire and every like\neverything that got me to like i said\nfight through the problems i needed to\nfight through came from\nalways reminding myself of why i started\nthe company which for me lied in dance\nyeah i love it it's\nthat's the best when you've done it\nthrough that yep and i will keep you\nknow like i think about you know like\nhaving kids or what all the all the\nthings in my life and i just always\nremember like you know every by the way\nevery show i have after i'm always like\nis that gonna be my last performance\nlike you always just kind of you know\nit's this it is really hard sometimes to\nwork through it you know\nbut i'm like no i'm gonna always do it\nand every time i do it i'm like\nlike this is the greatest feeling on\nearth like going back to that feeling of\neuphoria and i think a lot of people\nhave that in their life and even when\npeople like ask i'm sure people ask you\nthis all the time they ask me this like\nhow do i find my passion whatever it's\nlike when was the last time you felt\nanything close to that it's probably\nsomewhere in there yeah you know\nabsolutely and it's it's happened in\nyour life right it's like whether and it\nmight have been when you were six but\nlike when can you go back to that\nfeeling because it's probably tied to\nthat emotion yeah 100\nanyone's listening don't stop playing\nlike find your play like make time to\nplay it's a beautiful lesson from pyle\nit just it's\ni i think it's huge i genuinely think\nit's huge and i i remember for me\nactually before i started making content\nand i've been making content since i was\n18 which was never video based it was\njust spoken it was written\nit was speeches etc and i would just do\nit because i loved it i didn't get paid\nfor it yeah it didn't it didn't go\nanywhere i didn't i didn't have any\nfollowers i didn't have any views i was\njust doing it because i loved it i did\nit for at least three hours a day since\ni was 18. and so when i actually started\nmaking videos\nwhich was the first time i started\nputting into digital form the reason i\ndid that is because i was working a job\nyeah and\ni asked myself two questions and i don't\neven know where these came from but they\ncame from i think i used to listen to\nher and and this is real i used to\nlisten to the steve jobs stanford\ncommencement speech over and over again\nevery single day and it's literally only\nlike 15 minutes or whatever it is but i\nwould listen to it again and again and\nagain\nand there's so many parts in it where he\ntalks about don't be trapped by dogma\nright don't be defined by other people's\nopinions and those started becoming my\nvoice\nand then i remember asking myself these\ntwo questions one was what advice would\ni give to my younger self and the answer\nto that question was my younger self\nwould have never stopped creating\nbecause as a young person i was making i\nwas writing music i was writing songs i\nwas doing a lot of spoken word and rap\nand i was sad that i gave that up i gave\nthat up i gave up those words as a way\nof expressing or not that i gave up\nwriting actually i never gave up writing\nbut i gave up\nsharing myself yeah giving away\nthat right expression yeah totally and\nthe second thing i asked myself was like\nwhat will i regret on my deathbed like\nwhat will i regret when i'm 80 or 90\nwhatever age i live to and i was like i\nwould have regret that i just accepted\nthat to have a good life i had to\ncontinue having a corporate job and that\nwas it and so that was like those two\nquestions just forced me out of that\nyeah safety net that i was in yep\nand and that really like pushed me\nforward so anyone who's listening just\nknow that\ni mean pile's a huge inspiration i'm\njust showing my own little in my own\nlittle way but yeah you know it's\nit's not that it was easy for you and i\nthink i think a lot a lot of people may\nmay hear and just be like oh but you're\nreally smart and you've always been\nsmart and you found your passion it\nsounds like you know you're super well i\nthink that's like another important\npoint let's talk about that yeah that's\nfunny my husband always like brings this\nup you know he's always like like i've\nworked hard my entire life like i spend\nmy i spend i'm always working i'm always\nthinking i'm always trying to learn and\ni think in in and i think of play like i\nmean i kind of i was just talking about\nthis like\ni tried to get my work done as quickly\nas possible and like do it well and i\nwould at even at mit i'd be like pile\nyou have to get straight a's if you want\nto continue dancing i put that on myself\nokay and i say that in the sense of i\nfelt like i kept having to earn the\nright to play because\nlook i also believe like look like you\nneed to have a good head on your\nshoulders like to have to do a lot of\nthe stuff i even do now with the art and\nstuff and not be able to you know look\nyou need to know how to like\nyou have responsibilities pay your bills\nall those things like if you can't do\nthose things like\nyou your life might end up going in the\nwrong direction for other reasons and\nyou might not be able you know i love\nbeing able to say like pursue your\npassion but i can say that because i\ntook care of a lot of other things and\nno none of this was given to me my\nparents didn't come here with anything i\nhad to you know go through and do all my\ncollege applications apply to all the\njobs there was nothing ever handed to me\ni worked for everything in my life and i\nwill continue to even till this day\nright every opportunity\nbut i i think that's an important thing\nfor people to to know is that and it is\npossible like anyone no matter where you\nstart and come from can get there but\nyou have to work hard you need to like\ncontinue to learn you know be respectful\nand at the same time play right but like\ni said it's like i got my stuff done and\nthen i was like i'm allowed to play and\nthat's sort of how i kept living my life\nis like little by little i kept giving\nmyself more of play time because i felt\nlike i earned it if that makes sense and\nhonestly like i feel as an artist and\neven doing saw and all that right now\nlike it's an absolute privilege for me\nand i say that because i'm like i feel\nlike i've earned this ability to do it\nbut it was through hard work a lot of\nhard work and\nthat's you know and still like to do\nanything in your life or and if i even\nwant to do something new or try to i\nknow i'm gonna have to do the same exact\ni know the formula and the process to go\nthrough but it always starts with hard\nwork yeah and i'm so glad you raised\nthat point because i think it's so easy\nand right now the rhetoric is very much\nfollow your passion and be an\nentrepreneur and break out and that is\nall good advice and it's sound but\nthe realistic pragmatic sense right just\nhey if you don't understand how to run\nyour business yeah you can chase your\npassion as much as you want but right\nyou're not gonna be able to do it long\nterm or if you don't figure out this\nstrategic element no matter how sincere\nyou are and how incredible your work is\nyeah absolutely and i feel like i'm\nreally glad you raised that it's like\nhaving the toolkit a little of like you\nknow and i i think you know i always\nthink about like what did i learn in my\nlife that got me here they're like\nactual tangible things\nyeah i mean and i've been like just like\nthinking a little bit about it and i\nthink it does come from like surrounding\nyourself with great people\nyou know like getting a good education\nrespecting others like i think it's like\nputting yourself like good work out\nthere all those things are all\na part of it and then like this idea of\npassion leading a passionate life like\nlike i said i think i had to keep\nchipping at it like it right like i\nstarted in kind of the opposite side\nvery similar to you did and we just kind\nof had to keep chipping\nto make it a bigger part of our life and\nat the same time like i don't know if it\nwas ever like i don't know you know\npeople always like are like well do you\nfeel like you should have started your\ncompany right after college like no i\ndon't regret any of my time in corporate\namerica or doing you know working at in\nconsulting yeah it's because i think it\ntaught me a lot too and i was while i\nwas there i would did a good job and i\nlearned a lot while i was there like\ntake every opportunity that comes in\nfront of you\nyou know that you're doing for a reason\nand do it well at least right or don't\ndo it at all yeah and and learn the fact\nthat i mean i know that the time i spend\nat accenture\ni learned so much right and i look back\nand i'm like i learned so many things\nabout the future of ai and vr and ar and\nthen i focus so much on business and\nsales and negotiation and just just even\nbasic things like turning up on time to\nmeetings right and and yeah and\ncoming prepared right and being ready to\nhaving to work till midnight if you had\nto all those sorts of things which i\nthink are undervalued because it doesn't\nfeel what you're passionate about right\nand even though i wasn't waking up doing\nwhat i was passionate about every day\nit was exactly what i needed to be able\nto do what i do now absolutely yeah yeah\nthat's a really powerful message i'm\nglad that i'm glad that you shared that\nbecause it's it's often missed okay i\nwant to talk about one more thing before\nwe end with our final five questions\nokay it was you've talked about your\npassion for art we're also very\npassionate about women and women in\nbusiness\nand that's something you're a big\nadvocate and ambassador for let's yeah\nlet's open that up well you know i think\nuh so much of the world spend is by\nwomen right like women are like the\nlargest purchasers and and i say that in\nthe sense of i think of\nthe potential of the solutions we still\nneed for\nthings that women you know problems that\nwomen have in the world and there's a\nlot and i say that in the sense of you\ncan really only really solve problems\nand going back to what i think\nentrepreneurship is is stuff you've\nfaced in our really passionate basically\nmen are creating the products that women\nend up buying sometimes that happens and\ni think that has been a problem um and i\nthink like that to me is a huge\nopportunity right of of like what women\ncan build out there and i i see that and\ni think that's why there's so much\npotential of what we can all do\num you know the other thing i would say\nis\ni think everything in in our lives that\nmakes us unique whether it is our gender\nwhether it's our height\num being 411 um you know tiny but mighty\ntiny but\num\nyou know or you know i don't know i just\nfeel like in every situation\nyou can walk in and people there's this\nidea of either people are looking at me\nwith doubts or they're looking at me\nthinking i'm incredible and it's up to\nyou to walk into the room and believe\nwhichever one and by the way like the\nmore you walk in being like i'm\nincredible\nright and whatever however you have to\nset yourself up to walk in the room and\nbelieve you're on that that side of it i\njust believe it's you're going to\nbe able to accomplish more you're going\nto just be more confident you know it's\nit's one of those it's like actually a\nself-belief thing and i i really want\nwomen to know like they're not at a\ndisadvantage like i really don't i've\nnever felt like i was at a disadvantage\nand i say that in the sense of from uh i\nyou know once again my mom taught me\nlike if you want to accomplish something\nin your life you go and do it and of\ncourse like there's some stats like we\nstill need to fix like we need we need\nmore women and giving money like there's\nthese things that we definitely need to\nshift in the world absolutely but at the\nend of the day i want like i want women\nto know that they're incredibly\nexceptional and they're going to build\nthe next like billion dollar companies\nbecause there's billion dollar problems\nthat we need to solve for women yeah\nabsolutely self-belief is not that\neveryone will like me but self-belief is\ni'll be okay if they don't yeah because\ni've i've learned to walk in with that\npresence myself it's a great way to put\nit yeah i feel like that with if i ever\nhad a daughter like i think about it\nthrough that that's the closest i can\nconnect with the challenge on the other\nside and i'm right if i ever had a\ndaughter i'd want her to be able to\ndream yeah of being a founder if that's\nwhat she wanted to do right because she\nsees role models in that sense right and\ni wanted to dream of being an athlete or\nwhatever she wants to be yeah because\nshe sees female role models seeing other\npeople who've done it who look like her\nyeah who who act like her who think like\nwho came from the same sorts of\nbackgrounds absolutely\ni think and i think what's great right\nnow and i see it all the time is women\nsharing\nhow they got there and like their entire\nlife like when i started consulting and\ni would meet some female partners i\ndidn't know anything about their life\nlike i'm like are you know are you\nmarried are you not not saying everyone\nwants wants that but i'm like are you\ngonna like is that the life i want are\nyou happy like any of those things like\ndo you have anything else going on in\nyour life how do you play any and i\ncouldn't see that and i think what's\nreally amazing and i think like\ninstagram's been great for this or and\neven i do this like at work it's like\nsharing more of my life you know with\npeople is important so they realize like\nyeah like be you know be kick-ass in all\nthat you do but you can also be like a\nhuman being and have a family and all\nthose things which i think wasn't always\nsomething that we saw yeah absolutely\nawesome so my final five okay the final\nfive minutes five questions\nquick quick questions that i love asking\nso\nyour number one\na number one entrepreneur dance\ncollaboration like if you could\nif you could do a dance collaboration\nwith any other entrepreneur what would\nit who would it be\num well i wanna dance with beyonce and\njlo i'm like i'm just gonna say they're\nentrepreneurs they're both entrepreneurs\nyeah exactly\nyeah okay yes they are totally there we\ngo we're putting it out to the universe\ni love it there's gonna be a\ncollaboration one day exactly i love it\nuh how do you play apart from dance\nhow do i play a part from dance yeah or\ndoes there need to be another one is\ndance enough no i mean i think you know\nfor me going to class is a huge thing i\nalso like i\ni love movies like i love going to see\nmovies i know we've gone to see movies\ntogether all the time like i don't know\ni love seeing like other people's\ncreativity like that's a great way i\nplay is like you know whether it's going\nto see shows whatever i love being\ninspired by other people that's a great\nanswer we saw a star is born releasing\nyes so good so good you share this\nbeautiful thought around how\nyou know what keeps us from the greatest\nsecret is a belief\nand\ni really liked how\ndespite the incredible success of the\nsecret\nyou've continued on this\njourney\nto continually seek\nfor a deeper secret and the greatest\nsecret as you call it\nand you say that a belief has been\nblocking us this whole time from this\nsecret\ntell us about this belief\nwhere does this\nblock of a belief come from\nand how has it created such a strong\nhold on each and every single one of us\nwell the belief is that we are separate\nand that we are individual\nand that all\nthat we consist of all that makes us up\nis just a body and a mind and i think\nthe majority of people will consider\nthat they're a body and a mind\nand the name that they've been given\nand the story uh of their life and i was\nborn here and parents did this and i do\nthis for a living and siblings and the\nstory that we then ca we identify with\nand carry around with us and and\nand those stories this story it doesn't\nmatter what the story is it doesn't\nmatter how fabulous your life has been\nit does not compare to who we really are\nand so we have this belief that we are\nlimited\nbasically in a nutshell that we're a\nlimited individual that we're born and\nthat we die\nand and that's kind of it and the truth\nis we're we are so much more than that\nwe are certainly having the experience\nof being an individual and we're\ncertainly having the experience having a\nhuman experience but ultimately it is\nnot who we are and we were never born\nand we never die\nand\nwe are\nif i were to sum up everything that we\nare it's almost the opposite to\neverything we strive to be\nso we are all the intelligence that\nthere is we are all the beauty that\nthere is where all the happiness that\nthere is we are pure love without any\njudgment whatsoever\num\nwe are complete and utter freedom\nwhich is why freedom means so much to us\nwhy we will fight and struggle to be\nfree\nuh and so we and and we have total\nknowing of absolutely everything in the\nmoment of knowing it we are infinite and\nwe are eternal\nand that is what is actually\nexperiencing\nthis\nparticular form and so we have a belief\nthat we are an individual that we're\nseparate that we're born and that we die\nand\nour mind reaffirms that over and over\nand over again through all of its\nthoughts and with everything we say with\nevery thought and every single thing\nthat we say and actually doesn't the\nworld affirm that over and over that was\nthat we're separate\num but\nwe are unlimited\nwe are absolute perfection\nand and i'm not talking about the name\nor the ego i'm not talking about that\nbecause we we all can see what egos can\nget up to you know they can get\nthey can cause a lot of trouble\negos what egos want approval they want\nattention and they want to be right all\nthe time they judge all of the time and\nso you know they're not they're not\nsomething to to attach ourselves to and\nto identify with when we are this\nincredible being that is blissful\nhappiness\nand so\num\nand so we can\nhave a life\nwhere we are a living as an individual\nhuman having an individual human\nexperience\nbut from the perspective of the infinite\nbeing that we are\nin which case we will never be touched\nby negativity no matter what happens and\nwe will remain in lasting happiness no\nmatter what\nand\nit is and this has been my journey\nreally from the secret to\nto\nnow um and i was searching seven days a\nweek i was jay i'm just like i was just\nlike one of those crazy people\ni'm like if this there is this law that\ngoverns our mind then there is\ndefinitely way way more to discover and\nso i just searched and searched for\nreligions and spiritual traditions and\nread thousands of books and it wasn't\nuntil 2016\nthat i had this experience where i\nrealized who we are and i was like\nwhy haven't i seen this why wouldn't i\nwhat is it how could i have missed this\nand uh and from that moment of realizing\nthat there was this happiness\nthat arose inside of me and then with\neverything that i did from 216\nto 220\nthat happiness just became deeper and\ndeeper and and then i would just notice\nthings like\nthat person\nyou know when they would do something or\nother they used to bother me a lot that\ndidn't bother me anymore and how was i\never bothered by that and that\nparticular subject doesn't bother me\nanymore and so i was just finding that i\nwasn't reacting to life\nmy the reactions were all dissolving i\ndidn't judgment was dissolving i was\njust whatever was happening i'm like\nit's fine it'll be okay\nand and so\nwith letting go of all of those things\nincluding the belief that we're a\nlimited being\num\nwe become free really truly free and\nthen we will live a life that's\ndescribed as heaven on earth or nirvana\na life where we know we don't die\nand the body ends sure\nbut but who we are does not and so yeah\nthat's been\nthat's been my journey that's really my\njourney well it's beautiful hearing it\nbecause\ni was very fortunate enough to\nat least learn about that intellectually\nwhen i was 18 and i first\nmet the monks that i lived with\nand then\nwhen i went and lived as a monk for\nthree years in india\nand across europe when i was 22 to 25\nthe texts that we studied\nwhether it was the vedas or the gita\nintroduced me to that at least\nintellectually\nand i say at least intellectually\nbecause i believe that a lot of these\nideas begin intellect before they truly\nbecome realized yeah you're absolutely\nright and um and i think in 216 you know\nit was it was and\nit was a realization of who i am but had\ni was i completely living that no i\nremember thinking oh my gosh i've lost\nit\nnow you know\ni i had it and now i've lost it and of\ncourse you can't lose it because it's\nwho you are\nyou know\nbut but you've got to go you've kind of\ngot to go on this\na bit of a journey you don't have to\nthere are some people that\noh gosh they will just hear it and\nthat's it they will leave it they will\nlive like that for the rest of their\nlife yeah and they they just enjoy and\ni've had some letters from\nfrom some people that that has happened\nto you\nfor me it was more of a journey and uh\nbut oh wow when you just\nin it definitely intellectually\nis the beginning and there's nothing\nwrong with that at all\nbecause that's where right that's where\nyou start\nand then and then it's sort of the\ndiligence to keep\nnoticing um who you are noticing\nawareness you know noticing\nuh asking yourself am i aware is you\nknow one\none way one way to begin am i aware and\neven in secret i talk about that you\nknow remember to remember that you're\naware and to be aware\nand so it you just keep coming back to\nnoticing who you are it's so interesting\nbecause when you notice who you are you\nfeel this absolute relief\ntravel all through your body\nwhich means prior to that you were tense\nyou were holding on to life you know the\nkind of white knuckle and everything\nand so um\ni mean i just oh my gosh it's just like\nthis incredible thing that we\nthat we have and and then you know and\nthen you look out and you see people\nsuffering and um\nand that part's you know really\nchallenging because you you you want to\nhelp everybody and so so that they don't\nsuffer anymore and um\ni i remember with my tea i remember with\nmy teacher really early on\nand i would be like oh i've lost and\ni've lost it\nand why don't i have it all of the time\nand she said she would say oh because\nyou haven't suffered enough\nis what you say to me\nyou need to suffer some more you know\nand then and then you really really\nreally it's going to mean more to you\nthan anything else in in life and uh\nyeah it's a it's it's a wonderful thing\nbut oh my gosh in your 20s jay heaven i\nremember learning that definition which\nyou described so beautifully of\nsachitananda\nand the idea that we are full of\nknowledge eternal and full of bliss\nand i remember one of the ways we were\ntrained to understand that is we had no\nmirrors in the ashram\nand without a mirror you lost conception\nof your physical self because you no\nlonger could check how you looked\nand\nthe other one was i remember when i\nfirst started i would and i know you\nused the beautiful word awareness\nin the greatest secret i remember i used\nto write on a little post-it note when\ni'd wake up in the morning i'd have it\nnext to my bedside table and then on the\nuh by the place where i brush my teeth\nthat i am awareness\nyeah to remind myself to remind myself\nin the morning to wake up with the\nunderstanding that i'm not this body oh\nbrilliant that is brilliant people\nshould do that\npeople should do that i mean that is\nabsolutely fantastic yeah i am awareness\nbecause the moment that you say like our\nmind can't comprehend awareness it can't\nit can't comprehend it the mind is\nsitting in awareness and so\nand so the really beautiful thing is is\nthat saying something like i am\nawareness or am i aware\nthe mind just goes quiet you know just\nreally quickly and one when the mind's\nquiet then all that there is is\nawareness or consciousness or whatever\nthe word doesn't matter you know i tried\nto choose the word that i felt was the\nsimplest that people could kind of\nunderstand\nbut\nthe moment the mind drops there there is\nawareness and so\nand so ah i love that i am aware i love\nit\noh thank you yeah it was i you know it's\nthat's why when i was reading your book\nand i hope you can tell like when i was\nreading your book i felt so happy\nbecause\nwhen you were sharing this was the\ngreatest secret i i couldn't agree with\nyou more\ni i don't think there is is a deeper\nsecret at the beginning of knowledge and\nwe were always we were always told that\nthis is the first lesson you'll learn\nand and the one that will take your\nwhole life to live like to actually\npractice\nuh\nand and and and so when i was reading\nthe book i was just it was so beautiful\nfor me because\ni i could totally see\nhow much you care\nfor people and and for what journey you\nwant them to take but isn't it\nfascinating that\nwe almost and you said something really\nbeautiful and you talk about in the book\nabout how\nactually we are\nfree and we have complete freedom\nbut we limit ourselves but isn't it\nfascinating that we think\nthat the body and mind keep us safe so\nlike the very things that are actually\nkeeping us imprisoned we think that they\nare our safety totally\nand don't you think you know also with\nwhat's happened in the last year\nthat\nthat we had this idea or or or most\npeople have this idea that they work\nreally really hard\nto get safety and security you know to\naccrue things and to have money in the\nbank and to have a house and all of\nthose\nall of those things to have safety and\nsecurity and this world event that came\nalong shook that and actually showed\neverybody\nwhat is the truth\nand that is that we will never find\nsafety and security in the world and the\nreason we won't is it's always changing\nalways changing\nbut\nwe are the only\nsafety and security in existence\nwe're trying to get on the outside what\nwe are on the inside and that is not to\nsay to\nto enjoy this incredible world i mean\nthis is a miracle this is miraculous\nthis this experience of this world and\nit is here for us to enjoy in every way\nthat each person wants to enjoy it\nbut to know who we are\nto to instead of\nspending our whole life\ntrying to\nfill ourselves from the outside world\nwhich will never\never work is to spend just\na little bit of time\non the inside like waking up to i am\nawareness and\nor asking am i aware and\none of the things that i found that was\nreally fantastic and there's so many\nincredible practices and i'm sure oh my\ngosh you would have done so many\nfabulous ones i would love to hear about\nthat\num one of the things that all of the\nthings in the greatest secret all of the\nthings that i did\nand the teachers that are in the\ngreatest secret\nwere my journey all of them from the\nsecret through to now every single one\nof them changed my life in in one way or\nanother some i followed for a couple of\nyears and\num and some for a month and but all of\nthose teachers played a really really\nbig part in my life\nand so\nthe practice in the greatest secret\nthat had the greatest effect on me and\nthat i would say for anybody\nis the best thing you can ever ever ever\ndo and that is to never resist negative\nemotions and instead to do the exact\nopposite\nwhich is what we have not been told to\ndo\nwhich is the opposite to resistance is\nto welcome so resist is push away and\nwelcome is to pull in\nembrace yeah embrace exactly exactly and\nto embrace those negative emotions\nbecause the most incredible thing\nhappens when we do embrace them when we\nallow them to be there when we don't try\nand change them when we don't try and\nwhen we don't want to make them go or or\nor do anything but just allow them to be\nthere\nthey just evaporate\nthey just evaporate and the more that\nyou do it the faster they evaporate\nbecause when i started i would feel a\nstrong emotion and it would maybe last\n30 seconds 45 seconds or something like\nthat and then gradually gradually ever\nway\nbut the more that i welcome the weaker\nthey get each time you welcome a\nnegative emotion just gets weaker weaker\nweaker weaker until\nyou don't have a trace of that negative\nemotion in the body at all anymore and\nwhen you don't have a trace of it you're\nnever going to feel it explain to us as\nyou do in the book what does it mean to\ntruly\nembrace and welcome a negative feeling\nwhat does that mean in practice because\ni i couldn't agree with you more and\njust to help people as they're listening\nand watching the thinking you know what\ni just right now i'm just there's so\nmuch negativity in the world i'm\nwatching the news i'm stressed out about\nthis my kids are at home i'm having to\nhomeschool\nhow do they welcome that and and i agree\nwith you we resist completely we don't\nwant to feel negative we don't want to\nbecause it's not pleasant you know\nfeeling negative feelings so\nand so when you\nwhen you feel a negative feeling arises\nin you notice the feeling don't focus\ninto the feeling because if you focus\ninto it you'll just make it stronger the\nmind is really powerful so don't focus\ninto it but notice the feeling and so\nand just welcome it so it's almost like\nyou could imagine just putting your arms\nout like this our arms out to the side\nof you\nand just allowing the feeling which is\nsimply energy that's all it is even fear\nit's just energy and just allowing it to\npass on through\none thing that i did was i\nwould\nimagine putting my arms around and\nembracing the feeling and\nand pulling the feeling in close to me\nand i just found that that was amazing\nfor me i think people can try all kinds\nof different things like i just imagine\nthat that feeling was one of my oldest\ndearest friends\nthat i loved so much that i hadn't seen\nin decades and they arrived at my door\nand i was just like could not get my\narms around them fast enough\nand that is what i imagined with each of\nthe feelings and i mean at one point in\nmy life i did that with depression\nand so i wrapped and that's really how i\nlearned how powerful this practice is\nbecause uh when i\nwrapped my arms around the depression it\njust dissolved\nand her and the relief\ni mean the relief that you feel when the\nnegative feeling dissolves it's so good\nit's worth every\nit's like a high and the heart and the\nreason it's like a high is because when\nyou dissolve the feeling there's you\nunderneath\nand who you really are and so you get a\nflash\nof who you really are this kind of joy\nand happiness\nand so yeah that's what i did i would\nembrace the feeling and\nhold it in without focusing on it notice\nit but don't focus into the feeling\nand and just let it dissolve and i\npromise the next time you feel that\nfeeling it will never be as strong when\nyou do it and so you do the same thing\nthe next time that feeling arises\nand then the time after that it's going\nto be weaker it just gets weaker and\nweaker and weaker until you get to a\npoint where you're like i can't remember\nthe last time that i got angry\ni just can't remember when did i ever\nget angry\nyou know you're just or agitated or\nimpatient or and so you do it with every\nfeeling so\nso my to give people a really good guide\ni would say\nthat unless you're feeling\nreally happy joyously happy\nwelling up inside of you you have a\nnegative feeling\npretty good you don't need to know what\nthe name of it is to welcome it you just\nwelcome you it doesn't matter about its\nname doesn't matter what it is just\nwelcome the feeling or embrace the\nfeeling or allow the feeling to be there\nand then you will begin to\ndissolve these negative feelings that\nare actually masking who you are the\nmore you dissolve them the greater the\nhappiness the rises within you\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo\nif you enjoyed it here's another one i\nthink you'll love you'll get to where\nyou want in life just not in the way you\nimagined\nand that's because\nthe path that's paved up and down\nis far different to the path we paid"
