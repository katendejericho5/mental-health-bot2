welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten\nlearn and grow\nnow you know that i'm always on the\nlookout to go and find the incredible\nthinkers thought leaders authors writers\nstorytellers that i believe have\ninspired my life and can inspire yours\nas well now the person i'm going to\ninterview today i actually read his book\nback in 2013. so it's been quite a while\nbut this book had such a lasting impact\non me and i was just sharing with him\nthat the reason i love on purpose in our\ncommunity is i get the excuse to reach\nout to some of the people that i admire\nand feel inspired by so that i can help\nthem share their work and their story\nand their insights that i know will\ntransform your life today's guest is\nnone other than charles duhigg\njournalist and new york times\nbest-selling author he wrote the power\nof habit and smarter faster better which\ntalk about productivity habits and the\nscience behind it he joined the new york\ntimes as a staff writer in 2006 and was\npart of the team that won the 2013\npulitzer prize in explanatory journalism\nfor the ieconomy a series that examined\nthe global economy through the lens of\napple now today's session is going to be\nall about habits understanding ourselves\nimproving our productivity and our\neffectiveness welcome to on purpose\ncharles duhigg charles thank you so much\nfor doing this i'm such a fan your books\nare incredibly powerful and i'm just\nreally grateful that we get to have this\nconversation well thanks for having me\njay i i feel very similarly i've loved\nyour book and and loved the the show so\nreally thank you for having me on no\nabsolutely let's let's dive straight in\nyou know what i'm\nreally fascinated to know\nis\nnot just about the incredible work and\nresearch you've done but how you became\nfascinated by it you've written a lot\nabout productivity smarter better faster\nhabits how did you get fascinated with\nthose things in the first place and\nwhere was your journey to become\nattracted to human behavior well there\nwas sort of these two experiences the\nfirst one was that um\nyou know when i first came up with the\nidea for the power of habit got\ninterested in it my wife was about and i\nwere about to have our first kid\nand and i had this\nthis thing that was going on where i\nwould think to myself like you know at\nthat point i was a reporter at the new\nyork times and\nfelt like i was somewhat successful i\nhad gone to business school and you know\nand and i started a company and\nand i thought to myself like if i'm so\nsmart like why is it so hard for me to\ngo running in the morning because i\nwould always say like i'm gonna go\njogging tomorrow and then not do it\nright and then my son was born and like\nyou know after six or seven months they\nthey start eating this like um\na little bit older they start eating\nthese like little chicken nuggets and\ni'd be sitting at the dinner table with\nhim and and like without thinking about\nit i'd just reach over and grab one of\nhis chicken nuggets and eat it even\nthough i wasn't hungry right it was just\nlike automatic\nand so i was trying to figure out like\nif i'm so smart why is it so hard for me\nto do the things that i want to do like\nwhy is it so hard to form the habits\nthat i think are healthy for me and then\ni also had this experience which is\ni had been a reporter in iraq during the\nduring the war\nand i met this army major who who\nexplained to me that the way that the\nmilitary works and this is true of all\nmilitaries is that it's basically a\ngiant habit change machine right like\nlike your instinct when you're getting\nshot at is to run the other direction\nbecause that's smart but the military\nteaches you these habits to shoot back\nor or now when you're overseas you can\nemail or call your spouse every night\nand so if they don't teach you good\nhabit\nthe communication habits you get\ndistracted and so when you're on patrol\nyou can't do your job as well and you're\nin danger\nand he explained to me that the way that\nthey teach habits is very formulaic that\nthey break a habit into these three\ncomponents and they teach you how to\nthink about them\nand as i learned that i thought to\nmyself like there's a real science here\nand i want to understand that science\nand so i decided to write a book about\nit in part just because it would help me\nfigure it out one of the things i find\nthat you said that's really fascinating\nand i'm so glad i asked you that\nquestion is because when i'm listening\nto you i think a lot of people can\nempathize with that you feel like you're\na smart organized thoughtful individual\nbut then you're like but why can't i get\nmy life together why can't i do basic\nthings and we often yeah and we often\nget really critical of ourselves and\njudgmental of ourselves and make\nourselves feel guilty for not having it\ntogether can you tell tell us a bit\nabout that because i think one of the\neasiest things to feel right now\nwhen you were saying those things i'm\nsure everyone's listening going charles\ni do the same thing i i say i'm gonna\nwork out tomorrow and i don't i reach\nover for the carby\nyou know fatty calorie-based food\ninstead of something that i know that's\nhealthy and natural for me but then we\njudge ourselves talk to us a bit about\njudgment and guilt and criticism\nit's a great question right because\nyou're exactly right our instinct\nparticularly like america the uk all\nthese all these kind of like\nyou know what we consider ourselves to\nbe developed nations we we are\nmasochists we love punishing ourselves\nright we have we have lifestyles that\nare designed to push us to work harder\nand faster and to understand why that's\ndamaging you first of all has to have to\nunderstand how habits work so we think\nof habits as one thing but every habit\nis actually three things right there's a\nthere's a cue which is like a trigger\nfor an automatic behavior to start and\nthen the routine which is the behavior\nitself that's what we think of as the\nhabit and then finally a reward and\nthere's a part of your brain known as\nthe basal ganglia that looks for those\nrewards and tries to make any pattern\ninto a habit so it'll take cues routines\nand rewards and put them together in a\nlittle chunk because of that reward\nit'll say i want to make that behavior\neasier and easier and easier so so\nexercise is a great example right\nwe know from studies that when people\nhave an obvious cue like they put their\nrunning shoes next to their bed and\nso they see them first thing in the\nmorning or they they\nplan on meeting their friend at the gym\nevery wednesday night that they're more\nlikely to exercise but what really makes\nthat exercise into a habit is if they\ngive themselves a reward afterwards so\ndo they give themselves like a nice long\nshower or do they give themselves like a\nsmoothie do they just have a calendar\nthat they mark off all the times that\nthey've exercised are they rewarding\nthemselves somehow if you're rewarding\nyourself somehow and you have that cue\nthen it becomes easier and easier to do\nthe behavior to exercise to to make the\nhabit become real\nbut you bring up the fact that we always\nlike are blaming ourselves right we're\nalways feeling guilty\nso think about how most people start\nexercising they wake up in the morning\nthey don't have a cue right they have to\ngo search through their closet to find\ntheir running shoes\nand then they go out and maybe they run\nand they feel like they look really dumb\nthey don't know what they're doing\nthey're not sure what route they're\ngoing to take they they think oh i'll\nrun seven blocks and after three blocks\nthey can hardly even breathe so they\ngive up then they come home and now\nnow they're running late right so they\nlike jump in the shower as fast as they\ncan they like rush the kids through\nbreakfast they throw the kids in the car\nthey take the kids to school the kids\nare two minutes late for school then\nthey rush to their desk and they're\nalready 10 or 15 minutes late for their\nday and they've sit down and they've got\nsweat streaming in other words all these\npeople who start exercising they've\npunished themselves for exercising right\nand and your brain it notices rewards\nand punishments if if your brain notices\nthat when you go running in the morning\nthe rest of the day is a nightmare\nyour brain says this is a terrible idea\ni don't want to make exercise any easier\nand and so that's what's important is\nthat first of all knowing how our habits\nwork but second of all to the point that\nyou raised\nwhen we blame ourselves when we punish\nourselves when we feel guilty what we're\nactually doing is we're making it harder\nto form habits\nbecause our brain pays attention to that\nnegativity\nwhat we need to do is we need to find\nthe rewards we need to allow ourselves\nto indulge in the rewards to enjoy those\nrewards\nbecause that's how your brain will latch\nonto something and say i want to make\nthis easier and easier and easier to do\ncharles this is why i love you and this\nis where everyone should read your book\nbecause everything you say is just so\nmethodical\nrelatable practical genuinely i'm i'm\nloving this conversation already because\ni can totally understand that anyone\nwho's listening or watching right now\nthey're thinking yes that's exactly what\ni'm doing that's exactly what i'm going\nthrough that's exactly what i'm\nexperiencing i want to take a bit of a\nquick tangent on this because i i like\nthat you said\nthat you thought about this before you\nhad kids and what's really fascinating\nto me at least\nis\na lot of people\ndon't really start thinking about their\nhabits until after they have kids\nbecause up until before that we're just\nkind of living and maybe you don't need\nto be as disciplined maybe you don't\nneed to be as organized i don't have\nchildren yet and so i live a highly\ndisciplined high performance productive\neffective lifestyle and what my friends\nwill always say to me is jay wait till\nyou have kids right like i hear that all\nthe time\nand my take is i don't have kids and so\ni completely understand that i have no\nwisdom whatsoever on what it means to be\na parent and try to live a mindful\nlifestyle and i don't claim to know\nanything about that all i know is that\ni'm trying my best right now to use my\ntime really wisely i wanted to hear from\nyou\nwhen you started work on your habits\nbefore and after\nhow does how does having children affect\nthat and which were habits that you held\non to and that have been useful and\nwhich were habits that you had to be\nokay with giving up because i think\nsometimes again as parents i hear a lot\nof parents judging themselves and saying\noh i'm not doing this i'm not doing that\nbut then we forget that of course not\nyou have a whole another human or two\nhumans or more to take care of walk us\nthrough that a little bit just as a\ntangent\nwell i think that there's this um action\nwhich i think is true which is that you\nknow if you're a good employee and then\nyou become a parent you will never ever\nbe a good employee or a good parent at\nthe same time for the rest of your life\nright like part of being a parent is\ngetting at peace with the fact that that\nyou're not going to be able to excel\nquite as much as you did previously in\nevery aspect of your life and much like\nyou before i had kids i just worked\nnon-stop right i loved working i loved\nbeing a reporter i loved reporting and\nwriting\nand and then we had kids and it actually\nillustrated something to me that came up\na lot in the research which is important\nwhich is\nif i was to ask you to give up part of\nyour life right now for children\nit would seem\nit would seem at best neutral and\nprobably negative right because you\ndon't know the love that you're gonna\nfeel to have about having a kid right\nyou know it intellectually but you\nhaven't felt it yet you haven't you\nhaven't had that enter your life\nand one of the things we know is that it\nis very hard to give up anything\nincluding habits\nwhen the alternative is a vacuum\nin fact this is actually known in the\npsychology literature as the golden rule\nof habit change\nwhich says\nyou should not try and extinguish habits\nin your life because the truth of matter\nis you can do it for a while but those\nhabits exist in your brain there are\nneural pathways of that cue that routine\nand that reward that are all put\ntogether and it's always going to be\nthere and so in a moment of stress or a\nmoment of of anxiety you're going to\nfall back on that habit\nwhat you should do instead\nis change the habit find something new\nto fill that hole in your life right\nsome some new behavior that corresponds\nto the old cue that delivers something\nsimilar to the old reward and for me\nwith kids what happened was you know we\nhad kids and you're right suddenly i had\nto stop working quite so much because if\nnothing else my wife was like where are\nyou like i need your help you need to\ncome home\nand and babies are wonderful but one of\nthe things about them is that they're\nexhausting and kind of boring sometimes\nand so it's hard when you're a new\nparent it's hard to like give up this\nold lifestyle you had that you spent\nyears years building towards\nnow suddenly you have to you know be up\nat two o'clock in the morning and look\nterrible and smell terrible and never\nget to shower\nand so one of the things that i realized\ni think other people realize too is\ninstead of seeing it as giving something\nup you have to see it as opting for\nsomething else right one of the things\nthat one of the habits that i found i\ndeveloped once i had kids was\nthe habit of just much more being\npresent with my children\nbecause i knew that you know in six\nmonths or a year or ten years\ni'm never going to have this again i'm\nnever gonna have my kids sleeping on my\nstomach and when they get older i'm\nnever gonna have them\nshowing me the first words that they\nwrote and then now my kids are 13 and 10\ni'm never going to have them you know\nshowing me the new clothes that they're\nwearing and asking me if asking me if i\nthink they look cool\nand so this this presence this this\nbeing present this habit of mindfulness\nof presence which i think i think you\nhave spent a long time cultivating\nthat's something that's new i think for\na lot of people is new for me when i had\nkids\nand the reason why i was able to embrace\nthat is because i was giving up other\nthings\nin order to have something new\ni i had this change my thinking about\nabandoning all these habits which i\nloved which had made me successful\nfor a vacuum and rather saying look i'm\nnot going to be able to work until 10\no'clock at night anymore right i used to\nbe able to sit down on my desk at nine\nin the morning and power for 13 hours\nnow i'm gonna go home at 5 30\nbut it's not because i'm giving up\nthis discipline i had before it's\nbecause i'm opting for something else\nand that's really important when people\nare thinking about changing their own\nhabits they need to think about not just\nbreaking a bad habit they think they\nneed to think about opting for something\nnew that's better and healthier yeah\nwhat a brilliant piece of advice in the\nspiritual literature that i studied\nthe english translation it was referred\nto as the higher taste and it was the\nidea that you can only give up these\nlower tastes when you have a higher\ntaste and the idea of lower and higher\nbeing vibrational and energy based that\nwhen you first start meditating it's\nboring or it doesn't work or it doesn't\nmake you feel happy but as you develop\nthe higher taste you start to like the\nvibration and the energy that you\nexperience as opposed to this lower\ndistraction and the same applies in a\npractical way i remember when my wife\nwas worried about the amount of sugar i\nconsumed so i grew up in a home and my\nmy community knows this well where i ate\nfour chocolate products a day a\nchocolate biscuit a chocolate bar a\nchocolate yogurt and a chocolate ice\ncream and i ate that my whole life and\nthen when i was at university i got\nthrough university by having you know a\nbottle of sprite and a chocolate bar\nevery single day so i'm so used to\nconsuming high amounts of sugar now i\nmarried a nutritionist and a dietitian\nand an ayurvedic health practitioner so\nmy wife was highly worried about my\nconcern i would say not worried\nconcerned about my amount of sugar\nintake and so she was constantly trying\nto remove sugar from my life\nbut i would say to her that i was like\nbut i i rely on it for maybe energy or i\nrely on it for\nboosting my\nmood or performance or whatever it may\nbe\nand it took her a while and i said to\nher you need to help me find a\nreplacement\ni need a replacement\nand finally we found it in dates so\ndates have become a phenomenal i don't\nmean dates with her i mean i mean food\ndates\nand uh cacao nibs so like cacao raw\ncacao or monk fruit monk fruit sweetened\ncacao has become a really natural form\nof sugar uh that gives me the same\nfeeling and the same taste and the same\ncomfort without a lot of the negative\neffects on my health that sugar has and\nso having gone through that very\npractically in an area where i had\nsomewhat of an addiction\nit's really interesting to see how what\nyou're saying is actually played through\nin my own life as well well and i think\none of the important aspects of what you\njust said is\naccepting\nthat that sometimes reaching that higher\ntaste\nis a journey that has steps along the\nway right one of the things that we know\nabout habits is that\ntake exercise is a good example again\nwhen we first start developing a habit\nwe oftentimes need external rewards\nright so so we need that smoothie after\nwe go for a run we need the like nice\nlong shower very similarly i don't know\nif this is true for you but when i\nstarted meditating like i i would\nmeditate for three minutes and i had to\ngive myself a reward right i would i\nwould use one of the the biofeedback\nbands so that i could hear the birds\nchirping in the background because\nwithout it it just it felt totally\npointless i didn't understand why i was\ndoing this it wasn't fun at all to\nmeditate\nand then over time what happens is that\nas your brain learns to appreciate the\nhigher taste as your brain learns to\nappreciate the higher intrinsic rewards\nthey begin to crowd out the need for the\nextrinsic reward so again with exercise\noftentimes when people start exercising\nthey need to give themselves something\nin fact oftentimes the most effective\nway to start exercising is to give\nyourself a small piece of chocolate\nafter you exercise\nand then after a week or two or a month\nor two you start to realize like\nactually i just feel good when i\nexercise those of course are the\nendorphins and the and the cannabioids\nall these neurotransmitters that are\ndesigned to make you feel good\nand you start saying actually i'm not\neven craving the chocolate anymore i\njust crave that feeling of healthiness i\nget after a run\nor with meditation i'm sure at some\npoint you and i definitely i stopped\nneeding these extrinsic rewards i mean\nto stop needing someone to tell us you\ndid a good job because you sat still for\n10 minutes today instead there's a sense\nof calmness right the alpha waves that\nmake us feel good\nand that's important is because\noftentimes we think that we should be\nable to reach enlightenment immediately\nright we go for a run and instead of\ngiving ourselves a small piece of\nchocolate we give ourselves a kale shake\nbecause we should be happy with this\nkale shake nobody likes a kale shake man\nbut that's not a reward that's like\nthat's more do-gooderism\nbut the the point is that if we are\npatient with ourselves if we recognize\nthat i need to start with extrinsic\nrewards and move to intrinsic awards\nwere much more likely to change that's\nthat's so brilliant thank you for thank\nyou for that addition and expansion on\nthe idea and as you were saying that\ni was thinking about something that i've\ndiscovered more recently\nand it's this idea around memory and\nexperience so if i've had a really\npainful start to the day the one that\nyou explained you're rushing to get that\nrun in you don't get to reward yourself\nyou're late for work you're scared that\nyou're gonna miss the kids class or you\nknow an event or recital and then\neverything's going wrong that memory\nstays very strongly with us like\nnegative memories kind of grab a hold on\nto us and you'll be able to explain this\nbetter but when you have a good\nexperience it's almost like oh yeah that\nwas good that was nice like we don't we\ndon't hold on to it it's the same with\nsocial media when you are scrolling\nthrough the comments you see all these\nbeautifully positive comments\nand you just go oh yeah great great\ngreat and then you see one negative one\nand you amplify it so even in our memory\nwe retain a negative experience from\nworking out or eating a healthy meal\nfar stronger than we retain a positive\nmemory can you tell us a bit about that\ncharles\nthat's you're exactly right and study\nafter study shows that's true and from\nan evolutionary perspective you you can\nunderstand why right if i'm uh if i'm\nwalking through the forest\nand i hear a noise in the underbrush\nit's much more important for me to\nremember that the noise in the\nunderbrush is an animal waiting to\nattack me\nrather than that noise in the underbrush\nis something beautiful that i want to\nlook at\nright for survive from a survival\nperspective the people who remember\nnegative memories better are going to\nsurvive longer and so therefore they're\ngoing to have more offspring and that's\ngoing to get hardwired in our brain so\nthat now the question is okay so that\nworked great when i was living in the\njungle right when animals might attack\nme at any given moment but how do i do\nit now how do i how do i take it because\nsocial me i don't have to remember the\nnegative comments on social media right\nit's not healthy it's not going to help\nme survive so how do i change that\ncalculus in my head given that there's\nmillions of years of evolution pushing\nme in the other direction\nwell the way that you do it is you push\nback against it by reminding yourself\nwhy the positive reward is so great and\nthere's kind of two ways to do this the\nfirst is simply come up with ways to\nremind yourself to enjoy that positive\nreward right that's why i say\nafter you go for a shower don't just\nafter you go for a run after you\nexercise don't just take a shower\nluxuriate in the shower right like let\nyourself relax look forward to the\nshower use some special you know smelly\nsoap that may that makes it feel amazing\nbut the second thing to recognize here\nis that\noftentimes what we're talking about when\nwe talk about\nrewards that seem very short-lived\nis their transactional rewards as\nopposed to emotional rewards one of the\nthings that we know is that emotional\nrewards persist longer they have a\ngreater sense of salience within our\nbrains\nso very frequently you'll say okay i\nwent for a you know i i got a\ni got a big client i'm going to buy\nmyself a new watch\nthe joy you feel from that watch because\nit's a transactional reward\nis much much\nshort-lived\nthan the joy of your boss telling you\nlook man you're amazing i'm really proud\nof you you did an amazing job on that\nand so in order to hijack that process\nyou're talking about in order to make\npositive rewards as powerful as negative\nrewards we need to not only train\nourselves to remember them we need to\nfind positive rewards that have an\nemotional characteristic because that\nemotion is going to persist in our brain\nmuch longer\nthat's also why for instance when you\nbring up the negative rewards that you\nthat are so easy to remember they're\nalways emotional right it's someone\ncalling it's not someone saying that\nyour point is a bad point or disagreeing\nwith you logically it's someone saying\nthat you're an idiot or that you look\nstupid or making you feel bad\nso we gotta fight fire with fire find\nrewards that aren't just material find\nrewards that aren't just transactional\nfind rewards that are emotional and most\nof those emotions frankly will come from\nother people as opposed to things you\ncan buy\nyeah i appreciate you\nforming that distinction between\nemotional rewards and transactional\nrewards because you're so right it's\nit's so natural to gravitate\ntowards a transactional reward because\nthat's how society has rewarded us too\nyou get a medal you get a physical\nuh depiction of your achievement you get\nan award you get a trophy and so the\nwatch becomes a trophy or the car\nbecomes a trophy or a house becomes the\ntrophy but as you said it was the\nappreciation that you were seeking or\nthe\nuh the affection or the acknowledgement\nof what you've done and it's really\ninteresting you say that so one thing\nthat's really helped me is i discovered\nthat the things that are actually good\nfor me\nthey're hard before\nand they're easier afterwards\nand the things that are generally\nunhealthy for me\nfeel great before\nand feel terrible afterwards so taking\nyour example of going to the gym\nwhen i wake up\nit's unlikely that i want to run to the\ngym i you know i've become better at it\nand i i go to the gym four or five times\na week\nbut there's still maybe a morning when i\nwake up and say i think i need to take\nit easy today but i push myself to go\nand when i leave i go i'm so happy i\nwent and i'll come home and i'll say to\nmy wife i'll say remind me of this\nmoment that i told you that i'm so glad\nthat i went and every time i tell you in\nthe morning that i don't want to go to\nthe gym remind me of this that when i\ncome home i'm always beaming i'm full of\nenergy and full of vitality and life\nplease remind me of this and it's almost\nlike that human reminder from her\nis all the emotional reward i need\nto remember that physical emotional\ntangible effect that going to the gym\nhas on me or eating healthy absolutely\nand it works the other way around too\nright like i go to the when i go to\ndinner with my wife and there's like\nsome\ncreamy pasta dish on the menu and i'm\nlike oh man i'm starving like that looks\nthat sounds so good and then i eat it\nand i tell my wife like next time just\nremind me i feel terrible after eating\nthis like i feel so gross\nand you're exactly right that that and\nin fact within psychology there's this\nthere's a really interesting science\nknown as implementation intentions\nwhich basically says look at the moment\nwhen you have to make a decision\noftentimes that's the worst time to make\na decision because there's so much going\non inside your head that's going to\nnudge you one way or the other right if\nyou everyone knows this if you go\ngrocery shopping when you're hungry\nyou're going to buy crazy crazy things\nright you're going to spend way too much\nmoney so everyone has lunch before they\ngo grocery shopping so they can make\nwise choices and we can apply that\npolicy throughout life like if you're\ngoing to go out to dinner don't decide\ndon't wait till the last minute to\ndecide what you're going to order for\ndinner because you're going to be\nstarving decide in the afternoon look up\nthe menu online so that you know so that\nyou can make the decision when you're\nnot hungry\nand those implementation intentions\nsaying to yourself i'm have an intention\nto implement a decision at a particular\nmoment i have an intention to try and\ndetermine ahead of time when i should\nmake choices and what i should do when i\nsee certain stimuli\nthat is how we gain control over our\nbehavior it's kind of unfair to ask\nyourself to be a saint all the time\nparticularly when you're surrounded by\ntemptations\nit's a lot easier to be a saint and\ndecide to be a saint when the\ntemptations are to remove\nbecause then when the temptations come\nalong you've already made your choice\nyes yes so well said so well said i\nthink one of the\nbiggest things that affects a lot of\npeople who may be listening to this\nare this idea of\nwell especially because you brought up\ndecision-making charles the idea of\nprocrastination and overthinking and\nthat seems to be\na huge\nchallenge in our society today because\nthe level of information analysis\nand overload that we're dealing with is\nso high i read a study a few years ago\nthat said we experienced through the\nnews social media we experienced more\ntragedy\nin 24 hours than we used to in our whole\nlifetime 25 years ago and when you think\nabout that you're comparing\nhours\nto a 70-year lifetime\nthat is\nyou know i mean the brain hasn't had\nenough time to catch up and evolve and\nso there's glitches and there's mistakes\nand so that procrastination and\noverthinking again is very normal and\nunderstandable what have you found to be\nsome of the best techniques if someone's\nlistening right now and saying charles i\nagree with you but i just try and put\noff decisions completely like i just try\nand make no decision\nbecause that's easier for me to not\nthink about it but then i get more\nscared because i haven't made one and\nthen i get lost in overthinking in the\ncycle of procrastination\nso there's been a bunch of research\nthat's been done on procrastination and\noverthinking and some of my favorite\nresearch actually comes from dan ariely\nwho's a general psychologist i love\ndante a great author and so one of the\nthings that dan's experiments have shown\nis that\nwhen people talk about procrastination\nwhen they talk about overthinking\nabout avoiding making a decision\nwhat they're really talking about is\nthey're talking about the first step\nright once you take the first step it's\nusually pretty easy and this is true of\nmany many things right once you do once\nyou're in the gym it's pretty easy to\nwork out it's the getting to the gym\npart that you put off again and again\nand again once you've decided that you\nwanna you know go on that vacation it's\npretty easy to figure out like which\nflight you're gonna take it's the\ndecision of going on the vacation and so\nthe question isn't how do i do this\nentire task the question is actually how\ndo i make it easier for myself to take\nthe first step and there's basically two\nthings that help us with this\nthe first is make that first step as\nsmall as humanly possible\nright\nif if you're talking about going to the\ngym if you're talking about exercising\ndon't sit down ahead of time and figure\nout what the next three months of\nworkouts are gonna be like instead make\nthat first step simply to say\nlook i'm just like i'm gonna have my gym\nclothes in the car the first step is\nliterally all i have to do is get in the\ncar turn on the ignition and get out of\nthe driveway because once i'm out of the\ndriveway i'm not gonna have any place to\ngo except for the gym so let's make it\nas easy as possible and as small as\npossible to get in the car and literally\njust back out of the driveway\nnumber two\nis\nhow do i reward myself for that small\nstep now most of the time when we think\nabout going to the gym\nwe say like i'm gonna put off the reward\nuntil i've done the whole workout or if\nyou're really a masochist you're like\nlook i'm gonna train for a half marathon\nwhich is what i train for half marathons\ni'm gonna train for half marathon i'm\ngonna put off the reward until i run the\nrace 12 weeks from now that's not gonna\nwork like what you need to do is you\nneed to get that reward as fast and as\nearly in the process as possible even if\nit's just a small reward so if it's a\nmatter of backing on the driveway it can\nbe as small as just feeling good about\nyourself for backing the car out of the\ndriveway you've you've accomplished what\nyou needed to do today if you get to the\ngym and you work out for four minutes\nthat's okay\nbecause the entire point was just to get\nto the gym\nthe key the question people should ask\nthemselves is not how do i make\nprocrastination less of a presence in my\nlife it's how do i take a decision that\ni'm avoiding make it as small as\npossible\nand then reward myself for that first\nstep because if you can teach yourself\nto do that\neverything else is going to take care of\nitself that's brilliant and you also\ntalk about positive procrastination\nright like you talk about the idea that\nsometimes some of our best decisions are\nmade when we create a bit of a distance\nand allow ourselves to procrastinate and\noverthink which i think is such a\nunique and powerful way to think about\nit because we've been\nwe've been taught to believe that people\nwho make their decisions quickly and\neffectively and now are the most smart\npeople\nand\nwhat you're actually saying is well no\nprocrastination can be a really healthy\npositive thing and i see that in my life\nsometimes that there are some decisions\nthat i allow to simmer\nfor a month and there are some decisions\nthat i allowed to simmer i just made a\ndecision a big decision this year i\nwould say i was trying to make that\ndecision for four years\nand the decision i made this year was\nthe best decision i made but i honestly\nhave been thinking about that decision\nfor four years now i don't take four\nyears to make every decision like what\nam i going to eat tonight or what am i\ngoing to eat tomorrow or\nbut but i think some decisions demand\nthat level of\nthought because the reason why i took\nfour years is because that is going to\nimpact more than the next four years of\nmy life that's why that decision\nwhat was the decision that you took your\nfour years so the decision that took me\nfour years was the there was something i\nwas working on and it was either do i do\nthis myself\nor do i partner with someone where i can\ncreate something really powerful so it's\nlike do i build it from scratch\nor do i work with someone who's already\nadvanced in that area\nand build onto and expand what they've\nalready done adam grant writes about\nthis very eloquently right about\npositive procrastination and and one of\nthe ways to think about it is actually\nto ask yourself is this rational\nprocrastination because you're right we\nhave all kinds of pressures that make us\nwant to act quickly right there's\nactually something known as the\ncognitive need for closure which is\nit just feels good to make a choice\nright it feels good to cross something\noff your to-do list it feels good to put\nit behind you and say like i don't got\nto worry about that anymore\nbut often times there's a very rational\nreason not to make that choice sometimes\nit's just you need to sit with it for\nlonger to see how you really feel\nsometimes it's that you need more\ninformation sometimes it's that actually\nmaking the choice right now would screw\neverything up because because i know\nthat there's going to be other\nopportunities i know that there's going\nto be ways to have seeing this in\ndifferent this situation in different\nways and if i'm locked into one\nviewpoint it's going to be hard for me\nto see other opportunities\nand so one of the things that's really\nimportant is to sit with yourself and\nsay look am i hesitating on this because\ni'm scared of making the choice because\ni'm scared of doing the work or am i\nsitting with this because it just\ndoesn't feel right yet\nand that rational procrastination\nis one of our most powerful\ninstinctual tools\nfor knowing without knowing it\ndeliberately or consciously\nwhen it's ready when we're ready to make\na choice\num that's that's i that that's really\nreally\na great extension of of what i was\nthinking about in my decision making and\nthat's clarified a lot for me and one of\nthe things that i've definitely felt is\nreally thinking about\nhow how much of your life is going to be\nimpacted by a decision\nallows me to know how much rational time\nto give to it\nand i think and that's kind of how i've\nalways processed it like it's like\ngetting married\nis going to impact\nyour whole life\nuh i think this is what we were talking\nabout earlier having children\nis a massive life change but what i find\nfascinating and this is something that i\nspend a lot of time thinking about in\nall of these decisions\nis\nwhen you're thinking about choosing to\nbuy a home or move city or town you\nthink about a lot of things like what\nschools are we near and like is this a\ngood area and would this be a good\ninvestment and is this a smart choice\nbut sometimes we just get married or\nhave kids just by default like it's an\nautopilot move\num and and i think that it's really\nfascinating when you take life\ntransitions\non autopilot or what i read in\npsychology was known as sliding versus\ndeciding we slide into decisions rather\nthan actually decide to make them we\ndon't consciously intentionally\nprocessed those and when we slide into\nsomething you're now sliding into like a\nball pit of like whatever it is right\nthere's there's no practice can you\nspeak to that a little bit charles\nabsolutely well and i think the other\nthing that you're picking up on which i\nthink is really smart is\nour environment\ninfluences how we make decisions so much\nin ways that we don't often see right in\nfact what happens is and this is known\nin psychology as the the um fundamental\nattribution error\nis that there is something in our\nenvironment which is influencing us but\nwe blame ourselves or other people for\nsomething right if i happen to to sit on\nthe same side of the table as someone as\nopposed to on the other side of the\ntable from them i'm more likely to agree\nwith them rather than disagree with them\nand i think that's because either i\nagree with them or they're agreeable or\ni'm agreeable but actually just has to\ndo with where we sat at the table that's\nthat's the thing that we fail to\nrecognize and oftentimes when we're\nmaking choices we're not aware of all\nthe environmental influences around us\nright it's not a coincidence that most\npeople get married after three of their\nother friends have gotten married right\nbecause all of a sudden like marriage is\ncontagious\nyou see jim and you see pam get married\nand then you're like well maybe that's\nokay for me too right same thing happens\nwith kids and so one big question and\nthis is kind of the focus of my second\nbook smarter faster better one big\nquestion is how do we build the habits\nthat force us to slow down and think\nmore deeply about the choices we're\nmaking when thinking deeply is hardest\nright either because we feel like we're\nin a panic or we feel like there's a lot\nof pressure or there's things that are\nhappening around us that are happening\nvery quickly how do we force ourselves\nto slow down\nand make more deliberate choices\nin those moments\nand the answer is\nyou just build habits to do it more\nimportantly you build what are known as\ncognitive routines\nyou build these these almost like um\ntrip wires in your life that force you\nto slow down so for some people for\ninstance\nthis can be as simple as\nsaying before i make any big choice i\nalways have to call my spouse and talk\nit through with my spouse\nnow if you're making a big choice at\nwork your spouse doesn't know anything\nabout the pros and the cons right your\nspouse isn't going to actually give you\nany great advice all your spouse is\ngoing to listen to you but that trip\nwire saying i don't make any big\ndecisions without talking to myself\nfirst that's to help you slow down\nforce you to explain the pros and cons\nto your spouse force you to make sure\nthat you are seeing everything from\nevery perspective\nthese trip wires that we build into our\nlives\nthey are the things that let us think\nmore deeply particularly when thinking\nis hard and they are ultimately habits\nyes\na reminder i like to share with people\nis that you're not\nahead or behind\nyou're not early or late\nyou're not\nforward or backward like you're in the\nright place right now where you need to\nbe to slow down and make this decision\nand when we start making decisions based\non i'm missing out they're doing it\nwe're so late and behind now all of a\nsudden\nyou're completely working against what\nyou just said which is finding that\nspace\nand time and silence and stillness\nto say where do i want to move and how\ndo we want to move and what decisions do\nwe want to make and i'm so i'm so happy\nwith the way you're explaining them\nthrough science\nbecause i think we hear these\naffirmations we hear these ideas often\nbut we don't realize that they're\nactually\nbased in how our brain works\nyes exactly and this is what you know\nthis this concept of fomo right fear of\nmissing out yes\nyou have to think about how do i how do\ni protect my environment\nso that i know that these forces aren't\ninfluencing so i mentioned before that\nthat we the fundamental attribution\nerror is that we mistake something in\nour environment for something that's\ninternal to our character\nthat if we if we take that seriously we\nhave to think about our environment so\nfor instance take social media\ni i don't check social media during the\nday i allow myself to check it once in\nthe morning and then when i get home\nfrom work and after dinner then i check\nit then\nbut the rest of the day i don't and the\nreason why is because i don't want that\ninfluence\nimpacting my brain\nlike i find that it distracts me i find\nthat it\nit emotionally manipulates me right i\nsee something about ukraine and then\nsuddenly for the next 15 minutes i can't\nget any work done because i'm obsessing\nabout what happened on a battlefield\nwhere obsessing about it at that moment\ndoes not make it better it doesn't\nchange the facts right in fact if i put\nit off to thinking about it that night\nmaybe i can make a donation that\nactually helps\nbut but thinking about our environment\nthinking about how we structure our\nenvironment so that those influences\nthat we know that we're prone to are not\npresent\nthat's really important but it's\nsomething that we don't learn how to do\nas well as we should yeah yeah it's so\ntrue so so beautifully and brilliantly\nexplained again i want to talk about\nyour second book a bit uh because i\nthink the idea of productivity is\nso interesting right now and\nproductivity gets\nhas a good and a bad reputation in\ndifferent ways so\nproductivity of course and we'll dive\ninto it and how we can become more\nproductive and how we can become more\nefficient effective but before we do\nthat\ni also want to address the idea of a lot\nof people struggle with productivity\ntoday because it became so equated to\nour value\nand worth in life\nso the reason why some people are\nquestioning whether productivity is a\ngood metric of anything is because they\nsay well\nyou know i don't want my value or i\ndon't want my worth\nto be based on how productive i feel i\nam\nso i i just want to address that before\nwe dive into it now uh the caveat to\nthat is i consider myself a highly\nproductive person i consider myself a\nhigh performer i had to make a really\ninteresting decision a few years back\nand\ni realized something very clearly when i\ndon't think i had all\nthe best habits that i could potentially\nhave\nand the question i asked myself was i\neither have to slow down\nif i want to keep doing what i'm doing\nat a high level\nor i have to improve my health habits\nlike those were my two choices i was\nlike if i want to keep doing this for a\nlong time and i want longevity and i\nwant to serve and i want to make an\nimpact and i want my work for many many\ndecades to\nsupport people and serve people and help\npeople\nthen i'm going to need to either slow\ndown because otherwise i'll burn out or\ni need to up my health game and i chose\nthe latter because i was fascinated by\nwell what can i do\nto perform at a higher level and\nmaintain but still take breaks and\nmanage and i've definitely found that\nwith the methods i've taken where every\nyear will stretch just a little bit and\na little bit more the next year and the\nnext year you find that your capacity is\njust i do more today than i've ever done\nin my whole life\nbut i'm more fulfilled and it's and it's\nbeautiful and then i still know when to\ntake breaks and and again i'm not\nperfect and i haven't figured it all out\nand i still get tired and i still get\nexhausted and i still have days where i\ndon't want to do stuff so i'm not\nperfect by any means and i'm not saying\ni am i'm just saying that it's been\ninteresting to see\nhow having certain positive habits like\nsleep diet exercise meditation like\nthose four simple habits have expanded\nand extended my productivity\nthen my productivity actually feels less\nand productivity feels harder when those\nfour things were not aligned again i\ndon't have kids so i'm not putting i'm\nnot saying any of this is like advice\ni'm just saying stuff that i'm thinking\nabout and working on so\ntalk to me a bit about charles about\nthis idea of people getting scared\nabout their productivity being how much\nthey feel they're worth and how they\nvalue themselves\nso i think it's a really really good\npoint and i think you you just\nilluminated\nthe distinction here that's really\nessential right which is\nproductivity is bad when it's defined by\nother people for us\nright if i said to you jay like you are\nnot productive unless you\nyou know make a million dollars this\nyear and you run three marathons and you\nwrite two books\nthat's not productivity right like that\ndoesn't feel like productivity to you\nwhat productivity really is is knowing\nyour goals and being able to achieve\nthem with less stress and strife not\nmaking yourself miserable along the way\nso what's important here is to say\ni'm going to be productive based on the\ngoals that are important to me\nnot the goals that are important to\nother people not the goals that are\nimportant to society\nso from an outside perspective i might\nsay look jay if you're sleeping eight\nhours a night and you're meditating and\nyou're exercising like that is not\nproductive man like you're\nyou could sleep six hours a night and\nthat meditation like cut that down to\nlike just five minutes a day and you've\ngot some extra time to get some work\ndone right\nbut\nwhat matters is not what i think is\nproductive for you what matters is you\nbeing able to think about what's\nproductive for you and being able to\nachieve that\nso you know that a productive day\nincludes meditation it includes sleep it\nincludes feeling good about yourself\nso the first question that we have to do\nis we have to sit down and say\nwhat does productivity mean to me based\non what i want and acknowledge that\nmight be different from day to day and\nplace to place a productive wednesday\nmight be one where i get the kids out\nthe door and i'm at my desk and i'm\nreplying to emails and a productive\nfriday might be one where i walk the\nkids to school and we get to talk to\neach other and i learn what's going on\ninside their life and i don't do any\nemails because i spend my time with my\nkids\nthe point here is that\nwhen we look at productivity as\nsomething that has a static definition\nthat's when it becomes negative that's\nwhen it becomes bad\nwhen we embrace productivity as\nsomething that is a way for me to decide\nwhat my goals are and try and figure out\nhow to accomplish them and it's based\nentirely on what i want as opposed to\nwhat other people want\nthen it becomes a tool for helping me\ndecide\nhow i want to how i live the life that i\nwant to live\nthat is is such a fantastic way of\ndefining it and i've actually never\nheard productivity defined as well as\nthat i i actually\njust i think that's brilliant because\nyou're so right that\nthe decision i'm making they make me\nfeel productive\nand hence i choose them as a priority in\nmy life but you're right i never thought\nof that but someone could literally look\nat my life and be like jay you waste a\nlot of time sleeping i do sleep eight\nhours a night\nand and people could look in my life and\nbe like wow jay you waste a lot of time\ndoing no work\nwhen actually to me i'm able to do more\nwork and better work and deeper work\nbecause of the time i spend away from\nwork and and as i was saying i think\nyou know one thing that's really\ninteresting to me someone asked me\nrecently what what i thought was the\nmost important skill to develop and i\nthought about that and i thought about\nit again and i really reflected on it\nand the the closest answer i've\ndeveloped so far at this stage in my\nlife\nis the biggest skill that i've learned\nor i believe that i've had to try and\ndevelop and continue to develop\nis to do things that are good for me\neven when i don't feel like them\nand because i think that a lot of what\nis good for you you won't always feel\nlike doing it in my experience at least\ni don't feel like eating healthy all the\ntime i don't feel like exercising all\nthe time i don't feel like meditating\nall the time i don't feel like\ndoing something but i know that when i\ndo it it creates great joy nourishment\nand me and my friend recently\nwere talking about this idea of what\nmakes you feel good versus what makes\nyou feel nourished\nand and we were going back and forth\nabout the idea of like feeling good is\ngreat there's nothing wrong with it but\nwhen you feel nourished it's wholesome\nit's fulfilling it's so powerful and we\nwere saying that we're trying to make\nmore decisions in our life where we feel\nwe're being nourished more than just\nfeeling good in the moment because\nfeeling nourished does make you feel\ngood so i would love to hear your\nthought process around that because i\nthink what we often look at is people\nsay well i don't feel motivated to do\nthat or i don't feel inspired to do that\nand often i would say i don't feel\nmotivated and inspired to do a lot of\nthe good stuff that i do i i can't i\nwould be lying if i said i wake up every\nday motivated and inspired to take you\nknow do what i do i don't i there's\nplenty of mornings where i wake up and i\nthink\ni don't feel like doing anything today\nbut i know that if i\njust don't do anything today\ni'm probably gonna feel the same way\ntomorrow and the same way tomorrow and\nthat actually getting myself up out of\nbed and trying to do one thing may\nactually be better than doing completely\nnothing so can you walk us through that\na little bit i would love to hear your\nthoughts and your opinions about it i'm\njust i'm really just what i love about\nthese conversations charles is the way\nyou think\ni love the way you think like it's just\ni love the way you contextualize and you\nbreak things down and\nthe the research you've done and so i'm\njust throwing at you my thought process\nand ideas no i really appreciate it and\ni love hearing how you think it and and\nand how you approach these questions\nbecause i think it's really fascinating\num i mean i think one of the dua this\nduality that you're discussing\nit reflects what has been a\nan oversight in a lot of contemporary\nsociety and and this is just because you\nknow because psychology is a relatively\nnew field and it's it's developed\nwe became very focused on happiness\nright as a society right what is the\nhighest goal to feel happy to feel to\nfeel joyful but the thing that we've\nlearned is that\nthere is another emotion another\nexperience beyond happiness\nthat is actually more meaningful\nand within psychology they refer to this\nas a sense of well-being\nright so so if i give you sugar right\nnow i can make you happy if i\nif if you're having sex you will feel\nhappy\nbut we know that just eating sugar like\nactually over time it feels terrible\nthat having empty sex is not as great as\nhaving sex with someone you love right\nwe know this and so the question is so\nif i'm not chasing happiness what am i\nactually chasing and and for a long time\nwe built all of our psychology models\naround heat about the hedonic individual\nright seeking seeking this pleasure but\na sense of well-being is actually\nsomething that's more profound it\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you are\nhappy that you are feeling pleasure at\nthat particular moment but it does mean\nsome other things it means that you feel\nsatisfied it means that you feel safe it\nmeans that you feel loved and it means\nthat you feel that your life has meaning\nand if i can give you those four things\nwhat we know is that you actually will\nfeel much better than if you just feel\npleasure or if you just feel happy\ni cannot actually be happy over the long\nterm without a sense of well-being but i\ncan certainly have a sense of well-being\nand not feel happy all the time and\nthat's okay in fact we know that that's\nmeaningful right the most meaningful\nthing that's happened to me in the last\nfive years is that my father passed away\nthat certainly was not happy in any way\nbut it was deeply meaningful it was\ndeeply contributed to my sense of\nwell-being to remind myself of my family\nand my love for him and what he gave me\nand so if we reorient ourselves away\nfrom happiness and towards creating a\nsense of well-being then suddenly all\nthose questions you just asked like\nshould i wake up this morning should i\nget out of bed should i make this\ndecision should i eat this thing should\ni exercise all those questions become\nmuch easier because now our goal is\nwell-being right made up again of a\nsense of safety a sense of meaning a\nsense of\nsatisfaction satisfaction\na sense of in\na sense of having a community with other\npeople\nthose become much easier decisions to\nmake because getting out of bed it's not\nabout whether getting out of bed makes\nyou happy\nif you don't get out of bed you're not\ngonna have a relationship with your wife\nyou're not gonna earn money you're not\ngonna feel safe you're not gonna your\nlife doesn't have any meaning now\nsuddenly the decision to get out of bed\nis much much easier because you're not\nchasing pleasure you're chasing\nwell-being\nso well reframed especially with the\nidea of getting up out of bed\nif you're seeking pleasure\nevery day it will feel almost impossible\nbut that idea of well-being is is so\nstrong\nand one of the things that we've\nmentioned today but i want to dive into\nthere's a couple more things\none is this idea of\nwe try to have\nwhat i call\nwe try to have\nlong-term feelings about something\nbased on\nshort-term\nexperiences so we all say something like\ni will never\never miss going to the gym ever again\nright\ni will never\never\neat something unhealthy ever again like\nwe make these really big\nbroad\nstatements\nand the truth is\nand this happened to me last week so i\nwas having a really healthy week i was i\nwas traveling and i've been really\ntrying to master the art of living\nhealthy when i travel because it's\nreally easy when i'm back at home but\nlast week i gave three keynotes in three\ndifferent states i was on a plane every\nday every other day and\ni\nwas really trying last week to be\nconscious because i've been really\nworking on my health\nand so i was thinking okay i need to eat\nhealthy and so i was researching where i\ncould eat and plan and all this kind of\nstuff and it went great from monday to\nfriday now on friday\ni\nmy flight was delayed by two hours\nand then when we got on the flight we're\nabout to take off\nbut then they brought us back to the\ngate because they said there was\nsomething wrong with the cabin pressure\nwe then waited another two hours in the\nplane\nand then they said all right we're gonna\ntake off again we're about to take off\nand then they said no no no the cabin\npressure is still an issue so we went\nback to the gate and waited another two\nhours\nso now it had been six hours in total\nand i'm sitting there\nand now we get\ntwo hours later they take us off the\nplane because they can't fix it and then\nit takes another two hours for them to\nonboard us to another flight so it's\nbeen around 10 hours at this point i've\nnow missed my next three connecting\nflights now when we go back into the\nterminal for those two hours i go and\nbuy sour patch kids a bag of chips like\nevery single thing\nat this point\nthat i've been trying to avoid the whole\nweek and i i eat my bag of sour patch\nkids very happily i eat my like you know\nbag of chips i'm about to go and buy\nmyself a burger and fries as well at the\nairport\nand and i do\nand and i loved it it was great like i\nwasn't i wasn't sad about anything i was\nlike this is great like this is what i\nneeded to deal with the last 10-12 hours\nand i feel lucky and i feel lucky and\nprivileged enough that i could eat right\nlike because\nthere's that that was a privilege in and\nof itself\nnow here's the thing\nif i had said to myself\njay you can never ever eat sour patch\nkids ever again in your life\nand then that happens\ni feel like such a failure and i did\nthat to myself for a long time where i\nmade these big bold statements and then\ni felt like a failure again and again\nand again\nso\nhow do we\nplan\nfor failure because it is actually more\ninevitable\nthan it is avoidable\ni don't think there's anyone who's ever\nset a resolution set a new plan set a\nnew schedule that has ever kept to it\nword for word yet we still\nhope and we pray and we assume that\nwe're going to stick to our plan exactly\nas it is and i don't i don't even think\nthe most disciplined people in the world\ndo that no so it's of course not right\nhow do we\naccept that we will inevitably fail and\nthat's okay and that's part of the\njourney so this is another this is\nanother question that comes from\nhow our brain evolved and how it's\nworking in today's world right\nwe tend to remember things episodically\nright so so if i ask you\njay who are you\nyou would answer this by telling me\nthree or four big values that you live\nyour life by if i tell you if i ask you\ntell me about your wife you're going to\ntell me what her job is or you're going\nto tell me about the time you met or\nyou're going to tell me about what your\nwedding was like\nwe tend to remember things and describe\nthings in terms of stories and because\nstories always have pivot points right\nthere's a beginning a middle and an end\nthere's where the block twists there's a\ncharacter and that's that's great that\nhelps us remember things\nbut we don't live stories\nwe live day to day\nwe live waking up and ninety percent of\nour time is spent\ntaking a shower and going to the office\nand doing these things that we don't\nreally remember at all because we don't\nhave to remember them because again in a\nstate of nature when the boar is\ncharging at you it's a lot more\nimportant to remember what the path\nlooks like where the boar lives than to\nremember all the paths where boars don't\nlive\nso as a result because we\nthink this way because we think of\nstories\nwe need to recognize that we need to say\nlike my instinct is to say these grand\nthings to say i'm never going to eat\nagain i run half marathons i work out\nthree times a week\nbecause that's a story i can tell myself\nthat helps me remember who i am\nbut the way i actually live\nis day to day and minute to minute and\nsometimes i get off track from that\nstory and that doesn't mean that that\nstory isn't true that doesn't mean that\nthat story doesn't work anymore that\ndoesn't mean that i've changed it just\nmeans that the story of my life is much\nbigger than the story i tell myself and\nothers\nand once we acknowledge that once we\naccept that it's enormously empowering\nright if you go back to aristotle\narizona once said\nexcellent that\nour habits are our lives what we do\nevery day\nis how we ought to be judged so\nexcellence then is not an act\nexcellence is a habit\nand this is important because what he\nwas saying is one moment of bravery one\ngreat decision that's the thing that\nwe're gonna write in the histories\nthat's the thing that we're gonna\nremember but that is not excellence\nexcellence is more often than not waking\nup in the morning and doing the right\nthing and that doesn't mean that you do\nthe right thing every single morning it\njust means that for four days\nyou resist the sour patch kids and in\nfact on the fifth day you probably would\nhave resisted sour patch kids until you\nhave to spend 10 hours in an airplane in\nan airport at which point it's just fine\nto have some sour patch kids and not\nhave to say to yourself by the way i'm a\nbad person now my whole my whole story\nin my head about who i am has just been\nexploded no it's just one moment\nwhat matters is what we do on average\nevery day that's how we should judge\nourselves yes yes thank you for giving\nme the permission to eat sour patch kids\nwhenever i like\nuh but no it it's it's so\nso useful to hear you walk us through\nthat\nas an exercise almost in our head and i\nthink a lot of what you've shared with\nus today\nis really exercises reflections\nquestions i hope everyone's making notes\nas you're listening and watching and if\nyou're not this is definitely one of\nthose episodes to go back through\nbecause\nyou know i've asked charles questions\nnot based on you know it would have been\neasy for me to ask charles\nhow do you create good habits and how do\nyou end bad habits and i think we've\ntalked about all those things in\nhopefully for all of you who are\nlistening and watching really\ninteresting personal practical ways so\nthat you can actually apply it to\nreality\nrather than a set of to-do's now i do\nwant to talk to you about to-do list\ncharles do you believe that to-do lists\nwork uh what's the best way to structure\nour day\nto actually feel like we're creating\nmomentum and movement and i think that's\nthe difference i look at each day and\neach week\nnot by how much i achieved but by how\nmuch i moved the needle right like it's\nhow much momentum have i gathered is\nmore interesting to me than how much\nhave i done\nbecause i think sometimes\nsome things take four years to get done\nand sometimes things take four months\nand sometimes things take four days or\nfour hours but if every day i ask myself\nwhat did i do today sometimes i can feel\nso how do we use to-do lists effectively\nbecause we all have things to do i love\nthe the metaphor you just brought up\nabout momentum because i think it's\nreally important one of the ways i think\nabout it is a is an analogy someone once\nused\nwith me they said like look think of\nyour life as a series of pole vaults\nright the faster and longer you run the\nhigher you're going to be able to vault\nover that pole but if you look at the\nactual event\nthat person could be running for three\nminutes before they spend 10 seconds\nflying into the air and so at any point\nalong there you could say why the heck\nare you running so long like this\ndoesn't seem like it's a good use of\ntime but but if you think about your\nlife in terms of these pole vaults so\nto-do list is a great question and i'm\ncurious how you organized your day\nthis is what we know about to-do lists\nwe use this word to-do list sometimes\nincorrectly\nthere are things which are memory lists\nand those are great right your brain is\na terrible place to try and remember the\n30 things that you want to get done in\nthe next 12 months you're going to\nforget some of them so what you should\ndo is you should have a pad of paper and\nas soon as you think of something you\nmight want to get done you should write\nit down on that list\nbut that's a memory list that's not a\nto-do list\nthat's a memory list to remind you of\nthings that in the past seem important\nto you\na to-do list\nshould be much different a to-do list\nshould be something that you write every\nmorning or every night before\nthat you leave work which is when i do\nit i sit down the last thing i do every\nday is i write on my on an index card\nwhat my to-do list is for the next day\nand that to-do list\noptimally should only contain like one\nthing\nthe most important thing that you can\nget done tomorrow the thing that if you\ndo it it will move that needle it will\nchange your life in a better way\nnow sometimes you can get that thing\ndone so oftentimes what i'll do is i\nwrite down three things this is kind of\ncrazy right i write down the thing i\nwant to get done tomorrow if i get that\nthing done the second thing i want to\nget done and then i sometimes will guess\nwhat ought to be my top priority for the\nnext day and sometimes i'm right and\nsometimes i'm wrong but at most my to-do\nlist has three things on it and what's\nreally clear is i'm not looking at two\nand three until number one is done\nnow of course every day is filled with\nmore than one thing right so i also have\na calendar where i have these meetings i\nhave to go to and i have these phone\ncalls i have to make and sometimes the\npath to getting that one thing done\ninvolves 10 or 12 different steps and i\nmight jot down those steps just to\nremind me what they are but the point is\nthat whenever i look at that index card\ni am reminding myself there is one thing\nthat if i get it done today it will\nchange\nthe trajectory it will make my life\nbetter\nit is so easy\nto continue putting that thing off just\nto put off writing that memo that you're\nscared of but once you write it you're\ngoing to know what to do next to put off\nhaving that tough phone call to put off\ndoing your taxes to put off doing\nsomething that matters\nand if you put it at the top of the list\nand that's your to-do list not the\nmemory list but the to-do list\nthen you're going to do the most\nimportant things because everyone only\nhas 24 hours right and some people get\namazing things done and some people\ndon't the difference is not\nhow many more hours they have or how\nmany employees they have\nthe difference is how much time they\nspend prioritizing what they're working\non\nso let me ask you how do you how do you\norganize your days like how do you\nhow do you remain focused on what's\nimportant and not get distracted\nyeah that's it's a great question so\na few things that i've used is i read a\nstudy that said you can't be effectively\ncreative and logical at the same time\nor back to back\nso i avoid scheduling a creative and\nthen a data or numbers meeting back to\nback so i'll try and have creative\nmornings and data afternoons or creative\ndays and data days and that to me makes\nit easier for my brain to be in the zone\nand focus and get absorbed and obsessed\nwith what we're dealing with rather than\ngoing back and forth back and forth and\nstressing my mind to be be brainstorm\nand be really creative and now go off\nand be really structured and i i don't\nenjoy that i found it exhausting\nactually and i used to find that a lot\nof my fatigue came because i was\ndemanding my brain to be really creative\nand artistic and then to be really\nstructured and focused and those two\nthings are opposite when i'm being\ncreative sometimes i'm not focused at\nall and that's what's good about being\ncreative and when i'm trying to be\nfocused my creative mind is not useful i\njust want to be able to get something\ndone so i use what i call efficient and\neffective days as well i'm like okay\nthis is an efficiency day which means\ndoing lots of meetings getting lots of\nstuff checked off and then i have an\neffective day where it's like all i need\nto do is come up with one idea for the\nnext chapter of my book all i need to do\nis come up with a new vision or a new\nstrategy that i want to create for one\nof our companies and so those are\neffective days where i don't have to do\na lot i don't have to achieve a lot i\njust have to do one thing as you said\nand the efficient days are oh yeah i had\nlike seven phone calls i i checked that\nmeeting off i did those reviews like\nstuff that just i can do easily and\nthey're back to back to back and so i've\ntried as much as i can by the way again\nnot perfect we get this wrong all the\ntime but that's what i'm pushing towards\nto is always pivoting my schedule to be\ncreative and logical days efficiency and\neffective days\nand and the final one is giving myself\na sense of\nuh you know i always plan everything\nfrom rest to lunch to dinner to\nbreakfast so everything exists in my\nschedule i believe if it's not in my\nschedule it won't happen so even lunch\nis in my schedule every day and i will\ntry as much as i can to pause and break\nand actually eat at that time because i\nfound that i used to miss meals and then\ni would feel bloated and then i would\nfeel gas and then i was feeling inflamed\nand then i would feel exhausted\nand and then i couldn't do it the next\nday and so i started realizing that a\nlot of structure at least five days a\nweek i would say this is a monday to\nfriday thing\nwas really powerful for me and it's\nstuff that i'm still tinkering with and\nplaying with what i love about that is\nthat one of the things i hear you saying\nis\nyou're deliberating your goals yeah\nright and we know that this is\nthis is a big part of creating that\nspace and those those cognitive routines\nto allow ourselves to think more deeply\nwhich is to basically to take a step\nback and ask ourselves what is the goal\nthat i'm pursuing right now right\nthere's there's very often when we're in\na situation and because we don't\nunderstand the goal we end up feeling\nfrustrated and at a loss if i'm with my\nkids and i'm thinking about work\nthen i don't know what my goal is is my\ngoal to have a moment with my children\nand really bond with them whereas my\ngoal to think through a problem that i'm\nconfronting at work i end up being\nterrible at both of them right because\nbecause i'm distracted with my kids but\nmy kids are so distracting that i can't\nreally think about work and so very\ni think and you know better than i do\nbut my understanding is that part of\nmindfulness is actually just being clear\nabout your goals being clear about what\nis my goal at this moment how do i be\npresent\naware of what i want to accomplish or\nexperience or feel or what i want to do\nwith my life right now\nand the more we force ourselves to think\nabout our goals the more we're on that\npath to doing the deep thinking that\nmakes us more genuinely productive more\ngenuinely happy more genuinely a sense\nof well-being charles what brings me joy\nis that\nthis type of conversation is the reason\ni started on purpose like this this\nconversation has just been so deeply\njoyful for me because\nthis is the reason why i started this\npodcast was to be able to\npick someone's brain\npick someone like you and pick your\nbrain\nand\ni'm genuinely convinced that everyone\nwho listens to this episode and watches\nthis episode\nwill feel like they can restart and\nreframe\nhow they view habit formation\nhow their application\nhabit failure and then habit longevity\nbased on what you've said and of course\ni highly recommend everyone go and grab\nthe book the power of habit\nuh because it's been such a powerful\nbook in my own personal life for the\nlast\nyou know eight years since i read it or\nwell nine years now since i read it\nuh and\nanything that charles does not just that\nbook any book he's written any work that\nhe's done highly recommend following\ncharles uh because as you can see today\nyou know you're just a wealth of wisdom\nuh phenomenal breaking ideas down making\nsense of things making things really\nsimple and and easy to apply and\nunderstand and retain\nand uh i can thank you more so charles\nwe end every episode of on purpose with\na final five or a fast five where you\nhave to answer each question in one word\nto one sentence maximum\nso you have a one word to one sentence\nuh like 140 character 280 character\nlimit um so charles these are your final\nfive are you ready\ni'm ready okay great okay\nwhat is the best piece of advice you've\never received\ni think the best advice i've ever\nreceived is\njust do the thing that seems passionate\nto you\nbeautiful i love that uh worst piece of\nadvice you've ever received\nthe worst piece of advice i've ever seen\nmy dad told me to go to the university\nof new mexico because i grew up in\nalbuquerque new mexico i'm really glad i\ndidn't\ni love that i love that third question\nwhat is the first thing you do when you\nwake up in the morning the first thing i\ndo when i wake up in the morning is i\nget a glass of water\nand then i like just like\nflip through nonsense on my phone to let\nmy brain just settle down and it works\npretty well for me cool and question\nnumber four what's the last thing you do\nbefore you go to bed\ni read every single night nice i love to\nread anything specific um so i you know\ni'm a writer for the new yorker now so i\nread the new yorker very often um or i\nalways try to have like some novel that\ni'm reading nice and it's just fun i\nlove that and fifth and final question\nif you had to choose one habit\nthat everyone in the world had to\npractice every single day\nwhat would that habit be\nokay so so let me carry out this because\nevery single day is\nhard right\nsome type of exercise and this is this\nseems cliche but i will say i've talked\nto researcher after researcher and like\none guy said to me if you could take\nwhat exercise did to your body and put\nit in a pill\nevery single person would take it every\nsingle day\nright and everyone listening knows this\nlike and it doesn't have to be big it\ndoesn't have to be running a half\nmarathon it doesn't even have to be\nrunning\nif you do five push-ups\nyou will feel better\nso that's the habit that i wish i could\ngive people i love that charles thank\nyou so much for your time your energy\nfor\nuh you know being so gracious with it\nand giving so much incredible thought i\nmean your energy just flowed through the\nscreen i i always love sitting with\nguests and often i i struggle with\ninterviews that have to be done\ndigitally but\nyou you brought the best energy so thank\nyou so much for\nfor being so present thank you for the\nshow\ni'm a huge fan of the show and i really\ndo think that like your conversations\nand your ability to draw out of people\ninsights and the the warmth
