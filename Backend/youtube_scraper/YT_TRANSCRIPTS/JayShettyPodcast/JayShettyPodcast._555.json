    "transcript": "efficiency is often seen as discipline\nbut efficiency means you do a lot of\nstuff\nbut effectiveness means you do important\nstuff\nif you're someone that believes you\nwaste a lot of time or maybe you're just\nnot productive enough maybe you don't\nget enough done maybe you're\noverthinking procrastinating or don't\nknow how to make a plan\nthis video is for you because i'm going\nto show you the eight ways that i save\nmore time make more time and create more\nwith my time let me ask you a question\nhow many of you believe that you're good\nat multitasking\nnow studies show that only two percent\nof the world's population is actually\nable to multitask and researchers say\nthat when people hear that they always\nassume that they're in that two percent\nmaybe you're sitting there at home\nthinking the same thing the truth is\nmost of us are in the 98 say researchers\nand therefore we have to focus on\nsomething called single tasking or mono\ntasking this is the idea that we focus\non one thing at a time\nthis sounds counterintuitive a lot of\npeople say well if i'm doing less things\nthat's going to take more time\nthe truth is when you focus on one thing\nat one time not only does your\nproductivity and your efficiency go up\nyour fatigue goes down and your stress\ngoes down as well\nnext time you get lost in that battle of\ntrying to do loads of different things\nat the same time\npress pause\ntake a step back\ntake a breath and just focus on that one\nactivity this applies to eating it\napplies to driving it applies to texting\nit applies to speaking on the phone or a\nzoom call\njust do that one thing a few years ago i\nread a study that changed the way i live\nyou can't be logical and creative at the\nsame time\nyour brain and mind is using different\nfaculties and different abilities to do\ndifferent types of tasks imagine you're\nin meetings all day about numbers and\ndata and analytics and all of a sudden\nyou're asked to do something creative\nmaybe write a speech or give a\npresentation it can be really really\ndifficult to switch from one side of\nyour brain to the other side in a matter\nof seconds with very little organizing\nand planning we're literally going like\na pendulum swinging from one task to\nanother which is requiring different\nparts of our brain and the abilities\nthat we have the way i solve this is\nthat i start every day by first writing\ndown my to-do list i look at all the\nactivities that i have to do now in the\nexamples i give in this video i've\nsimplified my task to make it easier but\nknow that i do this with a lot more\ndetail you want to draw a line down the\nmiddle of the page on one side of it\nwrite logical and on the other side of\nit write creative you now want to plot\nand mark where these tasks on your to-do\nlist fit either in the logical category\nor in the creative category the question\nyou're asking yourself is is this task\nlargely structured\nfocused does it have certain boundaries\nis it quite a logical step-by-step\nprocess\nor is this creative is it more of a\nbrainstorm is it somewhere where you\nneed to feel free and expressive after\nyou've divided these tasks you now want\nto write down the time estimate that\nthat specific task is going to take what\nends up happening is you start to plot\nyour week by saying monday is going to\nbe creative tuesdays are logical\nwednesdays are logical thursdays are\ncreative and fridays are creative\nor you may also divide your day up into\nlogical mornings and creative afternoons\nor creative mornings and logical\nafternoons this division this time\nblocking allows you to get really\nimmersed into the activity really focus\nand be more productive and effective so\nthis might be unpopular opinion but i\nlive by this and it has truly been a\ngame changer in my world if it's not in\nthe calendar\nit won't get done\nit's not really a priority right you\nhave to make sure\nthat it's in your plan it's in your day\nso i'm going to show you quickly what my\ncalendar and schedule look like that is\nmy life this month as you can see it's\ncolor coded it's beautifully designed\nand as i flick through this what you\nrealize is that every single day i have\neverything from workout time to meal\ntimes uh to scheduled off time all in my\ncalendar what this allows me to do is it\nhelps me prioritize both personal and\nprofessional commitments and helps me\nsee both things in the same place if you\nhaven't put something in your calendar\neven if it's something social i promise\nyou you'll either forget it or you won't\nplan effectively around it when i know i\nhave a really big podcast or a really\nbig interview or if i know that i have a\nbig deadline on a day i don't then\nsurround that day with other difficult\nand challenging tasks\nsometimes i'll start my day with the\nmost challenging task of the day because\ni feel that i need to start with a\nchallenge and sometimes i'll actually\nput it as the last\nmost challenging task of the day because\nactually i want to build that momentum\nwhen you have a schedule you get context\naround how you feel that way you manage\nyour mental health and well-being a\nmillion times better and you do more\nwith less time\ntell me how many times you've\nexperienced this\nyou check everything off your to-do list\nbut you still feel\nunfulfilled you've used your time wisely\nyou've managed to accomplish every task\nbut you still end the day when your head\nhits the pillow\nyou still feel like you failed\nyou still feel like you didn't quite\nachieve something i realized that this\nhappened to a lot of top performers and\nit was because they weren't asking\nthemselves what do i need to do today\nthat will make me feel like today has\nbeen a good\nday\nyou don't think that today is a good day\nbecause you did everything you wanted to\ndo you have to feel like it's been a\ngood day so i do this activity every\nsingle day when i ask myself the\nquestion what do i need to do today that\nwill make me feel like today has been a\nsuccess for you it may be reading your\nchildren a bedtime story it may be\nmaking sure that you made 10 minutes to\nmeditate it may be that you had got a\nworkout in or you had your green juice\nit has to be something simple that's\neasily repeatable on a daily basis but\nthat you prioritize doing it\nwriting down what you did every day\ngives you ideas for the future as well\nand plotting it out in this way makes it\nreally really simple to remember what\nyou could try on another day\nhow many of you feel like the months are\njust passing by and it's crazy to\nbelieve there were over a quarter of the\nway through the year\nbut this is what happens when we don't\nhave really clear goals targets and\ntasks\nthis approach has really helped me\nmanage my time better i have big monthly\ngoals\ni have four weekly targets\nand i have one daily task\nthe one daily task is the baby step\ntowards the weekly target and the weekly\ntarget added up all four of them leads\nto the big monthly goal so what you're\ndoing here in essence is breaking down\nsomething that feels quite unachievable\nimpossible to do and quite challenging\ninto small manageable chunks sometimes\nyou can be sitting there thinking wow i\ndon't know how i'm gonna get that done\nby the end of this month if you've ever\nfelt that way use this model\nfirst come up with how can you break\nthat big goal down into four separate\ntasks once you have these four weekly\ntargets now all you need to do is divide\neach weekly target into a daily task so\nbasically you end up working on\nsomething daily\nthat you achieve weekly which helps you\nachieve something monthly\nnow you've completely deconstructed this\nimpossible unachievable idea into\nsomething very simple and manageable now\ni know i said to you earlier that you\nshould focus on single tasking not\nmultitasking but here's a way that you\ncan actually get more out of the same\ntime i learned this from my good friend\nariana huffington who speaks about habit\nstacking now we all have habits in our\nlife that we do every single day without\neven thinking about it we're driving\naround town we're cooking every single\nday we may be on a walk\nthese are great times to immerse in\nthose activities for sure when you're\ndriving to be fully present if you're\ngoing on a hike to be really there\nwithin nature and if you're cooking to\nbe really present with the scents the\nsounds and and all of the different\ncolors that may be there\nbut\nif you're someone who can do some of\nthose things pretty comfortably\nyou can also add a stack of a habit so\nfor example you may be someone who\nlistens to an audiobook while driving\nyou may be someone that listens to a\npodcast while cooking or while you're on\na hike or walking the dog\nit's okay to have it stack in those\nscenarios to get more out of the same\namount of time i wrote about this in my\nbook\nit's called location has energy time has\nmemory when you do something in the same\nplace every day at the same time every\nday that space builds an energy and that\ntime builds a memory what does that mean\nwhen you've done something in one place\nlike meditated in the same place for a\nconsiderable amount of time that space\ntakes on a meditative energy and\nfrequency it becomes easier to do that\nactivity in that place and similarly\nwhen you do something at the same time\nevery day that time has a memory your\nbody your mind remember that and\ntherefore it becomes easier to do\ndivide your home even in corners i\nremember when my wife and i lived in a\n500 square foot apartment and literally\nevery corner of that room was divided\ninto a meditation corner a social corner\na work corner and an eating corner even\nthat differentiation allowed you to keep\nthe energy of that space sacred and\nappropriate for what you want to do the\nchallenge today is we eat where we're\nmeant to sleep we sleep where we're\nmeant to work and we work where we're\nmeant to eat so we've confused the\nenergy of our environment that's why\nwe're sitting in bed and can't sleep\nbecause we do so many different\nactivities there\nremove that energy from the bedroom\nplace it where it needs to be and allow\nyourself to see how you use your time\nmore effectively in that place a lot of\npeople think sleep is a waste of time\ni don't\ngetting good quality sleep is integral\nto making more out of the time you have\nwhen you're awake i consistently sleep\nfor eight hours a night and i'm really\nreally happy about it because i know\nthat it allows me to perform better\nmentally and physically throughout the\nday one of the things i will add though\nis that you want to be sleeping before\nmidnight the sleep before midnight is\nextremely powerful and is really\ncritical for the hgh the human growth\nhormone to be activated so if you're\nsleeping at 9 00 p.m and you're getting\nthose three hours before midnight that's\nextremely powerful or even two if you're\nsleeping at 10 p.m so getting seven to\nnine hours of sleep per night is\ncritical to being productive with your\ntime when you are awake don't fall into\nthat trap or that habit to believe that\nyou should be sleeping less to do more\nwith your time how many of you find it\ndifficult to start something new or\nmaybe you find yourself spending hours\nwaiting around for that perfect idea or\nmaybe you're someone who just feels\nconfused about doing anything and\neverything if you can relate to any of\nthose statements this video is for you\ni always thought that we wasted time\nbecause we were lazy or we were\nindecisive and while some of these\nthings may be true for you there\nactually is a deeper reason why we feel\nthat way and today i'm going to\nintroduce you to three ideas that are\ngoing to help you break through them one\nof my favorite books is called flow i\nwas recently rereading it on the\nblinkist app flow talks about flow state\nwhich is experienced by musicians\nrappers singers athletes when they're in\nthe zone when they're performing at such\na high level they even forget space time\nand everything around them and you get\nto see art or magic in real life\nnow there are a lot of amazing lessons\ninside flow but one of my favorite ones\nis this discussion when you're looking\nat skills versus challenges how many of\nyou have ever felt that you don't have\nthe best skills in an area and the\nchallenge feels really high\nchances are if you've experienced that\nyou end up feeling frustrated or stuck\nand disappointed in yourself and that's\none of the reasons why you start\noverthinking and procrastinating you\ndon't have the skills you have a\nchallenge or a goal that set really high\nand now you feel overwhelmed and\noverburdened by the height of that\ntarget that you just give up and stop\nworking\nsometimes we have the opposite\nexperience where our skill is really\nhigh but actually we haven't looked at\nour challenges we've been doing the same\nthing over and over again we've been\nrepeating the easy win and in that\nsituation we sometimes feel bored lost\nor confused we feel like our life\ndoesn't have meaning it doesn't have\npurpose and there's nothing exciting or\nthrilling about the work that we do the\nauthor goes on to say that flow is\nachieved when our skill\nmeets our challenge\nso when we really want to experience\nthat flow state being in the zone\nfeeling that momentum feeling that\nenergy thriving we have to make sure\nthat our skill and challenges match are\nwe feeling frustrated and stuck because\nour skills are too low and our\nchallenges are too high\nor are we feeling bored because our\nskills are too high and our challenges\nare low\nin either case we want to focus on\neither increasing our skills or\nincreasing our challenge\nthat helps us focus on the area that we\nactually need to have an impact and we\nstopped wasting time with all the\ndistractions so now instead of\nprocrastinating and overthinking we\nstart focusing on a list of things that\ncan help us improve our skills you have\nbooks\ncoaching mentors communities courses all\nof these are phenomenal ways to start\nlearning now if you're someone who needs\nto increase your challenge your\nchallenge can be increased through\nnetworking i remember when i used to\nspeak or get invited to speak at\ncolleges and schools i love that\nexperience i still do it today whenever\ni can\nbut at one point i realized i wanted to\nstretch my comfort zone then i started\nworking with corporate companies because\ni really wanted to help organizations\nbuild new models of thinking today i\nwork with so many fortune 500 companies\nand enjoy the experience deeply but i\nalso wanted to extend my challenge\nbeyond that i started speaking on stages\ni started speaking at my own events what\ni found is that you can extend\nyour challenge by increasing your goals\nor targets\nor by changing the scale or the depth\nsometimes we challenge ourselves by\ntrying to affect more people do more\nthings and sometimes we challenge\nourselves by going deeper in the areas\nwe're already in and finally a new way\nof challenging yourself is a new\nindustry when you think about someone\nlike michael jordan who went off to play\nbaseball or you think about steve jobs\nwho went into movies and pixar and\nanimation people have challenged\nthemselves across industries when\nthey've truly mastered their field so\nthe question i want you to answer is\nthis instead of procrastinating and\noverthinking do you need to work on your\nskills or do you need to work on your\nchallenges and you'll know where to\nstart another book that's had a big\nimpact on the way i think is called the\norganized mind by daniel leverton now i\nread this book a long long time ago but\ni've been using the blinkist app again\nrecently to dive back into the key\nthemes of this book and the blinks have\nbeen so useful what i love about\nblinkist is that i hadn't read flow or\nthe organized mind for quite a while\nwhilst i do have the real books i also\nwanted to get a quick summary and a\nquick update again so i went on and\nfound flow and realized that i could\nread it in 18 minutes and 10 blinks they\nsimplify the book into these blinks that\nmake it really really easy to digest one\nof my favorite concepts from this book\nthat truly changed the way i think is\naround decision fatigue\nnow i want you to take a moment to just\njot down what are the decisions you make\nevery morning before you've got out of\nbed\nbefore you get into your commute or\nstart your work day chances are you\nspend a lot of time thinking about what\nto wear what to eat that morning you\nmight even think about what to eat for\nlunch what to eat for dinner you might\nbe wondering around what movie you're\ngoing to watch tonight what episode of\nwhich show you're going to watch when\nyou get back you may even be thinking\nabout what meeting do i have what person\ndo i have to connect with today what do\ni even have to do today these are very\ncommon things for a lot of us the\nconcept of decision fatigue teaches us\nthat so many of us are making so many\ninsignificant decisions in the morning\nthat by the time we start our work day\nwe're already exhausted from making\ndecisions we overthink about the smaller\nthings that should be easy and now we\nhave no energy for the bigger things\nthat do require our attention and our\nawareness i want you to create a table\nof decisions to make the night before\nand decisions to make the day off what\nthat's going to help you do is give you\nsomething to focus on the night before\nso you can be prepared\nand well ahead of schedule before the\nnext day and be really clear about what\nyou can only do on that day now the\nnight before you want to be doing that\neither at the end of your work day or\njust after dinner the reason is because\nat the end of your work day you can set\nyourself up for success the next day for\nthose of you that want to leave it till\nafter dinner the reason why i say after\nis because we make better decisions when\nwe're eaten and when we've nourished so\nwhat we're essentially doing with\ndecision fatigue is that we're stopping\nourselves from over thinking about the\nsmaller irrelevant to some degree\ninsignificant decisions to the more\nsignificant decisions now i'm not saying\nthat eating food is not important i'm\nnot saying that what you wear every day\nis not important i take pride in what i\neat and what i wear but when i've meal\nprepped when i've made a plan a week in\nadvance when i've made it simple for\nmyself my brain gets capacity and space\nto make these big decisions a really\ngreat example of this is mark zuckerberg\nbarack obama and others who've been\nknown to wear the same suits or the same\nclothes again and again on repeat now\nthis is something i personally had\nfirsthand experience of living as a monk\nevery day we woke up and we wore robes\nwe had two sets one to wear one to wash\nit simplified that energy in the morning\nnow today of course i don't wear robes\ni'm not a monk anymore and i have a\nwardrobe that i enjoy but inside of it i\nhave many different things but i have\nthem in many different colors that way i\nstill have somewhat of a uniform that\nsimplifies that or i make a decision the\nnight before this third model changed my\nlife the first time i heard about it\nit's called the disc model the disc\nmodel was founded by william marston i\nbelieve in 1928 what it does is that it\nbreaks down all of our personalities\ninto four types dominance influence\ncompliance or steadiness you can do a\nfull test online but i'm going to give\nyou two questions to help you figure out\nwhich category you fall into are you\nmore outgoing or are you more reserved\nnow neither of these is an advantage or\ndisadvantage neither of them makes you\nbetter or worse we all just have a\nnatural inclination an outgoing person\nis the life of the party they're\ndragging everyone onto the dance floor\nthey're the one directing the\nconversation a reserved person may be as\nconfident but they're more likely to get\ninto a one-to-one discussion they're\nmore likely to have an intimate\nconversation on the side they're\nobservant and listening carefully the\nsecond question is are you more\npeople-oriented or task-oriented\npeople-oriented people are thinking\nabout people's experiences are people\nhaving a good time are they engaged are\nthey enjoying themselves task oriented\npeople are like jay you've got five\nminutes before this video ends and the\ncamera battery dies and uh we're not so\nsure if this mic's gonna last right like\nthey're thinking about the task they're\nfocused on making sure that everything\nabout the task is taken care of i think\nabout people and tasks but i think about\npeople first you are one of four things\nyou're either outgoing in task which\nmakes you a d-type\nyou are outgoing in people which makes\nyou an i type\nor you're reserved in task which makes\nyou a c-type or you're reserved in\npeople which makes you an s-type\nso d-types are doers they get stuff done\nthey make plans they keep schedules they\nhave deadlines they get results fast the\ni type the influential these people are\nideators they're inspirers they\ninfluence people they persuade people\nthey're great negotiators they're great\nspeakers and these people are really\ngood at talking now we have the\ncompliance these people are cautious\nthey're calculative they're quality\noriented they want to make sure that\nthings work and that things happen on\ntime and that they're as perfect as they\ncan be they focus on being perfectionist\nthese are the people that send you\nemails telling you you have spelling\nmistakes in your emails we need them\nthey make things work and finally\nsteadiness these people are supportive\nthey're helpful they care about people\nthey have a high emotional intelligence\nand a high sensitivity towards people's\nfeelings what i love about this model is\nthat it shows us how everyone is needed\nto build an effective team to build an\neffective company to have an amazing\nfamily without the d types we'd never\nget things done\nwithout the eye types we'd never be\nenthusiastic and energetic without the c\ntypes things may not work best and\nwithout the s-type people wouldn't feel\nsatisfied and content it's so important\nthat we understand all four as einstein\nsaid everyone's a genius but if you\njudge a fish by its ability to climb a\ntree it will spend its whole life\nbelieving that it's stupid\nmany of us overthink and procrastinate\nbecause we're operating in a different\nlane we're trying to be an eye type when\nwe're a detox we're trying to be a\nc-type when we're an s-type we're trying\nto be something we're not and that\ndrains us focus on your strengths\noutsource your weaknesses and develop\nthe skills in between and watch how your\nlife changes there's a great\nconversation between steve jobs and\nsteve wozniak steve jobs the brand of\napple steve wozniak the tech behind\napple and in this conversation steve\nwozniak looked at steve jobs and he said\nwhat do you even do\nyou're not an engineer you're not a\nmarketer what do you even do\nand steve jobs in steve jobs fashion\nreplied musicians play their instruments\ni play the orchestra\nnow although that statement was very\nbold what it was talking about was this\nreally subtle point that he understood\nhis role he understood that he was able\nto bring it all together and get it to\nwork in harmony to create magic this\nunderstanding and recognition that you\nhave a genius you have potential you\nhave a skill that only you have and that\nyou can bring so don't over think and\nprocrastinate about who you're not like\nor how you're not like that person\nthat's doing what you want to do\nfocus on the skills you do have and\nstart there every weekday i wake up at 6\n00 a.m i haven't set an alarm for a long\ntime but i know that my body will\nnaturally wake me up based on the\nroutine that i've created i usually\nsleep for about eight hours a night and\ni'm very grateful to have that much time\nand i prioritize sleeping at about 10\np.m every single day\nwhen i'm up the first thing my mind\nwants to do is say something like\ni feel so tired i've got so much to do\ntoday\nand i as soon as i wake up in that\nmoment\nrewire and reprogram it to say i am\nhappy i am healthy and i am healing that\nsimple internal affirmation and\nstatement rewires how i feel about what\ni have that day i'm grateful for the\nopportunities in the work i have i'm\nhealing with the challenges i have and\nmy body is healthy because i'm able to\nget out of bed i don't look at my phone\nin the morning trust me i don't always\nfollow this i've broken that rule many\nmany times i'm not perfect i've failed\nat it countless times but i keep trying\nto rise back to this rule why because i\nfeel amazing the amount of clarity in my\nmind the stillness that i experience\nwhen my phone isn't the first thing that\ni see\nis\ninconceivable and i highly recommend\nthat you try it out just for seven days\ndon't look at your phone first thing in\nthe morning and see how different you\nfeel for the rest of the day i promise\nyou you're going to feel more energetic\nmore productive and more creative than\nyou've ever been before now i've been\npracticing something for a long time now\ncalled mindful brushing i brush each\ntooth for around four seconds before i\nmove the toothbrush this mindful process\nallows me to start the day at my own\ntime in my own pace\nso often before i used to rush brushing\nmy teeth not only would i be damaging my\ngums and damaging my teeth by the way\ndentists will tell you about that i\nactually was starting my day off in a\npanic with stress\nslowing down the first activity of the\nday\nallows you to start and move at your own\npace in your own time\nthe next thing i do after a shower is\nmeditate meditation has been a part of\nmy daily practice for the last 16 years\nwhere i've meditated for at least two\nhours a day often this is broken up\nthroughout the days on a busy day on an\namazing day i get to do two hours first\nthing in the morning sometimes i'll do\none hour in the morning one hour in the\nevening or sometimes i'll do 30 minute\nslots four times a day this really\nallows me to find that center to find\nthat alignment and find that balance\nthroughout the day my meditation\npractice includes three types of\nmeditation breath work visualization and\nmantra for those of you that have read\nthink like a monk you know that i break\ndown these practices inside the book so\nthat you can practice them at home as\nwell breathwork is a phenomenal way of\ncalming and centering my body\nvisualization is a great way to prepare\nmy mind for all the meetings and events\nand everything i have to do throughout\nthe day\nand the mantra is for my soul it's to\nhelp me feel connected to my purpose\nmake me feel connected to divine energy\nand the supreme source so that i can be\nan instrument of that joy of that\nhappiness and of that love in the world\nwith everyone i mean recently i've\nupdated my morning meditation using the\naura ring app where i take a moment to\ncheck my body status what this does is\nthat it helps me measure my heart rate\nmy breath rate and my skin temperature\njust for a moment just to take a status\ncheck just to check in with myself and\nsay how am i feeling how am i doing\nright now it even asks me if i'm feeling\nbetter or worse after the moment and\nthat allows me to get that really\ncritical piece of insight into how i\nfeel right now when you bump into\nsomeone you always ask them how are you\ndoing how are you feeling\ntake a moment to ask yourself that with\nthe moments feature on the aura ring app\nafter my meditation practice i literally\ntake two to three minutes\nto set my intention for the day and my\nattention for the day i found that this\nactivity allows me to create the energy\nand the mental space i need to try and\nlive by higher values now again i fail\nat this all the time i can go through\nthe day and then realize i haven't been\nloving i haven't been kind i haven't\nbeen the nicest person that day but the\nthing is when i write it down in the\nmorning i promise you i'm more likely to\nbe what i write on the page i'm reminded\nto be what i write on the page i also\ntake a moment to write three things i'm\ngrateful for\nand no matter how hard it is they're at\nprom i promise you there are some days\nwhere i'm like i've just got complaints\ni've got nothing to be grateful for and\neven on those days i will push myself to\nwrite down something i'm grateful for\nand i'll always find an answer\nstarting your day off in this way gets\nthis right so that now every action\ncan actually be inspired by that\nintention everything that you do\nexternally will be created by how you\nfeel internally and now you can take\nthat energy out into the world we are\nheaded to morning tennis so this is\nsomething that i do around four times a\nweek\ni realized that i just missed playing\nsport when i'd wake up in the morning\nand i'd head over to the gym or with the\ntrainer i always found that slightly\nstressful the idea of just being there\nwith one person and\ntrying to do a bunch of exercises that\nwere meaningless or purposeless at least\nto me\nbut going to play it's just incredible\nto play tennis every morning i feel like\ni'm back at school and i'm starting my\nday with some great energy some\npositivity a little bit of healthy\ncompetition\nso for the past three to four months\ni've been wearing the aura ring\nand it's been\namazing to have it on truly because for\nthe first time i can actually verify\nwhat i'm doing\nhow\npowerful and impactful it is on my\nphysical and mental health\nand i can actually track record\nand look back and plan\nand\ni realized this because there's so much\nthought in business and in technology\nall around how you can't improve what\nyou don't measure and the truth is we\nnever measure our sleep we kind of take\na guess i've been getting around six\nhours or seven hours of sleep this week\nit's a guess it's random it's made up\nyou're hoping you kind of got it right\nyou're like oh yeah but last week i i i\nworked out a lot\nand you don't know it's just an\nassumption it's just an idea whereas now\ni can actually look back\ni can look at how the week's been i can\nunderstand why i feel tired i can\nunderstand what i need to do this\nweekend play has become such an\nimportant value to me there's a\nbeautiful quote that i believe was said\nby richard branson where he said that\nwe\ndon't stop playing because we get old we\nget old because we stopped playing\nand i realized that play was such an\nimportant value for me it was such an\nimportant principle for me that i had to\nstart my day off with play a bit of\nhealthy competition feeling like i'm\nlearning a new skill feeling like i'm\nbuilding a new athletic ability allows\nme to start the day off feeling like a\nlearner and someone who's growing so\nusually after game of tennis i sit down\nto look at my stats it's a great way of\nkeeping that measurement thinking about\nwhat's coming ahead for the rest of the\nday and i can see that it's\nautomatically detected that i've had a\n506 active calorie burn i've got an\nactivity score of 79. i've got a total\nburn of 2357 calories and i've already\ndone 4 000 steps for the day so i love\nstarting my day off with that data it\nhelps me feel like i've started on the\nright foot and now i know what i've got\nto do to hit my goals it's also told me\nthat my training volume is optimal my\ntraining frequency is optimal as well\nand i've got to still stay active today\nbecause i'm still in the red so that's\ntelling me that i need to move around\nregularly and avoid long periods of\ninactivity which helps me stay healthy\nand keep my metabolism high\nthis is a great reminder because\nthroughout the day it will keep\nreminding me the active whether i'm\nsitting at my desk for too long or\nwhether i'm sitting there writing\nscripts it will tell me to get up and\nmove around and until my activity\nreaches optimal i'll know that i still\ngotta keep moving as soon as i get back\nfrom tennis i have some breakfast my\ncurrent breakfast of choice is a chia\nseed breakfast bowl it has blueberries\nand raspberries inside as well and it's\nbeen amazing for my gut health i find\nthat figuring out the food that's right\nfor your gut is so important and it's so\npersonal and unique it's taken me a long\ntime to figure out what to have for\nbreakfast that didn't leave me feeling\nbloated didn't feel me leaving\nuncomfortable throughout the rest of the\nday and a chia seed breakfast bowl has\nbeen the best thing that i've had as i'm\ncoming to the end of breakfast that's\nusually when i look at my stats from the\nnight before i look at the quality of my\nsleep the quality of my rem sleep my\ndeep sleep i look at what i need to do\ntoday and what i love about the auraing\napp is that it guides me and coaches me\nthroughout my day it will tell me what\ntime i should aim to be asleep it will\ntell me what to avoid it will even tell\nme to stay active for me it's really\nuseful having this guide in my pocket\nand helping me make my choices\nthroughout the day and then i sit down\nfor my favorite cup of herbal tea\nusually it's a fresh mint and for me\nhaving a warm cup of herbal tea allows\nme to again start grounded i love the\nscent\ni love the feeling of the warmth inside\nof my body and i love the cleansing\neffect that it has and so this is where\ni am now all of these habits have had a\nhuge impact on my life and that's why\ni'm sharing them with you again i'm not\ngetting them all right all the time\nthere are days where things get changed\nor missed or skipped but i'm always\ntrying to get back to this idea in this\nvideo i'm going to guide you through the\nsix productivity habits for working from\nhome or if you're back in the office\neither you're someone who finds it hard\nto get motivated and productive and be\neffective throughout the day you get\ndistracted or stuck or lost or maybe\nyou're someone who's ticking off\neverything from your to-do list but are\nfeeling drained fatigued and\ndissatisfied at the end of the day if\neither of those are you this is the\nvideo to watch the first piece of advice\ni'm going to give you is really simple\nplan for a commute now for those of you\nthat are working from home you may be\nwondering this doesn't apply to me jay\nwell actually it does\nwhat i find is that if you create a 10\nto 15 minute commute in your day and\ninstead of diving straight into work\nwaking up out of your bed walking to\nyour kitchen table you actually take a\nwalk around the block you're basically\ntricking your mind to feel like you're\ngoing somewhere one of the reasons why\nwe're all feeling so encaged and so\nenclosed is because we don't feel like\nwe're changing environment we don't feel\nlike we're moving from place to place\nlike we were before so if that's your\ncase i want to make sure that you find\n10 minutes at the beginning and the end\nof the day to go to work and come back\nfrom work and use that as time to\nactually dive into a podcast an audio\nbook or a blink on blinkist whatever\nworks for you to give yourself some time\nto prepare for work\nnow this second tip i've recommended to\na lot of corporations and they've found\nit life-changing and so useful i want\nyou to start creating a five-minute gap\nbetween each and every meeting in your\nschedule so if a meeting finishes at 10\na.m the next one starts at 10 05 i don't\nwant you to schedule any meetings back\nto back from this point onwards you may\nthink five minutes is not a lot of time\nbut that five minute gap can be life\nchanging here's how when you take out\ntime between each meeting you get that\nreally important time to decompress\nand prepare for the next meeting you're\nnow not shifting your energy from one\nthing to another thing to another thing\nstraight away and feeling like you're\njust stressed in between not even\ngetting time to comprehend what the next\nmeeting is about i've got five habits\nfor you that you can do across five\nminutes that are going to keep you\nfeeling productive effective and focus\non your well-being throughout the day\nthe first one is water it is so\nimportant that we take a moment to\nrehydrate between meetings it's so\nimportant to stay hydrated because we\nneed to be drinking around two to three\nliters a day and when we're doing that\nit boosts our brain function it allows\nus to feel clearer it's fantastic\nfor making us feel energized throughout\nthe day the second thing you're going to\ndo in your five minute gap is walk\naround this could be in your bedroom in\nyour kitchen wherever you get a moment\nit's really really important to get\nmoving so many of us are feeling so\nstagnant and stuck at the moment because\nwe're sitting at our desks all day long\nwe no longer have a lunch to get up to\nor a meeting on the other side of our\noffices to meet someone we're in the\nsame place this is causing a lot of\nissues with our posture the way our body\nfeels the way our muscles are it's not\nnatural for us to be locked into a\nsitting position throughout the whole\nday the third is to watch by watch i\nmean watch a view\na window look out of a window look into\nthe sky\ntake a step out for a moment and get\nsome fresh air it's so important that we\nlook out into the distance we've got so\nused to just staring at screens and\ndevices and books and schedules that are\nright up in our face that we're not\ngiving our eyes the opportunity to look\nout into the distance now this fourth\none's a little more interesting and you\nmay need a little bit more time for it\nbut it's the idea of wonder allow your\nmind to wonder allow it to think of a\nnew idea to be creative to think about\nsomething unrelated this is where\ncreativity comes from this is where that\nfeeling comes from that you're\ninnovating that you're allowing your\nmind to connect dots that otherwise you\nmight seem as disconnected and the fifth\nand final thing that you can do in those\nfive minutes\nis to wind down and one of the best ways\nto wind down\nis through your breath\nallow yourself a few moments to breathe\nin for the same amount of time as you\nbreathe out a very simple way to do this\nis breathe in for a count of one to four\nand breathe out for a count of one to\nfour how many of you ever felt that your\nmind is ahead of your body your mind is\nracing around but your body feels\nsluggish and tired if you want to bring\nyour body and mind back into sync back\ninto alignment you want to breathe in\nand breathe out for the same amount of\ntime doing this breathing practice\nallows you to walk in with a clear mind\nwith a relaxed body and reduces your\nanxiety throughout the day\nnow some of you may be using your car to\ncommute if you're back in the office or\nyou have a job that relies on you being\ninside your vehicle now if that's the\ncase i have loved the fact that blinkist\nallows you to listen to the blinks so\nyou may have heard me speak about before\nhow blinkist summarizes books into\nblinks well instead of just reading the\nchapters and the sections and the\nhighlights you can also listen to them\nthis has become one of my favorite new\nhabits because in around 10 to 15\nminutes i can understand the essence and\na book in summary one of the books that\ni'm rereading right now that i'm\nabsolutely in love with is called\nmeasure what matters it's huge because\nit talks about how if we're not\nmeasuring something we can't improve it\nif we're not focusing on something we\ndon't know how it can become better so\nfor me being able to listen into these\nblinks and learn at the same time while\ni'm on the go while i'm on the move is\nsuch a refreshing way to stay on top of\nmy growth and my focus i really find\nthat using my car time wisely is a game\nchanger this next one is all about\nshifting from what we call small talk to\nbig talk or deep talk i first learned\nabout this through dan o'reilly and his\nirrational labs where at an event they\nencouraged us to ask more vulnerable\ndeep and bigger questions\nhow many of you are tired of small talk\nhow many of you start every meeting in\nthe same way hey how's it going yeah it\nwas good yeah you know same old weekend\nyeah you know it's it's been a lot all\nright let's get to work we literally\nhave the same conversation on repeat\nalmost seven times a day in every\nmeeting and guess what neither you nor\nthe other person enjoys that\nconversation now this point also applies\nwhether you're working on zoom or\nwhether you're meeting in person again\nwith people we're so used to asking\nsomeone how are you and it's kind of a\nthrowaway question people usually come\nback and give us one of these five\nanswers good\nbad okay fine or\nwe don't learn anything about the other\nperson we don't get an opportunity to\ndeepen our relationship and it's almost\nlike we didn't even care when we asked\nthe question\nbut what if we ask someone hey what's\nthe challenge that you've been working\nthrough lately how can i help you\nthrough it or what's something that\nyou're trying to overcome that you may\nneed an insight on\nthis type of question gives the person\nan opportunity to really share what's\nhappening that vulnerability allows you\nto build a deeper bond and deeper\nconnection and now you're actually\nengaging with someone in a refreshing\nway now if you're like me and you're\nstill spending a ton of your time on\nzoom i mean i'm recording podcasts and\ninterviews with some of my favorite\nauthors we recently had oprah on the\npodcast about a new book what happened\nto you and when i'm speaking to people\non zoom i found that it's even more\ndifficult to build rapport a connection\nespecially if you've never met them\nbefore in person\none of the ways i've been able to cross\nthis bridge is by being curious but not\ncreepy now what i mean by that is about\nasking someone about something that's in\ntheir background i think by now everyone\nknows their zoom shot and their zoom\nlocation they have a few things in the\nbackground maybe a piece of art and\nmaybe a picture of their family and this\nis such a beautiful conversation starter\nespecially if you're trying to build a\nnew relationship recently i was on a\ncall with a client and i asked him about\na really interesting thing that he had\nhung on his wall behind it it was a\npaintbrush i was so fascinated that i\nhad to be curious not creepy and ask him\nwhy he had it there he said my first\never job when i was around 14 years old\nis i used to paint fences\nand after painting fences i got to paint\nrooms and after painting rooms i got to\nstart painting homes and now he's an\nexecutive and a director of a large\ncompany and he said that he hangs this\npaintbrush on his wall to remind him of\nwhere he started give the person you're\nspeaking to an opportunity to tell you a\nstory i promise you'll be memorable and\nmeaningful and if not hopefully it makes\none of you laugh\nand this final point is something that\nwe probably already know and do but i've\nseen it work wonders for me\nturn off your notifications and turn on\nchill relaxing work music\ni've done this for such a long time\nwhere i have a playlist that i listen to\nthat allows me to just get into the zone\nwhat i find music does especially\ninstrumental music that's what i focus\non i try to stay away from popular music\nthat i may listen to in the car or while\ni'm in the gym what that does is it\ngives the mind enough distraction enough\nrhythm enough pattern enough momentum so\nthat you can actually focus your mind on\nthe activity at hand now some of you may\nprefer silence or working to chatter and\nthat's fine too you can even put that\ntype of music on but for me instrumental\nbeats and rhythms are a fantastic way of\ngetting into the zone turning off your\nnotifications is just a no-brainer if\nyou're really trying to do some deep\nwork time is one of those things you\nknow how we use time spend time\ncreate time what we make time for like\ntime is one of those things that of\ncourse is\nand the way we use an essential\nessential essential part of all of our\nlives and i think when we're talking\nabout simplicity or clarity i think one\nof the biggest things we lack simplicity\nand clarity on is time uh and and for me\ni've definitely noticed how\nover life especially when your book came\nout\ni've tried to remove\npeople from having to live their life\nbased on a timeline\nor an expectation and and i realized\nthat because my life went in a\ncompletely different direction whereby\ni became a monk at 22 and didn't have my\nfirst job until 26\nuh and today\nlead one of the most meaningful\nfulfilling lives in the world thanks to\nout all my experiences and so it's just\nit's fascinating there were times in my\nlife where i felt like i was behind\npeople that i should be in line with\nthere were times in my life where i felt\ni was ahead of people there were times\nwhen i felt like i was trying to figure\nit out and i think a lot of people\nusually feel like they're behind\na head\nor equal to and that's kind of how we\nmake sense of stuff and that's why when\nthis book came out which i know was like\nmaybe a year ago year and a half ago\nmaybe if a couple is gonna it's to me\nthat was\ni was fascinated that you were able to\npinpoint\nyou know and go so deeply into time\nwhich i always thought was so much more\nfluid and so i guess the first question\ni want to ask you and and please take\nthis wherever you like like don't feel\nuh constricted at all because i like\nwhat we're kind of co-creating right now\nwhat fascinates you about time the most\nthat you were so deeply drawn to\nactually write a whole book about timing\nyeah uh so so that is actually um\ni'm gonna put the answer to that in more\nof the mundane category um the reason\nfor the impetus for it was just\nfrustration um more than anything else\nit wasn't any kind of deep conceptual\nfascination so so here we are uh you\nknow i'm talking to you from this is\nthis is my office here in washington dc\nit's the\nuh refurbished one-car garage behind my\nhouse i live there like right there um\nand so you know i i would come to my\noffice and and do stuff do work um and\nat a certain point i realized\nlike\ni would have a i'd have a to-do list uh\nand maybe i would have appointments on\nthe calendar but i wasn't intentional at\nall about when i was doing stuff well i\nwould write when i felt like writing i\nwould make phone calls when i felt like\nmaking phone calls i\nwould do interviews when i felt like\ndoing interview you know um and i wasn't\nintentional about it\nand i said that's that's great that's\nthat's crazy like like i i end up i i'm\nactually a fairly kind of rational i\nlike to think i am at least a fairly\nrational evidence-based guy\nand and i'm making these decisions about\nwhen to do things i'm not even making\ndecisions i'm just kind of stumbling my\nway into it um\nand so i said well there's got to be\nsome guidance out there on on like when\nwe should do things and i found to my\nsurprise that there wasn't\nuh and that got me really curious i said\nwell i wonder if there's anybody's ever\nresearched this so i started looking\naround for research and internet there\nwas a huge amount of research on this\nquestion but it was splattered all over\nthe place uh it was in literally two\ndozen different domains so it wasn't\nlike you say oh there's a sociologist\nwho studies timing well there might be\nthere is there are but there are also\nbiologists who do that there are\neconomists who've studied that there are\nmicrobiologists who have done studied\nepidemiologists there's a whole field\ncalled chronobiology and so what you had\nwas you had\nliterally two dozen different fields\nasking very similar in some cases\nidentical questions and what i said is\nlike maybe you know it was painful but\nif i go wide enough and deepened up into\nthis research i can begin to piece\ntogether\nthe evidence-based ways to make better\nsmarter decisions about when to do\nthings when to do things in a given day\nbut also to your other point jay\num\nuh when we think about our lives our our\nlives are episodic\nepisodes have beginnings the episodes\nhave middles and episodes ends this\nwhole idea of the journey metaphor you\nintroduced earlier is like journeys have\nbeginnings they have middles and they\nhave ends and it turns out that\nthere is some fascinating research on\nhow our cognitive abilities change over\nthe course of a day and then more\nepisodically how beginnings affect us\nhow midpoints affect us how endings\naffect us there's research on how groups\ncoordinate in time there's research on\nhow the way we think about time affects\nour behavior there's research again all\nroads lead back to linguistics there's\nresearch based on the way that languages\nconfigure their verb tenses\nit can predict people's savings behavior\nas crazy as that sounds um and so um so\nit ends up being something that is going\nback to another one another one of your\nwords it ends up being essential it ends\nup being fundamental uh because uh we\nare temporal creatures that is we have\nwe talk about colloquially about\nbiological clocks\nuh about about a biological clock but\nbut essentially what we have we know\nfrom from biology is that especially\nchronic biology is that we essentially\nhave\nclocks in every cell in our body i mean\nwe are walking time pieces and again\ndepending on your notion of time sort of\nphilosophically existentially we are in\nsome ways moving through time\nat the very least our conversation began\nin the past\num that right it's going to end in the\nfuture right the people who are going to\nlisten to the recorded version of this\nare listening to something that happened\nin the past but they had but those\npeople haven't done anything yet because\nthat's in the future\nand and so we're sort of swimming in\nthis essential element of our lives and\nso what i was just trying to do is just\nmake it\nunderstandable\nyeah and i think you did a phenomenal\njob and so i want to dive into different\nparts of it i guess my first question is\nlike there's actually there's a few\nthings so the first one is\ni think the most common relationship and\nof course i'm making a huge assumption\nhere but i think maybe we'll agree maybe\nyour research will say something else\nbut\ni'd say my assumption is that the most\ncommon relationship and i believe\neveryone has a relationship with money\nwe have a relationship with time we have\na relationship with uh anything\nknowledge wisdom et cetera and so our\nrelationship with time for most people\nis i always feel like i don't have\nenough\nright that is a very clear relationship\nthat we all have every time it's like i\ndon't have enough time\ni can't make enough time i can't find\ntime like we say all these words which\nare all about making finding creating\nhaving\nwhat does that do what is that mindset\ntoward time how does that actually\naffect our behavior our relationship\nwith time we can think of it as an ally\nwe can think of it as an enemy in some\nways that's over that's oversimplifying\nin that case but i think if what we're\ntrying to and one way to make time your\nally rather than your enemy is to\nrecognize the effect often invisible\nthat it has on\nyour life um\nso if you look so so i'll give i'll give\nyou an example uh\nuh what we know from let's just take the\nunit of a day what we know very clearly\nfrom a whole array of research is that\nour brain power\ndoes not remain constant over the course\nof a day our brain power changes over\nthe course of the day\nso doing something at 9am is not the\nsame as doing something at 3pm period\nfull stop now there's some complexity\nunderneath that but the main idea is\nthat our brain power doesn't remain\nconstant over the course of a day and\nthe best time to do something depends on\nwhat it is you're actually doing so once\nyou understand those kinds of hidden\ninvisible rules\nyou can begin to make time your ally\nrather than your enemy and end up\nmitigating some of those feelings that\nyou never that one never has enough time\num\nso so i think that's i think that's part\nof what it is people who feel like they\ndon't have enough time this is not\nsomething i write about but i'll open\nabout it anyway in many cases\npeople who don't feel like they have\nenough time sometimes not always\nsometimes it's not a time it's not a a\nsufficiency of time issue it's a\nsufficiency a priority issue but they\nthey actually don't have any clarity\nabout their purpose or their priorities\nand so they're\nmoving in all kinds that's not always\nthe case but i think that's that's\npartly the case the other thing that we\nknow is that when time becomes extremely\nsalient in our lives we underperform uh\nand i'll give you uh in certain\ncircumstances or we're unhappy in\ncertain circumstances so i i a great\nexample of that is\nin professional services but\nparticularly in the practice of law is\nthe billable hour\num what we know so if you are a lawyer\npracticing in a law firm not working for\nthe government or doing that or or\nnon-profit or something uh you bill\nyourself out by the hour and so what you\ndo is that you have\nyou know a way to well i mean going\nanalog here but you you have on your\ncomputer or you know scribbled down\nan account of what you're doing\nliterally in some cases in six minute\nincrements uh and what we know from\nresearch there is that that makes people\nthat is incredibly thwarting to people's\nsense of autonomy\num and so\num so there are all kinds of things in\nour relationship with time that if we\nreconfigure it we can feel a little bit\nbetter do a little bit\nmore and better\nyeah that's that that's that's put on i\nthink that makes uh\nthat answer and all the parts would make\na lot of sense i think the\nthe part that i\nget really interested by when we start\ntalking about time in the way you just\ndid now where you talk about priorities\nyou're talking about\nuh the you know the\nthe ally versus the enemy and i i i love\nthat\nis productivity\neven the goal of time\nbecause i feel like today\none of the biggest challenges that i get\nasked at least and maybe your children\nexperience this or maybe what i see\noutside in the world of social media is\na lot of people today spend a lot of\ntime overthinking and procrastinating\nand that's seen as a negative thing and\npeople are often like scared of\noverthinking scared of procrastinating\nor they judge themselves and then they\nstart getting into this kind of like you\nknow\nuh vicious circle and cycle of feeling\nlike oh like i'm wasting a lot of time\nhere tell me about what you found or\neven your thoughts on on productivity as\na goal of time versus the the effective\nuse if possible of procrastination and\noverthinking uh procrastination and\nproductivity okay let's talk about what\nproductivity is i'm going to be literal\nif you look here productivity is the\namount of units you produce over a given\namount of time so it is inherently time\nbased because time is in the denominator\nof productivity okay so\nso again i'm not sure that productivity\nis necessarily the best measure i say\nthat as a writer okay so i could be like\nlike i could be a\nproduct like\nsuppose i wrote more words per hour\ntoday versus yesterday\ni would literally be more productive but\nam i\nam i a better writer i i don't know it's\nprobably it doesn't matter like what are\nthe words right um and so and so in some\nways productivity is\nthe notion of productivity in that very\nliteral sense\nis an artifact of our being an economy\nwhere\nwe were producing\nidentical mass-produced goods and so\nefficiency was the was the highest value\nbecause everything was the same and so\nwhat you wanted to do was in a given\ndenominator\nmake the numerator larger okay that's\nhow you increase that that's a way to\nincrease productivity or keep the\nnumerator the same and shrink the amount\nof time in the denominator so um\nso that's what that's what that's what\nproductivity is i think a way to um\nyou know a looser way to measure things\nis is quality and\nquality contribution impact those sorts\nof things\nuh and certainly for certain kinds of\nprofessions like like being a writer\nwriting more words is no measure of my\ncontribution to the world yeah so if\nanyone's listening or watching right now\nand it's like\ndan i'm i just feel like i procrastinate\na lot i overthink a lot\nand i waste time what would be your\nresponse to that okay so let's okay so\nso that's the product so that's a\nproductivity thing now let's go let's\ntalk about let's not let's talk about\nprocrastination because we know a lot\nabout procrastination okay\nokay two big ideas here one\nprocrastination is not always bad\nokay sometimes you're procrastinating\nfor a reason because you haven't worked\nit out because you're still incubating\nan idea okay so it's not inherently bad\nit's not like all procrastination is bad\nthe second big idea here is that\nprocrastination is basically in general\nthe downside the darn the doubt negative\nprocrastination is just an emotion\nregulation problem right it has nothing\nto do with time it means that you are\nunwilling to confront something and\ntherefore are not\nsomething so disturbing to you that you\nwould rather actually sabotage yourself\nthan confront it that in some ways\nyou're making a quasi-rational decision\nthat the pain of confronting\nman can i really write this\nis greater\nthan actually not writing it in the\nfirst place\num and so so we know this from a lot of\nresearch procrastination is an emotion\nregulation issue and so what you have to\nthink about is what is the emotion that\nyou're avoiding\nand is there a small step\nis there a way in some ways to trick\nyourself into either confronting it\ndirectly or to do something to just get\nyourself going and that in that the\naction ends up confronting the the\nemotion but a lot of times\nbut again i just in certain\ncircumstances it's hard to say\nthe fact that you're not ready to start\nis a signal\nthat\nit might be a very very positive signal\nit could mean that hey it's i'm still\nincubating this yeah that's that's a\ngreat answer i i i love that perception\nbecause i think\ni think as soon as you start labeling\nand going oh my procrastination's bad\nand this is not a good place to be in\nyou're right you just every all of that\nis just avoiding the actual emotion\nwhich is a signal or a sign or an alert\nthat's kind of trying to get your\nattention and and you just keep putting\nit away and i think what that leads to\nand this is something which i found\nfascinating book it's like starting\nthings like i feel like\nyou know knowing when to start\na business or knowing when to start a\nproject is like the hardest thing in the\nworld and you know i'm sure you get\nasked this a million times but like tell\nus about the research behind starting\nsomething and and what you found was\nmost critical there\nagain there's no there's never there's\nvery rarely\nprospectively a perfect time to start\nsomething\nall right but there are ways to give\nourselves a little bit of a different\nit's like a lot a little bit of a\npsychological edge uh and this is the\nwork of katie milkman jason reese and\nhangchen die\nthey did it at penn\nuniversity pennsylvania and uh they had\nthis idea of of um what they call the\nfresh it's called the fresh start effect\nand a way to understand the fresh start\neffect is like this that certain dates\ncertain days certain dates uh are what\nsocial psychologists call temporal\nlandmarks temporal landmarks that is\nthey are they stand out in time the way\na physical landmark stands out in space\nso again back to the journey metaphor\nyou're navigating your way you're trying\nto find your way\noh there's a landmark i know where i am\noh there's that building i have a sense\nof where i am temporal landmarks are\nnavigational tools in some ways\nbut certain temporal landmarks have a\npeculiar psychological effect\nwhat they do is essentially they they\noperate as kind of a restart what they\nsay is that\non certain days that are fresh start\ndays you essentially relegate your\nprevious bad self to the past and open\nup a fresh ledger on your new self all\nright and so there's certain days that\nactually are more you're more likely to\nstart something and you're more likely\nto succeed while starting it so what\ndoes this mean let's let's be concrete\nhere you want to start something you're\nprobably better off doing it on a monday\nrather than on a thursday you're\nprobably better doing it on the day\nafter your birthday rather than three\ndays before your birthday you're\nprobably better doing it on on the uh\nlike uh\nthe first day of summer rather than\nthree days before the first day of\nsummer uh let's say you're uh if\none is a religiously observant you know\nuh you know the day after uh or the day\nof a religious holiday rather than four\ndays before that religious holiday uh\nand so you can in some ways\nuse\nhave that sense of where you are\ntemporarily and pick the right date to\nstart something\nyeah i i can so relate to that and my my\nproblem is i'll try start something on a\nmonday i'll fail on tuesday and then i\nwait till the next monday it just\nstarted\nwell okay so so that's that's that's a\nmixed bag\nthat's a mixed bag it depends on it\ndepends on on how deep the failure was\non uh it depends on how deep the failure\nwas on tuesday now there's another\nstrategy for all of this yeah please is\nwith which\nwe've done all of this i mean it's\nreasonably well known and in some ways\nit's interesting because i think it's\nanalogous to our conversation about\nsimplicity and\nthe opposite of simplicity or simplicity\nand complexity\nuh in that i do think that in many cases\nwe have been\num seduced into the idea of moonshots\nand big hairy audacious goals\ni think that they're important but i\nthink that they're oversold\nin a way and what's undersold just think\nabout it just think about it as a\npricing issue okay so the so so the\nbig hairy audacious goals moonshots i\nthink they're overvalued and i think\nwhat's undervalued\nis small winds\nand once again there's a lot of there's\na lot of evidence of that starting from\ncarl like\n30 years ago\nsmall winds are enormously important\nbecause what small winds do is that they\nsmall winds can overcome that\nprocrastination problem small winds can\nthen lead to other small winds and other\nsmall winds that cascade into something\ninto something bigger so a strategy for\novercoming procrastination a strategy\nfor many things is to go is to\ngo for small wins let me give you an\nexample of that so so\nuh the one strategy that i um that i've\nheard of i i mean i just i called it\nthis it's not originally for me it just\nsort of you know out there i call it j5\nnot j y but j letter j and uh that's\njust tha and that stands for just five\nmore\nokay and so\nif you don't feel like doing something\nyou say okay you know what i'm gonna do\nuh man okay so i'm so i'm doing some\nresearch right now okay i have these\npapers some of them are incredibly\nboring okay you know what i can't stand\nit i want to quit you know what i'll\njust read five more pages just five more\npages i'll read that okay oh my god i\ngot a boatload of email here\noh i can't deal with it i just want to\ngo inside and have a drink you know what\ni'm gonna just do five five more five\nmore emails and we'll do that um\nuh you know what i'm tired of writing\nokay just five more sentences that's it\nand that you know\nthat\ncan get us going give you a small win\nand what happens a lot of times is that\njust five more becomes just 10 more just\n20 more something like uh something like\nthat i really like that one that's\nthat's an awesome strategy i think\nthat's good it's very simple i use it\nall the time i'm not joking around i use\nit today i use it today when i looked at\nmy email file and i was like oh\ngod\ni can't bear that it's okay i'm just\ngonna\ni've already answered enough email i'm\nlike okay just five more\nand you know what i did i just i did\nthat and i got it done and i probably\nended up answering\neight or something like that another one\na very well-known technique i use it i\nhave no shame in using it you're\nprobably familiar with it your listeners\nare probably familiar with it is the\npomodoro technique\num which is which is bit you know\npomodoro is italian for tomato uh and so\num\nyou know you set a a timer i i have one\non my computer uh that i use in on very\ndark days uh\ni set a timer for whatever i do it for\n25 minutes and i just can't bear this\nokay i can't research this anymore i\ncan't read this anymore i'm sick of\nwriting okay here's what we're going to\ndo is 25 25 minute i'm not going to do\nanything else i'm just going to do it\nfor that 25 minutes and and that can um\nyeah and that can and i think let me let\nme extract from this as always a large\ntheoretical lesson and it's this all\nright that\na lot of times in our understanding of\nwhat makes human beings tick we think\nthat belief precedes action that you\nhave to convince yourself and then that\nis the impetus to act\nand in many cases\nmore cases than we realize\nthe arrow runs in the other direction\nthat getting yourself to act\ncan actually trigger the belief yes and\nthat's a very very important that's a\nvery very important lesson that that's\nso true and that's really it's kind of\nlike when we're like i can't make my\nmind up right like even that saying\nis exactly in that belief where you're\njust spending so much time trying to\nmake your mind up and decide something\nand and what i love about what you just\nsaid is is around that whole the small\nwins element of just\ni always feel like when you can get into\na good rhythm and pattern of keeping\npromises to yourself and keeping small\ncommitments to yourself you start to\ntrust yourself and when you start to\ntrust yourself you can then trust\nyourself with bigger tasks the problem\nis like you said is that we go for these\nmoonshot goals and naturally we fail at\nthem\nand therefore we don't trust ourselves\nand i feel like self trust is like the\nbig issue when it comes with time is\nthat you're like well do i even trust\nmyself with this much time do i even\ntrust myself to complete that uh and\nyou're right about the small wins\nwhether it's making your bed or just\nfive more or you know all of these\nprinciples that you're laying out like\nthat just builds trust with yourself\ni'll give you something else uh that\nthat builds trust with yourself that\nthat's related to this concept which is\nuh again it's research based it's built\non uh talked about i've written about\nthis i wrote about it in that book um\ni've talked about it before is um the\nwork of theresa mobile at harvard\nbusiness school and she found that the\nsingle biggest day-to-day motivator on\nthe job is making progress and\nmeaningful work okay so the days we're\nmaking progress the days were motivated\nwe come back the next day feeling\nmotivated uh but one of the challenges\nis that is that we never have a good we\noften don't have a good sense of how\nmuch progress we're making\num and so one of the so one of the\nthings that i've done for this is now\nfor like eight or nine years now\nis um at the end of every day i have a\nprogram what you know called a progress\nritual and all i do is i just basically\nsay\nwhat i g what would you get done today\nand i just list what i got done today\nand i keep a record of that uh and i\nhave to say\ni almost never look at the list\nbut it's the act of doing i mean\nseriously i almost never look at the\nlist but it's the act of doing it so i\nso i just take a moment it's it's a it's\na it's a it's a ritual all right and you\nknow i don't have to tell you former\nmonk the importance of rituals in\nin in human understanding right so it's\na it's a ritual it's a punctuation mark\nat the end of the day what did you get\ndone today dan okay this is what i got\ndone\nokay\nwhat what i love that how do you do that\nfor\nother people so if you're leading teams\nif you've got a small team a big team a\ncompany how do you kind of help people\nrealize the progress they're making\nyeah there's something you can do for\nyourself but yeah how do you do for\nothers\ni mean you could do it you can do a ver\nyou can do a version of what i'm talking\nabout for your for your team i mean what\ni would want to do is is i would want to\nget i would want to build that habit in\nothers rather than have them rely on me\nfor that i would want to build that\nhabit in others so what you could do is\nyou could have you could ask your team\nsend you that at the beginning not as a\nway to monitor them but as a way to\num\njust as a way to build that habit and\nthen eventually have them continue to\nhave it without sending it to you\num\nyeah absolutely i'm gonna try i'm\nactually gonna try that out i'm i'm 100\ngonna try that out what'd you get done\ntoday just write down the things you get\ndone\ni mean i mean it's a very simple concept\nwe always we often have a to-do list at\nthe beginning of the day\nlike have it done list at the end of the\nday and it's almost like gamifying your\nmind right because you know that if you\ngot three things done yesterday you\nmight want to get four done today so you\npush a bit further right i think a lot\nof times also when we're scrambling\naround we don't have a sense of what we\nwhat we've accomplished\nsometimes it can be and sometimes it can\nbe um\nit can be affirming so i know that many\ndays where i feel like i haven't gotten\nanything done during the course of a day\ni stop and i do my little progress\nritual again we're talking like\njake\n30 seconds yeah\nnot anything elaborate um i'm like oh\noh okay i actually got more done than\ntoday and then on the days where i\ndidn't get much done you're like oh come\non man you gotta you gotta do a little\nbit better than this come back yeah\nyou're coaching yourself you're coaching\nyourself yeah that's a good way to put\nit you're in many ways you are what\nyou're doing is you're just giving\nyourself you know you're coaching if you\nthink about it like a like a like a\nsport it's like like uh like in in in in\ntrack and field or in swimming or\nsomething like that your coach is there\nwith a stopwatch thing here was your\ntime today okay uh or you know here's\nhow much you lifted today um\nyou have a sense of you know are you\nmaking progress so you're not making\nprogress yeah one i love that one thing\ni want my audience everyone who's\nlistening right now or watching i want\nyou to be aware of is that\nliterally down in this book breaks down\neverything from like productivity i've\ndone some of the tests with you guys\nbefore and i've shared the book when we\ntalked about um\nyou know all of the different\nproductivity times for different types\nof people based on what time you sleep\nand what time you wake up the naps\nbreaks i'm not going to ask dan all\nthose questions because they're in the\nbook and that's why i recommend the book\ni i want to ask dan stuff that\nisn't in the book or is extending the\nbook and and par i think one of the\nbiggest questions i do get asked that\nthat i do want to talk about is\nrelationships because i think dating and\ngetting married\nand knowing when\nto either pop the question or when you\nshould expect the question like these\nare like these are like some of the\nbiggest challenges in the world for on a\npersonal individual level for people and\nso\ntell me about some of the work that you\nfound when it came to not just like\nwhen's the best time to get married but\nit's almost like when did people when\ndid or what did you find when people\nsaid they knew or they felt they'd found\nthe right person yeah that one is that\none is more inscrutable i have to say um\nuh i wrote about that only very very\ntentatively because i wasn't sure about\nthe the research and that i mean it you\nknow what what it says is that um\nin general\nin america\nmarriages are more likely to last if\npeople get married after age 25 and\nbefore age i think 34 somewhere around\nthere\nuh but again that doesn't mean if you\nget married at age 35 you're going to\nget a divorce you get married at 28 i\nmean it's just like there's a slight\nthere's a slight effect there uh there\nare some interesting effects on um\nespecially in america today uh people\nwith more formal education are more\nlikely to get married and stay married\nuh people with less formal education are\nless likely to get married and less\nlikely to stay married if they are\nuh and there's also seems to be an\neffect whatever your level of education\non getting married after you complete\nyour education rather than before but\nagain i don't think you take those large\npopulation\ninsights to make a decision about\nwhether you're going to spend the rest\nof your life with someone you love i can\nrecommend a book\nthat is um\nwell one of the leading scholars of of\nof marriage um\nreally the social psychology of marriage\nis at northwestern his name is eli\nfinkel uh he wrote a very good book\ncalled the all or nothing marriage about\nhow marriage has about how marriage has\nchanged uh\nso a lot of what we know about healthy\nmarriages and also how marriage has\nchanged in america over\nthe last uh 200 years it's a it's a\nreally really i it's a very very\ninteresting book all or nothing married\nyeah the all-in-one marriage by eli eli\nfinkel which uh and you know there's a\nlot of really good research uh in there\nand there there's some relationship\nadvice in there too um you know among\nthe most important things are\num\nyou know what do you attribute to\nsomeone's inherent personality and what\ndo you attribute to circumstance so if\nyou're so if your spouse snaps it you\nsay uh you say oh my god my spouse is\nthe biggest jerk there ever was or do\nyou say oh my spouse is having a bad day\nand people who make the attribution that\nit's circumstantial not surprisingly end\nup better off than people who\nsay you know attribute the behavior to\nsomeone's inner jerkiness\nright yeah no it would be fascinating\nalso to look at things like\namount of time couples spend together\nbut amount of time couples spend arguing\non useful arguments maybe two yeah yeah\nthere's other there's other there's\nother research out there right there's a\nguy i'm spacing on this there's a guy\nnamed gottman i think yeah john gottman\nyes yeah yeah yeah he's done some\nresearch on on marriage and you know one\nof the not this is not surprising one of\nthe biggest um\nthings that you see is\ni if i'm not if i'm characterizing it\nright is not arguing per se\nbut how people argue yes um and\num and so somebody has to do with the\nattribution the other thing one of the\nbiggest signals i think in gottman's\nresearch is\nuh when people express contempt for\ntheir partner not surprisingly that's a\nmarker of things gone awry adam i want\nto shift from like your mind and your\nideas and the way you think to\nhow you live can you take us through a\nday in the life of adam like how does it\nstart how does it end what does it look\nlike what's been your routine more\nrecently what are some things that\nyou've changed over time that have\nactually created momentum and\nacceleration so it's funny because my\nschedule is completely different than\ni'm sure yours in in most in general and\ni think this again becoming comfortable\nwith who you are this\nit was a process and i didn't have the\nability early on in the journey i do\nhave much more of an ability of it now\nbut i go to sleep at nearly four a.m\nevery day and i will wake up closer to\n11am so i think a lot of times they\nthink of entrepreneurs and people in my\nposition they think you're up at 5 or 6\na.m you're beating the sun but i'm the\nexact opposite and i found that\nmy greatest point of inspiration and joy\nis typically\nduring the night time when there's less\nactivity because i can focus on where we\nwant to go what we want to do and also\non myself and back to inherently knowing\nwho i was and my brother as well\nwe've known since we were 15 or 16 that\nthe the night schedule worked better for\nus but we didn't have an ability to\nimplement it because we were in high\nschool we were in college and then we're\nstarting the business you have to be on\nother people's more traditional\ni guess like calendar schedule and so\nas we got to higher levels we were able\nto continually shift it and obviously we\nhave people on our team that supplement\nthe early mornings and whatnot we worked\nthe late nights but\ni really embraced what my natural\npredisposition was for my schedule is\nthat and i knew that i would be better\nif i could operate on this schedule just\nlike morning people love to be up in the\nmorning i love to just push it as far as\ni can late into the night and i think\nthere's nothing wrong with it and a lot\nof times uh it doesn't get glorified\nbecause it's it's a difficult schedule\nit doesn't work for everybody it's it's\nnot essentially normal but for me it's\nbeen the absolute best thing and being\nable to\nbuild my schedule the way that i want i\nbelieve is the ultimate luxury because\nagain i've\nif you can control your time\nin and not necessarily what happens\nthroughout your time but\ncontrol how you allocate your time most\npeople would rather have ten minutes of\nyou at a hundred percent than three\nhours of you at twenty percent you can't\neven though you spend more time you\ncan't give them all of you and so one of\nthe things that i identified as i was\nbuilding\nmy schedule this way and really leading\ninto it is i can give people 100 of my\neffort when i'm on a schedule that\naligns with when i want to go to sleep\nand when i want to wake up and also when\ni want to work out if i can if i can\nanchor those specific things i can give\neverybody much more of myself in a\nshorter period of time and again like\ni've heard you speak about it before and\nyou said it beautifully and it's true\nlike\nmost of the people in your life jay they\nwould prefer for you to have be with\nthem for 10 minutes give them a hundred\npercent of jade it's an amazing\nexperience and for you to be sitting in\nthe room on your phone dozing off and\nnot giving them the energy that not only\nthey deserve but that you deserve to\ngive them and so i think that that's\nsomething that i identified through how\ni built my schedule now i mean i work\nout\nevery single day and i think that's for\nme it's a really important thing because\ndiscipline has been something that is\nbeen pivotal to our journey too and i\nbelieve that\nwith discipline if you anchor yourself\nthrough specific things it gives you\nmore freedom it's\ndiscipline is something that that opens\nyou up and gives you more opportunities\nfirst to be spontaneous more freedom is\nbecause you have clear pillars clear\nanchors it's like if you're playing a\nvideo game and you get to the checkpoint\nyou can be more brave in your action\nbecause you know you can always go back\nto the checkpoint so like that's the way\ni live my my day-to-day life i try to\nhave specific windows where i'll do\ncalls but then i leave everything else\nessentially open because i love i love\nthe chaos in a positive way and i love\nthe spontaneity in a positive way and i\nthink that um if for me at least this is\nthe way i found my schedule if it's too\nback to back to back to back and\nscheduled out there's no\nthere's no real opportunity for the\nspontaneous excitement which i think\nthat we all need to have in one way or\nanother and i don't think that it's the\nsame for everybody but i think that you\nhave to leave\nyourself the ability to discover\nsomething or to discover a relationship\nyou didn't think was gonna happen or a\npartnership you didn't think was gonna\nhappen or a friendship or things of that\nnature and i think that being able to\nanchor myself knowing i'm doing this\nthese few things that these few times\nleaving this window open um so that i\ncan try things and again like\nthe greatest opportunities i've ever had\nhave come from taking a chance on\nsomething and then\nanchoring it in the way that i i live my\nlife through my schedule and so\nagain it's it's something that i've had\nto work towards it wasn't like that on\nday one it's as you get further in the\njourney you hone it in more you have\nmore opportunity to try things and you\nhave more control i think like again one\nof the\nkey things for me in terms of success is\ncontrol over schedule and control over\ntime you don't get to you don't know how\nmuch time you have but if you can\ncontrol how you allocate that time\nthat's truly the greatest luxury and\nthat's something that i think is pivotal\nsuccess and i think again when we're\nthinking about our team in in\nspecifically in the headquarters\neverybody has different schedules\nbecause everybody works differently and\ni've seen how positive it's been for\nryan and i and so we try to translate\nthat to the team as well i love hearing\nabout how different your schedule is to\nmine because it still represents the\nsame thing to both of us\nso yeah you still have discipline you\nstill have focus you're still\nprioritized around when you can be\ncreative it's based on self-awareness\nand what's good for you and right for\nyou so the values that we're choosing\nour schedule on is the same like there's\na very similar value set\nand it just looks different and that's\nactually the beauty of life like that\nand i think that's where we go wrong\nwhere we go\nyou know in a few years people are going\nto be saying oh yeah i need to do what\nadam's doing i need to sleep at 4 00 a.m\nand you know wake up and it's like well\nthat's not really going to work or\npeople can be looking at going oh yeah i\nneed to wake up like a you know like i\nneed to go to sleep when jay doesn't\nwork and it's like well that's not\nreally what we're saying what we're\nsaying is\nif you're self-aware and you create\ndiscipline and rhythm in your life and\nspace for spontaneity then you've got to\nfigure out what works for you and where\nit works for you and so i love hearing\nhow different our schedules are because\nit just proves that there are multiple\nways that it can look\neven though there's a depth of why\nthey're created that way\nand in addition to that what i really\nappreciated you were talking about is\ni think we think of discipline as ease\nof either back to back\nand we think of laziness or spontaneity\nas completely free\nand what you've actually said is what\ndiscipline is is that you've created a\ndiscipline\nwhere you can be\nwhat i've been thinking about a lot\nlately is you can be effective and\nefficient\nand efficiency is often seen as\ndiscipline but efficiency means you do a\nlot of stuff\nbut effectiveness means you do important\nstuff\nand and i think that's what i'm seeing\nis missing in so many of our lives is\nthat we're trying to be efficient we do\nthe laundry do the dishes we spoke to\nthe team we check this off check this\noff check this off but then you're like\nwell i haven't had any creative\ninspiration today i haven't been\neffective\nand so i i really glad that you actually\nexplained discipline to be the meeting\nof efficiency and effectiveness together\ni mean i think you said it in an\nefficient and effective way\nuh the way that you just like\nillustrated what i was trying to to get\nacross but it's but it's true like i\nthink a lot of times people think of\ndiscipline as\nsomething that lacks freedom but\ndiscipline is the thread in the in the\nopportunity that gives you freedom and\nso i think and again you as you become\nmore efficient you can become more\neffective but it's hard to be effective\nif you're not efficient and so i think\nagain you you said it in an amazing way\nyou took a complex thing and you\ndigested it but it's it's been really\nparamount and i think it's something\nthat is is the way that my life has has\ngone in\nand again like i think that we have the\nsame theories you and i in terms of what\nwe want to accomplish\nfrom our day-to-day lives we do it at a\ndifferent time like i'm working out at\nmidnight you're doing things early in\nthe morning but it's we're looking to\nget the same type of result and i think\nagain when you were talking about being\nself-aware that is the absolute most\nimportant thing if you tried if i tried\nto work your schedule it wouldn't do the\nsame thing for me if you tried to do\nmine it wouldn't work but i think the\nfact that we've both been transparent\nhonest with ourselves and self-aware of\nwhat makes us show up as best as we\npossibly can and then that makes us\nbetter for other people and so i think\nfor us like that's that's the an\nincredible way to phrase it yeah and i\nand i respect and appreciate that in you\nso much because i think\nthere is a noise i mean i get different\nnoise so my noise is hey jay why don't\nyou hang out late like why don't you\ncome to this or what right and then your\nnoise is well if you're an entrepreneur\nwho's disciplined shouldn't you be\nwaking up earlier and you know and\nexactly and it's just really interesting\nhow like no matter what you do there's\ngoing to be someone who disagrees with\nit\nand and that's why it has and that's why\ni respect what you just shared so i'm so\nhappy to hear that you have this i had\nno idea that that was your schedule now\ni know when to spend time with you\nand\nuh you know and and i really like that\nbecause i really hope that everyone\nwho's listening\nyou're feeling more confident that\nyou're not doing it wrong\nif you're doing what's right for you but\nnotice that adam and i are still basing\nit on values of discipline of focus of\ncreativity it's not that adam's not just\nsaying i do whatever i want whenever i\nwant and there's not there's no\nstructure he still even has a sleep\nyou still have a sleep routine it sounds\nlike when you're like yeah 4am to 11am\nright there's still a routine and so\nthat's what i find is really healthy\nadam this has been\nso powerful because\nwhat i love about the way you talk about\nentrepreneurship\nis that it's strategic and intentional\nbut then there's the spontaneity and\ncreativity\nand i'm so excited to see what you\ncontinue to build it's you know you're\n12 years in\nand\ni cannot wait to see you just continue\nto crush i mean you're already crushing\nit but but for the business to continue\nto grow and grow and grow\ni wanted to ask you\nbefore we come to the final five around\ncreativity and innovation\nand you spoke about spontaneity they're\nmeeting someone random like bumping into\nan idea i love that so much\nwhat has been your secret to creativity\nand innovation where have you continued\nto find that\nthat discipline and that connection\nso i think one of our i guess one of our\ni don't know secrets is the right word\nbut\nagain back to my brother like the fact\nthat there's two of us and that we're\nable to go through life\ntogether and we've had similar\nexperiences\ni mean my brother like to to be fully\ntransparent is more creative than i am\nand like when we're thinking of color\nstories and whatnot ryan's always\nbuilding these beautiful color stories\ncody who's our design director is\namazing jake and he's our content\ndirector he's incredible sam who heads\nup social she's\nshe's amazing as well and just the whole\nteam like it's i could go on and on but\none of the things that i discovered and\nthis actually came from my mom\nso\nuh\nand you wouldn't know it based on what\nmy life has become\nbut until i was\nlike 25 years old i'm 34 now so no maybe\neven older this is like 2013.\nuntil but let's use 25 as the number\nuntil i'm 25 years old i hardly have\never left the country i left the country\none time twice actually i went to mexico\none time and i went to london one time\nand it's like each one was for two days\nand then when i'm\n25 my mom\nbasically says like you guys need to do\nmore and see more things you need to\ndiscover more things because we were so\nlaser focused on what we're going to do\nso a lot of the things that i've\nreflected on today with uga is things\ni've learned more specifically over the\nlast six or seven years in terms of like\nthe spontaneity the freedom and i've\nalways had the discipline but it was\nalmost at a level that was too high and\nso my mom\nhad said you need to they were going to\nhong kong and she was it was for this\nwedding she's like you need you need to\ncome like it's an old family friend you\nhave to come to this wedding and i had\nno intention of of traveling overseas\nlong story short i end up ryan and i end\nup going it's the most incredible trip\num just like going outside of the\ncountry seeing something completely\ndifferent changing our perspective and\nwhen we're there we get inspired by this\nbridge and this bridge that never i'd\nnever seen pictures of it anything we\nget inspired by this bridge we end up\ncreating a shoe based on this we end up\ngoing to another another country visit\nyears later inspired by that and so i\nthink that\ntravel allowed us to change our point of\nview change our perspective when you're\nthinking of creativity a lot of times\nthere's things in your day-to-day life\nthat when you're thinking about\nrepetition you don't pay attention to it\nbecause it comes\nalmost a second nature it's reoccurring\nbut when you go to a new place\neverything is new you have to pay\nattention to your surroundings because\nit's uncomfortable not necessarily\nnegative way but in a positive way you\nget all of the stimulation through your\nsenses you're seeing things you're\nmeeting people and so\nwhen i when my mom pushed me out of my\ncomfort zone then it\ncompletely changed the way that i was\nviewing the world and it made it so that\ni was much more open to\nreceiving what the world had been just\npushing what i wanted to do or what the\nintention was and so i think like that\nmade it so um it's kind of like\ni don't know if you remember on the old\ncell phone signals when you would make\nit a call going out would be like an\narrow pushing like this but when\nsomeone's sending you a message it's\ngoing both ways and so that's kind of\nwhat that calibration did to how we\ndiscover creativity and now like\none of the things the greatest things\nthat inspires me is movement whether\nit's movement in cars movement on foot\nmovement in the air and so i think like\nmovement in general changing your\nsurroundings not necessarily going to\nanother country or another state but\neven going\nanywhere just discovering i think the\nopportunity for for movement that's\nreally where like the creativity came\nfor us and then again i think that\nif you can take an idea lean into it and\nsee like and speak to why this makes you\nfeel different you'll find inspiration\nin it and i think that for us like we\nhave we have an incredible team that\nfinds inspiration in different places\nand then we're able to talk about it and\nthe greatest thing you can do is be a\ngreat communicator because if you can\narticulate what your vision is and\nwhether that's through verbal whether\nit's through art whether it's through\nanything people will understand and\npeople will feel it not everybody will\nbut some people will and i think like\nthat's one of the things that's gone\nreally really far for us is that we've\nbeen able to take these\nuh inspirational things like our\nstreamlined shoe which is my favorite\none is inspired by japanese souffle\npancakes from when ryan and i were in\ntokyo and like ryan's obsessed with them\nand but we took that and we and we made\nit into a shoe and so it's like you\nnever know where the inspiration is\ngoing to come from but if you allow\nyourself to re receive it\nyou can get it and i think like that's\nsomething that a lot of people don't\nthink of they think they have to put it\nout there and push it but a lot of times\njust receiving what's around you will\ngive you a lot of inspiration into what\nyou should do i am so glad i asked you\nthat question i was about to not ask you\nthat question but i am so happy and even\nthough you're giving of course which is\nwonderful to hear the credit to your\nteam and your brother for being the cr\nyou know creative ones but the fact that\nyou've been able to observe that and see\nthat that's where it's come from and the\nexample from your mother too i i love\nthat adam\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love you'll get to\nwhere you want in life just not in the\nway you imagined and that's because\nthe path that's paved up and down is far\ndifferent to the path we paid"
