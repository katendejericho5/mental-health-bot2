    "transcript": "if you are getting\ncrazy nervous on a date\nyou're already\nthat's already a reflection of the fact\nthat you've valued the wrong things one\nof the biggest problems is people\nfalling for people really quickly yes\nfalling in love too fast\nwhere\nit's because they went on a couple of\ngreat dates with a guy\nand they can look at the date and go\nhe was amazing and you you should have\nseen what he did and how he was on the\ndate and all of that and the thing i\nhave to always break down is\nthat may not have been about you\nit is about something he wanted you to\nfeel\nby the end of the date and\nnot that\nyou know\nyou i i'm a i kind of loathe this\nculture we have right now where\neveryone's a narcissist yes like we\ncaught we're so quick to like label yeah\nhe's a narcissist she's a narcissist\nlike i'm like not ever like\nwe all have a narcissistic streak\nabsolutely and we all exhibit\nnarcissistic behaviors at times that\ndoesn't mean we're a diagnosable\nnarcissist\nbut a narcissistic streak we all have\nearly in dating and to differing degrees\nis\nthe desire to\nimpress yes rather than connect\nand so we go on a date with someone and\nyou know at the height of it if\nsomeone's really on the extreme end they\nwill give the greatest date of someone's\nlife yeah and that person goes away and\nthey're like this guy is amazing or this\nperson\nand\nthey they may have put on an amazing\ndate but you you know nothing yet\nand what's cool about your wife's you\nknow\ngoing through that process with you is\nyou know i can imagine for her it's\nalmost like\nwell i want to see how you are in week\nfour yeah or i want to see how you are\nin month three yeah or and until you've\nbeen there\nyou really don't know how great of a\npartner somebody is gonna be yeah and\nthat that's what i mean by you know when\nyou ask me about what i've really\nlearned about love and and i talked\nabout valuing the wrong things that's\none of the big ways that it shows up if\nyou are getting\ncrazy nervous on a date\nyou're already\nthat's already a reflection of the fact\nthat you've valued the wrong things\nbecause you're valuing this person's\nlooks\nor their status\nor what you perceive them to be\nbut you can't you're not valuing them in\na relationship or in relation to you\nwhich is defined by how much they give\nhow they connect with you how they\nrelate to you how they see you yeah all\nof that stuff is it completely is you're\na zero yeah\nso how can you be nervous if you're\nvaluing the right things you can only be\nnervous if you're valuing the wrong\nthings\nif that to me is the key to eliminating\nearly nerves in early dating\nis that there is i almost feel a little\nfatalistic about it which is funny\ncoming from someone who\ngives advice in this area for a living\nbecause\nyou know i i do believe that we can\ninfluence situations with\nwhat we do but\nwe do have to have a bit of a dose of\nfatalism that the thing that didn't pan\nout wasn't the thing\nthe person who's still great in week\neight\nis showing you the right things\nbut if they suddenly ghost you in week\nnine\nthen it doesn't mean they would have\nbeen great in week 16. yeah yeah yeah\nthey're like oh but they were the one\nand i just i don't know what i need\nclosure you have closure\nthat action was closure what they showed\nyou is they had eight good weeks in them\nyeah\nthat's interesting yeah that's\ninteresting it's it's and it's the same\nas you'd say in sport\nlike if you if you i'm just i was just\nthinking about sport while you were\nsaying that it's the idea of like a\nplayer may have one good season in him\nor her\nand then that player may have had 10\ngood seasons in him or her and sometimes\nwe have these players where we're like\noh she's going to be the next or he's\ngoing to be the next and then all of a\nsudden they don't give you that season\nand in sports we get closure by just\ngoing all right they had potential but\nthey didn't make it but you're right in\nlove and life it's a lot hard to have\nthat mentality of like they gave me\neight good weeks but\nthey didn't make it well you and you sit\nthere and you obsess over someone who\njust left you\ngoing you obsess over what they could\nhave been yeah\nthat's what it is could have you know\nthis was so promising\nthey were everything that i was looking\nfor this could have been and anytime you\nyou someone breaks up with us\nyou know the heartbreak is the loss of\nthe life we thought we were going to\nhave\nwith someone this is this is what it\ncould have been this is what it should\nhave been yeah and my answer to that is\nit would have been if it should have\nbeen and could have been yeah then it\nwould have been you're literally\nyou're grieving over\nsomething that\nwas not it by definition it wasn't meant\nto happen because it didn't happen yes\nyeah yeah it didn't happen so this idea\nthat it it was supposed to or it should\nhave\nis\nis myth\nfantasy it's science fiction yeah but i\nfeel like in relationships we have this\nfantasy mind that's already written the\nscript and the book\nand the trilogy\nbefore\nthe second date is over and so it's\nalmost like relationship seems to be\nlike the one area of our life where we\nwrite\ndecades into the future\nand we can't help ourselves because we\nalmost think that that and it's almost\nlike you're living what you're saying is\nyou're living off the fantasy not even\nof the reality that's right in front of\nyou and so even when you're on a date\nwith them you're not even there because\nyou're in your fantasy land and of what\nyou think it is and that's where\nin in so many ways everything that you\nare you know your expertise in\nmindfulness and everything you've\nlearned there\nis so\nimportant in dating\nbecause in dating you have to\nbe on the date you're on\nmindful dating is be on the date you're\non don't be on date two\nbut really you're not you're on date 32.\nyeah\ndon't your mind has to be on date two\nwith your body yes\nand when people don't do that\nthat's where they start\nthey start constructing a fantasy of\nwhere this relationship is going\na fantasy of who this person is they\nknow five percent of someone and they've\nbuilt the other 95 out of\nextrapolation yeah oh he was really\nsweet in that moment you know obey's\ngood with kids i basically i base that\nhe's you know he's an amazing family man\na bit you know and\nand we've all had the experience of\nmeeting someone who is incredibly\ncharming\nfun to be around you know you went away\nfrom like as men we sometimes go out and\nwe meet another man and it's like we've\nbeen a date on a date with that man and\nyou come home and you go he was so great\nyou know i loved him to bits he was\nand he really charmed you\nand then six months later the\nthat person has really lost their shine\nyeah because\nthey're flaky\nyou realize they don't actually show up\nwhen when you need them to\nyou realize that it's they they kind of\nyou know it's that the in the talented\nmr ripley there's that great line that's\na great movie great movie there's a\ngreat line where matt damon is like you\nknow he's become the new chosen best\nfriend of of um jude lloyd's character\nuh his name jude lord's character's name\nis dickie and matt matt damon is is\nfeeling suddenly shut out like out of\nnowhere he feels shut out when five\nminutes ago he was like this guy's my\nbest friend and he loves me and he's so\nand he says to matt damon's girlfriend\nat the time\nhe he's expressing how he feels that it\nyou know or no he's not even expressing\nshe sees the look on his face\nthat he's sad that he no longer has this\nlike friendship that feels real to him\nand she says the thing about dickie is\nwhen when he puts his attention on you\nit's like the sun is shining on you\nand then\nthe attention moves on and it's very\ncold yeah and\nand that's the experience of a lot of\nthose people but when you're taking the\nfive percent of the sun shining on you\nand you use it to build the 95 percent\nthat you cannot possibly know you can't\nknow who this person is when your\nbrother gets sick and\nyou need to travel to the hospital to be\nwith that person and you need support in\nthat moment you can't know how that\nperson is when you're having an anxious\nmoment and you need someone to show love\nand compassion towards you and this\nanxiety that you can't seem to control\nand what you really need is a loving\nteammate to be there with you and not to\njudge you you can't know what this\nperson is like in year three of a\nrelationship when the you know you need\nto make a shift in your sex life because\nit feels like that part has become staid\nbut you need to work together to figure\nout you don't know what that person is\nlike in those stages so\nso thinking that you have all the\nanswers because you've been on\neven 10 or 15 dates with this person and\nhad a wonderful time\nis a is a fallacy a fantasy\nthere's a great um\nthe the relationship itself is about\nevery stage of it and the effort that's\nput in and there's a\nthere's a story from bukowski where he\nhe slept with a prostitute every\nromantic story begins with\nbegins this way\nhe's lived with a prostitute and she um\nhe woke up to her having stolen his\npoetry\nand he was so upset so mad terrible yeah\nand\num he wrote about it and he wrote a\npiece that was all about how you could\ntake anything take my money take the\nother stuff in the in the apartment take\nit all but please\nnot my anything but my poetry and the\nwhole\npiece finishes with the line and then\ngod said crossing his legs i see where i\nhave created a great many poets but not\nso very much poetry\nand the\nthe idea is that\nyou know the person who has potential in\na relationship is the poet\nthe poet everyone's a poet\nnot many people writing poetry yeah\nwriting is the more difficult part a lot\nof people who are great on a date very\nromantic very charming they're a poet on\na date\nthe poetry is the relationship\nand and you shouldn't you know bukowski\nwas upset because his poetry was taken\nthe thing he'd worked on\nand\nthat's how it should be in a\nrelationship is\ndon't don't get upset\nbecause you lost a poet poets are a dime\na dozen\npoetry\nis rare\npeople who are willing to write the\npoetry of a relationship people who are\nwilling to stick it with you for a year\ntwo years five years 10 years\nthat's really rare and and we need to\nstart valuing the poetry far more than\nwe value the poet yeah i love that what\na beautiful analogy let's let's talk a\nbit about that poetry because i feel\nlike\nwhat's amazing is we convince ourselves\nmore of the fiction when you\nare lusting after that person's\nlooks fame\nprestige whatever whatever they have\nthat you're attracted to it's almost\nlike then even if they do a million bad\nthings like you said about the guy\nplaying the guitar or whatever it is\nit's like you're like oh but he's so or\nshe's so whatever but\ntell us a bit about what to look out for\nso when people are out there and i know\nwhat i love about what you do is that\nand i love this conversation by the way\nso far because\nit's it's\nit's philosophical and it's\nreal but you're great at getting\npractical too and i see that in all the\nwork you put out what's some of the\npractical things that people can look\nout for i know so many friends who are\nin early relationships or\njust started to date someone or finally\nmet someone what can they look for\nin those moments or is it looking for\nanything i mean maybe that's even the\nwrong place to start i think it's so\nwe have a duty early on to bring our\nbest to the table in as much as we can\nwe're all going to make mistakes we're\nall going to have\nanxious moments or jealous moments or\nmoments where we let our insecurity get\nthe better of us moments where we let\nour\nanger get the better of us\neveryone's going to have these moments\nbut\nwe want to try and put our best foot\nforward\nbut i always\nthink that we learn a lot in the moments\nwhere you have your\nfirst fight\nor you\nreveal something about yourself\nand you see how they react\nto it\nyou know do they react with compassion\nor is there immediate judgment\nand and and i don't mean a moment where\nyou kind of\ntry and perform yeah i mean a moment\nwhere you genuinely\nare brave enough\nto let someone in and be seen yes\ndoes this person\ndo they see you\ndo they acknowledge you\nand do they show compassion and\ncuriosity about why you are that way and\nwhat's happened in your life to get you\nthere do they really are they looking to\nfigure you out and who you are is a\nwonderful wonderful sign because a lot\nof people are just in a relationship and\nthey're sleepwalking yeah they're just\nthey're they're enjoying it they're\nenjoying the fruits of the relationship\nbut you don't get the impression\nsomeone's really trying to get to know\nyou you don't feel seen by that person\nthe person who's actually asking\nquestions of you\nthe person who's looking to understand\nthe good and the bad in you\nand who elevates the good\nand soothes the bad\nthat's\nsomething very beautiful to look out for\nthe person who can come back and say\nsorry\nas of course and i apply the same\nstandard to to both sides yeah of course\nbut the person who can who can come back\nand say sorry you know again\nwe we all when i'm when with one of my\nstaff in my company when i say\nyou know when i give them a difficult\npiece of feedback\ni don't expect them to smile in that\nmoment yeah i don't expect them to like\ntake you know in i would hope that they\ndon't react in a really negative or\ntoxic way but i don't expect them to\nhave an easy time with that\nbut if that person can go away over the\nnext few hours or days and then come\nback and say you know i really thought\nabout what you said and i'm gonna work\non that\nthat's something to look for because you\ncan really like that person if you're\nboth that kind of person\nyou can work with\nthat person yeah that's someone you can\ngenuinely have a relationship with\nbecause it's not a relationship that's\nbased on perfection or never having an\nargument but it is based on two people\nwho are humble enough\nto genuinely own\ntheir mistakes\nor to own the areas where they want to\nget better\ni'm always looking at the ways people\nargue\nand whether they\nwhether they're trying to do damage in\nan argument yeah or whether they're\ntrying to rebuild in an argument and if\nyou're with someone that\nevery time you come out of an argument\nyou feel like they lacerated you\nand there's\nyou come out of an argument bleeding\nevery time\nyou know and you're like\nthat why did they have to say that\nincredibly nasty\nthing\nand it's one thing if they come back 10\nto an hour later and say or even a day\nlater and say i truly regret having said\nthat to you and i will do better\nbut if they weren't even acknowledged\nthat that was a really toxic way to have\nan argument and that was a really nasty\nthing to say\nthen that's a problem\nbecause this is a relationship that's\nnot going to soothe you yeah it's going\nto create more and more wounds\nso that i would say is an important\nthing and and two people genuinely\ngenuinely at the core of it operating as\na team what do you\nwhat do you need and can i tell you you\nknow you're working really hard right\nnow\ncan i\nunderstand what your goal is in doing\nthis and seek to understand that\nand where that's coming from for you and\nwhy that's important\nbut can i also voice to you\nthat\ni'm not feeling very loved right now and\nthat i'm i you know maybe is just my\ninsecurity or maybe that you know but i\nor maybe i don't have some enough as\nmuch many things going on in my life\nright now as you do in yours but i know\none of the effects is it's creating some\nanxiety for me and it's making me feel\nlike you don't love me as much as i love\nyou you know it you want an environment\nwhere you can have that real\nconversation\nand it it then to me a relationship is\nno longer about\nright and wrong it's about the\nconversation\ncan the conversation be had\nthat to me is one of the greatest signs\nof a relationship you should hang on to\nyeah is can the relationship be had\nand can it be had in a beautiful and\nproductive and loving way yeah because\nthat's all that you know um david brooks\nsaid marriage is a 50-year conversation\nright\nis that conversation\ndoes it feel good yeah doesn't always\nfeel comfortable but does it feel like\nthis is a conversation that is making me\nbetter yeah or is it a conversation\nthat's always making me worse yeah i\nlove that and and i think it's it's such\na vicious cycle though sometimes because\ni find that\nyou get into an argument like you said\nwhich i think the first argument is such\na great uh\nlike it's such a great marker to put\ndown as let's let's reflect on this i\nthink that's such a great way of putting\nit that you said and if you look at that\noften what happens is the person reacts\nbadly it's natural you react badly too\nand then you're waiting for that person\nto make up and that person's waiting for\nyou to make up and then maybe you go\nahead and put the first hand in but then\nnow they deal with the second bad and\nnow you're waiting again and i feel like\nwe get lost in this like\nwaiting game and i kind of got to a\npoint where i was just like i want to\nmake sure that i am leading this\nconversation so a conversation with me\nand my wife always have is i'll always\ncheck in with her and be like is this\nrelationship going in the direction you\nwant it to go in like is this going in\nthe direction is this relationship what\nyou want it to be and if it's not what\ndo you want it to be and what are you\nwilling to do to get there because and\ni'll always be like well this is not how\ni want the relationship to be and this\nis what i wanted to be and i felt like\nthat conversation for me is really\nhealthy\nand i'm always happy one thing that i've\ngot to right now and i think my wife has\nthis in different parts of our\nrelationship i'm always happy to take\nthe responsibility for the quality of\nthe relationship because i'm in it in\nthe same way as i'm with my company in\nthe same way as i'm for this podcast the\nsame as them for anything it's like it's\neasy to\nit's easy to sit there and go well what\nare you bringing to the table\nand and i realized at one point where i\nwas like if i care about stuff i've got\nto be okay\nwith\ngrabbing onto the reins and the funny\nthing is i started to realize that that\nactually there are plenty of times when\nmy wife does that she just does it in\ndifferent areas that i don't notice and\nso it can feel like i'm carrying the\nburden\nbut actually that's not true i'm i'm\ntaking responsibility where i thrive and\nactually she's taking responsibility\nresponsibility where she thrives and i\ndon't even notice that and that's when i\nstarted to feel healthier rather than\nlike i was like well where you show up\nlike what are you doing\nand uh i remember\nwhen i was a monk the the teachers would\nalways tell us that you know\nyou may sit in a class with a\nnon-charismatic teacher so they were\nlike some of the monks are not gonna be\nthe most charismatic the most\nattentive the most like dynamic teachers\nof the the the text and the spiritual\nscriptures and they were like but if\nyou're a student that's ten out of ten\neven if the speakers are one out of ten\nin presentation you're going to get lots\nbut if you're a one out of ten and the\nspeaker's ten out of ten then they're\nlifting you up but by the way if you're\nat a one out of ten and they're at a one\nout of ten that's all you're gonna get\nand it's kind of like what your friend\nsaid about the bag of milk you know the\nidea the idea of like taking your own\nresponsibility for if you want to be in\na relationship\ni'd love to hear your thoughts on that\nyeah but that speaks again\nyou're so right jay and it's\ntruly beautiful that you have that in\nyour relationship and it's and it's also\nbrave\nbecause talking those conversations are\nnot easy\nthey and people can say things in those\nrelationship in those conversations that\ncan scare us they could say well i'm not\nhappy because i want it to go in this\ndirection yeah i've heard that too yeah\nlike you know or i didn't realize you\nwere unhappy in that way or i didn't\nrealize you felt like that though it\ntakes a lot of bravery to have\nconversations like that and i commend\nyou for that and i and i think\nthat's one of the things a lot of people\naren't willing to do is step bravely\ninto an area where they could be\ncriticized\num\nbut i i think it is one of the most\nimportant aspects\nof a relationship is being able to do\nexactly that so no i think it's i think\nit's a stunning thing well it's\nuncomfortable like you're saying it's\nnot and and i'm not sharing is like\nwe've perfected and we've got it right\ni'm just saying that that's what we've\nhad to do\nin order to like you know we're only at\nyear five year eight in our relationship\nyeah five in marriage\nbut it's like that's what we've just\ni've had to find these\nwhat you're saying like the 50-year\nconversation and the idea you're saying\nof having these like i'm just i've\nnoticed that without these things you\ncould go years without changing anything\nbut speaking of what you said with the\nthe idea of the monks\nthat to me goes back to the\nyou know what i was saying about timing\nbeing important yeah i do believe when\nyou go into a relationship with genuine\npurpose\nand even when you go into dating with\ngenuine purpose you you know you go on a\ndating app because a lot of people out\nthere listening to this won't be in\nrelationship they'll be\nright now in the crapshoot of dating\napps trying to figure out how to\nnavigate\nwhen we're intentional\nwe bring a different energy\nto the things we do\nwe bring a different energy to a person\nand in a relation in early dating i\nthink that when you're really\nintentional and when you really\nare like i'm looking for a real\nconnection here you don't actually judge\npeople as quickly yeah you don't dispose\nof people\nas quickly where you just go wrong wrong\nwrong wrong wrong wrong wrong you you\nstart actually looking for what could be\nright you start and i'm not saying\nignoring abusive and toxic behavior i'm\njust saying\nthose superficial things we just\nyou know decide no they don't meet this\nchecklist they don't meet this one or\nwhatever we lose that because what we're\nlooking for is\nis deeper and we start genuinely seeking\nto like we're on a date and we start\ngoing let me really find out who this\nperson is yeah like let me really see\nthem and let me\nnot be judgmental of them so quickly and\nand look to understand them and the\nthe reward for that is that this person\nnow actually feels seen by you yeah\nthat's great advice and they now give\nyou a different energy than they may\nhave given on the last 10 days yeah you\nsuddenly they blossom on the date\ndifferently\nbecause of the energy in front of them\nthere's a\nmitch album wrote a line about you know\nif the culture isn't serving you\nthen you have to be brave enough to\ncreate your own culture\nand in dating\nfor so many people i you know i get all\nthe complaints about dating these days\nyou know it's superficial it's no one\neveryone's flaky no one goes on real\ndates no one's trying no one's really\ncommitting no one wants a real\nrelationship it's like okay so what\nyou're describing to me is what you\nperceive to be a culture yeah that's not\nworking for you yeah\nbut if that culture isn't serving you\nthen create your own\nculture that surrounds you\nand\nand your culture it can be powerful not\nfor the world necessarily because in for\nthat there needs to be a combined\ncultural shift but in your\nmicro\nlife in your micro problems and\nopportunities the culture you create\nwill have\nan impact on the people around you yeah\nand it the same way you know i said\nif you go into a room at a party and you\nsay i hope this part is good\nwell now you're a victim to however this\nparty is yeah you know if everyone seems\nkind of closed off and mean and\nyou know there's cliquey and it's like\noh god then\nyou go home and you say oh my god that\nparty was so you know it was one of\nthose horrible parties but if you go in\nand you say\ni'm gonna at the very least be\nresponsible\nfor a part of this party yes i'm gonna\ngo in and i'm gonna give the love and\nthe energy and the and the and the\ncompassion and the authenticity that i\nwould love for people in this room to\njoin me in giving some will some won't\nand by the way that's also good because\nit'll help you find your crowd right\nyeah so you you find your crowd by being\nthe thing you want to be not by hoping\nthat your crowd elicits it from you\ncompletely you found your crowd online\nby going out and being an energy that\nyou wanted to be first\nand then that crowd noticed you it's\nlike a lighthouse all the ships start\nknowing where to come home\nbecause they see the you know they see\nthe lighthouse that\nthat\nfor me is\nthat's one of the most beautiful things\nabout giving energy early on i see\ndating you know not just relationships\nbut i see people in dating these days\nit's the game is who can try less\nwho can be cooler who can be more\nindifferent and\nand that's honestly not the way to do it\nthat's certainly the way to attract\nsomeone\nof a lower frequency i love that yeah\nright you can certainly attract someone\nwho wants the game who wants the who's\ngot the demons that make them chase\nsomeone who's not into them yeah you\nknow\nand there are plenty of people with\nthose demons but you don't want to be in\na relationship with a person like that\nbecause\nfor sure a person like that the moment\nyou stop playing hard to get and you\nturn around to meet them they're not\ngoing to be interested in you anymore\nbecause their demons will tell them this\nperson likes us now\nthey're not they this person is no\nlonger cool to us yeah they were only\ncalled to us as long as they didn't like\nus\nso you can't ever so messed up yeah but\nit's you know it's that uh\nthat kraut tower marks thing i wouldn't\nwant to be a member of any club that\nwould have me as a member yeah that\ndescribes\ndating insecurity amongst people like\nthat is i wanna that person doesn't want\nme they must be a catch yeah yeah yeah\nyeah exactly and and so\nwhat we have to do is give\nwhen we give a little more energy in\ndating\nand say you know what this person who\ni've known for five minutes\nmaybe\ni'm not feeling much energy here but i'm\njust going to give some energy\ni'm going to give an amount of energy\ni'm willing to lose right that's a key\nway of looking at it yeah what you don't\ndo is you keep trying with someone who's\nnot giving you equal energy back that's\nthat then becomes masochistic right\nbut giving an amount of energy you're\nwilling to lose i always think about\nthat in every interaction that's so true\nyeah given amount you don't mind losing\nyeah it's like going into the casino and\nplaying like roulette it's like all\nright i'm in vegas i'll give like a\nhundred bucks yeah and then i'm not\nspending anything else here in these\ncasinos that's it yeah you know for me\nit's normally like ten bucks because i\njust i i'm not a gambler but you just\ndecide what am i happy to lose and it's\nthe same with energy it's you know i'm\ndating right now i want to find someone\namazing someone beautiful\ni'm going to give to everyone i interact\nwith an amount of energy i don't mind\nlosing\nand some people i'm going to i'm going\nto\nbring out the people who\nwho now are willing to give it back\nbecause all of a sudden they'll they\nmight be jolted out of their little coma\nthat they've been in because they're\ndisillusioned with dating and they feel\nlike no one's trying and so they went\ninto their shell but they now they see\nyou with a different level of warmth and\nplayfulness and and and just positivity\nand they go\nhuh who is this this makes me feel good\nand then they come out a little bit and\nall of a sudden you see who they are you\nwake them up a little bit and then\nthere's a bunch of people you won't and\nthat's okay because you were willing to\nlose that much energy yeah but what\npeople do instead they do a far more\ndangerous thing of being\nafraid of the rejection\nfrom people that they approach or talk\nto in the first five minutes god forbid\ni get rejected in the first five minutes\nbut then they'll meet someone where they\nhave a bit of connection and chemistry\nbut who isn't trying who isn't giving\nthem equal energy\nand they'll keep pouring energy into\nthat person\nmonth after month after month when\nthey're not getting the same in return\nyeah and they think that's safer\nthan going out there and getting\nrejected by a new person yeah but\nactually this is the dangerous one yes\nthey're being rejected in five minutes\nby someone who doesn't even know you who\nwho on an app how much can someone\nreally reject you anyway yeah and we all\nknow our experience we've all chosen\npeople in life who on an app we might\nhave swiped right past absolutely right\nso we know from our own personal\nexperience that if we get rejected on an\napp it doesn't even mean that person\nwouldn't like us in real life totally\nyeah but\nwe're so afraid of that rejection that's\nmortal fear is that rejection and yet\ncontinuing to waste months or years on\nsomeone who's who's giving us unequal\nenergy\nis something people happily do they\nspend that time like it's nothing\nbecause that's the reason because it\nfeels safe because it feels like there's\nsomething at least there's some\nconnection there's some comfort well\nthere's a couple of things it's firstly\nit's comfortable right it's what i know\ndoesn't mean i'm happiness and comfort\nvery different things it's not happy i'm\nnot happy i'm not getting my needs met\nbut it's comfortable yeah right so i'll\nstay in it for that reason\nit's the fear of i'll never find anyone\nagain\nwhich is a fallacy because you found\nthis person yeah you did it already yeah\nyeah you know and by the way this\nperson's not so unique that they're the\nonly person in the world that's going to\nfind you attractive yeah yeah right like\nthey're attracted to you because you're\nattractive yeah but that's the crazy\nthing right we have this massive paradox\nbetween\nthere's now unlimited choice more than\never you feel like you have way more\nchoice than you had before but then we\nhave\nlimitless fear to go with that that we\nmay not find anyone ever again yeah i\ntalk in the book about the difference\nbetween idiot compassion and wise\ncompassion i love that yeah tell us\nabout it so idiot compassion is what our\nfriends do it's like you know someone\nbreaks up with you and you're like oh he\nwas a jerk even though we know that like\nthis has happened the last three times\nbecause there's certain ways you behave\nin the relationship that lead to this\noutcome or you know you didn't get the\npromotion you wanted and we know why\nthat happened because it keeps happening\nto you and we say oh your boss is\ndoesn't see your talent when we really\nknow what's going on but we don't want\nto rock the boat we think we're being\nsupportive\nbut it's not really supportive and so\nyou know it's kind of like if a fight\nbreaks out in every bar you're going to\nit might be you but we don't we don't\nsay that that's idiot confession right\nwise compassion is holding up that\nmirror but the clear mirror not the\ndusty mirror and it's holding up that\nmirror and saying i'm gonna help you to\nlook at yourself in a way that maybe you\nhaven't been willing or able to see\nand i think you're gonna\nlike what you see because it's going to\nhelp you navigate through the world\nin a much smoother way yeah and maybe\nyou will have to make some changes which\npeople uh you know people usually come\ninto therapy and they're like i want\nthings to change and what they want to\nchange is someone else or something else\nthey don't realize that they are going\nto have to make some changes yeah and i\nand i want to say like you're the\nprotagonist in the story you're going to\nhave to make some changes yeah\nabsolutely and one of the things i think\nwe struggle with that is\ni was talking about this with a friend\nthe other day we were on a walk and we\nwere saying that\nshe was being really vulnerable and open\nshe's amazing i know she listens to the\npodcast you know who you are\nit's\nher name\nbut it's\nit's the feeling of we want people to be\nhonest with us\nbut we struggle to be honest with people\nyeah so it's a weird like\nit's a weird circle because we it's like\nme saying lori i want you to be really\nhonest with me about how this podcast is\ngoing but then when my friend asked me\nhow their podcast is going i'm not\ntelling them the truth yeah but i'm\nexpecting you to tell me the truth yeah\nand so almost we become demanders of the\ntruth but not givers of and then that\ncontinues that circle if that makes\nsense\nand so how how do we actually open\nourselves up to create space for\nfriendships like that because i almost\nthink in the same way as you're saying\nwe're creating those scenarios in our\nlife again at work or in relationships\nyeah we are inviting idiot compassion\ninto our life that's right because we're\nnot ready for it almost right right we\nhave to be able to hear it i see this so\nmuch with couples that i see so a lot of\ntimes um you know somebody will say and\ni see this most typically in like a\nheterosexual couple where uh the woman\nsays to the man i want you to be really\nvulnerable with me i want to understand\nyour inner life i want you to open up to\nme\nand then he does and he starts crying\nand she is frozen you know she's like\nwell i you know be careful what you're\nnot this one right yeah i didn't i\ndidn't mean like that\n[Laughter]\nright or if someone's like or if the\nthing that they're being truthful about\nis something about something going on\nbetween the two of you\nand people are so afraid to share that\nso maybe they'll be open about something\nout there but if it's like there's\nsomething i want to talk to you about us\nand the person says yeah i want to hear\ni want you to be really open and honest\nwith me until you really say i notice\nthis happens between us and here's\nsomething about you\nand the person's like whoa i didn't want\nto hear that\nright so we're so uncomfortable with\nother people's truth\nyou don't have to agree with somebody\nelse's\nfeelings but you have to know that their\nfeelings are valid which doesn't mean\nthat you have the same feelings there's\na distinction it's almost like the\ndifference between\nwhen somebody really wants someone to\nforgive them and i always say like\nthere's a woman in the book she wants\nher adult children to forgive her for\nwhat she had done their estranged from\nher they\nand i said you know what you can't\nyou're asking for something called\nforced forgiveness\nthat that people are not going to\nforgive you because it will make you\nfeel better\nand sometimes not forgiving is okay it's\nokay if your children never forgive you\nmaybe they will have compassion for you\nmaybe they will see you\nas the mother\nthat they want now even though you\ncouldn't be that then\num we have to learn how to forgive\nourselves\nbut so many times if someone says i'm\nreally upset about this we say we want\nto hear that\nbut we don't know\nhow to\num how to let it in how to be open to it\nyeah and how do you in the\nin the therapy room and in your life and\nwhen you're advising people\npeople live or sometimes we assume that\npeople live very problem driven lives so\nwhen they come and see you they feel\nthey have to start with a problem\nyeah or sometimes when you see a friend\nyou feel like you have to share\nsomething that's going wrong for there\nto be a conversation i feel like almost\nproblems and wrongs have become better\nconversation starters or more i would\nsay more comfortable conversation\nstarters for people as opposed to\nsomething positive do you see that a lot\nis that you know what's so interesting i\nthink that we have this weird dichotomy\nwhere\non the internet everybody's posting all\nthe positive things\num in person everybody's sharing all the\nnegatives so true yeah um and so there's\nnot that balance\ni i think that a lot of the time we're\nwe're kind of uh using our friendships\nto kind of download our problems but\nwe're not actually listening when i was\ntraining i was doing my internship a\nclinical supervisor said you have two\nears in one mouth there's a reason for\nthat ratio\ni think we don't know how to listen\nand so sometimes uh we feel like when\nsomeone's telling us something that we\nneed to problem solve for them\num we don't know just how to sit with\nthem and not fix it for them and we\ndon't realize too that sometimes\nwe're helping them by helping them to\nhear themselves more clearly yes and if\nwe talk for them if we talk over them\nthey can't hear themselves we're talking\nover their internal voice\nthat that that last bit there at the end\nthat you just mentioned is so powerful\nwe're talking over their internal voice\nand actually simply listening to them\nallows them to hear themselves yes and\nah you're so right i feel like my best\nconversations are definitely when i i\ncan find the narrative\njust by being able to share and share\nand share because most of the time we\nshare we we talk for two minutes the\nperson giving the answer talks for eight\nand it's almost like\nyou know and now it's okay now do i take\nthat answer they don't quite understand\nme and then right it just kind of gets\nlost so\nhow do we shift is talking about our\nproblems useful\nwith who is it useful\nand and when is it useful yeah i think\nyou have to choose your audience yeah i\nthink so many times people have had bad\nexperiences let's say that growing up\nthey had bad experiences and so then\nthey end up choosing\nsomeone who will disappoint them and\nthen they say see see what happens when\ni'm vulnerable see how that doesn't work\num and and what happens is they they\ndon't realize that they're repeating\nthis pattern one thing that therapy\nreally does for people is it helps them\nto see\nyou are making choices\nthat are are repeating that are helping\nyou to repeat a pattern that is making\nyou unhappy that is keeping you stuck\nand and people don't realize that\nthey're doing that um there's a woman in\nthe book who keeps hooking up with the\nwrong guys right um and including by the\nway one from the waiting room i don't\nmean in the waiting room it's not that\nexciting\nbut but she meets him in the waiting\nroom and i know because of her pattern\nthat you know this is going to be a\ndisaster and she keeps saying oh it's\nthe guys it's this person it's that\nperson and she doesn't realize that\nthese people are so much like the people\nshe grew up around\nand i don't mean that we're blaming\npeople's parents because i think that\nmost parents\ndid their absolute best you know most\nparents really want to be a good parent\nbut sometimes they didn't know how or\nthey were very limited or there was some\nmental there was some mental health\nissues or whatever it might be\nand so they couldn't give their kids\nthat that mirroring experience that you\nknow is something that they would want\nin an adult relationship\nand so with her it takes her so long to\nrealize that when she meets someone who\nis going to give her what she wants\nshe's like i'm not attracted no\nchemistry right it's almost like like\nshe doesn't know how to be around\nsomeone who will give her what she wants\nand there's a there's a learning process\naround well wait a minute just because\nsomething feels familiar\nlike the person who disappoints you\ndoesn't mean it's right you know that\nchemistry that she kept feeling was like\noh you feel familiar come closer yeah\nit's like no\nthe fact that you feel familiar should\nbe a sign like let's try something\ndifferent let's go into this place of\nunfamiliarity and it will be\nuncomfortable because you don't know the\ncustoms in this country you haven't been\nto this country before you're going to\nhave to use your guidebook and and learn\nyour way around a little bit but why\ndon't you see what it's like over in\nthat country\nright yeah absolutely what is your take\non the elusive chemistry\nwhen people talk about it when they're\npartnerships and you know the way i've\nalways understood it is\ni've always felt that when you look at\nchemistry and compatibility chemistry is\nsomething that i can feel multiple times\na day with different people yeah i can\nfeel it with the barista i can feel it\nwith my personal trainer i can feel it\nwith\nsomeone i'm just taking the train home\nwith like chemistry is something i can\nfeel over and over again compatibility\nis something i can't it's not as easily\nreplaceable it took longer to build and\nit's something that i have with less\npeople in the world in general yeah uh\nand and so for me i've i always look at\nchemistry as the elusive thing because i\nhear the same my friends will come back\nfrom dates and be like jay like but\nthere was no chemistry and i'm like okay\nso tell me about that and how you've\ntackled helping people\nunderstand chemistry and and filter it\nbetter yeah so\nthis is i i love that we're having this\nconversation because this is such an\nimportant part of relationship so many\ntimes people will say you know they went\non a first date with somebody and\nthey're like yeah no i had a really good\ntime but there was no chemistry and i\nsaid well the having the really good\ntime might mean that there's potential\nfor chemistry yes um but what they do is\nbecause they're on the apps and they say\noh well there's like 10 000 other people\nthat i can date\nand they just keep recycling and\nrecycling and recycling and they don't\ngive something time or space to grow\nand chemistry sometimes happens right\naway and other times it takes time to\ngrow so um there are these surveys that\nwere done where where men and women were\nwere followed um for 20 years from the\nmoment that they went on a first date\nthrough marriages divorces you know all\nthese things and what happened was a lot\nof people have revised their stories\ndepending on what happened later so the\npeople who um are happily married let's\nsay a lot of them said you know well\ntell us about the first date when\nthey're telling it now they say oh yeah\nthere was instant chemistry but what\nthey reported at the time was yeah i\ndon't know maybe i'll go on a second\ndate i don't know there's not a lot here\nbut it built and so their story became\nthere was instant chemistry right now\nthe people who were divorced sometimes\nthey would say oh i knew i never liked\nthis person from the beginning and at\nthe time they reported oh my god we had\nthis amazing chemistry right so it's not\nvery reliable that first time is what\ni'm trying to say yeah um it takes time\nso you you go on a first date or a first\nmeeting with somebody and and you say\ndid you did you have a good time would\nyou like to spend another hour with this\nperson\nand then see whether something develops\nsometimes it does a lot of the times it\ndoes a lot of the time it doesn't but\nyou won't know until you give it some\nbreathing room i should say too that you\nknow there's a saying that we marry our\nunfinished business\nand what i mean by that is that a lot of\ntimes if you haven't worked through some\nof these\num ways of being in relationship that\ndidn't work very well for you you seek\nthem out in other people without\nrealizing it so the person will look\nvery different let's say from your mom\nor your dad or whomever and yet\num\nonce you get to know that person you're\nlike oh god you know like oh wait this\nthis feels really like how i recognize\nthat i didn't see that at all right so\nthat's our unfinished business so you\nreally gotta\nwork through your stuff so that you can\nmeet the person that you're gonna have\ntrue authentic chemistry with and not\nthis kind of like chaotic chemistry with\nyeah chaotic chemistry is a really nice\nway to put it because\nyeah that's often what it is it's like\neverything's chaotic but we feel\nchemistry it's yeah it's sexy well\npeople i have so much chemistry with\nthis person even though i can't rely on\nthis person or i'm always nervous i'm\nalways on edge i never know where i\nstand with this person but we have so\nmuch chemistry\nyeah\nyeah it's just and it's crazy how\ni'd love to date back actually and i'm\ndoing some research on it right now i'd\nlove to hear if you already know it's\nsomething i'm i'm really\ninterested in where that desire for\nchemistry ever even sourced like where\nit started like that one that we all\nhave for wanting to feel chemistry like\ni wonder it was a movie or because i\nremember the first time i wanted a\ngirlfriend was because i watched a movie\nyeah my favorite character like was\nattracted to this girl and i was like oh\nmaybe i should have a girlfriend like i\ndidn't you know i was a kid and i didn't\neven know what that meant yeah but it\nwas just so cleverly planted into my\nmind that i didn't feel complete without\na partner\nand and it's fascinating to me look at\nwhere these things started because\nsometimes they're just things that\nyou've heard over and over again in\nmovies or books or songs and yeah i mean\ni think that we we define chemistry as\nsort of like this instant magical thing\num and and chemistry is is so\nmultifactorial it's about you know what\nis this energy that goes on between the\ntwo of you and and how are you together\nin daily life not like on the vacation\nin tahiti right um so when people think\nabout spending their lives with somebody\nit's about the day to day it's about how\ndo we get through the hard things how do\nwe listen to each other how do we deal\nwith um the places that we disagree how\ndo we\ndeal with the differences between us\nbecause we think of chemistry as like\nthat overlap like we we both love sushi\nand rollerblading and this movie and\nthat book and you know and and we're\nvegan and you know whatever it is right\num and that's not chemistry yeah\nchemistry is how do we inhabit the same\nspace knowing that we're two separate\nhuman beings and how do we stay\nconnected even with the space between us\num\nyeah absolutely i love that that's yeah\nthat's really powerful\ntell me about the uh\ntell me about dealing with the paradox\nof being perceived as someone who has\nall the answers\nbut also is\nknowingly trying to grow in their own\nlife\nlike how does that paradox work for you\nyeah when it's like you know the\nperception not only of your clients now\nlike you know you're gonna have a tv\nshow about the book like the book's been\nso incredibly successful which is\nhelping so many people how do you deal\nwith that personally of that feeling of\nyeah i do have answers and i do know how\nto help people obviously people are\nbeing helped you are changing people's\nlives and at the same time you're like\nyeah but i'm still learning and i've\nstill got to work on this and i'm still\nworking on this how do you deal with\nthat paradox or how do you yeah well\nwell that's interesting because so in\nthe book i follow\nfour very different patients where i'm\ntheir therapist and then the fifth\npatient in the book is me yeah as i go\nthrough my own therapy with my therapist\nand a lot of people say well why you\nknow are you insane you know why why\nwould you do that before before the book\ncame out i think it's really smart\nwell the reason i did it is because i\nreally felt like if my patients were\ngoing to be so vulnerable\ni felt it would be disingenuous to be\nthe expert up on high helping these\npeople when i was going through\nsomething in my own life\nand and we all struggle and and so i say\nat the very beginning of the book that\nmy greatest credential is that i'm a\ncard-carrying member of the human race\nand it was so important for me to\nshow how we're all more the same than we\nare different and i think that that\nmakes what people can learn from the\nbook so much more powerful and impactful\num what's interesting though is that\neven though i was very sure that i\nwanted to do that once the book um\nso you know i i was supposed to be\nwriting a different book i was supposed\nto be writing a book about happiness and\nand it just felt so empty to me because\ni feel like happiness is a byproduct of\nliving our lives in a fulfilling way in\na meaningful way is really what we all\nhope for but happiness is the goal in\nand of itself felt like a recipe for\ndisaster so i felt like it was just i\nwas i was a therapist and i was trying\nto write this book about happiness and\nit was making me depressed ironically i\ncalled it the miserable depression\ndepression-inducing happiness book and\nso i ended up not writing that book and\nthen i ended up writing this book and\nand i thought like maybe three people\nwould read it because everybody said oh\nyou know nobody wants to nobody wants to\nread a book about therapy and it's not\nit's a book about the human condition um\nand so once the book was turned in and\nthe sales team got it at the publisher\nand everybody started like passing the\nbook around and i thought oh no maybe\nlike because i thought like three people\nread it and i'm like maybe 300 will read\nit maybe 3 000. i didn't realize like\nwe're like 10 months on the new york\ntimes list now and so well thank you i\nsay that only in the context of um\nif i had known how many people were\ngoing to be reading it i think i would\nhave hesitated to be so open i let it\nrip i mean i i do not come off well i'm\nvery just here's what happened and i\njust let it go\num and so i'm really glad that i didn't\nclean myself up because i think that if\ni had yeah people wouldn't have read i\nthink that the reason that people are\nresponding to it and seeing themselves\nin these stories is because we're all so\nreal in the book\nyou know nobody's cleaned up in the book\nyeah i agree i i think that's beautiful\nand\ni i i do think that that message is so\nmuch stronger today as well and i'm\nreally glad that you didn't know how\nsuccessful the book was gonna be\nit's great and it's funny though isn't\nit that we we feel that sometimes like\nyou would\nand i'm glad you didn't and i know you\ndidn't too because you're very happy\nsharing but it is weird that we think if\nthat many more people were gonna see\nthis i wouldn't what is it about that is\nthat just more chances and odds of\npeople having issues with us or\nchallenging us like what is that that\nstops us from being more vulnerable the\nmore people see us because i feel\nwhen you're not well known it's like you\nstrive to be well known and then when\nyou meet people who are well known\nthey're almost striving for more privacy\nyeah you know it's like right i'm sure\nyou see that in your work all the time i\ndo i think that um people are afraid i\nmean i think there's shame there you\nknow like that that as a therapist um\nyou know letting people see me struggle\nyeah yeah and say you know here i i mean\ni do all the things with my therapist\nthat my patients do with me so so you\nsee me like i want to be liked by him\nand i google stalk him one night and you\nknow i do all these things um and it's\nembarrassing um\nyou know to because you think well\npeople will think less of me people will\nthink that i'm less competent or um you\nknow whatever you imagine and that's not\nbeen the case at all yeah you know i\nthink that people have said i you know i\ni i really i really value\nwhat you shared\num i really respect you i admire you for\nthat and and i think that that\ntranslates to people out in the world\nbeing more open with each other because\nthe title of the book maybe you should\ntalk to someone doesn't mean we should\nall go to therapy\nnecessarily it means we all need to talk\nmore to each other and so the more that\ni can model that for people if i can't\nyou know walk the talk if i can't do\nwhat i'm asking people to do\nthen there's a big gap yes\nbut if i actually do it i think it helps\npeople to say oh well if she can do it\nyeah then i can do it too absolutely\nabsolutely and what have you seen are\nthose patterns of\nclients that you find\nthat you're working with that have seen\nthe biggest transformations in their\nlife\nare there patterns in those people\nthat they have certain shared beliefs\nvalues work ethic habits that that help\nthem take whatever advice you gave or\nother therapies have given them that\nhave actually changed like what has been\nthat kind of x factor that people have\nshared\num i think that what happens is they\nrelease the story that they came in with\nand and sometimes it's these stories of\nyou know\num there's the content of what they're\nsaying like here's what's going on in my\nrelationship here's what's going on\nuh with my anxiety\num and they have a story about it so\nthey think that the content is the story\nbut what i'm listening for is sort of\nthe music under the lyrics so the lyrics\nare you know i'm having panic attacks\nthe music is what is the underlying\nstruggle or pattern that is getting you\ninto this situation\nand once they can see that that can\ntranslate into everything that happens\nin their daily lives but i think it\ntakes courage i think it takes so much\ncourage for them to say i'm going to\nmake changes i always like to say that\ninsight is the booby prize of therapy\nthat you can have all the insight in the\nworld you can say now i understand why\ni'm struggling in this way now i\nunderstand why i have these arguments\nwith my partner\nand i'll say well did you do something\ndifferent yeah and they'll say well no\nbut now i understand it\nyou're not really doing the work because\nyou have to do something different and i\nlove this victor frankel quote that's in\nthe book where he had written um between\nstimulus and response there is a space\nin that space\nis the power to choose our response\nin our response\nit lies our growth and our freedom so\nyes there might be difficult people but\nthen the question is what is our role in\nthat so why are we in that relationship\nor what is our role in making that\nrelationship so chaotic so difficult so\num there's so much tension in it why is\nthat\nso what what is it that that we can do\nnext time that person does that thing\nthat triggers us can we have a different\nresponse because the response we keep\ngiving is yielding yeah the same thing\nnothing's changing so when we talk about\ninsight as the booby prize of therapy\nit's not just having the insight it's\nyou have to make changes and you have to\nlook that means that you can make\nchanges you're not going to change the\nother person but your changes can\ninfluence another person so it's always\nlike doing a dance right and so if you\nchange your dance steps that person\neither has to change their dance steps\ntoo or they will fall flat on the floor\nor they can leave the dance floor yeah\nbut the good thing is you changed your\ndance steps\nand that's the thing when you say what\nis the unifying thing that all of them\nhave in common when they've made changes\nthat have really really transformed\ntheir lives it's about they they chose\ndifferent dance steps does your partner\noften feel distant and you struggle to\nconnect\ndo you feel like your partner nags you\nor is too demanding and you wish you had\nmore space\nor if you're single does it often seem\nlike when you're getting close to\nsomeone they become distant or even\nghost you or do you frequently feel that\npeople want too much from you\ndo you experience problems in your\ncurrent relationship or in a past\nrelationship that seem to follow similar\npatterns\nif so then this video is for you\n[Music]\ntoday we're going to talk about the\nsingle biggest most consistent factor\nthat's impacting all of your\nrelationships that you've probably never\nheard of\nyour attachment style\nyour attachment style is something that\ndeveloped in the first years of life and\nwhile it's estimated that around half of\nus have what's called a secure\nattachment style\nthe rest of us have an insecure\nattachment style\nand that's where a lot of our\nrelationship challenges come from now\ni'm going to ask you six questions and\nfor each question there will be three\noptions to choose from pick the option\nthat most resonates with you and put a\ntick next to the corresponding column on\nyour piece of paper\nready here we go\nquestion one you're at a party or other\nsocial function and you see your partner\ninteracting with someone in a way that\nseems flirtatious\noption one\nyou take it in your stride because you\ntrust your partner\noption two\nyou become jealous and ask your partner\nto justify themselves\nor option three you don't say anything\nabout it but withdraw from your partner\nmaybe you're cold or distant the rest of\nthe night\nso if you choose option one take it in\nyour stride give yourself a tick in the\nc column if you choose option two become\njealous put a tick in the a column and\nif you choose option three distance\nyourself from your partner put a

column c\nif you chose option two you feel nervous\nto say how you feel give yourself a tick\nin column a\nand if you chose option three you try to\nsay as little as possible give yourself\na tick in column b\nnow go ahead and hit pause if you need\nto tally your scores how many ticks have\nyou got in each column\nnow if you've tallied up your scores\nyou'll probably see that you've got\nticks in more than one column that's\nbecause most of us are not all one\nattachment style while we usually have\none that's dominant we can show\ncharacteristics of other styles as well\nso if you have most of your takes under\nletter a it's likely of more of an\nanxious attachment style\nif you have the anxious attachment style\nthis is for you and i want to give a\nshout out some of the following\ninformation on attachment styles is from\ncounselor adam young who is a licensed\nclinical social worker you can check out\nhis work\nso if that describes you again\nnothing to feel bad about here this is\njust information that you can use in a\nhelpful way to become aware\nnow if you scored mostly letter b in the\nquiz you likely have an avoidant\nattachment style according to estimates\nwhich again vary a bit about 20 percent\nof people have this style\nif you mostly answered letter c you have\na primary secure attachment style this\nis the most common attachment style with\nestimates that around 50 to 55 percent\nof us have secure attachment so those\nare the attachment styles\nnow incidentally you won't see many\nsecure types portrayed in popular\nprogramming because they make for the\nleast drama remember chandler from\nfrance his high anxiety and fear over\nlosing moniker and his jealousy and\nreluctance to believe she truly loved\nhim revealed his anxious attachment\nstyle you can also think of tony stark a\ngay iron man as a classic avoidant type\nremember how he would use his sarcasm\nand obsession with technology to try and\nkeep people from getting close to him\nand avoid emotional interactions\nnow that you know the attachment styles\nyou can even play a game with your\npartner or friends watching shows and\nidentifying the different characters\nstyles so how do we take this\ninformation we learned from the test\nabout our own attachment style and use\nit in a positive way in our current or\nfuture relationships here are three\nsteps to doing that\nstep one is to give yourself a chance to\ndigest and process what you just learned\nthere's a lot there now some of you will\nwant to do that by yourself\nothers process things by talking them\nout i'll advise you that if your partner\nwants to process by themselves and you\nwant to talk it out maybe connect with a\nfriend or other loved one you can talk\nto so you can give your partner a bit of\nspace to process what they've learned\nstep two is for you and your partner to\nshare what you've learned about\nyourselves with the other person\nyou're not going to focus on the\nrelationship at this point you're going\nto take turns sharing what you've\nlearned while the other partner just\nlistens now if you're the listener i\nwant you to resist the temptation to\ncomment on what the other person is\nsharing your role at this point is only\nto listen if you need to say something\nyou can acknowledge i hear you or yes\ni'm listening or what i'm hearing you\nsay is and making sure that you're on\nthe right path\nstep three is going to be having that\nconversation where you discuss what\nyou've learned about your attachment\nstyle and your partner's impact your\nunderstanding of the dynamics of your\nrelationship i think this is an\nopportunity to exercise compassion\nhopefully now you have a greater\nunderstanding of what's behind a repeat\npattern or a problem\ni really hope that these attachment\nstyles are going to help you form more\nself-awareness and a deeper bond with\nthe people in your life having this\nawareness allows you to connect with\npeople with more compassion more love\nwhich will improve the quality and the\nhealth of all of your interactions i've\nbeen with my wife for six years now\nwe've been married for three\nand all i'm trying to share is the\njourney and the process of figuring it\nout that's all i'm trying to share and\nwhen i she was the first guest on my\npodcast that i interviewed\nand the whole conversation was here's\nall the mistakes we made in our first\nthree years of marriage like this is\nwhat we got wrong oh wow you went in\nthat's what we talked about because i\nwanted people to hear how\nmuch stuff we've worked through yeah\nbecause that's the fun of it because\nwhen you can have fun working through\nstuff and people are hearing that yeah\nthey're like oh my relationship's not so\ndifferent now right because if all i'm\nseeing is the selfies and the happiness\nand all that kind of stuff so so for me\nthat's that's where my expertise is my\nexpertise is how do i share while i'm\ngoing through it and share with you just\nthe experience i have so like i'm not\ngiving advice to couples who have kids\nright because i've not been through that\ni don't know what that feels like when i\ngo through it i'll figure it out and\ni'll share some so i'm sharing\npre-marriage getting married the early\nyears of marriage what i'm learning from\nthat which also is a really hard part of\nthe marriage i think so it is our first\nyear was quite um\ninteresting to see go on\ni mean it was just like we waited till\nwe were married to have sex we hadn't\nlived together\nmy career was really kind of started\ntaking off and he went to grad school\nand it was like finding this balance of\nlike who we are\nin so many different aspects but like\nknowing that divorce is not an option so\nit's like we have to focus and work on\nthis\nand nobody they tell you oh marriage is\nwork marriages work but nobody can\nexplain it to you because every marriage\nis so different yep so it's good to hear\nthat other people are\nexplaining their first three years of\nmarriage and the struggles that they'd\nbeen through something we did do on our\nhoneymoon actually was read the five\nlove languages have you read that i love\nthat book i like you i've made videos on\nthat book and like\nyeah there's like i've made like three\nvideos on that book and i think gary\nchapman's a genius what are your love\nlanguages i believe your love languages\nare based a lot about how your parents\nlove you oh interesting so so my lovely\nlike you want what your parents didn't\ngive you or you still want what they\ngave you both depending on how good or\nbad they're correct got it so mine was\nand this is how i traced it back i love\nmy mom she's amazing and when my mom was\nraising me\nshe sometimes couldn't spend a lot of\ntime with me because she was working too\nokay but i knew that on my birthday she\nwould always get me the gift that i\nwanted she would always get it no matter\nwhat it was and we didn't grow up with a\nlot but she would save up make sure that\ni had it and she would find it and she'd\nget it for me and it would just be one\nthing but it would always be the one\nthing i most wanted so like one year was\nlike power rangers or something like\nthat and i realized that i associated\nlove with gifts\nso was that your number one that was my\nnumber one love language it is giving\nand getting yes so i love giving people\ngrand gestures\nand i love receiving grand gestures but\nmy wife\nher number one love language is quality\ntime\nbecause her family on their birthdays\nand stuff would just time spent yeah\nthey wouldn't go out to work that day\nher dad would stay home they would plan\nan activity or whatever something like\nthat right and so spend time together so\nwhen we met i was like where's my gift\nlike where is it it's like do you not\nlove me and i would be giving her these\ngrand gestures and gifts on her birthday\nand she'd be like i just want to spend\ntime with you and okay i want you to\nbreak mine down go on i'm acts of\nservice yes what does it mean that\nyou're not giving or receiving i like\ngetting acts of service like if you want\nto love me right acts of service well\nthat's the hardest one right\nyours was amazing that is a talented man\nyeah\ni mean it's like you vacuums make the\nbed do the thing that i asked you one\ntime and it's done wow that is\nimpressive oh yeah active service is one\nof the hottest ones it hit oh so i'm\nhard to laugh no you're not just kidding\ni'm just kidding no no so that's me\nprojecting my bias and how scary\n[Laughter]\nthat's me going oh my god i'm so glad\nthat i i could never do that i could\nnever live up to that but no that's\nbeautiful and that's what i mean that\nyou are with a partner who understands\nthat loves that is able to give that and\nthat's great love languages are very\nimportant in relationships and justin's\nis time spent and physical touch okay\nthose are stops so i just know that like\ni know what he needs and he knows what i\nneed and i think that anybody who feels\nlike they're not connecting with their\npartner should read that book 100 i love\nthat book i recommend it to everyone and\ni think the biggest thing we should all\nnotice is until you read that book and\nuntil you figure out love languages you\nare speaking different languages right\nand so it's like literally speaking to\nyour partner in a language they don't\nunderstand right and so you could be\ndoing everything like for example for\nyou you know justin could be buying you\nlike the best gifts in the world and\ntaking on fancy holidays and all this\nkind of stuff but he's not doing extra\nservice and you're gonna be like well\nnow what doesn't he love me yeah exactly\nand he and he does like you may be with\nsomeone anyone who's listening and\nwatching this right now you may have\nsomeone who loves you deeply\nyou've just never articulated what your\nlove language is you have to speak up\nyou have to share it you can't no one\ncan read in between the lines you can't\nexpect that person to figure it out by\nlooking at you you need to tell them\nthis is how i feel most loved\nright this is what i need to feel loved\nand i see so many couples that get\nscared about saying this or doing this\nor they're it's like hard for your ego\nbecause being able to have enough\nvulnerability and openness to say to\nyour wife\ni need you to tell me i've got this\nright like words of affirmation that i\nneed words of affirmations and you know\nthe ego goes oh no i don't really need\nthat for my wife\nbut you have to share it if you don't\ntell them that how are they going to\nknow you've got to put your ego aside\nand be really open and honest everything\nyou talk about on social media and\nthrough your videos is so emotional\nbased and there's just a lot of like\nthat inner work especially like with\nrelationships but what about the\nphysical aspect of it like physical like\nthe intimacy and all of that do you ever\ntouch on any of that\nah let me think i've definitely talked\nabout it from an abuse point of view\nright you're you're talking about from\nuh like when you're married sex is\nimportant yeah yeah right and i think\nthat for me my understanding is like you\nhave to have the emotional\nfirst before the sex can stay consistent\ncorrect and great it's so much easier\nto talk about that or go into that\nthat's why i focus so much on my content\non the other side right and my content\nis so heavily focused on the\ncompatibility on the healing on the deep\nwork because i'm like if people get this\nright they're gonna have amazing\nrelationships they're gonna have amazing\nphysical like everything's gonna be\ngreat but when you look at all these\nmagazine covers and you'll always see\nlike you know the seven things she wants\nin bed and there are three things and\nit's always those things like and that's\nwhat i love about what i've been able to\ndo with video is that we've shifted the\nconversation the video's getting\nmillions millions and millions of views\nbut we're talking about stuff that\nactually is gonna make a difference\nwhereas you telling someone like these\nare the three things she wants in bed\nlike that's not gonna change your\nrelationship if you aren't compatible if\nyou don't connect if you don't speak the\nright love languages if you're not\nempathetic if you're not vulnerable like\nthen that three list of this and seven\nthis to that isn't going to do anything\nit's void and and that's where i'm\ntrying to get to with people because i\ndon't want people to use sex as a\nsubstitute for that and i don't want\npeople to use sex as an excuse for that\nand i don't want people to use sex as a\ncover-up for not having any of that\nbecause i know having been in tons of\nrelationships where it was just physical\nand that's all there was\nthat's\nthe only time it felt good it didn't\nfeel good at any other time i didn't go\nhome with a beautiful feeling in my\nheart\nand then when it's only about that\nthat's also when it can be easily\nreplaced right because that's easily\nchangeable right and that's why i think\nso many people go through and i talk\nabout my videos so much about cheating\nand loyalty because when it is just\nphysical it becomes so much more easier\nto just disconnect and fall away\nyeah and now heartbreak yes what's your\nadvice on heartbreak\ni know you have you have a video up it's\nlike the five things people should do\nthrough heartbreak and one of them is\nlike get rid of everything from the past\nand only focus on the present in the\nfuture yeah i like that's hard for\npeople i like getting rid of visual\ntriggers\ni think the challenge in a lot of our\nlives is that we're surrounded by the\nsame sounds the same sights right and\nthe same people that we were in our past\nand i see this with anything and i'm\nsure you felt this when you\nwent deeper into your faith did your\ncircles change 100 right when you went\ndeeper into your faith did what you look\nat change 100 right so you look at my\nheart change your heart change because\ninternal anxiety yes because for me when\ni transformed in my faith it was a\ntransformation of my heart yes not about\nwhat i was actually doing or not doing\ncorrect and that's what i feel for\nanyone anyone that i've witnessed and\nobserved go through transformation in\ntheir life\ntheir environments have changed and so\nfor me a lot of us are making it harder\nfor yourself it's like saying i want to\nstart working out every day\nbut i don't own any trainers right it's\nlike that's not going to work it's like\ndoing the opposite like i want to go on\na diet but i'm going to keep chocolate\ncake in my refrigerator right like it's\nit's that so you're saying oh you're\nenabling i want to get over the past but\ni'm going to keep my exes\nsweater right next to me and i'm gonna\nkeep all these text messages i can keep\nreading through again why do people go\nback and read text messages because i'm\nsomeone that broke their heart because\nnostalgia and imagination is more\npowerful\nright the feeling of nostalgia and this\nis in studies too like the research by\nnostalgia is you always think things\nwere better in the past with something\nlike that so you read a message you're\nlike oh but they love me so much and now\nall you're doing is reality is here and\nyou've got your own version of reality\nplaying here so you're basically writing\nyour own movie script up here\nwhen reality is telling you this and\nnostalgia is that script that fantasy\nthat's never going to be that fantasy\nthat isn't real so it's you saying i\ndon't want to accept what is\nand i'm trying to accept what if those\npeople who can't get over that that hop\nwhat do you tell them\none of the biggest things that do you\nreally want no no no no no it's a good\nit's a good conversation i think\none of the biggest things i say to\npeople is just like let's kind of break\ntheir\nspace that they're in\nit's almost like that person needs a\nspace change and they they need to get\nout of that zone and so for me i'm\nalways encouraging people to start doing\nnew things i think it's so powerful when\nyou go and have a new experience when\nyou try something new you join a new\nclass you've never done it before\nbecause guess what it's about finding\nyourself again so you're now learning\nnew things about yourself you're now\nfalling in love with yourself it's about\nfalling in love with you correct and i\nthink that the biggest mistake we make\nin that time is everyone's telling you\noh when's the rebound like are you going\nto date this guy when are you going to\nstart dating again or this girl when are\nyou going to be out there again and it's\nalmost like well no maybe it's about i\ngo inside this time and spend some time\nwith myself and i think\nnew experiences are a beautiful way of\ndoing that because you only learn new\nthings about yourself when you do new\nthings with yourself\nright\nyou never like we never do new things\nwith ourselves you always you're always\ndoing the same things with the same\npeople but imagine you start doing new\nthings on your own and now you have new\nmemories and one of the things i've been\ntalking about a lot with people is\nforming new memories\nif you don't make new memories the old\nones will always hold you back and\nthat's why we're stuck in the old\nbecause we're not making any new ones so\nthe new the old ones just keep pulling\nyou back so the best way to make new\nmemories is a setup and experience do\nwith a friend that you love and when you\ngo out there it's this technique that's\noften used for grounding and therapy and\neverything but i use it for presents and\nthat's how we were trained in it as\nmonks when you go somewhere and you're\nlike i want to take a mental picture of\nthis how many times have you ever said\nthat where you go so when you're like i\nwant to yeah have this in my mind and i\nwant to keep it forever and the iphone\ncamera is not and the camera is not\ngoing to do it it's not going to keep it\nemotionally and i think we're so bad at\ncreating emotional memories that are new\nso the best way to do it is called 54321\nokay\nso when you're in a space and let's say\ni want to do it of this i look at five\nthings that i could see so five things\nthat i can see right now so i'm gonna\nsay you okay obviously yeah important\npart of the memory you're important too\nyeah yeah i'm doing it with you yeah i'm\ngonna say the rug okay so i'm going for\nspace okay now look at the ceiling so\none two three four i'm gonna say the\ncouch so there are five things that i\ncan see\nthe second thing is four things that you\ncan touch okay so four things i can\ntouch my silky dress my really dry skin\nyou're good at descriptions silky dress\ndry skin this is good textured\namazing\nthree things that you can hear\ni can hear the light yes i can hear\nmyself swallow and i can hear your voice\nperfect\nand then two things that you can smell i\ncan smell my garlic breath\nand\num i'm having a hard time smelling\nbasically anything because i'm seven\nmonths pregnant\nyou can hear how clogged i am yeah but\nmaybe my perfume okay okay and then once\nit's all about me yeah no that's good\nand then one thing you can taste\ngarlic great\nso so if you did that\nin an experience that you want to take\nforever\nall you have to do to to make a mental\npicture take a mental picture of\neverything you do five four three two\none five things you can see\nfour things you can touch\nthree things you can hear\ntwo things you can smell and one thing\nyou can taste i really like that yeah\nit's beautiful\nand this is what i mean by when you're\ngoing through a breakup the biggest\nmistake you make is the old memories\nhold you back because you don't know how\nto make new memories and so my advice to\neveryone is go and make new memories the\nfirst time i actually met raleigh was\nbefore i became a monk\nand i met her very briefly\ni thought she was beautiful and\nand and attractive but i didn't really\nthink anything of it like i just\ni genuinely just was so focused on what\ni was doing at life at that time and i\nwas so spiritually inclined and\nspiritually focused that i i literally\ndidn't think anything of it\nyeah and my mom introduced me to you\nyes so i should tell that story yeah so\nactually i met rodney's mom even before\ni met her yeah and so i was\ntraining\nto become a monk and i met radi's mom\nand i was asked to show her how to do a\nparticular\nservice at the temple so i had to take\nher around etc now the incredible thing\nabout this is that that is the only time\nyou ever while i was there that i was\never asked to show another person how to\ndo this service so the one day that i\nhad to show someone how to do this\nparticular service this voluntary\nservice at the temple it was the one day\nthat her mom turned up and at that time\ni didn't know she had a daughter i\ndidn't know anything about this lady i\nwas like oh she's around my mum's age\nyeah and and she was she was wonderful\nand and we got along but i was just\nshowing her what to do and then\nliterally didn't speak to her no and\nthen my mom wanted me to get more\ninvolved in and i really wanted to get\nmore involved in\nlike the spiritual side of my life and\nso she met him and wanted me to um get\nintroduced to the youth community there\nand so she passed on my number to you\nbut you passed on to your sister yeah\nabsolutely yes i passed it on to my\nsister i was like no i need to stay\nfocused do my thing and my sister's very\nspiritually inclined too big shout out\nto amy\nand\nand then yeah and then you guys got\nconnected and you became friends yeah\nand actually at that point my mom said\nto me oh you know i'm in this really\nnice um really nice guy at the temple\nand she was like to me after i met him i\nprayed and i was like i hope my daughter\nmeets somebody like this i know he's\ngoing to be a monk but i hope she meets\nsomeone that's like this because he\nseems really nice\nlittle did he know what was going to\nhappen\nand then um and then what happened\nhe became a monk\ni heard you speak oh i heard him speak\nall the time because he used to do\nlots of\nyouth programs or university talks\nand sessions on philosophy meditation\nyeah philosophy meditation and i was\njust like oh my gosh he's such an\nincredible speaker and the way that he\num makes such incredible wisdom so\nrelevant to us who were like young\nteenagers or\nyeah yeah not young teenagers i was a\nteenager i was a little teenager no you\nweren't\nno you were no way\nhow old were they one thing you're going\nto realize\ni'm the one who remembers all the dates\ni'm like i'm the one who remembers it\nyeah i don't remember anything i barely\nremember things happened like two years\nago um so no i wasn't a teenager i was\nout of university\nwhich feels like a long time ago so i\nwas in my 20s and yeah i saw him\nspeaking i just thought so incredible\nhow he was able to articulate such\nyeah such deep wisdom in a way that was\nso relevant to\npeople who were so young and and\nprobably wouldn't have been so\ninterested in reading a book about it um\nand so i was in awe of him and he also\nlooked really cool he had like a bold\nhead he didn't look like the type of\nperson who was going to be speaking\nabout these things he had like tattoos\nand a bold head but then he was in robes\nthis is really really cool but weird at\nthe same time\nhe was so strange yeah\nand and then it was then when i left\nbeing a monk\nwhich is our story in itself we can talk\nabout that another day when i when i\nleft being a monk her and my sister were\nreally really close yeah and me and my\nsister are really really close i trust\nmy sister she's one of my best friends\nand\ni sat down with her one day and she said\nwell you know what bradley likes someone\nand and i was just like oh who and i was\nthinking she was gonna say some other\nperson's name and she's like she really\nlikes you\nand i was like oh i i really like her\nlike i'd love to get to know her better\nand we we'd interacted we'd had we'd got\nto know each other a bit better because\nwe'd organize charity events together\netc and so i'd seen her\nnot in\nthe role of being a girlfriend obviously\nor someone that i was dating i'd seen\nher interact with other people\nother other humans uh inside a project\nmanagement organization\norganizing events so i'd seen her\npersonality and like observed how she\nbehaved around certain people how she\nhad talked to people how she interacted\nwith people and and based on all those\nthings i thought she was a great person\nso\nwhen my sister told me that i was i was\nsecretly quite happy as well and i\nalways heard about him through his\nsister and his sister would talk about\nhim with so much love and affection and\nhe treats her like\nshe's his baby no matter how old she\ngets she's literally like his baby and i\nused to see like conversations between\nthem and he's like oh my gosh she's so\nsweet like he's so sweet even though\nhe's yeah he's gone off being a monk but\nhe was still really really caring and\nloving towards towards his sister and\nhis family\nand then yeah i told her that i liked\nhim before\nbefore\nhe knew about it or before you'd\nprobably even thought about it yeah yeah\nso then that was it really that's how we\nmet we\nalmost met before i became a monk then\nwe had a conversation yeah never had\nconversations never spoke but\nbut i just seen each other in our own\nelements yeah and then when i left left\nbeing a monk uh\nyou know\nlater that year we we started going out\nso that was around the towards the end\nof 2013. and then it just went really\nfast we both we both kind of as soon as\nwe spoke about it we both knew that we\nwanted to be with each other and we were\nreally certain about it and\nit could have gone really wrong but we\nwere like we could have both been really\ncrazy um but it ended up just working\nout we both really had kind of\nunderstood each other just by observing\none another i guess and um there were a\nfew surprises i'm sure but\nwe yeah we got along straight away and\nwe were both pretty much went from yeah\ni really like you too yeah i love you in\nlike a day and then it was like yeah we\nwant to get married in like a week um as\nin we didn't get married in a week but\nwe wanted to we said we wanted to get\nmarried eventually in a week after that\num\nand then we ended up spending a lot of\ntime at each other's homes right\num he was spending a lot of time at my\nhouse for ages\ni mean that's pretty much where i took\nhim to have all of our dates because i\nloved being around my family and i was\nlike best of both worlds i can be around\nthe person that i want to spend the rest\nof my life with and the people that i've\nspent most of my life with\nand so yeah most of our dates would\nwould involve my parents\num and my sister and my brother-in-law\nof the time and so we got to know each\nother kind of in our own environments as\nwell really fast which i think helped\nus fast forward a lot easier yeah\nabsolutely and i remember that my sister\ngave me like an action plan she's like\nthis is all you're going to get along on\nthis is what you're going to struggle\nwith and this is going to be your\nchallenges and\nand i definitely owe it to her to bring\nus together\nyeah huge part of she was us being\ntogether my sister definitely and and\nshe was like because she knows me so\nwell and i feel she got to know you as\nwell she was just like this is what you\nguys are going to agree on this is what\nyou're not going to agree on this yeah\nit was just it was so nice to have that\nyeah because you could go into a\nrelationship having more understanding\nof the other person can i just say one\nof the things she said that we wouldn't\nget along on is bollywood because i\nloved bollywood songs and films at the\ntime but\nlike a good bollywood song\nquestionable question yeah questionable\nyeah\ni i decided to get over there yeah\nand you you barely yeah yeah yeah yeah\nyou've got to go\nhave a love for it yeah but yeah we\nspent a lot of time in each other's\nparents homes and with our families\nwhich was great because you had to be\nyourself i used to love what your mom\nused to tell you my mom was so funny so\nobviously like it was a person to her\nthat was you know we were dating and so\nusually you would put in a lot of effort\nin the way that you dress and uh doing\nyour hair when the person you're dating\ncomes over\nbut um yeah i would literally be in the\nsame clothes that i was wearing like the\nwhole day which was pretty much like\npajama bottoms and and a really scruffy\ntop and my mum would be like do you not\nwant to maybe you know put a different\ntop on or you don't want to change your\ntrousers i was like no mom if he can't\nlove me in what i'm wearing right now\nwhich is what he's probably going to see\nmean for the rest of his life then it's\njust not meant to be okay we have like\nhe has to love me for and she would okay\nbut you could try you know a little bit\ni was like no and it worked so\nyeah\nand she's so beautiful and cute like\neven when she's dressed on her bow chic\ni'm just like i love it you know and and\nit's quite nice actually like\ni genuinely believe this like i've i've\nrarely see her with makeup on yes and so\nit's it's fun when you when you fall in\nlove with someone based on who they are\nand their personality and their energy\nand all of that beauty shines through so\nyeah i love you so that leads us nicely\non to the next point that our friends\nwanted to discuss which is what's the\nkey to starting off a relationship well\nlike what's the key to starting it off\nwell so one thing for me was\nwas this that because we didn't see each\nother in dating environments yeah a lot\ni feel like dating environments put this\npressure of being in an interview so i\ncompared dates to interviews it's almost\nlike you have to put your best foot\nforward you wear your best clothes you\ntry and say all the best things and even\nif it's not the best actually it's us\ntrying to be right and that's what we do\nin interviews when you're going to\ninterview for a job it's like you want\nto be the right fit for that person yeah\nand that's what happens in a dating\nscenario like you're sitting opposite\ndesk just like you're doing an interview\nand then someone's asking you a question\nand you're like okay well what do i have\nto say to make them like me or to say\nthe right thing whereas we didn't really\nget to do that no and i'm not saying\nthat that was a conscious choice but now\nwhen i look back at it and i reflect on\nit and introspect on it i'm like we\ndidn't really get an opportunity\nto date\nin that sense and that means that i got\nexposed to the real her either by seeing\nher in a charity organization seeing her\nin a real life scenario how does she\ntreat normal people and then how she is\nwith her family and i'm like that's the\nbest view you can get of someone and so\nwhen i look at that in terms of giving\nadvice or tips or whatever\nmy recommendation is\nbe around people that you're thinking\nabout being with in an environment where\nthey're just being themselves because\nchances are if you like them the way\nthey are when they are with other people\nthen you're likely to love them when\nthey're with you too and so often we\nonly see people\nthat we are considering being romantic\nwith or dating etc we only see them in\ndates and dinners and movie nights and\nwhatever it is right\nyeah i agree i feel like you see and\nalso seeing people with the people that\nthey're closest to because you can't\nreally fake it with the people that\nyou're closest to i mean if you can you\ncould do it for a really short period of\ntime and you also end up seeing them\nbeing probably at their worst and at\ntheir best because you can be the most\nloving to your family but you can also\nbe the worst person towards your family\nbecause they're the ones that accept it\nand so yeah i feel like you get a good\nimage of who the person is through\nthrough interacting with them that way\nabsolutely\ngood point thanks nicely said\nit's true yeah and and the other thing\nis\ni so when we first got together i'd left\nbeing a monk probably like seven months\nbefore so it'd been like a seven month\ngap\nand i didn't have a job\noh yeah i had no job i had no money no i\nwas getting rejected left right and\ncenter from every single place that i\nwas applying to because i'd been a monk\nfor three years and no one wanted to\nhire someone who had monk written on\ntheir resume like no one's like oh yeah\ni would love your transferable skills\nlike you know like what do you know and\nso oh you can meditate for four hours\ngreat we need that in our organization\nso it was just there was no\ni had nothing really yeah and\nthat's a great way to start dating\nsomeone because there's very i remember\ni used to save up so i used to like try\nand work part-time and i was doing\neverything i could you were tutoring i\nwas tutoring so i would like i would be\ntutoring young people for their exams or\nuniversity exams et cetera and i would\nbe making like you know 15 pounds an\nhour or whatever it was and i remember\ni'd save up so i could take her out on a\ndate at the end of the month and so that\nwe could do something fun\nand and i loved the fact i loved that\nbecause i met her at a time when when i\nhad nothing and she accepted me for it\nyeah i love her for that and also\nher parents were always really cool\nabout it so sometimes that can be a big\npressure from parents and expectations\nbut her parents were really cool about\nit they never made me feel uncomfortable\nabout it or anything and my parents\nobviously were very comfortable with me\nthey were just like follow your heart do\nwhat's right for you\nvery very encouraging and i'm not i\ndon't come from a well of background at\nall or anything so it's not that i had a\nbackup plan but my parents were still\nvery very encouraging and supportive\nyeah i i\ni that was never uh in my mind to be\nhonest i was i knew i wanted to be with\nyou and so i was like to my mom even if\nwe end up living in a really tiny house\njust by like near the temple that i used\nto go to and just i know that i want to\nspend my life with him so whatever ends\nup being and you were really really\nenthusiastic and you had so much purpose\nand even from the beginning like you\nwere so driven to do whatever you wanted\nto do i didn't know what that was at the\ntime um but you were so driven that i\njust knew whatever it was whatever we\nwere meant to be was what was gonna\nhappen and so and i knew you would never\nyou're always like gonna be there to\ntake care of me and i felt that from the\nbeginning like i always felt supported\nyou wanna hold hands yeah i'm not good\nat pda so i'm gonna not do that\n[Music]\nit was it was really nice and i feel\nlike he had a lot of the qualities that\ni always felt\ni would always grow up saying i really\nwant a husband that was like my dad like\ni love my dad and he was always someone\nthat i felt very protected and supported\nby and so i just definitely now looking\nback at it i felt those qualities in him\nas i got to know him and so i thought\nyeah that was that was nice and my\nparents yeah my parents my parents and\nkerry that i always thought it would be\nyou know you always think in indian\nfamilies that's going to be an issue\nbut they loved him from the start he's\ngot really good i don't know what you\nguys have noticed but he's got a really\ngood way of saying things and and\nwinning people over by his words so it's\nreal though i know that's why it's\ngenuine and it's sweet so from those\ninteractions i think my parents trusted\nhim very easily as well um i really get\nalong with your parents i know yeah and\nit was so great for me because amy was\nalready like my sister and me and your\nmum got along straight away because we\nbonded over food and so yeah it was\nreally easy for us both to\njoin into each family\nbut yeah another thing i think that's\nreally important at a start of a\nrelationship\nis\nself-awareness and setting expectations\nso i feel that having done the work as a\nmonk and having been through that\nexperience myself i'd gained so much\nself-awareness so i was really aware of\nwhat type of partner i needed in my life\ni was really aware of what i needed in\nmy life to flourish to thrive and so\nwhen i met someone it was very easy for\nme\nit was very easy and simple for me to\ncommunicate my expectations to her and\nbe like\ni i remember one of the things i said\nand this is not offensive at all it's\ngenuinely how i felt at the time and i\nsaid that if you want a husband who goes\nto ikea on the weekends and and to the\ncinema like i'm not that guy and i\ndidn't mean that as a bad thing if\nanyone is that what i meant that as is i\nwant to be someone who lives a life of\npurpose and i want my life to be about\nservice and i want my life to have an\nimpact on people's lives and i need a\npartner that's going to\nunderstand that embrace that and roll\nwith that as well and wants to live\nnot a normal life because that wasn't\ngoing to work for me if i really wanted\nto have an impact if i really wanted to\nmake a difference if i really wanted to\nserve and so that wasn't an ego thing it\nwasn't me thinking i'm better or above\nor special it was me saying this is a\npriority for me\nand i don't need it to be your priority\nbut i need you to understand it to be\nmine and i think this is really\nimportant that we should feel that if\nwe're genuinely committed to something\nwhen you make someone aware and same\nback from her side too like when she and\nshe'll share hers but when she's made me\naware of what her priorities are and\nwhat's important to her you start\nrespecting what's important to the other\nperson rather than expecting them to\ntrade theirs right and that's usually\nwhat happens in relationships in the\nbeginning is instead of showing respect\nfor the other people's passion you\nexpect them to change their passion for\nyours or compromise and be excited about\nyour stuff and and i don't think that\nthat's the right way i think it's us\nbeing clear about ourselves\ncommunicating that and then respecting\nwhat the other person communicates yeah\ni think we discussed that really early\non actually yeah just to be clear he has\ncome to ikea with me on the weekends\nbut you know i understood the point of\nit and i remember at that time when he\nwas really pushing for what he wanted to\ndo\num he was very very busy and so there\nwere certain things i mean he spent a\nlot of time with me and my family but we\nhad just agreed that look if there was\nextended things that i had to go to\nbecause with families there's always\nother things that you have to go to like\nfamily friends or relatives houses for\nevery event possible and if that\nhappened\nthen i knew that i was okay with him not\ncoming to them and i said that to him\nfrom the beginning\nif you need to go and do something which\nis i know for you more important not\nbecause for the purpose that you want to\nlive then i totally understand that\ncomes above you just coming to another\nparty which people are not probably\ngoing to remember like it's it's okay um\nand i think that was really actually\nreally important for us because you can\nalways hear what other people say like\nfamily members or friends or whatever\nwill always have a different opinion and\nso as long as you feel like you have um\ndiscussed it and you really understand\nthat person's point of view then you\ndon't feel kind of it doesn't rub off on\nyou when people say things because you\nunderstand it deeply whereas if you\ndon't then i think it's really easy to\nget swayed by other people's view of\nlife or other people's way of\nrelationships or whatever it is like you\ncan get that can rub off on you very\neasily but if you really understand that\nperson and why they're doing it i think\nthat can make a big difference to you\nsupporting them in why then why they're\ndoing it thank you\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love instead of\ncriticizing the other person tell them\nwhat you want and tell them what you\ndon't without implying that they're not\ndoing it"
