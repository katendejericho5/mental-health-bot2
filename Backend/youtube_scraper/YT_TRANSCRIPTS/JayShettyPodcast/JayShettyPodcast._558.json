    "transcript": "i think the key is not taking things too\npersonally this is a journey and it is\ncalled life and we're all going to mess\nup\neveryone's going to mess up everyone's\ngoing to react instead of think when\nthey're triggered and i think just\ngiving yourself grace giving the other\nperson grace and and apologizing when\nyou have done something wrong is\nsomething that we have to offer one\nanother\nto really reach our own individual\npotential\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow\nnow you know that i'm always trying to\ndiscover interesting stories fascinating\npeople who have so much to share through\ntheir life through their experience what\nthey've been through what they've\nachieved and what they've seen and\ntoday's guest is someone that i've been\nso excited to speak to for quite a while\nnow and i'm so glad that we finally have\nher\nonline so today's guest is none other\nthan olivia culpo who's created a\nsubstantial platform in modeling beauty\nand fashion what began as a minor\npageant run turned into a multi-title\nwinning streak culminating in a highly\nsuccessful modelling career that has\nsince made her a household name in just\na matter of years she's created a\nmassive worldwide platform that\nstretches across entertainment beauty\nfashion substantiating herself as a\nfierce entrepreneur and business-minded\nwoman in august 2017 olivia opened the\nrestaurant back 40 with her family in\nnorth kingstown rhode island welcome to\nthe show olivia culpo olivia thank you\nso much for doing this\nthank you so much i have to say you\nreally nail the intros i've heard a few\nof your\nuh actually every single one of your\npodcasts really and i'm always so amazed\nby your way of communicating and also\nthe intros i mean i don't deserve that i\ndon't deserve that at all so thank you\nwell you deserve it because it's all\ntrue but we love you more for saying you\ndon't deserve it but i had no idea that\nyou actually listened to the podcast so\nnow i'm i'm like the one who's feeling\nlike i don't deserve that because i had\nno idea that you were a listener oh\nabsolutely yes you are constantly\ninspiring me i love the topics i love\nyour guests i i take away every every\ntidbit that i can and i'm i'm all for\nfor doing the self work so thank you for\nmaking it easier for us to become better\nand happier people\noh you're the you're this you're the\nkindest thank you so much well i want to\ndive straight in because i have so many\nthings i want to talk to you about\nand the first thing i want to ask you is\njust some conversation starters for us\nto get in there i heard that you are\nabout to open your second restaurant\nwhich you co-owned with your dad in new\nengland could you could you tell us a\nbit about first of all congratulations\nbut could you tell us about where the\npassion for that came from and\nespecially doing it with your father i\nmean that sounds so special\nit is really special so i come from a\nbig family i'm the middle of five and my\ndad and my mom both started their career\nas professional musicians and that's how\nthey met my dad had five kids when he\nwas like 32 and he really didn't know\nhow he was going to be able to support\nus and give us the life that he wanted\nus to with his salary as a musician that\nwas non-existent because he wasn't\ngetting hired\num so he he had to put things into\nperspective and he he started as a\nbartender\nhe really really worked his way up he\nused to count every single penny he\nwould take\nand\nnow he owns that bar and owns a lot of\nother restaurants and i think growing up\nwith his work ethic inspired me to\nalways want to do something in the\nrestaurant industry but\non top of that i think just seeing the\ncommunity that you build\nthrough restaurants\nis amazing in itself like good food and\nand good people and quality time is like\nthose are that's why that's what life is\nabout for me and i grew up around that\nand so i really do love and appreciate\nit that's so beautiful to hear and i\nmean that leads nicely onto something\nelse i discovered about you is that you\nplay the cello and you're a trained\ncellist is that right i mean that's\nincredible i mean how does how long has\nthat taken how many years has that been\nso i grew up everyone in my family plays\ninstruments and my mom and dad grew up\nplaying instruments as well so they kind\nof gave me the cello and said this is\nyour instrument everybody got a\ndifferent one so i started when i was\nreally really young and it was it was\nawesome i i really enjoyed it for them\nfor the most part growing up i think i\nstarted to really resent it and my\nparents during my angsty teen years when\nthey would send me to band camp every\nsummer for like eight weeks but looking\nback on it it was something that i think\nthey did for in my best interest and i\nknow that it was probably the best thing\ni could have been doing with my time but\nyes i'm so grateful for it it's it's a\ngreat it's very very cathartic to play\nevery once in a while and kind of escape\nthat's beautiful that's that's so\nwonderful to hear uh\ni mean with your parents and you've\nwe've already talked about them twice\nand they come up again and again in in\nso much of the important formative areas\nof your life as parents do but\nin the early years of your career your\nparents as far as i believe or know they\nweren't\nthey were kind of against\nyou joining pageants and and i want to\nshare i want you to share your\nexperience during your first pageant\ncompetition if you don't mind sharing\nthat with our audience yeah it was tough\ni well i was studying communications and\nacting in college and i and i had this\nitch to just\ni wasn't enjoying\ncollege i didn't feel like i was where i\nwanted to be i wanted to just do\nsomething\nthat would impress myself i guess in a\nway so i i really wanted to work on my\nstage presence i wanted to have an\nopportunity to uh just grow in any way\nso i so i told my parents i wanted to do\nthis pageant and you have to pay to get\nin they wouldn't pay for anything they\nwouldn't help me with any of my training\nmy mom refused to go to the\nto the miss rhode island um\npreliminaries\nthey just thought it was a big\ni don't know how to say this without\nsounding horrible and offending people\nbut they just didn't think that it was\nthe best use of my time and they also\ndidn't realize why i was pursuing cello\nas my hobby i think that's really what\ngot them to them it felt very vain that\ni would that i would think that going\nentering this pageant would help me as\nmuch as maybe entering\na an orchestra or like trying to get\ninto a symphony for example so they\ndidn't understand it but that but they\ncame to because they had to\nit is your relationship with your\nparents always being like you ask for\nforgiveness not permission or did that\nevolve over time how did you get that\nconfidence as a young woman to just be\nlike well this is what i want to do and\ni'm going to learn this like what gave\nyou that i think a lot of people today a\nlot of questions i get\nis a lot of insecurity where people are\nlike well my parents don't agree with it\nor my brother or my sister don't agree\nor i don't have support of my family how\nwere you able to do something that can\nbe quite challenging as a young person\noh absolutely and i think when you're\nworking toward any goal it's so\nimportant to preserve your sense of self\nand your\nconfidence and i protected myself i\ndidn't tell anybody that i was doing\nthis i did not tell a soul nobody knew i\nwas just working out working on my\npublic speaking my i didn't know any of\nthis stuff i grew up as i grew up as a\nband geek i didn't even know how to put\non makeup it wasn't really something\nthat came supernatural believe it or not\nso i i just did the work and i didn't\nexpect it to to go anywhere\nyeah and so it kind of took a form of\nits own but it was never something that\ni sought out for yeah no absolutely and\nand i love hearing that\nbecause i think i align with you very\nclosely on that\nthat when you're trying to do something\nthat is different\nchances are it's better to be quiet\nabout it because if you tell everyone\nthere's probably going to be so many\nopinions and ideas and expectations that\nthen you kind of you kind of get\nyourself out of it because you get so\nscared\nand so i i really resonate with that\nthat makes a lot of sense you mentioned\nolivia confidence there\ni wonder\nwhat made you confident back then and\nwhat makes you confident today has your\ndefinition of confidence changed has has\nbeing confident changed for you\nas you've had all these different\nexperiences in life of course as you've\ngrown as well well i think everything\ncomes down to just really working on\nyour relationship with self and i think\nthat being confident is very hard i\nthink that you really have to work at it\nand that can mean different things to\ndifferent people for me\ni\nget my confidence and i had my\nconfidence back back then as well from\njournaling\nand quiet moments with myself where i\nreally feel like i'm tapping into source\nenergy or god or whatever or the\nuniverse whatever you want to call it\nbut i but but i think that we don't\nreally i personally believe we don't\nreally get through life alone and you\nhave to try to connect to whatever you\nthink is out there that brought you here\nbut that's not what everybody agrees but\nfor me i really find my peace and my\nunderstanding of where i'm supposed to\nbe from\nthose quiet moments with myself where\ni'm meditating praying doing\naffirmations giving thanks\neven and is that something that's always\nbeen a part of your life or was that\nsomething that you discovered along the\nway when did prayer meditation all those\nbeautiful things you mentioned that i\nknow our audience also loves and our\ncommunity loves\nwhen did that get introduced to your\nlife was that something that you had\nfrom your parents or was it something\nyou learned along the way my mom is very\ncatholic so i grew up in and i went to\nan all-girls catholic school so i think\ni always believed in the power of prayer\num but i but i started transcendental\nmeditation when i was 18 and that was\naround the time that i all of a sudden\nmy ambitions felt possible and i i\nwanted to get out of rhode island i\nwanted to get out of school i wanted to\nto do something bigger than i ever\nthought i could and to me that did\nmanifest into this pageant which looking\nback on it i'm like i wonder\ni wonder i don't know\ni don't i wonder how i got there i still\ndon't really completely understand but\nfor me yeah it it really is something\nthat transcendental meditation helped me\na lot and continues to help me a lot i i\nfelt very grounded and centered in\ndecisions and i it was a very formative\nexperience learning tm was a very\nformative experience for me and i'm\nfascinated who introduced you to tm like\nwhere did that come in to be in your\nlife of course tm has been around for\nmany many years it's it's an incredible\npractice so just how did you even\ninteract with it how did you come across\nit from your background in your\nchildhood which was obviously different\nit was different my older sister who is\nstill the the girl that paves the way in\nour family she started meditating and at\nthe time my mom was having trouble with\nher blood pressure so my sister offered\nfor her to go to the same place that she\nwanted my mom's blood pressure went down\nmore than it had ever lower than it had\never been\num and then we all felt very centered\nand we would meditate together it was a\nreally lovely time and the habit is\nobviously it's a hard thing to keep up\nwith but\ni have i'm so grateful to have the tools\nand i i would encourage anybody\nlistening to just look into whatever\nform of quieting your mind you want it\ndoesn't have to be tm\nit was just the one that i was lucky\nenough to have my sister introduced me\nto\nyeah no beautiful and do you have a\nspace i know i recently saw uh the\nfeature that you had in architectural\ndigest i was wondering is there a space\nin your home that you like to pray that\nyou like to meditate that you like to do\naffirmations or are you one of these\npeople that can do it anywhere and\neverywhere i really try to do it\nanywhere and everywhere but i do\ni do\nyeah i really really try i think that's\npart of\nmastering it which i that sounds so\nintimidating and horrible i don't want\nanybody to think that it's anything that\nyou can't do in a specific spot but i\nthink the idea is having the opportunity\nto escape wherever you are having that\nunderstanding is such an escape in\nitself because you can be in a very\nstressful situation just be like hey i\nneed to go to the bathroom and you can\ntake three minutes and just center\nyourself or you can be on a plane on\nyour way to somewhere you don't really\nwant to go or maybe you're anxious\ntraveling i don't know or maybe you're\nin a room full of people that are just\nbothering you you can you can you can\nquiet your mind and it's a tool that\ntakes time to to definitely harness but\num it does get easier i will say which\ni'm sure you know all about i know that\nyou're a big\nmeditator is that a word\nno definitely but no it's you know what\ni find is just i love sharing notes with\nfellow meditators and\npeople who have found their own way to\nsomething or to an idea or to a practice\nbecause i feel like we learn so much by\nhearing how different people are\napplying it and i couldn't agree with\nyou more i think meditation and\nmindfulness and all these practices are\ntools like you rightly said that we need\nto use when we need them you know when\nwhen we're stressed out when we're going\nthrough pressure it can't just be\nsomething that we do in one space in our\nhome\ni wonder olivia with\nwith what we were speaking about earlier\nwith confidence and and i think you\nexplained it really well\nwhat would you say is one of the biggest\ninsecurities that you\nhave overcome or that you're working\nthrough because i think people may often\nlook at someone like you and be like oh\nshe you know she's perfect her life's\nperfect like she doesn't have insecurity\nshe doesn't have but\nas we all know as natural humans each\nand every single one of us\nhas those what's something that you\nthink you've had an insecurity about\nthat you've worked through or broken\nthrough or are trying to work through\ntrying to work through is definitely\nmy scenario well\nyou never arrive we're all on a journey\nright so there are so many things that\ni'm so insecure about i think that\ni feel a lot of pressure with the term\ninfluencer which i am referred to quite\noften and i feel as i have overcome that\nsome for some people influencer can have\na bad connotation for me it's actually\nempowering but it's also a lot of\npressure and i think my insecurity could\nalso feel come from me thinking okay i\nhave to be a certain way i have to do a\ncertain thing or else people are going\nto\nthink that i'm not taking\nresponsibilities as seriously as i can\nand there's the other side of me that's\nlike wait\nwhy does everybody hate influencers\ni don't know because a lot of people do\nhave a bad taste in their mouth about\nthat term\nso yeah that can be really challenging\nand\nthey're\nthat's something that you that i do work\nthrough and i have found uh ways to work\nthrough i mean just gratitude being so\ngrateful for every opportunity i have\nand i think\ni've always been the kind of person that\nif there's a door i go i walk through it\nand i see what what what happens from\nthere and i really do take\nmy opportunities seriously and i'm very\ngrateful for them and it but it can be\nchallenging when there are things that\npeople say about you that might not\nnecessarily be true or you have a hard\ntime understanding and remembering who\nyou are because people are telling you\nthat you're a certain way\ni feel like that's a different\ninsecurity but i think that's more just\nhaving a public life people will say\nthings about me all the time and they'll\nsay even to the extent they'll say i've\ndated people that i haven't even dated\nand it's it can be challenging because\nyou have to have the self-awareness to\nunderstand that that doesn't necessarily\nmatter and what people write about you\nit doesn't have to define you\num\nand it's also something that everybody\nwho decides to have a public life has to\ngo through so\num to me these are these are things that\ni work through i don't want to get into\nthe specifics of what people write but\nyeah no i i i wanted to hear from you\nwhat\nyou're experiencing because i think from\nthe outside in\nit always looks like everyone who has a\nplatform has it all together\nand as we all know it and as you\nbeautifully explained there that there\nare so many things that\nare uncomfortable and difficult and\nchallenging and some of it is\nself-created and some of it is just\ncoming from people who've never met you\nor people have never known you or or\npeople who don't understand you i guess\nwho who do you think in the world who\nare the relationships that you turn to\nfor feeling\nunderstood for being connected who are\nthe people in your life that you turn to\nfor those open honest conversations oh\ndefinitely my sisters i have two sisters\nthat i'm very very close with\nthey really help me we really help each\nother i mean the good thing about\nsisters is i think\nwell i genuinely think sometimes we're\nthe only people that would be able to\nstand one another in a lot of ways but\nwe're also\ni don't think that there's a love that i\ncould experience\nas a like my sisters are my friends and\nmy sisters that's just a combined\namount of love that um will always tie\nus together and i lean on them to be\nhonest with me when i'm being horrible\nthey will tell me and shoot it to me\nstraight i rely on them to ground me and\nremind me of what's important\nthey are a sounding board when i need\nadvice or i want to flush out an idea\nand um\nthey they're just they they mean so much\nto me and it's a very reciprocal\nrelationship because we will all help\none another\ndefinitely them and you know what they\ntell me that really hits home get over\nyourself nobody really cares and that\nhelps me that helps me a lot honestly\nbecause it is true at the end of the day\nwe're all here in li on in life there's\na journey and we're so blessed\nto be on it\nand um\nyeah i i really try not to sweat the\nsmall stuff that's why it kind of took\nme a minute to think of like what's\nreally ruining my day today i try not to\nthink about those things because i'm\nso i i can't believe how blessed my life\nis and i and i really try to lean into\nthat and i love hearing that because\nwe all need to be reminded to not buy\ninto our own hype uh whether it's\npositive or negative and it's always\nwonderful to have\nfamily and people that you trust and\nlove that can say that to you but\ntell me about some of those rituals how\ndo you get into that mind space i mean\nwhat you just said is so powerful like\nyou know you're like i don't even let\nthat i try and avoid having that thought\ncome into my mind what are some of your\ndaily\nrituals and practices could you walk us\nthrough those\nthat have really become important for\nyou uh they don't have to be things that\neveryone has to do or everything well\neveryone will love but what are those\nthings that are important to you\nwell i i personally think affirmations\ncan be really\nreally really transformative one that i\nthat i um say a lot is i am safe and\nsecure within myself\nand that kind of reminds me to not seek\noutward validation which my job is\nliterally outward like what it's very\nhard\nnot to seek that when\nyou are\nfeeling the pressure to show up in a\ncertain way and i also really believe in\nthe power of prayer i'll get on my hands\nand knees and just ask god for an answer\nand i\ni get it\nin one way or the other it's not always\nin the perfect timing but that's\npersonally something that really helps\nme\ni love those i love those and i love\nthat affirmation it's such a powerful\nsimple and and beautiful one that we can\nall use and i think no matter who we are\nwe all seek validation externally you\nknow in in any field of life whether\nwe're seeking it in our family or our\nworkplace or whether it's on social\nmedia and online\nwe're constantly looking for safety and\nsecurity from outside of ourselves but\nwe all know that we can only really find\nit inside of ourselves and that you know\nthat's where it truly lies uh you you've\ntalked really openly olivia about your\nyour journey with\nendometriosis and and you speak very\nopenly about this and you know the endo\nfind out i was wondering whether you\ncould share with us about the diagnosis\nprocess the treatment journey tips or\nadvice you have for young people who may\nnot be aware fully of what it is\nabsolutely well endometriosis is\nbasically when the uterine lining every\nmonth a woman sheds her unil uterine\nlining endometriosis is when the uterine\nlining grows outside of the uterus so it\ncould really be anywhere it could be in\nyour appendix kidneys liver diaphragm\nthey've seen it everywhere so it can be\nvery very painful\nthe real kicker about endo is that you\ncan't diagnose it through an ultrasound\nit's a very hard thing to diagnose so a\nlot of women find themselves in\nexcruciating pain for their whole lives\nor\nin my opinion worse they don't\nexperience pain because their endo is in\na place where there aren't a ton of\nnerves and then they want to get\npregnant and they're unable to get\npregnant because they have\nthis disease has wreaked havoc on their\non their eggs so it can be really really\nand i've decided to lend my platform to\nit to help people in that and have a\nvoice\nfor the women who\nfeel like they weren't heard because the\naverage diagnosis for endo is\nabout eight years because it's so\nhard to find like you have to go into\nsurgery to find the endometrial tissue\nit's not gonna show up if you go in for\nyour\nyou know pap smear or ultrasound or\nyou know i think maybe sometimes they\ncan see it in a cat scan or sometimes\nyou'll have a blood filled cyst called\nan a called an uh chocolate cyst which\nis like an endometrioma and that can be\nattached to your ovaries and maybe they\ncan see it that way\num\nbut it's very rare that i mean not yeah\nit's rare that that would happen and um\na lot of women really suffer and i just\ni wanted to lend a voice and i wanted\npeople to be able to know what to look\nout for so that they're not you know in\ntheir late 30s late early 40s or even in\ntheir 60s saying i could never get\npregnant and i never knew why it's like\nwell that could be why it gives you\nanswers\nyeah well thank you so much for sharing\nthat by the way and and and using your\nplatform for that too because\nthe more and more i learn about things\nlike this where there are there are just\nso many challenges that so many people\nare going through that you don't even\nknow exist right or you may know they\nexist but you don't really know someone\nwho's gone through it and you never know\nsomeone in your family is going through\nit right now you they just haven't been\nable to tell you or be honest with you\nand and share with you what they're\nstruggling with or a friend\nuh or a friend in your life as well\nwho's going through it you you seem like\na very open person you know you have\nwonderful relationships with family\nwhere you can be vulnerable with them\nwhat has\nbeen a quality that you look for in\npeople\nthat you surround yourself with is there\nsomething that you look for as an energy\nas a person as a quality in the people\nthat you keep close in your life ooh i\nwould have to say the first word that\ncomes to mind is honesty\ni think that part of coming from such a\nbig family that is very close\nwe've always been very honest with each\nother to the point where i think\nsometimes it's almost jarring for people\naround us because they just can't\nbelieve how how uh bold we are with the\nthings we say to one another but i was\nraised in that way we really don't hold\nback so i appreciate when others are\nhonest to me i'm always kind of\nblindsided when somebody said that they\nhad a problem about something three\nmonths ago i'm like what three months\nago over dinner like in my family we\nwould just talk over each other get it\nall out and then move on so i really\nvalue honesty i mean obviously in\nrelationships too you don't want any\ndeceit that's not like that's on a whole\nother level and kind of goes without\nsaying but i really admire people who\nare able to\nhave an honest conversation and um shoot\nit to you straight because that's\nsomething that helps both people yeah\nand how do you feel receiving honesty as\nwell because i often feel like a lot of\npeople like honesty and we say i love\nhonesty and and i and i i think i know\nwhat you're going to say which\nfrom from the way you've shared it but\nhow have you prepared yourself to\nreceive more honestly as well because i\nthink a lot of us can say hey i really\nwant people to be honest with me but\nwhen people are honest with us and it\ndoesn't kind of align with what we want\nit can actually be really uncomfortable\nhow have you prepared yourself to be\nsomeone who can accept and receive\nfeedback that's transparent honest and\nopen i know well i think first you have\nto pay attention to what is triggered so\nare you feeling guilt are you feeling\ndefensive are you feeling shame and then\nwork backwards from there\ni personally feel like\num\nit it takes a moment with yourself to\nreally think about how is this making me\nfeel and why is it making me feel this\nway and why even is that person feeling\nthat way i think thinking of things in\nterms of another person's point of view\nis the most helpful way you can have\nempathy and understanding and and get\nbetter and also strengthen your\nrelationship so\ni think the key is not taking things too\npersonally this is a journey and it is\ncalled life and we're all going to mess\nup\neveryone's going to mess up everyone's\ngoing to react instead of think when\nthey're triggered and i think just\ngiving yourself grace giving the other\nperson grace and and\nand apologizing when you have done\nsomething wrong is is something that we\nhave to offer one another\nabsolutely what what a beautiful\ndescription what have been summoned\nolivia i'm intrigued by\nyou've played so many roles in your\ndifferent careers that you've taken on\ndifferent parts\ncan you remember like a pivotal moment\nwhether it was a lesson a mentor\neven a failure that kind of crafted who\nyou are today when i when you think\nabout that\nand looking at how your career is played\nout are there any specific moments that\nyou think back to and think that's where\ni learned something really powerful that\nhas helped me shift how i think and how\ni work\noh yeah yes oh my gosh well\ni didn't really want to go into this but\nno i'm just kidding it's fine it's\nactually a great story and i'm so\ngrateful for it and it was very very\nformative for me so when when i first\nmoved to la i was in a relationship and\nthat's why i moved here and i was\ncompletely\nthrown when i when that relationship\nended because i had no sense of self i\nhad no\ni had nowhere to live i had\nno money i i\nwas raised in a very well i don't know\nif this would even be considered\ntraditional anymore but\ni was raised where you know i don't know\nmy dad was the breadwinner and my mom\nwas\nthe mom and she also worked but you know\nmy dad felt it was just a different type\nof dynamic so it was the first time that\ni realized like i i'm my breadwinner i\nhave to do this i have to work really\nhard i have to maintain\na level of excellence so that i can\nsupport myself and it was the most\nchallenging moment in my\ncareer but it was also the most\nrewarding because\ni\nhad to make ends meet i didn't have a\nchoice i i otherwise would have had to\nmove back to rhode island and\ni don't know work in my dad's\nrestaurants probably which that wouldn't\nhave been the worst thing in the world\nit's obviously not terrible to do that\neither i would i actually love going\ninto the restaurants but i just felt\nlike for the first time i was really\nable to make myself proud and i was able\nto see the the hard work actually come\nin to come come in a way that i was able\nto surprise myself and i know that that\ndoesn't mean everything and\nobviously it's not really\nit's not really my place to say that i\ncouldn't have been happy doing something\nelse but i think that going through that\nkind of gave me the confidence to\nrealize okay i can do this and it also\ntaught me a lot about having to be\nself-sufficient and the importance of\nbeing a woman in society you think\nsometimes that your partner is going to\nsupport you for life but\nit's just not the way to live and i i\nthink that's why i also have such an\nentrepreneurial sense to me now\num because i fi i think it's important\nto show other women that\nthat same message that you can do it you\nshould do it and um\nyou deserve it\nyou owe it to yourself\nfor sure\nyeah that's that's i'm so glad you\npicked that example because\ni think breakups can be so tough\nuh breakups you know\nlike you said they can be the most\nah they can be the most like\nconfusing times where you feel so lost\nand stuck and everything feels like it's\nfalling apart and to be able to rebuild\nfrom that and to recognize that that was\na sign\nfor you to find yourself and to actually\ngo inward but but i love that you chose\nthat example because i think\nlike i was saying that\nso many people go through breakups and\nthat breaks them right that really\nbreaks them\nand you saw it as an opportunity to have\na breakthrough as to who you are\nwhat do you think\nwas it just the sheer pain of like i\nneed to figure my life out now that\nhelped you get through that or were\nthere other things what what was that\nthat really helped you figure out that\nthat was the moment you needed to go\ninward\ni think it was a few things i think for\none thing it was definitely a little bit\nof pride and it was a lot of regret\ni was really upset with myself that i\nallowed my um i allowed\ni didn't put myself first because i was\nsupporting my partner and in supporting\nmy partner i wasn't able to fulfill my\ndreams and then i was eventually like i\nreally didn't have any way to support\nmyself so i learned a lot in that sense\nbut i think that um\ni think that in general i would just\ntell somebody that\nyou have to understand exactly\nwhere you fall in life and if you're in\na relationship that doesn't mean that\nyour life isn't your own\num for me the moments where i realize i\nhave to\npick myself up from by the bootstraps is\nwhen i didn't know how i was gonna be\nable to afford my rent or my meals\nwhich was crazy because i came from\nliving this a-list life and then all of\na sudden it was just\num not my life anymore and it was the\nbest thing that ever happened to me it\nwas awesome and now i make my younger\nsister pay a little bit of rent because\ni\nuh want her to really understand that\none she has to make ends meet and be\ndeep want to be two she can which are\nthat's a very important lesson in life\nto learn you you you can and i want her\nto feel that even though sometimes she\ntells me that that's messed up and just\ndoesn't pay but um it's still just the\nidea i'm i think i'm making her a better\nperson so it works for me\nhow old is she\nshe's 20\nshe's 23. and i'm not kidding you she\njust\ndoes sometimes she really\njust doesn't pay it\ni love that i love that you're outing\nher on the podcast i love i love that\nnow everyone's gonna know she doesn't\nwell maybe this will help her to step up\n[Laughter]\ni love it yeah olivia you mentioned\nthere that that was where that\nentrepreneurial spirit that desire came\nin tell us about some of the best\nentrepreneurial lessons you've learned\nover the last few years of building you\nknow so many different businesses ideas\nventures tell us about some of the\nlessons you've learned on that journey\nwell i think the first thing i've\nlearned is that it's really really\nreally really hard and you have to be\nwilling to put in the work i think that\ni've always been the type of person to\ngo above and beyond in terms of what i\nturn in terms of the time that i lend to\ncertain things i'm very\nthorough and and i can't really\nin good faith always say no to an\nopportunity and to some people i've\ngotten before like oh my gosh\nshe's so thirsty\nthat's another thing i'm i'm a little\ninsecure about but um at the same time\nthat is why i was able to get success i\nthink because i have a lot of\ni have a lot of people who are who are\nmy you know my contemporaries and i look\nat them and it's like we just didn't\nreally give up\nwe didn't we just kept going and every\nopportunity\num i really try to\nto approach with an open heart and an\nopen mind and gratitude and just see\nwhat i can make make of it and i think\nthat that with that persistence\ni was able to get the success and get to\nwhere i am now\nyeah definitely i i couldn't agree with\nyou more i think persistence and\nconsistency are really underrated\nbecause they're not as cool or sexy or\nhot as ideas because it just means\nshowing up doing the same thing every\nday\neven when you don't feel like it\nsometimes i was i was speaking about\nthat to someone recently they were like\njay what do you think is the best skill\nin the world and i think i said i think\nthe best skill in the world is to be\nable to do what you need to do even when\nyou don't feel like it because if you're\nwaiting to feel like it all the time\nyou may never feel like it or you may\nonly feel like it once a week but\nactually the more you do it and the more\nyou practice it you start actually\nfalling in love with it more and it\nstarts with that desire of just that\ndiscipline and showing up how have you\ncrafted discipline in your life you know\ni'm sure that so many areas of your life\nrequire discipline would you say that\nyou're a disciplined person or would you\nsay you're a bit more of a free spirit\nspontaneous person\noh i am incredibly disciplined it's\nactually one of those double-edged sword\ntype of situations because i'm a bit of\na pro i'm a huge perfectionist\nso um that's what i mean by being super\nthorough like it takes me so long to do\nsomething because i just want to make\nsure it's perfect and that is something\nthat i work on because it's not not the\nbest quality but um i think that um like\nyou said just showing up day after day\nand just like you know continuing to get\nback up when you feel down or when\nyou're pushed down\ni look at a lot of people that i admire\nand that's what they've done that's what\nthey're doing and that's why they are\nwhere they are so i really try to\npractice that in my life although it can\nbe very challenging and you sometimes\nthink that the world does revolve around\nyou when something bad happens but it's\nreally just you know this is not\ngoing to break me i am going to get back\nup i'm going to keep going i don't know\nwhere i'm going but i'm moving somewhere\ni love that do you know what i've this\nis one of the reasons why i love the\npodcast because\nyou can follow someone online you can\nyou know you can look at their posts and\nhow they write and everything and then\nyou can get an opportunity to sit with\nsomeone and i really see on purpose as\nan excuse for me to sit down with people\ni find interesting\nand i'm speaking to you today and i'm\njust like wow olivia's just such a\nfree-spirited\nspontaneous\nfun-loving individual like you know you\nyou just like i love how you like\nanswering a question and you switch\ndirection then you crack up at yourself\nand then it will go somewhere else and\ni'm like\nit's just so real and so special and and\ni love that because\ni i think\nwe're all looking for that we all want\nto be that energetic self like how\nhave you always been this way when\nyou're being interviewed or you're\nhaving a conversation or has this come\nwith time where now you just i just feel\nsuch a and when i say confidence i don't\ni don't mean in an arrogant way i i\ngenuinely feel like you just you carry\nyourself in this way which is just\nreally\ndisarming and like there's no barriers\non either side oh well thank you i think\nthat um well let me tell you my my code\nname or my nickname within my family is\noblivia and a lot of my close friends\ncan tell to tell me that i have a way of\nblocking out\nthings or\ncircumstances or um\nyou know kind of playing the\nwell what do you mean by that person\ninstead of you know challenging people\nand i think that that goes hand in hand\nwith my\nkind of carefree spirit because i\nreally really don't take myself too\nseriously and for some people in my life\nthat can be very frustrating but it is\ndefinitely a coping mechanism of sorts i\njust feel like\num i feel like\nlife is more fun and and more um\nyou know natural to me when i do have\nthat more free-spirited attitude and\nit's something that i i'm born with this\ni think i've always kind of been that\nway\num\ndo i work at it\nyes by constantly reminding myself well\nnot constantly but i just you know\nnobody good news and bad news nobody\nreally cares you know i just don't take\nmyself seriously and i think that doing\nsomething in the public eye it can be\ncrippling when you're constantly\nthinking about the way that you're going\nto be perceived or the way that\nsomebody's going to make you feel\nbecause the way that they feel about\nwhat you did\num\nand i've had i've had\nwindows of that type of\nexperience and it's just not\nwhat the way that i want to live my life\nit's not the it's not the best version\nof myself it's it is crippling it is\ndebilitating it's not great for your um\ncreativity it's not great for your\nmental health and\npracticing that\nuh and living that way is it's probably\nin\nyou can tell me if it's a defense\nmechanism but it works\ni i actually think it comes across\nwonderfully i don't think it's a defense\nmechanism i i from from what i'm\nexperiencing through this interview is\ni'm just appreciating seeing someone\nwho's just really comfortable in who\nthey are\nand and i i i love that like that that's\nsomething that i find\nreally\nsomething that i admire in other people\nbecause\ni know how hard that is and and i know\nhow challenging that can be when you are\nin the public eye so i just want you to\nknow that i enjoy and appreciate it and\nfor whatever it's worth uh but yes your\nyour your energy's coming across\nwonderfully and i i think everyone's\ngoing to really appreciate\nthat uh because i think that's what\nwe're all striving for we're all\nstriving to be ourselves in every\nscenario\nand not feel like we're trying to be\nwhat everyone else wants us to be yeah\nyeah i hope that i don't sound like an\narrogant\nperson but oh no no no well\nit's not that i'm gone well i'm just\nthinking it's not it's really yeah well\nwhat am i trying to say here see now i'm\nthinking too much oh no\nyeah now i made you overthink this is\nwhy you should not talk to me this is\nthis is why we should not do podcasts\nbecause now you're overthinking it no i\nwas honestly saying it as a genuine\nobservation and i there is no arrogance\nin there at all i'm it's not it's not\nit's not arrogance it's just freedom\nand and i think you know freedom is\nis\nis everyone's right right it's not it's\nnot arrogance oh well thank you so much\nthat means a lot i'm going to tell all\nof my friends and family they call me\noblivia that you said that\ndo that do that although i may start\ncalling you oblivia because it's funny\nand i like it so\nolivia you've just been you've been so\ngenerous with your time with your energy\nwith your spirit uh just you know i've\nenjoyed connecting with you so much\ntoday as you know we end every\non-purpose interview with the final five\nso these questions have to be answered\nin one word to one sentence maximum so\nit can be one sentence but that's it\nso olivia these are your final five\nthe first question is what is the worst\nadvice you've ever received try harder\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nwork hard and be a good person my mom\nsaid that sweet\nwhat's the first thing you do when you\nwake up in the morning i cuddle with my\ndog i'm one of those people\nand then yep\nwhat's the last thing you do before you\ngo to bed blow out my candle\ncan't forget that and the fifth and\nfinal question if you could make one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be well i think that\nsmiling okay this is a one sentence\nthing everybody has to smile\nfor\nat least\nan hour of their day no i just think if\npeople smile more they'd have\nbetter attitudes they'd be happier\nthey'd make better decisions we'd have a\nbetter life and therefore every other\nlaw that was ever forced or not forced\nbut you know\nvoted upon would be a positive change\nfor the world because smiling is proven\nto make you happier absolutely that is a\ngreat law we have never had that so\nthat's why i love that answer and i\nthink you're spot on i've smiled a lot\nduring this interview uh i i think\nsmiling is one of the most underrated\nthings in the world\ni i know what you mean you're not asking\nus to smile for an hour and hold it\nconsistently you're just saying overall\nyeah overall throughout the day smile\nmore have you ever been in a really bad\nmood and then you\nare told to smile and it just completely\nlifts you from that moment absolutely\nabsolutely so i think maybe we just\nraise all of our energy collectively as\na species\nyeah i love that answer olivia is there\nanything i haven't asked you that you\nwant to share something that's on your\nheart or your mind that you really want\nto share with our community today i just\nwant to say thank you so much for having\nme and for the platform that you have\nand
