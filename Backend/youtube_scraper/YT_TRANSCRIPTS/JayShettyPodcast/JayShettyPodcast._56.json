    "transcript": "research strongly shows that the people\nwho eat the slowest have a four times\nless likelihood of developing metabolic\nsyndrome than people who eat the fastest\nso literally this has nothing to do with\nwhat you're eating it's how you're\neating so this should be very empowering\nfor people because it's like even if you\ndon't want to change the actual food\nchange the speed at which you're eating\nand that does\nchange everything the key message here\nis that the more you can invest in\nsitting down at a table and eating\nslowly and mindfully it's literally\ngoing to have a profound impact on your\ncore metabolic health"
