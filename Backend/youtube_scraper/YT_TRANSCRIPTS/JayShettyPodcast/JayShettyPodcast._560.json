    "transcript": "i have this opportunity\nwith my team\nto bring together people to give them\na platform\nto connect with one of the most\ninfluential\npowerful\ncultural industries that touches people\nall over the place\nand as an industry\nwe have a responsibility\nand an opportunity\nto really change the world\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now today i get to\nhost a very special episode i'm seated\nin oxford london at the soho farmhouse\nif you haven't been here before it's a\nmagical venue and especially what i'm\nhere for is even more incredible i've\nbeen invited to speak at the voices\nconference for the business of fashion\nand beyond that i get to sit down with\nthe founder the ceo and the\neditor-in-chief of the business of\nfashion imran ahmed himself imran thank\nyou so much\nfirst of all for organizing such a\nbeautiful event\nand for being here today on the podcast\nthank you the organization of the event\ncomes down\nto my brilliant team i'm sure you've\nbeen meeting them in all of the little\nnooks and crannies around absolutely\nwhat we call our campus but we\nabsolutely love putting this event\ntogether especially this year because\nit's been two years since we've done\nvoices and we we think of it as like the\nbest way to bring our team together\nbecause we face so many challenges\nin making voices happen you know there's\na lot of people to manage a lot of\nthings to imagine this year of all years\nwe have something at bof called the\nvoices test which is like resilience\nin the face of adversity and rapid\nchanges and you know 24 hours before we\nwere arriving here this year they\nchanged all the covid restrictions\nso we had to adapt and be agile and like\nmy team is just\nawesome so it's all because of them yeah\nwell what's even more special is\neveryone's really positive too\nso they're doing all this hard work but\nwhenever they're with you or me or with\na individual at the conference and the\nevent they've all been just so wonderful\nso congratulations to you and the team i\nwant to start off because we are at\nvoices\nand i have been absolutely blown away by\nevery speaker on stage since day one\nuh the diversity of conversation\nthe depth of storytelling\nyou know when i was first invited and\nyou hear about the business of fashion\nyou're thinking oh well everyone's going\nto be a fashion speaker and then you're\nlike no we're talking about mushrooms\nwe're talking about\nroot studios which is incredibly looking\nat fashion from a completely different\nangle we're talking about activism\ntell us about where the idea for voices\ncame from and what you wanted it to be\nwhen it first started and how it's\nevolved yeah i think you know like most\nindustries there were already\na series of other industry\nconferences\num\nand you know at bof whenever we do\nsomething new we want to\ndo it differently we want to add\nsomething to what's already there we\nwanted it to be disruptive\nbecause\nmy observation was that\nyou know most of the fashion events that\nwe have are just fashion people\nand therefore\nyou have fashion people talking to\nfashion people about fashion\nwhich is a bit of an echo chamber right\nand\nthose kinds of conversations are\nabsolutely important and they happen at\nfashion week and they happen in all\nsorts of you know you know industry\nevents\nbut fashion doesn't live in a bubble\nit doesn't exist\noutside\nyou know the intersections of other\nthings that are going on in the world\nand especially now\namid you know\na once-in-a-generation\nyou know public health crisis\num\nyou know economic dislocation\num heightening global inequality\na global reckoning around\ninclusion racial equity\ndiversity you know we are connected to\neverything that's going on in the world\nso our idea was\nwe need to bring other voices\ninto the room\nand so\nit is a conference about fashion in some\nways because we touch on all those\ntopics but we wanted to pierce that echo\nchamber we wanted to bring other people\ninside\nthe industry\nand help them\nkind of open open the eyes of the\nindustry and also\nto help people understand the power of\nfashion so we have all these other\npeople that come inside\nand and kind of share their time and\ntheir expertise with us\nand one of the things they always say to\nme when they leave is like this is such\na powerful industry it's such a cultural\nforce in the world and fashion has the\npower\nto change things so we set up voices\noriginally with that\nvision that idea that we wanted to\ndisrupt the existing trade conferences\nand we don't call it a conference we\ncall it a gathering\nand we wanted to bring other people in\nand just create the kind of\nconversations that weren't happening\nenough and what happens is everyone the\nnon-fashion people go away and they've\nlearned so much about the industry and\nthey've met all these people and the\nfashion people come and they've also met\nthe non-fashion people and it just\ncreates this incredible energy well\nimran today you're uh you know you're\nyou're a fashionable gentleman uh you're\nalways in the world of fashion but i\nwant to go back to what imran was like\ngrowing up i want to hear about what\nyour passions were what your interests\nwere what you were like as a\nteenager you know what is it that you\nthought you were going to go out to do\nwhat were your aspirations as a teenager\ni think my aspirations as a teenager\nwere\nin a way largely defined by what other\npeople\nexpected of me i grew up in canada in\ncalgary\nmy parents moved from kenya\nto\ncalgary in the middle of the cold winter\nin 1974 in december\num they were both the first\nin their respective families to go to\nuniversity wow\nand my mom was already pregnant\nand\ni guess they made a decision that they\njust wanted me to have the best life and\nmy parents you know even before i was\nborn i think they were already thinking\nabout the future they wanted for me\nand as immigrants\nto a new country with\nyou know 500\nand great education they really believed\nin the power of education and they came\nto canada with a view to kind of setting\nup themselves for a new life and you\nknow that was a massive risk and change\nfor them\nwow um\nand four months later i was born so they\nmoved from\nkenya to calgary\nand i think the day i was born someone\ntold me this kid will go to harvard one\nday\nand i was named imran\nafter imran khan because my dad was a\ncricket player\nand so i think growing up\ni always felt like these expectations\nyou know and i didn't turn out to be\nathletically gifted in any way\num\nbut i was always\ndriven towards a specific path you know\nmany immigrant families when they first\nmoved to the west you know it's been\ndoctor or lawyer or engineer\num and i think when i was a teenager\ni felt like those were the only options\nso at school i was i was really really\nnerdy\ni used to get up at\nfour or five in the morning to do\nmy homework or to study or to prepare\nfor tests you know my mom sometimes used\nto wake up in the morning\num to quiz me and to work with me she\nwas she was a teacher\num my father was an architect\nand\nyou know they really just invested in my\neducation and i guess i felt this like\npressure or expectation that i had to go\ndown one of these paths\nin the evenings however\ni was a really creative kid\nand i started um my first foray into the\nperforming arts was as a singer\nit's i was in a boys choir from the age\nof 89 yeah\nall boys choir and we literally sang\nlike this\num and then i got into public speaking\ninto drama into musical theater and so\nmy days were really really nerdy and\nacademic and my evenings were filled\nwith extracurricular activities that\nwere rich with creativity but when it\ncame to\nmaking decisions about my education\n[Music]\ni mean maybe i kind of knew that there\nwasn't really an opportunity for me and\nthe performing arts you know as a\nvery small\nbrown\nperson like that you know there weren't\nroles for me and there weren't\nopportunities for me you know getting\ncast in things was very very hard you\nknow i was always cast as like the\nimpish mischievous puck or mad hatter\nyou know in in like plays and stuff but\nlike\nto have a real career in the performing\narts was like just a risk that\ni couldn't afford to take\nhonestly so\num i was really interested in business\nand entrepreneurship and so\nin a conversation with my father i\nremember we said well what i should\nstudy business so i studied i moved to\nmontreal when i was 18 years old\nand i studied at mcgill university and i\nstudied for a bachelor of commerce\nand you know i loved\ni loved\nmy time at mcgill\nin part because it was this global\nuniversity there were people from all\nover the world and i'd spent my first 18\nyears only in calgary\nyou know\nand we didn't travel that much\ninternationally we did lots of road\ntrips in north america but\num\nmcgill was my first time being really\nimmersed in a truly international global\nenvironment and it found it so enriching\num\nand montreal as a city was hugely\ninspiring to me it's a bilingual city\nuh and i really wanted to learn french\num i you know i've been learning french\nand since like elementary school because\nin canada\nyou get trained in english and french\nbut i didn't really speak french so\nbeing in montreal gave me this\nopportunity to immerse myself in one of\nthe worlds like truly bilingual cities\nwhere the you know the locals can switch\nfrom one language to another\nlike this and i remember sitting in a\nmall one day\nin the food court and there were these\ntwo women\nsitting next to me and they were\ngoing back and forth uh in a\nconversation and quoting\nthey were speaking in english and\nquoting in french\nand you know i just i was like i want to\nbe able to do that\nso when it came time to graduation i\nactually decided to stay in montreal i\nworked in management consulting in a\nfully bilingual environment all my\nfriends left it was um\ngreat to be still in montreal but it was\nobviously not the same when all my\ncollege friends had left and gone to\nlike new york and paris and london and\ntoronto and other places so after a\ncouple of years\nmy dream was to work in europe and i\nasked uh my company for a transfer to\neurope said i want to live in paris or\nlondon this is that mckinsey right this\nwas at deloitte\nokay fine uh i worked at a small\nstrategy consulting group that they used\nto own called braxton associates that's\nright\nand\nthey said well you're 22 years old like\nwe only transfer people if they have\nunique skills that you can't find in\nlondon and you know you're way too young\nso\nat that point i was thinking about\napplying for business school and you\nknow i managed to get an internship\nslash fellowship with a microcredit\norganization in bangladesh and i started\nmaking plans to move to bangladesh and\nactually the the day\ni was planning to quit the managing\ndirector of the office\nbob leech was his name\nhe came up to my office which was very\nunusual because i would usually go down\nto his office\nand he said imran um\ni found a way to move you to london\nand you know it turned out that there\nwas someone in the london office who\nwanted to move to north america and we\nwere just going to swap it was the first\ntime in my life i faced a real\nprofessional dilemma\ni had kind of convinced myself that\ngoing to work in bangladesh\nwas going to be really enriching it was\ngoing to be great for my business school\napplication because it would show a\ndifferent\nyou know professional experience but i'd\nalways wanted to live in london and by\nthis point my family my parents had\nmoved back to kenya and so i'd been\ntraveling through london to visit them\nin nairobi and\nyou know i'd spend like three or four\ndays in london you know as stop-offs on\nthe way and\nthere's something about the city that i\njust i remember first time i was like\ndriving down palm all in london\ni was in the back of the cab and i was\nlike\noh my god\nyeah you know it's like one of these\nthings you only see on tv and i called\none of my professors professor anne hale\nand i told her\ni i don't know what to do like\ni feel like it's you know i could go to\nbangladesh or\ni could go to london and she said imran\ngo where your heart is telling you to go\nyou have the rest of your career\nto give back because i really wanted to\ngo you know and do this you know service\nyeah in bangladesh\nso you have the rest of your life to do\nthat if your instinct if your heart is\ntelling you to go to london just go to\nlondon\nand so i slept on it and i was like\nagonizing over this decision and\ni woke up one morning\nand professor hale was right she said\nyou know i just my heart was saying\ngo to london so that's\nthat's how i ended up that's amazing and\nyou've you just told me before we went\nlive you've been living in london for 20\nyears now\nyeah so i first moved here in 1999 yeah\nand i ended up staying here for a year\nuh with deloitte and it was amazing\nbecause i got to work in switzerland and\nnorway and\nholland and all over the place all these\ncountries i'd never been to\nbut i was also applying for business\nschool and i managed to get into\nbusiness school\nabout six or seven months after\ni moved to london and i'd been traveling\nso much that i actually didn't end up\nspending much time in london and at that\npoint i quit my job and started planning\nto go to business school so um\nyeah that was that was was here and then\nafter business school i moved back yeah\nwhat what do you think were the biggest\nskills or gifts you took away from\nbusiness school i think that there's a\nlot of conversation today about\neducation higher education graduations\nuh\npostgraduate but as someone who actually\nwent to business school what were the\nthings that you felt you really took\naway\nin terms of\nskills that you wouldn't have got\nanywhere else\nyou know honestly it really wasn't about\nthe skills\ni had studied business in undergrad and\nyou know um hbs has a\nreally different way of teaching they\nhave a case study method you know i\nstudied from textbooks\nin undergrad and you know\nhbs was offering me a different way to\nstudy business\nand it was great you know don't get me\nwrong you know there were elements of it\nthat were\nyou know different and i learned stuff\nbut honestly\nbusiness school is not\nfor me it wasn't about\nthe classroom it was about again the\npeople\nyou know and i\ni found it really hard there at first\nyou know it's a really intense place you\nknow if you do the myers-briggs test\nfamiliar with it yes very familiar and\nyou know i think like 70 of the\nyou know incoming class the year i\nstarted were entjs\nthe so-called natural-born leaders\nso you have a lot of like really\nsimilar\ndriven people\nsitting in a classroom every day it\ncreates\nyou know it creates in some ways a very\ninteresting\npositive energy to drive you to\nbe the best you can be but it's also\nin some ways it's very limiting\nand\num you know i found at times it was\nreally hard and\nyou know while i was there um\n9 11 happened\nand as a\nas a muslim\nyou know it was\na really eye-opening experience because\nyou know you know\nhbs is like a community\nyou know it's a community of people and\nyou know it happened in september\nobviously and i was in my second year\nand i remember thinking about all of the\nfirst years i had just arrived from\nalgeria or egypt\nor saudi arabia\nyou know muslims from all over the world\nand they were in the u.s\nyou know for the you know the first\nthree or four weeks of their business\nschool career and this like\nhorrible tragedy has happened and so\na bunch of us gathered all the muslims\non campus together um\nto just say you know like this is a\nreally supportive community and\nby that point there had already been\nsome instances of extreme\nislamophobia on campus\nyou know people were saying really\nmisjudged\nill-informed\nignorant\nhateful\nthings and you know\nyou have to remember it was a really\nit's a really charged environment it was\nreally emotional time\nand so\nof course like everyone was feeling you\nknow but they were it was h harvard\nbusiness school there were so many\nconnections of people in those\nclassrooms professors teaching in those\nclassrooms\nand that and the trade world trade\ncenter and so like of course it was very\nemotional situation but you know for\nthose of us who were muslim it was also\nreally really difficult because there\nwas\nsome really really unfortunate things\nthat were said and you know\ni realized and we said to the incoming\nclass that our responsibility is to\neducate people\nyou know and you know there's one moment\nuh i was in a classroom and\nwe were taking this class called the\nmoral leader\nand every week we would have a\nconversation about a significant moral\ndilemma faced by a protagonist\nin a you know fictional\nbook or a situation that happened in the\nworld\nuh and that the professor\non this particular\nmonday\nyou know a week or so after\nthe terrorist attacks decided to turn\nthe focus into the current situation and\nwhat that unleashed\nin the classroom was\nyou know\nreally hateful things you know and\none person in the classroom said you\nknow my friend who's in my section\ni'm worried he's going to blow up\nthe school\nanother person down the road from me was\num said you know islam is a religion\nthat teaches every um teaches people to\nkill\njews\nand i i could like\ni could feel myself really shaking\nbecause\nmy instinct\ni got up and i just left\nyou know and i remembered that\nconversation i had\nwith that incoming class i was in the\nhallway and i left and i was like\nshaking\nso i went back into the classroom\nand\neveryone's hands were up\nand i realized i was the only muslim\nperson in that whole class\nso i raised my hand\nand i just you know i just spoke really\nfrom the heart i can't remember exactly\nwhat i said\nbut you know i just felt like it was my\nresponsibility to to\ntalk and so i came to this whole story\njust to say that you know\neven at a place like harvard business\nschool where you have these like highly\neducated people\nreally\nwell traveled\nworldly\nyou know\nultimately\nthe experiences about the community\npeople you're with and after i spoke the\nwhole class\nerupted into applause\nyou know and\nfor the rest of the day you know people\nwere just showing up at my house that i\nshare with my classmates thought mates\njust to come and like it was very\nsupportive in the end but you know this\nyou know business school was just really\nhard\nyou know it's not you know it's not easy\ni i treasure the people\nthat were there that were you know there\nto support me and to this day\nyou know my friends from university and\nmy friends from hbs they're my community\nthat you know that hold me up\nthat push me\num and so it's really not about the\nclassroom\nit's about\nyou know the community yeah\nand thank you so much for opening up\nabout that and sharing that because\nas you were\nsaying it i can only imagine how hard\nthat is to reconcile\ninternally not just the classroom or not\njust\nthe conversations or the moral leader\ndiscussion but to deal with it\ninternally while you're in a place like\nthat\nyou know i've never\ni've never told that story before\nbecause i think\none of the things that happens\nin our career so like yeah i went off to\nafter business school i joined mckinsey\nin london i went back and\ni think one of the things that i've\nrealized over these last\n18 months or so\nsince we were all locked down is that\ni've just internalized a lot of this\ni've never\nreally understood how it has\nyou know impacted me\nand one of the commitments i made to\nmyself over these last\nmonths is that you know i just need to\nbe more open about it\nbecause\nthese these moments like when you look\nback in your life there's these certain\ndefining moments\nthat you you're changed\nand that moment that i just talked to\nyou about like that was the moment that\nreally shifted me\nyou know\num\nbut i've never talked about it\nwhat do you think changed about you\nbehavior-wise or attitude wise or\napproach-wise from that day what did you\ndo internally\nnow you as as you're saying you hold on\nto it it feels like something you didn't\nshare but how did you process it or did\nyou not process it at all until more\nrecently\ni mean i think it wasn't a moment of\nprocessing\nit's been years\nbut really i think a lot of that\nprocessing has happened in the most\nrecent\nperiod because you know i'm sitting at\nhome\nand like everybody i was reflecting on\nmy purpose you know my\nwhy am i here like what am i doing\nwhy am i working so hard and what am i\nworking towards\nand one of the things that's really\nhappened in my role here at the business\nof fashion is i've found myself\nin a position\nof influence\ni found myself in a public\nposition\nand\ni've realized that as a gay person\nas a muslim person\nas a brown person\nas a canadian\nwith east african roots\nand indian heritage there's actually a\nlot of people\nwho see themselves\nor part of themselves in me\nand there's not that many of us\nin the fashion industry\ncertainly not\nyou know in a in a position that i'm so\nprivileged to have now\nso i've just been thinking a lot more\nabout well what am i gonna do\nwith this position\nand that's really a lot about what\nvoices is for you know that's why we're\nhere because i have this opportunity\nwith my team\nto bring together people to give them\na platform\nto connect with one of the most\ninfluential\npowerful cultural industries\nthat touches people all over the place\nand as an industry\nwe have a responsibility\nand an opportunity to really change the\nworld you know fashion imagery spreads\neverywhere now with social media you\nknow fashion used to be this like\nreally\nsecretive little world all everything\nwas kind of contained and as an outsider\nyou know with a management consulting\nbackground\num\nto come into this industry and be able\nto learn from everybody and you know you\nknow all the interviews i've done all\nover the over the years like every\nperson i've met has taught me something\nand now i have an ability to use all of\nthat\nand connect that with my curiosity and\nmy interest in that you know being part\nof a global community\nyou know the one that i had at mcgill\nthe one i had at hbs and the one that\nwe've built here at bof like all of\nthese things are threads\num through my life\nand so the processing has happened over\na very\nlong period of time but i think\nin the last 12 months or so it's really\nbecome\nmuch more sharpened and that's the\nsession that you know we're going to\nhave this this afternoon with you is\nlike everyone's going to be talking\nabout\nhow their purpose\nhas been either shifted or sharpened\nor focused because of this period that\nwe've lived through yeah absolutely\nthank you again for sharing that it's\nit's truly beautiful being\ndrawn into your personal experience and\ni love that you described it as a thread\nbecause it just shows how interconnected\nyou feel it all is often people feel\ntheir life is like a series of pivots\nand you've had a lot of pivots in your\nlife but you don't see them as pivots\nyou're seeing them as a thread i wonder\nwhen you do make the transition from\nsuccessful mckinsey consultant to\nstarting the business of fashion being\nthe authoritative voice\nin the industry\ntell us about what gave you the courage\nagain i feel like you're just one of\nthese people that's constantly had and i\nhave a lot of these questions from my\ncommunity my audience i have questions\nlike this from private clients i work\nwith and people that i've coached in the\npast a lot of people struggle with\ntransition so whether it was your\ntransition uh to mcgill your transition\nto london instead of bangladesh then\nlondon to hbs then hbs to mckinsey the\nmckinsey you know there's so many\ntransitions here and then you take the\nbiggest one which seems to be where\nyou're feeling your purpose is being\nfulfilled\ntell us about what gave you the courage\nto make that transition from a\nphenomenal career which most people\nwould dream to have at a place like\nmckinsey but then to be able to make\nthat i find that really fascinating it's\ninteresting to use the word courage\nbecause it\ni didn't feel\ncourageous\ni felt\ni just i was really unhappy\nand without\ndenigrating mckinsey because mckinsey is\nan incredible\ninstitution\nwith you know deeply held values it's\nflawed like every organization but\nwalking into those doors every day\ni felt\nlike i was leaving a lot of myself\nat home\nand\nyou know it goes without saying i was\nleaving all my creative side at home you\nknow my powerpoint slides they were very\npretty\nthat was my outlet yeah\nbut there was some professional feedback\nthat you know mckinsey loves feedback\ni get feedback after every meeting you\nget feedback after every project you get\nfeedback every six months and in some\nways that's really helpful but some of\nthe feedback i was getting\nwas basically like\nthey said i didn't have gravitas\ni've been thinking about this a lot\nrecently\nthey said well you don't have gray hair\nso\nyou need to like be less expressive\ni use my hands a lot i'm a very\nexpressive person yeah animated\nexperience\nyeah that's my theater side coming out\nyeah\nand then one day someone said to me\nwouldn't you feel more comfortable\nif you were a tie and a blue shirt\nand there was one meeting i was in\nand everyone was\nit was all men who had gone to oxford or\ncambridge and they they were all wearing\nchecked\nshirts and they they realized that the\nchecks on their shirts\nwere the same\nwere kind of the size of the checks on\ntheir shirt were commensurate with their\ntenure at mckinsey and they all got up\nin a row and they lined themselves up\nand i was sitting down at the table\nand i've been thinking about that moment\nand if that's not a moment of uttering\nbecause i was wearing an orange shirt\ni was a brown\ngay muslim guy at mckinsey\nand these were all like straight white\nmen\nand basically what i've learned over the\nlast few months what i've realized it\nwas very coded language\nthat was being given to me\nto tell me to not be myself\nand i know that now\nbut back then all i was feeling was pain\nand so i wrote them a memo\nand i asked for a sabbatical\nand\nsomeone came up to me in the new delhi\nairport\nand he came up to me and i was i was on\nmy way to bangladesh actually to go\nvisit a friend of mine who was on that\nsame program that i i was thinking about\ndoing many years back\nand he came up to me and he said\ni've been observing you\ni have some things to tell you about\nyour life\nand i thought it was one of those quacks\nright\ni was like i don't have any money\ni'm leaving my rupees are gone\nhe said no i don't want your money\njust sit down with me for five minutes\nand he said to me\ni want to talk to you and a few minutes\nlater he said you're not listening to me\nso yes i am\nso he took a he took a piece of paper\nand he wrote something down crumpled it\nup\nand he put it into my hand\nhe said hold this in your hand he said i\nwant you to tell me\nyour\nfavorite color\ni was like i don't have a favorite color\ni was in such a negative\nplace i said i don't have a favorite\ncolor\nbut mckenzie told me to wear blue\nshirts blue\nhe said what's your favorite flower\ni'm not really a flower person or i\nwasn't back then\nand my cousin's wife had calla lilies in\nher bouquet so i said lily\nand then he wrote down my name\nand he put uh one two three four five\nover the\nletters of my name and he said what's\nyour favorite number\nand i picked number three\nbecause right in the middle\nand i like symmetry\nhe said open your hand\ni open my hand\nand the little paper that he'd given me\nfive minutes earlier said\nblue lily\nthree\nand he said now will you listen to me\nand i spent an hour talking to that man\nhe said a lot of\nreally crazy things but the one thing he\nsaid to me\nwas you need to practice meditation\nand you know in my culture i'm in his\nsmiley muslim\nwe practice something called bandagi\nand my grandfather used to wake up every\nday at four in the morning and he used\nto practice bandigi\nand whenever i tried to to practice\nmeditation\ni could never do that but it stuck with\nme\nand then through a conversation with one\nfriend and then another friend\neverything pushed me towards\nsomething called vipassana meditation\nso i wrote this memo to mckinsey\nexplaining that i needed a sabbatical i\nwas feeling deeply unhappy i wasn't sure\ni wanted a career in the firm and i\nwasn't going to be able to think about\nthis properly\nif\ni was working as hard as i was working\neverything at mckinsey was done with\nmemos so i had to make a business case\nfor why they wanted me to take this time\noff\nand\nthey gave me the time off and i found\nmyself in south africa\ndoing vipassana meditation which is 10\ndays of silence\nand that's when everything changed\nbecause i learned how to meditate and i\nwa i mean a whole other conversation\nthat we can have one day is that\nexperience because it's a\nbut i flew from cape town to nairobi and\ni sat down with my parents and i said i\nhave done\neverything\nyou thought i should do and you've given\nme this amazing education and you've\ngiven me everything you could possibly\ngive me but i'm so unhappy\ni need to try something different\nand\nthey were really worried about me\nbecause obviously i was this like\noverachieving kid\nand all of a sudden i was in\nyou know south africa in the middle of a\nforest meditating i mean they were\nworried that i was going to turn up in\nsaffron robes or something and like\nand i know you were a monk so you i did\nthat yeah\num\nand they said okay we just want you to\nbe happy yeah\nand that's when everything switched and\none of the realizations i had as part of\nthat whole sabbatical i started talking\nto people in fashion and\nmusic and filming i wanted to work in a\ncreative industry\n[Music]\nand you know\nwhen i was a young young young person i\nused to watch this television show\ncalled fashion file\nwhich was hosted by this man named tim\nblanks\nit was on every saturday and i just\nthere's something about that show that i\nalways was so\ncurious about yeah because tim used to\nbe in milan in paris and london all\nthese places all these like interesting\npeople and like there was a business but\nit was also creative and\nso i was like i just i feel like drawn\nto this industry and so a lot of time\nwhen young people say like how do you\nknow what you're passionate about\ni always say like\nwhat were you what were you drawn to\nwhen you were a child\n[Music]\nbefore anyone\ntold you what your past should be before\nyou understood the expectations of\nsociety or\num other pressures yeah\nwhat was what were like it's\ninexplicable what we're drawn to as\nchildren because it's purely\nintuition\nand so um\ni quit my job at mckinsey and\nthat's what my journey\ninto the fashion industry began emerald\nthat's spectacular honestly that is uh\nso beautifully shared and\nthere's so many parts of it that i want\nto deep dive

you get in a position like this\nwhat sometimes happens is like the media\ncreates this narrative around\nwho you are\nand what i've realized over the last\ncouple of years is there's a real gap\nin
