    "transcript": "when you block emotion out\nwhat you can end up doing is blocking\nthem all out so\ni'll often have people who get to\ntherapy after years of doing that\nand and they feel numb and they not only\nhave they managed to block out all these\nnegative emotions so life is less\npainful in that way\nit's almost become more painful because\nthey've also blocked out their ability\nto feel joy or pleasure or love and they\nstart to question gosh do i love my\npartner\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now today's guest\nis someone that i've been following on\nsocial media for nearly the past couple\nof years now and i have loved her\ncontent the way she presents\nideas that are hard to understand in\nsimple ways through incredible props and\ndemonstrations i'm blown away by her\nability to communicate difficult ideas\nwith ease simplicity and practicality\ni'm talking about the one and only dr\njulie smith who's a clinical\npsychologist with over a decade of\nprofessional experience having\npreviously worked in the nhs with\nveterans and the mod in addiction and\ncrisis centers and now in private\npractice she's also an online educator\nand social media star sharing bite-sized\nmental health and motivational videos\nonline with a combined following of more\nthan three and a half million in\nnovember 2019 julie launched her\ntick-tock account to make her services\nand education about mental health more\naccessible during the covert 19 pandemic\ndr julie's audience on tick tock grew\nastronomically as young people related\nto the video she was making about mental\nhealth and her advice to use now i am so\nexcited because in front of me i have\nher first\namazing book that's out called why has\nnobody told me this before\neveryday tools for life's ups and downs\ni want you to go out and grab a copy\nit's already a number one sunday times\nbest seller a bestselling book please\nplease please go out and grab a copy of\nthis dr julie smith welcome to the show\nthank you for being here oh thank you\nfor having me it's an absolute pleasure\ni've been really looking forward to it i\nknow we've been trying to make this\nhappen for some time let's dive straight\nin i want to understand\nwhat you saw\nas the greatest challenge of people that\nyou were working with when you looked at\nthe root challenges of\npatients you worked with clients you\nworked with people you saw people you\nspoke to\nwhat are some of the biggest challenges\nthat you think people are dealing with\nright now when you look at the root not\nthe symptoms not the\nnot the leaves but the root of the\nproblem the root of the tree you know\nthat root of the problem can be\ndifferent for everybody but certainly\nwhat motivated me\nto begin all of this kind of stuff and\nstep out of the therapy room a little\nbit\num\nwas this sort of common theme of people\ncoming along to therapy\nand and expecting me to do something to\nthem so that so therapy was some sort of\ntreatment that would be done to them\nbecause they felt at the mercy of how\nthey felt and and a lot of people\ndidn't have the education\nabout how their own mind works and how\ntheir own body works to to feel\nempowered by\num the idea that\nyou can influence how you feel that you\ndon't have to be completely at the mercy\nof it there are things you can do to\nhelp yourself\nand and often once people had\nthat information that was a real game\nchanger because suddenly\nhang on a minute there are some tools i\ncan learn that could help and\nand it doesn't have to be rocket science\nit doesn't have to all be out of my\nhands it's not something the doctor's\ngoing to do to me it's not this kind of\nspooky\nyou know sort of magical thing that i\ncan't do myself\num so i think that really sort of fired\nme up that there was a lot of\ninformation and education that is often\num provided in within certain therapies\nanyway\num that just is life-changing for people\nbecause it enables them to\nto take their health into their own\nhands a bit more and not feel that that\nthey're at the mercy of it yeah\nabsolutely i love that i mean that was\nsuch a great piece of insight because i\nthink we all secretly hope\nthat there's going to be someone out\nthere who comes and solves all our\nproblems right whether it's a therapist\nor whether it's a partner or whether\nit's a friend or whether it's a mentor\nor a coach or whoever it may be\ni think we all secretly hope that\nthere's someone out there who's just\ngoing to magically turn up and be our\nfairy godmother and sprinkle their magic\ndust and all of a sudden our life's\ngoing to look different and what you're\nkind of saying which is the inconvenient\npainful truth is that well actually or\nactually it's a fortunate thing it's a\nbeautiful thing is that actually it's\nall within your own\ncontrol you have the ability to make\nchoices and habits and practices that\ncan define that\nwhy do you think it is that we are\nlooking to outsource our well-being or\noutsource our journey why is it that\nwe're trying to say fix me or solve me\nwhere does that come from i think it\ncomes from sometimes not knowing not\nknowing that there are things you can do\num\nthat that help and and that i think\nthere's a sort of culture around\num needing to to to buy something to\nthat is going to to fit you know it's\ngood marketing i think you know that\nlots of companies are based on making\nyou feel like there's something wrong\nwith you and they can fix it if you buy\nthis product off them and and but also\nmixed in with the fact that there isn't\nenough education around uh how your mind\nworks and how you can manage your own\nhealth we get a little bit of that\naround physical health\nbut nothing really in terms of mental\nhealth and i kind of felt like you know\nall these people once they were having\nthe some of these little bits of\neducation that we're really making this\ndifference day to day\ni was kind of thinking why why do people\nhave to pay to come and see someone like\nme\nto find that out because you know that's\nnot obviously some people come for full\ntherapy which you know is\nbrilliant and helps lots of people but\nthere were a lot of people that were\ncoming along and once they had the\neducation\nthey were raring to go they that was\nenough and\nand so i kind of wanted to make that\nmore available absolutely so for those\nof you who don't have the book in front\nof you yet i know you will after this\npodcast uh dr julius talks about\neverything from\nmoods to motivation to emotional pain to\ngrief to self-doubt to fear to stress to\nmeaning uh all beautiful themes and\ntopics and we're going to dive into a\nfew of my favorites\nuh from when i received her book over\nthe holidays i really wanted to talk\nabout mood and i want to dive in with\nyou now\ni think mood and a low mood have become\nsuch common experiences now and the idea\nthat we have certain days\nwhere we feel good and there are certain\ndays where we just feel bad and\nunmotivated and we don't want to get out\nof bed and we don't feel like doing\nanything\nhow do we how should we be be\napproaching those days or those weeks\nthat start to feel like we're stuck\nwe're not moving nothing's happening in\nour life how should we approach that\nfeeling and emotion well i think it\nstarts with\nunderstanding that it's a normal part of\nbeing a human being um and i think\nthat's often something that holds us all\nback is you know there's this sort of um\ni don't know if it was something that's\nbeen sort of pushed by you know social\nmedia or anything like that but it's\ndefinitely online is this idea that um\nthat somehow our default is one of\nhappiness and contentment and anything\noutside of that means you're getting\nsomething wrong\nwhich is just absolutely rubbish you\nknow that um human beings are built to\nfluctuate and emotions come and go the\npleasant ones come and go and the\nunpleasant ones come and go as a part of\nthat experience and that's a normal and\nyou know if you wake up and and your\nmood isn't as you want it to be\nthat can be caused by so many different\nthings you know you might have not slept\nwell you might be dehydrated you might\num be dealing with something normal like\ngrief or\nthere could be anything\num but if you wake up in that mood and\nthen\nrespond to that mood by telling yourself\nthat you're failing at life because\nyou're not as happy as everybody else or\nyou know look at that woman down the\nroad who's always energetic and always\nenthusiastic and she must never get a\nterrible mood like this and what am i\ngetting wrong and and we get into that\nnarrative that that pulls us further\ndown that spiral\nrather than allowing us to kind of\nacknowledge this feeling is here\nallow it to be present\nand allow yourself to also then question\nwhat what could be causing this so what\nare my needs are there any needs that\nare unmet and can i meet those\nthat could help\num\nand you know it sometimes it is just a\nmatter of of doing what you can to to\nmeet those needs if if you can identify\nany and then allowing that to to calm\nnaturally yeah no i like the idea of\nmeeting your needs because\ni i think what's really interesting\nabout what you just said is that so many\nof us\nare almost\njudging ourselves or critiquing\nourselves\nfor\nrunning out of energy\nand it's almost like looking at your\nphone on three percent and hating your\nphone for being on three percent battery\nlife and it's like well no a phone is\neither going to be 100 or 90 or 80 or 70\nand it's gonna get to three or it's\ngonna get to one if you don't recharge\nit\nand it's the same thing with us like\nyou're saying that as humans our\nemotions fluctuate our moods fluctuate\nwe're either at a hundred percent or\nwe're at three percent but we can't\nstart hating ourselves at three percent\nwe can't start judging we have to go\nokay i need to stop and recharge i need\nto stop and take a moment\nand that's where your question of okay\nwhat are my unmet needs it's almost like\nokay well what do i need to do to charge\nme that feels like the right way to\nthink about that\ni think one of the biggest challenges dr\njulie you've probably seen is that\npeople trying to avoid low moods we're\ntrying to avoid feeling bad we're trying\nto avoid feelings what happens when you\ntry to avoid an emotion or when you try\nand avoid feeling what actually happens\nto us\nyeah well it can get quite extreme you\nknow if we um we have these kind of\nblocking behaviors so if if a feeling um\nis aversive in some way whatever it\nmight be\num\nif we if we as soon as we start to feel\nit or even see signs of it that they\nmight be approaching we we put in those\nblocking behaviors and so i don't know\nyou might find yourself with your head\nin the fridge looking for something to\nto eat or you might find yourself um\nyou know on netflix just watching\nprogram after program or or drinking or\nwhatever that blocking behavior is for\nthat person or maybe staying really busy\nat work\num and trying to convince yourself you\nknow you've got all this energy or\nwhatever\num but when you do that when you when\nyou block emotion out\nwhat you can end up doing is blocking\nthem all out so\ni'll often have people who get to\ntherapy after years of doing that\nand and they feel numb and they not only\nhave they managed to block out all these\nnegative emotions so life is less\npainful in that way\nit's almost become more painful because\nthey've also blocked out their ability\nto feel joy or pleasure or love and they\nstart to question gosh do i love my\npartner um\nyou know i'm not interested in all the\nthings that i used to find pleasurable\nand and there's this kind of numbness\nand people imagine that there's this\nsort of you know emotions have this bad\nrap don't they where um they're\napparently this kind of irrational mess\nthat you need to stay away from in order\nto be a highly functioning individual um\nrather than it being a a part of how we\nwork and so you know by by pushing all\nof those away and trying to stay away\nfrom them with the idea that we'll\nsomehow be kind of logical beings\nactually being devoid of emotion\nuh\nstrips away your life in terms of your\nsense of meaning or your enjoyment from\nlife and so that idea that you know if\nyou block one emotion\nwell enough you'll also block a lot of\nothers and then and then you can really\nstart to struggle um so a lot of what we\ndo in therapy is you know changing our\nrelationship with emotion is is looking\nat\nhow can we\nallow\nemotional experience to come and go and\nnot only accept it but also\nwelcome it you know how could you\nallow fear or low mood or sadness\nto be there and let it be welcome in the\npresent moment i mean that's just a\nbizarre\num kind of state of affairs right you\nknow we've never been taught to do that\num you would have to kind of brush it\noff and and pretend it's not happening\nand make it go away um\nand so it's a kind of new experience and\nand honestly you'll know a lot about\nthis yourself with you know\nusing uh sort of mindfulness to be able\nto practice\nsitting there and allowing experiences\nto come and go yeah no i think the\nbiggest thing\ni took away from what you shared just\nthere is this idea of blocking behaviors\nthat seem like very normal behaviors and\nthey seem very\neasy and accessible and they feel like\nthey make sense they look normal because\na lot of people do them and then when\nyou really break it down and you go\noh yeah wow that's a blocking behavior\ni'm actually trying to just\nnumb myself from feeling things\nand i love what you said where you're\nlike well actually if you numb yourself\nfrom feeling something you potentially\ncould numb yourself from feeling\nanything like everything a lot of other\npositive emotions as well and so by\nweakening your ability to feel pain\nyou actually\nweaken your ability to feel joy\nand and that idea is\nreally fascinating because\nthat as a block\nis\na block that we all know we don't want\nin our life um\nthat that's you know i've loved that\nyou've given me that reflection today\nbecause\ni i\ndidn't necessarily connect the two in\nthat way\nwhen when you talk a lot about\nmotivation in the second chapter and i'm\nglad that you touched on motivation\nbecause i know and i'm sure you get this\ntoo i get so many dms on a daily basis\nor messages saying like i'm not\nmotivated what do i do how do i find\nmotivation i i don't feel any motivation\ntoday and one of the sections in your\nbook that i loved is called how do you\nmake yourself do something when you\ndon't feel like it and it's really funny\nbecause someone asked me recently they\nsaid jay what do you think is the\ngreatest skill you can have as a human\nand i really thought about that what is\nthe greatest skill that you could have\nas a human\nand the idea that came to my head was\nthe greatest skill you can have as a\nhuman is being able to do something\nthat's good for you even when you don't\nfeel like it because\nthat is the crux of life like the amount\nof days that i wake up and actually want\nto go to the gym are very very few\nbut do i feel amazing after going to the\ngym yes\nmeditation's been a part of my life for\na long time so it's changed i have a\nhealthy relationship with meditation but\nthere are still days when i don't want\nto meditate or i'm too tired or\nexhausted or i'm too\ni'm i'm too bored to go to sleep early\nand so i'd rather think that maybe if i\nstay up a bit late i'll be more\nentertained and so i find that things\nthat are good for me\nfeel hard in the beginning but feel\ngreat afterwards and things that are bad\nfor me feel easy in the beginning but\nthey're really bad for me afterwards\ntalk to us a bit about how do we get\ngood at doing things when we don't feel\nlike it because i am completely with you\ni i think that's like an undefeatable\nskill that we all need\nyeah absolutely and and i agree with\nwhat you were saying there you know it's\nthat that sort of motivation feeling\nthat sort of elevated energy\num inspired feeling that you get is the\nfeeling you get as you walk out the gym\nnot as you walk in generally and\nand it's it's after action and effort\nyou then think you know i i never sort\nof feel like going to the gym either\nlike but when i when i come back from\nthe gym i think i should do this every\nday this is great\nand and i think it starts with\nrecognizing that pattern doesn't it um\nrecognizing i know\ni'm not going to always feel like it\nbecause not because i'm again it's not\nabout failure it's not about you know i\nthink a lot of um\nstuff online teaches people you know\nyou've just got to be motivated every\nday and if you're not then what are you\ndoing and and actually humans don't work\nthat way motivation you have to treat it\nlike any other emotion some days it will\nbe there some days it won't so you can't\nrely on it to be there um to help you\nreach your goals so you know if you've\ngot goals that you've set around your\nown values and what's really important\nto you\num you have to then find a way of of\nbeing able to keep that consistent even\nwhen you don't feel like it so\nyou can't\nmake the decision to act\nonly based on do i feel like a bit like\ncleaning your teeth right\nso\nyou clean your teeth every day\nyou never consider whether you really\nwant to or not it's just something that\nyou do because\nyou consider yourself\nsomeone who looks after their dental\nhygiene right and it's um you know it's\nso it's just part of your day it's\nnon-negotiable and\nand you can kind of work with it a\nlittle bit like that but when you see\nemotion as something that can come and\ngo\num\nyou can then acknowledge\nthat\nyou can tap into\nother reasons for doing the thing that\nyou\nwant to do so i don't feel like going to\nthe gym today\nbut i have set myself a goal to increase\nmy fitness because\nit's important to me that i am fit and\nhealthy for my children as they grow up\ni want to be able to play with them and\nand live a long life to be with them for\nas long as possible and those sorts of\nthings so you're tapping into your\nvalues system\nand being absolutely clear on why you're\ndoing that thing\num and even if it's gosh you know if\nit's i have to go to this job that i\nhate it might be because you're going to\nput food on the table at the end of the\nweek for your children\nor you're going to keep a roof over your\nfamily's head and you know you can tap\ninto those sorts of values even if it's\nsomething that\num\nisn't you know something that you\nwouldn't you know benefit from sort of\npersonally or in terms of your kind of\nhealth or well-being um you know life\ncan be really tough in that way but you\ncan tap into\nwell why is it that i'm doing this\nreally really hard thing that i'm\nhating always because\nactually yeah i'm the breadwinner and\nit's important to me to to look after my\nfamily and stuff like that so you can\nkind of tap into the values and but also\nwe um something that's taught in a\ntherapy called dialectical behavior\ntherapy dbt\num it's often taught to people who feel\noverwhelmed with emotion and then um\nrespond to that emotion in a sort of\nhigh risk or unhealthy way and so um\nwhat you're what you teach people is is\na skill that they call sort of opposite\naction so\nand you use mindfulness to help people\nrecognize\nthat difference between having an urge\nto do something and then acting on it\nso you know your your the trouble is you\nknow your\ndifferent aspects of your experience are\nall experienced at once so it's like i\nthink it's like weaves in a basket you\nhave you have your thoughts and you have\nyour emotions you have your physical\nstate you have your urges to do or not\ndo something but you don't experience\nthem as separate you know you don't\ndescribe it in your head you you\nexperience this whole thing in one\nand so\nyou're often acting\nbased on urges and there's no gap in\nbetween and so you kind of use um you\nknow a mindfulness\npractice to help just widen that gap so\nthat you can experience an urge and in\nthe book i talk about just\na silly game that i used to play with my\nsisters growing up where we would hold\npolo mints in our mouths and it was a\ncompetition so you could not crunch the\nmint because it's just you you just\ncan't do it it's um it's impossible\nright and um and and i didn't realize at\nthe time but\nwhat we were doing there was practicing\nacting opposite to an urge um\nyou know you have this urge to crunch\ndown on the mint but you learn that\nactually i can experience that urge\nand not act and i can even do the\nopposite to that you know you can so you\nget this moment to choose and and you\nknow you'll be an expert on this\nyourself but that you know mindfulness\nhelps to open up that that gap that\nallows you to then\nchoose whether you're going to go with\nan urge or go opposite to it you know so\nif you wake up and the urges to pull the\nduvet over\nand switch your phone off and shut the\nworld out for the day\nyou get this choice okay do i go with\nthis and or do i act opposite to it and\nand often you have to make that decision\npretty quick\num to kind of you know really kind of\nmake the most of the moment um but it's\na great thing you know you can use\nthings like the sort of the mint uh\ncrunching competitions to to just kind\nof practice being aware of that and and\nin kind of light-hearted ways so that\nyou're more skilled at doing it when you\nmost need it yeah thank you for showing\nthose two two massive insights the first\none was\nyou talking about how we shouldn't rely\non motivation i thought that was such a\ngreat\nway of phrasing it that we're reliant on\nmotivation and\nwe can't be reliant on any feeling\nbecause we've we're gonna feel different\nevery day and the problem is we're\ntrying to create the same feelings every\nday\nand you're spot on that when i think\nabout my life i don't feel the same\ntoday recording this episode with you as\ni felt the same recording my last\nepisode with the other guest i feel\ndifferent and so i can't rely on how i\nfeel i have to rely on why i'm here and\nwhy i'm doing this and why i'm trying to\nserve my community and why on purpose\nlisteners\nwant me to show up at my best and i want\nto show up for them and and that's\nwhat's driving me not not how i'm\nfeeling right now and to almost being\ndriven by something else and then coming\nto what you just said is that difference\nbetween\nthe urge and the ability to take that\nspace and time to respond\nand in the spiritual texts when we\nstudied that about the mind the three\nwords were thinking feeling and willing\nso being like the dif the the gap\nbetween thinking and willing like from\nhaving the thought to actually doing it\nyou you have that gap that can that you\ncan adjust and edit and change and and\nyou're so right that we almost need to\ncreate that gap in areas of our life\nwhere we're not trying to practice if\nthat makes sense so what i'm trying to\nsay there and i'd love to hear your\nthoughts on this dr julie is that if\nyou're trying to wake up early in the\nmorning\ndon't practice\ntrying to create this gap between the\nurge and pulling the duvet over in that\nmoment practice it outside of the moment\nso that then you can bring it into that\narea whereas if you practice in that\narea chances are\nyour default action is going to come\nacross\ndoes that make sense and how could you\nbuild that conditioning in another area\nof your life yeah absolutely i would say\npractice with things that feel easy and\nmanageable\njust to\njust create some repetition\nin doing that and actually you know\nnobody will be starting from scratch\neither you know there will be times when\nyou use that skill but you just haven't\nrecognized that you've used it and\nsometimes i think becoming aware of when\nyou use it and it's successful\num helps you to to feel more positive\nabout the fact that you can do it so um\ni don't know yeah i've got young\nchildren so you know\nsleep deprivation is you know torture\nand\neither the you know your baby will wake\nup for the sixth time in a night and\nyou've got to be up at six for work\nand you hear them cry and you think\ni just cannot get out of bed one more\ntime\nand so your body is telling you no that\ni can't do this\nin a very powerful way but you do it and\nand you do it because\nyou have a set of values about the kind\nof parent you want to be and you know\nand so\nyou know in those instances for example\nyou will be doing things or it doesn't\neven have to be at night it could be\nanything you know you might not feel\nlike making another sandwich or um you\nknow buying another load of ice creams\nor whatever it is for your family but\nyou you do things because\nyou maybe have a set of values around\nthat or something's important to you\nabout that and\nand so it's really useful i think to\nkind of sit and think about the times\nwhen you already do that to success\num so that you can really tap into that\nand recognize that therefore is possible\nto translate it\nand like you say practice in a in a way\nthat is\nenjoyable and manageable and you know\neven with the polo thing or um you know\nkind of\nmindful eating and stuff like that you\nknow where you kind of pause and and\nexperience uh food before you allow\nyourself to then um move forward and eat\nit for example or just kind of\nlight-hearted things that feel easy\nbecause like you say the first time you\ndo it it probably won't go well and then\nyou think oh this doesn't work move on\nand then you're stuck in the same cycle\nyeah i i love that have you actually\ndone the video have you done a video on\nthe mints\nexperiment i i think it's such a great\none though no no i haven't yeah it would\nbe it would be good to see you do it\nwith your sisters again that'll be\nthat'll be amazing\nyeah i i i love that one yeah i think\nit's uh maybe you can come and\ncollaborate when you come to the uk\nthat's what we'll do that's what we'll\ndo yeah you can do the testing i love\nthat\none of the other things dr julie\nactually this just came to mind while\nyou were talking that you spoke about\nwas that we just feel this rush of\neverything at the same time can you help\nmy community today and audience today to\nunderstand the difference between\nthoughts\nfeelings and emotions because\nwe feel them all or we experience them\nall as a better word we experience them\nall at the same time and like you said\nwe don't label them effectively we don't\neven know the difference and we use the\nwords interchangeably today and that's\nprobably not healthy either because\nthen when we artic i think language is\njust so important and the way we\narticulate how we feel or an emotion\nif it's incorrect in the sense of how it\nworks as a system we're already setting\nourselves up for more difficulty so\ncould you just break down for us the\nthree and how to know the difference\nwhen we experience them sure so\ncertainly i would say\nsome people can tap into more easily one\nover the other so some people will\nalways be able to identify what they\nthink\nbut can't sort of label feelings or\nsomething like that or some people will\nbe really tapped into how they feel\nphysically in their physical state\nbut won't necessarily recognize thoughts\nand that's normal and that's okay\nin terms of thoughts i often talk to\npeople about it's that you know the\ndescription the narrative that's going\non in your head the way you talk to\nyourself in your head or the the\ndifferent sort of words that pop into\nyour head or images even um\nso it's that kind of you know how you\ntalk to yourself in your head whereas\nemotions are feelings and sensations\nthat you have\nand and then you kind of we often\nseparate that from sort of physical\nsensation and therapy so we'll talk\nabout your physical state so you know\nwhere you feel things in your body and\nhow your body feels at certain times and\nthen behavior being um i often split\nbehavior into urgent action for reasons\nthat we've been just talking about to\nget people to recognize that you might\nhave an urge to do something but you\nmight not do it um\nand so you know\nyou know actions are what we do or don't\ndo um at any given point but you might\nbe able to elaborate on those yourself\nactually i mean how would you\nkind of describe emotions\nyeah no the difference that i've at\nleast um\nunderstood and and by the way i i love\nwhat you said\nthe way i've heard it being explained is\nthat feelings\nare\nour\nexperiences of emotions\nso emotions are something that is\nchemically\nbiologically physically happening and\nthen how we feel about what is happening\nis our feeling so for example if my body\nis\nuh\n[Music]\nfeeling exhausted if my body is tired\nand the emotional experience would be\nyou know low energy the emotion the\nemotional experience would be\nfatigue etc we know what's happening\nwith the chemicals in that space then my\nfeeling is oh my god i'm so exhausted\ni'm shattered i'm destroyed and that's a\nfeeling that's a story that i'm adding\nto that and now as you said the thought\nis the narrative which i love that way\nof describing thoughts my narrative is\nnow\noh i should have taken better care of\nmyself i should have slept earlier i\nshould have done this i i could have\ndone that i'm such an idiot because i'd\nright that's that's that thought\nnarrative so that's how it actually\nconnects from from how i've understood\nit uh and it's made sense to me because\ni think a lot of stuff is happening\nbiologically and chemically\nthat we're then adding an emotional\nfeeling and layer to\nthat isn't helping because we get stuck\nin our head with something that's\nactually quite physical if that makes\nsense\nyeah absolutely and and often i get that\nwhen a really common question i get is\nyou know what's the difference between\nstress and anxiety and often the answer\nthat i i give for that is often around\nthey're actually part of the same\nphysical reaction you know you have this\none threat response and and you only\nhave that one threat response so the\nwhat your body is doing is essentially\nthe same\nbut we conceptualize it differently so\nyou know you and i als often talk about\nthis idea of um\nstress being let's say you you allocate\nyourself you know\n10 minutes to go off and go to the post\noffice and post a parcel and you get\nthere and there's this huge queue and\nand you're stood there you know tapping\nyour foot thinking oh no i'm going to be\nlate for my meeting i unallocated 10\nminutes for this\nand and that kind of pounding heart and\nyou know the sweaty palms and that\nincrease in the level of your alertness\nis your stress response that's enabling\nyou to sort of increase your likeness so\nyou can re-prioritize if you need to so\nthat your brain can start problem\nsolving and working out do we ditch this\nand get to the meeting is that more\nimportant or do we do this and or how\ncan we you know skip the key or\nsomething and um\nso you kind of that would be stress we\nwould conceptualize that threat response\nof stress\nbut if it was anxiety then it's more\nlikely to be based around um\nsomething like fear so uh some sort of\num\nthreat physical threat to your safety\nfor example or a psychological threat\nlet's say\nit might turn into anxiety if you were\nreally worried about um this you know\nmaybe it's not a meeting maybe it's a\nbig conference and walking in late would\nmean you felt humiliated or and that\nwould be a psychological threat right\nand so uh you might feel anxious\nand so it is still that same threat\nresponse kicking off but you're\nconceptualizing it slightly differently\nyeah and when i was researching for the\nbook actually um i found some some great\nresearch around um sort of emotion\nvocabulary and granularity so the\nability to\nfeel something\nand give it a label and it really\ndoesn't matter what that label is it\ndoesn't matter if it matches everybody\nelse it helps if it matches everybody\nelse's but it doesn't have to the more\nlabels you have for different feelings\nthat you have\nuh\nthe the better your outcomes in terms of\nhow you're then able to deal with it\nbecause\nyou're just giving your brain a little\nlabel that says okay i recognize this i\nknow what to expect from this exactly i\nlove that and i'm so glad that you\nbrought that up because i think that\ndiagnosing something is what makes it\neasier to deal with if you if you don't\ngive something a label you're now\ndealing with uncertainty again and i\nthink\nwith a lot of anxiety and stress we have\nrepetitive thoughts and repetitive\nfeelings and not it's not necessarily a\nnew thing\na lot of the time it's the same thing\nbeing triggered by a particular event a\nparticular person a particular place and\ntherefore being able to label it as you\nsaid\nallows you to feel a bit of comfort with\nit like i know that anytime i go on\nstage i will always feel a sense of\nnervousness like i will always feel\nnervous no matter how many times i've\nspoken on stages to\ntens of thousands of people whatever it\nis i always do\nand as i got more used to that i just\nstarted to realize that's what happens\nwhen i care\nand i was like that's what happens when\ni care that's what happens when i really\nam genuinely present with that feeling\nof this is important this is meaningful\nand when i sit into that and i breathe\nthat way and i have my breathing\npractice that i do my mindfulness\npractice\nit happens every time but i already know\nit's gonna happen and so now i'm not\nsurprised and it's not something new\nwhereas like you said if you don't label\nthat\ni label it as care if you don't label\nthat with a word now it's like oh no\nthis is happening all over again and i\ndon't know what to do with it and i\ndon't know why it's happening uh so i i\nthink that's a really great insight one\none of the things you go into this book\nwhich i thought was really beautiful and\nreally important is grief and loss\nand of course so many people have lost\nso many people in the last couple of\nyears uh i lost\ntwo really\ndeep people in my life and not to covet\n19 but i couldn't see them because i\ncouldn't travel back so i lost one of my\nspiritual mentors who i've spoken about\non the podcast before to stage four\nbrain cancer and he passed away after\nmany years of of suffering with that and\nthen i lost one of my closest friends uh\nwho i lived as a monk with he he was\nstill a monk and he passed away to\ncancer as well and i couldn't go back\nand see him because i can travel back to\nthe uh to the uk where where they were\nin hospital and so\ngrief is something that i think is one\nof the hardest things to talk about i\neven often\nget messages from people saying well\nwhat do you say to your friend when\nthey've just lost someone\nuh you know what do you say like what do\nyou text like okay you can test your\ncondolences and your love but like what\ndo you say\nwhat as a therapist\nwhat is the healthiest thing to do when\nyour friend has lost someone how how\nshould you talk to them what is\nsomething that is useful comforting and\nhelpful at that time i think a lot of\npeople struggle with that\nyeah and i've done some videos on this\nactually because it's a really common\nquestion and and i feel that you know\nfor everybody who's struggling\nwith grief or something else there are\nthis circle of people around them who\nreally care and are then struggling with\nthe idea of getting it wrong and saying\nthe wrong thing and and i think a lot of\npeople\nworry so much about saying the wrong\nthing that they don't say anything at\nall and certainly i've done that before\nmyself and you know that\ni think we have to maybe get away from\nthe idea of um having specific things\nthat we must say or must not say and\ninstead expressing being okay with\nexpressing how we feel\nso you know if something\nfeels like a shock you know say that\nlabel it and\nand\nif you're worried about what to say or\nwhat not to say\nsay that too you know\nwow i'm you know i'm feel so sad for you\nthis is awful how i really want to be\nthere for you um but i have no idea how\nor what to say\num\nand then you know if you go with how you\nfeel in terms you probably want to know\nhow they're doing and so ask those\nquestions and and maybe make those you\nknow if you want that person to\nfeel able to open up maybe ask open\nquestions you know that aren't gonna um\nopen questions are questions that invite\nan answer that's longer than a yes or no\nanswer\nso you know if you ask it are you okay\nsomeone will go yeah fine but if you ask\nhow are you doing then someone is\ninvited to kind of talk at length and\nthings like that so if you're wanting to\nstart a conversation about that sort of\nthing then those are great ways to do\nthat but really i would you know\nyou can kind of turn yourself up with\nwhat's the right thing to say what's\nwhat's meaningful or profound or going\nto change how they feel and essentially\nyou're not going to change how they feel\nwhat you can add to the mix is\nletting them know you care for them and\nthat their distress matters to you\nand that you you want to get it right so\nyou know it's okay to ask someone how\ncan i support you through this what do\nyou need um because often those people\nwill have an idea about what they need\num\nand and often it's just checking in\nisn't it and knowing someone's there to\nsupport you i mean what helpful things\nthat people have said to you you know\nwhat's really interesting is that i i\ndon't think\ni i don't think a lot of people did say\nanything to me um and not that i i\nneeded them to i'm a i'm an interesting\nperson with certain things like i find\nwhen i go through\npain or stress or anxiety i like sorting\nit out myself so i'm not much of a\ni'm not much of a talker when it comes\nto certain things apart from if i'm\nworking with a coach or a therapist or\nor someone who who i trust is helping me\nmake sense of something\num and so but i but i i agree i mean i\nagree with everything you just said i i\nthink that the biggest thing that i\nthink you said\nis\nthe problem is when we speak to someone\nin pain whether they're in grief whether\nthey've just broken up whether they've\nbeen through a divorce\nor whether they're experiencing anxiety\nthe biggest problem is\nwe're trying to say something that we\nhope will change how they feel\nwhich is\nnot going to happen it's too much\npressure on you it's too much pressure\non them\nit's just not going to happen and i\nremember when i first started coaching\nand i'm sure you feel the same way as a\ntherapist and i don't want to speak for\nyou but i know that i used to carry that\npressure around that i had to say\nsomething profound in every meeting and\nthat every connection you have with\nsomeone you have to drop these pearls of\nwisdom that are gonna solve their life\nand be like this opening magical doorway\nand you just realize that now you're not\neven listening to them because you're\nworking so hard to come up with this\nfalse\npiece of insight that's going to help\nsomeone and that actually if you just\nsat and listened and like you said asked\nopen questions and we're just present\nthat's what that person needed more than\never and i think\ni'm segueing a little bit but even in\nour romantic relationship and our\nfriendships the problem is we're always\ntrying to say things that we hope will\nchange how people feel\nand the truth is we don't have that\npower\nand trying to have that power creates so\nmuch pressure and burden on you that you\nfeel so weighed down by it that like you\nsaid you don't say anything\nor you try and say something and then\nyou're upset that it didn't change how\nthey feel\nso\nthat to me has been the biggest takeaway\nfrom from what you just said and\nhopefully i've just illuminated some of\nmy thoughts on that\nyeah i think and it's interesting\nactually how how things work in therapy\nyou know someone might go to therapy for\nthe first time and imagine that\nthey're going to take this feeling in\nand\nthe therapist will say something that\nwill make it go away\nand actually what you do as a therapist\nis sit with them in it and\nyeah you know you kind of if someone's\nlet's say someone's you know in a hole\num i think brene brown did this um\nexample really well uh when she did a\nsort of example of the difference\nbetween sympathy and empathy and you\nknow instead of kind of standing looking\ndown in the hole and saying wow that\nlooks terrible\nin therapy particularly what we do is\nget down in the hole with them and say\nyes this is\nthis is really tough how are we going to\nwork on this together\nand you know what's next and so\nyou know that there's this real i think\nwhen someone is grieving\nit's okay to just\nbe with them through your pain like\nthrough their pain so there is no way\nthat you can remove that pain there's no\nway that you can bring the person back\nor make it disappear or fix it\nbut you underestimate the power of\nsimply walking alongside someone through\nit and allowing them to just feel heard\nand cared for nobody really wants to be\ntold what to do they want to feel heard\nthey want to feel that they matter and\nthat how they feel matters and that in\nitself has such a profound impact over\ntime\num but you know building that kind of\ntrusting relationship with someone is\nhuge so yeah take away those\nexpectations to be\nsome kind of you know healer or you know\nfixer-upper and\nand just work on being a really good\nfriend to someone i want to segue a\nlittle bit\ndr julie with what we were talking about\nthe idea of\nrelationships and romantic relationships\nand love and breakups because\na lot of the emotions we feel\na lot of the feelings we experience\nare based on our\nrelationships around love\nand so whether it's the feeling of\nlosing love never getting love never\nfinding love not being lovable not being\nenough\nnot knowing how to love\nlike there is a lot of anxiety and\nstress around that as you're well aware\nand as you know in our work we come\nacross a lot\nwhen when you look at that when you look\nat the feeling of\ni am trying to find someone\nto\nsolve the void i have within myself\nor the idea that if i find someone then\ni'll be complete if i find someone then\ni'll be\nwhole\nthat ch how do you work with some and i\nknow that it's case by case and of\ncourse i'm giving a broad question but\nwith that how do you work with someone\nwho you notice that that is a trait that\nthey have like how do you work with that\nkind of an individual who has that kind\nof a trait well i i guess you you work\nwith someone based on um\nthe idea that if they haven't met that\nperson yet\nthat you can't guarantee they're gonna\ncome along so you have to\nstart taking responsibility for your\nhappiness\nand and while actually you know\ngetting in relationships can be really\nhelpful for people's well-being and you\nknow that the changes and the\ndevelopment that you go through by being\nin a relationship can be wonderful and\nreally healing in many ways but\nyou don't ever want to put the\nresponsibility for your own healing or\nyour own happiness in that other\nperson's hands so\ni would say you know in working with\nsomeone\num who was maybe kind of dealing with\nthat idea that they were sort of waiting\nfor someone to come along\nin order for them to then be happy\nit would really be about looking at\ngrowing your\nlife as it is now\nand making that more meaningful for you\nmore purposeful based on your own values\nand and really looking at that\nrelationship with the self\nso looking at how you know\nif someone\nsort of feels unloved for example\num how are they treating themselves you\nknow what are they are they not being\ncaring and loving to themselves or\ntreating themselves well and and so a\nlot of therapy would be looking so you\nknow reflecting on that relationship\nand there's a lovely therapy called\ncognitive analytic therapy it's cat for\nsure and that looks at how\num the the relationship the early\nrelationships you have in life so with\nparents and siblings\ncan then be reflected in our\nrelationships that we have as adults so\nyou might have\nbeen in a slu you know no family\nsituation is perfect so there will have\nbeen situations that weren't ideal at\nsome point and as a child you would have\nworked out how to get through those and\nhow to survive them psychologically with\ncertain safety behaviors for example\num let's say a parent was sort of\ninconsistent with love you might have\nlearned to be a real people pleaser to\nmake sure that you you made sure they\nfelt okay so that you could feel\nacceptable and then you get into\nrelationships as an adult and that habit\nof being that people-pleaser continues\nperhaps\nbut then causes you to do that to your\nown detriment so maybe you're working so\nhard on\nbeing astute to everybody else's\nfeelings and making sure that everybody\nelse is happy that actually it's making\nyou ill because you're not looking after\nyourself for example so and those\ntherapies can be really helpful in\nlooking at\nwhere did this cycle come from you know\nand if it's something around looking for\nsomebody out there so that you can\nfinally be happy\nthen you can really break that down to\nwhere's that coming from and and how can\ni fix that cycle in a different way so\nthat i'm not dependent on this\num this person coming along and fixing\nit yeah that's so great so often we're\nfixing the wrong wrong end of the cycle\nright we're just trying to solve the\nthe the current feeling the emotion the\nsituational problem right now and you're\nlike well actually let's look at where\nthe cycle started and how that mindset\ngot formed and how that behavior got\nformed and how that desire for\nvalidation got formed and actually if we\nsolve that then we can we can see this\ncompletely differently and that\ni mean to me that's that's really where\nit all has to go i i've seen so many\nbad habits in myself that i picked up\nyears ago in my childhood and beliefs\nand bad habits\nand that now you're like living them\nthrough as an adult\nand you look at yourself and you go oh\nwow like i just thought this was normal\nbut it's it's not and it's not healthy\nand so how can i work on that now and\nand actually tracing it back gives you a\nsense of\nseparation from it as well because you\ngo oh this isn't me this isn't mine this\nisn't\nthis isn't who i am this is something i\npicked up along the way\nand that distance is really helpful to\nsay this isn't me this is not this is\nnot all about me\nuh doesn't mean you're blaming it on\nsomeone else but you are saying that let\nme distance from this so i can actually\nso i can actually deal with it and work\nthrough it\nuh when you wrote this book and you\ntitled it beautifully why has nobody\ntold me this before\nuh\nwhere do you think\nmental health and well-being are going\nover the next few years you know when i\nthink about things like web 3 the\nmetaverse\nwhen i think about\nobviously social media is continuing to\ngrow\nwhen i look at even people like\nyourself who've you know obviously been\nable to communicate these ideas so\nphenomenally well through tick tock\nyou know we we both know that\nsocial media can be an amazing tool to\nreach out to people to connect with\npeople to serve people to help with\npeople\nbut when you see people navigating their\nmental health and well-being moving\nforward what do you think are\nsustainable daily practices\nthat we need to implement in order to\nlive in a world that is technologically\naccelerated and advanced and isn't\nturning around\nit's going to sound really boring but a\nbit of self-awareness of which can come\nthrough things like journaling something\nquite simple like journaling experience\nthat allows you to\nstop and reflect on experience\nand you know that's a smaller scale of a\nlittle bit of what happens in therapy\nand you know we're talking about those\ncycles then and\nthe way you become\nable to\ntackle a cycle that you're stuck in is\nby first becoming aware of it you know\nif you if you're not aware of what the\nproblem is\nhow do you even begin to think about\nsolutions and\nand so you know even with this kind of\nfast-paced world and everything's online\nand and our attention is being kind of\nstolen from us left right and center\nthe ability to\nstep back and focus on you and your life\nfor a moment\nis really a victory and\nand so i'm a sort of big\num\nadvocate for sort of journaling and\nthings like that and even before i\nsort of did any clinical training i look\nback and when i was sort of growing up\nany time that i was struggling with\ndifferent emotions that i couldn't make\nsense of or a situation that was kind of\ntroubling me my i'm like you i'm not a\nbig kind of talker or i'm very introvert\nand i spend time alone my thing would be\nwrite it down and\nif you write for long enough you can\nbegin to\nsort of make more sense of a situation\nand that's really what we do in therapy\nwhen we're talking about those cycles we\nliterally map them out so we write out\nwhat happens then what happens next what\nhappens next and then it comes back\naround so you you literally get yourself\na map in front of you and by doing that\nyou get this separation\nso you know in the age of kind of social\nmedia growing or all the problems that\nmight come with that\nyou're only able to tackle that and make\nconscious choices about what you want\nfor your life\nif you are able to step back and\nconsider the problem first\nyeah i i'm totally with you on that and\nthat that feels\nand resonates so deeply um for everyone\nwho's been listening or watching today\nwe've just dived into some of my\nfavorite chapters but as i said before\nthere's chapters on motivation emotional\npain grief self-doubt fear stress and a\nmeaningful life uh and what i love about\nthe book is that every section has a\nbeautiful summary with things to think\nabout things to reflect on um there's\nyou know like this whole section
