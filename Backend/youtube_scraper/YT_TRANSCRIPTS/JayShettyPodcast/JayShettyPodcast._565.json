came\nfrom the basis of dance it was how do i\ndo everything with that love how do i\nchoreograph my life and give dance into\neverything i'm doing because it adds joy\nto it to everyone around\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you who come here every week to\nlisten learn and grow now today's guest\nhas been a guest on the podcast before\nthere's very few people have been on the\npodcast twice she is going to be one of\nthem she is one of my dearest friends me\nand riley consider her our family here\nin la she's the one who's made us feel\nso at home and made this place feel like\nhome\nbut beyond all of that\nshe is the founder of class bars and the\nauthor of this incredible new book\ncalled life pass drop your limits rise\nto your potential her name is paul\nkadakia and you need to go and grab this\nbook we're going to put the link at the\ntop of the comments so while you're\nlistening to this interview make sure\nyou go and grab a copy this is launch\nday by all welcome thank you so much for\nhaving me jay thank you for being here\nbecause\ni remember when i sat down with you can\nyou believe it's been three years since\nour first interview wow it's been three\nyears 2019 right was when we launched\nthe podcast you were one of the first\nguests in the first six months yeah it's\nbeen three years now you've got your\namazing new book out yup which i was\nfortunate enough to read before\ni want to start off and i said this\nyesterday when we were doing our\nsummit conversation but\nyou know what i love about you is that\nno one would know how mighty you are\nbecause you never try and make people in\nyour personal life\nfeel that way or understand that like\nwhat i value about you the most is your\nhumility your groundedness your\nsincerity because it's so endearing yeah\nthen when you realize that you're a\npowerhouse it's like wow that\ncombination is so beautiful so i feel\nlike you represent the modern\nentrepreneur\nin the most amazing way\nand i want everyone who's listening\ntoday to connected that yes pile has\nbuilt incredible business and like all\nof this amazing life but it's like the\nheart with which you've done it and how\nyou've protected that heart is is what i\nvalue in you so i wanted to start with\nthat because i really i had to tell you\nand i have to say i give that credit to\nmy parents because\ni think when you've seen people struggle\nand go through something\nand then when you then have the gift to\nbe able to give to others because of the\nhard work of other people i think you\njust are so grateful for the journey and\ni never ever would take any of this for\ngranted oh i love you i know i'm tearing\ni'm thinking about it it's beautiful\nand i'm crying it's you you're thinking\nof your parents does that and your\nparents are amazing and and you know\ni've had the fortune of spending time\nwith them and it's it's so beautiful to\nsee your love for them and connection\nyou know they're so proud of course but\nlet's dive in last time we were here we\nactually talked about the journey of\nlike building class plus we're talking\nabout saar which i want to talk about\ntoday as well pyle founded her own dance\ncompany sar dance company i've seen them\nperform at least three times now and it\nwas absolutely incredible both coasts\nyeah both coasts but let's start with\nthe discovery of\npurpose yes because\nyou were on a certain path\nand then at one point you veered away i\nwant you to help us understand\nwhen did you first understand even\ninternally even if it wasn't in these\nwords what purpose was and that you\nwanted to live for something deeper so i\nreally believe for me it started when i\nwas close to four or five years old and\ni know most people do not discover\npurpose and passion at that age but for\nme and this is a very very interesting\ndynamic because most people would never\nthink a moment like this is how you\nfound it but i went to a party like a\nfamily friend's party from with my\nparents and they asked me to dance and i\ngot onto the dance floor and started\nperforming and of course like it's nice\nto have everyone looking at you and all\nof that but it wasn't about that for me\nit was this feeling that there was\nsomething inside of me that i gave to\nothers right there was magic created\nbetween the audience and me in that\nmoment\nand\ni didn't obviously know it at the time\nso i talk about this and obviously in a\nhindsight way because when you're five\nyears old you're not thinking about this\nstuff but in that moment i felt\nsomething\nsort of come out of me that honestly\nnothing else could compare to and i\nthink when you have something in your\nlife that brings you so much joy brings\nyou so much happiness it's really hard\nto find anything else that's going to\ncompare to it and i know we'll get into\nit whether that's things like money and\nall of that\nand i try to hang on to that feeling\nright and i really believe\nmy life has been a fight to hang on to\nthat feeling and then with class pass it\nwas to share that feeling with others so\nthey could have it in their life as well\nyeah that's so beautiful there's a\nthere's an amazing ancient text in india\nand\nthe verse reads\nwhen you protect your purpose\nyour purpose protects you\nand i love it because you often think of\nyour purpose as something you have to\nfind or create yeah and actually the\nwisdom reminds us it's something you\nhave to protect you already have it yes\ncan you tell us\nbecause last time we talked about the\nwhole journey what i'm more fascinated\nin is\nhaving taken this journey to build a\nbusiness to grow to take your passion\ninto this bigger industry\nhow did you have to protect your purpose\nbecause i think that's something that\npeople don't think about a lot i mean\nthe whole time in my life i truly\nbelieve i fought to dance i i 100\nbelieve that my life even now it's not\neasy and why do i say that it's because\nsociety is has its own expectations of\nme i have you have identity issues where\nyou're like wait can i be doing that i'm\nthis person i'm that person but i have\nlearned to take away a lot of those\nthings and say but no my heart is in\nthis and this is what i love and i love\nwhat you just said about it's already\ninside of you because when i think about\nthe journey of me being corporate\namerica right and i think a lot of\npeople you're in your job you're kind of\ngoing through the motions of it you\ndon't necessarily\ni don't know you don't love what you do\nbut you're in it right because you have\nto pay the bills etc for me you know i\nhad this thing that i was doing on the\nside right but it was fulfilling me\nand the more i started doing it the more\nit gave back to me right so that whole\nprotection side that you were just\ntalking about i truly believe and i talk\nabout this in the book and the\nsynchronicity of the world helping me\nthrough\nwhen i was questioning it as long as i\nfound the time to dance i felt like the\nuniverse was giving me signs whether it\nwas you know i talk about the story\nwhere saw ended up on the cover of the\nart section of the new york times and it\nwas a moment when\neveryone was telling me to go to\nbusiness school\nright and that seemed like the right\npath in everyone else's sense of the\nworld\nand here i was getting this sign from\nthe world telling me i was on the right\npath by following what i loved and all\nthose moments helped me to just continue\nto hang on and i do believe those things\nhappen because it was like a sign from\nthe universe saying keep going in this\ndirection\nbecause the world wants you to do this\nand to me that is protection yeah that's\nthat's such a wonderful way of looking\nat it and you know the times i've seen\nyou dance\nit truly is the most magical experience\nlike seeing someone in their element and\nyou're just fully immersed you're fully\nabsorbed i love that you just said you\nhad to fight to dance\nbecause i think we think that purpose\nshould just flow\nand we think sometimes that the word\nsynchronicity as you used means it just\nkind of happens right but you said you\nhad to fight tell us about how we learn\nto fight for what we care about because\ni think that's not often spoken about we\nthink that if you care about something\nit should just magically manifest\nbut you're fighting like i love that i\nmean in anything in your life you need\nto know what your priorities are they\ncannot be set by other people right and\nthat comes down to\neverything with your professional career\nyour personal life\nyour family right people are always\nasking oh how do you juggle this and\nthat it's because i know what is\nimportant to me and that doesn't come\nfrom anyone else and once i know it's\nimportant those are the things going in\nmy schedule and i don't feel guilty\nabout it it's usually the guilt right\nwhy when i even say i fought to dance it\nwas because once again it was everyone\nwanted me to do other things but the\nmore i thrived in doing it and obviously\nthe more i built a system to really say\nit doesn't really matter what anyone\nelse thinks what matters is what i do\nand what i want to give to the world i\nlearned to prioritize and make sure that\ni put a plan against doing the things i\nloved and i think we forget that we\nforget that it's supposed to be our\npriorities that come first right we put\neveryone else's priorities first and\nit's not selfish to do that at all by\nany means our true purpose\nin the world is to do that thing that we\nwere put on earth to do that's actually\nthe best thing you could do right in the\nworld to be selfless and that's what i\nreally want people to understand and you\nknow i always felt through my journey i\nknow there were moments when i was\nworking so hard and people may have been\nlike hey pyle like you know you've been\nm.i.a for so long like you missed this\nand you missed that\nbut i woke up every day and i knew even\nthough i had maybe no customers at the\ntime i knew that i was trying to solve a\nproblem and obviously once i did it all\nmade sense but in my heart i knew i was\non a mission right we forget what that\nfeels like to be on a mission but there\nis nothing that feels comparable when\nyou're on that mission to make an impact\nin the world and i think that's truly\nlike the heart of all of this for me i\nlove that you use that phrase there\nbecause i think when you talk to any\nreal\nsuccessful entrepreneurs they all were\ntrying to solve a problem yeah they\nweren't trying to build a billion dollar\ncompany they weren't trying to build a\ncompany on the front of forbes they\nweren't trying to build a company that\ngets acquired like i think we hear those\nterms so much now\nand it's like almost like people set\nthemselves up for failure because they\nstart a company to exit right or they\nstart a company to sell it right whereas\nwhenever i've talked to you for years\nyou've always talked about this idea of\nsolving a problem can you walk us\nthrough how that is a amazing way to\nunlock your potential\nbecause i think it's something we don't\nconsider i actually had a conversation\njust like this\ni was back in london during during\nchristmas right and i was driving to an\nevent and i met someone\nand he was saying to me that i think you\nknow i just need to make more money like\nhow do i make more money and i\nappreciate that right a lot of us need\nto make more money and find new ways to\nwe all have responsibilities\nand i said to him i said well let's ask\nthis question differently i said what if\nyou ask the question what problem can i\nsolve and i said i'm sure you're going\nto come up with way more ways to make\nmoney than if you think how can i make\nmoney right because when you ask the\nquestion how can i make money then you\nonly think of that those things walk us\nthrough how\nyou really focus on a problem and how to\nproblem solve as an mit dancing ceo\nthere's so many parts to that um let me\ni'll start a little bit with the\nbeginning of how my idea of what problem\ncame to me right and\ni think what's really interesting is\nthrough my life i was living many\nidentities so i was indian i was\namerican i was this dancer girl in the\nmiddle of a business world i never felt\nlike i could fit in and when i met the\ncareer field of entrepreneurship which\nwas 10 years ago this was not something\nthat most people were doing at the time\ni actually saw it as just a way to be\nfree right i saw it as a way to\nimpact the world and solve a problem i\ndidn't see it as\nyou know the fame or having this many\npeople my team or any of that and i\nactually think to be honest and i spent\na little bit of time my first few years\nbecause you kind of get thrown into this\nincubator world of tech startup momentum\nand you start doing like things for\nbrand and you start doing things to\nraise money and to get press and you\nforget about that main point and i had\nto go back to that and so the reason i\nfound my problem was because i faced it\nright and i think that is such a great\nway to find a problem to solve in the\nworld it's what are you struggling with\nand most of the times i think the best\nideas come out of your own struggles i\nmean uber did that airbnb did that and\nit really did i went to go find a ballet\nclass and it sounds so simple\ni couldn't find it so i decided to solve\nthat problem right and there was\nobviously more to that right this wasn't\njust a okay let's solve it with tech\nthis was really for me\ni had been fighting to dance my whole\nlife i wanted to take this fight to\nother people right so that kind of in a\nway\ngoes a deeper level than the what the\nwhat is it goes down to the y you know\nthat we always talk about is there's a\none layer deeper to that why but i think\nwhen you have a problem to solve in the\nworld the reason it's so important is\nbecause how do you know when you've\nsolved it and if you are just going out\nthere to build a company how do you\nmeasure your impact right when you talk\nabout purpose and all of that\nand it's not that you need to be able to\nmeasure it like doing good is doing good\nright if it's two people one people one\nperson it doesn't matter if it's 100\nit's great that you're giving but i\nthink for me when i realized people were\ngoing to class because of our product\nand you know even yesterday i was\ntalking to someone and they were like oh\nmy god i just want to tell you like i\nfound all these new studios in los\nangeles because of class fest i'm like\nthis story never gets old to me because\ni know how impactful going to one class\nis for one person you know and i think\nyou have to really be bought in to the\nsolution that you're solving for because\nit can't feel like okay i checked it off\nand i'm done and i think that's where\nsome people get stuck to it's not a one\nand done it's a journey and it's a\nconstant journey that that keeps going\nforward but the other side of this a\nlittle bit in the foundational thing so\nyeah i had a great education that helped\nme you know learned to problem solve\nfrom mit and i worked at a consulting\nfirm so i did have the mindset but you\nknow what i think of the success behind\nmy company truly comes from my\ncreativity it does not come from the\nfact that i had all these skills and\nthis experience i obviously that set me\nup very well and it gave me a great\nnetwork but the true magic came from my\nhustle came from my discipline it came\nfrom\neverything else that i cared about and i\nfelt made me see this problem in a\ndifferent way in a unique way than\nanyone else was looking at it and that's\nreally i think what people have to think\nabout when they're going out to solve a\nproblem is what's that unique problem\nonly you can solve\nright and you we were talking about this\ni think yesterday but it's also then\nwhat do you have the expertise to do\nyeah right like i knew what classes felt\nlike what tech person in the world\ncombined with someone who loved class\nwas ever going to come together to be\nable to solve this problem and i i say\nthis now obviously with a lot of\nconfidence but obviously when i was\ngoing through it\ni felt\nembarrassed for parts of me right like\noh do i not know tech enough okay wait\ndo i you know how am i gonna do that oh\nno like should i hide my dance side all\nof that you know but you learn that the\nmore you do something that is so in line\nwith what your purpose is all that stuff\ngoes away yeah i i really appreciate\nwhat you said\nbecause when you're building something\ntruly focusing on how this helps one\nperson yes one case study one user and\nwhen you can take one person on a\njourney from a to z\nthat journey helps you help a hundred\npeople a thousand people a million\npeople a billion people if you can't get\nthat to work for one person\nyou're not going to be able to scale it\nand i think often we think no but i want\nto help a million people and i want my\ncompany to have a hundred thousand\ncustomers and it doesn't start there it\nstarts with that one use case that one\nperson this is i actually think the\nbiggest mistake that entrepreneurs make\ntoday\nis they go in trying to solve for these\nbig data numbers and they forget that\ndata doesn't do your thinking for you\nright and the magic of especially\nlifestyle brands and companies the magic\nhappens in the customer-to-customer\ninteraction and how someone feels from\nyour product and how they like it and\nenjoy it like you said it's it's\neverything from coming to the website to\npurchasing it you know and everyone gets\nkind of caught up on like launch day\nyeah but you know what you launch every\nday as if as a founder especially of a\nconsumer company you launch every single\nday because someone new is finding you\nand i think that's a shift in the\nmindset that a lot of people need to\nhave and i love that i mean it's so true\ni think some people they forget that if\nnot even doing it for one they raise all\nthis money and they build all this\nmomentum but they haven't proven\nthe fact that it works for one person\nyeah well said tell us about what you\njust brought up there because\nwe've talked about this as well and it's\ninteresting for me asking you this\nbecause now when i talk about having\nlived as a monk people are always like\noh yeah jay talks about that and and\nthere'll be some people to be like oh\nwell he's talking about it because it\nsounds cool and i'm like i actually was\nembarrassed when i went back into the\nworkplace to tell people i'd lived as a\nmonk interesting because they didn't\nhave so it wasn't that it was some some\npeople say and i know no one who listens\nto the podcast but some people say well\noj does that because it makes him\nuh sound like he's done something\namazing with his life and i'm like no no\nno actually when i first came back in\nthe workplace i was insecure about it\nright because it was like you're three\nyears behind right like i'm 26 years old\nin a 21 year old graduate position right\nbecause you didn't do the path everyone\nelse i didn't do your path and so\nactually i was scared of sharing my\nexperience\nbecause i saw it as a weakness i thought\nif people know i've been a monk that\nthey're gonna like be able to use that\nagainst me because then i haven't had\nthe experience they've had and so i've\nexperienced that imposter syndrome too\nand even now when i'm in media sometimes\nit's the other way around where i'm\nsitting in a table and i'm like why am i\nat this table like you know so imposter\nsyndrome's always there absolutely and\nyou're saying that you had it of course\nthere is confidence now but there's also\nthat's insecurity still today of course\nand it was there then\nwalk us through how you dealt with it\nthen like when you were like i'm a\ndancer but here i have to be a ceo and\nof course you know\nwomen entrepreneurs and female\nentrepreneurs like that whole journey is\nadded to this whole journey of you as an\nindividual\nhow did you handle it then of\nwhat were the mistakes you made that's\nwhat i was gonna say i was gonna start\nwith the mistakes well let me tell you\nall the ways i did it wrong because to\nbe honest i think for the first half of\nmy life most of what i did with a lot of\nthese identity issues that i think we\nall face is i just separated them put\nlike indian pile in one place put\namerican pile here put dancer pile here\nbusiness pile here and i built my own\nworlds right so like they were all just\nvery separate and you know because i was\ntype a i was like let me succeed at\nbeing all of them right that was sort of\nmy way of learning how to do well and\nbuild skill great so that was what i\noriginally did i think for me a few\nthreads started happening the indian\namerican one sort of came together with\ndance right and as i started feeling\nlike i had an environment to succeed in\nand that was thriving it helped me be\nboth sides of who i was right and i\nthink people underestimate their\nenvironments that they're in and they\nare sometimes put in environments that\ndo not serve them and their authenticity\nand you really need to question it you\ndo not need to stay in place that is\ntrying to suppress you and i mean i\nalways think about this i'm sure there\nare people who i worked with in\ncorporate america when i i literally was\nprobably quiet i was like i tried to\nlike disappear in the room who were\nprobably like that girl but that built\nthat company you know because i wasn't\nin the right environment you know and\nand it really depends on where you are\ni think for business and sort of\ncreative dancer file what happened\noriginally like i remember when i went\ngo to fundraise i would like show up in\nthese business suits and i'm a petite\nhuman being so i always felt\nuncomfortable i always felt like i was\nlike drowning in the clothes and and\ndidn't feel like you know i could be you\nknow the tiny but mighty person i feel\nlike i can be sometimes and i remember\nnever feeling great in those meetings\nbecause i almost like over rehearsed\nlike data i over rehearsed like all the\nfinance number numbers and all the\nthings that actually didn't matter at\nall\nand i started to realize and this took\nme a minute and i remember actually this\nconversation i was sitting with someone\nin my tech stars company um group he was\nanother ceo and he's like pile you've\nclearly like succeeded in your life you\nhave a formula a pattern of success in\nyour life what is yours like follow that\nif this is not working and as he asked\nme that i broke it down to wait and so i\nknow how to like succeed in dance right\ni've been able to like get the dry job\nand what do i do it's like i go and\nstudy i rehearse i try and find a way\nfor it to connect to me and authenticity\nwith storytelling and i realized i was\nmissing that whole side of it from\npitching my company because i was\nwalking in like a robot like how was\nanyone going to like me i didn't like me\nand i think that's really when i\nrealized i needed to be the full version\nof who i was and so i started walking\ninto those rooms and i would be wearing\nmy leggings instead of wearing a\nbusiness suit and i think people were\nlike you are the right person and by the\nway mit was never gonna leave me right\nlike bane was never gonna leave me i\nstill had that credibility i needed to\nwear that in a way that made me feel\nconfident and over time i just stopped\nseeing any of the differences and i\nthink that's really the most important\nthing i would tell people is at some\npoint you just have to actually embrace\nall those things that make you different\nand know that your journey set you up to\nbe that successful in that moment to do\nwhatever you were going to do going\nforward yeah that that that's so so\npowerful like what you've just said\nbecause the challenge is that\nwe only attract the right people into\nour lives when we don't hide parts of\nourselves because if you hide parts of\nyourselves you're only attracting\nwhat they find attractive\nis parts that you haven't hidden\nand it can be really uncomfortable to\nnot hide parts of yourself because\nchances are most people aren't going to\nvibe with you but the right people are\nyeah and i think that's what you're\nwaiting for and i think it's really\nscary to go into a room\nand have the\nuh there's a brilliant book i read\nrecently called the courage to be\ndisliked okay and i was like that's\nreally what you need is that we all need\nthe courage to be able to walk into a\nroom\nand be okay with that this person may\nnot vibe with me right but there will be\nsomeone who will right and\nwalk us through\nwhat do you think i want to hear this\nbecause i i think your dance experience\nis just it's what gravitated me towards\nyou so that's another perfect example of\nwhat we're just saying when i first\ndiscovered you on instagram it was like\ni just saw you posting i was like wow\nthis is amazing like who's this american\nindian girl or indian american girl\nwho's posting these girl woman uh who's\nposting these he's posting these\nincredible like very classical\ntimeless work of art pictures of dance\nwith sardan's company and i was just\nlike this is just i've never seen\nsomething like this before tell me about\nwhat you think dance taught you about\nlife oh yeah because\ni i think you live the way you dance\nyeah and i hope to i mean i i always say\nlike i hope i'm choreographing through\nlife you know and i used to always feel\nexactly when i was walking through like\nthe streets of new york i just felt like\ni was dancing and you know when you meet\nlike the burst at starbucks like i feel\nlike you give that energy if you feel\nlike that and and i do feel it it's like\nit's an enlightenment and it's this is\nwhy you need a musical this is why\nthis is why pyle if you direct musicals\nor theater productions or movie please\nreach out because yeah when you said\nthat all i visualized you was like doing\na musical where you're like singing and\ndancing and walking to the bridge as an\naside and this is actually a really\nfunny funny story is when i was younger\nlike literally like five years old my\nparents would take long drives right my\nsister would be like looking out the\nwindow and i would put headphones on and\nlisten to bollywood tracks and literally\nsee people dancing in the mountains in\nmy head like i have been choreographing\nsince i was so young in my head like i\ndon't know why but probably watching too\nmany bollywood films when i was younger\nbut i just i don't know i just saw the\nworld that way i just thought that's how\npeople work together so as an aside um\nbut going back to what dance has taught\nme i think to start with that i have to\ngo back to ushanti who is my dance\nteacher who literally taught me\nobviously not just how to dance but she\ntaught me how to show up to life right\nin india we talk about gurujis right a\nlot and it's someone who bestows\nknowledge upon you you respect them\nbecause\nthe one thing that's indestructible is\nknowledge right\nshe of course was teaching me steps you\nknow and at the time i didn't\nnecessarily appreciate everything i was\nlike wait i want to go and have fun with\nmy friends but she was teaching me about\nwhere i had come from right the women of\nindia my ancestors which made me feel\nmuch more stronger in who i was even\nthough once again i didn't know it at\nthe time but she also you know she\nexpected us to be on time right she\nexpected us to practice she expected us\nto have our hair up and i know it sounds\na little forced and it can you know some\npeople are like oh wow like that she's\nso strict but i am so glad i had her in\nmy life and even today she is one of the\nfirst people i call to be like hey i'm\ndealing with this what should i do\nbecause she will give me\nthe toughest but the best advice right\nshe and she even the other day i think i\nsent her a dance video and she's like\nyou know i'm not going to praise you so\nif you're sending it something to me i'm\ngoing to give you real feedback and i\nlove that you know because it keeps me\ngrowing in everything that i do and i\nthink as i grew up and started dancing\nmore so college is sort of this other\ntime that happened in my life when once\nagain like i'm a tiny person i'm the\nbaby of my family i didn't know what it\nmeant to be a leader right i had never\ntaken on that role and i think in\nanything in our lives right people don't\nrealize you can take a leadership role\nin the smallest thing it could be\nliterally planning a family vacation\nright it's really just about learning\nhow you work and how you lead with like\na vision right and so for me even at\ncollege it probably started with\nchoreographing 40-person dance shows\nright when how do you organize people\nlike that and think about communicating\nright and getting everyone to move in\nthe same way there is no difference\nbetween that and running a team and then\nby the time i started saw and i was\nbuilding confidence because i was good\nat executing these shows and these\nperformances and people were gravitating\ntowards it because they were like wow\nyou're really good at what you do and\nwhich helped me build confidence even\nthough once again this was a side thing\ni did my whole life and so at the time i\nwas building saw\nand started you know putting down money\ntowards like doing big shows in new york\ncity\nand seeing like indian celebrities want\nto come to it seeing a sellout shows you\nknow the week before\nseeing my ability to net you know find a\nstage manager and a lighting designer\nwhen i didn't know that world at all\nlike i was in the business world i\ndidn't have any idea and i was in the\nmiddle of new york city to see a lot of\nthat just made me believe in my ability\nto execute and i think we forget how\nimportant execution is and the\nconfidence it gives you right so you can\nhave an idea but if you've never really\ncompleted something in your life you\ndon't know right and you know in in the\nsmallest form like class pass to me\nliterally started with 100 person dance\nshow because that was the first thing i\never did that was sort of my own with a\nvision and i got people to come and band\nagainst and you know what those some of\nthose people who came to that first show\nof mine became my investors in class\npass and i think everything is connected\nbecause my other point on this is i\nalways did good work right because i was\nalways doing what i loved right it\nwasn't do good work because the world is\ntelling me to do good work it was i like\nto put my heart into things it was the\nonly way i knew\nhow to operate and i think that came\nfrom the basis of dance it was how do i\ndo everything with that love how do i\nchoreograph my life and give dance into\neverything i'm doing because it adds joy\nto it to everyone around yeah i think\nthat point that you made is so\nimportant because\nyou were doing everything you did with\nlove care and attention so people when\nthey saw you whether you were dancing or\nwhether you're in a meeting they could\ntrust\npile does things with love care and\nattention and that's why the people who\ncame to your dance show became your\ninvestors the problem is we see\neverything as disconnected we think well\nthat's what i love and that's what i\nhate or that's what i really want to do\nand that's not what i want to do but\nactually when you approach even things\nyou don't want to do right with love\ncare and attention right people take\nnote\nand then that starts to become a\nconnection like the fact that you used\nwhat you learned in dance to choreograph\nteams just that idea if anyone's\nlistening to that right now you may be\ngoing to a job every day that you don't\nlike but i promise you there's a skill\nin your personal life that you love that\nyou can apply there or there's a skill\nin that workplace that you can apply to\nyour personal life and all of a sudden\nit becomes meaningful yeah i spent years\nworking at accenture which was not my\npurpose or not my passion however when i\nlook back on it i see it as some of the\nbest training i ever received because i\nlearned so many invaluable skills right\nthat i would never have learned anywhere\nelse right you can either look at that\nexperience and negate it and think oh\nwell that was a waste of time or we can\ngo well what's the one thing i got there\nthat actually helps me build what i'm\nbuilding which is your journey i mean\nlet's let's dive into when you're\nchoreographing life which i just love\neven just that is just such a beautiful\nthought\nmentors\nis not something that you left just for\ndance as well mentorship is something\nwhat i saw in you\nyou've constantly chosen to be humble\nand want to learn from everyone around\nyou\nhow did you as you became more\nsuccessful remain grounded to one advice\nwhen i think so many people when as\ntheir career grows they almost think\nwell now people should come to me for\nadvice how did you keep that balance\nbecause\ni've seen you do it yeah but i don't i\nthink it's quite surprising to a lot of\npeople in general not about you but in\ngeneral i think as human beings we can\nconstantly grow and maybe this is you\nknow deep rooted for me in the way i was\ntaught with ushanti with i will never be\nand be able to know all the knowledge of\neven dance in my life right and i think\nwhen you think about that and learning a\nskill that could literally be a lifelong\nlearning journey\nall of this can be even entrepreneurship\nlike class pass was a journey my\nbusiness journey everything gets me one\nstep further and i think the power of it\nis keeping myself growing with teachers\nright i mean that's the basis of class\npasses we should never in our lives ever\nbe at a place where we want to stop\ngrowing and learning i think the second\nwe do we we get bored and we get sad and\nwhat's the journey right it's it becomes\nmeaningless and what are you gonna do\nsitting there at the top by yourself\nanyway what is that you know there's\nalways more to do and really there's\nalways more to give right i think that's\nreally where it comes from but you know\ni think obviously like there are times\nin my life and i actually have to\nbalance it right now because a lot of\npeople do want my advice which is why i\nwrote my book because i felt like that\nwas a responsible way for me to do it\nbut at the same time like i have to also\nlimit that to be able to say wait i want\nto grow too and i think that's a really\ninteresting thing to even think about at\nthis point in my life is you know what's\ngoing to inspire me what's going to help\nme grow and i'm constantly thinking\nabout that what friends do i want to\nspend time with right what mentors do i\nneed because i'm going through like a\nshift right now you know i'm very very\nconscious and self-aware of where i am\nand i think that really adds to it but\nat the end of the day like i i would\nnever want someone to ever feel like\nthey are the smartest person in the\nworld i mean i don't like working with\npeople like that to be honest that's\njust like not my not my way of working\num but there are people and i think a\nlot of times sadly that actually comes\nfrom insecurity right it's a defense\nmechanism it's a defense mechanism and\nso i think when you truly are confident\nin a way you\ndon't have to prove anything yeah and i\nthink that's what people have to\nremember it's it's not about acting\nlike you're smart yeah it's truly\nabout just being able to to live and be\nwithout society making you feel like\nyou're insecure so let me act a certain\nway because it comes across unnatural i\nthink you've just hit on a really\nimportant point part of our imposter\nsyndrome comes\nfrom us thinking we have to say\nsomething or we have to be at this table\nbecause we have something to offer\nthe smartest people in the world ask\nmore questions than they talk yeah like\nthey're actually thinking about like oh\nwell what can i learn from this person\nor how can i learn from this person and\nso when you go into somewhere we think\nconfidence means talking the most\nand confidence actually means being\nconfident to say i don't know and let me\nask the most and so if you're sitting\nhere listening to this going well jay if\ni was in an environment with mentors and\npeople i wouldn't know what to say ask\nquestions right like asking questions is\nis the safest way to learn one of the\nthings i love about this book pile is\nnot only is it your story but it's so\npractical and i just want to hold up\nsome things to some people so you can\nsee that you know there's there's these\nbeautiful moments in this book that you\ntake this opportunity to make things\nreally practical and asking people to\nreflect\nuh and and i love that because often\nthese books when they're written by\nentrepreneurs it's like here's my story\nand here's how it's right and and yours\ndoesn't do that\num yours continues to give people\nsystems and frameworks a lot of\ncheckpoints and advice on top of you\nknow the stories and especially the\nconstraints i've been through but at the\nend of the day we all face roadblocks\nand our lives and\ni really believe and you know this about\nme like you can take any of them away if\nyou just try and if you put a plan\ntogether right my whole system has been\nreally about\nthinking about what the plan is right so\nif i don't have enough money okay what\nis my plan\nto have enough money\nright it's not about giving up on the\ndream it's about planning for it yeah\nand let's let's dive into that when when\nyou were writing this book i remember we\ntalked about the word constraints a lot\nyeah and and limits is is is the is the\nword are constraints\nreal\nno i mean that's really what i want\npeople to see is that\nyou can find a way through\nacross any tree that's fallen in the\nforest right especially if you know your\ntrue north it's really about finding\nyour way through it it is not about\nstopping at the tree and then stopping\ngoing to where you want to go and i\nthink that's really what people need to\nsee is how do i maneuver my way to not\nlose track of where i want to go\nand they don't they don't exist they\nreally don't and you can really find a\nway to work through it you need to do a\nlot of self-reflection understand how\nyou work and then go and do it action\nright is really the best way to move\nforward yeah and one of the biggest\nmistakes you think when we make plans\nbecause i love this topic yeah because i\nwas sharing with everyone recently when\ni was on the today show for the\nbeginning of the year i was saying to\neveryone that we need to shift from goal\nsetting to growth setting yeah so we\nkeep setting these big goals i want to\ndo this i want to be this\nbut it's like the growth like what\nskills do i need what's my plan what's\nmy approach like that's what you should\nbe focused on it's like saying i want to\ndo a podcast with pyle and you can have\nthat as a goal but it's like whoa have\nwe thought about what we need to build a\npodcast\nyeah so walk us through what are the\nmistakes we make when we create plans or\ndo we even create plans because i'm not\nsure we do i think we just set these\ndisguises this is a great and by the way\nthe whole i know the whole book explains\nwell the whole last third of this book\nis the life pass method which is my i\ncall it goal-setting method but really\nwhat it comes down to is these\nitty-bitty goals which are so minute\nthat they do not feel big at all but\nlike you said it's about getting started\nand the way i've thought about it and it\nhelps to solve a lot of the problems is\ni first start with you reflecting\nbecause you need to know where you are\ntoday before you start setting goals and\na lot of times we start setting goals\nwithout really taking stock of where we\nare today so that's sort of mistake one\nright then the second one is i go into a\ndream mode right which is what do i want\nto do and do any be in a year but that\nis not about check marks like i'm going\nto run a marathon and buy a house and\nall these big things like you just said\ni like to anchor them in in words in\nfeelings how do i want to feel in a year\ni love that because that's something i\ncan you know can really put intention\nbehind right and put into my body i can\ngo back to and feel like am i going\ntowards that or not where\nyou know run like i said running a\nmarathon is just a check mark in our\nlife then the next part of it to me and\nthis is because i'm super analytical and\nlike love time i think people really\nneed to think about where they spend\ntheir time so this whole next part about\nfocusing you cannot set goals in every\naspect of your life\nall the time it's never going to work\nright you're never going to be able to\nmake an impact on every aspect of your\nlife you're probably going to end up\nfailing and then being able to feel like\nyou can't do anything so my structure in\nthe third step is really all about\nfocusing in on three to five areas of\nyour life that you can focus on right\nand so that might be like okay my family\nsome friends and work right and you get\nto the point once you're there and then\nthe like the last part of this and this\nis i think what i feel like i've done\nreally well throughout my life is i know\nhow to set the goal right because it's\nall it's not even a goal like you said\nit's really about the action you need to\ntake to get to where you want to go and\nyou know pretend you want to go and\nlearn tennis right a lot of people would\nbe like yeah okay i'm going to play\ntennis and the whole year will go by and\nthey'll never sign up it literally comes\ndown to maybe it's take one hour to get\non to the internet and search for three\ninstructors near you find reviews on\nthem sign up for one class even if you\ndon't go to the class in that three\nmonth period that you're doing this\nexercise you're still making progress\nbecause you at least are getting closer\nto doing that first class right because\nuntil you actually go and show up to\nthat first lesson you haven't gotten\nanywhere in that goal and i think that's\nwhat people forget and there's a lot of\nmistakes you you know people don't share\ntheir goals i think you should always be\nso proud of what you want to do you'd be\nso surprised\nhow much your friends and family will\nsupport you if they know what you really\nwant to accomplish in your life so it's\ni mean i have a lot of that i know i\nknow that's yeah it was yeah it was a\nloaded question because no it's like\nthat\nit is but like you said i do think um\npeople make a lot of mistakes here and\nit's really like i said and this is you\nknow one way of thinking about it it\nreally comes down to having a practice\nfor yourself of how do i look inward\nfocus myself and then set goals and feel\nthe confidence of i said these goals i\ndid it okay great let's set bigger goals\nnext time right you can only get to the\nbigger goal if you start with a smaller\nstep and fulfill that when you have a\ndream\nand it feels really big\nthe question is what's the smallest\nthing i can do right now right like\nwhat's the what's the first thing and\nthat's what you just broke down it was\nlike i want to play tennis every day or\nevery this year but it's like\nlet me just find an instructor that's\nvery achievable right right and i think\nthat's the point that i remember sitting\ndown with a friend once and he really\nwanted\nto direct theater shows\nand i was like that's a big goal and we\nliterally just broke it down to the\ntiniest thing he could do today like\nthat's and it's literally like with\nsomething like that i think i have it in\nmy book it's like even watch three three\nplays yes yes right like i know it's\nweird but it's like watching three plays\nand actually it's funny right i think\nyou you've talked about this a lot\nsometimes people think like watching\nstuff that we enjoy\nit's part of your goals too right so a\nlot of times people be like oh that's\nlike leisure time i don't have time to\nwatch the plays but no you just put it\nas a part of your plan towards your\ngoals so in a way sometimes doing these\nprocesses of setting goals makes you\nalso realize like the reason you're\ninclined to watch that movie it's\nbecause you need inspiration right now\nin your life and that is still\nlike fulfilling it is not about you\nbeing like lazy right and i think that's\nthat i never feel lazy even when i'm\nlike chilling i think we talk about this\na lot is like sometimes we need that\ntime right and that's like a part of\nscheduled time in a way that i know i\nneed to replenish i never think of it as\ni'm being lazy i mean our times are are\nso busy but i think we have to think\nabout what we need\nnot just professionally and not just to\nlike an obligation of other people it's\nalso what we need to keep moving forward\nyes definitely definitely and that's\nwhat\nwhat i find so\nfascinating about what you just said is\nthat\nwe\nget lost in just how big it is and it\nfeels so heavy yeah and it feels so far\nand it feels so out of reach that we\njust give up right and i'll give an\nexample of something right now so i'm at\na stage where we're growing and i really\nwant to\nbe a good leader\nand that's something that's new to me in\nthis world of work uh if i was a leader\nin the monastery it was different to\nbeing a leader here and so my goal is to\nread a chapter a day of this book that\ni've been reading called the culture\ncode which is just a phenomenal book\nabout that and i've been doing that when\ni was reading your book i was feeling\nlike i was growing in so many\nentrepreneurial ways right i was sitting\nhere reading live parts when you sent it\nto me in advance and i was like oh wow\nlike this is what i need to do with\npeople and this is what i need to do\nwith time and so your goal right now if\nyou have a passion is just read life\npass like literally like no genuinely\nthat can be as simple as it is like you\nmay say i've got a passion i have a goal\ni want to build it into something real\nand when we say something real\nit could be\nit doesn't have to be a billion dollar\ncompany it could mean something that\ntakes care of me and my family right\nright like it can be that yeah but then\napply what you're learning here and your\ngoal right now could just be i'm going\nto read a chapter of this book a day i'm\ngoing to read a chapter a week right i'm\ngoing to read a chapter a month and and\nyou break that down like that you're\ngoing to start seeing these mindsets get\ninto your psychology and that's really\nwhat we're talking about here is that\nit's psychological exactly it's about\ncreating a habit of doing this right\nit's not about doing this once nothing's\ngoing to happen if you know we always\ntalk about that you can't do something\nonce it's about building a practice\nabout how you also can trust yourself\nright how do you get into a place where\nthis becomes about\nyou being excited about it no you know\ngoal setting list should be a to-do list\nright nothing in your life should feel\nlike a to-do list it should feel\nexciting like it's moving you forward\nbut you're the only person who can tell\nyourself that yeah let's talk a bit\nabout zayn oh uh it was his it was his\nsecond birthday yeah\nliterally last weekend\nand he's so grown up i mean he is so\ngrown up watching him grow over the last\ntwo years yeah you've had one you know\nbecause of of the pandemic it's great\nthat he's happy\nyeah and i felt like the last three\nmonths he grew even more because i\ndidn't see him because i was in london\nand i was just like what else he's so\ntall but\nlet's talk about\nwhat you're learning through motherhood\nbecause i think that\nthat's a new chapter in your life\nit's a new new chapter a new space a new\nmove for you and it's like\nuh\nthat requires different growth and what\nif what are you learning personally from\nmotherhood that you think you didn't\nlearn from other things i mean nothing\nprepares you for motherhood until you\nbecome a mother and obviously there was\na lot of changes that happened because\ncove had happened right when he was born\nbut i think outside of that what i've\nhad to really just be conscious of once\nagain my time which i always was but\neven more so i think it was easier when\nyou know i would feel guilt or not feel\nguilty about like going to an event or\nsomething it's really hard when you're\nlike oh i just want to spend time with\nmy baby you know uh so there's there's\nhard times but i love what i do i think\nit's made it more important for me to\nlove the work i do right because i will\nalways be an ambitious woman and i want\nto you know i really think it's so\nimportant for for women to know they can\nalways be ambitious at any point in\ntheir life you have to build a support\nstructure around that is another thing\ni've learned right like this is you know\nme and nick talking nick is my husband\num you know it's me and him talking\nabout like what support structure do i\nneed right like we have this book coming\nout it was that's why like my family is\nhere everyone because i'm like what you\nneed support in order to do these things\nin our lives and i think a lot of times\nespecially as women we don't always know\nhow to ask for help\nand you know a baby is a 24 7 job and\nthey're great you know but you need to\nbe able to also know how to take care of\nyourself do the things that you still\nlove or you will be you know completely\nyou know just doing one thing the whole\ntime and i think that's it's obviously\nyou have to figure out your choice in\nthat um and then the last thing is like\ni think a lot of it comes down to also\nfiguring out with expectations of\nsociety i do think like there's a lot of\nthings that still happen to mothers you\nknow feeling like you should be doing\nthis and not um and maybe that's a\nblessing of covet is i just like wasn't\naround society that much so i think i\njust got to develop my own bond with my\nson in my way i you know i wasn't around\nanyone else to be like is this the right\nway or wrong way and i think you know i\nget i feel like a kid with him i think\nthat's like my favorite\nfavorite thing is you just play with him\nyeah you know and it's just it's just\nreally beautiful to experience the world\nthrough his eyes you know it's beautiful\nto watch you guys together like i love\nseeing zayn like want to run away to you\nall the time but it's like\nwhat i think is really healthy is you\nknow i was on i was on chelsea handlers\npodcast last week\nand she does this segment where she\ninvites people on from her audience to\ntalk through their challenges and and\nsomeone came on and they were just being\nan honest mom like yeah just being\nhonest and saying look i love my kid\nbut i'm really struggling to find time\nfor myself yeah i feel like i'm losing\nmyself like i'm losing my identity and i\nwas just like i was so happy to hear\nthat honesty and that vulnerability and\neven what you're saying today it's like\ni still have to have my like i still\nhave to find a way because i love my\nchild but\ni still have me yeah and you know when i\nsee zayn and it's like he loves music\nand and he loves dancing and it's like\nhe obviously when he watches you is he\nis being inside the other day i think i\nwas i had saw rehearsal and he came into\nmy studio and then my mom was like what\nwas mama doing in the in you know and he\ncalls in my office and he starts dancing\nyou know he's like you know because and\ni'm like i'm really happy because i\ndidn't grow up with that right i didn't\ngrow up with someone being creative\nalways around me and thinking like\nthat's a way to live and i was thinking\nabout that like i want him\nto feel like he could be anything in his\nlife right and and not force him to sort\nof live by a certain standard or a\ncertain path and i think um that's\nreally beautiful and and you know i i\nthink\nin general for women and you know and i\nobviously i think these last two years\nwere personally actually harder for me\nbecause i had to work through these\nthings and i haven't had to work work\nmyself out of expectations and out of\nsort of structures the world in so long\nlike i started class past 10 years ago i\nwas in it and i remember going back to\nand actually in a weird way like as i\nwas writing this book it all was coming\nback to me too where i was 10 years ago\nto be like wow i need to break these\nboundaries again on expectations and i\nhadn't gone through that in a while so\njust kind of going back to that going\nback to a sense of the center right\nbecause i was on such a strong momentum\nmy whole life and then i had a kid and\ni just realized i had to like rethink so\nmuch and re-center right and so in a\nweird way my own book even helped me you\nknow i think that's like the beauty of\nthese books is when you're writing them\nthey they give back to you and i\nremember moments especially in the past\nyou know a few years where i was like\nwow i remember the feeling of where i\nwas 10 years ago and sometimes i feel\nlike i am right back there and i have to\ni'm going through all of this again and\ni think that's why it's so important to\nrealize this is a muscle to work through\nconstraints it is not and it's a mindset\nright it is not about okay i'm gonna do\nit once and it's gone you have to\nconstantly work through it and if you\nreally care enough which is what we\nstarted with then you will you will find\na way i love it and that's and that's\nwhy i think this is a book that people\ncan read again and again and again\nbecause like you said as soon as you\nfinish something or complete something\nit's incredible how the constraints just\ncome rushing back to the next phase of\nlife right and we keep putting new\nlimits wherever we get to and that's why\nwhen you're saying to us to drop your\nlimits and rise to particular like\nthat's something that we're going to do\nagain and again and again and so whether\nyou're someone at the start of your\njourney or whether you're someone who's\nhad some success and achievement and\nthen you're trying to find your way\nyou know\nthis book life pass will actually help\nyou in all areas of that because it's\nthe same thing we keep going through\nagain and again and again\npyle you are amazing i'm so grateful i\nam hoping that each and every single\nperson goes and grabs a copy of lifepass\nit's available right now we will put the\nlink in the comments go and order your\ncopy order one for a friend uh i also\nthink it's just so one of the things\nthat i loved when i moved here is that\nwe've built such a beautiful community\nof south asians in l.a who've connected\nwith each other just through genuine\nfriendship and family\nand i feel so\nyou know grateful to have that have that\nfeeling because it's always nice being\naround people who share that culture and\nand share that heritage with you even\nthough we grew up in different countries\nand you know to see you doing so well\nand to see you sharing your story and i\nknow that it just comes from a place of\nwanting to help people yeah and that's\nand that's why i'm recommending this\nbook so much is because i know that in\nyour heart\nit's like you only wrote it to help\npeople like that's the only reason i\nknow that this journey of writing this\nbook is hard yeah writing a book is not\neasy and you had a baby at the same time\nand it's like and you're doing so many\nother things and so i know that you\nbrought this book only to help people to\ngive yeah 100 i just want people the\nsame way with class pass it's an\nextension of that right it is an\nextension of the vision of class west\nwith helping people fight through\nanything in their life to live their\ndream and\ni feel that i have done that and i feel\nlike i'm still doing that and i never\nwant any anything to stand in anyone's\nway i love that pile these are your\nfinal five which are our rapid fire\nround so you have to answer in one word\nor one sentence max okay all right uh\npile these are your final five question\nnumber one\nwhat is the best advice you ever\nreceived best advice to bet on myself\nwhat is the worst advice you ever\nreceived to stop dancing\ni can't believe anyone ever said that\nthat's amazing all right third question\nuh how would you define your current\npurpose\nto create timeless things oh i love that\nthat's beautiful all right question\nnumber four uh what is something you\nused to value that you no longer value\ni used i know this sounds funny because\ni it's the sense of home like i think\ni've learned\nto not value i don't know i don't value\nthings like i just value\ni value like dance so much especially in\ncovid and i know now i'm not doing one\nsentence but i think kova just made me\nrealize how much it's not necessarily\nabout you know\nthe environment it's about having like\nthe space to do what you love i love\nthat and uh fifth and final question if\nyou could create one law that everyone\nin the world had to follow what would it\nbe\ndon't ever sit at your desk for eight\nhours\nmove move dance yeah play do
