because a bunch of\npeople are going to say well i don't get\nit right like you know like i don't get\nthat people will want to buy flavored\nwater without sugar i don't get that you\nknow there's all of these things that we\ngo into on masters of scale that say\nactually in fact sometimes when you get\na bunch of people who say i don't get it\nthat's precisely when you have something\nthat's\n[Music]\ngold hey everyone welcome back to on\npurpose the number one health podcast in\nthe world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you that come back every\nweek to listen learn and grow now you\nknow that i don't take your ears for\ngranted i'm grateful that you take out\nso much time out of your days to listen\nand learn whether you're walking your\ndog or you're at the gym or whether\nyou're driving to and from work or\nwherever you are right now thank you for\nchoosing on purpose and this is a\nconversation that i've been excited to\nhave for a very long time today i'm\nspeaking to none other than reid hoffman\nnow reid is an accomplished entrepreneur\nand that is an understatement he's an\ninvestor he has played an integral role\nin building many of today's leading\nconsumer technology businesses he's of\ncourse the co-founder of linkedin and an\ninvestor at greylock he's the host of\nhis own podcast masters of scale so\nyou're going to see a master at work\ntoday an original podcast series and the\nfirst american media program to commit\nto a 50 50 gender balance for featured\nguests he's the co-author of four\nbest-selling books the startup of you\nthe alliance blitz scaling and his\nnewest book with the same name of his\npodcast masters of scale surprising\ntruths from the world's most successful\nentrepreneurs reed welcome to on purpose\nand thank you for being here uh it's\ngreat to be here i i love your show um\ni've listened to it you know as much as\ni listen to any podcast including my own\nright which is every moment i have time\nfor and if i had a little bit more\ncommutes uh outside of the pandemic i\nthink my listening to\nall of these quality podcasts most\ncentrally yours\nthat's so kind rita i'm humbled and i'm\ntouched and the feeling is mutual i\nlove your podcast too and that's what i\nwas just thanking you offline that i'm\nso grateful that you've synthesized\nall of this incredible wisdom from all\nthe phenomenal people you've interviewed\ninto a book that we can easily look at\nread skip to chapters look at challenges\nunderstand stories and as we're talking\nabout before what i love about the book\nis that it's the stories it's the\npsychology it's the tips it's the\ninsight it's everything it's this very\n360 degree approach but reid i want to\nstart with\nyour life not as an entrepreneur\nbut as an employee\nand your first paying job was an editor\nat a gaming company and you also wanted\nto become a professor which makes me\nthink\nyou were gearing up to be an employee\neither of a school or an incredible\nfaculty or and of course you did as a\ngaming company\nwhen did the idea of entrepreneurship\nfirst spark your intriguing curiosity\nand\nhow much were you already convinced you\nwere going to be an entrepreneur or were\nyou always thinking you were going to be\nan employee so i don't think the\ncategory of employee or entrepreneur had\nactually really occurred to me i always\nthink in terms of projects i always\nthink in terms of what the work is what\nthe activity what you're building\nand i don't think it was until years\nlater i don't think it was until years\ninto linkedin that i was like oh right\nentrepreneur is the word that describes\nthe activity that i'm doing like it\nwasn't really like i'm going to be an\nentrepreneur or something it was more\nlike what do you build what you fashion\nand that was you know all the way back\nto you know great research not that many\npeople know that i kind of you know\ntalked my way into the door of a gaming\ncompany when i was 12 and then ended up\ndoing some work for them uh so you know\ngood research for that uh but that was\nbecause i was interested in fantasy\nrole-playing games you know dungeons and\ndragons and so i was like this is what i\nwant to spend my time doing so i want to\nget in that door and i want to connect\nwith the people who are doing this and\nthen you know kind of similarly and then\ni think i became an entrepreneur because\nwhen i started thinking about\nthe the the compa the the the the impact\nthat i wanted to have in the world the\nway that i wanted the the insights that\ni thought i had that could be\noperationalized it was coming about from\nthe very earliest days of the internet\nand with the various earliest days of\nthe internet was\nhow do we live in this medium by which\nall of us as individuals and as groups\nwere made better off and what kind of\nproducts can you create there and when i\nlooked at kind of like what were the\nthings i could possibly join\nnone of them had that kind of shape of\nwhat i wanted to create and so that made\nme an entrepreneur and i wasn't\nreluctant but i was completely focused\non this is the future that i want to\nbuild and so you know that naturally\nmore that more naturally aligns with\nentrepreneurship what i love about that\nread is that\nnot having these\nbuckets almost of thought of saying i\nhave to choose actually helped you find\nthe right path and i think often we put\nthese very binary black and white\nchoices in front of people and we say\nwell do you want to work for someone or\ndo you want to be an entrepreneur and in\none sense they're both the wrong\nquestions it seems like the right\nquestion is as you said is to be project\nfocused is to thinking about what you\nactually want to do or what you want to\nbuild and which home allows you to build\nthat more successfully which i think is\na is a brilliant insight so i really\nappreciate that\ni wanted to understand that when you\nstarted your first company social net\ncould you share with us\nthe mistakes that you\nmade\nand which mistakes you don't want our\naudience to avoid i think often the\nquestion is well read like what mistakes\nshould i avoid when i start a company i\nwant to ask you the opposite question\nwhat mistakes were just so integral that\nyou had to make when you started your\nfirst company that you would want other\npeople to have\nit is a absolutely great question and\nand one of the kind of i think uh one\nthing you learn about business and\nentrepreneurship is aphorisms and i\nthink one of the aphorisms that's\napropos here is i never learned so much\nexcept for maybe between the ages of two\nand three\nwhen i jumped off the cliff from my\nfirst company and people obviously and i\nby the way i normally\nadvertise here's the landmine you avoid\nyou know here's the sort but that but\nyour question is also a really great one\ni would tend to say the mistakes that i\nmade that i think are still that are\nintegral to being successful in\nentrepreneurship\none is jumping off the cliff a bias to\naction if you think about it in a\nclear-headed way there's all kinds of\nthings you don't know before you start a\ncompany um i didn't really know i could\nnever start a company before didn't know\nabout financing didn't know about how\nwhat your initial hires would be\ndidn't know how to scope a project for\ntheir first product release um didn't\nknow\nuh which things were kind of the classic\nmistakes now that i think i could have\ndone a little more research on and\nprobably would have been like my advice\nto my younger self would be call a few\npeople you know and and kind of avoid\nthe obvious mistakes so you make the\nunobvious mistakes but i think the\npredisposition to\nkind of jumping off the cliff and going\nwas i think one of the things that was a\ncentral\nyou know you say it's like embodies a\nwhole bunch of mistakes but you have to\nmake those mistakes and you have to\nknow that you're making them it's almost\nlike boy i know i'm going to get into a\nbunch of fender scrapes and i'm going to\nbounce off the side of the highway and\nthat kind of thing but that's the only\npath forward so here we go and hit the\naccelerator\nyes i love that answer i think that's\nthat's such a great one\nbecause i think you're so right that if\nyou actually think\ncoherently and in an organized way you\nwouldn't do what 99 of entrepreneurs\nhave had to do\nand that becomes your biggest block\nbecause chances are your first swing is\nnot going to be successful anyway\nbut\nknowing that and still going away and\nstill trying to do that allows you to\nget over that hurdle of being very\nsensible and and thinking more\nresponsibly so i i think that's a\nbrilliant answer i wanted to ask you\nbecause i think lots of\nentrepreneurs or people who want to be\nentrepreneurs and we're going to go\nthrough the book through chapters that i\nfound really powerful but i wanted to\nstart off by saying you called your\npodcast and the book masters of scale\nand as soon as i heard that title when i\nfirst started listening to the podcast i\nloved it because i always wanted\nto be able to spread wisdom at scale\nbut with intimacy and depth and that was\nalways my fascination of how could you\nspread something that was for everyone\nbut speak to one person and and really\nfeel like you're connected to one person\nwhat is the difference between scaling\nand growing a business\nand and how you define what a master of\nscale is\ni think there's a it's a little bit like\nother important words in concepts in our\nhuman space like friendship and so forth\nit's a little deliberately amorphous on\nkind of\nwhere that kind of scale and mastery\ngoes because we want it to be everything\nfrom you know one of the classic things\nthat would want to think about is\nbuilding businesses like linkedin or\nairbnb or you know or uber or google or\nany of these things that you're that\nthat the building these things of\nindustry redefining society\nuh redefining uh hopefully massively\nimproving kinds of things is kind of the\nscale that you're targeting for and\nmastery is the mastery of running the\nthe kind of the the slalom course uh\nwith minefield and fog and all the rest\nwhich is this is the thing that matters\nis getting the scale and that's that's\nwhat we essentially target it's not just\nthe entrepreneurs but executives and\nemployees and people who care about what\nthese companies or organizations are\ndoing but we also hope that the tools\nwill apply\nin a wide variety of other things so you\ncould say well i think the only way of\nsolving climate change is scale\ntechnology but also the only way of\nof improving human society is scale\nwisdom so how would you take these tools\nand make them available\nacross the entire set to think about\nyou know how do we remake\nourselves and our societies you know at\nthe\nglobal or at the you know trans national\nscale\nyes absolutely and and i love that\ndifferentiation because\njust like the word entrepreneur i\nremember i was speaking to\na really good friend of mine who founded\nclass past pyo kadakia\nand i believe she's been on your show\nactually and yes and and i remember\nspeaking to her about that she was you\nknow she's also a very big fan of the\nshow too\nand she was talking about her definition\nof an entrepreneur is someone who tries\nto solve a problem right not someone who\nstarts a business and and she was saying\nyou know you could be selling x or y or\nz on on the internet and call it a\nbusiness and call yourself an\nentrepreneur but she was saying that\nentrepreneurs are really trying to solve\na problem they're addicted and obsessed\nwith that and i think just like that as\nyou're defining the difference between\ngrowth and scale that differentiation is\nimportant for us\nas we start to build our journey or\ncareers\nnow in chapter one you talking about\ngetting oh sorry yes no let me just add\none thing to piles excellent definition\nand her episode was great i recommend it\nto everyone uh she was one of the people\ni have delight to meet through doing a\npodcast is that one of the awesome\nthings about us doing these podcasts is\na chance to meet other really\ninteresting people an entrepreneur is a\nperson who's solving a problem but in\nparticular\nshe or he is solving a problem where she\ndoesn't yet have either all the\nresources or the knowledge or all of the\nthe tool set in order to do it so you\nhave to actually in fact you like if you\nwere to say do i have everything laid\nout in front of me in order to solve\nthat problem unlike for example i could\nsay for a piece of word working like i'm\ngonna make you know a bed frame do i\nhave everything out in front of me the\nanswer is as an entrepreneur you don't\nand you may not even yet know how and\nthat's one of the key things about the\nentrepreneurial journey i love that\naddition as well yes building your bed\nframe from an ikea box is is not does\nnot count it's all laid out for you uh i\ni absolutely love that uh chapter one in\nthe book and i always like to give\npeople a little bit of a taste when\nwe're talking about a book because my\ngenuine hope for everyone who's\nlistening and watching wherever you are\nis that you go and grab a copy of this\nbook uh it's gonna be my new book that i\nrecommend to each and every single\nperson who comes to me and says do you\nhave an idea or i don't know what to do\nwith it i don't know where to start how\ndo i go about it this is the book that\ni'm going to give them or even if you\nsay yeah i don't have an idea i just i'm\na bit curious about all of this all my\nfriends are becoming entrepreneurs i see\nit all over the world what how do i do\nthat this is the book i'm going to be\ngiving to people uh so i love to give\npeople a taste now in chapter one you\ntalk about getting to know and accepting\nrejection and hearing no's\ncan be really draining and really\ndifficult especially when we've been\ntrained to expect and want a yes\nnow you mentioned in the book the\ncontrarian principle\nand this is also one of the principles\nyou mentioned in your other book blitz\nscaling so i wanted you to actually\ndescribe that principle to us and talk\nabout how do we get used to\nhearing no and what is that no really\nasking us to do\nso the contrarian principle is in order\nto achieve something bold different of\nscale\nfrequently if it's an idea that lots and\nlots of people had it's much harder to\nget there whether as an entrepreneur or\nan investor\nand so you generally want to choose an\nidea choose a path choose a product a\nservice whatever which is contrarian but\nright it's very easy of course to be\ncontrarian and wrong because there are\nmany you know there's there's many\nfoolish things to do in the world and so\nyou go wonder where a lot of people\nthink that that might be wrong\nbut actually in fact you have had some\ninsight or you and your team and your\nyour colleagues your friends have had\nsome insight that you could say okay\nthis is how we're going to do it now\npart of how that gets to dealing with\nno's is say for example and by the way\ngenerally speaking it's a good idea you\ntry to\nconvert crises in opportunities it's a\nprecise kind of mindset\nstrengthening exercises and balance and\npoise that you go across you know a set\nof podcasts with on purpose which is\nuh you don't really say well i just want\nto get a yes and it's like well you're\nnot going to just get a yes especially\nif you have something that's bold and\noriginal different because a bunch of\npeople are going to say well i don't get\nit right like you know like i don't get\nthat people will want to buy flavored\nwater without sugar i don't get that you\nknow there's all of these things that we\ngo into on masters of scale that say\nactually in fact sometimes when you get\na bunch of people who say i don't get it\nthat's precisely when you have something\nthat's gold\nnow\nso the question is well how do you deal\nwith the psychology of it the answer is\nwell approach nose not as a\nrejection of you rejection of your idea\nrejection it is obviously a form of\nrejection\nbut where you might be able to learn\nsomething from it where you might be\nable to understand something about the\nway the world's working so if actually\nin fact\num it's a certain kind of note where\npeople say oh no everyone knows that you\nthat that selling flavored water without\nsugar because everyone wants sugared\nwater\nwon't work and you're like aha maybe i\nhave something well everybody knows that\nno stranger is going to rent a room or\napartment to another stranger aha i may\nhave something\nand so you you can bring those nose in\nand\nand then part of the categorization that\nwe do within that first chapter because\nthat's part of the reason why you open\nthe book with this\nis to give you a sense of well which\nwhich way should you responding to\ndifferent kinds of no's because\nsometimes it's a no and a thoughtful one\nfrom an expert that you should dig into\nsome understand some of why they think\nthat sometimes it's a no\nthat's\ni it's a like a\nstereotype and just a reflection and so\nthen you understand that it's a\nstereotype sometimes it's because the\nperson's not engaging in which case you\nshould work you should waste no more\ntime with this person and so the that\nthat's the kind of thing of treating it\nas a learning journey which of course is\nfundamental to life and of course to\nentrepreneurship is the way to reorient\nthe mindset in order to\num\nto to to say it's not rejection\nit's part of the hero's journey you're\non yes yeah i'm glad you referenced the\nheroes journey there as well and uh for\nthose of you that have not read it\njoseph campbell and\nand other writers have spoken\nbeautifully about\nthe hero's journey and\nand rejection is just such\na beautiful part of it when you look\nback\nand when you like you said it's\npsychological we think it's\nspecific to the idea or the business\nactually it's all psychological in\nhearing no and being rejected and still\nfinding a way to continue and i really\nreally resonate with that insight that\nyou just shared around how\none of our biggest challenges is that we\nare trying to get this unanimous yes and\nunanimous consent and you say that in\nthe book you're just like i you're\nactually dubious when there's unanimous\nconsent because you're thinking to\nyourself well\nthere must be this can't be good then if\neveryone agrees with it then then this\ncan't be the right idea and i found that\nso refreshing\nuh because i think we've been trained to\nthink the other way that if everyone\nagrees you're probably on to something\nespecially people in power\nbut if if people in power disagree with\nyou you're actually saying well there\ncould be something to learn but there\ncould be an opportunity here as well uh\none of the things that i wanted to ask\nyou about this was is there something\nhave you been able to in your life\nas an investor\napply that or have you sometimes felt\nthat no this is definitely not going to\nwork and then something became really\nsuccessful or has there ever been a time\nwhen you thought\ni've thought about this there's stuff to\nthink about or have you stopped saying\nno have you started saying maybe\nif\nwhen or do you still say no\noh i definitely still say no\nbecause the average you know kind of a\ngeneral partner adventure firm looks at\n600 to 800 deals a year and says yes to\nzero to two of them um and now you're\ngenerally speaking almost never will you\nrarely say no in a way that's kind of\nlike no never talk to me again that's if\nsomeone's kind of\njust really not the right fit\nright and just like look don't waste\nyour time don't waste my time this is\ngood frequently you'll say\nnot right now when you try to partner\nwith people and be good for\nentrepreneurs the the not right now may\nvery well be here's some of the\nchallenges that i have right now and and\ni i hope and anticipate you're going to\nbe really successful and maybe a future\npath is a time that we will talk about\nnow um there's a there's kind of this\npsychological categorization of false\npositives false negatives otherwise\nknown as type one and type two errors\nvery rarely when you're doing things\nmoving at speed like investing if you're\nnot making both type one and type two\nerrors both false positives and false\nnegatives you're not doing the game the\nright way right you're you're being too\nconservative one way or the other so so\nif you're too too many positives then\nyou're not making you know you're then\nyou're making a set of mistakes and too\nmany negatives you're making a mistake\nand so um\nand so for me when i kind of look at\nthis as\nis this kind of like i think\nentrepreneurship and investing has this\nkind of\nyin and yang\nbringing together that yes in the know\nthat hey i could see this vision but i\nsee the risks but i put it together and\ni make a decision and i think that's\npart of what we find it to be\nyou know kind of super interesting and i\nthink that's the\nuh that's the way i try to balance it\nwhich means that uh frequently i will\nsay no although my most often know is\ntrying to be helpful like like being\nlike you could almost look at the in the\nover the side of the chapter was yes i\nknow that i'm saying no but i'm trying\nto be as helpful as i possibly can to\nthis person who's on this ridiculously\nhard journey and this is their their at\nthe moment their life's treasured work\nin so doing and so anyway that\na long kind of tendrilled answer to your\nquestion but i think worth it no no no\ngreat answer i'm really glad that\nyou got in the weeds there rita i\nappreciate it uh on the flip side reed\nwhat is\nwhat's been one of the most surprising\nyeses that you've given or you've seen\nin investing of a company that we may or\nmay not recognize but\nwhat has been the most surprising yes\nyou've ever seen heard of given yourself\nthat maybe again if you looked at it\ncoherently you would have been like\nit was actually more intuitive it was\nmore a feeling it was more an experience\nit was more just a gut was has that ever\nhappened do you see that well definitely\nbecause both as entrepreneurs and as\ninvestors when you're at the earliest\nstages the c the series a\nit's a vision where you don't know how\nto get from here to there right you\nyou've got a theory of the game but you\ndon't actually know how to get there and\nso um and so frequently every yes\ninvolves a leap of faith involves a\nlook i think this entrepreneur you know\nshe or he this team this idea this time\nthis technology yeah i think they could\nget there and so every this every yes\nhas a little bit of that characteristic\nat these very early stage kind of\njudgments\nperhaps the funniest one was airbnb\nwhich is my very very first uh\ninvestment that i brought to greylock\nand i was at greylock because david z\nwho was my partner greylock was my\nmost valuable board member at linkedin\nyou know kind of like converts convinced\nme to come join greyhock and i was like\noh great and i have the great culture of\npartnering with entrepreneurs and and\nfeeling like you're the invited partner\nversus you know the you know big man on\ncampus as kind of a way of collaborating\nwith entrepreneurs and so i bring in\nairbnb and i'm like oh i think this is\nreally interesting and and david looks\nat me across the partnership table and\nsays well every every venture capitalist\nhas to have a deal that they fail on\nthat they learn from and airbnb can be\nyours\nand so\nhere is this a storied amazing venture\ninvestor going oh this is a complete uh\nidiotic idea but go ahead right\nand so and i thought about it now it\nwasn't so much the intuitive part of the\nquestion but i thought about it i\nthought really hard and i went you know\ni still think it's worth doing so he's\ngiven me permission to do it so i'm\ngonna go do it right and by the way to\ndavid's credit cause he's a learner as\nwell six months later no change in the\ndata and everyone else he came to me and\nsaid you were totally right to make this\ninvestment what did you see that i\ndidn't see\nand i said well you were right cities\ncould react it's a strange experience\nyou know hotel lobbies are going to\nreact all of this stuff\nthe question is is if they had a good\nplan on all this stuff and the world\nthey were building toward was the world\nwe should be living in and if they could\nnavigate through those landmines it\nwould be amazing uh and so he was like\noh okay got it right and then you know\noff to a more contrarian but seeking to\nbe right investments yes i love that and\ni love that question that he asked you\nknow what did you see that i didn't see\ni mean\nthat that is such a cumulative\nwisdom opportunity if you're if you're\nalways asking that question when you get\nsomething wrong or make a mistake or\nsomeone gets something right i mean the\nway that that can accelerate your\nlearning and knowledge is is absolutely\nhuge uh absolutely beautiful i love that\nchapter two is called do things that\ndon't scare do things that don't scale\nwhich again you're just playing with us\nreid you're completely playing with us\ni'm like reading a book called masters\nof scale you're now telling us things do\nthings that don't scale\nwhat do you think most startups do wrong\nin the early stages of their business uh\nwhat are the biggest mistakes that\nquestion\nwe were going to be talking for the next\nthree weeks\nbecause there are many many ways to fail\nit's one of the reasons why on master\nscale we try to go here's an interesting\npattern for to possibly navigating the\nminefield here's an interesting pattern\nhere's a good sensor you know you know\nkind of concepts for doing this part of\nthe reason why we put this in is because\nthe natural thing that everyone goes\nokay i got it scale's religion i'm only\ngoing to do things at scale\nand you actually in fact say well\nactually every successful\nentrepreneurial venture all of these\nthings that have gotten a scale\nhave done a set of things along the path\nthat were essential to succeeding that\nwere not themselves scale activities and\nand so people might buy into the\nreligion\ntoo\nblindly and you actually say look i know\nthat i only succeed when i really get to\nthe scale whether it's the business or\nclimate change or wisdom\nbut if i don't do some things that are\nkind of experimenting with product\nmarket fit\nuh taking some experiment and innovation\nwhether it's an organization or go to\nmarket you know the organization on how\nyou run or go to market if i'm not doing\nsome of that i may miss that critical\npath that unlocks the journey to\nmagic at scale the journey to\nhow this this really works in\ntransforming the world and society we're\nliving in and so there's a whole set of\ndifferent kinds of techniques where you\ngo well that won't scale so we're never\ngoing to do it's like well look if you\nthink it's really important experiment\nwith it\nsee what's doable and then you go wow\nit's really important okay so what\nversion of this might i be able to scale\nand that's that's that's essentially the\nthrough line through the chapter which\nof course opens with you know brian\nchesky and airbnb again yes absolutely\nyeah no i i think that that\nagain is a really significant\nnote because it's it's so easy to just\nget lost in\nthe numbers and i really feel that\nit's it's even with the work i do i\nfound that\nultimately can you help one person\nhave an incredible experience\nand and when you can do that for one\nperson you get trusted to do it with ten\nand then a hundred thousand and then a\nhundred thousand and a million in a\nbillion whatever it may be it's the idea\nof like i really feel like being able to\ngive\none person a unique experience and under\nyou just learn so much about that uh and\nyou learn so i know that any any\nfounders that i know they say you know\nthey spend all their time looking at\ncustomer service in the beginning to try\nand figure out like what part of the\njourney were people not truly feeling\nwas working or was flowing for them\nthere's such a attention to detail there\nwhich is often ignored when it's like oh\nwe've got this many stales already uh do\nyou know could you give any examples and\nagain you don't need to name names read\nof any companies that actually started\noff right\nbut maybe didn't apply some of this\nwisdom and you saw them fall off and\nagain i'm not trying to point fingers or\nname names i'm trying to understand more\nthat have you seen that where it looks\nlike everything's going great but then\nthere's something that isn't external\nbut internal that breaks down well\nthere's a number and to some degree any\nof the ones that were\nsuper hot once upon a time and then went\naway uh web van or\nyou know kind of all advantage or uh an\nearly search engines excite or kind of\nexcited home there's there's all of\nthese things that said look something\nbroke along that path to scale there's\nalso ones that then like also failed to\nget to scale there are those patterns as\nwell and so it's a whole set of things\nwhere\nyou know part of the the journey of\nscaling is the problem changes like we\nopened with a discussion of\nentrepreneurships or entrepreneurs or\nproblem solvers\ntoo often one of the things that happens\nin your problem solves oh i solved this\nversion of the problem and so i've got\nthe tool that's the hammer i'm going to\nkeep doing it and the scale journeys\ninvolve you know and that's why we have\nanother chapter learn to unlearn\nis changing the tool set up and the path\nthat got you here is not necessarily the\npath that will get you there and so\nsometimes you have to say well that\nreally that really helped us launch our\nproduct but the scale model is actually\nin fact doing deep embedded into seo and\ngoogle or the scale model is moving to\ntelesales and an enterprise uh model to\nto bring to my product um i mean for\nexample like one of the things that\nwas not anticipated at linkedin is we\nthought for the first x years it would\nall be individuals only and we thought\nindividuals would expense their their\nrecruiting or their sales or their\nproblem solving to the company but we\nfound that the company started knocking\nat our door almost before we launched\nour subscription product going well we\nwant an enterprise product it was like\noh and by the way this is kind of\nclassic entrepreneurship as well okay so\nwe listened we said well that's\ndifferent than our plan how do we\nmeasure this how do we have a bias to\nspeed uh action and learning and we said\nokay well let's create a powerpoint deck\nthat um describes a product by the way\nat this moment is totally fictional like\nwe literally sat around for a weekend\nand said the product could look like\nthis so let's mock it up create a\npowerpoint deck and then go out and say\nwell this is the product we're working\non what do you think about it would you\nbuy it\nright and the first sales people were\nvery entrepreneurial they're not the\nsame as the scale success sales people\nthat linkedin has now but those where\nthey came back and they said well we got\nsome weird feedback on this one we\nshould change that but this is the\nproduct we think that a bunch of people\nwill initially buy and so then we went\nand built it\nwow and that's kind of classic for these\nkind of entrepreneurial journeys yeah i\nlove that i love that it's always i find\nthat in all successful entrepreneurial\njourneys you see this pivot you see this\nmoment where you're now creating\nsomething that wasn't the plan it wasn't\nthe business model it wasn't the\nway you thought you were going to get to\nsuccess or scale or or speed\nrarely comes from something internally\nas well right it comes from how the\ncustomer is using it playing with it\nwho's who's asking the right questions\nuh in chapter three reed you talk about\nthe big idea what is the big idea\nand\ni feel like and i'm asking this question\nyou probably i mean you probably get\nthis question all the time i think it's\nimportant to ask it because i do think\nthis is the majority of\npeople that that i connect to that i\nmeet that i hear when i'm when i'm\nrecording the podcast\nis\ni think i have\nan idea\nbut i'm too scared to take action on it\nor take it seriously because the whole\njourney seems overwhelming do i have to\nfundraise or not do i have the skills or\nnot are there too many competitors that\nare doing the same thing is my idea even\noriginal uh i saw 10 companies like this\nfail last year these are the things that\ngo through our head and then the most\nbasic one what will my friends say when\nthis doesn't work out right like the mo\nwhat would my parents think of me that i\nleft my college education to do this or\ni quit law to do this\nthese are the kind of things we're\nhearing all the time\nwhat do you say to people when they say\nthat to you or when you see that when\nyou hear that\nand i get that that's a big broad\nquestion but how do you try and help\npeople narrow it down it's a very\ncomplicated question because it comes\ndown down to the individual and the\nindividual's\ngoals\npurposes you know strategy\nrisk tolerance what kind of activity\nthey want and so you have to you have to\nalways condition it based on it\nnow a few general principles which again\napply very differently depending on you\nknow kind of kind of who you are\nis and what circumstances you're in how\nmuch risk can you take entrepreneurship\nalways involves risk even if you think\nyou've de-risked the idea a lot\nthere's always a lot of unknown unknowns\nand part of entrepreneurship you have to\ndeal with the unknown unknowns in order\nto\nin order to do this\ni think there's a question around\nyou you don't do an entrepreneurial idea\nunless you can think of yourself doing\nit for the next 10 years\nbecause part of success is like would\nthis be worth at least 10 years of my\nlife in so doing and if not then great\nnot the thing that you need to do\nright and then when you go and talk to\nyour friends about it and try to get\nsome wisdom of the crowds around how\ndoes the thing work\nyou don't ask them do you like the idea\nyou don't ask them\ndo you think it can work because they\nwill think that what you want is\nreassurance\nwhich you want to say\nwhat won't work about this idea what\nwhat what could cause the idea to fail\nbecause if\nyou get that feedback and then you begin\nto aggregate this this also gets back to\nthe learning from knows that we were\ntalking about you aggregate that\nfeedback then you have a better chance\nat taking smart risks including\nchoosing whether or not to do it now one\nlast little kind of kind of pro\nentrepreneurial tip for people who are\ndaunted\nwhich is\nanother thing that good entrepreneurs do\nis they kind of figure out how to\nexperiment\nso you say well i've got this idea it's\nan idea for a new app maybe it's an idea\nfor a mindfulness or wisdom app or\nsomething and say well all right\num but i'm really nervous about doing\nthis what could i do well i could go uh\nbuy some\nyou know kind of uh i could go put up a\nweb page describe what it is say click\non click on here if you're interested in\nthis and then buy some advertising\nagainst it and then see what the\nclick-throughs looks like and if the\nclick-throughs look totally fantastic\nthen i was like well maybe shoot that's\ndata maybe i should go do this and that\nbecause i've described all of those and\nif the click-throughs look bad then you\ncan say well maybe i didn't do the\nexperiment the right way or maybe\nmaybe i shouldn't do this right and so\nthere's ways to experiment with things\npeople too often get stuck in their mind\nwhen\nwhen uh do\nand then reflect think do reflect think\nright and and be in that cycle on a\nrelatively quick basis is central to\nsolving these unknown unknown problems\nyeah i'm so glad you added that last\npiece i\ni feel like\nexperimenting is\nis one of the greatest assets in skill\nand\nthe best thing about experiments are\nthey can be free or very cheap\nthey can be\nvery\nquick to do you don't have to build for\na year or you know waste time in your\nlife you could literally build it this\nweekend if you felt like it and tested\nsomething and you get immediate feedback\nand response from people that are not\nconnected to your family or your friends\nor people that you feel oh well they're\nsaying it because they're connected or\nthey don't like it because i'm their\nfriend and they know me and they want me\nto stay safe and so\ni couldn't agree with you more that i\nremember when when i first was starting\nwhat i was doing\ni think experimenting even today\nhas always been my favorite way of\nrealizing whether i should do something\nor not and\ni love it because anyone who's sitting\nthere going it costs too much\nexperimenting is free or cheap please\nremember that uh it takes too long no it\ndoesn't this could literally happen this\nweekend and oh it's uh\nyou know well who's gonna use it anyway\nyou have no idea that's the fun of it\nand so i'm so happy you you really\nemphasized that point at the end there\nbecause there's no better way to see\nwhether your idea actually has legs uh\nand oh yes please read go ahead yeah let\nme add one thing to this which is\npeople always think experiment is out in\nthe world sometimes the experiments with\nyourself too how does this make you feel\ndo you feel stressed by it do you feel\nenergized by it\nthat experimentation is also good we\nhave this presumption because we're\nwe're in our own heads that we're the\nbest experts of ourselves and the answer\nof course we have a depth of experience\nand all the rest but actually in fact we\nhave blind spots to ourselves we we have\nunknown unknowns about ourselves and\nexperimenting is useful there too yes\nfor sure i think that's\ni mean that deep checking with ourselves\nis\npotentially why when we ignore that it's\nwhy we're seeking approval and\nvalidation from outside because we've\nnot really\nsince checked the idea the experience\nwith ourselves and i've often found the\nother way around that i've been so sure\nabout my decisions and pretty much\neveryone in the room is is saying no but\ni'm still going to do it because i feel\nso sure and and i've always felt that\nthat internal surety and assurance and\nconfidence has actually made me feel\nstronger than even when everyone else\nagrees and it wasn't for the same reason\nas you said earlier for me when i'm in a\nroom when everyone agrees\nit feels uncomfortable if i am not sure\nand i think often we're trying to make\nother people's assurances make up for\nour lack of assurance but that actually\nnever works and it never feels right\nwhereas it's the other way around your\nassurance can make up for everyone's\nlack of assurance and push the idea\nthrough i see you nodding and laughing\nso i feel like okay i'm understanding\ni'm getting this right\nchapter four read was the one that i am\nmost in love with and it's because it's\nwhere i am at in my journey\nuh in terms of culture for my company\nculture for my teams you know we're\nwe've been fast growing for the last few\nyears\nacross my different ventures in\ndifferent organizations we have probably\naround 50 people now\nuh it's\nand it's not always people that i meet\nand see all the time there's people\nworking internationally there's\nthere's people across working across\ntime zones and in different areas of our\ncompany where i have chief operating\nofficers and other individuals who\nmanage them more on a day-to-day basis\nand as someone who is also\nuh quote-unquote using industry language\nnot seeing myself this way\ntalent and ceo\nit's it's an interesting position to be\nin and it's something that i realized\nthat\ni spent a lot of years trying to choose\nand figure out which one and i only just\nfeel\nthis year i've kind of figured out how i\nwant to balance the two and so when your\nchapter four is dedicated to what you\ncall the never engine ending project\nwhich is culture and i believe i'm on a\nculture 2.0 for for my work and and what\ni'm trying to create\nand you talk a lot about how your first\nemployees in the company are important\nuh and you say if your company is\ndominated by one type of person\nyour collective blind spots will add up\nto tunnel vision and which which i\nthought was fascinating but the part of\nculture that i find\nmost interesting\nis\nbeing able to sustain\ncontinually inspire\nand\ncreate a culture that\npeople also want to be a part of now\nrecruitment\nretention and reward are all part of\nthat puzzle\nlet's go through each of them let's\nstart with recruitment\nwhat has been your favorite way\nof knowing you've made a good hire\nwhat has been your favorite method\napproach tactic to hiring that is deeply\nhelped or one that you've seen through\nthe podcast that you've been blown away\nby so i think one of the really key\nthings to do well is to not make hiring\na solo journey\nfor you as founder or ceo or for any\nmanager or executive\nbut rather make both the hiring\ndecisioning at least moderately a group\njourney not just because of buying a\ngroup on all the rest but even if you're\nlike look i'm hiring a new\num you know vp of people it's a it's the\nbeginning of an organization\nbut you're like and that will report to\nthe ceo but i wouldn't just do it as\nonly the ceo so that's one part on the\nhiring but then the next part gets\nreally critical\nwhich is\nmake\nother people like make a group\nresponsible for the onboarding\nso that part of um how a person comes up\nto speed quickly on the culture begins\nto add to it is not just the discussions\nthat you have during the interviewing\nand reference checking and other kinds\nof things in the process but also during\nthe initial parts of work because if you\nhave that\nthen you have the whole or you know\na proxy of the organization reaching out\nand helping with that onboarding and\nthen that gets the detail of your\nquestion because\nhow do you know that you've made a\nmagnificent hire is when call it the\nthree people or five people that you've\nmade\njointly responsible for the onboarding\nall come back and say\noh this this new person she's great oh\nthis new person you know he's really\ninteresting and he's you know doing well\nand so because then you can say ah i've\ngot a lot of different touch points and\nby the way of course one of the things\nis if you get three of them or two of\nthem saying hey great and the other two\ngoing i don't know you go okay well\nwhat's the i don't know do i need to\nmake an adjustment that's not\nnecessarily an adjustment of the person\nshould be with the organization but you\nwant to do all of this stuff early\nright because you usually when you have\nthis magnificent partnering between new\nemployees and the organization they're\nworking it starts on a very strong foot\nit it's rare that it starts on a weak\nfoot and then converts so you want as\nmuch of that initial strength as\npossible and you need the organization\nto kind of collectively work at it and\nthen by the way ultimately make a\ndecision because like uh if you go if\nyou're 60 days in and you're like this\nis a mistake then you want to fix the\nmistake as as quickly but also as\nhumanly as possible yes yeah i i really\nappreciate that advice i think that's\nthe mistake i made first time around uh\nthe whole recruitment approach was\none person led it was very very\ndifficult to figure it out\nand you're so right that as soon as we\nswitch to a more\nuh group based system that in effect and\nit's hard in the beginning because\nsometimes there isn't that big a group\nuh in the beginning it is just you and\nand so you're kind of relying on\nyourself but i like the idea of\nincluding people even if they're not\nfull-time even if they're people that\nwork with you freelance or part-time\nthat you trust and love you may even\nhave someone involved that you value in\nyour personal life as part of the\ninterview process i i think that we\nthink of that as weird or awkward but\nit's not at all because there may be\nsomeone in your personal life who you\nbelieve really understands you\nand knows you that could help with that\nprocess so i i think that's such a such\na great way of thinking about it such a\nsimple way of solving the problem\nlet's move on to retention uh keeping\nthat culture growing that culture\npreserving it expanding it\nwhat are certain cultural principles\nevery company has their own culture and\neveryone has their own deck and everyone\nputs their own words on the wall\nwhat are some that you think are\nunderline all good company culture are\nthere some key pillars key themes that\nyou believe are just integral\nto any successful company that kind of\ngo beyond\nindustry boundaries and backgrounds well\ni think there's patterns that you want\nin every culture it doesn't assume\nthey're instantiated the same way\nso it's it's kind of the question of\nlike what does excellence look like here\nwe always search search excellence but\nwhat is excellence for us like it should\na culture should always be seeking\nexcellence but specific not we you seek\nexcellence but like our excellence is\nthis sort like we are\nthoughtful we are\nuh multi-stakeholder holder inclusive\nit's like what are the top priorities in\nterms of what you're doing\nanother one is this is how we define our\nteam play\nthis is the kind of way that we hold\neach other accountable\npart of defining a culture is like for\nexample where\nshould every employee be able to hold\nthe founder or the co accountable what\nwhat what should they hold that person\naccountable for like what's the way that\nwe are running in that and i think\nthat's part of like what the pattern of\nthat is so like are we we remove fast or\nwe are\nuh take intelligent risks or we are\nact like owners you know all of these\nthings could be very good cultural\nelements but which one particularly\ndefine us and even though there might be\na list of 20 virtues part of culture is\nlike well these are the ones we most\nfocus on these are the ones we most hold\neach other accountable to these are the\nones that like when we're cross-checking\num how we're evolving how we're playing\nthe game how we're getting the scale\nthat cross-checking is still the thing\nthat with each other that drives us\nforward and you want to set that from\nthe very earliest days it grows it can\nchange the mistake that people\nfrequently have a thing about culture is\nthey think like a culture deck they\nthink it's like you know the the ten\ncommandments you know it's like it comes\nwritten in stone and you're like no no\nculture evolves and so you want to have\nthe right organism the right set of\npeople who are adding to it who when you\nwhen you when you bring in a new person\nthey're part of that organism too also\nadding to it and also helping it you\nknow adapt and change and expand with a\nfoundation but still organic and\ndeveloping yes yes one of one of the one\nones that i think\nworked like that for me\nwas as an entrepreneur one of your\nvalues naturally is risk taking it's uh\nexpression it's it's\nfailing it's figuring it out and i\nrealized that actually for my team\none of their biggest values was the\nexact opposite and it was safety\nand i started to realize how\nimportant safety was to team members and\nto me that blows my mind because i was\njust i've never looked for safety in my\nlife anywhere\nand and it's so easy to get caught up in\nbuilding a culture that is\nonly for you but not everyone can work\nthat way and i started to recognize how\ncertain things we did even though we\ndidn't do it\nto have this impact it would be seen as\nunsafe to someone even though it was\nnever from that mindset the mindset was\nalways growth and building and doing\nmore amazing things but how not bringing\npeople on that journey made them feel\nunsafe and so that one for me was a huge\none that i had to realize that\nthis idea of being proactive and risk\ndriven and all this actually had to like\nbe completely reverse engineered\ninto a feeling of just safety and\nsupport\nwhich which was new to me and by the way\nthe nuance of course which i'm certain\nwas part of your journey is uh which\nparts of safety which were the\nfundamental it's not safety on\neverything safety and everywhere it's\nwhich were the key parts that are part\nof this organization this\nset of team play and that's part of\norganic cultural evolution yes yes no\nand and that's why yeah\ni think that that nuance is\nis so clear that we live at a time where\neveryone's just like whoa should i make\na company that's risky or that's this\nand it's so much more about embracing\npolarities than it is about choosing one\nor the other blanketly because that\ndoesn't that doesn't work either so no i\nlove that distinction and so important\nuh chapter seven that i wanted to dive\nin and i'm mixing and skipping now uh is\nyou know watch what they do not what\nthey say\nand and in terms of looking at the\ncustomer and i find that\nthis is something that some people have\nan innate ability to spot patterns and\nnotice how people are interacting and\nyou know sometimes i feel like my mind\nworks like an algorithm and i feel like\nmy mind's like just connecting dots and\nstuff\nbut at the same time what are some of\nthe most practical ways\nyou've seen companies really listen\nlearn and watch their customers or\npeople before they become customers what\nhave been some of the most masterful\nways that companies have actually made\nsystematize that well there's a whole\nset and it goes from obviously\nconsumer internet which tends to be the\nsoftware telemetry in terms of what's\ngoing on\nto even physical hardware like for\nexample watching on like one of the\nthings the earliest things that's taught\nin design school from decades ago was\nwatch the unboxing experience\nbecause while people you might say what\nmost what did you most love what did you\nmost hate\nthe person may not realize that the\nthing that caused them to start on the\nwrong foot was like for example a weird\nunboxing experience\nand so the general truth of the matter\nis is you always want to spend\na little bit of time\nkind of\nobserving\na kind of an unguided and unforced\ninteraction\nwith the product or service that you're\ntrying to do and sometimes you need a\nlot of time sometimes you need a lot of\npeople doing that but you want to get\nsome sense of it\nbecause if you don't have that sense\nand some people of course are just\ntotally natural at that intuition this\nis among the you know the brilliances of\nthe steve jobs and so forth but if you\ndon't get that sense then\nyou could make some very fundamental bad\nassumptions bad judgments and too often\nvery very few of us should totally\nprioritize you know i am genius i know\nthe product um it's always like you know\nbe learning be learning from other\npeople be learning from watching and you\nknow like example one of the things that\ni think people are under appreciate\nuh in the cut of the the steve jobs\ncannon is how much that every time he\nkind of found an interesting new product\neven one that he thought was completely\nbonkers he would invite the founder by\nfor lunch or for breakfast or for coffee\nand talk to them because a way of\nlearning uh is a way of doing that and i\nthink that\nis a similar kind of tactile\nnature of that and so i think that's the\nthat's the thing is is to\nis to try to get some observation and\nsome engagement there is i think\ncritical for every entrepreneur wow and\nand that's the side of steve jobs that's\noften not talked about or or not often\nshared and and you know it's it's really\nfascinating i for me steve jobs has been\nsuch a\num inspiration in so many ways by you\nknow studying his life and studying\ndecisions choices his spiritual\nbackground his you know there is such a\nfascinating individual and i think again\nwhen we look at entrepreneurs\nand when we study entrepreneurs it's so\nimportant to not start putting them in\nboxes uh and and then trying to choose\nwhich personality type we are because uh\npeople are so much more complex and\nmulti-layered and textured like each\ninteresting entrepreneurial journey is\nsomewhat suey generous so while there\nare archetypes that you should pay\nattention to whether it's union or\nanything else the notion of what you're\ndoing is you're creating something new\nand by the way that you don't want to\ninvent everything across the whole\nspectrum you want to focus set of new\nthings usually the product or service\nsometimes in the way you go to market\nsometimes in the way you organize\norganize but one mistake that's kind of\nentertaining that entrepreneurs make is\nthey invent new on everything and\nactually in fact it is sui generous it\nis unique and a specific\nsubset of inventions are what's key i\nlove that that's that's that's such a\ninteresting and new way of thinking\nabout it as well that i i don't think\nthat\nyou know we've all fully considered reid\nwe've got a few more moments left with\nyou i've got a ton more questions for\nyou but i'm gonna i'm gonna be\ni'm gonna narrow some of them down i i\nwanted to ask you before we dive into\nwhat we call the final five on on\npurpose which is our fast five\ni wanted to ask you\nwe were speaking earlier before we came\nlive and we were talking about purpose\nand you were talking about how masters\nof scale is like philanthropic it's\nservice based it's extension right\ntell how important at what point is\npurpose important is it important from\nthe beginning is it does it usually\nevolve later for entrepreneurs where\ndoes it fit into the puzzle of joy\nhappiness success\nand where have you seen it been most\nbeautifully uh\nincorporated frequently entrepreneurs\ncan make a mistake here\nbecause they're\nthey go look there's this market\nopportunity this technology enables this\ni see this competitive space opening up\ni see that i can now do this with this\nnew technology i can offer this product\nthat's now based on the cloud or based\non ai or based on mobile and that's all\nvery by the way very important it's\nsuper relevant to the success of the\nentrepreneurial journey\nbut these entrepreneurial journeys\nthey're team sports they're not\nindividual sports\nand it's part of a team sport and part\nof the reason why like whenever you look\nat any team organization sports teams\nyour military teams other things is that\nesprit de corps that that that we're in\nthis together and that it matters that\nwe're in this and that we we have pride\nthat we're in this pride with each other\npride with our families pride with um\nthe society and that is all part of\nhaving a purpose part of having a\nmission and so defining that like why\nwhat is the world that we are seeking to\nmake better and by the way it doesn't\nhave like obviously the people trying to\ncure cancer is super important but\nthere's lots of aspects to making\nsociety better this is how we are doing\nthat this is why\nthe the thing that we're adding in is so\nimportant and so\ni think that that's important from the\nvery earliest seedling\nof the idea within\nall of these projects but especially the\nentrepreneurial where you're trying to\nbuild these institutions that help\ntransform society at scale and so i\nthink it's it's one of the things to to\nstart with on day zero that's brilliant\ni love hearing that that's music to my\nears of course uh and the on purpose\ncommunity because i i really believe\nthat it it's always there from the birth\nof the idea and the purpose is what\nkeeps you going it keeps you persevering\nit keeps you\nthrough all those crazy late nights and\nearly mornings and lack of sleep and the\nbreakdown like the only thing that keeps\nyou going is your purpose whatever that\nmay be so i love hearing that now reed i\nwant to ask you the final five uh these\nare the fast five where you have to\nanswer the questions in one word or one\nsentence maximum so you have one\nsentence uh please feel free to play\nwith that\nreed these are your fast five are you\nready i hope so\nawesome i love it so the first question\ni have for you\nis what is the best entrepreneurship\nadvice you've ever received\nmake decisions quickly and recover when\nyou need to\nnice okay great answer what is the worst\nentrepreneurship advice you've ever\nreceived or given persevere against all\nodds\noh and the and and the answer is because\nyou need to learn right so it isn't only\nperseverance it's also adaptation yes\nabsolutely pivoting learning adapting\nregenerating completely if that's if\nthat's what it takes\nokay third question what is something\nthat you once valued that you no longer\nvalue\ncrazy hard work\nand what i mean by that was it's kind of\na youthful thing which is when you're 18\nyou're like ah you should pull an\nall-nighter you should show that you\ncould do it by pulling three\nall-nighters and now i'm definitely of\nthe working smart you have to work hard\non all these journeys but working smart\nis is the important governor on working\nhard i love that great uh question\nnumber four what's a daily habit that\nyou don't negotiate with that you always\ndo no matter what adequate sleep um\nhow many hours do you sleep minimum six\nuh with the occasional um frequently\nweekends\ngo to eight try to have one or two\nnights usually a mornings usually on the\nweekends where you don't set an alarm\nand you wake up when your your body is\nlike okay i'm ready part of this is\nbecause we go through life we make\ndecisions all the time we make multiple\ndecisions all the day and if you're\nmaking bad decisions you're going to err\nand so you have to be cognitively in the\nright place which of course is also\nmindfulness and purpose\nbut sleep is the baseline i love that\nthat's such a great one such an\nimportant habit and underestimated as a\nmonk i didn't sleep very much uh but\ntoday i i sleep is one of my biggest\nvalues too i i couldn't agree more all\nright fifth and final question reid is\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be\nlisten first then speak very very great\nadvice and would be an amazing law uh\nreid hoffman everyone the book is called\nmasters of scale same name as the\npodcast surprising truths from the\nworld's most successful entrepreneurs\nyou can go out and grab it right now\nyou will not regret it you may want to\nget it for a friend and family member\ntoo uh reid again it has been such a joy\ntalking to you and even through this\nscreen\nuh i feel your friendliness i feel your\nkindness i feel your graciousness it's\nit's truly special it's truly special\ni've had this experience\nand actually the only time the other\ntime i had it this week was actually\nwith someone in person\nbut with you i'm feeling it through the\nscreen which is really special so i want\nto thank you for being so present for\nbeing so\nconscious for our community and our\naudience today you've really served them\nbeautifully with your experience wisdom\ninsight\ni really really hope everyone goes and\ngrabs a copy i can't wait for people to\nread it and i really again hope to
