    "transcript": "it takes a lot to share with your\nparents you know especially at that age\nwhen you are kind of starting to really\nwant your own independence it's like now\ni have to lean on my parents more\num and so yeah i mean i think another\nthing and this isn't just parents but\nthis is like everyone is is being like\noh well that's normal or that's you know\neveryone feels that way and not\nvalidating someone's reality um i think\nthat's something i think to be very\ndetrimental for people\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now today's guest\nis someone that we've been in touch with\nfor a while i've been wanting to speak\nto her and i couldn't be more excited to\nwelcome to the podcast corinne fox an\nactress producer activist and ceo she\nwas the executive producer of the\nnetflix comedy series dad stop\nembarrassing me which was inspired by\nher relationship with her dad jamie foxx\nwho also starred in the series she's\nalso filming a key recurring role for\nthe second season of the hulu comedy\nseries doll face that me and my wife\nhave been watching and she's also the\nco-host and dj on the hitfox television\nshow beat shazam in august 2020 she\nlaunched her own podcast alongside her\nbest friend called am i doing this right\nwhich acts as a guidebook for young\npeople on how to kickstart their\nadulthood which i love listening to\ncorrine welcome to the podcast hello\nfirst of all i love the way you said\nadulthood oh yeah i don't know how do\nyou say it adult oh don't yeah you don't\nsay it no you guys say it the right way\na hundred percent do we do you say it\nthe right way i'm not sure i mean i\nthink so yeah we had we had we had\nmovies named so we had kidohood\nadulthood have you ever seen any of\nthese movies no i've never heard they're\nactually really good they're all about\nthe street culture in london so oh no\ni've never heard of it i forgot that\nyeah i i i'm i'm really happy when i get\nreminded that i still have my british\naccent oh wait because all my brit\nfriends\nare constantly teasing me that i've lost\nit really yeah no i mean it's gonna it\ngoes far in america we're like what\nbritish accent like i could listen to\nyou all day hearing that intro i'm like\ncan you read that to me every morning\nplease please well well for me it's the\nother way around because every time i\nhear something in an american accent it\nsounds authoritative it sounds like a\nted talk it's really yes because i grew\nup i grew up when i stepped foot in new\nyork city when i first moved to america\nfive years ago\ni was like i'm in a movie because to me\neverything looks like a set\nbecause i grew up watching american town\nno that makes sense i mean new york when\nyou go to new york it really does feel\nlike that like it really holds up and\nyou come to l.a you're like wait what\nlike it's kind of it's not as beautiful\nas there's some grimy areas where you're\nlike this doesn't have that magical new\nyorkness to it well you were just saying\nyou loved london i love you tell me\nabout your experiences in london you\nwere there for a movie you said yeah i\nfilmed my movie uh 47 meters down\nuncaged which is a shark movie but we\nfilmed in these huge tanks in london but\nlondon is my what do you mean\nexplain please yeah please so so the\nentire movie is set under water um first\nof all i lied to the director and told\nhim i knew how to swim when i didn't\nknow how to swim\nand um but yeah they built these huge\ntanks um where they had these really\nintricate sets underwater and we were\nscuba diving in the movie we get lost in\nthese caves and so we spent months under\nthe surface of the water so we'd go into\nwork at 6am it was dark\ngo underwater see no light then come up\nat like 8 p.m and i didn't see the sun\nfor basically didn't see the sun for\nmonths wow i know and i'd have like a\nlittle light in my trailer there's like\nlittle uv lights because i was like this\nis gonna like negatively affect my\nmental health so i was like i would sit\nand like roast in front of the light at\nmy lunch break wait you actually didn't\nsee the sun oh no i actually didn't for\nmonths and they did that as part of\ngetting you into character no no it's\njust because we had to shoot underwater\nso you go inside you'd go underwater\nyou'd come out it'd be dark then you'd\ngo do it the next day and so it was like\nyeah i i don't know if i'll ever shoot a\nmovie underwater again i feel like i got\nmy uh the taste of it from that that's\nthat's the last time you lied about\nbeing able to swim yeah yeah i'm going\nto be truthful it was my first role so i\nwas like i'll do anything you know\nyou're like oh yeah i could totally swim\nsuch a great swimmer and then they throw\nyou in the tank the first day and you're\ndogging paddling and they're like wait\ndid we cast the wrong girl oh wait how\nhow how quick is that learning curve\nbecause\ni mean when you're when you're swimming\nfor your life it's pretty quick it's\npretty quick um no i mean i i had to\npass the swim test the first day i\ndidn't i didn't pass it um and they were\nlike grin get it together i was just\ndating my boyfriend at the time and he's\nlike a lifeguard like a certified\nwhatever and so he was like okay these\nare the techniques to use he was sending\nme youtube videos and the next day i\nwent and i passed the swim test and\nthey're like okay you can now shoot the\nmovie i love that yeah so your\nboyfriend's like this is how you pretend\nto be able to do front stroke this is\nbackstroke no it was it was literally\ntreading water it was how to tread water\nvideo youtube videos wow i love that\nthat's amazing what what gave you the\ncourage and confidence to be able to say\nyou\ncould do something and then figure it\nout because i think that that mindset\noften works against us like people have\nimposter syndrome or i feel i can't do\nit so i can't even put my foot forward\nwhat gave you the confidence to say i\ncan do that and i'll figure it out which\nyou did um i i do suffer from imposter\nsyndrome a lot um but honestly\nand it sounds tacky but i really think\nmy dad was a big\na big push in that and the fact that\nlike my entire life he told me\ni mean this is a big statement like you\ncan do anything and you're so capable\nand like i just heard that constantly\nand so when i\ngot offered this role and i didn't know\nhow to swim i kind of heard him like\nwell you can do anything and i was like\nwell i'll figure it out on set which is\nwhat i did um but i really it was\ninstilled this confidence that like i\nwas capable at a young age and so i felt\nconfident to do it what was your first\nexperience of that when going back with\nthat father-daughter relationship like\nwhen was the first time you felt you\nwere hearing that from him and what was\nthe first few things you started doing\nbased on that um\ni feel like he said it my whole life and\nyou know like when you're a child\nthere's not that many things that you\nhave to meet in that way i think a lot\nof that came when i was dating in high\nschool and things like that and really\ninstilling in me my worth and just\nhaving like little petty high school you\nknow breakups and being devastated and\nhim just being like there is no man that\nlike can ever take away yourself worth\nand like do you know he always says do\nyou know who you are and i don't think\nhe beans in like my last name but like\nin my essence in like how powerful of a\nwoman i am and i just felt that i think\nspecifically at that age when i really\nneeded like\na male\nvoice that was like giving me that\nconfidence when like you know i had\nlittle breakups here and there yeah\nwell you are definitely a powerful\nperson yeah yeah\nyou're doing so many incredible things\nyou are producing you're an activist\nyou're uh you hurt your own podcast tell\nus about what are you doing to balance\nall of that because i find that\nespecially in you know your generation\nmy generation there's this ambition and\ndrive to do a lot of things\nbut when you turn it from idea into\nimplementation\nthings get real\nhow have you managed to be able to\ndabble in so many things but still you\nknow figure yourself out um it was tough\nand there was recently i i realized okay\nthere's a lot on my plate and there's a\nlot of different hats i wear and people\ni have to be the producer and then i\nhave to be the actor and then i have to\nbe the host and then i have to be you\nknow this that and i realized okay like\ni can't do all of this by myself so i\nactually this year got a life coach\nand i don't know if you've ever\nhad one been one i feel like you could\nbe one\nyeah\ni'm a live coach and we have our own\ncertification school yeah\nokay you're definitely\num but really just having someone sit\ndown with me and prioritize okay like\nwhat do you want to\naccomplish first and like how do we get\nthere and making deadlines and making um\ni think it's just hard when you have so\nmany passions to figure out like where\ndo i start and it's easy to start a\nbunch of little things and then not\nreally get to the end of them and so i\nreally needed that structure so i meet\nwith her every week we go over my\npriorities we figure out what days i'm\ngonna do what that's a big one is\nscheduling in like i will send this\nemail at this time i will do this\nbecause things back up you know and it's\nso easy to get behind so she's been a\ngodsend and her plus my therapist\nequals healthy karin\nsee i love that so i actually want to\ndive into that because i think today\nwe're hearing a lot about a lot of\npeople you hear say well you know\nspeaking to my therapist\nand\nyou just said that obviously you've been\nfiguring out life with your life coach\nand planning and scheduling tell me how\nyou find therapists and coaches help you\npersonally differently and and like you\njust said now that healthy korean equals\nlife coach class therapist which i love\nwhat are they bringing to you that's\ndifferent from each other because i\nthink we're living at a time where\npeople are kind of becoming whatever\ntherapy is yeah but i still feel like\ncoaching is is a unknown art yeah i i\nreally didn't even when i went looking\nfor a life coach didn't really know even\nwhat i was looking for i just knew i had\nthis need that with my therapist you\nknow we go through trauma we go through\nyou know um you know my emotional states\nand how to like overcome some things and\nthen i felt like i needed somebody to\nhelp me\nnot an assistant in a way but someone\nwho was just\nhelping me prioritize you know all these\nprojects i had so i feel like there's\nlike a\ntype a type b side too like my therapist\nis from my type b creative side that's\nmessy and\nall over the place and then my type a\nside is like my life coach who's like\nlet's schedule and play on everything\nyeah i love that i've i've always seen\nit as therapists help us make sense\nof what's going on and then coaches help\nus make things happen yes that's a great\nsimpler way to say yeah it's this idea\nof like therapists they help us unpack\nour past they help us untangle what's\ngoing on they help us\nreally move on from our past and then\ncoaches help you go well where do you\nwant to be yes let's use your present to\nget there 100 and i you know i encourage\neveryone to have both coaches and\ntherapists in their life because i i\nthink that's a brilliant what even urged\nyou to go out there like how did you\nthink about that what was going on in\nyour life where you were like i need\nhelp in my life because i think asking\nfor help\nor looking for help either from family\nor friends sometimes we could even get\nin our own way oh yeah i was speaking to\na friend the other day\nand he was telling me how someone in his\nlife just no matter how much he's trying\nto support or facilitate that person\nwon't accept help\nhow do you feel we can all open up to\naccept more help in our life and know\nthat it's okay to want help i think it's\na\nself-worth thing you know i feel like a\nlot of people don't feel worthy of help\nor don't don't want to be a burden\num and i think for me i mean when i was\ndiagnosed with an anxiety disorder at\nage 14. i was the type of person where i\nwas like i want to go to therapist i\nwant to do workbooks i want it like i\nwas just very much so like i\ndon't want to be held back by this\nand so i think i applied that later on\nin life when i was realizing okay i'm\nfeeling um confused i'm feeling lost i\ndon't know where to start i don't know\nhow to finish things like\nnow i need a different form of help and\nso i feel like i i was just someone who\nnaturally\ngravitated towards that but i do think\nit's about feeling worthy and feeling\ndeserving of help and\neliminating that feeling of being a\nburden on someone else\nabsolutely i love that that's such a\nthoughtful answer thank you for that\nbecause i think so many people right now\nare going to be listening to what you\njust said\nand i'm hoping that if you listen deeply\nto what karin just said that's going to\nurge you to\nbreak through that yeah and and on the\nother side of it i think people love\noffering help you know people want to\nfeel needed and want to feel purposeful\nand so you're you're also giving you\nknow people an opportunity to show up\nfor you yeah i think giving and getting\nare both privileges right it's like that\nidea of if you have something to give\nand you're able to give that's an honor\nyeah and and for someone else to have\nsomeone to give that's ready to receive\nthat's an honor too and i think you\nforget that so i love that i you spoke\nearlier about your father and the advice\nhe gave you and how that's kept you\ngoing but then you also have a show\ncalled dad stop embarrassing me so so\ndad's on one end it's like oh dad gave\nme this really good advice yeah and i\nwas like dad stop embarrassing me how\nmany times have you felt both those\nemotions in the same day every day every\nsingle day no i mean my dad and i have\nsuch a funny like yin-yang relationship\nwhere he is this like over-the-top\nperformative guy who's drawing attention\nto himself all the time and i was you\nknow more reserved and quiet growing up\nand so that was just this perfect storm\nfor him to embarrass me and because he's\ndrawing attention to himself all the\ntime when you're a teenage girl that's\nthe last thing you ever want your dad to\ndo regardless of if he's famous or not\nyou don't you want your dad to fly under\nthe radar and so we had all these funny\nmoments of like him doing too much or\nshowing up at\nlike my cheerleading game wearing like\nsuper tight clothes and me being like ah\nthat's so embarrassing and so we just\nwrote episodes and pitched it to netflix\nand they loved it and so it was such a\ncathartic thing for the both of us\nbecause at the time i was really\nembarrassed you know it wasn't a joke at\nthe time when you're 16 17 it feels like\nthe end of the world um so it was like\nfull circle for us to look back and like\nlaugh at these things that maybe at the\ntime weren't as funny yeah i love that\nthe thing i love most about is i'm not a\ndad yet but i can imagine that if i when\ni become a dad and if i'm lucky enough\nto have a have a daughter then i feel\nlike i'm gonna be i'm gonna be doing\ncrazy things right yeah like what would\nbe your advice to people that are about\nto become dads of the warnings of what\nare the things that embarrass and what\nare the things that are good\ni mean at the end of the day that's i\nthink that is part of your job\ndescription as a dad like embarrassing\nyour your child i think is part of it um\ni think it's a rite of passage for kids\nto go through so i don't really want to\nsteer away from it but i would say in my\ndad's experience my dad was very um he\nliked to play pretend he was the bad cop\nwith boyfriends yes i can imagine\nsomething and he's not at all he's like\nan emotional he's an actor i mean he\ncries all the time he's like not like\nthat at all but he loved to like put on\nthe you know i'm gonna bring my shotgun\nyou know that whole thing and um that\nwas just like dad i'm learning just let\nme give me the space to just grow and\nfigure this out you don't have to fight\nmy battles for me we have an episode in\nthe show it's episode two i think where\nhe goes like knocking on the boyfriend's\ndoor with all of his friends and he\nreally did that in real life to my high\nschool boyfriend he went knocking on his\ndoor to try to i don't know scare him\noff i don't know what he wanted to do i\nwas like\nthat's amazing\nwhat do you think it is when\nas kids i feel like when we're growing\nup we're sometimes we're embarrassed of\nthem sometimes we embarrass for them\nsometimes we embarrass for ourselves but\nthen as we grow older i feel like a lot\nof us develop a sense of gratitude\nand connection\nwas there ever a time where you felt you\nwere bitter or resentful towards your\nparents not for anything legitimate but\njust as a young\nkid growing up where you really just\ndon't how were you able to overcome that\nhow do you think that healed over time\nwhen you you kind of like oh i really\nwish they didn't do that something more\nserious not as funny yeah and then how\ndo you kind of overcome that as an adult\nyeah well um my dad just put out a book\nbut he talks about in the book we went\nto therapy together when and when i was\nin high school or maybe\nin college um because we were kind of\nbutting heads a lot and i felt like he\nreally didn't understand me and so i\nfeel like\nfor me i was really lucky because both\nmy parents listened to me and they were\nable to like at least\nlet me have my platform even if they\ndidn't understand and i think it's very\nnormal as a kid to go through that like\nmy parents don't get me and they don't\nget what i want to do and we definitely\nhad those moments where you know and\nit's funny to say this but going to\ncollege my dad went to college we didn't\ngraduate so he didn't really understand\nlike how impactful that was going to be\nfor me and that was actually a point of\ncontention for us where i was like i'm\ngoing to college and he's like why you\ndon't have to go like you can just get\ninto the industry and i was like no this\nis what i want to do and i need you to\nrespect this which sounds crazy to be\ntelling a parent that but he didn't\nreally understand and those were times\nwhere i was like you just have to listen\nto me and then when i graduated he was\nlike crying and he was like oh my god\nlike of course this is such a huge\naccomplishment and i just didn't\nunderstand like\nwhat this meant to you and i do now yeah\nwow i love that thank you for sharing\nthat yeah it's so it's so\ninteresting to just hear about\nrelationships and and ups and downs\nbecause i think everyone's kind of on\ntheir own journey and everyone who's\nlistening and watching has a different\nexperience or\nposition with their family and i think\nhearing this\ni think what i've always found that\nwhen when i hear about positive\nexperiences of parenting or anything i\nalways think for people i'm like if you\ndidn't get that\ntry and be there yeah and that's and\nthat's how you also get to experience\nthat because i think about them like\nthere may be a lot of people listening\ngoing well i didn't get that i wish i\nhad that and i'm like\nbut then we can have that opportunity to\ngo and be that and and try and have that\nexperience that way so that you still\nget to experience in your life yeah and\ni mean i think that just goes to so many\nother things too like healing your own\ntrauma so that you don't you know\ncontinue to pass it on to you know\ngeneration generations and i feel like\nour our generation is a lot more aware\nof you know our mental health and the\nthings that have happened to us and like\nhealing them now so we don't pass them\non later you know yeah well thank you\nfor including me in your generation\nyou're you're you're much younger than\nme i think so like yeah\n[Laughter]\nbut that's a great uh segue because\nmonths ago you posted on your instagram\ncorrin's guide to wellness\nyeah\nand i loved that and i loved what you\nwere sharing there i wanted to know\nwhere did you come up with that list\nfrom and how did it develop and\nand why did you feel the need to share\nit too because i think that's that was\nso powerful that you did that\num yeah i mean my mental health journey\nstarted when i was 14 when i was\ndiagnosed with anxiety and at the time\nthere was no conversation for mental\nhealth there was no hashtags there was\nno social media there was no brands\ndoing self-care sunday like that just\nwasn't a thing and so i had to spend\nmany years just doing a lot of my own\nresearch on what anxiety was and how to\ntreat it and what worked for me so over\ntime i developed this list in my phone\nwhich is what you're referring to i just\nscreenshotted it post my instagram um of\nthings that worked for me and like what\nmade me feel better and it was like\nworking out going to therapy and it's\nvery specific for me it's like one to\ntwo times a week like you know and i\ndon't recommend it and i think i wrote\nlike i don't recommend that for everyone\nbut i just started writing things oh\nworking out works oh going to therapy\nworks oh journaling works for me oh\nmeditating works for me and i would just\nkeep adding to my list so that you know\nwhen you're having you're in a really\nanxious moment or you're going through a\ntough time it's hard to remember all of\nthe tools you have you're like i don't\nremember anything so it was nice for me\nto have it in my phone so i could\nreference it you know if i needed it\nwhen you went through it at 14 what were\nthe conversations like at school or like\nwith friends or with even your parents\nlike i can imagine that i i agree with\nyou that now we're living at a time\nwhere\nyou just open up a social media app and\nthere'll be someone talking about mental\nhealth or right someone sharing\nsomething or a brand's doing something\nor there's an event for mental health\nthere's more therapists and coaches in\nthe world at that point tell me how that\ndialogue went for you in terms of\ngetting the diagnosis\nand then figuring out next steps and how\ndid people respond at school what what\ndid kids know did your friends know like\nno no i didn't i didn't feel comfortable\nenough to share it i was really really\nashamed of it and i felt like i didn't\nwant to be called the c word which is\ncrazy\nand\nbecause i didn't really know what it was\nand people weren't talking about it so i\nwent years where i didn't tell any of my\nfriends i immediately told my parents\nthough because it got to the point where\ni didn't want to go to school i was so\nanxious that i couldn't even sit in a\nclassroom so i knew in my head okay\nsomething's wrong i know other kids\ncan't be feeling this way and that's how\ni got um started going to therapy i've\nhad the same therapist since i was 14.\num i love this woman so much but um\nyeah but um but no it took me a long\ntime to be able to like and it sounds\nweird but like come out and say i have\nanxiety\nand i did that through\nan article i wrote for refinery 29 in\nlike 2017-2018\nand i was terrified i was really\nterrified to tell the world that i had\nanxiety which sounds great\nnot too seaward but it sounds you know\num\nunbelievable now because there's so much\nthere's so much of a conversation for it\nyeah absolutely and what what were you\nexperiencing then like when you said you\nwere anxious to go to school what what\ndid that feel like and what did that\nmean at that time for you it was i mean\nthere was a lot of physical anxiety\nsymptoms so it was like my palms were\nsweating my you know my heart's beating\nout of my chest i i keep thinking that a\nplane is going to hit the school like i\njust these irrational fears and thoughts\nand panic attacks and things like that i\nstruggled with panic disorder for a long\ntime 75 of mental health conditions\nstart between the age of 14 and 24. so i\nwas like right on par like 14 years old\nit just you know showed up and\num i've been in therapy ever since yeah\nno but that's it's it's incredible that\nyou've been able to\nfind the advice seek the advice build it\nthen be honest about sharing it\nespecially at a time when it is hard as\na 14 year old to\nnot know what's going on then you can't\ntalk to your friends about it because\nyou don't know how they're going to\nreact what words they're going to use\nand then you've got the added challenge\nof like well now my parents know because\nthey have to know\nand and where's this going but it sounds\nlike when i look at that karen's guide\nto wellness and i look at things like\nsocializing with friends twice a week\nright\nyou all said giving back once a month\nwhich i want to dive into some of those\nbut i love what you said and it was so\nyou said it so simply but it's actually\nso profound you just said i was creating\na toolkit for myself because when you're\nfeeling anxious you forget what to do oh\nyeah when you go to your tool kit you're\nlike oh this is this is the stuff i need\nto do\nand i think that's such a great way of\nputting it for anyone and everyone it's\nlike you have to create a guide when\nyou're not experiencing anxiety so that\nwhen you're in anxiety you know what to\nlook at exactly let's dive into some of\nthose when you say socializing with\nfriends twice a week what was the type\nof socializing that helped you relieve\nanxiety versus what type of socializing\nactually created more of it right like\nbeing in college and going to a college\nparty maybe isn't the type of\nsocializing that's gonna relieve anxiety\nbut like meaningful conversations movie\nnights um going out to dinner just being\nwith like a close-knit\ngroup of friends yeah that definitely\ndoesn't refer to just like hitting the\ntown maybe that works for some people\nagain it's like for me but for for me it\nwas just having real conversations and\njust you know being in company i think\nwhen you feel anxious or depressed you\nyou tend to go inward and i realize okay\ni have to force myself to go outwards um\nyou know when i'm feeling when i'm not\nfeeling well yeah what are some of the\nmistakes you think\nyou've seen that\nparents make like so maybe there's\nparents listening to this young parents\nor parents with young kids\nuh listening to the podcast right now\nwhat are some of the things that you\nthink are\nreally hard when your child's going\nthrough it but from a child's\nperspective or a teenager's perspective\nwho's experiencing anxiety what are some\nof the things parents can do better and\nwhat are some of the mistakes you've\nseen people made especially through your\nambassador and active activist work i'm\nsure you're hearing a lot of teenagers\nsay well my parents don't understand\nthis or my parents are pushing this what\nare some of the things you can give us\nto think about um i mean i'm not a\nparent so i i don't know i think what my\nparents did really great is hearing me\nand then you know coming up like what\nare we gonna do now and making me feel\nlike um really safe in the fact that\nthey were gonna you know find me someone\nto talk to and like you know get me\nthere and things like that um but i also\nreally wanted to go to therapy and so i\ndon't know if like forcing a child who's\nnot ready um\nthat could i saw that with other friends\nof mine really backfire um and put a bad\ntaste in their mouth for therapy later\non um and so i think it's really like\njust being present listening to what\nyour child needs and if they're coming\nto you like feeling honored because it's\nit takes a lot to share with your\nparents you know especially at that age\nwhen you are kind of starting to really\nwant your own independence it's like now\ni have to lean on my parents more\num and so yeah i mean i think another\nthing and this isn't just parents but\nthis is like everyone is is being like\noh well that's normal or that's you know\neveryone feels that way and not\nvalidating someone's reality um i think\nthat's something i seem to be very\ndetrimental for people yeah wow thank\nyou and and yeah i completely agree i i\nknow you're not a parent but i always\nfeel like it's interesting for parents\nto hear it from kids yeah and it's\nalmost like we've all been children\nand and i feel like we forget that when\nwe become an adult or you become a\nparent and sort of hear it from uh and\neven what you shared about your friends\nand saying like actually\nwhat we don't want is that everyone\nlistens to this podcast and then goes to\ntheir kid and says you need to go to\ntherapy look what you know\nand then that kid's like but i don't\nwant to go to therapy and then what you\njust said that when someone feels forced\nto do that\nthat actually ruins that experience for\nthem even in the future and so i think\nthat's a that's a great insight that i\nthink could easily be missed because i\nthink a lot of people do\nhear a piece of advice and then okay\nwell that's what my kid needs to do but\nbeing present listening yeah and there's\nother like outlets for anxiety there's\nyou know music or there's you know like\nthere's other things like i i really\nlove journaling as a kid like i just\ngrew up doing i still do it now and like\nthat was so cathartic for me and almost\nas healing as therapy and so like if\nthat's not the thing and that's this is\nthe whole thing when i talk about mental\nhealth it's trial and error right like\nit doesn't work for everyone and so you\nhave to try one thing and be like oh\nokay that didn't work let me try this\nand that's how my list was created was i\ni did a million other things besides the\n10 things on there that didn't work yes\nyeah exactly me and my wife actually\nstarted a new\ni don't know maybe when this is out we\nhave maybe not we've been doing a new\nseries of doing things together that's\nmeant to relieve your anxiety oh my gosh\nthat's so great yeah and so we went last\nweek we went to this video is not out\nhere but we went to a break room i don't\nknow if you've ever been to a business\noh were you hitting where you hit things\nso\nwe were not feeling stressed or anxious\nthat day and actually being with my wife\nis like one of my favorite things like i\nlove filming with her i'm always just\nlike if i could just be with you all day\nit'd be amazing and so we're off there\nto this rage room to break stuff yeah\nand we walk into this room and it\nliterally feels like i'm in a set of the\nmovie soar\noh my gosh yeah yes i know exactly where\nyou walk in and then you see all these\nlike computers there there's bottles\nthere's everything because and then\nthere's like all these different\nbaseball bats and lead pipes and all\nthis kind of stuff you want to be in\nthere with the wrong person yeah you\ndon't want to be in there and the thing\nis you know what was really interesting\nme my wife went in there and we walked\nout feeling more anxious than we did\nwalking in because we realized that we\ndon't like breaking stuff\nduring that\nbut even if i was stressed i was like i\ndon't really want to break stuff i don't\nwe were like my wife's holding the\nbottle and you know what my wife's like\nand she's holding a bottle and she's\nlike\nyou know she doesn't want to break it\nyeah\nand then i'm like trying to break stuff\nbut and i'm using all my force but i'm\nlike this is not making me happy it's\nactually giving me anxiety and then i\nread a study afterwards that said if\nyou're anxious before it relieves it but\nif you're not anxious before it creates\nit and i was like i should have known\nthis before i picked the wrong day the\nwrong day and the best thing well the\nfunniest thing was when we came out i\nwas talking to the lady who\nuh you know was there and knew about the\nexperience and she was saying that\npeople come there when they get divorced\nor breakups and then they often put like\npictures of the person and then you know\ni was like oh that makes sense now i get\nit but again it's like different things\nwork for different people that day we\nalso did a splatter room which is where\nyou get lots of paint and you get to\npaint canvases oh that's cool and it was\nso fun like we were both just like i\nwould do this every week because it was\nso nice to make a mess\nwithout it having any repercussions\nright\nit's like a different type of\nmess than the one before totally um and\nno i will say though for one of my\nself-care tools is like whenever i had a\nbreakup i always took up boxing at that\ntime and you know like you know and it\nwas very cathartic you'd picture your\nex's face and you just punch it you know\nand so but exactly when you're in that\nspace when you need that outlet it makes\nsense but when you're just going in it's\nlike this feels not good to me yeah\nexactly going to a more beautiful one\ngiving back once a month\ni wanted to ask you about that like\nfirst of all\nwhen did you discover that that was\nsomething that really helped you and\ngive me some examples of the things\nyou've done over time especially when\nyou were younger and now today as well\nlike what are some of the things that\nyou've done that you felt were really a\nbig part of that giving back that made a\ndifference yeah i mean my\nphilanthropic work and my advocacy work\nis some of my\nfavorite work that i do and so because i\nam an ambassador for nami the national\nalliance on mental illness and because i\nwork with other organizations like i get\nto do that on a large scale very often\nnow but before it was just something i\nhad to put in my schedule when i was at\num usc\ni used to just volunteer at a local\nhomeless shelter every sunday or\nsaturday morning and i just you know\ngive the meals and and things like that\nand so i think just thinking outside of\nyourself because again when you're\nanxious or you're depressed or whatever\nyou get it just you get so consumed and\nyou get stuck in a rut in your head and\nwhen you think outside of yourself like\noh\nsomeone else's needs right now and at\nleast for 30 minutes an hour like you're\nnot worried about yourself you're not\nworried about all the things that are\nmaking you feel anxious or depressed or\nwhatever and so i found that to be very\nhealing for me and then now to be able\nto do that on a large scale and speak\nwith nami and lobby congress and all\nthat stuff it's giving back on you know\na bigger scale but it it still provides\nrelief for me yeah i love that and and\nall the studies back that up and show\nthat yeah even when we're experiencing\nanxiety and stress when we go and\nrelieve the anxiety and stress of others\nor feel like we're working on that it\nmassively impacts how we feel yeah\nthat's such a great example not to just\ndo things for myself\nbut you know it does there is a\nreciprocal thing when you're you know\ngiving back you're also we said that\nearlier also you know getting something\nfrom it as well yeah absolutely and when\nyou're in some of those rooms like when\nyou're lobbying congress or or like\nstanding up for a right or do you ever\nfeel like are you ever like\nwhat am i doing like i can't believe i'm\nhere like from having experienced\nanxiety to now like being an activist\nand that's that's an amazing journey in\nand of itself yeah when i lobbied\ncongress with uh nami and i remember we\nwere getting off the bus at dc to walk\nup the steps of um\nthe capitol\ni was like every anxious moment panic\nattack was worth it to be standing here\nbecause i felt like\nyou know those very few moments in your\nlife we feel like everything's come to\nthis moment and there were days where\nlike the struggle was real you know i\nwas really having panic attacks i really\ndidn't want to go to school i really\ndidn't want to do these things there was\na time in which i i couldn't leave my\nhouse and i was just like wow to go\nthrough all of that to overcome it all\nand then to be standing here and\nchampioning for somebody else like\nit just makes it feel like it wasn't for\nnothing you know yeah absolutely that's\nwhat i'm saying i love that journey\nbecause i think\nwhen you can see it and and wherever you\nare if anyone is listening or watching\nright now wherever you are on that\njourney\nthat journey of you from\nschool to the capital is full of tiny\nlittle steps yes oh my gosh it does not\nhappen overnight yeah it's just these\ntiny little steps these tiny shifts\nthese tiny changes and then you get this\nbig moment where you get to stand up for\nsomething you believe in which is\nbeautiful one of the\nuh other habits that you wrote down\nwhich i loved was god's spirit connect\nchurch on sunday\nand i was thinking is that something\nthat's been a part of your life since\nyou were\nyeah i was i was raised my mom was a\nvery new age uh growing up and so at the\ntime like law of attraction and all that\nstuff was like very um woo-woo and i\ndidn't really tell kids at school that\nthat's really what we were doing at home\nbut now now of course everybody in l.a\ndoes it but um which i love but um yeah\nit was like very normal for me we used\nto go to agape i don't know if you know\nyeah\nyeah and so i grew up there like going\nto their kids room and so i still watch\nit now even though it's you know virtual\num but yeah i think my meditation\npractice too is like a huge part of my\nmental health toolkit and just sitting\nand getting quiet and connecting and\nfeeling like there's something else you\nknow or there's meaning to all of this\num for me is really relieving yeah and\nthat's and has that been a habit that\nyou've continued even during the\npandemic i guess you're saying virtually\nyeah yeah yeah how has that been\nsustained during this time because i\nfeel like being present with people is\nsuch a beautiful way for that connection\nyeah it's tough when you can't be in the\nroom but i do virtual um i do virtual\nlike meditation classes\num with unplug and i do virtual i just\ndo virtual everything i love it yeah\nthat's amazing it takes a bit of i was\nactually saying that we\ni set up with two of my close friends we\nset up meditation communities together\nduring the pandemic wow\nmeet them and then their friends their\nfamily every week on zoom we meditate\ntogether i guide the meditations and\nit's just been so beautiful and\nmeaningful because we've got all these\namazing friendships that have come out\nof yeah this zoom and i didn't even know\nhalf the people on there i didn't know\nanyone on there actually beyond this\nperson and now a year and a half year\nlate a year and a half later i literally\nfeel like i've got all these new friends\nno it's so weird how like\nyou make these zoom friendships because\nwe had to like i i this is nothing like\nwhat you were just saying but i was in\nlike a french course over this last year\nand like these two girls on my french\ncourse i just flew out to boston to meet\nthem in real life because i was like i\nfeel like you're my real friends and\npeople like you've never met in person\ni'm like but you could have you know\nafter you know a year of\nzooming with somebody yeah absolutely\nand you have to get creative in that way\nyeah you have to realize that i found\nthat\nwhat was really fascinating is i found\nthat if you do something meaningful\nin the center of a group of people\nwhether it's virtual or physical you\ncreate an amazingly deep bond yeah but\nif you do something meaningless\nwhether it's physical or virtual you\nactually don't feel close to those\npeople right and so it's like the the\nreason you're coming together is\nactually so much more important than\neven coming together right\nand i saw that just transformed so much\nof my life in the last 18 months where\nrelationships came from places i didn't\nexpect them to\nbecause i didn't realize that even if\nyou did something virtually but it was\npowerful and meaningful and purposeful\nthe quality of that relationship was far\ngreater than if you just hung out on a\nzoo right and so yeah anyway\ni don't know if that's useful no it\nwasn't no\ni completely agree with you yeah when\nwhen do you feel you're we were talking\nabout this earlier and we've really\ntalked about your mental well-being and\nyour journey with that but\nyou're such a creative right whether\nit's like djing whether it's producing\nwriting\ni want to know when do you feel most\ncreative\nand what do you feel is your greatest\nsuperpower when it comes to creativity\nand when you access you're like oh i\nfelt that\nthat's tough because i feel like my\ncreativity manifests in so many\ndifferent ways um like you know i'm an\nactor and i'm a writer as well and\ni consider myself a dancer i'm not\nprofessional by any means but i grew up\ndancing that was like my first\nperformative love and so i feel like my\nmost creative honestly when i'm alone\nlike i really\nget into this\nand maybe it's that like tortured artist\nthing that you kind of have to do um but\nreally when i'm alone and i sit and i\nget quiet and in my meditations that's\nwhere my podcast came from i was sitting\nin meditation and i like opened my eyes\ni'm like i have to do a podcast and what\ni mean like you kind of just hear things\nand so i think for me and i'm so lucky\nthat my partner my boyfriend he\nunderstands that like for me to be\ncreative like i have to really sink in\nand before i have auditions or before i\ngo you know on set like i have to kind\nof have the day before to really just i\nthink it's just really getting connected\nwith yourself yeah you know i think\nthat's why i need that quiet alone space\nand so um i think eliminating\ndistractions for me is is a big thing\nyeah i i completely agree with you i'm\nthe same like before something\nbig whatever that may be for me it's the\nsame i need to be alone it needs to be\nquiet i need to be in my own thoughts\nyeah\ndistraction so i relate to that fully\nand i find that it's important what you\njust said there is a really big lesson\nlike with the people that you love\naround you it's important you explain\nthat to them\nbecause otherwise they just start to\nthink like they're doing something wrong\nor like they don't understand you or\nthey've made a mistake and it's so\nimportant like well you just explained\nthat you know my boyfriend understands\nthat when this is happening that this\nwhat i need yeah i think that's such a\nhealthy way of communicating yeah i'm\nvery lucky that my boyfriend is also a\nwriter and director it also needs like\nhis own\ntime so it's like we we're a great match\nbut yeah now explaining to him like hey\nit's not you but like like if i have an\naudition like the night before like you\nknow i need my time i have to get into\nthe character and like i'll call you\nright when i'm out you know yeah and i\nlove that the name of the podcast is\nexactly the sentence you would say\nduring meditation\nam i doing this right i mean it's a\nquestion we ask for a lot of things but\nbecause you said you got the idea while\nyou were meditating yeah i was just like\nyes there are many times in meditation\nwhere the thought in my head is am i\ndoing this oh yeah and i always tell\npeople when they are afraid to start\nmeditation i'm like there is no right\nway to do it it's not i used to think\nmeditation was levitating in your living\nroom and like you know rising from the\nground and i was like no if you could\njust get quiet for like two minutes one\nminute like and then now i'm like i sit\nfor 30 minutes every day but um yeah i\nknow a lot of people think yeah how am i\ndoing this right is how supposed to feel\nlike am i supposed to have like some\nprofound\nthat my epiphany is not my normal\nmeditations\ntell me about that meditation practice\nyou said you went from like one to two\nminutes to now 30 minutes a day like\nwhat does that look like what do you\nwhat are you doing for that 30 minutes\nuh what time of day it is and and how\nare you practicing that um i wake up\nfirst thing in the morning let my dog\nout and then i that's when i meditate we\nget back inside and i mean it started\nwith just sitting for 10 minutes and\njust learning how to follow my breath\nwhich is great for anybody who's\nexperiencing anxiety because when you\ncan\nyou know when you can lower your breath\nyou lower your heart rate and a lot of\nyour anxiety symptoms go away so that\nwas like almost like being very\npractical anxiety relief that helped me\nbut then i started to really love the\nspiritual side of it and then it grew\nand now i'm doing\ni have crystals and there's sage and\nit's a whole it's a whole thing so it's\na production yeah it takes a long time\nmy dog's sitting there like really where\nyou have to do all of this every time\ni love that that's so important though\nbecause that creates so much like\na foundation in your day and a certainty\nand like it creates an environment that\nyou love walking into and yeah and it's\njust like the best way for me to get in\nthe right headspace to do things like\nthis to you know go out in the world and\ni'm an introvert so i have to like\ncharge up before i go out you know i can\nrelate to that let's talk about that\nbecause i reckon everyone who's\nlistening to this going you guys are not\nintroverts you're not an introvert i am\nno way yeah definitely like i have to\nlike\nself-preserve yeah so much to\nhave energy and if i go to an event if\nit's my event it's different but if it's\nif i'm going to an event i would just\ntry and find one person to have a deep\nmeaningful conversation\nyeah i wouldn't introduce myself to\neveryone because not because i'm anxious\nor scared by it but i just really like\ndeep connection yeah more than i love um\nyou know wide connection yes and that\nidea of just\njust being able to have like lots of\nsmall talk throughout the night just\ndoesn't fulfill me in the same way and i\nalso i feel like i spent a lot of my\nlife being an extrovert\nduring my teens but then i feel like i\nbecame more and more of an introvert\nbecause i realized the value\nof being alone especially when it came\nto making big decisions especially when\nit came to like sticking to my guns on\nan idea i had and no one agreed with me\nand as i started to realize that the\nmore time i spent with people the more\ntheir voice became louder\nand i was like no no but i want to\nfollow my heart like so i feel like with\nall of that\nlike my favorite thing to do without a\ndoubt on a weekend is sit with a bunch\nof books make notes read yes listen\nlearn like i could i do that if my\nwife's traveling or not with me i would\nliterally just do that and i'll order in\noh that's my favorite that's my my\nfavorite thing to do you too no oh yeah\nyeah same exactly like i i mean it's i\nfeel like i'm an extroverted introvert\nwhere i can go out it's all coming out\nnow it's all coming out now yeah it can\nbe on but then i have to go home and i\ncan't see people for like three days and\ni have to like completely go inward and\nso yeah it's just about charging and\nthen like you know going out and right\nfeeling purposeful when you are out like\nand having meaning when you're out and\nnot just i do i too get drained which is\nlike hey how are you doing what's the\nplan you know all of that yeah no\nabsolutely and that's why your podcast\nis great because you're asking the\nquestion am i doing this right\nand i think that that question is such\nthat that question is like we ask it to\nourselves all the time like i i'll be\nsitting as an interviewer\ngoing am i doing this right i'm asking\nthe right questions and i do it when i'm\nan interviewee yeah i'm being\ninterviewed i'm sitting there going am i\ndoing this right and then it happens\nwhen i'm writing my book it happens when\nit's a question that we ask again and\nagain and again what have you discovered\nby asking that question by sitting and\nhaving these amazing discussions\non the podcast what have you learned\nabout that question\nand understanding what is right um well\nit's very simple that no one knows what\nthey're doing and no one thinks they're\ndoing it right and i think that's what's\nreally bonded us with our listeners\nbecause i think they're like okay\nfinally someone else is like admitting\nthat like we have no idea what we're\ndoing and we're supposed to pretend like\nwe know how to do these things um ours\nis like our podcast is a life how-to\npodcast so we go through very confusing\nthings in adulthood that you think\nyou're supposed to know but you don't\nreally like how do i file my taxes what\nis a 401k i don't know\nyeah all these things that you're\nsupposed to know\nand you don't and you're never taught in\nschool and it's like okay we're gonna\nstop pretending that we have it all\nfigured out and we're gonna admit at\nleast me and my co-host my best friend\nnatalie are gonna admit we don't know\nanything and we'll figure it out for you\nyeah i love that i love that because\neven for me when i moved to the us i had\nto learn a whole lot oh yeah that's why\ni was like i don't know if you even know\nwhat a 401k is yeah no i do now yeah but\nit was like when i moved to the us so in\nthe uk i relied on my mom because my mom\nwas like a financial advisor that's what\ni wanted to do really nice\nan accountant oh yeah my dad's an\naccountant so i was like okay they've\ngot me covered they'll figure it out and\nthen i moved here and i was like oh and\nthen i was like trying to get help from\nthem but none of them could help me\nbecause everything's different over here\nyeah and so yeah i've had to learn about\nevery aspect of it which it is so\ncomplex if you haven't learned it at\nschool uh i wonder whether you're going\nto do a crypto episode we did a crypto\nepisode yeah amazing\nit's literally called a preschooler's\nguide to crypto i love it and like when\ni tell you we like are hand holding you\nbecause it was something that people\nhave been talking about they use big\nwords and me and my best friend are like\nwe are she's an art major like she we\ndon't know any of this we're creative\npeople and so we were like we'll look it\nup and we'll explain it to you we also\nlike drink a glass of wine every episode\nso it's fun and it's not like a boring\nted talk you know we want it to be like\nyou're going to drinks with your\ngirlfriends and you're like hey like\nwhat's crypto and you're like oh it's\nthis you know yeah i love that yeah and\nthat's awesome and i think that's how we\nall want to learn yeah we all learn more\nthrough conversation than we do through\nlike whiteboards and whatever it may be\nyeah and that sort of approach but\nwhat's been the most popular episode i'm\nintrigued i always ask that question to\nsomeone who has a podcast because i'm\nintrigued to hear about what people are\nlike really like wanting to learn what's\nbeen your most\npopular conversation that you've had we\nhad a we did an episode on morning\nroutines and we we researched how\nbillionaires start their day\nand um that one got a lot of hits i\nthink we don't only do um\nlike personal finance we started that\nway then we were like wait there's a lot\nof other things in adulthood like we\nneed to figure out which is like morning\nroutines nighttime routines that you\nknow going we just did an episode on\ngoing to therapy um and so but that one\nwe got a lot of hits on i think because\ni don't know people want to have\nsuccessful mornings like we think like\nwe were saying like me meditating in the\nmorning like starts my day off for\nsuccess so very interesting yeah oprah\nwakes up at uh\n6\n10 a.m naturally\nwithout an alarm clock which i was like\ni can never do that\ni love that yeah no i've read those\nthere's there's such incredible ones\nbecause i found that i think it was like\ni and i might be getting this wrong but\ni remember when i looked at that it was\nlike 63\nof the most successful people in the\nworld\nget like\nseven to eight hours of sleep like\nthey're actually getting their sleep\ncontrary to popular belief which is that\nyou have to sleep four hours if you want\nto be successful no a lot of them do a\nlot of them um woke up later than i did\ni i think\nsomebody and i don't want to say with\nelon musk if someone else like woke up\nat 10 or something i was like wow like\nthey're really getting a lot of sleep\nyeah you're like i should just wake up\nat 10. like this yeah why am i waking up\nearly for yeah no it's i think these\nthings are so important to study\nand i was saying this to someone earlier\ntoday that\nso a lot of people today we struggle\nbecause we're like oh well we don't want\nto be compared to this ideal or like why\nare we looking at what others are doing\nbut the truth is that you have two\noptions when you're looking at success\nyou either look at success with envy\nor you look at success with study\nbut we both have to look at it so some\npeople are looking at everyone going i\nwish i had that or\noh god why are they you know trying to\nbe perfect or whatever or we can look at\nit and say well what can i learn from\nthat yeah like how do i apply that to my\nlife and i feel like studying\nhealth healthy wealthy and wise\nindividuals is a great way to live\nbecause it helps you figure out what\nparts of it you want to apply to your\nlife yeah no a hundred percent and like\nlike i said like i'm not gonna naturally\nwake up at six a.m\ni'm gonna need an alarm clock but it is\none it's interesting and two i i mean i\nthink you can start to like find little\nthings that you can apply here and there\nand and the the rest of the episode goes\ninto just like healthy morning habits we\nwe only use like\ngovs.org so we don't just like pull from\nyou know a random article but we find\nthings that have you know real science\nbehind it yeah what's been a habit or a\nprinciple or a way someone lives or even\na financial thing that surprised you are\nyou like that's so cool like i didn't\nknow that is there anything that stood\nout like that i'll share one while\nyou're thinking for me it was\nuh we had russ on the podcast\nand i was\nobviously asking him questions about\ncreativity and music and he was saying\nthat his favorite thing to do and we'll\nboth align with this he was saying his\nfavorite thing to do is get all of his\nfriends out of the studio\nnot invite anyone over\ngo into the basement or go into the\nstudio and make weird sounds that he\nwould only make if he was on his own\nthat is and so he literally like yells\ninto the microphone he makes a weird\nsound he screams and he goes if i had my\nfriends in there i would feel so judged\nyeah i wouldn't do that so you guys for\nme the best creativity is being alone\nand just making weird noises and then\ni'll discover something like oh i want\nto find an instrument like that yeah\nlike like yeah no that's that's really\nreally interesting no i i mean i haven't\nhad anything like that on our podcast\nyet um i'm trying to think i mean like\nthis was not as cool at all so i don't\nwant to say oh no i'm just good no we\nwere we were really surprised we were\nlooking up um also like in this morning\nroutines episode like what a lot of\npeople eat in the morning and you you\nknow you you've been like um sold that\nyou need to have like bacon and eggs\nmost people have oatmeal and i was like\ni don't like oatmeal but maybe i should\ntry eating oatmeal because most\nbillionaires eat oatmeal do you know why\nthat makes me happy i've been eating\noatmeal my whole life for breakfast yeah\ni recently switched to chia pudding\nbecause i found out that i have a slight\nallergy to oats oh you do yes so i\nswitched to chia pudding which is\nactually much nicer okay well you're\nalready on your way i mean you yeah\nyou're already incredible cheer pudding\nblueberries strawberries that's your\nthat's your morning amazing such great\nokay i need to be on that yeah and like\nyou said it's all personal like you know\nlike i ever i did a micronutrient test\nrecently which is what helped me realize\nthat yeah i have a slight allergy to\noats but also like oats was leaving me\nfeeling bloated or uncomfortable\nwhatever it may be whereas chia seed\npudding has been amazing for me so you\nknow yeah yeah i guess we're going to\nredefine what billionaires eat in the\nmorning exactly it doesn't have to be a\nmeal account no it doesn't have to be\nand like everyone makes and that's the\nwhole thing with like my toolkit and\nlike that's like it's a\nchoose-your-own-adventure thing but i\nthink when you have the knowledge of\nwhat to do that empowers you to make the\nmost you know conscious decision for\nyourself yeah yeah what are you most\nexcited about what you're creating right\nnow like what's a role that you're\nplaying that you've just deeply dived\ninto and you're just feeling it or even\nif there's something coming up that\nyou're just like this is challenging me\nin a way that i know i'm growing\nyeah um\ni'm pretty sure by the time this comes\nout this will be news um i just sold my\nfirst tv

i'm in it as well um and so i\njust sold it and so i think for me this\nis like this new challenge for me i i've\nep to show before um the one on netflix\nthat stop embarrassing me but i've never\nbeen the creator and the writer and the\nep and the actor so i mean it's gonna be\nthis whole new ball game for me um and\nso yeah i'm really excited to go down\nthe path i'm terrified but again to\ncircle back\nto the beginning like i feel like i can\ndo it yeah absolutely of course you can\nand congratulations i love that you\nshared that with us and i i love that\nbecause\nit's such you're taking on just so much\ni mean to write\ncreate direct and be in it and which\npart of it do you enjoy the most or or\nis it is that a bad question\nit they're they they stretch different\nmuscles tell me about what\nyeah i get that like what\nwhat does each part of it do for you\npersonally i\ni again i'm a very type a type b person\nso i need the like rawness and then the\nrole in the in the show for myself is um\nshe has this beautiful\njourney and this beautiful evolution of\nself and discovery and so like to be\nable to be in her shoes i'm so excited\nto do but then also like from my\nproducer side like my type a side like i\ncan't wait to get everything in line and\nlike get our cast set and like i like\nchecking boxes and so like that's gonna\ngive me um that's gonna like feed that\nside of myself so it's like this perfect\nbalance of like\nmy creativity's\njust being stretched in both ways\nlife coach and therapist\nis really what it is here we go i love\nit\nwhat do you think is the most scariest\nthing you've ever taken on or the most\nlike challenging thing you've ever taken\non is this going to be it or what's up\ntill now what's been that thing personal\nprofessional uh personal there's been\nthere's been a few but i would say\nprofessional um i did a live special on\nabc of good times um it was a live\nperformance we were doing a one night\nonly thing with jimmy kimmel was hosting\nit viola davis was playing my mother i\nwas playing like an iconic character\nthelma evans and it was terrifying um\nalso um tiffany hatch was in the cast\nand it was an incredible cast and then\nlike\nimposter syndrome me and i'm like what\nam i doing here\ncan i i've never done a play before and\nessentially this is what this is and\nit's live for millions of people um so\nit was absolutely terrifying but the way\ni i coped with that fear was to come in\nso prepared that nothing could shake me\ni knew this performance front words\nbackwards i did it every day\n10 times a day my boyfriend was like\ngoing to go crazy because i was just\nsaying my line saying my lines but it\nworked out because you get there and\nyou're nervous and you're like at least\ni know my lines\ntotally i remember that except the funny\nthing for me is that i'm sure you've\nexperienced this whenever you turn up\nwith all that prepping knowing your\nlines they always change your lines on\nthe day oh yeah and you're like they\ngive you a new script\nluckily we were going from uh original\nepisodes so we could not we weren't\ngoing to go from script but that does\nalways happen yeah no i love that yeah\nbecause i always get there i'm like but\nhaving said all of that\nwhat you just said is spot on that when\nyou've done that prep you actually feel\nlike you can adapt to whatever's thrown\nat you right and that's what i've\nlearned with being an actor when you\nreally know your script that's when you\ncan play but when you're sitting there\nremembering your lines you're not\npresent you're not in the scene and so\nlike i\napplied that there which was an acting\nthing and i was just like the more i\nknow my lines the more fun i'm gonna\nhave doing this because this is the\nscariest thing i've ever done yeah\ni love that i love that all right i\nkarin i could karen talking to you for\nfun for hours and hours and hours but we\nend every episode of on purpose with the\nfinal five okay so these are the first\nfive questions have to be one word to\none sentence maximum okay so it can be\nwhatever a sentence is i don't know\nseven words nine words i don't know\nwhatever it is okay so the first\nquestion\nis what is the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nalways save a little love for yourself\noh i love that that's such i've never\nheard that before that's beautiful\nwhat's the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\num that\nwearing uggs was a good idea\ntell us why\num because i have a lot of uh horrible\nred carpet moments when i was 10 years\nold and i look back and i'm like why\nwould i wear uggs on a red carpet you\nwere ten you didn't choose those did you\nor you did i probably did i don't know\ni love that all right what gets you\nexcited and gets you excited when you're\nwaking up out of bed every morning my\nsisters\ntell us more i'm gonna oh okay oh then i\ncan explain um you don't have to i'm i'm\nintrigued oh yeah my sisters are 13 and\n14 and i look forward to hearing about\ntheir days every day because they're at\nthis pivotal age really the age where i\nwas diagnosed with anxiety and to see\nthem growing and changing every day it\nmakes me so excited and also i'm just so\nhopeful with all of gen z they're\nincredible and like you guys have it way\nmore put together than we do i love that\nquestion number four\nwhat is your current purpose so how\nwould you define your current purpose\nbeing\na voice for those that feel silenced\ni love that fifth question\nuh if you could and this can be gone\nlonger if you could meet your younger\nself again today your 14 year old self\nwhat would you tell her\nuh it's funny because i i answered this\nquestion today but um i would tell her\nit gets better\num i was also bullied um in high school\nand there was a time in which you feel\nlike it's the end of the world and i\nwish i could go back to that girl and be\nlike it it doesn't really get better it\ngets spectacular and it keeps going and\nyou're only going to go up from here\nand\ni think when you're that age you just\neverything feels like the end of the\nworld and
