    "transcript": "and i think if you can get to a place\nwhere you're not identifying with the\nlove or the the the mistreatment you're\njust like here's who i am here's the\nintention the motivation that i know i'm\nacting on and that i know that's coming\nfrom a good place and so whether they're\nsaying jay you're amazing or they're\nsaying jay you're the you know you're\nawful you're screwing this up you suck\nyou're just like i'm gonna do what i\nhave to do as long as i'm able to do it\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now today's guest\nis someone that i've interviewed not\nonce not twice not three times but this\nis the fourth time we're sitting down\ntogether the first time was at huff post\nback in like 2016 when i was just\nstarting a lot of my online work then we\ndid a nasdaq reads probably around 2017\nmaybe 2018\nand then i got to sit down with him on\nthe podcast you've already loved him on\nthe show just last year i think it was\njust before the pandemic and then now we\nare having our fourth ever interview i'm\ntalking about the one and only ryan\nholiday ryan holliday is one of the\nworld's best selling living philosophers\nhis books like the obstacle is the way\nego is the enemy the daily stoic uh have\nall reached number one new york times\nbestseller status and stillness is the\nkey\nappears in more than 40 languages and\nall of his books have sold more than 4\nmillion copies together they've spent\nover 300 weeks 300 weeks on the\nbestseller lists\nhe lives outside austin with his wife\nand two boys and a small herd of cows\nand donkeys and goats and he also opened\nup his own bookstore which i love\nthe painted porch\nand sits on the historic main street in\nbastrop texas and his new book the\ncourage is calling already a new york\ntimes bestseller\nif you haven't read it i highly\nrecommend that you go and grab it uh\nryan like you did for so many others you\nopened up our minds and lives to the\nteachings of the stoics which i am\neternally grateful for because uh i\nthink you've brought so much wisdom\nthrough that we would have missed out on\nand you also in many ways inspired me to\nthink about how i could do something\nsimilar for vedic philosophers and\nthoughts so thank you from a personal\nlevel a collective level uh societal\nlevel for i've seen you do a lot of\nactivism work too but ryan welcome back\nto the show no thanks for having me and\nit's crazy we do go way back and i think\nboth of us had somewhat circuitous\njourneys to where we are now like you\ninterviewed me on two different shows\nbefore you had your own show\ni did a bunch of stuff before i was a\nwriter to me i in case people don't pick\nup on what that means\nis like just because you're not like\nvery rarely does anyone just get to\nstart like by having their own platform\nor putting out their own thing\nand you have to take jobs or do things\nyou have to work your way there and i\nthink uh\npeople who are in the middle of that\nsometimes you don't know where it's\ngonna end up you can kind of lose faith\nbut i think in both of our cases like we\nput in the work paid our dues and we did\nget there and uh i hope that's\nencouraging to people because it it it's\namazing uh it always takes longer than\nyou think it should but eventually you\nget there absolutely yeah i remember\ntalking to you about like you know you\nstarted in marketing and you know you\ntalk about your time at american apparel\nand then i also remember talking to you\nabout how you're the leonardo dicaprio\nof writers where you'd written all these\namazing books that were epic and you\nwere waiting for this you know the\narbitrary idea of ranking on the list\nand i i you know i think we were talking\nabout that last time when we were\nmessaging and i was like you know\nleonardo dicaprio has been nominated for\nan oscar seven times and only one once\nand that's pretty much the same as you\nuh and and it's just one of those\namazing things that\nall your journey has brought you to this\npace and now when you look back\nat your\nbeautiful portfolio of books and i know\nthat courageous calling is the part of a\nnew set of four books\nuh i really like that you started with\nthat point that we've known each other\nthrough a lot of different faces a lot\nof different names a lot of different uh\nbanners\nand you know today it's beautiful to sit\nwith you and and do this again but\nyou know it started very differently but\ni have to be honest i've had fun with\nyou since day one so i'm expecting this\nto be no different\nwell you know people talk about like ten\nthousand hours right that takes ten\nthousand hours to get to mastery i i\nthink two things are easy to miss there\nnumber one um\nit's not ten thousand hours of of\nterrible grinding labor it should be fun\nand i have a ton of fun along the way\nand two\njust because it might take ten thousand\nhours or it could take twenty thousand\nhours or a hundred thousand hours to\nactually get to the place where you've\nreally truly mastered it that doesn't\nmean that you can't make a great living\nbetween now and then and that you can't\ndo work that you're proud of that stands\nup like i'm this is my i think 12th book\nwow um i'm proud of all the books in\nbetween but the 12th book is only\npossible because of the 11th and the\n10th and the 9th and the 8th\nthe idea should be that you're on this\njourney and that you're getting better\nas you go even though you are\nyou know not ideally where you want to\nbe but but you're you're having fun\nalong the way as you said absolutely and\ni wanted to start off somewhere before\nwe dive into all the wisdom and the\ninsight and the practices i wanted to\nknow what does it feel like as an author\nduring the pandemic to have opened your\nown bookstore called the painted porch\nlike that it's it seems like a really f\nit's like being an artist and then\nopening your own art gallery right and\nwith other people's art in it as well as\nyours of course tell what does that feel\nlike well it was very exciting at first\ni think right around the time i saw you\nlast that was when i was thinking about\ndoing it and we'd sort of made some of\nthe initial decisions to do it and then\ni believe we'd hired our first employee\nin february of 2020. so it was all very\nexciting and then it got very terrifying\nand very real and uh\nvery overwhelming quickly because the\nwhole world shut down and\nyou know i think we we thought it would\nbe a project that would take a year and\nit took two years\nand\nthat was obviously more expensive than\nintended and scarier than intended but\nit also\nwas an opportunity to take it slow to do\nit right to really think about why we\nwere doing it and how we wanted to do it\nand then it gave us a whole other sense\nof what the meaning of\nit was right so you know you're thinking\nhey bookstores are important because\nit's a place people go you can be around\nother people you can talk about things\nand then when you when we were looking\nat a world where that was\nnot possible you suddenly realize what\nthose things mean to you and you don't\ntake them so much for granted anymore so\nit was really it was uh it was a very\ntrying and challenging experience to be\nsure\nbut\nthe upside was it made the rewards of it\nso far\nyou know much more compelling and and\nmeaningful i think yeah i love that it's\nwonderful it's wonderful hearing that\nyou know you've got through and and\nyou've figured it out and i'm sure it's\nbeen harder than it needed to be but\nuh it sounds wonderful and i hope i get\na visit so i really look forward to\nactually going there i've never been\nnever been able to go to a bookstore and\nsay my friend my friend owns this and\nhe's a writer it's cool so uh i i really\nlook forward to i mean books are such an\namazing thing like if you think about\nwhat a book is right like a book is 10\nyears or a lifetime of work and\nunderstanding bound between two covers\nfor like 20 like it's this incredible\npiece of technology that's you know now\nendured for thousands of years that i\njust books have been so important in my\nlife obviously there's there's different\nbusinesses i would open if what i was\ninterested in is making more money um a\nbookstore in 2021 let alone during a\npandemic is you know like uh not not not\nthe best um but i think you know i have\na podcast too and and there's something\namazing about reaching millions of\npeople at scale digitally throughout the\nworld\nbut but there is also something special\nabout holding things and having a space\nand so\ni just it\nit my wife and i were just thinking like\nyou know we've been so blessed we've got\nto do so many cool things\nwhat is something that that could be fun\ncould also be a business opportunity but\nyou know i think improve the community\nin which we live and that that's kind of\nwhat i've just been thinking about more\nlately is like not everything has to be\nlike how do i reach as many people as\npossible it could also be like how do\nyou really reach the peop the smaller\namount of people that you are reaching\nyeah i i couldn't agree with you more\nfor me as well it's always been about\nscale and depth scale and depth and it's\nlike you know you have scale but how can\nyou go deep with that scale but then\nalso how can you scale down and take\npeople even on a more meaningful and\ndeeper journey more personally and\ni was able to do that even digitally\nduring the pandemic we a lot of me and\nmy private coaching clients people that\ni work with one-on-one we started this\nlike small meditation communities for\nthem and their families or them and\ntheir friends on zoom and i was teaching\ni'm used to teaching in you know\nmeditation on instagram live to you know\nhundreds of thousands or millions of\npeople after people watch it on the\nreplay and to actually just sit on a\nzoom with just 10 faces every single\nweek\nwas beautiful like it's it's been some\nof the most meaningful work i've ever\ndone and\nyou're spot on so i get that now i want\nto start uh i've got so many questions\nto ask you around so and we've just been\nchatting so and i need to like actually\neveryone's going to be like what are you\nguys doing joe's just having a\nconversation uh which is partly what i'm\ndoing but\ni want to find out you introduced\nstoicism\nto the world in a huge way massively\nlike you know really brought it out\nbeyond where i think it had been at\nleast from my knowledge uh at least for\nme definitely and and i wanted to\nunderstand like\ncan you tell us the story of how you\ndiscovered stoicism\nand\nhow that first moment made you feel and\nwhy you felt compelled to share with the\nrest of the world i think a lot of what\nwe're doing uh you and i are doing is\nsort of paying it forward right somebody\nintroduced you to the ideas and they hit\nyou and you had this amazing sort of\nlife-changing transformation because of\nthat\nand and then there's this kind of moment\nwhere you go\ncould i do that for someone else and\nthen we're talking about scale earlier\nhow could i do that like even better how\ncould i do that to how could i take what\ni experienced and not just do it to the\npeople that i physically interact with\nbut millions of people so i was in\ncollege and i went to this conference in\nwest hollywood\nand uh the speaker was dr drew uh from\nfrom hln and from loveline uh now he has\na a wonderful podcast as well and he was\nspeaking and i had grown up listening to\nloveline and so i remember at that age i\nwould whenever i would meet smart people\nuh that i admired or that i had some you\nknow random circumstances to me i'd be\nlike what books do you recommend because\ni just just thinking there's so many\nbooks out in the world um how do you\nknow which ones to read and if you just\ni was thinking if i just read the ones\nthat really smart people that i admire\nhave read i'll i'll be like skipping all\nthe the stuff that you know it'll be\nlike uh uh it's like getting uh you know\nnotes from from from people ahead of you\nand so um i asked him and he told me he\nwas reading the writings of epictetus\nwho is this uh roman slave um and i went\nback to my hotel room and i bought\nepictetus and i bought marcus aurelius\nbecause i'd seen the movie gladiator and\nuh\nand and these two books arrived and they\nthey hit me i read mark cerrelia's first\nactually here let me grab this is my now\nuh 15 year old copy of meditations um\ni've had to re-tape the cover on because\ni i've read it so many times but but you\nknow you read meditations\nand it just it it hit me it hit me like\na million bricks i mean in the in the\nfirst line of meditations he says and\nthis is like one of my he says when you\nawake in the morning tell yourself the\npeople i will deal with today will be\nmeddling ungrateful arrogant dishonest\njealous and surly and he says they are\nlike this because they can't tell good\nfrom evil and then but he goes but they\ncan't implicate me in ugliness nor can i\nfeel angry at my relative or hate him we\nwere born to work together like feet and\nhands and eyes to feel anger at someone\nto turn your back on him these are\nobstructions and i just i just remember\nbeing hit by that going like\nthe emperor of rome wrote this like he\njust wrote a note to himself about\nhow frustrating and annoying people are\ngonna be but that he couldn't let this\nchange him or make him angry\nand that he had this obligation to work\ntogether with them\nand and i remember i was taking\nphilosophy classes at the time\nbut it was nothing like this like when\nyou read aristotle i mean there's\ndefinitely good parts in it but you're\nalso like what is he talking about right\nlike he's explaining the universe or\nsomething he's not saying like this is\nhow you deal with a jerk in traffic or\nyou know this is how you deal with your\nobnoxious roommate right like i just\nlove that marcus ruiz was being so real\nand so practical but at the same time\ntrying to be\ngreat like trying to be decent and good\nand patient\nand\ni just that was transformative for me\nand eventually you know got to a place\nwhere i thought maybe i could write\nstuff like this or i could write about\nstuff like this and uh that's been the\njourney for me now for a decade and a\nhalf yeah i love that thank you for\nsharing that so much and and i love so\nmuch about what you just said so first\nof all i want to point out to everyone\nwho's listening i love that you went up\nto someone and asked what books do you\nrecommend because that's such a great\nquestion because 99 of people\ndon't go up and the one percent of\npeople that do go up they go up and say\nhow can i spend more time with you or\nhow can i connect with you or how can\nhow can we have dinner or lunch or\nwhatever it may be and the answer 99 of\nthe time is i don't think i have time\nfor that like i'm not sure that's gonna\nhappen i'd love to but it's it's not\npossible and so by asking them what\nbooks they're reading\nyou're tapping into their mindset for\ndays weeks months years that you would\nnever get time and access to someone\nthat inspires you in that way and thank\nyou for so much for reading the first\none i mean anyone who listens to that\nyou're just like i want to live like\nthat right like that's that's how you\nfeel straight away you go i want to live\nlike that well the crazy thing about the\nbook question is um\nso like even today you know\ni got a bunch of emails from random\npeople which is all very nice i'm not\ngonna be able to respond to all of them\nbut somebody was like hey uh i'm\nstruggling with depression what's a book\nyou would recommend and i would like to\nbe two seconds to reply right and like\nth of all the emails today that's the\none that i responded to because i love\nbooks and i if that's an easy way i can\nhelp a person but the crazy thing about\nthe dr drew story was like three months\nlater i went to a different conference\nand he was there again i don't know how\ni don't know how the the odds of it work\nbut i went up to him and i was like you\nprobably don't remember me but i read\nthose books right and he was like i do\nremember you but i did not think you\nwere gonna read those books and he and i\nare friends now like 20 years later 15\nyears later we still know each other\nbecause i didn't just get the\nrecommendation but then i actually did\nthe work like i read the book and now he\nand i have this connection forever and i\nthink um\nthe amount of people that like ask me\nfor recommendation\nversus the amount of people i hear back\nfrom who have actually taken the time to\nread the book you know it's it's it's a\na small percentage of a small percentage\nand so these books are out there these\nbooks that have changed people's lives\npeople have been through the exact same\nthing that you've been through um\nthey're there\nbut no one can read them for you\nyeah no absolutely well said and this\nleads us nicely to courage is calling\nthe you know the new book because\nto me you know we have this perception\nthat\nto have a great life we need to be brave\nwe need to be courageous uh but you\nactually start the book at\nfear\nand and i think what's fascinating about\nthat is\na lot of people have the fear or we\nthink we lack the courage to go up to\nsomeone and ask a question\nthen we fear\ntaking the step of ordering the books\nbecause we're thinking oh when will i\nget time to read them and they're just\ngoing to become a door stopper and then\nmaybe i'll feel worse about myself or\nmaybe we get beyond that and we order\nthem and then we fear reading them we go\noh no well that may need me to change or\nthat may need me to shift or i may have\nto give up some luxury or some comfort\nthat i'm used to there's fear at every\nsingle step walk us through\nhow fear can be something that is\nnecessary but it's also just expected\nwhen you make an important point about\ncourage which i really tried to build\nthe book around which is that courage is\nnot just\nrunning into battle or a burning\nbuilding or jumping out of an airplane\nuh or\nyou know it's not just\nphysical danger\nand it's not always dramatic right so\nthere's physical courage and moral\ncourage moral courage is also the\ncourage of a whistleblower or a truth\nteller or a transgressive artist but\nit's also just the courage to like walk\nup and talk to a stranger that there's\nalso this really small day-to-day\ncourage it doesn't it's not always this\ndramatic glorious thing and i think\nyou're right like a lot of a lot of\nreally basic things in our life come\ndown to a failure of courage even even\nyou think about people who are afraid to\ntry something not because they're afraid\nof failing which they probably are but\nalso just afraid of of of success right\nlike afraid of what\nwhat changes would be demanded or what\nit would mean to then have to wrestle\nwith this thing and so\nit's it's not that we don't know what we\nshould do\nit's that we have a million reasons why\nwe shouldn't do it right right that's\nwhat fear is fear is the thing that gets\nin the way\nuh what stephen pressfield calls the\nresistance between you know what we can\nbe and where we are so it's not that\ncourageous people do not feel those\nfears it's that they push past them\nright the things we want in life are on\nthe other side of that fear like all\ngood things in life\nrequire courage i i would imagine\nthere's very little that anyone\nlistening could think of in their own\nlife that they're proud of\nthat did not require some triumph over\nfear um certainly everything that i'm\nproud of in my life was something that i\nhad to push myself out of my comfort\nzone to get yeah absolutely no i think\nyou're spot on i mean\nyeah when i'm i'm thinking about that\nright now and i hope everyone who's\nlistening or watching is thinking about\nthat too i\ni can't think of i can barely think of\nanything if if anything at all and so\nyou know that aligns very strongly and i\ni like\nyou know in the book there's the part\nthat you wrote that says and there has\nnever ever been a time when the average\nopinion of faceless unaccountable\nstrangers\nshould be valued\nover our own judgment and and i love\nthat because i think we're living at a\ntime when faceless unaccountable\nstrangers\ndictate everything in our lives whether\nit's a comment whether it's a dm whether\nit's uh you know a message an email\nwalk us through\nwhy is it that we take\nunaccountable faceless strangers so\nseriously that why does that exist look\nit's not like this just some modern\nthing right in meditations mark cerullo\nsays the crazy thing is we all love\nourselves more than other people we're\nall self-interested selfish people it's\na certain degree right and he says and\nyet we value other people's opinions\nmore than our own right you see this\nsweatshirt you like and you buy it and\nthen someone's like what's that you're\nlike oh you don't like it i i shouldn't\nlet you know like or or you spend to on\nthe other end of the spectrum you know\nyou spend two years writing a book and\nthen you go but but did the critics\naccept me did the publisher like it you\nknow it you can even find yourself is it\nany good and it's like\nwho is this person to decide that it's\nany good you're the one you know this is\nwhy you do what you do and yet we hand\nover approval\nsuccess to other people and like look\nwhen when the obstacle is the way it\ncame out um\njust just to just to sort of illustrate\nthis idea that nobody knows anything um\nthe publisher offered me half what\nthey'd offered me for my first book for\nwhat was my second book so right out of\nthe gate i had the idea for the\nobstacles the way and the publisher said\nthat idea is half as good as your last\nidea they they like they did not believe\nin it um look they believed in it enough\nto purchase it but they they did not\nhave high hopes a close friend of mine i\nfound out later predicted that it would\nsell 5 000 copies right\nit came out it didn't hit the best\nsellers the week it came out it sold\nlike maybe 30 000 copies in the first\nsix months maybe 60 000 in the first\nyear um did not hit a bestseller list\nfor the first five years of its\nexistence and then ultimately has gone\non to sell you know uh about a million\nand a half copies so\nthe success of that book\nif i was judging it based on what other\npeople said\num would have been a failure would have\nbeen a disappointment would have been\nuh mediocre at best um but what i knew\nis that it was one something was really\nimportant to me\ntwo i knew it was something that because\nit had been so important to me that with\ntime it would resonate with people\nand then three um it was pleasurable and\nexciting and rewarding for me to do\nand so kind of everything beyond that\nwas extra\nand\ni moved on to other projects and let it\ndo what it did so the fact that it's now\nhad all the success is one is a\nwonderful bonus on top but that that\nwasn't why i did it because if it was\nwhy i if that was what had been\nmotivating me from the beginning i never\nwould have done it because it would have\nbeen killed the second the offer came\nback from the publisher and they said\nyou know and that that is how it works\nin life there you know people are often\nworried about somebody stealing your\nidea\nand the there's a great line from a\nphysicist whose name i'm forgetting but\nhe said don't worry about that he says\nif it's an original idea you're going to\nhave to ram it down people's throats\nbecause people aren't gonna get it at\nfirst everything that's new exciting\ninnovative important\nwas\nunappreciated or outright despised when\nit came out so you have to be able to\ncultivate this sense of why you're doing\nwhat you're doing why it's valuable why\nit's important what it means to you\nand you have to get to a place where\nyou're a little bit indifferent which is\na stoic term meaning that if people love\nit great if they hate it that's okay too\nbut you have your own sense of it and\nthat's what what allows you to sort of\nignore both of those things yeah no that\nthat indifference i find so fascinating\nbecause\nwhen you first hear it\nit sounds like\nthere's no fun and and it sounds like\nthere's no joy but actually when you\nlive it\nit's liberating and and i find that\nthere's something really fascinating i i\nremember first coming across that when i\nuh was around probably like 20 years old\ni was the the president of a youth\norganization back in london\nand i took on this role at about 18\nyears old i was given it i didn't\naudition for it i didn't apply for it i\nwas given it\nand\nfor two years my life was held because\neverything i did was massively\ncriticized because it wasn't as good as\nthe previous president and so\nand i was i don't know nothing about\nleadership i mean you know leadership is\na really big complex\nconscious thoughtful thing i was 18\ndidn't know anything anyway for two\nyears everything i did was criticize it\nwas ridiculed it was compared\nand i started to feel really bad about\nmyself but the one thing i held on to\nwas that\neveryone's criticizing me for my\nmanagement but not for who i am and and\ni held on to that very closely i was\nlike okay i'm a bad manager i'm a bad\nleader i'll take that all day no one's\nsaying i'm a bad person i'm gonna hold\non to that\nand then something really fascinating\nhappened that we had a fundraiser when i\nwas about 20 years old and that\nfundraiser i like outperformed where i\nraised lots of money for this really\nimportant foundation and all this and\nall of a sudden the same people were\nlike oh my god jay you're like the best\nthing in the world and you're incredible\nand it was that day that i promised\nmyself\nthat i would remain indifferent and i\npromised myself i remember still now at\n21 promising myself going i am not going\nto let the opinions of other people make\nme feel good or bad\nand that doesn't stop me from feeling\njoy because i get to feel good for\nmyself when i feel like i've done\nsomething right does that does that feel\nright yeah totally it's kind of similar\nto in in meditation right you have these\nthoughts and you realize you don't have\nto identify with the thoughts they can\njust exist right like a cloud exists and\nit's there in your view and then it\ndrifts off and you don't really know\nwhat happens to it right and i think\nthis is where we want to get with\nsuccess as well as criticism or failure\nor or worse right like being attacked\nundeservedly um mark surrealist talks\nabout being able to accept success\nwithout arrogance and let the rest go\nwith indifference and i think if you can\nget to a place where you're not\nidentifying with the love or the the the\nmistreatment you're just like here's who\ni am here's the intention the motivation\nthat i know i'm acting on and that i\nknow that's coming from a good place and\nso whether they're saying jay you're\namazing or they're saying jay you're the\nyou know you're awful you're screwing\nthis up you suck you're just like i'm\ngonna do what i have to do as long as\ni'm able to do it and i'm not gonna\nidentify either way and i think you know\npeople sort of nod their head along with\nthis it's easy to identify with the\nsuccess on the way up\nbut then what happens to those people is\nwhat happens when you inevitably screw\nup uh run into bad luck or whatever you\nthink about an athlete if an athlete is\nidentifying with the the hot streak that\nthey're on well statistically that's\njust not going to last right and so\nyou have to become you have to\nunderstand that you're going to lose\nthat you're going to miss you're going\nto screw up and you if you're in a place\nwhere you identify with those external\nresults you're uh you're really really\nvulnerable uh and you're gonna be really\nunhappy uh especially in those dark\nthose dark dark moments yeah so so ryan\nthen what do we do with fear if\neveryone's listening and watching\nthey're going through the fears that we\nwe know that they are what do we do with\nfear i feel like it's such a we're\nalmost scared of the emotion in and of\nitself and then we panic well the stoics\nuh obviously believe in the power of\nreason right and a lot of fear\nyou could say is unreasonable right like\nuh you think about\nfailure right let's say you're putting\nout a book i'm putting out a book uh and\nyou're like uh what if it doesn't do\nwell right and you're sort of scared of\nthis\nwhat the stokes would say is\nwhat if that happens like what does it\nactually mean right not like oh\nit's this vague unpleasant thing but\nwhat does that look like well you\nalready got paid for it you already did\nthe thing right like actually it failing\nis is nothing it doesn't matter at all\nright like it's not what you would\nchoose but you're not going to end up\nunder a bridge they're not going to tar\nand feather you or something right like\nthere's there's no consequences and so\nthis is a really important thing i\nremember when i was dropping out of\ncollege i was so scared about it and i\nwas so convinced that i shouldn't do it\nbecause i i was afraid of what might\nhappen and i remember one of my mentors\ngoes\nyou know um\nhe says like when i when i was in\ncollege i got sick for a year and i\nspent he spent a year in the hospital\nand i was like and what happened and he\nwas like it's literally not come up once\nin my life he's like i graduated in five\nyears instead of four years he's like\nthe worst thing that could happen here\nis that you just go back to school and\nyou have to make up for the time that\nyou missed and and that was really\nimportant right like the to break down\nthe thing that you're afraid of to\nreally think about the worst case\nscenario right people are afraid of of\nlike uh that i have stage fright right i\ndon't like talking in front of crowds\nliterally what is the worst thing that\ncould happen a bunch of strangers you'll\nnever meet again don't like you like\nyou'll be totally fine and so part of\nwhat we should do with fear is really\nbreak it down because sometimes hey\ni'm peering over this cliff that uh\nsomeone's telling me to jump off of\num maybe that's a really bad idea right\nsometimes you use the power of reason\nand it reminds you oh this is a bad idea\ni can't afford to lose this but most of\nthe time we break those fears down and\nthen we're better able to manage that\nfear because we have a rational\nunderstanding of it instead of this sort\nof irrational emotional understanding of\nit yeah and it's incredible once you\nbreak through that fear\nhow now you're looking at it you're like\ni can't believe i was ever scared of\nthat right isn't isn't that just such a\nfascinating trick of the mind that as\nsoon as you break something that felt\ninsurmountable\nnow when you've overcome it you you're\nalmost laughing at yourself like how was\nthat the thing that held me back well so\neach time you do something that you were\nafraid of you pushed through\nyou have more confidence right you have\na like dropping out of college made it\neasier for me to then leave my corporate\nlife later to become a writer right\nbecause it was like oh i could just go\nget another job or i could get the same\njob again right yeah and so you not only\nget a certain amount of confidence from\nit but you also\nget a better understanding of how things\nwork the problem is when you give into\nfear not only do not do the thing now\nyou actually have less information about\nhow the world works and so you know\nthere's that that sort of cliche about\ndo one thing every day that scares you\nit's actually pretty good advice right\nyou're sort of building the muscle\nyou're building that ability to override\nthe\nthis seems scary\nbut i'm going to do it anyway\ni think cultivating that that ability to\nsort of push through that fear\nis really important and and i think\nagain these sometimes can be very\npedestrian fears it's like i remember\nthe decision\nfor daily stoic which is one of the the\nthings i do the decision to like make\nvideos right like and i remember talking\nto you about this it's like i was very\ncomfortable uh\nwriting things i was very comfortable\nbeing on stage but the idea of making a\nvideo like i was just scared it would be\nbad i would i think i was really scared\nof being uncomfortable in a new thing\nand\nuh but pushing past that it's opened up\nthis sort of whole avenue for us but\nthen also you know the decision to make\nsort of long form videos also made it\neasier to be like oh tick tocks this\nthing now i can you know you what you're\ncultivating is the ability to\nbe comfortable being uncomfortable yeah\nand knowing that you'll figure it out\nand eventually get comfortable again\nyeah and what i find so fascinating\nabout what you just said ryan is that\neven when we make big leaps\nor we break through or we find courage\nit's so easy to get comfortable again\nlike it's fascinating isn't it like i i\nremember when so when i went off to\nbecome a monk obviously i broke that\nbarrier completely i was like i don't\ncare if i get a job it doesn't matter so\ni felt extremely confident and\ncourageous not that i used those words\nbut that's what i would have felt at the\ntime and then when i left being a monk\nit was a tough time but again that was a\ntough decision so that built more\ncourage and confidence then i found a\njob but as soon as i got into a job i\nremember\nleaving that job i mean i left it within\ntwo years but it's like there was a\nmoment that that comfort started to feel\nreally safe and comfort is like really\nalluring it's it's really\nmesmerizing and i find that comfort\nreally convinces you\nthat this is it\nsettle for this it's safer it's better\nit's happier\nwhat are the things that you do to build\nthat courage muscle every day or do\nsomething out of your comfort zone so\nthat you don't get comfortable is there\nsomething that you've been working on or\nor something that you've seen others do\nthat you've spoken to on your podcast\nwell this is the paradox right we tell\nourselves like i can't do it now i'm\ngonna wait till i'm more financially\nsuccessful i'm gonna wait till i'm more\nwell known i'm gonna wait till i put in\nmore years or then i'll speak up then\ni'll put myself out there then i'll take\nthis risk\nit'd be wonderful if it worked that way\nbut in fact it's the exact opposite\nright you think oh after i've put 10\nyears into this company then i'll put\nout this new idea then i'll stay but no\nnow you don't want to lose 10 years of\nwork right you'd think that financial\nthe financially successful people would\nbe the most comfortable taking the risks\nbut they have the the luxury the\nprivilege of knowing exactly what it\nmight cost them right and they know how\nhard they had to work to get there and\nso this is why people are afraid to be\npolitically active this is why people\nare afraid to voice unpopular opinions\ni'm sure you and i both know people with\nplatforms that have really strong\nopinions about things that are happening\nin the world but they just don't want to\nget involved because they know how hard\nit was to get where they are\nand they don't want to lose that and so\nyou do have to cultivate again to go to\nthis kind of indifference like look it's\nwonderful to have the audience it's\nwonderful to have the fancy stuff\nbut\nyou didn't like i say this to people who\nsometimes get mad about things i say\nthey're like how could you say that\ndidn't you understand you would you know\nmake me angry or whatever and i go look\ni didn't cultivate this platform to not\nsay what i think right like the job is\nnot having the platform the job is not\nthis or that the job is doing the thing\nright is the the\nspeaking the truth saying what needs to\nbe said speaking to what i think is\nimportant and so\nwe can really lie to ourselves we can\ntell ourselves later i'm going to do\nthis right we say oh i need to make some\nmoney first and then i'm going to you\nknow write that screenplay or do that\nthing or whatever you're not going to do\nit because then you're going to be too\ncomfortable and so\nyou you kind of have to see that comfort\nthat that like taking it for grantedness\nas the enemy because it's it's what\nmakes you afraid you don't want to lose\nit yeah i i'm so glad you said that and\ni went through something similar\nrecently with with some of my team where\ni was explaining to them they were\nsaying jay don't you think that's a risk\nand i was just like well i work this\nhard so that i can take more risks like\ni had to take risks to get here and i'm\nonly excited if i'm able to take more\nrisks and try new things out because\nwhat was the point otherwise i'm already\nliving in bonus land right like i'm\nalready\nplaying with house money yeah yeah\nexactly you're living in a space that\nyou're just\ni'm so much more blessed than i ever\nthought i would be\nand so with that i feel comes a bit more\nresponsibility comes a bit more desire\nfor risk and i'm not just with my risk\nfor personal growth i mean i mean to try\nthings that i think are beneficial to\nhelp others to serve or do things that\nmay be unexpected of me because i\nunderstand how that leads to more impact\nor service yeah there's a great story\nabout lyndon johnson when he proposes\npassing the civil rights legislation and\nuh one of his aides says you know maybe\nyou should wait till after re-election\nthey say this could be bad uh you know\nit's going to be risky politically and\nhe says what the hell is the presidency\nfor right and it's important to realize\nthat literally the most powerful man in\nthe world was struggling with and and\nthis is that's how seductive it is you\nyou get all the way to the top of\nwhatever it is that you're doing and\nthen there's reasons right that you\nshouldn't do x y or z\nand at a certain point you have to say\nto yourself what was the point of all of\nthis if i'm not going to do what i care\nabout what i like what i love what i\nthink needs to be done\nand that's really what courage is about\nthe courage to say\ni'm not going to think about those\nconsequences i'm going to do it because\nit is the right thing to do\ncome\nwhatever may and there's no question\nthat things i've written things i've\nsaid things i've done have cost me a\ncertain number of followers let's say\nwhich you know ultimately can translate\nfinancially but i'm proud of what i said\ni'm proud of what i put out i can look\nmyself in the mirror and one of the\nquestions i ask myself and i'd be\ncurious if you think about this too\nas someone who didn't create the things\nthat i write about like stoicism is this\nway of thinking that's existed now for\n2500 or so years and i i happen to be a\nwell-known sort of\nrepresentative of that idea but it's not\nmine and so the thing i tell myself is\nor the the test i have is am i being a\ngood steward of that philosophy yes and\nso if if i'm afraid\nit would be the same thing for the\npresidency you're not you don't own the\npresidency you're just the guy or woman\nsitting in that chair right now and the\nquestion is are you being a good steward\nof the office of the occupation of the\nopportunity um or are you just\nprotecting what's good for you in the\nmoment and so i think about you know is\nthis the right thing to do or talk about\nnot is this going to win me the most\nfriends yes yeah absolutely yeah no and\ni think i asked a very similar question\nlike for me it's\nyou know it is servitorship it is\nfiguring out like to what degree\nand a big part of that for me has always\nbeen if i see other people\nhelping\nthe world\nhow do i view them\nand it was really interesting i was\nsitting with my team recently and like\nthere you know i think i i've always\nbeen a fan of viewers and you've known\nthat from day one but you know it's like\nfor me when i see other people who i\nbelieve that positively impacting\npeople's minds\ni want to collaborate connect do more\ntogether because i i feel like we need\nmore of that and i was speaking to my\nteam recently because i was talking\nabout collaborating with someone and\nthey were saying well jay you know like\nmaybe they're you know like maybe they\nsee it as competition and i was just\nlike well why would i compete with\nsomeone who's trying who has the same\ngoal as me it seems and i think that's\nhow i try and measure where my intention\nis because often you know if i get lost\nin that hierarchy myself that's when you\nstart to recognize that your intention\nisn't as pure as you think it is well\nthis is another thing i think requires a\ncertain amount of courage as far as\none's worldview what you're talking\nabout is deciding not to see the world\nas a zero-sum place right so some people\ngo through the world and like this is\nabout my career this is about my success\nit's about my family right it's about my\nbusiness um and and there's no question\nthat attitude\nbecause it's so singularly focused can\nmake you very successful but i think\nit's more enjoyable ultimately morally\nrooted to go through the world of\nthinking about it as how does everyone\nwin how does everyone get something out\nof this and that was something you know\ni started my first email list not\ntalking about my own work but just\nrecommending books that i've loved yeah\nand i've done that now for since i don't\nknow 12 13 years like i hear just as\noften from people uh who\ntheir lives were changed not by\nsomething i wrote but by a book from\nsomeone else that i recommended and and\nthat was a big breakthrough for me\nrealizing oh um not only is it not zero\nsum but that helping other people just\nbeing a resource period also helps you\nand so i think you know with your\npodcast like look you could just make\nyour own content every day but the\ndecision to talk to and share other\npeople's stuff it benefits you and them\nand i think the more\nthe more secure one can be in themselves\nuh the more helpful they can be to other\npeople and then ultimately the more\nimpact everyone can have together yeah\nabsolutely i i love that because i was\nsharing with someone recently i was like\nyou know one of the and i feel this is\nwhat you've done with the stoics and and\nwhat you were sharing for marcus\naurelius but you know for me i've just\nalways been fascinated by studying\npeople's lives always been fascinated by\nstudying and i love studying people and\nmindsets and decisions and choices\nand and i was thinking that we all have\nto look at people and we all have two\nchoices you either study people or you\nenvy people those are the only\npractically two choices you have if you\ndon't deeply study there will be some\ncomparison some envy some criticism some\nsome sort of unhealthy trait that comes\nout and if you study someone then you\nappreciate you admire you honor and i\nknow that in my life i would rather live\nwith admiration honor appreciation of\nothers than the other stuff and so i\nnaturally gravitate towards how can i\nstudy someone's life and when i see you\nstudying the stoics that's what you're\ndoing you're studying their life sharing\nyour study and your notes with us uh and\nand to me it's almost like thinking oh\nyou know that person just sold their\nhouse on our street for x amount of\nmoney oh my gosh that house is not worth\nthat much it doesn't look that good\nyou're not realizing that the whole\nvalue of the street just went up because\nof that house and and i think that's\nwhere people don't recognize that\nthat collective good is always better\nthan individual success\nyeah there's a great joke i heard that\nthat envy is the only sin that isn't any\nfun ah yes right like\nsex is fun uh even overeating is fun\nright all most of the deadly sins are at\nleast fun while you're doing them yeah\nenvy sucks no one is having less fun\nthan the person who is being eaten up\nwith envy and jealousy yeah and so the\nthe decision and it does have to be a\ndecision because i think there's\nprobably some evolutionary reasons why\nwe feel envy um\nthe decision to say like i'm just gonna\nbe happy for people i'm gonna help other\npeople i'm gonna help other people and\nnot ask for anything in return i'm just\ngonna try to put good stuff out in the\nworld i'm gonna try to\nuse my assets to help other people and i\nhope other people do the same but i'm\nnot gonna be pissed off when that\ndoesn't happen\nthat's a real lifestyle choice and uh\ni've tried both and the other one is\njust it's not fun and it doesn't get you\nwhat you want you know um being being\nbitter being resentful being\nclosed off or selfish\nit's it's not fun totally and and if and\naccording to your line of thought which\ni which i like is that if there's an\nevolutionary purpose of envy one of them\npotentially could be to lead us to study\nright to study what we envy like that\nthat that's something that could i have\nno idea that's not a you know a factual\nthought it's just an idea that i'm\nhaving that yeah like envy would make\nyou go oh well let me deeply look at\nthat let me understand how that person\ngot there let me let me actually lead to\nstudy through that right so it can be\nhealthy and useful let's look at the\ntrade-offs right i think often times too\nthe thing the person that you're jealous\nof if you had to go\nbut is it actually fun to be them right\nlike i think oftentimes we'll look at\nsomething that someone has and will want\nthat thing so we'll be jealous of them\nbut we don't understand that it's\nimpossible to separate that thing from\nall the other parts of them\nand so it may well be\nthat it's a bad bargain right and that\nthe reason you don't have it is that you\nunderstand that those other trade-offs\nthey made aren't worth it or perhaps\nthey're impossible for you and so i\nthink just really understanding like\nwhat you want uh what you have that\nthat's that's another big part of it the\nstoics talk about like how jealous you\nwould be of yourself if you didn't have\nthose things right or how sad you would\nbe if they went away and so instead of\nbeing jealous of other people just step\nback and try to practice some gratitude\nfor what you have these are all ways i\nthink of getting to a happier place yeah\nfor sure i i wonder from you\nwhat is something currently that there\nare two questions here i'm going to ask\nboth of them now and then you can take\nthem what is the\nthing that you've been\nin the last 12 months fearing the most\nwhat is what has been a fear that you've\nbeen tackling with and then second\nquestion to follow that up with is\nyou know what do you think's personally\nthe most\ncourageous thing that you've done\nrecently and it doesn't have to be huge\nright like that's the point i i think\ni'm i have easier time answering the the\nfirst one the second one but i have two\nyoung kids and so when you go through\nsomething like this pandemic what you're\nreally forced to grapple with and this\nis a big stoke concept is like just how\nmuch is out of your control\nright like uh\nyou care about these people this thing\nmore than anything in the world\nand\nyet you don't control it right\nit's they're running around they're\noutside and so i think one of the things\ni've really had to grapple with over the\nlast 18 months is anxiety worry right uh\na certain amount of powerlessness a\ncertain amount of frustration with just\nthat we're in this mess as a society or\nas a planet um and and and so i think\nyou know when we talk about uh parenting\ni don't think we talk about courage\nenough right so first off just to be a\nwoman who who brings a child into the\nworld is an insanely courageous thing to\ndo if you just think about like\ni mean look women die in childbirth all\nthe time and yet women get pregnant all\nthe time like i think we we've gotten so\nused to it or perhaps we just don't\nthink about what an insanely courageous\nact it is but then to be a parent in\nthis sort of crazy messed up world uh i\nthink about all the parents that i know\ni just try to think about all the\nparents in the world that have had to\nendure this you know insane disruptive\nlife event that has challenged us in so\nmany different ways\num it's been uh you know it's been it's\nbeen a journey and i think when we think\nabout what stoicism is or we think about\nwhat buddhism is or or or any of these\nphilosophical schools they were designed\nprecisely for these kinds of events like\nthe ancient world was you know people\ntalk about things going back to normal\nthis is normal this is what life was in\nthe ancient world this is what life was\nlike in our grandparents lives\nand we're just we were just really\nreally spoiled for a long time and now\nwe're having to wrestle with\nhey the world doesn't really care about\nyou or your plans and you're gonna have\nto figure out how to\naccommodate yourself to those things and\nmanage to be happy and productive and\nyou know not a wreck inside of them yeah\nand do you do you genuinely believe and\nof you know pandemic aside of course\nbecause\nthat it's a huge huge huge thing that\nobviously affected everyone on the\nplanet but do you generally believe that\na disruption of plans\nhas led to better plans results ideas\ninnovation inventions look uh no one\nwould say like hey in america you know\n750 000 people have died that this is a\nblessing in disguise right that would be\noffensive\nbut\nwe add on top of the tragedy by refusing\nto change or be changed by what's\nhappened right so i don't know about you\nbut\nthis was a\nenormous forced lifestyle experiment we\nhad to reimagine a lot of things we\nprobably wouldn't be doing this remotely\nuh you know if it weren't for the\npandemic you know there's things that\nyou're talking about those meditation\ngroups that you made there's things\nyou've created as a result of the\nconstraints\nof what was happening in the world that\nare on net positives for you and and\nthat's certainly been the case for me\nit's forced me to reimagine rework a lot\nof what i sort of took for granted\npreviously\num\ni i think coming out of the pandemic i'm\nnot going to travel nearly as much not\nfor safety reasons but just realizing oh\num\ni've been going a mile you know a mile a\nminute for 30 odd years of my life\nand\ni was aware of what i was getting out of\nit but i was less aware of what it was\ncosting me or\nwhat it was preventing me from doing and\nso i think\nit's not that the stoics would say that\neverything terrible has something\nwonderful inside of it but that\nby wrestling with what's happened by\nlooking for what we can do inside of\nwhat's happened we managed to\nexcavate little bits of positivity or\nopportunity for progress and that's\nwhat the obstacle is the way is really\nabout yeah beautiful and so we've talked\nabout\nfear we talked about courage the third\npart of the book is the heroic\nand and i find this\nand i love that it's obviously towards\nthe end but it's it's uh i found this\nfascinating because\ni think everything in society makes us\nwant to be a hero like the movies i\nwatched made me want to be like the guy\nin the movies the adverts would make me\nwant to be like the guy\nfor me or or you know for people the\ngirl or that person in in the ad in the\nmovie in the book in the story\nuh but but you know you define what it\nmeans to be a hero morally and\nphysically i want you to break that down\nfor us like how do you introduce this\nand how did the stoics think about this\nso if we think of courage as the triumph\nover fear i maybe what we're saying is\nthat heroic is something beyond even\nthat so uh in the book i'm talking about\nmichael jordan's decision to leave\nbasketball to play baseball that's an\nimmensely courageous thing because it's\nrisky people are critical of it he has\nno idea if he can go from being the best\nin the world at one sport to starting at\nthe bottom of another sport now that was\na courageous thing to do but i contrast\nthat with maya moore's decision equally\ndominant in the wnba to walk away from\nbasketball to free a man wrongly\nconvicted in prison right so she's not\njust doing something courageous she's\ndoing something heroic because the\nprimary beneficiary of what's happened\nis not her\nright so heroism to me or the heroic is\nwhen we do something courageous\nthat's\nwell beyond our self-interest or perhaps\nvery much at odds with our self-interest\nright when we talk about the courage to\nstart a business\nuh you know what we're talking about is\nis pushing past doubts or risk or\nwhatever but the what about the courage\nto leave a successful business to start\na non-profit right you're you're you're\nnot putting yourself in physical danger\nbut you're putting your interest behind\nthe interests of other people and that's\nin a very scary difficult thing to do\nand it's heroic because uh by by putting\nothers above us we're actually elevating\nall of us and so\ni wanted to look at at that because i'm\nreally really really inspired by that\nand that ultimately is what i think we\nneed more of in the world obviously we\nneed courageous entrepreneurs but we\nneed people who are willing to do\nsomething beyond just trying to make\nsomething for themselves yeah i deeply\nappreciate that definition thank you for\nsharing with us because to me\nthat that journey from courage to\nbeing heroic that that is that purpose\nthat service that that extension of\none's self for others and\nultimately i i can agree with you more i\ngenuinely believe that\npurpose you know i was saying i suppose\ni was speaking to a friend recently i\nwas saying how you know a dream without\nservice is incomplete like the idea is\nlike you know you can only build a dream\nso far with the desire for it to all be\nabout yourself and and then it it\ndoesn't even do it for you anymore and i\nfeel like but you've paved a really good\npath because also you can't just jump to\nbeing heroic because there are certain\nskills and muscles and and things that\nyou develop on the way by building\ncourage first like there are certain\ntools and and and tricks and tips and\nthings that you pick up along the way\nthat make it more powerful to be heroic\nafter well one of the things i was\ninspired by it's just something i ran in\na small news story many years ago was\nthe decision i think maybe 10 years ago\nthat cvs just decides they're going to\nstop selling cigarettes now this is bad\nfor cvs this is bad for the shareholders\nof cvs but it's obviously good for the\nworld right and as they find\noverall cigarette consumption goes down\nacross the entire country because people\nare just like it's harder to get\ncigarettes they just smoke less\nright and so\nlike obviously we we love ambition we\nlove creativity we love people who are\ntrying to be successful but but there is\nsomething beyond that i think we saw it\nduring the pandemic the people who\nshowed up every day for work even though\nit must have been scary and terrifying\nfor them but they knew that other people\nwere depending on them that where would\nwe be without those kind of people and\nso you know obviously the pandemic\nrevealed some selfishness and\nindifference and and uh all sorts of of\nawful parts of of our modern society but\nit also revealed that i think some of\nthe best of our society and and i wanted\nto celebrate this idea of of yes\npushing through fear is important but\nwhy are you doing it right who are you\ndoing it for\nthat really really matters yeah i think\nthat's beautiful man ryan this is uh\nbeen such a wonderful conversation i\nhighly recommend everyone if you haven't\nread ryan's work i mean i would go and\nbuy every single book and i'm not\nkidding they not only look beautiful but\nthey are beautiful and uh you know\nobstacle is the way is is just fantastic\nego is the enemy stillness is the key we\ntalked about last time i mean\nuh and this one courage is calling is\nwhat we've been talking about today ryan\nwe end every interview with the final\nfive you've done this before these are\nthe fast five so every question needs to\nbe answered in one word to one sentence\nmaximum you are the writer so you can\nhelp me define what one sentence counts\nas like how many words are in a cent in\na good sentence ryan i had as many or as\nfew as there should be\nokay all right great\nuh i love i love the vagueness of that\nokay brilliant all right so the first\nquestion for you is uh what is something\nyou once were attracted to\nbut has become less important to you i\nthink money certainly money i think\nmoney represented something to me\nearly in my life and the more you get of\nit\nthe more you realize that it really\ndoesn't mean anything\nand\nthere's less to do with it than you\nthink there is\nright and and did that come after a\ncertain amount of sense success did that\nwhere did where did you feel like what\nmade you feel that it doesn't have to be\na a statistical number i just mean like\nwhat was it that made you feel that way\ni don't know if there was a specific\nnumber but i remember i had a\nconversation with tim ferriss once and\nhe was like what do you do with your\nmoney you know he's like i was what do\nyou mean he's like he's like do you have\na speed boat you know do you invest it\nwhat do you know i was like it just goes\nin the bank right like i don't know and\nhe's like\nso it's not important to you really and\ni was like yeah i guess not you know he\nwas like his point was if you're if you\ndon't need the money just make sure that\nyou're not saying yes to things that you\ndon't really want to do to get more\nmoney if you don't really want the money\nand that was very helpful to me yeah i\nlove that okay uh question number two\nwhat is something you were first\nuninterested in that has now become\nsomething intriguing or a curiosity i\nmean i i think i always knew i wanted to\nhave kids but i didn't understand just\nhow much i would love it and how imp how\nmuch it would transform my life uh and\nso i would say uh you know sort of\nfamily\nbeing the the sort of big big thing uh\nespecially again during the pandemic\njust it was like oh this is all i really\ncare about uh this is all i'm gonna\nfocus on\nuh so so maybe family would be the big\nthing i love that all right question\nnumber three what's the\nuh\nmost used piece of stoic wisdom that you\nutilize on a daily or more regular basis\nthe first stoic exercise is this idea\nthat there's things that are up to us\nand things that are not up to us and\nreally all we should focus on is what's\nnot up is what is up to us\nand uh that's extremely hard to do and i\nscrewed up all the time but i find\nmyself constantly reminding myself it\ndoesn't matter\nno amount of thinking about this will\nchange it\njust focus on what you can do in\nresponse to it or you know inside of it\nuh that's probably i love that\nironically the most basic thing is the\nmost complex thing absolutely well i was\ngoing to ask you that as the next\nquestion what is a piece of stoic advice\nthat you think you're still wrestling or\ngrappling with that may be\ncounter-intuitive it may even be off the\nwall and you may be like okay this is\none of those things that you leave out\nthe book because it's just it just you\nknow and there's plenty of stuff with\nthat in the vedic tradition too like\nthere's some stuff that's just off the\nwall\nis there something like that from the\nthat you've been reading recently that i\nmean i think uh all of it to be\nperfectly honest all of it is on a\nday-to-day basis but there is a line in\nin the beginning of meditations mark\nsurrealist lists all these things that\nhe learned from his mentors and i think\nit's from sextus or severus\nsomeone early on in his life he said\nthat i learned how to be free of passion\nbut full of love\nand that doesn't that doesn't sound very\nstoic right um the idea of being full of\nlove the the being free of passion\nsounds very stoked but full of love\nsounds\nmore eastern\nand or or christian uh a little bit of\nboth and\ni i find that to be very beautiful and\nthe idea of being like okay i'm gonna\nstrip out some of the emotion i'm gonna\nstrip out some of the need to control uh\nblah blah blah blah but i'm gonna\nreplace it with like\nlove empathy kindness\nthat is harder for me to do but but\nsomething i'm working on i love that\nthat's that's beautiful answer okay\nfifth and final question\nwhat are your top favorite\ni don't mind how many numbers you three\nfour five books that you've read this\nyear so more recent or or that you've\nread this year it doesn't even have to\nbe a recent book uh dr edith inger wrote\nthis book called uh the choice she's a\nholocaust survivor i loved that book i\nit blew me away um then there's this\nother little book uh by victor frankl\nthat they found recently called yes to\nlife oh wow in spite of everything it's\nlike a collection of some of his lost\nlectures uh that i really really enjoyed\num\nand then i read this book it doesn't\nhave a great title um but it's it's sort\nof changed how i've been thinking about\nthings lately it's called indian givers\nand it's about what western society owes\nand has learned from indigenous peoples\nwow over the last like five six hundred\nyears um and it was an incredible book\nthat like it just didn't i just had no\nidea is isn't unfortunately uh what we\nteach in schools um and i i've just been\nthinking about that book so much i\nreally really liked it i love that\nbeautiful three that i haven't read so\nuh\nproducers amazon ordered those books for\nme right now i need\nuh and for everyone who's been listening\nand watching as you know i've
