well you know as we talked\nabout\num you know this is this is my art this\nis my photographer bob mattel's arts\nthis is justin tinsley who uh was a\nco-writer on this this is his art as\nwell\nand

thank you for saying\nthat yeah absolutely absolutely and i\ncan't wait for everyone who's listening\nand watching i highly recommend you go\nand grab a copy uh whether you're a\nbasketball fan or not there is so much\non and off the court in this book that\nyou're going to benefit so much from it\nso dwayne let's let's dive right in\nuh i want to start by asking you\nwhen you're compiling a book like this\nwhen you're looking at pictures\nold and new\nwhat is it doing for you emotionally\nlike tell me about not the physical\njourney of compiling but the emotional\njourney of putting a book together like\nthis for me\nlike going through these photos there's\nsome very personal photos\ninside this book you know this you know\nthis is me trying to show jay the human\nside of me you know as someone who's a\npublic figure\nsometimes the human side of you get lost\nand so what i wanted to capture is that\nthat that part of me and so\ni'm able to go into these photos and\nsome of them you know it showcased my\nchildhood you know whether showing up\nthe complex that i grew up in on 50\nknife and in prairie or whether it's\nshowing my kids or whatever it is i'm\nable to go right back into that moment\nand i'm able to kind of relive some of\nthose things\nand you know i love that i love going\nback and remembering little duane and\nthe promises that he made and the dreams\nthat he had i love going back and\nrevisiting it when you were capturing\nall these memories since the beginning\nof your career\ndid you ever have any idea that it was\ngoing to go this well and be this great\nand\nor like what was the process when\nbecause i always feel like\nyou know now everyone's lives are\ndocumented because of social media and\nvideo and content has become so easy and\ncheap and free\nbut you know when you started\ndocumenting it's like no one knew where\nthis was gonna go how where did you feel\nit was gonna go i had no clue and that's\nthe\nthat's the beauty of life as well is is\nthe unknown and so only thing i knew was\nbe a good person\nwork hard\ntreat others the way that you want to be\ntreated you want others to treat you\nknow your loved ones uh work hard work\nhard you know i just knew these small\nthese small things in life that i\ncarried with me and i tried to put that\nin everything i did and you know i think\nwill smith said it and i and i'm gonna\nmess it up but he said\nyou work hard every day and you get up\nevery day and you just work hard and you\nmess around and you end up having a good\nlife\nyou know because just every day you're\nchoosing to work hard and so\ni worked hard every day and i messed\naround and had a good life\nand a good career yeah a great a great\ncareer man a great career now you you\nmentioned in the book\ni i love this and i love even how you've\nstructured the book so for anyone who\nhasn't got the book yet\nthe book is structured\nin the same way a game is structured so\nyou've got pre-game first quarter second\nquarter half time third and fourth and\npost game which i love\ni love that sort of thought process and\ngetting into your mindset and your life\nin that way uh one of the most beautiful\nthings you mention is that in the book\nthat every tip-off\nyou always close your eyes\nbow your head and you talk to god and\nwhen i\nyou know when i when i read that i was\nthinking wow that is so special to be\ndoing that in a tip-off which is like\nyou know there's stress there's pressure\nthere's the fans there's you know\neverything's like quite heightened at\nthat point but you're able to close your\neyes bow your head and talk to god i\nwanted to ask you what do you say uh why\nhas that been an important routine for\nyou yeah jay\nit goes back to you know my childhood um\ni'm not\ni'm i look at myself as spiritual i\ndon't look at myself as as christian or\nyou know any other terms i look at\nmyself as a spiritual person\ni felt i've always had um a personal\nrelationship with the version of who i\nfeel my god is um since a very young age\nand i've always communicated very well\nwith him\nand he's a hymn to me could be a hurt of\nsomeone else\num and so i've never lost sight of that\nand and for for me growing up as a young\nkid\nwho who got a lot of things put in his\npath to try to stop him from getting to\nwhere i am now\num and knowing throughout throughout\nthat process my faith\nwas was so strong you know you know my\nword number three probably because of\nthe father the son the holy spirit\nand\nat that moment before a game i've done\nit since i've been since i started\nplaying basketball is i always take a\nmoment and just\nbe thankful i'm thankful for the places\nthat i'm allowed to go i'm thankful for\nthe places that my god has taken me i\nremember being\nlittle dwayne\ncrying\ngoing to bed with no food in my stomach\nyou know just crying trying you know\nasking god to to to allow me to be the\none to help get my family out of you\nknow poverty\nand to be in that situation to be on the\nnba court and to look around before\nevery game and see 20 000 fans see a\nlittle kid that's somewhere with your\njersey on just trying to get a glimpse\nin the moment like to understand that\nyou're one of the best players in this\ngame i'm thankful and so before every\ntip-off i just wanted to express how\nthankful i was uh to my god yeah that's\nbeautiful man i love that as a centering\nand guiding principle for each and every\none of us that even in that moment\nyou're able to have that stillness\ninternally to set that intention and you\nknow whatever it means to you i i\nappreciate that that it's\nyou making sense of what that word what\nthat feeling means to you it's not about\nany other external definition\nuh but about your own i wonder did you\never talk to your god after the game or\nduring the game\nthroughout the entire game\nall the time man all the time\ndo you ever remember a specific game or\na specific moment where your\nconversation with god was was\ninteresting or that we could dive into\nthat that moment\ni mean let's let's pick any let's pick\nlosing game two of the nba finals in\n2011\nup i think 15 points you know in the\nfourth quarter let's take that you like\ngod\nwhat's up\nyou know i mean like\nyou have conversations all the time but\nyou know ultimately um\nyou know for me it is it's just always\nbeen about like look look look where i\nam like\nyou know and i know and i think\nsometimes you know going through the\nprocess jay like you lose yourself a\nlittle bit you lose sight of like\nimportant you know principles important\nthings\nand\nand i was and i'm one of those people\nwho forgot you know at moments and then\nso when i would try to always bring\nmyself back to the moment even if we\nlost the finals even if someone hit a\ngame winner even if i played terrible i\nyou know you try not to question you try\nnot to ask why it's a part of the\njourney and so um i tried as much as\npossible to stay off guard get off his\ncase\ni loved them i love that\none of the things you talk a lot about\nin the book that comes through with the\nimages and pictures is you know the\nfoundation you had through coaching\nand the people you had in your life and\nyou say something beautiful you say as a\nprofessional athlete you have to trust a\nlot of people with your body\nand and i thought that this was\nfascinating because\nyou know as an athlete of course you\nhave trainers you have coaches and even\nin our lives we trust people with parts\nof ourselves whether it's our mind our\nbody our life our friendship how did you\nknow in the beginning or how did you\ndevelop an approach to finding out who\nyou could trust\nwith your body and your career versus\nthose you couldn't trust was there a way\nthat you sensed or started to learn and\nknow\nhow to make those choices and decisions\nyeah i think it's it's gut you know if\nyou don't have someone in your life that\ncan help you know put you with certain\npeople people and\num like big mentors throughout your life\nor a big or father figure who has\ncertain relationships and all these\nthings then a lot of it is going to be\non your gut feeling and so for me i've\nbeen one of the luckiest human beings in\nin my eyesight\nuh for\nfor the sense of having people put in\nhis life that have really made huge\nimpacts who have really been there for\nthe good and not for the bad\num and it just really helped me you know\nand and i'm not the i have not always\nbeen the most confident man in the world\nand to have all these individuals who\nhave been there to be able to give me\nthat nudge to be able to push me back up\num for me to have the common sense to\nallow them to do it is the reason that\nyou and i right now are on the number\none health podcast in the world\nbecause of it right so\num i'm very appreciative of everybody\nalong this journey that really\nnudge me and lift me up yeah no i love\nthat and i think that's so important i\nthink\ni what i love is then the book you talk\nso much about the coaches the mentors\nthe people who nudge you along the\nplayers that you work alongside there's\nthis brilliant picture of uh i believe\nit's with you and lebron james and\nyou're just saying that it was from a\nworkout where you both just went\nfull out on each other and just\nencouraged each other to just you know\nkeep pushing on and keep going on\ncan you walk us through\nthe hardest workout or the hardest\npregame that you ever did mentally or\nphysically could you just walk us\nthrough what it's really like because i\nalways feel as someone like i'm not an\nathlete i don't really know how hard\nthat is physically could you walk us\nthrough that\num i guess the the easiest way to say it\nis we all have\nuh we all reach a point in whatever\nwe're doing when we reach that boiling\npoint where we feel we have nothing else\nto give\nand as an athlete you reach that point\nconstantly\nand the hardest part is is pushing\nyourself and allowing others to push you\nto give more than you know that you have\nto give\nand it's so easy to quit on yourself\nit's so easy to say i have nothing left\nbut when you re when you go past that\nlevel and you go to you tap into another\nplace that you didn't think you had you\ndidn't know you had another 15 reps you\nthought you was maxed out at 10\nand you push yourself to there now\nyou've shown yourself that you have\nanother level and that another level\nhelps you in those moments right that\nanother level helps you in a fourth\nquarter when everyone's tired because\nyou know you've went to another level\nand so\njust man the whole training aspect of it\nlebron and i\nbeing two great players and being two\ngreat friends\npushing each other you know that photo\nwas\nright before game one of the 2013 nba\nfinals\nand we knew\nthat it was going to be on us to lead\nthis team\nand we knew we were about to be in a dog\nfight because we were playing the san\nantonio spurs and they were going to\ntest us physically and mentally and\nemotionally in all the fields and so\nthat was getting ourselves stilled and\nprepared for what this series was about\nto to hand us yeah that's that's amazing\ni love hearing that because\nyou're so right we always quit on\nourselves i mean i remember the closest\nthing i can compare is just when i lived\nas a monk\nyou know you'd always think that you'd\nmeditated enough or you'd pushed\nyourself and our teachers would push us\na little more a little more a little\nmore and then you get to a day where you\nmeditated for like eight hours and\nyou're like oh wow like i i didn't think\ni could do eight minutes if i was left\nto do it on my own and and you start to\nrealize the value of association the\nvalue of those minds around you that\nhelp you see more than yourself and that\nreally leads to\nyou know you said about tom crean you\nsaid he believed that i could be\nsomething more than just a basketball\nplayer\nand\nand when i hear that i'm like wow like\nwhen people around us see us becoming\nmore than we see for ourself\nwhat were some of the lessons you\nbelieve that he taught you off the court\nwhat were some of those and why was it\nso important for you to see yourself as\nmore than a basketball player\ni don't know why it was um i just know\nit just always has been and it always\nhas mattered\nfor me and i don't know the reason jay\nbut\nwhen tom crean came in my house and this\nis something that he probably did you\nknow this was his first year being a\nhead coach but this is something he'd\nprobably seen and and had done before\nbut when he came in my house and he\npresented me with a cap and gown at that\nmoment\nno one ever talked to me as a as an\ninner city kid about graduating college\ni i just started thinking about going to\ncollege it was not\nlike no like it's not a lot of people my\nfamily who have graduated college this\nis not a thing this is not something\nthat you just do\num so when he presented that to me at\nthat moment i started looking at him\ndifferently\nit wasn't just about what i can do for\nhim on a basketball floor he was talking\nabout my future he was talking about me\nactually building something bigger than\njust a basketball player and and that\ncontinued you know being in college and\nhaving a son at the age of 19 years old\nyou know i he he became a huge figure in\nmy life as a father\nas an example uh and and just a shoulder\nto cry on and lean on you know and so\num\nrole models mentors uh obviously father\nfigures and these people are so\nimportant um you know along this journey\nof life for so many little kids and i\nknow so many little kids like dwyane\nwade that's growing up in broken homes\nand um\nyou know in private in in poverty um\nwith not a lot of resources not a lot of\nopportunities they need something they\nneed someone and to be able to have\nthose individuals in my life is the only\nreason once again that i'm i'm able to\nsit up here and even have a voice or a\nmicrophone to even talk about it yeah\nwhen you look at that time when and\nyou've referenced in this interview and\nof course in the book like you know\ngrowing up in poverty growing up with\nvery little opportunities or resources\nnot having those\noptions what what was the first time\nyou felt that there could be more that\nyou could do something with your life\nwhat was it who was it that right in\nthat very moment in that beginning when\nyou were in that pain and in that\nstruggle that made that feel possible\nyou know what jay i i've always felt it\nlike i i didn't know what it was but\ni've always i just never felt like i've\ni don't want to say that i fit in\ni just always felt that i thought\ndifferently and i looked at things\ndifferently\nthat's it you know like even the game of\nbasketball how as a young kid how i was\nable to read the game\nand knew that the ball is either going\ninside or was going along the perimeter\nokay that's it the game is easy like\nright like\ni just i just you know it's just a it's\na part of of god's you know uh and my\nparents\nyou know to getting together to be able\nto create create this right and so\ni always had that looking around like\nthis is not it\nthis will not be it for me like even now\ni'm\ni love life and my family and everything\nwe're accomplishing i still look around\nand i'm like this is for now\nthis is not it it's it's it's more it's\nmore living to do it's more life\nand\ni just didn't know how to get it done\nthen i just know how to get it done now\nbecause i've been through it all yeah\nyeah absolutely and and again what you\njust said is\nit's that perfect balance between being\npresent\nnow in what there is but recognizing\nthere's more\nand and being open to that right it's\nlike when i hear you speak and when i'm\nlooking at your book\nthere's deep presence like when you go\nback to these memories in the book like\nyou're fully absorbed and immersed like\nwe're there with you you do that\nbeautifully but at the same time you\nhave this expansive vision that there's\nmore there's more to do more to achieve\nmore to grow more to learn\nand and i feel like that balance is\nreally rare you don't you know people\nare either in the future or they're in\nthe present but being able to go between\nthe two\nis is a really powerful skill and\nknowing that you know you've been able\nto spot those patterns and see that from\nthe beginning\nyeah what do you think was one of the\nbest\ndecisions you ever made\nin your personal life or professional\nlife that made a huge impact or decision\nin your\noverall life\nwell i\ni think going back to the last point and\nthis point i wanted to make was\nthe\nthe ability to be able to\nappreciate the past\nenjoy and really focus and live in the\nnow\nand not be satisfied with that and\nbe able to visualize and look towards\nthe future and having all three of those\nmy mind is always moving and i'm going\nfrom i'm going back here and i'm coming\nhere and then i'm going there right\nand\nto be i thank god and i thank everybody\nfor\nthe ability to have openness\nlike to be open\nif you're open in this world you will\nhave experiences that you never could\nhave imagined\nbut if you're closed-minded um you know\nyou're gonna live in a box\nand i just never wanted to live in a box\nand so my decision\nwas to be open\nto don't to my first initial reaction is\nout of fear and is out of something that\ni don't i've never experienced before or\ni i may not have a lot of knowledge on\nso i'm immediately going to be fearful\nand say no\ni don't want to do it because it's\nuncomfortable who wants to look stupid\nwho wants to be wrong\nbut\nsomewhere somehow along this journey\nsomeone gave me a smack me on the head\nand said here take this open openness\nand go off and live\nlife i love that i love that man and and\ni i hope everyone who's listening and\nwatching right now\nfeels that they're getting that openness\nthrown at them through dwayne as well of\nlike you know just just being more open\nto it and one of one of the things\nthough that\nanother i i was you know what i love\nthis juxtaposition between images and\nwords like to me all the art in my house\nas well it's images and words like i\nfeel like\na lot of people just like to look at\npictures and images a lot of people\nobviously fascinated by words and lyrics\nto me when i see this book i love it\nbecause it's it's\nit's both together and there's this\nbeautiful statement that you make that\npatience is always the hardest virtue to\nlearn we always hear patience as a\nvirtue but you go and say patience was\nthe hardest virtue to learn and i was\nlike what made you realize that like\nwhere did where was patience\nhard to learn in your life\nin every aspect\nlike sitting in traffic it's hard to\nhave patience\nyou know i live in la now it is hard to\nhave patience in traffic right like\nthat's\nbut i think\nwe\nespecially now in 2021 we are uh\nwe are a world that we want to get there\nwe want to we want to we want everything\nlike this when we get in our car we want\nto get at our destination right away\nwe don't we don't enjoy the journey\nwe're not enjoying the journey no more\nand it's like even like with our phones\nyou know we could be in a car and it's\nour driving your head is down the entire\ntime and you've missed\nso much\nabout the world\nyou know what i mean that we're just not\nlooking up anymore\nand so\nto me just having patience and even some\nwhen i get in the car i'm like it's an\nhour drive cool let me enjoy this hour\nlet me get my music right let me get my\npodcast right let me put my top down and\nsee this see the mountains and see the\nsun or whatever it is right\nwe want to get to things right away and\nwe don't want to have patience and let\nthings happen\nthe way that they supposed to happen\nwhat was the hardest thing in your life\nto be patient about like with your\nachievement in basketball like what was\nthe thing you were most impatient about\nif there was something you were really\nimpatient about and that you had to\nrealize you had to slow down and work\ntowards what was that achievement in\nbasketball\ni wanted it right away like when i was\nin school i wanted to be known i wanted\nto have scholarship offers\ni wanted i wanted praise through man\nlike i wanted that i needed it i felt\nand\nthat was something that now that my it\ndidn't happen for me that way my journey\nwas a little slower and now i look at my\njourney and i'm like man that journey\nbuilt character\nand without that journey i don't have\nthis pers this you know i i'm not able\nto look at it from this perspective\nand this perspective makes me appreciate\nyou know everything and so i have this\nsame conversation jay with my son who's\ngoing through his own journey and he\nwants it now he wants to be\na superstar now he wants to you know he\nwants everybody to like the way he\nplayed now and it's like yo\nhave patience\nappreciate the journey because you this\nis creating a story you're creating your\nown legacy right you have a we're all\nborn with a blank canvas\nand we're able to go out and and and\nfind the paint and we're able to paint\nour own paint your own story don't let\nno one else paint on your canvas it's\nyours it's blank paint it the way that\nyou see fit and so\nyou know that's just that's just how i\napproach it i don't know if that makes\nsense it makes a lot of sense how i roll\ni mean i was about to say that is such\nbeautiful advice for a young man\ncongratulations to him by the way uh on\nthe recent news but like for you know\nto hear that from your father i think is\nso powerful and i'm sure that if there's\nany mothers or fathers listening right\nnow or anyone listening right now\nhearing that from you is massively\nempowering right because\ni feel we you're spot on we're living in\nthat culture driving social media\ntechnology nfts i mean anything everyone\njust wants it now crypto like whatever\nit is the six-pack abs the incredible\nbody whatever that means like you know\nwe all want it right now how is your\nrelationship dwayne do you think how did\nyour relationship with praise\nand fame and validation\nchange over time i'm always intrigued as\nto\nyou know\nhow did your relationship evolve\nwith fans with\ncriticism with\nuh good games bad games like how has\nyour relationship with praise and\nvalidation evolved or changed over time\ni feel that\nthe more my life has\ngotten to a place where it feels more\ncomplete in a sense that my mom's in my\nlife she's healthy we have a great\nrelationship my dad's in my life he's\nyou know he's healthy we have a great\nrelationship i have a great relationship\nwith my wife i'm i have great\nrelationships with my kids and i'm\nbuilding better relationships with with\nmy with my kids as well\nand so the closest i the closer i've got\nto the things that i've always wanted\nand needed\num\nyou know i've gotten\nbetter about what people say about me or\nwhat or the perception of who i supposed\nto be or\nbut when i was younger i needed that\nlike i i like i said i wanted praise\nthrough man like i i needed attention i\ni wanted to be famous i wanted to have\nmy jerseys been a number one selling\njersey like\nthe insecure little boy in me needed\nthat from others you know i mean and\nthen i got to the point as things\nstarted becoming uh better in love and\ntheir family and friends and i started\nfeeling more whole i stopped needing\nthat i stopped caring about it and so i\nunderstand the journey of a young kid of\nmine like my son who's 19 who can read\n33 comments under his photo and feels\nlike the world is coming down on them i\nunderstand it but the same time i'm 39\nand i'm able to look back and say that's\nnot going to matter\nyou know i mean what matters is you what\nmatters is what is what you put into\nwhat it is that your dreams is and what\nyou want to do yeah well said man really\nreally beautifully said i\nyou know i i often feel the same way\nthat\nwhen you know that the people and it's\nwhat we started with when i was sharing\nwith you the intention at the beginning\nit's that you realize that ultimately\nthe only opinions that matter are the\npeople that deeply know you\nlike most people don't know you deeply\nand now you're giving us an opportunity\nto get to know you deeply through your\nuh through this beautiful book a memoir\nbut\nit's the people that know you truly and\ndeeply at the heart they're they're the\nones that matter and you can't take\nsomeone who's\nuh you know behind a keyboard seriously\nbecause you don't really know who they\nare and they don't know who you are but\nwe do outsource our validation and our\nself-assurance and our self-esteem to to\neveryone else and i love hearing that\nyou know i i wonder how does your son\nreact but be honest with you how does he\nreact to that does he go\nhow does he hear that does he go oh dad\nit's all right for you because you're so\nsuccessful or\nhow does he respond to that i'm\nintrigued\nyou know he receives it you know the one\nthing i love about zaire is he receives\nthings and\nhe decides how you know he wants to um\npursue pursue things from from there but\nhe receives the things i say but the\nsame time he also understands that you\nknow what dad you've never been zaire\nwade\nyou know what i mean you've never really\nlived this lifestyle that i've lived no\none is really that we know in our family\nno one has lived desire away life you\nknow i come i know what it's like to be\ncome from nothing with no expectations\nbut i don't know what it's like to come\nfrom something with expectations yeah\nand so\ni get it and so i i don't i don't say\nthese things to my son like hey this is\nthis is how it's supposed to be and this\nis how it's gonna this is just me\ncommunicating with him and past trying\nto pass down the knowledge that i know\nbut i also understand his journey and\ni'm able to you know i'm able to listen\ni'm able to be you know have empathy\ntowards what he what he goes through but\nat the same time i know that ultimately\nthat's not ultimately going to matter in\na sense of you know where you trying to\nget in your future you know yeah and so\ni just don't want him to ever\nuse use things as excuses and that's and\nthat's what i've always fought against i\ncould have used my mom as an excuse um\ngoing to prison when i was nine years\nold i could have used not getting an act\nscore to go to college as an excuse\nbut\nif i if i allow those things to uh to be\nexcuses um then i'm i'm i'm allowing\nmyself to be defeated um you know and\nand and it's like we already are behind\neight ball life is already hard enough i\ncannot allow those things to to happen\nif i want to be successful and so i'm\njust trying to show him that and and\nunderstand that it's going to take him\nin his own time to really understand it\nin that way i love that you and you and\nuh your wife obviously are trying to\nhave such healthy relationships with\nyour kids as you just said there when\nyou know when you go through this\nexperience with your parents but now you\nhave good relationships with them how\ndid you\nre reconstruct those relationships as\ntime has gone on you said one of the\nhappiest things is you have a good\nrelationship with your mom she's healthy\nfather healthy\nwhat was it that helped you rebuild\nthose relationships in healthy ways\nbased on the\ndifficult childhood you'd had well\ngrowth\nhaving kids\nrealizing your parents are not that\ncrazy\num but outside of that\ngetting to know them i really\nyou don't when you're a kid you really\ndon't know your parents\nyou know these rule setters you know you\nknow people who take care of you and say\nno yes you know whatever you don't know\nyour parents and so what i've been\ntrying to do and what i'm what i just\ngot done doing yes this weekend we just\ncame from utah is\ni'm getting to know my parents and i'm\ngetting to know each one individually\nand i'm also getting to know them around\neach other and and they've been knowing\neach other since my dad was like 15 16\nyears old and so they know so much about\neach other so what i'm doing is i'm\nlearning them and as i learn them i have\na better appreciation of jolinda and\nduane\nand not just mom and dad i think that's\nsuch uh beautiful advice for everyone i\nthink as you just said uh there's a\nthere's a famous quote i can't remember\nwho it's from but there's a beautiful\nstatement that says uh\nthe day you realize your parents were\nright your kids are telling you that\nyou're wrong\nyou know it's that it's that kind of\nfeeling like and what you just said like\nthat's exactly it like and i'm not a\nfather yet\nuh but i often think about that and and\nyou're so right that\nwe never get to know our parents that's\nsuch a\ndeep and powerful statement because we\nexpect that their job is to get to know\nus and their job is to help us and their\njob is to make our lives good but most\nour parents have never been asked how\nare you how are you doing like what do\nyou care about what's you know what's\nbeen happening in your life uh so i i\nreally i really appreciate that i hope\nthat after this\nuh podcast a lot of people go off and\nmake those calls ask those questions the\nholidays are coming up like you know\nthis is a great time to\nto start reconstructing a lot of those\nyou know wounded relationships or or\npainful places\num you know you mentioned in the book\ndwayne\nyou said i try to tell everyone how much\nthey mean to me\nwhile they're still here\nbecause i know one day they won't be\nand that is such a brilliant way to live\nwas there someone that you recently did\nthat with or texted or called or or had\nthat moment where that\nyou really were trying to embody that i\ndo it all the time jay um you know i\njust got off my book tour and\nyou know my chief of staff simone capers\nhe's 27 years old\nand she's\nif she she did she she handled the book\nto us so gracefully you know this was\nher first time\nhandling this and she just handled it\nshe handled it so gracefully and i had\nto to acknowledge it i had to let her\nknow\num and you know i really\ni really try to embody that my wife and\ni really try to embody it i think if you\nif you ask anyone that's in our inner\ncircle that's in our friend and family\ngroup they will tell you\nwe are we don't like to eat alone we\ndon't like to celebrate alone um\nyou know we want to make sure that we\nall\nare experiencing life uh because it's we\nall are experiencing some me and my wife\nare we're experiencing something that\nyou know\nmost of our family and friends haven't\nwe're going places that most people\nhaven't and it's on us\nto make sure we show them it's on us to\nmake sure we move the curtains and move\nthe buildings and move the trees out the\nway to make sure that our friends and\nfamily who have not been to places that\nwe've been\nthat they get a chance to see it you\nknow and so i'm all about\ncreating moments creating memories\nbecause at the end of the day when it's\nall said and done\nwhen someone that you lose that's so\nclose to you when they're gone all you\nhave is those memories that they left\nyou and those are the stories that\nyou're gonna tell and so we all are\nabout creating memories together and\nthat's that's how we roll did you did\nyou ever not live that way and regret\nthat was there anyone that you wish you\ngot to deal with that way or or do you\nfeel like you've been like that the\nwhole time have you always just felt\nthat you've tried to live that way or\nwas there someone that kind of like\nsnuck through the cracks\nyeah i wasn't always open-minded um you\nknow i didn't have a great relationship\nwith my\nmy mom my dad's mom or my dad's father\nand it didn't i didn't really affect me\nwhen i was younger because it was just\nit was what it was and i really didn't\ncare to have it\nand then\nthey both passed away within you know i\nthink a year and a half of each other\nand i and i remember crying i remember\ndriving in my car when i got the news\nand i remember just crying and i never\nfelt any emotion towards my grandparents\nbecause i didn't grow up in a\nrelationship with them and at that\nmoment i felt\ni felt bad because i felt like you know\nwhat dude you could have been the bigger\nperson you could have\nyou never took time to understand to\nunder to sit down with them and ask\nquestions and understand why their\nrelationship was the way it was anyway\nyou know better and so\ni think after that i kind of woke up a\nlittle bit and i kind of\ni started trying to put beef in certain\nthings to the side\nit views someone in my life that's gonna\naffect my emotions and my mood you're\ngonna make me cry\nand so it became important to me around\naround that time yeah no that's that's\nreally special thank you for opening up\nand sharing that too because\ni think often you know we always hear\nthe side of like yeah remember people\nbut we always forget that there are\npeople in our life that we didn't think\nlike that then we didn't have that\nmindset then and you know we missed out\non that so that's always a beautiful\nthing to hear one of one of the things\nthat you've done a lot dwayne which is\nreally admirable i i do believe it is\nbecause it shows a sense of of risk a\nsense of confidence a sense of integrity\nuh\nyou know we're all aware of the police\nbrutality that's been happening in you\nknow black communities for for\nfor far too long\nuh and for you speaking up about this\ntopic supporting conversations around it\ntrying to make change using your\nplatform for that purpose has been an\nimportant part of your work\nuh and and you say that you know what's\nthe point of having a platform if we're\nnot using it for this can you walk me\nthrough\nwhat that experience has been like from\ngoing from\nuh a young black man growing up in an\ninner city like having that pain and\npressure yourself to now being obviously\na powerful influential individual tell\nme about how it feels different and\nwhat's changed if anything\nyou know what i was just talking about\nthis the other day and i hope this\nanalogy makes sense too\nto all your listeners\nsometimes and i'll talk to my son about\nthis thing called um imposter syndrome\nright sometimes i feel like i'm\nlike i'm an imposter like\ni feel like i'm i feel like i'm that kid\nthat snuck behind a tall kid you know to\nand no one has caught me\nand like i'm and it's like no one has\nseen like no one is like saying hey kid\nget back here you're going too far and i\nfeel like people are just still letting\nme go right and i'm like it's a reason\nthat\nthese opportunities that i've been that\ni've that i have it's a reason for them\nit's not just because i'm talented\nas a basketball player\ni've seen a lot of talented basketball\nplayers not have the\ntheir microphone that even people will\neven listen\nit doesn't matter about that so\ni think i understand that my purpose is\nbigger and whatever it is um whatever is\non my heart whatever my experiences are\ni'm going to speak out on them\nthat's the world we live in it's called\nfreedom of speech where i'm going to\nspeak out on them and then at the same\ntime to be in a position where you have\nresources you know where you have\nconnections uh what you have finances\nwhere you have when you have all these\nthings and then you can get a little bit\nmore into it and not just be a voice now\nyou can be an active participant in the\nchange and so that's what i've tried to\ndo in my ways family foundation\nwade's royal foundation before that\nthat's what carmelo anthony chris paul\nand i are trying to do in our social\nchange fund um is we we're trying to\nmake sure that you know we be active in\nthe change that's that's happening in\nour community what what have been some\nof the changes dwayne could you walk us\nthrough that and i know you're a very\nhumble individual so you're not going to\ngo off and talk about all the massive\nchange you've made and you know but i'd\nlove to hear about some of the work that\nyou're doing that you feel is really\nhaving an impact in the communities and\nthe lives of young young people in those\ncommunities because i think it's so\nfascinating people to realize like you\nsaid it's not just about a voice it's\nnot just about social media it's about\nactual change in these\nuh in these cities could you could you\nwalk us through some of that stuff\nyeah you know without going into oh wait\nwe i we've done this and we've done this\ni think the best the best thing that\nthat i know that i can do and and mellow\nand cp has the same mindset\nis\ni have about nine jobs j i and i'm a\nfather of a lot of kids and i'm a\nhusband and\nall these things\ni understand where my strengths are and\nmy weaknesses understand what my\nlimitations are\nbut i also understand that i have a\npassion and we have a passion for our\ncommunity and so it's people that's out\nthere on the ground that's actually\ndoing the real work and what i've tried\nto do what i've tried to do throughout\nmy entire um charitable efforts is\nsupport the people who are doing the\nwork the programs that are doing the\nwork the individuals that are on the\nground going to jail for this boots on\nthe ground in the community uh those are\nthe people we want to support those are\nthe people that's why the social change\nthat's one of the reasons the social\nchange fund was formed that's one of the\nreasons why the wazeworth foundation was\nformed it wasn't for me to get any\nacknowledgement it was for us to be able\nto raise enough money to be able to pull\nour resources together to give back to\nthe people in the community that's doing\nthe actual work yeah no and i knew that\ni just wanted to hear more because i i\ngenuinely\njust i genuinely admire that work so\nmuch\nand and hearing you speak about it you\nknow is is really impactful for a lot of\nindividuals because i think sometimes\nyou know it's like what you're saying\nabout being more than a basketball\nplayer like you and today i'm not\nfocusing on the basketball because i\nthink\ni i love seeing everything else that\nyou've done by building this incredible\nempire and this incredible impact and\nthe heart that you do it with and i want\nto understand how your experience has\nbeen so far being a business person and\nhaving ownership of the utah jazz as\nwell like that's a whole nother part of\nyou as well what's the biggest thing\nyou've learned so far\nfrom that shift are there are there\ncertain things that you're using from\nthe sport in the business or are you\nlearning completely new skills\nthey say if it ain't broke don't fix it\nand so\nyou know and i talk about this in my\nbook a lot too right i feel that you\nknow\nthe sport that i played basketball is a\nis so many lessons in there that are\nmetaphors for life that are life\nexperiences\nand so\nif if i can be successful in\na sport that is very hard to be to crack\nif i could be one of the\none of the players to get drafted out of\n450 i could be one of the greatest\nplayers of all time\nthen i know what it takes to be\nsuccessful i've already cracked that\ncode and so don't reinvent it just take\nthe lessons that you've learned along\nthis journey and apply them\nto your to this life and that's what\ni've tried to do and so for me\njay if my jumper was off if i didn't\nknow how to dribble if i wanted to to\nlearn to move i would go out or i want\nto get stronger i'm gonna go out and\nhire a trainer i'm gonna go out and hire\nsomebody to help me right fix that or\nwork on this\nso i'm gonna do the same thing in this\nlife i'm gonna come out here and i'm\ngonna think okay what is my trainer\ntherapist trainer vocal coach trainer\nall these different people are trainers\nto help me become a bet the best version\nof me same way i would have done on the\nbasketball floor and that's how i've\ndecided to approach\nyeah the pregame of business and you\nknow being duane\nyeah no i love that what a great mindset\nand i love the analogy with the trainer\nthat's such a such a brilliant way of\nthinking about it uh dwayne i have to\nask you this because you know you have a\nwhole section here that in the book\nthat's um dedicated to kobe bryant uh we\nwere i was fortunate enough to interview\nhim on the podcast\nuh you always said how much of a fan you\nwere how much you admired him you had a\nbeautiful brotherhood with him uh what\nwas\nwhat was the biggest thing that you feel\nyou took away or learned from kobe\nconsciously or unconsciously that you\nfelt impacted you deeply till this day\nyou know what i think\nthe the basketball side of it is\nwatching someone who was has a god\ngifted ability like\ngod blessed kobe bryant\nwith so much ability but to be able to\nwatch him\nwork that ability yes like\nthat right there i've seen a lot of\npeople who has been gifted with just\ntalent\nand they don't do anything with it from\nthe standpoint of working their talents\nand so to watch him as an athlete\nreally get the best out of all his\ngod-given ability i mean that's\ninspiring but for me\nwatching kobe bryant retire\nwas probably the most impactful part of\nthe whole journey that's for me\nit hurt as having he was a leader like i\nretired after him and i'm like okay\ni'm gonna follow kobe like i'm gonna see\nwhat he's doing it\nand we all like to have those people to\nchase\nand so he was that person that we can\nlook at and say you can you can retire\ndifferently you can do this differently\nyou want to oscar\nwell i think one or two years after\nretirement like the things that he was a\npart of the books that he was writing\nthe the universe he was taking us in i\nmean the body armor of it all\nit was amazing and so what i learned\nfrom him is that it is uh\nanother way to do it it is greatness\nafter basketball\nand you do not have to wait on it yeah\nabsolutely i think you know and i see\nthat\nyou know i remember when i when i\ninterviewed him i remember he was so\nsatisfied and\npeaceful and blessed in your words in\nretirement there wasn't uh you know\nthere wasn't this feeling and i feel\nsimilar to talking to you today like\nyou're joyful in retirement you're\nexcited you're passionate like you know\nthere's there's not a\nloss of that from the loss of a part of\nyour the biggest identity that you've\nplayed in your life where is that come\nfrom for you where is that\nuh starting from for you i see you today\nlike you know we're laughing there's\npassion there's drive there's ambition\nthere's great parenting there's all\nthese things that you're inspired by and\ngrowing for and that shows me that even\nthough you've\nlet go of the longest part of your\ncareer identity\nthere's an identity beyond that\nman that was thank you for that um\ni i you know what my wife makes fun of\nme all the time she says that i every\nmorning i flee out of bed i'm talking\nabout\ncovers back go\nand\nand my wife is like i don't understand\nit why are you so happy in the morning\nand i'm like\nbecause every every day i wake up\ni get to create something\ni get to imagine something\ni get to inspire someone\nlike i'm a i'm i'm a little black kid\nfrom in the city of chicago\nand that just got me i just got a little\nemotional\nlike i'm a black kid from in the city of\nchicago that that no one's seen no one\ngave a chance to\nand to be able to have that opportunity\nevery day when i wake up\nit's it's everything jesus christ that\nright there is crazy\nyou know it's it's important it's\nbeautiful it it comes through in the\nbook it comes to even more when i'm\nspeaking to you today i've been watching\nall your other interviews and i love\nseeing someone who just is\nyou know sharing their blessing with so\nmuch grace and so it's really powerful\ndwayne it's\nsomeone get him a tissue on that side i\nwould give you one if we were in person\nman uh\nsomething that hit me i don't even know\ni don't even i don't think i've ever\nteared up on uh like besides winning a\nchampionship or tv or on you know on any\nplatform like this like it was that's\nreal you know i don't i don't i don't\nknow how\nyou know people don't get a chance to\ntalk to a lot of little black kids in\nthe city of chicago\nthey don't get a voice you don't get to\nhear their stories you know you get to\nhear a little bit of oh it's gaining\nfaster drug infested\nwhatever the case may be you don't get\nto really hear their stories man and\nit's not lost on me\nthat i was that kid i can clearly\nremember\nlittle dwayne i can clearly remember and\nso\nman i'm just thankful bro i'm
