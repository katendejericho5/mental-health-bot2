just\ncame together and and sat and empathized\nand fought deeply about these issues and\nand got through some of these kind of\nmore kind of primal\naspects that we haven't quite evolved\nout of yet we could achieve such a\nwonderful thing and we could create such\na great world but unfortunately we're\nnowhere near that yet\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\ni am so grateful that

so\ngood to meet you it's a delight to be\nhere and i really appreciate you making\ntime for me and it's a real privilege so\nthank you no the feeling is very mutual\ni've been a fan of what you've been\ndoing like i said to you before i came\nacross your videos i think probably 2017\n2018 and i'd only started my journey in\n2016 as well yeah and so i remember\nseeing it and under your instagram\nearthling ed which again highly\nrecommend everyone goes and follows and\nwhat i really appreciated was this\nvery thoughtful\nconscious\nintentional\nsharing and messaging around veganism\naround vegan diet around an\nunderstanding of animal welfare around\neducating people and up until that point\ni'd only ever seen people attack people\nor i'd seen people try and scare people\nor i'd seen people try and\ncause fear and i'm not saying any of\nthose things are bad or wrong or\nshouldn't be done everyone's allowed to\ncommunicate in the way that they feel is\nbest\nbut i really connected to your way of\ngiving a language to the work that you\ndo\nand so\nmy wife and i are big fans she's dying\nto meet you uh and\nnow that you're releasing a book as well\nwhich you kindly sent to me so i've had\nthe fortune of\nyou know seeing a bit of it what i want\nto start with is\ni want to hear about your story of how\nyou got to this point because i think\nwhat we're used to seeing is you\ndebating you being a very strong-minded\nvegan but i want to hear how you got\nthere so can you tell us\nwhere your journey started by telling us\nwhere you grew up what you ate for\ndinner every day what your life was like\nyeah so like most people i grew up in a\nfamily that uh hadn't really even heard\nof veganism\nso i i was raised and we used to laugh\nabout people who were vegetarian we used\nto think it was kind of a bit of a joke\nthat people wouldn't want to eat meat\nbecause you know meat's delicious and\neveryone eats meat so why wouldn't you\num and i remember we just have this joke\naround the family dinner table and it\nwas a very bad joke a very bad joke and\nit's cringy but we used to sit around\nthe dinner table we'll be eating you\nknow a beef casserole we'll be eating\nsausages chicken breasts whatever it\nmight be\nand someone would say something like\nwhat's the best thing about having a\nvegetarian around for dinner and then\nthe other person would go more meat for\nall of us right yeah exactly it's just\nlike so cringe but that's the kind of\nmindset we had and it wasn't that we\nwere against people being vegetarian we\njust thought it was a strange thing so i\nwas raised in a very much meat-dominated\nhousehold we had meat every single day i\nhad cheese most days eggs and i really\nliked it as well\nand this kind of continued throughout\nmost of my life until i came to\nuniversity and all of a sudden i was\nwith a group of people who were\nvegetarians and it became very\nnormalized for me and i started to think\nabout my relationship with animals where\ndid you go to university university of\nwestminster so i was born in a place\ncalled york which is northern england\nand then i moved to london to study when\ni was when i was 18. so i got to\nuniversity kind of outside of that\nfamily dynamic starting to think a\nlittle bit more independently started to\nhave some vegetarian friends and started\nto think about my relationship with\nanimals a little bit more i always\nconsidered myself to be you know someone\nwho cared about animals i mean we all do\nbecause intrinsically we have this you\nknow very deep compassionate side to us\nwhich sees the other life forms that we\nshare this planet with as being\ni think you know very much kind of like\na sacred um\nrelationship you know some you know\nthese are beings who we share so much\nwith and you know every action that we\npartake in influences them in the way\nthat they live in the wildlife or indeed\nin our homes with the pets that we have\nso i started to think a little bit more\ndeeply\nand then in may 2014 i was reading the\nbbc\nand i came across this story and it\nreally changed my life forever the story\nwas about this truck carrying around six\nand a half thousand chickens and the\ntruck had crashed while i was going to a\nslaughterhouse near the city of\nmanchester which is again in northern\nengland\nand i was reading this story and some\nsomething made me click on this story to\nbegin with and i was reading this story\nand i was thinking this is a terrible\nthing the journalist was saying that\nhundreds of the birds you know had died\nfrom the crash hundreds more were\nsuffering that word suffering became\nreally important to me because i\nrecognized that the animals who you know\ni consumed had the capacity to suffer\nit's a really strange thing to recognize\nbecause it's obvious we all know that\ncows pick you know pigs chickens lambs\neven the marine life that we consume we\nknow that they suffer but i never really\nthought about it consciously\nbut the problem was in my fridge was a\nkfc and i was a huge kfc fan back when i\nwas uh younger i used to go to my local\nkfc outlet you know a couple of times a\nweek it was something that was very\nimportant to my identity i was proud of\nmy kfc consumption i identified as being\nsomeone who who did this it was almost\nlike this bi-weekly pilgrimage almost\nyou know it really formed a huge part of\nmy life my my girlfriend and i we would\nalways get kfc watch a film it was part\nof our relationship\nbut i had kfc in my fridge at that time\nwhere i was reading this story\nand i remember just thinking about it\nand thinking well am i being\nhypocritical here you know my actions\nnot in alignment with my values am i in\na bit of a step cognitive dissonance\nwhere i say one thing you know i care\nabout animals i'm against animal\nsuffering yet for this recognition of\nwhat these chickens are enduring and the\nrealization that they're going to a\nslaughterhouse you know where they were\nmeant to end up is not much better\nreally potentially even worse than where\nthey were on the side of the road of\ncourse\nso i went vegetarian at that point\nbecause i kind of faced this fork in the\nroad and it was you know maybe i could\nbury my head in the sand just kind of\nget on with it you know pretend that i'm\nnot uncomfortable about this or i can\naccept that there's something here that\nhas compelled me to want to make a\nchange in my life so i went vegetarian\nand then eight months later i became\nvegan and now i went vegan because of a\ndocumentary called earthlings but really\nmy my girlfriend pushed me to do it now\ni'm a little bit you know a little bit\ncynical at times i can be a little bit\num i don't know the word is a little bit\nstoic you know maybe sometimes i don't\nwant to accept change in my life but\nshe's she's quite the opposite she's\nvery open-minded to things like theo\nthankfully speaking so she says ed you\nknow we should watch this documentary\ncalled earthlings you know it's about\nwhy we should be vegan and i said\nveganism really\nme\nno no vegetarians fine i can do that but\nveganism is a bit extreme you know these\npeople you know they're very forceful\nthey're a bit militant they're very\npreachy and i don't want to be one of\nthose vegans and she said no she used to\nwatch it so i put it off and put it off\nand put it off and then one morning we\nwoke up and i'm a little bit lazy on the\nmornings it takes me a little bit a\nlittle bit of a while to get out of bed\nand my girlfriend knows this very well\nof course so she took advantage of it\nshe gets the laptop she puts the\ndocumentary on and she says look ed you\ncan get out of bed or you can stay and\nwatch the documentary i don't know\nthat's a hard bargain\nso i watched it\n90 minutes later\ni was you know kind of shell-shocked\nreally\nthe the documentary is not pleasant it\nisn't it's it's objective about what\nhappens to animals it's all based in the\nu.s but it's objective about what\nhappens to animals in farms and\nslaughter houses and other places as\nwell where we do the things we do to\nthem sadly um and i had a little pet\nhamster at the time called rupert's and\nhe was just the most adorable hamster\never i'd never had pets growing up\nreally so rupert was kind of the first\nanimal i spent any considerable time\nwith and he was just this adorable\nlittle little little being and he loved\nbroccoli so much he just loved brock any\ntime he gave him broccoli he'd be so\nhappy but he never liked kale you know\nhe didn't like kale and which i can kind\nof relate to to be fair but he loved\nbroccoli and didn't like kale so i\nrecognized he had likes and dislikes so\nafter the film had finished and i was\nyou know i was very upset very shaken\ni got rupert out and had him in my hands\nand i'm looking at him and i give him\nsome broccoli because he loves broccoli\nright\ni give him some broccoli i'm watching\nhim eat and he's got his little paws and\nhe's just so cute and i'm thinking wow\nyou know rupert this small tiny animal\nhas so much about him\nthat i really admire his likes his\ndislikes his personality you know things\nthat make him unique you know hamsters\nlove running on wheels well not root but\nthe hamster rubra the hamster hated\nrunning on his wheel he'd got no\nexercise it was cardiovascular health\nmust have been dreadful you know and i\ngot my ball to run around the apartment\nand you know the see-through balls that\nthey can run around in and he wouldn't\nuse it he would just sit there he just\nliked being around us he'd sit on the\nsofa with us and so there was things\nthat made him unique and i thought well\nif rupa has so much\nindividuality about him well what about\nall the chickens and pigs and cows and\neven salmon and tuna what about all of\nthese other animals and even as a\nvegetarian i was abstaining from a huge\npart of the problem but there were still\nall the other aspects that the dairy the\neggs and the you know the clothing the\nlever the wall the things i didn't\nreally think about even as a vegetarian\ni thought what about all these animals\nwho go through these processes who are\nindividuals with likes and dislikes who\ncan feel who can you know suffer and and\nalso experience pleasure and happiness\nas well you know animals experience you\nknow positive emotions not just negative\nemotions as of course we do what makes\nthem different to rupert and i couldn't\ncome to think of a justification for\ncontinuing so yeah i went vegan and that\nwas that wow and your girlfriend at the\ntime was already vegan no we went vegan\ntogether but she was making changes\nbefore i was you know she was thinking\nproactively she was you know we had\nalmond milk and soy milk in the fridge\nand we'd made small steps because she\nhad been influencing me to do so um and\nshe she knew that if i sat down and\nwatched this documentary that would be\nit and i knew it as well which is why i\nturned a blind eye and i think that's\nanother thing that often happens is\nthere's something called the ostrich\neffect which is kind of like a cognitive\nbias so basically when we are confronted\nwith information that makes us feel\nuncomfortable when there's the prospect\nof something that might challenge us in\na way that you know we perceive to be\ninconvenient we can just turn a blind\neye to it and i think what we do to\nanimals is a great example of this i\nthink we've all had a moment\nwhere we've maybe seen something shared\nonline or we've had a conversation with\na friend who's maybe vegan or we've just\nlooked at a piece of meat on our dinner\nplate and just fought for a moment just\nyou know something passed through our\nminds and\nin that moment we can kind of do two\nthings you know acknowledge it or turn a\nblind eye and we often turn a blind eye\nbecause it's easier and more comfortable\nto do so and that's what i was doing you\nknow i knew i knew what happened deep\ndown i knew there was something about it\nthat made me feel uncomfortable but i\nignored it for so long and she was\nconfronting that a little bit earlier\nthan i was and thankfully pushed me to\nconfront it as well because\nyou know through that confrontation of\nour values we can strive to be more in\nalignment with who we truly are as\nindividuals and i think that's the\npowerful thing that i've realized about\nbeing vegan is it's just it's pushed me\nto reevaluate my place you know my\nrelationship with others how i interact\nwith humans as well as animals just you\nknow how my actions impact the world\naround me and how\nwe are vessels\nwho can create you know a more positive\nworld or a more negative world and\nsometimes we feel disempowered in life\nyou know especially with\nsome of the geopolitical things that go\non we can feel very disempowered but for\nme one of the greatest things about\nveganism is the empowerment empowerment\nto know that we can make a difference\nevery day you know a positive difference\nand she encouraged me to learn that\nearly on i love that our journey's got\nsome similarities to it so when i i grew\nup eating meat as well yeah and similar\nto you like going to mcdonald's was like\nour birthday\nlike experience like i used to love\ngoing to mcdonald's for my birthday and\ni remember when i was around\nprobably around 15 years old\nand i used to walk past the butchers\nevery day on my way to school and on my\nway back to back from school at a bus\nstop\nand i would walk past these butchers i\ncan see the street where i grew up right\nnow on green lanes\nand\nthey would hang a lot of the animals in\nin the window yeah\nand\ni never ate a chicken that looked like\nthat to me a chicken looked like this\nperfect crispy round burger\nright that's what chicken looked like to\nme\nand i ate pork sausages but they never\nlooked like pigs hanging i i just ate\nthe pork sausages that you buy in the\nstore\nand so for me when i would walk\npast that\nbutcher's every day on the way to school\nand on the way back from school that's\nwhen it started to hit me where i was\nlike no no no that's the same thing like\ni couldn't bear to look at a hanging pig\ni couldn't bear to look at a hanging\nchicken but i would get really excited\nabout eating my burger and i\ni wouldn't make the connection when i\nate the burger until that point and so i\nremember deciding that i would\nbecome vegetarian at the time\nand i lasted around three months before\ni went back into a mcdonald's three\nmonths later i was craving it so badly\nfor taste yeah and then from that point\non i never have eaten meat since that\nday and so that was around i was 15 16\nyears old and so that's been around 18\nyears now\nand then it was my wife who introduced\nme more to plant-based and vegan she's\nbeen vegan for like 10 years now and so\nshe's been vegan for a long time and\nshe's the one who trained me and helped\nme shift my habits and also be a healthy\nvegan and not become an unhealthy vegan\nand all these beautiful things that\nshe's thought about and you see that and\nyou sit down with students you sit down\nwith people from all over the world from\nall walks of life and here there\nyou debate them you hear their answers\nyou hear their options and their\nopportunities i want to go back to\ntalking about when you made that journey\nand you made that shift\ndid you ever\nland up at the other side of becoming\nthe militant version that you didn't\nwant to be oh i have at times\nand i think that's that encouraged me to\nhopefully become more effective as an\nadvocate as someone who speaks about\nthis issue\ni remember when i'd first kind of gone\nvegan i started to first kind of venture\ninto kind of like activism education you\nknow and i was uploading some videos and\ni had this\nthis conversation with two south african\nguys in trafalgar square in london\nand i was asking them you know some\nquestions about animals and they were\ntelling me that they hunted in south\nafrica and they thought it was okay if\nit was humane and i said what does this\nword humane mean because we throw this\nyou know this word humane around a lot\nwhen we talk about our treatment of\nanimals\nyou know and they said well you know\nwhat we think an example of a humane\ndeath might be some electricity and then\nyou know the the knife you know\nand i said how would you like that have\nhappened to a family member and i was\nquite abrupt about it and they were\nreally taken aback\nand they said they were very unhappy\nabout what i'd said and it was the\nmanner in which i'd said it\nand\ni reflect a lot on that moment because\ntheir reaction to me showed that i'd\nactually been very ineffective in what i\nwas trying to do\nand the way that they kind of like\nseemed very accosted by that comment and\nthe manner the tone of my voice the\nlanguage my body language which is of\ncourse so important when we're\ncommunicating how we look as opposed to\nyou know as well as how we say things\nand what we say\nand i reflect a lot after that because i\nrealized that i was kind of fulfilling\nthat stereotype now vegans do have a\nstereotype whether you know for better\nfor worse whether it's true or not some\npeople do fulfill that stereotype but\nmany vegans don't most vegans don't and\ni think often we build up this\ncaricature almost of what a vegan is\nbecause in a way it allows us to\ndistance ourselves from being vegan you\nknow or i don't want to be like them\nwhich is exactly what i used to be i\ndon't want to be like them because\nthey're like this\nwhen actually it stops us from thinking\nabout the arguments but i realized in\nthat moment i was kind of fulfilling\nthat stereotype\nwhich is everything i don't want to do\nand my content i try mostly you know as\nmuch as i can in the situations i'm in\nto try and not be that person that seems\nlike they're taking a position that is\njudgmental is looking down on someone\nand is instead hopefully asking people\nquestions in a way that encourages them\nto think proactively for themselves and\nso like you say i try very hard to have\nconversations with people from all\nacross the spectrum so i have\nconversations with people who've never\nthought about these issues before who\nare just casual you know meat dairy and\negg eaters who aren't necessarily that\ninvested in doing so but just do it\nbecause they always have but i also have\nconversations with people on the other\nend of the spectrum you know farmers\npeople who are very much ingrained in\nthese systems whose families farmed\nanimals you know grandparents farmed\nanimals who are you know as much in\nthese cultures and communities as we are\nin our own cultures and communities and\nit forms their identities and i always\ntry and take that same approach of\ntrying to understand people's viewpoints\nwe live in um\na slightly\ntroubling time when it comes to the\ndisconnection and division that exists\nthe us is a great example but it's not\njust here let's be honest and veganism\ncan have what seems to be at times an\nelement of division to it but ultimately\nthe way that i see it is that like\neveryone else in this world hopefully by\nand large vegans are just trying to make\nthis world a little bit better just\ntrying to reduce suffering you know\nimprove the environment improve people's\nhealth\nand i think we all share that in common\nso when i have a conversation with a\nfarmer who's in that who's in that\nmindset you know i try and view it from\ntheir perspective which is you know they\nwant to see the same things i do it's\njust we've split apart because of the\nway that we were raised on how to get\nthere and so it's just about me trying\nto show them well actually the way that\nyou've been raised as well as as well as\ncreating validity in your views doesn't\nactually create authenticity in the\nobjectivity of your views what i mean by\nthat it doesn't make them right so i try\nand see people where they are but\nencourage them to to reflect to look\nbeyond their views to look beyond their\nculture to look beyond their communities\nto look beyond their social groups and\nsocial norms and reflect on something\nlarger which is you know how do we all\nachieve what we want to achieve which is\nhopefully a world of more cohesion\nand less suffering humans animals to\neveryone and what you just said there's\nbeautiful because that's what the human\ncapacity of the mind is for right like\nwe know that animals struggle to see\nbeyond certain barriers and even then we\nsee animals you know drag different\nanimals off the street and do these\nbeautiful acts of kindness but overall\nas humans we do have the\nbroad-mindedness\nand the capacity to see beyond\njust our territory right and so when i\nwhen i'm listening to you i'm wondering\nbecause i know a lot of people who saw\nearthlings who saw\nwhat were some of the others game\nchanges what were the other ones that\nweren't minion uh yeah that's a popular\none\ncowspiracy has been conspiracy that was\nreally yeah so i had a lot of friends\nactually who saw those\nand they all did the same thing they\nbecame vegan straight after watching it\nbut then it wasn't sustainable for them\nthey didn't know how to bring into their\ndiet tell me about how you made it\nsustainable how did it really work\nbecause it's been six years for you now\nthat's i would say it's a fairly long\ntime\nsince you discovered this path and know\nabout it how have you made it\nsustainable have you made it healthy for\nyourself because i think the biggest\nthing people struggle with that i know\nthat have watched those documentaries is\nnot that they disagree it's that they're\njust like jay i'm putting on weight i'm\neating fried food all the time i'm\ni i don't know how to cook with it i\ndon't know what i'm doing yeah and then\nsix weeks later i've had many friends go\nback so walk us through how you made it\nsustainable yeah i mean it's a really\ngood point and\njust before i touch tonight i just\nwanted to just reiterate the point that\nyou just made just previous to that\nwhich i thought was really interesting\nwhich is you know it's an important\nthing to recognize that humans and\nnon-human animals are vastly different\nfrom one another as are all animal\nspecies you know\nwe as humans have capabilities and\ncapacities that other animals in this\nplanet don't have\nand intellect you know moral agency uh\nhigh you know heights and cognitive\ncapacities these are all things that\nhumans\nhold which other animals don't not in\nthe same ways that we do at least\num but i think with that comes a great\ndeal of responsibility you know there's\na quote from spider-man uncle ben says\nwith great power comes great\nresponsibility and i think that's a\ngreat great thing because we as humans\ndo have power we have so much power we\nhave power over each other but we have\npower over the world and other animals\nwithin this world and so when we have\nthat\nsituation of authority we have kind of\ntwo choices don't we we can either be\nkind of tyrannical and abusive with our\npower and authority or we can kind of be\nstewards and nurturers like parents you\nknow parents have ultimate power over\ntheir children and but we see children\nbecause of the disadvantagement of their\nyou know lack of cognition lack of\nagency parents have a responsibility to\nlook after children we in a society have\nthe responsibility to look after those\nless privileged than us who don't have\nthe situations that we have who are\nmaybe disenfranchised or or weakened\nwithin the constructs of of this society\nthat we live in\nhow we should live is those with power\nshould look after those who who don't\nhave those uh same attributes that we do\nand i think the relationship with\nanimals is the same we as humans are\nabsolutely more dominant and can be more\ndominant but that dominance doesn't give\nus the right to arbitrarily harm quite\nthe opposite i think you know to look\nafter and nurture and and try and create\na better world you know not just for us\nbut to come back to the point you made\nbecause this is you raised that i'm\nreally glad you said that carry on yeah\nthe point that you made is potentially\none of the most important points\nthe recognition that we want to change\nis really important but then the\ncapacity to do that is very different\nso for me when i first went vegan i made\na dreadful mistake which is i only ate\nkale and quinoa right i thought you know\nvegans eat this type of food therefore i\nhave to eat this type of food and you\nshould eat kale and quinoa they're two\ngreat food sources but i was eating a\nlot of quinoa and kale and thinking why\ndon't i feel full you know why do i feel\nsatiated and i realized that i was\ntaking out you know big kind of calorie\ndense foods that were kind of full of\nprotein and full of fat and i wasn't\nreplacing them with necessarily good\nalternatives so i was eating less\ncalories than i should have done so i\nwas feeling hungrier and maybe wasn't\neating enough so i think the first thing\nto do is to research really important to\nresearch because what we want as you\nknow as we change into this new way of\nlife is to make sure that we do it in a\nway that optimizes the longevity of that\nchange as you say people do it for a\nlittle bit and then they go back because\nit's more comfortable more convenient or\nmaybe you know they don't feel like\nthey're eating enough and they're not\nfull enough and so they think well this\nvegan thing doesn't work for me\nso what we have to do is do a little bit\nof research so i always say to people\nrecognize why you want to make the\nchange then sit down and look at okay\nprotein sources really easy it's really\neasy when you look at it but it's it\nfeels like it's a big thing when you're\nbefore you're vegan so look at protein\nsources how do i get protein look at\niron especially if you're a young woman\nhow do you get your iron really\nimportant\nzinc you know omega-3 help just do a\nlittle bit of research and look into how\nyou can do it and then also don't be\nafraid to experiment now the thing about\nbeing vegan is you don't have to\nreinvent the wheel that's what i like\nabout it you know for me when i first\nwent vegan it was a different time\nthere was not the options that we have\nnow there was not the recipes online\nlike in the abundance they are now i\nmean your wife roddy has so much great\nfood on her instagram you know so she's\na great resource and instagram is a\ngreat resource for people looking to\nfind you know plant-based meals and\nplant-based foods so do a little bit of\nresearch find some meals that you like\nbut also take the meals you already like\nand simplify it down for me i love pasta\ni've always loved pasta but i also like\nstir fries curries burritos nachos tacos\nfajitas whatever it might be\nfind what aspect of it isn't vegan okay\nspaghetti bolognese is easy it's the\nbeef mints right so take out the cow\nfrom the meal and replace it with soy\nmints or lentils oh or whatever you want\nto replace it with you can cook it\nexactly the same way and you've just\nchanged one thing and you're eating the\nexact same food so i think just making\nsmall replacements to meals you already\nlike just simplifies it down because\notherwise we think i've got to eat all\nthis vegan food and it's going to be\nreally tricky because i'm changing\neverything about my life and it doesn't\nhave to be that way so just those little\nincremental changes in the foods that\nyou're consuming go a long way and then\njust being empowered to know where\nyou're getting nutrients from how am i\ngoing to be healthy am i hitting my my\ndaily targets and if you're especially\nworried there are sites uh like\nchronometer\nbasically it's just like a website you\ncan get an app on your phone and you\njust log your food so you put i've had\nyou know 80 grams of brown rice 100\ngrams of broccoli whatever it might be\nand it tells you the calories it tells\nyou the nutrients and so at the end of\nthe day you can go yep i've got all the\ncalories oh here's my iron here's my\nprotein it's all good calcium could be a\nbit higher so tomorrow i'll have another\nglass of soy milk or something and then\nyou can just cater your diet and your\nlifestyle around that because you know\nyou're hitting your targets yeah i think\nthat's a good thing to do yeah yeah and\nand i guess when you've been doing it\nyou seem fairly healthy so that's good\nhopefully so yeah and that was it for me\ntoo like i cut out dairy because i was\nalready vegetarian when i married riley\ni cut out dairy\nbasically the night we got married and\nso as soon as the next day when we were\num moved into our home and everything we\nwere now\nuh not eating any dairy so the hardest\nthings for me were cheese and chocolate\nbecause i love chocolate and adore\nchocolate it's like my favorite thing in\nthe world and cheese of course right\nyeah and actually the crazy thing is\nsince that so that's been five years for\nme since we got married\nand i feel so much better just on the\nbasis of how i feel yeah i didn't do it\nfor that reason i didn't i did it for\nanimals like understanding that i was\nstill disconnected i did it from that\npoint of view but i feel so much better\nfor it and i'm healthier for it because\ni'm not consuming as much sugar through\nthe chocolate radish introduced me to\nall these naturally sweetened cacao nibs\nand all this kind of stuff so i eat this\nthing called monk fruit ironically oh i\nknow monk yeah from la canto or\nsomething there's a brand like that and\nthere's no artificial sugars no they're\nall naturally sweetened with monk fruits\nso that's been better for me\ncutting out cheese i've just cut out\ncheese completely so i barely eat even\nvegan cheese options because i'm\nenjoying just\ntrying new foods and experiencing new\nflavors and so\ni feel like making it sustainable is so\nimportant but now let's let's go macro i\nwanted to talk about\nthe vegan propaganda the book that is\nout right now that i'd love for people\nto go and read you have three parts it's\na question of morality playing with fire\nand breaking down the barriers so we\nstarted very micro about your journey i\nwant to zoom out and go macro now sure\nlet's talk about morality because\ni find as we've talked about for a lot\nof people it's as simple as being rupert\nthis is what i like and this is what i\ndon't like right like rupert likes\nbroccoli doesn't like kale i like meat i\ndon't like vegetables sure fruits\nthere's that option there's also the\nidea of but what's wrong with it right\nthere\nthey aren't as smart as us as we both\nalready agreed or they can't make those\ndecisions and choices they've been\ncreated for that that's what they're\nthere for they're on the planet for when\nyou're looking at morality as a whole\ni'm wondering\nhow are you\ntrying to help people understand that\nbeing an animal lover and eating meat\ndon't go hand in hand for me this issue\nof morality comes down to our capacity\nto have a choice\nyou know obviously it's important to\nrecognize that throughout most of our\nhistory as humans\nwe were hunter-gatherers right you know\nwe hunted to survive\nmeat has always formed a big part of our\ndiet it provided a sustenance and\nnutrients when we needed it during those\ntimes and you know it got us to where we\nare allowed us to live as a species and\nsurvive and thrive along with all the\nberries that we foraged and all the nuts\nthat we forced all of that combined to\nus being where we are now but we live in\na unique time we\nhave been able to understand what our\nbodies need to survive we understand\nvitamins and nutrients and minerals\nthat's only you know something we've\ndone in the past hundred years really\num we recognize other plant you know\nwhere we can get these sources from in\nplant foods so we have an intelligence\nand education that we didn't have before\nwe also know more about animals now back\nthrough our history we used to view\nanimals as kind of these automatons\nright they were there with us but they\nweren't sentient they didn't feel you\nknow we were very flippant in our\ntreatment of animals we we are still\ntoday of course but\nnow we understand more about animals we\nunderstand their complexity\nyou know we look at\ndocumentaries about animals in the wild\nand we see them do amazing things but\nmore than that we we understand and\nappreciate their individuality in a way\nthat previously we probably didn't write\nso we have an education about how we can\nbe vegan but we also have education\nabout animals and because we understand\nwhat animals are able to feel and we\nhave an understanding of what they\nendure through the processes in which we\nput them in\nwe can recognize something about them\nwhich is that they are\nhaving a subjective experience\nso what i mean by that is\nwe farm 80 billion land animals every\nsingle year when you factor in marine\nanimals that number becomes 0.8 to 2.3\ntrillion that's how many marine animals\nwe kill fish 0.8 to 2.3 trillion every\nsingle year a staggering number right\nwow huge huge\n80 billion land animals\nand that those numbers are shocking and\nand we say those numbers and we think\nwow that's big but they're very hard to\nunderstand because they're so huge it's\njust it's just a statistic\nit's just a number how does that look\nhow do we quantify what that means it's\nalmost impossible\nso the best way to look at it is that\nout of all of those billions and\ntrillions each and every one of those is\nan individual now to me this is where it\ngets disturbing and alarming because i\nthink about everything that we do to an\nanimal i think about every single\nindividual animal is experiencing that\non their own you know when we suffer we\nsuffer as individuals obviously we can\nshare that in the the empathy of other\nsuffering but the pain that we feel is\npain that we feel\nand when things happen to us we embody\nthat for our anxieties our fears our\nterrors our worries and of course the\nvisceral and physical feeling of what\nwe're enduring as well i think about\neach and every individual animal\nenduring that and that just magnifies\nthe scale to me in a way that you can't\nrecognize within those\npurely you know statistical numbers\nbecause when we hone in on each\nindividual animal enduring that i think\nwow you know every decision we make has\nan impact on someone we often don't\nthink of animals as someone's we call\nthem it you know it's a chicken it's a\npig they're only a chicken they're only\na pig but what we fail to recognize is\nto that pig or chicken their life is as\nvaluable to them as ours is to us\nbecause we we have one life and they may\nnot be able to rationalize the concept\nof death and the concept of not existing\nin the way that we can but they avoid\nsituations of fear they avoid situations\nthat cause them suffering they they\nvalue pleasure and pain over negative\nenvironments because they value\nbeing content\nand really when we boil down our\nexistence that's all we want as well to\nbe content to be happy i mean\nyour work is about making people feel as\nan individual\nlike they belong to themselves you know\nyou're increasing people's autonomy\nyou're increasing people's self-esteem\nyou're giving them a sense of self-worth\nyou know your work and i think so much\nof what you do which is so amazing is\nyou empower people to believe in\nthemselves as an individual\nand so what i'm saying about that is we\nvalue ourselves well they value\nthemselves as well and what we do to\nthem is we deny them their autonomy we\ndeny them the right to their own body\nand so it becomes an issue of morality\nbecause we don't have to do that anymore\nwe don't have to do these things to them\nanymore because we have the educational\nawareness to know that there are other\nways\nand so\nto simplify it down just just\nask a really simple question\nare we against animal cruelty\ndo we think that reducing animal\nsuffering is morally preferable to not\neveryone says yes to that and everyone\nsays that they're against animal cruelty\nso then we have to say well what does\nbeing cruel to someone mean\nbeing cruel to someone means causing\nthem physical or mental emotional\npsychological harm for an unnecessary\nreason something that doesn't need to\nhappen but negatively impacts them in a\nnon-consensual way that's being cruel to\nsomeone whether it's bullying whether\nit's something a bit more abusive\nwhatever it might be\nbut what we do to animals must therefore\nconstitute an act of cruelty because we\ndon't have to do it and it causes them\nphysical harm mental harm emotional harm\nand it's non-consensual you know these\nanimals they don't they don't\nwillfully agree to be exploited this is\nnot an environment they wish to be in\nand then we put them into something\ncalled a slaughterhouse and we call them\nhumane okay so what does the word humane\nmean well if we open up a thesaurus find\nthe word humane in the thesaurus okay\nwhere this what are the synonyms what\nwords mean humane we see compassionate\nwe see benevolent we see kind if i call\nyou a humane person i'm saying that\nyou're inherently a good person who who\nvalues others and their feelings and you\nwant to be compassionate and you are a\nhumane person jay because you embody all\nof those those characteristics\nbut then what happens in the\nslaughterhouse couldn't possibly be\nhumane because it's not compassionate to\nexploit someone else needlessly it's not\nit's not benevolent to take the life of\nsomeone when we don't have to you know\nmany of us do have pets in our life dogs\ncats\nand it's a sad thing to say but\nunfortunately we will probably live to\nsee them be euthanized it's a very sad\ntime for people to experience the loss\nof a family member because that's how we\nview these animals as family members\nwould we ever take them to a\nslaughterhouse to be euthanized never\nthe thought of that would would offend\npeople would make them so sad to think\nof their beloved family member enduring\nthat well then it can't be humane it\ncan't be so when we talk about this\nissue of morality fundamentally it's\nwe don't have to do this\nthey're sentient beings who feel they're\nvery different to us but what makes them\nmorally relevant is their capacity to\nsuffer experience pain the fact that\nthey do value their own life they value\ntheir own existence they seek to be with\ntheir families if that's what is in\ntheir nature you know cows from these\nstrong matriarchal herds chickens have\nthese flocks\nthey form deep connections with one\nanother and they can form deep\nconnections with us when we give them\nthe chance to like animal sanctuaries\nand places where they're not you know\nused and exploited and killed\nso that's why it's a moral issue for me\nwhat a great answer what a great answer\ni i really appreciate that answer\nbecause i was listening to you thinking\njust how much culture and tradition\nimpacts it too so i remember going to\nindia for the first time ever when i was\nnine years old and when i lived as a\nmonk there for plenty of time a big part\nof it was caring for cows uh cows are\nseen as a sacred animal in india and in\nfamilies growing up in india if you look\nyou know years ago\na cow would be the family pet i mean it\nwouldn't be a pet it would be considered\na mother but it would be considered part\nof the family and the cow would give you\nmilk and the cow would be taken care of\nand the cow would be loved and adored\nand revered\nand you'd almost find dogs that would\njust walk around straight on the street\nand people wouldn't give them the\nattention we see in the west so why do\nyou think we've been able to build up\nsuch a\ndeep loving relationship with dogs and\ncats\nbut why do you think we've struggled\nbecause i've seen\npeople play with cows the way we play\nwith our dogs and i know that sounds\nreally strange to anyone who's never\nseen it but i've seen people in india\nhold their cow and hug their cows and\nhave that same very deep intimate\nrelationship with the cow but in the\nwest we don't really\never experience that apart from a dog\nand a cat why have we been so good at\ngiving our compassion and love there but\nnot there i think there's kind of like a\nutility aspect to this and what i mean\nby that is historically\nuh\nespecially against in the culture where\nwe've been we've we we gave dogs like a\ntask and that task was often been a\nlookout for us so they would pull our\nour equipment you know like us on\nsledges and such and so we've we've\nalways often value dogs in a different\nway to the other animals we've used cows\nas like farm labor we've used you know\nother animals in different capacities\nbut for dogs we've always had a little\nbit more of an intimate relationship\nbecause of the nature of the work that\nwe used to you know use them for and\nthen as we started to evolve as a\nspecies we no longer needed you know\nkind of uh the ancestors of huskies to\nbe our lookouts because of course you\nknow from wolves and so we no longer\nneeded them to look out for us so we no\nlonger needed them to pull our sledges\nand our relationship with these animals\nstarted to change because we still had a\nconnection with them we started to view\nthem a little bit differently so what we\ndo is we categorize animals differently\nso we have wild animals for instance and\nif someone poaches a wild animal you\nknow cecil the lion killer there's an\nuproar because in our minds we\ncategorize them as being not for that\npurpose they exist in the wild we don't\nneed to get anything from them they\ndon't they don't need to earn our\nrespect you know they do their own thing\nand then we have kind of pets and\nthey've earned our respect in a\ndifferent way they've earned the right\nto live in our eyes because we can form\na an emotional response with them we\nhave for a history um they can provide\nutility as members of our family provide\nus with love provide us with comfort\nprovide us with mental health supports\nwhich is a you know a great thing that\npets can do as well and by pets\ni use the word pets because it's kind of\nlike a conventional term what i mean is\nkind of companion animals and let me\njust explain what i mean by that briefly\nwhen i say companion animals it's just\nto reiterate the point that\nthey are kind of co-existing with us in\nour relationships and our families the\nword pet almost signifies like we have\nsome sort of authority over them and we\ndo but when we say companions it kind of\nsymbolizes that relationship more\nwholesomely i think it symbolizes that\nwe coexist together and they're here for\nour life and we're there for theirs so\nit's kind of a bit more wholesome so\ncompanion animals so we've categorized\nthese animals as being companions\nbecause the utility from what we get for\nthem is different\nbut then we've categorized this other\nsection of animals we call them food\nwhat we've essentially done is we've\notherized them otherwising is a you know\na very toxic thing that we've done with\nother humans as well where we put them\nin a different classification\nand then we value them differently and\nthen we create justifications to\nexplain why they're in that category so\nwhat we said before they're not as\nintelligent as us oh pigs are dirty\nchickens are stupid we've kind of\ncreated these arbitrary classifications\nfor these animals and then we treat them\ndifferently because we've classified\nthem differently things that we would\nnever do to companion animals things\nthat we would never like to happen to\nwild animals we can do arbitrarily to\nthese animals because they're the food\nanimals and so their place in this world\nand our relationship with them and the\nutility we can get from them is\ndifferent and that's why they're here\nso\npart of part of it is obviously cultural\nthe question to ask ourselves is well is\nsomething moral simply because it's\ncultural i think we all agree that\nthat's not the case and we look for our\nhistory don't we we see examples of\nthings that were cultural examples of\nthings that were traditional\nbut were not moral and thankfully we\nchallenged ourselves to understand that\nand we changed our relationship with the\noppressed in those scenarios to\nhopefully try and create better systems\nof uh more equality which obviously\nstill needs a lot of work on as well but\nwhen it comes to the animals that we've\ncategorized as food culturally we have\ningrained this behavior\nculturally we have allowed this to\nbecome such a dominant viewpoint that we\nnever really think about it what's\ninteresting is as children we don't have\nthese categorizations\ngive a four-year-old child a piglet and\na puppy\nthe child isn't going to push the piglet\nto one side and say you know\nkill this animal but let me love this\nanimal the child enjoys the company of\nboth because they've they don't see that\ndistinction yet\nwe raise children to start to view\nanimals differently it's this term\ncalled speciesism\nbasically what it means is that we\narbitrarily exploit different animals\nbased on the species they're born into\nso you know we harm a pig because\nthey're a pig if that pig was a dog it\nwould be different but you know\nfundamentally the moral distinction\nbetween those animals is is\nnon-existent pigs and dogs are very\nsimilar in their intelligence in their\nsociability\nin all these different ways\nbut because we see them as that species\nthey look the way they do that's why we\nharm them because of their view you know\ntheir appearance and that's what\nspeciesism is it's kind of addressing\nthat we're\narbitrarily harming this being this\nindividual because of the way they look\nbecause of how they were born because of\nthe species the body they were born into\nso anyway we have these cultures and\ntraditions that are ingrained for our\nhistory for hundreds sometimes thousands\nof years and we don't ever really think\nabout them critically because why would\nwe our peers do it our parents engage in\nthis our society is engaged with this\nit's legal\nbut then does legality equal morality\nagain history shows us that it shouldn't\nbe that case and it clearly isn't\nso when we start to think a little bit\nmore deeply about each of these\nindividual\narguments that we use we start to\nrealize that actually they don't really\njustify at all what we do to these\nanimals that cultures and traditions\nshould be challenged\nbecause we we do look across the world\nand we see what happens\nto dogs in asia for example it's a you\nknow classic example\nand we signed petitions demanding for it\nto stop you know this is an abomination\nwe shouldn't be doing this to dogs\noh but i want to eat my bacon sandwich\noh but i want my fried chicken burger\nwhich is the person i used to be but if\nwe think well actually\noutside of the culture that we're raised\nin outside of the fact that we view dogs\nas companions and pigs and chickens as\nfood\nwhat really is the difference other than\nthat arbitrary classification because\nyou put a dog in a in a farm in a\nslaughterhouse and you put a pig in a\nfarm in a slaughterhouse and you put a\ncow in a farm and then in a\nslaughterhouse they experience each of\nthose individual actions identically to\nthe individual in those environments\nthere is no different to the difference\nto the experience that they're enduring\nyeah the only difference is our\nperception\nso we view them as different but when we\nbreak away that perception and we view\nthem not as being you know as different\nin their own way in their own right but\nsimilar in the ways that matter all of a\nsudden we recognize if it's wrong for\nthis animal well then it must be wrong\nfor this animal and it must be wrong for\nthat animal yeah and i think that's what\nwe need to do more is to challenge those\ndeeply ingrained and normalized\nbehaviors the ones that we don't even\nthink about the unconscious ones and\nthat's and that's really where it comes\nat from me like you know i\nagain and and i love what you just said\nthere too it's like i grew up eating me\nso i very clearly understand\nat that time when i ate me i had no idea\nwhat the word vegetarian even was to\nsome degree i didn't know what veganism\nwas for sure and i didn't know about any\nother diet that existed apart from what\ni ate\nand so now when i look at that i\nrecognize that\nand this is why i'm hoping this podcast\nis going to help a lot of people because\nyou're so brilliant at educating and i\nthink you do that wonderfully\nand\nthis education is what's missing\nit's not that people are bad people i\ndon't judge anyone who eats meat because\ni ate beat myself so i understand how\neasy it is to be in that space where you\nare making these distinctions and what i\nlove about the way you just broke that\ndown is because you're spot on that\nthroughout history we've done that to\nhumans\nthat look different from us that have a\ndifferent hair color than us like we've\ndone that and like you said that\nlegality and morality don't go hand in\nhand because we've had to upgrade\nlegality\nto achieve real morality it's been a\nconstant upgrade and we're still getting\nthere so that i really find fascinating\nbecause what we're doing to animals\nright now is what we've done to humans\nthroughout history\nand yes we may have at least externally\nstopped doing it to humans or in\norganized ways but we are currently\nstill doing it in very organized\ninstitutional ways to animals\nyeah i mean what what you said right the\nbeginning of that is really important\nyou know good people can engage in\nthings that are bad we all we all do you\nknow we all do because we do live in an\ninherently imperfect world but by the\nmere fact that we have to do things to\nsurvive we have to eat we have to drink\nthere are going to be things that happen\non this planet that are negative for\nsome people on this planet and by people\ni mean i can also mean animals you know\nthe extraction of resources from nature\nthings like that\nso we do live an inherently imperfect\nworld and unfortunately we're never\ngonna i well i'd like to think we could\nbut realistically we're never going to\nachieve a perfect utopia you know but\nthat's something the aspiration\nshouldn't be to get as close as we\npossibly can so the important thing to\nrecognize is yeah it's not about saying\nthis one's bad because they engage in\nbad things it's not as easy as that the\nworld isn't as black and white as we\nsometimes like to think it is it's\nactually a lot more nuanced and\ncomplicated and we all in our own ways\ncan engage in industries that are bad\nand what we do to animals is just\nobjectively bad in every sense of the\nword but good people can engage in that\nbecause of these cultural structures\nthese societal barriers and the third\nsection of the book\nis all about that you know the first\nsection of the book is dealing with the\nmoral aspect it's talking about what we\ndo to animals it's talking about the\nhistory of what we do to animals it's\ntalking about the ethical implications\nand it's trying to hopefully challenge\nus to think about our own morality\nthe second section of the book then\ntalks about the environment it talks\nabout you know pandemics and infectious\ndisease something that is you know\nheavily linked to factory farming you\nsaw that video you made about that that\nwas brilliant yeah thank you yeah we\ndon't really realize but buying a\nchicken breast is one of the most\ndangerous things that we can do in terms\nof creating a new pandemic you know same\nwith bacon so it's about looking at that\nand then also chronic health so looking\nat heart disease you know certain forms\nof cancer so looking at how it impacts\nus as individuals as well but then the\nthird section\nwas really important to me because i\nwanted to give people the reasons to be\nvegan but i also then wanted to explain\nwhy it is that these systems exist and\nto try and almost diffuse the idea of\njudgment and feeling bad is to say look\nthis is all objectively wrong but you're\nnot a bad person if you've engaged in\nthis up until this point because there\nare all these boundaries there are all\nthese barriers that are the\npsychological social and cultural things\nit's about helping people understand the\nmechanisms behind why we do what we do\nbecause that's almost as important as\nunderstanding what we do\nwhy we do it because it's through\nunderstanding the why that we can\nchallenge it and go right okay\nwhen i'm in a supermarket and i see that\npiece of steak\ni can i think about what happens to the\nanimal i know how that impacts the\nenvironment i know how that impacts my\nhealth but now i understand that\npsychological thing that makes me want\nto pick it up i know how i've got myself\ninto this state where i you know i'm\ndesiring this where i'm normalizing this\nand i can challenge my own\npreconceptions of why i do what i do as\nwell so trying to build that up for\npeople i think is really important um\nbecause you're right and then to kind of\ngo back to what you said right at the\nend\nunfortunately you know human history has\nnever been without its significant\nproblems\nwe've never reached a point and we're\ncertainly not there yet where we can sit\ndown\nand relax and go oh wow we've we've\novercome every adversity on this planet\nwe're not even close to that when we\nthink about the history of our species\nespecially um you know in the past few\nhundred years\nthis work is only just beginning to\nother humans as well it's only just\nbeginning but our intelligence can\nsometimes cloud our imperfections\nyou know we are so intelligent and we're\ncapable of doing so much and what the\nworld could look like if we if we just\ncame together and and sat and empathized\nand fought deeply about these issues and\nand got through some of these kind of\nmore kind of\nprimal aspects that we haven't quite\nevolved out of yet we could achieve such\na wonderful thing we could create such a\ngreat world but unfortunately we're\nnowhere near that yet and what we do to\nanimals is just becoming part of the\nconversation and i'm very grateful it's\nnow part of the conversation but it's\njust happening now and we've been doing\nthis for you know hundreds thousands of\nyears to them\nand when we look at the\nthe justifications when we look at the\nthe view when we when we\nlook at the reaction that people have to\nthose who say that they want to defend\ntheir bodies and rights of animals we\ncan see a lot of parallels that just\nthat automatic dismissal\nno they're different they're not like us\nwe don't need to do that society's been\nbuilt in this way it's legal you know we\ndon't think about it all of these things\nthat have perpetuated oppression to\nhumans are now being seen to perpetuate\nan oppression to animals and i'm\ngrateful that we're starting to\nchallenge it but it's important that we\ndon't ever think and get complacent in\nour morality because we're always going\nto be able to improve a little bit more\nand what we do to animals is now part of\nthat improvement it's part of that\nconversation to say actually we have\nachieved a lot but we've got a long way\nto go and our relationship with those\nwho are\nweaker more vulnerable\nthan us will define how far we can come\nin the future yeah well said absolutely\nand one of the things you mentioned\nthere that i think\nis the healthiest way and as i said from\nthe start of the interview i've been\ndoing in my own way is\nis that reflection when you're now\nat the supermarket or the grocery store\nor wherever you are\nand you're having to have that dialogue\nand that internal conversation with\nyourself usually it gets trumped by\nthings like oh but veganism is really\nexpensive\nand and vegan food is really pricey and\nwhen we think about poorer countries or\npoorer families or poorer communities\nthat need to shift you can go to\nmcdonald's and get a happy meal for a\ndollar or get like burger fries and coke\nfor like i don't know like a dollar\nfifty or whatever it is and then you\nstart thinking about oh my salad's like\n15 or even if i'm if i buy it i'm saying\nif i if i make it then sure it's cheaper\nbut\nwhat have you looked at when you're\nthinking about people saying well\nveganism is expensive it's expensive to\neat healthy and to eat to support\nanimals yeah i mean it's important to\nstay and maybe i shouldn't say that\nthere are nuances to everything\nthere are people in this world obviously\nglobally speaking there are you know\nthere are many people in this world that\ndon't have the accessibility that we\nhave especially you and i you know\nrecording this in los angeles where it's\nvery easy for us there obviously when we\nspeak globally there are people that\ndon't have the accessibility the\naffordability the availability and the\noption to make the choice that we can\nmake\nand that's absolutely fine to recognize\nand then even in the culture and society\nwhere we are we're in the u.s obviously\nthere's huge problems with economic\ndisparity here as there are in most\nplaces around the world um and also\navailability and abundance and again we\nrecognize that there are nuances to what\npeople can achieve in their own life\nnow there was a study that was released\nbut it was it was just published i think\nyesterday it's been reported on today\nthe day that we're filming that is\nand it was looking at the expense of\nplant-based foods and ultimately if\nyou're going to a whole foods and you're\nbuying like beyond burgers beyond\nsausages impossible that kind of thing\nthat's going to be more expensive but at\nthe same time if you stick to whole\nfoods um and those are the healthier\nfoods you know the whole grains the\nbeans\n[Music]\nwhole plant foods exactly so minimally\nprocessed plant foods exactly yeah so\nyou know things like whole grains\nlegumes beans chickpeas seasonal\nvegetables and fruits\nyou can actually save money you know\nnormally when you go to supermarket the\nmost expensive things you can buy a\nsteak cheese often and like salmon\nfillets so you can actually save money\nthe study was saying you could say about\n30 on your normal budget by switching to\nthese whole plant foods so which are the\nhealthier ones as well thankfully which\nis a good thing but not everyone has\nthat option everyone has the\naccessibility so i think that\nthat gives us those who do even more\nresponsibility even more of a an\nobligation to make those changes because\nthe only way that we can challenge the\nthe disparity in people's\nability to access certain foods is by\nfundamentally challenging the food\nsystem itself if we keep buying the same\nfoods and perpetuating the same systems\nwith our purchases we're not asking for\nchange now the food industry is propped\nup\nby things like subsidies from the\ngovernment which drive down the prices\nof foods i mean there's a reason you can\ngo to mcdonald's and get a chicken\nburger for a couple of dollars but if\nyou want a punnet of blueberries it's\ngoing to set you back you know\nthree or four or five dollars right and\nthat's because of the way that the\ngovernment subsidizes subsidizes these\nfoods if you look at the cost of raising\nanimals of producing feed for animals of\nthe antibiotics used for animals you\nknow of of the the equipment of the\nland if they land everything and then\nyou look at the environmental cost the\ncleanup costs the the health costs for\nhealth care for people who end up with\nhealth diseases as a consequence the\nprice these products is absolutely\nmassive it's just hidden costs that we\ndon't think about but we need to\nchallenge this and the only way we can\nchallenge that is by making choices and\nchanges in our own individual life so\nfor those of us who have the power the\ncapacity the the privilege let's use\nthat word because that's what it is the\nprivilege to be able to make these\nchoices i think we're even more obliged\nto do so for those people in the future\nwho would like to but maybe don't have\nthe capacity to now who aren't given the\nluxury of been able to think critically\nbecause you know they've got a family to\nfeed they're working two jobs um there's\nno supermarket close by there's only a\nmcdonald's to taco bell and they need to\nfeed their family\nso what are you gonna do as a parent\nwell we know and that's exactly what\nhappened so if we want to help people in\nsituations of\nof economic disparity where the\nabundance isn't there then we need to\nchallenge the system the first way to do\nthat is to change our behaviors and then\nvote with our dollar and then hopefully\ninfluence the supply and demand system\nand then through that we can start to\ncampaign to our governments and say look\npardon the pun but there's an appetite\nfor change here you know and then we can\ntry to create a more equal agricultural\nfood system but it starts right now at\nleast with that individual making that\nchoice and then you know a mass\ncollective individuals coming together\nyou know one thing people often say to\nme is they say ed you know maybe i agree\nwith you but me not buying that cheese\nin the supermarket isn't going to change\nthe world and it's not but anything that\never has changed the world has changed\nthe world because of a mass group of\nindividuals anything positive comes from\nthe individual realizing and wanting to\nbe an active part in that change and we\nall have the power to be an individual\nwithin that mass collective movement\nthat creates positive different that\ncreates a positive difference and i want\neveryone to know who's listening right\nnow that when you\nget the book this is vegan propaganda\ned talks about everything from the\nenvironmental impacts through to the\nmeat paradox through to\nhow to do this in a healthy unhealthy\nalternatives that exist in the world i i\nthink what's fascinating is that this\nbook dives so deeply into so much more\nthan what we've discussed today yeah\nit's the environmental impacts it's the\nimpact of what is a healthy and\nunhealthy way of doing this\nyou're asking the questions that are\nimportant to us can poor our country\nshift in this direction and so\nthe reason why i want everyone to go and\ngrab the book this is vegan propaganda\nis because i want us to just be educated\nand learn and be informed so that we can\nmake informed decisions and i think that\nthat's how what we saw happen in the\nworld over the last few years is we all\nhad a very\nuniquely\nsimilar experience as a species\nwe started to recognize that when we all\nthought in a certain direction we can\nmake change but the thought had to start\nwith education yeah like all the things\nto start with education and i think the\nchallenge with\nveganism for a very very long time has\nbeen that there has been no education\naround it it's been a point of view it's\nbeen a debate it's been an argument it's\nbeen a\nforced potentially or fear-based\nlanguage and education whereas now it's\njust like well this is just what's\nhappening yeah and ed i just appreciate\nyou so much for doing what you're doing\nuh and i can't wait to see you continue\nto do it in more beautiful incredible\nways i can't wait for the documentary uh\nwhen that happens but for everyone who's\nbeen listening right now highly\nrecommend go and follow earthling ed on\ninstagram uh to keep up today and on\nyoutube as well\nand of course go and grab the book this\nis vegan propaganda i could talk to ed\nfor hours but i have to unfortunately\nstart um but ed i'm gonna ask you what\nwe always end every interview with which\nis called the final five yeah and you\nwill i know put your spin on all of\nthese so the first question is what is\nthe best\nvegan or plant-based advice that you've\never received um\nresearch research research research\nbecause it's free research that we can\nbecome yeah informed consumers like you\nsay and uh\naristotle the philosopher once said the\nroots of education are bitter but the\nfruit is sweet and i think that's so\nprofound because it isn't comfortable to\nlearn about these issues and a lot of\nwhat we discussed can be challenging but\nthe the prize at the end of it is\nconsistency in our values and the sense\nof being a part of something positive so\nyeah the roots of education are bitter\nbut the fruit is sweet that's a great\nanswer all right what is the worst vegan\nadvice you've ever received the worst\nvegan advice oh wow that's a good\nquestion\num the worst vegan advice or given or\nreceiving\ni think it comes down to advocacy people\nhave a range of different views about\nhow to advocate for issues like we've\nspoken about a couple of times and some\npeople have views about how to do it\nthat are different to my views and for\nme i i practice what i preach in the\nsense of i try and come across in the\nway that i think others should and some\npeople disagree with that and so their\nadvice to me has been contradicting what\ni think so to me that hasn't always been\nthe best advice\nthat's good all right if you could make\none law in the world that everyone had\nto follow what would it be oh wow i mean\nthe dogmatic side of me says be vegan\nobviously and obviously i mean if there\nwas one law in the world yeah that's\nwhat i'd want um but i appreciate that\nsounds so dogmatic doesn't it but i'd\nhave to say that i don't know so yeah i\nwas expecting it yeah it does i mean it\nwould be surprising after all this it\nwould be wouldn't it if you came up with\nsomething\nmaybe to soften it be nice to animals\nyeah yeah look after them yeah\nand redefine the word humane yeah for\nourselves when it comes to animals all\nright fourth question what is the\nbiggest lesson you've learned in the\npast 12 months yeah in the past 12\nmonths i think again it comes down to\nthe idea of um\ngood people can do bad things it's\nsomething i've been learning a lot but i\nthink that especially in the past couple\nof years but even in the past 12 months\ni've really enjoyed the company of\nhumans that sounds strange maybe but the\npandemic has disconnected us a lot from\none another and i used to do this you\nknow have conversations and you know\nmeet people a lot before the pandemic as\nwe all did right and in the past 12\nmonths as i've slowly started to build\nto integrate back into some of these\nthese realms of conversation it's made\nme realize how much i enjoy humans\neven humans that are doing the thing\nthat i'm trying to stop what i like\nabout having debates with people is it\nmakes me realize how connected we all\nare how we all think very similarly at\ntimes you know about these issues how\nwe're not that different from one\nanother doesn't matter if i go to a\nuniversity here or a farm here or you\nknow this country or wherever\nwe so we think intrinsically very\nsimilar and that's something i've\nlearned especially as we come out you\nknow we're still in the pandemic but as\nwe started to see light at the end of\nthe tunnel i've been able to reintegrate\nback into the work that i used to do\njust how much\nhumans can be good you know and i think\nthat's a really powerful thing for me to\nkeep reminding myself yeah i mean some\nof my best friends are not vegan some of\nmy closest friends in my family and and\njust so many people i love and i think\nthat that's such a good point and you\nknow when we're sitting down to do this\ni know this comes from both of our\nhearts like\ni'm doing this just out of a compassion\nand education like there's no part of me\nthat judges anyone for doing something\nthat i just did a few years ago and and\nthat lack of judgment is what allows all\nof us to grow and by the way i also\nthink it's important to stay and i\nhaven't felt this from a moment of\nmeeting you i mean\nwhen i s when i've seen your videos i'm\nlike wow ed is ed is tough in a good way\nand i met you today you're the sweetest\nhuman ever i'm like wow this guy's like\ni was like wow he's so nice uh not that\ni expected you to be not nice\nyou like i was like wow ed is just so\npersonal and just so\num i don't know what it is you you have\na real sweetness and softness and\nkindness about you in person uh that\npeople wouldn't get to see always\nthrough a debate or a screen and and i\nreally feel that\nthe idea that this is all coming from a\nplace of just compassion love kindness\nand non-judgment and also doesn't we\nshouldn't feel have an ego\nthis is how we were trained as monks\nthat just because you care for animals\nthat's actually the most basic human\nquality like you can't have an ego about\nthat either you can't think you're\nbetter because you're vegan because the\nwhole point is that you should be\nhonoring these animals anyway and so i\nthink there's there's both ends of the\ncoin of the ego in how we present\nveganism to others but also the ego we\nfeel internally because we think we're\nbetter than others and i think both of\nthose have to be\nremoved yeah um\nfifth and final question is\nwhat is anything that i haven't asked\nyou but you really want to say\nbecause\nyou feel that it's on your heart and on\nyour mind and and needs to be shared i\nthink accountability um\nit's really important to me that\ni come across in a way that um seems\nempathetic to people and and a lot of\nthe work that i do is trying to\nrationalize why people do what they do\nso that i you know so it's easy to\nempathize with them you know you can\nunderstand the processes of why people\ndo what they do but accountability is\nalso really important um and\ni was put in a situation for my partner\nwhere i was forced to hold myself\naccountable to the decisions that i was\nmaking and so whilst it's really\nimportant that we you know are very\nreflective we also have to be\naccountable for our decisions you know\nand again this this relates directly to\nyour work as well about you know it's\nall well and good understanding what we\nshould do\nbut if we want to see those positive\nbenefits in our own life and we want to\nyou know hit the targets that we want\nand\nimprove ourselves in the way that we\nwant to improve ourselves we have to be\naccountable to ourselves\nand when we view veganism\nfrom the position of the individual\nwho's who's suffering when we think\nabout the animal and we view veganism\nobviously there's so many benefits to\nourselves and we're as in an individual\nmaking that change but when we view\nveganism from the perspective of the\nperson who suffers as a consequence of\nthe decision that we make when it comes\nto buying animal products\nthat's where that accountability has to\ncome in to say i understand why i should\ndo it you know i'm going to research how\nto do it sustainably and healthily and\nthen the final piece of the puzzle is to\nbe accountable to ourselves to our own\nmorals but accountable to them they\ncan't talk to us they can't communicate\nyou know a chicken can't say please\ndon't do this\nbut if they could they would they would\nyou know and they vocalize it in ways\nthat we recognize you know for the the\ncries and the screams and the actions\nand the body movements but we don't see\nit so it's hard to be accountable to\nsomething that we don't see that's out\nof sight and out of mind so connect with\nit\nyou know think deeply about these issues\nand then yeah accountability on our\nbehalf to say\ni need to push myself in ways that might\nseem a little bit inconvenient that\nmight not be that comfortable look you\nknow that might be a little bit you know\ndaunting at the beginning but the\nbenefit of doing that isn't just the\nbenefit to ourselves it's to them and\nthey don't have a choice we have the\nchoice the power to dictate what they\nhave to go through or ultimately what\nthey don't have to go through yeah you\nknow what the most beautiful thing about\nthis interview is being that we've been\ntalking about something that can be very\ndivisive it can be quite difficult but\nall i'm feeling is a sense of like more\ncompassion in my heart like overall like\ni'm walking away from this interview\ngoing i just need to be more\ncompassionate with everyone like you\nknow with animals of course but\nthe way you've been sharing this with me\nat least i just want people to know who\nare listening that sitting across from\nthe table from ed\nall i'm feeling is the aura and energy\nof compassion\nlove\nkindness\nand empathy is what i'm feeling from\nyour heart and voice and so anyone who's\nnot been in the room with me and just\nhearing a conversation without the\nemotion that you feel when you're with\nsomeone i just want everyone who's\nlistening or watching to know that and\nso i'm walking away wanting to be more\nof all of that in my life as a whole\ndefinitely and if that's all you take\naway from this episode then i hope that\nthat's the beginning of uh your journey\nto loving all\nthank animals and\nthank you thank you so much for
