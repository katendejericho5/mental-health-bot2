    "transcript": "the more research the more spending the\nmore Specialties the more drugs and the\nmore surgery we do the sicker we are\ngetting the confusion is the point that\nis so scary she is one of the world's\nforemost experts in metabolic Health Dr\nCasey means what is my body afraid of we\nhave to be asking that question before\nwe reach for the Advil something wild\nthat very few people know is that\nhey everyone I've got some huge news to\nshare with you in the last 90 days\n79.4% of our audience came from viewers\nand listeners that are not subscribed to\nthis channel there's research that shows\nthat if you want to create a habit make\nit easy to access by hitting the\nSubscribe button you're creating a habit\nof learning how to be happier healthier\nand more healed this would also mean the\nabsolute world to me and help us make\nbetter better bigger brighter content\nfor you in the world subscribe right now\nthe number one Health and Wellness\npodcast Jett J shett the one the only\nJett hey everyone welcome back to on\npurpose the place that you come to\nbecome happier healthier and more healed\ntoday's guest is someone that I've been\nlooking forward to have on the show for\naround a year now because I know that\nlistening to this conversation is going\nto increase the good energy in your life\nif you're someone who wants to invite\nbetter energy better frequencies into\nyour life this episode is for you if\nyou're someone who wants to understand\nhow you can improve your health both\nphysical and mental this conversation is\nfor you and if you're one of those\npeople who started to think there's too\nmuch there's overwhelming information\nthere's too much data there's too much\nto digest this conversation is for you\nbecause we're going to simplify what our\nbiggest health challenges are today I'm\ntalking to the one and only Casey means\nMD a Stanford trained physician and\nco-founder of levels a health technology\ncompany with the mission of reversing\nthe world's metabolic Health crisis\nCasey devotes her life to tackling the\nroot cause of why Americans are sick\nshe's been featured in The New York\nTimes the New Yorker The Wall Street\nJournal Forbes Women's Health and many\nmore today we're talking about Casey's\nbook which is all about metabolic Health\ncalled good energy if you don't have\nthis book you're going to want to read\nit as you hear this conversation go and\ngrab your copy right now welcome to on\npurpose Casey means Casey thank you so\nmuch for doing this thank you so much\nfor having me Jay it's such a joy as I\nsaid I've been following your work for\naround a year probably even more now and\nI said to my team I was like I need to\ntalk to Casey I feel like she has\ninsights that we need to understand and\nI want to dive straight into it you talk\nabout you say this you say don't trust\nthe doctors you say don't trust the\nscience s and you say don't even trust\nme who do we trust the answer to that\nquestion is that we need to start\ntrusting\nourselves we are living in an\nenvironment right now in the United\nStates where chronic illness is rampant\nacross our children across adults across\nthe elderly we know that something is\nnot quite right we're spending over $4\ntrillion doar on healthc care every year\nand our population is getting sicker\nwe're getting heavier we're getting more\ndepressed we're even becoming more\ninfertile life expectancy is going down\nand it seems that the more we do the\nsicker we're actually getting so my call\nto action for people is that we really\nneed to start trusting ourselves and\nwhat do I what do I mean by that we are\nliving in a time where there is\ninformation tools and technology that\nexists that can give every single person\nthe power to understand their bodies in\nways that has never been possible\nthroughout all of human history there\nare Technologies that let us see inside\nour bodies every single day like\nwearables and biosensors and direct\nconsumer lab testing that can literally\nanswer the question for us am I healthy\nwhat do I need to do differently to\nachieve Optimal Health and it can\nsometimes sound scary to say oh my gosh\nI shouldn't trust the Health Care System\nbut we've produced Miracles but a key\nthing we need to understand is that a\nlot of the Miracles that we think of\nwhen we think of the Healthcare System\nthey are for acute issues they are are\nthings historically like infectious\ndisease uh and emergencies and traumas\nwhere that thing is going to kill you\nimmediately and when the Health Care\nsystem intervenes in that\nsituation it's miraculous and and when\nyou look at the increase in life\nexpectancy over the last 100 years it is\nvery much predicated on cures for acute\nissues things like sanitation practices\nemergency surgeries antibiotics and the\nlike but if you if you actually take\nthose causes death out of the out of the\nequation life expectancy hasn't actually\nchanged that much in the past 100 years\nunfortunately though in the past 50\nyears or so chronic conditions these\nconditions that last for years and years\nand years they have gone up\nexponentially this is the things like\ncancer and heart disease and stroke and\nAlzheimer's dementia and depression and\nchronic pain that are just absolutely\nplaguing our country and our leading\ncauses of death and\nunfortunately in the way our Healthcare\nSystem is designed right now as we\nactually spend more money and more\neffort on addressing and treating these\nconditions the rates of these conditions\nare actually going up so a chapter in my\nbook is called trust yourself not your\ndoctor and the point of this is that\nwhen it comes to Chronic conditions\nunfortunately the Health Care system\ndoes not deserve our trust because the\ntreatment of these chronic conditions\nhas been an abject failure and I think\nthe easiest way to kind of really paint\nthe picture of all of this and how I've\ncome to this somewhat radical conclusion\nis actually to just share a personal\nstory if you don't mind it's actually\nabout my mother and I think it really I\nthink this story is something that most\nAmericans can probably see themselves in\num I think it really is emblematic of\nwhy our Health Care system is broken and\na path\nforward so my mother her story really\nstarts when she was about 40 and she had\nme and I was actually a 12b baby I was\nborn very very large one of the largest\nbabies of the hospital i' ever seen and\nmy mom had gained about 70 pounds during\nher pregnancy and in her 40s she had a\nlot of trouble losing the baby weight in\nher late 40s she went through Perry\nmenopause and menopause it was very\ndifficult for her she had hot flashes\nshe had sleep symptoms the doctor said\nthere's very little we can do about this\nshe moves into her 50s she starts\ndevelop high cholesterol high LDL the\ndoctor says this is very normal for\npeople your age gives her a Statin very\ncommon medication that's prescribed 200\nmillion times per year in the United\nStates\nlater she gets into her late 50s she\nstarts developing high blood pressure\nshe gets an Ace inhibitor also very\ncommon it's almost like a right of\npassage these days to get a diagnosis of\nhigh blood pressure she moves into her\n60s and her blood her blood sugar starts\nRising the doctor says you now meet the\ncriteria for pre-diabetes but again this\nis very common it's it's a pre- disease\nand he gives her a prescription for\nmetformin she takes it religiously again\nvery common a medication that's\nprescribed 90 million times per year in\nthe United\nStates then she turns in 70 and she's 72\nyears old and she's taking a hike with\nmy dad they took a nightly hike uh\noutside their home on the coast of\nNorthern California and she has a really\nsharp pain in her belly and it lasted\nfor a few days so she went to the doctor\nand the doctor said this is pretty\natypical for you you've never had this\nbefore let's get a CT\nscam and later that night she gets a\ntext message with the results of her CT\nscam and the result said that she had\nstage four widely metastatic pancreatic\ncancer and 13 days lat she was dead and\nthis was almost 3 years ago to the day\nand at the time of her death she was\nseeing what people would arguably say\nare the best doctors in the country she\nwas getting executive physicals at Mayo\nClinic she was seeing doctors at\nStanford and paloalto Medical Foundation\nshe was getting quote unquote the best\ncare in the country and they looked at\nmy family when this happened and they\nsaidwe are so sorry this is so unlucky\nand the question I have is is it really\nunlucky and in our conventional Paradigm\nin our conventional Health Care system\nin the west the the system that I was\ntrained in at Stanford Medical School it\ndoes seem unlucky the pancreatic cancer\nseems almost random and she had all\nthese things crop up and you know she\nwas getting standard of care and\nactually excellent care she was getting\nwhat the guidelines said the medication\nshe was taking them people were turning\nlittle knobs on her bi markers and then\nthe cancer cropped up and it just seemed\nso out of the blue she was 72 and\nactually many doctors would have said\nshe's healthy because she was on all her\nmedications but the vision that I really\nyou know want to put forward and the\nreason I think we need to start trusting\nourselves more is that through a\ndifferent\nframework we actually see as we look at\nthe underlying root cause physiologic\nconnections between everything my mom\nwas dealing with and so many other\nthings that are plaguing Americans today\nin and torturing Our Lives they are\nfundamentally rooted in the same thing\nand that thing is what I present as what\nI call bad energy in the book otherwise\nknown as metabolic dysfunction a\nfundamental problem with how our 40\ntrillion cells produce energy to let\nthem do their work in the body and the\nbeauty of why we can trust ourselves\nmore in the healthcare system is because\nwe have tools now to our metabolic\nHealth in great granularity for\nourselves and unfortunately the Health\nCare system because it is focused on a\nsiloed intervention based system based\non really looking at all these diseases\nweeds that Croc up crop up that we play\nwack with um with drugs and\ninterventions we focus on that instead\nof actually focusing on the underlying\nbad energy that's connecting so many of\nthe conditions that we're facing today\nand this is sign science based this is\nbased on the research when you really\nlook at almost every uh chronic symptom\nchronic disease facing Americans today\nthey are directly linked back to\nmetabolic dysfunction and that is\nsomething that each of us can understand\num with simple tools and simple\nunderstanding in our lives now but\nunfortunately is not a paradigm in which\nthe modern American Medical system\noperates so they are going to miss these\nearly warning signs like my mom had the\nenormous baby literally called FAL fetal\nmacrosomia big bodied baby that is a\ndirect sign of metabolic dysfunction bad\nperimenopausal and menopausal symptoms\ninability to lose the baby weight high\ncholesterol high blood sugar uh high\nblood pressure and ultimately Cancer all\nof them are connected so this is really\na vision for healthcare about\nempowerment about learning to understand\nyour own body about not waiting\nunfortunately for the Monumental size of\nthe health your system to turn the arrow\nbecause right now unfortunately it's not\nincentivized to and so it's really up to\nus to understand this core physiology of\nour own bodies and work to improve it\nand it's actually so much simpler than\npeople think it's something that each of\nus can do and it can really unleash that\ninternal metabolic life force within\nourselves to help us reach our highest\npurpose absolutely thank you so much for\nsharing that story too I mean hearing\nthat it's it's heartbreaking because I\nassume you believe it's avoidable I\nassume you believe and what you're\nsharing here the vision is that it\ndidn't have to go that way and I can\nimagine with what you know now and what\nyou're sharing that can be hard to deal\nwith for anyone who's listening or\nwatching right now who almost thinks\nit's gone too far how much can what\nyou're sharing help reverse certain\nimpacts I think one of the best ways\nthat I can actually address that\nquestion and the answer to the question\nis yes so much of this is reversible is\nto actually share a Dost statement which\nis that living beings are processes not\nentities so we have been very much I\nthink in our honestly despir Western\nculture we've we've we look at the body\nas a thing a thing that is separate from\neverything else in the world\nand a thing that is static and thing\nthat lives and dies and the reality of\nthe biology and the chemistry is that\nthat's just could not be farther from\nthe truth we are a dynamic swirl of\nmatter that's constantly giving and\nexchanging and taking matter and energy\nfrom the environment in a constant\nprocess and the reason this is relevant\nto the reversal of chronic diseases that\nevery single day we get the opportunity\nthrough our choices to rebuild the next\nversion of this\nprocess and we literally eat 70 metric\ntons of food in our lifetime 70 metric\ntons and that is the material from the\nenvironment from the earth from the\ncosmos that we are taking in through\neating and digestion to literally 3D\nprint the next version of our body and\nwhen we 3D print a body that has what it\nneeds that has the right building blocks\nthe right chemical molecular Messengers\nand food to essentially Express a\nhealthy version of the body we have that\nand so I think thinking of ourselves as\na process a process that is constantly\nmaking choices to build a healthier\nversion of the body we realize that we\nare we can absolutely have a different\nvision for our future than what we have\ntoday our our genetic code is and our\ncells are there to build and produce and\nexpress the healthiest version of\nourself possible but health is fun\nfundamentally a matching problem if we\nmatch the needs and expectations of the\ncells with what we are giving them\nthrough molecular information of food\nthrough energetic information through\nsunlight through the words we expose\nourselves to um through how we interact\nwith those around us and how and the\nphysical signals of exercise and\nmovement if we give the cells what\nthey're needing we can express health so\num so the answer is absolutely yes and\nwhen you look at the data what you\nactually see is that many many people\nwho are learning about the science of\nmetabolic health and ways that we can\nshape our diet and lifestyle to improve\nour health what we find is that people\nare putting their type 2 diabetes into\nemission people are slowing the rate of\nuh how quickly Alzheimer's is developing\nuh people can of course reverse obesity\nand so it's really about um giving\nyourselves what they need and expect to\nessentially build the healthiest version\nof themsel uh moving forward and I would\nalso just add when I was in medical\nschool one of the most impactful things\nthat I saw was our histology class which\nis the science of basically taking\nsections of the body like cut up\nsections of the body and putting them on\nslides and looking on the microscope and\nwhat you find there is that this concept\nof like we live and then we die is\nactually so false because when you look\nat a tissue a human tissue under the\nmicroscope what you actually see is that\nin one piece of tissue there are cells\nbeing born there are cells dying there\nare cells that are aging it's all\nhappening and and I think that's\nactually really hopeful because I think\nthere's this um there's an existential\ngrip of anxiety that lives within us as\nwesterners um and it's an existential\nanxiety about death like unlike so many\nother cultures Eastern cultures\nindigenous American cultures so many\nother cultures we are petrified of death\nwe don't have a curiosity about it and I\nthink the Health Care System actually\nreally weaponizes our our\nprofound fear of death against us\nbecause if you can convince people that\nyou live and you die and that's it you\ncan essentially get them do to do\nanything to avoid that fate which is\nunavoidable and it's also just happening\nkind of all the time and if you can hold\na pill or a surgery or something in\nfront of them that makes them think you\nknow this is my\nsalvation you can get them to do\nanything and another message that I have\nin the book is that part of our journey\nin health and our journey in healing is\nactually to unlock ourself from that\nexistential anxiety and to sort of see\nwhat the system is using and what it's\nusing against us to control us to turn\nus into desperate consumers looking for\nanything to amarate our existential\nsuffering and when we rise above that\nand have curiosity with it um I think we\nactually make much better health\ndecisions um because we realize that\nfundamentally I think we are Eternal\nLimitless processes in constant\ncontinuity with everything else in the\nuniverse and I think frankly that's just\nthe material reality of it but I think\nthere's also a spiritual Dimension to it\ntoo that can help us really unlock our\nhealth from a sense of abundance rather\nthan from Fear I mean that's such a\nfascinating perspective and obviously\none that I so deeply feel connected to\nand aligned with whether it's the\nphilosophies of reincarnation or past\nlives or whether it's karma whether it's\neven the simple understanding of as\nenergetic beings we're constantly as\nyou're saying a cell is in motion and\nand I want to get to that but I wanted\nto just clarify because I think you were\ndoing it there but I want to clarify for\nanyone who's listening and thinking Jay\nwhat is metabolic health and how does it\nmake sense in my daily life like I think\nwe've heard the term metabolism and most\nof us think about think about it as like\nhow quickly we burn energy but it's like\nwhat is metabolic Health in a very\nsimple way and how can we make sense of\nit as someone who's not educated in the\nfield yeah metabolic health is\nfundamentally how we convert food energy\nto Cellular energy so we have again like\n40 ion human cells and every single one\nof those cells needs cellular energy to\nfunction we have 40 trillion cells each\nof those cells is doing like trillions\nof chemical reactions every second and\nall of those need to be paid for and\nthey need to be paid for with energy and\nthat's energy that we convert from food\nenergy through our mitochondria to\nCellular energy which is called\nATP and the bubbling up of all of those\nchemical reactions all of which require\nenergy to happen the bubbling up of that\nis our lives that's what it is death is\nthe absence of metabolism without that\nunderlying life force in ourselves we'd\nliterally just fall apart and melt\nthat's what death is so anything that\nhurts our mitochondria hurts our\nmetabolic functioning is like\nessentially inching closer to the Grave\nit's like being a little bit dead while\nwe're alive and unfortunately right now\n93%\nof American adults are dealing with\nmetabolic dysfunction the modern world\nhas changed so much in the past 100\nyears on every level industrialized ultr\nprocessed food making up 70% of our\ncalories we're getting two hours less\nper sleep two hours less of sleep per\nnight than we were 100 years ago we are\nOutdoors about 7% of our time in a\n24-hour period we are sitting the vast\nmajority of our time there are 80,000 or\nmore synthetic chemicals that have\nentered our food water Air Supply\npersonal care products we're also living\nin this Thermon neutral existence now\nwith no big swings in temperature so\nthat thermal energy signal to our cells\nhas completely been cut off we have\nreally little heat really little cold we\nlike it at 72 degrees so every Vector of\nthe environment in which our cells are\nliving in has changed and the message\nthat I want to share is that when you\nreally dig deep into the science the way\nthat all those changes in our\nenvironment are actually harming our\nhealth is by directly hurting the\nmitochondria that beautiful part of our\ncell that converts food energy to\nCellular energy to power our lives so\nmetabolism is our life force metabolism\nis the process of creating the energy\nthat powers everything we do how we move\nhow we love how we think all of it and I\nlike to think of it actually in like a\nbigger picture to and a picture that\ninspires me so much to want to share\nabout the mitochondria share about\nmetabolism which is that if we think of\nfood as the environment and we think of\nfood as this sort of structure in the\ncosmos and we also think of food for\nwhat it really is which is which is\nplant matter that has\ntaken photons that have travel traveled\n92 million miles through space from a\nstar hit the Chlor\ninside of plants and then has been\nconverted that Photon that light energy\nhas been converted into the carboncarbon\nbonds of plants it's literally stored\nlight in these bonds of plants we either\neat that or animals we eat eat that and\nfundamentally it channels into US\nunlocking the Sun's light energy in our\nmitochondria so that we can have the\nthoughts feelings the cre creativity to\nspread our light in this world our\npersonal light and to reach our highest\npurpose and so we are the mitochondria\nthe metabolic Machinery is fundamentally\nthe end product the the the machine that\nunlocks the sun's energy within us and\nsomething wild that very few people know\nis that mitochondria are actually light\nemitting organel if you take receptors\nand put them near the mitochondria they\nactually release weak Photon energy so\nwe are emitting light and what is so\ndevastating about the chronic disease\nepidemic that is almost entirely rooted\nin mitochondrial dysfunction bad energy\nmetabolic dysfunction insulin resistance\nall the same thing is that in a sense\nit's\nblocking what I think one of our core\nmiraculous purposes is as humans to\nunlock light and have the energy and the\ninternal life force to reach our highest\npurpose so we can talk all day about you\nknow insulin resistance and and these\nsort of very clinical terms but I think\nit's really important to back up and\nsort of see that this chronic disease\nepidemic which is fueled by our bodies\nnot being able to handle the changes in\nmodernity and a Health Care System\nunfortunately that is fully financially\nincentivized to not focus on root cause\nphysiology and instead focused on waca\nmedicine it's not only hurting us making\nus have shorter lives Mak us have sicker\nlives it's actually stopping us from\nbeing converters of light and I think\nthe natural reaction when everyone hears\nthat going back to your earlier point is\nthat is so scary yeah because if I can't\ntrust the system if the food has changed\nas you said it rightly has our modern\nlives with sleep and social media and\nTechnology have taken over and so I\nthink fear becomes the natural reaction\nand I don't think that anyone would be\nseen as weak for having that fear\nbecause it feels like the most natural\nreaction and response to the State of\nAffairs and so when someone's feeling\nthis and they're hearing this and\nthey're thinking I'm scared I remember\nwhen I was working with the client and\nsomething I do when I'm coaching clients\nis I make sure that we've had all their\nbiomarkers tested they're working with a\nholistic health coach I don't don't\nbelieve that they should be working on\ntheir Mental Health in a silo and some\nclients will say to me they'll say I\ndon't want to know like I I don't want\nto know and I'll ask them why and\nthey'll say because I'm scared what I'm\ngoing to find out and it's a really\ninteresting part of our society like\nyou're saying in the extreme case that\nultimately we're scared of death but our\nfear of death makes us fearful of trying\nto live healthy because we don't even\nwant to know that we might have an early\nstage of a chronic disease or a terminal\nillness and so where do we start\nassessing and reconstructing our\nrelationship with that fear and with\nthat anxiety that comes with just I\ndon't know where to start well a key\nmessage I want to share with people is\nthat it's actually so much so much\nsimpler than we've been led to believe\nand the system actually benefits so much\nfrom us being confused and thinking that\nthis is complicated that it paralyzes us\nthere's been research that shows that\nclose to 60% of Americans totally doubt\ntheir choices about the nutritional\nintake because they are so confused\nevery day on social media I get people\nsaying I literally have no idea what is\nsafe to eat they say kale is not safe to\neat oats are not safe to eat obviously\nmeat is not safe to eat basically\nthere's nothing left and what we need to\nrealize is the\nconfusion is intentional the confusion\nis intentional because the\nconfusion essentially asks us to\nabdicate our internal knowing about\nwhat's right to us what's right for us\nto experts and that's not working right\nbecause like I said The more we spend on\nHealthcare the more research we publish\non disease on nutrition on exercise the\nmore medical Subs Specialties we invent\nthere are now over over 42 Medical subp\nSpecialties so the more research the\nmore spending the more Specialties the\nmore drugs and the more surgery we do\nthe sicker we are getting the confusion\nis the point and so the more we're doing\nthe more confused we're getting and\nmeanwhile we are being asked to\nessentially be divorced from our\ninternal knowing and our common sense\nabout what is right for us if you sit\ndown at a dinner table in front of a\nbeautiful meal prepared with love with\npeople you love and it's from the\nfarmers market and it's freshly prepared\nyou know that is healthy you know that\nis good for you we are now being so\nconfused that we sit down and we might\nsee the kale and think oh my God but the\noxalates that might hurt me you know and\nyou get good sleep you feel incredible\nthe next day you walk outside first\nthing in the morning instead of getting\nstraight on your computer you feel\nincredible we actually know what is\nhealthy but we have been so put through\nthe washing machine of you know the cult\nof evidence-based medicine and you know\ntrust the experts trust the science that\nwe are so petrified to trust ourselves\nall you need to all you need to do is\nlook at the wild there is no chronic\ndisease epidemic or obesity epidemic\namongst any other animal species in the\nworld and they have no experts no\nresearch no doctors no chronic disase\nepidemics and it's because there's an\nintuitive sense of what to do that we\nhave been told hold to distrust so I\nthink there's two main things that\npeople can do to really get back\nto understanding what their body is\nsaying so the first is free it involves\nno weables no Tech you know no lab tests\nit's literally just reorienting to\nrealize that symptoms are a gift every\nsymptom you're feeling is a signal from\nthe body it is a way of the body\ncommunicating with you to tell you that\nit needs something different when the\nneeds of the cells are met we have\nhealth and when we do not meet the needs\nof the cells or we overburden them with\ntoxins or things that they can't handle\nwe get illness so we have been told to\nsmash symptoms if you have a headache\ntake an Advil if you have indigestion\ntake an ad acid you know if your knee\nhurts grab an anti-inflammatory\nmedication migraine take it's all about\nkilling symptoms instead of looking at\nthem with\ncuriosity we really need to realize that\nall symptoms necessarily and\nfundamentally come from cellular\ndysfunction they can't arise out of thin\nair they are a result of cells not\nfunctioning properly so when you have a\nsymptom you need to basically just ask\nyourself what is my body trying to tell\nme what is my body trying to tell me and\nthen realize that it's a pretty limited\nset of things that we can actually go to\nto meet the needs of the cells and one\nof the Frameworks I love is to think of\nmy 40 trillion cells as like my babies\nthey're like my children and I'm the\nmother like the whole me is the mother\nand the cells are all my little children\nand together somehow they make up me but\nbabies can't speak to you with words so\nthey they cry when they need something\nand like any mother or father knows you\njust will quickly run through your\nchecklist if the baby's crying does it\nneed a diaper change does it need milk\ndoes it need to sleep is the temperature\noff you fix those things you run to the\nchecklist it's not an infinite list and\nthen the crying stops and the way that\nour cells are crying is through these\nchronic symptoms and diseases that we\nhave and the way that we approach the\ncells is through the simple things that\nwe can do every day it's how has the\nfood been are we eating the most\nnutritious unprocessed real food that is\norganic and not covered in pesticides\nare we avoiding the Unholy Trinity of\nfoods that Crush our cellular function\nsugar refined Ultra processed grains\nrefined industrial seed oils food got it\nokay how's my food been sleep am I\ngetting enough sleep am I getting enough\nquality quantity and consistency of\nsleep movement have I been moving have I\nbeen moving my body regular throughout\nthe day or have I been stuck in a chair\nchair yesterday today just planted and\nnot moving my body how's my stress have\nI been expressing good boundaries have I\nbeen controlling what I'm looking at on\nsocial media have I been letting lots of\nfear inducing sensationalist media into\nmy eyes have I gone to therapy this week\nhave I been reading my sacred or\ninspirational texts that keep me\ngrounded\ntoxins have I been exposing myself to\ntoxins have I been using you know the\nsynthetic air fresheners and putting all\nthe scented lotions on my body and\neating non-organic food and not\nfiltering my water and being around a\nlot of air pollution take stock of that\nso you look at really these these five\nmain controllable pillars of food sleep\nexercise stress\ntoxins and take stock take honest stock\nhow are you treating your C and why are\nthey why are they crying with these\nsymptoms so number one is look at your\nsymptoms as a gift start to interpret\nhow your body is talking to you how your\ncells are talking to take honest stock\nof how you're living and then change\ncourse and I think many people will find\nthat when you do that you realize oh my\nGod there's actually a lot of little\nthings I could be doing I need to get a\ngood night's sleep I need to drink some\nwater I need have a nutritious meal I\nneed to take a few deep breaths and a\nlot of things actually will get a lot\nbetter with that the second piece is a\nlittle more Technical and this is\nhearing your body through tools and\nTechnology that's only been available to\nus for like the past two to three years\nincredible technology that can tell us\nmore about our body and the inner\nworkings of ourselves than our doctors\nhave ever even been able to know about\nus so this includes things like\nwearables that can tell us about our\nheart rate variability our step count\nour heart rate and our sleep this is\nbiosensors which are brand new in our\nworld and and accessible for the first\ntime ever and right now there's really\nonly one main biosensor which is called\na continuous glucose monitor there will\nbe more in the future but this can\nliterally tell us an internal lab test\nof our body show it to us on our phone\nour glucose levels 24 hours a day and\ntell us exactly how the foods are eating\nand the way we're living and how we're\nsleeping is affecting this key metabolic\nbiomarker and then we now have direct\nconsumer lab testing where we can see\nlike a hypergranular picture of our\nmetabolic\nHealth without even having to like beg\nour doctor for these tests so you can\nreally get a sense of whether your body\nis is expressing bad energy and do that\nthrough the few a few clicks of buttons\non the computer so I would argue that\nit's actually the most exciting time to\nbe alive and I have nothing but optimism\nabout the future of Health for everyone\nevery single person living because\nthrough the framework of seeing your\nsymptoms as a gift and understanding the\nmodern tools and Technology uh that\nexists today and that we have access to\nwe have the potential to actually live\nthe longest happiest most vibrant lives\nI think in human history I'm glad you\nI'm glad you went in that direction it's\nit's definitely uplifting and and\nenergizing and but going back to the\nfirst one talking about killing the\nsymptoms I I think you're spot on there\nlike hearing you talk about that I'm\nthinking how easy it is to reach for a\npainkiller how easy it is to kill the\nsymptom as you said how what is actually\nhappening\nwhen we take an Advil like what actually\nhappens oh great question so an Advil is\na what's called an nid a nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory\nmedication and essentially what it's\ndoing is it is decreasing the levels of\nsome of these Downstream inflammatory\nmolecules in our body specifically\nthings like called prostaglandins and um\nthe details actually aren't that\nnecessary to know but it's essentially\ninhibiting an enzyme called a enzyme\nthat produces these chemicals in the\nbody that are inflammatory and because\ninflammation is a process in the body\nthat can uh that can create the\nsensation of pain in our nerves Um this\ncan then help and I actually think I'm\nso I'm so glad you asked this question\nbecause when we're thinking about\nsymptoms as gifts so often the thing we\nreach for to kill symptoms is an\nanti-inflammatory medication it is the\nAdvil it is the the Tylenol or the\nFlexeril or whatever it is yeah the\nMotrin and I really want people to step\nback and think about the concept of\ninflammation for a second inflammation\nis the immune cells of the body revving\nup a huge response essentially a war in\nthe body in response to some type of\nthreat\ninflammation fundamentally is\nbiochemical\nfear and inflammatory conditions are\ntotally overlapped with metabolic\nconditions in a way I talk about in my\nbook The the trifecta of bad energy the\nthings that actually lead to metabolic\nand dysfunction in the body are three\nthings that I talk about in the book\nwhich are chronic inflammation\nmitochondrial dysfunction and what's\ncalled oxidative stress which is\nreactive damaging molecules in the body\ntogether\nthose all work together to create\nmetabolic dysfunction and chronic\ninflammation is one of those things and\nif we think of inflammation for what it\nis which is the cells of the body being\nafraid of something what we have to ask\nourselves as individuals is what is my\nbody afraid\nof we have to be asking that question\nbefore we reach for the Advil because we\ncan often identify it very quickly maybe\nit's afraid of the fact that it's\nstaring at War imagery on this device in\nyour\nhand like literally 10 hours a day that\nwe are literally having to\ninternalize the the suffering of 8\nbillion people through a device that we\nhold in our hands in our bed we know\nthat that imagery literally creates\nchronic inflammation in the body you\ntalked about this with Michelle Obama\nabout how we're we're like we're having\nto process like what was it like\nterabytes of\ninflammation but then going through the\nrest of the list is the fear maybe the\nsynthetic toxic glyphosate pesticide\nthat's covering the food the Cheerios\nthat you're eating is it the fact that\nyou got 5 hours of sleep last night and\nyour body's like holy crap like I'm so\ntired this is what is wrong what is\ngoing on is it the toxins in the\nenvironment so if we think of\ninflammation as biochemical fear and we\nask ourselves why am I taking this\nanti-inflammatory medication instead of\njust asking myself what is causing my\nbody fear right now it will lead us down\nsuch a more empowering path of truly\nwith\ncompassion giving the body what it needs\nto feel safe as opposed to hitting this\nsystem that is trying to help us over\nthe head with a hammer of medication\nthat will not take the fear away it will\nonly numb the reaction the body is\nhappening is having to something very\nreal that's that's a fantastic answer\nI'm so glad I asked it as well because I\nthink I think that's the challenge right\nit's become such a habit it's become\nsuch a automated response to just reach\nfor it and what's even more worrying\nabout it is this idea\nthat we are disconnecting every time\nfrom from our intuition from\nour communication with our body to\ncommunication with all the cells and\nwhat they're trying to say and the more\nwe disconnect the harder it is to\nreconnect every single day when you're\nhaving that\nexperience and I feel like we've tried\nas time has gone on to treat our body\nlike technology so if my phone is\nglitching out I'm not trying to deduce\nwhy that is I'll just refresh the app\nand I know if I shut off this app and I\nreset it and switch it on again it's\ngoing to hopefully go back to normal and\nso there's very little areas in our life\nthese days that we ever try to consider\nthe root of the issue because we don't\nhave to in so many areas anymore what\nabout antibiotics and our gut microbiome\nas well because I believe there's a\nconnection there and I wanted to know\nfor people and maybe there's others like\nI think Advil is very common and the\ngenerics in the United States are very\ncommon but what are are those\nother easy generic meds that we're kind\nof dialing into that the majority of\nAmericans are that you think are causing\nthis disconnection as well Advil is\nobviously one of the popular ones what\nare the other ones antibiotics came to\nmy mind but they may not be the ones in\na sense I would argue that almost every\nmedication that we're prescribing for\nchronic\nconditions is representing this\ndisconnect that we're having right now\nand I'm not anti- medication but it's\nthe framework that we have it's the\nframework that we have that's causing\nthe problem and that actually feeds\nstraight into the pharmaceutical\ncompany's bottom lines but not\nnecessarily into the bottom line of\nhuman thriving and I think all you have\nto do is just look at the reality of\nwhat is happening which is that how does\nthe healthare system work if you have\ndepression you see a psychiatrist and\nyou get an SSRI if you have polycystic\novarian syndrome you see the OB OBGYN\nand you either get colam or uh birth\ncontrol pills if you have high\ncholesterol you see the cardiologist you\nget a Statin if you have high blood\npressure you see the cardiologist you\nget an Ace inhibitor if you have obesity\nyou see the Obesity specialist you get\nwovi it goes on and on and on if you\nhave diabetes you see the\nendocrinologist you get metformin and\nso the thing that people need to\ninternalize is\nthat in that system the more of those\ndrugs we're prescribing for those\nsymptoms\nthe rates of all those conditions are\nincreasing as we prescribe those\nmedications this is the definition of\nunsustainability this is the definition\nof at a societal level this approach not\nworking absolutely for individuals some\nof those medications will help them\nthere's no question there are people I\nknow who have depression who got on SSRI\nand they felt a lot better and it gave\nthem the motivation they needed to make\nthe other changes but because these\ndrugs do not actually affect the\nphysiology that leads to the disease\nthey just manage the downstream\nmanifestation of the physiology in a\nsymptom specific way they don't actually\nhelp us solve the real problem and in\nevery one of those cases we know that\ndietary and lifestyle interventions\nwhich actually get at the trifecta of\nbad energy which actually quell and meet\nthe quell those issues and meet the\nneeds of the\ncell that in many cases those work as\nwell or better than the medication\nthemselves there is good research in\nCochran reviews which is a an\norganization that does huge metaanalyses\nof of research that shows that simply\nexercising 150 minutes per week is\nequivalent to an SSRI for the treatment\nof depression and instead of having a 20\nplus per side effect profile of ssris\nthere's a less than 2% side effect\nprofile with exercise which is also kind\nof amusing to think about that the side\neffect profile is like you know feeling\nsore right but it's not like something\nlike gaining a bunch of weight or losing\nyour libido like what you might have\nwith SSRI so you there are different\napproaches for these things that\nactually would not only get at those\ndiseases but also ease the physiology\nthat's leading to these other things and\nI think what people it's both empowering\nand scary to realize that a lot of the\nsmaller annoying symptoms that we deal\nwith when we're younger like the the\nPCOS which is the leading cause of\ninfertility in the United States so many\npeople I'm sure this is happening in\nyour friend group too like so many\npeople are dealing with infertility and\ngetting IVF erectile dysfunction gout\nmigraine chronic pain depression anxiety\nthese sort of annoying but non-lethal\nsymptoms are often they often can be the\nwarning signs of that physiology\nhappening that will become louder cries\nlater it will become the things the real\ndiagnoses like the high cholesterol and\nthe high blood pressure and the high\nglucose that then\ncan be the loudest cries of all later in\nlife which are the things that kill us\nwhich is the stroke the actual heart\nattack the Alzheimer's dementia the\ncancer The Chronic liver disease the\nchronic kidney disease the chronic lower\nrespiratory infections these things all\nof which are on the spectrum they are\neither caused by or accelerated by\nmetabolic dysfunction that's a statement\nof scientific fact that our system in\nits intervention-based\nmodel conveniently ignores and I think\ntwo things I would just mention to kind\nof help people really internalize this\nso people might say like okay you're\nsaying a lot here like you're saying\nthat gout and Alzheimer's are on the\nsame spectrum and or that cancer and\nPCOS are on the same Spectrum but what\nwe need to realize is that the the body\nhas over 200 cell types we have over 200\nI think it's 221 different types of\ncells in the body we've got um we've got\nthe retinal cell we've got the gal cell\nin the brain the asites in the brain\nwe've got endothelial cells that line in\nour blood vessels we've got hepatocytes\nin the liver we've got ovarian Thea\ncells in the ovaries we've got all these\ndifferent cell types which very\namazingly all came from one cell which\nis awesome um and differentiated into\nthese different cell types and like I\nsaid earlier every single cell needs\nenergy to function properly so if\nmitochondrial dysfunction by because of\nour environment is happening in the\nbody based on which cell type it's\nhappening in the ovarian cell the asite\nand the brain the endothelial cell in\nthe penis the retinal cell it can look\nlike almost anything it's like the great\nmascor because an underpowered cell in\nthe brain can look like Alzheimer's\nchronic pain\ndepression uh mayrain uh depression uh\nuh anxiety a underpowered cell in the\nliver can look like fatty liver disease\nan underpowered cell in the ovary can\nlook can express as infertility an\nunderpowered cell in the endothelial\nlining of the penile artery can look\nlike erectile dysfunction a\ndysfunctional cell can look like a\nmillion different things but these are\nbranches of fundamentally the same tree\nand the secret is which is the secret\nthat I'm on this planet to share is that\nif we focus our energy on healing that\nunderlying process it actually would\nmake things so much simpler\nunfortunately it would very much change\nthe economic reality of the healthcare\nsystem which is why this isn't being\nadopted and not\nhappening um but that's not a problem we\nneed to take on we have the tools to\nactually outside of the system by\ntrusting ourselves get at that root\ncause which the system unfortunately\nbecause it is so large has no incentive\nto do and if you're open I I'd love to\nspeak to that for just one second like\nwhy the system because I think people\nmight say like doctors are good people\nand wouldn't the Healthcare System want\nus to be healthy and I think it it's\nit's really again this is not meant to\nbe scary it's meant to help people\nunderstand why they need to take\nownership of their own health at this\nmoment in time and I think it goes back\nto when I was in my surgical residency I\nwas training to become a head anex\nsurgeon nine years into medical school\nand\ntraining and I was heading out to start\nmy private practice and the Mantra that\neveryone said to me in the hospital from\nmy senior doctors was get ready because\nyou eat what you\nkill and what that means this very\ngrotesque Mantra it's a euphemism that\nmeans your livelihood is dependent on\nhow many surgeries you book and do you\neat what you kill so you obviously\naren't killing but your your your bottom\nline your entire income is just based on\nhow many surgeries you will do and how\nmany patients you can see and right now\nthe healthcare industry is a is a for\ntrillion doll industry it is the largest\nand fastest growing industry in the\nUnited States and it is a business it's\na business that's designed to grow and\nbased on the way that Healthcare is\nfinanced right now which is that we make\nmoney when we uh have more people in the\nsystem for a longer period of time\nhaving more things done to them chronic\ndisease is the ultimate Cash Cow for our\nsystem they is literally no Financial\nincentive to get a chronically ill\npatient out of the system which is why\nwow it's wild acute illnesses are no\nlonger like those they're in and out\nright but a chronic disease and\nespecially a chronic disease that starts\nin childhood which is now we're seeing\nso much more the most lucrative thing\nfor the largest industry and the fastest\ngrowing industry in the United States is\na chronically ill child which we are\nseeing those rates go up monumentally\n30% of young adults now have\npre-diabetes this is a disease that no\npediatrician in their entire career\nwould see 75 years ago 20% of kids have\nfatty liver disease this was a disease\nwe only used to see in in older\nalcoholics it's now the leading cause of\nliver transplants you know kids of\ncourse are dealing with Monumental\nmental health and behavioral\ncrisis the thing to to to note though\nhere is that I know probably at this\npoint hundreds of doctors that I've\nworked with and there's not a single bad\nperson I've ever really met in medicine\nlike every single person I know who went\nthrough all this training they all went\ninto the system to help people they all\nwent into the system to do good work and\nto cure and had the best\nintentions but the Stark economic\nreality is that the largest industry in\nUnited States which is designed to grow\nmakes more money when we are sick and\nmakes less money when we are healthy and\nwhat that does is create an in visible\nHand That clouds every element of how we\npractice medicine the United States and\nactually gets all of us and me in the\npast believing that it's all the right\nway and it's the best healthc care\nsystem in the country it clouds\neverything from how research is done how\nresearch studies are set up to how\ndoctors practice to what we're learning\nin medical school to how residency\ntraining happens and and how the\nguidelines are written and so\nfundamentally I think just having real\neyes open with what\nunderlies every element of the system\nand how your doctor might not even\nrealize how they're playing a a part in\nthis fundamentally intervention-based\nsystem is step one for making the\ndecision to take matters a little bit\nmore into your own hands and maybe bring\nyour doctor along with you on the\njourney but the reality is is that we\nhave an intervention-based system the\nsystem profits when we're\nsick metabolic dysfunction is the root\nof most of our syndroms and diseases in\nthe modern American world and it's quite\nsimple to fix talking about young people\nand I think that is a great place to\nstop and focus on because I think we\nwould hope that with all of the\ntechnological advancement and Healthcare\nadvancement that we'd be setting up the\nfuture generation for success and in\nsome of the research you Shar in the\nbook you also went on to share that 45%\nof teens are overweight or obese and 77%\nof Young Americans are too unfit to join\nthe military\nand this point really stood out to me\nthe generation born today is not on\ntrack to outlive their\nparents and that is a clear sign that\nthere's an issue because with all the\nother advancement that should be clear\nthat we should be able to outlive the\nprevious generations and you talk about\nhow there's seven policy changes that\nyou think could be executive orders that\nwould start to fix things tomorrow and I\nwanted to highlight a couple of them\nthat I think we could talk about because\nI think that it almost even if we\nrealize that currently it's in the\nindividual realm of influence that we\nneed to shift it's healthy for us to\nunderstand what those big challenges are\nso one of I mean the first one is Ban\nfarmer ads on news outlets currently 60%\nof I'll let you say number one ban\nfarmer ads on news outlets it's hard to\noverstate how important it would be for\nthe president the next president coming\nin into office to just sign an executive\norder that says ban\npharmaceutical spending towards\nadvertisement on TV the reason for this\nis very simple 60% of the advertising\ndollars that come into mainstream media\nare from the pharmaceutical industry and\nthis is this this is the point that just\nreally keeps me up at night the\ncustomer of the people making the news\nis not you\nit's the pharmaceutical company they are\npaying the bills they are the customer\nyou are the product and so because the\npharmaceutical company is is the\ncustomer the information that we are\ngetting from our news sources is going\nto be shaped to have a favorable message\nabout that industry and that trickles\ndown into culture that trickles down\ninto what we believe and what we think\nis normal normal and\nso unlike so many other countries in the\nworld that do not allow pharmaceutical\nadvertising on TV that simple shift\nwould change the way we're seeing and\ngetting information a and they could\nstill of course share about medical\nInnovation and drugs but not with a\nstrangle hold on their neck of their\nlivelihood of the dollars that produce\nthe show and I think a fascinating thing\nthat you you notice in culture recently\nis that Independent Media so people like\nyou people like Joe Rogan Barry Weiss\npeople who have independent platforms\nwhat are those platforms talking about\nfoundational Health they were the ones\nduring covid who are talking about the\nthings we can do to increase the\nresilience of the body and they are\nlistened to by way more people than the\nmainstream media but what's coming out\non the main media that's funded by\nPharma is a very pro- Fara message very\nlittle curiosity about what types of\ndietary and lifestyle strategies could\nimprove our biologic resilience against\nthings like a virus or otherwise so it's\nfascinating to see how Independent Media\nis focusing on empowering Health message\nand tens of millions of people are\nflocking to it and it is in many cases I\nmean you look at Joe Rogan and others\nlike just being absolutely demonized\nand called all sorts of names and then\nyou look at mainstream media and it's\none message every day all the time which\nis that salvation comes outside of us\nsalvation comes in an injection\nsalvation comes in a pill and it's\nactually\nanti-science to think that the little\nthings you might Dilly dle with like be\nout in the sunshine or sleep or eat\nhealthy food could actually help you\nthat's the message we're getting and\nthat's because the customer is one of\nthe largest Industries in the entire in\nthe entire world I mean when I moved to\nthe states I was absolutely shocked at\nthe advertising and I generally I mean I\ndon't really watch TV but when I was\nlooking at some of the ads it was almost\na parody like I was like this has to be\na parody like this this has to be satire\nthis can't be real because how can you\ntalk about all the benefits and then\nwhen you walk through all of the side\neffects and all of the potential\nconsequences may cause death may cause\nthis may caused that and I'm like this\nhas to be a joke like this this can't be\nserious like Ryan Reynolds must be at\nthe end of this advert and it must be\nsomething funny like it can't be real\nand it's fascinating to me that it is\nreal and that you it has been gotten\naway with for this long I wonder have\nyou ever looked at how and and again I'm\nnot expecting you to know this I'm just\nintrigued by it but have you ever looked\nat if that happen so if we ban farmer\nads on news outlets and those 60% of AD\nspots disappear or reappear with\nopportunities have you looked at how\nthat would affect the economy I'm just\nfascinated by what a dent it would have\non the GDP and the economy and and all\nof that because I I wonder the cost that\nthey're weighing up in their heads if if\nbased on what everything else you've\nsaid there will have to be a economic\nadjustment if and when we hopefully\nadopt a good energy framework for the\nfuture of\nhealthcare because right now there's a\nthere's a devil's bargain happening\nbetween over1 trillion dollar of\nIndustry the $4 trillion of Health Care\nHealth Care Sick\ncare and the six plus trillion dollars\nof processed food and Industrial\nagriculture which are a revolving door\nof financial support to each other you\ncreate people who are addicted to ultr\nprocessed foods that take them to their\nBliss point they start eating themselves\nto death they become customers to the\nHealth Care system and then the\nhealthare system does nothing to\nactually change the root cause of what's\nhurting them and they go back to being\nyou know going straight to the food and\nthe chemicals associated with industrial\nagriculture the ultr processed food\nindustry that's creating all this\nFranken food in the healthcare industry\nis are in a devil's bargain that all are\nkeeping hum sick and so yes I think that\nif we you really radically reimagined\nwhat it would look like to turn the\narrow of humanity in a better Direction\nit's going to change a lot of these\neconomics but what I'm really hopeful\nabout is that there's so many incredible\ncompanies that are\naligning profit with health absolutely\nthat's totally possible and one of one\nof the reasons that I co-founded levels\nHealth which is a company that allows\naccess for people to these continuous\nglucose monitors that help them\nunderstand exactly how the foods they're\neating are affecting their own metabolic\nHealth in real time is because it's an\nit's an example of a company that as we\nadd more value to people in\nunderstanding their health and their own\nbodies that's good for the company and\nyou see this across so many things\nyou've got the Inc incredible sleep\ncompanies happening you've got eight\nsleep you've got really incredible food\nbrands that are cropping up focus on\nregenerative good soil and low glycemic\nand no artificial chemicals you've got\nmeditation apps like Comm you've got so\nmany things cropping up and I think it's\njust going to have to be a reimagination\nof um of what what the economics of this\nlook like\nand I I will say like there have been\nefforts to try to to shift the Health\nCare System towards a model that aligns\nhuman health with um profit you may\nrecall that under Obama um under\nPresident Obama there was the Affordable\nCare Act and there was this effort to\ncreate what was called value-based care\nand value the definition of value is\nit's an equation that is outcomes over\ncost you want good outcomes for the\nlowest cost that would be a high value\nintervention and so the way they set\nthis up which is amazing like because\nright now it's fee for service you get\npaid as a doctor for what you do that\nwould have you get paid for adding value\nwhich is better outcomes over lower cost\nand there's nothing higher value in\nhealthcare than eating real unprocessed\norganic food that's just the reality if\nif people eat real food healthcare costs\nplummet and do all the other things\nsleep and move Etc so this is actually\nit's an unfortunate story that ends\npoorly but there was an effort to move\ntowards value-based care where doctors\nwould actually get paid significantly\nmore by Medicaid and reimbursed more for\ntheir work if they provided good\noutcomes over low cost this\nprogram got corrupted by the\npharmaceutical industry because when I\nlook at good outcomes as a doctor good\noutcomes for health I'm thinking about\none thing and one thing only which is\nare the cells of this person in front of\nme functioning better are they\nfunctioning properly is there a\nfunctional cellular biology happening\ninside this patient because if that's\nthe case they will not have symptoms or\ndisease unfortunately quality in this\nprogram was defined by things like\nmedication adherence so the outcome was\nactually co-opted to be actually how\nmany of the patients on the doctor's\npanel were on the appropriate long-term\nmedical therapy so for instance for\nasthma I remember one of the quality\nmetrics that a doctor could report on\nwas how what percentage of their\npatients with a diagnosis of asthma were\non longterm albuterol therapy so quality\ngot\ncalled basically like adherence to drug\nregimen as opposed to what quality\nreally is in health which is a body that\nis functioning properly and all doctors\nand all people need to realize\nthat a body on medication is not that's\nnot the that's not the outcome we want\nwe want a body that is healed cells that\nhave healed and that actually become\nfunctional and my mom is literally the\ndefinition of of this problem where\neveryone including her and all her\ndoctors thought they were practicing\ngood good outcome medicine where she was\non all her medications and all her\nlittle biomarkers the little knobs were\nbeing turned on her LDL and her glucose\nand her blood pressure but her cells\nnever healed and therefore she\nultimately got the cancer and she\nultimately died very prematurely so so\nthat's kind of um the framework I would\nI would say for for that yeah absolutely\nanother one that I want to push out\nwhich I think is in line with what\nyou're saying here is stop Federal\nfunding for academic departments who\ntake money from farma it is really\nwild the\nFDA which is a government agency\nand and many academic centers get up to\n75% of their budget from pharmaceutical\ncompanies so you you would think the FDA\nwould be fully funded by taxpayer money\nand they would have taxpayer interest in\nmind but again it's no and they did a\nthey did a report where they were over\n$181 million of conflicts of interests\nreported essentially research academic\nresearchers taking money from industry\nand these are academic and NIH\nresearchers and\nso right there it just changes who we're\nworking\nfor and so I think if people are going\nto\naccept federal dollars paid for by\ntaxpayers to do research or to do\nanything touching Health it it cannot\nalso be taking money from industry\nbecause then you end up having split\ninterests wow yeah I mean it it seems so\nobvious like it's almost so painful to\neven think that these basic measures\nthat seem like easy easily drawn\nparallels can't be stopped yeah and and\nthey haven't even got close well when\nyou think about the the realities of it\nand why these things haven't happened in\nin almost every single state in the\ncountry the elected Representatives a\nhuge percentage of their constituency is\nemployed by food farming or Healthcare\nso anything to rock that boat is not\ngoing to be politically advantageous and\nthis is why someone like RFK I think is\nreally gaining a lot of momentum the\nmost popular independent candidate I\nthink in the last hundred years because\nhe's actually just saying a lot of this\nstuff plainly and I I genuinely don't\nthink it's ever going to work to try and\nget some of these things through\nCongress because there's just so much\ncompromised interests I think a lot of\nthese things would have to be just\nstraight executive orders from the\npresident to say we're gonna make these\nchanges because the direction America is\ngoing is it is not good yeah it would be\ngreat for someone to do a real analysis\non how you switch to build purposeful\nprofitable\ncompanies and and what that looks like\nas an economy because I think people get\nso scared people who are motivated by\nmoney and and power and control get so\nscared by what happens if you suddenly\nswitch it not realizing that there are\nso many purposeful powerful ways of\ndoing the same thing and and ways that\nactually help people uh your the other\none that I wanted to pick out and\nthere's seven here I'm only picking out\na few the last one I wanted to pick out\nwas to eliminate added sugar from the\nnational school lunch program yes which\nfeels like it should be an easy one\nbecause that doesn't really have any\neconomic downside at all one of the most\nastonishing things that I think has\nhappened in in public policy in the last\n10 years is that when the 2020 to 2025\nUSDA food guidelines came up for Renewal\nthey happen every 5 years the scientific\nAdvisory Board to the USDA made a strong\nrecommendation to lower the percent of\nadded sugar in the diet from a\nrecommendation of 10% of calories coming\nfrom added sugar to 6% of calories\ncoming from added sugar this seems minor\nbut that's a Hu 10% of our calories to\n6% of our calories is a big\ndeal the USDA rejected their scientific\nadvisory board's recommendation to lower\nsaying that there was not enough\nscientific evidence and this has\nMonumental implications we are literally\nsaying that 2-year-olds these tiny\nlittle bodies can get 10% of their total\ncalories from added sugar in the face of\na world in which\n50% of American adults have either\npre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes\nconditions directly related to sugar and\nour body's inability to process more\nsugar and 30% of young adults now have\npre-diabetes and we're saying we're not\nonly saying it's okay we're recommending\nthat 10% of our calories can come from\nadded sugar this is I mean truly I think\nthis is shameful and I I don't\nunderstand why every endocrinologist in\nthe country isn't using literally every\nplatform they Poss to can to say this is\ncrazy we need to be saying in America no\nadded sugar this does not mean fruit\nthis means refined industrially\nprocessed sugar that's added to our food\nwhich is close to 60% of the things on\nour Shelf and that is absolutely\nwreaking havoc on our biology with that\ncompassionate framework towards our\ncells if you think about what's\nhappening with our mitochondria sugar\nwhich turns into blood glucose it floats\naround in the body and and the body has\nto do something with that the body has\nto process it and normally if you have\nthe right amount of glucose in the body\nthe cells would take it up out of the\nbloodstream the mitochondria would\nconvert it to Cellular energy to power\nour lives but because of all the factors\nin our in our environment that we've\ntalked about that are ravaging the\nmitochondria not only is the\nmitochondria broken by all those things\nthe Sleep the toxin the toxins the\nsedentary Behavior but we are\noverwhelming the body with like 50 times\nmore sugar than it's ever to deal with\nin human history and so imagine someone\ncoming to you and saying I need you to\ndo 50 times more work today than you've\never had to do and you're already going\nto be depleted because your structure\ngreat perspective yeah and that's what's\nhappening to each of our cells every\nsingle day with this added sugar and so\nwhat does the body do with it the body\nsays well the mitochondria can't process\nit so we're going to block the cell from\ntaking that gluc glucose up we just need\nto block it that literally is insulin\nresistance the body saying we can't do\nit we are so broken and you are\noverwhelming us please stop that's\ninsulin resistance the body blocking\nglucose coming to the cell so of course\nthen blood sugar level rise which is\nhappening in 50% of American adults 30%\nof teens and and so many more than that\nbut that's what we know that's the the\nones that have been been diagnosed with\npre-diabetes or type two diabetes and\nthen with that extra sugar floating\naround that can't get into the cell what\ndoes the body do with that it has to do\nsomething so it does the best it can it\nconverts it into fat it 3D prints that\nglucose into triglycerides and fat and\nnow 74% of Americans are overweight or\nobese so it all makes sense through this\nlens of we got to just get back to the\nbasics and stop literally having public\npolicy that's essentially the root cause\nof how we're just totally overwhelming\nour bodies with these things that they\ncannot process and they're saying it as\nloud as humanly possible 74% obesity\noverweight 50% type 2 Di and\npre-diabetes why in God's name are we\nrecommending 10% of calories to come\nfrom added sugar so that needs to be in\nexecutive order reduce it to ideally\nzero or 6% like the the scientific\nAdvisory Board said and absolutely do\nnot serve it to children in ferally\nfunded school lunches well said well\nsaid I mean\nI don't think there's anyone who could\nlisten to this and not feel completely\nmoved to want to shift in this Direction\nI mean you I I so deeply appreciate not\nonly the energy with which you\ncommunicate but the poignancy of each\nand every one of the insights for me I'm\nlistening just yeah again just feeling\nlike I hope everyone who's listening and\nwatching and this is definitely when you\nread Casey's book you'll realize this\nthis isn't to make you scared it isn't\nto make you feel F it's to make you feel\nempowered and pushed in the direction of\nchange because everything we've been\nhearing for so long has been doing the\nopposite I wanted to talk to you about\nthis because a lot of people have said\nthis to me and I just invested in a\ncompany called function health I don't\nknow if you've come across them love\nthem I'm an investor we're both\ninvestors perfect so I just invested in\na comical function Health I've known Dr\nMark kman for a few years um met the\nwonderful team and I was very passion\nabout how they were allowing people to\ndo I believe 200 biomarkers at $500 a\nyear which to me felt like a great\ninvestment I think one of the things I\nwant to help people with is what do you\ndo with those 200 biomarkers results the\nblood test the bio senses like I think a\nlot of people again look at that list\nand you're like well where do I go from\nhere like where do I start what do I do\nwhat does HDL mean what does you know uh\nhome I mean what does you know uric acid\nlike what is all of this stuff it's so\nout of our vocabulary and like you said\n99% of doctors in the book you talk\nabout this 99% of doctors don't\nunderstand it or will say don't worry\nabout it that's that's what I've been\ntold as well many times before I was\nable to start getting tested by my\nholistic doctors all I was hearing is\ndon't worry about it don't stress about\nit it's not a big deal you're young\nyou're healthy and I'm like I know I'm\nyoung and healthy but I want to stay\nyoung and healthy and I believe that\nrequires a bit more effort than me\nsaying I'm young and healthy it doesn't\nmatter and I've learned about early\nstages for me of LDL of uh my\npredisposition to diabetes because of my\nHeritage and you know there's so many\nthings that I'm so happy I know about\ntoday which is reduced my intake of\ncertain things that I love or I enjoy or\nI've been addicted to for years what\nwhatever it may be so how do people make\nsense what to do with those 200\nbiomarkers the first thing I want to say\nis that the system\nagain benefits off you thinking it's\nreally complicated it is not that\ncomplicated everything I learned about\nhow to interpret lab testing I learned\nafter medical school I learned it doing\nmy own research and I think that every\nevery American adult is totally capable\nof understanding their basic biomarkers\nand in fact we must and so what I would\nsay is start simple and start free every\nyear if you go to the doctor they're\ngoing to order a very basic set of tests\nthat usually involves a cholesterol\npanel and a fasting glucose test they're\ngoing to take your blood sugar your\nblood pressure as well so a lot of\npeople might be asking how do I figure\nout if I have good energy or bad energy\nand it's very simple you start with five\nessentially free biomarkers fasting\nglucose triglycerides HDL cholesterol\nwaist circumference and blood pressure\nthey generally come standard on a\nphysical and and if you have a fasting\nglucose less than 100 milligram de liter\nin HDL cholesterol above 40 for men or\n50 for women triglycerides less than 150\nmilligram per deciliter a blood pressure\nless than 130 over 85 and a waist\ncircumference less than 35 for women or\n40 for men and you're not on\nmedication You by our standard criteria\nfit the category of essentially having\ngood energ that is essentially saying\nyou are metabolically\nhealthy shockingly people who meet all\nfive of those criteria not on medication\ncurrently comprise less than\n6.8% of American adults 93.2% of\nAmerican adults based on the most recent\nresearch have at least one of those\nmetabolic biomarkers off or not in the\noptimal\nrange so that's just step one is just\nknow where you stand and you can\nliterally like log into your electronic\nhealth record right now and get a get a\ntape measure for your waist and and\nfigure out those\nthings and I think a simple way just\nI'll just simply say kind of what those\nthose tests mean so fasting glucose like\nI mentioned if that's rising in the\nblood it's a symbol that deep inside\nyour cells the mitochondria are\noverwhelmed the mitochondria overwhelmed\nfrom all the lifestyle things we talked\nabout that are under our control and\nthey are saying we cannot process any\nmore of this into energy therefore we\nare blocking it from coming into the\ncell therefore it rises in the\nbloodstream that's why fasting glucose\nmatters it is a sign that deep inside\nthe belly of your cell the cell is\noverwhelmed and is blocking the entry so\nit's rising in the blood triglycerides\nare totally related to that because when\nthat glucose is high and has nowhere to\ngo and isn't being converted in that\nmiraculous Cosmic process to human\nenergy it converts to Fat so it can be\nstored because the body does not want\nthe blood sugar to be super high high\nblood sugar is a problem in lots of ways\nit sticks to things and causes\ndysfunction it causes\nthe body converts it to fat and stores\nit in within cells or in fat cells so\nthat's what triglyceride means\ntriglycerides is basically saying there\nis again damage within the cell the cell\nis\noverburdened and we are becoming\nmetabolically dysfunctional so we have\nto print fat to take care of this excess\nthat we can't process\nHDL is a helpful part of the cholesterol\nfamily highdensity lipoprotein\ncholesterol it's a type of cholesterol\nuh lipoprotein so a molecule that floats\naround in the blood that actually takes\ncholesterol from the arteries back to\nthe liver to be processed and excreted\nso it's it's a way of taking cholesterol\nfrom where it could be causing problems\nin the blood vessels and putting it back\nto the liver and unfortunately when the\nliver becomes dysfunctional because of\nthe way we're living today and becomes\nfilled with fat do the other do the do I\njust spoke about with triglycerides this\nprocess of creating the right amount of\nHDL gets dysfunctional and we start to\nsee HDL Decline and that's a problem so\nHDL is quote unquote good cholesterol\nand when it's low that's basically means\nthat we can't pull the damaging\ncholesterol from the blood vessels back\nto the liver so simply put that's like\nthat's a lot of what you need to know\nabout metabolic biomarkers there are so\nso so many more but um and then waist\ncircumference that one's kind of\ninteresting\nbecause it's it's really a proxy metric\nwaist circumference for how much fat is\naround your internal organs this is the\ntype of fat that we're hearing about\nmore and more called visceral fat\nthere's three types of fat subcutaneous\nfat which is the fat you can see it's\nthe fat that you know we kind of try to\nget rid of because we don't look as good\nin a bathing suit it's actually not the\nfat that's going to kill us you know\nthis fat it's not going to kill us then\nthere's visceral fat which is the fat\nthat is around our organs that makes the\norgans dysfunctional and then there's in\ncellular fat which is literally fat\nthat's built up inside the cell that\ncauses massive dis dysfunction visceral\nfat and intracellular fat are the two\ntypes of fat that are going to shorten\nyour lives your life and those are both\ndriven by insulin resistance that\nprocess that we talked about that is\nfundamentally rooted in mitochondrial\ndysfunction so the waist circumference\nis just a way of basically telling you\nhow much fat is around my organs and\ntherefore how insulin resistant might I\nbe and then the last one is the one that\nI spoke about which is blood pressure\nand blood pressure again it Roots right\nback to glucose and insulin and\nMetabolism as our insulin levels in the\nbody rise and they rise again just let's\nmake it really simple the cell the\nmitochondria is broken it's not working\nproperly it can't process the glucose it\ncreates insulin resistant because\ninsulin resistance because insulin is\nthe hormone that's secreted to help\nglucose to get into the cell but if\nthere's an insulin block essentially the\ninsulin can't do that job and ose rises\nin the blood but this the the body's\nlike oh no the glucose is rising we need\nto actually secrete more insulin to\ndrive glucose into the cell which of\ncourse adds more burden to the\nmitochondria so insulin levels rise well\nwhen insulin levels rise as a\ncompensatory mechanism for this\nmitochondrial dysfunction and the rising\nglucose levels another impact it has is\nto block nitric oxide production and\nnitric oxide is the chemical in the\nblood that dilates our blood vessels and\nkeeps our blood pressure under control\nso hopefully it's a little complex but\nthose five things all link back to the\nexact same thing which is mitochondrial\ndysfunction which is caused by the\nlifestyle pillars we talked about so\njust to summarize those five simple\ntests that usually come on every annual\nphysical are the best place to start\nunderstand where you where you stand on\nthose compared to the ranges I mentioned\nand that will give you a sense of of\nwhere you are and then it's really\nimplementing the basic dietary and\nlifestyle strategies to give your body\nwhat it needs so we can free up the\nstrain on the mitochondria and bring\nthose things down they will all start\ncoming back in a normal range as you\nfree up the mitochondria to do better\nwork which we do through our daily\nchoices just quickly speaking to\nfunction Health that is like the next\nlevel and that is if it's something\nthat's accessible to you I recommend\nevery single person in the world do this\nif they can cuz it's over 100 biomarkers\nlike you said for less than\n$500 less than the co-pay that you would\npay at the doctor's office for like 10\nlabs and what that will do is actually\ngive you a hyper granular picture of\nwhat's going inside your body and your\nmetabolism and I mentioned that there\nare three Hallmarks of bad energy\nthere's chronic inflammation there's\noxitive stress and there's mitochondrial\ndysfunction and the beauty of the\nfunction Health test is that they\nactually have tests that will tell you\nabout each of those so you can really\nknow what's going on and beautiful\nfunctional medicine interpretations that\nactually help you understand what what\nthey mean but I think I think something\nthat's again hopefully empowering and\nnot too scary is that at the best\nhospitals and medical schools in America\nlike Stanford where I went to medical\nschool doctors are not learning how to\ninterpret lab test in a way that will\nhelp you be empowered to live a\nhealthier life we are only learning a\nvery algorithmic way of looking at lab\nmarkers and isolation in order to\nprescribe medications if LDL is high\nprescribe a satin if glucose is high\nprescribe\nmetformin and so on and so forth and\nwhat's really interesting is that for\nthe biomarkers that we do not have a\ngood drug for we ignore them like\ntriglycerides you rarely hear about\ntriglycerides even though they're more\nassociated with heart disease than LDL\nwe only hear about LDL because we have a\nmedication for it if uric acid is high\nhere's alopurinol so we focus on the\nbiomarkers that have a drug for them and\nwhat they don't learn is how to look at\nthe labs in concert with each other to\nread the Tea Leaves of what the labs are\nsaying together to tell you about your\ncore physiology so what I just shared\nwith you about fasting glucose\ntriglycerides HDL blood pressure and\nwaist circumference is frankly more than\nwhat we even learn in medical school of\nhow they all relate back to metabolic\ndysfunction and so I think it's just\nreally important for everyone to find\nthe resources like the book that\nexplains it in clear detail and you can\nsit down with the book and your lab test\nand understand for yourself where you\nstand absolutely and and trust me it's\nlike for anyone who's listening and\nfeeling like it's challenging I've been\nlearning all about this myself for the\npast couple of years and while could\nnever explain it as well as Casey does\nor or even begin to try and understand\nit as deeply as you do I've noticed how\nsome of these very simple lifestyle\nchanges have shown me big changes in how\nI feel and I wanted to focus on some of\nthose with you that you break down one\nof the big ones that I've struggled with\nfor a very long time because I remember\nfeeling like I had to do this quick and\nfast forever you talk about eating\nslowly which I think sounds like the\neasiest simplest but underestimated\nhabit so could you walk us through that\nincredible this is also my biggest\nchallenge as well especially as a\nsurgeon like I just would Woolf food\ndown and\nresearch strongly shows that the people\nwho eat the slowest have a four times\nless likelihood of developing metabolic\nsyndrome than people who eat the fastest\nso literally this has nothing to do with\nwhat you're eating it's how you're\neating so this should be very empowering\nfor people cuz it's like even if you\ndon't want to change the actual food\nchange the speed at which you're eating\nand that does change\neverything the average American family\nis eating fewer than three meals per\nweek at a table with the family like\nthis is this has become so normal now\nthat we don't eat with other people we\neat in our cars we eat while we're\nwalking we eat on the go and I think\njust the key message here is that the\nmore you can invest in sitting down at a\ntable and eating slowly and mindfully\nit's literally going to have a profound\nimpact on your core metabolic Health\nanother simple one I think we\nunderestimate is walking when I saw\nthese studies that you sent through in\nthe research I was mindblown that simple\nAct of walking could make such a\ndifference yeah yeah there's been\nresearch in some of the best journals in\nthe world like the Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association Jama one of\nthe top five journals in the world that\nshows that simply walking 7,000 or more\nsteps per day can literally slash our\nrisk of premature mortality depression\ncancer diabetes obesity and heart\ndisease and the the studies they vary a\nlittle bit some say above 7,000 steps\nsome say between 8 and 12,000 steps but\nthe the point is that is really key is\nthat\nsteps it's not just about the steps\nsteps are a proxy metric for how much we\nare moving our body throughout the day\nand there's been all these headlines\nlike sitting is the new smoking but I\nthink it's really important to\nunderstand why our biology our cellular\nbiology is actually totally different if\nwe are in motion more time throughout\nthe day even if it's something super low\ngrade like walking compared to if we sit\nall day and then just work out for an\nhour or 2 hours at night the reason for\nthis comes right back to the inside of\nthe cell so in order to take blood sugar\nout of the bloodstream and use it have\nthe mitochondria turn into energy you\nactually have to move these channels\nthese glucose channels from the inside\nof the cell to the cell membrane and one\nof the stimuluses for that moving of the\nthe glucose channel from inside the cell\nof the membrane is insulin but another\nanother signal for that is movement it's\nmuscle contraction so as we contract our\nmuscles we are basically constantly\npushing these glucose channels to the\ncell membrane to take up the glucose and\nprocess it through the mitochondria\nwe're stimulating the mitochondria to do\nwork which they love to do they want to\nhave a push to do work and they want to\nthen get the glucose in to process it so\na body that's getting up every 20 30\nminutes and walking for just a minute or\ntwo or doing a couple air squats or\ndoing a couple catle ball swings or\ndoing a push-up or two is constitutively\nkeeping the glucose channels at the\nmembrane and keeping the mitochondria\nactive versus a person who sits all day\nat their desk job and then works out for\nan hour at the end of the day sure\nthey're going to get that benefit of\npushing those glucose channels to the\nmembrane of stimulating the mitochondria\nbut the whole rest of the day they\nweren't that's fundamentally a different\nbiologic reality in both those bodies so\nthis is a yes and yes do your workout do\nyour pel on and your hit workout or\nwhatever it is but I would say more\nimportantly is to realize that the human\nbody is biologically programmed to move\nin a low-grade way pretty much all\nthroughout the day and if we can give\nthe stimulus of low-grade muscle\ncontraction to the body it will keep our\nmitochondria and our glucose control so\nso much better and then of course that\nfeeds into these profound statistics\nthat I just mentioned which is that just\na simple amount of steps 7,000 steps\nthat's like around 3 m a day 3.5 miles\ncan literally cut our dementia obesity\ndiabetes heart disease and premature\ndeath risk in half yeah no it's uh it\nwas one of the biggest things when I was\nwearing my glucose monitor I found that\nwalking after a meal was the best one\nfor lowering my um the spike and I found\nthat every time I walked after eating\nthere would be no Spike like it was as\nsimple as that and it wasn't a long walk\nit wasn't 3 miles after it was just as\nyou said a couple of minutes just to\nwalk around just to get that\nmitochondria moving so I've definitely\nseen it as well and it was so empowering\nand just to give people a double dose of\nthis uh stats from Casey's book 50%\nlower dementia risk 50 to 70% lower risk\nof premature death 44% lower risk of\ngetting type 2 diabetes 31 % or more\nlower risk of obesity these are high\nnumbers like of reduction imagine if\nthis was a pill yeah I mean it would be\nFront Page News everywhere new drug\nlowers Alzheimer's Risk by 50% but it's\nwalking and it makes us feel so good too\nwhen we move our bodies everyone feels\nbetter when they've walked more so it's\nit's not just the walking it's the it's\nit's it's really it's expressing our\ninstinctual nature as animals and as\nhumans as the only bipedal animal it's\nexpressing that it's honoring that\nMiracle of our ability to move by doing\nit and we need to absolutely one of the\nother ones that stood out to me that I\nloved was reduce social jet lag I love\nthis one yeah I had not heard of this\nconcept of social jet lag until I wrote\nthe book but it's fascinating so social\njet lag gets at sleep consistency which\nis one of the three very important\naspects of sleep that we often forget so\nthere's Sleep Quality there's sleep\nquantity and there's sleep consistency\nquality is basically how deep are we\nsleeping are we having Awakenings during\nthe night from something like light or\nnoise in the room or sleep apnea sleep\nquantity is self-evident it's are we\ngetting enough sleep and what seems to\nbe the optimal amount for metabolic\nhealth is between seven and 8 hours per\nnight but the third is sleep consistency\nso this is are we going to bed and\ngetting up at consistent times dayto day\nthis is another one like slow eating\nthat I have really struggled with in the\npast and social jet lag is a measure of\nconsistency so what we do is we look at\nthe days of the week and you can split\nit between like maybe days that you're\nworking and days that you have more\nleisure time and you look at the start\ntime and the end time of your sleep and\nyou compare the midpoint of sleep\nbetween those two different phases so\nlet's say during the work week my sleep\nis between uh 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.\nbecause I have to get up for work at\n6:00 a.m. the midpoint of my sleep would\nbe 2 a.m. and then on the weekends I\nstay up a little later and I sleep from\nlet's say 12 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. the\nmidpoint of my sleep is 4:00 a.m. so the\ndifference in those midpoints 2: a.m.\nand 4:00 a.m. is 2 hours and research\nhas shown that social jet lag of 2 hours\nor\nmore between different different nights\nof the week confers a doubling of the\nrisk RK of metabolic syndrome type 2\ndiabetes than if that is a shorter\nwindow if we're actually it's huge it's\nhuge so that sleep\nconsistency and what it gets to I think\nis a really important point about our\nbiology which is that we are on a\n24-hour cycle as humans and our\ncircadian rhythms really dictate so much\nof our biology and our bodies are\nnaturally on a 24-hour clock they have\nwe have clock genes and but there are\nfew ways through our behavior that we\ncan entrain the natural clock of the\nbody which then feeds into the proper\nexpression of so many of our genes and\nhormones and cell signaling Pathways and\nthere's three main ways that we can\nessentially tell the body what time it\nis the first is sleep consistency are we\ngoing to bed and getting up at\nessentially the same time every day that\ncreates a rhythm for the body that it\ncan just like ease into that entrains\nessentially the clock for the body so\nthat's why sleep consistency is so\nimportant the second is meal timing when\nare we eating each day we eat at Super\nerratic times during the day the average\nAmerican actually has over 11 eating\nevents per day over the course of 15\nhours that's a lot of eating events so\nthe body that's expecting maybe more\nregular times uh and definitely eating\nbefore dark is now getting food all the\ntime totally confusing\nour clock the third is when we view\nlight so this is probably one of the\nmost important ones which is if we you\nknow our our body doesn't know if it's\ndark or light outside if it's day or\nnight our cells don't have eyeballs and\nso we have to tell the body what time it\nis by exposing it to literal photons the\nphotons go through our eye go through\nthe vitus fluid in the eye they hit our\nretinal cells that transmit an\nelectrical action potential to our\nsupermatic nucleus which then translates\ninto essentially telling our body it's\nmorning that's how it happens and so it\nis really our responsibility to show our\nretina cells direct Photon energy\ndoesn't mean staring straight at the sun\nit means just being outdoors without a\nwindow or sunglasses and just being\noutdoors and that is a signal that\nentrains our 24-hour clock saying hey\nit's morning so so just to summarize\nhere\ncircadian rhythm is absolutely crial for\nour metabolic health because so many of\nour metabolic genes signaling Pathways\nand hormones are are on a 24-hour Rhythm\nand the way that we can essentially\ncreate less confusion for the body is by\nregular signals of what time it is which\nwe do by sun exposure in the morning and\navoiding artificial blue light after the\nsun goes down regular meal times each\nday and sleep consistency meaning going\nto bed at at night at the same time and\ngetting up in the morning at the same\ntime which we can measure through the\nmetric of social jet lag and we really\nwant to keep that that social jet lag\nmetric less than two hours you def\nthat's my two hours mine is two hours\nI'm like already going oh gosh how do I\nsolve that on the weekend but Casey I\nmean you've given so many great\npractical insights today I think you've\nwoken us up to the idea of of the\nchallenges that exist in our society as\nwell and what I love where you take this\nbook is this idea of how this isn't just\na physical Journey it's not just a\nmental Journey it's actually a spiritual\njourney of rising to\nfearlessness and I love that you do that\nbecause to me I think often what gets us\nstarted when it comes to our health is\nfear but it doesn't keep us going right\nwe may have the fear of I need to be\nhealthy because I've got kids now I have\nthe fear of I'm putting on weight I\ndon't want to put on weight I have the\nfear of oh no I just got diagnosed with\nthis thing and I really don't right so\nit's always fear that kind of gets us\nstarted but you're actually saying fear\nis not healthy for us even on a cellular\nlevel and you're actually encouraging us\nto rise to\nfearlessness how do we build that when\nsome of us think we're\nmanifesting a unhealthy life for\nourselves or we almost feel conditioned\nto believe that it's all going to end\nbadly or we've had someone we've lost in\nour life early on and we now believe\nthat will happen to us or maybe actually\nyou're listening to this and you've been\nhealthy so far and all of a sudden you\ngo well maybe I'm not healthy and it's\nso easy to get into because of how a lot\nof this information is also pre\npresented is that we start to feel like\nwe're just being scared how do we how do\nwe rise into fearlessness I'm a big\nbeliever\nthat the best health\narises when our cells are living in an\necosystem that feels safe safe and\nbelieves in abundance and is fun\nfundamentally rooted in joy and awe\nbecause ourselves hear every single\nthing that we're thinking through our\nhormones and through our\nneurotransmitters they know they know if\nthere's a threat and they know if\nthere's something to be afraid of so I\nthink it's one of our greatest jobs as\nhumans to create an environment just\nlike we would for a baby of a sense of\nsafety and I think a lot of people might\nsay oh my gosh that sounds impossible\nthe world is crazy right now but this\nmight you know sound dark but I actually\nthink again it's like a very hopeful\nmessage like the reality is that we are\nall going to die that is unavoidable\nthat is the only thing we can be certain\nof and so living in constant\nfear just doesn't really make sense like\nliving with curiosity and awe and\nappreciation and actually really diving\ndown that spiritual journey of of\nexploring what this life and this whole\ndeath thing really means like to me that\nleads us to this sense of starting to\nreally realize that like fundamentally\nwe are we are part of this eternal\ninfinite Limitless Cosmos we are not\nseparate from it we are totally\nconnected and that's like super a\ninspiring and if our health Journey can\nbe rooted in that rooted in the sheer\nmiraculousness of us being alive at at\nthis moment of us having consciousness\nof the\nstatistical near impossibility of being\nhere and and wanting to honor that and I\nthink I think that's where all really\ngood choices come from in many spiritual\nFrameworks we we talk about attachment\nas the root of\nsuffering um being attached to things\nbeing a certain way is the root of\nsuffering and it's interesting as this\nplays into sort of our americ culture\nlike we think about what is one form of\nattachment is Cravings like Cravings are\na form of attachment we want something\nwe have this insatiable desire for\nsomething specific and we want to eat it\nbut what so many spiritual Traditions\nthroughout history have told us is that\nyou know nothing in the material world\ncan actually reduce our um suffering ex\nexcept connecting essentially with\nsource with God and and so and that's my\nframework that's what I I I do believe\nthat and so some might say well if\nthat's the perspective that just\nconnecting with God and connecting with\nsource and spirit whatever you want to\ncall it and channeling sort of the\ndivine within us that we are a part of\nand totally interconnected with if that\nthen why do we have to do all this\nhealthy stuff like why do we have to\nlike eat healthy and this and that and I\nthink it comes down to the fact\nthat as we make the healthy choices as\nwe eat the healthy food as we get the\nsleep as we move our bodies we are\ncreating the form of the body the\nstructure of the body that I think has\nan easier time connecting with Source\nAndes if we are essentially channeling\nthat Source energy and Duality Duality\nis the root of the suffering Duality is\nthat we were part of the spirit world\nand we came into this body and we forgot\nwe forgot that we are part of that we\nforgot that we are pure love we forgot\nthat we are a peace of God if the\nforgetting is from that Duality when we\nwere born and the purpose of of getting\nback to essentially Bliss is remembering\nI think it's I personally think it is\neasier to remember when we have a body\nthat is really functioning properly and\nso my spiritual journey is rooted in the\nchoices every day that build this radio\ntower I am the radio tower the sensor to\ntry to connect with that and when I'm\ndoing the healthy habits and the\nbiohacks and the protocols and all this\nstuff like whatever you want to call it\nit's actually in service of building a\nstructure that can channel that in the\nmost open and clear way absolutely and I\nthink that that's just my perspective\nand and I think that but I think it's\njust really realizing that it's it's\nbigger than just these these like the\nbooks and the hacks and and the\noptimization and the the micro things\nand you know how much Zone 2 training to\ndo every day and all these things like\nif we root this journey in a bigger\npicture of basically striving for this\nBliss um I think that it can really help\nmotivate us and then remembering that\ndowst principle that we're a process not\nan entity this is why we actually have\nto do the health behaviors every day\nbecause we're every day we're rebuilding\nthat radio tower that con can connect\nwith Source every day we're building\nthat sensor and so you want to keep\ndoing the habits with good food and good\nsleep and movement and reducing the\ntoxic stress and the toxins in the\nenvironment because you're rebuilding\nthat half of The Duality the body every\nsingle day\nand when that structure gets hurt and\ndysfunctional we get the depression and\nwe get the anxiety and we get the fear\nand we get the diseases and it ends up\nbeing distracting you know from this so\nso that's something that really\nmotivates me when it comes to and that\nand that alleviates a lot of the fear\nfor me um but I think we just all need\nto understand that when we are\nemotionally sensing fear in the body\nfrom any Source from the news from our\nchildhood trauma uh from the email we\ngot whatever the fear\nis anytime we're experiencing emotional\nfear it's translated biochemically into\nthe body through hormones\nneurotransmitters that fundamentally the\nbody has to respond to the body is going\nto respond to that fear even if it's\nemotional and that will divert our\nresources towards defense rather than\nthriving so each of us needs to take\nhonest stock of what emotionally\npsychologically is causing fear in our\nlives and work to set the boundaries to\nlimit it whether it's our fear of death\nour fear of some inner wound that\nhappened in childhood intergenerational\nwounds whether it's your relationship\nwith your co-workers whether it's the\nnews that you're watching of Wars\nthousands of miles away and you must\nwork to limit it because the more fear\nthat your body is experiencing the more\nyou're diverting resources away from\nthriving in the book I talk about the\ntrue biochemistry of this and how\nactually fear and\nloneliness directly in scientific\nstudies leads to all three Hallmarks of\nbad energy oxitive stress chronic\ninflammation and mitochondrial\ndysfunction so that's our job as humans\nour job is to overcome the fear we want\nto have healthy fear we don't want to\nwalk across the street without looking\nwe want to have healthy acute fear we do\nnot want to have chronic fear and the\nworld we're living in wants us to be\nafraid profits off of us being afraid\nbecause afraid people are going to hide\nthey're going to be quiet they're going\nto look for salvation outside of\nthemselves in industry and they are\ncertainly going to buy any product that\nthey think it's going to alleviate that\nfear so it's our job to take stock of\nthat and do the work to create a sense\nof safety for all those cells inside our\nbody Casey thank you so much it's been\nsuch a joy talking to you today and uh I\nhope that everyone who's been listening\ngrabs a copy of good energy the\nsurprising connection between metabolism\nand Limitless health I want you all to\nhave a happier healthier more healed\nlife and this book will unlock that\nfearlessness which I think is such a\ncore yet unique aspect of what we're all\nmissing uh I hope that this is an\nepisode that you'll revisit I hope it's\nan episode you'll share with friends and\nfamily maybe you'll listen to it\ntogether again and deduce which insights\nI'm moving away from this episode\nfeeling extremely inspired to recommit\nto my health Journey there are so many\nthings I'm thinking about over the last\ncouple of weeks that maybe I haven't\nbeen as mindful with maybe I have made\nmistakes on and want to reconnect with\nand Casey we end every episode of on\npurpose with a final five or a Fast Five\nthese ones have to be answered in one\nword to one sentence maximum Casey\nhere's your final five what is the best\nadvice you've ever received or heard\nwhat I think of when I think of best\nadvice is actually it was the motto of\nmy high school which was an all girls\nschool and the advice or the Mantra was\nevery girl has something to say and I\nwould like to in that to every person\nhas something to say I think that we're\nliving in a world again rooted in fear\nwhere people are self censoring\nthemselves and stopping themselves from\nexpressing what is deep inside their\nheart because they are afraid of the\nrepercussions of rejection of being\ncancelled of being of having mean\ncomments online and fundamentally this\nself censorship that I'm seeing really\nramp\nit's root in a scarcity mindset and it\nis a it is it is representative of a\nblock of flow of energy and inspiration\nthrough us and I think that in many ways\nit's blocks of energy flowing through us\nthat is fundamentally the root of so\nmuch of the health issues that we're\nfacing today literally metabolic\ndysfunction is the block of that sun\nenergy flowing through our cells to\ncreate human energy and so anything we\ncan do to keep the flow open through the\nhealthy good energy habits to improve\nmetabolic Health through speaking\nauthentically in what's our hearts\nwhether it's in a journal or to your\nloved ones or doing things to just move\nflow through our body our blood dance\nyou know move Shake do whatever you need\nto do to get things moving but I think\nthat\nMantra every girl every person has\nsomething to say feels really resonant\nnow where I see a lot of people hiding\nthe truth in their hearts because\nthey're afraid of the repercussions\nbecause of the public dig world that we\nlive in well said uh second question\nwhat is the worst advice you ever heard\nor received the worst advice I've ever\nheard is all good things in\nmoderation I think that this phrase that\nhas become so ubiquitous is actually\nrepresentative of a\nreal leak in principles there are things\nthat we do not want in moderation in our\nbodies in our Temple especially in our\nchildren's body bodies refined sugar\npesticide covered Ultra refined grains\nthe 80,000 synthetic toxins that are in\nour food water and air that might be in\nproducts that we think are good all good\nthings in\nmoderation I think we need an intense\nreinvigoration of Courage of people\nsaying what's right and what's wrong\nwe're afraid to say what's wrong right\nnow while literally around us Rome is\nburning our population is getting\nincreasingly sick at every age and as\nadults we need to have the moral Clarity\nto say Don't eat this don't put this in\nyour body it's not good for you and\npeople are becoming afraid of that and\nso I think all good things in moderation\nis representative of lack of clarity\nthat is hurting us uh question three\nwhat's the first thing you do in the\nmorning and last thing you do at night\nwell to be totally honest the first\nthing I do in the morning and at the end\nof the day every single day is I I roll\nover and I tell my partner how much I\nlove him I love that every single day\nI'm just being totally honest and I\nthink that's beautiful um I think\nstarting every day with love\nfundamentally you know gets me tied into\nwhat I think our true nature as humans\nare as part of this Incredible Universe\nwhich I think the core frequency of the\nuniverse is love and so I think anything\nwe can do to start our days with love\nwhether you have a partner or not a pet\nor not it's expressing love in some way\nwhether it's to a\nperson gratitude for this beautiful life\nthat we have something that expresses\nthe vibration of Love which I think\nfundamentally is is the vibration that\nkeeps us as healthy as possible\nbeautiful uh question number four what's\na lesson you wished you learned earlier\nthe lesson that I wish I'd learned\nearlier is to make decisions with my\nbody instead of with my brain that's\ngreat in the western culture we are so\nfocused on thinking our way to decisions\nand I think my life has transformed when\nI have more felt my way to decisions I\nthink the body has such\nintense\ninnate wisdom and intuition and\nconnection with all of source but we\nneed to slow down from the distraction\nindustrial complex of our world to be\nable to hear it and once I've tuned in\nto what my body is telling me every day\nthrough that upset stomach that little\nthat little sense of what's right and\nwrong everything has become easier it's\nfantastic uh Fifth and final question if\nyou could create one law that everyone\nin the world had to follow what would it\nbe I think the law that would help bring\nto fruition the world that I really want\nto see is to\ncreate widespread economic incentives\nto return to more natural form of\nAgriculture and farming so eliminating\nthe pesticides and creating an incentive\nstructure for Farmers that allows them\nto cultivate the Earth our you know our\nmother the the soil that we come from in\na way that is respectful and really\nrespects the complexity of the\necosystem which humans live which soil\nwhich all the microbes in the soil live\nwe've we've decimated our soil we've\nkilled soil soil is a a lifegiving and\nliving organism that is now dead because\nof the ways that we have managed the\nEarth since World War II with industrial\nagriculture with mechanized tilling with\nsynthetic pesticides and synthetic\nfertilizers and because we've killed the\nsoil we're actually killing ourselves\nand I think that gets to like the\nbroader point which is I think maybe the\nkey point I would want to leave the\nlisteners with which is that it's that\nconnection that really is what's going\nto heal all of us like we are living in\na system that promotes\nsilos and that's not working because we\nactually are in not only an\ninterdependent living system between\nsoil plants animals and humans but we're\nin an interdependent Cosmos and so as we\nmove and create hopefully laws like this\nthat move us from silos connection I\nthink we are going to get so much\nhealthy we need healthier we need to\nrealize and really internalize the\nconnection\nbetween most all of the symptoms and\nconditions we're facing today and their\nfundamental connected rooting and\nmetabolic dysfunction we need to realize\nthe totally interdependent connection\nbetween soil humans Air Water and Light\nand\nthe the foundation of planetary healing\nis not going to be carbon captur it's\ngoing to be respecting the\ninterdependent relationships between all\nthings on the earth third we need to\nrealize the connection between humans in\nloving in-person relationships and that\nthat is a foundation of the safety\nourselves need to be as healthy as\npossible and I think lastly I would just\nsay we need to understand that\nconnection between life and death and an\ninternal process that we are a part of\nand that is nothing to fear so\nfundamentally laws that promote the idea\nof connection reduce the siline that's\nhurting us and ultimately help us Thrive\nfrom within beautiful Casey thank you so\nmuch for joining me on purpose today uh\neveryone who's been listening or\nwatching make sure you tag both KC and I\non Instagram on Tik Tok on X whatever\nplatform you're using with your

much if\nyou love this episode you'll love my\ninterview with Dr gabo mate on\nunderstanding your trauma and how to\nheal emotional wounds to start moving on\nfrom the past everything in nature grows\nonly where it's vulnerable so uh a tree\ndoesn't grow where it's hard and thick\ndoes it it goes where it's soft and\ngreen and vulnerable"
