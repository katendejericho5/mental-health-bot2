everything you just\nshared like i'm so grateful and blessed\nto have that but uh i i have this\npractice that we were trained in as\nmonks that\nwhen someone notices something good\nabout you even what you were just saying\nearlier\nyou accept it and you receive it but\nyou think of the person that helped you\nget that skill or ability or\nhabit or practice that helped you\ndevelop that intentionally on\nintentionally and you pass it on to them\nso i love doing this because i can just\nsit here and think about all my teachers\nand monk teachers and pass it back to\nthem and thank them in my heart so it's\nan opportunity to be thankful and\ngrateful so i love that you've been on\nthe podcast for 35 seconds\nand you've already dropped something\nthat's helpful to me because i have a\nhard time accepting compliments\ni just have a hard time with it and i\nlove\ni love that i can accept it and thank\nsomebody i can i can do that yeah it's\nsimple i can do that because i\ni stand on the shoulder of giants right\num\ni appreciate that all right\nall right thank you and i noticed two\nbefore you\nbefore i hope you don't mind me pointing\nthis out before we started i\nsaw you\ni looked over you and your eyes were\nclosed and you just took like 30 50 60\nseconds is that something that you\nlearned\nduring your um\nmonastery yeah yeah what monastery\nduring your time in\nyour time yeah it was uh the idea of\nusing any opportunity before you begin\nsomething uh you're setting your\nintention for service\nso before you begin anything in the day\nwhether it's eating or even sleeping or\nspending time with someone or i mean we\nliterally are serving humanity through\njustin and all of you and the incredible\nwork that man enough does so to just set\nyour intention and be like okay let me\nget out of my own way\nlet me be a channel let me serve let me\nyou know not so it's not really a prayer\nit's a prayer you could call it a prayer\nabsolutely yeah you could call it a\nprayer uh\nbut but the clear thing is you're\nsetting your intention for service of\nservice yeah so a prayer for to be of\nservice absolutely\nso\ni'd like to start by asking you\nwhen was a time where you just didn't\nfeel like you were man enough\ni'd probably say my whole life\nlike it's it feels like such a\nreal thing because when i was growing up\nas a young boy i was\noverweight\nand i was one of the few ethnic\nminorities in my area\nand so i was bullied at primary school\nand\ni'd always be picked on or the mick\ntaken out whether it's racism or whether\nit was about my weight or or body image\nand all of those kind of issues and i\nactually didn't take it that personally\nbecause i'd go home and my mom loved me\na lot oh and so i was raised i feel like\ni was literally raised by my mom and\nthat's one of the reasons why i never\nfelt man enough\nbecause my mother was the most involved\nparent my dad was very much aloof let me\nmake my decisions failures choices\nbut my mother was always there my mother\ntaught me how to shave my face she\ntaught me my skin care routine she\ntaught like my my mother was like the\nfirst person to teach me a lot of what\npeople's dads usually teach them\nand that wasn't because my dad was a bad\nfather it's just that that was his style\nand we have a great friendship now\nbut uh with my mom she was the one\ninvolved so i never felt man enough\nbecause i didn't have a man teaching me\nman things or however you want to put it\ni was always surrounded by my mother my\nsister and powerful women in my life\nand i wasn't really exposed to alpha\nmales or any of those figures so how's\nthat manifest like do people call your\nmama's boy did they call you names yeah\nall of it i remember when when someone\nwould pick on me at school i'd go tell\nmy mom that my mom would come to school\nto like you know like why are you\ntreating my son like this and that's\nlike the worst nightmare for a kid right\nit's like it's like everyone in the\nschool is like oh gosh look it's jay's\nmom again and you know my mom can be\npretty protective of of me especially\nwhen i was younger\nand so she'd get right in there with the\nheadmistresses office or the dean's\noffice and just be like can't have this\nhappen and then everyone would find out\nand then and would laugh at you more\nand so i think i think it ended up\ni actually think it just made me more of\nwho i am today but uh when i went to\nhigh school i started to crave more male\nattention so going from that i then went\nto an all-boys school oh wow\nso i went to an all-boys school from the\nage of 11 to 18\nand at that point you have no one else's\nvalidation or recognition to get apart\nfrom other boys right now i want to fit\nin did you so did you seek or crave that\nattention absolutely that's when i was\nlike\noh now i want to be seen as strong and i\nwant to be seen as cool and i want to be\nseen as the guy and i want to be seen as\nthis and that and so\ni think that manifested in being quite\ncompetitive\nand so i wanted to get a spot on the\nschool's rugby team i wanted to get a\nspot on the school's swimming team i\nwanted to get a spot on the screen rugby\ni did i think a big part of it was that\nmasculine feeling that it gave me and so\ni think it manifested in insecurities at\nhigh school so as i got older i actually\nthink between 14 to 18 it manifested as\ninsecurities of seeking validation and\nrecognition\nfor that which was not me\nso i wasn't looking to be loved because\ni was\nempathetic and compassionate and kind\nwhich is how my mom raised me i was\nlooking to be\nliked because\ni was bold and courageous and strong and\nphysical and competitive and so you\nalmost start looking for validation for\nthe things that you're not so you became\nyou were performing absolutely every day\nabsolutely absolutely\nmasculinity feels like uh like it it's a\ntotal dance right it's a total\nchoreography and you're kind of watching\nother men\nlike do it right like even the handshake\nlike how am i supposed to like do the\nhug then the pull then the um\nthere's like a pull there's a tap\nsometimes\nno no it's the bra yeah there's a lot of\ndifferent uh it's very funny um not\nfunny but it can be entertaining as a\nwoman to just kind of watch that and be\nlike i'm so happy i don't have to figure\num that out but but i want to come back\nto the you know your point about service\nwhich you really you know opened up our\nconversation with i feel like we\nover emphasize service for women right\nthat you are at the service of the\npeople around you and that's your value\nin the world and we kind of under\nemphasize service for men\nand it seems like for you\nfinding service as purpose was really\nvery meaningful part of your identity\ni'm wondering how you see\nyou know us being able to make that\nconnection what does service look like\nfor men and and how is it tied to\nmasculinity yeah i i mean i saw what i\nwas saying was i saw my mother's\nsacrifice growing up so my mother was\nraising me and my sister deeply with\nlove i've always felt loved by my mother\nand then she would also have her own\nbusiness so i didn't even know i didn't\nknow she was an entrepreneur but she was\nan entrepreneur which was so weird\nbecause she never made herself out to be\nan entrepreneur\nand so she had her own business she\nstarted it so that she could work more\nflexibly\nand she was taking care of my sister\nshe'd drop us to school she'd pick us up\nshe'd make us dinner she'd be working as\nwell and at one point became the main\nbreadwinner in the family as well\nand so i saw my mom serve or sacrifice\nin this way\nand so i feel like i got trained by\nwatching her and observing her\nand then when i met the monks who the\npredominant monks that i lived with were\nall men\nand service was at the core of their\nentire being\nso our teachers would always tell us\nthat the only way a culture succeeds is\nif everyone wants to serve everyone else\nand so that was like the encouragement\nof that culture and that's where it\nbecame so real to me and for me service\nand masculinity\ngo hand in hand but service and humanity\ngo hand in hand and i think this is it's\nslightly veering off from where we are\nbut i think it's an important point to\nmake is when i lived as a monk we\nstopped identifying as men and women\nand we were asked to identify as\nconsciousness\nand that\ndistinction and difference just kind of\ncreated this\nhuge like weight of my shoulders because\nnow it's like oh i'm not masculine or\nfeminine or i'm not this or that i'm\njust you just are i'm just i'm just\nconsciousness i'm a human i'm a soul and\nwhatever you want to call it i'm energy\nand that energy is wired for service\nand so the energy inside each of us at\nthis table is wired for service so the\nway it connects is that we've been\ndesigned to serve but unfortunately and\ni've heard that a lot\nfrom from women is that often it turns\ninto being a martyr or or going to the\npoint of self-sacrifice and\nself-sabotage because of how it's\nencouraged more\nand i was speaking at this event and\na man came up to me he was probably in\nhis 40s\nand i had just told a story about how\nwhen i met the monks at 18 they shifted\nmy perspective to service\nand he said to me he goes you're so\nlucky that you got that at 18 and i was\nlike yeah i know trust me like i'm so\ngrateful to my teachers he goes no no no\nreally he goes i only realized that\nsomeone else mattered when i had a child\nand he was like that's the only that was\nthe first time i realized that someone\napart from me mattered\nand and you know he was obviously being\nreally vulnerable and i appreciated him\nsharing that and i met it with\ncompassion but i think that's the case\nthat\nfor a lot of men i don't think we're\ntrained\nearly on in our life to realize that not\njust to our kids matter or our partners\nmatter but everyone matters and more\npeople matter well you're rewarded if\nyou don't right like on the rugby team\nyou know sort of the culture you're\ndescribing where you get rewarded if you\nare individualistic competitive and you\nknow have this kind of attitude and\nagain for women it's the opposite we we\nget heavily punished when we when we\ntake on those characteristics that's\ntrue yeah but that ungendering is so\ninteresting right that happened um and\nand that\nsurplus of energy that you felt is\nsomething that\nwe could all access right if we weren't\nweighed down by these gender stereotypes\nit's like the freedom right yeah so\nyou're saying that you had sight you had\nknowledge growing up\nby your mother\nand you kind of held that to yourself i\ngave it up because i saw it as less than\nso it's not even that i held it back i\ngave it up and substituted it you traded\nit in for your man card correct for this\ntoxicity\nwhich then obviously encouraged more\npeople to go down that path\nand then i think\nthe best thing i've done to try and\nremove that is uh when i became a monk i\nbecame the mentor to a lot of young men\nin london\nand\nthose young men are still involved in my\nlife so i've known them since they were\nlike 16 to 18 years old they're all like\n26 to 28 years old now and so i feel\nlike those 25 guys they know who they\nare like those are like my favorite\nsuccess story because\nthose i i just see them make amazing\ndecisions with their partners\ntheir careers like they're all most of\nthem in relationships now and i see the\nhusbands and the fathers they're\nbecoming and\ni mean it's it's you know many of them\nbecome fathers before i am one and it's\njust inspiring that they're also leading\nthat way and showing me\nthat people don't have to make as bad a\nmistakes or go as far as i did right\nwhere do you go like when you're\nstruggling you know when you and your\nwife are having a fight or if you ever\nhave fight i don't know if you guys have\nfights lots\nwhere do you go and share that because\nyou are you are a spiritual guru to\nmillions of people now right and in many\nways and so many people look to you for\nadvice but who do you go to where do you\ngo when you need help yeah so\nthe first thing i'm going to address\nthat the the arguing my wife because i\nthink that's such a good\nthing to talk about\nthis is what i find fascinating about\nthe way humans are wired and and i'll\ngive an example so my wife's been my\nfirst guest every year when we launch a\nnew season on the podcast so she's been\non the podcast three times the guest\nwe've had on the most\nand every time we'll do like a one and a\nhalf hour episode of everything we\nstruggled with that year and so we talk\nabout like the mistakes the failures the\nthings that went wrong\nand the number one comment will be\nrelationship goals and the number one\ncomment would be couple goals and what i\nfound is that the human desire to\nbe inspired and want someone to project\nperfection onto anyone\nis so strong\nthat my my honest comment back is always\nplease listen to what we just said yeah\nyeah and i'm not listening right like\nlike and not in not listening and like\nand i know you don't mean this not in an\nattacking way but just like please just\nlisten to me like i just told you that\nwhen i first started dating my wife i\nthought she wanted to be wooed like in\nthe movies of hollywood and i got it all\nwrong because i was doing all this\nflashy stuff and my wife's actually a\nsimple person did not want any of that i\njust told you you know we have the same\nstory yeah\nidentical story really yeah\nkeep going please keep going so so so my\npoint is being like if i've just told\nyou that actually for the first two\nyears of our marriage sorry two years of\nour relationship we didn't understand\neach other\ndon't just look at us and go like oh\nyeah you guys got green eyes and they\nmatch and so you match and like you know\nit's there's just so much more to it and\ni find that so reductive as humans we so\nwant people\nto be perfect\nthat we create a pedestal even if\nsomeone's telling you the truth\nand i think if we just sit and all\nlisten to each other then a we won't be\nlet down by people and b we won't put\npeople on the pedestal but but who do i\ngo to so the first thing i definitely\nturn to my texts and and i know we share\nthis in common but the bhagavad-gita\nhas has been such a companion and guide\nin my life from so long since i was 18\nthat i turned to it all the time uh my\nmonk teacher who's now uh 70 years old\nwho you actually met yeah oh my god\nthat's so sweet yeah when he came to my\nhome so you've met him\nand he's now 70 years old he grew up in\nchicago and hitched hiked to india at\nthe age of 19\nthe story is insane yeah he's an insane\nstorm and and so\nwhen i'm when i'm struggling with\nsomething in a major way when it's like\na real like\nlike i feel like it's a tragedy at this\npoint then he's the person i go to\nbecause he always helps me see\nthe reality and see the truth\nuh again there's monks in between that\njourney so he's like kind of at the top\nof the order but then there's other ones\nthat are more like older brothers and i\ncan be more vulnerable with them and i\ndon't feel like\nso you have monks on like\nfeedback\nmonks and they're there to help you like\njust recalibrate bring yourself to\naccount so for men who don't have monks\non speed dial\nwhat is what is your advice for them to\ndo business in a more spiritual way\nso spirituality and business is an\ninteresting concept because a lot of\npeople today see it as an oxymoron yeah\nor\num you know mutually exclusive\nand the truth is that spirituality is so\npowerful that it actually spreads across\neverything and i know i know all of you\nunderstand that but it's like\nif spirituality is what we all say it is\nthen it has the purity and the power\nto spread across anything\nand again going back to our previous\ntheme the key element\nis is this for service of humanity for\nothers or is this in the service of\nmyself now that's a fine line yeah and\ni've been on the wrong side of that line\nplenty of times so there's plenty of\ntimes when i assess options and\nopportunities in front of me and i\nrealize i'm only taking that option\nbecause there's ego involved\ni'm only taking that option because\nthere's an opportunity or there's a big\npayout or there's a nice dollar sign\nnext to it and i'm only doing it for\nthat and i've said yes to stuff like\nthat plenty of times to know that i'm\nnot perfect but the awareness is what i\nwould encourage people to do is is\nhaving the ability to be like here are\nthe three four options in my life right\nnow\nlet me write a word above them which is\nthe intention of why i'm choosing that\nand if the if the word isn't love\nor service\nit's not going to feel good after i\nfinish it\nand and so that's that's what i would\nencourage people to do as a reflection\nwithout needing anyone in their life or\nanyone around them\ni love that i love that there's this q\ni i i don't know the quote exactly but\num\none of the central figures in the baha'i\nfaith talks about abdubah\nthat when you are suffering and when you\nare going through something and you\ncannot find a way out to immediately go\nbe of service to another\nbecause when you are service to others\nyou find that your own pains and things\num just dissipate through that so when\nyou talked about earlier about being\nwired for service yes\nhow so while i think that\nalso\nthere are some people that are put into\nservice toward to others not to be of\npure service because they're forced to\nbe put there um women\nare some wives often times unless we do\nsomething different i have these\nconversations with liz all the time the\nservice that i've always seen with women\nin my life my mother grandma all of them\nthey um\nit was it was there was a lot of sexism\ngoing on as well\nnot necessarily by my\nfather certainly i\ni want to say no\nbut all of the stuff that was being\nexperienced so i think that this idea of\nservice being elevated but service being\nforced\nhow do we how do we really talk about\nthat and how does service and capitalism\nright like which feel at odds\num how do you how do you reconcile that\nyeah there's there's a beautiful\nstatement by peter diamandis and he says\nthat we should redefine the word\nbillionaire to be someone who impacts\nthe lives of a billion people\nnow whether you think of that from\nspirituality or from a money perspective\nthe wealthiest people\nin the world\nare creating something that services the\nmost amount of people\nand the scale of the problem you're\nsolving and the depth of the issue is\nhow much money you make so if someone\ncreated a cure for cancer\nand was able to scale it across the\nworld they would probably be the\nwealthiest person on the planet because\nthey created something out of service\nnow\nyou may say well jay well no many people\nout of wanting the money will figure\nthat out\ni'd say that they may but i'm hoping\nthat on that journey they'll upgrade and\ntheir desire and their intention will be\npurified and i think this was what i\nloved learning from the bhagavad-gita\nwhich was this idea of there is no pure\nintention\nall intentions are percentages and\ndivided\nso\nwhen you first start something you may\nhave a 70 pure intention but there's 30\npercent of ego in that yeah or when you\nstart it's probably the other way around\n25 good intention and 75 percent of ego\nbut it's purified in the process so even\nif you look at people who've set out\ntheir lives and i work with many of them\nwho set out at the beginning of their\nlives to become wealthy and famous when\nthey became wealthy and famous they then\nrealized that wasn't the point and they\nwere purified in the process of\nachieving their goal\nand so the way i think about it is that\nin a capitalist society\neven the people that are succeeding\nare succeeding because of service\nwhether it's conscious or not conscious\nwhether it's intentional or\nunintentional they're still only success\nlike amazon is successful because we all\nwant its service\nlike we want to be served by amazon\nright and i'm not promoting or deep\npromoting amazon i'm just making the\npoint that because it serves a daily\nneed\nfor the majority of the population\nthey are financially successful because\nof it does that make sense liz i don't\nknow if i'm answering your question well\nand i want and i see your face so i'm\nlike i want to well because i i feel\nlike it doesn't purify like jeff bezos\nuh actually i don't care about pissing\nout\njeff bezos doing it with love um you\nknow jeff bezos uh i don't think i don't\ni don't have any evidence that he was\npurified by becoming a billionaire like\nhe still has 28 bathrooms but then he's\npreventing his workers from unionizing\nright so like yeah i i guess i'm still\nwondering how to\nreconcile those things and we've talked\nabout the intersection of\nof masculinity and risk\nabout how you know women are willing to\ntake big risks when it comes to\nredistribution when it comes to more\ntaxation when it comes to the\nenvironment and it's actually men who uh\nand particularly white men sorry um that\ni'm i'm just talking i'm just speaking\nthe data\ni'm sitting here it's particularly like\nmen because yeah the ten most wealthiest\npeople are are white men um you know\nthey have the most to lose so i think\nabout that all the time you know i and\nand i you know i'm i'm bringing this up\nbecause it's something that that i\ngrapple with yeah where i feel like my\nheart is in the right place and 100 i've\nknown when it's not or when i've done\nsomething i'm like this was not for the\nright reason um but yeah how do we how\ndo how do we reconcile those things i\nthink\nand and yeah whether anyone's been\npurified or not and where their journey\nof life goes we'll find out right with\neveryone i i really believe that\neveryone's on this recurring journey of\nlife and it's all to get people to\nrealize that service is the only goal\nand we kind of have to keep having life\nexperiences and failures and\nshortcomings and issues and everything\ngoing wrong to only remind you of that\nand that being the only satisfying thing\nthe\nthe way you reconcile it\nis only through stillness and solitude\nlike if you don't spend enough time\nalone every day and try to hear yourself\nand try to hear the words of your\nspiritual teachers guides texts\nthen you are only going to hear the\nnoise from society outside and that's\nwhat you'll end up following or if\nyou're switching off the noise to listen\nto a podcast like this and all the other\nepisodes that i've i've seen the guests\nyou've had on and the types of\nconversations you're having on you're\nall performing a service\nand by the way everyone who's listening\nis also serving by learning so it's not\nonly the giver that is serving the\nreceiver is also serving i think the\nbigger challenge is also that\nwe've just lacked\nuh examples\nof that and so\nto me it's like i would be traveling\nwith one of our senior monk leaders you\nknow this gentleman 70 years old i'm\nlike\n21 years old\nand every day we'd wake up in the\nmorning\nand he would\nbow down before me on the floor to honor\nthe soul that's within my heart\nand i would do the same back\nbut he would always beat me to it and\nthere was no one watching\nthere were no fanfare there was no\naudience there was no one to do it for\ni wasn't jay shetty like i was just a\nkid who's 21 years old\nand that's how we were taught to behave\nwith each other with that much level of\nrespect now he would have done that with\nanyone in the room so the reason i'm\nsharing that is\nlike when i experience that level of\nmasculine or whatever you want to call\nthat like you know if when i experienced\nthat it gave me faith that a man could\nbe extremely powerful by being extremely\nhumble yeah that a man could be\nextremely\ncould penetrate my heart by being really\nkind and caring and compassionate but if\nyou've never experienced that how are\nyou to believe that that's possible yeah\ni think the first step is to seek and\nfind like i i think it's hard to tell\nanyone to\nthe formula for how to navigate that\nwithout them finding a purpose that is\nbigger than themselves yeah like it's\nit's hard for anyone to navigate life\nsometimes your purpose bigger than\nyourself becomes your family and your\nlove for your family and that's as far\nand wide as your mind wants to go and\nthat's beautiful and for some people it\nbecomes the world and for some people it\nbecomes their town and their city but\neveryone has to have something you know\nthose beautiful words of of martin\nluther king of you know if you have\nnothing to die for you have nothing to\nlive for\nlike that to me is\nthe clear purpose of life where we have\nto seek out what it is that we really\ncare about and what we really believe in\nand that can be your family that's\ntotally fine like this doesn't have to\nbe like a i'm going to become an\nactivist and change the world\nconversation this is\ni care about the quality of life my\nfamily has\nbut i\nthink about quality based on the depth\nof their experience of life not just\nwhat they have\nand\ni'm going to live my life or try and\nlive my life in that way\nand so to me the first step is to seek\nmentors coaches guides guidance it has\nto be it always is i had the fortune of\ninterviewing walter isaacson he's\nfamously known to write the biographies\nof the biggest icons of all time so he\nwrote the official biography of leonardo\nda vinci einstein steve jobs like you\nknow just it's insane and he worked at\ncnn in time before that\nand he wrote a new book about a lady\nnamed jennifer doudner who\nis the founder\nof gene editing\nnow she's a\nfemale scientist who was told by her\nschool teachers that women don't become\nscientists\nright like women's can't be scientists\nshe just won the nobel prize for for her\ndiscovery so\namazing and he just wrote a book about\nher life it's called code breaker the\nreason why i'm sharing all of that is\nthat\nsome\ngirl is going to pick up that book or\nguy both or anyone or they are going to\npick up that book\nand they are going to find their role\nmodel in that book\nwe all find we may not have a monk on\nspeed dial we may not have met a monk\nwhen you're 18 but you're going to find\nwhen you start searching and looking and\nwhen you find that you're going to read\nit you're going to internalize it and\nit's going to change how you think and i\njust feel that encouraging people to\nfind\ncoaches guides and mentors is the best\nthing i can do because there's no one we\nadmire that doesn't have that whether\nthey're an athlete\nwhether they're a singer whether a\nmusician whether they're a videographer\nor editor everyone's had mentors guides\nand coaches but it's become so\nfar removed from our lives today that\neveryone thinks they have to figure it\nout for themselves and that's where the\nmess is created from it sounds like an\nobvious point but it's almost like we\nobviously haven't pushed it enough right\nbecause as a man to take another person\nas your mentor also requires you\nto have humility you've got to forgive\nyourself you've got to be compassionate\nto yourself so the simple act of taking\non a mentor\nactually does more for your masculinity\nthan anything else and also\nbeing a mentor\nyes right you reach a you reach a place\nand you have your success or you have\nachieved something and then\nbeing of service to that person is\nsending the elevator back down but it's\nthe biggest it's the biggest myth of\nmasculinity that we have to do it by\nourselves yes like that we you know that\nwe can't ask for help we can't ask for\nguidance we can't ask for those things\nyeah\nyeah i want to ask you\nsomething real quick jay because um\nbecause i don't know how you do it\nand social media i want to talk about\nsocial media for a second\nwe talked about a little bit when i\njoined your podcast\nbut\nwe know what social media in many ways\ndoes to our brains we get dopamine hits\nleft and right much more than you know\nwe ever have in human history like\ndislike followers comments all of which\nare contributing i think to uh a\ndifferent kind of pandemic\num which is like extremely low\nself-worth seeking external validation\nand everybody wanting to become the\ncenter of attention an influencer to\nhave influence\nand then you mix in like what's becoming\ntrendy or popular or woke and culture\nand then you have service right and\nthese lines get very blurred like i've\nstruggled like do i post that do i not\npost that like oh that didn't get as\nmany likes and i still have those\nthoughts\num and i just imagine 15 year olds and\n12 year olds now that are getting social\nmedia and all of these things and i\nremember watching this like i swear she\nwas eight years old she was doing she\nwas by herself in a cvs\ndoing a tick tock holding the phone by\nherself and i was really confused and i\nlooked at that and my heart broke just\nthinking about the performative aspect\nof what social media does\nhow\nhow have you\nstayed\nabove water how have you\nnot been affected or or are you ever\naffected and i guess that's my question\nis are you also affected by if something\ndoesn't have a lot of likes or if a\npodcast doesn't have a lot of downloads\nbecause you seem impermeable in that way\nlike you have the teachings you're so\nrooted in the teachings and in your\nmeditation and your practice that it's\nlike you're not shaken by the outside\nworld but you're you're teaching people\nthis wisdom this ancient wisdom but yet\nyou're doing it from the swamp how do\nyou stay out of it and do you struggle\never\nyou fall in and you fall in again yeah\nall the time social media was my last\nresort\nto try and share a message that i deeply\nbelieved the world needed\nand so if i had it my way i would never\nhave taken to social media i would have\ndone it through one of these official\nchannels that wouldn't give me a chance\nbut\nand i think people don't think that\npeople think oh yeah you join social\nmedia because you want to get a it's\nlike i joined social media because i\ndidn't know any other way to spread the\nmessage so going back to mistakes on\nsocial media or or failures i've fallen\ninto it so many times that i fall into\non a daily basis if your life\nrevolves around serving through social\nmedia you have to become\nphenomenal at social media strategy\nit's you can't separate the two you have\nto the problem\nis when the strategy\novertakes the sincerity\nthe problem is when the strategy\novertakes the creativity or overshadows\nthe creativity the problem is when the\nstrategy just becomes a game\nand now you're just living in this fake\nworld you've created and that's the\nproblem when you just look at the likes\nand you don't look at the comments when\nyou look at the views but you don't look\nat the engagement and when i say\nengagement i mean the depth of it what\nare people saying how are they feeling\nthat's what humanizes it again for me so\nthat's what i'm holding on to is the\nhumanizing of it\nof of seeing like how is this genuinely\nhaving a human impact not a data impact\nand i think that's where our mindset as\nstrategist versus spiritualist goes is\nas a strategist you're meant to think\ndata\nbut as a spiritualist you're meant to\nthink depth\nand so you can't let data overshadow\ndepth and what i love about algorithms\nis that they always keep you humble\nyou will never beat the algorithm\nit will always keep you humble so if\nyou're actually doing it for likes and\nlike love and hearts you will give up\nbut if you're doing it because you just\nwant to find what is going to connect\nwith people\nwhat is going to resonate what is going\nto cut through\nthen that's something that will keep you\nhumble in the process of it because\nyou'll never win you've been able to\nseparate\nhow a video does or performs from my own\nyour own self-worth oh for sure and i\nthink that is really kind of the key and\nthe question for when that tick tock or\nthat instagram video turns off\nthey're left with themselves yeah and\nyou know one of the things you teach is\nbeing with yourself but if they don't\nknow how to be with themselves\nso i guess this is this is an\nopportunity i'm asking you to\nto talk to them if someone's listening\nright now\nwho's struggling with that because i\nhave struggled with it especially from a\nservice perspective like i'm here to be\nof service why am i making this about\nwhy do i care why should i care i don't\ncare do i care i do care\ni care too much no i didn't get you know\nand it's like should i post that no but\nthis is my platform i want to post\nwhatever i want i want to post a picture\nof the sunset but no one's going to like\nthe picture of the sunset justin to post\nsomething and and i've had these\nconversations with myself and the fact\nthat i'm having them drive me crazy and\nyou just strike me as somebody who\ndoesn't have them as much\num and maybe that's because you have a\nsense of self uh the practical answer is\nall the work goes\nin thinking about something\nup front\nso when you set your intention when\nyou're creating a piece of content so my\nbook's\nthe the biggest deepest most meaningful\nthing i put out in the world in my\nopinion\nand i spent a lot of time writing it\nresearching it i remember thinking about\nyour experience every day you were on a\nmission three four hours a day you were\nliterally yeah yeah and and we\ni knew that i wanted science in it and i\nwanted monk research in it and so i had\ni had monks researching i had\na scientific researcher like it was a\nreal\nteam project to get it to be what i\nwanted it to be\nand\ni put in all the work up front\nbecause my intention was if you\ncreate something with the love with the\nservice with the intention of that then\nthat's what people are going to feel\nwhereas if i create it with the\nintention of going viral or which which\nyou can't actually do because\nviral by nature and by what it is means\nthat you can't predict it like people\ncan do that\nuh people decide that with the book if\nyou're obsessed with x result it ruins\nthe process yeah so for me when i'm in\nthe process i really shut my windows and\ni close the doors and i'm like this\nprocess has to be as pure as possible as\npossible as possible so it's not 100 but\nit's as good as it can get\nand\nwhen we look at and you know when we\ntalk about how do we share this with the\nworld let's also make the process really\ngood are we sharing in the right places\nare we getting it right and then when\nyou share it you know that you've done\neverything you possibly could to make it\nworthwhile\nand if it doesn't work you can take that\nbecause you've done everything the\nproblem is when you put something out\nwith the desire of oh it's going to do\ngreat i know i masterminded this it's\nperfect and then it doesn't do well then\nit affects you whereas when you've built\nall your self-worth in the process of\nthat and so i sent my publishers an\nemail\nand and i'm saying this because i'm\nproud of myself for doing this and i'm\ngoing to say that here\ni sent them an email the day before the\nbook came out and we had no idea what\nwas going to happen or anything and i\nsaid i just want to thank you for this\nprocess it's been the best process i've\never had i love you guys it's been\namazing\nuh it's you've been the best team i've\never worked with i really appreciate you\nfrom the editor down to the the fact\nchecker down to this whatever everyone\non the team and i just want you to know\ni'm already proud of what we've achieved\nand i sent that email off to them\nand i remember the president of the\ncompany that i worked with he replied to\nme because jay we never get one of these\nemails the day before the book comes out\nit's like we always get this if the book\ndoes well or whatever and i was like no\ni genuinely feel so proud of what we've\nachieved already whatever happens\nhappens i had my uk publisher tell me\njay you know what we're probably not\ngonna hit number one on the sunday times\nin the uk\nuh because you know there's some big\nhitters in the uk coming out this week\nare you okay with it i was like dude i\nhave written the best book i possibly\ncould we've done the best launch that i\nprobably could have done i couldn't have\ndone anymore i'm good like whatever i\ndon't care\nand it's like to me that's the only way\nto not care is that you put all your\nheart into the creation so that's the\npractical answer wow the philosophical\nanswer and and the more spiritual answer\nis\ni'm flawed\ni do seek validation in what people\nthink of me\ni do\nuh\nget upset if someone doesn't like my\nvideos and like someone\nand i forgive myself i'm compassionate\nand i start over again\nlike that's just the real answer like\nthat's just the truth\ni mess up i fall down\ni get that i'm\ni i do get worried about oh well will i\nbe relevant next year oh i do get\nworried about like oh will people care\nabout me i do get worried about like\nhave i said anything good on this\npodcast right now like is there anything\nthat i've said that is actually even\nworth this podcast i do think about that\nlike every time i think about that every\ntime i record a solo episode of my\npodcast\nand i think about it all the time but\nwhat do i do i allow myself to feel that\ni allow myself to experience it\ni forgive myself for judging myself and\nthen i start again and i start every day\nas if it was new\nand my wife and i have this amazing\nability we both have it is that we can\ngo to sleep forget the night before and\nstart again and i think that my memory\nliterally does that i erase\nall of my failures and mistakes from the\nday before and just start afresh every\nday because it's the only way i know\nto allow myself to have another go at it\njust the idea of allowing yourself to\nhave some compassion for yourself and i\nthink everyone who's sitting out there\nwho's judging themselves\nexcept that you judge yourself be\ncompassionate but then seek to redirect\nthat energy whatever table you're at\nand whoever's at that table\nis what you judge yourself by\nso when we heard that famous quote of\nyou are the\naverage of the five people you spend the\nmost time with\nactually what the truth is your values\nbecome the average of the five people\nand their values i love that uh when we\ntalked you and i did like a\npandemic check-in with like a man enough\nkind of check-in and you had admitted\nthat you were addicted to video games\nfor a little bit i was and and that was\nbig in the book i talk about you know an\nongoing struggle i've had with porn\nsince i was you know a kid and um and\nyou said it caught you by surprise that\nyou were addicted you found yourself\nlike you know taking all of this emotion\nand just playing video games and hours\nwould pass by yeah i'm curious which one\nby the way uh so fifa\nnba 2k all right with you uh 2k 21 now i\nhave uh and uh assassin's creed which is\nreally messed up wait wait\na monk plain assassin's creed yes yes\nso i'm curious how bad did it get and\nwhat pulled you out or is that still an\nongoing thing that you're you're just\nstruggling with a little bit or or is it\na you know oh my gosh so yeah we just\nfound out as the pandemic i realized we\nwere going to be stuck indoors i thought\nmaybe this is going to last a month\nthat's what i thought\nand\ni was like all right well\nwhat am i going to do at this time like\na lot of things were getting cancelled\nat the time and things like that\nand we had a friend staying my wife's\nfriends staying with us so they would\nalways be spending time together and\neverything so i was pretty much on my\nown and instead of meditating more or\nreading more\ni\nordered a playstation\nwhich by the way i hadn't played video\ngames for 10 years like i just hadn't i\nhadn't watched tv religious like\nproperly like watch the series on tv i'd\nwatch movies i love movies i didn't\nwatch a tv show for like 10 years but i\nliterally would sit there and play hours\nand hours of video games and i think i\ndidn't\nstop playing for like it took like three\nto four weeks before i realized that i'd\nbeen playing video games for eight hours\na day\neight hours time was wasted\nuh all of i thought i was dealing well\nwith what was going on but actually i\nwas just using that as my escape to what\nwas actually happening in the world\nand i know it sounds\nstupid it's like oh video games but it's\nnot it's terrible i mean when i would\nplay assassin's creed i would walk out\nthere my wife was just like you look\nlike you've just exited a war are you\nokay like she would literally look at me\nlike okay our camera crew's laughing\nthey're like oh i feel that she was she\nwas literally like are you like she\nwould see me come out of the room like\ni'll come out the cave of like she's\nlike are you okay like i don't think\nthat game's good for you like i don't\nthink that game's good for your energy\nand it was like three to four weeks in\nwhere i realized it was like got the\nworld's suffering right now like i\nshould be serving i'm sitting here\nplaying video games but\ni have to allow myself and cut myself\nsome slack that that was my escape at\nthe time i just hadn't slowed down and i\nhadn't stopped for like the last three\nto four years yeah i hadn't allowed\nmyself to have any downtime because i\nwas building and serving and creating\nthat that was my outlet\nyou you still realize that it starts to\ndamage your relationships like my mom\nwas like\nwhy are you not calling like i'm not\ncalling my mom and i'm playing eight\nhours of video again yeah i'm not\ncalling my sister and i'm playing a\nhouse of video games i'm not spending\ntime on my wife you know it's kind of\nlike anything that doesn't have\nmoderation involved yeah that is toxic\nright you drink too much water and then\nmy therapist put it this way if\nit's fine it's acceptable behavior if\nyou're doing it and afterwards you don't\nfeel any shame yes yes yes yes yes but\nif you feel bad or terrible and yet you\ndo it again then you should look at it\nwell there are bad things you men can do\nthat they don't feel shame about\nwell yeah i'm best for somebody who's\nlike by the time you get to therapy and\nyou're actually working on that thing\nand you're like hey you're trying to\nunderstand it by that point it's like\nokay well this is probably unhealthy for\nyou if you're if you're that reflective\nand you're already there\nright the answer is yes but yeah if it's\nit's interesting that it seems to be the\nwomen in your life that sort of pointed\nthat out always like the women women\nlike my mother my sister and from my\nwife i've just learned like like i\ndedicate my book to her because\nshe is more monk than i'll ever be and\nthat's so humbling when when we got\nmarried i was like the guy who'd been a\nmonk and meditating for all these years\nand even some of my\nuh spirit spiritual friends were like oh\nyou can't marry her she's new to\nspirituality etc etc\nand my wife\nlike\nmy wife wakes up earlier than i do she\nmeditates for longer than i do she is\nshe's amazing like she's far more\nspiritual than i'll ever be and\ni love that because i need that she is\namazing yeah and i need that if she\nwasn't there maybe i wouldn't be who i\nam today like maybe i would have got\nmore deviated from the path and and lost\nmy weight jay you're you're incredible\nwe're going to go to these uh last\nquestions\nwelcome to this week's man enough\npodcast rapid fire questions liz do you\nwant to start all right\nso rapid fire are you ready\nwhen is the last time that you cried\n[Music]\nit was probably when i was you know what\ni yeah it was probably this uh because i\ndon't live in the same country as my mom\nanymore and because the pandemic i don't\nget to see her as much anymore i used to\ngo back regularly i feel like whenever\ni'm leaving london and my mom cries i\ncry because\nit's my mom like i love her like she did\never she's done everything for me and\nand the thing about love is there's no\nway of repaying it so you can only keep\ntrying\nand i think that that's the beauty of\nlove and also the\nthe hard part of love is that you can't\nrepay real love and i feel like i'm\nalways in debt to my mom in a good way\nand so\nyeah i'd say that tell me something that\nother people value that you don't\ni'd say it's probably um\nbeing understood\ni'm okay with being misunderstood\nwow i just think it's reality i just\ndon't think you will ever be understood\nby everyone and so\nit's okay like i don't value being\nunderstood and i love that i used to i\nused to love being i want to take that\nas a superpower yo\nuh i'm gonna add one what are you afraid\nof i'm afraid of\nnot reaching my potential\ni'm genuinely afraid of that i i do\nthink about that like i think about the\nfuture and i'm like\ni don't want to die having thought that\ni didn't try my best to do everything\nthat i was meant to do\nand\nmy my teacher told me something once\nwhich which set that the pedestal of\npotential much higher\nand he asked me once he said well what\nare you doing right now as an update and\nso i was telling him i was like i'm\ndoing this podcast and we launched this\nbook and i was just sharing it out of\nlove and and gratitude to him\nand he said he said to me he goes you\nknow for for all of these things that\nyou're doing\ni have no expectation\nbut i simply demand the purity of your\nheart\nand i was just like oh that's a lot\nharder\nand and that's my biggest fear that i\ndon't live up to that because um\ni feel like i would have wasted all the\nlove that he's given me over the years\nand the amount of investment that these\nteachers have put into a random kid from\nlondon who is\non his way to do all the stupid things\nthat people do and they they've they've\nloved me through\nso much\nand it upsets me to think that i\ni mess it up\nso yeah\nwhen was the last time you apologized to\nsomeone\nuh today to my wife\nwe were doing a video together and i was\nrushing to come here or somewhere else\nand i was i had the worst energy and she\nstopped me and she looked me in the face\nand she was like\nare you okay like what's up like i can\ntell that you're just frustrated to be\nhere but you need to do this right now\nand are you okay with that and and then\ni was like all right let's just do it i\ndon't like your energy right now.\nand then i went back to and i gave her a\nhug and i was like i'm really sorry like\ni'm just you know i've had a lot on this\nlast week and whatever so yeah thank you\nfor sure because yeah and the final\nquestion what does it mean to be man\nenough\noh\ni think in my opinion what it means to\nbe man enough\nis to\nthere's a beautiful statement by russell\nbarkley where he said that\npeople who need the most love\noften ask for it in the most unloving\nways\nand i think what it means to be man\nenough is to be able to approach\neveryone\nwith that love\nrecognizing\nthat the pain they're causing you or\nanyone else is coming from a place of\nthem being unloved at some point in\ntheir life\nwell jay shetty you my friend are man\nenough thank you so much for being here\nwith us thank you liz thank you thank\nyou so much for doing this in person\ni know i know you had to move a lot of\nstuff around and make this happen so\nthank you so much this is so special i\nlearned something so sweet if you want\neven
