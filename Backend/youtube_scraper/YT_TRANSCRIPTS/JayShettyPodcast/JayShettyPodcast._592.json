    "transcript": "i was in a straight relationship with a\nman and was engaged and my life was\ntaking a course that i thought i could\nsee the ending but when i was in it i\njust thought this isn't it for me when\nthat ended it forced me to take a look\nat what is it about myself that needs to\nchange or that i need to accept and\ni realized that at the time was just too\nqueer to marry a man\nand i wasn't identifying as female\nanymore\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow i'm so grateful\nfor the incredible community that we\nhave and just how engaged you are and\nhow thoughtful you are in the insights\nthat you take away from every episode\nnow today's guest needs no introduction\nwhatsoever but i am so grateful that i\nget to interview them and spend time\nwith them today i\nmet them probably first time a couple of\nyears ago and then we met on a set and\nnow we're getting to be together again\ni'm speaking about someone that i\nbelieve\nis one of the most vulnerable\nhonest\ngenuine and sincere humans that exists\nand someone who\ntransparently shares their truth\nover and over and over again no matter\nhow difficult or challenging it may be\nso that we can benefit from it i'm\ntalking about the one and only demi\nlovato demi thank you so much for doing\nthis i am so grateful honestly i can't\ntell you how much i want to give you a\nbig hug right now\noh wow thank you thank you so much that\nwas such an incredible intro and\ni just um it means a lot to me that you\ninvited me on here and i'm excited to\nchat with you i know me too me too last\ntime we were together you were\ninterviewing me\nuh yeah for your awesome show and i got\nto sit down with you we were sitting on\nthese amazing clouds\nand this beautiful set that you and your\nteam have designed and today we're doing\nit virtually but i still feel your\npresence like i did that day\nand i wanted to start by asking you just\njust a couple of thoughts to get going\nbut you know for a lot of us the\nquarantine gave us time to think about\nnew things i was wondering if you\ndeveloped any new hobbies or started\ndoing something recently that you hadn't\ndone before or experimenting with\nanything at all so quarantine totally\nchanged my life and um\ni\ni feel like i picked up so many little\nthings that i just didn't used to do i\nused to\nnever spend time outside and i feel like\nnow i go outside and i play with my\nsquirrels my backyard squirrels and\num like you know just feeding the\nanimals in my backyard is something that\ni never used to do and now i do that and\ni have a connection with these little\nbeings and they're they're so sweet and\nthen um i got into candle making wow and\nlike making making your own body oils\nthings like that fragrances and then\ni also got into photography\nand then i learned\nso much about myself so\nit's just um it's been quite the little\njourney that's incredible i love hearing\nthat by the way my wife loves feeding\nall the animals in our back garden as\nwell until they ended up until they\nended up now digging up huge holes in\nthe ground\nbecause she keeps she keeps encouraging\nthem to come back too much so now\nthere's all these potholes in the ground\nuh but i love that you have to keep them\nfed\nyes yes exactly but candle making\nsounds phenomenal i mean my wife and i\nactually tried to\ncreate a scent and it's actually really\nchallenging it's it's so\nunderrated as a skill it takes so much\neffort to actually create a beautiful\nscent right yes i it actually does take\num a lot of practice a lot of skill i've\ni feel like for every\ncandle that i\nnail\nthere's like 12 candles that i didn't\nthat that are going to the trash um\nor or like last year i just ended up\ngiving them as gifts and i was like look\ni don't know which ones smell good\nhere take it\njust try it\ni love that well demi i you know you're\nsomeone who's always sharing and talking\nbut i want to want to rewind a bit with\nyou\nand i wanted to go back to\ndemi as a child\nand i wanted to ask you when you were\nyoung\nyoung like tiny young i don't you are\nyoung i mean tiny young uh when you were\nreally young a young child who did you\nwant to be what did you want to be what\nkind of things did you think about what\nwere you fascinated by well i was a very\nambitious little five-year-old\nbut that five-year-old said\ni want to be the next shirley temple\nand\nbecause i knew who shirley temple was i\nknew what she had accomplished at such a\nyoung age i wanted to\ni wanted to do that and i wanted to be\nthe youngest person to ever win a grammy\nthe youngest person to ever win an oscar\num and\ndidn't work out that's okay\num but\nyou know that that's how how much i\ndreamed when i was younger and\num so i've always dreamed really really\nbig that's that's incredible and and\nwhen you\ndreamt big and of course you've had\nincredible success across your career\nincredible impact\nand\nand you know won so many awards and\naccolades but it seems like\nthe impact that you've had as time has\ngone on has become deeper and more\nprofound i genuinely feel that as\nsomeone who's been an admirer of yours\nand a fan of yours and watching from\nafar but i just feel that\nawards and accolades can't have the\nimpact on people's lives that you've had\nthrough through the work that you do\nuh off mic and off screen\nand i wonder if there was a experience\nin your childhood or something you went\nthrough that\nencouraged you to be that way or maybe\neven something that you forgot about for\na long time but was there an event or\nsomething that happened when you were\nyounger that gave you an inkling or a\nfeeling of of the type of work that\nyou're doing today\ni used to deal with depression at a\nreally young age and i always told\nmyself that if i made it i would\nhelp people\nand um i kind of like made this promise\nwith with god and i said\nuh if you\nmake me\na\nfamous singer then i\nwill try to make the world a better\nplace and\num\nand then\nso i i became a singer and and here i am\ntrying to make the world a better place\ni i talk about consciousness a lot\nbecause it's something that i feel like\nis extremely important um expanding our\nconsciousness is now like my\nprimary goal as a a citizen of\nthe earth\num just trying to help people expand\ntheir consciousness is really important\nto me because i feel like that's the\nonly way we can\num\nwe can move forward as a species\nand\nyeah\nwhen i was younger it used to be i want\nto help people with depression i want to\nhelp people who were bullied because i\nwas bullied in school\num and so i've always kind of just taken\na part of my life\nand\nthought okay how where did i need a role\nmodel or where did i need\nuh support from someone that i love in\nthe industry but i didn't get it growing\nup and that's what i've always tried to\nbe for people is something that i never\nhad growing up\ni find it so powerful when someone turns\ntheir pain into their purpose or\nsomething that broke them into a\nbreakthrough for other people i love\nthat transformation that when you've\nbeen through something that's really\nhurtful but you use that to help other\npeople heal i think there's there's so\nmuch goodness and greatness in that\nand\nas you've been doing that\ni\nwonder what were the things that helped\nyou expand your consciousness i love\nthat i love what you said i want to help\npeople expand their consciousness which\nis such a beautiful aspiration what were\nsome of the things that opened you up to\nthose ideas were those ideas that you\nalways had or was there something that\nyou experienced that helped you expand\nyour own\nmost of my life i've spent trying to to\nfigure out\nwhat it is in my life that's going wrong\nand how i can fix it\nand\nin 2020 when the world\nshut down\nand we were stuck at home\ni wasn't focusing so much on myself\nanymore because\nthere were so many things going on in\nthe news\nuh that that were so\nthey felt so much bigger than what i was\ndealing with\nand i realized in that period of time\nthat my life kind of shifted it was\nalways\ni'm going to talk about my story what i\nwent through how i got out of it and i'm\ngoing to help others and then it was\nlike in 2020 i thought\noh my gosh this is so much bigger than\nme this is so much bigger than just my\nstory and i need to get out there and i\nneed to help people\ntell theirs and so it became about\nsharing stories that weren't my own on\nmy social media pages\num\nand then from there it kind of became\ni don't know i started meditating a lot\nmeditation was something for me that was\nreally transformative because i really\nwent inward and\nwhen i went inward my mind grew outward\nif that makes sense it does and and and\ni don't i don't know how that works but\nit it just does\nyeah that's that's such a beautiful way\nof explaining meditation i i love that\ndefinition i've never i've never heard\nof it before and it reminded me of\nsomething though so in the vedic\ntradition there's a word that i think\nyou'll like\nand it's in the sanskrit language and\nit's it's\nwell it sounds like this and i'll\nexplain what it means it sounds like\nantar akash and what that means is inner\nsky\nand so it says that we all have this\ninner sky\nand we're all like enamored by the\nsunsets and the sunrise and the sky\nthat's outward but there's a sky inside\nof us\nand yes there's a whole universe there's\na whole universe there's a new universe\ninside of us yeah when you experience\nthat it's\ntraveling inward and i think we all are\nso fascinated we're traveling and we all\nfeel so stuck when we can't travel but\nthere's a whole journey within uh that\nthat's open for us all to take which it\nsounds like you've been on i feel like i\ndid more traveling in 2020 than i did my\nwhole career because most of the\ntraveling that i did was inward and the\njourneys that i've taken\num\njust personally have been so\nprofound and\nlife-changing\nabsolutely i mean you've gone on lots of\njourneys i want to touch on one\nspecifically to start with but i'd love\nto hear about others\nand you know\ngender expression has been a sensitive\ntopic to so many people\nbut you were very open brave and\ncourageous to be able to share with your\ncommunity\nearlier this year\nand i wanted to\ntalk to you about that because i feel\nthat that's\nsometimes when you're looking within and\nyou're traveling you come across things\nmaybe that you didn't know about or you\ncome across things that maybe were\nhidden away or covered over or pushed\naside or maybe they weren't allowed to\nbreathe tell us what it was like when\nyou\nstarted becoming aware of your identity\nand was that a surprise or was it\nsomething that you knew was there but\nthat you just felt you didn't get to\nexpand your consciousness to it i felt\nlike it was the latter of what you just\nsaid i felt like\nit was always there\nand i always knew that i was different i\nalways\ni always felt like like like one day it\nwould click and and finally i felt like\nit did i was in a relationship um\nin a straight relationship\nuh with a man and was engaged and my\nlife was taking a course that\ni\ni thought i could see the ending but at\nthe but when i was in it i just thought\nthis isn't\nthis isn't it for me and\nwhen that ended it forced me to take a\nlook at what is it about myself that i'm\nthat\nthat needs to change or that i need to\naccept and\ni realized that\ni i'm too\ni would at the time was just too queer\nto marry a man\nand i wasn't identifying as female\nanymore\nand\ni realized that because i had become\nfriends with\nuh\na good friend of mine named alok vade\nmanon and i went to a poetry slam\nshow or performance that they did and\nthey talked about being non-binary and\nthat show really resonated with me but\nit was right after that that i kind of\njumped into a hetero relationship and\nyou know really started to play that\nrole of like the female\ni i just\nbeing engaged you know the whole thing i\njust\ni wasn't allowing myself time\nto get to know myself before i jumped\ninto something and i think that\nuh 2020 being stuck at home\nand you're having you're forced to take\na look at yourself outside of the lights\nand the cameras and the this and that i\nrealized that\ni'm not\nwho i am on stage and\nand also there's so much more to me than\nthat\num and that was a really cool lesson to\nlearn that's so beautiful thank you so\nmuch for sharing that and\nyou know every i've heard you shared\nthat transition before but\nas you as i'm hearing you say it now i\ni love how it's giving yourself\npermission to be more of yourself and\nin my own way i i can resonate with it\nbecause i remember when i graduated i\ndecided to go and live as a monk for\nthree years instead of going going into\nthe world\nand those three years gave me time to\nreally build a relationship with myself\nand whenever anyone asks me like what\ndid you do during that time i said the\nbiggest thing\ni gained from that time was that i got\nthree years where there were no opinions\nno expectations no obligations no noise\nno predictions projections\nor interpretations of who i was or who i\nshould be\nand i just got to be\nand and that i it sounds like there's a\nsimilar experience and the solitude of\nbeing away in your case from the lights\nand the cameras in my case just from the\nnormal life i would have led\nthere's so much greatness there how did\nyou\nwhen you when you're doing that process\nthough demi there can be so many\nuncomfortable\nawkward\ndifficult things that you experience and\nsee and hear\nhow did you create a mindset that\nallowed you to accept that with grace to\nreceive that with openness rather than\nstart to judge or criticize yourself\nwhat did you do to navigate that i had a\nlot of conversations with people around\nme that were familiar with my situation\nand what i was experiencing and\nand what i had learned about being\nnon-binary and gender non-conforming\nand so\ni had a lot of support around me\nto navigate through\nthose times and\nand through those conversations\nand\nyeah i just started to\ni started to try on\nthe\nnon-binary identity and\nthe longer that i wore it the the more\nit felt right and\nyou for me\ni know that there's going to be people\nthat don't accept\nme for\nhow i identify\num\nbut there's always going to be someone\nthat doesn't accept you for some reason\nso\ni just kind of take it with a grain of\nsalt when somebody\nisn't ready to\nlearn\nwhat being non-binary or gender\nnon-conforming means\nand i just think to myself inside my\nhead when i when i hear someone\neither purposely mess up my pronouns or\njust disregard you know i just think\nokay they're not ready yet and one day\nthey will be and that's okay\nyeah i saw that i remember when you\nposted it on instagram that was such a\nyou have such a forgiving\nopen\npatient\napproach to people\ntrying to get to understand you and i\nfind that so\nrefreshing and endearing because i think\nwe're living at a time where\nuh that\nnot and i'm not speaking about\nspecifically when we talk about gender\ni'm saying just generally\nthere's a struggle with patience right\nnow in society and and some of that is\nneeded we need some urgency we need\nchange fast we do need pushing\nwhat's allowing you to remain\npatient and gentle with people as they\nare trying to understand not just you\nbut understand\nuh so many other people in the community\nand and maybe as you said someone's\npurposely messing up your pronouns or\nthey they may not be taking the time how\nhow are you developing that patience and\nlove and compassion well that patience\nlove and compassion doesn't just come\nfrom anywhere it definitely comes from a\npractice of\nmeditating\nhaving grace and\nsome people just aren't ready and that's\nokay and um meditation helps me a lot to\nhave grace and compassion for those\npeople because when i\ndo sit down to meditate and i'm in a\nplace where i'm angry\ni sit and i think and i and i\nyou know i try to clear my mind but if i\ncan't i\ni think through it and\ni end up coming to a point where i just\ni release the anger and\nmaybe it was because\ni know i'm a leo and leo's can be\nvery stubborn that like i work so hard\nnot to be stubborn\nand so i try to to have grace because it\nis so easy for me to hold a grudge\nagainst people i can hold a grudge and\nand never speak to someone again and\nthat's not a trait that i'm proud of\nbecause\ni've realized that that's not a very\nhuman\nthing to do\nbeing human is having compassion and and\nunderstanding and respect for people\neven when they mess up and\num\nbecause we all do we all mess up and\ni've i've messed up a bunch but\ni know that because i've messed up i can\nhave grace and mercy for other people\nwhen they mess up i love that i ca i\ncannot tell you how beautiful that is to\nhear and i can't wait for everyone to\nhear that i think it's such a\ntrue true true statement that the\nmistakes we've all made which we all\nmake i've made loads of mistakes and you\nwere saying you have to\nall those mistakes that they ground us\nthey humble us they they remind us of\nhow we're all\nuh no one is immune to making a mistake\nand anyone at any time can make a\nmistake knowingly or\nunknowingly and actually i'm going to\nplay that part specifically to my wife\nbecause my wife is a leo and she is so\nstubborn\nand she knows it yes and so what you\njust said to me i did not know that\ntrait that i didn't know that was a leo\ntrait\nso i'm gonna play that exact part to my\nwife and be like look what demi's saying\nit's about the only thing i know about\nmy astrology sign but\nyeah i did not know that at all so now i\ni am feeling that i can be more\ncompassionate towards my wife when she\nwhen she is stubborn uh because yeah\nbecause it's part of part of the traits\nuh tell me a bit about\nyou know\nwhat do you think when you're one of the\nthings that you did this year and this\nwas actually when i\nwhen i first watched your documentary\ndancing with the devil\nuh i was\ncompletely blown away like it was it was\nincredible uh it was it was incredible\nit's just i i couldn't believe where you\ntook us and where you were allowed us in\nand\nand i i know you said in this episode in\nthis podcast you just said that\nyou know you shared your story and then\nyou realized the perspective that it was\nso much bigger than your story which by\nthe way is\nagain such a wonderful perspective\nat the same time\nyou've been through so much that\nwhen you share it helped so many you\ntalked about so many you talked about an\nexperience with rape you talked about\nexperiences with\nyou know sexual abuse and assault and\nwhen i hear about those things and i\nstill see you coming and rising like a\nphoenix you know from from all these\nlike\nchallenges and and pain i wonder\nwhere is your strength coming from today\nlike where do you look to for strength\nyou said meditation there and i'd love\nfor you to guide us through your\nmeditation practice is there anything\nelse that's giving you strength what's\ngiving me strength i mean there's\nstrength all around me\nand that's my support system whether\nthat's my friends or my treatment team\nor it's\nmy friends my family\nyou know it's it's people around me\ni always have support and i never feel\nalone which is beautiful um\nbut yeah i think some of my my\nmeditations i i listen to guided\nmeditations\num but i also\ni like to tone my chakras\nand so i do like a sound bath and\num\nand yeah those are like\nthe the great thing about meditation for\nme is that i thought that you had to be\ncompletely silent still with your eyes\nclosed and your hands like this and\nyou know there's different types of\nmeditation there's different as long as\nyou are\nquieting your thoughts and trying to\njust\nchill\nthen like then then it's good then like\nyou can meditate with your eyes open you\ncan meditate while you're doing things\nit's just\npeople don't realize how how easy it is\nand you don't have to be perfect at it\nand that was what\nkept me away from meditating for so long\nwas trying to be perfect at it yeah\nthank you thank you for simplifying it\nfor everyone i i couldn't agree more i\nwhen i when i learned how to meditate\nwhen i was 18\ni was introduced to three practices\nbreath work\nvisualization and mantra and sound\nand it was so refreshing to realize that\nthere was breath work for the body there\nwas visualization for the mind there was\nmantra for the soul and the spirit and\nthe energy\nand to me i was like wow there's there's\na menu for meditation and yeah and you\ncould you could try which one worked for\nyou and you could build it and as you\nsaid there is no perfect meditator\nand the practice of trying to be perfect\nis almost as far away from meditation as\nas there can be so i i love that you're\nsimplifying it for so many people\nand and making it natural what's what's\nbeen one of your favorite meditation\nexperiences have you had any that have\nreally\nmaybe maybe you've gained a message or\nan insight or you've just been able to\nbe really calm has there been an\nexperience that you could share with us\nthere's been so many experiences that i\ncould share with you i mean\nit's\nhaving a realization about things that\nyou thought you would never figure out\nin your lifetime\num relationships that you thought were\ncompletely over and then all of a sudden\nthey pop into your mind during\nmeditation and you feel the need to\nreach out to them so you do\nand all of a sudden you've rekindled a\nrelationship or you've repaired a\nrelationship that that stubbornness i\nthought i was holding on to um\nyou know for for good\nit's when i was able to release that\nstubbornness and so\nsometimes i feel like my intuition is\nwhen i meditate it just like raises its\nhand and is like hey you know like\nlisten listen to me here's a song idea\nhere's a reach out to this person or\nor even sometimes weird things happen\nwhere\ni don't reach out to that person but\nthey reach out to me\nyou know and and it's interesting how\nyour intuition starts to work when you\nreally start to listen to it\nyes yes and that is such a good point\nmost of us whenever we talk about the\nword intuition a lot of people say well\njay i don't hear any voices and the\ntruth is we don't hear voices because\nwe've been ignoring it for so long\nand you're right that as soon as you\nstart to listen to it it gets louder it\ngets stronger it gets more powerful\nthat's that's such a great point that as\nsoon as you start listening even if it's\nthe tiniest bit of intuition\nif you start listening to it that voice\ngets so much more stronger and powerful\nand i you're so right demi that in that\nmeditation\nyou're giving space for that voice\nyes you are you you're giving you're\nputting that voice in an amphitheater\nyou know what i mean you're giving that\nvoice\na huge platform to to\nreach out and say hey this is what's on\nmy mind\nyour voice sounds very cute though\nsaying hey it with a little hand\nthat sounds like an adult that sounds\nlike an adorable voice it seems like an\nemoji with a voice\nwhereas yeah whereas whereas you know\nsomeone else might be like i don't like\nthe voice in my head\nbut that's the noise that's the noise\nthe voice in our head should feel like a\nsmiley face emoji that's like please\nlisten to me please yeah yeah please\ni hope anyone who's listening to this\nright now if you're not watching you\nhave to go back and look at the video of\nof\ndemi\ndoing hey because it's adorable and and\nyou have you have to see it because now\nevery time i hear my voice my intuition\ni'm going to see that little yeah good\nso\ni love that i love that you're laughing\ntoo because one of the things that's\nalways been important to me is that\nmeditation and mindfulness and\nconsciousness it can be fun and it can\nbe playful yes and it doesn't have to be\nthis\nreally like\nit's disciplined but it's it's not this\nartificial hardcore\nyou know rough and like it can it can be\nplayful and fun i could you share a bit\nabout that because i see you as such a\nfun-loving person and even now we're\nboth laughing about\nvoices in our head\nbut\nbut tell me a bit about that have you\nhave you allowed your playfulness to\ncome through more and and your energy\nyes i quieted\nmy\nintense meditation personal trainer\nvoice\nthat was in my head you know like when\nyou go to the gym and\nand you have a personal trainer or\nsomebody that's like really pushing you\nand\nthat just doesn't work for me and that\nis the voice that i had in my head every\ntime i went to meditate it was\nstop opening your eyes stop thinking\nabout this stop thinking about that and\nit was just like\nto the point where\nthree minutes would go by and it'd be\nlike i'm already over this\nyou know what i'm saying and so i had to\nreally quiet that voice down\nand\nwhen i started meditating especially\noutside you know there's gonna be noises\nthere's gonna be animals things like\nthat planes that fly over\nand if i felt myself wanting to open my\neyes i just allowed myself to because i\nthought what are you going to gain\nfrom opening your eyes and just taking a\nsecond to appreciate the sound that\nyou're hearing and sometimes i had\nreally beautiful insights sometimes i\nwas like wow that's a big plane\nbut like\nother times i had beautiful moments\nwhere\ni thought one time for instance um\ni was outside and there were all these\nbugs and i was trying to meditate and i\nthought to myself\nwhat do i do about the bugs right like\nwhat can i do because i'm just shooing\nthem away and then i had this moment\nwhere i thought\nnobody was shooing bugs away at\nwoodstock when they were perfectly like\ncontent and having the best time and\nlike in the wilderness basically they\nwere hippies that like\nthey learned to share\nand coexist\nwith the bugs that were there and i was\nlike wow these little tiny organisms are\nflying around me they're maybe just\ntrying to say hello\nthey're just or or they're just living\ntheir lives but like in my head\nthey're trying to say hi and that makes\nit more\nappealing and fun for me and so i opened\nmy eyes and i just like let\nthe bugs just kind of fly around me and\nif it was a b\nit's a b if it stings you it stings i\nmean i'm not allergic so\nbut\nyou know for other people may be\ndifferent but it's just about like\nshrinking that\njudgmental voice that's saying\nkeep your eyes closed\ndon't focus on anything you know it's\nabout quieting that voice and really\njust like learning to appreciate okay\nwhy do i want to open my eyes what is it\nthat i can gain from this\nexperience of opening my eyes and\nlooking at this little bug or\nor sometimes i'll open my eyes and i'll\nsee a hummingbird and hummingbirds to me\nsignify\nlike my ancestors and\num and so i i think oh maybe that's\ntheir way of saying hello to me today\nand i wouldn't have seen that had i not\nopened my eyes\nthat was an amazing description\nbecause you you just you just described\nhow\nmeditation is really a conversation not\na command\nit's not a command you're not commanding\nyourself\nto do this or do that it's it's not like\nyou have a drill sergeant in your head\nyou actually want to have a conversation\nand a dialogue to yes understand and\nuncover yourself and i i always think\nabout that that the simplest form of\nmeditation is having a conversation with\nyourself having time\nto meet yourself\nand we always we would never cancel an\nimportant meeting with someone else but\nwe never even schedule one with\nourselves exactly and i always\ni always used to\num\nover analyze things and i always used to\ntell myself that was a negative trait\nthat i had then i'm always overthinking\nthings but then when i started\nmeditating i i started to\nhave those over analyzation\nconversations in my head and then i\nstarted thinking wow\ni could go somewhere with this you know\nlike i could expand\nthese thoughts and and it kind of gave\nthis like\nit turned my brain into like a kitchen\nfor all of\nthe\num\nthe like\nthought dinners and and food for\nthoughts that i wanted to have you know\nand i just started expanding and now the\nway that i think is just completely\ndifferent and that's cool too\nyeah no that the way you've just\nexplained how we\nhave to silence even that you know that\ntrainer voice as you said like a\npersonal trainer in the gym or\nit's so true it's so true because\notherwise you just become subservient to\nthis other voice\nagain your expansive consciousness is\nbeing contained and limited yes by this\nother people yes and you don't get to\nexperience it anymore so i can agree\nwith you more you've you've helped me\nmassively\nrefine that and uh we as monks we would\nalways talk about how\nyou always saw the\nyou always saw the noise in your head\njust like a little monkey running around\nand and that kind of made it playful\nand so it was always the it was always\nthe monkey mind versus the monk mind and\nso the monkey was always playful and you\nnotice it\nand you don't want to trap the monkey or\nhurt it or anything you just are\nentertained by just how silly it can be\nbut you want to help organize it a\nlittle and help it a little bit but you\ndon't you don't need to hurt it and so\nyes\ni i you've really helped me uh i i think\nmy meditation's going to be different\ntomorrow based on what you just said so\nwow that's the best compliment i mean it\ni really mean it i really do i think\nyeah i i think you're so right i think\nyou're so right we get we get lost\nalways in these\nwe are always lost in just judging\nourselves just somehow we get\neven even when we know we judge\nourselves we now judge ourselves for\njudging ourselves\nit's like we find\nhave you ever experienced that oh my god\nevery day\nnot not every day but you know it it is\nsomething where\ni do have to catch myself sometimes\ndaily where i look sometimes i look in\nthe mirror and i and i find something\nimmediately wrong with what i see\nand\ni have to stop and say okay why did you\nwhy did you go there with it why can't\nyou look at how beautiful\nyour\nhair is today or\nwhatever or why don't you\nthink about a quality\nabout yourself that has nothing to do\nwith your appearance\nand then like\ntell yourself how proud you are for\ngaining that quality\nand it's like\nit's just always kind of reminding\nourselves\nevery day and that way it gets easier\nover time so that i'm not looking and\nsometimes it's harder than others\nsometimes sometimes it's just easier to\ngo in that shame spiral you know the\nshame spiral where\nyou get onto yourself for one thing and\nthen all of a sudden that oh well\nbecause\ni don't like my hair that means\nthat my body is wrong\nor because i'm\nnot liking my body you know now i i feel\nunlovable and and it just goes into that\nthat spiral and\nthe quicker you can stop that spiral\nfrom\nbottoming out\nthe quicker that you get with\nthat moment every day where it's like\nnow i look in the mirror and if i see\nsomething i don't like i'm it's like a\nreflex i just go okay what do we like\nyou know\nand so um you just gotta\nyou gotta start to\nin a loving and compassionate way train\nyour mind\nto remind yourself what you do love\nabout yourself\nso powerful i really hope everyone\ntomorrow morning is going to practice\nwhat demi just said when you look in the\nmirror tomorrow morning i want you to\nremember\nwhat demi just said because\nit's such a\nincredible trait that we all have where\nwe draw these huge conclusions\nbased on one tiny thing\nso like you said we draw this conclusion\ni am unlovable\nbased on\none thing we don't like about ourselves\nor it could be as simple as your hair it\ncan be as tiny yeah it can be as tiny as\na\na spot on your face right and and you\nturn that spot into\ni am never\ngoing to feel attractive and you just\namplify it to these great degrees and we\nall do it\nand and i love what you said that that's\nhow to approach it that when we look in\nthe mirror you have to you have to nip\nit in the butt you have to catch it\nthere and\nthen and there because otherwise it just\ngets i was thinking about i was talking\nto someone about this the other day\nthere was a small crack in one of the\nfloors\nin in our home\nand i was saying i want to get it fixed\ntoday and someone was saying to me they\nsaid no no it doesn't matter like it's\nit's going to be like years before\nthat's an issue and i was like that's my\npoint i was like i don't want the crack\nto get an opportunity to get bigger and\nbigger and bigger i would rather mend it\ntoday\nand i don't think that just applies to\nflaws i think it applies to our lives\nand how we feel about ourselves and how\nwe talk to ourselves it applies to\nrelationships you may think you just had\na tiny argument but if you can solve it\nnow you save yourself years of headaches\nso i love that you gave everyone a\npractical tool to to actually do that or\nanother one is\nif you might you might think that what\nyou have to say is not super important\nbut honor that voice inside of you so\nthat when you are in a relationship\nyou're immediately starting out with\nthis is who i am these are my values and\nthis is how i want to be respected\nand\nthat way you like you said you nip it in\nthe bud sometimes it's it's not about\nsometimes it's just about speaking up\ntoo\nyes yes you're right and and that all\ncomes back to what you were saying\nearlier the confidence of your intuition\nif you if you keep ignoring it and you\nsay oh well that's that's not important\nright now well that's not relevant or\nthat's insignificant if you keep talking\nto yourself in that way\nthat voice just gets\nquieter and quieter and quieter and now\nwhen you really need it\nyou can't hear it anymore yes exactly so\ni i think that's a beautiful full circle\ngo back to what you were saying earlier\ndemi i you know we we've talked a lot\nabout and i love that we're talking a\nlot about expanding consciousness\nbecause\ni i think that that's not just a noble\naspiration i do believe it's it's a root\nthing it's like going to the heart of\nthe issue as you said that\nif we don't expand our consciousness and\nas a whole as as a world\nit's\nwe can try and solve this one area this\none area but but we're going to keep\nkind of bashing heads to some degree\ni i wonder what are some of the ways you\nthink that people can expand their own\nconsciousness if they're listening and\nsaying\ni i want to know how to do that i'm open\nto that\nwhere would they start what are some of\nthe things what are some of the books i\nknow that you've been interviewing some\nphenomenal people on your podcast 4d\nwhich you're encouraging people to live\nthrough this fourth dimension i wonder\nhave you had any conversations or people\nthat you'd love to introduce people to i\ninterviewed someone recently on my\npodcast named justin baldoni and\num\nthat conversation with them really\nopened my mind because\nuh\njust what they had to say in relation to\num gender norms that are placed on us\nat a young age how we evolve as\nuh adults and\nhow we tend to carry those things from\nour childhood into our adult lives today\ni thought that was so interesting and\nyou know he has a book called man enough\num a lot of the people that i'm having\nconversations with you know you have a\ngreat book\nand um i think reading is something that\nhas helped expand my consciousness a lot\ntoo\num and it doesn't even have to be about\nanything\num\nall that intense it can just be just\nreading is good for your mind um\njournaling is something that's really\nhelped me because\nsometimes my thoughts race so fast that\num\nthat it's hard to\ni don't know it's good to just get it\nout and then i can go back to it and\nlook at it later\num\nso yeah reading journaling and and like\ni said meditating meditating is really\nimportant but find out what meditation\nworks for you\nbecause it is different for everybody\nyeah those are great great insights\nreading\njournaling of course meditation as you\nsaid before and we talked about it at\nlength\nuh i i can agree with you more i\nremember\ni was just speaking to a friend i was i\nwas reorganizing my bookshelf\nand he was saying how much have you been\nreading recently and i said i remember a\nyear in my life where i read a book a\nday for a year and and it just you know\nit was it was an incredible year\nand i was just saying to him how much i\nmiss it that was around i think that was\naround four or five years ago i did that\nand i've been i've been reading i've\nbeen trying to read about book a month\nat the moment but i've been really\ntrying to find things that i'm\nfascinated by and it's not about i'm not\ntrying to make it about a numbers game\ni'm not saying that so anyone who's\nlistening or watching this isn't a\ncompetition of how many books you read\nand that's not what i'm emphasizing what\ni'm emphasizing is what demi's saying is\njust to really expand your consciousness\nyou need to let your consciousness\nconnect dots\nin lots of different areas\nand so when i read i don't just try and\nread from one genre i try and read from\nlots of different genres and lots of\ndifferent authors and backgrounds\nbecause then my consciousness has the\nability to connect dots that it finds\ninteresting\nand yes i demi i remember when we last\nwere together you were talking about\nyour fascination with ufos and you were\ntalking about your fascination with uh\nextraterrestrials and and that's become\na real thing for you now i think when we\nmet yeah it was something that you were\nbecoming passionate about or intrigued\nby\nand i wanted to know how you started to\nget fascinated with that because again\nthat would be considered something\nthat's very different from talking about\ngender or talking about music or talking\nabout mental health or talking about\ndepression and all of a sudden we're\ntalking about ufos and i i love that\nbecause\nthat's what's fascinating about\nexpanding our consciousness so tell me\nabout tell us about how that world\nopened itself up to you\ni watched a movie called close\nencounters of the fifth kind\n[Music]\nso i started\ntr in in this documentary they talk\nabout this protocol where you can\n[Music]\nwhere you meditate and then you play\nthese sounds and then\nyou look up you do like a sky watch and\ni tried it a few times nothing really\nhappened and then one night for my\nbirthday\ni\nwas in palm springs and i had five\nfriends with me\nand i said\nall right i want to try to make contact\nand\nmaking contact isn't like\nyou know touching fingers with it with\nan e.t it's just like you you set an\nintention and then something appears\nand so\num if god willing you know and and\nso\ni'm sitting there and we had meditated\nfor like i told my friends i said hey\nit's my birthday i know this isn't like\nsuper fun but i want to meditate and\nthen i want to go outside and look up\nthey're like yeah down whatever so we\nall start\nmeditating\nand then we look up and i see something\nand this guy that i can't explain that\nwas\nway high above me um all of us it was\nbrighter than any star in the sky and it\nmoved in a way that\nthat a plane wouldn't move i mean it\nmade like a question mark\nin the sky and then it just kind of\nbacked out and i was like did everyone\nsee that\nmy friends were like yeah\nand\nwe were just like oh my gosh so it's\nreal so so it's real this this works and\nit's real and my mind was just blown and\ni realized that from going inward we can\nconnect to beings that are so far beyond\nwhat we know of our universe\num\nand i think there's no q there's no\ncoincidence whenever\ni have been\nmeditating in my backyard and i look up\ni get that urge and my intuition to open\nmy eyes and so i do and i see something\ni've seen like i've seen a\nthis sounds\nout there but i've seen\na flying saucer in the daylight\njust right above\nlike my neighbor's house not right above\nit but\nand and my best friend was meditating\nwith me too\nwe both kind of\nhad opened our eyes at the same time and\nshe was like did you just and i was like\nyeah did you and\nso it's just things like that that just\nstart to happen and there you can't\nexplain it but i think there's a tie i\nthink that these beings\nfrom other planets their\nsolar system i don't know these beings\nwant us to expand our consciousness\nand i think that they're rooting for us\nand i think that\nevery time we start to meditate we start\nto go deep within they can sense it and\num and hopefully you know the rest of\nhumanity catches on to that and we can\nsave our species\ni love it i love it i i remember i no i\nremember reading studies on\num\nastronomy extraterrestrials other\nplanets when when i was fascinated by\nthis a bit earlier and\nand i remember reading a study by\ni obviously was born and raised in\nlondon so this was by her majesty's\nastronomer and it was the astronomy team\nin in england\nand they'd found\nthat\nhe was just saying that he didn't know\nbut he was saying\nit would be ridiculous for me\nto not believe that there was life on\nother planets in other solar systems and\nand that was just categorically stated\nalthough whereas at school this wasn't\nreally encouraged we didn't really get\nbrought into recognizing\nthat there were other life forms you\nknow you kind of believe that there are\nlots of planets but we're the only\nplanet with human life and therefore we\nwe kind of think of life as a very\nlimited way as your ex consciousness\nexpands your your vision expands your\nimagination your experiences\nwhat it\nyou know what has\nreally resonated with you when it comes\nto\nexperiencing life\nor or experiencing joy\nwhat today would you say brings you the\nmost joy\nor brings you the most a light or peace\nin your life today what brings me the\nmost joy is spending time with\npeople that help me co-regulate so my\nfriends\num\nyou know i my family\ni think that\nbeing in nature whether it's going out\nto the desert or\ngoing to colorado in the mountains or\nyou know whatever it is just getting\naway with my friends and just\nreally having time to\nrecharge\nyou know meditate whatever it is that we\nwant to do and\nwith my pups my my dogs and and that's\nwhat really makes me\njoyful find happiness\nand recharge yeah that's beautiful demi\ni have to ask you where in colorado did\nyou go do you do because i just went to\ncreston\noh okay i just went to dunton\nand it was stunning so when you said\nthat i was literally there 10 days ago i\nwas literally there about 10 days ago\ntoo i\nwent to creststone colorado for like a\nfor a\nufo seminar i love that i love that\ni was there i was there for a wedding\nso slightly different i was there for a\nwedding but it was it was beautiful i\ndid not realize that that was a ufo hot\nspot creststone is yeah creststone is um\nyou should actually check it out look\ninto it because\nthere's a bunch of religions that\nfind crestone a sacred spot wow and\nthey even called it the bloodless\nvalley because\nit was so there was like no bloodshed\nback when uh\nyou know\nuh pilgrims came in and\nkind of took over\nso\nyeah or at least that's what my\nunderstanding of it was wow incredible\nit sounds amazing well demi you've been\nso gracious and kind and generous with\nyour time uh we end every on-purpose\nepisode with a final five this is a fast\nfive round so every question has to be\nanswered in one word or one sentence at\na maximum and so demi lovato these are\nyour\nfast five the first question is what is\nthe best advice that you've ever\nreceived the golden rule that you learn\nas a kid\nwhich is treat others the way you want\nto be treated yeah i think that's so\nimportant you and russ had the same\nanswer to that question just so you know\njust throwing it out there which is\ngreat which is great because it's such a\nit's such an important rule it's it's\nbecause you know you both agree okay\nsecond question what is the worst advice\nyou've ever received\nyou should wear spanx with that\nthat was probably the worst advice i've\never received and that scarred me for\nyears oh gosh tell us about tell us\nabout how\nsimple things from authoritative\nopinionated people in our life can\naffect\nus in that way i i want to expand on\nthat i think that's such a\ninteresting thing that often when\nwe say things to people we don't know\nhow much power they hold\nand if they end up living through with\nthat it can have ramifications maybe\njust speak to that a little bit yes\nwell\nthat experience i had had just shortly\nafter i had come out of treatment for an\neating disorder\nand i thought that my\nstylist\nknew better at the time this was\nover 10 years ago it wasn't even the\nstylist it was the stylist assistant and\nthey just said it like\noh would you like spanx you should wear\nspanx with that and\nit could have been because the dress was\nsilk and it was thin\nand\nor\nmaybe it just wasn't flattering but\nin my head i took that as\nyou look bad you need to wear\na body sculpting\nthing underneath\nand i took that and i internalized it so\nmuch that i kind of spiraled um it was i\nwas supposed to do a performance and\nlike\ndancing with the stars or something and\num\nand i was so thrown off by that one\ncomment\num\nthat i just got so sad and so in my head\nand i start and i thought about it for\nyears\num\nwe don't realize the weight that our\nwords hold when we speak to other people\nbecause we don't know all of their\ntriggers we don't know all of their life\nexperiences\nwe have to be careful when using\nwords with others that could potentially\ntrigger people because you don't know\nwhat they've been through\nwell said thank you so much for\nexpanding on that\nuh okay question number three\nis\nwhat is the first thing you do when you\nwake up and what's the last thing you do\nbefore you go to bed the last thing that\ni do is\ni\nput on my sleep meditation music because\ni sleep too yes i sleep to meditation\nmusic so that\nthe second that i wake up that's the\nfirst thing i that i hear and it's the\nlast thing i hear when i fall asleep\nbeautiful wonderful okay uh question\nnumber four what's the biggest lesson\nyou've learned in the last 12 months in\nthe last 12 months oh jesus um\ni\ni\nthere's so many lessons thank you\ntell us a few um\ndon't get engaged after knowing someone\nfor three months\num\nyeah that's a that's a big one um\nmaybe\nalso\nbe super sure of who you are as a person\nbefore you take a leap like that\num\nyou know you can't\nyou can't love anyone else until you\nreally learn to love yourself\nand i had to\nkind of learn that the hard way every\ntime i think i love myself\ni learned that i could love myself a\nlittle bit more\nand that was what happened to me last\nyear was i realized\nyou know what there's a lot of room that\ni could\nuse\nto expand my love for myself\nand so i started working on that and\ni've been single ever since but i'm\nit's been some of the most important\nmonths of my life trying to figure out\nwho i am today and who i want to be in a\nrelationship going forward that's\nincredible and i love the idea of\nlearning to love ourselves because i\nthink often we try to jump\nto just love ourselves\nand it's about learning to love it's\nit's the learning process that\nis what we're all trying to skip and\nmiss and leapfrog and hopefully just end\nup at love and it's not it's the\nlearning part and you're so right that\nwe can all\nlearn to love ourselves a little deeper\nuh fifth and final question is if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow\nwhat would it be\nwell my it would be\nit would be that you have to try to\nmeditate okay\nthat's great because\nbecause i know not everyone is going to\nbe able to but at least if you just if\nyou try just one minute a day\nif you try that would be my law because\ni think that would really shift things\nthat's awesome\neveryone\nthank demi thank you so much for taking\nthe time your energy your laugh your\nlittle hey voice in the head that we'll\nnever forget\ni i am so i am so grateful that we got\nto spend this time together that\nyou shared so much about meditation\nabout expanding our consciousness i know\nthis is going to impact so many people\nand i encourage you all to tag demi and\ni in your post to tell us what you\nlearned i would love to know what you\nlearned from them and what you took away\nfrom them and so please please please\nmake sure you let us know and thank you\nfor listening to on purpose a big thanks\nto you and you and your team and uh\nwe'll see you again next week demi thank\nyou so so so much\nthank you\nif you want even more videos just like\nthis one make sure you
