    "transcript": "if you looked at it from the outside in\nyou know people would say well dropping\non to college that was a pretty big risk\ntaking the company private that was a\npretty big risk doing the largest tech\nacquisition ever with 50 or 60 billion\ndollars in debt you know that was a that\nwas a pretty big risk but you know to me\nthey actually didn't see that risk\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now today's guest\nis someone that i was really excited to\nhave today on the show because i think\nthere's so many moments in his life\nwhere he's gone through experiences that\nwe can all learn from i'm talking about\nnone other than michael dell the\nchairman and chief executive officer of\ndell technologies an innovator and\ntechnology leader providing the\nessential infrastructure for\norganizations to build their digital\nfuture now he's the author of two books\nincluding the next upcoming book the one\nthat i really want you to read is play\nnice\nbut win a ceo's journey from founder to\nleader i love the title i've already\nloved chapters of the book that i've\nread and i cannot wait for you to read\nit michael is an honorary member of the\nfoundation board of the world economic\nforum and is an executive committee\nmember of the international business\ncouncil i welcome to the show michael\ndell michael thank you for taking the\ntime to do this i cannot wait for people\nto read your book and i'm so lucky that\ni get to sit down with you as the author\nof the book uh before everyone gets to\nso thank you so much for your energy\nyeah thank you jay great to be with you\nand great to be with you with your\naudience yeah i like i said i love the\ntitle i want to dive into the book a bit\nlater but i want to start off with\nasking you a question that i've been\nasking a lot of people recently because\ni i think there's something beautiful\nabout learning about this i'll share\nwith you a story i was\ni work with a lot of corporate clients\nas a speaker or a coach\nand i was speaking with one of my\nclients recently\nand of course we're on zoom and he's got\nhis something in his background and i'm\nwondering what it is\nand he has a paintbrush hanging on his\nback background wall\nand and it's a real paint brush and it's\na big paint brush you can't miss it and\ni said to him i said look i don't want\nto be creepy but i'm just being curious\nwhy do you have a paintbrush on your\nwall and he said he started laughing he\nsaid no one's ever asked me that before\nand i was thinking wow like people must\nreally be scared of you\nbut he said that\nhe said that the reason he has it is\nbecause his first ever job was that he\nused to paint fences and then when he\ndid that successfully he painted walls\nand then when he did that successfully\nhe got to paint homes and he keeps that\npaintbrush up there to remind him of\nwhere he started today he's a very\nsuccessful executive i wanted to ask you\nwhat was your first ever ever job that\nyou did and is there a lesson that you\nlearned there that you've carried with\nyou throughout your success\nyeah you know i i i\nfirst of all a big believer in those\nearly jobs you know my first job i was\n12 years old\ni was a dishwasher in a chinese\nrestaurant i got promoted to\nwaterboy\nand then\nassistant mater d\nuh so i was moving up pretty fast\nand i got recruited away by another\nrestaurant and i've been working every\nday since then pretty much and and i\nhave to say i've i've loved it\nthat's incredible do you do you mind me\nasking how much did you used to make at\nthe time as a 12 year old i guess it was\nlike this would have been in uh\n1977 so\nwhat what was the minimum wage back then\nlike a dollar or two dollars or you know\nsomething like that it wasn't very much\nyeah what would you save it up for like\nwhat were you doing with that money at\nthat time what was it leading towards\nyeah so in the at the time i was into\nstamps\nand um i started\num\nyou know i was collecting stamps and i\nstarted like buying and selling stamps i\nran a stamp auction\ni got into\nuh stocks and\nuh you know currencies when i was like\n14 15 started investing\nmy mom was a stock broker really got\ninterested in financial markets you know\naround 14 15 it was sort of the the dawn\nof the microprocessor age and i i\nhappened to\nyou know get exposed to the origins of\nwhat what became the pc and you know\nthat that obviously uh you know impacted\nmy life in a big way\nso today if if you were 12 year old\ntoday you'd be doing nfts and crypto and\nthat would be your world i'm guessing\nseeing is probably from yeah yeah you\nknow now there's so many interesting\nthings going on\num\nwith\nyou know technology and\nyou know the intersection of of the the\nbiological sciences and the\ncomputational sciences and\nyou know it used to be technology was\nabout\nuh\ni.t departments and stuff like that now\nit's pretty much\naffecting everything and every business\nis getting upended in some way\nby technology and ai and\ndata and\nyou know\nnetworks and it's it's super exciting to\nsee the pace that the economy is\nchanging with technology with technology\nat the fulcrum of that absolutely and i\nknow that you dropped out of college\nand a lot of successful founders\nhave dropped out of college and i'm not\nat all uh recommending that or\nencouraging that and neither are you i'm\nintrigued to think about though if you\nfinished your degree\nhow differently do you think your life\nwould have gone that's the first part of\nthe question and the second part of the\nquestion is what gave you the courage\nto actually drop out and pursue\nsomething which at the time as you said\nwas very new and and very uh cutting\nedge and innovative but people didn't\nreally have a lot of certainty and\nsurety around it yeah you know it it\nseemed like kind of an easy decision for\nfor me i mean let me start with the\nfirst part you know what would have\nhappened if i'd graduated\ni don't know i don't know that i that i\nwould have uh\ngone down this path you know i might i\nmight be like a\nyou know a doctor in houston somewhere\nyou know which is what my parents wanted\nme to be\num\nbut\nyou know when i when i started first of\nall if you have nothing you have nothing\nto lose right so so it's pretty easy\ndecision you know the university of\ntexas here in austin you can take a\nsemester off and come back with no\nacademic penalty so that was kind of the\ndeal i made with my parents that i would\ngo do this for a while and if it worked\nout i would keep doing it and if it\ndidn't i'd go back to school so you know\nit didn't seem like an enormous risk\nuh to me my parents were were pretty\nupset with me for sure because you know\nin the world they came from\ngiving up an opportunity for an\neducation\nwas like the worst thing you could\npossibly do\num but you know it all it all worked out\ni love that i i want to hear more about\nthat interaction with your parents\nmichael because i feel there are so many\nchildren today and young people and\nyoung adults that go through the same\nexperience as you did they either want\nto quit or they want to start something\nnew\nor they're on the verge of an idea they\nhave but they don't have the confidence\ntheir parents might not be into it\nwhat does someone look to at that time\nat that early stage in their career\nwhere they don't have\nthe\nwins on their list yet they they don't\nhave the successes but they they want to\nfollow their dreams follow their passion\nfollow their heart what advice do you\nhave for someone who's in that position\nright now well it's it's difficult and\nextremely uh emotional and i i talk\nabout this in the book and the kind of\nstruggle that i had with that and with\nmy parents you know ultimately\ni\njust decided that i was going to do this\nwhether or not i had their approval\nyou know which which was which was a\nreally\ntough thing to do and and um\nyou know my my mother was was\nunbelievably upset with me\num and i would say it took\nit took about a year or two maybe three\nyou know\nto sort of fully\nfully uh get through that i don't know\nthat there is universal advice here\nother than if you are in a situation\nwhere\nyou can take the risk and you don't have\na lot to lose and and you can fall back\non something else\num\nyou know look i i think a lot of people\ndon't achieve\nuh you know uh even a small fraction of\nwhat they're capable of because they're\nafraid to fail they're not willing to\ntake on more risk and\num\nyou know there's a lot of\nthere's a lot of potential that's left\non the field and never gets utilized uh\nbecause people want the perfect plan or\nthey want to do what they're supposed to\ndo or\nuh you know they're they're just not\nwilling to take on that risk and and um\nyou know we we need we need uh people to\nto\nyou know take on risk not just\nfor new companies but\nyou know for existing companies and for\nto to\nredo and rethink and reimagine\nour our world you know we can't just\nlike do a little bit better version of\nwhat we had before we have to constantly\nbe reimagining things well you spoke a\nlot about risk there michael i'm\nwondering what do you think's the\nbiggest risk you ever took you said that\ndecision was fairly easy\nwhat do you think what was the time when\nyou feel you're like yeah it took a big\nrisk and whether it paid off or not i'd\nlove to hear about how it panned out but\nwhat was the biggest risk you ever took\nif you looked at it from the outside in\nyou know people would say well dropping\nout of college that was a pretty big\nrisk\ntaking the company private that was a\npretty big risk you know doing the\nlargest\ntech\nacquisition ever with\nyou know 50 or 60 billion dollars of\ndebt you know that was a that was a\npretty big risk\num\nbut you know to me\nthey actually didn't seem that risky\nright because because i i\nyou know as sort of on a risk-adjusted\nbasis\ni could see my way through to the\nto the opportunity and could it have all\ngone wrong sure but i didn't think it\nwas going to it's also a situation where\nyou know if i had sat there and said gee\nshould i drop out of school should i not\ndrop out of school let's go talk to 10\nor 100 people and ask them what they\nthink\nprobably most of them would have told me\nyou're crazy for dropping out of school\nokay well i didn't ask anybody\nyou know\nuh\nthat wasn't that wasn't how i was\nthinking about it yeah what would you\nsay would be your biggest failure till\ndate that you feel like you were down\nand out where it was a really tough\nsituation was there a moment where\nthings really felt like they weren't\nworking out when would when would that\nhave been well look there have been\nplenty of times and you know i think\nwhat people maybe fail to understand is\nthat\nembedded in success\nare failures right and at the root of\nsuccess you have kind of curiosity\nlearning experimenting and failure\nand without those things you don't have\nany success right and so\nuh you know\nfailures are are not necessarily bad you\nknow especially if you're learning from\nthem and so yeah we've had all kinds of\nfailures along the way um\nyou know\na a along the way to\nuh you know cumulative revenues of about\n1.4 trillion dollars right um\nbut\nyeah i mean you know early on we had\nsome super ambitious technical projects\nthat failed\num and we learned from that we built a\nlot of capability that allowed us to\ncreate all kinds of new new products as\na result\nwe had inventory planning challenges\nearly on that led us to be\nreally world-class at supply chain\nmanagement because we had to\nright and uh\nyou know necessity is the mother\ninvention and\num\nthe key is\nto\nlearn from the failures and correct them\nquickly\nand hopefully not make the same mistakes\nover and over again and you know if you\ncan if you can\nlearn from other people's mistakes you\nknow learn from from your new mistakes\nthat you're making and\nyou know correct them quickly\nyou're going to be very successful but\nyou've got to you've you gotta be\nwilling to experiment and fail the other\nthing is you know when you're when\nyou're going into\nnew areas\nthere's no playbook right there's you\ncan't like read a book or\nor talk to a you know an expert like\ntell you how to do this you just have to\nstart i love that thank you michael no i\ni i love hearing that it's always\nit's always wonderful to hear someone\nwho seems to be having fun and and\ngrowing continuously and\nenjoying life on the journey as well and\ni want to come to your book now you know\nplay nice but win\na ceo's journey from founder to leader\ni i wanted to talk about the title for a\nbit\nwhen you hear the words play play nice\nbut when were these words that you\nsaid a lot were these words that you\nheard a lot how did these words take\nshape in your life\nyeah so um my my two brothers and i uh\nyou know when we were little kids\nand we would go out in the street and\nplay ball with our friends that's what\nour parents told us\nyou know\nalmost every time they say played high\nschool win\nand so it kind of became this philosophy\nof of uh you know let's not forget about\nthe winning part right but but we're\ngonna we're gonna play nice we're gonna\nplay fair we're gonna do it you know\nkind of ethically responsibly\nbut\nyeah\nwe're we're in it to win right\nand uh\nand so\nyou know that's it's kind of been a\nkind of been something that's just stuck\nwith me ever since i was a little kid\nand and uh\nyeah that's it it goes goes back to my\nchildhood and i talk about that in the\nbook as well did you ever meet anyone\nalong the way that tried to challenge\nthat\nand tell you it wasn't possible or tell\nyou you had to\nplay ruthless you had to play bad\nand when like was there anyone who\nchallenged that and not specifically i\ndon't need you to tell me exactly who\ni'm just saying was there anyone who\nreally debated\nand challenged that hypothesis and said\nmichael this is not gonna work you're\ngonna have to play unfair and\nwas there anyone in your life that you\nmet that completely disagreed with that\nstatement\nwell look i you know\nbeen i've been\nyou know running our company for 37\nyears i mean i believe\nmarkets are are long-term efficient\nright\nand uh\nyou know i think everything sort of come\nback comes back to you\nin a in a good way you know or a bad way\nif you if you're playing the the other\nyou know side\nuh or or the other way\nand um\nyou know i i've just i've just kind of\navoided um\nyou know uh the the the opposite path\nand\nit's worked for me\num and you know it just feels right to\nme and and at the end of the day uh you\nknow\nyou have to feel\nyou know uh write about what you're\ndoing and\nuh\nyou know\nyou know when i'm\n90 or 100 or hopefully older\nyou know uh\nyou know i want to i want to be proud of\neverything i did and the way i did it\nand and uh\nyou know that's that's just really\nimportant to me so and and look i've\ni've run into plenty of people that that\nuh\nyou know didn't didn't play nice and i\njust tried to you know certainly uh not\nhave them in our company you know\navoid avoid doing doing business with\nthem to the extent i could\nand um\nyeah\nit's that's that's what that's what's\nthat's what's worked for me\nyeah was there ever a time though that\nyou felt pressured that you might have\nto change your approach to win or or was\nit always easy to state that i just i've\ni've i feel like i love it by the way i\ncompletely agree with you like i think\nmy favorite way to win is to play nice\nand the best way to play nice is to make\nsure you win so i i love that approach\nto life i'm just wondering whether there\nwere any times where you actually maybe\njust had a thought and you thought well\nmaybe if i didn't play so nice maybe i'd\nwin more maybe i'd maybe i would be more\nsuccessful if i\ndid this or did this thing did you ever\nhave that debate did you ever have that\nthought internally or were you always\nconvinced that this was\nnot not for a second i mean it wouldn't\nfeel right to win\nif i had cheated or done done it in an\nunscrupulous way\nyou know and i talk about in the book\nsome of the early\nformative experiences where\nwe had people that did things that\nweren't exactly correct right in one way\nor another and it really surprised me\nmaybe i was naive or i think people love\nthe clarity of of knowing what we stand\nfor right and knowing that that you know\nwe don't like\nchange the rules depending on who it is\nor how important it is or\nanything like that it's like hey we're\nwe're very clear about the ethical\nstandards that we uphold as a company\nand\nyou know um\nit's it's just a lot easier that way i\nlove hearing that trust me i'm so happy\nto hear that because i think value-based\nbusinesses are so needed in in the world\nright now and when we look at things\nlike conscious capitalism and the idea\nof creating wealth creating impact\nthrough values and through purpose and\nthrough mission uh it's beautiful to\nhear that you never even got you know\nyou never even had a moment of doubt i i\nlove hearing that because i think it\nshows what's possible i i wonder there's\na lot of our listeners who\nmay be trying to decide between\nentrepreneur or employee\nand\nyou know today because the\nentrepreneurial life mindset has become\nso\nmainstream culture and accessible a lot\nmore people are thinking in that\ndirection i wonder what can you do to\nteach us about the difference between\nthe entrepreneur mindset and the\nemployee mindset and what differences\npeople can see so that they can see\nwhere they're best placed\nwhen things get pretty heated you i\nthink you see more uh opportuners\nyou know\nand not necessarily the pure\nentrepreneurs\nand you know that's okay\neverybody everybody can choose their own\npath\num\nyou know in in my experience\nit's\nit's not for the faint of heart right to\ngo start a business i mean it is\nall in and you know when when i started\nfortunately i was\n19 years old and i could work\n18 hours a day and sleep with the office\nand had no responsibilities you know\nin terms of family or any anything like\nthat\num and\nand uh had the kind of physical stamina\nto to work like a maniac you know uh for\nfor several years which\nthat's sort of what it\ntook at the beginning\num fortunately that didn't have to\nperpetuate\nbut um\nyeah i mean it's not all glamorous um\nand and\nand uh and and success and and there are\nplenty of\nbusinesses that that that that don't\nwork out and\nyeah i mean it's easy to look at the\nsuccessful businesses and say wow it was\njust straight up you know and to the\nright forever it's like\nnot exact that's not exactly the way it\ngoes\nreally in in any in any business\num\nbut but uh\nyeah i mean it's it's a very personal\ndecision in terms of what someone's risk\nappetite is\nand you know are they willing to take\nall that on and\nand uh you know when you put your head\ndown at night you know you're thinking\nabout all those people that\nyou're responsible for i loved how in\nchapter three you said uh you're\nyou know you don't start a company if\nyou're not an optimist\nuh you know there has to be the optimism\nand and part of your optimism was the\nopenness to compete with ibm and to you\nknow to challenge\na long-established company even when you\nwere young uh where where did that\nwhere did that confidence come from\nwhere did that\nambition that that desire come from uh\nthat gave you so much confidence and\nstrength in that sort of a mindset i\nguess if i was being objective looking\nat it you know uh now\ni'd say there was some naivete there for\nsure as well\nbut\nyou know um\nall that mixture\nwas was pretty powerful and you know\nwhat what i saw when i\nlooked at the ibm pc\nback in 1981 when it first came out it\njust had the 40th anniversary you know a\ncouple a month or two ago of the ibm pc\nuh was\nyou know it it it was this thing they\nsold for like three thousand dollars but\nit had 500 worth of parts in it\nand none of the parts were made by ibm\nso\nto my\nyou know uh teenage mind\nit kind of seemed like a criminal\nenterprise you know it was like i was\nlike\nuh why does it cost so much\nand why does it take so long and why\ncan't it be faster and you know had a\nton of ideas and\nyou know\nit's hard for people to really\nunderstand right now but back in the\nearly 1980s\nibm was\nnot just the most successful you know\ncomputer company\nthey were like\nunbelievably dominant\nin this field unlike any other company\nexcept maybe like standard oil you know\nback in the day\nuh\nyou know they they just dwarfed any\nother company in the ite\nslash data processing field you know now\nobviously very different 30 40 years\nlater but\num at the time they were\nyou know\nthe the the giant\nuh and they were also like the most\nvaluable company in america right so so\nit was it was it was uh\nit was it was a big\nbig uh a big business but hey they seem\nvulnerable to me\ni i love that example of what you said\nlike\nlooking at it and seeing a criminal\nenterprise because of the uh\nyou know because of the shocking\ndifference between the parts and the and\nthe pieces and you're right i mean i i\ngrew up in a world where\nibm was\nwas still very powerful but i know what\nyou mean you're talking about the scale\nof\nit at the time\nand you know when you talk about\nyou talk about in chapter seven the\nfight for dell to go private\nand it's been like a long disruptive\nprocess for everyone that's involved and\nyou mentioned in the book that in dell\nyou had this saying a failure is not an\noption uh you know\ni want to know what kept you going in\nthat fight to make it private like what\nwas the thing that kept you consistently\nuh fighting because sometimes we're\nfighting for fighting's sake but in this\nsituation that wasn't it you were\nfighting for something more important\nand more deep where did that come from\nyeah you know i really felt that going\nprivate would allow us to accelerate our\ntransformation\nand it would allow us to kind of\nreignite the entrepreneurial risk-taking\nspirit that was the origin of the\ncompany\nand um\nyou know i think winston churchill said\nsomething to the effect of you know if\nyou're going through hell you know keep\ngoing right so we were in the middle of\nit it's not like you it's it's it's not\neasy to like stop and say uh we're just\nkidding never mind forget it you know\ni guess we could have done that but\num\nyou know\nonce you once you get started\nyou know it was a fight it was a fight\nworth worth winning i thought i thought\nwe could win\num\nand\num you know i thought it was i truly\nbelieved it that it was very important\nthing for the company to do at that time\nto\num you know inflect the the\ntransformation and\nyou know we can look look back\nuh seven years later and say\nyeah good good thing we did that\neveryone else can make the connections\nin hindsight but you were able to make\nthe connections\nuh in the process and i think that's\nalways what's harder but another area of\nyour life apart from your professional\nsuccess of course but you're one of the\nfew people who've had this rare\npersonal success too with marrying your\nwife your four children\nand and i wanted to understand you\nprobably get asked the work-life balance\nquestion a million times i personally\ndon't believe in balance i think it's a\nmyth i'm not convinced that it's real\nand\ni think that it actually causes more\npressure than creates fuel in our lives\nwhen we're constantly trying to balance\ni wanted to understand what was your\njourney in\ncreating a successful professional life\nan extremely successful professional\nlife but also managing to have a real\ngenuine personal life as well\nyeah so\nfirst of all i think when you're\nstarting a business\nuh you know this idea of balance you\nknow just forget about it it's like you\nknow it's like\nyou're you're not gonna have it so you\nknow if you're thinking oh i'm gonna be\nan entrepreneur i'm gonna start a\ncompany and i'm a great work-life\nbalance and it's not gonna happen right\nif it is i it's it's a it's a it's a\nforeign thing to me i don't understand\nhow how you could do that\nbut you know once you have a business\nkind of up and running and you're into\nyear\n10 year 15 year 20 right you've got\nuh you know\nsystems and processes and people and\nwell what you find is there's a\ndiminishing return to the number of\nhours worked\nand also\nyou know your happiness is impacted and\nyou don't have to do everything yourself\nand you sort of\nalways kind of are reassessing what is\nthe point of impact\nwhere i can make a meaningful\nyou know uh\nimpact on the company and\num you know cause something great to\nhappen and\ni'm not gonna i'm not gonna do that in\nmy you know 90th hour or 100th hour of\nwork in a week right you know there's a\nsweet spot there\nand so\num\nyeah i i also consciously\nwanted to have\na family and children and a family life\nand\nthat kind of\nuh grounding that that i had as a child\nand uh you know um that was something i\ni really desired and so i sought it out\nand planned\nplanned my life in that way\num because i also knew that you know if\ni\nuh you know kept working for another 10\nplus years and didn't have that\ni would be unhappy yeah and and but i'm\nsure that there were those tough\ndecisions to make like\ni'm sure there were moments where\nmaybe your wife and your children wanted\nyour time but you had to be at an\nimportant meeting or you had to be on a\nplane or how did you deal with those\nchallenges because they're very natural\nit doesn't you know it doesn't make you\na bad person but it's like you i'm sure\nthere were moments where you felt guilty\nor you couldn't be somewhere with your\nfamily that you really wanted to be with\nhow did you deal with that and get\nthrough that successfully when so many\nother people struggle with those moments\nfirst of all you know\nyou have to have some boundaries\num and and set some boundaries and i'll\nsay i was pretty good about having you\nknow uh boundaries\num\nyou know didn't really do a lot of uh\nwork on\non on the weekend\nuh you know so that that was pretty\nsacred time when did you stop working\nweekends michael where when in the\njourney did that happen or was that from\nthe beginning you never worked weekends\ni'd say i'd say when when when you know\nwhen we started having\nyou know little kids\nlittle kids\num\nand\nyou know uh i also\nyou know kind of set up our our house\nwhere we had a kind of\num place where\npeople could come over for dinner and so\nyou know um i would often have a lot of\ndinner still do you know at the house\nand that way\num\nyou know uh\nit just it just saved time and\nsometimes my my kids would you know it's\nkind of a funny story my son\nuh he he figured out when he was about\nfive or six that you know if he came to\none of the dinners\num\nyou know toward the end he could get a\ndessert\nright\nbut but then after a while he's like\nhey that's bill gates you know it's like\nlet's let you know maybe i'll learn\nsomething you know so he he would like\ncome and sit down and\nparticipate in in the dinners\num\nbut\nuh yeah it it it it it helped a lot to\ndo that at home and\num\nyeah you gotta have some boundaries you\nyou can't be in you know you you can't\nmake it perfect all the time you know\nand they're going to be times when i\nmean when i uh we haven't been doing\nthis lately obviously but you know when\ni would go to europe or asia\non business trips you're just going all\nout you know like like for for a long\ntime\nfrom\nearly morning to late at night\nand\nthat's okay you know you you can sprint\nfor a while and and do that\num\nbut also yeah i made time to\nrelax and and play and exercise and\nthink and\num not be overly scheduled too i think i\nthink the dinners is a genius one i love\nthat that opening up your home and\nhaving those work dinners or people over\nfor dinner so that you're actually at\nhome you're with your family it's it's\nstill part of family time i think that's\nthat's genius and it makes so much sense\nas to why that's beneficial for the\nfamily for work for for so many other\nthings so i love you sharing that tip\nyou can make story time with the kids\nyou know and still have still have a\ndinner with with with your business\ncolleagues you know yeah it's brilliant\nthat that's a brilliant one uh you\nmentioned in the book that you always\nkept mementos in your office like\nsome personal\nuh some about the highs and low points\nof the company can you tell us about\nsome of these mementos because i'm a\ni mean you collected stamps obviously so\ncollecting is part of your your dna i i\nlove collecting mementos as well i want\nsome inspiration what were some of the\nthings that you hold on to yeah you know\ni i kept kept things that were\nmeaningful\nyou know um in the book i have i have a\npicture of the motherboard that jay bell\nour first engineer hand wired up\nyou know that's obviously a a pretty\ntreasured uh\nmemento for for me about the origins of\nour company and\nand tons of stories there i love how one\nof the values of your company was to be\nknown as a great company and a great\nplace to work at you know the first few\nyears of my entrepreneurial journey and\ntrying to build a team we have a team of\nyou know just shy of 50 people across\nthe world\nthat are working on my certification\nschool my courses my podcasts my\nvideos my my books just the whole the\nwhole area of my work and i love that\nyou said you wanted your company one of\nthe values was to be known as a great\ncompany and a great place to work at i\nwanted to know what were three key\ningredients in ensuring you were doing\nthat as a leader first of all you want\nto have an inspiring\nyou know mission and and you want to\nhave people excited not just engaged but\nyou want them to believe that what they\ndo is really important\nand\nmakes a difference in the world\nand you know they're you're basically\nengendering passion which is way more\npowerful than just about anything else\nyou can present as a motivational tool\ni'd say the second thing is you want\npeople to feel like\nthey can succeed and grow and\nuh fulfill their full potential\ninside the organization and there's\nnothing holding them back\nthere's no limits for them\nand it you know you're\nyou know caring caring about their\nsuccess i think a part of that is\nprobably the third point is is that\nyou've created an environment\nthat is\ninclusive and anybody can succeed you're\nnot looking for people that are all the\nsame you want uh\nyou know to hear\na diverse set of voices and\nuh you know you're you're stronger\nbecause of the\nyou know diverse set of voices and ideas\ncoming together\nand you know we we're all we're all\nfocused on\nultimately something that's bigger than\nourselves\nand\nuh\nyou know again we've got a really\nimportant reason to get up out of bed\nevery morning you know what we do\nmatters in the world\nyeah absolutely i love that thank you so\nmuch\nthat's going to be really really useful\nto me as we continue to grow so
