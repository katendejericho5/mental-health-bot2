    "transcript": "i've literally attained and accomplished\nany everything that a musician could\ndream to attain and so i had to look\nmyself in the mirror and say why and\ni've purposefully slowed down so that i\ncan focus on my mental and physical\nhealth so that i can focus on being\nthere for my child and my wife and that\ni can love and enjoy this life and this\nhouse that i've spent the last 17 years\nof my life\nbuilding and it is terrifying jay\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now this has been\na year where we've been so fortunate to\nsit down with some incredible artists to\nshare their stories and they've opened\nup vulnerably and you've responded as a\ncommunity by sharing those episodes\nloving those conversations and today's\nguest is someone that i've wanted to\nspeak to for a long time i've been fan\nof his music been a fan of his flow been\na fan of his lyrics\nand today we're talking about his brand\nnew book which i'll introduce you to in\na moment but i'm talking about none\nother than bobby hall aka logic a grammy\nnominated platinum selling recording\nartist author actor streamer and film\nproducer in addition to his three number\none albums 10 platinum singles and\nbillions of streams hall's debut book\nsupermarket made him the first hip-hop\nartist to have a number one new york\ntimes best-selling novel and today his\nnew book that we're talking about is\ncalled this bright future by bobby hall\nbobby thank you so much for making the\ntime dude that was the coolest intro\never i feel so cool now thank you\nthat's very kind it was i mean it's a\ngreat intro because it's all true and so\ni feel like if the intro is cool then\nthe life must be really cool uh because\nyou had to live it to make it real for\nsure\nbut uh we were just we were talking\nabout this before the only time we've\never met is when we bumped into each\nother at an airport which i loved\nbecause i saw you i already knew who you\nwere and so when you came up to me i was\nlike this is so cool man logic's\nstopping me at an airport but you can\nfinish the rest of the story\nyeah dude i thought it was really\nawesome and uh and my security guard is\nalso he's just a huge fan of yours his\nname is pepe\nhe's literally freaking out right now\nover here say what's up\nyeah hey pepe what's up yeah oh man he's\nso hype he loves you man who doesn't and\nso yeah i just i just saw it as a really\ncool opportunity to say hello and then\nuse him as a scapegoat to also say hello\nit was really cool no that's awesome man\nand lots of love to pepe but also i i\nwas a huge fan so it was nice to always\njust\nit's always nice to just bump into\nsomeone in a very you know natural way\nthis was obviously pre-pandemic\nwhen we were all flying and moving\naround but i wanted to start off just by\nasking you like what what's this time\nbeen for you has this been a time of\ndeep creativity and exploration has it\nbeen relaxing i know you just became a\nfather as well last year like\nwhat's this time been like for you\npersonally it's kind of been a\ncombination of all those things for sure\nso i had planned to take off um 2020\nanyway just to be there for for my baby\nbecause that's when he was born in\nfebruary and my wife and just really for\nthe first time in my life kind of slow\ndown which i'd never done in my entire\ncareer um\nso i got a little lucky in that sense\nwhere i didn't have some big tour\nplanned and have to cancel it and\nfinancially be dealing with you know\nsituations that i'm glad i didn't run\ninto um so that was nice but also at the\nsame time it's like yeah i'm constantly\nworking i was literally like they were\nlike okay you got four minutes i'm\nupstairs like polishing the script that\ni'm gonna shoot um\nnext year which i'm really excited to to\nwork on and so i'm i'm constantly\nworking\nuh my biggest thing is balance i think\nyou know searching for balance and\ntrying to find balance is\nwell it's impossible right because it\njust is what it is but i think the\nsearch is very important and that's\nwhere i've been\nand i kind of need to relax more but my\nmind is always going crazy but yeah it's\nbeen full of creativity working on music\num books you know just and but my big\nthing is with my family i just love\nspending time with my family because\nobviously i didn't really have one\ngrowing up so yeah that's that's been my\npandemic yeah i definitely want to talk\nabout that and you know for anyone who's\nlistening right now we are going to dive\ninto\nbobby's new book this bright future uh\nbut i i just recently found out that you\ncan solve a rubik's cube while\nfreestyling\nand i was just like that is the craziest\nmultitasking\nopportunity i've ever heard of like i've\nnever thought of two things that are too\ndiff so different tell us about how you\neven discovered that you could do that\nwell i remember it was 2014 and it was\nuh\nthanksgiving\nand i was 24 and i was in my room and i\nwas looking at this rubik's cube and i\nfeel like everybody has had a rubik's\ncube at some point it's just kind of\nlike a fun thing you have either when\nyou're a kid or older and you throw it\non a shelf and so uh i really wanted to\nlearn how to do it so i took to youtube\nand looked up a tutorial on all the\nalgorithms it's i swear to god this is\nrandom\nthat i have one here right now like i\npromise you and i'll probably really\nbutcher it while i'm telling the story\nbut uh yeah basically what i wanted to\ndo was is i want to learn how to do it\nand i'm a freak like anything that i\nwant to get into no matter what it is\nwhether it's acting whether it's music\num i even i mean just even video games\nlike i love mastering things or at least\ntrying to doing my best to\nand\nso i sat down and i literally just\nstudied this algorithm\nand i mean at this point it's like i was\nworking on things until like these\nalgorithms until my freaking fingers\nfelt like they were going to fall off\nwhich was insane and like 10 hours later\nor however long it was i uh i did it and\nthen i learned how to do it without\nactually having to look at the\nalgorithms or how they were done so then\nit had become muscle memory which was\nreally awesome but it was a very uh\nit was intense and uh pretty crazy and\nthen i got into like speed cubing and\ndifferent things like that which is also\nvery nerdy but also very fun\nand\nyeah man so it was basically\nthanksgiving and before i knew it i had\nlearned how\nto solve it and then i just kind of did\nit constantly\nand uh\none day i was like all right i'm gonna\ntake my nerd sci-fi wraps on the radio\nwith big boy's neighborhood and i'm also\ngonna do a rubik's cube while i\nfreestyle and it could have ended badly\nbecause i could have been so nervous\nwhich i was that it didn't work out but\nit did and that was really cool i swear\nthat's just right here next dude just\nhold that up again because that was\nincredible\nthat was amazing\nthanks man that was phenomenal i mean\nlike for anyone who's listening and not\nwatching the podcast\nhe just solved bobby hall logic just\nsolved a rubik's cube while explaining\nhow he freestyles on rubik's cubes at\nthe same time so for anyone who didn't\nget to see that please go over to\nyoutube or instagram and watch that part\nbecause that was pretty epic but i love\nthat\nyou know i love the idea of mastery\nthat's something that's always been\nfascinating to me as well and i can geek\nout about mastery but when i look at\nyour childhood which i got to explore\nthrough this book\nyou describe yourself as an orphan with\nparents and i think right now in society\nwe're at this time where\na lot of people have started\nreflecting more on their childhood and\nhow it formed their habits their\nbehaviors their ideologies\nwhat are some of the before we dive into\nyour childhood specifically\nor let's actually let's dive into that\noften with parents and then what i\nreally want to hear about is what were\nthe ideologies\nthat were created from that that you\nfound were healthy and then ones that\nyou found that were unhealthy i want to\nhear about both so so tell us about\ngrowing up as an orphan with parents\nyeah my dad's black my mom's white but\ni'm the only one who looks white um but\nit was like it's my culture it's my\npeople so i fit in there was it was\nnever an issue it was never anything it\njust was what it was it wasn't really\nmore so until i got into entertainment\nand hip-hop that people wanted to kind\nof put you into this box\nmy father was addicted to crack cocaine\nmy mother had also done various drugs\nshe fell into prostitution when she was\nyoung\nalcoholic\nit just really wasn't a good a good\nthing she was very mentally unstable\nbipolar\ni'd like to thank borderline\nschizophrenic\nwhich was really crazy too um and yeah i\nmean i was surrounded by drugs and\nviolence and guns and shooting guns and\ncooking crack and my brothers selling\ncrack to my dad and them running around\nin the street and it was just a really\nnot like a good uh place to be but the\ncraziest thing is is i am the only child\nbetween my mother and father\nso i was like an only child\nalthough i have eight brothers and\nsisters which is really crazy on both\nsides but we were never\ntogether it was never like a family\nsituation um\nand yeah i mean growing up i think\ni'd like to you know people say oh well\nhow did you how did you make it out of\nthat how are you who you are today and i\nalways say it's like god and common\nsense and i will further go on to say\nlike i'm not really a super religious\nguy but i also don't i don't hate on\nreligion i don't hate on people's faith\ni think it's very important i think it's\nbeautiful\ni don't see it as like sky dad like some\nwhite guy with a beard sitting on a\ncloud i don't really i don't know i\ndon't know if it's a it's a guy it's a\ngirl it's a this it's a that but i do\nbelieve in something i believe in a\nhigher power and i think that mixed with\ncommon sense was like oh maybe don't\nsmoke crack oh you know seeing my mother\nbeing beaten and bloody by men oh don't\nput your hands on a woman it was just a\nweird thing where another any other\nchild or most other children would see\nthese things and go oh this is this is\nlife this is what it is you yell at a\nwoman you hit a woman you do this you do\nthat i was like no don't do that and i\ndon't know how\nor why but i'm here and uh i'm\ndefinitely not smoking crack or beating\nmy wife so i think i'm doing all right\ni think that makes a lot of sense that\nthat resonates with me deeply i always\nfeel like\nyou know if someone grows up with\nalcoholic parents\nif you had twins one of them could\nbecome an alcoholic and one of them\ncould never drink alcohol right it's\nlike you you get to make that choice\nwhen you have an experience you made\ncertain choices\nwas there any lessons that you learned\nearly from either of them do you think\nthere was something that\nkind of gave you this desire for mastery\ngave you this desire for\nuh figuring things out for living life\nin a specific way or or actually was a\nlot of it just survival\nand and having to find your own way at\n17 years old when you you know finally\nleft it's funny that you asked that\nbecause i i\nwhen it comes to mastery yes like i\nabsolutely do love making something my\neverything like just utterly\nallowing it to just\nengulf me um and i think maybe a lot of\nthat is because\nmy parents didn't necessarily do that\nyou know my mother she had a lot of\nhobbies and things that she was into she\nwas into writing she loved music she\nloved dance she did love a lot of things\nbut she never really focused on one\nthing\nwith the exception of i guess like\nreading the bible but she was also very\nhypocritical when it came to religion\nand i'd also just like to say it's very\nimportant that i say this\nwhen you hear me talking about my family\ni want you to know that in no way is it\nwith malice or hatred or anger uh you\nknow i've forgiven these people for what\nthey've done and i look at them\nespecially now i look at my son and i'm\nlike i couldn't i don't know how you\nknow somebody could do this to a baby or\na child the things that i went through\nyou know my mom called me and the rest\nof her kids the n word with a hard r and\ni remember people saying like oh that\ndoesn't really make any sense like that\ncan't be true that doesn't make any\nsense and it's like one first of all\ndon't dismiss my truth and second of\ncourse it doesn't make any sense and\ni've spent my entire life trying to make\nit make sense and then realizing oh it\njust doesn't this is a mentally ill\nbroken person this person is lashing out\nnot only at her children but at people\naround i mean think about it it's kind\nof weird that my mother is systemically\nracism\nracist and yet all of her children are\nwith black men because she finds black\npeople so beautiful which really just\nstems from her bling bringing a young\nblack man home when she was a teenager\nand saying this is my boyfriend and then\nher parents being like we don't mix with\ntheir kind it's all really\ninsane and there's levels of that but\nback to mastery sorry you'll find i go\non tangible i love the tangent i love\nthe tension i think the fact that she\nnever necessarily focused on one\nparticular thing made me want to focus\non one particular thing and when you're\na kid you try different things you play\nbasketball baseball you draw you dance\nyou this you that but there was always\nsomething about\nmusic\nand i wanted to\nreally make it my life so i think yeah\nthose examples that she kind of said or\nnecessarily didn't set made me want to\ndo that yeah how do you get to that\npoint bobby when i'm hearing you talk\nabout your family and i loved what you\nsaid that hey i'm not\nyou know i'm not putting their dirty\nlaundry out there i'm not trying to put\nthem down i'm not being critical i'm\njust sharing because i want to be\nvulnerable and share my truth and the\nexperience\ni think it would be very natural for\npeople to have resentment for people to\nhave bitterness you said i've got to a\nplace where i've forgiven them now i\nwant to hear how did you get to that\nwhat i loved something that you did\nthere which was so beautiful was you\nwere able to\ndisconnect her behavior from it being\npersonal to you you were like this is\njust how she was with everyone because\nthis was a condition she was struggling\nwith this wasn't about me bobby the kid\nbeing\na loser being useless being bad how how\nwere you able to get to that process of\nforgiving some of these experiences that\nyou had\nuh i mean definitely just maturity\ngrowth and i think my own personal\njourney as a as a young man um\nand realizing\num\nwhat dysfunction is and was so it's like\ni was able to realize\nthis is a sick person i once again god\ncommon sense i don't know but i just\nknew oh this isn't right you know it's\nlike you know i only had a few places of\ni guess neutrality we could call it\nwhere i would go to like the skate park\nand i would just see your normal average\nperson right and that has nothing to do\nwith\nwealth or money or this or that but just\nyour normal kind of regular\nrun-of-the-mill kid and his parents and\ni'd go oh like i would i was realizing\nlike you know that like my mother never\nreally came to the skate park to watch\nme skateboard and then this kid you know\nhas as his parents coming of all races\nand colors and and and people and\nthey're just there and i just saw this\nand i was like oh this isn't right\nbut i also understand now don't get me\nwrong there was times when i was angry\nof course like i'm angry like i had to\nlearn how to ride my bike by myself i\nremember one of my earliest memories is\nchoking on a sandwich and my mom then\nscolding me\nthat i had thrown it up because i\ncouldn't breathe and she made me clean\nit up and i'm like five years old like\nno like you clean that up and then\nconsole me and hug me and tell me\neverything's gonna be okay you know like\ni didn't have that but i think while i\nwas going through it even though there\nwas that anger there was this\nthis these moments of like understanding\noh\nthere is something wrong here and for a\nlong time i was angry at her in her\nmental state and her this and her that\nbut then as i started to experience\nanxiety and you know just\nnormal things that you do as you grow\nand age and mature i realized oh wow\nlike this isn't really her fault so it's\nbut i'm also not here to excuse her\nactions by any mean i mean my mother she\nalmost uh she almost killed me when i\nwas about seven or eight years old she\nalmost strangled me to death um and then\nstopped in the middle of what she was\ndoing and realized what she was doing\nand i remember very vividly looking at\nher and seeing like oh so much anger and\ni didn't really do anything i was just\nbouncing off the walls like a kid having\nfun you know i i wasn't no matter what a\nchild shouldn't be met with almost being\nyou know essentially strangled an inch\nfrom their life and i remember\ncrying and having tears in my eyes and\nit was almost like i was looking at her\nyou know through like underwater glasses\nand then she stopped after realizing\nwhat she was doing and i just told her i\nsaid it's okay mommy like i love you\nlike it's okay and i look back at that\nnow\nand realize that but\ni'm more sad for her than me\nbecause i made it out\ni made it out so i i don't know how i\ndid but this woman still has to live\nwith herself\nand i i wish i could have a relationship\nwith her so bad and\ni'm kind of on and off with my dad like\none of my dad's last requests was 800\n000 so he could buy himself a studio for\nhim in his band some house like it's\njust like it's ludicrous it's like hey\ndad\ncan i maybe like can we just talk about\nlife for a second every time i talk to\nmy father it's always music this and\nmusic that but i also realize that very\nmuch so like my mother uh with my dad\nthat's all he knows so he talks to music\nabout music to everybody not just me but\ni just think it's funny that i started\nto get a lot more phone calls once uh\nonce the name logic started getting\nbigger i thought that was weird but when\nit comes to forgiveness and\nhaving this sight\num i i don't know man i don't know and\nwriting this book was very cathartic and\nvery beautiful and it allowed me um to\nforgive even more\nbut\ni i know i'm sorry cop out i just don't\nknow that's that's not a copa i\nappreciate the honesty and uh i i love\nwhat you said there because when you\nlook at forgiveness\nit doesn't excuse the other person of\ntheir behavior it just exits you from\nthe\nbaggage of carrying it and so you know i\nthink that distinction's really\nimportant that you made there that hey\nyou know i was put in pain i was almost\nkilled this is as bad as it went but i\ndon't want to carry all of that with me\nand i think the\nzooming out and the broader perspective\nof hey this is just how they're\ninteracting with everyone it's not just\nme i think those are really practical\nsteps actually that whether you took\nthem knowingly or unknowingly\nconsciously or unconsciously\nthey're really powerful things for\neveryone to take away i i wonder now as\na father\nyou know you've you've got your adorable\nson we see a picture of him in the back\nof the book\nyeah uh i i wonder now when you're as a\nfather which is such a amazing step and\nyou said it was february last year so\nhe's like well 18 months old now yeah\nyeah 19 months old\nuh tell us about\nhow you're approaching parenting i want\nto hear about as a father\nhow you're thinking about it what are\nsome of the values or principles\nthat you're hoping to teach him or he or\nyou're hoping that he'll learn\nmy biggest thing is communication i\nthink it's so very important to be able\nto communicate with uh\nwith your children and also not getting\namnesia my godmother mary jo who took me\nin for a nice uh time in my life when i\nwas a teenager she told me that like you\ncan't get amnesia like you can't forget\nthat like kids do stupid things or kids\nyou know like even just i don't know if\nyou're in seventh grade and your heart\ngets ripped out by some boy or some girl\nthat you were dating for like eight days\nand it feels like the end of the world\nand they they broke up with you just\nbefore the school dance and your life is\nover and it's like as an adult it's so\neasy to brush that off and be like oh\n[ __ ] you're fine you'll be fine shut up\nbut it's like even though that's true\nand even though you should say that\nmaybe\nnot as\ncallous you know but it's like don't\nforget man don't forget that you were\nthere and that\nseventh grade is your child's entire\nworld so it's kind of having those\nthings\nin my mind while moving forward um\nare very important spending time with\nthem is very important um and\nyeah but i think communication really is\nthe biggest thing you know a lot of\npeople will just get mad when like he's\nhe's in a slight hitting phase right now\nwhere he'll kind of like if he's\nfrustrated he'll throw something but\nit's and somebody could be like no you\nknow you don't throw things you don't\nbut it's like\nhe's so frustrated because he has he he\nlacks the ability to be able to\ncommunicate with us so it's like okay\nstop pause let him know no we don't do\nthat like you don't throw things no you\ncan say it sternly but\nnot choking them to death like i think i\nthink that's uh what's really important\nand once again just seeing this little\nbeautiful\nperfect slate of a human being\nis\ni just don't know how people can do some\nof the things that\nthey do to children or that have been\ndone to to me it's kind of very\nsickening but i believe that it's up to\nme to to break that cycle and be one of\nthe first people in my family uh to do\nso not the only one there's some great\npeople in my family who have made it out\nbut yeah so when i look at him i think\nabout that love compassion communication\nand not getting amnesia yeah yeah i like\nthat point about not gaining amnesia and\nthe idea of\ni feel like one of the biggest mistakes\nwe all make as humans is that we keep\ncommunicating peop with people from\nwhere we are not where they are and so\nwe forget that we were where they are\nright now and if we just talk to them\nrecognizing that that was us 10 years\nago 20 30 50 whatever it is that that\nwould make all the difference\nand now you have a vocabulary for it we\ndo we understand mental illness better\nwe understand mental health we\nunderstand these terms a bit better\nwe're getting there\nhow\nhow did when was it when you first\nstarted realizing that this was mental\nillness this was mental health this was\nuh their conditioning and challenges\nthat were on a deeper level as a per\njust\nmore than just their addiction\ni think just simply like i said by being\nable to make the uh connection or lack\nthereof between a friend of mine's\nparents and my parents like just seeing\nyour kind of normal person who can go\nand hold a job i think my mom only ever\nhad like two jobs i think she worked at\na supermarket for a little bit and she\nworked at chick-fil-a and she could not\nstand people telling her what to do and\ni realized that and yet then she would\ntell me what to do and yet i had to just\nsuck it up and take it um\nand then even even with myself like i\nsaid me going through anxiety was like a\nbig\neye opener and i remember my first panic\nattack i was like 13 years old\nand um it was really scary and my mom\nhad gone away\nwell i mean she just went to the store\nfor like an hour but i had this panic\nattack and\ni started to realize i was i was dealing\nwith like separation anxiety from my\nmother\nand that a lot of our relationship was\nmore uh based on brainwashing which\nsounds crazy but\nthe the\nhaving this feeling that i needed her\nand that if she wasn't there like my\nentire world would crumble\nand i didn't know how to deal with\nanxiety um and honestly i only really\nlearned how to deal with anxiety much\nlater in life like in my late 20s i'm 31\nnow and even right now jay like i'm i'm\npretty anxious right now i don't know\nwhy it's really weird\ni felt fine before i got on in front of\nthe camera and even right now like i\nhave this like\nfeeling of anxiety and maybe it's a\nnumber of things maybe it's uh\ni'm recounting my childhood i just i\nhave a book that's come out uh you know\nso many things that are going on in my\nmind i'm fine i know i'm fine i'm\ndrinking water i'm talking to an amazing\nhuman being i'm everything is okay and\nyet internally there is still is a part\nof me that feels a little jittery and a\nlittle nervous and a little this and a\nlittle that and um\ni've learned how to deal with that and\ninstead of like freaking out\ni just go you're fine it's okay\nfeeling this way is normal\num i remember speaking with my therapist\nand she told me um i was like i hate the\nfact that i feel anxious\ni was like there's people out there that\ndon't really you know they just have\nkind of general anxiety but they don't\nhave that anxiety where it can also\naffect them physically where they feel\nweird or\nthey feel like they could pass out or\nthis or did that and she was like yeah\nuh and then sometimes it happens to them\nlike tony soprano when they're in their\n50s trying to feed the ducks and you\nknow in their pool and then that's just\ntheir life after that and she said the\nthing is is not\nlike you you have to accept that that's\njust who you are and that's the way your\nlife is now and do the best that you can\nto combat and deal with that anxiety and\nthose emotions in the most positive\nuh manner possible so it wasn't until i\nstarted truly understanding what anxiety\nmeant and how much it can affect your\nday-to-day personal and professional\nlife\nthat i i even grew more sympathetic\ntowards my mother and all the things\nthat she was dealing with yeah well i\nwant to thank you for sharing that and\nalso just to say that i do think it's\nnatural and extremely brave when you're\nsharing such personal accounts of things\nin your life and you're putting them out\nthere and\nwe we know the world we live in where\neverything we say is\nyou know it's natural for you to feel\nthat way so i i really appreciate you\neven opening up and sharing that and i\njust want you to know that i think\nyou're\nsharing your story not just on this\ninterview but in this book\nin a way that is going to help so many\npeople with their perspective so i want\nyou to know that and i also want you to\nknow that\nwe yeah we all have anxiety i i\nofficiated someone's wedding this\nweekend the wedding that the weekend\nthat just went and my wife said it to me\nshe was like yeah i've never seen you\nthis anxious or stressed in your life\nwith anything you do\nand i was like because it's someone's\nwedding day i was like and people were\nlike oh but you've done this a million\ntimes and you've done and i was like it\ndoesn't matter how many times i've done\nit it's someone different and it's their\nwedding day\nand this is an important moment for\nsomeone and what i've realized and i\nlove what you said there because i do\nsomething similar i've redefined my\nrelationship with anxiety that i feel\nanxious when i care\nso i know that when i'm feeling anxious\nit's because it's something good about\nme is that i care i'm a human that loves\nand cares and is compassionate and wants\nto serve these two beautiful people that\ni wedded that i love and that love me\nand i have a relationship with it's\nbecause of that i'm not scared about\nwhat someone thinks about it or how it\ngoes i'm i'm\nanxious because i care about these two\npeople and i feel they deserve something\nspecial it's funny you say that because\nanother thing that i had dealt with for\ni mean everybody deals with it is\nintrusive thoughts you're aware of this\nright intrusive thoughts so it could be\nthe craziest thing it could be\nyour baby falling to its death it could\nbe you i don't know punch in a store\nclerk and you're just like oh my god why\nwould i think that how could i think\nsomething so despicable or whatever the\ncase may be these dark thoughts um and i\nremember talking to my therapist and she\nwas like well one those aren't really\nyour thoughts you're not thinking that\nshe was like that's kind of douche bag\nbrain she put it she was like it's just\nthese thoughts that pop into your head\nand you need to understand that that's\nthat's also um like conscious like your\nyour conscious\nrecognizes that and is then terrified\nand\nso i think when it comes to anxiety and\nthe things you care about it's like oh\nmy god if i think about my baby dying\nit's because that's the most precious\nthing to me if i think about i don't\nknow like i said punching some clerk in\nthe face it's like violence i hate\nviolence so it's these things that my\nbrain is doing that that i'm kind of\nthen freaking out about but it's about\nhow we deal with that if we then uh\nfocus on it too much and obsess why\nwould i think that why would i think\nthat why would i think that then every\ntime we're in a situation where that\nthought is then triggered then it just\nbecomes more intense and the real the\nkey there is to not really focus on it\nis to really not think about it\nunderstand that it's a thought it's a\ndisgusting thought that you didn't even\nthink in your head it just somehow\npopped in and you were like oh my\ngoodness you know to hell with you and\nthat's also how i feel about anxiety i\nthink there's a difference between\nlegitimately like oh i'm starting to see\nstars or i feel like i i need to sit\ndown like that could be different even\nthough it may be anxiety but it's like\nask yourself have you been working\nreally hard have you drank enough water\ntoday have you eaten have you this have\nyou that and having the the mind\nthe mindset to be able to just\nask yourself what is going on and that\nwas something i couldn't do for a long\ntime i was very unhealthy both\nphysically and mentally um and once i\nreally learned how to utilize these\ntools\nuh my life became better but i mean i\nstill get anxiety like it sucks yeah but\nit also is great i mean i'm not going to\nsay anxiety is great anxiety just sucks\nbut but\nit's\nlook at this great conversation we're\nhaving because of it i've made songs\nabout it i've written parts in scripts\nabout it i've like i get it and i\nunderstand it and because of that it's\nactually allowed me to connect with\npeople um on such a deeper level and\nbeing willing to go because i'll tell\nyou this man i love rap i love hip-hop\nit's a beautiful place it's also a\nnegative place just like the world is\nand but i've met a lot of rappers where\ni try to have like deeper conversations\nwith them and they just don't do it\nbecause i think they're all so scared\nand\nto internalize how they're feeling but i\ndid have one guy and he i'll never\nforget he was like bro i wish i could be\nyou and i was like what do you mean i'm\nlike the nerd rapper who solves rubik's\ncubes and raps about sci-fi you're like\nyou're that dude you know you got the\ncred even though low-key i've shot guns\nand cooked crack so i guess i have the\ncred as well but i don't really\nperpetuate that life and he was like\nlook man\nhe was like i'm scared he was like that\nwas so long ago that's not who i am\nanymore he's like i like video games i\nlike this i like that i wish i could\njust be myself and when he said that to\nme i realized that all the years and\ntime that times that i'd been made fun\nof in hip-hop or this or that well at\nthe end of the day i may have been made\nfun of by a certain sect or\nquote-unquote cool group or the jocks of\nrap but at least i was always myself and\nnever had to pretend to be somebody i\nwas not and then that led to you know\njust saying i'd rather be hated for who\ni am than love for who i'm not which i\nthink like kurt cobain or somebody said\nyeah\nbut yeah there it is yeah no that's a\nbeautiful message man i think that's\nsomething everyone can relate to and\nwhat you were speaking about there about\nthe douchebag brain uh in in the\nmonastery we used to call it the monkey\nmind and the monk mind so you have the\nmonkey mind that's you know saying all\nthese intrusive thoughts as you said\nsaying all these self-doubt anxiety and\nthen you have the monk mind which is the\nthe calm distill the balance and to\nbring that monkey mind back under\ncontrol and so\nyeah for me that was always uh that was\nalways a fun way of thinking about it\njust like i've just got this monkey\nthat's jumping from branch to branch in\nmy head and you know it doesn't know\nwhat it wants and it's confused and it's\nmoving fast but the monk mine can kind\nof ground it so that that aligns very\nstrongly i've always i always saw this\nguy who looks like i want you to imagine\nlike a cartoon there's this episode of\nfuturama it's one of my favorite\ncartoons but um\ni forget the episode but there's like\nthis liquid guy and he's like blue and\nhe looks like just kind of moving water\nand his head's all back and he looks\nkind of cool i imagine that guy\nin a in a leather jacket sitting on a um\nlike a a beach chair in my brain\nand he's responsible for these thoughts\nhe's like you said the monkey mind it's\nlike this monkey but it's like that's\nhow i see this guy\nand i've actually had conversations with\nthis guy like get out of here dude like\nlike it's like chill like stop and then\nhe'll say something to me that i hear\nand it almost sounds like i'm crazy\nright because it's like i'm having a\nconversation with myself in my head but\ni have had this and i'm like no like not\ntoday man and sometimes he really he'll\nhe'll hit me with some crazy images or\nme freaking out or going to the\nemergency room or just all these things\nbecause i'm always constantly thinking\nabout my health and\ni have to have those conversations and\ntell the water blob or monkey man or\nwhatever to calm down\nand and do my best to be in control\nwhich is actually really funny\nbecause i'm not in control we're not\nreally in control and i think accepting\nthe fact that you're not in control in\nsome weird way gives you a bit of\ncontrol at the same time but yeah yeah\nyeah it definitely gives you more\ncontrol over what you can control if\nthere's any of that that you can do so\nno i like that and i love the futurama\nreference all for futurama references\nwhat was what would you say was your\nearly you referred to this earlier so\ni'm i'm bringing it back\nwhat would you say was your earliest\nmemory of becoming aware of racism\nuh and and experiencing it for yourself\nor trying to understand it as a young\nperson who obviously has a very diverse\nchildhood but people not being able to\nunderstand contextualize i want to know\nwhat that's like from your perspective\nlike i say in the book that that racism\nfor me when i first experienced it\nwasn't outside and it was inside out\nright because it was my mother\num who used this word i mean it's really\ndisgusting but but the way she would she\nwould do it she would do it in a way\nwhere\nuh it it's just\nwhatever would cut deep you know like if\nyou were fat she'd call you fat if\nyou're ugly she'd call you ugly if you\nwere black she would you know use these\nslurs anybody any race any of this any\nthat which i always just thought was so\ndisgusting because she would like say\nthis and then next week she'd take me to\nthe library and we'd be getting like\nblack history month like dvds and vhs\nand she's like you need to be proud of\nyour of your heritage and i'm just like\nwhat is wrong with you so like there was\nthat\num and then\nthe crazy thing about racism is like\nokay first of all it's 100\nit exists it's a real thing but like\nespecially kind of like in the hood\nwhere i grew up it's just different it's\nlike\nthe white boys are hanging out with the\nbrothers and and and you know the\nmexican cats and everybody we're all\njust hanging out together like unless\nit's like gangs who are like just don't\nmess with a certain demographic of other\npeople but for the most part man like oh\neverybody was just hanging it wasn't\nreally like that and then once you start\ngrowing up is where you realize like\nthese sects and these like this division\nreally comes in so for me it was very\nweird to to enter hip-hop a place that i\nlove\nand loved and\nis built on on positivity and all the\nway from sugar hill gang and krs1 and\nyou know it's it is built on a message\nrun dmc like be yourself and it was also\na lot of fun braggadocia but for the\nmost part it was like you know this is\nthe story and that we're here to tell um\nand so for me i was like oh wow i can\ntell my story\nso it's it i was like there in these\nlast 10 years at the cusp of hip-hop\nbecoming like loki the most popular\ngenre of music and the more quote\nunquote pop that it got the more\nattention was brought on\nall of the people who were heading it at\nthe front line and i being one of those\npeople um received a lot of hate that\nwas basically all based on my\nrace\nwhich was very difficult because um it\nwas like a double-edged sword and there\nwas really no winning you're damned if\nyou do you're damned if you don't i'd go\nin an interview and they'd say okay yeah\nso we here with this uh with this rapper\nnamed logic so what's it like being\nwhite and hip hop and blah blah blah and\ni have to go well first of all i'm not\ni'm black and white um so i mixed and\nthen and then that turns into comments\non the internet like why's he always got\nto be proven himself why has he always\ngot to explain why is he always getting\nit's like well one i'm just telling you\nwho i am so first and foremost like you\nknow you're\nfor you to look at me and just claim\nthat i'm one thing no i i am proud to be\nthis thing which the double-edged sword\nis then what if i never said it and then\nyou find out that my dad's black and\nthen a year later you're like so what\nyou're ashamed to be black you're trying\nto use this whole white thing to get and\nthen it's that and you know you have\nincredible artists like kendrick lamar j\ncole killer mike black thought from the\nroots talking about their black and\nevery song how they they're happy to be\nblack they're proud to be black i'm\nblack i'm black and black i'm the\nblackest and then for the first time in\nmy career on my third album after\nconstantly being called this thing that\ni didn't necessarily identify with on\nthree songs i go hey i'm biracial i'm\nmixed i'm actually black and white\nthey turned it into this like biracial\nmeme and then i have white kids and\nblack kids and brown kids and all these\nother people trying to tell me what i am\nor what i'm not and it was a very\ndifficult time in my life until i\nrealized\nit's literally just a meme\nit has nothing to do with anything the\nmusic is so good the music is getting\nbillions of streams the music is\nplatinum they did it i'm in arenas i'm\nselling out oh this is just a talking\nsubject it's it's low hanging fruit it's\neasy for these people to try to identify\nme for what they claim me as put me in\nthat box and leave it at that and that\nwas a big part of me stepping away from\nthe internet and realizing oh it doesn't\neven matter yeah and it's almost like\nit's almost like you were repeating what\nyou had to do as a child like as a child\nyou had to be like okay this is not my\nmom this is her illness this is her\nchallenge it's not about me and so now\nit's like mom is kind of like the\ninternet where it's like okay\nright yeah like whoa\nactually like the way you say it's kind\nof insane\nbecause yeah i then had this like very\nnegative but also beautiful relationship\nat the same time with the internet and\nsocial media and all this which in many\nways was constantly berating me and\nharassing me and yelling at me and\nscreaming at me the same way my mother\ndid when i was a child wow nice pull\nyou're a genius no yeah no it's just\nintere i just i love seeing how like\npatterns repeat in people's lives and\nhow we have to\nit's almost like you you've overcome the\nfirst challenge of the upbringing and\nthen it's like well here's the escalated\nchallenge of it with now like millions\nof people who don't know you and then as\nyou said you're selling out arenas\npeople love the music the music's\nawesome uh you know you're getting to\nsee the real version of that tell us\nabout how you with all of this that\nwe've already talked about and i saved\nthis for this part of the interview and\nyou write a book called this bright\nfuture which is your memoir and i'm like\ni love that like i just i don't even\nknow how much i love that like how tell\nus where that title comes from and why\nthis bright future when\nuh\nwas that a\ni'm asking this was that an imagination\nwas that a vision where did that come\nfrom um so there's a there's a band\ncalled manford man's band and um they\nhave a song\ni've actually had tried to sample them\nfor years and years and years because\nthey they have some really cool\nstuff no id sampled who i'm homies with\nsampled them for a bunch of kanye west\nsongs and things like that back in the\nday beautiful twisted fantasy\nand so\ni'd been searching and searching and\nsearching and finally in 2020 i found\nthis sample\nand it's called uh\nlies through the 80s and there's this\nlyric and it goes i saw a boy with no\nsmile on his face today where is my\nbright future in this world or whatever\num so\ni loved that and i sampled that and\nchopped it up for a song called heard\nhim say on my\nlast album no pressure\nand that to me is like the epitome of\nwhat the book is about my place and rap\nis about hip-hop like it kind of sums\nthat up and then we just had this idea\nlike wow what if what if that was the\ntitle and i love it because if you look\nat the cover you'll see\num it's it's actually so the under\nexcuse me the no pressure cover is me\nkind of levitating\nin a basement that's breaking up into\nspace\nnow nine albums before that was my debut\nalbum under pressure and that was me in\na basement in my homie lenny's basement\nwhen i was broke in college park just\ntrying to get a record deal which i\neventually got and we all moved to la\nand that was awesome\nso\nwhen you're looking at the no pressure\ncover you'll see i'm facing you and i'm\nlevitating and you see my feet in the\nair for this bright future the the\nmemoir cover um you'll see it's actually\nfrom the back of my legs\nand then\nit's a reflection so i'm this grown man\nkind of like rising and heading in\ntowards\ntowards the light you know not the\ndarkness and then you see a child\nfalling in to darkness which to me kind\nof represents my birth and where i spent\nmy entire childhood but somehow\nfalling into darkness i levitated into\nlightness and i don't know or into the\nlight excuse me and i have no idea how\nthat happened but that's what that all\nmeans to me i love that i want i want\npeople to see that because i i do think\nit's\nit's beautifully artistic and uh thank\nyou and absolutely stunning and i wanted\nto hear you describe that to everyone\nbecause\nyeah i just love symbolism and i love\nvisuals that can make you feel something\nand\ni think when you see this everyone can\ni'm looking at it right now and i'm i'm\ngoing and i can relate in my own way to\nwhat it feels like to be that kid that's\nfalling\nand i can relate in my own way to what\nit feels like that person that's\nelevating\nand i i wonder this you know when i\nspeak too logic when i read the book\nbobby it's like\nyou have such a great understanding of\npsychology thought the mind i wanna when\ndid you get fascinated with how this all\nworks what were you reading what were\nyou listening to who were you speaking\nto that help you understand that the way\nyou speak is so structured and thought\nout and you recognize where things sit\nand how they are where did that come\nfrom where did it get nourished and and\nhow did you grow that\num\nwell thanks man you make me sound like\nsmart or something dude you're very i\nmean i really mean it i really mean it\num i i think uh\ni've always loved language and i think\nit's a beautiful thing\num i wish i had a a doper vocabulary\nlike neil degrasse tyson or something i\nwas hanging out with neil degrasse tyson\nand he was like saying equivocal or what\ni was just like i need to step my game\nup when i was younger though i i saw the\npower of words and i would study the\ndictionary and i would study the\nthesaurus um\ni also wanted to separate myself from\nany you know of my contemporaries or\neven my predecessors in in hip-hop as\nwell now i'm not saying that i think i'm\nthis like you know oh i use words they\ndon't use not at all you take somebody\nlike nas i mean this dude was doing the\nsame thing back in the day in the\nprojects and on queensbridge and he was\nusing like the cr he was using words\nlike cerebral like nobody would say that\nlike he would be other cats were just\nlike yeah\nyou know take a gunshot to the head he'd\nbe like take a gunshot through the\ncerebral cortex and the spine and i'm\njust like yo this is so cool\num i i also i've always just been so\ninspired by quentin tarantino and you\nknow he didn't go to film school\nhe just did it and he was like he he\nmade movies his life he studied film in\na way\nthat\nyou just couldn't even do at film school\nhe learned things like on the street and\nthat's how i felt when it came to um\ni guess just my mentality about life\nlike i looked at people like alan watts\nwho has one of the greatest quotes i've\never heard personally says anything you\ncan be interested in you will find\nothers who are and that in and of itself\nalone is what inspired me to be me is to\nbe this guy who did yes has come\nfrom being surrounded by drugs and guns\nand violence but wanting to rap about\nanime and sci-fi and i think\nstudying great\nminds and reading and\nuh i'm mainly a visual audio person\nhonestly but yeah taking the time to\nread and just study\num\nis\nwhat helped me grow as a man and a\nmusician i mean i didn't graduate high\nschool man i got kicked out so it's like\num i think formal education is awesome\nand it's important depending on where\nyou know the trajectory of your life and\nwhere you see your path going and your\ncareer um but not for me man\nschool of hard knocks dog like i don't\nknow how it worked but i'm glad it did\nbut i also think that it's like i'm just\nlike a regular dude who made some kind\nof okay decisions and i also love that\nyou know i\ni always hated teachers who spoke down\non you that that like when you asked a\nquestion they they almost made you feel\nstupid for doing so so it's like i'm a\nprofessional at my craft i'm a master at\nwhat i do but in no way do i ever want\nanybody to feel either intimidated or\nlike i think i'm so\nknowledgeable in my world that they feel\nlike we can't even have a conversation\nso i think there's levels to also the\nvocabulary that you use\num when having conversations with people\nbecause it's like dude you want to be\ndown to earth you want to be regular but\nyou also want to let people you know you\nknow that you know what they're talking\nabout so yeah for sure man it's so it's\nit's a great i was literally just about\nto ask you about school after when you\nmentioned it i was gonna say because you\nfelt like school gave up on you\nand and i think there's a lot of young\npeople that feel that way where school\ngave up on them and i loved what you\nsaid you're not discouraging anyone from\nfollowing a traditional school pattern\nor whatever it may be\nbut when you when you think about school\ni wonder if if\nif logic was to set up a school inspire\na school what would be some of the\nexciting classes and lessons that would\ngo on in that school\nvideo game testing that's the number one\ni'm serious man because think about how\nlong all these parents were always like\nvideo games will rot your brain there's\nno future and now you've got pro video\ngamers making\nmillions hundreds of millions of dollars\nplaying video games and having fun and\ndoing this thing so it's like\ni sucked at math but\nme and these teachers we didn't speak\nthe same language you know these are\npeople who like want to make a\ndifference in a kid's life but has no\nidea that his mother is suffering from\nthis insane mental illness or how to\ndeal with that it's like there was no\nreal line of\nof communication and understanding\nbetween me and these people who are\nsupposed to essentially teach me not\nonly about you know academics but life\nin many ways so i wish i had somebody\nwho spoke my language i wish i had\nsomebody who\nunderstood oh wow like this kid really\nlikes video games\nhave you ever thought about coding video\ngames what do you mean what are you\ntalking about coding video games well\ncreating this world what are you talking\nabout well it's all binary it's ones and\nzeros it's math yeah but if you actually\nfocus on math you could engineer an\nentire world that a video game takes\nplace in well you don't say like it's\nlike i never had that conversation it\nwas just do algebra or drop out and\nthat was very difficult yeah i think\nthat's small i couldn't agree more i\nthink\ni always grow up thinking i didn't know\nthat any other industries existed from\nmedicine law\nand finance like beyond that i didn't\neven know there was a potential to have\nanother job because i didn't meet anyone\noutside of those industries and i didn't\nknow anyone who had been accomplished or\nsuccessful outside of those industries\nand so you end up just going well well\nthen these are just my three options and\nand i think there is such a limitation\nplaced on that because you're just\nunaware when you\nthink about now\nobviously you've made it in an industry\nwhich is highly competitive\nit's difficult it's saturated it's like\nevery kid's dream to want to be a rapper\nhave their music or their song be heard\nyeah\nwhen you go back to the days when it\nwasn't working musically\nwhat was\nthe thing that kept you going was it\nthat you were chasing a deal or a hit\nor\nwas it that you just loved it so much\nthat you just believed in it anyway\nwhere where was that what kept you going\nuh probably craziness\nbecause it's like you have to be crazy\nto think oh i'm gonna make it as a\nrapper\nbut the difference with me though is\nlike i looked at it from a business\nstandpoint like i was like okay if i\ncould take a brand myself be myself be\nhonest i feel like there's not really a\nlot of me in rap and there's not really\na lot of me in major rap or major music\nmainstream music so\ni want to fill that void\nand\nas i started to write these songs where\ni'm like believe in yourself peace love\nand positivity you can do it you can be\nwhatever you want like people started\nengaging with that and we're like wow\nthis isn't just the traditional what is\nrap or what is this or that or whatever\nthe case may be and i don't say that in\nany with any negative connotation or\nanything you know it's like literally\nthere's a bunch of rap that's kind of\nnegative there's rap that's really good\nbut i felt this kind of nerdy sci-fi me\ncould break through\ni don't know why and i think it was\ninsane that to even begin to think that\nbut it was just like week by week little\nby little things were improving whether\nit was 10 extra followers on twitter i\nwas also utilizing and using social\nmedia in a way that um these platforms\nhadn't known about it or\nthey weren't ready for what was coming\nbecause it was cats like me kendrick\nlamar j cole mac miller wiz khalifa we\nwere utilizing this as a space where we\ndidn't need a major label and if we put\nout a song that was catchy enough\npeople could decide what they wanted to\nlisten to and so radio was dying mtv all\nthat stuff was kind of out of there\num and there was just this pocket of\nwhere you have these um\nlike blogs like this song is sick and\ntwo dope boys and people could go to a\nblog to find what they want and what\nthey love\nand\nthat allowed me to shine\nand do it and the bigger i got yeah\nthere were certain things that i was\nchasing i was chasing being able to go\non tour by myself being able to make a\nlot of money hopefully having a hit\nrecord but it's funny i had a very slow\nburning career um and i am asked\na lot of fans i was i was playing arenas\nbefore i ever had a hit song with 1-800\nand\nit's funny\nbecause when i gave up trying to chase\nthe hit i ended up making the song from\nmy heart the last nobody trust me nobody\nwas like\nin the studio like yeah song about\nsuicide about to take over the club dog\nlike nobody was thinking that okay so i\nmade this thing for my heart and it blew\nup and then after that i was just kind\nof like well\ni'm here i made 30 million dollars that\nyear i was doing records with\nmarshmallow and eminem and i was just\nlike let's go go go go\nand then i realized after over a decade\ni was on this hamster wheel\nand i was doing it and it's like how\nmany number ones can you have how many\nplatinum blacks can you have how many of\nthis can you have how many that can you\nhave i've literally attained and\naccomplished any everything that a\nmusician could dream to attain with the\nexception of winning a grammy which is\nmerely just a glorified pat on the back\nand so i had to look myself in the\nmirror and say why and i've purposefully\nslowed down so that i can focus on my\nmental and physical health so that i can\nfocus on being there for my child and my\nwife and that i can love and enjoy this\nlife and this house that i've spent the\nlast 17 years of my life\nbuilding and it is terrifying jay i'm\njust gonna be me\nand\ndo me\nand it it's not about the money it is\nabout value over fear and i used to\nvalue money and success and being\nthat guy\num\nover my health\nand i will never do that ever again\nthat's beautiful man well said i\nactually i picked out a few of your\nlyrics that were my favorite i want to\nread this one it's from a confession of\na dangerous mind you said search of a\nbliss only led me to searching for hits\nonly led me to battle depression i don't\nlearn my lesson because fame never\nlessened the pain and and you know that\nlyric for me\nuh is is so powerful to what you just\nsaid right now and\ni think you know for someone who has had\nso much success\nit's it's incredible because i feel no\nmatter how many times you hear that you\nhave to go do it for yourself right no\nmatter the oldest successful people i\nspeak to in the world i'm like\nevery one of them\nfeels exactly how you do but every one\nof them will say i had to go there to be\nable to accept it uh but it seems like\nyou've really allowed yourself to accept\nit genuinely and your family's become\nsuch a focus\ni want to hear more about what is what\ndoes it feel like to you to be a husband\nto be a father like we we started there\nwhen we were talking about your child\nhow have you prioritized that\nrelationship in your life like what does\nthat mean to you to\nyou know be in a relationship in a way\nthat you'd never seen before growing up\nwell one i just want to say you quoted\none of my favorite albums and an album\nthat was actually commercially my least\nquote unquote successful album because\nof the things i was discussing on that\nalbum and yet it's still to this date my\nmost popular album it's really funny how\nthat works so i just want to say that um\nmy relationship with my son and my wife\njust family\nit's the greatest thing\nin the world because\nwhen i was going through things or\nfeeling a certain way\nyou just look at this child\nand you go\nmy kid is healthy\nso so what if somebody on the internet's\nlike you're not black\nyou know what i mean it's like my my\nwife is is happy so what if somebody on\nthe internet's like you suck at rapping\nlike it's these things are so minuscule\nand they don't matter\nand i'm looking at what actually matters\nbut it is difficult once again to know\nand but it comes down to value over fear\nthere is fear that me stepping away i\nmay not be as big\nbecause i'm focusing on my family and my\npersonal\nuh men and physical and mental health\nbut i value that so much more than the\nfear of what could come i mean i i've\nbeen on the internet in two years and\ni've only ever jumped in if i like grab\nmy assistant's phone just to like tweet\nsomething and i could tweet something\nand as soon as it goes up i get like\nauto responses and a couple weeks ago i\nwas posting um\nbecause i did the i narrated the entire\nuh book this bright future and i posted\nsomething and somebody immediately was\nlike you fell off hard\nand i'm in my head like\ni just dropped an album last year and it\nsold 250 000\nunits in a week\nis that falling off like you know what i\nmean\nand then i remember what the what the\ninternet does to you and it makes you\nquestion yourself and second guess\nyourself and it's also very pay to play\nthe less time i spend on instagram if i\nhave six plus million followers every\ntime i post i don't see the same amount\nof love or this or\nor likes or views that i used to because\ni'm not constantly on it anymore so now\ni literally either have to pay for ads\nand space to get all this it's just kind\nof like a sick thing where if you pull\naway\nyou can't leave\nwhere you kind of left off\nbut once again i look at my boy and i\nrealize\nthat it's the matrix man like none of\nthat matters also i'm excited for that\nnew matrix movie coming out yeah\nyeah shout out to the matrix movie uh\nbut no i i i really appreciate\ni really appreciate hearing that from\nyou because i think as creatives\nwhatever space we're in everyone\neveryone focuses on that\nfeeling of being becoming irrelevant\nand\ni\npersonally believe that the time you\ntake out\nto rediscover yourself\nallows you to reinvent who you are and\nyour new creativity and define a genre\nand change a genre and upgrade and i\nfeel like it's all levels right like you\ncan have someone who does the same thing\nevery day\nall day every year\nor you see those people that have been\nrelevant every decade because they took\nit to another level right they did\nsomething different they did something\nmore innovative they did something\nsurprising and both of them i respect\nboth of them i'm not saying one's better\nthan the other but what i am saying yeah\nbut i want the latter man yeah right i\nwant to be bowie and queen like i don't\nwant to just you're right like i don't\nwant to just be out here\nlike working myself to death i'm sorry i\ndidn't mean to cut you off but i just so\ni agree with what you're saying\nbut it's just so scary especially in rap\nwhere it's like you're either on all the\ntime or you're not but i'm gonna be\nhonest jay like i haven't i'm not\nexcited there's no there's not an ounce\nin me that feels like touring right now\nthat feels like really going hard and\nlike promoting an album like i don't\nwant to do that and if i don't want to\ndo that then i shouldn't i should wait\nuntil the music is there i am excited\nand i cannot wait to go out and do it\nand i think i've dropped up one minimum\nsometimes two projects a year for the\nlast 12 years of my life wow i think i'm\ngoing to chill out yeah\nwell well i think that's the trade-off\nright like when people hear that if\nyou're at the beginning of your journey\nand you're listening to bobby right now\nand you're going oh yeah he's right let\nme just lay back and let me take my time\nthat probably is bad advice because at\nthat time in your life at that phase and\ni always say that people don't look at\nwhat people are doing at their stage\nlook at what they did at your face like\nlook at what they did yeah in your in in\nwhen they were your age when they were\nin your time when they were just\nbeginning because\nyou know that's the difference that\nyou've now earned a platform you worked\nhard for that you built that\nand that now gives you the flexibility\nto\nadapt and reinvent and recreate and\nfocus on your family whereas there was a\ntime when all you had to do was give it\nall you had because you had to be\npresent and so i and i think the mistake\nis what you said it's almost like what\nyou call like like broke mindset almost\nwhere you continue to live\nlike you don't have anything\nright and and if you continue to live\nthat way mentally emotionally\nfinancially spiritually then you can't\nsustain that and i think that's what\nhappens is that when you're on that\njourney upwards if you don't at one\npoint realize oh no now i do need to\nstart investing in my health i do need\nto start investing in my mind i do need\nto it's like athletes the athletes that\nhave lost it are athletes that realized\nafter they won everything that they\nneeded to eat right they needed to sleep\nright they needed to change their\nfitness schedule and that's why people\nlike tom brady still playing right\ncristiano ronaldo in europe if you're a\nsoccer fan still playing at 36 at the\ntop of the game so i feel like that's\nwhat you see these shifts in in leaders\nif that makes sense\nyeah you just snapped so hard\nthat's all the sense of the world yeah i\ni wholeheartedly agree with that\nstatement uh thank you man well i\nappreciate you we're gonna we're gonna\ngo to you've been very generous with\nyour time uh we end every on-purpose\nsegment with a final five so this is a\nfast five rapid fire round where every\nquestion has to be answered in one word\nor one sentence maximum easy for a\nfreestyle rapper and a musician uh but\nand you can answer in lyrics if you'd\nlike to uh\nso the first question is what is the\nbest advice you've ever received or\ngiven be yourself\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\nbe yourself\ni'm serious\nso\nso that depends on who you are no tell\nme explain explain the why it can be the\nworst i'll give you more words\num i think it's the best and it's really\nincredible\nbecause you\nare not a fraud you are yourself\nundoubtedly you are you and that is\namazing\nbut also when you are yourself at least\nin my genre and you put your whole life\nin a book and you put your whole\neverything that you are your love your\npassion into records and it's you it's\nnot a persona it's not you're not an\nactor playing\nuh you know a role that just wasn't\nreceived well in this movie and you're\nbrad pitt and you go on to make a bunch\nof other like you're you\nso when your highs are high they're high\nand when they're low they're low and\nwhen you are yourself you're not always\nloved or you might be kicked and you\nknow pulled down to the pits of hell but\nat the same time being yourself can open\nup heaven's gates so it's it was i know\nit's crazy but you said fire off rapidly\ni love it man those two are difficult\nyeah it's great all right question\nnumber three if you could have a dinner\nparty with three other people dead or\nalive who would they be\nbe yourself no i'm just kidding\nit would be um i would have to say\nquentin tarantino\num oh hold on let me think\ndinner party\num\num\nfreddie mercury oh man dude i'm so happy\nyou said that i love freddie mercury and\nqueen i i was not expecting yeah\nyou're the best and\nprobably\ncarl sagan uh i wanna i wanna be i wanna\nbe a i want to be a fly on the wall of\nthat dinner either carl sagan or malcolm\nx that would be the most yo tarantino\nand malcolm x\nthat's a wild conversation yeah anyway\nsorry no that'd be amazing i i was asked\nthat question this week by\nuh i was doing a a corporate event q a\nwith target and rehan from target asked\nme that question and i was like oh\nthat's a really cool question i want to\nknow who else everyone would want to sit\ndown with i said it was yours i said\nsteve jobs einstein and martin luther\nking those were my three wow uh i was\nlike those those minds in the same room\nwould be would be fascinating all right\nquestion number four uh what is the\nbiggest lesson you've learned in the\nlast 12 months\nreally being happy with yourself and and\nknowing like\nknowing your self-worth\nand just knowing what's important and\nthat's what i might my time my family my\nhealth that's what i've really really\nlearned in these last 12 months i love\nthat all right and fifth and final\nquestion if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\nthere's so many things but honestly the\nfirst one that comes is to just abolish\nguns\ni just wish guns didn't exist i wish i\ndidn't need them i wish people didn't\nneed them it would be amazing if they\nwere just all gone it'd be a lot of\nstabbings\nbut at least you know it wouldn't be\nlike yeah so i would that'd be great if\nuh all these mass shootings and things\nlike that could stop and wars and but i\nmean\nit's a fairy tale but that's what i\nwould do amazing thank you man everyone\nbobby hall aka logic this bright future\nuh that's the book we're gonna put the\nlink in
