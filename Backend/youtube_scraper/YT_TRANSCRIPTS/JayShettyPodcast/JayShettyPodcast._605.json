    "transcript": "we don't deserve the title of homo\nsapiens the wise ape\nbecause we've been destroying our only\nhome because there's been a disconnect i\nthink between this clever brain\nand\nthe human heart\ni love the way we poetically put love\nand compassion into the human heart and\nthen finally this indomitable human\nspirit that won't give in\nand so often succeeds how can you not\nhave hope\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now it's not every\nweek that you get to sit down with one\nof your heroes and legends i am not\ni am not overestimating at all this is\nsomeone that was on my original list of\npeople i wanted to sit down with when i\nstarted this podcast you know that i\nwant to sit down with thinkers activists\nphilanthropists and people that are\ndoing work in the world that inspires me\nand can inspire all of us to do more i'm\nspeaking about the one and only jane\ngoodall jane thank you so much for being\nwith me here today i am so grateful to\nspend this time with you and i i thank\nyou for giving me this opportunity\nwell thank you for inviting me and i'm\nsure we're going to have a wonderful\nconversation\nabsolutely jane whereabouts in the world\nare you right now\ni'm\nin england\nsouth of england\nbournemouth in the house where i grew up\nwhere i have been grounded since the\nbeginning of the pandemic\nwow i read that one of your favorite\nnovel series was tarzan i wanted to know\nwhat about that story lights you up and\nwhy it's one of your favorites\nwell actually you know when i look at\nthe original tarzan of the apes that\ninspired me i was 10 years old\nand oh i wanted to go to africa i wanted\nto live with wild animals in the forest\ni thought tarzan married the wrong jane\nif i read the book now\ni don't like it because there's an awful\nlot of killing and death and all that\nstuff but that's what inspired me and\nthat's what made my dream i will go to\nafrica live with wild animals and write\nbooks about them because\nback then girl i mean we're going back\nlike 78 years or something girls weren't\nscientists no girls went out in the\nforest everybody laughed at me jane\ndream about something you can achieve\nnot my amazing mother she said if you\nreally want to do something like this\nwell you're going to have to work very\nhard take advantage of every opportunity\nand if you don't give up maybe you'll\nfind a way\nthat's incredible advice from your\nmother what what do you think it was\nabout her that she was able to have that\nvision and that encouragement for you\napart from her love for you\nwhat what is it that you think made her\nspecial in that way especially at a time\nwhen women were being discouraged from\nanything of this sort she had a\nwonderful mother who was kind of way\nahead of her time\nand she had an extraordinary father who\nwas a congregational minister my one\nsadness i never met him he died before i\nwas born\nbut everything i've read about him you\nknow he used to go out in the woods he\nwould take his children out and tell\nthem about nature\nand i know that i would have got on so\nwell with him so basically my mother was\nspecial because she had special parents\nand that's that's important for us to\nknow now\ni attribute much of who i am and what\ni've done to the fact that my mother\nsupported me when i was a child\nhow did it affect you jane when you had\nthis dream in this vision but people\naround you told you it wasn't possible i\nmean the words you shared\nof people that you spoke to sounded very\ndiscouraging especially for a young\nperson and i feel today a lot of young\npeople hear different things but it's\nthe same message you're not smart enough\nyou're not good enough you're not the\nright person it's not the right time\nhow did that make you feel and and how\ndid you process that at the time\nwell you see because i had this\nsupportive family it was only my mother\ni lived with her\nand when war began i grew up in world\nwar ii and when the war began\nuh\nmum brought me and my sister to live\nwith her mother here in this house and\nit was with my mother's\nuh two sisters\nand her brother came as often as he\ncould from london he was a a surgeon he\nhad to deal with the victims of the\nblitz you know when london was bombed\nday after day after day so i was just\nsurrounded by this supportive\nfamily of extraordinary people and i\ndidn't care what the outside world said\nbut the reason i take this message\naround the world\nwhat my mother said to me\nhundreds of young people have written to\nme or said to me\njane i want to thank you because you\ntaught me because you did it\ni can do it too\nthat's that's a beautiful message and\nit's amazing to hear it from you\nespecially with your life journey and i\nmean living through\nworld war ii as well and just\njust that whole period of your life that\nyou've been through i i love that you're\nsharing that message jane i think it's\nsuch a\nbrilliant brilliant brilliant\nvoice that we all need to hear today\nand\nunfortunately it seems that the world is\nalways dealing with a new set of critics\nmore discouragement and a new set of\ncynicism or skepticism and we need\nvoices like yours that continue to break\nthem down and and help inspire us to\nthink differently i'm very grateful i\ngrew up in the war because i learned to\ntake nothing for granted you know\neverything was rationed food and clothes\nand\npetrol everything\nand you know wasting food was something\nwe wouldn't have dreamed of if something\nfell on the floor you at it anyway\nand nothing was wasted nothing\nand you didn't even take life for\ngranted because your\nyour family's friends were dying\nso growing up in the war i think helped\nto make me\nwhat i am without any question\nyeah how do how do we process that today\nwhen\nyou know my generation and obviously\nyounger generations we're not growing up\nat that time\nand sometimes people feel guilty they\nfeel well i haven't had that experience\nso i don't know how to live with that\ngratitude or not take things for granted\nor sometimes people feel well i've got\nother problems today how do you\nrecommend people today process that\ngift and opportunities that we have\ntoday\nwell i think actually we're living\nthrough a war right now\ni lived through the war with the nazi\ngermans\nthis war\nis\nagainst nature\nand i think people need to realize that\nwe're part of the natural world we're\nnot separate from it\nand we shouldn't take nature's bounty\nfor granted\nbecause in some places because of this\ncrazy idea that we can have unlimited\neconomic development on a planet with\nfinite natural resources\nalready in some places they're being\nused up faster than nature can replenish\nthem\nso\nit if young once young people understand\nthis\nthey too\ncan learn not to take nature's bounty\nfor granted\nbecause it won't go on forever unless we\ndevelop a different relationship with\nmother nature i mean jane you've\nprobably seen across the decades\nthe war as you describe it\nhas the war got better has it got worse\nwhere have you seen the\nvictims of the war what is what have\nbeen the greatest losses of this war as\nyou described it well they you know on\nthe plus side\nthere's a growing awareness and i think\nthat's been helped by the pandemic quite\nhonestly because you know people have\nwhen you know there was a brief period\nof time when industry closed down there\nwas less traffic when countries went in\nto shut down and you can imagine in some\ncities\nof\nwhere the air was polluted and there was\njust traffic and cement\nthey got a little glimpse of how things\nshould be\nlike\nlooking up and seeing stars bright in\nthe night sky instead of through a haze\nof pollution or even not at all\nand\nhearing birds they were always there but\nthey couldn't hear them because of the\ntraffic\nand\nso it's woken people up to how the world\ncould be\nand should be\nand they won't want to go back\nto that level of pollution and noise\nand so that's a sign of hope that more\nyoung people are understanding\nwe need to change this somehow somehow\nwe need to get back to a better\nrelationship with mother nature what are\nsome of the simple and practical things\nyou think that\npeople can do\nin their own homes in their own spaces\nto start that journey what would you\nrecommend to them if people are saying\nyou know i see that jane i do see that i\ndo see i prefer it when the world isn't\npolluted i do see that we are taking\nnature for granted but what do i do what\ncan i do if i do one thing how's that\ngoing to help when people have that\nmentality how do you respond to that\nwell it's basically it's more than just\none thing i don't think there's any one\nthing it's a whole plethora of things\nand\nthe main thing for young people is\nto help them understand and adults too\nevery single day\nevery single one of us makes some impact\non the planet\nand unless we're living in dire poverty\nwhich is another subject then we have a\nchoice as to what sort of impact we make\nfor example\nwhat do we buy\nask ourselves\ndid it\ndid this production harm the environment\ndid it lead to cruelty to animals\nis it cheap because of unfair wages\nuh if so\ndon't buy it and then the companies and\nit's happening\nwe'll gradually realize that consumer\npressure\nis changing the way they operate\nand\nso it's\nfor young people this program we have\nfor young people roots and shoots\nthey sit down together in their group\nand they\ntalk about the things they care about\nsome will care about the environment\nsome will care about the way we treat\nanimals some will care about what's\nhappening to people\nand they choose a project\nwork out what they can do\nroll up their sleeves get out and take\naction\nbut they share what they do because it's\nall interconnected you know i learned\nthat in the rainforest\nand so when young people\ntake action like that they actually see\nthat they're making a difference\nthey see that yes they can\nmake clean water in a stream that was\npolluted\nand then they realized well in these are\nthat because we're in 65 countries now\nin these other countries\nyoung people are cleaning up streams as\nwell\nit's not just us other people care too\nwe're part of a growing community of\nyouth\nthat wants to\ninteract with nature in a new way\nbecause of all the harm that our\nprevious generations have inflicted on\npoor old nature\ncan you give me an example jane of of a\nvery\nhuman or special moment that you've had\ninteracting with nature i'm sure there's\nso many that you've had over the years\ni'd love for you to just remember one\nfor us\nwhere\nnature felt truly alive to you where you\nexperience nature's abundance and\nconnection to us and our\ninterconnectedness because i think like\nyou said\nyou know i was i was very fortunate i\nlived as a monk for three years in india\nand we lived on a sustainable farm that\nwe managed and created and and developed\nand i got to see where food comes from\nand how water is cleaned and i got to\nsee how trees are planted and grown and\nwe made mud bricks and i got to see how\nlong it took to make one brick that\nwould be\ndried by the sand and we went through\nthat process and i went through that for\nthree years in my 20s from the age of\naround 21 to 24\nand for me seeing that firsthand i\nstarted to realize i had no clue where\nmy food came from where my shelter came\nfrom where my water or my clothes came\nfrom growing up in london where i was\nborn and raised\nand that\nthose experiences made nature feel so\nclose to me and so much a part of me\ncould you share one of your i'm sure you\nhave so many but if there's one that you\ncould remember whether it's with an\nanimal whether it's with a plant whether\nit's in a rainforest wherever it may be\noh gosh you know you're right i've got\nso many\nso many but one that i think is\nis worth sharing\nwas with a chimpanzee my very very\nspecial chimpanzee david greybeard\nwhen i got to gombe when i was 26 nobody\nhad studied wild chimpanzees nobody\nand\nthe big problem i had\nthey they were they're very conservative\nand they take one look at this peculiar\nwhite ape and run away\ni only had money for six months so you\nknow\nwould i would i be able to get their\ntrust in time\nso fortunately david greybeard for some\nreason was less afraid than the others\nand by the way it was david greybeard\nwho showed me that chimpanzees can use\nand make tools\nwhen he showed me fishing for termites\nwith\nstems and twigs\nwhich previously was thought to be\nyou know only humans were able to use\nand make tools but\nleave that aside\nhe'd just begun to allow me to follow\nhim\nand i was following him in the forest\nand i lost him at least i thought i had\nbecause he went through a tangled\nthicket of thorny vegetation easy for\nhim\nbut for me\nyou know i got tangled up with my hair\nand my sandals of\nthought i've lost it never mind i'll see\nhim another day but when i got through\nthe tangle\nthere he was sitting he was looking back\ni mean it honestly looked as though he\nwas waiting for me i can't imagine he\nwas but he might have been\nso i sat near him\nand on the ground\nwas a ripe red palm nut which chimps\nlove the fruit of the oil nut poem\nso i picked it up and held it out\ntowards him on my hand\nand he turned his face away\nso i\nperhaps cheekily put my hand a bit\ncloser\nand he turned round he looked directly\ninto my eyes\nhe reached out and he took that nut but\ndropped it\nthen very gently squeezed my fingers and\nthat is how chimpanzees reassure each\nother\nso in that moment\nthere was a connection between us\nbased on a language of gesture\nthat must have predated human spoken\nlanguage\nhe understood\nthat i my motive was good but he really\ndidn't want the knot and i understood\nthat too\nso it was a\nmoment of of real connection\nbetween me\nan absolutely wild animal who'd had no\nconnection with people before\nand i think it\ni think it changed my life that's\nincredible i thank you so much for\nsharing that that's that's probably one\nof my favorite ones\nuh and and it's such a it's such a\nbeautiful example i recently just this\nweekend i watched the octopus teacher on\nnetflix i'm not sure isn't that\nwonderful yeah it was so wonderful\nwasn't it yeah me and my friends and my\nwife sat down and watched it together\nand\nnot only was the cinematography and\nvideography stunning it was just such a\nbeautiful example of what you just\nshared that human connection with\nuh between a human and an octopus it's\nit's such a\nincredible way of seeing that come to\ni'm sure you know\nwe're going to see that more and more as\nhopefully we get more entwined with\nnature i want to speak about\nthis incredible conversation book the\nbook of hope a survival guide for trying\ntimes i don't feel there could have been\na more\ntimely\nmoment for this book\nto be coming into our lives and i would\nencourage everyone who's listening and\nwatching\nto go and order a copy of this book\nbecause it's the book we've been waiting\nfor it's the book we've been hoping for\ni think a lot of us have been looking\nfor\nnavigation during this time we've been\nlooking for direction and guidance and\nunderstanding at this time\nand i really do believe that the book of\nhope a survival guide for trying times\nis the book that's going to help us do\nthat i wanted to ask you jane when you\nlook at the history of hope if we look\nat the history of humans needing hope\nyou've lived through times when people\nwould have said there is no hope\nyet there was hope that was found and it\nchanged things again today we hear that\nrhetoric there's no hope everything's\nhopeless everything's tell us about\nfinding hope historically at difficult\ntimes and how hard it was and then the\nsame now today\nwell i think you know i go back to the\nwar again growing up in the war\nbecause there were\na period when britain\nstood alone against the might of nazi\ngermany and britain was not prepared for\nwar\nbecause chamberlain had wanted to\ncapitulate\nand you know there was churchill saying\nno we have to fight these nazis we don't\nwant to be overrun by this horrible\nrhetoric of theirs\nand\nyou know it was it was basically\nchurchill\nso there we were britain little britain\nand\nwe were so unprepared i'm i'm living in\nthe south of england the sea is just\nthere\nand it was a landing place desti\nyou know\nnazi troops were going to land quite\nnear us\ndo you know what our protection was a\nbit of scaffolding\nout in the sea\nand a bit about where that was it\nwow and you know but churchill was was\nrousing the british people saying we\nwill not be overrun we will never give\nin we will fight them on the beaches we\nwill fight them in the woods\nwe he was heard too\nas thunderous applause came out um he\nwas heard to turn aside to one of the\npeople near him and say and we'll fight\nthem with the butt ends of broken\nbottles because that's bloody well all\nwe've got\n[Laughter]\nyou have that great british sense of\nhumor so you know okay living through a\ntime when it totally seemed hopeless\nhow could we survive\nand then we had our air force\nand again churchill saying never in the\nhistory of mankind has so much been owed\nby so many to so few because these young\nmen they went out\nand they got killed they got killed they\ngot killed but they went on volunteering\nand you know when you when you grow up\nwith this sort of thing going on around\nyou\nand the way that people in london during\nthe blitz\nwhen every night they were bombed every\nnight people lost their homes and lost\ntheir lives and my uncle was working in\nthe big hospital there treating all\nthese victims of the bombing and yet the\npeople there they got together they have\nthis sense of humor and they managed to\npull together and not give in\nso what you couldn't have had a better\na better lesson for me\nin hope\nand you know in this book i talk about\nthe reasons for hope the energy of young\npeople when they know the problem and\nyou empower them to take action and the\nresilience of nature we destroy a place\nutterly but give nature time maybe some\nhelp\nit will\ncome back again\nand then\nthe\nuh this this extraordinary intellect\nthat we have we haven't used it wisely\nwe haven't always been wise at all\nwe don't deserve the title of homo\nsapiens the wise ape\nbecause we've been destroying our only\nhome\nbecause there's been a disconnect i\nthink between this clever brain\nand\nthe human heart\ni love the way we\npoetically put love and compassion into\nthe human heart i don't know why but\nanyway that's what we did\nand then finally this indomitable human\nspirit that won't give in\nand so often succeeds how can you not\nhave hope\nyeah thank you so much i can't wait to\ndive into each of those uh as we go\nthrough the interview i wanted to ask\nyou jen about you know so many people\nhave lost\ntheir\nhope during the pandemic\nand the pandemic\nbroke people down it it shattered their\nresilience\nhow do you think people will be able to\nbring back that hope that they lost\nduring the pandemic how do how do we do\nthat\nhow we do it i think you know one of the\nbig problems is that the media gives so\nmuch attention\nto everything negative and yeah they\nhave to we we need to know\nbut if you think during the pandemic of\nthe stories of courage and bravery and\nself-sacrifice\npeople losing their lives to treat sick\npeople\nyou know this gives you such a feeling\nof\nof how amazing humans actually are\nand that in itself\nis enough to give people hope but then\nwhen you come to all the people who've\nlost their jobs living in poverty\nthe only way to give them hope is to\nhelp them\ni mean\nif you\nare living\nwhere every day you went out to work and\nyou got just enough money to feed\nyourself and your family\nunfair wages meant you could never save\nso those people\nit's very hard to see how they'll regain\nhope unless we help them\non the other hand\nthere are people in those situations who\nsomehow manage to rise above it\nand they just get this thing\ni'm not going to give in i will find a\nway to make a living i will do something\neven if it's something menial just to\nget me through this\njust to enable me to feed my family\nand share those stories it is possible\nnot easy but it is possible because of\nthis indomitable human spirit\nabsolutely and how do you\nreally define hope and what would you\nsay is the difference between hope and\nbelief\ni think that's a really important you\nknow conversation to have\nbecause i think often we confuse that so\nhow do you define hope and what's the\ndifference between hope and belief\nwell hope you know some people feel it's\nvery passive well i'm i'm okay i hope\nit's going to be okay and they don't do\nanything to me\nhope is about action\ni hope\nthat i can make a difference\nbut i won't make a difference unless i\ntake action that i think is a to me\nwhat hope is all about\nand the tragedy is that if we lose hope\nthen we sink into apathy because if you\ndon't think your actions are going to\nmake a difference even a small\ndifference\nwhy bother why do anything\njust give up eat drink and be merry for\ntomorrow we die\nif you're in a position to buy the food\nand the drink to be merry\nbut um\nyou know so\nthat to me hope is all about taking\naction\nand faith\nwell faith\nyou know i i got very very angry a\nlittle while ago\nwith richard dawkins\nwho i don't know if you know his name\nbut he is a he's a committed atheist\nand he actually spent a lot of money\nhiring advertisements on the london\ndouble decker red buses\nsaying if you believe in god you're\nstupid or something like that\nnow if you think\nof somebody who's a refugee\nwho's fled by either climate change\nor\nor war conflict\nand sometimes they arrive\nand i'm saying now england but it could\nbe anywhere\nand they've lost their family they've\nlost everything\nbut they've got a faith they believe in\ngod that god will put things right\nand so\npeople talk about blind faith\nbut blind faith can give you hope\nbecause\nyou know you believe in god god's going\nto make things right\nthat gives you hope\ngod will make things right\nbut still you've got to do your part\nand i think the bible i mean i grew up\nas a christian but it could be the quran\nit could be anything\nbut you know the bible is full of\nmessages about about hope and taking\naction\nand not just sitting back and letting\nthe world roll by you that's a that's a\nbeautiful uh description that's a it's a\nwonderful way of breaking down the words\nfor us and i love how you said that hope\nis full of action and you know making a\nchange and and trying to be a part of\nthe solution and you talk about hope as\na survival trait which i thought was\nreally interesting and and i'm also\nstarting to see jane i i would love to\nget your thoughts on this i also see\nhope as a habit\ni see it as something we have to\npractice is something we have to develop\nis something that\nthe more you think of it the more you\nbuild it into your routine and life the\nmore real it becomes because it's\nsomething that has to be practiced and\nlived on a daily basis it's not just an\nidea or something that happens mentally\nwhat would you think about that if you\nthink of hope as a habit as well as a\nsurvival trait\nwell i guess you could say it's a habit\nbut i mean the thing is once you\nonce you\nstart taking i mean all these people who\nwho\nbecome\ntotally depressed\num sometimes even suicidal because they\nlook around at the problems of the world\nand my goodness it's terrible i mean not\nyou cannot not be depressed if you look\naround at the problems of the world\nthat's why\nyou know the message is\ndon't think globally act locally act\nlocally first see that you can make a\ndifference\nand when you see that you make a\ndifference you want to do more\nand so\ntaking that first step\ngives you hope that your actions do make\na difference and then you want to do\nmore and as you do more it's like a\nfeedback loop\nand you inspire others\nto join you\nand as you see others making a\ndifference that increases your hope\nand so it it spirals like that and\nthat's what's happening with the young\npeople in our roots and shoots program i\nthink\nyeah i i would love to have an\nexperience with the roots and shoots\nprogram it sounds so\nexciting and inspiring i think it would\nbe wonderful to\nget to be involved and get to be a part\nof it to really see it firsthand i i\nthink there's such a\njoy that comes from actually being\ninvolved and and you know get getting\nyour hands dirty at those times and\nseeing it for yourself so i'm wondering\njen you know obviously you have such a\nabundant optimism you have such a\ngreat\nstrength in you and resilience from\neverything you've been and i'm wondering\nwas there ever a time\nwhen someone or something and i loved\nwhat you said earlier that someone made\nyou angry and i'm thinking was there\never a time where\nsomething that happened in the world or\nsomeone\nor something in nature made you lose\nhope or being close to losing hope and i\nwant to know how you got it back because\ni feel like a lot of people are on that\ncusp of they're just about to lose hope\nand they just need to grab hold of it\nagain you know i i've\nexperienced\ndeep\ndepression and\nyou know for example\ni spent time in a in a small wooded area\nquite close to here and heard the birds\ni don't know why i was there but i was\nand two years later it was yet another\nshopping mall\ni was angry but first of all\ni was really depressed i was sad i sat\nthere and\nfelt like crying\nbut then that sadness turned to anger\nhow dare they do that\nwell i can't save this place now\nbut there are other places like this\nthat i can try to save or inspire people\nliving there\nencourage them to do what they can to\nsave it before it's too late\nso i don't know it's the way i'm made\nyou know i'm very obstinate\nand like one of these dogs you know\nthese dolls with\nwith loaded\nbases and you knock them over and they\njump up\nthat's how i am\nthey're like one of them i don't know\nwhat you call them but i'm like one of\nthe adults i will not be\npushed down by anyone i will bounce up\nbut it's just the way i'm made\nyeah i i love that i i think that's\nbeautiful and i think\ni do i do believe that's the only way we\ncan learn to live we need we all need to\nlearn to be that way because\nit's you know as we know life's going to\nkeep knocking us down and we have to get\nback up and we need that resilience we\nneed that strength so i i love that you\nknow the book mentions\nuh four components for hope and making\nit sustainable and it's goals pathways\nconfidence\nand support\nand i i wanted to hear about a few of\nthem that you see\nuh and you know you said and and the\nconversation you were having the\nresearchers call it the hope cycle\nwhat kind of goals should we have at\nthis time what do you think what goals\ndo you feel of realistic but also\nambitious enough for us to have at this\ntime you can't be passionate about\neverything\nbut there's enough of us that's one of\nthe only benefit i can see in the number\nof people on the planet there's enough\npeople to tackle all the different\nproblems you know because nobody can\ntackle everything\nso\nwith our groups of roots in tutes for\nexample you find every group there are\nsome kids who are passionate about\nhelping animals someone to help people\nsomeone to help the environment\nand so\nif you\nchoose something you're really\npassionate about\nand you see that you can make a\ndifference\nyou know that leads to this whole\nfeedback system\nof hope\nso\ni don't quite know what else i can say\nabout it no that's a beautiful example\nno i love that i thank you so much for\nsharing that again i i think that's just\na great reminder of\nrecognizing that you don't have to\nchange everything and you can't change\neverything but there may be your passion\nis going to bring you\ntowards a particular area of impact or a\npain that you see is going to bring you\nto a particular area of impact often\nit's what inspires us and sometimes is\nwhat hurts us that makes us want to take\naction and so i i think that's a\nbeautiful answer and i just wanted to\nremind people of that sometimes as we\nwere discussing so many people will be\nthinking i'm so overwhelmed there's so\nmany things that the world needs help\nwith there's you know nature there's\nanimals there's cancer there's and so\nknowing that people can just start with\nwhat is\ndeeply important to them yes that's the\nway to start because then that's why\nroots chutes is working so well because\nthe kids\nthey're passionate about what they do\nbecause they chose it we don't tell them\nwhat to do\nand so a roots and shoots group will\nchoose different projects whether\nthey're in in a city or rural area rich\nor poor whether they're in\nindia pakistan\nwhether they're in africa or florida or\nnew york they're going to choose the\nprojects\nthat that are important to them where\nthey live\nand\nso i think it's because it's a\nit's a not a top-down but a bottom-up\nprogram that it's spreading around the\nworld\nyes yes truly truly making a difference\nand the thing is with these three\nprojects animals people environment that\nevery group must choose between them\nthey all share\nthe result of their projects\nand therefore begin to understand how\neverything is interrelated\nyou know i learned that in the\nrainforest every species has a role to\nplay in this beautiful tapestry of life\nand i see it\nas when one species disappears from an\necosystem it's like pulling a thread\nfrom that beautiful tapestry\nand as enough threads are pulled that\necosystem that that tapestry will hang\nin tatters and the ecosystem will\ncollapse\noh that's such a uh\na great metaphor and analogy for us to\nvisually i could visualize that as you\nwere describing it\nand\none of the things that i observed in\nnature that i love so much is that every\npart of nature is always serving\nso the trees are providing shade they're\nproviding fruits and flowers the\nwater is moving and providing the sun is\nproviding heat and warmth and light and\nevery aspect of nature is always in\nservice\nto others\nand it seems that the only part of\nnature that is not in service is often\nus as humans and people\nwhere we're trying to serve ourselves\nversus serve and give and provide and\nshare\nand you talk about this\nbeautiful point about you know the\nreasons for hope and one of them you\ngive is the human intellect\nand we've all heard that it's our minds\nthat separate us from animals but in\nyour book you mentioned that great apes\ncan learn 400 or more words of american\nsign language uh work out complex\nproblems on a\ncomputer\nand like some animals you mentioned i\nthink including i think it's pigs i love\npainting and drawing\nand you know you mentioned the octopus\nyes exactly exactly\nand so if animals\nare smarter than most people give them\ncredit for what is it truly that sets us\napart when you use the human intellect\nas a reason for hope well the human\nintellect differs from that of all other\nanimals chimpanzees and everybody else\nto the lengths to which it's gone like\nthere's no animal no matter how\nintelligent on the planet today\nthat could design a rocket that goes up\nto mars\nlaunches a little\nrobot that goes around taking\nphotographs that is out of the category\nout of the league\nof animal intellect i mean the way we're\ntalking now is an example of human\nintellect this intellect the zooms and\nthe\nthe\npodcasts and all the things that we do\nit's just amazing i believe\nthat that was at least in part triggered\nby the fact that at some point in our\nevolution\nwe developed this way of communicating\nas we are now with words\nso with words\nyou and i can send out a message\nto people and teach them something they\nnever thought of before\nwe can teach our children\nabout things going on in other countries\nchimpanzees can't do that their children\nlearn by observing\nbut we can use words\nand we can bring people together to have\ndiscussions to try and solve problems\npeople with different outlooks on life\ndifferent different jobs different\nskills\nso that's the difference and this is why\nit's so bizarre\nthat we're destroying our only home we\ndon't want to live on mars we know that\nnow\nand i think it's a disconnect between\nthis clever clever brain\nand as i said before the human heart\nlove and compassion\nand honestly\ni truly truly believe it's only when\nhead and heart work in harmony that we\ncan achieve our true human potential\nwhich some people have\nyes i i think that i that was so\nwonderfully shared i\ni really believe that our\nintellect and our intention have been\ndisconnected\nand so the intellect is not being guided\nby or directed by intention\nit's being free\nto do whatever it needs to\nto to feel\nsense gratified and to feel self\nuh you know\nself-obsession almost freedom to that\npoint\nand\nthe the love and compassion you're\nspeaking about is such an intentionality\nwith how we use this intellect that\nwe've been gifted with yeah yeah i mean\nit was mahatma gandhi who said the\nplanet can produce for human need but\nnot human greed yeah and\nyou know we we need a new definition of\nsuccess because at the moment if you\ntalk to most kids\nwhat's a successful person oh somebody\nwho's making a lot of money\nor maybe somebody who's got a lot of\npower\nand that's the way we think about\nsuccess\nto me\nsuccess is about\nhaving enough that you can feed yourself\nin your family you can perhaps go for a\nnice holiday\nthat you can enjoy spending time in\nnature\nand and with your family\nand\npeople just\nyou know they did an experiment\nwhere they followed different immigrant\nfamilies who all arrived the same\nwith a wife\nand a kid\nand nothing\nand part of the group\nthey managed to get jobs\nand they managed to\nfind somewhere to live and then they\nupgraded it they got a little house they\ncould send their kids to school\nand there's this king of bhutan's\nhappiness index and as this happened\nwhatever that index is went up\nthe next group\nthey\nin the same way started to improve their\nlives but when they got to that level\nwhere the first group stopped\nthey went on they wanted more they\nwanted more money they wanted more power\nmore wealth more houses\nand they succeeded but the happiness\nlevel dropped i i love that experiment\nbut is it true a lot of very wealthy\npeople aren't happy people\nabsolutely yeah and i think\nwhen\ni i love that you shared that study and\ni've also found that when\nsomeone's intention for more is so that\nthey can do more service\nuh whether it be financial whether it be\nuh growth in any area of life it becomes\nactually very beautiful we see so many\nso much incredible work happening in the\nwith the world when people use their\nplatforms for a higher purpose\nas you've seen like yeah people who have\nachieved great things and wonderful\nthings and they're using that power or\nthat influence or that money to to have\na change in people's lives and and for\nthe environment as opposed to themselves\nonly as you rightly said and i think\nabout that as something that's so so\nneeded as well to encourage young people\nto say hey if you want to go and be\nsuccessful and you want to go and do\nthis do it but do it in an intentional\nway to use it as a way to serve do it\nwith that in mind that you don't want to\nharm the environment and you want to\nimprove the lives for people and animals\nand i think if we could train people to\nnot\nshy away from success but like you said\nredefine success and use\nsuccess for something greater than\nsuccess itself then that to me feels\nlike a hopeful environment and world to\nlive in it's quite true you know when\ni'm giving lectures\ni always say that\nwe all need money to live\nit goes wrong unless we live for money\nunless\nunless we live for money\nin order to help\nmake the world a better place\nand then i always make everybody laugh\nbecause i pause and i say like giving\nsome money to the jane goodall institute\n[Laughter]\nthat's brilliant i love that that is so\ngood that is such a beautiful statement\nthough could you repeat the full\nstatement for us again because it was so\nperfect and i was taking it in that i i\nwant everyone else to hear it i want\neveryone else to hear it again\nokay so\ni tell people that you know we all need\nmoney to live\nand it tends to go wrong when we live\nfor money\nunless we live for money\nin order to use that money to make the\nworld better\nfor animals people environment\nlike giving some funds to the jane\ngoodall institute\ni was holding back my laughter because i\nknew it was coming i love that that's\nthat's brilliant but it's such a it's\nsuch a profound statement it is it is\nsuch a wonderful way and i think\nthat that idea of engaging whatever\ngifts we have whatever wonderful\nopportunities we've been given to engage\nthem back into the service we had this\nbeautiful practice\njane that i think i think you'd\nappreciate from what you just said\nuh when we would um\nin in india it's common to bathe in holy\nrivers uh whether it's the the ganges\nthe yamuna the the kaveri many holy\nrivers and whenever we were as monks\nbathed in these rivers the practice\nwould be that we would first scoop out\nwater\ninto our hands\nas much as we could have and then we\nwould pour it back into the river\nand the purpose of this exercise was to\nshow us\nthat whatever we were doing we were just\nscooping from the source and giving back\nto the source\nand the idea that any gifts you have\nanything that you hold in your life you\nwant to engage it back into the\nenvironment so we take from the\nenvironment but then we give it back\nand the amount we take can never be as\nmuch as the environment gives to us and\noffers to us\nand uh it was it was just always a\nbeautiful ritual that that made me\nremember that you're only here to serve\nyou're only a steward you're you're only\nuh you're only a uh housekeeper you know\nyou're not a\nit's it's not a it's not your home uh in\nthat sense it's it's your home but yeah\nit's not your you're not the owner it's\nyour home but you're not the owner\nthat's right and that's why that's why\nyou must feel so sad about the way some\nof these holy rivers have been polluted\nand damned\nabsolutely absolutely\nit's heartbreaking isn't it it is it's\nreally painful to watch and\nyou know i've been trying in my own way\nwith the with the organizations i work\nwith to try and\nuh be a part of that but yeah it's it's\nbecoming very difficult and like you\nsaid though we don't lose hope because\nwe may not be able to impact this one\nplace but there's another place where\nthat's happening and i i love that you\nsaid that i think that's such a we often\nget so attached\nto who we help and how we help\nand and i think\nreal love and real compassion\nis i want to help anyone who needs it\nand everyone who needs it i'm able to\ni'm able to see that even though this is\nwhat i see as valuable\nif i can't impact that i can i can\ncreate some value over here i think\nthat's a beautiful reminder and in case\nyou didn't know we have just started\num a jane goodall institute in india\nwhich is registered as an ngo\nwith roots insurance spreading all over\nindia wow and you know\nhundreds of young people wanting to help\nin this fight to to restore rivers and\nthings like that i just thought you\nmight like to know that yeah i am i i\nlove hearing that i think on my next\nvisit there as well i'd i'd love to\nexperience that sounds sounds amazing\nthe second reason you give for hope now\nand i love these reasons i think they\nwere so powerful is the resilience of\nnature\nand one in particular one story really\nstands out and i'd love for you to share\nit with my community today\nabout the survivor tree if you were uh\nhappy enough to share that i think it\nwould be wonderful for them to hear i\nhappened to be in new york\nwhen\nthe suicide bombers flew into the twin\ntowers\nand it was terrible it was terrible\nbeing there you know\neverything went quiet and you could only\nhear police cars and ambulance sirens\nand\nit was you know this total devastation\nand it was horrible it was horrible well\nit turned out that when they were\nclearing the rubble it was about two\nweeks after the towers fell\nthis um\nyoung woman actually\nshe saw the remains of a tree\non a truck\nand i don't know how she persuaded the\ntruck driver but anyway she said but\nthis tree isn't dead\noh he was going to put it on a on a\ndumpster\nand destroy it\nso anyway she managed to get the tree\nto a botanical garden and they know it\nshouldn't notice it all that was left\nwas one big root\nand\none trunk\nwith one branch that's all that was left\nbut they nurtured it\nnurtured it nurtured it\nplanted it back on the site where the\ntowers fell\nand now it's a calorie pear\nnot a pear tree but a calorie pair\nand in the spring it's big now it has\nthese beautiful blossoms\nand so i was i had a group of my young\nroots and shoots people around on\ninternational peace day\nand\nthe tree was shedding its leaves because\nit was autumn\nand so when i looked up into these\nbranches we looked past this great black\nfisher\nwhich is you know where the tree\namazingly mended itself\nand there was the nest of a bird\nthat obviously had fledged and flown and\nthat was like the tree itself\nhas survived the most horrendous attack\nand it's put out leaves and it's\nbeautiful\nand it's nurtured\nanother life form\nwhere the babies have fledged and flown\nout into the world it i just\nit was so wonderful\nyeah\nabsolutely what a wonderful story i'm so\nglad you shared that with us thank you\nand\nyou know to\nto to hear about such devastation\nyou know you would you could never\nimagine that something could recover\nfrom that but it did with some nurturing\nwith some love with some attention\nand the third and fourth reason you\nshare with us which we've spoken about a\nlot today and i would love for everyone\nto get the book to read more about one\nand two but three and four as well uh\nthree is all about empowering young\npeople and four is about that human\nspirit so anyone who's listening and\nwatching right now and you're loving\nthese stories and these examples and\nyou're being filled with hope i really\nhope everyone who's listening and\nwatching your your body your mind your\nsoul your heart are being filled with\nhope and i promise you if you read this\nbook\nyou will\nimmerse yourself in hope and i think\nhope needs to be an immersion it needs\nto be a\nabsorption in hope for us to really feel\nits benefits just like this tree receive\nsuch care and attention you need that\ncare and attention uh and we need to\ngive that care and attention to\nourselves in the last part of the book\nyou talk about becoming a messenger\nof hope\nand\ni think often when we become messages of\nhope people can say oh you know stop\nbeing so positive and you know you're\njust always trying to find a silver\nlining and\nthere could be a lot of skepticism and\ncynicism around hope unfortunately\nbecause we've created a world that\namplifies negativity as you said earlier\nwith what we see on tv in the news\nif someone's listening and they're like\njane i want to become a messenger of\nhope what's something that they could do\ntoday for themselves or practically jane\nthat you think will help them continue\nthat desire to become a messenger and\nambassador of hope\nyou know the first thing is to\nreally think\nin your mind\nwhat do i really care about\nokay i really care about the way stray\ndogs are treated\num some countries stones are thrown at\nthem\ni want to help what can i do\nand then you find that you can volunteer\nin a shelter or you can adopt a little\npuppy or something like that\nand\nthat first step\ngives you a feeling of what it's like to\nbe hopeful because you've made a\ndifference\nit's going to be different for everybody\nand all you need to be a messenger of\nhope is to feel hopeful\nand to be able to tell stories stories\nit's no good talking statistics and all\nthat kind of stuff because nobody\nremembers\nbut\nbut stories\nlike the ones that you asked me to share\npeople even if they get the details\nwrong they remember the message\nand so i think messengers of hope need\nto be storytellers\nthey need to have experience the joy of\ndoing something and seeing that you've\nmade a difference and the even greater\njoy of seeing that you've inspired\nothers\nto get that same feeling by taking\naction and making a difference yes\nyes absolutely i love that answer and i\ncouldn't agree with you more stories\ndefine us and they define how we feel\nand they're the stories that resonate\nwith our heart and statistics again like\nyou said statistics talk to our head but\nstories\ndeal with our hearts so as you said the\nhead and heart alignment i think that's\na a beautiful reminder for all of our\nmessengers of hope jane you've been so\ngenerous and kind and wonderful with\nyour time i couldn't encourage people\nmore to go and grab a copy of the book\nwe'll have the link in all of the\ncaptions so you can order it\nif today's conversation has touched you\ni promise you the conversation in the\nbook will\ntruly truly help you and it will help\nyou become a hopeful messenger and help\nyou with your children and make them\nhopeful messengers and people around you\nin the world and we need more hope in\nthe world it's it's the thing that we\nneed most of right now\nbut jaina we end every episode with\na final five which are a fast five where\nyou have to answer every question\nuh in one word to one sentence maximum\nso we're about to do that but before we\ndo that i just thought of something\nactually\ni was asked\ncbs is doing a prime time show called\nthe activist and i was asked to be a\nguest judge the other day and the three\nareas they chose are education\nuh healthcare\nand the environment and they're\nencouraging people to come up with ideas\nand they're going to be funding them and\nuh\ni believe the final meeting is with\nleonardo dicaprio who's going to be\nreally encouraging the ideas to move\nforward i wanted to ask you when you\nthink when you see all these things\nhappening today\nin the mainstream shows people such as\nleonardo dicaprio being so\nuh forward thinking about the\nenvironment does that give you hope how\ndo you feel about those aspects outside\nwhere people are taking action\nyeah it's great i mean of course it\ngives you hope because people like\nleonardo dicaprio angelina jolie dave\nmatthews\npeople listen to them and they're people\ni probably couldn't reach\nso\nyou know the fact that they're out there\nand inspiring people and giving them\nhope and of course it\nre reinforces my own hope that we are\ngetting there that together we can make\na difference and together we will\nyeah that's beautiful i love that okay\nwe're gonna move into the final five one\nword to one sentence maximum for each of\nthese jane are you ready for your fast\nfive\nwell i'm no good at this but go on\nyou can end up making a fool of me\nthat's fine i don't know he made a fool\noff not at all not at all that is not my\nintention okay so\nthe first question is\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nthe best advice i've ever received was\nfrom my mother\nwhen she said if you really want to do\nsomething work hard take advantage of\nopportunity and don't give up\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\nyou can't make a difference so don't\nbother\ngreat answer\nokay uh question number three what's the\nfirst thing you do in the morning and\nthe last thing you do at night\ntry and get out of bed to face another\nday of podcasts and\n[Laughter]\nwebinars and\nthose things the last thing i do\nwatch some absolutely mindless and\nnon-non-intellectual\nsomething on tv or an audio book or\nsomething like that take my mind away\nfrom all the horror of the day\ni love that question number four what's\nthe biggest lesson you've learned in the\nlast 12 months patience\nwonderful and fifth and final question\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\nthe law that is shared by every single\nmajor religion\ndo unto others as you would have them do\nto you\nbeautiful thank you so much everyone the\nbook of hope\nuh jengar we are so grateful for your\ntime and energy i can't wait to share\nthis with millions
