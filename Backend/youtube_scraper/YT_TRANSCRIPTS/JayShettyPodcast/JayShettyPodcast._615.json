you for\nbeing here i love you i gotta like oh\nyes there we go let's do both i don't\nknow\ni can't believe this is your first time\nhere\nwell first of all thank you because\nyou've invited me and um\ni just knew i wanted to wait\nuntil i had something truly\nextraordinary\nto talk to you about that i do that just\nshows how\nmodest you are because you always have\nsomething extraordinary to talk about\nbut i too am happy today we're talking\nabout this incredible new book the high\nfive habit take control of your life\nwith one simple habit this is a book\nthat i want everyone who's listening\nright now to go and order i know we\nhaven't even started the conversation\nyet but i'm so confident in what i've\nread from the book my conversations with\nmel not just online but offline\nand\nmel i know you have an interesting story\nabout how this relates to me somehow\nwhich you mentioned to me i do and i've\nbeen holding back since you walked in\nthe room i was like save it for the\npodcast save it for the podcast can you\nreveal\nmy connection with the high five habit i\nsure can okay um so\nwhen i was coming on it dawned on me\nwhat an incredibly deep and profound\nconnection\nthat you and i share around what we're\nabout to talk about now like everybody\non the planet\ni devoured your book i literally\ndog-eared it i highlighted it and on\npage seven\nthere is a story\nthat you tell that is a beautiful\nmetaphor\nthat illustrates the external influences\nthat obscure our true selves\nyou know what story i'm talking about i\ndo i i believe it's uh is it dust or is\nit me yes is that the about the mirror\nand the dust yes yes and so the story is\nall about this metaphor of up in this\nattic of the ashram there's a mirror\nwith a thick layer of dust\nand when you look at a mirror that's\naccumulated a thick layer of dust\nyou can't truly see\nyourself your soul your spirit\nand the dust comes from your life\nit's not you\ni'm gonna get like super emotional\nalready\nbecause the high five habit is how you\nwipe the dust away i know and when i was\nreading that for anyone who's not\nwatching right now mel is\non the verge of of tears\nbut if you're listening\nwhen i opened up the high five habit and\nyou tell that story for you yeah of\nyou're looking in the mirror as we all\ndo in the morning when we wake up to\nbrush our teeth\nand you're criticizing yourself\nyou're poking holes in your appearance\nin how you wish you worked out more how\nyou've got such a long to-do list today\nhow you have no energy how you'd rather\ncurl up and watch tv and do nothing for\nthe rest of the day and that is an\nexperience that we all have had\nmore than we even think like we've had\nthat daily a lot of us have had that for\nmonths and even years\nand so it's amazing how that story also\nstarts looking in the mirror yes tell us\nabout\nwhat has changed about how you look in\nthe mirror today with the high five\nhabit\nso i have been practicing this habit for\na little over a year\nand it all began in april of 2020 and\nthis is not something that i was like\nokay i got to write a book it's got to\nhave a five in it it's going to be five\nyears since i've written a book thank\nyou dyslexia and adhd what am i going to\nwrite about what am i that's not how\nthis happened\nthe high five habit\nsaved me\nit was a ladder that helped me climb out\nof a hole i had fallen into emotionally\nphysically spiritually and\na year later\nafter practicing what is going to sound\nlike a weird\nstupid thing\nwhich you will resist and jay you and i\nare going to unpack this because it's\nsad why everybody resists it\nit has to do with the dust that's\naccumulated\nand i will tell you after a year\nof practicing this\ni don't even see\na face or a body i see a soul\ni don't even have to high-five myself i\nstill do because it feels good and we're\ngonna explain the science yes that is\nbananas about why this actually works\nfor everybody who tries it\nbecause this is not\nsomething that's new\nyou are tapping into programming that's\nalready in your mind and body and now\ndirecting it back at yourself it's\nincredible\ni\ndon't ever criticize myself\ni don't ever see what's wrong\ni see a human being who's trying\nwho deserves love and respect and i know\nthat it's my job to give it to her\nyou know the five-second rule which i\ncreated i don't know over a decade ago\nthat's gone on to help me change my\nwhole life it's a little starting ritual\nand a brain hack that you can use to\nhelp yourself take the actions and\nchange the thoughts that change your\nlife\nit helped me be more productive it\nhelped me get stuff done\nthe high five habit has changed who i am\nit has deleted a lifetime of criticism\nand negativity from my mind and it has\nreprogrammed the soundtrack to be\nsomebody that's supportive and a\ncheerleader it's extraordinary\nthat's so beautiful to hear because\ni think so often\nwe like to oscillate from one extreme to\nanother\nso people start by criticizing\nthemselves\nand then sometimes we've heard in the\ntoxic positivity movement of well just\ntell yourself you're amazing and tell\nyourself you're incredible and and to me\nthat doesn't always work either because\nwe it does struggle to say it with\nfeeling and meaning and belief but what\ni love about what you're sharing with\nthe high five habit\nis that it's actually looking at no\nyou're trying let me be supportive let\nme be encouraging let me use my words to\nnotice that which i want to grow and\nwork on\nbut i'm not creating an artificial\nillusion of either criticism or\nperfection\nboth of which are unreal well and here's\nthe extraordinary thing\nyou don't have to say a word\nyou don't have to say a word like one of\nthe reasons why mantras don't work for\nso many people is you choose something\nyou don't believe\nand so as you stand before a mirror or\nyou say it to yourself after a lifetime\nof beating yourself up your brain's like\nyep no we don't believe that because\nyou've told me the other opposite story\nfor so long i'm not going to buy it now\nyou know i got to tell you like how this\nall went down because it's in the kind\nof unfolding of the story\nthat there's layer after layer after\nlayer\nso\nyou know the backdrop of this is that um\nit was you know i think we all have that\nmoment when we knew\nthat kovid was going to change your life\nforever\nwhen was that moment for you i was one\nof the optimistic ones when it first\nhappened i was like ah the world's gonna\ndeal with this in like a month or maybe\nthree months and so i think it was about\nthree months in where i was like okay i\nhave no idea how this is going and this\nis not what i expected so i'd say about\nthree months in i'd say probably around\nthat\njune time june 2020. got it yeah well\nfor me it happened on a wednesday in\nmarch of 2020\nyeah early because i was taping my\ndaytime talk show at cbs broadcast\ncenter and they walked in and said they\nhad found it in the building and within\nfive minutes we had to evacuate show\ncancelled i'm fired from my dream job\ni'm driving home uh to boston\nmassachusetts which is where my husband\nand i have raised our kids i see new\nyork city disappearing in the skyline\nphone rings it's our daughter who's\nstudying abroad for college and they're\nshutting down the borders then the other\ndaughter they're closing down the\nuniversity here in california we all get\nhome and speech after speech after\nspeech gets cancelled and then a\npublisher i'd been working with on a\ntotally different book concept cancels\nthat contract and now i've got to give\nmoney back that i've already spent\nthere's no ppp loans yet i have no idea\nhow i'm going to make payroll my kids\nare in a complete state of crisis and\nbreakdown because their lives are now\njust imploding before their eyes\ni'm worried about the world i'm worried\nabout frontline workers and i feel\nthe weight of the world on my shoulders\nand i wake up one morning in april\nand it's a very familiar feeling this is\nnot a book about the pandemic this is a\nbook about\nhow you pick yourself up when you feel\nlike you just don't know how to face\nyour life\nso i woke up that morning and i felt\ndefeated i felt overwhelmed i felt\nexhausted i used the five second rule\nfive four three two one to get out of\nbed i make the bed so i don't crawl back\ninto it\nand i go to the bathroom\nand i'm standing there in the bathroom\nand i'm brushing my teeth and as i'm\nbrushing my teeth i catch a glimpse of\nmyself in the mirror\nand i think\noh my god you look like hell\nand then my mind started to criticize\nthe woman in the mirror the dark circles\nunder her eyes the saggy neck one breast\nis hanging lower than the other just the\nbeat down begins and then of course once\nyou go there you teach this your mind is\njust going to keep on taking you down\nand so it became why did you get up so\nlate and you got a zoom call in eight\nminutes and you haven't even walked the\ndog and you know what's interesting\nabout this moment jay\nif you had walked in the bathroom in\nthat moment i would have been able to\nturn on a dime\ni would have said jay\ni know\nit's a lot\nyou don't deserve this\nbut if anybody can handle this you can i\ni know you can i would have lifted you\nup like just it would have been it for\neffortless\nbut standing there alone in my underwear\nin my own bathroom\ni i couldn't think of anything to say\nand in fact here's the thing i don't\nthink i would have believed it because\nof what you just said it didn't match\nhow i was feeling\nnow i don't know what came over me\nbecause it sounds ridiculous i've never\ndone this before\nbut i suddenly found myself\nraising my hand and high-fiving that\nwoman i saw in the mirror because she\nneeded it\nand here's the thing it's not like\nlightning struck right you know it's not\nlike that heaven's parted and angels are\nlike oh\nlife is right that's not what happened\nthe dogs still needed to be walked i\nstill had endless things i was still\nworried but something in me shifted it\nwas weird\nand it was kind of this thing because i\nthought a lot about this moment it's\nlike my shoulders dropped and my chin\nlifted and i didn't even like say\nanything positive it's like there was\nthis energy flip and the energy felt a\nlittle bit more\nnot very jetty more kind of mel robbins\noh come on get out there stop\ncomplaining get yourself come on you can\ndo this like it was sort of that sort of\nall right here we go but it was the\nsecond morning\nthe second morning\nis when\neverything changed\ni wake up same problems same overwhelm\nexhausted defeated\ntired five four three two one i get out\nof bed i make the bed i start walking to\nthe bathroom\nand jay\ni noticed that i was feeling something\ni had never felt\nin my entire\nlife\nand it was this\nyou know when you're about to meet a\nfriend somebody you really like at a\ncafe\nyou're gonna go have a cup of tea\nwhat do you feel right before you walk\nin the door\nexcitement enthusiasm energy joy\nuh\npositive nervousness like that that kind\nof like uh\nbutterflies even in a positive sense\nyeah so at this moment i was 51 years\nold\nin 51 years of being alive i don't ever\nremember feeling\nthat feeling about seeing myself wow\nfor the first time in my life i had this\nsensation that i was excited\nto see the human being mel robbins\nnow i've been excited to see an outfit\nor excited to see a haircut\ni have never been excited to see the\nperson\nand so i round the corner and this\nsense of how profound this is is hitting\nme\nand i'm standing there\nbrushing my teeth and i realize\nsomething really wild\nthere are always two of you in the\nbathroom together\nthere's you\nand there is a human being in the mirror\na person who needs you\na person who has been waiting for you to\nwake up and realize they are there\nand they need you to see them and to\nhear them and to love them and to\nsupport them\nand so what's interesting because you\nbrought up morning routines right is\nthat we all talk about the importance of\nsetting our day up because it's how it\nends up we talk about gratitude and\nmeditation and we know the extraordinary\nbenefits of it\nbut i don't think anybody has truly\namplified the fact that there is this\ndirty habit that we all have\nevery single morning that is a part of\nyour morning routine unless you have\nweeded this out\nand it is a habit of either ignoring\nyourself\nor\nbeating the heck out of yourself\nevery single morning in the mirror i\nmean 91 of women don't like how they\nlook 50 of us can't even look at\nourselves in the mirror that's what i\nwas about to say that eye contact i\nthink there's\nsuch a struggle what you just rightly\nsaid it's not just that we beat\nourselves up or criticized we can't even\nlook at ourselves\nhow how does how does the high five\nhabit help us get that oh it's\nincredible yeah it's absolutely gonna\nmove let's let's talk about the habits\nso then we can break it down yeah yeah\nlet's because i know part of it is\npracticing in the bathroom yes yes part\nof it is looking nervous so let's break\nit down okay so here's where you're\ngonna feel when you do it it's very\nsimple you're gonna look at yourself in\nthe mirror and you're gonna leverage\nsome research out of harvard we'll talk\nabout that too yeah okay dive into that\nso you're basically just gonna look at\nyourself in the mirror and you're gonna\nask yourself what does that human being\nneed for me today\nhow can i show up for him or who are\nthey how do i do that today kindness do\ni need to be more courageous or bold you\nkind of set this intention\nfor yourself\nand then you're simply going to raise\nyour hand and you're going to high-five\nyourself\nnow a couple things i want you to expect\nnumber one it will feel weird period it\nfeels weird for everybody because it is\nthe opposite of what you're doing right\nnow and so your brain is going to reject\nit as odd\nnumber two\nyou're either going to have one of two\nreactions that's it\nthere's no middle ground you will either\nhave a very profound positive experience\nwhere you're going to laugh\nprobably because it kind of feels good\nand it's kind of silly\nor you're going to burst into tears in a\npositive way\nbecause it's a release that you have\nfinally woken up and started supporting\nyourself you just got it and that's\nwhere the tears come from\nbut more likely although maybe not for\nyou because you're a fan of this podcast\nbut more likely you will feel\nresistance and the resistance is the\ndust on the mirror\nevery single morning jay\nwe bring with us our entire past\nwhatever's been done to you whether it's\ntrauma or discrimination or abuse or\nneglect or abandonment it is standing\nbetween you and the mirror it's the dust\nand you see that dust and you say that\nmeans\nthat i am not worthy i am not lovable so\nyou see a human being that's distorted\nand you say to yourself because of\nwhat's happened i don't deserve\na high five\nor if you're a human being you've done a\nton of stuff that you regret\nand so all the things that wish you\ncould change that you would forgive jay\nor you'd forgive mel robbins for you\ncannot forgive yourself it's more dust\nand so you stand there and you say\nbecause of all that stuff that i did i'm\nunworthy or i'm unlovable or i'm this or\ni'm that and that dust keeps you from\nseeing a human being who deserves\nsupport and celebration\nor another form of the dust which is the\nresistance is that you actually believe\nthat you do not deserve\nto be celebrated or supported unless\nyou have the bank account or the number\non the scale or you drive in the car or\nlive in the neighborhood or your hair is\nless kinky or you're this or you're that\nand so you withhold the very support and\ncelebration that you need in order to\nchange your life\nfrom you because you haven't done it yet\nthat's where the resistance comes from\nand so i'm here to say you got to try\nthis for five days because it's gonna\nfeel weird you're gonna resist it and\nwhat's gonna happen is you'll notice as\nyou raise your hand and this is where\nthe science gets amazing as you raise\nyour hand jay you will go from thinking\nthis is weird or thinking this is stupid\nto silence\nand this is explained by science\nthere is a field of study called\nneurobics neurobics is a word that i did\nnot even invent it is aerobic or\nphysical movement with new neural\npathway development and research has\nshown that when you use neurobics it is\nthe fastest way to form new neural\npathways\nso the way that you do it is you take an\nunexpected physical movement like\nhigh-fiving yourself something you've\nnever done and you marry it with a\nthought\nnow here's where things get crazy cool\nyou've been high-fiving people your\nwhole life you've been receiving high\nfives your whole life so jay when you\nhigh-five somebody what are you\ncommunicating through the gesture uh a\nfeeling of connectedness a feeling of\nsupport a feeling of i'm congratulating\nyou or celebrating you a feeling of\nyou've got this like that kind of\nfeeling yeah completely\nall of it is programmed in your\nsubconscious brain\nwhen you go to raise your hand to\nhigh-five somebody i can never high-five\njay and go\nyou're a jerk\njay i don't like you jay i hope your tea\nwhich i'm a founding club member of\nreally fails you can't do it yeah\nbecause the programming is already in\nyour brain yes so you cannot look at\nyourself in the mirror and think\nterrible things while you're high-fiving\nyourself because your brain won't allow\nit right it is programmed to think\nsomething different and as you repeat\nthis every day just five days dear god\ngive me five days of doing this\nyou will override the critic and you\nwill reprogram your mind to associate\nbelief\nlove encouragement support resilience\nwith your own reflection this is why i\ndon't even see myself in terms of a body\nanymore i see a human being that i love\nthat i support just like i would a\nfriend or a child that i love\nunconditionally it's mind-blowing but\nthat's not all so i talked to our pal dr\ndaniel amen and this isn't even in the\nbook this is just something i learned\ntwo weeks ago he went bananas when i\ntalked about this thing so jay when you\nhigh-five somebody else your brain drips\ndopamine\nthe reason why\nwhen you do this even on a low morning\nyou get a boost in your mood and a\nlittle bit of clarity wow is you get a\ndrip dopamine by high-fiving yourself\nagain because the programming is already\nin your brain\nyou're just now turning it from\neverybody else and giving it to yourself\nyeah and there's a second thing that's\nsuper cool\nso dr amon was explaining he said you\nknow and you know mel when you leave the\nbathroom you feel kind of peppy right\ni'm like yeah it's kind of weird he said\nwell let me tell you what that is he\nsaid your nervous system\nis encoded with celebratory energy\nwhen you wave hello you're raising your\narms when you cross a finish line you\nraise your arms when you hug somebody\nyou raise your arms when you high-five\nsomebody you raise your arms when you do\nthis every morning especially when\nyou're going through a challenging\nmoment\nyour nervous system recognizes the\ncelebratory gesture and gives you a jolt\nof energy\nis that not\nincredible it's incredible and it makes\nso much sense\nand and and i love you know you have\nthis incredible ability\nto\nmake\npersonal development feel like a light\nswitch\nyou would never think it's that simple\nbut we all every day flip on a light\nswitch we expect the light to come on we\nflip it off and it goes off\nand with the high five habit and the\nfive second rule i feel they're both\nlight switches they're this really\ntiny action really tiny action\nbut this really big result\nthat\njust instantly happens right what what\nyou're just saying now what you just\nsaid about everything doctor donald\nnaman told you those are\nmassive responses to a really simple\naction i mean just raising your hand to\njust high-fiving and so i feel like you\ndo that beautifully you really have this\nart and simplifying things into seconds\nworth of advice\nand what i love about that is\nthat's why our brain has less excuses\nbecause if it's like if you're like jay\ni really need you to take out like 20\nminutes of your day to do this new thing\neveryone goes where am i going to find\n20 minutes you're literally talking\nabout again five seconds yes how long\ndoes it take to high five yourself even\nless probably yeah and you don't have to\nsay anything you don't have to feel\nanything you just have to do it and\nwhat's already programmed in your body\nit does you're right it's such a\nbeautiful light switch it flips it on\nfor you and i want you to do it right\nafter you brush your teeth because you\ngot to get that crap out of your mouth\nso you don't spread the dragon breath on\neverybody let's get the crap and the\ndust off the mirror yeah so you're not\nspreading that negativity throughout\nyour day and you're walking into your\nday feeling like you have your own back\nand feeling that life force that you\nwere born with and being reminded that\nyeah life may be hard yeah i may have\nscrewed things up but i know i'm still\nhere trying and i deserve to feel\nsupported and so i'm going to tap into\nthis to send myself out into the game\nyes you know one of the really cool\nstudies i'm sure you loved the study\nabout the nba teams i know you've talked\nabout this yourself this is both common\nsense and science how does your favorite\nsports team begin the game\nby high-fiving each other to send\nyourself out into the game but when\nresearchers actually studied nba teams\nthey could predict who's going to be the\nmost successful teams at the end of the\nseason and who's going to be at the\nbottom of the league based on one\ncharacteristic at the beginning of the\nseason in the preseason and that is how\nmany times does the team in the\npreseason do fist bumps high fives or\npats on the back\nand what they found is it's the teams\nthat do that the most in the beginning\nhave the winningest record and the\nreason the question is why well the\nreason why is these gestures are more\nthan gestures they are symbols of trust\nand partnership\nthey build momentum\nand so many of us are struggling in life\nwith people pleasing and guilt and all\nof these emotions because we have broken\nthat partnership with ourselves and this\nis a way every morning after brushing\nyour teeth we're going to stack this\nhabit put the toothbrush down pick up\nyour hand look yourself in the mirror\nand say how am i going to show up for\nthat human being today and seal it with\na high five that's it that's it that's\nit and what i love about this book for\nthose of you listening you'll have to\nget the book to see this is is you have\nthese beautiful pictures from your\ncommunity and beyond\nof people actually practicing it\nand do you prefer that one or that one\nthat one yeah let me know if it's good\nyou can zoom in so i just want to show a\nfew pages homotomy yeah you got it\namazing i want to show you a few pages\njust because i think it's beautiful\nto see so many people practicing this\nthere's a few more that i want to show\nyou\ninside yeah\ni think oh yeah the ones at the back but\nthere's also these the one of you is\nreally special to me that one i have to\nshow that one i really like that one\nbecause to me that was chapter two yeah\nthat one to me was was brilliant this is\nwhen mel discovered had i known all\nright\nyeah that's the best\nbut it's it's it's beautiful because\ni love how practical it is i love how\neveryone can give it a go i really\nbelieve everyone who's listening right\nnow we can all take five days to give\nthis a go even if you think it's silly\nwhich i don't think you will because you\nlove this podcast and you love mel and\nand you love everything that we're\ntalking about but it's like this is the\nleast investment we could make in\nourselves like it requires zero\ninvestment it requires it's free it's\nfree it requires zero time commitment\nyou're already standing in front of the\nmirror brushing your teeth yeah it's\njust an extra five seconds on top of\nthat it's absolutely nothing more\ntell me about what this does for the\nrest of the day what is the knock-on\neffect of doing something like this in\nthe morning because\nwhat my head's going to right now is\nin this moment you are choosing\nto high-five instead of beat yourself\nthat's to me what you're teaching people\nto do yes you're training people to\nchoose make a choice that is going to\ntransfer into every choice they have to\nmake throughout the day so now when\ntheir boss says to them\nhey you haven't done this you haven't\ndone that you haven't done this\nhow's it gonna impact talk to me about\nthat and what you saw this is absolutely\nawesome so kind of from uh just sort of\nthe way that people talk about it this\nis both what i've experienced and what\nour audience is constantly uh writing to\nus about and by the way\nthis is\nwithout even having a book out yet i\nknow this is simply\nfrom having people and convincing people\naround the world to try it everybody\nsays it's weird but i gotta hand it to\nyou mel\nthis\npivots my day and sends it in an\nentirely different trajectory\nyou know you talk about it all the time\nyour mood in the morning impacts your\nconfidence and your productivity all day\nwe know that research from harvard tells\nus that when you get intentional about\nhow you're going to show up it not only\nboosts your productivity and your\nconfidence and your focus it also\nchanges your ability to make an impact\nwith people we also know all the\nresearch around what's called emotional\ncontagion when they did i didn't even\nwrite about this in the book but when\nyou separate uh leaders into two groups\nand you show one group of leader you\nknow very stressful videos for 20\nminutes that make you feel agitated or\nbummed out and you throw another group\nall these videos with puppies and\nkittens and j shetty content that's\namazing\nthe leaders that go in to their teams\nwithin 10 minutes the teams feel exactly\neither the negative agitation or the\npositive agitation but it goes even\ndeeper\nso the high five habit in the mirror jay\nit's just the trojan horse of course\nthere are dozens of tools in this and we\ngo deep into something you talk about\nall the time the reticular activity\nsystem which is the filter in your brain\nthat\nin real time i think about it this is\nnot an elegant way to describe it i\nthink about it like an electronic hair\nnet that sits on your brain and in real\ntime this sucker is changing we've all\nexperienced is its effect when we've\nshopped for a house or a car the second\nyou start shopping for your first car\nwhat happens\nyou start seeing those cars that you're\nlooking for everywhere everywhere that\nis what that's your ras you have a\nbouncer in your brain that has a massive\njob and the job of your bouncer in your\nbrain is to decide what gets into the\nprefrontal cortex\nwhat passes through there's only four\nthings jay that actually get through\nautomatically your name we've all\nexperienced it oh did they say jay\nnumber two that happened to me this\nmorning really i had a random person i\nthink shout my name out so i was looking\naround well that's the bouncer in your\nbrain and let it in and there were a\nbazillion other sounds by the way that\nyou didn't hear because the bouncer in\nyour brain blocked them out\nthe second thing is any immediate threat\nso like if you hear a loud noise you'll\nkind of like duck but there are loud\nnoises all day that don't make you do\nthat because the bouncer in your brain\nis blocking it out the third one and\nthis can be tricky for relationships i\nknow you're writing a book about this so\nthis this is any sign that you think\nyour partner might be interested in sex\nwith you or somebody else you know this\nis that jealousy hey\nand then the fourth one and this is\nwhere the treasure is\nthis is everything\nyour brain filters the world based on\nwhat you tell it is important to you so\nwhen you're shopping for a new car\nyou suddenly say to your ras this is\nimportant to me\nand it lets in imagery of the car\nthis works in positive and negative ways\ntrauma is an example of how your filter\ngets trained by a very negative event it\nbecomes very important because your\nnervous system responded to it so your\nbrain records as much as it can to try\nto protect you\na positive\nway is by saying something that you talk\nabout the writing out of your goals the\nhaving visual and environmental triggers\nthat keep these things front of mind\nthese are ways to train your brain for a\npositive effect so one of the things\nthat happens when you start to high-five\nyourself and why it goes so much deeper\neven than the boost and the the\npartnership is that what happens is\nyou're now tapping into an entire field\nof research called behavioral activation\ntherapy you talk about it a lot you know\nall the science if you don't know it\nthere's a very simple way to talk about\nit it's called act like the person you\nwant to become\nand the reason why this is so important\nis we know thinking alone\nwon't get you to change you actually\nhave to take the actions that change\neverything\nand\none of the reasons why high-fiving\nyourself is such a powerful action is\nthe bouncer in your brain the ras it's\npaying attention\nwhen it suddenly sees you\nstop the beatdown\nand it sees you act differently\nit sees you acting like somebody who\nactually cares about you who celebrates\nyou and who sees the high five it will\nswitch in real time and start to see the\nworld in a way\nthat reflects back the fact that you\ndeserve love and support so the more\nthat you act like somebody who loves and\nsupports and believes in themselves by\nhigh-fiving themselves the more your\nbrain changes and the more your reality\nchanges now to your point with toxic\npositivity does it change the very real\nissues people face of course not\nit does not change the fact that there's\ndiscrimination and poverty and trauma\nand very real obstacles that you may be\nfacing right now\nwhat it changes is you\nand your ability to face those things\nand your resilience and your belief\nthat through your attitude and your\nactions\nyou can make a positive difference in\nthose things yeah\nyeah what i love about you what you just\nsaid is that\nwe're all going to face pain and\ndiscomfort regardless\nthe only choice we have\nis are you going to face pain and\ndiscomfort\nwith the feeling of supporting yourself\nor are you going to face pain and\ndiscomfort with the feeling of\ncondemning yourself right that's the\nonly choice you have we're all going to\nface it we're all going to have to deal\nwith stuff that we don't want to deal\nwith and the only choice we get to make\nis what attitude do i want to affect\nthis from what thoughts do i want to\nhave as i go through this and i think\nall of us would agree that we'd rather\nbe going through with thoughts that say\nyou've got this you can do this we can\nget there we'll figure it out we'll find\nan answer we'll make it through rather\nthan the voice in your head that's\nsaying\ni don't think you should do this no\nthat's not going to work no stop no\nyou're terrible oh this is the worst\nthing you could which is what we're all\nhearing right let's talk about\nwhat are the key\naspects you talk about this so much in\nthe book and i do believe this is at the\nheart of the high five habit and also\njust the heart of what you're sharing in\nthis book\nwhat are the key principles\nof how\nsomeone deals with themselves when they\nlove themselves when they care for\nthemselves what are those key tenets\nthose those key values\nthat we can draw ourselves to and\nmeasure against say am i doing that for\nmyself does that make sense yeah am i am\ni creating that for myself because i\nfeel like we know like we always say and\nand some of this is similar but we\nalways say oh if your child and you know\nyou have children going off to make\nfriends at school we always say well be\nkind\nyou know you share advice but we've\nnever been told how to have a\nrelationship with ourselves what are the\nkey principles to having a positive\nrelationship with yourself it's a\nfabulous question so i think at the\nheart of it are two foundational habits\nthat you need and one you already\nmentioned\nit's being kind to yourself\nit's really that simple and i know you\nknow the study that they did in the uk\nwhere they looked at every possible\nbehavior change that you could do in\nlife\nand\nwhether it was changing in diet\nmeditation exercise relationship changes\nall of it\nthe one change that has the biggest\nimpact on fulfillment and happiness is\nbeing kind to yourself and it's the one\nchange we practice the least because i\ndon't think we know how yeah i don't how\ndo yeah how do we be contest well number\none stop the beat down in the mirror and\ndespite the fact that it might feel\nweird or you're going to resist it or\nyou got a lot of dust oh boy we gotta\nwipe it away oh it's more like mud it's\nnot like dust\njay has dust the rest of us are caked\nwith mud gotta get some elbow grease in\nthere uh the high five habit every day\nis wiping that away okay that's number\none number two\nwhen you catch yourself\nin the what-if loop\nor the beat down use the five-second\nrule count backwards five four three two\none interrupt it and start just\ninterrupting it\nbecause you don't have to listen to it\nyou can't always control when it pops up\nbut you can start to create distance\nfrom it meditation obviously helps with\nthat but in terms of the hand to fist\ncombat with your own brain\ni prefer punch back 54321 and then i\nliterally go i'm not thinking about that\nanother strategy that you can use as\nyou're doing the hand-to-hand combat\nwith your own brain\nis\ncome up with like an avatar for this\nnegative voice okay and make it really\ngood like when our son was really\nprofoundly struggling with anxiety he's\n16 now he started to call that worry\nwart in his head that was beating him up\noliver and he looked like this big\npimply bully of a kid that was out of\nthe diary the wimpy kid and he would\nliterally say when he was nine years old\nshut up oliver like you're not invited\nto sleep like he would literally talk to\nit and it sounds like you're giving your\nkid multiple personalities that's not\nactually what's happening you're\nleveraging objectivity so you separate\nyourself from the voice that's talking\nto you yes um another thing that you can\ndo i love this for worrying oh this is a\ngenius to steal your word uh move when\nyou catch yourself doing the what ifs\nbecause we know there's two forms of\nworrying right there's the type of\nworrying that just destroys you that's\ndestructive worrying where you just\nruminate what if what if what if then\nthere's the positive form of worrying\nwhich is productive because it it\nmotivates you to change when you get\nstuck in the what if what if what if\ninterrupt it with this 54321 and then go\nwhat if it all works out\nwhat if this turns out to be one of the\nhardest things i do but the best\ndecision i've ever made\n[Music]\nwhat if placing a bet on myself\nwas the moment my life changed\nwhat if it all works out\nbecause you can't argue with that and it\nliterally stops\nthat sort of cycling because worrying is\njust a habit that you have it's like a\npathway that you've plowed in your mind\nand it's a protection mechanism\nyou're actually not a procrastinator\nyou're not a worrier you're just afraid\nyeah and by staying in your mind you\nthink you're safe\nand really what you're doing is you're\nholding yourself back from living the\nlife that you're meant to live\ni love that that's such a great answer\nso that's because i've got a couple of\nyeah that was be kind to yourself and\nthen there's another one and then the\nother ones keep the little promises that\nyou make to yourself\nand there's two simple ways you can\npractice this that everybody's going to\nhate\nwhen you set the alarm the night before\ni don't believe in having the same\nwake-up time every morning\nbecause i think if you have a normal\nlife\nthings are constantly changing\nand so i think if you were to have one\nsimple habit which is the night before\nyou go to bed think about when you need\nto wake up to truly support yourself\nand then intentionally set your alarm\nand if you want to get really\nintentional with the science here make\nit like a random odd number don't make\nit six o'clock make it 617\nbecause there's a purpose behind that\nand then when that alarm rings don't\nthink about it like an obligation\ni want you to think about it like it's a\npromise that you're going to practice\nkeeping\nand this is where you can use the\nfive-second rule you're just going to\ncount backwards 5-4-3-2-1 to interrupt\nall of the desire in your mind and body\nto stay in bed or to hit the snooze\nbutton or to argue against what you need\nto do and you're going to push through\nthat resistance and take action\nand by getting out of bed simply when\nyou said you would\nyou are again behavioral activation\ntherapy you're acting like a person who\nkeeps their promises and trust yourself\nyes here's another one uh if you can\njust talk about that one you just said\nyeah have we ever talked about 617\nbefore\nsix i don't even know 17 is it's so\ni guess i don't know it's so strange\nwhen you said don't set it at six and\nyou just said my in my mind i was like\nyeah six seventeen just before you said\nit no and yeah i'm not kidding so is\nthat like your wake-up time no it isn't\ni wake up at six okay so why did you\nthink success no idea that's what i was\nasking you have we talked about it\nbefore and i was like now is that the\ntime you wake up or do you discuss that\nin napa or no that is so strange\ni literally was like yeah she's going to\nsay 6 17. that is blessed i know and i'm\ntrying to think now where my mind is 67\nanyway but but the point being i i\nreally really like that principle and\nand what i've found and you're so right\nthat every day is different\nis i found see sleeping the same amount\nof time yes is more important than\nwaking up at the same time well do you\nknow the research around the snooze\nbutton yes\nokay please tell us please tell us okay\nso so literally\nit also when it comes to productivity\nand focus and fulfillment it's not when\nyou get up it's how you get up\nand there's all this crazy research like\ni'm not some sort of like psycho about\nthe alarm clock or the snooze button i\npersonally love sleeping in but i also\nknow that as somebody that's struggled\nwith anxiety for\nthree decades\nlying in bed in the morning or at night\nis the worst place i can be absolutely\nthat is where the anxiety can pin you\ndown like a gravity blanket and so\nunderstanding that the habit of hitting\nthe snooze button has a detrimental\nimpact on your productivity all day\nbecause what happens is when you wake up\nyour brain is typically ready to wake up\nwhen you drift back to sleep after\nhitting the snooze button your brain\ndrifts back into a sleep cycle which\nbased on research takes about 75 minutes\nto complete when the alarm goes off nine\nminutes later your brain is now trapped\nin a sleep cycle and researchers say it\ntakes you about four hours to snap out\nof what they call sleep inertia\nthat impacts your productivity all day\nlong and so you're complaining that i\ndidn't get enough sleep and you feel\ngroggy\nno you actually got plenty of sleep you\nscrewed yourself over by hitting the\nsnooze button and now your prefrontal\ncortex can't snap back into operation\nuntil you're ready to go i want to speak\nabout emotionally which is what you talk\nabout earlier about you've broken your\ntrust with yourself and that's why when\nwe set these unrealistic targets i'm\ngonna wake up at 5am tomorrow i'm going\nto work about six whatever it is that's\nunrealistic for you and then you hit the\nsnooze button four times and you wake up\nat the time you would have woken up\nanyway\nthat's just made you lose faith in\nyourself over nothing right totally\nthat's the totally see i\ni'm kind of one of these people that i\nsort of like lame goals because i want\nyou to win you know i'm just asking for\na high five in the mirror i'm just\nasking that you roll out of bed five\nfour three two one here's another\nwonderful one make your bed and here's\nwhy not because i need you to be a navy\nseal but because when you literally and\ni'm not even talking pop a quarter off\nof it i'm talking throw the blanket\nacross karate chop a pillow throw a\nthrow on a diagonal we're done here\nkind of thing here's why\nnumber one it's a beautiful gift you can\ngive to yourself because as you walk\nback into your room\nit's done you don't see a mess your\nbrain sees a person that actually is\nkind to themselves and follows through\non things tonight when you lay down a\ndream you have a nice place to come back\nto and this is what i'm talking about\nwith lame\nlame goals and what i call simple\ndiscipline\nsimple discipline is roll out of bed\nwhen the alarm rings simple discipline\nis make your bed simple discipline i'm\neven going to make exercise easy you\nwant to hear yeah go so easy okay you\nready\ntonight\nin your closet\nget your exercise clothes out\nlay them on the floor\nput them right in your way\nso you can't step around them because\nthen they're there as a trap\non your floor the next morning again you\ndon't have to think about it yeah you're\nlike oh my gosh stepping over them\nis you breaking a promise when you pull\nthem on i know you're more likely to\nexercise today because they're already\non your body and so but in my book we're\npracticing simple things here so you get\na high five just for pulling the tights\non man like i'm not even gonna count\nexercising if you get the exercise\nclothes on we've gotten up we've made\nour bed we got our exercise now we're\ngonna high five the mirror honey you\njust got four wins you've only been up\nfor 20 seconds this is the mel robbins\nprogram this is how you build trust with\nyourself yes by setting really small\ngoals\nlittle tiny promises because you're\nbuilding a new muscle and the most\nimportant promise in all of this is how\nyou treat yourself in the mirror because\nas you know jay\nthat relationship that you have with\nyourself is the foundation for every\nrelationship that you have\nif you can't look yourself in the eye\nyou will never be able to allow somebody\nelse to love you because you don't first\nlove yourself if you struggle with\npeople pleasing\nthat's not about other people that's\nabout your insecurity with yourself yeah\nso it comes back again to the simple\ndiscipline of looking at yourself and\nlearning\nhow to be secure\nwith the one human being you spend your\nwhole life with\nand the only way you're going to start\nbeing secure with who you are is when\nyou start accepting and loving who you\nare no matter where you are whether you\nexercise today or not whether you blew\nit yesterday or not whether you really\nare trying hard and winning or not i\nlove that i i\nfor me making my bed also improves my\nrelation with my wife because she\nhappens to wake up earlier than me and\ntherefore we have a rule in our house\nwhoever wakes up second does the bad\nwhich means i end up doing the bed i\ndon't like that rule because my husband\ngets up first yeah so anyway i i always\nhave to do my bed but my wife also like\nto have like 20 pillows on the bed so\nthere's more pillows on the bed than\nthere is a bed and and so i really don't\nenjoy it\nbecause i have to like organize these\npillows\nkarate chop do you have to have the\nkarate chocolate yeah i have to cry each\nother i have to lay the throat\ni've got to put three pillows one behind\nthe other i mean it's it's like real\nwork but by the time i finish doing that\ni'm like i can do anything but\ni i love all these principles you're\ntalking about but the biggest thing is\nthe theme that's underlying all of them\nis\ncelebrate congratulate build trust which\nyou're so right that this if anyone's\nlistening and thinking\noh well if i celebrate these little\nthings and i'll never do anything big no\nit's the other way around it's that if\nyou build trust with yourself doing\nthese little things you'll trust\nyourself with bigger things and and\nanyone that you see that's doing big\nbold incredible things today is because\nthey trusted themselves with the tiny\nsmall incremental changes yeah and so\nwhen mel saying celebrate just putting\nthe gym clothes on\nshe's saying that because if you\ncelebrate that you'll notice that hey i\ncan trust myself for this yeah let's\ntalk about celebration because for both\nof us\nand and i also see this in you and i\nthink you know when we're in napa with\nall our friends\ni feel that celebration is something\nthat everyone struggles with the more\nsuccessful they become\nand\nwe because the goals get bigger the time\nlength of the next project gets longer\nbecause it's harder it's like launching\na tv show as you did or you wrote\nanother book after five years there's\nmore pressure this time because the last\nthing was incredible and now you're\ndoing something bigger i find like we\nlive in this world where it's easy to\nstop celebrating did you find that or\nhave you always\nfound time for yourself to celebrate\nyour wins and your successes i'm just\nasking on a personal level the honest\nanswer\nis that i think it wasn't until i\ndiscovered the high five habit that i\nprofoundly realized how much self-hatred\ni was dealing with\nand despite everything else yeah well\nand this i think is a really big piece\nof the power of this\nespecially if you're somebody who's\nachievement oriented and everybody that\nlistens to this podcast\nfeels a big calling and wants to do more\nin the world and make a bigger\ndifference and a bigger impact there's a\nreal danger that's very common jay\nthat you start to marry or you've always\nmarried\nbeing worthy or lovable with what you're\ndoing\nand what you're achieving\nand it works both ways in terms of if\nyou're don't have the number on the\nscale it means again the dust on the\nmirror you are not worthy because you\nhaven't achieved it yet\nand for those of us that have achieved\nsome things that we've set out to do\nwhat happens is you find that as soon as\nyou achieve the thing\nyou actually need to do something else\nbigger better better because\nit was a thing that you achieved that\nmade you lovable or worthy\nand the real trick and this is\neverything\nis being able to know and feel in your\nbones\nthat you are\nlovable and worthy just because you're\nbreathing and that was a huge\nbreakthrough for me\nand so no i never celebrated because i\nthink i was so married to this idea that\nif unless i'm doing or winning or\nachieving and it happens so subtly when\nyou're little because you start to get\nso much positive praise when you get a\ngood grade or when you do something at\nschool or when you make your mates laugh\nor whatever it might be that you start\nto go oh\nthat's what love feels like oh if i do\nthat and so you outsource love and\nvalidation to outside things and i'm\nhere to tell you we all got to learn how\nto bring it back home and anchor the\nvalidation and love that you need\nwhere you are right now every single day\nand it's only in discovering this that i\nhad to confront\njust how much i was beating myself up\njust how much i was tearing myself down\nand how i was chasing these things\nbecause what i actually wanted\nwas to feel loved\nlike if you ask yourself okay great you\nwant to make a million dollars why\nthere's a feeling\nthat you're looking for from that\nand if you can start to work on\nbringing that feeling into your\nday-to-day life for yourself\nit changes the way that you go about\nachieving things like i didn't even\nenjoy half the stuff that i did because\ni was constantly\nmaniacally focused on the things that\nweren't working\nrather than the hundred things that were\nand the same is true with everybody's\nday\nyou don't even know the number of\namazing things you do every day\nyou feed the dog high five you got the\nkids to school high five you read 10\npages of the book high five you said a\nnice thing to a stranger high five you\ngot something done at work high five you\ngot through 70 of your inbox high five\ninstead you focus and ruminate on the\none thing you didn't get to and then you\nuse that as evidence again dust on the\nmirror yeah to see a human being that's\nnot measuring up and never will and all\nthat stuff their stupid fourth grade\nteacher said to you must be true dust on\nthe mirror no\nyou need to interrupt this\nperiod yeah\nthat is so so powerful everything you\njust said i was just nodding along\nthinking this is so true i i saw a video\nrecently from a good friend of mine\njason goldberg and he was talking about\na study at the olympics where\npeople who win bronze are happier than\nthose who win silver\nand so coming third makes you happy than\ncoming second because the people that\ncome second they go oh but i was a\nsecond away from first and so they feel\ndisheartened whereas the person who came\nthird goes at least i made it on the\npodium\nyeah and that's what you're saying yeah\n1000. make it to the podium yes put on\nthe clothes or just put on the clothes\njust put on the clothes but that's\nmaking it like to me that's yeah it's\njust getting there it's nice\nand and actually what you really hit\nsomething when you were saying that\nabout celebration for me\nit's not just about celebration it's\nabout what we celebrate in our lives\nso when we celebrate our birthday we're\ncelebrating life\nwhen you're celebrating an achievement\nyou're still celebrating a thing yes and\nso celebrating life when you're\ncelebrating your breath when you're\ncelebrating your life force your energy\nyour soul the ability to love the\nability to be kind the ability to have\nrelational exchanges like we're having\nright now that's what you celebrate\nbecause if you only celebrate things now\nyou're waiting for the next thing and i\nactually learned that completely from\nmy wife rather whether it was\nconsciously or unconsciously she didn't\neven know what she was doing this was\ntotally all in my own head but i\nrealized that every time i reached a new\nexternal peak or a new thing\ni expected to receive more love from her\ni expected that she would\nthink something more cool of me\nand the answer was she didn't\nshe loved me the\nsame and i would always wonder how why\ndoes she not love me for this like how\ndoes she not respect me how does she not\nfeel it differently i mean look what i'm\ndoing look what i've achieved\nand\nwhen i kept working with that thought\nand i reflect deeply and i love breaking\ndown my own thoughts and figuring it out\nand i really get stuck in there i\nrealized that my wife loves me\nfor my life and who i am not what i do\nyes and so she unintentionally trained\nme and taught me\nto disconnect my value from what i do\nto who i am which is what she loves me\nfor and i realized that that was so much\nmore beautiful and so much more powerful\nand so much more meaningful to be loved\nfor who i am yes than what i do and\nachieve yes and here's here's now an\neven bigger thing please\nyou already do this\nbut as you're listening to jay and i i\nwant you to actually\ngrasp\nhow profound it would be\nif you could feel that way about\nyourself\n[Music]\nif you could always just look in the\nmirror and see a human being that's\ntrying and that's worthy of a high five\nand a human being that failed and okay\nwe're gonna brush it off and that's\nworthy of a high five somebody who is\nrunning the marathon of life\nthat you're going to celebrate every\nstep of the way\nand you know i also want to take this\nand flip this in the opposite because i\nthink this is where people really get\nmucked up this happened in my own\nmarriage and it's only a recent\ndiscovery between chris and i and that\nis\nthat we had the opposite thing happen\njay\nso when chris and his best friend went\ninto the restaurant business and they\npoured seven years into it and gave it\ntheir go and at the end of the day\nthey sold it you know for pennies on the\ndollar to the next investor and they\ndid not return the profit that they had\nhoped they would return to their\ninvestors\nnow what was interesting about watching\nthis all go down is that our best friend\nwho was chris's partner was able to\nleave the experience and go okay\nentrepreneurship i'm so proud of us we\nput in so much work we built something\namazing we had an incredible brand we're\nincredible leaders\ndid we return the profit no but that's\nnot everything in life and he moved on\nmy husband\ncould not\nhe literally said\nbecause i didn't achieve\nbecause i failed\ni am a failure who is not worthy of love\nand for seven years he has walked into a\nbathroom with the dust\nthat has said i am a failure\nand so as you have been looking for why\ndoesn't she love me more\nsomebody who fails goes\nhow can you still love me\nand it's only until it doesn't matter\nhow much i love the guy it doesn't\nmatter how much i build him up and you\nknow i'm so proud of everything that\nhe's done and all the stuff that chris\nis doing and he's had a massive\nbreakthrough in this and part of it is\nthrough the high five habit because of\nthe resistance but i can't do that look\nat look at the failure that i've been\nif you don't love yourself you won't\nallow somebody else to love you yeah\nand so when you can separate what you're\ndoing from your soul and your intention\nand your spirit and your humanity\nand you can stand with yourself every\nmorning and that high five doesn't\nnecessarily become celebration it\nbecomes acceptance\nand it becomes compassion and it becomes\nacknowledgement and then it becomes\nslowly celebration and momentum and\nforward energy that you need\nwhen life drags you down yeah and so\nit's really a profound point you just\nmade\nthat it's only when you love yourself\nfor breathing for living for being just\nas you are that that level of acceptance\nthat we so want from everybody else and\ni'm telling you you have an opportunity\nto do it for yourself\nby keeping your promises by being kind\nyourself by standing before yourself and\nseeing a human being who needs you and\nwho loves you and who's going to be with\nyou\nyour whole life\nthat's beautiful\nit's amazing\njust just sitting there listening to you\ntalk about that and\nwhen i'm thinking about what you said\nwith chris we we've recently celebrated\nyour 25th wedding anniversary which is\nincredible congratulations yeah i mean\nthat's\ngoals like so me and my wife we've been\nmarried what five together for eight\nwhen i hear you're 25 i'm like share all\nthe wisdom give it to me uh\ntell me about what it's been like\nlearning from each other especially\nseeing as your job is teaching yeah it's\ncoaching it's working with ceos and\norganizations and people and of course\nmillions of people online but you're\nworking with so many companies as well\nhow has it been for him and for you to\nlearn from each other has that been easy\nhas it been harder when you talk about\nthe seven years and you're saying that\nbroke partly through the high five habit\nfor him i love hearing that because\nthat makes me go yes like not only does\nthis work for everyone it works for the\npeople closest to you which says so much\ncan you tell us a bit about yeah that\nwell you know and also you know to\nchris's credit he also got into therapy\nand you know he did the work he did the\nwork he and he started a men's retreat\nto help other men sold agreed to do the\nwork and we've done a lot of work\ntogether which i think is really\nimportant it's so important to do work\non yourself\nbecause it's not your partner's job to\nmake you happy\nit's your job to figure out how to bring\nthe happiest and healthiest and kindest\nyou into the relationship\nbecause when you can do that\nyou can build a like a a nurturing\ncrucible if that's even the right word\nwhere you is that the right one i don't\neven know what you can build like a pot\ni don't know that sounds very\nunglamorous but we camp a lot um\nyou know\ni think the hardest\nthing and it took me a long time\nwas realizing that the most important\nthing\nin a relationship if you want it to go\nthe distance\nis being kind\nand actually staying interested\nin the other person's experience and\npoint of view\nlike the the challenge of being in a\nrelationship that long is you think you\nknow somebody yeah\nand that's so true the fact is i don't\ncare how great your relationship is\nor how bad it is or whatever but how\ngreat it is in particular there are\nparts of the person you're with that you\ndon't know because even they don't know\nthat totally and i don't even think\nchris realized the extent to which he\nwas subconsciously\npile driving himself with his mindset\nand it didn't matter that i thought he\nwas the most incredible person in the\nworld or the greatest father or\nwonderful spouse or my biggest\ncheerleader he didn't feel\nlike those things\nand so i would say being kind listening\ni think also making requests of each\nother really important so instead of\npointing out what's wrong\nthink about what you need\nbecause even though chris and i have\nbeen together for 27 years now married\n25\ni'm still not a mind reader\nand when you can make requests about\nwhat you need\ninstead of letting it get to you\nand then acting out\nthat changes everything\nthat's incredible i love hearing that\nthank you for sharing that and thank you\nfor opening up i i met chris for the\nfirst time probably about a month ago\nnow he's wonderful like he's just such a\ngentleman so kind\nso sweet so loving very warm i mean we\nhad so many beautiful interactions and\nconversations while we're in napa\ntogether and\ni i just love seeing you both continuing\nto\nyou know really just show what real\nstrength looks like as a couple\nwell you know jay i think one of the\nother things that has been fascinating\nis you've got to leave room for each\nother to grow yeah so we've also gone\nthrough tremendous evolutions as a\ncouple where\nyou know for a while we were both\nworking and we were sort of 50 50 in\nterms of what we earned and then chris\nstarted to out earn me and then i kind\nof took the second roll and the next\nthing you know he's going into\nentrepreneurship and i'm sort of growing\nin the corporate market next thing you\nknow we find ourselves financially\nimploding 800 000 in debt horrible\nexperience 12 years ago about to lose\neverything\nand what was interesting is it was that\ncrisis that flipped us into the right\nroles\nchris as you met his name's christopher\nrobbins he's like the world's most\nnurturing man you know winnie the pooh's\nowner for crying out loud\nhe doesn't care\nabout money and building things and\nfancy stuff he would live in a yurt if i\nwould want to i do not did you hear that\nchris i do not\num\nit was through that that i discovered my\nown ambition\nthat i actually do care about building\nthings i do want to go out and play that\ngame in business i freaking love it and\nit happened at the perfect time because\nit was at the moment when we had kids in\nmiddle school\nand they needed somebody more nurturing\nthan me to be home and they needed\nsomebody and so our kids have had the\ngreatest gift because they've seen\nour partnership evolve they've seen a\ndad that stayed home for a while they've\nseen a mom off in the world building\nsomething and the biggest message is\nthat you're only going to stay together\nif you continue to talk\none of the things that our therapist has\nsaid to us that i think about all the\ntime so steal this\nit's really easy\nwhen you get along\nto do the logistics and transactions of\nlife\nbut you can start to find yourself very\nsequestered\nfrom each other\nbut together and in roles but never\ngoing deeper\nand so i think when you notice that\neither you're not growing or your\npartner's not growing\nthat's when it's really important to\nstart turning toward one another yeah\nthat's so true that's so true i've\nalways said like\nfor me right now watching radhi grow is\nlike my favorite thing in the world\nbecause she's almost just in the last 18\nmonths really discovered her purpose\nshe's always been very skilled and\ntalented and had lots of strengths but\nit was in this last 18 months that i saw\nher really\nembrace herself high five yeah yeah yeah\nlike she really got to that point here's\nhigh five\nyeah high five for herself\nand and to really claim that and own\nthat and it's the most fun thing seeing\nyour partner find that and i was like\nwe're gonna clear up your whole schedule\nso you can just do that because i see\nthat that momentum is coming for you\nand i think often what it is and and you\ntalk about this i have a few more\nquestions i want to ask you but\nit's this idea of often even in our\npartners you talk about jealousy in\nchapter eight you talk about a chapter\nwhich you call why is life so easy for\nthem and not for me\nand i've noticed that this sometimes can\neven creep i want to talk about it\nbroadly but it can also creep into our\nown marriage in relation oh for sure\nwhere people think oh well i did and and\nyou know there's there's pros and cons\nto this so obviously in our life i was\nthe one who who built my\npurpose and career and riley was\nbuilding her skills and her strengths\nand it's so easy to get caught up in the\nmindset of well i didn't have someone\nwho was gonna help me out when i started\nout because i didn't uh and you can even\nhave that in your own relationship and\nit can be so poisonous and toxic in your\nown relationship\nbut you also talk about how jealousy can\nbe used as a tool oh yeah so i wanted to\nhear about that because i think we do\nlive in a world today whether it's in\nour own relationships whether it's\nbroadly we always look oh it's easy for\nthem it's not for me oh everything's\nworking out for them it's not for me i\nwork even harder than that person does\nbut they're winning i'm not i'm more\ntalented and skilled than that person\nbut so when you're feeling how do you\nuse that as a tool okay so i love that\nyou asked us because this is a powerful\ntool\nfirst of all we all misunderstand\njealousy\nyou think jealousy is hatred that's not\nwhat it is all jealousy is desire that's\nall that it is and when it starts to\nbubble up and consume you and it used to\nconsume me like crazy i used to be just\nlike that person that you were talking\nabout jake jealous of everybody j i hate\njay\njay has a podcast oh for i hate jay\njay's been at this longer than look at\nall those followers that jay has oh of\ncourse he lives in la of course he's got\nto sort like i mean i could just whoo\nspin it all but here's the thing\nthis is the coolest part about jealousy\nyou ready\nyou cannot be jealous of someone or\nsomething\nthat you don't truly desire\ni'm not the least bit jealous of\nsomebody who has the most extraordinary\napartment in new york city\ni don't want to live there\nit's not meant for me\njealousy is a clue\nit's a directional signal\nit's a dot on the map of your life\nand the desire is blocked by fear or\ncomparison or insecurity or stress or\nwhatever\nand so when you start to recognize oh\ninteresting there's jealousy well i'm\njealous of jay he's got this incredible\npodcast that's reaching millions of\npeople he's making this huge difference\nwhat is it about that is it about jade\nyeah no but really what it's about is\ni've been wanting to do a podcast\nforever so instead of aiming that\njealousy out at the world or at myself\naim it into inspiration\naim it into motivation\nrecognize and give yourself permission\nthat if you unpack whatever it is that\nyou're jealous of i'm jealous of their\nmarriage what is it about it is it the\nfact that they seem to have a date night\nis it the fact that they're really kind\nto each other explore it lean into it\ngive yourself permission to have that\nthing and then\nget off your ass and go make it happen\nthat's it because here's the thing your\njealousy is not going away\nand it will either continue to consume\nyou\nor you are going to blow the lid off\nthat block desire and you are going to\nempower yourself to start moving toward\nwhat you want\nthat's how you do it and again this high\nfive habit is so important because if\nyou stand in front of the mirror and go\ni'm too late i'd just be a copycat all\nthese people see you dumb like this is\nwhat the beat down is yeah if you go no\nyou high-five yourself you're like i see\nyou you are a little bit later than\neverybody else great they're guide posts\non the map of your life yeah all these\npeople are your co-creators everybody\nyou're jealous of is literally somebody\nthat is running point for you\nbut you haven't allowed yourself the\npermission\nto unpack it and actually\nquestion and go on an inquiry that's so\nrewarding of well wow what is really\ncalling me about this yeah i i think\nthat's so true and i love seeing\njealousy that way and you you said\nsomething there was really important\nthat i want people to catch on if they\ndidn't is jealousy is a tool when you're\nself-aware like you are self-aware i\ndon't want an apartment in new york\nhence if someone has a stunning\napartment in new york i don't feel\njealous but a lot of us our jealousy is\njust scattered\nbecause\nwe don't know what we want or what our\ndream truly is so then everyone's dream\nfeels exciting and better than ours and\nthat's why i think what you said is so\ntrue\nwhen people actually can develop a\nlittle bit of self-awareness of what is\nmy genuine dream because i remember i\ntalk a lot about like when you don't\nfind your purpose you're jealous of\neveryone and when you know your purpose\nthen you become jealous in your space of\nyour purpose and at least it narrows it\ndown but it's like when you don't know\nit's like i could look at a singer and\nbe like oh i wish i could sing like oh i\nshould have had that or if i'm and i\nknow i can't sing to save my life so\nwhen i have that self-awareness i can\ndetach okay don't need to be jealous of\njustin bieber i'm not just people that's\nokay right right or like cristiano\nronaldo i love soccer i adore soccer but\ni was never good enough to play soccer\nin a right for the premier league club\nor whatever so i can let go of that and\nthat's why i think self-awareness is so\nimportant\nbecause otherwise jealousy will just\ndrive you crazy\nand and i think that's where it starts\nthat jealousy can be a tool when you\nactually know yourself well and jealousy\nlet's take this a step further\nactually can help you know yourself yeah\nbecause i think what justin bieber and\nyou know the soccer player have in\ncommon is they are living full out yes\ntheir life force is on display yes\nthat's what you're attracted to yes and\nso if you were to even take all your\nscattered jealousy and sit with a cup of\namazing tea and calm yourself down and\nyou know like we haven't even talked\nabout high-fiving your heart which is a\nway to flip your nervous system into a\ncalm state and map it all out and be\nlike oh interesting all these people\nthat i'm jealous of that i follow online\nthat i obsess over that i like their\nposts\nit's their life force yeah it's their\nartistry it's the obsession yes yes and\nso that is there is there is a common\ntheme there and it can help you gain the\nself-awareness absolutely i want to ask\nyou one last question before we go to\nfinal five this is about a chapter that\nyou call\nuh how about i start tomorrow\nand i love this because i think\nso many people will be listening to this\nand be like okay tomorrow i'm going to\nstart doing yes\nand that's you know we all know that\nokay next monday okay no 2022. i'm going\nto read this book january 2022 right\npeople yeah we start thinking like that\ntell us about how\nthat mindset doesn't help us\ndo it tomorrow yeah are you kid so first\nof all\nmotivation is complete garbage\neverybody's sitting around waiting to\nfeel like a j and this is a recipe for\nnever seeing your dreams come true and\ndying with a lot of regret thank you\nvery much welcome to my ted talk this\nhas been very inspiring no i seriously\nlike i want you to understand\nthat you will never\nfeel ready to do things that scare you\nyou will never feel ready to jump off\nthe cliff\nyou will never feel ready to take that\nleap\nand the reason why is based on science\nand research your brain is designed to\nprotect you\nand change requires risk\nand so you are protecting yourself by\nsaying maybe tomorrow this is where the\nfive second rule comes in super handy so\nif you are constantly procrastinating\nyou probably have a bias towards\nthinking and you can use the five second\nrule to literally push yourself to take\naction all you're gonna do is count\nbackwards five four three two one that's\nit i know it's as dumb as the high five\nit's as simple as the high five it has\nprofound research behind it because what\nyou're doing when you start counting\nbackwards and you have to count\nbackwards it does not work if you count\nup doesn't work because counting\nbackwards five four three two one\nrequires you to focus\nwhen you focus you flip the switch and\nyour prefrontal cortex turns on\nthis is a starting ritual that\ninterrupts the patterns of overthinking\nof fear of anxiety of procrastination of\ncomparison that are making you go up\ntomorrow not today i don't feel like it\nfive four three two one your prefrontal\ncortex turns on that's the part of the\nbrain you need\nto either learn new behavior or take\naction that's inspired so now when you\nget to one you got a shot at doing\nsomething different so move and here's\nthe real secret to this\nthe second you started counting you\nactually made a decision to change\nso the counting is the trojan horse to\nthe bigger thing you're avoiding 54321\nlaunches you through the resistance\nand it pushes you into action that's the\nonly way you're going to change\nsitting there listening to us lightning\nis not going to strike you on the couch\njay and i are not going to show up and\nkick you or drag you out of your house\nand make you go on that run\nif you want to change your life\nyou must make a decision to change your\nlife\nand you know i'm going to say something\nthat i really hope\nhappens from you listening to jay and i\ntoday\ni think it's very easy to sit in this\nmoment in your life and to look back\nat your life and to see how everything\nthat's ever happened to you positive and\nnegative is a dot on the map of your\nlife that has led you here\ntrue power\nis knowing that this moment right here\nis also a dot on your map\nand that this moment too is connecting\nyou\nforward on the map of your life\ntowards something extraordinary\nthat hasn't happened yet\nand you can either sit here and listen\nto this and let this dot come and go\nor you can\nwake the heck up and realize at some\npoint\nthe map takes you to a final destination\nand we don't know when that is\nbut if you want to change your life you\ngot to make a decision to change your\nlife and sitting around and waiting to\nfeel ready is not the decision i want\nyou to make\nso when you're done listening to this\n54321\ni want you to turn toward that thing\nthat you've always dreamt of that you've\nbeen waiting to do and you go\nand you move toward the thing that is\nmeant for you because that's the only\nway you're gonna get there the one and\nonly mel robbins everyone the high five\nhabit uh mel we end every episode with\nthe final five which suits you perfectly\nwith the five second rule and the high\nfive five it's like we planned it\nuh and this is our fast five so every\nquestion has to be answered in one word\nto one sentence oh okay so i give once\nyeah yeah yeah okay so the first\nquestion is what is the best advice\nyou've ever received never leave a\nbathroom without high-fiving yourself in\na mirror i love it all right question\nnumber two what is the worst advice\nyou've ever received someone else can\nmake you happy\nabsolutely they can make you a cup of\ncoffee yeah they can't make you happy a\nlot of people hear that it's very true\num\ni i didn't get to ask you this probably\nbut i want to hear about it tell us\nabout high-fiving your heart hand on\nyour heart oh this is incredible so this\ncomes from research from uh dr judy\nwillis and this is why this is so\nimportant\nright now i think everybody's nervous\nsystem is in a state or fight or flight\nif you feel constantly exhausted\nstressed out you can't focus\num you're on edge you're waiting for the\nother shoe to drop and honestly what\nwe've just lived through\nthe human body is not\nbuilt to sustain that level of\nuncertainty for that amount of time\nso what you're going to do to high five\nyour heart is we're gonna teach you how\nto flip off\nyour fight-or-flight nervous system and\nflip on your parasympathetic calm cool\nnervous system\nand so here's how you do it it's very\nsimple you're gonna take your hands and\npush them on the center of your chest\nand you're gonna take a deep breath\nblow it out and then you're going to\nrepeat these three sentences\ni'm okay i'm okay\ni'm safe i'm safe i'm loved i'm loved\nand some mornings you might need to do\nit 53 times\nwhat's happening and what do you feel\njay when you do that\ni feel i mean on a physical level i feel\nlike my heart rate's slowing down i feel\nlike my body's become more relaxed in a\nin an emotional or mental capacity i\njust feel a sense a more stillness a\nsense of more\nclarity and certainty\nexactly\nwhat you're doing on a scientific level\nis you're tapping into a treasure in\nyour body called the vagus nerve now you\ntalk about this all the time it runs\nfrom your seat to the top of your head\nthrough every major organ through your\nvocal cords there are lots of ways you\ncan strengthen strengthen the vagus\nnerve it is the on off switch between\nyour stressed out nervous system\nand your cool grounded one\nand so every morning i want you to high\nfive your heart\ni want you to take a deep breath and\nstart your day by saying i am okay i'm\nsafe and i'm loved\nand repeat it and repeat it and repeat\nit until you feel yourself come back\ninto your body\nyou feel the stress level decrease\nand the fact of the matter is if you can\nhear yourself even thinking those three\nsentences it's true\nwe had a woman who uh wrote to us from a\nhomeless or a domestic violence shelter\nand she said that\nshe's had tremendous childhood abuse\nshe's just escaped a very abusive\nrelationship she's lost everything\nshe said for five days she's been waking\nup and high-fiving her heart\ntelling herself that i'm okay i'm safe\ni'm loved\nshe's been\nstarting her day with a high five in the\nmirror\nand she said after just five days\ni realized i have a very long road ahead\nof me\nbut now i know\nat least i still have myself wow\nthat's incredible it's absolutely\nbeautiful i i uh\nit's funny because when when i was\nreading about that in the book i didn't\nrealize it so i have a habit of\nthat's probably one of my go-to hand\ngestures in my day-to-day life\nand i do it usually when someone thanks\nme so if i bump into someone on the\nstreet and they're like hey listen to\nthe podcast i really love it i'll always\nsay thank you so much like that's a very\nnice you do that's my it's my name so\nwhen i read about it i was like i didn't\nknow about i do it because it's just a\nnatural thing for me but i'll literally\npromise i'm like thank you so much that\nmeans the world to me i'm so grateful\nfor that like that's that's and i do\nthat all the time it's it's like my\ngo-to hand gesture um not that i've\ntrained it or thought of it\nsubconsciously been what i've done and\nnow that i know that it does that i'm\nlike wow like it's it's incredible to\nthink that some of these things actually\nhappen quite subconsciously and\nyou know naturally so anyway that was\nsomething i had to ask about okay\nbeautiful question number four uh what\nis how would you define your current\npurpose\noh\nit's uh\ncracking\nthe wall of darkness that people live in\nand letting a little light in\nand the fifth and final question if you\ncould create one rule or law or habit\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be i'm not sure uh it\nwould definitely be\nbecause of the impact in my life never\nleave a bathroom without high-fiving the\nhuman being you see in the mirror yeah i\nlove that i'm going to be doing it every\nday this week awesome and and forever\ni'm gonna hope that it continues to last\nand last and last as i have it but i'm\nso grateful to you mel we could talk for\nhours there's so much more in this book\nto
