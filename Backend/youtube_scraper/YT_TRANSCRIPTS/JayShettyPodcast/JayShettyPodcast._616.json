    "transcript": "everyone is rushing around trying to\nfind time in their day we've all got\nbusy schedules me and you have busy\nschedules we don't always get to have\nbreakfast together we don't always get\nto have dinner together\nroddy's got shoots she's working with\nbrands and companies i've got podcasts\nto be recording we're making content\nbut we found that we always managed to\nfind time to have tea together yeah and\nthat connection was so important to us\nand we found that during the pandemic\nthat was something we did\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld in the world\nthanks to each and every one of you who\ncome back every week to listen learn and\ngrow and today have fun\ni\ni am so grateful and so excited for this\nextra special episode of on purpose\nwhere i'm sitting down with my favorite\nguest of all time talking about a brand\nnew launch that we've been working on\nnone other than my wife my love my\nbusiness partner radi devlukia shetty\nradhi thanks for being on the show yay\ncome on carry on with your sound effects\ndrumroll let's announce what the name is\nof our business\nno that we're doing that in a bit you\ncan't just dive in\nhow does it feel to be back on on\npurpose righty i'm so excited i feel\nlike i was just here because i was six\nmonths ago and um but just so excited to\nshare something that we don't usually\ntalk about we don't usually talk about\nbusiness we don't usually talk about um\nwe haven't really done anything like\nthis together so i'm really excited to\nshare it with everyone\ntalk about what tyrant you are as a\nbusinessman\ntalk about what tyrant you are as a\nbusiness partner\nand just get into the teats let's do it\nsounds great yeah i'm excited\nwe've never worked on anything together\nprofessionally before no and what we're\nabout to share with you is something\nthat has taken around the last 18 months\nof work we've been working on it hand in\nhand together throughout this whole time\nit's been a lot of fun\nit's been\ncrazy it's been busy it's been exciting\nand it's been great we've learned so\nmuch about relationships and about work\nduring the same time and i think that's\nwhat's been so unique yeah is that when\nyou're working on something together\nprofessionally\nyou're also learning about each other\npersonally yeah that's so true and so\nwhen we've done these episodes before\nwe've just talked about our relationship\nand like moving country and changing\njobs and chasing our passions but all\nvery separate to each other exactly yeah\nexactly today we're talking about\nsomething that we've actually been\nworking on\nat the same time\nduring the pandemic when we've both been\nlocked indoors and\nthis is our pandemic baby totally yeah\nyeah\ngone\nsama\nher name is sama\nour pandemic\n[Laughter]\nwe love her baby much when we said we\nhad an announcement everyone was like\neveryone oh my goodness every every time\ni post anything oh my gosh is that baby\nis it baby are you pregnant is it i\nposted something about i don't know this\noff topic but i need to show you i think\ni posted oh i posted uh real to do with\ni don't know i think it was like\nchocolate or something and then someone\nlike on every comment it's like oh is\nthis this is are you no i said something\nabout craving oh is it because you're\nhaving a baby i was like no i just\nreally love chocolate okay so raleigh do\nyou want to explain\nwhat sama is and what it stands for sama\nis a organic uh hot tea\nbeverage\nright it's so funny because there's so\nmany technical terms that's the other\nthing i've learned in this um building\nthis brand is there's so many\ntechnicalities to how you describe\nsomething so this is a hot tea\num it's not just herbal we have um we\nalso have caffeinated teas too but um\npredominantly herbal right we've got\npredominantly herbal teas and the\nspecial thing about it is that we have\nadaptogens in them and when we were\ncreating these teas you know i find\nadaptogens are something that are being\nused a lot now and for anybody who\ndoesn't know what adaptogens are they're\nbasically herbs or plants\nthings that are taken from plants which\nhelp with the stresses of your body\nwhether it's physical whether it's\nmental whether it's emotional whether it\nis cellular anything that's happening in\nyour body that needs support there are\ndifferent adaptogens for different\nthings for example for stress or\nwhether it's for\nmood elevation like there are different\nadaptogens for different things and so\nwith our teas that's exactly what we've\ndone and i really wanted to create it in\na way that\nit wasn't just there for name like you\nknow you can have you can read\ningredients and there's so many\ndifferent things in that you've never\neven heard about but do they really have\nthe right quantity to have the right\neffect and so with this we really wanted\nto\ncreate the teas in a way where okay if\nyou have three tea bags or if you have x\namount of tea bags a day it's going to\ngive you the dose of for example\nashwagandha which is one of the\nadaptogens we've used so as radhi's\nalready said sama has been our\nquarantined baby as you called it\nand\nthe word sama has a really really\nspecial meaning has many many different\nmeanings but my favorite definition of\nsama\nis togetherness\nand equality and community\nand our\nfocus and our hope with sarma\nis that tea is a great way to come\ntogether yeah it's a great way of coming\ntogether and being more open and honest\nwith each other having vulnerable\nmoments and it gives you back time in\nyour day and we've talked about this a\nlot about how like everyone is rushing\naround trying to find time in their day\nwe've all got busy schedules me and you\nhave busy schedules we don't always get\nto have breakfast together we don't\nalways get to have dinner together\nriley's got shoots she's working with\nbrands and companies i've got podcasts\nto be recording we're making content\nbut we found that we always manage to\nfind time to have tea together yeah and\nthat\nconnection was so important to us\nand we found that during the pandemic\nthat was something we did a lot a lot we\nhad tea a lot like every time would be\nlike to me do you want a tea what tea do\nyou want yeah like how many teas did we\nprobably have in a day we had so many\nand i think it was usually we have our\ntea time i feel like in the evening or\nmaybe in the morning if we do catch\nbreakfast together then we're both\nsipping on our tea but i also love the\nyou know when i when we first launched\nsama i had so many messages about what\nsama means in their language and one of\nthem was also oneness and i know that's\nsomething that we've been talking about\nwhere even though it is for community\nand togetherness to do with other people\nbut it's also an opportunity for people\nto take moment to themselves as well but\nall feel connected to themselves not in\na way that they feel lonely but in a in\na moment where they are connecting to\nthemselves and i think that's what's so\nbeautiful about summer that it's it's to\nto bring people together but also to\nallow people to connect better with\nthemselves too and that's what i really\nthink our intention was with it i love\nthat yeah i love what you're saying like\neven having that present mindful moment\nwith yourself yeah it doesn't have to be\nwith someone else yeah but just getting\nto press pause be still yeah connect\nwith yourself i love that yeah so so\nthat's\nwhere the name sama comes from\nit's\nwhy we were so\ndrawn to it as our name we also feel the\nname sama it's just very calming yeah\nit's very still it feels very relaxing\nit has that energy that we want\nand\ni think this\ncompany for us was all about\ncreating an experience that we love yeah\nand sharing it with all of you like we\nwant you to be able to be more present\nthroughout the day be more mindful be\nmore energetic and we'll talk about in a\nmoment how all the teas are designed to\ndo those different things rather he's\nthe pro and expert but really at a heart\nlevel it was me and rady are having this\nexperience and we both talk a lot about\nlike healthy habits and things you can\nchange in your day but yeah adding tea\nto your day is like this really simple\nthing so raleigh i actually want you to\ntell everyone about\nyour experience with tea and your family\nbecause i realized this when we got\nmarried actually before we got married\nwhen we started dating\nand i would spend time with your family\ni started to realize that tea wasn't\njust big in my family yeah so tell me a\nbit about that yeah i mean for as long\nas i can remember tea has been the thing\nthat we all do together after a meal\nlike whether it's lunch time like a\nsunday lunch that we've all had together\nor whether it's after every dinner we\nwould put on the kettle we would boil\nthe water and everybody would sit down\nwith their cup of tea and usually my\ndad's telling his dad jokes and you know\nit's a it's something that i have been\nremembering so much more at this time\nespecially being away from family where\ni hold on to that comfort and memory so\nevery time i sip on my tee now i'm like\ni feel like it takes me back to those\nmoments and it keeps me connected to\nthem even though i'm away from them\nand um they were just the best times\nlike i just all i remember from those\nmoments are like laughter\nand coziness and comfort and i think tea\neven if you haven't got that memory of\ntea\nor that memory connected to tea tea has\nthat comforting feeling anything warm\nwhen you put something warm in your\nhands and you take a you know sniff of\nsomething that smells so wonderful\nthrough your through your nose and it\njust brings you so much comfort and so\nyeah tea is has been a big part of my\nlife for a long time and also because we\nnever drank coffee growing up um my\nfamily's not big coffee drinkers either\ni love how you keep using the word\nbeverage it is a beverage because they\ndon't drink either so it wasn't i would\nsit down with like a beer after anything\neither it's like oh whatever it is or\nlike a glass of wine with a lot of\nfamilies do for us it was always tea\nyeah yeah\nand for me it was you know and i loved\nthat i remember that literally after\nevery meal in brady's family\nyeah someone would come and be like what\ntea does everyone when i was like this\nis like this is a real thing yeah and in\nmy life it was slightly different\nbecause we discovered this when we got\ntogether we had this in common but for\nme\ni remember that\nmy\nparents would my mom would drop me off\nat daycare and i'd be at daycare for\ni don't know whatever the early stages\nand early years of my life were and my\nmom would always come and pick me up and\ni remember my parents were both busy\nboth my parents worked busy jobs\nfull-time\nmy mom would have to come and pick me up\nfrom daycare or if i went home with\na friend's mom and then she'd pick me up\nand then take me home\nand my parents were working hard when we\ngrew up they were both immigrants they\nmoved to\nmy mom moved to london when she was 16\nyears old and they started with nothing\nand i'd always find that when she'd\npicked me up we'd always come home and\nshe'd put a cup of tea on and give me a\ncup of tea and that moment of just us\nhaving a little sympathy together\nit would usually be either chamomile or\nmint and those are the most common\nflavors that we'd have\nbut this is my favorite on sunday\nshe'd make me a chai\ni'm surprised it's not like a masala tea\ni was only allowed that once a week and\nit would be on the weekend in the\nmorning and my mom would get those\nindian biscuits out yeah\nyeah yeah exactly and we get those and\ni'd only get them on like a sunday\nmorning and then we'd dip them in the\nchai together\nand we'd get to have it and it was it\nwas literally something i looked forward\nto so\nwhen we got married\nand you'd always ask me oh what t-shirt\nwe have do you want tea even in the\nmorning when we meditate you're always\nwhen i get up in the morning and i come\nto the room to meditate you're always\nsitting there with your cup of tea while\nyou meditate and\nteen one hand beads in the other\nand even when i lived as a monk tea was\nthe only drink that we drank like a\nbreakfast or a dinner and so i think tea\nis such a\ni want everyone to realize this isn't a\ntea it's not a brand it's not a company\nit's like it's actually a tool for\nmindfulness it's actually a tool for\npresence\nand it's natural from the scent and you\nknow i mean we were smelling these\nearlier i know she's gonna take a moment\nyeah no i completely agree even even\nduring the day sometimes when i'm\nfeeling a little bit overwhelmed and i\ngo to get a drink usually if i'm feeling\na little bit stressed i'll always pick a\ntea to just sit down with for a moment\nand also because it's hot you don't rush\nit when it's cold water when it's like a\ndrink from the fridge you gulp it down\nand you could be done with it within a\nminute whereas with hot tea you have to\nbe patient with it you have to be you\nknow you have to take your time getting\nthrough it and you know with teas the\ntaste also changes as you brew it longer\nso there's so much to experience within\nthat you know one cup yeah i love what\nyou said everything from the sight to\nthe scent\nto the sound i talk a lot about how we\nhave to use all of our senses for me\nit's like when we were working on these\nteas we wanted the color to captivate to\nyou we wanted to send herbs inside\nthe taste the layers and so\nyou know for us this isn't a tea it's\nnot a brand it's not a company it's a\nmindful moment it's a tool of presence\ni want to talk a bit about before we\ndive into all the teas and the flavors\nand the herbs and tell everyone about\nthat i want to talk a bit about\nuh what we learned about each other\nduring this process so i'm going to ask\nyou what did you learn\nabout me and our relationship during\nthis process you sure you want me to\nstart\nyou've always been from since i've known\nyou even if you didn't know how to do\nsomething you figured out how to do\nsomething and i think just seeing you\ni've never really been in close\nproximity with you when you've been\ndoing a lot of your work like i don't\nprobably know half of what goes on in\nyour work life but being part of\nsomething with you allowed me to also\nsee something that i already kind of\nknew but to see in action\num you're so like proactive you really\nyou just know how to get things done and\nlike to\nthink outside of the box and you you\nknow what the main thing is you think so\nbig and i think that's what's really\ncool like you're never just like oh yeah\nmaybe we'll do it this first and then\nwe'll take baby steps together you're\nlike no i'm going all in and you're\nalways you have always been an all-in\ntype of person and it's just cool to see\nit you know seep through to every part\nof your life including sama too um but\nyou know just like that was work and\nthen we would have our time it was just\nyeah it didn't feel you think we were\ngood at drawing the line i think so i\ndon't felt like i feel like it was any\npressure sometimes you'd be like did you\nreply to the summer email oh did you\nreply to this have you done this i was\nlike yes i have and then i'd be like in\nthe corner\nlike yeah i replied to it like last week\num\nbut apart from that i don't think he did\nyou're also very good with trying not to\nmanage me\nlike you are good at you know because\ni'm also feisty where there's not gonna\nit's not gonna be beneficial for you to\ntry and manage me it's just not so you\nwere like you know i'm just gonna leave\nit to the team to do that i'm just gonna\nfocus on my bit because\nit's never gonna go well for you is it i\njust try to get ruler and jordan to bug\nyeah exactly\nuh yeah no i i think what i learned\nabout you\nagain which i already knew but so i have\nto be honest with everyone my favorite\nthing in the world is doing something\nlike i was telling it this morning i was\njust like this is gonna be the best day\nof my week because i love hanging out\nwith her all day and after this we're\ngonna be making some fun tick tocks and\nstuff together as well and i literally\nlike look forward to spending time with\nriley in my work day so for me\nthis is like the highlight of you know\nso much for me because if i can spend a\nwhole day with radhi and that's work\nthat's not work to me\nand so that that's a big thing which i\nloved and enjoyed\nand and i feel that because and it's\npartly what you said and this is what i\nwant to talk about is\nradhi doesn't make anything feel like\nwork because i don't think she knows\nwhat work is\nand so\nshould i be offended no it's a\ncompliment and i'll explain what i mean\nby that like taradi a meeting\neven filming this right now the podcast\nshe doesn't treat it as work so\nshe sees it as fun she sees it as her\nexpressing herself she sees it as her\njust sharing openly and honestly and so\nwhat ends up happening is you kind of\nget to be a part of that environment and\ni can often be very disciplined and\nfocused and driven and ambitious and\nlike i know what needs to get done by\nthis time and which is all great and\nwhich is all needed too definitely but\nwhen people say like how do couples get\nalong we get along because we're not we\ndon't think the same yeah and instead of\ntrying to and this is what's really\nstuck out to me\ninstead of trying to make my partner\nthink like me\nand live like me i've realized that the\nmost powerful thing you can do is\nrespect your partner for who they are\nand let them live that way yeah because\nwhat we don't realize is if i say rather\nyou need to be more organized and you\nneed to be more focused then i would\nlose the spontaneity which is what i\nlove about you right and i think that's\nwhere people get really lost and\nconfused where it's like i want you to\nbe organized not realizing that that\nactually makes you lose the quality that\ni love right and so same with you if you\nwere like jay i want you to be more\nrelaxed yeah more\nyou know but i also want you to plan our\nlife yes exactly yeah i want you to know\nwhere we're going and what we're doing\nbut i want you to be more laid back yeah\nyeah yeah you can't you won't get both\nand so i think we're either trying to\nmake our partners like us yeah and to be\nhonest\nlet's just put this out there\nno one in the world would be happy if\nthey dated themselves oh my gosh\nabsolutely not i'd be a nightmare\nto myself like i wouldn't be able\nbecause nothing would ever get like the\nthing is i know and we also work in that\nway where like i can be you're very\ncreative anyway but also i find my mind\nworks\nyou can be a 50 50 person i think i'm\nprobably like a 80 20 person where like\ni can be super creative and be really\nlike i can think of things on the spot\nof like things that i want to do or you\nknow fun stuff to to\ninvent stuff in my mind but to actually\nmake it happen i need someone to do that\num and so you're very good at like you\nsaid getting things done and i feel i\nfeel we have different things that we\nbring to the table and we're both very\nokay with that yeah yeah well i think\nthat's been another one like our\nstrengths like we our spiritual teacher\nonce called rather a food scientist\nand it was the best compliment that\nanyone had ever\ngiven or could have given because not\nonly was it from the person who's so\ndear to us\nit was also just\nthe perfect words yeah and since that\nday i've always been like well you're\nsuch a food scientist you're such a food\nand it's so true because radhi's really\nbeen our potions master with these tears\nand i've been doing a few interviews\nabout the teas and people keep asking me\nlike how did you guys come up with this\nstuff like men and blueberry and jasmine\npizza who thought of this and i don't\nget to take the credit because it's\nalready she's the one who knew even\nbefore we made a blend she knew which\nmixtures were going to work and to me\nthat's mind-blowing that she already\nknew what was going to taste good\ntogether what was going to enhance\nflavors\nand so you're such a deep expert in what\nyou do\nand i respect you so much for it because\nit's a real art and if someone asked me\ni would just be like i know that tastes\ngood but i don't know why yeah whereas\nyou're so good at making stuff tasty and\nhealthy and good for you and i think\nthat that's a really unique skill set so\nwe also have such a great team didn't we\noh my gosh yeah that's through all of\nyou yeah let's talk a bit about them\nyeah i feel like there's there's one\nthing to think something's gonna be good\nand\nand to\nto believe it is but you know they\nreally made it happen and they really\nthey enhanced it all it was like even if\ni thought of the ingredients like they\nwork to figure out the blends and to get\nthe right proportions and\num\nyeah even with the adaptogens i thought\ni only you know i have a very limited\nknowledge of my adaptogens or even of my\nayurvedic knowledge but the people that\nwe were working with they found the\nexperts that would really know like hey\nwhy don't you try this and why don't you\nthere was so much that i learned through\nthis process from experts from people\nwho we were working with and um\nso many of them i mean you start off\ni'll follow yeah so i'll talk first\nabout kim kim uh so kim and james why\nlegends first of all yeah our\nco-founders who are\nabsolutely incredible\nand just the sweetest humans too you\nknow people has kim been on the podcast\nshe's coming on actually\nyeah yeah she's got a new book coming\nwait till you all feel her energy yeah\nshe is a whole vibe yeah she's amazing\nbut\nshe just\nyou know people are often scared and and\nby the way raleigh and i have never\nhad business partners before and never\nand co-founders and gone and built\nsomething so this was our first time in\nthat side of our life too and people are\noften scared of finding investors\nand partners because it can seem\ndaunting it can seem quite scary you're\nlike who can i trust and i have to just\nhonestly say that working with kim and\njames is a dream like they're not only\nreally smart successful people in their\nown journeys and in their own right\nbut they're also just some of the\nsweetest kindest hearted like loving\nhumble people that you'll ever meet like\nthey are the experts but they would take\nour opinion our\neverything like they they were so open\nto feedback so open to us sharing our\nown thoughts even though they are the\nexperts in the field and i just think\nthat that was so beautiful to see that\nlike it taught me so much about how\nto to act in in that environment when\nbuilding something yeah absolutely and\nit was kim who was saying to me she was\njust like jay i think\nyou know when we first met well sorry\ndon't worry we first met we've known\neach other for a few years but we'd\ncontinue the conversation she was like\njay like people need to have something\nin their homes in their life yeah i\nremember that can help them feel better\nand it needs to be beyond\ncontent or technology or device based it\nneeds to be beyond all of that and so\nshe was such a big inspiration\nand i want to tell that story actually\nwhere we decided that\nobviously based on our own experience\ntea was the one thing we consumed daily\nwho decided on that was you\nit was you yeah it was you i don't\nremember i'm pretty sure it was you i'm\nsure it was just a brainstorming no i\nthink it was yeah\n[Music]\nin our first apartment in l.a okay and\nwe were talking you were sitting on the\nedge of the kitchen table yeah and i was\nsaying to you i was like you know what\ndo we think and improve people's lives\nthat we both consume that we both love\nthat that we think is genuinely going to\nimprove people's well-being but also be\neasy to do\nand we were thinking about and we're\nlooking at what do we use what do we\ndon't use and we're talking about skin\ncare yeah\nabout candles yeah we were talking about\nthings like that yeah yeah but then and\nthen\nt was just so strong for both of us\nand\nand then we spent time obviously\nresearching the name but you know what\nyou could have easily taken the credit\nfor because i had no idea but i\nappreciate it it was you it was you i'm\nlike 99.9 shows\nbut kim and james have been incredible\nand then we had uh tiana and alexander\nalex\nyeah 100 co team jamison\nuh becky with the design then of course\nmy team ruler jordan\nuh just you know so dedicated to the\ncourse making sure that we actually like\ntake time out to taste the blends and\nlike which there was so that's the other\nthing right all of the team were so\ninvested in getting like no one wanted a\nmediocre tea like it wasn't about just\ngetting a t out there we went through\neach blend how many times we've done\nblend one a one b one c one d one e one\nf one z like there's been blends on\nblends on blends and you know\nslight alterations but we did not want\nit to go out until we had tasted it and\nit and until we all felt that it was\nlike this is the tea that we would\nchoose over any of the tea in our\ncupboard and until that until we felt\nthat way we didn't want to let let it\nout and so i think that was was so nice\nthere was no one in the team that was\nlike oh let's just do this like it's\nfine you know next time we'll get it\nright this was like no everybody was so\ninvested in giving people the best\nexperience yeah and we do these tea\ntasting parties where the whole team\nwould get together\nuh alex would steep the tea bring it all\nout mini cups we'd all like write down\nour feedback and that whole process was\nso fun because again it was community\nlike this tea has been made from the\nsame value\nthat we want you to feel and all of us\nwould come together we'd give feedback\neveryone was very open and honest like\nyou said like i remember you'd be like\nwe just want to dial up this\nyeah it was like dealt this down about\nlike five percent and yeah we were\ngetting down to like minor tweaks but\nall\neverything that made such a difference\nyeah and that was the same with the\nbranding by the way like we've had so\nmuch amazing feedback\nabout the colors and the branding and i\nsee you i i want to show people what it\nlooked like first at some point at some\npoint at some point at some point but\njust to show how\nyou can set off with a specific thing in\nmind and\nand sometimes what happens is you end up\ntrying to create a like if you're\ncreating a product for example what i\nfound is i kept wanting it to be almost\nso different from me like i was trying\nto be like a sophisticated version i was\ntrying to give people a sophisticated\nversion of me a version of me that's\nlike elevated to a certain degree and\nthat they have in their homes is like an\nart piece or you know whatever it was\nthat they\nand then i realized that if i want if we\nwant us to go into people's home then it\nhas to represent us and and what we\nrealized from the first branding we did\nit lacked fun it lacked excitement it\nlacked enjoyment when you're like it was\nbeautiful like that's what it was it was\nbeautiful and it was subtle and it was\nsleek but it didn't have much of us\nwritten on it and that's why i think\nit's so easy to um\nyeah it was just so nice that we finally\ngot to a point where we were like no we\nwant it to be vibrant we want it to be\nexciting we want it to be like a party\nwhen when people receive it and i'm so\nglad that we did that yeah i think i'm\nso glad you brought that up because\ni think there's a great lesson in that i\nthink if you're out there right now if\nyou're listening or watching\nif you're trying to build a brand start\na business launch a podcast\nlaunch an instagram or youtube channel\nmake it you yeah like infuse it with\nyour natural authentic energy i don't\neven know how i would how i would have\nlike shared the tea if it was that\nbecause it didn't feel like you're so\nright it's like i feel so excited\nsharing it because it feels like it\nfeels like an extension of me and of you\nand so it's so natural to talk about it\nto be excited about it because i am\nexcited about it but i think when it\nwhen it doesn't feel like you whether\nit's your instagram whether it's a\nproduct whether it's\ni don't know anything it's always going\nto be difficult to share because you\ndon't feel as connected to it yeah and i\nfeel like for us it was a really good\nreminder that it's okay to get it wrong\nyeah we went through this whole process\nthis whole branding process and we\nlooked at the final product and we were\nlike\nthat's not us like we were so scared\nbecause\nso much time into it a lot of us feel\nthat when you've invested a lot of time\ninto something that you can't change it\nwhat's that and it's a term in economics\ncalled sunk cost\nthe idea that you have sunk so much cost\nmoney\ntime yes you've sunk so much time energy\nmoney into something then now you feel\nyou have to stick with that because\notherwise you're going to waste more\ntime money and energy now what we don't\nrealize\nis that actually the deeper you go\nthe less you like the product\nand the more you actually develop some\nsort of indifference to it whereas if\nyou shift you can actually create\nsomething you care about and so failing\npivoting trying again these are all\nreally great lessons\ni think that's the thing right when\nthat's a great point because i think you\nnaturally think that it should just keep\ngoing in the same trajectory like oh\nwe've started in this way it's going to\nbe a smooth journey and i think what\nwhat i've learned from this and\nthroughout our life together is that\ntaking those\nthose side roads and taking a u-turn or\ntaking you know these different routes\nit's actually part of the journey like\nthat should be what is normality in our\nminds like that should not be what we're\nscared of that should be oh this is\nexpected like this is what the journey\nis it's never going to be just going\ndown a smooth silky road like it's not\ngoing to be that but i think we have\nthis illusion of what the journey looks\nlike being smooth that when that those\nhurdles come or those bumps come or\nthere's a closure in the road like you\njust you get thrown off but if we start\nseeing it as being as that being\nnormality you wouldn't even get thrown\nout you just see it as part of the\nexcitement and part of the part of the\njourney i love that online yeah our\nillusion is that we want it to be like a\nhighway\nit's a one-way accident but it's going\nto have side streets it's going to have\naccidents actually highways are\napparently the place where most amount\nof accidents happen\nthank you for that\nno actually wait that's wrong\ni think actually the surprising thing\nfrom my drive this is so off topic but\nfrom my driving thing was uh when i did\nit when i took my trip\nthe one thing i remember from when i\ntook my when i had when i got ticket and\ni had to go to a course was that most\naccidents happen on\n30 mile per hour roads right this is not\nuseful\nit's totally useless\nuse this information in case you're\ndoing youtube\nyou're you're driving exactly driving\ncourse for getting points on your\nlicense just\nyou have me to thank anyway\nyeah that's that's been a huge lesson so\nif you're listening or watching right\nnow and you're thinking of starting\nsomething yeah\nbe okay with pivoting yeah be okay with\na u-turn be okay with turning back\nrealize that that is just part of the\njourney stop living it thinking that\neverything's going to work and\neverything's going to be perfect yeah\nlike change that story in your mind from\nthe beginning right like don't if you're\nbuilding a story in your mind make sure\nyou you factor those things into the\nstory yeah exactly definitely and and if\nyou are going to start something with\nyour partner\ni think it's important that you set the\nboundaries up set the boundaries set the\nexpectations set the like and if this is\nthe first time that you're getting to\nknow one another because i think a lot\nof the work that a lot of the things\nthat we understood about one another we\nkind of\nhad a lot of it figured out beforehand\nlike you knew what type of personality i\nwas i knew what type of personality you\nwere\nbut for some people they may be just\ngetting to know their partner through\nthis process and so i think it's really\nit will be really useful to sit down and\nfigure out what that dynamic is like\nwhat do you feel you're bringing to this\nwhat do you feel that you're going to\nlack in this what do you feel are going\nto be your weaknesses or your strengths\nduring this and oh let me see are those\nweaknesses going to be my strengths or\ndo we have the same weaknesses and the\nsame strengths and therefore we need\nanother person that's going to make up\nfor that um i think all of that is so\nimportant yeah and and it is true like\nwhat riley was saying earlier there were\ntimes\nwhen i got really frustrated because i\nfelt like i was bugging radhi or having\nto remind her to do stuff that she had\nto do and that would genuinely annoy me\nbecause i was like well i'm i'm doing my\nbit here like i'm getting back onto\nemails on time and i'm responding to\nthis on time like why can't you\nand i realized that that's a common\nthing that can really end up creating\nfriction in a relationship and so the\nonly way to deal with that is make sure\nthat you're not the person doing that to\nyour partner\nespecially in your personal time yeah\nyou can do that if you're on work time\nand so i think for us it was very\nimportant to say we're\non work time yeah or we're on personal\ntime this is a professional conversation\nthis is a personal yeah this is us just\ntalking about it creatively and this is\nus talking about it to get things done\ntotally and i think that if you are\ngoing to get into business with a friend\nor a partner or a or a husband or wife\nor whoever it is you really want to be\nclear about is this conversation on\npersonal time or professional time\nbecause that saves you so much stress\nand so much energy\nand and also just stops you from ruining\nyour relationship like i think that\nmaking summer has brought us closer\ntogether because it's the first time as\nyou said we've created something truly\ntogether\nand i wouldn't have wanted it to tear us\napart but it could have yeah if we\nweren't mindful of those things not\nunderstanding yeah yeah totally\nall right so now\ni want you rather to give us a walk\nthrough off of all of your potions all\nof the teas yeah all of the blends and\nexplain to us the benefits\nthe ingredients that you chose the\nreason why you chose them you know i'd\nlove love to let me break it down for\nyou okay so these teas are hot tea\nthey're not cold\nbut they're not eyes they're also not\njust herbal teas we do have some teas\nthat are caffeinated\ngreen tea black teas green teas but we\nbut predominantly they are herbal teas\nand the thing that i love about them is\ni really wanted there to be a unique\nfactor but the unique factor i wanted to\nbe authentically unique like i wanted it\nto do what it says it does and so what\nwe decided was to include an adaptogen\nin each of the teas now that's an\nadaptogen that's a very good question j\nshetty well an adaptogen for all of you\nwho don't know is um\nit's basically uh something extracted\nfrom a plant or a herb that has this\nunique quality to adapt to your body to\nwhat it needs so it adapts to the\nstresses of your body whether it's\nphysical whether it's mental whether\nit's emotional um whether it's they\nsound like amazing things i know and\nit's phenomenal because each of these\nadaptogens they work in different ways\nso whether it's to do with regulating\nyour hormones whether it's to do with\nregulating your stress whether it's to\ndo with um\nregulating your mood your sleep so they\nhave i mean the scientists or her\nbotanists they have figured out what\nplants are beneficial for different\nparts of our body for different parts of\nour our life and so um what we did was\nwe focused the teas specifically on\num\nfirst of all what we wanted people to\nfeel or how we wanted it to affect them\nthen we added in the flavor then we\nadded in um then we added in what\nadaptogen would do that so we really\nwere focusing on how do we want people\nto feel and what effect we want it to\nhave on the body and so um for example\nwe have um our awaken and energized\nthat's our earl grey tea and the\nadaptogen in here\nis um and again awakening energy so you\nknow what you're receiving when you're\ngetting the tea that's got um this one\nthey helped me with but the rishi\nmushroom i do know that's meant to be\nincredible for mind focus for your brain\nhealth and so we included that for the\nmorning just to get you going then we\nhave a calm and relaxed so again we did\nchamomile very very like normal you've\nhad to come a multi but we've got\nlavender and rose in there the smell of\nthis one is beautiful it's just you know\nchamomile is something you think of when\nyou want to relax and lavender and rose\nespecially when you think of essential\noils or um\neven if you think of lavender rose it's\njust so peaceful and so that's exactly\nwhat this does we've got lavender\nchamomile and thorsi in here as well all\nof which are incredible to\nto soothe you\nharmonize you\nand then we have jasmine peach that's\nthe one that we're drinking right now\nyeah that's one of my favorites the\nsmell of this one is just beautiful and\nagain we've only used natural um\nflavorings and ingredients and no\nadditives we really wanted it to be\nnatural flavors in here\nand for this one we've got raspberry\nrelief shatarvari and green tea now\nshatavari this is protectant support and\nthat's exactly what chitavori does it um\nwhether it's for women's health or men's\nhealth it actually helps protect\neverything from our reproductive organs\nto um to our muscles to our ligaments\nlike so many things but it's it's a very\num supportive nourishing deeply\nnourishing um herb that goes deep down\nto our tissues yeah and there is another\none called mint in blueberry which\nrather is finished i drank it all and it\nwas so good and i've been drinking every\nday and suddenly i got to the last one\nand i was like oh no\nbut we need to get more of that but\nthat's mint and blueberry and it's just\nthat's the one with ashwagandha in it\nashwagandha is great for focus mind\nhealth\nand just being attentive yeah um there's\nall the blends and yeah like i said with\nthe adaptogens what we wanted was to\nactually make have a tea that if you\nhave the right amount of it like let's\nsay you have three cups of one of the\nteas it's not just\nthere for the name it will have the\nright if it's got the right quantity to\nhave the right effect on your body and\nthat's what we really wanted something\nthat's that's true to its name yeah and\nalso things that you need throughout the\nday like i usually wake up and i'll have\nthe lemongrass and ginger in the morning\nbecause it soothes my throat it makes me\nfeel\nstronger it gives me a sense of like\nstability and then throughout in the\nmiddle of the day i might want a jasmine\npeach because i'm looking for a bit of\nthat green tea yeah and then at the end\nof the day i want the lavender chamomile\nto help me rest and relax and so we\ndon't see tears like a once a day we see\nus like two three times a day and we\nwanted to create teas that you could\nhave around the clock at different times\nin the day we're also going to be\nsending a little menu card that tells\nyou what time to have we used to have\nwhen yeah because that's so important to\nus that\nyou have a simple and easy way of\nfeeling different you know sometimes i\nwalk into the home\nand i've come down from a busy day\nand i feel different when raleigh is\nbringing some tea\nbecause you can smell it and as soon as\nyou smell it your body almost reacts\nimmediately\nand then you drink it and like you said\nyou slow down to sip it and drink it and\nnow all of a sudden you feel completely\ndifferent whereas usually you're just\nrunning around from place to place to\nplace and you need something external to\nchange that and\nit's it that doesn't happen when you put\npump your body with sugar no it doesn't\nhappen when you pump your body with just\ncarbs or fats like you can't just\noutsource that and i also think what you\nwere saying that's so beautiful that you\nknow with something like this you're\ntelling your body what you want like\nyou're like oh i'm going to pick this\nand you're looking at the words on the\nyou know on the packet saying awaken and\nenergize like you are telling yourself\nthis is what i want from this drink this\nis what i want from this cup of tea this\nis what i want in my life right now and\nso you're choosing to adapt your mood\nyou're choosing to adapt your day in a\nway that's going to suit you and i think\nthat's really wonderful it's\nintentionally choosing how you want to\ngo forward for the next couple of hours\nyeah changing the way we talk to\nourselves is so important like we wake\nup in the morning and we'll say\nsomething like i'm tired\nand instead when you pick that up it\nsays i am awake and i wake up\nand that replacement of language not\nonly affects your mind it affects your\nbody it affects how you feel it affects\nhow you show up it affects how you take\nthat first phone call of the day or that\nfirst meeting i mean you just said tired\nand i owned yeah that's how contagious i\nknow\nlike the language of like i'm tired i'm\nexhausted i'm fatigued and i i fall into\nthe habit all the time where i'll say\ni'm so tired i'm exhausted i'm fatigued\nand instead i should be saying i'm going\nto make time to rest today exactly i'm\ngoing to make time to refuel today i'm\ngoing to take time to re-energize today\nand i find that tea kind of gives me\nthat reflection time that helps me pause\nand be still and go okay this is what i\nneed right yeah so in this whole process\nwe've just launched we've got a long way\nto go we're committed and all in on\nsummer because we love it so much we're\nso\nproud of the product we're so proud of\nhow it tastes and how it looks and how\nit feels\nwhat do you think surprised you the most\nor what was the biggest challenge you\nhad to overcome\nin this process and journey because\nwe've been working on this for like 12\nto 18 months now you know what if i'm\nhonest one i i honestly did not realize\nhow and this sounds so clear about how\nmuch work goes into it like how many\ndifferent elements there are to it and\nand how much thought has to go into so\nmany different areas of it that i never\nappreciated before because my mind was\nnot like i never even i never even\nunderstood the depths of creating a\nbrand or creating a company and so i\nreally appreciated how it made me\nappreciate other brands that have done\nsomething like this or or created\nsomething themselves that wow that took\na lot um and then the other thing\nhonestly that i found hard to overcome\nand i think that's something we're still\ngoing through is you know it's it's it's\na really interesting feeling trying to\nshare something that you've created um\nand trying to share it with people in\norder for like it's a product in the end\nof the day like people are buying it and\ni think you know when you do love love\nlove something so much like we do about\nsama and you want to share it with\npeople we do it and we do it as\nauthentically as we possibly can but at\nthe end of the day it's a product that\nyou are selling and so i think i always\nfind it hard to to push through that\nwhere i'm like oh i don't want it to\nfeel like too salesy like i don't want\nit to feel like i'm trying to sell them\nsomething but i know at the bottom of my\nheart that like this is something that's\ngoing to benefit their life in some way\nand so i think there's a really good\nbalance between sharing something from\nyour heart with authenticity that you\nlove\nbut also selling a product and i think\nthat's been a really interesting balance\nthat i think i'm still going through\nbecause we're still you know it's going\nto be it's going to be a constant up and\ndown with something like that and a give\nand take but\nyeah it's it's been a really interesting\nprocess and i think it's just something\nin in anything when you create something\nor even if you're part of a company if\nyou're part of something there is an\nelement of you are trying to share\nsomething with someone and when money\ngoes into it it can be a different you\nknow it's just a different mindset you\nhave to get into yeah i'm so glad you\nraised that i think it's a really\nhealthy conversation to have yeah\nyou know when you look at how much work\ngoes into something you realize that\nyou can only create stuff you care about\nyeah and so then when that goes out to\nthe market and then people buy it or\npurchase it and experience it and use it\nit's like all that work that's gone into\nit you wouldn't waste that much time if\nyou didn't really care you didn't really\nlove it you didn't really love it like\nthe amount of hours and effort that's\ngone into building sama like we wouldn't\nhave gone through with it if we didn't\ncare if you were only doing it for a\nfinancial reward\nit wouldn't be enough because it takes\nso much energy and you you also are a\npoint where you're like you don't really\nknow how well it's going to do like when\nyou start\nyou don't know how well it's going to do\nand so you are counting on being if\nyou're not fully invested in it with\nlove then there's always a chance of\ndisappointment but like in my mind i'm\nlike wow like i'm so happy that we've\ncreated something like this that i that\ni know that we love so much and that\nhopefully will benefit people in some\nway that i want to make it worth the\nmoney that they are spending like at\nleast i know i'm doing that at least i\nknow i've put in the most amount of\neffort putting the most amount of\nthought the most amount of energy that i\ncan so that when they do spend money\nhopefully it feels like money well well\nspent and i think that's all you can\nreally hope for when it's to do with the\nproduct that you are selling so well\nsaid i love that that's really beautiful\nyeah what about you\ni am very similar to you i think for me\nit's like i\ni created a plan a few years ago where i\ndo three things every year i do\nsomething i love\ni do something i'm learning yeah and i\ndo something i'm launching\nand i do the thing i love because it\nmakes me happy yeah and that's the\npodcast yeah i do the thing i'm learning\nbecause it helps me feel like i'm\ngrowing\nand i've been doing a lot of learning\nthis year\nand then i'm launching something because\nit makes me feel nervous and anxious but\nexcited yeah and so i think that's the\nbiggest thing for me it's like i love\ntrying out new things i love looking at\nnew industries and learning about new\nthings because it just expands me as a\nhuman it helps me have more love for\npeople it helps me have more compassion\nand empathy and understanding of people\nit helps me have more respect for people\ni guess someone was also learning and\nlaunching launching for you\nand i just really enjoyed that process\nso that has been a challenge because\nit's all new to me i've never done\nanything in the beverage industry\nwe've never we've never created a tea\nbefore oh no we've never created a i\nmean i have in my kitchen you have\nyou've actually made many times yeah\nthat's very true but i haven't yeah yeah\nand so for me to get comfortable with\nthat it's it's been such an amazing\nlearning curve so and there's so much\nmore than just the tea bag right like\nthat's what i realized like oh yeah i've\ncreated a tea in my kitchen before but\noh my goodness to create a brand from it\nthere's so much more than just that one\nlittle tea bag\nthat that actually allows it to expand\ninto something like this so yeah amazing\noh my gosh i know what we should do\ni think you know that's the other reason\ni love the word tea and we want to do\ntea because there are just so they're\nlike unlimited amount of things that you\ncould do with the word tea and i've\nlooked up so many tea puns since we\ndecided to do this so i think we should\ndo okay i'll come up with one that\nyou've come up with one and we have to\ngo keep going\na tee off\nlet's do a tee off and we have to keep\ngoing until\none of us fails okay go on then okay um\nspill the tea\nit's a
