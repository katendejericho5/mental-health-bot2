    "transcript": "we get seduced by the beliefs of the\npeople around us and we go from this on\nwonder and intimacy with our glory our\nprimal glory that's that's just the\nhuman condition and we start to forget\nwho we truly are and\nas our dreams start to fall apart and as\nwe lose that connection with our best\nselves and as we get sad and\ndisappointed\nand as we failed that's just part of\nlife a lot of us shut down and we don't\nknow how to process through that pain so\nwe repress it\n[Music]\nthank you so much for coming back to\nlisten i'm so grateful to have an\nincredible community like yourselves and\ni'm so excited to share today's\nconversation with you today's guest is\nrobin sharma widely considered one of\nthe top leadership and personal\noptimization coaches across the world\nhe's worked with fortune 100 companies\nworked with billionaires and sports\nsuperstars today he's here to talk about\nhis new book the 5 a.m club which is all\nabout owning your morning and elevating\nyour life for me he's been an\ninspiration from a distance for\npotentially over about 10 to 15 years\ni've been reading his work studying his\nlife i'm so grateful that i get to sit\nwith him today robin thank you so much\nit's really my pleasure and honor to\nhave you in my home thank you\njay um it's it's my pleasure and thank\nyou for your generous words and i have\nto congratulate you for your amazing\nsuccess and impact on so many people\nthank you i'm so grateful for that so\ni'm so excited to talk about your new\nbook today the 5am club i love talking\nabout the book because if you're\nwatching at home you're watching your\nwork wherever you are if you like\ntoday's conversation i really urge you\nto go and get the book it's really a\nlife's work put into a very small\nsegment but the question i want to start\nwith today is\nwhat was your morning routine before you\njoined and created the 5 am club i don't\nthink i've ever been asked that question\nand it's a great question\ni\ni still got up early\ni've always studied the great women and\nmen of the world and one thing they had\nin common they were early risers\nand so i didn't get up at five o'clock\nbut i was still an early riser jay i've\nalways had a fire in my belly i've\nalways wanted to serve i've always\nwanted to optimize myself\nbut really my life transformed\nwhen i discovered this 5 a.m routine and\nas you might know i've been working with\nbillionaires and you know many of the\nmost successful people on the planet for\nover two decades\nand one of the things if not the single\nbest thing that i've helped them with is\ndialing in their morning routine because\nthe way you begin the day sets up the\nway the day unfolds and consistently\ngreat mornings cascade into amazing days\ngreat days build great weeks quarters\nmonths and years so i i often say that\nthe 5 a.m club and the 20 20 20 formula\nwhat that the book is based on is the\nmother of all routines you get that one\nhabit right and everything else\nescalates right and specifically why\nfive not four not six not three not\nseven why five well i hear you um\nthe 5 am club i first wrote about it in\nthe month who who's oldest ferrari and\nit just stuck and it just people\nresonated with it but\nyou're right i mean if you look at the\ngreat sages and saints of the world as\nyou know you were a monk\nthey had one thing in common and they\nunderstood the pristine hours before the\nsunrise\nhave a magic to it\nand we live in a world where a lot of\npeople this is right out of the book an\naddiction to distraction is the death of\ncreative production there are a lot of\ncyber zombies on the planet there are a\nlot of people on the planet right now\ngiving the best hours of their finest\ndays to the white screen of\nattractions\nand i i really think that\nbetraying your genius every single\nperson on the planet has primal genius\nwithin them that's scientifically proven\nwe can talk about it i go into it in the\nbook\nbut playing with your phone versus\npursuing your monuments of mastery is\nbetraying not only yourself i think it's\nbetraying the world and so i really\nbelieve and i've experienced it for two\ndecades with my clients getting up at 5\na.m and running this calibrated 20 20 20\nformula that much of the book is about\nwill take any human being to a new level\nof creativity productivity prosperity\nand service to humanity let's dive into\nthat 2020 as you mentioned it twice\nalready let's break it down for the\naudience listening\nsure so it's it's it's it's simple\num you get up at five\nand people go i'm not a morning person\num you know mom couldn't get up at five\ngrandpa couldn't get up before the sun i\ndon't have early rising jeans i can't\nwin the battle of the bed\nhere's what the science confirms from\nuniversity college of london\nany new skill can be installed with 66\ndays of practice\nand so\na lot of people we all can change we all\ncan embrace the 5 a.m club and join the\nclub\nso we start our days well we just don't\ngive it enough time so the first thing\nis make a commitment for 66 days to\ninstall this habit said that intention\ncompletely it's otherwise it's like i\nwant to learn italian i tried it for six\ndays and i'm not fluent i guess i'm not\nthe kind of person who can speak italian\nright so now you know what do you do\nover these 66 days of habit installation\nwell it's the 20 20 20 formula\nvery quickly\ni get into it deeply in the book but\nit's the first 20 minutes the first\npocket is called move\nwhy\nbecause when you sweat first thing in\nthe morning you release bdnf brain\nderived neurotrophic factor which\nincreases the processing ability of your\nbrain you release dopamine that's the\ninspirational neurotransmitter\nyou probably know this jay you wake up\nfirst thing in the morning cortisol your\nfear hormone is\nhighest work out first thing in the\nmorning you actually increase your\nmetabolic rate and energy as an\nentrepreneur business builder empire\nmaker history maker energy is even more\nvaluable than your intellect so that\nfirst 20 minute pocket it's now 5 20.\nyou're on fire you release serotonin\nyou're happy even if you're cranky i\nmean what's that worth then the second\npocket of the 20 20 20 formula it's all\nabout reflection\nwe live in a world where there are a lot\nof people who are busy being busy but\nwhat's the point of being busy around\nthe wrong things just just imagine\ngetting to the end of the year\nend of your career\nlast day of your life and you say you\nknow\ni was incredibly focused but i climbed\nthe wrong mountains\nso the second 20 minute pocket\nyou can reflect and you can write about\nyour you can ground in your values you\ncan meditate you can\nvisualize and we know about epigenetics\nwe can talk about that but as you start\nvisualizing you actually step into the\nhigher version of yourself and i love\nwriting in a journal i did it before i\ncame here today i wrote out a written\nprayer of you know serving and making a\ndifference for all your followers from\naround the world so the second minute\nthe second is you anchor for the second\n20 minutes and then the final pocket is\nall about\ngrowth you know the billionaires i work\nwith have one common denominator and\nthat's they're curious\nand they have a white belt mentality\neven though they're some of the most\nfamous people in the world and so\nthe sec the final uh pocket is about\nreading studying developing your skills\nand most importantly developing yourself\ni love how you've simplified it into\nwhat can be achieved in an hour because\nit seems manageable it seems realistic\nand the beautiful thing is that anything\nthat starts working for people they can\nthen stretch that section so i'm sure\nyou've seen that the people that you've\nworked with sometimes that exercise will\ngrow from 20 to 40 minutes or maybe even\nmore that reflection period grows or\nhave you seen that it actually stays\ntight to that 20 20 20. oh you're\nabsolutely right jay that you know i\ncall the 20 20 20 formula the minimum\nviable morning routine it's going to\nwork it's going to give you the energy\nit's going to bring on your fire it's\ngoing to help\nanother thing it's not only going to\nallow you exponential creativity and\nproductivity\nbut in the 5m club i say tranquility is\nthe new luxury\nso whether you're a homemaker a\nprofessional athlete an entrepreneur a\npizza builder maybe that's not the term\nof art\nbut you do your best work\nwe have our greatest impact and we are\nmost true to our best selves when we're\ntranquil\npeaceful and serene and that's another\nvalue of joining the 5 a.m club because\nthose hours before the sun rises are the\nmost peaceful magical quiet period of\nthe day and if we can anchor in who we\ntruly want to be before we go out into a\nmessy world well we're going to\nfundamentally behave differently\nabsolutely because so much of our lives\nwe just get up and we start doing right\nwe start doing before being and that\ndisconnect creates so many challenges\nbut i've got a really interesting\nquestion that that sparked me when i was\nresearching and reading through your\nbook you've worked with\nsports superstars billionaires what was\ntheir biggest block as a pattern that\nyou saw to the 5am club like what was\nthe pattern of the block it's the same\nblock we all have jay\ni believe that potential unexpressed\nturns to pain\nand\nwhen we are born\nwe're born as children into awe and\nwonder\nadults are nothing more than\ndeteriorated children\nbut as we leave the perfection of\nchildhood where we're intimate with our\ngifts and our talents and on wonder our\nparents doing their best say you want to\nbe an astronaut be practical then we go\nto school and we say i want to be a rock\nstar and i want to be an actor and i\nwant to be jay shetty when i grow up\nand they say oh no no he's a different\nkind of cut from a different cloth than\nyou and we we\nget seduced by the beliefs of the people\naround us and we go from this on wonder\nand intimacy with our glory our primal\nglory that's that's just the human\ncondition and we start to forget who we\ntruly are and\nas our dreams start to fall apart and as\nwe lose that connection with our best\nselves and as we get sad and\ndisappointed\nand as we failed that's just part of\nlife a lot of us shut down and we don't\nknow how to process through that pain so\nwe we repress it and so the great sports\nsuperstars or the billionaires i work\nwith or the you know companies like\nstarbucks fedex nike ibm when i work\nwith their leadership teams what i do is\ni help them\nmove through that well of blockage\nwithin themselves because\nin the book there's a very disruptive\nmodel\nand it's called the four interior\nempires and just really quickly so many\npeople are talking about mindset would\nyou agree\nabsolutely everything is mindset\nif you just dial in your mindset you're\ngoing to go out there and you're going\nto change the world well here's here's\nwhat that model is about i i think\nmindset is only 25 of the personal\nmastery equation yep and here's why it's\nvery important to have a great mindset\nthat's your psychology you want to wire\nin the beliefs of world class no\nquestion\nbut a great psychology\nwith a broken heart or heart full of\npain\nif you haven't forgiven\nthe unforgiven if you're stuck in the\npast you can read the books and go to\nthe courses and get a great mindset\nyou're all on fire but you sabotage\nyourself because your emotional life is\ntoxic\nso it's not just mindset there's a\nsecond word i'm introducing which is\nit's going to transform people it's\nheart set but it's not only purifying\nyour heart set you want to\ncalibrate your mindset\npurify your heart set and then it's this\nother word i'm introducing health set\nthat's the third interior empire because\nif you want to change the world don't\ndie\nright you know yes so one of the keys to\nlegendary is longevity and there's a lot\nof the book on how to how the best in\nthe world the great geniuses manage\ntheir vitality so they were like in\ntheir 90s still rocking their craft so\nit's mindset heart set health set which\nis your physical life and here's a key\nthat i think will resonate with you it's\nthe fourth interior empire is your soul\nset yes now some of your listeners from\nacross the planet will go well i'm a\nbusiness builder or i want creativity\nproductivity why are we talking about\nsoul so well\nif your ego is running the day you're\nnever going to go out there and change\nthe world you know a bad day for the ego\nis an awesome day for the soul so\nworking on your soul sets so you are a\ntitan of humanity and you're\nintimate with your highest nature and\nyou're wiring in the great values and\nyou're living for a cause that's bigger\nthan yourself that's what allows you to\ngo out in the world and move through\nfailures and really own your domain so\nthose four interior empires\nonce you work on those\nyou go out in the world\nand automatically everything you touch\nis golden love that you brought the four\ntogether in the book and it's it's it's\nso fascinating having this conversation\nright now because you're answering so\nmany questions already that i had which\nis which is beautiful to see because\nthat was one of the big things for me is\nhow you've managed to\nexpand on not just settling for mindset\nyeah because as we all know in our\npersonal experience that that doesn't do\nthe trick and i completely agree with\nyou that's something i'm really\nfascinated by right now is\nhealing people's childhoods yeah like i\nfeel like healing that emotional you\nknow the heart set that you're speaking\nabout being able to give up that baggage\nthat comes from our childhood\nexperiences our our backgrounds where we\ngrew up the types of friends we had in\nour teens you know all that baggage\nthat's just accruing year upon year and\nand i really feel that you break that\ndown really well in the book so anyway\nwhere i want to dive in\nis around a lot of people listening\nmaybe thinking\njay i've been trying to work on my\nhealth for a while i've been trying to\nwork on my mindset\nyou know i know i've got emotional stuff\nto deal with and yeah i'm kind of\ngetting to that soul set right like like\nyou said like i'm not i'm not even sure\ni'm there yet\nhabit formation you talk about the habit\nformation protocol right you talk about\nactually building habits and i\npersonally feel that\nbuilding and breaking habits should have\nbeen the first thing we learned at\nschool because it feel it feels like the\nthing that affects our whole lives i\nlook at any change and it's always about\nhabits walk us through your approach to\nbuilding and breaking habits absolutely\nand i totally agree with you jay they\nteach us history and they teach us\narithmetic they teach us geography and\nthey teach us\nyou know whatever other language is in\nschool\nwhy don't they teach us\nbefore interior empires why don't they\nteach us\nyou said something very powerful\nwhy don't they teach us how to work\nthrough wounds you don't get invited to\na birthday party in fifth grade there is\na wound there you lose a love when\nyou're 16.\nthere is a wound there you start a\nbusiness when you're 22.\nthere is trauma there and i think that\nis in many ways the missing link in\nleadership and personal mastery and\nthat's really you know i'm passionate\nabout the 5am club\nbecause i get into that in in the book\nand i worked four years on the book but\nit's really 22 years of my my\nlearnings and teaching in the book and\nthat is a missing link because\neveryone's talking about psychology and\npeople are talking about habits and i'll\nanswer your question of course\nbut what about dealing with trauma you\nknow carl young said we all have this\nshadow side i mean we all have this well\nof repressed pain and anyone who's\nlistening who goes well that's not me\nit's subconscious so a lot unless you've\ndone the work you don't even know about\nit\nbut it's that pain and self-loathing and\nself-hatred\nin the 5-m club i say you know we have a\nmagic inside of us the saints call it\nthe light or god or nature or\nluminosity\nand what happens is when you do the work\nto\nrelease your toxic beliefs and move\nthrough your pain and how do you do it\nyou just feel it\nand as you feel through all the toxicity\nand the hurt and the wounding and the\ndisappointment that's called a human\njourney\nwhat is left as you release it\nyou access your light you access your\nprimal genius\nyou access creativity you're productive\nbecause you don't have all this\nemotional baggage you're carrying\nthrough the day you've you know\ni believe that the real artist the real\nkey to success is joy and inner peace\nlike that's why a lot of the\nbillionaires they have all the things\nand they're not happy\nyou\nour nature is joy peace bliss\nlove\nand when you release that trauma\nit just shows up because that's who we\ntruly are so yes we should we should\nteach i wish they were teaching this in\nschool and then our leaders would be\npure leaders like nelson mandela\nand mother teresa and mahatma gandhi and\ni'd love to talk about those heroes\nbecause as you know that last chapter is\nabout that and we all we all can be\nheroes but on uh habit\ninstallation\nso the research as i mentioned at\nuniversity college of london says it\ntakes 66 days for any human being to\nwire any in a habit and we all have a\ngift called neuroplasticity so we all\ncan do it and then the model i i share\nin the book is called the habit\ninstallation protocol and basically it's\n22 days called installation excuse me\ncalled destruction\nto to get up early you've got to destroy\nyour old neural patterns and emotional\nsignatures of getting up later\nthat doesn't happen in an instant all\nchange is hard at first messy in the\nmiddle gorgeous at the end so that first\ndestruction phase is 22 days there's\nnothing wrong society says it's hard so\nit's bad i'm suggesting it's hard so\nit's good that's what real change is as\nyou with that awareness you can stay\nwith it and get into the second phase\nwhich is\ninstallation\nand that's like a house renovation which\nis messy and that's why change is messy\nin the middle\nyour old pathways and ways of being are\nfalling apart but you know this because\ni sense you have a very deep grounding\nin that middle part you have to\nin some ways let go of who you were it's\ncalled a dark night of the soul\nso for 22 days it's it's messy in the\nmiddle because you're letting go of who\nyou were that's not easy and that's why\nhabit installation you need to have some\nbravery but that's only 22 days stay\nwith it because then you get to the\nthird phase which is implementation so\ndestruction integration implementation\nwell now we're on the short roads and\nthe neuroplasticity has kicked in and\nthe researchers call it automaticity you\nwill every human being can get to a\nplace 66 days later approximately where\nit actually gets easier to get up at 5am\nthan just stay in the bed and the point\nis it's called automaticity and that's\nit you know\nwe all have that ability we just need to\nstay with that three-stage process for\n66 days yeah and i think that's really\nsmart advice anyone who's listening\nright now\ni just want you to know that\nwith the depths that robin can go to i'm\nlike torn between trying to help him\nanswer tactical questions because i know\nthey're going to benefit you today and\nthen so\nthere's always two things in my world\nthere's existential questions and\ncircumstantial questions and with robin\nyou can go and do both so i'm i'm i'm in\nthat middle ground right now of going\nbetween tactics and soul tactics and\nsoul\nso i'm enjoying that because i want\npeople listening to get something really\npractical or tactical stuff that they\ncan start tomorrow which the book is\nfull of but at the same time you can\nspeak to the soul robin like you can\nreally\ngo deep you were just speaking about our\nnatural nature right habit change in a\nmuch more mature way than just hey start\nthis on day one and start this on day\ntwo so forgive me if i'm going in\nbetween the two but i'm doing it because\ni'm trying to win for both the audience\nlong term and short term well you know i\ni wish your audience was in the room\nhere with us because i feel what you\njust said and i know you want to go deep\nand yet i know\nyou want people to get the 5 a.m method\nand you want them to get the 20 20\nformula and all those rituals and what i\nwould suggest we can touch on more of\nthem as you like\nif i may i suggest trust your instinct\nbecause it's always wiser than your\nintellect and let's go deep and i think\nit would be\nyou know your your followers\nlet's challenge them push them to the\njagged edges because they're smart\npeople absolutely absolutely no i\ncompletely agree and and i'm happy to do\nthat happy to do that let's let's go\nthere let's do that i'm all in let's\nlet's dive into the minds of the few\npeople you mentioned because i think\nthat's a nice place to start it's a nice\nkind of bridge over to that side you\njust mentioned nelson mandela you\nmentioned mother teresa and gandhi two\nof which i have pictures up on my wall\nbehind you\nmother trace is practic seems is so\nhumble that i can't find a picture of\nher like it's so hard to find a really\ngood picture of it i can get on my wall\nso\nspeak to me about those three\nindividuals and why you mentioned them\nwhen i grew when\nmy father is in his 80s\nhe's been an icon\nof\npossibility in my life\nand he retired recently after 54 years\nas a family physician and he said robin\ni said dad why did you stay in the game\nso long and he said because my patients\nneeded me\nhe's a man of service\nand he used to share a quote with me\nfrom rubin through nod to gore and it\nwas robin when you were born you cried\nwhile the world rejoiced\nhe said son live your life in such a way\nthat when you die\nthe world cries\nwhile you rejoice\nnow i've seen your work and you're doing\nan amazing job and\nsome of your posts are you know don't\nworry so much about likes and i think\nyou're right i think we're in a\nin a lost world in many ways\num\nand i don't think it's about likes and i\ndon't think it's about yachts and i\ndon't think it's about jets and are\nthose things wrong absolutely not we're\nwe're sensual human beings having a\njourney\nbut i think there's a different game\nthat the true legends and titans play\nand it's about joy enjoying the journey\nbut it's really about making an impact\non humanity and there's not one of your\nlisteners who can't do that whether it's\nif you work in a coffee shop or you're a\nteacher or you're a street sweeper we\nall have a calling on our lives to\nelevate those around us\nand so service has been very big to me\nmy life changed um on two occasions\nnumber one i sat in mother teresa's\nbedroom in calcutta now now called\nkolkata and it was interesting to me she\nhad nothing but a bed and a table\nbecause she would reach the level of\nmaturity\nwhere her bliss and joy didn't come from\nmaterial things\nit came from\nlove\nand service\ntwo years ago i sti i stood in nelson\nmandela's prison cell\nand my life changed\nstanding there\nbecause he was in there for 18\nyears i stood in the limestone quarry\nwhere he chipped away at limestone that\nthey didn't even use\nto degrade him because he had no purpose\ni stood in the showers where he would\nshower naked as an elderly man statesman\nwhile the young guards laughed at him\nagain to torture him\nin in the 5m club i i write a true story\nwhere\nhe was asked on robben island to dig a\ngrave\nand jay they said get in the grave\nand he thought of course he was gonna\ndie\nand they urinated on him\nand yet when he was freed from robben\nisland and then he went to drakenstein\nprison in parl south africa\nwhen he was released he actually um\nfound the prosecutor who fought for the\ndeath penalty and took him to dinner\nand he actually went to the jailer who\nkept him in prison for 18 years on\nrobben island over a total of 27 years\nof confinement\nand he seated him near the front at his\ninauguration as president of\nsouth africa\nand he was asked why\ndid you do that and he said because if i\ndidn't i would still be in prison\nand so why do i mention nelson mandela\nand mother teresa and martin luther king\njr it's because\nthe 5 a.m club and all these rituals yes\nbe creative it'll help your productivity\nit'll make you money in that but really\nin many ways this book is a manifesto\nabout our responsibility to materialize\nwho we are on the inside you know and\nthere's i would take a bullet martin\nluther king jr said if you have not\nfound something you die for you're not\nfit to live i would take a bullet for\nthe fact that every single person on the\nplanet if they run these rituals\nand they do the work and they stay in\nthe game not only when it's easy but\nwhen it's hard they're going to live\ngorgeous lives in their own original way\nso why wait for these heroes to show up\nwhere oh i wish there were more leaders\nand heroes when we all have it in us\nto be one of those heroes but most of us\naren't doing the right things to\nmanifest our glory\nthank you so much for sharing that so\nopenly i can only imagine what it felt\nlike to\nactually be in those spaces and places\nand kind of\nabsorb that energy it definitely is\nsuch a powerful thing to do and i\nrecommend that to people if you're\ninspired by anyone\ndon't get lost in what they look like\nthey're doing now go to the places where\nthey started where they felt their pain\nwhere they had their transformation\nbecause you can soak in all of that\nenergy and that journey much more deeply\nthan you can by following them on\ninstagram or twitter which is only going\nto give you such a minimal viewpoint of\nthat person's life but you reminded me\nof something and i want to ask you about\nthis very closely i was speaking to a\nfortune 100 organization once and i was\nsharing a story\nand i was speaking about how when i\ndecided to become a monk it was because\nof service it was because i wanted to be\nsomeone of service to humanity that's\nwhat motivated me i felt i want to use\nmy life to give and because the monks i\nwas associated with were giving and\ngenerous and serving with everything\nthey had that motivated me and one of\nthe most beautiful\nthoughts and pieces of wisdom that i got\nat that time was\nlearn to plant trees under whose shade\nyou do not plan to sit\nand that when i first heard that for the\nfirst time it kind of just like my whole\nyou know my whole being came alive i was\nlike yeah that's what life's about it's\nabout giving without wanting to get back\nit's about giving without receiving and\nthe crazy thing is so i share this story\nand then at dinner i'm sitting down with\nthe leadership and one of them says to\nme he says he said how old were you when\nyou heard that and decided to start\nliving it i said i heard it at 18 i\nstarted living it at at 18 and 3 18 and\na quarter i tried to start putting it in\npractice straight away he said you know\nwhat he said the first time i started\nthinking about someone else apart from\nmyself was when i had a child at 32.\nso what he was sharing with me is that\nthis mentality that we're and you're\nbeing an ambassador for of serving\nhumanity giving you know being someone\nof impact for society\nthat's so alien to us\nit's actually something that people\ndon't come to even later on in life\nbecause it kind of stops at your kids\nand your family so how are you urging\npeople\nin every stage of life to kind of go\nthere\nbecause it requires it's it's a big like\nparadigm shift for a lot of people\njim carrey said i wish everyone could be\nrich and famous to realize there's no\njoy in that to paraphrase his words yes\nyes and\nyou know i i\nlook i i've seen the best and the best\ni've had richard branson on my my\nfaculty steve wozniak shaquille o'neal\ni've i've worked with\nreal superstars\nand um\na lot of them are just really unhappy\npeople i'm not saying the ones i\nmentioned but a lot of them are really\nunhappy people and they'll show you\ntheir smiley face but deep inside\nthey're going i'm worth you know three\nbillion and i've got jets and i've got\nmultiple residences but there's there's\ngot to be more and so how i would urge\npeople to embrace the message of being a\nforceful servant for people is first of\nall if you're an entrepreneur you have a\nlot of entrepreneurs who follow you\nthere's no better way than standing for\ngenerosity if you want to own your\ndomain\nyou know what made apple apple first\ntrillion dollar company was steve jobs\nwasn't worried about the cash he was\nworried about the craft\nsomeone came to one of my events and\nsaid you know robin you mentioned steve\njobs i saw him six weeks before he died\ni went into his den\nas he was dying\nand he said i think was just before the\nrelease of the iphone and it was like um\nyou know that little thing we were\nworking on\nhe had a monomaniacal obsession\nbordering on a possession to birth\nbeauty into the world that would elevate\nthe lives of his customers that's\ngenerosity not scarcity\nso it's great for business secondly if\nyou want real joy\nit doesn't come from getting\nand a lot of the book is about how you\nmaterialize\nempires in the world\nbut the end of the book when mr riley\nthe billionaire we can talk about the\nstory he's on that franchot vineyard and\nhe shares his 11 letters\nand he explains he uses a word called\nthe magic\nand if you want to inhabit the magic\ni've done it at parts of my life i don't\nknow if you have but i've experienced\nbliss\nand then it comes in a ghost\nbut bliss has never come to me from\ngetting\nbliss and joy\nand what me mihai chig sent me high who\ncoined the term flow from university of\nchicago\nwhen we are literally in that moment\nwhen we're in our magic that comes from\ngiving it comes from being in the moment\nwhen you're writing that book going how\ncan i be an instrument of service and\nbring on my craft\ngiving like helping someone on the\nstreet doing something for your you know\ni'm really into philanthropy these days\nthat's my joy so that's how i would urge\npeople like if if you want real empires\nif you want real happiness you want real\nbliss you want to elevate your immune\nsystem look there's lots of science\njust go out in the world and give as\nmuch value as you possible and radiate\npossibility and amazing things will\nunfold in your life absolutely i\ncouldn't agree with you more and thank\nyou for\nbeing such a strong ambassador for that\nmessage it's the message that i\ngenuinely believe everyone needs to hear\nand hearing it from you from the work\nthat you've done and the incredible\ncareer that you have to hear it from you\nis is super powerful and for me when you\nmentioned about feeling bliss or feeling\nflow state and that coming from giving\ni've also felt that that intention\nopens me up to exploring channeling like\nthe ability to feel like things are\nhappening through you not by you right\nlike that's when i really feel\nflow that's when i really feel my best\nthat's when i really feel bliss when i\nrecognize that this is way beyond me\nthis is not just what i think i have and\ndo and strategically and like technical\nand this step and that step and that's\nall good like i'm not against that i'm\nalso strategic but it's when you run\ntell me if you agree if you feel that\nway if you disagree like i'd love to\nhear your thoughts on on channeling and\nand uh higher higher powers and higher\nenergy and higher perspectives\nwhen i said let's go deep you you're not\nshy to do that right\nyou let me out because\nbe careful what you wish for\ni've never been asked about channeling\nand i'm very happy to answer there's a\nlot of emerging science saying here's\nthe reality and anyone who wants to\ndismiss it is denying science which is\nplanet earth is a tiny planet in a\ngalaxy of trillions of planets\nmy friend deepak chopra was on my stage\nuh at one of my events a few months ago\nhe's a lovely man he just radiates\ngoodness\nand um he took us on a tour de force\nabout cosmology and he's been a pioneer\nfor so many years and he confirmed the\nscience which is we are all part of an\nenergy source whatever you want to call\nit god uh nature life and you're\nabsolutely right j your intentions are\ncreative so we could come at it from a\ncosmo cosmological point of view when\nyou say here's who i want to be you know\nthis morning in my journaling i'm going\nto meet jay\ni'm so delighted and blessed that he's\ninvited me on his show because he\ninfluences so many people how may i\nserve\nthat intention\nhopefully is creative so we're very\npowerful\ni'll come at it another way which is\nepigenetics\nepigenetics as you know\nstands for the emerging field of science\nwhich is you are not your genome the old\nschool said your dna what you get from\nmom and dad that's your destiny we're\nnow realizing that epigenetics means our\nenvironment our daily rituals like\ngetting up at 5am our thoughts\nwhat we eat our peer group etc\nliterally affects the up regulation or\ndown regulation of our genome\nwhat does that mean it means\nif you believe in yourself if you do the\nwork in the journaling if you get up at\n5 00 am and do that victory hour and go\nthrough the 20 20 20 formula you\nliterally are recalibrating who you will\nbecome out in the world so you're\nabsolutely right then you start\nchanneling your intentions\nand you start stepping into your power\nlike we are awesomely powerful beings\nmost of us have blocked our intimacy\nwith our true power\nwow\nblocked our intimacy with our true power\nyeah that's yeah that's real that's for\nsure that's definitely real\ni'm just taking that in i think that's a\nreally powerful statement\nthat's a genuinely powerful statement i\nwant everyone to think that through if\nyou're listening right now you're\nwatching right now\nand and that's that's i guess the\nbiggest challenge with all these rituals\nall these steps that you're sharing is\nreally to remove that block absolutely\ngreat just to move out of the way\nwe were born into brilliance\nthe saints and mystics and philosophers\nhave talked about it you know\nas we go out in the world\nwe take on the\nbeliefs and the emotional\npatterns\nof those who influence us\nyou know and then what happens is we\nactually\nforget who we truly are\none thing that i think is very important\nis also build intimacy with mortality\nbecause you know sometimes\npeople probably ask you this to ask me\nthis what do you want to be remembered\nfor well i i'm pretty clear i'll be dust\nhopefully i'll get to live a long life\nbut i'll be dust and no one will\nremember me aside from my family\nyou know and\nso why make it about ego and as we\nconnect with our mortality we realize\nwhat life is really about and that's a\ngreat thing to do from five to six\no'clock in the morning like in that\nsecond pocket of the 20 20 20 formula\nright in your journal on the last hour\nfor my last day what do i want said\nabout me and have the discipline to\narchitect your life so each day is a\nmountain climb towards that mount\neverest\ni'd love to dive into\nwe're speaking about this identity\naround service humanity talking about\nhow these rules and rituals and\nprinciples can help us get there quicker\nstronger more sustainably i'd love to\ntalk about the difference between an\nidentity crafted by service and an\nidentity crafted by wanting to please\neveryone\nbecause i think service today\nwith our\nwith our child-like mentality at an\nearly stage service looks like pleasing\neveryone it looks like doing the right\nthing it looks like doing the thing that\ngets people to say you're great i like\nyou right how what is the difference how\nhave you seen power players play the\ndifference between service and actually\nwhat is selfishness or ego\ni i would say pleasing\ncomes from fear\nand a lack of\nstanding in your true power\nthere's a distinction i make in the 5am\nclub between fake power\nbig office for example lots of money\njets\ntitles that's fake power\ntrue power is\nmother teresa\nmahatma gandhi he died with under 10\npossessions that's true power he he did\nnot get his power from who he was in the\nworld and by pleasing people he got his\npower by intimacy with his highest\nnature that's true power so what's the\ndifference between pleasing and service\npleasing comes from\nscarcity and fear\nself-loathing and insecurity\nif they don't like\nme then i'm not enough\nwell you know any great genius any the\ngreat women and men of the world\nstood alone even if they were an army of\none galileo coco chanel catherine graham\nshakespeare\nmichelle basquiat if you look at the\ngreat producers of the planet they were\nridiculed before they were revered\nyou can change the world or you can be\nliked by everyone you don't get to do\nboth\nso service comes from here's my vision\nmaybe it's the internet maybe it's apple\nmaybe it's you know writing a book or a\nmovie here's my vision\nand even if the world laughs at me\ni am so strong\nin my vision to serve\nto disrupt the field to bring on value\nand to live my truth that even if they\nshoot me and take a bullet\ni will continue at all costs that is a\ntitan that's a legend\nbut a lot of us have not done the inner\nexcavation and that's why i go back to\nthe four interior empires that's why the\nfive am club five to six the victory\nhour doing the protocols that i teach in\nthe book is transformational because the\ndoorway to success doesn't open outward\nif you get it inward and build that core\nthat warrior\nmeets poet self you go out in the world\nyou're powerful\ni love that you can please everyone or\nchange the world you can't do both\nyeah that's gonna stick with me i like\nthat and i think that's really important\nfor people to remember because we feel\nthat they have to\nbe aligned we feel that both have to\ncome together\nbut it's not always the case and it's\nactually rarely the case from the\nexamples that you stayed there yeah\nphenomenal phenomenal and so one of the\nthings for me there is\nnow you've got me going now you've got\nme great in the zone great i'm excited\ngoing deep but it's funny a lot of\npeople ask me like i lived as a monk for\nthree years we meditate for four to\neight hours a day and a lot of people\ntell me like what powers did you get you\nknow like what kind of what kind of like\nmystic powers did you get from\nmeditating for so long and and my answer\noften especially when i get asked in\nthat way\nit's like actually i just learned\nbeautiful processes and meditations to\novercome envy ego\npride lust\nyou know all those things like for me\nthat's a much greater wealth\nthan being able to make money manifest\nor\nfly in the air or\nyou know transport myself like that kind\nof stuff like you said you were saying\nfake power and it's almost like in the\nyogi world like that's the fake power\nand then tell me a bit about the work\nthat you've done there's a there's a\nquote that you said i've read this from\nyou i can't even remember when i read it\nprobably like\nsix years ago and it it stayed with me\nfor so long you said that well i've read\nit you said\nyou can only take the world as far as\nyou visited internally\nand i was just like ugh\nwhen i you know when you read that it\nwas like\ni was like yes i fully agree and i\nremind myself that often when i take no\nmatter and i really appreciate your\nencouragement to me of what i've done so\nfar i'm like yeah but i if i need to\ntake the world further than that i need\nto go deeper tell me about some of the\nwork that you've done to really go\ndeeper tell me about those moments of\npain those those moments where you\nreflect and you were like robert you're\nnot you're not\nyou're not living up to what you want to\ndo you're not at that stage yet you've\ngot to go deeper to take the world\nfurther wow\ni i i feel like we need another two\nhours\nor another day we should do a day long\nwe can do it again you know i would love\nto but um\nso many things i would say the first the\nfirst thing is\nyour self-identity\ndetermines your impact and your income\nthat's where the real work is\nyou so what have i done what have i gone\nthrough\nwell i mean like any human being i've\ngone through heartbreak\nand\nthe majority says if you go through\nheartbreak\nif you're on your knees because your\nlife is falling apart\nrush out as quickly as possible\nwhat i've discovered jay is stay in as\nlong as\npossible because\ndifficulty is growth in wolf's clothing\nand if you\nnelson mandela became nelson mandela or\nyou know steve jobs became steve jobs or\nphil knight\nwho created nike with bowerman those\npeople became who they were because of\ntheir most difficult experiences\nso\nthe greatest people on the planet have\nsuffered the most suffering is not bad\ni'm suggesting\nsuffering is awesome the the ego runs\nfrom suffering because it's the death of\nthe ego\nbut i believe pain\ndifficult times failure loss\nis purification and preparation for\npersonal heroism\nand so i've used heartbreak i've used\ndisappointment i've used difficulty the\nmonk who sold his ferrari that was a\nself-published book i was ridiculed i\nhave to say even now the 5 a.m club\nbecause\nthere's so many new ideas in it\nsome\npeople are criticizing you\nand they're not because they're not\nunderstanding it because anything new\nthreatens people\nand so that activated my self-doubt have\ni missed the mark\nhave i spent four years\ndoing my very best for this book and\nhave i got it wrong\nand so all i believe everything that\nhurts you\ncan strengthen you\nand so i've used all the difficult times\nto make me better and tactically if you\nwant to shift to tactics\nyou know i have an accurate well i have\nan acupuncturist i have a spiritual\ncounselor i believe in one of the\nthe models of the ten rituals of daily\ngenius is the two massage protocol\nthat's transformational i bio hack i get\ndrips or drops or whatever they're\ncalled i supplement i meditate it just\ngoes on and on i spend way more time\neven on my craft than i\neat on my developing myself than i do on\nmy craft and that's what makes my craft\nbetter\nabsolutely yeah 100 yeah and i and i\ncouldn't encourage people more that if\nyou have a business\nif you have a family whatever it's a\nrelationship anything you're trying to\ngrow recognize you have to grow first\nlike if you want to go three steps\nforward you've got to go three steps\ndeep like it's not going to come the\nother way and if you feel like you're\njust trying to push forward the whole\ntime\nit's it's and it's not working it's\nprobably a good sign that you need to\ntake a step back and go deeper i would\nsay to any one of your so many followers\nacross the planet jay\nanyone who is not living at absolute\nworld class\nyou are your own worst enemy\nbut because it's so subconscious if you\nhaven't done the deep inner work we\nblame it on oh it's the supplier oh it's\nthe market is contracting oh it's a hard\ntime in the global economy the reality\nis there are people out there at every\npossible domain of wealth who are doing\namazing things if you're not living your\ndream life or at your absolute best\nit's because you're in your own way and\nwhat is the solution it's working not\njust on mindset like so many people are\ntalking about\nmindset heart set health set\nsoul set\nand\ngetting that you know acupuncture might\nbe the way to do it plus hypnotherapy\ncould be doing it and could be massage\nand it could all that inner work that a\nlot of people go oh that's not for me\nwell that's how you move through the\nblocks of your shadows that are covering\nyour primal\ngenius yeah\ni i totally agree i love those four when\ni when i read those i was like i'm so\nglad that you covered the four because\nyou're so right that we\nit's it's kind of like our human\nwiring where we love like the one thing\nyou have to do right like it's like\nwhat's the one thing i have to do it's\nkind of like well no you've got four\nthings to do right like there's not just\none thing and i think our minds don't\nlike that at first we we struggle with\nthat at first we're like i've got to\nthink about that and i've got to think\nabout that and i've got to think about\nthat but when you start recognizing that\nthey all actually\nare connected they're interconnected\nthey're all assisting each other if you\nget your health set right it's going to\naffect your emotional self you get your\nemotional set right it's going to\nyour salsa etc like there's such a\nand and that's why i do think and i\ncouldn't agree with you more that waking\nup early\njust gives you the time and energy to do\nall of this\nright like waking up early just gives\nyou that opportunity you're like setting\nyourself up\nto be able to put all of this in\nthere's a line in the book which it\ncomes from the spartan warrior credo\nsweat more in trading and you'll sweat\nmore in training and you'll bleed less\nin war yes\nvictories are won\nbefore you even step onto the field you\nlook at kobe bryant you know for example\nor shaq or lebron or federer or serena\nthese people\nmade the moves they made that won them\nthe championship not because of what\nthey did on the championship court it\nwas their sweaty disciplined practice at\n5 00 a.m while the rest of the world was\nnot watching that allowed them to\nautomate\nworld-class in times of pressure\nso\nyou're right 5 a.m getting up at 5 a.m\njoining the 5 a.m club giving yourself\nthat time the quietude when it's the\ntime of least distraction to do the work\nwe're talking about will revolutionize\nany human life that's why i say it's the\nmother of all habits that's why i'm so\npassionate about it and then you say\nabout mindset hearts and health set and\nsoul set\nhere's what i think jane i'd love to\nknow your thoughts but we live in a\nworld now where we're actually numb to\nour hearts and we're numb to our\nfeelings and we're not numb to love i\nwas in the gym early this morning there\nwas a woman she had taken the weights\nfrom the wade area and taking them\nto the cardio area just for herself no\none else got to use them not judging\njust reporting she's numb to feeling\nempathy for other people who want to\nwork out as i walk to get my coffee this\nmorning i kid you not\n6 56 excuse me uh 6 56 this morning a\nwoman was banging on the door of a deli\nyelling at the employee saying open up\nbecause i guess she really wanted her\nbagel\nwhat i'm saying is\nwe're taught to numb out our feelings\nso we live in our head and that's why so\nmany people are saying everything is\nmindset because they're living in their\nhead\nbut great art\ngreat architecture great businesses\ngreat lives\ndon't just come from the head\nthey come from your heart your feelings\nyour passion your gratitude your your\nyour body your health set and from\ni'm gonna go i'm gonna go to places\npeople don't talk about\nyes they come from your soul your soul\nis just your higher nature before the\nworld taught you not to believe in who\nyou truly are um\nyeah no i agree with you listening to i\nagree with you i've often said that\nwe're wired for generosity but educated\nfor greed it's like we're shifted the\nother way but as young children we were\nwired for generosity there's so many\nshows of that where we live through our\nheart when we're kids and all of a\nsudden it's like living from here as we\ngrow older this grows older as well and\nwe start living from here like you're\nsaying like we're like moving out of our\nheart and into our head as we get older\nand\ni think one thing that i've noticed as\nto why people behave like that when i'm\nobserving and reporting\nis i feel that people have lived through\nthrough their heart and they've been\nhurt\nlike people have lived through their\nheart and they've been hurt by people\nwho also were not living through their\nheart\nand now to protect themselves\npeople are now living through their head\ntoo because they think well if you're on\nyour head i'm going to work through my\nhead too that's that's my perception\nthat's my observation i'd love to hear\nyour thoughts on that and and how we can\nswitch back because i agree with you\neverything that's incredible in the\nworld comes from our heart\neverything that we admire but we've\nstopped that because we're scared of\nliving through our heart well it's it's\na dangerous conversation jay because\nit's easy for me and you to talk about\nmindset that's easy\nthat's the status quo mentality\nthe mentality yeah\nand yeah right and\nyou know freudian slip so i've got more\nwork to do i need to go\nno i'm\ni we're singing from the same song book\nit's\nyou didn't get invited to the birthday\nparty\nyour heart gets hurt\nyou needed the attention of your mom or\nyour dad as a little child and they were\ndoing whatever\nyour heart gets hurt\nyou\ngo through life and you don't get into\nthe university you want your heart gets\nhurt as this happens as i was mentioning\nbefore\nit's this\nit's this steady\ngetting away from who we truly are and\nyou're right so we contract and the\ncontract it's trauma creates contraction\ntrauma causes the heart to protect and\nwe then\nprotect ourselves\nfrom from being we try to feel safe well\nthat's the way most people are living\nand that's why we really don't have\ntruly intimate relationships that's why\nwe can't build a team of picassos\nbecause we're not really loving and open\nin the workplace that's why we can't\ncreate products that are so beautiful we\nput them out in the world and we create\na cult around them because they're so\namazing\nintellectually our mindset we get it and\ni'm not saying mindset isn't important\nit's in in the model it's 25 of the\npersonal mastery equation\nbut the missing link is heart set and\nyou're absolutely right we don't do it\nbecause we're scared\nroomie said\nkeep breaking your heart over and over\nand over until it opens and so the real\nwork of a hero as well as as well as a\nbusiness builder and a legend\nis working on your opening up your mind\ninstalling that psychology of mastery\nbut purifying your heart we can get into\ntactics so you release the past pain but\nyou also embrace your your gratitude and\nyou you stand in love\nand then you work on the third interior\nempire\nyour heart your health set\nbecause if you are diseased if you\nthere's a line in the book which is\nenergy is more important than even your\ntalent you know you can have great\nambitions and great opportunities if you\ncan't execute with fire\nnothing gets done and then i get back to\nthe fourth interior empire which is\nsalsa and i think you know entrepreneurs\nshould be talking about soul set and if\nanyone gets scared it's not religion\nit's it's about\nbuilding intimacy with your noble self\nit's about finding that cause that you'd\nbe willing to take a bullet for that\nwill not only allow you to live a\ngorgeous lifestyle but serve the world\nin the process\nabsolutely so well said robin thank you\nso much i hope that everyone is\nlistening and watching is thinking what\ni'm thinking is that robin we have to\nset\na couple of days aside to really dive\ninto so much more of this uh we've gotta\nwe're gonna end unfortunately but i i\nfeel like what we've captured today in\nmy in my space for me is this energy of\ngetting people to move further and\ndeeper like that's what we've truly\ncaptured at the essence of pushing\neveryone who's listening and watching\nincluding myself you know i'm included\ntoo pushing us\nto start living through that deeper\nspace our salsa our heart set as opposed\nto remaining on the not superficial but\nremaining on the\nlevels that are above but i'm gonna end\nas we always do with our final five\nquestions this is our rapid fire section\nit's one word answers three word answers\nmax so i'm gonna ask you them now the\nfirst question is the best city to be in\nwhen you're writing a book\nand i knew you wrote this across a few\nso\ni i wrote the 5m club\nmostly in rome\nit's it's a rome of grape it's a place\nof great beauty and magic beautiful\nsecond question the best advice you've\never received\nhmm wow\ni would just say\nas simple as it sounds\nnever rest on your laurels and keep\nlearning every day\nnice third question the worst advice\nyou've ever received\noh\nwow um\nthe worst\nwhat a great question jay forgive me for\npause i just want to be honest and true\nto you the worst advice i've ever\nreceived i'm trying to call out bad\nadvice i i think it's it's\nit's\ni i think it's all about\nnot being true to yourself\nfourth uh that's great actually that's a\ngreat answer not being introduced i love\nthat uh the fourth question is a mentor\nthat has mentored you without someone\nyou ever met someone that you never met\nthat mentored you nelson mandela\nbeautiful i love that i thought that was\ngoing to be yeah but i wanted to check\nand i love that i love that you said\nthat because i want people to recognize\nyou can be mentored by people you've\nnever met you don't need to\nmeet all your mentors that that's why\nbeing around art shapes you that's why\nstanding in nelson mandela's prison cell\ntransforms you that's why reading a book\nis having a conversation with the author\nthat's why getting on airplanes and\ntraveling\nchanges your creativity and\nwho you are you just need to get out\nthere and be exposed to\ngenius a genius level ecosystem\nand that just\nreorders who you are in the world\nawesome and fifth and final question\nyour wish\nintention for everyone who's gonna after\nthis go ahead buy the 5m club read it\nwhat's your wish and intention for them\nwell when i would write\neach day over the four years of this\njourney i actually visualized my readers\nconnecting with their primal genius and\ntheir luminosity as they would turn the\npages and that is my prayer that as your\nfollowers read it they remember who they\nare and they stop betraying their power\nand they and i also wish that they don't\nput the book down\nand think it's a magic pill\num\ni've built a 66 day free program the\ndetails are at the end of the book so\nafter they finish it they get a free\nonline program where i walk them through\nand mentor them for 66 days so they\ninstall that 5am club a habit to\nautomaticity but let's just remember\nplease that world class is a process not\nan event\nand working on yourself and being noble\nand an amazing entrepreneur and creative\nand a light in the world it's a great\nway to spend the rest of your life and\nwe've neat we need to keep doing it\nuntil we no longer breathe so my wish is\nthat at all costs all your people when\nit's easy and hard and they have\nself-doubt\nthey just\ncontinue\ni love it thank you so much there you\nguys have it robin sharma's 5 a.m club\nown your morning elevate your life
