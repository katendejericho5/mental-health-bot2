    "transcript": "it's an art form of self-exploration\nand to like figure things out like why\ndo i believe what i believe why do i\nfeel this way\nand i think much like music if you treat\ncomedy like an art form which i believe\nit is\nit really is much like music or writing\nor poetry it's an exploration of who you\nare as a person and why you do what you\ndo\n[Music]\nokay everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thank you so much for coming back\nevery single week to listen to learn and\nto grow from some of the most amazing\nminds in the world and today's guest is\ndefinitely not going to disappoint he's\nabsolutely awesome his name is hassan\nminhaj and he is a comedian an actor the\nhost and creator of the amazing netflix\nseries patriot act and in 2019 he\nreceived and was named in the time 100\nmost influential people in the world and\nthis is the audio introduction going in\nas well his one-hour netflix comedy\nspecial homecoming king earned him a\n2018 peabody award hussein joined the\ndaily show with jon stewart as a\ncorrespondent and continued on after\ntrevor nova tour took over as host and\nremained on the show through august\n2018. he also spoke at the 2017 white\nhouse correspondents dinner husson it is\nso awesome to have you here man thanks\nfor having me yeah i had to do it with\nyou here all right that was very\nflattering and touching because it's all\ntrue and and i have to be honest with\nyou the first time i saw you live\nwas when you came to l.a last year at\nthe ace theatre and we didn't know each\nother then but you're you're amazing i\nthought you were absolutely brilliant\nand that comes from someone who only\nmoved to the us three years ago so just\ncatching up on politics oh wow and and\nthen i met you through our mutual friend\nfamily lily which was awesome which is a\nmuch more intimate setting yeah and i\nhave to say man like you just have this\ncaptivating always on energy\nand and i was just like fixated on\neverything you were saying yeah i was\nlike i need to have this guy on the\npodcast it got very deep very fast i was\nasking a lot of like philosophical\nquestions and deep uh political\ngeopolitical questions and it got very\nintense absolutely yeah but but today i\nwant to dive into your journey sure you\nfinding your purpose i\nwant to go back to you know your\nupbringing here as a first-generation\namerican yeah and i want to talk a lot\nabout you know what what drives and\nmotivates you because when i see you i\nsee you as a activist disguised as a\ncomedian\nall right that's how i see you that's\njust my way that's how i see you but\nwhat drives and motivates us\ni would say right now the things that\ndrive me the most are saying and doing\nthe things that i\ndid not believe was possible 5 10 or\neven 15 years ago wow that's what really\ngets me excited\nlike when i choose an episode for\npatriot act i just try to think about\ncan i be as real and as raw and as\nhonest as i am with the homies on\nwhatsapp\nlike that's what you're really trying to\ndo as an artist to be like can i be that\nraw you always think about that right\nlike there's like the persona that we\nhave when we're meeting people and then\nthere's imessage persona yeah we're like\noh dude if if this gets leaked i'm\ngetting canceled yeah but how do you be\nthat just\nand\nwhen has it got to those points where\nit's like super difficult are you trying\nwith saudi arabia the indian elections\nlike oh\nthere's just\neverything you've seen on the show is\npretty much something that i've talked\nabout with friends you know uh policing\nin america these are like third rail\nissues that are very very difficult to\ndive into and can be divisive but to me\ni find them to be the most rewarding so\nyeah that's amazing and where do you go\non that spectrum of like\nis this too risky is this not how are\nyou pushing yourself like what is that\nprocess of pushing yourself in that\ndirection because i think like you're\nsaying so many people just shy away from\nstuff sure you're hitting it head on but\ntell us that process in your head of\nlike how far do i go how do i push\nmyself how do i not settle for\nyou know yeah\nyeah look like\nthe overton window is only so wide right\nand obviously given everything that's\nhappening in the world right now certain\npolitical figures have stretched that\noverton window to places where it's\nsometimes insane or crazy to me it's\nreally about seeing how far can i\nstretch it\nconstructively um and am i being\nargumentatively accurate\nand\nyou know this is where i lean on the\nnews team and the writing team a bunch\nis\nare our facts straight\nand then after that i kind of\nyou know\ni throw up a prayer\nand i hope the man upstairs you know\nprotects me and um\ni think uh i certainly hope\nthe audience can even if they disagree\nwith me can acknowledge\njust he's trying this is a good faith\nyeah you know what you do yeah i get\nthat pretty powerful and and look like\nyou're talking about the medium that\nwe're in we're looking at cameras is it\ngoing to be on youtube there is a lot of\nmedia manipulation\nuh so\nyou know\nleaning it leaning in for controversy\nover dialogue or leaning into just super\nhyperbole instead of being like really\naccurate\ni think i've tried to be a good faith\nactor even when i'm doing a tough topic\nthat people i know are going to disagree\nwith me yeah i feel that i feel that and\nhow do you prepare yourself for that\npotential backlash or that potential\ncriticism that naturally comes and i\nknow you've talked about it before but\nhow are you like how are you like\nmentally prepared for it like\nit's that because i love that because\nwhat you're saying is hey i'm going to\nprepare and put my best foot forward i'm\ngoing to show you that i've done the\nresearch yeah we've done the fact taking\ni'm not just trying to say something\nbecause it sounds good yeah so you've\ndone all that so that's kind of where\nyour confidence comes from but how do\nyou prepare for the backlash or is that\nit uh\ni look i think i've just gotten better\nand better about it over time being at\nthe daily show\ni saw john deal with it head-on then\nwhen trevor became the host i saw trevor\ndeal with it head-on\num\nso you know i had courtside seats to see\nreally great people\nbe in the eye of the storm and so\num\nover time things i've just gotten better\nand better at it and i've been able to\ntake criticism i think a little bit\nbetter now\nbecause we've now established a body of\nwork\nso at some point people might be upset\nthat i'm attacking\num something that is\nsacred to them\nbut if you look at the 30 other topics\nthat we've done\nyou people are totally cool with it yeah\nand the longer we do the show you can\nclearly see that like i don't have a\nspecific agenda like\ni i'm i'm an equal opportunity person\nwho's going to go at the whether it's a\nbig politician a political leader or a\ncorporate institution i love that about\nyou man and i think you do it really\nreally well honestly speaking like i\nthink it's it's rare to find someone who\ncan do it so\neffectively and articulately so thank\nyou for doing that man i appreciate it i\nmean that i mean that genuinely i think\nit's awesome uh tell me about i want to\ngo a bit into like yo your father wanted\nyou to go to law school yeah yes right\nyes tell us about what would have\nhappened in hussein's life if he\nfollowed through on his father and\nparents path and and what they thought\nof what you ended up doing well dude i\ngot fired from every other job i had so\nlike you know i worked at safeway i got\nfired\nsafeway\nthe grocery store yeah not not here on\nthe east coast it's it's it's\nsafeway too you worked at what london in\nengland yeah in london they have safeway\nyou had safeway that's right when you\nsaid i was like what no i bagged\ngroceries yeah yeah okay crazy yeah yeah\nthere's there's a grocery store called\nsafeway and um they also used to have\nthis thing called plastic bags and\nbaggers would put groceries and plastic\nbags\nyeah i used to do that too but yeah\nsorry karen you got fired from every\njoke i fired from pretty much every job\nthat i had yeah so you know safeway\nofficemax wherever i was working\nand generally when i got fired\nlike the the manager would would call me\nin and they would they liked me they'd\nbe like hey look us and you're a nice\nenough guy um\nbut we got to let you go like it just\nseems like you don't want to be here\nyeah and i remember like every time they\nwould fire me they'd be like\nis there somewhere else you would rather\nbe\nbecause you seem very disinterested here\nat delta and what would be your\ni'll tell you exactly where i want to be\nwhat's crazy is every time they would\nfire me i actually did have the answer\nof exactly what i'd want to be doing and\nwhere i'd want to be yeah i wanted to be\nperforming i wanted to\nbe doing stand-up but i had to shift\nthat night yeah you know so i'm very\nlucky man i'm lucky like i am extremely\nlucky that i i knew what i wanted to do\nlike i i found something that i was\npassionate about yeah and was that the\nsame intention that when you decided to\nstudy political science were you that\nclear that you're like i want to study\nthis so that i can be\nfactual and have history and like what\nwas that intention like when you were\nsetting yourself up i mean it's just\nlike i was too dumb for pre-med and and\ni just had a natural inclination for\nlike kind of politics\nrhetoric uh speech and debate like those\nwere my things that i was really into\nand so where did that come from\num\nwell in high school i was a big sort of\npublic speaking speech and debate kid\nright i did i did public speaking and\nall that stuff and then\num\nin terms of just politics my dad was\nactually pretty political and stuff like\nthat yeah yes he was had a lot of\nopinions there was a lot of sort of\nshouting at the tv and\nand he was one of the first people that\ni could kind of see\nlike\nlooking at an issue having a take or\nperspective\nlike cracking jokes\nand\ni just kind of you know sometimes i try\nto think i'm trying to live out najmi's\nlegacy i want to take that living room\nraw\nand do it on you know the biggest stage\ni possibly can that's beautiful man i\nlove it i love hearing that because i\nthink it's so different like yeah i\nalways joke that i i grew up in my\nparents three options whether a doctor a\nlawyer or a failure like those are my\nthree options growing up\nand and you know you think about that as\nwell like why do we get fascinated with\ncertain things and like for me\nit wasn't politics but for me it was\nlike spirituality and philosophy like\nthat's what i got fascinated by but how\nhow would who gets like as a kid who\ngets into philosophy i feel the same way\nabout politics\nwhen you're 10 your dad isn't being like\noh this is meditations by marcus\naurelius you see this is letters to\nseneca you're not doing you're playing\nsega no you're not you're not caring\nabout this\nmy dad started to read a lot of that\nwhen i was young yeah but as a 10 year\nold i'd refuse to believe that you were\nno i wasn't as a 10 year old so you have\nit right yeah you like football yeah\nproper football\nyeah real football thank you thank you\nso much real football yes real football\nanyway but spirituality became\nmore and more relevant just because i\nstarted asking more and more questions\nand when i was looking for the answers\nthat i was asking like you know like why\ndo bad things happen to really good\npeople why am i losing people why do\npeople die early all of these kind of\nquestions i was finding it there so for\nme for me that's kind of where it went\nfor me you grew up are you did you grow\nup as a buddhist christian i grew up as\na hindu so i grew up in a hindu family\nand and my practices now were like very\nuniversal you'd find them in hinduism\nand in buddhism so you'd see them in\nmultiple places but but i've really\nlooked for in my personal journey it's\nbeen about looking for the universal\naspects that everyone can connect with\nbecause for me that's kind of what what\nexcites me about philosophy and\nspirituality so i'm always looking for\nwhere we agree there we go\nthere we go but yeah and i'll get back\nback to you back to you yeah one of the\nthings i look at in your life which i\nthink you're so great at doing is\nis introspecting\nright like i see you do a lot on the\nshow you're always introspecting you're\nalways reflecting how have you built\nthat habit to be able to do that\nregularly with your own beliefs because\nyou don't sound like someone who's like\nthis is my belief and this is just the\nway it is you sound like you think\nthrough your belief often and regularly\ni feel that way yeah yeah and you kind\nof question it yeah you know there's\nthis great documentary with the late\ncomedian gary shandling and he talks\nabout uh and this doc and um you know\njudd apatow directed and produced and\nit's really excellent but he talked\nabout the art form of comedy\nreally being not a not a way to become\nmore famous or to stand on stage and\nhave people clap and applaud you and\nsort of give you validation but it's\nit's an art form of self-exploration\nand to like figure things out like why\ndo i believe what i believe why do i\nfeel this way\nand i think much like music if you treat\ncomedy like an art form which i believe\nit is\nit really is much like music or writing\nor poetry it's an exploration of who you\nare as a person and why you do what you\ndo and what's the belief that you had\nthat through that exploration changed\nrecently or that you've seen change the\nmost like something that you hold true\nand then it's kind of evolved and you're\nlike oh wow like i never thought i'd\nthink that way about that is there\nanything like that and take a moment i\nknow no i can't think of anything like\nthat like off the\nthe top of my head\nbut um\nbut\nthey'll they'll always be something that\ni'm sort of like uh\ni'll currently be processing and then\njust trying to figure it out through\nthrough my work\nand um\n[Music]\nyeah yeah\nwhat what are parts of your journey that\nno one sees like that you know parts of\nyour gender we all see like you know we\nsee we see the shows we see this\nincredible homecoming king we see you\nknow patriot act we see the 2019 time\nyou know almost 100 influential people\nand it's an amazing honor man and you\ndeserve it and it's like you see all of\nthat what's the parts that we haven't\nseen that you'd you'd like people to be\naware of\ninto what it's taken like what are what\nare the sacrifices the missed points\nthat i think we don't see and i'm not\nasking you to be egotistic because i\nknow you're not\nlike i want to hear that because i feel\nlike it's so important for people to\nhear that the stuff that people don't\nsee i don't think a lot of times people\nsee that um\nhow much especially\nyou know in a collaborative creative\neffort you're you're\nreally relying on a core group of people\nthere's like jedi that i work with and i\nwould say it's prashanth steve bodogh\njim margolis the people that are around\nme all the writers the news team\nupstairs you know we're we're in our\nproduction office but upstairs\ni mean upstairs that's where we're\nhaving a lot of these like heated\ndiscussions and battles a little bit and\ni don't think people see they think that\ni'm just doing this off the top of the\ndome and\nlike no no i'm very much a studio rapper\ni'm not a freestyle rapper like i go in\nand we really try to\ntweak and finesse and and just like\nreally focus on every every little\ndetail i think and i think that's what\npeople um\ni think i wish more people uh knew\nbecause\ni think because of twitter and instagram\nand social media\num we live in a very much a hot take\nsociety and we got to beat everybody to\nthe next hot take and um\ni wish i don't know how both of these\nthings happen where you have like a\nhyper-reactive society\nhow do you get people to also see the\nbeauty and like introspect introspection\nand\nfinessing and refining what you're\nworking on\nyou know what i mean yeah yeah don't you\ndon't you find it kind of like don't you\never feel guilty kind of doing what\nyou're doing where you're trying to make\nspirituality go viral but like the whole\nthing with spirituality is a little bit\nof disconnecting from the likes and the\nsubscribe button yes yeah yeah no\nabsolutely it's the same thing i feel\nwith commerce and art no art in and of\nitself\nyou know when you put commerce into it\nit gets a little ugly yes yes i agree i\nagree and it's the paradox that i find\ninteresting to navigate\nlike i like that paradox like i like the\noxymoron of like how does this how do\nyou balance these two things because i'm\nlike if i was just gonna go and sit on a\nmountaintop and be spiritual\ni think overall i'd be like ah but i\nneed to give this to someone or i'd get\nbored or it wouldn't even even the\nrevelation wouldn't go as deep because i\nfeel like there's so much in\nexperimenting with it and if i was just\non the other side of like oh yeah let's\njust go get likes and let's go get\nfollowers then it's like that's\ndefinitely we both know that doesn't\nsatisfy you so it's kind of like that\nparadox and i feel like that's what\nkeeps me on my edge got it that i'm\nyou're walking that fine line correct\nand i'm always one step away from my\nfoot falling into either side and i\nenjoy that because i think it keeps me\nin the middle but that's just kind of\nlike my personal process of enjoying\nthings that don't quite fit yeah uh and\nbut i think that's a really valuable\npoint and i love hearing you say that\nbecause i think what you're encouraging\nis also that i think we live in a world\ntoday where it's always about growing\nyourself and what you're actually saying\nthat you're getting more from\ncollaborating debating discussing\nbreaking it down behind the scenes yes\nand often\noff camera that's happening off camera\nfor you but in most of our lives we're\nnot even doing that right most of our\nlives like okay let me build my own\nplatform really well yeah i just feel\nlike for a lot of people who are trying\nto build their own platform it's not\nnecessarily like oh let's all\ncollaborate and grow so i saw comedians\ndo this really well i remember a lot of\nmy friends who were comedians on\ninstagram and youtube they all got\ntogether and they collaborated and their\nbrands just grew\nbut a lot of people just try to grow\ntheir lane and their brand without the\ncollaboration and they didn't grow\nand so it's nice to hear you yeah give a\nshout out to everyone that you're\nworking with yeah man they're incredible\nyeah and and i certainly hope much the\nway the way jon stewart opened this door\nand we all bear his fingerprints i hope\nmaybe one day i can i can hopefully do\nthat for other people too what was the\nbest thing you learned from observing\njohn stuart like what was that one\nmoment where you just like this or was\nit every day you know he's he's not a\nnote guy like i always wanted jewish\nyoda to give me these notes\nlike tell me what to do like i just want\nyou tell me how to be funny\nhe kind of was like master shifu like it\nwas always within you this entire time\nhe kind of just wants you to\nlike\nyou know what why why does this make you\nupset why do you find this so funny and\nhe just kind of tries to pull that out\nof you yeah but um he really taught me i\nthink him in i would say colbert\nand even now like i see with with oliver\nis is really how to be like uh\nto bring a level of decency and to be a\ngood faith actor because there's a lot\nof clapping back in what we do you're\ncalling a lot of things out but um i\nthink stephen\nstewart oliver even trevor there's a\nlevel of um sophistication and\nand\nagain just like a good faith effort like\ni'm not here i'm not trying to just bury\nyou yeah\nand eviscerate you just for the sake of\ndoing that like i i really want to do\nthis um\nin a in a really\nsort of\num spirit not spiritual but it's very\ncompassionate no and pathetic sure sure\nbut just like be a decent human being\nabout it you know and i've seen people\nenter the lion's den with both trevor\nand steven and they'll both handle it\nreally really well they won't like have\nthe audience just gang up on them jerry\nspringer style\nand so one of the best things that i\nsort of learned from them\nis\nto be\nyou know when you're saying something or\nif you're going to poke at something\nis to be like really specific in what\nyou're saying instead of like punching\nevery which way yeah it's it's almost to\njust be like it's like a sniper shot and\nlike and this is the thing i'm trying to\nsay or like this is the thing that i\nthat we need to sort of assess and\nanalyze yeah i love the humanity in\nthere i feel like that's off the mist\nbecause i feel like when you're making\npeople laugh\nit's so easy for the audience member to\njust assume that\nyou kind of just went for the easiest\nshot or whatever it is right like it's\neasy for the audience oh sure it's not\nthat you're doing that sure it's easy\nfor the audience to just feel like oh\nyeah like this is hilarious and i'm\nlaughing but i feel like we don't hear\nthe humanity and i think almost as an\naudience we need to raise our game sure\nso that we recognize that actually oh\nlet's let's look at the depth of this\nargument\nyeah the word i was looking for yeah is\nbe surgical yes wow yeah and like in the\nin when i saw\num john after do a monologue after the\nsandy hook shooting\nhe was surgical in his analysis of the\nway\namerica is dealing with guns\nyou know yeah like\nhe's not just like screaming out\nhyperbole for the sake of yeah totally\nit's like that right there\nand then he would build the act around\nthat just me watching that was like wow\nand i think that lasts the test of time\nyou're gonna take less l's when you're\nreally specific about what are you\ncritiquing here yeah and then you kind\nof become better about like yeah i know\nthere's going to be blowback but that's\nfine yeah i've like come to terms with\nthis because i've closed all the other\ndoors yes and i've sort of picked the\nhighest hanging fruit yeah to take\ni love that that's just great advice for\nall of us in conflict like that's just a\ngreat like that message and lesson\nyou've just taught us there like that's\nperfect for like workplace issues\nrelationships yeah that's that that can\nbe applied anywhere yeah like not just\nto your work it's it's such a great\nprinciple of like if you are going to\ndebate discuss or argue on something\nyeah make sure it's done in this sure\nlike yeah i can make fun of the shoes\nthe clothes the this the that the way\nyou look your hair like not we're not\ngonna do that yeah it's too easy i'm\ngonna be surgical about this specific\nchoice yeah that i feel is hypocritical\nand speaks to a larger issue yes then\nyou're kind of like oh all right\nlike this dude has come to play yeah\nyeah yeah yeah\nyeah yeah and then and then the other\nperson also can't run away from it and\nuse all the other stuff so no i love\nthat man that's awesome what is what is\nuh\nbeing a father has that changed your\nview on life\nuh how would you do it my daughter is\nnow 19 months wow 19. yeah amazing you\nknow one of the cool things that a\nfriend of mine told me that that i\ndidn't really realize was ali he told me\nthat like when you have uh\num kids and i in he's a little bit older\nthan me but he told me it's the first\ntime you start praying for other people\nthan yourself\nlike everything i pray for is for her\nyes and i'm not even like when i'm\nasking god like i'm not even asking for\nme it's kind of crazy\ni mean i know you with god you get like\nunlimited ass but i'm just like i'm like\ni know you don't got time so let me just\nlike i know you got like a quick sec\nyeah like can you just throw a blessing\nher away i love that man you know what i\nmean and like and i'm happy like that's\nlike me getting\njordan's yeah yeah i want her to get\njordan's you know like my god just like\nplease hook it up for her yeah do you\nand i don't even i don't even care that\nlike if what to even ask for myself\nisn't that amazing yeah isn't that an\nunbelievable feeling to believe that's\neven possible yeah but then the thing\nthat messes with me is also why like\nwhen i go take her to say gymboree or\nlike watch her play with other kids i\ncould give a about any of the other\nkids how messed up is that yeah\nlike i\noh i'm so selfless i care about this\nlike i care about this creature no no i\ncare about my creature yeah yeah so that\nthat's also like uh dude you're not as\nwoke as you think you are you're not as\ndeep as you think you are like i'm i'm a\ngymboree there's like 19 other like kids\nwith boogers i'm like yo keep the\nboogers away yeah yeah so\nit's cool and it's also you know it also\nhas made me like check myself too in\ninteresting weird ways and that's an\nexample of something that i'm trying to\nbe introspective of and like through\ncomedy yes\nlike that's a common take that i hear\nnow that you're a father you must be so\nselfless i'm like my parents were pretty\nselfish yeah yeah absolutely yeah no i\nget that see mine's the other way around\nso so when i lived as a monk so much of\nour focus was on\nbuilding that love and service attitude\ntowards everyone that's great so it's\nlike a monk becomes a monk because the\nwhole world becomes your family because\nnow you don't have a\nbiological family that's your own yeah\nand so this mindset is trained but then\nwhen i came back i realized that i\nstarted treating my own family\nas as less than\nand or the same as everyone else oh and\nthen my family took offense to that too\nbecause then they were just kind of like\noh but we're your family you know so\nthen it was that way around i was like\noh this is a complicated one\nbut you're like no safeway is my family\nyeah exactly yeah safe way like everyone\nthat i meet and everyone that i see and\ni've i've loved that attitude towards it\nbut but i get you and and for me i think\ni do believe in us\ngoing above and beyond and stretching\nthat definition of family because as\nsoon as you start doing that you know\nthis i mean i think and i think you are\nto some degree i think you are to some\ndegree because i guess\nyou're i mean would you describe that\nthe work you're doing is also to change\nthe world that your daughter grows up in\ndo you feel that way do you feel that\nresponsibility or no not really that's\nthat's not really where it goes no i'm\njust trying to do the best possible work\nthat i can i think that like if i if i\nput that assignment it's too big yeah i\ngot oh i got to change the world\nvis-a-vis my show\ncome on man it's just like this is this\nis my journey while you know hopefully\ni'm on this earth that i do sort of\nsignificant meaningful work that i feel\nis challenging and i empty the tank\nthat's really it and so i'm just holding\nmyself accountable is that the best joke\nyou could really do is that the best\nshow you could put together yeah like\ncome on yeah\nyeah yeah and what's the uh what's the\nmetric of that question like is that a\nself-imposed metric of like yeah when i\ngo when i go to sleep at night i know\nwhat it is yeah right okay you know what\nit is like yeah you know when you phoned\nit in you know when you didn't yeah and\nyou like the way you go to sleep you can\nreally tell dude how can people build\nthat as a way of living because i love\nthat and and i agree with you i think\nthat\nthe most purposeful meaningful\nfulfillment-driven people in the world\nmeasure things about how they feel when\nthey go to sleep at night\nbut i think sometimes we get lost in\nmeasuring ourselves by how everyone else\nsleeps at night almost oh and you know\nlike like i i don't think that that's\nwhat you've just said is not very common\nlike i don't hear many people say that\nlike there's such an intuition there\nright your intuition's so strong like\nyou're so aware of like yeah i feel\nhappy tonight like i feel that i've done\nenough time i feel like i've done my\nbest how how do you think and i and i'm\nand i'm asking you to unpack it as i'm\nnot expecting you to be like this is my\nthree-step method look i just i just you\nknow like i don't know what what put it\ninside of me to want to try my dad tells\nme this all the time he's like you know\nbecause i have me and my my sister he's\nlike you've just been different you've\nalways sort of tried at things and\num he was clowning me the other day it\nwas like you've also publicly failed a\nlot which i don't understand why you\nsort of put yourself through that yeah\nand i was like what do you mean daddy's\nlike i remember i used to take you to\nsoccer games you were really bad at\nsoccer people would make fun of you you\nwere slow like he was just roasting me\nbut he's like you would try really hard\nhe's like i kept taking you to\nbasketball tryouts you would get cut\nevery year but you'd show up like i\ndon't understand why you would do that\nbut i remember like\neven early on in comedy still you know\nwhen i'm trying to do stuff in in show\nbusiness i'm just failing\ni think it's just like\nyou you reach this moment where like you\nyou you interviewed for that job\nand you know that like\nyou took that shower you brushed you\nflossed and you use mouthwash like\nyou tied your shoes the right way you\npulled up your socks the right way you\nwere prepared you went through all the\ntalking points that you know your\nmanager is going to ask you about and if\nit still doesn't go your way you're\nyou're just kind of like what more can i\ndo\ni'm at that age now where it's like i\nalso can't debate i can't wish that i\ncould be someone else yeah yeah like the\nverdict is out i'll never be able to\ndunk i'll never be able to rap i'll\nnever be able to like it's it's a wrap\nhustle minhaj\ngod didn't give me that gift\nand it was just by virtue of trying all\nthose different things failing and you\ncan just kind of come be at peace with\nit absolutely they're just like i did it\ni tried i was not good at those things\nyeah i loved the roast you got from your\nfather about shahrukh khan yeah that was\ngood yeah it was really good that was\ngreat it's great i love that that's\nbrilliant yeah but you know i like i\nreally love him because of that like\nyou don't have to take yourself that\nseriously like you know what i mean yeah\nand there's a lot of like you got to\ntake yourself very seriously and i just\nthink that like we all have flaws and\npimples and just kind of laugh at it and\ni think it's that's more endearing than\nbeing like i'm the i'm the best\nyeah of course yeah yeah yeah no but\nthere's a lot of like everybody's trying\nto be like an nfl wide receiver where\nthey're just like out of their mind and\nlike\ndo you know who i am you know how blue\ncheck verified i am you're like relax\nman yeah yeah no i'm with you i'm with\nyou i agree with that i i'm with you i i\nthink that from what i'm hearing you say\nwhat gets me thinking is just like\nyou're not leaving you to prove yourself\nto anyone and that's when things get\nreally serious and thick whether it's\nyour parents or whether it's society or\nfriends or yeah whatever it is and\nthat's when it kind of gets scary to\nfail\nor you get scared to mess up because now\nyou're constantly like what will people\nsay how will people think how can they\nreact to me it's always been about like\nthe fuel so when you've got the chip on\nyour shoulder which is great like it's\nlike espresso in the morning\nyou got that chip on your shoulder where\nyou want to prove someone wrong like ah\nman this guy's was hating on me this\ndude said something about me on twitter\noh this this producer wants to keep me\nout of this project\nyeah like like hatred and vengeance is a\npretty good fuel\nthe problem is it doesn't burn very\nefficiently correct yeah like uh\nit just kind of tapers off it's just not\na good energy source\ncan get you ignited correct correct\ncorrect\nwhereas like when you're trying to prove\nit to yourself every day\nthe way that the sort of the like that\nplays out over time it just plays out a\nlittle bit better yeah yeah you know it\ndoesn't taper off after like three days\nyeah you know yeah tell me about this is\none thing that i've been wanting to ask\nyou for a while like\nhow do you go about and we've talked a\nlot about i think you know in this\npodcast already we've talked a lot about\nlike conflict debate discussion how to\nmanage that how do you go about\nconnecting with someone who's already\nmade their mind up about something yeah\nand trying to take them to the other\nside or a deeper side like what's your\nvision with that when you're speaking to\na group of people if i put you right now\nin a room of people who completely\ndisagreed with you yeah what would hasa\nminaj do well i i've i've sort of come\nto terms with two realities like uh\nnumber one just accepting and believing\nthe truth is the truth\neven if like people don't want to go\nthere the truth is still objectively the\ntruth right and then number two\num\nlike\nmy job really isn't to convince you\nbecause people ask me this all the time\nthey're like man you did that big\nepisode on blah blah blah but\nwhat if people on the other side of the\naisle disagree with you i got that\nthat's not the point of even even\ncreating the thing to begin with yeah\nit's just to present it\nand um\nif you come along great if you don't\nagain the truth is still the truth yeah\nlike it doesn't negate yeah\nyou know yeah i love that see the\nmessage i get when i'm listening to you\ntoday and i felt i knew this today i\nfelt i knew this by observing you but\nobviously getting to know you a bit\nbetter today like\nthere's just so much satisfaction and\ncontentment in doing the work like when\ni'm hearing sweet what i mean by that is\nyou have so much satisfaction and\ncontentment in just doing what you\nbelieve is right doing what you believe\nthe best trying to find the truth and\npresenting that as it is and that's\nwhere you get your satisfaction yeah and\nthat is such a great place to get your\nsatisfaction sure because no one can\never take that away from you yeah right\nlike no one can ever take that away from\nyou and that applies to everyone who's\nlistening and watching right now it's\nlike when you get your satisfaction from\nthe deep work the creativity the\nresearch the reflection the\nintrospection that's something you can\ndo time and time and time and time again\nbut when you're waiting for that one\nperson to agree or people to shift their\nminds and be like oh because of you us\nand i changed my mind yeah they're not\nyeah like i have like people that i love\npeople i grew up with that that still\nlike completely disagree with me that\nsome of them\ndidn't think i was doing the right\nthings in terms of like personal choices\ni've made professional choices i've made\nthat's okay and i think if i if if\nanybody could see this from my work i\ncertainly hope or i would just like to\nadd this to the conversation\nyou can still disagree with people and\nlove them very much 100\nbut that is not a that is not a common\nreality that's happening right now in\ndiscourse\nlike\nif you're democrat or if you're\nrepublican or if you're this or if\nyou're that you have to be canceled\nlike we've had some tough episodes\non this show\nwe do this whole thing about policing\ni'm leaving the studio all the people\nthat are that do security for our show\nare former policemen that's a tough\nconversation man\nlike you know what i'm saying i've been\nin so many of the belly of those those\nsort of beasts where oh man you are\ncriticizing\ntech companies and you're doing it in\nfront of tech executives and then you've\ngot a big tech yeah yeah on a big tech\nplatform and then you have to go to the\nbar and talk to each other\nbut i think\njust i think\nall i want to try to show through my\nwork is we can still disagree and i can\nstill\nlike love you and see the humanity in\nyou\nand uh\nthat's all i can control yeah i love\nthat man yeah i'm with you i i think\nthat's such a great place to just\nleave it all out on the table when\nyou're discussing truth discuss truth\nyeah but then not not taking it and i\nthink that's the challenge right like\nwhat you're saying like right now the\nholidays are coming out yeah and i know\ni usually get like the number one\nquestion i get are how do we talk about\nthis yeah thanksgiving yeah number one\nquestion yeah thanksgiving christmas\ncoming up like jay i'm gonna have to\nmanage like i probably get very\ndifferent questions to you about the\nsame thing yeah like for me it's not\nlike how do i have a question about this\nspecific issue for me it's always like\noh jay like i know this person's gonna\nbring this up and it's gonna get real\nnegative and toxic quick like how do i\ndeal with that yeah and woody tom uh\nwell i think what you just said right\nnow is is a great answer what i'm saying\nis you've given the answer like oh wow\nyeah yeah yeah i'm saying you've given\nthe answer like i love that i think\nyou're making the point that\ni think we have to separate people's\nhumanity from their views\nand we have to respect them on a\nhumanity level and the fact that we all\nbleed the same blood and you know have\nthat connection and yeah and and that\nideas and beliefs\ndo form us to some degree but not the\nwhole of us yeah and and being able to\nmake that make that distinction is so\nimportant yeah yeah how do you go about\nencouraging people to make that\ndistinction further i don't know because\nyou've achieved it there's just been\nmoments where i've seen it in their eyes\nlike i'd be like i completely disagree\nwith what you have to say about that\nissue like i\n100 000 percent percent disagree yeah\nhowever i i think you're a beautiful\nperson and i love you and they'll be\nlike oh so you just don't want to kill\nme you don't want to cancel me you don't\nwant to like ridicule me in front of\neverybody on the internet i'm like no i\njust i just i'm telling you you're\nyou're wrong you're wrong about that\nlike your jeans are too tight but i love\nyou\nare you telling me that right yeah yeah\ni think i'm saying i think that they're\na little intimidating you think they're\ntoo tight i think oh thanks despite that\ni love you so you could be like i i\ndisagree with your position on you know\nthis prime minister however yeah\ni think like you're still my grandmother\nand i love you yeah yeah\nyou know i don't yeah it was a good\ndecision but yes i love you yeah i don't\ntake responsibility for that yeah\nyeah of course yeah and they're just\nlike look like because that because i\nthink the point being that there is\nalways going to be someone disagreeing\nwith you about something small or big\nand so none of us are living lives where\nevery decision we made was perfect yeah\nso yeah no i love that i love that\nviewpoint man that's awesome i'm gonna\nshift forward because we only got a few\nmoments left i want to shift forward to\nwe end every interview with the final\nfive and i've still got a million\nquestions for you but we're gonna have\nto do this again okay we're gonna have\nto do this let's do a part two um yeah\nwe will definitely do a part two because\nthere is so much that we've we've just\nskimmed over today and there's so much\nwe can go for i hope this was valuable\nin some capacities very valuable i think\nyou know for me it's like like i said to\nyou before when we did the kobe\ninterview today\nthere are plenty of people who can have\na great political discussion with you\nthat was not my intention today yeah\nthere's great people who'll be able to\ntalk about issues with you it's not me\nit's not my strength you know but today\ni my goal my intention was simply for\npeople to see the humanity the intention\nthe purpose that goes into your work and\ni think we've done that like i think\npeople will be able to listen to this\nand be like oh i understand how huston\nthinks about\nlife humanity and how he constructs this\nwork it's not just you know so if we've\nbeen able to do that then that's a win\nfor me that's great but yeah man okay\nwe're gonna do the final five these are\nanswered in one word to one sentence\nmaximum okay you will probably be too\ndeep for me so i'll have to let you\nshare more\nso i will let you go there but uh the\nfirst question is what's one thing\nyou're currently learning right now\npatience oh okay where's that where\nwhat's testing your patients and in what\narea of life i think i think both went\nlike at work\ntrying to line up that interview or\ntrying to line up that piece or why\nisn't the script where it needs to be\nit's understanding that like hey man\nclose your eyes it'll be a week from now\nand it'll probably be better or the\nverdict will be out yeah like oh that\npiece isn't going to work oh that\ninterview just isn't going to happen so\ntrue like for better for worse the\nanswer will be there yes like it will\neither live or die 100 and you'll have\ncome to terms with both realities yeah\nso just like just be okay you don't have\nto get\nturnt about it today i love that so true\ni would 100 agree with that okay\nquestion number two if you lost\neverything and had to start over what's\nthe first thing you'd do\nif i lost everything and i had to start\nover what's the first thing i would do\npractically i would probably\nlearn the technical aspects of all this\nstuff now because like all these like\nsort of digital revolution realities are\nnow very real now and i think this is\nthe new way we communicate so that's\nlike from a very pragmatic perspective\nlike learn to program learn like learn\nthe language of all this new technology\nas like the the medium and\nwater and through which we communicate\num\nbut i think the thing i probably tell\nmyself is that like it'll be all right\nman yeah yeah\nyou did it before you you'll be able to\ndo it again you'll be all right strong\nadvice awesome number three the number\none trait you love in your wife the\nnumber one trait yes\ni love the quality yeah the quality\nselflessness wow yeah okay when did you\nstart seeing that in there because\nyou've been the moment i've known her\nsince yeah i know i'm saying yeah i\nremember you told your uh proposal story\nyeah yeah so yeah so i was yeah i saw it\nsince college okay yeah well what was it\nin college that she showed that like how\ndid she show you that in college because\nuh she she would make all the people in\nour dorm floor quesadillas oh wow yeah\nthat's impressive and even people that\nwere like i'm like don't give\nthem a quesadilla\nlike she did it yeah i was like let him\nstarve that's awesome and she's like no\ni can't\npeople love her like people genuinely\nlove her yeah yeah\nand she does it like with or without\nprops there's\nit's not being like it's not an\ninstagram stories or anything like that\nit's like yeah i remember that day\nbecause i got i was late on my flight\nand i came in late yeah and you guys had\nsaved like the cold leftovers but then\nshe ordered me fresh food yeah when i\ngot there yeah and i was just like well\ni know the first time i met her and she\ndidn't even know who jay shetty was yeah\nthis guy's late and i go you don't know\nhe's making spirituality viral and she's\nlike i don't care\nhe deserves hot food no she was she was\nbeautiful it was really she was so sweet\nno i really appreciate it i remember\nthat yeah like i remembered it i was\nlike wow like she really and i was like\ndid you do that because he's friends\nwith alan and she's like no that's\nnothing to do with anything\ndo that that to me is what i love most\nabout her like that's really dope i love\nthat question number four what's uh\nnon-negotiable for you in life like\nwhat's something you don't negotiate on\nfor non-negotiable yeah for yourself\ni i gotta do\nand pursue what i love i just have to i\ncan't if i do anything else i'm gonna\ndie\ni just i just can't do you think you'd\nbe a bad person if you weren't able to i\nwould have been a very angry person yeah\nme too yeah and i just don't i just\ndon't want to do that yeah you don't i\ngotta say what i got to say i gotta\nexpress myself i always say that yeah i\nfeel the same way i always tell people\ni'm like if if i wasn't doing what i\nloved every day it wouldn't have been it\nwouldn't have been great like yeah you\nthe part of you that would come out\nwouldn't be the best yeah yeah i love\nthat okay and fifth and final question\nwhat's one moment in your life you wish\ncould have lasted forever\none moment in my life yes\nuh probably\nmy daughter's really into balloons\nbut the first time i sort of like this\nis like even just a couple weeks ago i\nblew up a balloon in front of her and\nshe was like laughing really really hard\nthat's it i i was like there was this\nbig blue balloon yeah and i just blew it\nup and then like tapped it against her\nhead and she thought it was the funniest\nthing in the world i love that yeah and\ni was like tap tap she was dying\ntap tap she's like exploding with\nlaughter yeah\nif i could just boomerang that yeah for\nthe rest move around that forever yeah\nyeah i'm actually i've never done this\nbefore but i'm going to ask you because\ni think\nif you could give everyone something\nthat they had to do daily what would you\nask people to do if you could give\neveryone in the world a practice that\nthey're to do daily for the next 30 days\nwhat would you want them to do what is\nthe hardest thing that you can do today\njust write it down and try to do it okay\nwhat's the hardest task that you can do\ntoday it can't be like one of those\nthings

great so if it's\nlike i gotta i have to i have to sit\ndown and write three pages free write\nafter write free right three pages\nthat's gonna be really hard for me or\nlike i i gotta i gotta run one
