    "transcript": "when you take those layers back of all\nthe excuses right because that to me is\nthe biggest reason that so many people\nincluding myself at points in life right\ndidn't just start something\nand for me the biggest thing is you just\nhave to start\nwith my youtube channel i didn't know\nanything\nbut i just started and it was it didn't\nmatter and it worked\nand it was because i didn't overthink it\nhello everyone welcome back to another\nepisode of\non purpose thank you for committing to\ngrowing yourself\nto personal development and to making a\npositive change in your

more\nabout that as well\nbut on top of all of that she's had a\ntruly remarkable\njourney and she's now the ceo and\nfounder of\nlive tinted a new incredible beauty\nbrand\nthat's changing the way we think about\nbeauty i can't wait for you\nto hear about how she describes that and\nhow she articulates that because\nshe's amazing with words and her name is\ndeepika matyali deepak thank you so much\nfor being here\ni'm so happy right now thank you well\ni'm happy right now because\nwe have never sat together in an\nofficial formal\nsituation not that this is official or\nformula at all but every time i'm here\nwhich was yesterday today and\nagain probably tomorrow you're always\nworking\nand i'm always hanging out with your\nwife yes exactly so deepika literally\nlives here which we love\nwhich we love and that's the interesting\nthing that i've not always been\nsure about my wife's choice and friends\nbut deepika is the best and i absolutely\nlove you like you're amazing\nuh you mean so much to both of us and\ni'm so happy you live\nin la like remember when we were like\njust messaging about it and now you're\nhere and now\ni feel like you guys are like my family\nyeah it's so great\nabsolutely we definitely are family and\nwe both see it that way as well and i\nthink you've made\nla even more natural for radhi and i and\ni think that that's\nthat's really special because i think\nfinding family is hard\nespecially as we get older at this age\nright it's tough\nbut you can always there's an energy\nthing that i feel with people at this\nage that i don't feel like i had before\nthat i just i felt with you guys\nyeah same same but i want i just want to\ntake a moment to say congratulations\nthank you incredible stuff that's\nhappening around live tinted thank you\ni can't wait to dive into the story\nbehind it why the brand exists\nwhat it stands for and what it's\nchanging in the world you had this\nincredible announcement in new york\nin the new york times it was on banners\nall over the city i mean it looked\nso exciting let's just just start there\nwith how exciting that day was that week\nwas where\nall of this kind of became real you know\nwhat it is is like\nyou work towards something for so long\nand you have this like vision and hope\nthat everyone's going to like\njust take it in the way that you want\nthem to but you don't actually know\nand that feeling of the new york times\nthe billboard in times square with the\nwords lived hinted\nwritten there i mean i felt like i gave\nbirth to a baby\nand it was the healthiest baby and it\nwas just like everyone was talking about\nhow cute the baby was and it was just\nlike\nhonestly jay like it made everything so\nworth it and that entire process to get\nthere was\nsuch a roller coaster that i it's just i\njust feel so grateful\nhonestly amazing and that's what i want\nto unpack with you today because i think\nyou know we live in a world social media\nworld where people are seeing\nall of these amazing things i was\nobserving it that day and i\nloved it because i'm your friend and i\nsee what you're doing and there was so\nmuch incredible\nthere was such an incredible energy\naround here i felt there was so much\npositivity but people see that\nand then we forget what happened before\nit yes and so i want to kind of go there\nbecause\nyou're from a south asian background\nyeah just like me\nand and the reason why i want to start\nthere is just did you\never think that that little southern\nsouth asian girl was going to build this\nincredible\nbig beauty brand and i grew up in texas\nand the everything around me was blonde\nhair blue eyes right and there was a\nvery specific\nstandard of beauty i saw in the media\nand my parents who were immigrants right\nof course from india they had a very\nspecific vision of what the american\ndream was and for them\nit was all about respect in america and\nthat came from education\neducation on education on education\ndegree after degree after degree\nand for me my vision of the american\ndream was really doing something that\npaved the path for others because in\namerica you have the opportunity to do\nwhatever it is you want to do and that\nwas like so stuck in my brain so\nwhen you say like it did i ever think i\nwas going to be doing this\ni feel like i'm one of the very few\npeople i knew that would say like yes\nbecause like when i was 16 years old i\ntold my dad i wanted to create my own\nbeauty brand\nbut the path from that to where i am now\nwas completely different from what i\ncould have\never imagined um but yeah like he\nso badly wanted me to be a doctor\nbecause again that that equivalated to\nrespect in america\nand you know our whole family is in\nmedical professionals in some way\nstereotypical indian in that way um but\ni i just wanted something different and\nso when i was 16 i told him that i was\ngonna do it but being a makeup artist\nin my dad's mind just it wasn't a thing\nright so it's like how can you be a\nmakeup artist and\nhave respect in this country so when i\nwent to college i kind of just had this\nmindset of\ni'm going to do the corporate side of\nthe beauty industry learn everything i\ncan\nand then go to hbs harvard business\nschool to make my dad happy\ncheck check check and then start my own\nbeauty brand it did not go that way but\nobviously like you know life but i will\nsay that like\ni i do feel very fortunate that at a\nvery early age i saw beauty as a vehicle\nfor me to express myself\nin a community like texas where nobody\nlooked like me\nso i was able to and in some ways change\nwho i was to fit into people around me\nlike i got the blue i wanted your eyes\nyou're the one south asian well you and\nyour wife are like the two\nthe gene pool of like the gods um who\nhave like these\nunreal eyes but the rest of us got\ncolored contacts to look like everyone\naround us\ni got the blonde streaks i wanted to\nlook like what i saw in the media and\neveryone i went to school with and for\nbeauty was like my way of just like\nself-expression\nand so i was obsessed with it like i\nwould stay in on friday nights and do my\ncousin's makeup\nand it's so surreal because i like talk\nto them now and they're like it's so\ncrazy that you're doing it\nyeah it's crazy how it all happens man\nit's amazing i love that\ni love that what was tell me about\nsomething you learned from that\nexperience that has helped now\nlike what was it in that traditional\nform of success\nor respect like you said that your\nparents saw as the american dream\nwhat about that definition has helped\nyou and has been useful\ntotally even though you've taken your\nown path and paved your own way\ni think when you see the hard work that\nimmigrant parents have that when they\ncome to this country they feel like they\nhave this\nsort of uh there's this like bar they\nhave to hit right like it's like if\nwe're going to be have\nany type of um prestige and just like\nbe taken seriously we have to work 10\ntimes harder than everybody else\nand quite frankly i still feel that way\nand i know we've had conversations about\nthis that like\nthe the reality is that being south\nasian\nor a woman of color in general like you\nyou we're still fighting the fight and i\nthink the thing that i always think\nabout and i tell myself is like\nmy dad's work ethic is of one i've never\nseen in my entire\nlife i mean he talks about how he was\nliterally like picking\nweeds in like india and like a village\nto see that and what we have today\nand my family like justin it blows my\nmind and it gives me this like feeling\nof like if they did all of that for us\ni have to do that 10x harder yeah it\ngives me this like fuel and drive\nthat's such a beautiful point i love\nthat because i think\nso many of us can look back and be like\noh i wasn't encouraged to do what i\nloved\nor it wasn't about my passion but\nactually looking at it from the point of\nview of\ntheir work ethic and they did what they\ndidn't love yeah\nor they were passionate about exactly\nit's so much harder work like i said\nwith my mom it was my mom's birthday\nyesterday i know i saw\nand and you know when i talk to my mom\nabout it i'm just like she has put in so\nmuch work like sacrificed so much she\ndid stuff she didn't love she wasn't\nexcited about she wasn't enthusiastic\nabout it it's not like it was meaningful\nor purposeful\nto provide for her family totally and\nyou know what's so sad about that at\nleast for me\ni was so embarrassed of my parents\ngrowing up and that makes me sick to my\nstomach now i'm embarrassed of that now\nbecause\ni my mom she would walk out wearing like\n90s and like movies and come like\nhang out with my friends our house would\nsmell like chicken curry and i was\nmortified to have people over because of\nthat i was like mom like i want you to\nhide behind the scenes and like all this\nstuff\nthey're my number one fans my best\nfriends and i now respect everything\nthey've done for us\nand i think that's a part of my goal\nwith like launching this brand too\nis like i really hope kids growing up\ntoday realize how incredible parents are\nyeah everything they give up for us\nis just so insane and surreal like when\ni think about specifically immigrant\nparents i feel like there's just so\nmuch that they sacrifice just for the\nwell-being of their families\nyeah 100 that's so true and it's\ni think you've done a good job though\nbecause if anyone follows deepika\non youtube or instagram you'll see that\nshe makes lots of videos with\nher parents in them and they are the\nbest videos\nlike they're so fun to watch they're so\nentertaining yeah your mom is just\nadorable and if you haven't seen it i\nhighly recommend go ahead and\nfollow deepak on youtube and instagram\nand go check out those videos because\nyeah so i think you've done a good job i\nthink my mom would love to be my one of\nmy videos and i haven't got there yet\nwell i want to have her on the podcast\nokay like that's what i'm gonna do oh my\ngod that's gonna be epic yeah it'll be\nembarrassing though because my mom is\nliterally my biggest fan too\nso she even if i try and push her to say\nstuff about me i don't know if she's\ngonna go there so oh my god that has to\nhappen like asap\nyeah yeah we need to do it in london but\nlet's talk about how it all started from\nat least an external perspective yeah\nand i'd love for you to tell me when you\nstarted with it\nbut it started when you started making\nyoutube videos yeah\nand your second video went viral it did\nthat's insane i don't know many people\nwho can say that\nand we live in this social media space\nand know people in it like i don't know\nhow many people can say their second\nvideo\nwent viral it was like an out-of-body\nexperience so i was working on the\ncorporate side of the beauty industry so\ni was in the beauty game\njust like i had planned learning about\nthe beauty industry\nand i just picked up my iphone one day\nand i was like you know what i have this\nlike beauty tip\nand the the core of it jay was like i\nhave so many of my girlfriends texting\nme asking me for beauty advice\nand i was like just go to this youtube\nchannel and leave me alone\nplease just do it and so that's\nliterally the like motive of it it\nwasn't over thought i wasn't thinking\ntoo much into it\ni picked up my iphone and i just shared\na beauty tip that i use\nto solve a beauty concern in my life and\nthat was a red lipstick\nunder my eyes to mask dark circles and\nbecause that is my number one beauty\nproblem right now and i think a lot of\npeople can relate with that is\num the dark circles and stuff i was such\nan insecurity in my life\nand so any way i could find ways to\nsimplify beauty i took my lipstick and i\nput it there\nand it got picked up by buzzfeed and it\njust went viral\nthat's crazy i mean i had i woke up and\nit was like vogue india cosmo uk daily\nmail refinery 29 boom boom boom boom\nboom and\nbefore i knew it it was at 4 million\nviews that's insane\noh my god when it hit four million views\ni got an email from the today show\nand i was like oh my god i'm gonna be\nthe indian hoda\ni'm quitting my job today i'm gonna go\nbe\nsomeone on the today show because that's\nhow it works that's not how it works\nbut i did quit my job that day wow i had\nthis like\ngut feeling in me that this was a moment\nin my life that i had an opportunity\nthat it was like a 15 minutes right and\nit was like you can take that 15 minutes\nand have it just be a moment in your\nlife or you can take it and\nbuild out your dream career i love that\nthat's what i did\nthat's amazing like that's such great\nadvice too because i feel like\nit's been really interesting for me\nwhenever i've had moments\nthey have always given me momentum and\nthat's what i believe in moment size\nthey give you momentum\nand they've been so many people who've\nbeen like jay you realize that's like\nyou're gonna you peak now like that's it\nand i'm sure i don't know what you heard\nbut it's so easy for people to be like\nyeah that's 15 minutes of fame\nevery day every day and the difference\nis is that you took\nthat and you turned it into something\namazing\nand it's just continued to grow you know\nwhat it is\ni i remember to asking myself the same\nquestion\nright out of college i had a job and i i\nleft it to go to new york city and the\nquestion i asked myself was\nwhat what's what's the worst thing that\ncould happen and to me the worst thing\nwas\nnot taking the risk and always wondering\nwhat if yes always\nand i knew that if i didn't just take\nthis leap like you know people\nfor me i always knew i had another\noption i could go to business school i\ncould go get another job at a beauty\nbrand but when in life do you have\nat that point 10 million people watching\na video\nabout you as a beauty kind of like\nexpert at authority in this space and so\ni was like you know what\ni have to go for this and i actually\ndidn't tell my parents\ni just quit my job because i i know\ntheir mindset you were in texas at this\ntime oh my god i was in new york i was\nin new york\nbut i just in my brain you know there\nthey would be worried to their core\noh my god this i have to share this\nbecause it was so funny i remember going\nhome that weekend\nbecause i was in my brain you know the\nemoji with like it just like bursting\nout that's how i felt i was like\nwhat now how am i paying my next\npaycheck like what's gonna happen i had\nno idea\nso i was like i'm just gonna go home for\na weekend hang out with my family not\ntell them anything\nbut just rest my mind and kind of gather\nmy thoughts\nof course through the indian grapevine\nmy dad found out that i had quit my job\nit was like my cousin told\nhis brother his dad who's my dad's\nbrother and\noh my gosh i was sitting on the couch we\nwere probably watching some like hindi\nmovie or something\nand my dad was like coming to the study\ni\nliterally thought he was gonna like take\nme to india\nget me an arranged marriage my life was\nover i had all these like\nvisions and i walk in there and my dad\num he hands me a check\nand this is when i start to cry i'm like\ntearing up and he's like\ndon't think of this as me giving my\ndaughter money think of this as me\ninvesting in a business i believe in\nwhoa like i'm about to wow that is\namazing that's like a\nthat's beautiful that's so nice yeah and\nyou know what it is is like me from a\npride perspective\ni tore up the check and i handed it to\nhim and i was like you saying what you\njust said to me and that sort of like\nyou know just him like he's he's\nhe was terrified i know my father he was\nterrified that i had quit my job\nbut he knew how much that mattered to me\nand that was all the fuel i needed to\nkeep going\nwow 100 i love that i can't wait to see\nthat in a movie ah\nthat's like such a like movie moment you\nknow like just\nis it a bollywood movie it could be i\ndon't know if you want to do a bollywood\nmovie but yeah\nyeah but it just it's such a as in\ngeneral i'm not taking away any of the\nenergy from that moment i just mean like\nthat is incredible like that's such a\nso i want to hear and i know we have\nconversation like this all the time and\nso anyone who's listening or watching\nright now\nme and deepak talk about philosophy and\nthought and wisdom all the time so i\nknow that you're very reflective\nand introspective in the way you kind of\ngo about life and everything is very\nintentional and focused\ntake it back for someone let's say\nthere's someone who's listening or\nwatching right now\nand they haven't had that 10 million\nmoment yet right they've not had that\nmoment yeah\ntalk to me about what would be some of\nyour thoughts for them\nas to how they work towards getting to\nthe point not the 10 million moment\nright because i don't think that's the\nimportant thing here yeah i think the\nimportant thing is you saw that as a\nmoment to quit your job\nand go all in or you saw that as a\nlaunch pad or a stepping stone\nto get closer to what you wanted to do\ntalk me through how that person should\nbe thinking about when that's right for\nthem\nbecause i think timing is just so hard\nto understand but also important\nit is and i don't think i don't want\nanyone listening to this to think that\nlike the viral moment is what you wait\nfor\nright yeah it's not it's not predictable\nand it's not something that you\nyou and that's why it happened for me\nright i wasn't predicting it i wasn't\nstrategizing it\ni was just sharing a valuable tip that i\nfelt like would help other people's\nlives\nand so for me when i think about how\nother people can go for that dream\nmoment in their life there's actually\nlike real\nadvice i can give around like i didn't\njust take the leap and go right\ni made that initiative to start that\nyoutube channel i picked up my iphone so\ni didn't make the excuse about like i\ndon't have the fancy equipment\ni didn't make the excuse but i don't\nhave time because i did it on a weekend\nand i didn't make the excuse that like\ni don't know anything about youtube or\nwhatever it's called google i figured it\nout\nwhen you take those layers back of all\nthe excuses right because that to me is\nthe biggest reason that so many people\nincluding myself at points in life right\ndidn't just start something\nand for me the biggest thing is you just\nhave to start\nwith my youtube channel i didn't know\nanything\nbut i just started and it was it didn't\nmatter and it worked\nand it was because i didn't overthink it\nand i didn't just quit my job i had a\nmomentum that made me quit my job\nand that momentum came from me just\ntaking that moment and making the time\nand not making excuses\nand so for me i think like whenever\npeople ask me like what um\nadvice you have for somebody that's\ntrying to like go for their goals and\ndreams it's like\njust cut out the excuses if you want\nthis bad enough\nyou need to figure out a way to make it\nhappen and you will find a way to make\nit happen\nand you've got to get that noise out of\nyour head right because like i don't\nknow if i don't know i would love to\nhear what you do because like in my\nbrain\nthere are so many noises i'm like okay\nwhat if this what about this what about\nthis what about this\nand you just gotta cut all that noise\nand just be in the moment and be like\nbut what if you didn't do it then what\nthen what would happen and\nso i always say always find a way to do\nthat step one\nwithout taking that huge risk because\nyou're already taking a risk by doing\neven that step one right and that's the\nthe hardest thing to do that's step one\nbut once you do it and that for me is it\nis like\ni felt like i tested it while i still\nhad a job because that's the scary thing\nit's like\nhow do i quit my job and just go for my\ndream that's like an easy thing to say\nout loud like oh when you hear it now\nright\nbut in the moment it's like i just i\ndidn't just quit i had this momentum\nhappening i had\nbuilt a rolodex of network and a\ncontacts for the past 10 years in the\nbeauty industry\nand then i made that happen it was all\none step led to another that led to\nanother it's not\nit's it's never overnight whoever thinks\nit's overnight because of social media\nand all of that bs it's a lot of hard\nwork and you and i talk about that a lot\nis like it may seem like it because of a\nviral video but\nbefore that viral video was 10 years of\nhard work in the beauty industry\nthat made me confident enough to quit my\njob and go do this full-time yeah i'm\nreally glad you brought that up because\ni think that\nthe amazing thing about your story is\nyou are already aligned and committed to\nbeauty\nso it's like you are gathering these\nskills which is why now when you're a\nceo\nit's like you were gathering skills from\ninside the industry so you were learning\nabout it all the time it wasn't just oh\ni made a video and now i understand\nbeauty\nit was exactly and it's like i\nunderstand beauty from a business\nperspective\nnow that a moment that's helping me\ngather more contacts more networks et\ncetera but i've actually built already\nand i think that's awesome advice\nand the second thing you said there is\nyou were using your time\non evenings weekends whatever it was to\ndo all the other stuff\nand and the funny thing is that's so\nparallel to where i was at too like it\nwas the same thing like i was\nworking my day job and i knew i wanted\nto help people more\nand so i started making videos and that\nwas it like i didn't know how to\ni still don't know how to turn a camera\non right like literally i'm not i'm not\nkidding adan can testify\ni have no idea because i've always\nwanted to be someone who can\nfocus on my strengths and play to those\nand have people around me who can play\nto theirs\nbut but i love that point that you're\nmaking just it's not overnight\nno it's it's not that so and 10 years in\nthe beauty industry\nis why that moment this is the beauty of\nit actually so i'm having this\nand i'm saying this for deeper kick but\nshe's so humble she won't say but it's\nlike\nyour your 10 years in the industry\nis what means you can actually\ncapitalize on that moment\nyeah right you're totally right like if\nyou don't have that 10 years\neven if you have that breakthrough or\nthat moment it can disappear\nor you won't know what to do with it\nbecause\nthat work hasn't been there you're so\nright actually i've never\nactually thought of it that way but\nthat's exactly it because when i quit\ni was my own assistant my own lawyer i\nwas my own lawyer which is kind of\ndangerous but i was like my own manager\nagent\ni remember i just literally emailed 250\npeople in my email database and i was\nlike my fake assistant i had an\nassistant at deepika email\ni like it was a full fake it till you\nmake a game right and i was like\nshe is now a beauty influencer and she's\ndoing this and she'd love to work with\nyou and for every 250 emails i got maybe\nthree replies\nyes but those three replies led to one\njob and that one job they asked me my\nrate i threw out a number\nand they were like okay and i was like\noh i could have like 3x that\nand then you just learn from that and\nyou go to the next thing and then you go\nto the next thing but\ni just learned and i taught myself that\nbut it doesn't\ni truly believe that because of being at\nthese other beauty brands\ni was able to leave and feel really\nconfident about getting jobs as a beauty\ninfluencer it wasn't guaranteed and it\ntook a lot of hard work\nand a lot of to be honest like i'm so\nextrovert do you consider yourself\nextrovert\ni do overall yes so overall i do too and\nfor someone so extrovert to just be\ngoing from a place where i was working\nin an office with all my best friends i\nhad a roommate\num who who i also like i had a roommate\ni didn't live alone and i was dating\nsomebody\nand that all at the same time i was\nsingle living by myself and working for\nmyself\nand so i was just by myself all the time\ni mean for somebody that's that\nextrovert to go into that it leads to a\nreally really\nquite frankly dark place in your own\nmind it really did i remember there was\ndays i didn't want to get out of bed\nbut then the days i did go out of bed i\nwas like going really hard\nbut you have this roller coaster of\nemotions and i never to be honest then\ni never showed that stuff on social\nmedia i was too scared\ni was too nervous that you had to be a\ncertain type of way\ni had to look a certain type of way i\ndidn't have a certain type of confidence\nand fake it till i make it kind of thing\nand such a core part of what i want to\ndo now with live tinted is take those\nbarriers away and show the raw\nreal story of it is not easy to build a\nbeauty brand nobody just comes to you\nand hands you something\nyou have to work for it yeah absolutely\ni love that i think anyone who's\nlistening and watching right now is\ngonna just\nlisten to your story and i'm hoping that\nas you're listening and watching you're\nrecognizing\njust how much hard work goes into it and\ni want you to\ni was actually having a really\ninteresting conversation when i was\nworking out this morning\nand it was me my personal trainer and\nanother trainer and she was talking\nabout how she'd been doing something\nfor 15 years the the art that she wants\nto work on\nand then we were unpacking that and by\nthe way these two people these two\ntrainers are far fitter than i am\nthey're always giving me like health\ntips physically and then i'm talking\nabout the mind and\nconsciousness and all the rest of it and\nshe actually said to me she goes\nactually now that i'm reflecting with\nyou jay she goes i've only been all in\nfor 12 months\nso even though in her head she felt like\nshe'd been doing it for 15 years she\nwhen she actually reflected she was like\nactually i've only really gone all in\nfor 12 months\nand i would really recommend that you\nmeasure whatever you're receiving based\non when you went all\nin not how long you've been studying a\nsubject not how long you've been\nthinking about it\nthat's actually a really great point\nbecause even when i was working on the\nbeauty corporate side of the beauty\nindustry\nit wasn't until i started working on\nproduct development for that company i\nwas doing product development\nthat made me feel like wait like maybe i\ndon't have to go to business school\nmaybe i can start this beauty brand and\nmaybe\nthis company is my business school and\nmaybe i don't have to go that\nspecific set path that i thought like i\nhad steps\npieced out for me and it was those i\nwould say i would say\nyeah like 12 a year that last year of\nworking the beauty industry that made me\nfeel a little more confident that like\nmaybe my path is going to be a little\nbit different and so again when that\nvideo went viral and i did it it was\nlike\nto me i never thought quote-unquote\nbeing a beauty influencer\nwould ever be a part of my job\ndescription like are you i'm a business\nwoman\ni had that ego i thought about my\nparents what are they gonna tell their\nfriends\nlike oh my daughter's a youtuber what\ndoes that even mean\ni every moment of the experience of\nbeing a beauty influencer had to happen\nfor me to be able to build this what liv\ntinted stands for today\nit's all steps you know just like one by\none by one yeah\nand and we have to see it that way in\nthe sense that\ni i'm sure you can i'm listening to your\nstory right now and i can see so many\nparallels with mine i know i always feel\nthat way whenever\nyeah and i'm literally going right now\ni'm like there were times when it looked\nlike everything was falling apart\nyeah but i had to go through that yeah\nand i had to go through every one of\nthose and\ni wouldn't be anywhere close to who i am\nas a person\nor where things are for us without all\nthose moments\nand i think this you're so scrappy in\nthe sense of like\njust talking to your team out there and\nthey were saying how if everyone was\ngone and it was just you still doing\nthis you would be just as successful\nbecause you\nknow you you've done it before by\nyourself so you would make it happen\nanyways and i think about that i'm like\nyes now i have people on my team\nand they help me grow quicker and\nstronger and i feel mentally better and\ni now take care of myself because i have\nthat support system\nbut i also know how to film a youtube\nvideo i know how to upload that video\nand i know how to be a business woman\nand i think those skills of being able\nto have to do it ourselves\nhelped shape us and to like work as hard\nas we do now yeah absolutely i\ncompletely agree i didn't even have a\nteam until like three months ago like\nit's been so recent yeah and people are\nstill surprised that i\ndo all my instagram comments and i i\nabsolutely don't get that\nby the way and i'm like all my facebook\ncomments like it's me and\nand i believe that i believe that if you\nwant to grow something\nyou can't outsource it yeah right you\njust can't if you truly want to grow\nsomething totally\nyou can't just give it away to someone\nyeah right you have to be involved to\nsome degree of course you can have a\nplan and you can have a team and you can\nhave\nagencies but i know that a lot of people\nhave this belief that when i find\nthe manager or the agent my life will be\nsolved\nabsolutely and i felt that for a long\ntime i used to look at people being\nsuccessful\noh they must have an amazing manager\nthey must have an amazing agent totally\nand all i can honestly say and i think\ndeepik is highlighting this too\nwhich is what's inspiring me to say is\njust that\nyou are your best cheerleader you are\nyour best support you are your best\neverything don't rely or hope to find\nsomeone who's going to save and change\nyour life and that will never change no\nmatter how successful you are right now\ni'm going through the fundraising\nprocess and you have this mental\nand our mutual friend kyle kadakia she\nobviously went through it too and she\ntold me like this doesn't change your\nlife when you get fundraising and you\nget investors involved\nthat does not make your life easier it\nquite frankly complicates it all and i\nthink that's important for people to\nhear because there's this glorified idea\nyou see especially right now women in\ntech fundraising and it's like wow she\nraised all this money\nit is a beautiful thing that finally\nwomen are getting to do that\num however what i've now learned through\ngoing through this process\nis it adds more voices more\nresponsibilities and it doesn't mean\nthat you have\nless to worry about it has more people\nyou have to answer to\nso i think something i'm learning is now\nmy job has just shifted from growing the\nteam rather than like\nme focusing on doing the work but i\nthink we both probably have problems\nwith this\nis like letting go and letting other\npeople do it\nbut i think you're so right there's some\nthings that i will never let go of\nyeah ever and that's important of course\nit is\nit's it's you that's building this and i\nthink it's i think anyone who lets go of\nthat is letting go of i think\nthe strongest strength that a business\nhas absolutely so now tell us about this\nyou have this incredible life as a\nyou know a vlogger a creator a\nbeauty influencer yeah but for you\nyou always wanted to do more\nand i don't mean more in terms of better\nbecause people are happy doing what\nmakes them happy\nbut for you it was always about business\nyou were always a businesswoman\nwho became an influencer but really had\nset your sights on being the ceo of this\nincredible brand so tell me about\nthat transition yeah of moving away from\nthis amazing thing you've built\nthat's already working and it's already\ngoing great but then you saying no i\nactually want to create something that's\ngoing to shift the culture because\nthat's what i think you're doing with\nlive tinted thank you like you're really\ntrying to shift culture\nand break down barriers and and change\nthe way things are perceived so\ntell me about that transition i still\nremember being 16 and going down like a\ndrugstore aisle\nand seeing no beauty products that\nworked for me and no women\nthat look like me and i think that it's\ncrazy you know you have these flashback\nmemories of your childhood\nthat's one that i will never forget and\ni think it still lives on with me today\nso\nwhen i quit my job to go be a beauty\ninfluencer and you know this is going to\nbe hard for people to believe but in my\ncore\nthere was it was nothing about the fame\nand quite frankly i am so excited that\nwith lifting did i get to be more behind\nthe scenes and stuff but\nit was the idea that i got to finally be\nthe face of beauty brand campaigns so\nthat girls growing up today are finally\nseeing their face in it\nlike a l'oreal commercial a samsung\ncommercial it's like i never saw a brown\ngirl on\non the tv so to be able to build that\ni think was a part of my goal and path\nto get to a place\nto change representation in the beauty\nindustry to see faces that i no longer\nsaw because even within women of color\nthank god we're finally seeing more\nafrican-american women more latino women\nbut they're what about everybody else\nthere's all these people in between that\nstill need representation in this\nindustry\nand i felt like i fell into that too so\nmy goal really as a as a beauty\ninfluencer and i use the quotes because\ni think there's\neveryone i know that's a beauty\ninfluencer there's so much more to it\nthere's so much hustle and grind\nand entrepreneurial spirit than i think\npeople realize when they just see that\none youtube video\num and i think for me it was all about\nchanging the faces that you saw in the\nmedia and so that's what i was doing\nreally for the past three years but then\nit got to a point of\nwhen is this brand happening and how is\nit going to happen and what is it going\nto look like\nand if i didn't do the beauty influencer\nthing for three years\ni think i would have built a much more\nniche\nbrand than my goals and path and passion\nfor building live tinted\nand i'm so happy about it because just\nlike you said to me live tinted is a\nmovement first\nfirst and foremost more than anything\nour goal is to change representation of\nbeauty\nthe faces that you see in the beauty\nindustry and and i feel like we're doing\nit man\nand it feels good and i think the\nbiggest reason of launching this you\nknow when i first started everyone was\nlike why don't you just call it deep\nbeauty and\nlaunch a color corrector and make it all\nabout you and like brown girls and\nthere's there's a few reasons why for me\nit was time to build something bigger\nthan myself and it wasn't about just a\nsingular voice or a singular\nculture identity it was about building a\nhome to showcase a whole range of women\na whole range of skin tones to say i can\nbe exactly who i am and feel great about\nit\nthat doesn't mean that wearing makeup\nmakes you less of like a person that\nfeels that way it's more of to me\nthe beauty products are just a vehicle\nfor us to share our message\nto make sure that inclusion and\ndiversity is just the standard in the\nbeauty industry it shouldn't be\nlike a a campaign which is how it's\nbeing treated right now\nyeah that's so interesting it shouldn't\nbe a campaign it shouldn't yeah because\nwhat would that do if it was a campaign\nwhat what are the negatives of that\nit's um strategic it feels\ndisingenuous and and it's not making\nreal movement happen\nyeah um and there's a lot of brands that\nyou can see capitalizing on that which\nit doesn't bother me because at the end\nof the day at least there is a token\nbrown\ngirl now right that wasn't something\nthat happened before and we need that\nbetter than nothing we need that\nprogress so even though you know you'll\nsee the one brown girl in things and the\none brown guy and things\nthat didn't exist before so at least\nthat's step one to get to a place where\nthis is just normalized\nand so that's how i feel about the whole\nthing in general but i think when i\nlaunched lift hinted it was so important\nyou know we launched in 2017\nas a community first um and while we\nwere doing that we just used the\ncommunity\nnot use the community we listened to the\ncommunity to help us\nthink through what was the first beauty\nproduct we were going to create\nand it was truly made by them for them\nand it just is so crazy jay that\nwhat they asked for when we asked what\nyour fa what your biggest beauty concern\nis\nwas dark circles wow so it was such a\nfull circle moment for me to go\nback to my red lipstick video and it all\nhappened it was like we have\nthere's clearly still a need in the\nmarket for this product and but again\nfor me\nthe the product is so secondary to what\nwe're doing you know like with the\ncampaign that we launched\nthree weeks ago which is so crazy um how\nall this\nis happening but um it was about no\nphotoshop\nthat's not something you see in the\nbeauty industry you know like when\npeople look at instagram\nand they look in magazines i don't want\npeople to feel the way i did growing up\nwhere i felt\nnot good enough the way i was i mean i\ndefinitely went through the whole thing\nwhere i started myself and\nchanged things about myself to look like\nthat and so my whole goal\nwith lift hinted is to just let people\nbe themselves\nand make that a place that's like\ncelebrated you know and i think the\nbiggest thing we say about live tinted\nis that we're a multicultural community\nbecause\nif i were to just make this a brown girl\nbrand like everyone was expecting me to\ndo\nhow is that really creating progress in\nthe space right like\nfor us to really be integrated into the\nlarger\nworld and make this a truly inclusive\nbrand we have to be speaking to\nevery ethnicity we have to be talking to\neach other and i think the biggest thing\ni spent the past year before we launched\nthis product for live tinted\nwas educating people on different\ncultures different backgrounds\nbecause i feel like the more you learn\nabout other people's cultures the more\nyou're able to i guess like understand\neach other\nyou know like when i think about um for\nexample\nwe talked about like facial hair which\nis something a lot of women have\ni hope some point out there can relate\nwith me and it's not just me\num but i when we spoke about it all\nthese women from all different\nbackgrounds felt like they\nthey were chiming in a latino one moon\nchime in middle eastern and all these\nthings and i was like\nwow this community is so much bigger\nthan i even expected it to be\nand it all organically happened which is\nthe most beautiful thing right like\ni think when people try to force\nsomething\nyou feel it other people feel it and it\njust naturally happens i mean i just\nthink that's the best way to do\neverything in business and in life\ni love it yeah yeah 100 and i'm so glad\nthat you've\nbuilt something community first and\ni remember one of my mentors in business\nwould always say like build community\nfirst commerce second\nlike always and and he used to say and i\nwas like that sounds good like that\nsounds cool\nyeah yeah you know that's one of those\nstatements but it was like it's so true\nbecause not only is a community not\nthat's not just smart or strategic\nactually what it is is it's real because\nwhen you\ndeeply get to know people's stories\nyour heart expands your vision expands\nright like you don't become someone\nwho's just trying to sell something\nanymore\nbecause you have a community for see if\nyou start with commerce you're basically\nthinking are we hitting our numbers\nare we selling stuff is stuff being\nshipped right that's what you're\nthinking about\nwhen you start with community first like\nyou have you start hearing people's\nstories\nyou start hearing people's backgrounds\nyou hear about people's challenges and\nthen\nyour brand becomes full of compassion\nand empathy and love\nand care as opposed to being about\nnumbers and stats and analytics\neven when you say that it makes my like\nheart just like feel so good because\nlike i\ni had so many tough times this past year\ni was so it was so many lows of thinking\nand again doubting yourself like\nit's it was a complete shift right like\ni went and for me\ni never like dreamt of being a beauty\ninfluencer but i always dreamt of this\nbeauty brand happening\nso the pressure was like 10x and i felt\nlike oh my god like this is what i\nwanted since i was 16. it's happening\nand you have to do it right\nbut i had to get out of my own head and\ngo back to the same scrappy mentality i\nhad when i first started that\nyoutube video using my iphone is you\njust have to start\nyou just have to start and i'll tell you\nlike during those low times\nit was literally this community that got\nme through it because i would read their\ncomments and they'd be like\nkeep going thank you so much you're\nchanging my life you're making me feel\nbeautiful with who i am\nand when you see those comments like\nliterally when you're working at one in\nthe morning and you're like sitting\nthere\non your laptop and it's a saturday night\nthat\nis the energy you need to say this is\nwhy you're doing something and\ni think that that purpose-driven aspect\nof it be not just a beauty but just\nbuilding a business\nis the la it equals longevity 100\nbecause there's a\nwe're human there's there's a real\nemotion that goes into it and i think\nlike\nat least for me personally and i don't\nknow this could be one of my weaknesses\nas a ceo but i feel like i have empathy\nin building this business and it\nsometimes is like not a good thing but\nit's who i am\nand i i don't know if that'll go away\nbut i i can't help but care\nyeah um and it's it's tough right\nbecause when you're a beauty personality\ni'm allowed to just be that girl when\nyou're running a business\nyou sometimes have to like shift that\nhat and be like okay like\nlet's think about this like what's gonna\nbe right for them and and this and that\nit's\nit's a weird balance of all of these\nthings yeah i'm this is a therapy\nsession all of a sudden but i'm into it\ni'm like man it's a lot yeah no it is a\nlot and that's what i think\nis so beautiful when when when i'm doing\nthe podcast and i'm speaking to someone\nlike yourself it's like\nyou've just had so many transitions yeah\nand transitions are the hardest\nyeah and that's why most people never\nhave them and that's why most people\nlive the same day over and over and over\nagain and call it a life because\ntransitions are so hard yeah tell me\nabout the doubts that came in your mind\nand how you overcame them before you got\nto building live tinted like\nwhat were the doubts what were the\nchallenges and what got you through so\nwe already know\nthe community got you through and i love\nthat because that to me is\nto me that's a successful entrepreneur\nlike that to me that's a successful\nbusiness person it's someone who's\nliving for their\ncommunity and their why is so strong but\nwhat else what were the doubts that came\nup\nand how were you able to strategically\nor internally start overcoming them\ni think i had to tell myself you have to\nsometimes give up the good to get for\nto the great you know like i actually\nremember writing that out and like\nwriting out like\nthings were just going in sort of like a\nhamster wheel as an influencer right\nlike\nthere was deals coming in and and beyond\nthe deals again like\ni felt like there was everything i\nwanted to achieve out of being a beauty\ninfluencer you know\nthat had happened but\nit's comfortable i had like a routine\nwith it i was you know\nin a flow of it and i was growing on\nlike my business with it and all these\nthings and it\nit's it's really scary to go from that\nto\nwell like i've had this dream blah blah\nblah blah blah\nokay so i would say for me my biggest\nthing was that i knew that to build a\ncompany i would need people and so me\ntaking this calculated risk\nalso impacted other people's lives\nthat's a really scary thing\nand i think for me it was like again the\nsame way when i was working at that\ncompany and i\nwhile working there i started my youtube\nchannel right\nso while i was an influencer i started\nlive tinted and that was the only\nthat's the way that i've always built my\ncareer is like do\na little test it's almost like you know\nlike just test it out see how it goes\nand that's how we launch live tinted as\nlike with the hashtag i literally just\nput on my\ninstagram story this is how scrappy i\ndid it i thought i was going to do this\nwhole plan\nand like make this beautiful grin on\ninstagram right and then i was just like\nyou know what deepika i just put hashtag\nleft tinted and said if you can find\na deep-skinned melanin south asian woman\ntag\nlive tinted and within minutes 200\npeople had tagged women all over online\nbecause\ni couldn't find a woman that looked like\nthat on the internet how crazy\nwhoa no way that's crazy so i just\nasked the community to do it and that's\nand then i was like you know what\nlet's just launch this page so that was\nmy way of testing it out because\ninstead of just trying to think of like\nand i think that's the biggest thing we\nall get into our heads is this\nperfection idea\nand the second i stopped thinking about\ntheir caring about it\nwe just launched the page and it just\nstarted to organically grow\nso instead of like placing that big\norder for that beauty product and right\naway saying i needed to start this\nbeauty product\ni started an instagram page and i just\nstarted a hashtag\nand you know thousands and thousands and\nthousands of people have been using the\nhashtag\nas a way to identify themselves and tell\ntheir personal\nstory about their identity and their\nculture and where they come from and\nthat\nto me helped me shape what product and\nwhat i wanted to launch from a business\nside\nbut in the beginning it was just about\ntrying something out\nyeah and i think that's the only way to\ndo for me personally it's not the only\nway to do it\nbut i think it's the way that you kind\nof go into it with a little\nless fear yeah because it's scary it's\nit's still scary yeah every day that i\nlove that because\ni i always say that all of my content is\n75 complete\nit's just everything this podcast\neverything on instagram\nevery video i've ever made is 75\ncomplete and that's crazy because i bet\neveryone watching is thinking it's 150\npercent\nand it's really not from my perspective\ni know everything i could have made\nbetter about each one\nbut if i tried to get to 100 you'd never\nyou wouldn't know who i am because i\nthink that's the\nthat's the block we all live in we try\nand go from 75 now it shouldn't be 50\nright you don't want to put something\nout at just 50 or 40. yeah but you want\nto get to a place where\nyou are removing that fear because if i\nwaited till i got to 99 or 100\ni'd never release anything because then\nyou can just keep tweaking\nand keep tweaking and keep tweaking and\nthen you don't learn and then you don't\nlearn\nfast like waiting for something to get\n100 you could wait 10 years to launch\nsomething\nat 75 you can launch 10 things in 10\nyears and learn from it and get better\nthat doesn't mean you're giving low\nquality like just to throw that out it's\nnot that that's not about low quality\nright it's not about bad quality it's\nnot like i don't think what i'm putting\nout is good quality\nwhat i'm saying is that i'm not giving\nmyself the pressure\nof perfecting like there are times when\ni miss a word or mispronounce a word on\na video\nright right right and it's like i'm not\ngonna re-record the video for that\nbecause at that time it felt right\nand people can forgive that and i think\nthat's what i mean that just\nliving for creating something of high\nvalue and high quality\nbut not putting the fear of something\nthat's actually going to block you from\never\ngetting it to market and i don't think\nany entrepreneur launching a business is\never going to feel like their work is\n100\nno way when you're it's your baby and\nyou're looking at it you if you were\nwaiting for 100\nyeah it just would never happen no you\ncan't think of it that way you just\ncan't and i\ni think about that even with when we\nlaunched our first product again like\ni i there's so many things i wanted to\ndo differently\nbut at the same time like you also want\nto put it out into the world and see how\npeople respond to it because you want to\nlearn from that and grow from that and\nbuild from that\nso the same way i started that with the\nhashtag my youtube channel to the\nhashtag of launching\nlive tinted as a community i treated our\nfirst product that way too and\ni mean fingers crossed it's going well\nyeah it's well i think it's going\namazing\nlike it's awesome and i love the\nbranding and i know rodney was in the\nvideo too she was which was very fun\nbecause rodney doesn't love being in\nfront of cameras which makes no sense\nbecause she it could be a\nirl model let's be real everyone knows\nthat but it's amazing and\ni love that it was it was very real yeah\nlike when i saw it because i'd never\nseen it from\nwhat radhi showed me when she was there\nwith you but i saw it the day it all\nlaunched three weeks ago\nand i was just like i love the song like\ni loved the look and feel of everyone in\nthe video none of it felt pretentious\nand i see beauty ads all the time like\nyou receive your ads all the time\nyeah and that's the point right and it\ndidn't feel like that and\nand and i'm not just saying that because\nyou're my friend i'm saying that because\nthat's how i felt\nand i was just like oh this is real and\ni'm glad that i've just found out from\nwhich i didn't know which\nthe release was scrappy yeah because i\nthink it it feels real and it feels\nauthentic and genuine and but you know\nwhat the thing is is like i feel like\nif we didn't do it that way like it\nwouldn't be what\nwhat i want the brand to be like think\nabout you just said it yourself\nthere is a million beauty brands out\nthere what is the point and purpose of\njust putting\nout another one there has to be\nsomething bigger than\na beauty product there has to be\nsomething that you want to change\nand that's in any aspect of whatever\nbusiness you're building\nwhat drives me and keeps me going is\nthinking like we are actually making\nmomentum in this industry to make it so\nliterally it's not an\noption to not feature only one type of\nperson in a campaign it's it's just it's\nnot an option anymore you have to make\nit so\nyou're being truly inclusive and i think\nthat's what excites me more than\nanything\nis that girls see themselves with quote\nunquote flaws\nwhich to me are really just like the\nbest parts about people and i think the\nmore\nthat we share people's stories and give\npeople voices these are all women\nthat's why i think we've been able to\ngrow at the rate that we have is these\nare all women who have been dying\nto finally be heard and get their voices\nheard and i think\nyou know i can't tell you how many\ninvestors how many mentors\nall told me that i was crazy to want to\nlaunch it this way\ni mean so many and i think that's one of\nthose things that\nyou you should get advice from other\npeople in your lives of course that you\ntrust\nbut at the end of the day it's your\nvision and your gut feeling that has to\nmake the final call oh that's so true\nhas to so true and it's funny how that\ngut and intuition kind of gets quieter\nand quieter as things get bigger and\nbigger\nit's so hard like it's almost like as\nthings get bigger you almost feel like i\ndon't know how to do this so i've got to\nlisten to someone else\ni used to go to like five or six\ndifferent people and they all had\ndifferent opinions and then that just\nadded voices and noises into your own\nhead and it actually\nto be honest even during the building\nprocess there was certain people's\nadvice i took\nthat was so different from what i wanted\nso different i am so glad that before we\nexecuted and launched i\ni had like a mentor snap me and say\nwhere's the deepika in this brand\nand what she meant by the deepika is\nthat where is the\nbubbly personality the fun the vibrancy\nthe the girl that people have been\nfollowing for three years who now wanted\nto launch something bigger than herself\nit's so easy to lose yourself\nand that's what happened with all the\nvoices and noises in my head and i think\nwhen\ni had that person thank god like snap\nthat into my brain\ni just remembered wow i want this to be\na brand that's about\nhappiness and people to feel like just\nlike positive\nand good because the beauty space is can\nbe really isolating it just can\nand i think um i think you know just the\nmedia in general can be isolating\nif i can do one thing with this beauty\nbrand and it's make one person out there\nand i know you i feel like you must feel\nthe same way if i can make one person\nout there feel\nlike they can be exactly who they are\nand feel good about that then like\ni'm doing what i want to do i really\nfeel that way it's not it's really not\nabout the beauty product and\ni think that's the best part about\nbuilding this business i love that it\nreally is i love that tell me a bit\nabout\nthe biggest things you think you have to\nthink about for someone who's thinking\nof starting a business\nwhat if you had to say there were three\nthings that i know\nhave been really important to launch\nthis business well\nwhat have been those three big things\napart from obvious things like getting\nfunding or whatever but just\nthree key core principles that you think\nhave made a huge difference\nto a successful launch for the first\nthing that comes to mind is cutting out\nthe noise\num there's a lot of things that i used\nto do that i don't do anymore\nand that includes people in my life that\ni now recognize and this is why i\nbasically live at this home\nis because i'm telling you\nif if there is even an inkling in you\nthat somebody is negative energy they're\nnegative energy\nand you need to cut that person out of\nyour life yesterday\nand i've always been the girl that had a\nmillion best friends and like i love\nbeing around people like i said i'm an\nextrovert and i i thrive on other\npeople's energy\nbut the wrong energy can take you way\ndown the wrong place so\ni would say the first thing is cut out\nthe noise and whatever that means in\nyour own way like\nthe the people the distractions the\nhabits\num i i i don't go out like i used to go\nout\ni i hang out with my family more than i\never have\nand my close friends i've really\ndwindled it down to a core group of\npeople\nand you just you have to there's not\nenough time is so finite\nthat i would say the yeah the first\nthing is cut out the noise\nthe other thing i would say is you know\ni think the whole being scrappy thing is\nsomething to emphasize like\ni would say like the whole making a\nbusiness plan thing i\npersonally don't believe in that because\nto me my experience the past 10 years i\nthink is\na business plan like i don't think you\nhave to put pen to paper in that sense\nof like um\ni was always taught that like i was a\nbusiness like in undergrad i was a\nbusiness major and it was like\ncreate this like formalized business\nplan blah blah blah blah i think that\nthat's just like\nthere's a difference between\nbrainstorming and doing like a whole\nlike whiteboard situation\nversus like anything of that like\nfanciness yeah\nbe scrappy just like just put things out\nthere see feelers do tests and see what\nhappens with that you know\num so i would say yeah cut the noise and\nbe scrappy and\nmaybe i would say like support system\nsupport system support system which kind\nof goes into like cutting the noise but\ni i can't emphasize that enough because\nand that for me it was my community but\nwhatever a support system is to you\num it is so crucial because\nwhatever you see online don't believe it\nit is the toughest journey you'll ever\ngo\non but it's the most rewarding journey\nyou'll ever go on and it is so worth it\nbut i wouldn't have gotten through it if\nit wasn't for my support system i still\nevery day yeah every day yeah i was\ngoing to touch on that because i know we\ntalk a lot about like\nthe psychological impact of like\nstarting a business\ngrowing a brand whatever it is it's hard\nwork and\na lot of people burn out right a lot of\npeople get totally stressed\ntotally burn out and they lose\nthemselves in the process\nand you're so right i think you've hit\nthe nail on the head already that just\nbeing around the right people being\naround the right energy changing your\npractices and habits\nto suit that bigger goal right it's not\na sacrifice\nno because it's supporting that bigger\ngoal yeah it takes a long time to\nrealize that\nlike i will tell you like i mean i talk\nto your wife and you about it all the\ntime is that like\nthere really is this um\na difference that just the way you start\nyour day can change the whole trajectory\nof your day\nand you know i i hear your videos and i\nlike know it but\nfor somebody who doesn't practice it\nit's so easy to pick up my phone and\njust start working\nand i think for me like it really is a\nthing of\nbaby steps because the second you try to\nsay\ni'm gonna stop drinking and going out\nand just like\nworking out and eating healthy and try\nto do all of these 50 things at once you\nend up doing none of them\ntotally like it's just not happening and\ni think i\ni was always that extremist i'm always\nlike zero or a hundred\nyeah rodney was telling me that\nyesterday um i i really am that person\ni'm like if i'm going to do this i'm\ngoing to go all\nin on it finding a balance in life is is\nsomething i'm by the way still working\non every single day\nbut so important because um\nyeah that the mentally that your mental\ncapacity is going to be questioned every\nsingle day when you start your own\nbusiness and everything you can do\nto set yourself up for success is the\nkey but i will tell you\nit's sad that the only reason i started\ncaring about like self-care and\nself-love\nwas because i felt like i had to do it\nfor the company\nrather than for myself if i'm being\ntotally honest that's\ntruly it and like the only reason i was\nlike i need to start working out again\nwasn't because i cared about my physical\nappearance\nwhen i was an influencer i probably\nwould have cared a lot more because i\nwas like oh i have to like take this\nphoto\nrunning a business it just wasn't\nsomething that was on my mind and\nsomething i cared about\num but i started to realize i couldn't\nbreathe well\ni took like huge gasps of air and i had\nvocal issues and all of these things\nhappening and i was like\nwow deepika like if you want this\nbusiness\nis only going to be as strong as you are\nhelping run it and\nthat's what kickstarted me to start\ncaring which is quite frankly sad you\nknow like self-care should not be\nsomething that you look at and think\nabout\nas an afterthought or something you're\ndoing to support another\naspect of your life wow but it's the\nreality of\nis how i felt i i think that's how all\nof us are i think we all start\ntaking care of ourselves when we're hit\nwith an external\nchallenge or pain we're so bad at that\nlike we're so bad at taking care of\nsomething while it's here\nwhile it's there you know we're waiting\nfor something to go wrong or some big\nalarm bell\nto sound and i think i don't think\nthat's you i think that's all of us me\nincluded\nyeah i think all we can take that as is\nnow that you've recognized that you're\nnow moving it back to\nactually i'm not going to do this just\nfor live tinted i'm going to do this for\nme\nand that helps live tinted because live\ntinted is a part of me i think\nself-awareness\nis the biggest thing that i've now i\nfeel like because i recognize that like\nyou just said\ni'm like you know what that's step one\nand i took that step one so don't be so\nhard on yourself you'd go like yeah\nit's hard to not though it's this\nfeeling of um\nyou feel selfish doing self-care but\nquite frankly that's just not how it\nworks totally\nit's it's a part of sustaining yourself\nyes\nand it can't be looked at that way and\nyou know even for social media like\ni felt like i could never show myself\ngetting a massage or\nor going it's two ways it's like at the\nother side of it it's like i also just\nwant to turn off\nyes and i need to give myself that\nmoment to turn off and and now i've\nlearned a tip i give myself and i think\nthis is important for everybody even if\nyou're\nnot doing a career in the social media\nsphere\ni still think giving a day off is just\nso important 100 i give myself a\nsaturday so on saturdays i never feel\nlike i have to do anything online\namazing i it's just like the world is\nnot going to end\nno no no no it's definitely not it's\ndefinitely not and i think we forget\nlike i remember it was\nso this was before i really had\nmy exponential growth on social issues\ndecember 2017.\nso you were at like 1 million instead of\n10 billion yes\ngot it but uh but but i was there and\nand it was december 2017 and i remember\ni took the whole month off to be\ncreative\nin the sense of i didn't put anything\nout so i didn't release anything in\ndecember\n2017 because i was just like i don't\nthink i'm going to be able to put out my\nbest work\ni don't think i'm going to be able to be\ntruly impactful and help\nanyone if i'm not giving myself time and\nspace\nand i think that applies to products i\nthink that applies to videos i think\nthat applies to anything\nlike you grow in time and space and we\nsee\ntaking time and taking space as a defect\ntotally right we see slowing down as a\ndefect\nyes when actually it's how we're built\nright we need space to create space for\ncreativity creativity can only work in\nspace it doesn't work in noise\nright you never have your best idea when\nthere's a million things on your to-do\nlist\nlike that's not true you just don't and\nso i feel like\nyou we need to start also recognizing\nand again this is just step one\nyeah that space facilitates creativity\nspace facilitates you to perform better\nno one can go from event to event to\nevent from meeting to meeting to meeting\nfrom pitch meeting to pitch meeting to\npitch meeting and perform at the same\nlevel\nwithout taking a break to breaks or\nwithout taking a break to refine their\nskills\nto take a pause and i think we have to\nstart recognizing that\nif we want to move forward we have to\npress pause\nright we just have to press pause i\nremember there was a moment where when i\nwas doing um youtube videos\ni just me i felt like i was supposed to\npost every single week one video to for\nthe algorithm and like\noh it'll help me grow quicker but my\ncreative and all of that stuff that you\njust talked about wasn't there and you\ncould feel it in the videos\ni would still put them out because i\nfelt like i had to and and people felt\nit and you know i saw it in the comments\nand i saw it they were like\nokay this doesn't even feel like you\nanymore and quite frankly\ni hit a cap where i didn't want to make\nmakeup tutorials because in the\nbeginning for me making makeup tutorials\nwas again\nme helping a girl out there see\nthemselves reflected online\nbut by the end of it my heart and soul\nwas so into building this business\nand giving an opportunity to other girls\nto be the faces of\non youtube and whatever social media you\ncould feel it in my work\nyou could tell when i put out a makeup\nvideo that i i didn't care to\nand it's because it's not where my heart\nand soul is at it was never to be\nthe face it was to create that platform\nto give other people that opportunity to\nbe the face\nthat's really where it was but it's\ncrazy how you like you\nyou can't fake that like if you put it\nout into the world people\nit is awesome because that's again the\ncommunity that it was great that they\ncalled me out because it made me check\nmyself\nand it pushed me to go towards building\nthe business i wanted absolutely\nwhat's been the hardest thing about\nbecoming a ceo\nbecause i feel like yeah it's a big\nsteep learning curve which you're doing\nat an accelerated pace tell us about\ntaking on that role and and what have\nbeen the hardest parts about it and\nhow you've navigated that you see all\nthese like quotes about being a\nceo on like instagram and it sounds so\ncool and glamorous\nit is everyone listens to you everything\ngoes to plan\nand you're the boss and when you have a\ntough day\nyou feel like who do you go to to talk\nabout that tough day\nbecause when you're as the ceo running\nthe company you're supposed to be the\none that has it all\ntogether right but at the end of the day\nwe're all human and i think for me\nand i think this is why it's so great\nthat the startup culture has like\ncultivated this\nyou don't have to be you don't have to\nhave it all together and i think that\nvulnerability of being able to show that\nto your\nthe people in your um you know whether\nit's your family friends or your\nemployees\nof like i need a day or you guys like\ni'm not okay today and i just need that\nmoment\ni don't think it's i and i'm grateful\nthat i've at least experienced that with\nthe people that work for me now\num where i can show that a little bit of\nweakness because i think like\nnobody's a robot and if they are then i\nknow i wouldn't want to work for a robot\nyou know\nand i think um that human aspect has\nmade it easier\nbut i still feel this insane amount of\npressure to\ndeliver better and better and better and\nbetter\nand like no matter how much people tell\nyou to stop and like\nsoak in that moment like deepika you\nguys launched and\neveryone's so happy and excited about it\ni still think about we have so many more\nlives to impact we have so much my\ncourse\nmore goals to hit and i'm always\nthinking about bigger bigger bigger and\nagain it's not from a business\nperspective but\nfrom a um just like the\nthat's exactly it the impact that we\nwant to make so it never\nfeels like enough and i've consciously\nam trying to make\nlike those moments to sit back and\nusually it means going home to my family\nwho really just you know they're so\nproud of me but they also know like when\ni'm home i don't want to talk about my\njob\nyeah i just need to like a day to like\nmyself and i think that's so\nimportant because i i don't feel like i\ncan shut off except for that one day\nand uh yeah so i think like being a ceo\nis i just\ni think it's so important people\nrecognize that that responsibility is\nheavy\nand it's massive and the fact that and i\nsaid this earlier but it's so true the\nfact that any decision i make\nnot only impacts my life but in fact\nimpacts other people's lives\nis so much heavier to like hold on your\nheart because\neven though like if i make a mistake and\ni have to deal with the consequences\nthat's one thing but if i make a\nbusiness decision and we hire somebody\nbut then recognize that the business\ndoesn't need it anymore and i have to\nfire that person\nthat's their livelihood at stake so i\nthink it's really important that if you\ndecide to start a business you really\nrecognize\nthose those things that i was saying\nearlier about having that emotional\nsupport you really cut out the noise\nand you really just make time to think\nabout\nwhat it is that you want to be as a\nleader because i really did have that\nmoment and i was like and that's why i\nwas saying earlier i was like i\ni feel like i'm allowed to just be\nmyself and be show my weakness and\nand hopefully the people that work for\nme see that as something where i'm\ni'm um kind of just like letting them\nrecognize that like this business is\nmore than just a business\nthere's something behind it that matters\nto me more and that's why i get\nemotional\nthat's why i care and and and that's\njust the way i want live tinted to be\nrun i'm not saying you know\nthat's for every business but for me\nif it didn't have something bigger to it\ni wouldn't want to be a part of it\npersonally i love that i love that it's\nawesome having you\non the podcast because it's so much\nabout purpose and i really feel when i'm\nlistening to you that\nit's a purposeful brand it's a\npurposeful movement you're a purposeful\nperson\nlike you're living on purpose and it's\nand i think that\nthat's the difference between\nwhat wins and what doesn't and what's\nalso fulfilling and what's not yeah\nbecause i think that a lot of things can\nwin in life and succeed\nbut they may not fill you up with\nmeaning and happiness\nbecause it's not linked to purpose i\nthink you and i have both met people\nwhere we've met that they have\nwhat externally looks like everything\neverything that you think somebody wants\nand they still feel empty inside\nand for me when it's all said and done\ni want to i when i think about what\nfootprint i want to leave on like the\nworld and what i want to do\nand this is i've had so many people say\nto me like it's a beauty brand you're in\nthe beauty industry what i\nliterally have when investors are like\nbut it's it's makeup yeah\nand that's when i walk out of the room\nand know that they're not the right\npartner for me because\nit's not makeup it's about making people\nfeel good about themselves and who they\nare\nand giving them that confidence to walk\nout the door and feel like they are\ncomplete i love that and i don't think\nthat for\nme again this is just having that like\nfootprint and leaving that footprint i\nthink everybody wants to figure out what\ntheir version of that is\nand that's when you feel fulfilled\ninside and it's it's don't get me wrong\nlisten like i'm not going to sit here\nand preach this whole thing of like\ni worked hard i am working hard and i do\nwork hard and i\ni feel proud and i have goals like i\nwant to one day buy my dad like\nhe got me i think back to this and like\nwhen i was 16 years old my father drove\na toyota camry\nhe was working overnight shift after\novernight shift and um\nyou know in a family of doctors he's the\nonly one that's not a doctor he's a lab\ntech\nand now that i understand money and the\nfinancial responsibility that he had\non just that salary supporting our\nentire family\nit blows my mind because i was\na brat i wanted that abercrombie and fit\nshirt i wanted that blah blah blah and i\ni now realize how much we couldn't\nafford it yeah but he never let me\nrealize that as a kid he gave me\neverything i ever wanted\neverything i ever wanted and you know i\nused to have this guilt this like heavy\nguilt about it like why was i that girl\num i was such a brat and and now instead\nof feeling that guilt i just think about\nhow i can pay it forward to them\nbut to other people and hopefully one\nday my kids i mean it's just one of\nthose things and i\nthink that's why i'm so proud of the\nculture and the background i came from\nand wanting that to be a part of the\nlive tinted brand\nbecause i again like i used to not be\nproud of it\nand it's so silly because that is the\ndopest part of who people are\nabsolutely that identity yeah but there\nis something about that south asian\ncommunity that doesn't have it i know\nand so i'm really glad that people like\nyourself\nare uh representing that so incredibly\nwell and with grace\nand i think that's very important i i\nthink representation is never a matter\nof\nego or competition it's a matter of\ngrace\nyeah and like accepting and valuing\nothers and\nrecognizing everyone's value everyone's\nbeauty everyone's and that's what you've\ndone with the brand which is just\nunbelievable to see so\nthank you for doing it is there anything\nthat i didn't ask you about that you\nwish i did\nno i always ask that because i always\nwant to make sure that\nyou got to embody the message you wanted\nto share no i mean honestly like i feel\nlike it's just having a vulnerable\nconversation i feel like we did\ngood so we do end every podcast with the\nfinal five\nso oh my god okay the rapid fire quick i\nthink the same five\nmoon okay that would make it really easy\nno no no because i've heard a lot\nthey're not the same five okay say this\nis yours oh my god okay okay your final\nfive starts now i don't\nwant one word or one sentence answers\nokay\nright one word or one sentence okay okay\nso first question\nwhy don't you come into the next video\nno no what is your one\nbeauty product you can't live without\nhuge stick out live tinted\nokay good that's very good yeah number\ntwo uh what's your biggest piece of\nadvice for someone wanting to oh no no\ni'm not i'm gonna change that one\nbecause i asked you that earlier\num what are the three biggest pillars of\nwhat lift hinted stands for\ninclusivity acceptance and happiness\nokay question three what's one step in\nyour morning routine that you will never\nskip\nnow it's breathing nice and i think a\nheart a large part because of you in my\nlife\ni actually take a minute to breathe\ntrust me i've had to work on that myself\nlike that's like i think that's\nsomething you have to do forever\nyep it's like drinking water right you\ncan't absolutely okay\nnumber four when you're having a bad day\nwhat do you do to make yourself feel\nbetter\num\nwhat do i do i'm working on that now\nactively\nhang out or be around somebody i love\nokay awesome that was\nnot a word that's fine that's one thing\nthat's one sentence and number five what\nwould you want to be remembered by\num\ni i want to make an impact and i want in\nwhatever way that means and i want\nif i if if the legacy of live tinted is\nthat we've\nsomehow evolved the beauty industry to\nbe more inclusive i feel like we've done\nour purpose\ni love that thank you so much deepika\nthanks for having me it's so awesome\nhaving you on the podcast\nwe got to hang
