and\nbusiness people everyone always asking\nyou business questions and i wanted to\nask you what's the latest adventure\nyou've been on with minka you're your\ndaughter\nwhat's the latest thing uh\ni don't know i bought two donkeys you\ndid yeah what's your donkey true story\nyes oh wow okay okay\nso one name felicia one named debo\nbecause i wanted to you know when we\ndrive when we leave i wanted her to say\nbye felicia\nand um\nand\nshe wakes me up every day to say i want\nto go see the donkeys but she won't\ntouch him\nokay yeah she'll just stay in the car\nshe'd be like yo i'm cool from over here\nso i gotta i gotta i gotta get her to\ntouch the donkey so that's my uh my\nnewest thing with her i love that man i\nwas not expecting that see i love them\nwhat do you expect no i didn't know i\ndidn't know what to expect i was like\nthat's that's cool i i i'll find i'm\ngonna need to find any other fathers\nthat go go do that i love that i think\nthat's awesome tell us about tell us\nabout one of the biggest lessons you've\nlearned by being a father like what's\nwhat's come to you from that experience\nin your life uh well this is my third\ntime being a father my my oldest girl\nthey're 27 and 21 or 26 and 21 i can't\nbe yet i can't remember but um\ni don't know what the best i mean being\na father you learn so many different\nlessons um\nthat\nyou know i think it's human nature to\nuh\nbe able to figure things out and\nmanipulate the situation as a kid\nyou know i mean you know she's she's my\nyoungest minka and just like all my\nother ones they they they realize how to\nnegotiate how to manipulate at a very\nvery very young age interesting um it\ncomes natural to them yeah yeah they got\nit from you\nno no no come natural kids kids figure\nit out right they'll figure out they can\nget away with this person with this they\ncan get away i remember you know we were\nprobably in a car brian about a month\nago she said well if i don't get this\ni'm going to cry yeah\nand she she she messed it up for herself\nbecause now i know that she knows that\nwhen she cries she gets this and she she\nslipped up you know in the negotiation\nprocess right there right she told you\nshe told me basically i know my i know\nyour weakness if i don't get this i'm\ngonna cry now\nyou know she's crying whenever she's\ncrying she doesn't get anything i don't\ncare she needs nine stitches i don't\ncare if she's crying\nyou know yeah what's your weakness when\nit comes to negotiation or what's the\none you've had to build the most on that\nyou saw in your early days\ni think trust i think that um what is\nthe difference i trust too much\ni just you know you know when you i'm a\nperson i try not to lie i i to say that\ni don't lie would be a lie right\nbut i think that when i see people and\nthey're um they're talking about\nsomething and i mean when there's\nsomebody who's really fouled a straight\nline i can't believe you're just lying\ni just\nit just doesn't come to me as a concept\ni mean unless you're just\ndon't get me wrong if i see someone and\ni feel like they're a con man or con\nwoman i understand they're trying to get\nover\nbut when people are just like well let's\nsay a shark tank\nyou know when they're like um\ni did eight hundred thousand dollars in\nsales in a year and i said eight hundred\nthousand dollars in sales and i find out\nthat it was eight hundred thousand\ndollars in sales in ten years\ni actually believe that they heard it\nwrong they heard the question wrong\nright because you know i'm going to find\nout like why are you lying so i think\nthat's my my biggest challenge i'm a i'm\na very optimistic person i believe in\npeople you like to give people the\nbenefit of the doubt i give them the\nbenefit of that they're trying to do\nthat yeah it it always ends up with the\nsame results don't get me wrong i mean\nyou know i end up\ni end up you know smashing them or\ncutting them off or whatever the case is\nbut it's just the process it's just like\nah damn yeah you have to lie yeah well i\nthink it's worse for that person who's\ndone that like it makes them look worse\nbecause you actually gave them an\nopportunity to shine it makes no sense\nyeah\nyeah it doesn't make any sense but\nunfortunately i think we live in this\nfear-based society where we're more\nscared of telling the truth\nbecause the truth may be less impressive\nit may be less respectable it may be\nless powerful\nyeah i had i had somebody who was\ndomestic helpful a caretaker\num\nshe wasn't supposed to use uber unless\nshe was picking up the baby or something\nshe used about 8 000 worth of ubers\nin like\na year and and she kept lying you know\nit was on the car and i said\nyou you i was so surprised i said to uh\nyou know i said i'm not disappointed\nthat you stole\ni'm disappointed that all the uber\ndrivers made the money and not you\nso true\nyou should keep lying i was like that's\nso stupid if you're gonna lie about it\nyou should have stole some jewelry or\nsomething what's wrong with you you\nidiot yeah anyway so true\nwell yeah cool that makes sense i love\nthat i think that's great advice i think\nit's nice to see though that people when\nthey understand this hopefully people\nare listening and watching to this if\nthey're ever going to ask for investment\nbe truthful be honest it's great we'll\nfind out sooner or later yeah people are\ngoing to find out anyway no i love that\nman and you obviously\nstarted your first job if i if i'm\ncorrect ever was giving out flyers\nyeah by somebody else who's giving out\nfly was handing off live 2025 cents per\nhour\ntwo dollars 25 cents an hour yeah it's\nwhat i pay my employees now\nwho who gets that their ceo\nwho's getting paid that much uh but yeah\nso when you're getting asked to do that\n10 years old what was the biggest lesson\nyou learned as a 10 year old getting 2\ndollars 25 cents an hour\ni was in charge of my own destiny i mean\ni took the job because i wanted the job\nbecause my father left and i became the\nman of the house i was only child and my\nmother had to start working so many like\nseveral jobs to put the same amount of\nfood on the table and\ni learned responsibility and you know i\nsay to my speeches responsibility\nsomething must be taken it can't be\ngiven and\ni didn't want to be a burden to her so\nwhether it was me giving in my little\nbit of money to help\nwith the bills or for groceries or\nlisten i wanted fresh kicks i wanted\nsomething like that and i didn't and it\nfelt funny like she could barely pay the\nbills but yet i'm asking her to buy me\nclothes\nwhen the clothes that i have are fine if\ni have to wear the same exact clothes\nevery single day\ni have clothes i've been in countries\nwhere people don't even have clothes\nright so um\ni think responsibility is the thing that\nthat that was the most you know that i\ntook from that yeah i love that that's a\ngreat lesson i think it was gandhi who\nsaid that i was sad because i didn't\nhave any shoes and then i saw a man with\nno feet\nand it's that same principle that you're\nsaying that when you look at that\nperspective that difference yeah we're\njust looking at what we don't have right\nnot realizing the people around us\nactually don't have a lot more than that\nexactly and so yeah that's a beautiful\nlesson at 10 to learn that it's pretty\nearly to learn that as well yeah well\nyou know you're not you're not you're\nnot realizing you'll learn a lesson when\nyou're doing it you know when you're\ndoing it and you reflect back on the\nlessons you've learned often you didn't\nrealize at the time that you were\nlearning the lesson that was a lesson\nyou know yeah what i love about this\nbook powershift is that you've looked at\na lot of research on negotiation yeah\nand you've been a serial negotiator your\nwhole life what was the thing that\nsurprised you the most from the research\nif anything because obviously you've\ndone this practically you never sat down\nand read a textbook on how to negotiate\nyeah and i i think you brought up a good\npoint\nwhen i wrote the book uh about\npowershift about negotiations i realized\ni was exercising a lot of these tactics\nand or methods to negotiate\nbut i didn't have an actual plan or\nmethod to do it\nso i started applying these common\nthreads with a lot of people who\nnegotiated um\nwhat i didn't realize\nabout negotiation is that negotiation\ndoesn't start when you get to the table\nit starts way before you get to the\ntable so that's why the book is not\nsolely on negotiation the book is on\ncreating influence\nthen negotiating the deal and more\nimportantly after negotiating the deal\nwhat more can you get out of the\nrelationship afterwards because\nhopefully the process gave you or such a\ngreat relationship\nthat\nthe initial deal is only five percent of\nall the benefits you'll get out of the\nrelationship afterwards\nbut when somebody says well how am i\ngoing to build influence what if you run\ninto damon john in the elevator\nyou have a 90 second pitch\nhow can you build influence in that 90\nseconds\nthat's the problem people are very\ntransactional they think right then is\nthe negotiation\nthat's not the negotiation the\nnegotiation is when i leave that\nelevator and i\npull your name up on instagram\nand that's where my due diligence and\ninfluence has started because then all\nthe things you said to me in the\nelevator i either looked on your social\nmedia or pulled you up or looked at the\ncompany work and i need to go\ni'm interested in this person i can't\nwait to i needed somebody like that in\nmy life or on my staff or somebody to\ninvest in or i go\nwait a minute that person keeps taking\npictures with this is the person's\nhusband\nand why does the husband always put up\nconfederate flags on his stuff and as a\nracist that person must be a racist too\nof course\nuh oh look at when this person is uh\nthe person said they work in the finance\ndepartment but they're not doing any\nreferences to any financial books or\nfinancial intelligence and they're out\nthere talking\nthat person will never know why i never\ncalled them back yeah and negotiations\nstarted way earlier i love that and so\npeople the mistake people make is\nthey're going straight in for the win\nand the kill in the 90 second because\nyou probably get if anyone bumps into\nyou i'm sure they're pitching business\nideas\nall the time and you're actually saying\nthat's the biggest mistake because they\nbuilt zero influence with you they built\ntheir implant or the influence that\nthey've laid down that we're gonna look\nat you know listen you gotta their\nreputation is going to proceed them\nbecause i'm gonna go follow back up on\nthat yeah right and so then the\nnegotiation starts whatever that\nnegotiation may be and how do you care\nabout what i want in the negotiation a\nlot of people think what they want to\nget and then after that how do you\nnurture the relationship afterwards even\nif that first negotiation\ndidn't really necessarily go as well how\ndo you nurture that relationship because\nnow you have an in with me to some\nextent let's let's circle back to that\nbeginning part because i love what\nyou're saying about building influence\ntell me what was different about\nbuilding influence when you started\nversus the way you're seeing it now when\npeople trying to build influence with\nyou because you obviously built\ninfluence in a non-social media age in a\nnon-digital age\nwas it harder was it slower was it it\nwas much slower it wasn't different it\nwas just a different platform right it\nwas much slower it was much harder it\nwas in a much\nsmaller circle but i had to build\ninfluence there you know when i went out\nto you know if we want to we want to\nlet's say we want to talk about it today\nyou want to go get a big influencer to\nuh you know wear your stuff or support\nyour brand i wanted to as well when i\nwas a kid i didn't go right to ll cool j\ni went to\nall the big bodyguards around because i\nknew that the big guys didn't have\noptions for clothing\nthey only had a white you know rochester\nbig and tall white shirt black shirt or\ncustom-made clothing so if i gave i only\nhad money for 50 shares so if i gave the\n50 shares to all the cool kids they'd\nwear it one time\nthrow it away\nthe big guys wore it 10 times a month\nand where were those big guys they were\nalways in front of the red rope they was\nalways in front of the club they were\nalways the guys who were the bodyguards\nthey were always big so what happened\nwas i built influence with them first\nthen the ll cool js and the running\nemc's the world would say hey man\nwhere's mine yeah what am i shop liver\nno you're too cool no i'm not no you're\ntoo cool but after six months of them\nseeing this brand around that's how i\nbuilt it it's the same thing today if\nyou're on a social media platform you\nwant to go after this big person\nhit the smaller people that really value\nyou and would really be your ambassador\nthe big people will talk about it sooner\nor\njust comes straight to later and they're\ngoing to say well why am i going to be\nthe first one to invest in your brand\nwhen nobody else does and it's it's just\nall done on just a different platform\ntoday yeah i love that though what you\njust shared with your story that's\ngenius i mean just understanding the\npositioning of bouncers because i think\nsometimes people\nin a negative impact on ourselves is we\nlook at oh look these people are not\nthey're not big enough you know they're\nnot important right\nthey're the best exactly exactly like\nthat's actually where it starts and and\nyou've got to value those people as much\nas you'd value the big person listen you\nknow i use the example of window\nshoppers you know there's a lot of\npeople and we've all felt like this\nwhoever's watching or maybe you that\nmaybe a certain point in time in your\nlife you didn't look right or the people\ndidn't treat you right when you walked\ninto a store they think they thought\nthat maybe you weren't their customer or\nyou got it like that that happened a lot\nof times right so you know\nwindow shoppers are the best i'll tell\nyou why you know i have a couple of\ndollars now i'm okay you know if i go\nand buy a brand\nnew i wanna wear some y3s today\ni'm not gonna i'm not gonna brag about\nit there's no reason now you know i have\nmoney but if a window shopper sits there\nand goes into the store and doesn't have\nany money and they go you know\none day i want them to get money i'm\ngonna buy those y3s you know how many\npeople are gonna tell that to they're\ngonna tell it to a million people man\nwhich i get those wide threes baby\nwhere'd they get\nthat became your ambassador that person\njust shared it with a thousand people\nyou know and those people are extremely\nextremely important and that's where\npower should happen because what happens\nis you build an influence with people\nthey're influencers too they are just\ntalking about it in a different way\nso we actually totally don't understand\npowershift\nwe don't understand what a lot of people\ndo a lot of people a lot of people are\ndoing it and they don't realize they're\ndoing it they don't have a method to it\nyeah and so you know but why not have a\nmethod to negotiating because you know\nthe only thing that separates you and me\nand from everybody else is what we have\nnegotiated in life that's it it's the\ndeals we've taken the deals we haven't\ntaken a lot of time not the deals that\nyou haven't uh taken it's the deals you\ndid take to screw you up right yeah and\nthe only thing that separates us and\ni've seen thousands of pitches only that\nseparates us his ability to negotiate\nyeah i was telling my team just now like\nbefore i really got into all of this i\nwas this close i was offered this\npodcast deal and it was before this one\nwhen we did it for real and i was this\nclose to taking it because at that time\ni was positioning myself for considering\nmyself\nless influential than the person who was\noffering it to me right and so i was\ngoing to sign this pretty bad deal for\nme because i thought oh it's going to\nget my foot in the door it's going to\ngive me that break luckily my lawyers\nheld me back and we did it the right way\nbut tell me when is that time when\nyou're kind of like up and coming and\nyou're trying to you're trying to break\ninto that space what is your best advice\nfor someone like that when it comes to\nthe deals they should and shouldn't take\nbecause sometimes in our desperation\nor in our lack of influence we kind of\nget we make big mistakes in what we say\nyes to you know that's a good question\nall those are personal decisions that\nneed to be made right um because you\ncould have taken a crappy deal here\nbecause\nyou felt that you were going to do more\nin this world or whatever the cases\nmeaning\nbethany on um\nshe's in the book bethany on housewives\nshe wanted to put out skinny girls so\nshe didn't care how much housewives was\npaying her initially so it all depends\non where is the value and and i think\nthe question right there that if\nsomebody asks themselves is what's their\nwhy and what do they want to get out of\nit what's the reason you're doing it for\nyeah i see a lot of people who say\nwell i want to make a million dollars\nall right what are you gonna do you get\nthe million dollars\nand they're like i don't know yeah\nyou're gonna you're gonna buy one really\nexpensive car like a bugatti you're\ngonna buy\nuh investment homes to help pay you know\npay for your way of life or\nyou know or are you going to live off 30\n000 a year in bali uh for 10 years and\nuh you know and and and carve canoes so\nyou know what i mean\nbut what is it right yeah and a lot of\npeople when they get to that point of\ni'm assigned to deal with the podcast or\ni'm going to do this show or i'm going\nto marry this woman or i'm going to what\nis the what's the why the true why and\nwe we so often don't know our why\nabsolutely and you talk about finding\nyour light right like finding that light\nin your book and it's\ni feel like but do we not know the why\nbecause we're just seeing shiny objects\nand it's like that shiny object syndrome\nwhere we just go chase things\nwhat is that reason that we don't stop\nback like why are you pushing so much\nbecause we haven't taken inventory of\nourselves the proper way you know\nbecause\nsome are in some some are in shiny\nobjects some are\nmy parents my parents uh you know my\nparents grew up as uh they're both\ndoctors and that's what the family\nshould be doctors\nbut you don't want to be a doctor but\nyou would just believe that that's what\nit was right or you know what you know\nwhat whatever it is uh it's society\nit's fear\nmost a lot of times it's fear you know i\ncan't quit my job uh because i'm not\ngonna be able to make money\nbut you know did you really realize were\nyou making money or not you know what i\nmean what's your why i remember a woman\nwho used to work for me uh she she\nstarted working for me and she had left\nuh a job and i i was like well why'd you\nleave the job she said i realized that i\nwas going to work to get paid to fight\nand i was like\nwhat do you mean she said i would work\nnine to five every single day\nuh five days a week and then on the\nweekends i would get shit-faced and just\nhave fights at bars because i was so\nmiserable with my job\nand the people around me and she worked\nin a very violent kind of situation\nshe didn't know her why anymore then she\ncame to me and started working in a\ncharitable area and she never had a\nfight again and she was she was happy\nbut she had to check herself and check\nher why yeah absolutely i always joke i\nwas i grew up in a family where i could\nbe a doctor a lawyer or a failure like\nthose are my free options right it was\nlike you either those two or you kind of\ndidn't make it because you didn't do\nanything right and you're so right that\nself-inventory check of wait what is my\npurpose like why am i doing this like do\ni even care about being this what's\nbecome your why as time has changed like\nhow has your why changed has it upgraded\nhas it become deeper better what what's\nwhat's really i say this is upgraded\nbecause i can't i can't doubt anybody\nfor whatever their why is right there's\nno there's no better why yours is not\nbetter than mine has it changed\nabsolutely i'm 50 years old now and my\nwhy has changed uh\nuh\n10 times um\nbut the core to my why it was a friend\nof mine who explained to me the core of\nmy why the one thing that didn't change\nis that i wanted to serve others and i\nsaid wow i was like i don't want to\nserve others\nhe was like yes you do i was like no i\ndon't he was like listen you start a\nbrand fool before it's biased you want\nto empower a culture you could have\ncalled it like many designers ralph\nlauren and tommy hilfiger call it their\nown name you could have called it\ndaymond john not sure if it'll work\nthey're not but whatever the case is\nright\nuh then you go and\nyou start acquiring other brands and\nhelping people then you start writing\nbooks too and the books weren't about my\nlifestyle the books were display of\npower how you and i have the same power\nthe brand within you're the brand\npowerful yeah then you go on you start\ninvesting on people uh and people\non shark tank and start giving back\neducational stuff there and then you\nstart becoming a motivational speaker\nyou're always thinking about how\nempowering somebody else and i thought\nabout it and i said\nwell maybe i guess you know and um um\nbut\nthat didn't start off like that i\nstarted off wanting to just dress\nhip-hop people and i loved hip-hop you\nknow i never thought of it like that so\nyou start to define you know yourself\nand see clarity down the road but you\nknow maybe you're 18 years old right now\nlisten to this and you have the clarity\ni mean you know my\nmy youngest my oldest daughter is a is a\nchampionship ballroom dancer she's been\nwanting to do that since she was born\nshe she always knew her why um\nyeah for some of us we know it straight\naway for most of us yeah it takes a bit\nof a journey yeah and and i think you're\nright it's like you just got to be\nhonest with what your why is right now\ntake inventory yeah exactly sometimes\nwe're trying to figure out like what's\nmy y gonna be in like five ten years\nfifteen you don't change yeah you change\nyou don't know like you can't predict it\nyou right you gotta figure out right now\nand i know that for me my why's been you\nknow there's been wise that have been\nsimple like what you said like wanting\nto serve people and make a difference\nyeah and then when i was a kid like my\nwife was just i just want to be happy i\njust want to have fun right and it\nchanges and i think that\na lot of people today we can get closer\nto our why by taking that self-awareness\ncheck by just taking that inventory i\nlove that advice so in your book you\ntalk about\nbeing diagnosed and with cancer yeah and\nlike for me i feel like no matter how\npowerful or strong or\nanyone would be shaken by that news yeah\nand and and i\nthere can be a shift in someone's life\nthere's a power shot right 100 yeah tell\nus about that moment when you find out\nyeah i share a very personal story about\nabout the cancer thing so i go into the\nhospital uh\nbecause i got an executive physical and\nthen they said well let's check your uh\nwhat are these veins here court uh\nkarata\nyeah check your karate veins to see if\nthey're clogged at all or whatever so it\ncould reduce you're feeling some pain or\nsomething no no no so so all right so if\ni want to back it up and i know that you\ntalk about health and wellness a lot uh\na gentleman of mine a good friend of\nmine who uh was actually the manager of\nuh secret android and muhammad ali said\nlisten with all your money why don't you\never go get an executive physical and i\nsaid\nnever heard of that i said i get a\nphysical every year i said you know the\ndoctor grabs my bean bag and then turns\nme around smacks me in my ass and told\nme to go about my business and\neverything is fine i caught up and\neverything's fine right yeah he's like\nno no get executive physical i go down\nto\nucla it's two days of running through\nall kinds of things six million dollar\nman type of stuff right and they check\neverything on your body and then they\ngive that report back to your doctor so\nthey're checking my carotid veins and\nthey're saying you know let's make sure\nthere's no clogging there so you know\nno possibility of a stroke and they say\nokay\nrejected but they go you know you have a\nlittle nodule on your thyroid you need\nto go check that out go down to the\ndoctor my doctor he says all right i'm\ngonna take a biopsy 90 chance we know\nwhat it is 10 chance we don't know what\nit is of course 10 chance\nthey don't know what it is\ngo to a surgeon he says you're 50 years\nold uh let me tell you something right\nnow if you were 90 i would say no matter\nwhat don't do anything but you're 50.\nand so we're you have a choice we could\ntake out your thyroid but here's the\nissue\n50 chance we're taking out a perfectly\ngood thyroid 50 chance of taking out\nsomething that could be challenging to\nyou i go and get the

surgeon in the world\nwhere it comes this he knew what it was\nand i can tell\nso i had to mentally debate with myself\nif that that mass was that large and and\npotentially moved into my lymph nodes\nand then it would move into my brain and\ni could potentially have that and take\nthe radiation pills and chemotherapy\nwhat's the chance of me dying\nright and it could be a very\nlong road of recovery and i could die\nso i said to myself listen i have to\nwait take inventory\ntwo daughters 121 to 126 beautiful women\nmy ex-wife great these girls are uh\nbenefits of society they're great

definitely gonna be able to\nget another husband\ni'm gonna drink myself to death no\nproblem i'm gonna go fishing every\nsingle day i've lived the better a\nbetter life than i've lived 10 lives\nalready you can't believe what i do i'm\ncool i've accepted death or\njust the flip side i want to walk my\ndaughters down the aisle my mother\nshould not have to bury me my\nthree-year-old she's gonna need me my\nwife is super hot i get to sleep with\nthat woman all every night every day\nholy so i had to negotiate with\nmyself first that's a power shift you\nhave to negotiate with yourself first am\ni going to take this on and when i\nshifted my mind to saying that i'm not\ngoing to allow this cancer and even if\nit is moving to my brain and we still\ndon't know you know you have to always\nget checked um you know if it isn't our\nbrain it's not gonna it's not gonna beat\nme right and before the two weeks came\nback because it was like a week and a\nhalf into that\ni totally forgot i even was waiting for\nresults\nand when the results came back thank god\ni was clear um but would they still\ncheck me out but you know that made me\nsay to myself that's what we always have\nto do we have to have this negotiation\nwith ourselves before taking a podcast\nor walking away from it because your\nattorneys are like don't do it and\nyou're like but this is not your life\nthis is my life this is my only shot\nright now as far as i'm concerned this\nperson's bigger than i am but you had to\nnegotiate with yourself saying you know\nwhat\nyou're here for a reason because you're\nyou're my attorney you've probably seen\nthis before\ni know that i'm not going to stop and\nyou know what it's a shitty deal and why\nshould i take a shitty deal yeah i'd\nrather i'd rather because that shitty\ndeals i'm probably still gonna be broke\nor not whatever the case is but i'll be\nbroke underneath somebody else i'd\nrather be broke knowing i made the right\ndecision that i was in charge of my\ndestiny and that's what happened you had\nto have negotiation with yourself yeah i\nlove that thank you for sharing that by\nthe way the full picture of it because\nthe way you just gave those two framings\nyeah i mean\nboth i mean one was really well told and\nhilarious and one was like how most\npeople would see it and for me hearing\nboth those perspectives i mean i've got\na mentor a spiritual mentor who's helped\nthousands of people back in london he's\ncurrently got stage four brain cancer oh\nmy god and but the amazing thing that\nhe's done and i think he may not say in\nthe same words as you but he's\nnegotiated with himself and all he\nemanates his gratitude yeah you could\njust not see this man in pain like you\nyou know anyone else would just be\nfalling apart all he does is thank\neveryone for the work they've done the\nservice they've given others how they've\nserved god because that's his world like\nhe's just emanating this gratitude to\neveryone and you can see that even in\nlike\nthe peak of pain yeah someone's able to\nreframe that sure like you were able to\ndo which is which is phenomenal and and\ni'm glad that you know we we pray and\nhope that you get to continue doing all\nthe incredible work in that way man\nthank you yeah but that's awesome i love\nthat tell us about\nlet's go back a bit to building a\npersonal brand yeah because i feel like\nthat is such a hot topic today\neveryone's trying to do it where are you\nseeing the mistake between building a\nbrand versus actually building yourself\nto be the brand if you know what i mean\nlike the perception i i where's your\ntake on again inaccurate inventory of\nyourself and not knowing your why and\nalso projecting something that you\n[Music]\nyou know you don't\nit's not real\nyou know\num people perceive that brands are only\nbuilt on positive things um and i hope\nthat everybody here listening will\nlead a life that's morally correct and\nthings of that nature but\nold dirty bastard was an old dirty\nbastard i mean this is what it is right\nand he lived off of that right and there\nare a lot of brands out there and people\nwill resonate with you if you you know\nfor a lack of a better word keep it 100\nright um and that's the brand that you\ngot to build because today with\ntransparency with all social media and\nvarious other things your brand can be\nstripped apart in a minute and you we\nsee it happen all the time right we we\ncan talk about all the kardashians of\nthe world and this and that who build\nnice brands but how many people in the\nnews every other week you're saying that\nperson's done\nyou know their their morals and their\nethics were off off kilter and what they\nwhat they what they acted like they were\nyeah you know so um what i'm not i'm not\nabout politics but look at our president\nyou know some people hate him some\npeople absolutely love him but he's he's\ntrue to his brand however you want to\nuh perceive it and some of us have\ndiscussed it and some of us are like\nthat's my guy\nbut and and you know listen he's the\nmost powerful man in the world and\nchanging the way that a presidency has\nbeen looked at for\nyou know hundreds of years think about\nthat yeah absolutely and it's a powerful\nbrand either way\nuh yeah brand either way yeah tell you\nyou say that your super power\nis picking good people yeah now as a\ngrowing entrepreneur with multiple\nbusinesses that are growing for myself\ni find and i speak to entrepreneurs in\nthe same space all the time we find\nrecruitment is probably the hardest\nthing like it's a it's a genuine\nchallenge\nand i want to know some of your advice\nwhen i'm recruiting what have you seen\nto be those giveaways those tips those\ntechniques the the principles that\nyou've noticed when you're hiring and\nthe the you know you've got like\ndecades of experience of hiring the\nwrong and the right yeah tell tell us a\nbit about that process well most of my\nmost of my most of my staff started as a\nthird-party vendors or interns\nthe dating process um and i noticed that\nthe interns when they came to the office\nbefore people who got paid to come to\noffice they leave after\nthey are the ones who i would end up\nhiring that year or five years down the\nroad and and they they came into office\nthey were problem solvers they were\nswiss army knives um but they were\nlikable too\nyou know\nmy businesses that have failed and my\nemployees that have not really uh grown\nwe just didn't like\nyou know a lot of people think that uh\nyou know you know don't get me wrong\ndon't hire an intern for your attorney\nthat that's probably that's probably not\na great idea right or you're for a\ndoctor right now i don't have an intern\nbut um\nyou know\nonce you give a resume to somebody that\njust gets your foot in the door after\nthat i want to know\ncan i sit next to you for eight hours a\nday five days a week for the next five\nyears of my life yeah right\nand same with an investment my my\nentrepreneurs uh that we failed at a lot\nof times i didn't like them when they\ndidn't like me whatever the case is but\nif there were 10 problems i'm not\npicking up the phone 10 times to talk to\nyou i don't like you maybe one time\nwe'll pick up the phone\nright uh the other ones were successful\nsome of those businesses failed but then\nwe did another business together\nso i look for people that take\nresponsibility i love asking people you\nknow there's two questions i like to ask\nthem you know do you look in the toilet\nafter you get up\nright um also what has ever happened to\nyou that was out of your control after\nyou were 15 or 16 years old now if they\ndon't tell me something unfortunately\ndevastating like\ni was part of california fires or i grew\nup in darfur or a drunk driver hit me\nthen nothing else was out of your\ncontrol\nand you want people who take\nresponsibility you know i put a post up\nonline the other day and it was like me\nin one a hallway shot in vegas and i\nsaid man 30 days in\nfor the new year and i've been on the\nroad 18 or 20 days and i have to thank\nmy wife she's allowing me to be who i am\num but i got to tell you everybody i\nthis is me and i'm very selfish and you\ngot to be selfish because if you're not\nselfish for yourself then you're not\ngoing to be able to be\nyou know you're not going to be able to\nbe um\ngood for anybody else you have to be\nselfish\nand know your priorities\nand couple people wrote back\nwhat are you talking about i can't be\nselfish i have kids\nthose are my priorities and i can't be\nselfish right you knew that you had a\nkid right yeah it's not the kid's fault\ndefinitely not the kid's fault\nthat was your priority that is a\ndecision you made that you're ignoring\nthrough the process of everything else\nno that should be part of your\nselfishness or i got to take care of my\nkids however i got to put in hours here\nto help help my kid whatever the case is\nbut don't neglect it it's like people\nyou know you're a man of color like i am\ni don't want to hear you telling me that\nyou're a person of course i understand\nsystem uh systemic racism has happened\nand everything else but\ni'm not waking up chinese tomorrow or\npurple or white\nokay let me get over it how am i going\nto now move on with life and and and and\nand be uh somebody who's responsible and\ncontribute and that's what i look for\nfor in my employees yeah that's great\nadvice man now i know i'm definitely\ngoing to ask a few of those questions\nsome of the some of the funny ones to\ncatch them out but also some of the real\nones and i think the dating phase as you\nput it is makes complete sense i feel\nlike interviews and dates are too alike\nyeah but the dating phase of\nexperimenting taking someone with you i\nknow for me with my videographers i'm\nalways like travel with me for a week\nyeah because i want to see if i can like\nyou for a week we can be together for a\nweek you can deal with me having a good\nday and a bad day yeah you can deal with\nme being not interesting and really\ninteresting the next day like you can\ndeal with the fact that i'm a normal\nhuman being sure i'm not always on and\noff and and you know even even if i was\nwith\nsomebody like that\ni'm also watching other things are you\nnow learning editing\nare you learning um cg are you learning\nyou know while you're out there because\nif you're only going to do this are you\nlearning new equipment are you learning\nnew ways because i want to see you being\na problem solver because what you're\ngoing to do you're going to plateau at a\ncertain point now i got to get\nanother videographer and an editor when\nyou can maybe solve that challenge for\nme and if you can i know you're trying\nyes and if you can't work it out you\nknow what you're going to do that person\nthey're going to say i'm not really good\nat it but i kind of learned the basics\nand let me bring this other person in or\nlet me help you like a problem solver\nyeah i can relate to what you said\nearlier like i feel like i'm someone who\nlikes to give people the benefit of the\ndoubt yeah i like to trust rather than\nlike micromanage and like switch over\npeople's shoulder\nwhat do you like when you feel someone\nhas intentionally screwed you over or\nmanipulated you or taken advantage how\ndo you respond and react to that and how\nhave you seen that response\nbe more effective as you become more\nmature in business\ni'd love some training basically i'm\nasking for free coaching right now yeah\nno problem yeah um well first of all i i\ntry to understand\nfirst of all i don't take it personal\nnumber one because i say to myself i\ndon't know if that person's mother\ntold them all their life you know\nthe only way you're gonna get anywhere\nis to stab people in the back or they\ngrew up in a we\nthere's a lot of people grow growing up\nin very challenging areas so i don't\nhold it personal they're just trying to\nwin that whatever they did was their\nform of\nuh trying to win right so uh i think it\nwas what's the book there's a book uh\nhabits of influential people you know\nyeah so the seven habits of highly\neffective yeah yeah and they talk about\nwhen you're playing chess with somebody\nif they make a move and do you get mad\nat them and curse them out because they\nmade that move no because they're trying\nto win right so i look at the same way\nalso then i look at it are they a good\nespecially with friends i always say to\nmyself because i cut off people here and\nthere because i meet new people and i\nnot that they're replacing others\nbut i always say if you're not a good\nenough friend to yourself\nthen you'll never be a good friend of me\nright so i do those two things i\nnormally don't try to get people back i\nalways say it is what it is\nappreciate it\nnice knowing you yeah\nhowever this is where it goes into\nnegotiations and building influence\nif somebody does come to me about that\nperson down the road i'm gonna tell them\nwhat happened yeah you know um\nand that person\nthat screwed me will will not know i'll\ni'll tell i'm probably not talking to\nthem anymore but they don't realize how\ndetrimental that was because now what if\nthey screwed 50 people and those 50\npeople all told 50 people totally and\nand if they exclude someone who has some\ninfluence\nyeah and i'm not going to go out of my\nway in public tell people but if you\ncome to me and say hey i'm supposed to\nwork with so forth and so on i may say\ndepends on the on the relationship\nviolation i may go\nwell if i ain't got anything good to say\ni'm not going to say anything at all\nyeah or i might go\noh no that person's a thief a person\nstole yeah yeah because you want to be\nhonest with that person too\nyeah 100 because then\nwhat if i didn't say that and then they\nscrew you yeah and then now you were\nchecked with and it reflects badly on\nyou again yeah people just don't think\nabout that yeah they don't think about\nthat i'm actually going through that\nscenario right now in a particular area\nof my work and i was just sharing the\nsame thing with my team who in here\nscrewed you\nit was not no one in this room you know\nyou know it works on it works in the\nopposite way too you know um yeah about\nnegotiation and building influence that\nyou know we look at the social networks\nand stuff like that we look at that as\nhow powerful it is but it really started\nfrom one thing networking now what i've\nnoticed that uh you know if i just meet\nyou at a bar and uh you're\nyou have a small commercial building\nyou're looking for a great plumber i'm\nnot gonna recommend my um\nmy uncle zeke because\nuh he burnt the turkey during\nthanksgiving he named he never paid me\nback ten dollars from you know for three\nyears and he punched me in my my mouth\nsix six you know when i was six years\nold\nbut if i met somebody else who's a\nplumber recently\ni'd say\ni don't really know this person that\nwell they seem like they were really\nbuttoned up organized person i don't\nknow them that well but you know what\nwhy don't you take the card and you call\nthem\nsee what happens yeah because i have no\nvested interest there but yet i shared\nit with somebody else and that's exactly\nwhat social media and retweeting\nwhatever the case is and that builds\ninfluence\nthat's why networking is so big uh but a\nlot of people just don't grasp the\nsimplicity of what we're talking about\nhere yeah when we talk about that we're\ntalking about networking and even now\nwhen i was asking you for coaching you\ntalk a lot about how the biggest mistake\nentrepreneurs make is not having mentors\nin their life i 100 agree with you i\nthink the challenge right now is that\nyou have a group of people who want\npeople to be their mentor i'm so i mean\ni don't know how many times you get\nasked that question like david will you\nbe my mentor will you be my mentor\nwhat is the process to ask someone to be\na mentor what does that look like when\nsomeone's asking that that's a good\nquestion so first of all why do you want\nthem to be the mentor because um you\nknow\ndo you want them because they understand\nthe fundamentals because a health mentor\nand a business mentor embarrass other\npeople going to be different ways uh you\nknow also what's in it for the mentor\ni have a lot of people come and tell me\ntheir problems\nright and it's cool but there's an old\nsaying don't tell me about your problems\n20 don't care and the other 80 are\nreally happy you have them right so why\nthe hell are you telling me you got damn\nproblems i got my own problems\nwhat's in it for the mentor that's the\nchallenge that i find with a lot of the\nthe people that seek out mentors and\nalso are the mentors accessible\nuh you can try to get a hold of me as a\nmentor and hopefully i can be one but\nthat's why i write the books and do\nsocial media but you're gonna talk to me\nwell one time every six months\nbut if you have somebody that that has a\ncar dealership locally in your\nneighborhood\nwho's been there for 20 years that\nperson understands the fundamentals of\nbusiness just like anybody else they've\nbeen through inflation they've been\nthrough changing of technology they've\nbeen through all kinds of stuff right\nfor 20 years why are you looking to me\nyou're going to talk to me once every\nsix months where you can go over there\nand wash those cars for that person and\nget your uh you know uh your karate kid\non over there yeah a wipe on wipe off\nwhatever it is and talk to that person\nright what's in it for the mentor right\nso you want me to teach you about\nbusiness clean some damn cars over here\nyeah or you want damon john to teach you\nwell you know that i love to save\nanimals go donate some time at the aspca\nor animal shelter three days two days a\nweek argument's sake and i'll spend one\nhour a day speaking you\nwhat's in it for that person yeah i\nthink that's great advice and because i\nthink sometimes mentorship now is it's\ngrowing in its popularity it's become\nlike a popularity contest to some degree\nso you just want to be able to say\nsomeone's your mentor\nyeah you know it's as it grows in\npopularity like i feel the same way i\nsay this all the time i'm like half the\ntime richard branson or you or whoever\nmay not be the right mentor this person\nin your local business could be the\nright person\nand then like what you said i've i talk\na lot about how you can be mentored by\npeople you've never met by reading their\nbooks by studying i was mentored by\nnapoleon hill that's who you told me\nthink and grow rich i i've read the book\nnow 17 times\nyeah yeah and for me i've always said\npeople like martin luther king steve\njobs einstein like i've studied their\nlives i've looked at how they made good\nand bad decisions what they got right\nhow they did it how they thought about\nstuff yeah and i've learned so much more\ni never met any of them and and i think\nthere's so much power in that well\nthat's the power that's that's why\nyou're you're sharing people the power\nof reading or audio books because what\nyou'll find\nis that\na lot of the people didn't know each\nother steve jobs may not have known this\nperson that person but when you start to\nfind defining and similarities and all\nthese great uh\npieces of information you're getting i\nmean is everybody wrong yeah you know\nyeah exactly and you find patterns right\nlike there's patterns they may be\ndifferent they're all goal setters right\nthey all are\nfocused on something they all are driven\nthey all have failed but they fail fast\nthey've all reset their goals they all\nyou know focus generally on some level\nof family spirituality or health there's\nsomething you know and and yeah you can\nfind it all in all these books yeah what\nare some of the\nmistakes you're seeing people make in\nnegotiations we talked about a few of\nthem of like you know going straight in\nfor the kill stream for the win what are\nthe other common mistakes not knowing\nwhere they're willing to settle or where\nthey're will or or or what they want to\nget out of\nwhat they're doing so you don't have\nyour boundaries set up you don't have\nyour boundaries set up\num not stating in the beginning or\nyou know\nyou know everybody feels that if they\nsay the number first they're the one who\nloses a lot of time you set the\nboundaries for it and you just know\nwhere it's at right\nnot caring about the other person\nwhat they want and not listening to them\ncutting them off you know when\nwhen you know you're supposed to\ncommunicate like your face is built\nright like you have one mouth and two\nears right you're supposed to listen\ntwice as much as you um\ntalk\nand if i said to you right now\nuh you know i'm not really feeling that\nwell but so i think i'm gonna go to the\nstore and get\nyou know you may if you cut me off you\ndon't know if i'm gonna say i'm gonna go\nto the store and get some medicine or\ni'm gonna go get some food or i'm gonna\ngo to sort of\npick up my wife and she's gonna take me\nhome from there you've never heard the\nlast part of the information and when\npeople are communicating with you almost\nthe most valuable piece of information\nthey're trying to share is at the end\na lot of people try to cut people off\nand stuff like that\nalso not understanding body language and\nhow people communicate you know over\nsixty percent of communication is body\nlanguage only eight percent is what\npeople\ncare about is only eight percent is what\nyou say and the rest is how you say it\nyeah that's for sure that is 100 for\nsure what's the worst body language in a\nnegotiation that you've seen or you've\nperceived is it as simple as like you\nknow closed body language crosstans or\nis it more like just lack of eye contact\nand lack of like what are the what is it\nfirst of all it's a handshake yeah\nsecond of all it's not remembering\npeople's names\nright\num but it depends on what side of the\ntable you're on\nyou know with\ni'm uh\nyou know if i'm a guy and i'm\nnegotiating with you and i feel\nlike um it's okay if i want to do the\ndeal or not but if your legs are cocked\nspread wide open and or you're you know\nyou're you're you're your legs on a\ntriangle and you're leaning back i'm\nfeeling like you're trying to assert\ndominance on me\nright\nso what am i going to do i'm going to\nstart\neither leaning back or doing the same\nright so it all depends on how you're\nlooking at at the individual you know\nwhat i mean and and and and and listen\nyou could be in a cold room and\nsomebody's crossing their arms\nit doesn't necessarily mean that\nuh it's because you know they're trying\nto play off you know um so those are a\nlot of things that people can do like\nwhen you're looking at body language is\nvery important if you walk into a room\nand you want to have more of an intimate\ndiscussion don't put any objects between\nyou now we have mics between us but\nyou'll see people and they don't they're\nnot conscious they're doing it but\nthey'll put big trays in between people\nand big phone because they want to\ncreate this distance because they don't\nthey they don't want to be that close\nyou know what i mean yeah big table and\ntrays and then yeah yeah and listen this\nis a lot of little keys you can use you\nknow uh people believe that you're less\nlikely to lie when you're touching them\nso make sure when you're leaving you\nknow you shake their hand and say at\nthat moment i can't wait to do further\nbusiness with you that's how you feel\nthat's going to be twice as more\neffective than just saying it when you\nleave yeah totally the thing i find\nthough that with the people who do this\nmaturely and immaturely is like\nsometimes you see someone who's\nfollowing the textbook version but it's\na technique it's not real right and i\nfeel like that's what you always sense\nthat you know you can sense when someone\nlike knows all the nlp and the perfect\nway to look at someone yeah like you\nknow and you learn all those techniques\nbut then when it's not genuine when when\nthat person doesn't believe it\nsomeone like you who's been in business\nfor many many years is going to sense\nthat straight away yeah you know when\nyou sense that when they're they're\nthey're all buttoned up they're printing\nand every time you ask a question they\ngo and you know what that's a really\ngood question you know that's\nnot a good question and i ask them\nstupid ass questions sometimes so then\nthey tell me that's a really good\nquestion i go okay no problem i i wanna\ncan i one day just watch you into\nyourself i just wanna watch like i just\nwanna literally i can just hide anywhere\nbehind the curtain or whatever it is i\njust wanna watch honestly i'm not even\njoking it'd be hilarious we should film\nit we should edit it up like we should\ndo that we should show you catching\npeople out it should be in addition to\nshark tank it should be an added moment\noh it's one shark tank because yeah\npictures sometimes an hour and a half\nlong and you don't see when we're when\nwe're saying stuff like that yeah you\nknow what i mean yeah but you must laugh\na lot in between of course yeah you must\nlaugh a lot in between the kind of stuff\nif you think i'm saying crazy you should\nusually hear barbara and kevin oh really\noh my god but they don't say on camera\nbut you say they say it on camera they\nsay abc edits it out because you got\nthese poor little kids watching the show\ntell me about you know having been in\nbusiness i mean since you worked at 10\nyears old so four decades of of\nexperience what challenges you now\nin a negotiation a persuasion in\nbusiness what is like the thing that\nchallenges you now and it may not even\nbe business it might be more personal\nwhat's what keeps you excited and\nfocused saying no saying no challenging\nme now because you know you want to say\nyes to everything\nright and it's and it's and the only\nthing you can't get back is time so your\ninventory is your time\num i think that's the most challenging\nthing um because listen at 50 if i do\ndeals right now um\nit may be around until i'm 70. do i know\nthat that's what i want to still do\nyou know and work that hard on new\nbusinesses\nbut i just love business too and the\nopportunity is there right so i think\nthat's the biggest challenge um\nuh yeah that's it and time yeah because\ni need more time to take care of my\nhealth and be with my my little girl\nso it's really time i look at was there\na deal that you're like i wish i never\npassed on that were any of those have\nyou always felt good about no no never\nbecause um\nit doesn't mean that if i did the deal\nthat the outcome would have been the\nsame\nand um some deals i've passed on\num have turned to be\nreally big big big deals however if i if\ni if i go in life being concerned about\nthe ones i pass on but what about all\nthe ones that failed that i passed on\nright i can't you know you can't have it\nall yeah yeah but it seems like you have\nthat sense of like that detachment and\nthat bird's eye view because i feel like\nthat that takes a lot of maturity too to\nbe able to no it takes being screwed a\nbunch of times and losing a bunch of\nmoney on shitty deals and then going\nwait a minute wait a minute mr know it\nall yeah yeah did you check those boxes\nprior to doing the deals that you know\nyou need to check no you emotionally was\ninvested in and you got too excited\nabout it yeah tell us that actually i\nlike that because it when i'm listening\nto you like\nyou know you have a big heart you're\noptimistic you want people to win yeah\nwhich are all beautiful emotional\nqualities\nwhen is it right to let emotion be\nuseful in business and when it can it be\nwrong i think gut\nin motion two different things i think\nyour gut told you not to do the podcast\nyeah um\nso i think we don't trust our gut i\ndidn't start to learn to trust my gut\nuntil i was about 35 years old\nfor two reasons i think that at first i\nwas like nobody who you david mr\nknow-it-all why you know whatever you\nknow what i mean or the numbers look\ngood on paper yeah or whatever cases and\ni didn't learn to trust my gut um\nemotion is fine but you still gotta\ncheck the boxes you still gotta say\nman i really wanna do this you know like\nyou know listen it's like meeting a\nbeautiful\ngirl for me but for other people it\ncould be guy or girl whatever the case\nis and everything's right\nit only goes down after that usually you\nknow\nyeah when you think everything's right\nyou know you go on a date with her and\n and it's really nice and then she\ntakes her teeth out\nyou know the table nothing wrong with\nhaving fake teeth but you didn't tell me\nabout those yeah you know what i mean\nand then she just\nshe smells really bad\ni didn't i didn't it sounds like it's\nhappened to you before no\num\nand that's what happens usually with\nbusinesses and stuff like that you get\nreally excited over it but maybe you\ndidn't look at all the boxes is the\ndistribution right is the operator the\npartner is there are they a great\npartner you know um so\nit just happened so it has happened to\nme in the past a lot um so now i'm i'm\nalmost like you know i like to say like\ni'm a i don't get buyer's remorse as\nmuch because it's like if i go to the\nstore and i see something i really like\ni don't buy it right away yeah i go home\nbut if i can't get that off my mind i'll\ngo back yeah right and it's the same\nthing in the business you see shark tank\nyou know it it it it's it's it's all\nspeeded up because we're right there in\nthe room that time and i gotta make that\ndecision but normally other businesses i\ncan look at it for two months three\nmonths six months they're like well we\ngot another deal coming all right take\nit\nif not you know yeah i'll look at it for\na little while yeah you were mentioning\nthat you were spending a lot more time\non your health and wellness now like\nthat's become a priority what are some\nof the\nroutines or aspects that have become key\nfor you personally in the way you're\ndoing it um i try to get an iv every\nweek okay uh you know um\ni started taking testosterone because uh\ni had a low low testosterone level but i\ndidn't realize and right around the time\nwith the cancer i didn't realize that\nmaybe half the reason i was thinking so\nnegatively because i had low\ntestosterone like that almost puts you\nin depression\nright you know so you know i make sure i\ntake that um\nuh i'm trying to stop cut down on\nalcohol and on um meats uh and go more\num plant-based um\nof course uh you know i'm being on the\nroad a lot i need i i rip my my shoulder\nbut i need to you know obviously try to\nput in an hour to two hours worth of\nsome level of\ncardio every single day and i go to the\ndoctor\nas much as i\nacupuncture as well um and then i go to\nthe doctor as much as i can to have my\nblood levels checked and everything else\nto make sure that everything's in line i\nmake that a priority over everything\nelse\nyeah and those all sound like good\neasy to do things now yeah and i try and\ni try to alkaline my body as much as\npossible yeah you know green juices and\neverything else yeah that's a huge one i\ni've been taking celery juice for the\npast three months it's changed my life\nyeah i heard celery it's really great\nlife-changing i mean i had a lot of\npeople there was a lot of\nwe we had the king of celery juice on\nthe podcast the medical medium and it's\nlike a lot of people are like oh he's\njust trying to make money i was like he\ndoesn't own celery like you know yeah\nbut like you know the guy doesn't maybe\nhe owned celery first you drink it every\nmorning yeah i drink it every morning\nit's changed my life and i was the same\nlike it was to outline my body it was\nthe same thing and and i started doing\nit for the past three months and i feel\nphenomenal and i was and i can't and\nit's it's not just a placebo effect\nbecause i know how my stomach feels\nright right you know what i mean it's\nnot just how i feel up here it's like i\ncan tell them i go do they sell it like\nthat oh you gotta go get it blended at\nthe whole at the um the natural foods so\nthere's a method of blending it\nperfectly to have its most like rich\nform at home which he talks about his\nbook but i just get it i just pick it up\nlike creation or catholic gratitude or\none of these health stores\nbut you can do it to the perfect\nkind of consistency and the celery juice\nking told you that yeah well that's not\nhis name his name is the medical medium\nbut he's like well known for okay so he\ndidn't name himself celery juice he did\nnot call himself that i just called him\nthat yeah call him celery juice king\nyeah\nis that a good name\ni guess make you listen no no he's like\nhe's the guy who's like most well known\nfor being the movement bringer of like\ndrink more celery got it that's what i\nmean but but it worked as if my point is\nit works i feel better so it's got it\nit's great uh a few more things that i\nwant to touch on you've just you know\neven from today's the first time we're\nmeeting you know we never met a lot of\npeople who have on the podcast i've met\nthem before i'm friends with them i know\nthem i didn't i was fascinated by you\nbecause i find you hilarious i find you\nreal\nuh i find you someone who leads with\ntheir heart but takes their head with\nthem effectively sure uh in the way you\nmake decisions\nwhere\nyou talk about legacy in your book and\nbuilding legacy\nwhat's building your legacy right now\nlike where are you seeing your legacy go\ni think my legacy is being built um by\nmen women people of color people who\nfelt that they didn't have the the\nwherewithal or the resources to become\nsuccessful and i think that they see me\nbecause i make it very transparent about\ndyslexia and lack of having a great\nupbringing slash education and resources\nthat i think they see me and they say\nthat they can do it and i i just hope\nthat the next oprah winfrey of steve\njobs is you know uh you know at home 10\nyears old\nin their pajamas eating some cereal\nwatching me on tv and saying well why\ncan't i do it you know because when i\ngrew up i didn't see anybody who could\ndo it who looked like me um and when i\ndid see them they had something to do\nwith sports or music\nand if you didn't have a talent or you\ncouldn't\nhave you know you weren't an athlete\nthen\nhow can i do it right um but when you\nsee me and unfortunately you know i'm\none of the few people of color on tv\nbusiness orientated that's globally\nrecognized that created a brand\nunfortunately um and there's many who\nhave done that many right but when you\nsee me that's that's that's what i think\nis gonna be my legacy yeah\nthat's beautiful and i think that's an\nawesome one it's definitely for me too\nyou know i never grew up seeing anyone\nwho looked like me on tv but now people\nget to see you yeah right and and um you\nknow i don't know much about your your\nyour history i know a little bit about\nit and um\nmy team was uh sharing with me\nbut you know you're gonna change\npeople's lives there's gonna be somebody\nout there who wants to do exactly well\nyou probably are already you're probably\ndoing it from different ways but they're\ngoing to want to emulate you so a lot of\ntimes when the kids come up to me and\nsay i want to be on shark tank and go\nyeah we need somebody to replace kevin i\nwant you to sit i don't want you to be\nthere i want you to be here yeah like\nwell i'm gonna be like you i'm like no\nyou're not gonna be like me because then\nyou're gonna fail i want you to be\nbigger than me yeah yeah that's\nbeautiful yeah i i find that mentors who\ncan say that\nthat's the real deal when you say i'm\nhappy for you to be bigger than me\nthat's that's really beautiful yeah yeah\nthat's beautiful man thank you again for\nthat i really appreciate it you've\ntalked a lot your book just focused on\nrelationships relationship relationship\nbut what i liked about your book is that\nit's simple yet profound like it's easy\nfor anyone to understand yeah but\nit's like you're breaking it down and\none of the ones that i love and you say\nbe slow to judge and quick to forgive\nyeah and i feel like that is so\npowerful and counterintuitive to where\nwe are today we're very fast a job judge\nand we take ages to forgive right or we\nnever get there tell us how you learn\nthat and how you learn to do that in\nbusiness and in life\nwell it goes back to a little bit of\nwhat we were saying earlier that you\nknow who am i to judge you i mean listen\nonly god can judge you right i i when i\nmake a decision on shark tank it's only\nif this investment is good for me it's\nnot if you're gonna be good in life or\nnot right\num\nand you know i've learned that i've made\nthe wrong judgments often you know and i\ni and and then i should have forgave\nthose people\nyou know there was a i don't know if i\nput in this in the book but there was a\none a woman who worked for me one day\nand this is when i first started\nfootball when food was just getting\ngoing and i was like she kept coming to\nthe office at 11 she's supposed to be\nthere at nine\nokay now here's the challenge in the\nfashion business on monday morning if\npeople sold out of your clothes on the\nduring the weekend\nor friday they're calling all the\nvendors on monday morning if you're not\npicking up the phone at nine then that\nperson is not going to pick up fubu\nthey're gonna call uh levi's next and\nnike and whoever else they sold out so\ni'm gonna miss a lot of money\nshe wasn't coming in until 11 o'clock\nand i felt like i took it very personal\nyou are ruining my shot you know what\ni've done for the last 12 years to get\nto this point in my life i'm paying you\ni didn't ask you to come here and apply\nfor a job you're applying for a job\nand then my uh partner who was a mentor\nan older guy said to me ever ask her\nwhat's going on do you know maybe she's\nuh\nmaybe she has a mother who's sick with\ncancer and she knows that she's going to\nlose her job but the only way that she\ncan ever\nhelp her mother in the daytime is just\nhold on as long as possible get to work\nhere and do whatever do you know what's\ngoing on i said i don't and i and then i\nsaid i'll go and ask her what's going on\nnot as bad as that but\nsomething that really\nwasn't great and i could understand\nwe shifted around for her to come in a\nlittle later somebody else who stayed\nlater to come in earlier the woman ended\nup working for me for 20 years one of my\nbest employees and it was because i\ncared about her and i just\nasked her you know powershift is not\nabout only power in you the power shifts\nis about reversing the power and giving\nit to your staff giving it to your\nhusband your wife your whoever the case\nis because they'll value you more and\ngive you more power you know when i'm at\nwork you know i'm batman and everybody\nelse is robin and then i'm robbing and i\nallowed them to be batman too because if\ni hired you to do this\nthen why am i acting like i know more no\nno no you're batman tell me what to do\nright so you know that that's that's how\ni came up with that theory over the\ncourse of time though\nand over the course of time my turnover\nmy staff has been\nmuch much less i almost have zero\nturnover in my staff just because of the\nflexibility and being able to just tell\npeople you care about them\npeople have to i just want to know that\nyou give a yeah you know yeah\nthat's phenomenal damon thank you so\nmuch we end every interview with a final\nfive so it's our rapid fire round so you\nhave to answer all of these questions in\none word or one sentence maximum sure\nyeah okay so here's your first one so\ni'm gonna name a title of your books\neach of them and i want you to give us\none powerful lesson from each of them\nsound good\nokay cool all

to five words\nnice okay the power of broke\nyou don't need money to make money nice\nrising grind\nhow are you using 24 hours a day and\npower shift\nthat's it how do you take back the power\nnot lose the power don't let anybody\ntake power from you yeah i love that\nidea that what you just said about the\npower shift of like the power shift\nsometimes is you to your employees you\nto other people that empowers you more\nthan trying to hoard all that power\nthat's so powerful i love that okay uh\nsecond questions what's a you just asked\nme five questions no i know i know but\nthat was in one i put it all in one i'm\ngonna ask you four more if that's okay\nno it's fine yeah i just didn't know you\ndidn't know how to count\nfair enough fair enough i wanted to get\nmore out of you all
