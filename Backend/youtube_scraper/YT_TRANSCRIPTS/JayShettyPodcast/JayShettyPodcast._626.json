    "video_title": "Dr. Steven Gundry ON: “Healthy” Foods You Shouldn’t Be Eating & the Warning Signs of a Leaky Gut",
    "transcript": "these foods are designed to be addictive\nyou know there was an old their\nstatement that's any white substance is\naddictive white flour is addictive white\nsugar is addictive cocaine is addictive\nheroin is addictive you choose the white\nit's addictive unfortunately sickness is\ngood for business and i'm sad to say\nyou know i turned against that over 20\nyears ago you know i could still be\npatching people's coronary arteries up\nand doing bypasses but i found i could\nactually keep people away from me\nby teaching how to eat\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to purpose the\nnumber one health podcast in the world\nthanks to each and every single one of\nyou who come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow now you know that i like\nto find people that can share with you\nreally great insights about your mind\nabout your body about your diet about\nyour food and today i'm sitting down\nwith none other than dr stephen gundry\ndr gundra it's such a pleasure to have\nyou here thank you so much for joining\nme i've been looking forward to this for\na long time we were sharing earlier that\nwe share a mutual friend in lewis house\nand i've seen you on the show many times\nand i'm really glad that we get to sit\ndown together well i appreciate you\nhaving me on because you know i have the\ndr gundry podcast and maybe by appearing\nhere i can become the number one health\npodcast\nso thank you yeah well we we we go all\nacross health so we do mental health\nphysical health spiritual health uh but\ntoday i'm really really excited to talk\nto you about food our gut diet uh what\nwe take in now we've all heard the\nfamous phrase that you are what you eat\nwe've heard it for years and years and\nyears and years and years and as someone\nwho's been doing this for years and\nyears and years how true is that\nstatement and what is it what comes to\nmind when you hear that statement well i\nalways add the second part of that\nsentence which is probably far more\nimportant than what you just said you\nare what you eat but you are what the\nthing you're eating ate\nand that's actually one of the big\nsurprises in the last 20 years of my\ncareer that so many times it's\nyeah we got to choose what we're going\nto eat but we have to choose what that\nanimal ate or what that plant had been\nfed or fertilized or sprayed with to\nreally\nmake a good outcome and it always shocks\nme\nand how do we get aware of that i feel\nlike one of the biggest challenges in\nthis whole field is you know we have all\nthese labels of organic or not organic\nor whatever it may be i find like as a\nuneducated consumer i'm speaking about\nmyself\nit's so difficult to know what it's been\nspread with what it hasn't been spread\nwith what it's been exposed to\nwhere do you start so i guess organic is\nis a good place to start but as i've you\nknow learned from my patients through\nthe years\nso many of us\nare sensitive to for instance wheat\nthe lectins in wheat that organic wheat\nis just as deadly to you as\nwheat that's been sprayed with\nglyphosate\nroundup\non the other hand most people i think\nstill are unaware\nthat glyphosate roundup is one of the\nbest ways to destroy your gut that\nanyone has ever developed and now\npeople associate\nglyphosate with gmo genetically modified\norganisms but in fact\nglyphosate is now routinely sprayed on\nconventional crops conventional wheat\nconventional oats conventional\nflaxseed conventional\nsoybeans conventional\ncanola oil canola\nand so and it doesn't have to be\ndeclared on any label so\nnot only\nspeaking of you are what you eat\nthese crop foods are fed to our animals\nand those animals\nliterally not only pass on glyphosate\ninto us when we eat them\nbut as i talk about most animals are\nstill given antibiotics to make them\ngrow faster and grow fatter\nand those antibiotics are passed into us\nas well and one of the things that we\ndidn't know when broad spectrum\nantibiotics were introduced\nabout 50 years ago\nis that we didn't know about the gut\nmicrobiome nobody knew about it until\nabout 10 years ago and we had no idea\nthat these broad spectrum antibiotics\nwas literally throwing napalm on our\ntropical rainforest in our gut\nand so most of us inadvertently\nare swallowing antibiotics every day and\nthey're swallowing glyphosate every day\nwithout our knowing and sadly\nlooking at for instance organic oats\na huge number of organic oat products\nhave glyphosate in them you know i had\ndr mark hyman who's a friend of mine i\nlove doctor yeah we've had him on the\nshow yeah on my podcast and\nmark's a pretty careful eater um and\nhe still has significant amounts of\nglyphosate in himself\nand he's going you know what the heck\nyou know how\nwhat am i going to do\nand so if if he and i are really kind of\nsensitive picky eaters imagine what the\naverage consumer is is getting in their\nfood and is there a way of someone\nmeasuring how much glyphosate is in\ntheir body like you were saying\nyeah we can actually measure glyphosate\nyou can measure glyphosate in blood you\ncan measure glyphosate in hair\nwe\nwhen we're looking for mischief in some\nof our patients who\nwho aren't doing better\nwith doing ever by following the rules\nmany times we're\nshocked that glyphosate is right up\nthere on their culprits and when you say\ndeadly let's talk about that because i\nthink for a lot of people\nwe don't really understand like you were\nsaying that from a gut perspective we\nonly started understanding about\nmicrobiome probably around 10 years ago\nat least in western medicine correct uh\nin eastern medicine the gut is at the\nheart of your health uh and and that's\nkind of what i was especially exposed to\nthrough my wife as i was mentioning\nbut when you say that we only found out\n10 years ago i think there's still a\nwhole group of people who are just not\naware of how central their gut is to\ntheir health but also when you say\ndeadly and you say things like wheat\nit's like well wheats and everything\nwhere how do you help people understand\nwhat you mean by deadly and what's\nactually happening happening inside of\nus when we consume these uh products\nyeah so i mean hippocrates the father of\nwestern medicine uh 2500 years ago said\nall disease begins in the gut\nand one of my colleagues from harvard dr\nfazano\nhas paraphrased that he i think stole it\nfrom me but that's okay\nall disease begins in a leaky gut\nand certainly i've been\npreaching and publishing that\nalmost all diseases whether it's heart\ndisease whether it's cancer whether it's\ndementia whether it's arthritis\ncertainly whether it's autoimmune\ndiseases\nbegin in a leaky gut now\npeople are beginning to hear and under\nmaybe understand leaky gut\nif you'd asked me 15 years ago\nif i thought what i thought about leaky\ngut i would have told you it was\npseudoscience\nnow we can measure it we can see it\nhappen\nanyone with an autoimmune disease i can\nassure your listeners has a leaky gut\nand the good news is when we\nseal a leaky gut and it's actually quite\npossible to do the autoimmune disease\ngoes away um goes away and\nstays in remission so\ngetting back to\nwe have a\nwonderful set of bacteria viruses fungi\nin our gut\nover a hundred trillion different\norganisms and all these little\none-celled creatures are\nreally probably the most important organ\nin our body that we\nreally are were totally unaware of\nand there's this incredible\nsymbiotic relationship between\nour gut microbiome our skin microbiome\nour oral microbiome\nand everything that happens to us we now\nknow that they control our immune system\nthey control our mood\nthey control quite frankly whether you\nor i are going to develop heart disease\nthey control whether you or i are going\nto get dementia\nand\na lot of people particularly i think in\nthe west\nsay oh come on now you know we're the\nmost advanced highest organism that's\never happened\nand our brains are the most exquisite\nthings and you're trying to tell me that\na one cell organism is actually\ncontrolling our fate and yes\nthey are what are some of the basic\nthings let's let's make this really\nsimple for everyone listening now what\nare some of the basic do's and don'ts\nof strengthening our guts strengthening\nour digestion making sure we're not\ngiving in to some of these uh basic\nchallenges that we may come across you\nsaid you and dr mark hyman may be on the\nvery safe end\nof i'd love to hear what you guys do eat\non a daily basis uh and you of course\nbecause you're here but\nbut uh i would love to hear what the\nbasics are and then what you do at the\nvery extent because i feel like you're\nsomeone who's obviously so well\nresearched read you've seen it affect\npeople's lives you must be on one end of\nthe spectrum\nhow do people start on that journey\nwell so one of the things i talk about\nin my current book the energy paradox\nwhich i think is very illustrative\nuh some duke researchers who i've had on\nmy podcast um\nwere fascinated with this hunter\ngatherer tribe in tanzania called the\nhanzas\nand the hanzos are incredibly healthy\nthey have no diseases they walk the men\nwalk wait to 10 miles a day hunting the\nwomen walk oh four to five miles\ngathering\nand they're very thin they're very fit\nand they said you know we should look at\ntheir energy expenditure\ncompare them to desk workers in the\nunited states\nand\nour supposition our hypothesis is that\nthese guys\nare lean and fit and everything because\nthey're walking they're always moving\nand their energy expenditure is going to\nbe a whole lot higher than the desk\nworkers and of course that's why the\ndesk workers are also fat and miserable\nturns out when they did the measurements\nthey found out that these hanzas are\nactually expending the exact same amount\nof energy wow as the death workers wow\nnow\nwhen we make a hypothesis in research um\nand we can't prove our hypothesis then\nthat really bothers us and we sometimes\nfudge and say well of course this is\nwhat we expected to find uh because\neverybody has the same amount of energy\nexpenditure or whether you're doing a\nwhole lot or just sitting at a desk\nand to me when i read that article and\nthat's why i wanted them on the program\nthat didn't pass the sniff test\num didn't make sense and i said so\nsure okay they're both expending the\nsame amount of energy but clearly those\ndesk workers aren't walking\neight to ten miles every day\nwhere is their energy expenditure going\nand it turns out from my research and\nmany other people's research it's going\nto\ninflammation and the inflammation is\nactually driven\nby leaky gut now the best way to\ncompare this\nwe have the lining of our intestines is\nthe same surface area as a tennis court\nso when we're watching wimbledon right\nnow\nthat huge surface area is actually\ninside our gut and everybody kind of\nlooks down wait a minute there's no\ntennis court in here well in fact there\nis\nand we have\nfor lack of a better word as a design\nflaw\nthat that tennis court the lining is\nonly one cell thick right\nand those cells are all held together by\nwhat are called tight junctions um when\ni was a kid we played red rover red\nrover where two lines of kids locked\narms and you tried to run across\nmost cultures actually have that game\nand so they're all locked together\nbecause there's only one cell standing\nbetween everything you ate\nand all of these bacteria and you\nand on the other side of this one cell\nwall is 80 of our immune system 80 of\nall of our white cells\nare literally\nwaiting on the other side because quite\nfrankly\nthat's where mischief can come through\nand so\nnormally\nthat wall has some pretty interesting\ndefenses itself against being broken\nthrough\nbut one of the things that dr fasano who\ni mentioned before found was that gluten\nwhich is a plant protein which is called\na lectin which i guess i became famous\nfor\nis able to actually attach if it can get\nto the wall of the gut and attach to a\nreceptor and actually break the tight\njunction\nand now you've got a gap\nand through this gap you can get\nproteins bacteria bacterial particles\nand\nleaky gut and our immune system goes oh\nmy gosh we're under attack\nwe gotta rally the troops the troops\nneed food the troops need supplies\nand\ngive us all the energy you've got\nand so most people don't realize is that\nthe vast majority of us on in the west\nparticularly uh all of our energy is\nbeing devoted to this war that's going\non inside of us\nthat's incredible yeah yeah that's it's\njust it's insane that example with the\nhanzas you said that yeah that's that's\nthat's\nfascinating that all of our energy\nexpenditures all here yeah and so that's\nwhy we feel more drained it's why we\nfeel more stressed it's why we feel more\noverworked and exhausted and fatigued\nand i think what's really fascinating\nabout this is i think that so many of us\ntoday\nfeel that our\na lot of our pain is mental but it's\nactually starting here would you say\nthat's true does that make sense that\nyeah uh you know\nwe've talked about for for a number of\nyears we've talked about you know the\ngut brain connection\nand the the the gut is the second brain\nwell we now have kind of added to that\nthe microbiome gut brain connection and\nwhat's\nfascinating and i talk about in the\nenergy paradox is that these\nbacteria primarily\nmake\ncompounds that actually communicate to\nour brain\nthey are actually a language they're\nthey're literally called a trans kingdom\nlanguage\nwhere bacteria\ntalk to our neurons to our mitochondria\nthe little energy producing cells to our\nimmune system\nand they literally send them text\nmessages um\na few years ago\nusually every year pre-code i i present\na talk at the world congress of\nmicrobiota in paris\nand the organizer uh dr edis\ntook me aside man it must have been six\nyears ago and he said i'm going to tell\nyou something\nthe microbiome you know talks\nto the mitochondria talks to the brain i\nsaid\nokay i believe you but why\nhaven't we discovered the language he\nsays oh don't worry\nit will be discovered i guarantee you it\nhappens and sure enough the language was\ndiscovered and it's it's literally i\nthink as important as breaking the\nenigma code which was the german code in\nworld war ii\num yes yes remember that yeah yeah and\nso\nyeah and so\nbreaking this code it actually won the\nnobel prize for medicine\nso there is truly a language that\nbacteria use\nto\ntell us kind of\nwhat's going on\nthere in a way\nthe real\nguardians of what is coming into us\nand the cool thing about bacteria\neverybody thinks our genes are so\nimportant well we actually have fewer\ngenes than corn\nwe actually do not have the most genes\nof any animal that a sand flea has more\ngenes than we do\nand the neat thing about bacteria is\nthey have their own genome but bacteria\ndivide so rapidly\nthey can actually change their genome\nvery very quickly and so many of us\nthink that we've actually uploaded\nmost of our computing power\nto the bacterial and viral genome inside\nof us\nbecause it's\nit's a much bigger cloud than our genes\nthat's incredible wow that's yeah so we\ni guess we're just getting so much i\nmean it feels like for years we've just\ngot so much wrong we've\nwe've had the wrong information we've\nmade the wrong decisions\nbringing it back to the basics of\nsomeone listening right now and saying\ndr gundry\ni can actually relate to what you're\nsaying like i experience what you're\nsaying if someone's listening to us\nright now and they're just like i feel\nlike i have a leaky gut or i'm on the\nway there or i already know and i'm\nstruggling even further what are some of\nthe things that we need to cut out and\nwhat are the things we need to adopt in\na very simple way because i feel like\nfor most of us we don't have the time to\nread and research and journal and\nand i'm hoping that after this podcast\nmany people are going to go and order\nyour books the energy paradox and the\nplant paradox i think that would be\nfantastic insight and use for all of our\nlisteners today but to simplify it yeah\nwhat would you encourage as a\nstop eating this start eating this and\nwhy\nwell yeah it's interesting you mentioned\nuh some people have a gut feeling and\nit's interesting women in general have a\nmuch better gut feeling than men\nand interestingly enough women by far\nhave far more autoimmune diseases than\nmen\nand fun fact or sad fact women actually\ndevelop far more alzheimer's disease\nthan men\nand even though they're clearly the\nstronger sex\nso women actually are really in tune\nwith their gut far more than men and\nwe have this epidemic of autoimmune\ndiseases hashimoto's thyroiditis for\nexample ibs irritable bowel syndrome\nand these are real things these are not\nimagined\num i just saw a young woman actually\nfrom l.a\nwho's been to every specialist in the\nworld with\noh\ndepression anxiety\nstomach issues and they can't find\nanything wrong with her\nwe finally did a leaky gut panel and\nfood sensitivity panel and it turns out\nthat\nyou know\nto me it was obvious that she had a\nprofoundly leaky gut\nand that so many of the foods that she\nwas being told to eat were actually\ncausing her leaky gut\nand you know she she really she's only\n12 years old and she just started crying\nand she says you mean i'm not crazy you\nmean that this is this isn't in my head\nand because they wanted to put her on\nantidepressants\nof course and i said no i said this is\nyou know look it's real we can measure\nthis so getting back to your question\nthe hanzas for instance have a\nincredibly diverse microbiome they've\ngot you know hundreds of thousands of\nspecies of bacteria in their gut\nand a lot of those bacteria actually\nlike to eat the things that are\ntroublesome to us for instance there are\nbacteria that like to eat gluten believe\nit or not\nand they go oh you know gluten yummy\nthe problem for most of us is\nall of us have been given antibiotics um\nfor\ndumb things um\nand all of us inadvertently have been\neating the antibiotics that our animals\nhave been fed\nand so and glyphosate believe it or not\nwas patented as an antibiotic it was not\npatented as a weed killer wow and\nmonsanto knew this and yet\nso every time we eat these things we\nactually kind of\nkill off the first line of defense that\nhas been established for\neons of time in dealing with\nplant compounds that don't like us\nthat was the premise of the plant\nparadox that plants believe it or not do\nnot want to be eaten they have a life\nthey\nyou know we're here first actually and\nthey don't want their kids eaten their\nbabies their seeds so they protect\nthemselves\nwith compounds that are designed to make\nan animal sick and some of those\ncompounds are these proteins called\nlectins that can cause leaky gut\nso where are these things well these\nthings are in almost all grains they're\nin pseudograins like quinoa or buckwheat\nthey're not in millet and sorghum so\nfolks if you're interested in eating\ngrains and i have nothing against eating\ngrains per se\nmillet and sorghum are perfectly safe\nfoods they don't have any lectins wow\ndo quinoa and buckwheat have less\noh no they actually have some of the\nworst lectins there are wow\nsadly in fact when i first worked on\nthis i really wanted buckwheat not to\nhave yeah same i love buckwheat what\nabout pharaoh pharaoh's same problem\nokay\nany of these fancy names for ancient\nwheat are just it's still wheat sorry\nabout that got it and ancient wheat is\njust as mischievous as modern wheat yes\nbeans and legumes uh\nhave some of the highest lectin contents\nof any food now the good news is that\npressure cooking or fermentation of for\ninstance quinoa or buckwheat or\nany of the beans are perfectly safe for\ninstance all\neverybody says oh you're anti-bean i'm\nnot anti-being i just want to get rid of\ntheir offending compounds because quite\nfrankly they're anti-me\nand i mean there's there's amazing\nresearch looking at the most famous one\nwas was the healthy eating day\nat a\nschool in boston\nand\n23 students and teachers went to the\nhospital with bloody diarrhea\ntraced to undercooked beans that they\nwere fed on their healthy eating day\nand but get a pressure cooker\ni've got a whole book\nthe plant paradox family cookbook on how\nto pressure cook these things\nluckily there's a couple of companies\nnow that pressure cook their beans eden\nbrand e-d-e-m\nand now jovial brand which is an italian\ncompany\neasy to remember jovial jovial happy\nperson oh yeah i want some happy beans\nyes and i have those several times a\nweek there's beans have some great\nbenefits as long as you defuse them\nthe same way with the nightshade family\nand you and i off camera we're talking\nabout nightshades and those are eggplant\ntomatoes peppers potatoes\nand believe it or not goji berries are\npart of that\nfamily that's such a strange one i know\nyeah goji berries were actually\nfrom north america and they were they\nwere called the wolfberry and they were\ntaken to china in trade during early\ntrading days and they thrived in china\nand so yeah they're they're in\nnightshade from america\nand the peels and the seeds of\nnightshades are the troublesome things\nso\nmany cultures for instance the italians\nrefused to eat tomatoes for 200 years\nafter columbus brought them back because\nthey knew how deadly they were\nand really to this day the italians\nalways peel and de-seed their tomatoes\nbefore they eat them\nthe southwest american indians who\nlove chili peppers always peel and\ndeseed their chilies before they either\neat them or grind them into chili powder\nin fact anybody who wants to do this\nexperiment just go to the store buy a\ncan of green chilies chopped green\nchilies open it up then you'll notice\nthey're peeled and de-seeded\nbecause cultures have figured out how to\ndo this\nlike for instance the incas\nloved quinoa\nbut they\nsoaked quinoa they fermented it they let\nit rot\nand then they cooked it and it's not on\nthe package directions\nhey yeah definitely it's like you know\nlet it rot yeah yeah let it rot\nthat's yes that i didn't i had no idea\nabout that about quinoa and buckwheat so\nthat's that's massive news to me and\nwhen but i'm sure you know and and i'm\ntrying to think for everyone who's\nlistening to us and you've heard this a\nmillion times because\nyou're sharing things that are quite\nuh they shouldn't be but they are\nbecause and it's f i find it really\nfunny when someone says well dr condrey\nyou're against beans because i'm just\nlike\ni mean i don't think you have a vendetta\nagainst beans or people who\nown bean production companies or\nwhatever it is so i always find that\nfascinating whenever i hear that because\nall i'm hearing is just being healthy\nrequires a completely rewiring of our\ndiet and that is hard to hear it's\ndifficult to hear\nis\nliving the healthy way expensive or no\nare some of these changes expensive\nchanges or are they are they affordable\nchanges that's a great question i\nactually still\nsee\nmedicaid and medi-cal patients uh\nyou know even though my you know\naccountant said wait would you stop\ndoing that well i believe everybody has\nthe right to good health\nbut we found that so many\ndisadvantaged people poor people they\nactually end up saving money when they\ndo this because\nprofit margin is huge in processed foods\nand about 70 of the food we eat is\nprocessed or ultra processed\nand when you say processed you mean from\npackages yeah from fabric yeah from\npackages and people say well i always\nread the label\nand one of my advice is look if you're\nreading a label uh put it down there's\nno label on a head of lettuce\nand labeling laws uh have been changed\nto actually fool you oh gosh yeah it's\ncrazy we had the former head of the fda\non my podcast\nrecently and he is actually the person\nwho was\nput put the labeling on the back\nand he was actually called into the oval\noffice and i won't tell you who the\npresident was because that's really not\nimportant\nand big agriculture uh was and the head\nof the department of agriculture was in\nthere and they said you can't put\nthis system on a package\nand he said well wait a minute you know\nthat's what's in there and they said you\ncan't do that\nyou cannot tell people how much sugar is\nin our products and he said but you know\nthere it is\nthey said you're going to have to change\nthe label you're going to have to hide\nthe sugar and this is coming from the\nhead of the fda and he said for instance\nlet me give you an example it's a great\nexample he said you look at a label of a\nbagel\nand he says bagel says 300 calories and\nyou look down and it says one gram of\nsugar and you go oh great no sugar in a\nbagel and it doesn't taste sweet he says\nno he says there's actually\n12 teaspoons of sugar in that bagel and\ni go\ni know that and you know that why don't\nwhy doesn't the consumer know that he\nsays we hid it\nit's under total carbohydrates and\nyou take total carbohydrates on a label\nand this is all in all my books\ntake away the dietary fiber which is\nactually what we feed good bacteria with\nand that will tell you the amount of\nsugar in that serving\nthen just for fun there's four\ngrams of sugar there's sorry there's\nfour grams of carbohydrate and a\nteaspoon of sugar so divide that total\ncarbohydrate by four and it'll actually\ntell you the teaspoons of sugar you're\neating\nand when i have bunches of packages in\nmy office and when i show a patient a\nhealthy product\nand\nthey go wait a minute you know there's\nfive teaspoons of sugar in those you\nknow ten little cassava chips i'm eating\ni said yep\nwhoa\nyeah\nyeah how is how's the fda getting away\nwith that like how is that\nokay because that's that's\ngood for business yeah but that's but\nit's it's so it's so hard to believe\nthat people are doing that to their own\nfamily their own kids their own\nyou know parents grandparents like it's\neveryone's consuming it right it's just\nscary to believe that\nit would be different if they were\nreally healthy and their family was\nreally healthy and then they would just\nbut remember we're in we are you know a\nprofit driven society and these\ncompanies are beholden to shareholders\nand\nwhether they like it or not the bottom\nline is they have to produce a profit\nand as as you know and mark hyman and i\nknow\nthese foods are designed to be addictive\nyou know there was an old their\nstatement\nany white substance is addictive and\nwe you know\nwhite flour is addictive white sugar is\naddictive cocaine is addictive heroin is\naddictive you choose the white it's\naddictive and they've made a science out\nof addiction\nand\nagain\nunfortunately sickness is good for\nbusiness yeah and i'm sad to say\nyou know i turned against that over 20\nyears ago\nyou know i could still be patching\npeople's coronary arteries up\nand doing bypasses\nbut i found i could actually keep people\naway from me\ndumb\nby teaching them how to eat yeah\nyeah and i want to talk to you about\nthat it feels like\nthere's two tr and you can actually\nguide us better on this but it feels\nlike there's two transitions there's and\ni know this from changing my own diet\nhaving met my wife and her having a big\nimpact on me but\nwhen you look at diet there's the change\nof habit and then there's like a change\nof palate and taste and like addiction\nas you're saying like we we are addicted\nwe're craving these things that are\nterrible for us whether it's fries or\nwhether it's gluten like i know that\ni've my wife's always telling me to\navoid any of the uh mock meat or you\nknow because we're both plant-based so\nmy wife and i both plant based on our\ndiets but she's always trying to avoid\nanything with gluten in it that's\nprocessed vegan meat or whatever it may\nbe because she's dead against gluten and\nso\nwhen when you when you do this it's\nalmost like\nwhat is the process you've seen people\ngo through in trying to change their\nhabit trying to change their palette how\ndifficult it has been what has helped\npeople the most how have people actually\nbroken through that one month of being\nexcited and i know you created a 30-day\nchallenge\nhow have people gone from 30 days to\nmake that the next three decades of\ntheir life rather than 30 days and back\nto where they were well that's a good\nsegue into stuff we were talking about\nearlier\nthere's essentially simplistically two\ntwo types of gut bacteria\nand i call the good guys your gut\nbuddies\nand then i call the\nbad guys the gang members\nand they they coexist and\nthe gang members again these guys send\nsignals to our brain\nthe gang members love\nsimple sugars and saturated fats\nand they actually\ntell your brain to go get these things\nand one of the things that they're\nunique about is they're really good at\nmaking you fat when you eat these things\nthey actually extract more calories and\npass it on to you\non the other hand the gut buddies\nhate simple sugars hate saturated fats\nthey like complex carbohydrates\nfibers and\nthey actually take most of that and keep\nit from themselves make more little\nbacteria\nand they tell you hey this is the stuff\nthat we want to eat and so i can take a\nmeat and potatoes guy\nand who sips\nsalads you know vegetables you know i\nhate that stuff\nand kind of make him eat this stuff for\na couple of weeks and he'll come back\nand he'll go\nthis is bizarre i've been taken over by\na foreign lifeform he says\ni kill now to get a salad if i don't get\na salad you know i'm i'm ready to push\nsomebody out of the way to get it he\nsays this isn't me and i said well\nactually it is the new you you have been\nyou know taken over by the gut buddies\nand they're now directing your tastes\nlet me give you one more exciting\nexample\nthere was a recent chinese study looking\nat fasting\nand there's a\nnew theory called the gut-centric theory\nof hunger that i talk about in the\nenergy paradox\nthat theory is that\nthese bacteria actually guide our food\nchoices and our hunger whether we want\nto eat or not not our brain not our\nwillpower\nso they took a bunch of volunteers and\nthey put them on either a seven or 14\nday water fast\npart of the group were given a hundred\ncalories of prebiotic fiber\nthat means we can't digest it but the\ngut bacteria can't eat it\nand just 100 calories the guys who got\nthe 100 calories of prebiotic fiber even\ngoing on a 14-day water fast had\nabsolutely no hunger\nthe folks who didn't get it were hungry\nand you go well what's the deal well it\nturns out the guys that got the\nprebiotic fiber their gut buddies said\nthanks a lot we're fed got what we need\nyou don't have to go looking for food\nin a way that's really incredibly\nexciting and actually empowering wow\nbecause if we if we give them what they\nwant\nuh they'll take care of us\nuh i i got to know jacqueline\nin his later years jack lane was the\ngodfather of fitness as far as i'm\nconcerned\nand jack the lane had an expression\nhe says if it tastes good spit it out\nnow all of my\nstaff say will you stop saying that\nbecause now you're going to make people\nthink you want to eat non-tasty things\nwell he wasn't really saying that what\nhe was saying he didn't know back then\nis if you eat for them yeah then you'll\nyou'll take care of uh you know they'll\ntake care of you and yeah i think he was\nabsolutely right yeah and and it is that\ntransition and it it is it is crazy\nthough that most of the stuff that's\ngood for us\nis just our palettes just not trained to\nlike it correct right like that's just\nthe way it is and i've found that\nas i've had my wife in my ear over the\nyears it's and she's like almost coached\nme and guided me through this from a\nphysical health point of view\ni've seen my palette start to change\nand and it's changed around stuff that i\nwas addicted to like i was addicted to\nchocolate or sugar because that's what i\ngrew up having and so for me now when\ni'm generally not eating any um you know\nraw sugars or whatever i'm eating\nnatural sugars and\nuh trying to remove it completely but i\ncan notice that my palate slowly started\nto change it's taken a lot of time and\neffort\nwhat are some of the\ntell us about some of these products and\nsupplements that you've created to help\nthis transition and i'm asking because\nyou know i'm i'm already like straight\nafter this i'm gonna be coming to your\nclinic to to get checked out and get\nyour help because i'm already you know\nfully\nuh what's the right word\ni'm fully immersed in what you're saying\ntoday like i'm thinking through\neverything you're saying and i'm just so\nhappy that you're doing this uh it\nbrings me so much joy that someone's\nactually speaking about these things in\na scientific\nclear and researched way because i think\nit's so needed today uh what tell me\nwhat you eat first of all on a daily\nbasis i think it'd be good for people to\nhear uh what dr mark hyman eats if you\nfeel like sharing that with us and what\nwas your journey to get there personally\nyeah um because you didn't know this\nwhen you were born you haven't been\nliving like this for no but yeah you\nmake a good point and i use this example\nfor my patients uh you know a little\nchild in japan\num\ndoesn't come out of the womb wanting to\neat seaweed totally uh\nand yet uh you know almost from day one\nthey are exposed to seaweed and think\nit's the best thing you know they ever\nhad yeah and so\nalmost all of our preferences are are\nculturally driven\nand there's nothing wrong with culture\nthere you know there's\nlet's embrace culture but\nfor instance breakfast breakfast is\nactually a very modern invention if you\nfollow hunter-gatherers there is no such\nthing as breakfast because there's no\nstorage system you know nobody's got a\nrefrigerator there's not even a cupboard\nand so\nthey have to find breakfast and\nbreakfast means break fast\nand most of them don't eat until 11\no'clock and in the morning\ninteresting i just got back from france\nthe french actually have no word for\nbreakfast dejanee was the first meal\nwhen all the tourists arrived they made\nup a word petite de janae you know\nlittle first meal yeah\nand that's breakfast but\nbreakfast was an industrial revolution\nproduct um\n[Music]\nmen\nwould have to go to factories very early\nin the morning there were no breaks\nthere were no lunch breaks and they'd\nget home late at night and so\ntheir wives would make them a breakfast\nbefore they went to work because they\nwere going to fast they were basically\ngoing to do ramadan every day of their\nlives you know a pre-dawn meal and then\na post\nsunset meal which i write about in in\nthe book ramadan fasting is really\nuseful but that's beside the point\nso\nthe kellogg's cornflakes company which\nwas founded in 1906\nuh actually 1906. wow yeah\nmade breakfast cereal the most important\nmeal and\ninterestingly enough\nthey and the united fruit company or the\nchiquita banana paid physicians in the\nearly 1900s to tell people that\nbreakfast was the most important meal of\nthe day wow yeah\nand so you know it's again\num i lived in england\ntraining in children's heart surgery and\nthe brits were never exposed to cereal\nuntil 1942 when when the allies when the\namericans came over wow and i have a lot\nof patients from for instance the middle\neast\nthey were never exposed to cereal until\n1960. and you can just watch our\ncultural spread yeah\ntake over\nand marketing great yeah just great\nmarketing it's addictive food too\nabsolutely it's really simple\ncarbohydrates all right so no no this is\ngood this is great i love here i love\nhow you're able to\nyour research and obviously your your\ndepth of knowledge of interweaving like\nhistory with food with culture with you\nknow what's happening economically i\ni just think that that's what i'm\nfinding so fascinating about this i\ndon't think i've ever sat down with\nsomeone who's broken it down in this way\nfor me and and actually when you start\nseeing that it's easy for anyone\nlistening to connect the dots and go oh\nyeah that is right i only like that\nbecause of i was born in this area or\nthis is what we did or this what my\nfamily did and now i realize that that\ndoesn't mean it's healthy or good for me\nbut yes tell us about your diet and then\ni'm going to get you to analyze mine\nright so i want to share with you what i\neat for breakfast lunch at dinner and\nthen i'll get you to break down what i\nneed to change and i'd love that so i'll\nbe honest with you so for the last 21\nyears now from january through june\nuh i don't eat breakfast i don't eat\nlunch\nduring the week and i eat\nat all and i eat all my calories in a\ntwo-hour window from five to seven at\nnight\nso 22 out of 24 hours i'm fasting you\ndon't eat at all at all not even like uh\na snack or a bar or nothing\nwow i have about and you have a busy\nlife just to clarify you don't sit\naround on a beach all day no so i you're\nlike today you were like oh i've got\nanother meeting to go to like well i\nhaven't so you see patients i see\npatients six days a week i see patients\nmonday through thursday friday i'm at\ngundry md here in la\nsaturday and sunday i have patients in\nsanta barbara at my other office so\ntomorrow saturday i will have a full\npatient schedule sunday i will have a\nfull patient schedule so six days a week\ni'm seeing patients one day a week i'm\nat gundry md so and and i don't eat\nduring those times how how long have you\nbeen doing that 21 years\nwow 51 years and so then i was actually\nas far as i know the first person to\nwrite about intermittent fasting in my\nfirst book dr gundry's diet evolution\nyeah and it's actually a hilarious story\nbut\ntell us so i had an entire chapter on\ntime restricted eating or intermittent\nfasting whatever i want to call it\ncompressing the eating window from when\nyou start eating in the morning until\nwhen you finish at night\nand there's\nmore and more and more and more evidence\nthat if we can reduce that eating window\nto six to eight hours a day yeah mine's\neight right now yeah six to eight hours\na day it's going to have profound\nshort-term and long-term effects on our\nhealth\nand we can actually measure that with\nsome\ncool tests called insulin-like growth\nfactor and do that experiment on a\nperson and watch their insulin like\ngrowth factor plummet so anyhow\nso i wrote an entire chapter in my first\nbook and my editor heather jackson\nsaid look this book is so crazy anyhow\nthis is nuts\nand she said i'm going to cut this\nchapter i said no no no you can't do\nthat this is really important you know\ni've been doing this for five years\nalready and you know here's the data\nhere's the research it's you know it's\nproven in animals blah blah blah the\nramadan diet is a version of that\nwe know human studies you can't do it\nand she said uh\nshe said i'll give you two pages to make\nyour case wow\nokay\nso\nshe came up to me i was lecturing at the\nmind body green symposium two years ago\npre-covered\nand she was in the audience and she came\nup to me she said first of all you know\ncongratulations on everything and she\nsaid secondly\ni have to apologize\nyou were right about intermittent\nfasting you were so far ahead of your\ntime\ni apologize will you ever forgive me um\nand i said\nit's okay\nno i'll never forgive you\nthat's great yeah so it's very powerful\nand\nliterally the second half of the energy\nparadox is to how to get people to\nimplement this\nthe problem with intermittent fasting\n80\nof americans westerners\nare pre-diabetic\ninsulin resistant whether they know it\nor not and their doctors don't know how\nto diagnose it quite frankly\nand when people embark on trying to\nextend the period of time where they're\nnot eating\nthey literally fall flat on their face\nyeah they\nthey get headaches they get weak they\nthey get energy less energy is gone\nand that's because we can't convert from\nburning glucose sugar as a fuel to\nburning fatty acids as a fuel\nand that's what's called metabolic\nflexibility and\nif you want to live a long time if you\nwant to have a brain that works late\ninto life you have to have metabolic\nflexibility you have to be able to\nchange almost like a hybrid car change\nfrom a gasoline engine to a battery\nand that's basically the analogy and\nmost of us\nare stuck using sugar as a fuel and can\nwe build that exactly so but you gotta\nyou can't just jump off the cliff yes of\ncourse yeah no one needs to do that\novernight yeah and so what i do in the\nbook is say okay let's suppose you eat\nbreakfast break fast at seven o'clock in\nthe morning\ntomorrow i want you to eat break fast at\neight o'clock in the morning come on\ngive me an hour\nand we're gonna do that for a week okay\nnext week\nwe're gonna do it at nine o'clock in the\nmorning and we're gonna practice that\nfor a week it's like going to the gym\ntell you uh you know you're not gonna\npick up a 50-pound dumbbell and yeah do\nbicep curls uh definitely\nnot\ncan you oh yes but we got to train you\nso we have to train your mitochondria\nyou're trying to squash that eating time\nyeah and so over a six week period we\ncan get most people to\nhaving their break fast at noon\nand then if i can get people to quit\neating at around seven o'clock at night\nthere's tremendous evidence that if we\nget a three hour window before we go to\nbed\nwe'll actually\nhave a period when we go to sleep called\nbrainwashing which i write about and\ndale bredesen writes about we literally\nclean the toxins out of our brain like a\nwashing machine but if we eat too close\nto bed yes all the blood flow that would\nnormally do that is down in our gut\ndigesting and so but that's how we\nthat's what we do if we do this in a\nstepwise progression yes it's also the\nsame as weaning off sweet taste yes yes\nyou know there are actually a number of\ngood\nnatural no calorie sweeteners out there\ni eat monk fruit monk food's really\nquite good that's what i do my new\nfavorite is allulose because\nis actually a prebiotic and it's a\nnatural sugar and what do they put it in\nfor you to eat it it's a it's a white\npowder\nunfortunately yeah uh but yeah it's\nreadily available now in a lot of stores\nif not you can find it online right and\nuh it's a it's a really unique uh\nsweetener right but one of the things\nyou want to do is retreat from sweet and\nso\nif you're used to putting oh a teaspoon\nof monk fruit in your coffee or whatever\nin your yogurt then\nput it down to a half a teaspoon it\nwon't be as sweet as you like but in a\nweek or so you'll say you know this is\nreally quite sweet yeah well then put a\nquarter of a teaspoon in um that's it's\nan easy way\ndon't jump off cliffs\nbecause\nmost people just fall flat on their face\nthey fail and they say ah this isn't for\nme this doesn't work yes yes exactly and\nthen it's just a power it's a battle of\nwillpower and yeah this should never be\na battle of willpower and what i try to\ndo is try to get folks to enlist\nthe power of their gut bacteria\nand if you you know if you start giving\nyour gut bacteria\nwhat they want to eat uh i mean it's\njust amazing what happens to people so\nit's just amazing yeah it's really\nexciting and that's why i see patients\nsix days a week\nyou know i'm like a kid in a candy store\nand let me just tell you a real quick\nstory please we've got this uh young\nwe've got this young family\nin texas\nuh mother with two child two children uh\nthe boy actually i take care of both\nboys\ni saw this young man when he was eight\nyears old he had such severe\npsoriasis on his hands and feet that his\nhands and feet were bloody\nand he had been a specialist he'd been\non drugs and it was just the saddest\nthing his mother sent me pictures of\nthis she said i carry my eight-year-old\nson around because he can't walk\nhe can't go to school\nwe've been everywhere you know can you\nhelp and i\ni said\nyeah\nso you know we looked and he had\nleaky gut and multiple autoimmune\ndiseases like psoriasis like lupus\nand we\nput him through\nokay what are you sensitive to and\nput them on that program\nand he\ncompletely cleared up over a course of a\nyear\nand then he went to school he started\ngoing to school and they were there was\na birthday party at school\nand he ate a\nbirthday cupcake\nand\nliterally within days he started\nhaving these lesions on his hands and\nfeet yeah and we checked he completely\nsealed his leaky gut on his bloodwork\nwow so he checked his blood work and\nboom everything was kind of back to\nsquare one that's amazing so i just\nthat's incredible i just talked to them\non the phone um this week\nand he's now 12. um he's never a young\npatients oh i see lots of young kids\nyeah um\nand now he's in school he's he's\nthriving he's a smart kid\nhe know and mother you know sends me\npictures his hands are normal his feet\nare normal\nand you know it's like no wonder i get\nup every day you know you get you get\nthis kid who mother was carrying him\naround because he couldn't walk because\nhis feet were bleeding and he couldn't\nhold a pencil\nbecause his hands were bleeding and\nthat's beautiful it's all because he had\na leaky gut yeah that's incredible dr\ngundry you're gonna have to come back\nfor a part two because i could talk to\nyou for another hour uh but we're\nrunning out of time oh no i'm gonna have\nto ask you our final five we end every\nepisode with a final five uh fast five\nround where you
