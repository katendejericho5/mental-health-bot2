    "transcript": "we're not counseling the the boss on\npaying their employees more we're\ncounseling why don't you set up\na sponsor happy hour or\ntake a co-worker to lunch or really\ncreate this environment where it's\neasy to meet that person across the\nhallway\nand it's not always just a commercial\nrelationship or a business\nconversation it transcends into the real\nlife\nand a bigger picture hey everyone\nwelcome back to on purpose thank you so\nmuch for coming back to the podcast i'm\nso excited because this week i'm with\nthe arthur m blank foundation\nwe're in west creek we're in this\nbeautiful beautiful ranch\nit's in montana it's absolutely stunning\ni wish you could see this view we'll\nprobably edit in\nsome b-roll so you can actually see the\nbeautiful grounds that we're in\nand we're here for a summit and a series\nand looking into\nhealth and well-being in america and as\npart of this\ni found out that a group of people that\ni deeply look up to\nare here and out of that i have the\nhonor of sitting down with two of them\ntoday and their work has been huge i've\nactually made videos on this work\ni've mentioned it in several of my\ncoaching sessions i've credited it\nspecific amount of times in so many\ndifferent talks that i've given so to\nactually sit down with both of them\nis truly truly meaningful to me so let\nme give you a quick overview dan\nbuettner is an explorer national\ngeographic fellow\naward-winning journalist and producer\nand a new york times best-selling author\nand ben lidl is a transformative\nbusiness business leader\nwho envisions and creates world-class\ncompanies\ntogether they co-founded a company\ncalled blue zones that helps people live\nlonger\nbetter lives by improving their\nenvironment\nand the reason why this is so so\nmeaningful to me because of both of you\nis because i actually got to visit a\nblue zone last year in sardinia\nand that's where i started to really\nuncover more about them but first of all\nso grateful to have you here thank you\nfor being on the podcast\ndelighted and you're the first duo we've\never had on\ndining yeah the pressures aren't ben\ni think it's real i think it's great i\nthink it's great i want to start off and\nyou both can choose who takes which\nquestion i'm just going to ask you both\nquestions you can decide\nwho's the deeper expert on either one\nbecause both of you are\nexperts in your own right so i'd love to\nstart off by just explaining to my\naudience\nin a broader way what are blue zones and\nhow did you first get introduced to them\ni can probably take that one so\nblue zones are populations around the\nworld where people live statistically\nlongest\nand we found five of them this was began\nwith a\nnational geographic project so we really\ndid the homework we spent three years\nwith demographers\nwho really do the homework to make sure\npeople are living as long as they say\nthey are\nand we found the longest lived women in\nokinawa japan the longest lived men in\nthe highlands of sardinia where you\nvisited\nin ikaria greece a population that not\nonly\nlives among the longest they elude\ndementia so the lowest known rates of\nalzheimer's disease in the world\nin the koya peninsula of costa rica we\nfound a population that has the lowest\nrate of middle age mortality\nwhich means 50 year olds have the best\nchance of reaching\na healthy age 92 or 93 without disease\nwhich is what we want\nand then in the united states we found\nthem among the seventh-day adventists in\nloma linda california\nand the project blue zones and the\ncompany we run\nuh was based on the idea that or based\non\nactually the research that only about 15\npercent of how long you live\nis you're just explained by genes the\nother 85\nor so is is explained by lifestyle and\nenvironment\nand we distilled a blueprint from these\nblue zones and now we're putting it to\nwork in\nhow many cities now ben 49 49 americans\ni can't eat people 49 48 in in america\nand we just uh launched our first\nuh outside the u.s project in uh airdrie\ncanada\nin alberta uh that's really our first\never yeah wow i love that and and that's\nthat that you just mentioned there 15\nof our health and well-being and mindset\nis based on\nour genes no no specifically it's how\nlong we live\nhow long we live right and by the way\nthat's in with certain biological limits\nso let's just\nset it up right now your average\nlistener\nis probably given the science right now\nprobably\nwill not live to a hundred uh the\nmaximum average life expectancy\nof people living in the first world\nright now is about 93.\nso if you do everything right 93 pro\nmaybe 95 for women women you know do\nmost things better than men including\nliving longer\nso the value proposition that ben and i\nare really evangelizing and putting to\nwork in city is\ntrying to get those 95 years without\nchronic disease without heart disease\ncancer diabetes\nand dementia that foreshorten their\nlives we're not in\nthe this sort of i guess\nhopeful realm of trying to help you live\nto 120 because the science just isn't\nthere yet\nright right and and tell me about some\nof the things that you found when you\nwere traveling in the different regions\nand what you uncovered about what was\nmaking sure that people were\nliving longer and more importantly what\nyou said free from disease\nbecause i think that's the most\nfascinating part yes so\nuh so we're looking for the common\ndenominators that\nwere the correlates or what we believe\nexplain longevity in all five places\nwe found nine of them but i'll sum it up\nwith just talking about four of them\nnumber one\nand this is disruptive in blue zones\npeople don't exercise at least not in\nthe way\nthat we think of exercise and i always\nsay ben hates when i say this but\nexercise has been an unmitigated public\nhealth failure\nfewer than 18 of people in the developed\nworld\nexercise enough so it isn't working for\nthe vast majority\nin blue zones however people are getting\nplenty of physical activity into their\n90s\ninto 100s because they live in\nenvironments that\nnudge them mindlessly into moving every\n20 minutes or so\nso every time they go to work every time\nthey go to a friend's house every time\nthey go out to eat it occasion's a walk\nuh they don't have a button to push for\nthe housework and kitchen work they're\ndoing it by hand\nthey have gardens out back so they're in\nconstant\nmindless movement which is what what i\nbelieve we need to start thinking about\nif we're going to make healthier cities\nnumber two they're eating mostly a\nplant-based diet 90 to 98\nof what they put in their mouth is low\nprocessed plant-based foods the four\npillars of every longevity diet in the\nworld\nare what i'm going to tell you now took\nme eight years to figure out\nuh so the four things are whole grains\nof every kind\ngreens nuts if you're eating a handful\nof nuts a day it's probably adding two\nyears to your life expectancy\nand beans beans about a cup of cooked\nbeans a day\nare the pillar of every longevity diet\nin the world and if you're eating a cup\nof beans a day\nit's probably adding about four years to\nyour life expectancy\nwow very much i do i did yeah\nyeah by the way i saw jay eat beans\ntoday so so\nlet's get started i have a full plum yes\ni\nlicked a little blue star and put it on\nhis forehead most people aren't old\nenough to remember those old strategies\nlet's dive into these a bit let's dive\nin before you tell me i think it's so\nfascinating yeah\ni think we should dive into them let's\ntalk about the exercise one\nso you're actually telling us that this\nwhole culture of\ngoing to the gym weight training hit\nworkouts\nhigh intensity you know all of that\nworld you're actually saying that that\ndoesn't necessarily lead to optimal\nhealth but we're seeing it more in these\nregions\nthrough natural activities of the day\nthat's right\nso so exercise by the way is a great\nidea and\nfor the you know the 20 or so people who\nactually\nget it uh it's great but it's just\nyou know in our countries we see obesity\non the rise in most countries\num their school kids aren't moving\nenough\nit's just not been a successful uh\nstrategy to deal with the healthcare\nproblems\nit sells a lot of books it sells uh gym\nmemberships and\ngadgets and tv shows and\nand uh yoga classes great\nit's a great uh business but it's not\ndoing the job and nobody i\ni feel like the emperor's new clothes by\npointing out\nit ain't working and and uh it's a good\nidea but\none of our first moments on stage\ndan dan makes that announcement and he's\nexplaining exactly what he's saying my\nmaster's degree is in exercise\nphysiology\nokay and people that know me know that\nthat uh\ni'm a big fan of exercise but i think\nwhat what struck me about\ndan's discoveries in the blue zones was\nhe he calls it they were nudged\nconstantly but this idea that\num here in this country people go\nexercise\nthey might kill it for an hour maybe two\nand then the rest of the day almost\nnothing\num in the blue zones people were\nmoving about every 20 minutes and there\nis no\nexercise prescription for that and so\nthe point that dan is making\neven the hardest core scientists which\nyou have some of the world leaders\ngathered with us out here this week\nit's just a different mind shift and how\nto think about\nand i think about it less as exercise\nand more as answering the question how\nphysically active were you today\nrather than the intensity of any one\nperiod of time but a consistent pattern\nof movement through the day\namazing and the second one was the\nplant-based diet let me just add on that\nexercise\nso ken cooper's here i don't know if\nyou're gonna interview him but but\nbut he's uh he's a legend in\nexercise and just to just to point out\nthe power of walking\num people think they have to go pump\niron or run triathlons or do\nyou know break a sweat but actually\nwalking gives you about 90 of the\nphysical activity value of training for\na marathon\nand ken told me and he's on top of all\nthis data that\nif you're 80 years old and you can walk\na mile\nin under 17 minutes it adds about six\nyears to your life expectancy\novernight so just the act of walking\nnow i could ask you jay or or any of\nyour\nof your audience to you know get out\nthere and uh\nget your exercise but if i can just\ncreate your\nyour city so it's easy to get to your\ncoffee shop your kid's school\nto work you're going to get that that\nwalking\nthat's going to get you 90 of the\nphysical activity you need absolutely\nabsolutely and then ben that's\nthe project where you're really building\nyes that's what you're creating when you\ntalk about\nthose 49 locations we bring in you're\nactually trying to\nconstruct cities in ways we walk more\nthat's exactly right so explain how you\ndo that specifically\nwe have experts who have spent their\nentire careers\num looking at how movement happens\nin our environments um and particularly\nin cities\nand understanding transportation how uh\ncities have been engineered and\nconstructed and most\nin america the communities have been\nbuilt for the automobile\nand these experts go in with an eye and\nan understanding and bring\na whole menu of evidence-based\napproaches\nthat can tilt the built environment back\nin favor\nof walkability and bike ability and so\nthose experts go in do very deep\nassessments think through\ndesign constructs hold charrettes or\nsummits\nwith the leaders who are committed to\ncreating the change and present them\nwith an evidence-based\nlist of menu items with understanding\nnot all have equal impact\nbut collectively looking for\ncity leadership business leadership\ncivic leadership\nto stack hands around enough changes so\nit creates a tipping point\nin in what we're talking about sometimes\nthat's just\ncreating sidewalk and trails and\nsometimes it's a matter of connecting\nneighborhoods or from neighborhoods to\ndowntown areas and if you if you look at\nhow america has evolved over the last 30\n40 50 years\nuh it's all been toward the attention of\nfavoring um\nautomobiles uh and instead of\nhuman uh transportation uh the natural\nway\nyeah that's absolutely incredible i'm i\ni actually feel when i used to live in\nnew york\ni used to walk a lot more yeah and the\nreason that's all you do yeah that's\ni lived in manhattan and that's all i\ndid and the reason i did it was also\nbecause of the way\nthe streets were numbered so i think\nbecause of the grid system\nit made me want to walk more because i\nknew that i was on first avenue and i\nwas trying to get to\nsixth at sixth avenue and i knew i was\non first street and i was trying to get\nto\n20th street or whatever it was and just\nbecause of that simple calculation\ni used to walk 45 minutes to get\nsomewhere instead of jumping in a car\nfor eight minutes because it just felt\neasier by the way that wasn't a\ncoincidence that you were walking\nbloomberg when he was the mayor of new\nyork's he made a very\num uh hard push for walkability and\nhe hired a person who kind of a\nan ambassador walkability bike ability\nso now\nnew york sidewalks are cleaned up\nthey're safe if\nthere's little subtleties the way\nsidewalks are designed how wide they are\nare they dangerous are you stepping off\na big curb or is there a nice ramp\nuh the bike share program they've eased\ntraffic there\nand and unleash this army of bikes that\njust about anybody can take\nthat's how you get a population and not\ncoincidentally\nthe obesity rate of new york city is\nabout a third of what it is in middle\namerica\nso you can actually raise the physical\nactivity level of an entire city\nby 30 percent by just optimizing\nstreets for walkability and bikeability\ncleaning up parks and making sure people\ncan take public transportation\nthat's been in our approach rather than\ntrying to get\nuh eight million new yorkers to get down\nto the gym which you're never gonna do\nwe just make it easy for them to go get\ntheir coffee i'm totally impressed and\nfascinated right now like this is\nawesome i'm so glad that this is\nhappening because\ni couldn't agree with you the more\nnatural we can make it for people\nto get moving the more organizations\nto make it unconscious absolutely to\nmake it unconscious i love that that's\nincredible dan always talks about\npeople's individual will\nand how it can be motivated and but\nuh but that it fatigues yeah um and and\nthat's why you see\nso much recidivism from people who start\nexercise programs diets other things\nthis is just the intervention is\nwhere you spend your time and who you\nspend your time with and what the\ncultures and policies are like yes for\nthat time absolutely and it's so\ninteresting because even in the media\nspace\nand what i'm trying to do is the same\nthat i feel that if you just supply\npeople with junk media\njust like junk food they'll eat it but\nwhen you provide people with healthy\nmedia\nbut that tastes good and looks good like\nhealthy food\nyou can switch off to it you can switch\nup to it immediately when it's there in\nthe same places\nand so i'm seeing that habit changing\npeople as well that people will go\nfor a better alternative if it's\npresented correctly and it's available\nand that's one of the biggest challenges\nis accessibility and availability\nthat's absolutely brilliant that's the\nabsolute right idea make it easy make it\naccessible\nand quite honestly you have to compete\nwith the other alternatives out there\nyeah but we can do it we're doing it\nright now so this is awesome i love this\nthis is fantastic by the way anyone\nwho's listening or watching right now if\nyou're listening right now and you\ncannot see my face\ni just want you to know that i am he's\nlooking good they're happy\ni am very happy right now that this work\nis happening in the world because\nyeah what you're both doing is going to\nchange lives of\nmillions of people in the future so and\nhopefully sooner too tell me about the\nplant-based diet so any added points to\nthat i know we already mentioned we all\nlike beans today\nso you know there there's an army of\nscientific research out there that will\nsupport anything you want to eat\nyou know there's there's research that\nbutter is good for you there's research\nthat these paleo or keto diets you can\neat a steak a day or\nbacon but um here's what i know and i i\nwould argue i know it better than\nanybody else on earth\nthe the longest lived people in the\nworld\nif you look back for the past hundred\nyears my team aggregated 155 dietary\nsurveys\ndone in each of the five blue zones you\ncan't just by the way ask a 100 year old\nwhat they eat ate to live a hundred they\ndon't remember\nif i asked you and i'm going to ask you\nactually jay what did you have\nfor lunch a week ago tuesday oh i i'm no\ni'm not a good person okay i'll tell you\nwhy because you know\ni have a very regulated diet i pretty\nmuch eat the same thing every day\neverybody else has a bad answer for that\ntoast that's like my avocado on toast is\nlike my\ngo-to lunch you'll have 100. yeah i'll\nask everybody\nelse out there what they ate a week ago\ntuesday 98 out of 100 can't tell you so\nyou can't really ask 100 year old\nwhat they ate in the last 100 years so\nwe found dietary surveys done when these\npeople were\n10 and when they were newly married and\nwhen they were 50\nand newly retired and when you aggregate\nin this process called a meta-analysis\nwhat emerges is a very clear pattern\nso mostly plant-based i talked about the\nfour pillars\nthey do eat meat but on average only\nfive times a month\nthey eat fish on it they're not big fish\neaters\nas you would expect even though they're\non islands they live in land away from\nthe sea so they're eating fish only two\nor three times per week\na no cow's dairy in any blue zone which\ni found striking\nthey do have some sheep cheese milk like\nfeta or some pecorino from sheep's milk\nand then when it comes to drink drinking\nthey're drinking about six glasses of\nwater a day\nherbal teas of all kinds even black tea\ncoffee\none of the best beverages you can\nconsume and this\npeople are going to love me for this is\ncoffee\nit is the biggest source of antioxidants\nin the american diet which is probably\nmore commentary on the american diet\nthan the virtues of coffee but\nnevertheless as long as you're not\nputting a bunch of caramel sauce in\nthere and\nand cream uh your cup of coffee is a net\npositive try to drink it before noon\nand then wine so most blue zones they're\ndrinking\none two one place maybe three glasses of\nwine a day\nusually with their meal though and among\nfriends they're not slugging it down in\ntheir\nin their room by themselves so that's\nreally\nif you average these five places over\nthe last hundred years\nthat is the diet that is manifestly\ngetting people to a hundred wow or\nninety-five years\noh going please i was just gonna say\nthere's also the things that you\nobserved\naround their strategies for not\novereating\num oh yeah tell us about that go ahead\nyeah well\ni mean in in in okinawa\nuh there's a term hareachi boo which\nthey said before all their meals which\nbasically\ncentered them around what i think of as\nmindful eating they weren't\nlike many of us americans who just grab\nit on the go and slam it down\nand don't even realize how much uh\nthey're eating\nand um you know they they're they're\nstopping\nand when you when you think about the\ntranslation of their term it's basically\nthey're kind of stopping when they feel\nabout 80 percent full\nand those strategies were key\num you won't see um the big family-style\nbowls of food sitting in front of people\nwhere they're heaping on\nbig huge portion sizes they ate off of\nsmaller plates\nthey plated the food the kitchen took it\nto where they ate\nstored all the rest away so there's a\nwhole set of things that\nhave been learned uh from those cultures\nthat\nyou you're easy to institute in your own\nhome yeah absolutely it's so fascinating\nto me because\nit's so similar to monk life so we were\ntraining that when i lived as a monk for\nthree years\nthe plates that we were eating from were\nsmaller and it was the same reason that\nmy portion size shrunk because of the\nsize of my plate\nyes and then when i was traveling and\nvisited the u.s many times and i started\nto see like\nwhen you went to get like soda and you\njust see like the extra extra large\noption\nand you just think wow because that's\navailable that's\nnow attractive and we never had that\navailability and it was the same that\nyou ate what was on your plate\nand you only took on your plate what you\nwould eat nothing could be wasted\nand so there was no food waste either\nand so you never wanted to ovary and be\nin that position so same that's 17\nyou said 80 but it's 75 for us was eat\ntill you're 75\nfull and that's why breath and air and\nwater were such important components of\nfeeling full and and ready so now i love\nit but it's also\na former collaborator of ours brian\nweinsink showed that if\nyou when you put food on a smaller plate\nyou you\nyou perceive the same amount of food as\nbigger yes sends the visual cue to your\nbrain\nyou're having a big slip big mound of\nfood here\nso people tend to eat 20 to 25 percent\nfewer calories when they're eating off a\n10-inch plate than they are\nyou know the garbage can lid plates that\namericans eat off of these days\namazing so we can trick ourselves into\neating healthier by buying smaller\nplates at home\nyes so head over to creighton barrel or\nwherever else\nhome depot and then yeah go and get that\ni love that\nthis one seems harder to implement into\ncities so i understood about\nreconstructing cities for walking\nlike walking to school and walking to\nwork etc but\nhow do you incorporate the plant-based\ndiet and all these diet options into a\ncity\nwell there's there's work that you can\ndo with policy where people spend their\ntime\nso uh where do you think if you're\ngetting\num a recommended amount of sleep then\nhalf your waking life as a kid is in\nschools\nand half your waking life for a good\npart of your adulthood\nis at work and and there are policies\nand cultures that govern food\nfood accessibility it's just simple\nthings\nin the schools in albert lee where dan\ndid\ndid the first translation work was to\nknow food allowed in the classroom in\nthe hallways\nmade a huge impact uh in terms of\naffecting\nuh bmi of the students and i think the\nother\nuh opportunity is when when\nwe when we're out and about in our\ncommunities we do work with\nrestaurants grocery stores um helping to\ncreate\nhealthier choices so that where the\nplaces are that you spend your time\naround food um that that healthy choices\nabound\nand then finally there are uh uh an\nindividual pledge that we ask\npeople uh to do that's a that's a list\njust like we\ndo with the city around um built\nenvironment we we do that\nuh and drive awareness and and ask\npeople to take the pledge in their own\nhome and\nthey may not make all of the changes in\nit but a lot of those changes are\nstacked in favor\nof helping to impact how foods consumed\num and the types of foods that are\nconsumed in their homes amazing\nthat's awesome so so the the organizing\nprinciple behind blue zones\nin none of these places are people uh\non diets or exercise programs or doing\nany of the things that\nthat we do to live longer and the big\naha for me this came after about six\nyears\ni've been studying these blue zones for\n15 years\nis they never tried to live a long time\nthey didn't pursue it the way we pursued\nit it ensued\nfrom the right environment these people\nliving a long time\nin sardinia or okinawa they don't have\nbetter discipline than we have they\ndon't\nhave better individual responsibility\nthey don't better diets or exercise\nprogram they simply live in an\nenvironment where the defaults are\nhappen to be healthy that's the easiest\nand cheapest so how do we translate that\nso when ben and i take on a city we have\nthree teams\npeople places and policy\nso the policy team they're our top\nexperts in the world\nwho know how to work with cities with\npolicy menus\nfor best practices for food favoring\nfruits and vegetables\nover burgers and fries and sodas\nuh built environment has been talked\nabout favoring the pedestrian over the\nthe car and favoring the non-smoke over\nthe smoker one of the things we're\ntalking about at this conference is the\npossibility of adding a\nhappiness policy bundle and we don't we\ndon't\nram it down people's throat we just say\nhere's a menu of policies that have\nworked elsewhere\ncity council mr mayor or mrs mayer\npick eight of them we'll help you get\nthem done if you get them done we'll\ngive you blue zone certification\nsecond team the place team we have blue\nzone certification for schools\nrestaurants grocery stores workplaces\nand churches\nand the idea there is to make those\nenvironments thirty percent healthier by\nnudging people into move\nand presenting healthier food choices\nand more social interaction\nthe third team and this is the team that\ntalks about smaller plates\nis we have a very simple blue zone\npledge for people\nwe give them a check we try to get 15\nthe population\nand we have people to help they take\nchecklists into their homes\nand we ask them to do things like get\nrid of your big plates and change them\nout for small plates\nwe ask them to make sure you have a junk\nfood drawer that's out of the way\nwe make sure to ask them to make sure\nthey have comfortable shoes and bicycles\nso at least\nif you're moved it's easy to do it's a\nnumber of things like that\nwe ask them to join what we call\na moai a connected social network we\nbring people and\norganize them around walking and around\neating plant-based food\nit isn't a program for walking or\nplant-based food it's more a program to\nget\npeople connected and we have a secret\nsauce\nto make sure people make new friends\nloneliness as you know\nis a huge problem in america and then\nfinally and really to the point i think\nof\nof of this podcast is we have a very\neffective\npurpose workshop uh yeah this is the\nthird\nthis is among the third so this is the\npeople so the people yeah people are\nare doing the checklist the the moai\nand then they're doing a purpose\nworkshop and the purpose workshop\nyou'd be shocked how many middle\namericans wake up in the morning\nexhausted tired they get breakfast for\ntheir kids\nthey take a they go off to work on a\nlong commute\n70 percent of americans do not like\ntheir job they come home tired\nthey don't have time they make a crappy\ndinner for their kids they watch as you\npointed out to me today 1.5\nhours of netflix every night and that's\nafter social media and watching network\ntv\nand then they go to sleep and don't get\nenough sleep so um\nthe the taking time to help people\nidentify\nwhat they like what they're good at\nwhat their passions are we take an hour\nto do this and what an\noutlet for that because it ain't going\nto be work most of the time so we got so\nthen to make sure that they have\nan outlet for it we bring we do these\ncurated volunteer\nopportunities so you don't just fling\nthem at some volunteer opportunity\nwe make sure then there's a half a dozen\nvolunteer opportunities in these cities\nand we speed date people with a\nvolunteer so if if you like animals\nyou're walking dogs uh we have the\nhumane society if you look if you have a\npassion for\ncare we might couple you with the better\nwomen's\norganization if you like old people you\ncan\nwe'll help you volunteer with with the\nelderly so\nwe get people activating their purpose\nand you know when peop\npeople who have a sense of purpose are\nliving about eight years longer than\npeople who don't so\nonce you get it started it has a sort of\nself perpetuating\nis that that eight years is the longest\nyou've mentioned there is that the\nhis purpose correlates with the so\nthat's nice so yeah this\ncomes the very first director of the\nnational institutes of\nof of uh aging in the united states this\nguy named robert butler\nand he's the one who looked\nretrospectively at writing\nand he found that people who were could\narticulate their sense of purpose\nwere living about eight years longer\nthan people were rudderless in life so\nthat's the best study i know it's the\nlongest term biggest\ncohort or big study i've known\nbut not coincidentally in blue zones\nthey actually have vocabulary for\npurpose you go to nikoi\ncosta rica it's plan de vita and you\nwhen you ask people that they know it\noff the tip of their tongue\nin okinawa it's ikigai we were\nidentifying ikigai\n15 years ago as the key\nby the way in okinawa there's not even a\nword for retirement\nthere's none of this sort of language\nfor the artificial punctuation between\nyour useful life\nand your life of repose your whole life\nis imbued with icky guy\nthe reason for which i wake up in the\nworld it's way more important\nthan people think because i believe\nyou can't package it and marketers can't\nsell it isn't can't make a lot of money\noff of purpose like you can a diet or a\nsupplement or\nexercise program but purpose is really\nthe great under celebrated\nuh let me put it this way if it were a\ndrug it would be a blockbuster drug um\nabsolutely that's why the podcast is\ncalled on purpose yes you should be\npackaging it you know into his\npackaging he's prescribing i totally\nagree with that but the sanskrit\nword is dharma for purpose i didn't know\nthat and it's the same thing and so\ndharma sometimes can be made into duty\nthat we live with but it's also eternal\nduty that which we\nare internally eternally connected to\nthat reason for being as\nikigai says yeah if i could just make it\nthat's a great point if\nyou said this be a conversation so i\njust learned yeah it is a conversation\nbut one of the things we we've learned\nyou know one of our biggest blue zones\nproject\nis with hmsa in hawaii and um\nyou know you we every place is different\nand and and they're in there all the\nsame but but you know hawaiians have\nvery strong cultures and\nyou know we introduced moai and we i\nmean ikigai we introduced\nyou know pandevita and they kind of got\nit but actually they have a word for it\nwhich is\nohana and ohana means\nnot just following your own little\npassions or your own hobbies or whatever\nthere's also a component of\nresponsibility\nand you also see that in the blue zones\nit's when you get older\nyour purpose always has an element of\ngiving back\nyes it's making sure kids grow up well\nit's making sure that they're\nhelping the mayor make right decisions\nbecause they've been around for 90 years\nand they've seen it all\nit's making sure that other people in\ntheir family get through\nperiods of difficulty because they have\nthe resiliency of having survived all\nthese decades\nabsolutely and so those are the those\nare three that we've been through we've\nbeen through\nthe natural exercise or the you know the\norganic forms of exercise that come in\nthe day to day then we had the\nplant-based diet\nwith the four pillars and then we've had\npurpose what else was the\nkey trends that you found so\nwe now know that if your three best\nfriends are\nobese and unhealthy there's a hundred\nand fifty percent\nbetter chance you're going to be\noverweight so health behaviors are as\ncontagious as catching a cold\nalcoholism is contagious smoking is\ncontagious\ndrug use is contagious even loneliness\nis contagious\nif you go out to eat with somebody who's\nlonely you you can actually feel\nlonelier\nthan you would be if you just ate alone\nso\nso um not a laughing matter actually at\nall so but\nyeah but it sounds funny but it's sad\nthe um\nmy grandmother used to say to me show me\nyour friends and i'll tell you your\nfuture\nand you see very clearly in blue zones\nwith these moais\nlike in okinawa a curated group of\nfriends who you surround yourself with\nthey drive your long-term behavior more\nthan anything\nso the people in blue zones people\nthey're hanging out with\ntheir idea of recreation is gardening or\nit's it's taking a daily walk\nuh they're they tend to eat well so\nwhen they go over to each other's house\nthey're not confronted with baby back\nribs or a burger\nyou know they're all in okinawa they're\neating this they\ncook this wonderful stir-fry and there's\nnot an influence\nuh the adventists you know they're\nreally big on\nprayer spiritual support when you're\ndown\ntaking care of you so uh the big\nprescriptive here the takeaway and\nprobably\nthe biggest thing you can do today\nto add years to your life is think about\nwho the\nclosest people are to you i wouldn't\nnecessarily tell you to dump your old\nfriends\nyou know if they're toxic and you know\nsmoke too much and sit around and drink\nmountain dew and watch reruns of\nbreaking bad\nuh but i will tell you that if you\nproactively bring some people into your\nsocial network whose idea of recreation\nis physical activity or\nyeah and by the way it wouldn't hurt to\nhave a few couple vegetarians and vegans\ninto your immediate social network\nbecause they'll do more to influence\nyour behavior than\nany diet will over the long term yeah\nben did you want to add anything to that\nno no okay that was it yeah i'm\nintrigued by\ni think people aren't used to seeing\npeople come together\nbecause we're like okay well what do\nthey talk about right like when you\nthink about people coming together we\nthink about people\ntalking and sharing and discussing like\nwe're all doing this week\nand i think a lot of people find that\ntheir own circles we end up doing\nthings like complaining comparing\ncriticizing gossip right respect\notherwise known as bitching\nright yeah yeah exactly and so we spend\na lot of time in our circles\noften in that space i'm not saying\nalways and i'm not saying all the time\nbut\nthat can take up a significant i've had\none-on-one conversations with so many\npeople\ndifferent age groups different\nbackgrounds who've said to me yeah when\ni get together with my girlfriends or\nwhen i get together with my friends\nthis is what we end up talking about how\ndid you find that their conversation\nwas it more elevated or no was it\nactually at that level and\nthat worked out for just fine yeah i i\ndo think there is room for us to vent\nbut that there's a difference between\nbeing able to vent with your friends\nevery once in a while and those who are\nchronically complaining and the chronic\ncomplainers\nthat's why i say don't necessarily dump\nyour old friends because they might need\nyou\nbut i will say that's going to be\ncontagious the approach we take in our\ncities\nwe learn this very powerful idea in\nokinawa\nknown as the moai committed social\nnetwork these four or five people\nyou surround yourself with and you\nreally commit to them and thick and thin\nso here's the secret though those people\nthey they might be lonely or they might\nhave who they think are talked at\nfriends\nwe take them through this process so\nthat they can identify\npeople we like to hang out with people\nlike us\ni hate saying you know this beautiful\nidea of a diverse world but\nyou know most people end up picking\npeople who kind of look like them with\nsheer political bully share religion etc\nwho share interests\nyou know it's very hard to you know have\nthe golfer hang out with the tennis\nplayer and\nwhat are we going to do together you\nknow i like a club why not racket\nso so we don't try to we don't try to\nbeat that barrier down\nand then people's schedules have to line\nup so in our cities we bring\nhuge numbers of people together and we\ntake them through an hour-long process\nso they find people like them and we\njust challenge them to walk\nor to eat plant-based foods for 10 weeks\nand that's\nlong enough for people to really make\nfriendships\nafter about six weeks there's a tipping\npoint like if you and i hang out\nyou and i have seen each other twice now\nand you know i like you and i call you a\nreally good acquaintance but i'll bet\none more time of having i'll bet if we\nstill like us\nwe're probably friends so um it's the\nit's it's a there's actually terminology\nfor it's called homophily\nwe kind of like people who are like us\nif we hang out with them\nlong enough perpinquity yeah they tend\nto become our friends\nabsolutely i think of his best friends\ntoo they've done a lot of work\nlooking at the measurement of well-being\nwith the projects that we do and\nthere's an interesting question that\nthat asks whether you have a best friend\nat work or not\nand for those that do um their\nwell-being is\nso much higher yes uh than those who\njust simply\ndon't have that and and it's maybe not\nso much\nwhich one the one about two million\npeople being interviewed and what the\nmost important\ndriver of whether or not a person likes\ntheir job\nwell it's going to be whether they have\nthe best friend at work and whether or\nnot they\nthey like their boss right what kind of\nrelationship they have so did you hear\nthat yeah\nyou didn't hear pay you didn't hear\nvacation\nyou you didn't hear promotion yeah\ni think it's so huge yeah i remember\nremember as a kid you want\nyou had a best friend somewhere right\nand as we grow up as adults\neverything gets busy um things get\noriented around work family\nkids and and i think we we lose\nthis idea that we have a best friend and\ndan's\nwork at gallup's study knows that um you\nknow do you have on a really bad day\nyou know three people that you know you\ncould call unconditionally\nthey're going to respond to support to\nyou yeah so when we do these blue zone\nprojects and we're creating these moais\nwe're introducing people to new network\nthat are beyond their current network\nand they're built around\nyou know health and common interests and\nand to dan's point 10 weeks plus you\nstart seeing\nbehaviors turn to habits people are\nexpanding\ntheir network of what they would call\nfriends and the more that you can get\nthe greater chance you have when you hit\ntrouble on bad days\nto be supported in a way that creates\nresiliency that you otherwise wouldn't\nhave if you were alone\nabsolutely and this is what jan was\nsaying right you don't leave your job\nyou leave a bad\nmanager right you leave your manager\nyou're saying that yes you're leaving\nthe company yeah you're not leaving the\ncompany maybe not even like\neven the work that you do yeah you just\ndon't like\nthe relationships yeah absolutely that\nmakes so much sense and\ni think that's a great reflection for\neveryone who's listening and watching\nright now to have that reflection in\nyour life and just think of that\nreally simply like who's that go-to\nperson in the workplace\nyou know how could you better your\nrelationship with your manager in in a\nproactive way\nit may it may be great already it may\nnot and the other one of just in your\npersonal life\nhaving three people that you could call\nthat you know are going to respond\nand and i think that's yeah the very\nhigh percentage of american adults\nthat can't name three people yeah that\nwould unconditionally help them\nyeah i paid ben to be my friend\nso i got one of you\nbut yeah no i i think this is really\npowerful stuff because i\ni feel like you know what you've\nuncovered in these blue zones is what's\ndirectly affecting not just our\nlongevity and i and i wanted to draw at\nthat point that you're\nwhat you're saying is this isn't just\nabout living a longer life or a\nhealthier life it's also about living a\nhappier life\nright is that connect true as well or\nare we just talking about longevity and\nhealth\nthere's about an eighty percent overlap\nokay on\nthe so as a rule the same things that\nwill get you to a healthy 95\nwill also ensure you enjoy the journey i\nalso wrote a book called blue zones of\nhappiness and a cover story for national\ngeographic that took the same approach\nof finding statistically happiest places\nand then reverse engineering what they\ndid is\nto offer lessons for people and it turns\nout you know as we heard today\nthat most of what we think brings us\nhappiness is misguided or just plain\nwrong\nabsolutely so this notion that ben just\ngot done talking about that your best\nfriends are going to\nuh making a a friend at work is going to\nbe more important than pay\nso when we work you know we have we\ncertify\nworkplaces and when we go into\nworkplaces we're not counseling the\nthe boss on paying their employees more\nwe're counseling why don't you set up\na sponsor happy hour or\ntake a co-worker to lunch or really\ncreate this environment where it's easy\nto meet\nthat person across the hallway and it's\nnot always just a commercial\nrelationship or a business\nconversation it transcends into the real\nlife\nand a bigger picture are you\nare you seeing workplaces want to create\nblue zones in the workplace\nabsolutely as a minor i can see it being\nvery attractive i worked for\ntwo years at accenture and accenture was\nan organization that really wanted to do\nmore for\nthe health and well-being of its\nemployees and was trying to put so many\ndifferent things in place and\nin different ways we were using a lot of\nthese concepts and so\ni can definitely seeing it being an\namazing place for people what tell me\nabout something\nexperience that you've had in\nperspective you should tell them a\nlittle bit about you\nthis guy's a legend legendary fans spent\n20 years uh with the fortune 1000\ncompanies\nuh in this country trying to identify\nthe right\nuh ways to be able to improve health\nin their workforce for all sorts of\nreasons the number two\nuh line item on any corporation's budget\nare uh big organizations that are\nself-insured or health care costs\nuh and then and then that's not even\ncounting\num things like lost productivity um and\nhow engaged or unengaged people are\ndistracted when they show up at work um\nwellness is a term that i think of that\nis\na bit different than what we're pursuing\nwith blue zones\num and and we made a shift away from\nwellness because\nall the things that dan has talked about\nis that\nwhen when programs were offered in the\nworkplace\nmost of them were oriented around a\nmodel of the individual\ngets connected with an expert a coach a\nprofessional\na plan is designed and then the person\nis encouraged to go follow the plan and\nyou know if you need help here's some\ndigital tools or you know you can make a\nphone call and someone will\nwork with you but essentially it's\neducation\nguidance and then a plan that you're\nsupposed to do and the same statistics\nhold true that that dan talked about\nand in fact it's about single digit\npercentage\nof the effectiveness of this type of an\napproach where it's all about the\nindividual\nand expert type of plan and if you take\nblue\nzones into the workplace to chief\nfinancial officers to the ceos\nto health benefits leaders and heads of\nhhr human resources\nit's such a very different model because\nit is really setting up their\nenvironment\ndifferently um it's doing those purpose\nworkshops it's creating moais in the\nworkplace\num it's it's making uh the extended\neffort\nfor uh the workforce to be able to with\ntheir purpose better known and\nunderstood and\nand clear time away to be able to do\nvolunteer\njust a whole different array of an\napproach\nand and we are seeing those\norganizations that go through\nabout a three-year process to make these\ntype of changes\nand institute their own policies in\ntheir own environment on the things that\nthey can control in the workplace\non behalf of of their their colleagues\noutperforming kind of traditional\nwellness in the workplace type of models\nand and people are very excited about it\nfor the residents in these\nblue zones how much was success\nambition achievement relevant in their\nlife at all not at all right now you\nhave\nbefore we go into a city we we interview\nthe mayor the city manager\nsuperintendent of schools this big ceos\nthe police chief and we show them we\nopen the kimono we are coming in to\ncreate an environment where\nhealthy choices are easier and quite\nhonestly we're going to limit freedoms\nto do unhealthy crap\nand if they're not signed up for that we\ngo to the next city we've had over 400\ncities ask us to do it\nwe've only done it to 49 because if we\ncan't get the\nbuy-in of all the top leaders they\nshould go spend their\ntheir resources elsewhere right let me\ntell you\nwhy ben and i are such a good partner if\ni can\nyeah i came back from blue zones and i\nblue zone one little city called elbert\nlee minnesota it was a big success\num and ben's wife\nliz leto uh ben couldn't sleep one night\nand she had my book blue zones\nand ben was complaining he couldn't\nsleep and and\nliz says about here read this it's a\ngood book and ben reads my book blue\nzone at the time\nben is a pioneer in wellness\nuh 25 years he built a billion and a\nhalf dollar\ncompany uh he a legend a ceo legend\nhe's the one who started if you can't\nmeasure it you can't manage it he's the\none who got behind\ngallop's well-being index which all the\nnobel prize winners use now that came\nout of his\nhe he was the man who got made it happen\nand he reads my book and he calls me up\nand says\ndan i love what you do this is the\nfuture of healthcare let's team up\nthere's no way i could have built this\nout to this\nsize i have without ben's uh gift and\ntalent\nfor management for vision uh for\nuh bringing the most important people to\nthe table\nso you know this is why it's like you\nand your partner you know it's like if\nyou don't have a yang and a yang it just\nit it careens out of control it's an\nawesome story tell me that story\nand beautiful and the thing is is that\namazing\nthe the research and the brilliance of\ndan's work\nis that he's a master at synthesizing\nreally complex things\nand when you start looking at what he's\ndone he's basically\nyou know boiled down the secrets to life\nfor for people who live longest happiest\nbest into these nine core principles\nand health care in our country is so\ncomplicated and it's\njust a morass of of waste and\nand um poorly spent um uh resources\nand it was just like this bright light\nand it's like i had spent\nalmost 30 years you know working like\ncrazy to figure out how to perfect the\nwrong model\nand instantly saw that this was\ngoing to be a way that would redefine\nand it breaks all the rules\nit breaks all the rules and it breaks\nthe chops of\nall the things that we've thought were\nfact based but\nactually i think of dana's introducing\nreally inconvenient truths to the\nestablishment and it's so much fun to\nto go mix it up and and take his\nwonderful\nbeautiful work and have a chance to put\nit into motion and partner with him to\ndo that it's\nit's um it's the most exciting part of\nmy career\num in in life uh doing this work\nyeah i can see it i can tell it's it's\nlovely it's beautiful to watch\nno but it's awesome i love seeing it\nbecause i think that\nit just proves to the fact that this is\nso much more meaningful\nand purposeful and deeply connected to\nwhat both of you believe is is your\nikigai and your\nyou know your purpose in life you know\nwe're here\nat this wonderful um event that arthur\nblank put on\nit salute him for and there's so much\ntheoretical horsepower in that room\nbut it's so hard for academics to often\nput their work into\nto to work in the real world correct\nand so that's what ben has been able to\ndo so it's really\nreally um uh you know it's it's just a\na blessing from heaven that i met ben\nabsolutely no it's amazing to hear the\nstory and and put all the\nconnections i think actually my wife\nwill listen\nto my wife get the credit yeah she's\njust look at all this\nshe goes how does she get it did she buy\nit from a store was she just fascinated\nhow did she get\nher her reading list is always eclectic\nand good\nand mine's typically science stuff and\nthere's just time where\nyou just don't want to read heavy\nscience really yeah and she tossed me a\ntotal\nserendipity i love that and and i\nstarted reading it thought i would fall\nasleep in a few minutes and\ngot out of bed she was where are you\ngoing i go i'm gonna go read the rest of\nthis book because this is\nthis is what we've been searching for\nand it came right on the heels of having\nspent time\nwith that advisory group of scientists\non the gallup well being indexed\nin washington dc and and asking the\nquestion\nif if you didn't just want to measure\nwell-being and report\nthe state of it but you actually wanted\nto at scale improve well-being for\nlarge groups for populations for\ncountries you know what what are the\nlevers to pull\nyes and so uh i i traveled home and\nand as dan said i was running a big\ncompany and we had\nof there were like five things like you\nhave to give individual\nknowledge tools and and ways that they\ncan work on this themselves and we check\nthat we got that\num there was access to experts all kinds\nof experts we had more\nnetworked experts than you could shake a\nstick as i can check the box and it was\nlike\nhow good are you at helping people\ncreate new social connections\nwe just kind of paused and then it was\nlike how well\ndo you have ways to be able to influence\npeople's surroundings\nthe man-made surroundings and make\nsemi-permanent permanent changes\nin those that yield and nudge people to\nbetter health and i'm like i don't know\neither and then finally it was that you\nknow the big things\nhow do you affect law and policy and\nculture and what do you have for that\nand so i was looking at this scoreboard\nflying home and i'm like\nreally want to change well-being and and\npursue it this deep passion\nand it was that same night when i got\nhome that my wife tossed me in a book\nand then i'm reading this thing and i'm\nlike\noh my gosh the stamp buttoner guy has\ncrafted the master plan for\nnot just longevity but for well-being\nyes\num and you know he didn't answer the\nphone on the first ring either\nhe had he was guarded well guarded from\ncorporate\namerica leaders he was no part of it\nhe wouldn't take my call i called and\ncalled and called and called and finally\nhis his gatekeeper i thought i would\nwear him down\nand and and finally i just said okay\nthis is it i go uh this is the last time\ni want you just to listen for two\nminutes\nand i'm gonna describe to you wait wait\nwait he flew the corporate jet\nup from i had exactly two employees\nand he ran a company with 3 500 people\nand he flew his corporate jet up\nand showed up at the office and then of\ncourse he said he\nwas meeting he just showed up without an\ninvite i i wasn't i had never talked to\nhim\nand i all right so the dan's famous for\nwalking meetings\nso we met for a little while and these\nlittle wrestlers he's taking notes we're\nasking questions he's so good at\ninterviewing\nand and investigative kind of uh\ntechniques and finally he said then\nlet's go for a walk and his office\nuh was in an area that was close to\nmississippi river where where there were\npaths\nand it was close to three or four hours\nlater after a long walk that we just\nsaid\nlet's go blue zone america shook hands\nand yeah\nand went after it and no two of the\nhandshake at the end of the day we've\nhad\nwe have a very complex you know we work\nwith cities and insurance companies\nin every place the the mayors have to\nagree and we have a partner\nsharecare and we have uh you know it's\nultimately the\nblue cross blue shield plan or the\nhospital so their their their\nlabyrinthine contract ben and i shook\nhands\nalmost nine years ago we have a big\ncontract that underpins but\nwe have always he you know i was he\ndidn't always\nwe didn't always work together we were\non the uh he was a partner company and i\nwas\nyou know partner companies often have to\nget through a lot of\nwork a lot of things through and there\ncan all these\nlayers and um ben and i have always\noperated\nfirst of all we had a handshake we\nlooked at each other in the eye and we\nsaid okay\nyou got my word and 120 pages of\ncontract don't\ndoes no matter we're going to work it\nout and uh now\nthree years ago ben became available or\ntwo years ago and\nand now he's ceo of blue zones and uh\nyou can imagine the\nthe thrill it is for me to have\nsuch a uh a a talented you know\nexecutive powerhouse running a company\nthat had two people with\nthree people when when we first met so\nand now we're growing\ngrowing crazy yeah awesome and it just\nshows how we can use\nsuch a diverse range of skill sets oh\nyeah interests and backgrounds to want\nto do more meaningful work in the world\nand how\nactually all your experience is so\npowerful for this use\nyou got to find partners dan and i\npartnered to do this but we got we have\nto go find\npartners yes in the communities\nthemselves too so this thing is a\nis a connected link of really deep\npartnerships and it's a leader it's as a\nleadership model\num and it's it's not a surprise if you\ngo\nlook at our 49 communities you will find\nyou know\n49 groups of just incredible leaders who\nwanted to partner with dan and i so you\nknow\nit's it's fun i've got two more\nquestions for you before we round up one\nwas\nhow much has this all impacted your own\npersonal lives how much of this\nare you trying to practice and use in\nyour day-to-day lives\nfor yourselves\nwell most of it i would say of the nine\num power nine blue zones i i do eight of\nthem pretty regularly\nso i mostly plant-based diet uh i do\nmy my role for physical activity is i do\nsomething fun every day\num i know exactly my sense of purpose\nit's this work here\nand and i do this work it's very hard to\nget me to do something that outside\nthose certain boundaries i have let go a\nfew friends in my network\num because i knew that they were they\nweren't healthy for me and i proactively\nadded a\na few new friends uh i don't go to\nchurch as much as my mother would like\nme to go\nto this is one thing but i do i keep\ninvest in my family which is another\nreally big and important one\nand um you know i do happy hour\nwhich is coming right up here it is it\nis\nmy profile is pretty similar so i always\nthink about where can i\nwhere can i add and one thing we didn't\ntalk about well we did talk about\npurpose\nthis idea of downshift and that's\ntaking time you know purposely to\nreflect you heard some of it discussed\ntoday\num you know the gratitude yeah pieces so\num\nthat's what i'm working on the most\nright now because\nwhat we do in our partnership what we're\ndoing is really busy\ni get it um and you know i think\nyour your happiness research would point\nout that well slept people\nare um are are much happier and\nand you you even heard data this morning\nabout uh\nyou could you could knock out a bunch of\nmental health illness if people just\nslept right\nso you know my two things that i'm\nworking on in addition to the good\nthings that i'm doing\nout of dan's um work is purposely\ndownshifting\neach day yeah which is hard uh to do for\nme\nand um and getting the right amount of\nsleep absolutely and tell me about that\nfamily piece and the reason why i saved\nit to last is i\ni wanted to answer this question was i\nfeel so many people today\nstruggle to find their home with their\nfamily\nboard games right that's the solution\nit's epic in our household really when\nyou say we're doing board games\neverybody comes out of the woodwork and\nit is\nit is fun and and\nwe have um you know we exchange you know\ngifts at birthdays and holidays yeah\nchristmas um there's always new who can\nfind the\nthe the newest best most challenging\nboard game to play\nokay because it creates this\nsocial construct for the family and and\ncreates a\nwhole different atmosphere for\nconversation and\num you know the board game itself kind\nof\ncreates an equivalency um yeah just\nabout it so we\nso it's great time it's not tv it's not\neven you know\ngoing to doing something but just time\ntogether yeah\nany other thoughts on that one well i do\nsee in blue zones people are keeping\ntheir aging parents nearby\nand which imparts not only\nmore life expectancy one of the surest\nways\nto see the life expectancy of your mom\nor dad\ndrop is put them put him or her in a\nretirement home\nshaves off two to six years of life\nexpectancy in blue zones that would\nshame the family\nso aging mom and dad stay home but that\nnot only helps aging mom and dad because\nthey feel a sense of purpose and they\nget out of bed in the morning\nand they they uh more likely to stay\nactive but also there's something called\nthe grandmother effect that has shown\nthat in in households where there's a\ngrandparent involved the kids\nare healthier and lower rates of\nmortality and they even do better in\nschool\nso it's this beautiful virtuous circle\nand i know not all families get along\nbut i will say investing in trying to\nkeep that\ninto the family to try to keep people\ntogether\nis really a worthwhile uh endeavor for\nlongevity and for happiness\namazing so one of the tragedies of the\nblue zone is the standard american diet\nhit in the 1970s and 80s and now they're\ndisappearing\nthe same problems that are killing us\ntoday\ndiabetes heart disease cancer are\nhitting them starting to hit the blue\nzone\nso the national geographic photographer\ni work with\ndavid mclean and i went back to all five\nblue zones\nand we got older women 70 80 years old\nto cook\nthe traditional foods that they've grown\nup on so this is the food that people\nhave\neaten to live to be 100 and i sat on a\nstool with a
