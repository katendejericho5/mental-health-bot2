about it\nlots of mutual friends yeah exactly so i\nfeel connected to you already oh amazing\nman well thank you thank you so much how\ndo you\ndescribe someone who has done five\niron mans and on five hawaiian islands\nlike how do you describe that person\ni don't know you're the host that's your\njob\ni never know how to how to uh articulate\nwhat it is that i do people\nwhat do you do and um yes i've done some\nathletic things but you know i'm a\nwriter i'm a podcast host i'm a father\ni do lots of different things and and uh\ni i never really know how to\nanswer that question or fully describe\nyou know i think that's all of us today\nnone of us know how to explain what we\ndo my mom has no idea how to explain\nwhat i do\nmy wife has no idea what i do and even i\ndo and they're like yeah what do you\nwant your lower third to be i'm like i\ndon't know like are you gonna get a real\njob yeah exactly\nexactly but uh tell me about you you\njust said that your father your father\nof four\nwhat what's the best thing you enjoy\ndoing with your kids like\nwhat's been the last crazy thing that\nyou've done with them crazy thing\nwell we were in australia for the month\nof december so that was super fun\num spent uh time in sydney and in byron\nbay so i just like being out in nature\nwith my kids\njust simply you know it's the simple\nthings it's not like oh here's the crazy\nthing that we did it's the little\nmoments it's the\nyou know conversation in the car on the\nway to dropping them off at school\nor you know a walk with the dogs on the\ntrails like outside\nmy home i live in a pretty rural area\noutside los angeles\nso those are the those are the things\nthat i think are the most\nmeaningful and anybody who's a parent i\nthink can probably connect with that\nand any memorable conversations recently\nwhere they've given some words of wisdom\nto you\nor what you had\ntrust me you know my biggest teachers uh\nyou know my 16 year old right now\nis is really handing it to me you know\nand i think i think that i've got my\nspiritual program dialed in and that i\nhave you know\num transcended so many of my character\ndefects and they say\nlike i'm long time in recovery for\nalcoholism\nand one of the kind of catch phrases is\nif you want to confront your character\ndefects get into a relationship\nand i would up that ante by saying have\na 16 year old daughter\nand she will show you exactly where\nyou're at uh and i feel like god or the\nuniverse or however you want to describe\nyour higher power kind of puts in your\npath uh\nthese kinds of teachers who will um\nchallenge you in ways that that uh\nyou didn't anticipate my my 16 year old\ndaughter certainly does that she knows\nhow to press my buttons and you know we\nget into it daily and\nit's great for both of us but it's hard\nman\nit's hard being a parent yeah no i i\nhave no\ni have plans at some point to become a\nparent but i can see and observe from\nother people's experiences how hard it\nis\nso i'm making sure that i'm as prepared\nas i can be\nright from from that point of view\nbefore i dive into it so\nyeah i will come to you for some some\nadvice and tips everyone's always\ntelling me like\nwhere are you gonna write children's\nbook i'm like i am never gonna write a\nbook and i had to be a parent because\nit's i i don't i don't see there being a\nformula and when i speak to parents\nthey're always very\nopen about the fact of just it's a new\nlearning curve every day and\nevery day yeah it's awesome and your\nwife is an incredible\nuh vegan chef and cook and yeah she's\nshe's also somebody that that kind of\ndefies definition she does lots of\nthings it's funny she's written\nthree plant-based cookbooks plant power\naway plant parody italia she wrote a\nbook on how to make plant-based cheese\ncalled this this cheese is nuts\nand the funny thing is that's how people\nknow of her is this this sort of vegan\nchef and she's like i'm not a vegan chef\nthat was just one thing that i did\nlike she would consider herself much\nmore an artist\na musician a spiritual teacher she has\nher own podcast\num and uh her wisdom is profound so\ni learned from her daily she's very much\nmy teacher as well\nyeah that's beautiful yeah i feel that\nway but with my wife like\ni when i met my wife a lot of i'd been\ninvolved in meditation and spirituality\nfor a lot longer\nin terms of time and so a lot of people\nthought that\nshe was not going to be spiritual enough\nto marry me\nand it's like the joke's on everyone\nbecause she's like so much faster past\nthan me naturally and\nintentionally and like all of this is so\nnatural and easy and organic for her\nwhereas for me it's always been\na work like i've had to work for any\ngrowth i've had\nspiritually or internally yeah whereas\nfor her she's kind of like just\ngot this natural energy yeah exactly and\nit's it's fun to be around that and and\nit sounds like your wife has the same so\nyeah very much so\nyeah we're very we're very lucky yeah\nyeah we upgraded it's good\nyou're lucky but also sometimes you want\nto just\nrelax you know what i mean and julia\nwill be like\nis that really what you want to be doing\nright now like she's pushed she's always\npushing me and\nand that's great you know i'm always\ngrowing because she's challenging me\nor or she's she's sort of showing me\nwhere i need that growth you know and\nsometimes you don't want to always look\nat that you want to just\nnot be reminded that you still have\ngrowth uh\nthat can be had um so that's that's like\nthe\nthe challenging part of it but you know\nof course it's a gift right yeah and i\nwould not have\naccomplished any of the things that i've\ndone without you know having that\npartnership\nyeah what do you do to relax then i mean\ni like going to the movies you know i'm\nlike you know like stuff like that\nyou know what's your favorite movie you\nsaw recently uh favorite movie recently\ni'm a big movie guy too so i mean tv\nshows you know i see\ni see everything i can even find the\ngood and the worst movies i don't care\nokay um but i loved uh i love jojo\nrabbit i thought\ni haven't seen that yeah ttt is taika\nytt is a\nbrilliant director i really enjoyed that\num what else have i seen recently\ni mean versus ferrari i did yeah yeah\nit's good joker was amazing yeah\nand uh what else did i see recently so\nuh\nqueen and slim i just saw that oh i've\ngot that queued up to stream i haven't\nwatched it yet it's heartbreaking\nbut but really good amazing that's\nawesome man and\nlet's go back now let's let's talk a bit\nabout how you got here and i know you've\ntold this story before but for me it's\nfascinating and i think for my audience\nit will be\nfascinating to hear and please share any\nparts that you haven't shared before or\nget lost in it in your own way but your\nrelationship with drugs and alcohol\ntook you away from your athleticism\nwhen did you get introduced to it and\nwhy was it\nso captivating or intoxicating\nthat it that it took you away from\nsomething that is so natural to you yeah\nwell i think\num you know i get the question all the\ntime like why do you think you're an\nalcoholic and and you can kind of\nchase that answer to your you know for\nthe rest of your life and i'm not sure\nyou can ever get a completely\nsatisfactory answer\nyou know i am an alcoholic because i am\ni'm more interested in what the solution\nis to the problem then trying to figure\nout what caused it\nbut i would say that from a very young\nage you know i was somebody who\nwas naturally pretty socially awkward\nand very introverted i had difficulty\nmaking friends and\nyou know i was the kid on the playground\nwho was picked last for kickball like i\nwas not\nyou know um i was really i felt like i\nlacked that rulebook for life that\neveryone seemed to\nnaturally have i was unaware that there\nwas any other way of\nliving other than how i was living until\ni discovered\nalcohol and i think you know as i was\ngrowing up\ni found my way into swimming and that\nwas the one thing that i could do that i\nhad some\nnatural acumen for and i kind of doubled\ndown on that\nand got better and better and the better\ni got in swimming the better i got\nin school like i learned these tools and\nthese skills about\nyou know what happens when you apply\nyourself and you're dedicated and you\nsee\nprogress in results so by the time i was\na senior in high school i was one of the\nyou know better swimmers on the eastern\nseaboard and i got in all the great\ncolleges and all of that\nended up going to stanford number one\ncollegiate swimming program in the\ncountry and obviously an incredible\nacademic institution\nand that's really where uh i was\nintroduced to alcohol for the first time\ni got\ndrunk a couple times prior to that on\nrecruiting trips but\nthat was where it really took hold of me\nand you know i have very vivid\nvisceral memories of of that feeling of\nbeing drunk for the first time\nand having this sensation like i was\nbeing wrapped in a warm blanket and\nthe answer to every question i ever had\nwas suddenly you know at my fingertips\nand i felt comfortable in my own skin\nand able to have a conversation and just\nyou know capable of kind of navigating\nlife in a way that i felt like everyone\nelse\nnaturally knew how to do and i thought\nthis is the solution that i've been\nlooking for\ni think that that's a common sensibility\nthat you find\nyou know amongst alcoholics and drug\naddicts\nand it works you know it brought me it\ntaught me social skills and suddenly i\ncould go to parties and talk to girls\nand crack jokes and all of that\nbut it works until it doesn't work and\nit stops working and then it starts to\ndenigrate your life and it didn't take\nlong before\nit started to undermine you know the\ngoals and the ambitions that i had\nbecause i was\nyou know i was and and still am a very\nambitious person but\nit really just eroded all of that and\nyou know it's a progressive disease but\nover time it took me to some really dark\nand\nand desperate places yeah and that's why\ni think it is important to\nlook at the cause or at least why i find\nit important to look at the course\nbecause\nthere are probably so many people\nlistening right now watching right now\nthat are like\nrich i'm not yet an alcoholic or i'm not\nyet\na drug addict but i feel the same way as\nyou felt as a kid i feel socially\nawkward\ni find it hard to make conversations i\nstruggle so they're actually\non the precipice of going in the\ndirection you went in\nso it's almost like when we can stop\nthere we can actually go well what's the\nissue there like\nwhy is it that so many of us growing up\nfeel picked last like you said everyone\nhad the rule book right like it felt\nlike everyone had the rule but the funny\nthing is no one did yeah of course\nbut it felt like that to you and that's\nhow people are listening and watching\nright now they feel that i have the rule\nbecause they feel you have the wrong\nbook or\nthey feel their friends have the rule\nbook how do we solve it even before\nthat stage what solutions have you come\nup with there of what are\nother better healthier ways\nto open up to feel confident to feel\ncomfortable talking to people\nwell i think it it it it then becomes uh\nabout the language that you speak so\nwell right it's an internal\njob it's an internal journey that i\nthink we all have to go on to figure out\nwhat makes us uniquely who we are uh\nand you know those those sort of natural\ndiscomforts that i think we all have on\nsome level\nwhether they're a direct result of\nchildhood trauma or just\nimproper parenting or an unhealthy\nenvironment in which somebody you know\nwas raised and grew up\nall of these things contribute to that\nsense of insecurity or or\nyou know a lack of connection and i\nthink the way forward\nas opposed to trying to medicate through\ndrugs and alcohol or other things social\nmedia\nyou know shopping whatever it is\nanything outside of yourself\nto resolve or numb whatever emotional\njust you know sort of discontentment\nthat you're experiencing is\na feudal errand right like the only the\nonly sustainable healthy way of\naddressing that\nis to find a way to get comfortable with\nwho we are internally and i think it\nbegins with\na practice of self-love and a gratitude\npractice\nmeditation mindfulness there's so much\nmainstream\nacceptance and recognition of all of\nthese tools that i feel were lacking\nwhen i was growing up i mean i'm older\nthan you and\nand i didn't go on the you know amazing\nspiritual journey that that you have\ngone on\num but i think there there is now um\nuh you know kind of an amenability to\nthat that that didn't exist in the in\nthe 70s you know when i was a kid\nand i think that's great so for anybody\nwho's watching or listening if you're\nfeeling that\num level of discontent or you're\nexperiencing\num you know an inability to connect with\nother people\nyou know be aware of when you're\nreaching outside of yourself\nto change that internal state and\ninstead kind of direct that\ninward and go on that journey instead\nand i think it will lead you to a you\nknow a healthier destination over time\nyeah really well said and i i think\nyou're spot on because what i find is\nit's also the narrative that children\nhear from their teachers parents\nand media so i remember if you're a kid\nthat spends time alone teachers or\nparents would be like\noh he or she doesn't have a lot of\nfriends right rather than\na narrative yeah exactly rather than the\nnarrative of\noh he or she's really comfortable being\nalone yeah right it's like the narrative\nof always negative or like if you had a\nbirthday party\nand only five kids showed up it's like\noh they're not very popular at school\nwhen actually most of us would say we\nprobably don't have more than five great\nfriends yeah i mean i think society has\ncreated a very narrow\nbox or checklist uh and we're all\nexpected to kind of fall in line\nand meet that criteria and the truth is\nis that the human condition is much more\nvaried and we need to celebrate those\ndifferences\nrather than judge them against the\nparameters of what's socially acceptable\nand that limited scope and i think\nthat's what we've done traditionally\nand that marginalizes most people right\nso it's about broadening the aperture\nand understanding that\nthat we all have gifts and things that\nmake us uniquely\nwho we are and to the extent that we can\ncelebrate those differences\nor those unique qualities i think that's\na\nand also like a very healthy path\nforward yeah what have been your\nself-love and gratitude practices\nbecause i know you mentioned both of\nthem there and they're very important\npillars in your own life what's a great\nself-love practice like a daily thing\npeople have done that's really well\ni will preface my answer to this by\nsaying that that self-love and gratitude\nthese are not my natural dispositions my\nnatural disposition is self-loathing\ninsecurity uh resentment anger like all\nof that right\nand and of course that's fertile ground\nfor alcoholism\nso i have to work very hard to keep\nthose negative\nemotional tendencies at bay and and to\nand to cultivate to bring gratitude and\nself-love into my life so\nyou know it begins with very simple\ncheesy practices\nlike repeating the mantra i love myself\nor\neven more powerful what would somebody\nwho loves themself\ndo in this situation if i love myself\nwhat would i do in this situation\nalways bringing yourself back to that do\nyou know um kamal ravikant\ni don't know so he's an amazing guy you\nshould have him on your show but he just\nwrote a book\ncalled uh um love yourself like your\nlife depends on it and it's full of all\nof these kind of self-love practices\nwhich are very simple but i think very\nprofound\nyeah cultivating gratitude involves\ncreating a gratitude list every single\nday writing down the simple things that\nyou're grateful for\nand then expressing that gratitude\nthrough actions and your inner\nconnections with other human beings on a\ndaily basis\ntell me about instance where you used\nbecause you're right like we see these\neverywhere they're in articles like you\nsaid they're considered cheesy now but\nwe both know that they work tell me tell\nme about a time when you use the first\none for example that question of if i\nloved myself\nhow would i do this tell me about an\ninstance where you've seen that\nprofoundly affect your life and with\nmaking a gratitude list like\ntell me about a time when you're in that\nself-loathing totally degenerative kind\nof position\nand then having a gratitude list how\nthat's made by switch well i think\nthere's micro examples like when you're\nchoosing what food to eat\nyou know are you going to choose the\nfast food thing or the healthy thing\nwell if you love yourself you're going\nto choose it so there's there's plenty\nof things like that but i think in a\nvery macro level like i've\nleveraged these practices to quite\nliterally change my life like i\nfor many years was a practicing\ncorporate attorney very unhappy in that\nprofession\ntrying to jam this you know square peg\ninto a round hole forever until\ni had a bit of an existential crisis\nkind of crash into a health scare that\nreally forced me to take stock of how i\nwas living and make some changes\nand i made a decision a very conscious\ndecision at this time it was right\naround when i turned 40\nthat i was going to engage in activities\nthat made me happy\neven if they made no sense even if they\nweren't moving my life forward and\noccurred in a traditional career\nsensibility um and that meant like i'm\ngoing to go to the pool in the middle of\nthe day and go for a swim or i'm going\nto go trail running or i'm going to ride\nmy bike\nlike on on a at 2 o'clock on a wednesday\nwhen i'm supposed to be at work\nand i didn't care what anyone thought of\nthat and i feel like that was very much\nuh it was very difficult for me to begin\ndoing things like that but\nthat was how i was exercising or\npracticing self-love like\ni'm just going to do this thing that\nmakes me happy it's very simple\nit's a very primal activity and it\ndoesn't have to mean\nanything it doesn't have to be moving me\nforward in any particular direction\nit's really just honoring myself little\ndid i know that\nrepeating those behaviors over time\nwould completely change how i live my\nlife\nin every simple regard but at the time i\ndidn't know that it was just\npracticing honoring myself and what was\ndifferent i'm sure\nin your career like the career path you\nhad that you wanted to break away from\ni'm sure there were a number of peers\nthat wanted to break away too\ni'm guessing i'm assuming the legal\nprofession is filled with people who are\nare not not exactly fulfilled right\ni i assume yeah it's an interesting\nthing though when you say you know i'm\nnot going to do this anymore i'm going\nto go do this other thing\nyou think they would celebrate you but\nactually they get very angry\nof course yeah because if you could\nbreak out that means they can too and\nthey have to\nthey have to really confront that in\nthemselves and that's my voice so if you\nhad peers that\nwhat was different about your ability to\nbreak out and and i'm not saying and i\nyou know you're not an egotistic person\ni'm not asking you to be autistic i'm\nasking you to\nshare lessons what was different in that\nyou were able to break out and do\nsomething that now you're more aligned\nwith\nwho you want to be as the future moves\non versus\nthe people that don't make that step\nwhat is the difference\ni think it was abandoning any connection\nto practicality\nand really living in faith you know it\nreally tested my faith\nit because the reason i was able to do\nit is because\nand this is with julie's help was\nbecause i embraced the fact that it was\na spiritual journey fundamentally\nso yes i left being a lawyer and i\nbecame this ultra endurance athlete and\nauthor and podcaster\nbut it wasn't because when i was a\nlawyer i got out my whiteboard and\ncreated\na wish list or you know basically tried\nto\nyou know create this is my dream\nscenario for my life\ni just started engaging in what i felt\nwas more aligned with my\nunique blueprint and with that\ni would start pulling on the threads\nthat would appear every day and i was\ntested it was very difficult we went\nthrough\nincredible financial dismantling like i\nwas tested in every\nregard you can imagine people saying i\nwas crazy\nall of it right but by having faith and\ntrusting\nin that sense of what was right for\nmyself and learning to\num listen to and rely on that\ninstinctual voice i think taught me a\nlot about\nwho i am and also about resolve and\nultimately i think that's why i was able\nto\nsee it through so if you look on the\ninternet it kind of looks like it all\nhappened like this like overnight i just\nmade this decision and became this other\nthing\nthis is this was like i mean i've been\ndoing this for you know\n15 years at this point and i got sober\nat 31 it really began\nwhen i went to rehab at age 31 and\nstarted to\nre-configure my life based on spiritual\nprinciples and here i am\n22 23 years later still learning still\ngrowing still\nmaking mistakes so it's very much not an\novernight thing and it's all a spiritual\njourney\nand what is your faith in at that time\nbecause it's almost like\nmost people when they're in that\ntransition it's like you don't really\nhave faith in yourself or you may not\nhave faith in your skills like is your\nfaith in the\nbelief that doing the right thing is the\nright thing either way or is your faith\nin the fact that you have your wife\nwho's\nsupportive like what is that faith in\nbecause i feel like that's the hardest\nthing for people and\ni can only speak for myself that i knew\nthat my faith was in the guidance of my\nteachers my faith was in\nthe books that i'd read and the\nphilosophy i believed in and my faith\nwas in\nthere's a beautiful beautiful verse in a\ntext called the manusmithi which says\nthat\nif you protect your purpose your purpose\nprotects you\nright and that was what my faith was in\nwas that statement and i was like i am\ngoing to\ntest that statement to its limits but\nthat statement requires that you\nunderstand what your purpose is correct\nyes and i very much did not know what\nthat's what i'm saying so what was your\nfaith in so\nwell first of all i will say that i was\non a i was on a journey to discover\nwhat that purpose was and i had a\nfundamental belief that that i did have\na per\nthat there is or was a purpose for me to\ndiscover\nand i used endurance training\nas a vehicle for that process of\nself-discovery because there's something\nabout\nbeing out on a trail for hours and hours\nand hours around an eight-hour bike ride\nyou're stripped of all artifice and the\nkind of low-grade suffering that you\nexperience\nforces you to confront yourself in a\nvery honest way right\nand you meet yourself in a place that\nyou're not used to and\nthere's a lack of of artificiality and\nartifice in that place where you can be\nreally honest like you're you're you're\nwrestling with your soul\nat the most profound level i think and\nand that's what attracted me to this\nworld\nand that's what helped me answer all of\nthese questions\ngetting comfortable in that crucible but\nif i had to say what is the philosophy\nphilosophical belief that kind of\nunderpins that\ni would say that we are here to grow and\nwe are here to\non a journey of greater\nself-actualization and the closer we can\napproximate\nthat place of self-actualization the\nbetter position we are\nin to express our unique blueprint and\npurpose\nin service to other human beings right\nand for me it's been a process of trying\nto uncover what that is for me\nand then ultimately bring greater\nexpression to that\nfor the betterment of other people what\ndoes it feel like right now that is for\nyou\ncompared to when you first started on\nthis path where's the\nevolution of that yeah well it's\ninteresting because\nfor a long time it was like oh you're\nthe vegan ultra endurance athlete guy\nand it's like yeah i am and i did those\nthings\num but that's just one expression of who\ni am\nand the podcast you know much like your\nshow\nhas been about trying to continue that\ngrowth and to understand that\nthat i was able to do those things in\nthe endurance world\num because i understood that we are all\nsitting on top\nof gigantic reservoirs of human\npotential that remain untapped\nand i was able to tap into that aspect\nof myself in an athletic context\nand express that but there are all these\nother areas of untapped potential\nin my life and in my friends people that\ni meet\neverybody's life right and i wanted to\ncontinue that growth curve and that\nlearning process of\nof tapping into those other areas\nspiritually mentally emotionally\nintellectually socially every aspect of\nwhat it means to be\nas self-actualized as we possibly can\nand what do we do that you've mentioned\nthat a few times now like\nyou know it's interesting that when you\nachieve something your identity becomes\ncrafted around it\nso it's almost like you're that healthy\nvegan dude and you know like you did\nlike and then\nand i can see that there's a part of you\nthat almost\nthere's a part of you that's like but\nthat's not all of me\nand and i'm more than that yeah i don't\nwant to be defined by that\nhow do you process that because i think\na lot of people struggle with that\nwhether it's their past\nfailures or their past successes that\nstart to define\neverything about who they attract in\ntheir life who they spend time with what\nopportunities they come their way\ni mean i'll give an example of something\nthat's coming to my mind right now is\nwhen uh when we had kobe bryant on the\nshow\nand kobe started to talk about how like\nand this this was huge for me he was\nsaying\nbasically no one believed that he could\nmake tv or movies\nor media because he was a basketball\nplayer they're like what do you know\nabout this space\nand so when he was trying to sell these\nshows no one wanted to buy them\nand that's why he had to build his own\nstudio and that's where he was building\nthe studio for dear basketball and he\nwas writing these novels and these books\nthat were then being turned into\nmovies and tv shows and podcasts so he\neven someone like him was totally being\npigeonholed and defined how do you\nprocess that for yourself and how do you\nhelp other people process\nanyone who feels limited by their past\nfailures but also limited by their past\nsuccesses\nwell a couple things yeah first of all\num\nthat identity or whatever it is that's\nlooming out there is just a story\nit's only as powerful uh as as you allow\nit to be\nright you always have control\nover that narrative or how strongly you\nwant to be reminded of a certain\nidentity\nyou can always recraft that you only\nhave control over your own behaviors and\nyour own thoughts and your own\ninteractions with other human beings you\ncan't control how other people perceive\nyou that's none of your business\nso if you're unhappy with the story\nthat's being told about you\nall you can do is act in contravention\nof that you can't control how other\npeople perceive that\nbut you can control the story you tell\nyourself about who you are so it's about\nbecoming you know you you hear the adage\nof like be the\nbe the movie star in your own movie of\nthe movie of your life right\nand understand that at any given moment\nyou that these stories are just they're\ndrawn out of thin air\nthey're they're they're they're not\nthey're not real this is a projection\nthat comes from a collective imagination\nso change the story if you don't like it\nand if you don't like this story that\nother people are telling about you\nyou can mute that and just do your own\nthing so when i didn't\nyou know when i didn't want to be\npigeonholed as the vegan you know\nathlete i just\nstarted a podcast and started talking\nabout other stuff you know and then\nseven years later\nthat's still a thing but you know i'm\nknown for other things now\nyeah people will fall into line you know\nwith with\nthat you know based upon your behavior\nand your actions yeah with your identity\nthe way it is right now what are you\nmost excited\nto not be known for but\nbe acknowledged for what you're doing\nlike for yourself not from other people\nnot for the external validation but\nwhat are you most excited about doing\nfor yourself just continuing to learn\nyou know i just i want to be a lifelong\nlearner and i think that that growth\ncurve you know always exists and there's\nalways\npeople out there that you can uh that\nyou can\ntake valid information and tools from to\nimprove your life\nso i don't spend a lot of time thinking\nabout how i want to be perceived no of\ncourse um\nbut i think that uh and and people ask\nme like oh what's the what's the vision\nwhere do you see yourself in five\nit's like i don't think about that like\ni'm so fulfilled in doing what i'm doing\nright now and the fact\nthat i get to be on this personal growth\ntrajectory\nby having amazing conversations with\nincredible human beings and then you get\nto share that with other people and it\nimpacts them i mean\ni don't know about you but i can't think\nof anything more um\nyou know more gratifying any any kind of\ncareer trajectory that would be\nmore gratifying than that what's the\nmost interesting thing you learned\nrecently whether it was a skill or a\ntechnique or a fact or a stat or\nsome research that blew your mind or\nsome experience that just really\nchanged the way you were thinking about\nsomething i'd probably go back to kamal\nravikant like\nhim and his simple practices of learning\nhow to love himself like\nhe went he walked me through these\nexperiences where he really hit rock\nbottom emotionally in a very in in a\ncouple different ways\nthroughout his life and how these very\nbasic simple\neasy to apply practices have transformed\nhow he sees the world and experiences\nthe world\ni think is really profound because of\nits sheer simplicity\nand power do you think based on that\nwhat you just said now\nhumans only change through pain i get\nthat a lot i mean\npain is pain is is is the best motivator\nfor change\nobviously and i think the biggest\nchanges that i've made in my life have\nreally been forged through pain\ni'm stubborn like i don't i'm not going\nto change until you know my whole world\nis falling\non top of me and then oh yeah okay i\nguess i need to\nmodify that um but it is amazing\nhow human beings are wired that way\nbecause\nthe possibility of change exists in\nevery moment\nright and yet we seem incapable or\nor challenged in our ability to leverage\nthat unless\nwe're being pressured by some external\nforce to do so\nyeah if someone's listening or watching\nright now but is feeling like they're\na safety secure\nstability motivated individual\nand they're like there's just too much\nrisk for me it's like\neven the spiritual faith everything you\nguys are talking about like that's just\nyou know to live in that uncertainty to\nlive with that much faith to\nto push to that degree what what are\nyour advice for them like what would you\nsay to that kind of well i would say\nthat security is an illusion\ni think people that are focused on\nsecurity have control issues they think\nthat they\ncan control the world outside of\nthemselves and their own behavior and i\nthink\nthat is a a vast illusion that is an\nepidemic\nin our culture i think in every moment\nwe have this sense of\ni'm good things are static like i can\njust stay in this place and the truth is\nwith every breath with every thought\nthat we entertain with every word that\ncomes out of our mouth\nwe're either growing as an individual or\nwe are regressing\nthat's the truth right and there is no\nsecurity\neverything is a risk we're here for a\nvery short period of time\nso my call to action to everybody is\ndon't wait\nuntil you find yourself in some\nexistential crisis because you've been\nliving\nyour life based upon some you know\nsocial rule book that doesn't fit your\nown blueprint\ninstead embrace what is uniquely you and\nhave the courage and the fortitude and\nthe faith to try to bring expression to\nthat\nit may be scary and it might contravene\nwhat your parents want for you\nand it might seem risky but ultimately\ni think the riskiest thing to do is to\nplay it safe and live your life in\naccordance with you know somebody else's\nexpectations of what you\nshould do and be how did you know that\nyou found\nsomething about yourself that was\nuniquely you like you've said that a few\ntimes now uniquely you how\nhow do you know when something is\nuniquely you\nbecause i feel like so many of us are\neither so influenced by everything\nthat's happening or\nwe just i feel like we've lost our\nability to talk to ourselves and know\nthat that's our voice\nyeah right like it's like most people\nwhen you hear a voice\nthey hear a voice in their head they\ndon't know if that's them or\nsomething else and they can't tell the\ndifference so what are those\nindicators or signals where you're like\nyeah that i'm getting closer\neven if i'm not it's a really good\nquestion um\nand i don't have like a simple pithy\nanswer sure\ni think it's i think it's hard you know\ni think you're correct\nin that we're so distracted\nyou know our phones are always in our\nhands there's always a reason to\nnot be present with ourselves and the\nmore detached we become\nthe more difficult it is to know what\nthat internal voice is so i think\nthe process of of of\ntrying to understand what is uniquely\nyou know what is unique about\njay involves that looking inward process\nright\nit's about meditation and mindfulness\nand getting quiet\nand trying to you know spend time uh\ncontemplating like what was it that made\nyou happy as a kid\nlike what did you like to do when you\nwere left to your own devices that now\nyou feel like you haven't done in a long\ntime or would be foolish as an adult to\nspend time doing and maybe there's a\nlesson there for you to see\nyou know i don't know i can't answer\nthat for you yeah but i know that those\nanswers\nreside within all of us and in order to\nheed them or get clarity you really have\nto you really have to have the\ndiscipline\nto um carve out that kind of quiet time\nsolitude with yourself what's the best\nadvice you've received on solitude on\nthe podcast is there anyone you remember\nthat\nkind of you just felt embodied solitude\nthe best or that kind of quiet or that\nyeah i mean there's been a couple people\nyou know of course you have like\nmeditation masters like sharon salzberg\ni think maybe the most profound though\nin in the most grounded\nway was you've all know harare yeah\nbasically talking about how like clarity\nis a superpower\nand now because we're so distracted\ndistraction is our natural disposition\nto just be clear and quiet to have\npresence of mind\nto have clarity about what you think\nabout a particular thing\nis a superpower where that used to just\nbe normal\nright yeah which kind of makes it easier\nto distinguish yourself\nbecause all you have to do is put the\nphone away learn how to be quiet\nlearn how to connect with your internal\nvoice\nand that makes you much more capable\nthan the person sitting next to you\nwhat was the conversation that surprised\nyou the most was anyone that not blew\nyour mind but just surprised you with a\nbelief that maybe something you\nheld true but when you spoke to them\nthey they changed your mind on it was\nthere anyone like that that\nchanged your mind on something that you\nthought was very concrete in your life\nor i'm always fascinated by our beliefs\nand how they can shift like\ni've always considered myself to be\nsomeone who it's like i felt like when i\nwas spiritually immature i felt like i\nhad my beliefs and they were the answers\nand then nothing else was true\nyeah what i believed was true and anyone\nelse's answers were completely false\nright and then as i started to grow more\nyou start to realize you know nothing\nand you're like okay i don't know\nanything now because i'm not really sure\nabout any of these beliefs and then you\nget to a point where it's like\nwell i have some values and beliefs they\nwork for me and now i'm willing to trade\nand upgrade\nbased on what i'm exposed to because now\ni learned that\ni need to have a map or a guidebook or a\nrulebook\nthat works because you need that for\nlife yeah but then i hear someone say\nsomething and i'm like\nah like that has just opened up my mind\nin a completely different way\ni think um in addition to that\nwhat happens when you're confronted with\na truth that contravenes your\nyour world view the first thing that it\ndoes is it pushes that cognitive bias\nbutton\nand you're like that can't be right\nbecause this is the way i see the world\nright so you feel the resistance coming\nup so for you to say\noh wow i didn't think of it that way and\nto embrace that\ndifference of opinion or perspective i\nthink is the healthiest thing to do so\nfor me\nit's less about oh here's an example and\nmore about\ntrying to be in that place of of empathy\nand compassion and openness\nand to notice when i feel like my\nresistance creeping up whether it's\nsomebody who has\na different you know nutritional or\ndietary perspective than i do\nor somebody who uh you know\nwas able to get sober and maintain their\nsobriety\nyou know by way of a protocol that is at\nodds with like\nhow i think it should be done you know\nwhat i mean yeah and to just be like\nthe world's a big place the human\ncondition is is multi-varied\nlike i don't have all the answers and to\nbe able to sit with somebody who's\ncoming from a different\nperspective and try to find mutual\nground and meet them\nwhere they're at with compassion and\nwith empathy\ni think is really powerful\nit's something that i'm always\nendeavoring to do with whatever guess\nthat i have on my show\nand i think it's what's sorely lacking\nin our culture right now\nand i think if there's anything that i'm\ntrying to do with my show\nand the example that i set with how i\nconduct my conversations\nis to say look if we want to move\nforward as a healthy culture as a\nhealthy society\nwe have to be able to meet each other in\nour differences\nwith compassion with understanding that\ndoesn't mean that\nwe do it with unhealthy boundaries\nbut we have to be able to have mature\nconversations about our differences\nbecause this polarization and the\nseparation that we're seeing\nand the unhealthy siloing of opinions i\nthink is\nreally polluting and denigrating our\nability to move forward as\na as a healthy society and is deeply\nconcerning to me\nyeah i'm so with you on that i think\nthat's that's a great answer because\nyeah that that lack of judgment and\nopenness and just stopping yourself from\nlike you said letting your\nyour controls creep in that's probably\nthe hardest thing\nright because you've been on a train of\nthought or a school of thought\nsince you were a kid and it's built and\nbuilt and built and it's got you to\nsomewhere which is probably okay\nand then all of a sudden come someone\ncomes and just surprises you with the no\nwhat's been the best way you've found\napart from having conversation on the\npodcast\nhave you found that people are able to\ncreate their openness in their own lives\nis it more travel is it\nwatching things that you wouldn't watch\nlike what have you seen that like how\ncan we encourage that more\nfor people to be okay with exposing\nthemselves to opposing ideas without\nplacing judgment on them\nyeah it's tough i mean i think travel is\na big one right investing in experience\num people who have who have you know\ndone that\ntend to have broader views and\nperspectives and and more open-minded\nare more open-minded about a variety of\nissues than\npeople just stay in one place and have\ntheir news feed\nyeah and even who they follow on their\nnewsfeed because\nthat again if it's diverse you you're\nagain\nmeeting diverse people there too right\nyeah and so i try to have\nyou know certain people on my show that\ni disagree with for that reason\num but it's always tricky too because\nyeah it's like i don't want to\nyou get accused of platforming people\nright and that becomes a whole other\nkind of crazy yeah let's talk about that\nlet's talk about that\ni i get that tons i have uh i'm trying\nto remember when when did i get\nand this is what i find every time i do\nthat everyone who listens is fine with\nit\nyeah it's the people who don't listen\nthat have an issue with it right and so\nlike\ni met her at a meditation conference in\nsan francisco\nand i spoke on stage and i saw her in\nthe audience\nand she listened through every speaker\nthat spoke that day\nbefore she spoke for herself and i was\nquite blown away by that because\nspeakers usually especially if they're\ncelebrities\nshe sat and listened to everyone so i\nwent up to afterwards and i just said\ni really admire the fact that you sat\nthrough everyone's presentations today i\nthink that was\nshe goes yeah i'm just learning and i'm\nreally fascinated by meditation it's\nreally helped me\nin my journey to um work through all the\nchallenges i'm going through and you\nknow she was talking about her book that\nshe released\nand and she was an a new entrant to\nmindfulness and meditation but finding\nso much greatness within it\nthrough therapy and everything and she\nwas like you need to come and tell that\nstory i said to her and she came on\nand it's just so fascinating that when\nyou don't tell that part of the story\nor people don't have that context right\nit's like yeah why would you give her a\nplatform she's gossiping\nyou know all this kind of stuff yeah but\nwe didn't talk about that you know so\nyeah i had an experience like that i had\num john and molly chester on my show\nwho are the farmers behind this\ndocumentary called the biggest little\nfarm\ni don't know if you saw this movie but i\nknow what it is so there's a there's a\nthere's a farm not too far from where i\nlive out in\ncalabasas where they took an arid plot\nof land\nand over a seven eight year period\nturned it into this\nthriving um like organic\nfarm based upon regenerative principles\nand i thought that was an amazing story\nit's a beautiful film\nand these people are not vegan some of\nthe animals that they raise\nare then um they've sold to to slaughter\nright so\ni'm a vegan right and i would like to\nbelieve that if i was in their shoes\nthat i wouldn't make that choice\nbut i'm not them and i think that if we\nwant to move forward in terms of\ntrying to find environmentally\nsustainable solutions for producing food\nthat they're doing something very\ninteresting the yields that they're\ngetting\nfar exceed that of conventional farming\nlike there's a\nthere's a lot to be learned about what\nthey've discovered\nby virtue of tending to the soil\nin a kind of way that you know our\nancestors did\nthat we've lost touch with that i wanted\nto understand better\nand i got criticized of platforming them\nand like these people are\nyou know they're part of the problem\nbecause they're selling animals for food\nand\nunless unless somebody is on your show\nand they're 100 on\non board with your point of view then\nyou're going to get criticized and\nattacked\nyeah and like i have a problem with that\nyou know what i mean like\nyeah we disagree on a certain aspect of\nthis but i also don't walk a mile in\nthese people's shoes\nand just because they're doing one thing\nthat i might not see eye to eye with\ndoesn't mean that that there isn't much\nthat can be learned about other things\nthat they're doing\ntotally yeah that's beautiful i'm really\nhappy to hear that my mind's the same\napproach completely it's i feel exactly\nthe same way because i find like as\nhumans we're so good at that\nsingular judgment it's like if one\nperson is doing\none thing that you don't agree with you\ndon't agree with anything they do\nand and that amplification of judgment\nis is you know\ncan it can be really harsh for us and i\nfall into that trap all the time i\ni make that mistake all the time where\nit's like and we do the opposite too if\nyou like one thing one person does you\nlike everything they do so we\nwe also do it with positives right\nbecause it's simpler i guess for the\nmind to process\nit requires less thought and less\nintelligence\nto either neglect someone based on one\nnegative\nor appreciate someone based on one\npositive it's it's more complicated to\nlook at the gray area so with that\nunderstanding then how does that\ninfluence how you comport yourself on\nsocial media right there's this\nthis um impetus or impulse like when\nsomething is happening there's a wrong\nin the world do you feel like you\nhave a responsibility because you have\nthis audience and this platform to\nvoice your opinion or redress it or\nengage in the dialogue and the arguments\nthat surround it like how do you think\nabout and practice that\nyeah my my focus has always been like\ni'm fascinated by timeless truths\nlike that's that's where i get my\npersonal\nsensibility my personal awareness\neverything comes from things that are\ntimeless so\ni'm not the biggest commentator on world\nevents and i never have been and that's\nnot because\ni'm trying to stay away from them\nbecause i think they're complicated i\nstay away from them because i'm like\nthis is one element of another problem\nanother problem and i'm trying to\naddress the root which i believe is\ntimeless\nas opposed to the symptom that we're\ncurrently seeing that's my\npersonal approach to it i'm not saying\nit's the right approach or the wrong\napproach it's the approach that feels\nmore natural and\nuniquely jay to me to feel like i want\nto address those which are timeless\ntruths their roots behind what is really\nbeing affected\nand speak about those at a very human\nlevel\nand so i've chosen to do that and\nbecause i don't really know\nwhen a news report or anything goes i'm\nnot really even sure if what i'm reading\nis perfect or right or\nso i'm not confident on that so i'd\nrather stick to what i believe i am\nconfident\nright so that's been my approach i'm\nwilling to dive into it but yeah that's\nkind of that's been my way of\naddressing it and i don't feel the need\nto address\nwhat's happening right now because i\nfeel like we also have this obsession of\nwe're going through the worst time or\nthis is the worst this or this is the\nworst that\nand i'm just like well i'm spending a\nlot of time with people who are part of\nthe solution\nand i'm doing something about it and i\nfeel elevated and\num i feel confident that there are\nsolutions out there because i'm spending\ntime with people who are working on the\nsolution\nso i don't really get a lot of joy from\njust talking about what's going wrong\ndoes that make sense yeah i get it yeah\nyeah i think it's i think it's smart i'm\njust interested and\nit's just the truth i don't know if it's\nsmart it's just the truth it's just\nreality i'm just like you know that's\nthat's where because that's the basis of\nwhat i learned and how i was trained and\nalso\nwhat i've been fascinated by because\ni've seen stories change facts change\nthis change that change opinions change\nso i'm like this stuff all is always\nchanging but there are some timeless\ntruths to the roots\nof humanity's issues right like ego\neveryone knows the ego exists everyone\nknows the ego is an issue you can see it\nevery day in every form and i could\ncomment on\neveryone's ego every day in the media\nbut i have ego too and so it's\nit's knowing that and working to the\nroot of how do we remove ego and help\npeople overcome their ego that to me is\nmore fascinating\nfor me yeah i'm not saying that's the\nmost important work in the world i'm\njust saying it's the most important work\nthat i can do\nand i think that was a big thing for me\nand i feel that talking to you like\nfor me becoming uniquely me was being\nvery honest about\nwhat i could do and so i don't see what\ni do as big or small i just see as this\nis what i can do\nand that's uniquely me and that may not\nbe the biggest or the best thing in the\nworld or it may not be the most needed\nthing in the world\nbut this is me and that's my offering\nand yeah you know being okay with that\nyeah i mean i think listen i think if\neverybody was more\nuniquely who they are the world would be\na better place now the counter argument\nto that is like\nlisten somebody's got to take the\ngarbage out and you know there's\nof course i understand all of that but i\nfeel like we\nare living in an epidemic\nor a desert of authenticity in the sense\nthat\neverybody's so disconnected from who\nthey are and we're all reacting to this\nworld and\nplaying this game and trying to be these\ncertain people\nwhether it's you know getting the you\nknow the\nthe fancy car or the good job or the\nright suit or whatever it is\nwe're living for these externalities\nright and the more that we\ninvest in that the less connected we are\nto ourselves\nand to divinity right and to our fellow\nhuman beings\nwe are coming from ego and we're living\nin a this\nthis detached state that i think\nultimately\nis is a disease you know\nand so if there's anything that that i'd\nlike to speak to it's about like that\nreconnection process\nto the extent that we can be more\nconnected to ourselves and to other\nhuman beings and to bring greater\nexpression to that\nthe world then becomes by virtue of that\nbehavior a better place\ncan you have both how and why\nwhat do you mean by like when you're\nsaying like because i feel like\nit's become very that rhetoric's very\ncommon of like\nyou know these material things are\ntaking us away from ourselves\nyet we find that we\nall have desires we all have needs we\nall have likes and dislikes so my\nquestion is\nis there a path to have things and get\nconnected with yourself or are they\nopposites yeah the things are not bad in\nof themselves it's our relationship to\nthem\nthat's what we project upon them and i\nthink\nthe problem arises when what we project\nupon them\nis a sense of identity or contentedness\nor a a crafted identity\nthat is forged through these material\nitems\nor jobs or whatever it is right that\nhelps craft this narrative of identity\nand at the cost of that internal journey\nof like connecting with\nwho you know what what is truly you know\nwhat is our heart\nactually saying yeah and understanding\nthat that that\nwhich which we seek most which is\nconnection happiness contentment\num you know purpose all of these things\ncannot be found through seeking\nin the external world they can only be\nfound through that internal journey\nand our whole culture is crafted around\nthese externalities when in truth\num what we seek most is already in our\npossession\nand it's almost like yeah in the the\nsanskrit word is maya which i'm sure\nyou're\naware of yeah and it's like you look at\nthe it's funny\nyeah and it's so funny how many places i\nit's so funny my friend was here from\nlondon a couple of weeks back\nand he'd never been to la before and i\ntook him to hollywood boulevard just\nto see hollywood and he was just like\nthis is such a letdown\nlike you know it's when you realize what\nhollywood actually is yeah literally and\nit's like you know you have this dream\nof like hollywood's an idea\nyeah exactly right exactly exactly and\nit's and and it's almost like the\nphysical place never lives up to it or\nyou know and you see that with so many\nareas in in reality i remember so many\nplaces i was like you have to get people\nyou have to go to this place and when i\nwent there and i was like oh is this it\nlike really like\nyou know and i think that's almost like\nthe\nthe same feeling of when we finally\nacquire that thing\nit's that same feeling but it's easier\nto say it when you've had the option to\nhave it or had it of course\nand that's the you know that i speak\nthat coming from a very privileged place\ncorrect no and and and what i'm saying\nis that\nhow does someone this the way i had it\nso when i decided to become a monk the\nway it worked for me is i just\nknew people and that wasn't me or my\nfriends or it wasn't my family\ni had been exposed to people who had it\nand genuinely and thankfully\nauthentically expressed their sadness\nand that was the difference maker that\nthe people that i had met that had it\nwhether i saw them in a conference or i\nsaw them at a video\nthey opened up and said that it didn't\nfulfill their needs\nright but here's the difference you had\nthe awareness or the self-awareness\nto recognize that and to take action on\nthat but\nthat truth i think is not a mystery to\nmost people i mean here we are we're in\nthe hollywood hills you look out here\nthere's\nlots of fancy houses lots of fancy\npeople and fancy cars\nand in this town you can't go a day\nwithout meeting somebody who's very well\nto do\nand yet also very unhappy right it's\nit is it's in the atmosphere of this\ncity\num and most people will think well he\njust needs to get the next car or the\nnext job or when you have that\nexperience yourself and you get the\nthing that you've been aiming for and\nthen you have a momentary sense of\nglee or relief you realize how quickly\nit fades\ninstead of saying well maybe uh that\nwhich i see\ncannot be found in the external world\ninstead you think\nyeah but you know now i just need to get\nthe new jaguar\nor the next job or what you know it's\nalways it's that it's that like\nyou know chasing the dragon thing that i\nthink most people do all the way to\ntheir grave\nand that's the great tragedy of course\nso for you\nat a young age to be to have the\nself-awareness the cognizance to\nrecognize that and take a contrary path\ni think is\nis unique yeah and i i owe it to just\nmeeting amazing people when i was young\nand i think that's the biggest challenge\nnow and what i'm trying to solve it\nthrough my podcast and even like this\nlike\ni just feel that if you're not exposed\nto alternative\nalternative methodologies and pathways\nthen you can never\nhave that option so i would never have\nchosen the path that i did\nif i wasn't exposed to it and today\nwe're exposed to a finite number there\nwas no on purpose\npodcast when you were trying to make\nthat decision and that's the thing like\ni remember\nbeing in co i was at this you know look\ni went to one of the best colleges in\nthe world\nabsolutely i remember like when i was a\nsenior thinking like what am i going to\ndo\nlike i i had been a swimmer my whole\nlife and now i'm\nfaced with the prospect of trying to\nfigure out what i wanted my career to be\nand i was baffled and i remember going\nto the the the\nthe um the career office or whatever\nlike the building where i was like\nand they were like they were like yeah\nthey were like brochures for consulting\ncompanies and investment banks yeah of\ncourse\nand i was like yeah this is it there was\ni mean i you know look this was 1988\nthere was no internet or anything like\nthat um there was\nthe resources that are now available to\nyoung people to help make\nthese kinds of decisions and and that\nthe variety of experiences and\npossibilities that they're exposed to\nyou know just would have been\nmind-blowing to me at that time\nwhat what's been your you you've\nmentioned your wife\na bunch of times throughout this\ninterview as being such an important\npart of your spiritual journey what's\nbeen amazing\nfor both of you together on this\nspiritual journey what have been some of\nthe\nshared experiences or practices or\nmethods in which you've both\nuh learned together yeah i mean together\nit's been an incredible\nuh partnership i mean there were so many\ntimes when\ni just thought i was a crazy person like\ni was\nnot practicing law not bringing in money\nout on my bike all day cars getting\nrepossessed like we couldn't\npay even the smallest bills that we have\nit was very humiliating and emasculating\nand i remember being at my breaking\npoint more than once\nand going to julian saying this is\nridiculous we have kids i got\nlike i can't pay the bill like i need to\ngo back to doing what i was doing before\nand she would say\nno like we already know where that path\nleads\ni don't know where this path that you're\non now is going to lead but i know that\nthe answers that you seek and the\nresolution\nthat we need ultimately will be found\nthrough continuing along this way\nlike you need to you need to do this now\nthat is extraordinary and exceptional\nbecause most partners would say\nwhat are you doing that crazy person\nlike i'm gonna divorce you\nyeah exactly unless you get together\nright and for her to have that kind of\nfortitude and that kind of\nfaith to have my back like\ni mean who gets that you know what i\nmean like\nwhat an incredible thing to have and she\nwas right by the way you know\ndefinitely so i mean it didn't it took a\nlong time\nit wasn't on my timetable yeah and it\nwas premised on this idea of like\nwhen the heart is true the universe will\nconspire to support you and\nthat's that's been a truism in my life\nbut\nuh sometimes it takes a little bit\nlonger than you would like it to\nalways i feel yeah always what are the\nhabits that you think though that\nso some people may be listening going\nwow you're so lucky rich you've got a\nwife it's amazing and people often say\nthat to me as well my wife is very\nsupportive and amazing\nbut what did what do you think you did\nmaybe early on in the relationship\nhowever you continue to communicate\neither what did you do before\nthat moment that you feel built such a\nstrong bond with your wife\nthat she had that belief and faith in\nyou and that you had that for each other\nif anything and maybe nothing and\nafterwards what have you done to\nreciprocate with that love so she knows\nthat it wasn't\nnot just that you've solved your life\nbecause that's not necessarily\nreciprocation that's just\nwhat you believe what have you done to\nreciprocate and and\nshare that journey with her as a way of\nsaying\ni'm so grateful you did this yeah that's\na great question\ni mean to the first part of the question\ni definitely\nyou know married above my weight class\nso we do i don't know\nwhat to tell anyone you know like i\ndon't know what advice is in there\nrather than like\num you know try to do that i guess i\nmean\nlisten you know my wife is an incredibly\nstrong person and\nand i and that was what attracted me to\nher like she just\nhad a sense about herself like she she\nyou know what i mean and i think it's\nit's pretty cool so\nso i needed that energy in my life and\nthat has you know benefited my\ntrajectory in terms of how i pay it back\nand\nhonor her for that i mean that's a\npractice just like anything else\nshe's just recently started this new\nbusiness uh plant-based cheese business\nso\nit's now about me showing up for her in\nthat regard and supporting her\num you know she's written these\ncookbooks like i think there's something\nabout our partnership where\nwe can come together and one plus one is\nis definitely larger than two where we\ncan co-create\nand make beautiful things together but\nwe also respect each other's\num individuality and independence like\nwe're not relying upon each other to\ncomplete ourselves\nyou know what i mean like like she can\ngo and do her thing and i can go do my\nthing\nand and it's all good we don't we don't\nwe\nwe're not like we don't have like a\nporous boundary in that regard like we\nrespect each other's\num respective fife dumbs and\nbut then we can come together and and do\nthings cool how did you mean\nin yoga class nice okay yeah i was um\ni was newly sober i was right out of\nrehab\ni was in rehab for 100 days in oregon\ngot out of rehab\nconfused but understanding that i needed\nto\ndo things differently i needed a new\npeer group social group\ni needed healthy activities to keep me\nout of the bars and the clubs\nand i found my way to a yoga studio\nin west la and i just i went every day\nand uh\nand met a whole new group of friends and\npeople that became my social circle\nso i'd known her for quite some time\nlong before\nwe dated but i did a year of celibacy\nout of\nmy first year of sobriety was celibate\num\nand that was a very profound powerful\nexperience that i would highly recommend\nto anybody\nand it was informed you know in large\npart because\nmy relationships with the opposite sex\nwas\nvery intertwined in an unhealthy way\nwith drinking and using\nand i had to disentangle that and get\nclarity so that i could\nbecome more self-actualized to be\nthe kind of person that i would want to\nbe in a relationship with\nso that was incredibly profound and\nthen um i met you you know basically i\nmet julie on the tail end of that one\nyear\nand i've been with her ever since so did\nyou ever ask of what she saw in you at\nthat time that\nshe was um she was coming out of a\ndivorce so\nthere was never a sense like oh we're\ngonna be together like i thought\nmy next girlfriend i was coming out of a\nreally awful relationship situation and\ni thought\nmy next relationship is going to be with\nsomebody who's younger than me who\ndoesn't have a lot of baggage and it's\ngoing to be very simple\nand i met julie who was older than me\nhad two sons and was getting divorced\nyou know the heart wants what the heart\nwants yeah um i don't think either of us\nwas really in a great\nplace to be in a long-term relationship\nall of a sudden\nbut sometimes that's the way these\nthings work out and yeah we've been\ntogether for\n20 years over 20 years it's amazing i\nlook forward to meeting you\nwhat was that what was that one year of\ncelibacy like what was the toughest\npart of that year and how did you how\ndid you even get the idea or the resolve\nthat that was going to be the antidote\nto the experience you were having with\nwomen and alcohol when i was in\ntreatment i was very aware that i'd\nreached a sort of nadir in my in my life\nyou know i always thought of myself as\nthis\nsmart ambitious upwardly mobile person i\ngotten in all these i had all the\nstuff you know the resume stuff to make\nme look good\num and yet here i was this seemingly\nintelligent person who\nfound himself in a mental institution so\nmy best thinking\nlanded me in a place that i never\nthought i would be\nand that was a profound reality and\nrealization\nthat i had to take to heart and what\nthat did was it created a willingness in\nme\nto receive help from other people i\nnever wanted to ask for help let alone\nreceive it but i was in a\nin a in a in a place of great\nwillingness to do that and it was\nimpressed upon me that uh that my\nrelationships with women\nwere dysfunctional and unhealthy and i\nneeded to\nrelearn how to do that and i was told\nthat this would be a good way to do it\ncelibacy and i i was in a place of just\nsaying yes like yeah just trying\nyou tell me if you're telling me that\nthis will make me better then i will do\nthat\nrather than well how's that going to\nhelp you know like questioning it that's\nwhat kept me drunk for a long time\num so i just decided i was going to say\nyes to all of these things and that was\none of them and\nit was difficult and what you realize is\nis how much you\nor at least i can only speak from my own\nexperience but the extent to which\ni was using relationships to medicate\nmyself in the same way i was using drugs\nand alcohol\nif i felt uncomfortable or um\nin a state of dis ease\ni could seek validation or\ndistract myself through the opposite sex\nin the same way a drink or a drug would\ndo that and i think just\nunderstanding that helped me like\nunclutch or detach from\nthat dynamic in a way that helped me\nthen figure out a better healthier way\nfor having that interaction and i think\nwhen you say listen i'm not dating i'm\nnot having sex i'm like i'm\ncelibate for a year it's incredibly like\nit's a very powerful thing because then\nit it strips away like basically it\nremoves\nall of the the kind of manipulation and\nego that goes into\nevery interaction that you have with the\nopposite sex and makes you very aware of\nhow much you do that\num and also it's like you're standing in\nyour power because you don't need\nanything from another human being\nand i think that helps you um reframe\nall of it and i would like i said like i\nwould highlight\nyeah anybody who's who's challenged in\ntheir relationships to explore that in\nthemselves\ni love hearing that from you because i\nliterally just in my book i i\nwrite about being celibate for three\nyears and i was i was\ntrying to figure out how to explain it\nand express it in a way that\ni felt people will be able to understand\nwhat was truly achieved from it\nand and it's funny because in my\nliterally my book i literally wrote\nabout how\none of these definitions of the monk\nterm brahmacaria\nin sanskrit is right use of energy and\nit talks about the amount of\nenergy that is wasted on the ego\nimpressing\nthe manipulation sometimes or the\ncoercing of the\nopposite or same sex and and how much of\nthat\ntime and energy and mental space saved\nright is so powerful for creativity and\nwisdom and insight\nand spiritual revelation yeah and so\nyeah it's good hearing you say it gives\nme\nit gives me even more affirmation and\nyou just you become very aware like you\nnotice\nlike oh like i'm feeling like i want to\ndo this but i'm not going to do\nlike you you just create there's a lot\nof self-awareness that yeah that comes\nas a result of that practice\ni love it yeah all right man we're in\nthe last two segments of today's podcast\nso we've got fill in the blanks which is\na\nnew edition that we've started so i'm\ngonna say this you gotta finish the\nsentences\nso fitness was always a spiritual\npractice\nnice i like what it feels like to\nbe who i am nice changing your path\ncan set you free or imprison you\nnice running the rat race will\nlead to your demise okay i work towards\ngreater self-actualization and service\nsocial constructs\nare illusions\nnice okay so these are your final five\nyou have to answer in one word to one\nsentence maximum\nso your final five the first question is\nwhat have you been chasing in your life\nthat you no longer pursue\nbefore i answer that i have to say yeah\ntell us i wish i could tell you like all\nthe ego stuff you know what i mean but\ni'm still like you know i'm still the\nsame schmuck\nyou know what i mean i'm ambitious i'm\ndriven by my ego and my\nimpulses like i've worked so hard to try\nto transcend these things but\nthey're they're still there you know\nwhat i mean like so i can't\ni can't say oh like you know i'm in this\nbeautiful place where\ni'm not i'm not hamstrung by my you know\ninnate\nhuman impulses yeah well one thing that\nhelped me with that and still helps me\nwith that is\nthe amount of time you entertain it\nright so i feel like as time has gone on\nall i've been able to do is\nlimit and shorten the amount of time i\nhave to entertain but it's still there\nso what's the question again\nwhat have you been chasing in your life\nthat you no longer pursue there must be\nsomething\nlike i said like i'd love to say like oh\nexternal validation\nbut i still like i still like live for\nthat that's a great answer you know what\ni mean better than any other you could\nhave given me i prefer this answer yeah\nit's a great answer should it be honest\ni love it i think it's a great answer\nhow do you know when you are\nnot following your intuition or you're\ngoing against your intuition how do you\nknow personally\nif you're relatively connected to\nyourself you can feel that dissonance\nhow does it feel like it feels like it\nfeels like a dis-ease it feels\nlike a like a slow creeping anxiety\nlike when your actions are not aligned\nwith your values you know\nand i think if you though if you\ncontinue to deny it then the universe\nmakes it known to you it starts knocking\nand then it knocks louder and then it\nlocks and you know it's like hey rich\nmaybe you should stop drinking\nyou know yeah year two year three year\nfour then the cops get involved and then\nyou know\nyeah question number three\nif if you could create a law for\neveryone in the world to follow what\nwould it be\ni really do think the most important\nthing is to is to\ncultivate self-love because\nthat's the foundation upon which\nall good things will come beautiful\nquestion number four\nwhat is your best parenting advice if\nyou have if you have a piece of advice\noh there's so many i mean one thing i\nwould say is\nyour job is to love your kids\nit's not their job to love you nice\nthat's there's a lot packed into that\nand there's a lot of connecting that's\nawesome i can just leave it yeah leave\nit there\nwe'll have to go into that part okay\nfifth and final question of the final\nfive\nwhat is the greatest lesson you've\nlearned in the last 12 months\nhas really been impressed upon me is the\nsheer impermanence of everything like at\n53 now i'm starting to confront my\nmortality in a way that i that i didn't\nin my 40s\nand when we see kind of the fragility of\nsocial structures\nout there and now we're dealing with\nenvironmental crises and the coronavirus\nand all of these things like\nwe tend to think like we're in a\npost-history world\nwe're just not and as i age and confront\nmy own mortality\nand see the impermanence of\neverything out in the world you realize\nhow\num not meaningless but how\nunimportant most of the things are that\nwe concern ourselves with on a daily\nbasis\namazing thank you rich thank you\nfantastic\namazing thank you so much yeah this is a\nbrilliant conversation
