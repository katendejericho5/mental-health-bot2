it's amazing to have you here man i\nremember when\ni was in london i i went back to see my\nparents\nand my sister and my in-laws because i\nhadn't seen them in over a year\nand we were talking on the phone and i\nwas literally like in between i think i\njust got like\ni think i just like had a quick meeting\nwith someone in london or something like\nthat and i was i was just driving\nand as you were just telling me just\nbefore this it was around 5am in l.a\nso it was about what's that like\nit's about 1pm in london and\nwe're talking about something completely\ndifferent and then all of a sudden you\nstart\nsharing insights from your journey and\nit was one of those moments\nwhere everything you said just\npenetrated straight through\nto my heart and i like stopped\nthe car because i was speaking to you on\nspeakerphone i stopped the car\nand i just made a decision i was like i\nhave to have him on the podcast and he\nneeds to share this story\nbecause there's something about that\nmoment where i just almost felt called\nthat there was a reason that we'd\nconnected i think we connected two years\nago now one and a half years ago\nsomething like that and then it all kind\nof became reality where i was like\nokay this story needs to be told and i'd\nflick through your book before since i\nhad it\nand then when i got back here i started\nlooking more into the book i started\nwatching interviews with you and\npodcasts that you've done\nand i'm just so excited that we get to\nshare that on on purpose today so\nthank you man thank you for making the\ntime thank you for\nbeing a dear friend and supporter of the\npodcast\nfor two years or more and uh thank you\nfor showing up today\ni know you're ready to share so thank\nyou again thanks for having me amanda\nlike i told you on that phone call we're\ngonna\nwe're gonna touch and change and save a\nlot of lives today i can guarantee that\nyeah i mean that just just hearing that\ngives me shivers i'm just like that's\nthat like just feels so good that that's\nthe aim of what we're trying to do here\nbut\nlet's start with your childhood i want\nto hear about what was darren like\nas a kid uh what were the things that\nexcited you what were the things you\nwere insecure\nabout what were the things that you\nloved uh what was your experience\ngrowing up so i grew up in livingston\nnew jersey great loving mom and\ndad a sister that i'm close with to this\nday\nand you know i had a lot of friends boys\nand girls and you would have thought\neverything from the outside was okay but\nit just wasn't i was\ncrippled with anxiety\nno security or self-worth i was always\nput in small classrooms and told i was\ndumb or stupid or learning disabled\nand i just know by not speaking up\nthat's what eventually led me down the\npath that it led me down to\nas far as hobbies you know i was\nathletic i was\nincredibly obsessed with baseball cards\nwhich\nby the time i was 14 turned out to be a\ntremendous blessing because i started a\nmulti-million dollar company in 1984\nwhich uh you know all of a sudden the\ndumb stupid kid was the smart brilliant\none making a ton of money\nand um but again i look back at that\ntime and by by not speaking up\nfor the inadequates the insecurities the\nfeeling of less than\nuh never fitting in that's why i'm so\npassionate about what i do today\nespecially with the teams because if i\ncould go back in a time machine i would\nhave\naddressed you know certain people that\ncould have helped me what was it\nspecifically at the time that made you\nfeel like you didn't fit in what was\nthat\nanxiety that was crippling you where was\nit coming from what was the root of it\ni think i think you know i grew up a\nmama's boy um my mom\ndefinitely overwhelmed me with love you\nknow i don't think i had it in between\nand uh just being away from her my dad\nwas always like a safety net for me\nso anytime i wasn't around them and\naround different groups of people i\ni just never fit in i i was uh had\nimposter syndrome since the time i was\nprobably this big\nand i never really could put my pulse on\nit why it was just that way it was\nthat was just it and i never spoke up i\nkept it all inside what's incredible\nabout that is you\nyou talked about imposter syndrome and\nthen you go on to develop and we'll talk\nabout the journey but you're going to\ndevelop this\nincredible career as a celebrity and\nsports management\nagent and manager and your own company\nthe prince group\nand you're working alongside i mean the\nbiggest\nicons in the world did that imposter\nsyndrome\nstay did it change did it ever feel like\nit went away because now you had\nachieved something or did it\nget deeper where did it go it got deeper\nbecause i believed\nall the bull crap i believe the super\nagent the\nwow look at muhammad ali joe frazier\nevil knievel pamela and or saint magic\nlike it just the list was endless but\nagain that core which i told you about\non the phone call\nwas so badly broken that spirit inside\nof me was\nslowly going off the deep end until\nobviously i hit my bottom which we can\nget into later\nand um i just believed it all and i\nneeded people to think that darren\nprince arrived i needed that\nlittle kid in the back of the room that\nwas in special ed that was told he was\nno good that wouldn't go anywhere i\nneeded the world to\nthink that wow darren prince is the most\nsuccessful person in our school darren\nprince is doing unbelievable he's on\nprivate jet\nsuper bowls backstage for the biggest\nconcerts award shows saying\ni needed all of it because that gave me\nthe validation that i was missing as a\nchild\nit's crazy isn't it like i feel like\nwhen i hear that\nthat's such a big part of everyone's\nstory where we all end up seeking\nvalidation or acknowledgement or\nrecognition\nfor how we what we didn't receive as a\nkid\nthe difference was that you were\nactually at the top\ndoing it yeah you are actually doing it\nlike that's my point that i think we all\nseek it from from different things in\nour whole journey but you'd actually got\nthere\nbut it's crazy you're you're there but\nyou're still looking for validation from\nthe people who are\nlooking up going oh my gosh he did it\nhow did he do it\nuh that must be a really\nunique experience and journey how many\nof the people that you\nwent to school with or grew up around\nwere on similar career trajectories or\nexperiencing what you were there's\nnobody but we do have\njason alexander and chelsea handler that\ncame out of my high school so they did\npretty well for themselves too\nfortunately i don't think either one of\nthem had substantive issues like i did\nbut they're\nthey've done uh remarkably well and i i\ntruly don't know\nmany individuals in that position\nbecause\nnormally it's spoken mirrors yeah you\nknow you're you're posting now about\nthis life you're\nverbalizing about it and um you're not\nreally living it\nyou need people to think you want people\nto think you've arrived\nat the top yeah we've had chelsea on the\npodcast too so\nit's uh when i hear you say that though\ni think that experience is shared by by\nso many of us\nand that's why i'm so glad that we're\ngetting to talk because\nwhat i love about your journey is that\ndespite having all this success\nyou then decide to write a book which\nhas got nothing to do with becoming\nsuccessful\nfrom the external sense but really\nbecoming successful from an internal\nspace\ntell me about the day or the journey\nwhere you started to realize\nthat you had an addiction because this\nis\nwhat the core pillar of your work and\nwhen you shared your story with me on\nthe phone that day\ni was just like everyone in the world\nhas a\naddiction some people have an addiction\nto sugar some people have an addiction\nto their smartphones some people have an\naddiction to alcohol\nsome people have an addiction to\nvalidation like\nwe all have an addiction everyone is\nlistening or watching right now\nthere's no one who's free of an\naddiction\nand so when i read your story and hear\nyour story\nof recovery from addiction even though\nyour addiction was\nextremely deep and in the more in the\nsense that people would more\nwith an addiction i think it's a journey\nthat all of us need to go on\nso so tell us about when you first were\nable to\nrealize and recognize that you had an\naddiction so\ni started prince marketing group when i\nwas 24 and magic johnson became my first\nclient\nand i like to say what was once living\nto use turned out to using to live\ni don't know when it turned on me but\nfor the first five or six years i was a\nrock star i really was on the plane\nnetworking my butt off\nbuilding the agency magic told me\nspecifically you got to use me to knock\ndown every door to build your agency\nbecause\nit's not how successful i become it's\nhow successful i make you and everybody\nelse around me that's what life's about\ni was like well i got the opportunity to\nexploit him and get on the phone with\ndifferent celebrities and\nit probably was i would say around 2002\nwhich was my pinnacle moment of my\ncareer in the book and i'm going to\nmention it now because last monday was\nthe 50th anniversary\nof ollie frazier the most incredible\nspectacle sporting event\nof all time historically culturally the\nvietnam war stopped that night on march\n8th 71 and\ni spent six years with my dear friend\nharlan warner who's muhammad's agent\nbrought me into the ollie team\nto get these two regal icons together\nand the opportunity happened in 2002 for\nnba all-star weekend\nand i got a call from lonnie and she's\nlike muhammad and i would like you and\njoe\nand jose marvis to come to dinner and\nmuhammad sweet tonight and\ni just i was losing my mind this\nhistorical\nopportunity behind closed doors to see\nthem finally make peace with each other\nand hug and embrace and where world\nleaders anybody would have just done\nanything been in that moment\nwell jay an hour before i went to get\njoe\ni'm in my hotel room storing percocets\nand oxycontins and vicodins\nbecause that eight-year-old kid that\nten-year-old kid\nwith a severe learning disability did\nnot deserve to be\nthere and had no idea how to be there\npresent in the moment and take in this\nexperience\nthat would blow anybody away and the\nfact that joe and muhammad\nloved and respected me more than i\nrespected myself\nthat's when i realized i was like this\nis getting really bad i don't know how\nmuch longer i can keep this up\ni mean even just listening to you shared\nthat\ni can hear from you and your voice how\nlike how present you are with it now\nlike you know just how how like present\nyou are within now in that moment\nand and in this moment yeah and which is\nbeautiful to see\nand the smile you have on your face\nright now as well if anyone is listening\nif you're listening and not watching\nlike darren has the best smile on his\nface\nit's incredible to think that what you\njust said that they\nrespected you more than you respected\nyourself they believed in you\nmore than you believed in yourself tell\nus about where do you think\nthat addiction start uh through your\njourney and for others because i think\nwhat ends up happening is you have a\nmoment like the one you just said\nwhere it kind of hits you and we go oh i\nget it\nthe penny drops but where does it start\nbecause it almost seems like\nit almost seems like it starts so small\nand\nnaive and a bit complacent and and then\nall of a sudden\nit's it's cascaded to this how does it\nstart where did\nso for me it started at 14 i was in\nsleep away camp in massachusetts and i\nhad terrible stomach pains one night\ni asked the counselor to take me to see\nthe nurse she gave me this clear cough\nsyrup cup with this green liquid in it\nand well it tasted disgusting but the\nmost amazing thing about that\nwas five minutes later i'm walking\nacross the softball field with the\ncounter back to the bunk\nand i felt like superman every\ninadequacy we just talked about\ninsecurity feeling of less than not\nfeeling a part of the anxiety\nwent away like that i got back to the\nbunk now i'm the cool kid the buff kid\nthe funny one\nnever had the courage to do this in my\nlife i knocked in the bunk next to us\nand started flirting with girls at 14\nyears old\ni didn't think anything of it i just\nknew whatever that was i needed this\nfeeling 24 7 365 days a year\ngot up the next morning thought nothing\nof it did all our activities softball\nsoccer\nand i'm in the bunk that next night and\nlooking up at the sky\nthinking wow that feeling was amazing\nand i learned how to lie in con in that\nmoment i heal over the council runs over\nbecause you're okay down i said\noh man we got to go back to the counter\nmy stomach just killed him and i started\nshaking and\ni knew right then that that this was\nsomething i needed\nand i did this for three straight weeks\nstraight every single night to mom and\ndad came for visitation day\nand found that i was taking liquid\ndemerol\ndid you know at that time what you were\ntaking or was it just\nthe feeling that you wanted was the\nnurse or the person you gave it to\naware of what they gave you and had\nexposed you to like what was the\nwhat was the situation from an adult\nperspective of what we're doing with\nthis fortunately so\nso i don't think uh the opiate epidemic\nwas nowhere near as rampant back then in\n1984 as it is now i don't blame the\nnurse because i can get it to plenty of\nother situations that i found when i\nneeded\num but you're not going to tell a 14\nyear old kid\nyou can't take that again my my whole\nworld got changed\nin that very moment nobody was telling\nme that you know you can't do this\nand case in point three months later i'm\nback home i had my wisdom teeth removed\nand i come back from the dentist and uh\nmy mom gives me these two white pills i\nhave no idea what they were\ni'm freaking flying i'm zooted now my\nbusiness is starting i'm starting to\nmake money i'm on the phone\ncalling up everybody the cool one the\none that everybody's looking at the\nsmart\none with all the great business ideas\nand um\ntwo days later the pills were gone\nfreaking devastated\ni was crushed i had no idea i was gonna\nget more of these\nbeautiful white pills that just made me\nfeel like i was floating and flying\nand uh same thing go downstairs i put\nthe crocodile tears on i said mom\nmy tooth is killing me we gotta go back\nto the dentist i think of a horrible\ninfection and\nas a loving mother who wants to see\ntheir child suffer\nshe took the bait and took him back to\nthe dentist next day crocodile tears and\nall\nthree more days of the pills that i\nfound that were extra strength vicodin\nthat's insane like it's incredible to\nhear just\nyou know the fact that all of this was\njust so readily available\nto teenagers kids and like you said like\nthere was just not an awareness\nlike there wasn't the the education and\nand then once you're addicted or once\nyou're\nstrapped for that it just\nwhat is what do you think and i want to\ndo this at every stage with your journey\nbecause i know you speak to a lot of\nleaders you speak to\na lot of parents and you speak to\nteenagers what's the equivalent right\nnow for\nteenagers that you see being the\nchallenge\nso that's the challenge that you were\nfacing and your generation was chasing\nwhat\nfacing what is the generation today\nfacing where is their\naddiction what is it that they are\nexposed to that you think parents or\nothers may not be aware of the negative\neffects well i mean i know there's\nfentanyl out there you hear about all\nthe\nthe hard stories of somebody just\ntouching it\nbut i think it's deeper than i don't\nthink it's substances and i'm going to\ngive a shout out to\nmy amazing ex fiance priscilla kizo over\nthere because we had a talk a few years\nago\nand she came up with something that was\ngenius and i remember when i was at the\nwhite house i mentioned this to\nkellyanne conway that\nwe need a course in grammar school in\nhigh school and self-worth\nwe need children to be able to have the\ncourage to speak up\nso you don't become like darren prince\nbecause by all right i should not be\nsitting here\nwith you i had several overdoses i\nshould have been dead many many years\nago\nand if i knew there was a course where\nthe jocks and the nerds and everybody\nelse could actually get along for that\none hour or two\nand put your hands up comfortably and\nspeak to a teacher or have a private\nsession with the guidance\ncounselor would have changed my life\nyeah would it change my life that's what\ni think\nthe big underlining root issue is\neverybody with the social media and\nwho's better looking who's more athletic\nwhat family has more money\nwho has bigger better opportunities you\nknow you fail a test one day like i used\nto every other week you go home with a\nbroken self-esteem you feel freaking\nworthless\nyou know have the ability to call a\nteacher or go to a guide and contribute\nand say i'm not really feeling good\nabout myself\ni worked my butt off on this test and i\ngot a d\nlet them work on you let them work on\nthat inside\nbecause if i had that like i said i i\ngotta believe there's no way i would\nhave gone down the road that i went to\nbut i don't regret any of it\nmy life worked out perfectly you know so\nbut my mission now is not just with\nadults and\ncorporations and everybody speak to my\nbiggest passion is the teens because i\nhave had some of the most amazing\ngod moments with some of these kids\nthree thousand in an audience and one\nputs their hands up\nand had the courage to speak up to me in\nfront of three thousand kids and said\nhe's\nhe he's he's acting out he's doing some\nvery bad things and uh drug wise and\nalcohol-wise but because of your message\nmr princeton because of your speech\ni'm here to tell myself greatest feeling\nin the world\nit's moments like that doing esteemable\nacts\nthat have given darren prince\nself-esteem that he was looking for his\nwhole life\nit never came from magic johnson\nrespectfully hulk\nor muhammad ali it's being of service um\ni i love that how it's it's always\nyour pain or the challenges that you go\nthrough that become your\nyou know your your purpose and your\ngrowth because\nit's it's like you have to use the same\nthing that\nbroke you to help others have\nbreakthroughs exactly and to help others\nhave that moment where that kid i mean i\ncan't imagine what that kid\nhow deeply moved he would have been by\nyou to be able to put up his hand was it\na guy\nto put up his hand to share that in\nfront of his\npeers but see here's the thing let's go\nback again you're now developing\na confidence a false confidence\nbased on what you're taking and now you\nlove being in that high\nbecause that's where you're talking to\nthe girls like now you've got the\nbusiness ideas like\nyou're seeing all this happen so it's\nalmost like you're falling in love\nwith a false version of yourself\nuh and and it's not falling in love it's\nmore like just\nfalling for a falling for a version of\nyourself\nthat is being created i mean when i was\nreading and listening to your story now\ni'm like that's like the real life\nlimitless\nlike the the movie with bradley cooper\nwhen he's taking pills and just\nhe feels like a new man and you know now\nhe can't live without it\nhow do you go from and\nand i'm not asking you to answer this\nquestion in one go because it's a big\nquestion but\nthe hardest part about what you've done\nand i know this from just the few\ninteractions we've had so\nyou know i know we've got people in the\nroom today who are closer to you than\npatrick and you know my dear friend\nabsolutely yeah and you've got people in\nthe room who are closer to you\nuh every time i've seen you you've been\nwith patrick's you guys are always\ntogether\nuh you know you've got people in the\nroom that know you so deeply\nuh far more deeply of course than i know\nyou but what i find\nthe most amazing thing is you've gone\nfrom being someone\nwho was falling for their false self\nto now building love for yourself\nright in the process of building over\nalways developing\nwhere does that journey start to how do\nyou even get to the point where you're\nlike\ni can disconnect from this\nfalse identity i've created which\nactually is giving me everything i want\nbecause i'm sure your confidence gets\nattached to that feeling\nyeah how do you even get the courage to\nsay\nthis isn't confidence this is false\nso i think we're probably going to get\nto my bottom moment is what you're\nasking\ni um i was at the jumping off point\nsuicidal\ni had the life i had the money the\nnotoriety\nthe top of the industry but it was so\nincredibly broken\nand i was so sick of the double life and\num\nwent to an addiction psychiatrist told\nhim what was going on he put me on\nsuboxone which was an opiate blocker\nbut i lied to him too i was snorting\nambien before i went to bed at night i\nwas\ndrinking still a couple days a week i\nwas on a mood stabilizer antidepressant\nand anxiety pills and um i i was just a\nshell\nof myself and my uncle and his\nthen-girlfriend andrea\nwere my god moment they were visiting\nfrom florida they were both in recovery\nin the 12-step fellowship of a a na and\nthey paid a surprise visit on july 1st\n2008 and i never met her before jay but\nshe walked in\nand surprised me and said are you okay\nand\ni said no i'm not she because you don't\nlook okay what's wrong\nand i told her i had accountability for\nthe first time my life i told her\neverything\nand she looked at me she goes do you\nrealize you're an addict at your life's\nunmanageable i said yes because do you\nrealize that you're powerless\nover this and you have a disease i said\nyes she goes let me ask you the most\nimportant thing\ndo you realize that it doesn't matter if\nyou're from park avenue or park bench or\nyale\nor jail that the disease of addiction\ndoes not discriminate\nand that broke my soul and i started to\njust break down and cry\ni said yeah she because you want to do\nanything it takes them like anything\nshe's going to put you on a detox plan\non that 36 hour was that next night at 7\n00 p.m july 2nd 2008 and i came back\nfrom the gym i was married at the time\ni'm shaking when i got back to my\napartment and vomiting\njust all the wonderful detox feelings\nthat come along with\nthat nightmare and i called them up i\nsaid i can't freaking do this\ni'm calling the freaking doctor to get\nwhat i really need to get and they said\nit's the damn disease there and talking\nyou gotta go online\nyou have to find yourself a 12-step\nmeeting put your damn ego aside already\nand surrender\ni said i can't do it i've been to those\nstupid meetings i can't identify with\nthese people i hung up the phone ran\ninto the bathroom\nand uh my my damn wife thought i was\ngoing to kill myself because she was a\npart of other overdoses and hysterically\ncrying banging on the door and\ngoing for all the medicine camp to take\na non-narcotic anxiety pill and\nout came two vicodins which\nat the time actually seemed like a gift\nbecause now i had 36 hours clean for the\nfirst time my adult life but\ni needed it and the miracle happened\nbecause i felt on my knees and i shouted\nout to god like i never did before in my\nlife\nand i love the fact that the emotions\nare still so raw and i said god i can't\ndo this\ni said i'm begging you just take the\nchains off of me\nwhatever it takes take the money take\nthe notoriety\nbecause i can't do this without you and\nbroken\non the floor crying shaking trembling\nhe hurt me because i had this amazing\nsensation of this burning feeling over\nthe shoulder\nand in my goodyear you know death on my\nleft i heard i've got you when you're\nready\nand i had a white light moment because i\nstood up it wasn't me i flushed the\npills\ni went into the living room and i found\na 12-step meeting i'm an attacks he kept\nhis before uber\ni'm looking up at this beautiful night\nof july 2nd 2008 saying oh my god for\nthe first time in my life i wanted to\nstay sober\nmore than i wanted to get high and i\nwalked into a church basement in the\nupper 80s\nwith about 150 to 200 people and i heard\nthe leader says anybody\nknew coming back or needing help\nwith no ego this hand i believe it was\ngod that lifted it\nbecause the so-called super agent was a\nfraud\nthis guy couldn't go five minutes ten\nminutes without getting high\nand these people there was about a dozen\nthat came over to me spiritual brothers\nand sisters who were all once of a\nhopeless state of mind\nshowed me love support hugged me\nthey taught me so many things during\nthat hour that for the first time in my\nlife i felt a part of something\nand again it wasn't the celebrities it\nwas these individuals\nthat were once so badly broken that\nslowly showed darren prince had to be\nthe five a's as i called him action\nattitude adjustment accountability and\nacceptance\nand i put him into up here i put him\ninto my heart\ni put him into my soul and one day at a\ntime\nthis guy started becoming whole and the\nbiggest gift is\nrealizing once you have that foundation\nonce you sort of know that you're in a\nplace of safety\navoiding people places and things you\nwant to keep this gift you better give\nit away to other people\nthank you for sharing that man i mean\nyou're more present than\never like just just the way it's coming\nthrough you right now is\nis really special and i'm sure anyone\nwho's\nlistening or watching right now can hear\nit and see it and\nexperience it through you and\nexperiencing god through you\nin that moment and experiencing that\nmoment of\nrevelation through you as well because\nthat's what we all need\nuh so thank you for showing up in that\nway and\nand letting it come through you that way\nbut\nwhen we look at addiction\ntoday unfortunately\nwe don't really understand it\ni think if you've not been through it\nyou don't really understand it we can be\nempathetic and compassionate\nand be loving towards someone but we\ncan't\nwrap our head around it if we've not\nexperienced it\nwhat does it feel like to be addicted to\nhave an\noverdose how does it affect the people\nin your life\nhow does it impact the people that you\nlove\nuh you know because i think sometimes\npeople are not aware and i'm not asking\nthat as a like\njudging the anyone who goes through it's\nmore\nso that we hear how difficult it is for\nthe person who's suffering\nbecause often i think when we see people\naddicted we see them cause pain to\nothers and we think oh well they're just\ncausing pain to others but\ni can't imagine that anyone is happy\ncausing pain to others\nwhen they're in so much pain and\nsuffering themselves when i was 21\ni was put in an outpatient program after\nbeing arrested four times for possession\ncharge\nand the day i supposedly graduated that\nnight i got the brilliant idea to go to\nnew york city with a buddy of mine and\nwe did these mind erasure shots took a\nhandful of xanax\nand the night turned out so well that\nhis car fell in the ditch he fell asleep\nbehind the road my face went into the\nwindshield i woke\nup in the hospital with a massive\nconcussion 90 stitches in my face so\nanybody listening right now i didn't\ncare if you're young or older\nthe first two people i saw when i came\nthrough were my mom and my dad\nbroken in tears helpless that their baby\nboy\nwas spirally under control because\nthat's what addiction does addiction\ndestroys families\nyou think it's the person suffering we\nkill everybody else around us\neverybody else around us you know and\nnobody gets out for free\nyou got three choices you're gonna get\nlocked up\ncovered up or cleaned up\ntell me about some of the people that\nyou\nintentionally that unintentionally at\nthat time you knew that\nyou were pushing away or making it\nharder for them\nbut you couldn't do anything about it\nlike did you feel helpless at that point\nwith how you were with people or did you\nfind you were actually yourself\nwith people this was just something you\nwere dealing with professionally\nat work and in those environments you\nknow there were some people in my inner\ncircle that just\nhad no idea what they can do um it was\nvery\nit was it was very much a high bottom\nthat was very much\nyou know i was living this double life\npeople knew something was wrong they\ndidn't know what because there's so much\nshame\ni mean my ego okay look i've arrived man\ni\ni can't be telling everybody that i'm\nbefore i'm going out one night i'm\nsnorting six percents and four\noxycontins and\nbringing more in the bathroom with me\nwhen i'm at an event with the client\nbecause to me also i'm getting these\nfrom doctors\ni'm not doing illegal drugs anymore i'm\nnot jeopardizing my morality clauses\nwith with my clients you know these\ndoctors are writing me prescriptions for\nsciatica whatever it might be\nso i justified it and i believed my own\nbull crap\nthat's that's the hardest part about it\ni feel like knowing that you're not\ndoing anything\nillegal and it feels like oh this is all\nyou know\nabove the line this is all normal and\nno i mean man i remember being on the\nplane with dennis rahman to vegas for\ncelebrity\ni mean uh coming home from london from\ncelebrity big brother and actually\nmuhammad ali and lonnie were on the\nflight we had no idea\nand we're back and you know he was ready\nto go to sleep and\nhad a drink or whatever and just here's\nmy pill bottle and\njust looks over even him i mean i'm many\nclients say something in the story goes\nbro\nyou got to stop at these things you know\ni was like bro my back's killing me\ndon't even start with me\nlike just yeah did you meet\nother people before you went into\nrecovery that were struggling with\nsimilar things and also being quiet\nand also coming up with like a white lie\nor whatever it was or or did you feel\nso alone that you were the only person\nthat you know\ngoing through this no it's funny i there\nwas a handful of people\nbusiness-wise and personalized that i\nremember going through rough times and\nagain maybe just being a master you know\ncon artist in my own way back then am i\nusing day it's not a bad way i just\nalways had a way to\nyou know come across as the guy well put\ntogether i actually helped some people\nget sober\nnot realizing i'm the one that needs the\nhelp\nwow so even at that time not not in\nrecovery even at that time you helped\nother people get out of it yup not real\nwow that's crazy that's insane wow\nthat's that's amazing that just shows\nthat you've\nalways had this ability to have a\npositive influence of others\ntell us about the journey of recovery\ni love your a's that you mentioned there\nbecause i think they're so practical and\nactionable\nbut before we get into the practicality\ni want to hear\nwhat recovery was like where it started\nand what were the steps the back and\nforth\nthe oscillating period like i want to\nhear about like\nwhen you thought you had a breakthrough\nbut you didn't because i feel like\nthat's\nwhere most people spend their life is\nthey keep having breakthroughs where yes\ni'm through\nand then they get pulled back in and\nthat's when you've got to keep going and\nyou've been through that\ntell us about the start of recovery and\nthen that period\nso i learned so many things from my\nspiritual brothers and sisters\nyou know they talk about 90 meetings in\n90 days if you could do anything for 90\ndays straight it'll reprogram your brain\nand\nreprogram your spiritual course so i\nbecame obsessed with meetings\ni learned that anything i put my before\nmy recovery i'll lose it\ni learned to stick with the winners i\nlearned that recovery isn't based on\npromotion it's based on attraction\nthat's why i wanted to sit with you\nbecause the opposite of\naddiction is connection and i know\npeople are going to be watching this and\nlistening to it and feel our connection\nand for an addict and somebody that has\nimpostor syndrome whether you're in your\nteens or you're older\nthat's what it's about it's it's about\nwaking up that dead spirit that\nbroken spirit that darren prince had for\n24 years where\nit becomes alive little by little\ndoesn't happen overnight like you said\nyou know you might have you know a\ndetour at a certain point\nbut that's why we need our support\nsystem with other spiritual brothers and\nsisters and\nit took me a good six months my sponsor\nsteve always says i was an exposed nerve\num it took me at least a good six months\nfor the physical\ncravings uh for my brain to somewhat\nstart working\nto start sleeping again um i had it\nevery day i had to call my sponsor\ni i went to my meetings i listened i\nkept my mouth shut\ni heard take the cotton out of your ears\nand put it in your mouth\ni started implementing the 12 steps i\ndon't know if you're familiar with them\ni tell people all the time\n12 steps everybody on earth can use\nalcohol is only mentioned in the first\nstep\nwe all need them on a daily basis and\num you know little by little once i got\nto that one year mark i started\nrealizing you know what\ni need to get life to be like lasagna\nand then i'm good\nyou talk about finding happiness was\nyour purpose which i love and so many\nmillions of people around the world do\nthat was my mission sober and lasagna\nbecause if i can keep it there\nmore times than not i got a shot and um\nlike i said once i got to that one year\nman i i i started becoming\nopen pretty early on on facebook and\ninstagram\num my mom wasn't thrilled about it you\nknow upper middle class jewish family\nembarrassed a little bit but then\nshe would start having friends here and\nthey're all my friend my son my friend\nis struggling and\nmy dad was always super supportive may\nhe rest in peace and uh\njust knew that i was on to something\nthat that was much bigger than darren\nprince the agent\nyeah he knew how passionate i was about\nbusiness the psychotic work ethic i had\nfrom a teenager\nthat when i commit to a project when i\ncommit to an individual you'll never\nmeet\nany human being that'll say darren\nprince that he's going to do this for me\nyou never follow bro\ncame from my dad so i put that same\nrelentless psychotic\nobsessive drive the same i do to this\nday\num into me getting sober because i knew\nif i can get it\nand i can get that foundation slowly put\nthose meetings put those spiritual\nmessages\ninto my spiritual bank there's gonna be\na day i'm\ni'm gonna need to withdraw upon it\nbecause just because\ni got sober doesn't mean life is always\ngonna get better\nbut this guy got better my perspective\nchanged\nmy perception changed on everything\nand i became the spiritual god-loving\nbeing that if something worked out in\nbusiness\ngreat if it's something i really wanted\nit didn't work out that's great too\njust wearing life like a loose garment\nand um\nlike i said to me the biggest thing was\ngiving it away and helping others\nwhat was the hardest part about recovery\nwhat was the most difficult thing\nthat people are gonna have to break\nthrough when they're in that point\nuh slowing the brain down how can i not\ngo at a wedding how can i not to go to a\nparty i cannot go to a function without\npicking up a drink or doing\nsomething like this don't worry about it\nbecause you need to do something you've\nnever done before in your life you need\nto stay present\ndon't project because when i speak now i\noften say we're not responsible for our\nthoughts but we are responsible for how\nlong you want to think those thoughts\nand if you and i made a list of\nprojecting on\n100 things that might not go right over\nthe next few months not that with those\ntype of people\n99 of them aren't even going to happen\nthat way and the one that might go wrong\nthe biggest blessing is going to come of\nit yeah you know\nyeah but it's the constant working on\nthis\nand in here and in here to just\nunderstand\nslow this down you know yeah let's let's\ntalk about the service element of it of\nnow you\npaying it forward passing it on becoming\na sponsor yourself and\nhelping others and serving others tell\nme about\nhow people can help people in their\nlives\nif they think they're addicted because i\nthink that for everyone who's listening\ntoday they may not be\ngoing through addiction in the extreme\nsense\nhow can we help others in our lives that\nwe love\nduring this time what what should we do\nand what should we avoid\nyou know there's um this question comes\nup all the time there's so many ways to\ngo about it\nunfortunately if it's your loved one\nmost people are too close\nyou could always try the intervention um\ni'm at a point with\nsome mothers that call me with their\nchildren i'm like get them arrested\nyou want to bury them or you want them\nto sit in jail it's that simple\nyou know there's no in between anymore\nbecause during this interview we're\ngoing to lose about 23 lives from the\nopioid epidemic\nepidemic just in this country alone\nand look i know people are struggling\nwith the pandemic and all that but\naddiction and substance abuse and mental\nhealth has taken a back seat to it\nnot as much mental health i should say\nbecause people are isolated they're in\nhomes but\nthe addiction you know\nit's not getting uh you know the\ncoverage that it should\nbecause it's worse than ever and you\nknow aside from\nlike i said maybe an intervention um\nthere's\nso many great treatment centers out\nthere that somebody could reach out to\nlocally\nto see if that loved one is willing to\nspeak\nto a counselor to see if they could have\na breakthrough because a lot of times\njay\nit takes somebody that's in recovery\nyou're based like i said based on the\nattraction not promotion\nwhere i have a lot more success than it\ncould be one of your closest childhood\nfriends god forbid or somebody's\nsuffering\nthat darren prince is going to come in\nand i'm not going to talk to you about\nyour problem\ni'm going to talk to you about what my\nproblem was like yeah i'm going to talk\nabout the way i behaved\nbecause i'm not going to shove it down\nyour throat and then if you want what i\nhave you're going to tell me\ni think that way i do that now and\nthat's when god\ncomes into my heart and changes lives\nand i've seen it time and again\nit's just the most beautiful experience\nin the world that\njust never gets old absolutely man i\nknow exactly\nexactly what you mean when what do you\nthink it was\nthat made you turn towards god why god\nwhere was god\nin your life before did you always have\nfaith\nor was this something new and fresh\nbecause\ni always find that when people go\nthrough these life-changing moments\nit either goes towards god or sometimes\nit goes towards\nlower habits in our lower selves\nwhy for you was god so accessible\nyou know i grew up uh jewish went to\ntemple always believed in a god but i\nthink at one point\num maybe i didn't believe in him maybe i\nleft my faith\nand um life just became so crazy but\nwhen i had that white light moment that\nwas it i mean that was it and then i got\nso many gmc's and i still get them to\nthis day at gmc's meet god manage\ncoincidences\nand um you know i've still had the ups\nand downs like anybody else and\nchallenges in recovery\nbut i just know um he's with me this\nmorning magic johnson and hulk hogan\nwere my first two phone calls\nbecause they're so excited about any\ntime i have a big platform especially\nlike yours\nto push this message and i'll tell you\nmaybe 30 seconds was about business\nmagic was 20 minutes hulk was 15.\nit's about god it's about god being here\nright now with you and i and i'm feeling\nhim through me\nbecause sometimes i don't even know what\ni'm going to say and i know it's going\nto come out the exact way he wants me as\na vessel because\nfor such a long time even in recovery i\nknew i needed him\nand then he started sending messages i\nneed darren prince\nthe agency life was just a byproduct of\nwhat your purpose is going to be\nsomething is going to happen through the\nnotoriety you've gotten through your\nindustry\nwhere you're going to touch people\naround the world and then that's when\nacumen\nthe book yeah and and i and i love that\nbecause\nyou're almost acting as an ambassador of\ngod\nuh in your way for the people that can\nconnect with you and you're using and\nengaging\nthe platform that you built yep for that\npurpose\nabsolutely and i see that whenever you\nconnect me to someone or when we're\nmessaging or when we speak like\ni never don't feel like there's just\nthis\nbeautiful sincere intention behind\nbehind every time we connect and you you\nfeel that\nwhen you sit down to write the book and\nput it together\nwhat's the process like\nof revisiting so many of these moments\nis it actually like\nyour smile came on your face with\neveryone who's listening again uh is it\nactually a moment of like yes i get to\nserve through it or is it\npainful to revisit those moments it\nwasn't painful\nit was very therapeutic at that point i\nwas um\ni think about nine years so 10 years\nsober\nand my amazing publisher anna david she\nhad a vision\nmy dad passed away a year earlier and\nalways wanted me to write a book about\nthe agent life but i would explain to my\ngood dad\nbut do one about the ollie fraser says\nlike ah dad you know john muhammad it\nwas private i really want to get into it\nand\ni i go dad i don't have an ego anymore i\ni'm nobody's special\ni work for people that are very special\ni've accomplished extraordinary things\ni'm just a guy that's got great\nnetworking ability i'm a good people\nperson i've got good negotiating skills\nand\nit's like oh okay well maybe one day\nyou'll think about it when i met with\nanna\nshe just kind of like our conversation\nbecause your passion\nbecause the way you speak about your\njourney and your recovery she goes why\ndon't you write a book about it\nand she goes and implement the\nfly in the wall experience of being an\nagent since the most iconic figures of\nour time\nand that's when it hit like that's it i\nthought that is it\nand a month later i'm in miami and uh in\ntears\nof joy with magic johnson and i told him\nand he got so excited because baby boy\nthis\nthis is so great this book's gonna be\nyour legacy\nand you're gonna change and save so many\nlives and as\ni turned into that nervous little kid\nfor a second because i had to ask him\nfor a big favor and i call him urban by\nhis real name i said urban\nwould you do me a favor and write the\nforward to the book he goes man i'd be\nso pissed if i didn't write the photo\nwhat are you gonna ask dennis or\nsomebody else so\nhe he did a beautiful forward and uh but\nbut\nthat's just amazing too like what like\nthe support that i got genie bossy you\nhad the\nprivilege of meeting a mark cuban and\nhall i mean so many clients just got\nbehind me with this\nand social media and promoting it and\ndoing interviews with me and\nit just made me realize like i could do\nthe biggest sports marketing deal in\nhistory it wouldn't even matter this\nis what life is about because they saw\nme\ngo deep in hell and come back out\nwhat's beautiful is that you had such a\ndeep relationship with these people\nand when you're referring to the phone\ncalls you had this morning\nwhat i love about is that your bond was\nso deep that you've all stayed together\nuh and and i think that's something\nreally special because\nsometimes people go through recovery and\nthey look around and like no one's the\nsame anymore\nbecause no one went with them on the\njourney\nyeah but the impact that you had on\nthese people's lives was\nso meaningful that they they're with you\non the journey you're still all together\nright now that must feel really special\nyeah hulk ended the call\nwith i know you don't want me telling\nthis but he ended the call like his\nbrother\ni told you years ago there's a light\naround you and you\ncan correct and asked god for the\nblessing\nand he's like now i'm going to make you\na blessing to other people and that's\nwhat he's doing\nand uh you know magic knows all the\ngreat work i'm doing with my aiming high\nfoundation 100\nof the proceeds go to get people into\ntreatment i'm affiliated\nwith bannon treatment center 14\nproperties if people don't have the\nmoney i do anything i can to get them\ninto treatment there\nmagic said god just blesses you ten-fold\nfor the work that you're doing\nabsolutely that's just how life works\nand he goes i've\ni've seen it because i've seen the\ntransformation man it is so beautiful\nand i'm so happy and\ni said had me in a little bit of tears\nat the end because he goes garden and\nyour dad's going to be there with you\ntoday which i\ni know it i love that i love hearing\nthat tell me tell me about\ntell me about another story i love that\nstory you said of the\nthe boy standing up in the middle of his\nclass and tell us about another\nexperience you've had with\nsomeone that i know there's i know\nthere's not a good one that was recent\nso i was at in south carolina about a\nmonth ago i spoke at oak's recovery\num donated a bunch of money to get five\npeople into treatment and i got to meet\nthem all after i spoke\nand this one guy comes over to me and\nhe goes thank you for saving my life\nlike\nthat's what i did because you're darren\nprince at the aiming high foundation\nsaid i said that's great i said i'm so\nglad you're here because no you don't\nunderstand i was dead on the side of the\nroad\na few weeks ago narcon saved my life and\nthe local treatment center massachusetts\ncouldn't take me\nso the prosecutor when the judge wanted\nto throw me in jail\ncalled over here and they said we got a\ngrant we can put you on the plane\nwe can get you started on this brand new\nlife\nand he pulls out his cell phone because\nbecause of you\ni'm gonna get to see my kids again\nand they're gonna have a father\ni mean i don't care about the money\nanymore\ni told omar on that podcast i go bro i\ntruly believe money doesn't buy\nanything but temporary happiness i love\nit i take care of so many people\num that'd be the only thing that's\nheartbreaking i've ever lost it\nthat i couldn't have the ability to do\nthat you know i care about my purpose\nat this point because i know if i lost\nthe business and the money tomorrow j\nyou'd still be sitting right in front of\nthe same darren prince\nthe darren prince that turned his pain\ninto his purpose\nand there's no better feeling than that\nyou got it at a young age you found\nyourself at a very young age which is\nso incredibly beautiful what you're\ndoing inspire the world because people\nneed to hear it\ndo you know many adults 50 60 40 that\nare super accomplished that haven't\nthey haven't gotten through the healing\nyou know that stuff is still in here\nthe character defects the acting out the\nthings that they do\nyou know i'm not a perfect human being\num you know i still make mistakes\nbut i try to be accountable i try to\ntake an action and apologize\nright away because i don't want that\nemotional hangover you know but i say\nlike this i'm not exactly who i want to\nbe i'm not yeah where i want to be but\nthank you god i'm not the person i used\nto be\ni love that i love that\nthat that's just so magical and and\nbeautiful to hear\nand uh you know just just taking in what\nyou just said because i think that's\nsomething you know that's a beautiful\naffirmation that we can all repeat\nto ourselves and can all connect with\nthat that we're not\nwho we want to be we're not you know\nwhere we want to be yet\nbut uh at least we're not who we used to\nbe i think that's such a\nsuch a beautiful prayer and such a\nbeautiful affirmation in\nconnecting us with god i loved what you\nsaid earlier i want to go back to it\nyou said that the opposite of addiction\nis connection i thought that was so\npowerful\ni mean that in and of itself is such a\nwhat are some of the deepest ways you\nchoose to connect with people now\nobviously it's service obviously it's\nhelping them\nbut if someone wants to deepen their\nconnection with someone\nwhat should they be doing i think be\nmore present\npriscilla used to struggle with that as\nwe know\nis love but i think she's seen\nimprovements um\ni love what you say about the cell phone\nbefore you go to bed at night yeah i've\nbeen getting better at it um\nbecause that just doesn't work you just\nyou you just have to\nif you're struggling yourself with\nsomething the quickest way to get out of\nyour own head is be of service to\nsomebody else\nthey don't need to be struggling with\ndrugs alcohol it could be a health issue\nfamily issue friend problem drop\njob problem and and i i just think when\nyou're there in that moment\nand you're there without looking for a\npayoff but just to be a good kind\ncaring human being you know you will\nhelp that other individual\na hundred percent because they're gonna\nfeel that energy it's all about the\nenergy and the\nthe you know what's behind it you know i\ndon't\ni'm never somebody in my business that\nasks for favors my clients know that\nyou know um you lois because my boys if\ni can help you get clients i mean\nwe just had that connection on that call\nyou know um i just believe things happen\nenergetically and\nthe way they're meant to happen at a\ncertain point um if they're meant to\nhappen\nbut i just think you know that\nconnection um\nthe opposite of addiction is so powerful\nand i gotta give credit to my spiritual\nbrother brandon novak from jackass\nbecause he's the one that's always said\nit and um\ni think he's coming up on eight years\nsober it's just such a beautiful\ndeep deep um you know statement\nfor somebody like me how often do you\nstill keep in touch with\nyour spiritual family now it sounds like\nyou talked to them look you've got them\nlois and all your guys\nand you know i i've got i i gotta just\nmention them whether it makes the kite\nyou know i've got\ntim ryan and jennifer jimenez and chris\nherron who's the best\nin the game the ex boston celtic and\nanna david ryan hampton brandon novak i\njust mentioned i mean\nthey are my mount rushmore they're the\nones with the big big\nfollowings they're out there constantly\npushing this message speaking hundreds\nof times a year on all the biggest talk\nshows\nand we all use each other as a therapist\nwhen we're drained when we're beaten up\nand we need that source of energy we\nneed that reminder\num we call on them we call on each other\nmy sponsor steve delaval\nsaved my life i called him two days ago\ni said i can't thank you enough because\nman you'll never understand that you\nhelped me darren way more than i ever\nhelped you\nbecause you put the work in and um\nyou need it i mean i heard it in your\nvoice when we spoke a couple months ago\ni told you what i was taught\ni'm not a genius making up these things\nyou know i said learn to say no\nyeah because you got to take care of you\ni know what's going on with your book\ntour and you need to get to england with\nyour wife and\njust check out them it's key because\nyou know if you forget these little\ntidbits these little nuggets\nyou know you're going to put yourself in\na bad energy space you're not going to\nbe good to other people you know\ni've learned so much from them j\nspirituality wise like\nnow life is about saying what i mean\nmeaning what i say and not saying it\nmean\ni try to understand people instead of me\nbeing understood\nand this goes for everybody if you're in\na hit of an argument with somebody\nbite your tongue stop the text don't\nsend the email because it's so much\nbetter to be all right than right\njust stay in that place of peace in 10\nminutes you're not gonna know why the\nheck you were so angry in the first\nplace\nthat's what i've learned that keeps me\non that spiritual super being\nbecause a lot of those old character\ndefects that come out that's going to\npush me closer to a relapse and\ni'm not afraid of relapsing and dying\nthat's easy\ni go bad my system's not going to be\ntaken i'm\ndeathly afraid of relapsing and living\nthat's what i don't want\never and i'll do whatever the heck it\ntakes i'll move away from people\nplaces clients whatever it might be to\nstay in that place\nbecause nothing is ever worth going back\nto that life\ndo you ever feel when you hear someone\nand they say to you darren you know i\nread your book\ni hear you but i just can't change like\nyou know someone's just like i just\ni just i can't do it it's just not for\nme i'm not you i'm not as special as you\ni'm not as\nhard-working as you are i'm not as\ndisciplined as you are i can't do the 90\ndays\nhave you ever had anyone say that to you\nand\nwhen they've said that what's been your\nresponse it's it's a great\nit's another great question i'm at the\nla mantras about\nthree years ago before the book came out\ni had this individual i spoke i was\nhonored at the new jersey mental health\nassociation gala\nin may of 2015 knew nothing about\nspeaking\nif i even watched the tape long before i\nstarted working with my speech and coach\nit was probably embarrassing but i still\ngot the claps and\nwhatever so i found out a week before\nthat this individual was coming a\n23-year-old kid that was in 18 treatment\ncenters 18\nand he's coming to see me because he\nread my bio and the father said it's the\nfirst time i saw some light of\nexcitement\ni actually knew then this event had\nnothing to do with me that ego was\npushed aside\nthis event has this individual all over\nit that's why i'm chosen to be the\nspeaker in the keynote and uh with\ncaptain dodge had a\ngreat time at the event i spoke to him i\nactually flew to london later that night\nright at a newark airport for\nsome business and text me when i was in\nlondon kept going bad\n10 20 times i'd be instilling whatever\nmy spiritual knowledge is to him\ngot to a point where he wasn't checking\nin as much and i'm at the montreux three\nyears ago and i texted him from the\npolice said hey bro you're doing okay\ntexted you back you know what i wanted\nto reach out for your day i'm just so\nembarrassed\ni i just feel like i'm wasting your time\ni just can't get this i'm just not ready\num i'm not you everything you just said\ni picked up the phone and i called him\nand i said uh\nhey man i don't care if you go bad\n99 more times get me on the hundredth\nbecause i don't want to miss the magic\nin your eyes because i've seen it from\nthat phone call\nhe just celebrated six years over wow\ni love hearing you could see that one\ngets me because it's i\nlove hearing that that's beautiful how\nmany of the 99 did he get\nyeah how far did he had to get in was it\n100th or yeah he did it\nit didn't even take more man i think it\nwas like another one and he was\nhe was there he made it he never know\nhow close you are and i just said\nit's just it's the greatest feeling in\nthe world because i know again it's not\nit's not even me i'm just i'm just being\nused for my purpose\nyou know i uh you know\njust feelings never get old it's just\nthe greatest thing though because you're\nnot just changing that individual to the\nmother and the father\nand the girlfriend and the sister and\nthe grandparents that are at his first\ncoin ceremony that i've got the\nprivilege to give him that coin and\ntears of joy and hugging each other this\nindividual from two completely different\nwalks of life\nbut we had one thing we had nothing in\ncommon but we had everything in common\ni love that man i love that everyone\nwho's been listening\ni hope that you're gonna go and grab a\ncopy of\naiming high by darren prince her\nprominent sports and celebrity agent hit\nbottom\nat the top uh it's already an amazon\nbestseller but\nmore importantly the reason what's\nwhat's resonating with me right now that\ni want everyone to hear is\na lot of the times we turn to knowledge\nespecially in this space\nreactively we we think about it\nafterwards once someone in our family\ngets affected or once we're\naddicted to something and the truth is\nthat\nwe can all avoid this in our lives\nif we read this book if we listen to\nthis conversation now we can actually\nlive a life where\nwe don't have to hit the bottom\nto be able to practice this and i think\nsome of us can sometimes be complacent\nto the fact that oh that won't happen to\nme oh that won't happen to my kids so\nthat won't happen it's so easy to get\nlost in that it won't happen to me and\nthe next thing you know you and\nexactly what happens to you exactly and\nit's so i hate saying that but it's it's\njust\nreality and the truth and i know that\nevery time my teachers would always say\nto me every time i say like oh no i\ndon't think that's an issue for me that\ni was like ah\nlike that you know like don't ever say\nthat because\nyou're you're running the risk of just\nhaving a massive blind spot and so\nif any of you are listening today and\nhave been moved by darren as i've been\nuh please please please go and grab a\ncopy of the book aiming hi\nshare it with a friend uh darren before\nwe go into a final five i want to ask\nyou one question\nanyone who's listening actually no i'll\nshare this with you after the final five\nsays you know we end every episode\nwith a final five uh which is our rapid\nfire fast five so\nthere's you already know this but the\nanswers have to be one word\nor one sentence maximum so darren the\nfirst question is\nuh for your final five is what is your\nultimate metric\nof success today happiness within\nand being of service to others beautiful\ni did not expect a different answer\nuh second question what's the best\nadvice you ever received\nprobably my father um it's not what you\nsay it's what you do\ni love that number three uh what's the\nworst advice you've ever received\nprobably i gotta look back i'm my buddy\ni'm not gonna mention his name when we\ndecided to go to new york city fresh out\nof outpatient\nit didn't turn out too well you know 90\nstitches in my face this is why i got\nthis ugly mug today\noh god no you look great uh question\nnumber four\nfor just laughing in the back\nhe looks great question number four\nwhat's something that you think\nother people value but you don't value\nanymore\nstuff and things again i got nothing\nagainst it i like nice stuff too\nbut yeah ultimately it's not gonna be\nyour legacy it's not it's gonna\nreally make you happy it's gonna give\nyou temporary happiness\nabsolutely and fifth and final question\nif you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\noh it's a great question man um one not\neverybody had to follow\ni think i gotta go back to you know\nbeing kind\nyou know i think that's what it comes\ndown to so often being kind of being a\nservice\nand not enough people are to wrap them\nto their own crap\nand you don't realize when you're more\nkind\nand you're more in that place of service\neverything works out so much better for\nyou\nabsolutely absolutely daryn one last\nquestion which is not part of the final\nfive but i had to ask this to you\nif anyone's listening today and they've\nbeen incredibly moved\nand they want to support the work you're\ndoing what can they do to help how can\nthey support how can they get involved\nhow can they\napart from of course reading the book\nwhich we're recommending to everyone but\nhow can people how can people help so uh\nmy foundation\nmost likely aiminghivefoundation.org\nwe take like i said 100 of the proceeds\nif people are listening and they can't\nafford a book\npatrick and the publisher have sent out\nhundreds and hundreds of books free of\ncharge they can\nget to me on instagram at agent\nunderscore dp i just want to put them in\npeople's hands i didn't write the book\nto make money\nwhen it started making a lot of money\nthat's when i said i'm gonna start my\nfoundation because that's what god
