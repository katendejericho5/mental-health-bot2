    "transcript": "my journals have always been things that\ni like to you know\ni'm like kind of looking at life i've\nrealized something i'm like okay i need\nto drop this down\nor maybe sometimes i just need to talk\nto somebody out loud\nand quite frankly sometimes you are you\ncan be your best friend\num so kind of speaking out loud writing\nthose issues that you start to kind of\nunfold some of the answers to your\nproblems\nthank you so much to everyone who's\nwatching or listening right now\ni'm so excited to introduce our next\nguest i was introduced to her content by\nmy sister\nover six years ago and just remembering\nbeing completely captivated by her\ncharisma\nher energy and a genuine unauthentic\nfeeling that came through the camera\nand then very recently i connected with\nher incredible sister mona who's also\nbeen on the podcast\nand then i was just completely amazed\nthat i had this opportunity to reconnect\nwith this incredible human being\nincredible person and today's the first\ntime we're meeting\nand i'm getting to interview her and i\nlove interviewing people the first time\nbecause i feel it allows us to build a\nreal relationship and bond very quickly\nyou almost have to\nbe forced to become best friends so i'm\nhoping that's what's going to happen\nher name is huda katan she is the ceo\nand founder of huda beauty and starring\nin of course the reality show that we\nspoke about on facebook watch\ncalled huda boss which i absolutely love\nso hira thank you so much for this\nopportunity\nit's an honor to be here with you no i'm\nso grateful that you've taken out the\ntime\ni know you're so busy in london you're\nlaunching products you're here with your\nfamily and\nand i generally want to make everyone\naware we're so fortunate to be with you\nso thank you\nthis was the most important thing to do\nhere so so happy to be here that's\nexperience now you literally are and i\nsend this to mona too\nyou you're literally a beauty phenomenon\nthank you\nand the way you present it through your\nwork through your videos through your\nmedia\nis so refreshing especially as someone\nwho never really consumed content\nin the beauty world but definitely\nlooking to that world because i feel it\nsets\nsuch a standard for how people feel\nabout themselves and so much of my work\nis about how people feel\nso i'd love to hear your thoughts on\nthe beauty industry itself but\nspecifically on the role of self-love\nand how you manage the two um gosh where\ndo you begin\ni definitely think the beauty industry\nhas come a long way and it's funny\nbecause i've had conversations around\nthis\nespecially recently about the fact that\none of the things that i think\nhas been missing um in the beauty\nindustry and we have a lot of it now\nis the fact that people don't like to\nshow their vulnerable\nside and i know you talk about that a\nlot you talk about so many things that\nare sensitive to people\num and i think the fact that we really\nkind of honed in on that we showed\nstrong before and afters when i first\nstarted doing my videos doing\nyou know some things that were really\nembarrassing i was embarrassed to put\nmyself on\na video without makeup and not knowing\nmy angles not knowing those things\nit's hard um but you really want to show\npeople that they can be a part of that\nand um i think it's worked really well\nfor our brand just you know trying to\nshow people that like look we're not all\nperfect in fact\nsome of us don't really feel great\nwithout makeup and some of us have\nissues that we're trying to go through\nbut we're all trying to go through it\ntogether\nand i think it's really important to be\nreally really real and you know\nas a result to show that really\nsometimes sensitive\nuncomfortable embarrassed vulnerable\nside of who you are\num i think it's very very important yeah\nabsolutely there's such a need for that\ntransparency and authenticity and i know\nthat you've even turned down deals\noh yeah to be able to keep that yeah and\nwhen i read that i thought that was\nincredible because\ntoday in the world we live in of\nsponsorships and partnerships\nit's so easy to get carried away tell us\nabout that and how you've managed to\nhold on to that that is not easy let me\ntell you when somebody comes to you like\nsometimes offering you multi-million\ndollar deals\nand you really want to do that because\nyou think oh yeah that's a lot of money\nbut ultimately um i think there's a\ngreat power of focus\ni'm a super focused person i think that\nanything that derails your focus\nyou know anything that you do that is\nnot in your focus just basically takes\na little piece of that pie of what\nyou're trying to achieve so i'm a firm\nbeliever in focus\num and ultimately could we do paid posts\ncould we do those things or do when\npeople do them is there anything wrong\nwith them\nabsolutely not but i just think for me\npersonally it was just you know we we\nkind of identified early on that our\ngoal was to give out free information\num we really want to give out you know\nkind of similar to what you do\nyou know like you could easily write\ntons of books you could easily do so\nmany things you know\nand i'm sure you will but you give out\nso much free information and i feel like\nthat's why i feel like you were the\nfuture you know i was telling you that\nwhen you walked in i feel like you were\nthe future i feel like that is the\nfuture\nwhere people need to be more giving um\nand i think that can kind of then help\nyou\nuh and when we talk about self-love oh\nmy gosh like that is like\nthat's like opening pandora's vlogs\nlet's do it\nwell because there's so much to say\nabout that and i think if i think about\nmy personal journey with self-love\num you know to get really vulnerable um\nright now i actually didn't realize for\nthe longest time\nyou know as a child you know as i've\nbeen dealing with different things in my\nlife\nas i've come into being a professional\nin the beauty industry and being where i\nam i didn't realize that the thing that\ni was missing the most was self-love and\nit's so funny because you achieve some\nsuccess you know or what you perceive to\nbe successful\nand then all of a sudden you start\nself-sabotaging yourself like i don't\ndeserve this i don't belong here\ni'm not like you know not that you're a\nphony but like you know you think\neverybody around you\nis somehow has some magic that you are\nmissing you know and it's the craziest\nthing because\ni think in the day and age that we live\nin it's so easy to compare yourself to\npeople\nyou go through social media you see\ndifferent people you know as humans i\nthink we\nare given a gift to be able to live\nvicariously through people but then when\nyou're done with that\nyou're sometimes left with emotions of\nemptiness emotions of you know that\nyou know my sister who's a genius she's\nbrilliant she once said to me she's like\nyou know comparison is a thief of joy\nwhich\ni know is is a quote i think by eleanor\nroosevelt um\nbut ish and she's full of great quotes\nby the way\nshe's like a walking like dictionary of\nquotes um but when she said to me i was\nlike you know it's just it's crazy\nbecause we\ncan continuously compare ourselves to\nother people we go through social media\nwe see all these things and even if\nyou've achieved\nwhat you wanted to achieve you then do\nthat and then all of a sudden discounts\neverything you've done\nand then you don't feel worthy of what\nyou're doing you don't feel worthy of\ngoing to the next step\nand i didn't realize that was the thing\nthat i was missing the most for the\nlongest time\nyou know that self-worth that value and\ni think from\nthe outside looking in a lot of people\nmight be like well\nthat's insane you know you're a husband\nwho loves you you have a daughter\nyou're a successful business but then if\nthat was missing\nthat was like the one thing that was\nmissing so i never felt like\nworthy of anything i was doing um and it\ntook me\ni think getting our investors to invest\nin us where it was like all of a sudden\nyou know\nyou don't think you're good enough you\nknow for whatever reason\nand the industry all of a sudden now is\nrecognizing that you're good enough\neverybody is is here like this is this\nis something saying yes you've made it\nyou are officially\nequal to everyone else no in fact you've\nachieved something that is you know\nquite amazing\nand then i was just you know i was\ndepressed i was really depressed we we\ngot this amazing investment and i think\nit was like probably\none of the lowest times in my life you\nknow and it's it was it was it\ntook me a lot to kind of realize i was\nlike missing that self-love\nyou know that was like the next step\nthat i need to really get into thank you\nfor sharing that so openly yeah of\ncourse\nand it's great for everyone to hear\nbecause i feel almost from an outside\nperspective\nwe all have this belief that once we hit\na certain level of success\nthat that feeling goes away yeah you\nmake a certain amount of money\nfeeling goes away and and i do want to\ncongratulate you on all your incredible\nsuccess\nbut at the same time it's so beautiful\nto hear you say that because\nself-love is so often lost and i was\nthinking about this yesterday\nand i'm diving into it totally off the\ncuff because it's there in my\nintuition right now to say it that we\nstruggle with self-love because often we\nget known for that which we're not\nso we often get known but for you you\nwere getting known for who you were\nand what you were and what you loved\nwhere did your self-pro\nlove process start like what were the\nthings that you started with if\nsomeone's listening right now and\nthey're struggling where do they start i\nreally think you need to dig deep though\nyou need to find out what is the reason\nthat you've been telling yourself\nthat all of a sudden when you achieve\nsomething you know my thing was like\nokay something good happens now\nsomething's bad's gonna happen\nbecause i can't push through to the next\nstep like i was putting a\nceiling on myself to where i was almost\nlike you know what we've achieved so\nmuch success oh my god amazing things\nare gonna\nhappening everything's you know going\nperfectly as planned and if not better\nand all of a sudden no something bad's\ngonna happen\nterrible that's gonna set me back you\nknow it's like i had to realize i was\nputting that ceiling on myself\nand i think i really started to need to\nunderstand that no\nthat's not going to happen but it was\nhard it was it took a lot of i think\njournaling i'm a big fan of journaling i\njournal like crazy\nand i started i almost started speaking\nout loud i actually said some things out\nloud to myself okay so this is what i\nthink is going to happen\nreally ridiculous things like oh my gosh\nlike you know my house is gonna\nsomething's gonna happen here i mean you\nknow all these like worrying thoughts\nthat i had i was like oh my god this is\ngonna happen here if this is my family\nsomething's gonna happen my family and i\nwas like saying it out loud i was like\nthis is\nridiculous i have all these like fears\nthat\nyou know as we've made it further that\ni'm going to be taken back and i've\ni had to realize that i was really\nself-sabotaging myself ultimately\nbecause i didn't think i deserved to go\nfarther\nand uh i just need to be really honest\nwith myself so i started journaling a\nlot\nand you know some of those issues come\nfrom childhood in fact i was going to\nask you where do you think they come\nfrom\ni think when i um you know i grew up in\na in a\nvery interesting you know circumstance i\nthink a lot of people go through\nyou know where you just feel like an\noutsider you feel like you don't belong\nand i think that\nkind of stayed with me where i felt like\ni never was good enough and i did\nmaybe when i first started maybe i had a\nlittle bit of a chip on my shoulder\nwhere i felt like i wasn't good enough\nand i was trying to prove things and i\nneed to continue to working hard\nyou know work as hard as possible so i\ncould be like you know like everyone\nelse\num it definitely came from my childhood\nyou know\nbut it should have continued with me\nyeah you know and that was probably one\nof the biggest mistakes was taking it\nwith me for so so long i mean for\n20 plus years um and it's hard i think\nit's hard to shake\ni don't know if i've completely shaken\nall of it i i know certainly i have not\nbut um but i'm still working on it yeah\nwell two questions what are\nwhat are you doing to shake it off what\nare you doing to work through it\nso journaling was one of them tell us\nyour journaling process that works for\nyou as\nsimple as it is or as complex services\nwalk us through it\nso i am a huge fan of journaling i don't\nbelieve journaling should be there to\nvent\ni think if you're mad at somebody don't\njournal don't journal like i hate this\nperson\nbecause sometimes when i got mad at my\nhusband i would journal and then i was\nlike forgive him i'd like oh my god let\nme like shut these pages i never see\nthem because he's an amazing man but you\nknow every once in a while you get mad\nat people and then you go\nyou know when you're mad it's just it\ndoesn't make sense i think journaling\nshould be\nreserved there should be um as as a book\nof epiphanies that's what i like to\nthink of it as\nmy journals have always been things that\ni like to you know\ni'm like kind of looking at life i've\nrealized something i'm like okay i need\nto jot this down\num or maybe sometimes i just need to\ntalk to somebody out loud\nand quite frankly sometimes you are you\ncan be your best friend um\nso kind of speaking out loud writing\nthose issues that you start to kind of\nunfold some of the answers to your\nproblems um\nand so i'm a huge fan of journaling and\ni think that's what should be rooster\nfor epiphanies\nand walking your way through you know\nlife's\nwhatever dilemmas that it brings will we\never see the book of epiphanies on our\nbookshops not about it yeah have you i\nhave i have thought about but some of\nit's really personal\nright yeah but yeah maybe yeah i mean\ni've been journaling for\nover 10 years so maybe gosh that's\nincredible yeah can you can you\ndo you date them as well i do can you go\nback as to what you were doing\ni do that all the time so i put where i\nwas and it's so crazy because i remember\nlooking through some of my journal\nentries and um\nyou know it's crazy the problems that\nyou had then but they still are the same\nproblems just\nlike different levels of problem but\nstill the same fundamental\nproblems like at the basics of them\nthey're they're still the same um\nand it's really crazy because you think\nthat you've progressed so far but there\nreally is that inner work that you need\nto do otherwise\nthose issues will continue throughout\nyour entire life\num tell us about one that you saw\nrecently that surprised you or anyone\nthat you can remember\nthat you thought oh wow i didn't can't\nremember that's where i was a few years\nback or\nyour feeling i definitely have like a\ncouple that i think\nmake me think about life very\ndifferently when um\ni think when we were trying to build our\nbrand when we were trying to you know\ndo different things we always you know\nwere\nwaiting for an opportunity and there was\nalways like you know opportunities that\nwere coming to us that we really wanted\nto close because we're like this can\nchange our lives this is going to change\nour brand\nthis is going to change everything um\nand sometimes they didn't go through\nand um you know it took me some time to\nrealize that\nlike and i think i've talked about this\nbefore but like i was my break you know\ni always wanted a break\nbut i realized that i was my break like\nyou don't need anything\nto take you to the next level all you\nneed is yourself conviction that you're\ngoing to go to the next level\nbut until you've done that you're always\ngoing to be waiting you know and\nuh and i don't think it's ever going to\nchange you're going to be waiting\nyou know whether it's 2010 2011 2012\nyou're going to consistently be in that\nstate of waiting\nand um and it took me some realizing\nyou know going through my blog to\nrealize that i was my own break yeah\nand how did you shake that feeling and\nthat experience of like\nparental expectations you studied\nfinance yeah the\nkind of the kind of path that's paved\nfor you of\ndoing certain traditional aspects how\ndid you shake that off and stop waiting\nand realize that you had to be your\nbreak\nbecause i think that's something that so\nmany people struggle with yeah i think\nit's normal too i think people just like\nyou know you wanna you wanna please\nother people you wanna do certain things\nto make other people happy\nbut the reality is you know i'll be\nhonest i'm a rebel\ni am a hardcore rebel like and it's so\nfunny because when i found out i did\nlike that personality test and i you\nknow\nthere's a there's something called the\nfour tendencies have you heard of yes\nyeah absolutely i'm a rebel\nokay\nyeah i am such a rebel and when i found\nout i was a rebel i was like no\ni don't want to be a rebel you didn't\nwant to no i was like the happiest i\nthink my ego got a massive boost from it\ni was so devastated because i was like\nwhat does a rebel mean like you know i\ndon't listen to inner and outer\nexpectations what does that mean\nand um i think that did help me because\na lot of times when people would say\nthings i'm like no i'm not going to do\nit i don't do unless i want to do it and\ni think shifting that like\nmaking sure that i got my needs\nfulfilled it actually helped me be a\nbetter family member my parents\nwanted me to marry an arab muslim man\nfrom like the same town that they were\nfrom and i was just like that's not\ngonna happen\nlike i think for your benefit um because\nyou want me to be happy and then you\nknow slowly but surely they realized\nthat\nme ultimately being happy was the right\nthing and i did you know i did care\nabout i had the core values that they\nhad\ni cared about family i cared about you\nknow being you know a good person in\nsociety so as long as i had those values\nand i could reiterate it to them then\nthey started giving me a little leeway\nand um it wasn't easy it was not easy my\nhusband went through a lot\nhe's a very patient man that's awesome\nobviously this is a shorter interview\nand i can't wait to really dive deep\nwith you one day\nlike i'm really looking forward to like\ngetting into a really meaningful\ndeep conversation but i won't wear\nmakeup so we can cry\nlet's do that monadilli made me cry at\nthe end of her so we were nearly there\nbut i i always at the end of every\ninterview do a final five in the final\nfive minutes oh yeah uh with your\nquestions that i\ni really want to get quick answers but\nyou can go deep if you want to because\nyou have awesome instead so you said\nobviously we're cutting this interview\nshort because\nyou so beautifully want to spend time\nwith your daughter which i think is an\nincredible priority\nand you said she's your number one\npriority she is how do you\nmake that happen like how does that\nhappen for someone who's as busy as you\nare traveling as much as you are\ndo you know i started realizing there\nwere certain things that i needed\nand it wasn't super huge but there were\ncertain things that i needed with her\nevery single day to feel fulfilled for\nher and myself so\nif that is the morning i like to spend\nthe first 45 minutes of my day with her\nand then the evening i like to spend at\nleast the last two hours of our day\ntogether whether you know\nand it's funny it's not that complicated\nyeah but it took me kind of like jotting\nthose things down and when i don't do\nthose things i'm constantly trying to\nplay catch up i want to pick up from\nschool and then i\nruin my office time you know and so it\nwas just understanding there were\ncertain things that were really good for\nher really good for me\ni wasn't bothered and i could like fully\nfocus on her and so that's what i do i\njust spend like the morning and the\nevening with her and\nit's really like i don't look at my\nphone she doesn't look at her phone um\nwe don't usually go out either we're\njust at home\nmaking popcorn tickling each other i\nknow it sounds really\nbasic but that's what we do it's like\nthe best time okay\nno it's beautiful it's great i think\nit's wonderful for people to hear that\nyeah\nwhat's your uh what's your number one\nadvice to anyone who wants to begin\ntheir self-love journey if they could do\none thing from today\nwhat would be the best place for them to\nstart i think it's really important to\nunderstand you know\nwhy you do some of the things that you\ndo you know if you have a goal what are\nthe what is the reason behind the goal\nand i think that's really important\nbecause people always put out goals we\nall know you need to plan you need to\nput goals out\nyou need to you know figure out the\nprocess in order to achieve your goals\nbut\ndo we ever do we ever think about why we\nwant them and i think understanding the\nwhy really helps us because\nmost of the time you can start getting\nsome of that need\nright away or you can reframe yourself\nto figure out you know\nhow you can really achieve full\nhappiness\ni was actually listening something\nyou've said so many amazing things about\nlistening to something today\nand it was about that kid who um you\nknow when when the teacher was asking\nabout like what did you want to be in\nlife and he said happy\nand the teacher was like what's wrong\nwith you yeah but that is so\nfundamentally important in the time that\nwe live right now where i think that\nyou know everyone has their own type of\nhappy they have their own type of\nyou know self-fulfillment and it's not\nlike everyone else so i definitely think\nit's really important to\nto kind of understand what it is that\nmakes each person happy and not\nbe so focused on goals is that weird\nthat i'm saying don't be so oriented\nno not at all i i love paradoxes yeah\nright and i think all of us are living\nparadoxes totally and i think there's\nthis push to be like this or that\ntotally but you can be both\nabsolutely and that's i think that's the\nbeauty in where we live you know i\nremember\nwhen um when i first wanted to become\nreally successful i had like this\nnegative picture of you know what it\nmeant to be successful\nwhat it meant to have wealth and money\nand i was like i don't want to be like\nthat\nlike i want to make sure if we do become\nsuccessful i still want to give i still\nwant to\ncare i still you know i want to be a\nphilanthropist i want to do all those\nthings\nand so you know as we've gone through\nour journey that's always been like the\nmost important thing and so i don't\nthink that\nyou know i don't think that people who\nhave money are bad um you know but i\nthink it's really important making sure\nthat you\nunderstand why you believe those things\nand understand how you can kind of\ncounter those things as well because\nthere is that equilibrium of where you\ncan exist in both worlds yes\nyou know yeah you know absolutely no no\nno no i'm i'm nodding along and i'm sure\neveryone at home is too\nor at work but uh question number three\nis\nuh what is one business lesson you wish\nyou knew earlier when you started\noh patience oh man i still need to learn\nthat i need to like go back and reread\nall my journal entries without patience\nwe have an arabic saying that i do like\na lot it's\nlike every delay has its blessing and i\ndidn't realize that when i was\nworking i like wanted things to close\nright away and then every time it didn't\ni would be\ndevastated and then when they did when a\ndifferent opportunity came it was always\nso much better\nso i think it's uh patience is really\nimportant i love that\nyeah isn't it yeah and your fourth one\nis i know you have this mantra called\nwhat would oprah do i love oprah\nyeah i wanted to know where that came\nfrom and give me a situation where it's\nworked\nwell it definitely changes the way i do\nthings a lot of times um the paid post\nactually\nbecause uh oprah doesn't do pay post um\nbut i think\nshe's just so incredible you know she's\nshe's\nbasically gone through so many hurdles\nin life where things could have gone a\ndifferent way\nin fact more than likely they should\nhave but they didn't\nand i feel like she gives people like\nthat hope you know and the fact that\nlike\nwhat can happen when you do persevere\nwhen you are relentless when you push\nthrough\nand when you don't let certain people's\nconversations or\nyou know the way they talk to you affect\nyou so i like to think about her\nshe's amazing yeah yeah things probably\nshould have gone another way for her and\nshe made sure they didn't\nabsolutely i love that absolutely i love\nit i love seeing the energy on your face\nfifth and final question what big impact\ndo you want to have on the world\nwhat do you want your legacy to be for\nme um\nyou know through this journey in beauty\nand what we do and as an influencer too\ni want to make sure that people know\nthat there are choices that they they\ncan make\nbut they do not have to be a certain\naspect\nof being they don't have to be a certain\ntype of influence or there's so many\nopportunities\nwe've taken our responsibilities so\nseriously as influencers\nwe always try to show the opposite i\nfelt like when we were coming out it was\nthere was a certain type of influencer\nthere was a certain type of you know\npersonality we always want to be the\nopposite of it you know where\nyou know i may swear like crazy but i\ndon't want to swear in my post i just\nwant to think of it a little bit more\nresponsibly\num you know i may dress a certain way\nbut i'm when i'm in the public i always\ntry to make sure that i'm\nrepresentative of what a woman can be\nyou know and so i think um\ntaking responsibility and trying to show\npeople that you can\nyou know they can be whatever they want\nin the beauty industry like i love to\nsee women who are covering their head\nand just killing it you know there's\njust there's that paradox that you're\ntalking about you know that you can\nstill be so many different kinds of who\nyou are\nand be in the beauty industry no matter\nyou know if you're any different color\nif you have certain\nyou know issues that are holding you\nback like we've worked with you know\nwe've seen like a lot of people have\nburned victims and\npeople you know who don't necessarily\nhave hands sometimes for makeup on but\nthey're doing it\nyeah and it's like i think they're just\nso beautiful like nothing is going to\nstop them and i\nand i hope that we can continue to share\ncontent that proves that and continue to\nbe\nexamples of that as well yeah it's\nreally important to us that's beautiful\nthank you so much yeah we've been\nplacing these limitations like you can't\nbe meaningful if you're in the beauty\nindustry\nor if you're in business you can't be a\ngood person totally the more we place\nthese limits we\nwe live up to them yeah we think oh i\ncan't so who put that there\nyeah i put that there i literally saw\nthem like who made this stuff up\nyou know and it's we buy into stuff that\njust other people made up\njust you know i think it really comes\ndown to starting i think everything\nchanges and i'm sure\nyou know you can attest to this\neverything changes when you change the\nway you think\nand that's like what you need to start\nwith you know asking yourself those\nquestions about\nwho put those limits there yeah why\ncan't you do those things absolutely you\nknow\nso and thank you for being such an\nincredible real model for so many people\nthank you for showing you no no i mean i\nmean it no thank you for being someone\nthat\npeople can look up to in so many\ndifferent ways been an incredible\nentrepreneur\nbeing an incredible influencer and more\nmore than all of that being incredible\nmother too thank you and most important\njob yeah an incredible human who's\nreally setting the standard of how a new\nwave of leaders\ncan be change makers through any\nindustry in the world thank you thank\nyou being a rebel\nyeah rebels are cool right\nthank you to everyone who's been\nwatching and listening this was\na short brief snippet insight into\nhudder's life i'm so excited to dive\ndeeper\nbut i want to make sure she goes and\nspends some time with her daughter too\nthank you\nand so thank you so much for making time\ni am so grateful\nmy honor and i'm excited i spend so much\nmore time definitely building lifelong\nfriendships we're gonna do a lot of\nstuff\nthank you so much hey everyone thank you\nso much for coming back\ni am genuinely so grateful and excited\nto introduce you to our next\nguest she's a recent friend but someone\ni feel like i've known\nforever literally the first time we met\ni believed that she was a kindred spirit\na long-lost friend\nand someone that i immediately and\ninstantly i had a heart connection with\nshe's someone that i'm excited to have a\nfriendship with for the rest of my life\nand her background and experience is\nabsolutely phenomenal\nand you're going to learn so many\nincredible insights about business about\nentrepreneurship but also about\nheart soul purpose meaning passion and\nshe is none other than the global\npresident and co-founder of huda beauty\nher name is mona kittan a true beauty\nphenomenon thank you so much jay you're\nincredible i can't even\nbegin to describe how amazing you are so\nthank you so much thank you this is such\nan honor\nyou're so grateful you're the sweetest\nlike from the moment we met you\nand we literally met in l.a maybe a\nmonth ago now i think so and\nwe got connected through facebook which\nwhich we both worked very closely with\nand when they reached out and said that\nwe wanted to connect i was so happy\nthank you and then when i met you your\nenergy from the moment we met just like\nradiated thank you so much and the\nreason why i'm so excited to share you\nwith my audience is because i believe\nthat\nyou're exactly the type of leader\nentrepreneur and business person\nthat the world needs to admire and look\nup to as a\nthank you so much thank you that's so\nkind yeah thank you\ni would love to help inspire anyone in\nany way i can absolutely so\ni mean the world knows you as an\nincredible beauty phenomenon\nall the incredible work you've done i\nwant to start off by asking you this\nquestion of\nhow do you define beauty and what beauty\nreally means to you\nit's a big question um i do really not\nto sound cliche but i do really feel\nthat beauty starts from within\ni think that in order to feel beautiful\nyou need to feel it inside because no\nmatter how much makeup you have an\namount\nno matter how much symmetry you have in\nyour face how perfect your body your\nhair is you're never going to feel great\nunless you love yourself\nand also i feel like you need to love\nothers as well like you need to just\nhave a happy kind heart\nso it really does start from within and\ni think it's good to take care of both\nparts inside and outside\nto really feel your best and have the\nmost confidence so i really do\nfor myself anyway i like to start from\ninside myself and just make sure that\ni'm happy and i have that inner peace\nbefore i put my makeup on you know\nthat's why first thing in the morning\ni'll put on some meditation music i'll\npray\ni'll really count my blessings before i\neven think about you know makeup and\nhair and everything else that's fun\ni'm not going to say it's not that's my\nsecond favorite part of the day but um\nthe first part starts within\nthat's amazing i love that and for\nanyone who's listening right now i'm\nsure\nyou could listen to mona's voice all day\nwe were just talking about before about\nyou could\nmeditate to your own voice you don't\nmeditate to your own voice no\n[Laughter]\nmaybe i'll try it tell us a bit more\nabout that and when did that\nself-love almost become a part of your\nlife like when did that become a\npriority for you or was it something\nthat\nwas always there and there from your\nchildhood i've always been very\nspiritual\nmy family is very spiritual my mom is\nsuper spiritual she just prays all day\nthat's all she does\nso i've always seen that growing up so\ni've always felt that in order to feel\ncompletely good about yourself and just\nto feel calm in life you need to have\na connection with the higher power\nwhatever it may be\nso i've always prayed for my heart\n[Music]\nso i think that my entire life i've\nalways felt that i need to have that\nconnection but\nit was really i think when i turned\naround 23\n24 that i realized like you really need\nthis it's not an option like for me to\nfeel good i need to have this connection\nso\ni started looking inside out rather than\noutside in and it just changed\neverything\nand was there a specific moment at that\nage or was it just\ngrowing up and starting real real life\nalmost because that's kind of that age\ni think it came to a point where i hit\neverything on my bucket list\nof like checklists of things that i\nwanted to achieve for myself like maybe\noutside and i just didn't feel happy so\ni was like you know there must be\nsomething that i need more than\nthis checklist that i have that society\nkind of creates for you\nso i was like i need to look for\nsomething deeper yeah that's so\ninteresting\ni'm sure we all have these long bucket\nlists yes tell us about your morning\nroutine\nbecause you you kind of touched on it\nthere and the reason why i want to\nunpack that more\nis that's amazing because you lead a\nreally and we'll get to this but you\nlead an extremely busy life you run a\nhuge business\nyou're always traveling all across the\nworld and i'm sure it's not perfect\nall the time as i know for myself as\nwell yeah and that's cool too but\nbut tell us about how you started\nforming that program that morning\nroutine\nof meditation meditational music prayer\netc tell us about what it looks like\nwell to be honest um it didn't really\nget organized until about a year ago\nbefore that it was kind of scattered\nlike i had all the same ideas but i\nwasn't doing it\nin an organized way so it was about a\nyear ago where i just hit this breaking\npoint of like i need some structure in\nmy life\num and i need to feel more calm because\ni just had too much anxiety\nthere was like so much change in the\nbusiness and just\nour family life because we worked\ntogether so it was just constant change\nand i was like i need to find a way to\njust find peace so me and hooded\ntogether we just decided every morning\nwe're going to have like our own little\nhour together where we talk and we\nmeditate\nwe give thanks we count our blessings\nand we really try to manifest as well\nabout our goals and everything that we\nwant to achieve together\nand it really transformed everything we\nplay meditation music\nwe pray and it's about one hour in the\nday and honestly that one hour\nchanges everything it's changed things\nso significantly and\neven our relationship improved because\nwe talk about everything that's on our\nmind and\nwe help each other out so i think having\nthat with someone or\neven on your own it's just important to\nfigure out what's on your mind because\nsometimes you don't know what's on your\nmind\nyeah absolutely you're just like foggy\nand you have no idea why until you just\nget it out\nthat's amazing it's so special so it's\nonly one hour\nthat's a lot of time but um and i don't\nthink\neverybody has to have the same sort of\nstructure but for me it works it's just\nthat one hour where\ni probably do about 20 minutes of prayer\nand\n20 minutes of manifesting and then 20\nminutes of just like talking\nand talking about your problems and\nfinding solutions together and\nit really has worked for me i would like\nto do more but um it's a start\nso it's it's been so transformational\nand i recommend it to\nanyone to try and find that hour they\ncan just dedicate to themselves\nyeah that's so special and and guide us\nthrough if you if you like and you don't\nhave to\nbut that kind of manifestation process\nthat you use for your work because i\nthink people hear this term everywhere i\nthink we talked about it last time\nlike it's become a popular term the\nsecret talked about it a lot\nand there's been so many almost versions\nof it and i'd love to hear about it from\nsomeone who i believe is a very sincere\npractitioner there i feel like\nit's a genuine thing for you i'd love\nfor you to kind of guide us through that\nprocess\nwell for us it's typically just a matter\nof repeating our goals\nevery single day and kind of speaking\nabout them in the present tense\nso we talk about all the things we want\nto achieve as if it's already happening\nand we spend a good 20 minutes on this\nevery single day and i think\nthat makes you feel a lot closer to your\ngoals and it's\nit's funny because we looked back at our\njournals from like a year ago and it's\nlike\ni think 60 to 70 percent have happened\nwhich kind of blew my mind i was like\ncongratulations\nthank you thank you so much and we just\ntry to spend more time speaking about\nour goals and speaking about our\nproblems and it's funny because well\nit's not funny but\nunfortunately a lot of people do the\nopposite they talk about their problems\nprobably 90\nof the time and 10 percent of the time\nthey talk about what they aspire to\nachieve\nand i just think flipping that around\njust changes everything i don't think\nyou should not acknowledge your problems\nbecause we all have them\nbut i think just focus on everything\nthat you want the majority of the time\nand you'll get more of that\nyeah absolutely that's such great advice\nyeah i think that's such great advice i\nthink so much of our lives are totally\nthe opposite you're so right we're\ncomplaining we're comparing we're\ncriticizing we're lost in that\nthat negative world that and then that\nkeeps expanding\nyeah absolutely and something we started\nto do recently is um we just kind of\noutlined all of our goals\nand then under each goal you kind of put\ntogether\n10 steps that could make this happen and\ni'm sure you you've talked about this\nbefore\nand you do this i'm sure but it's just a\nmatter of like finding ways to achieve\nthat faster and\nthe more you look at that piece of paper\neven though it sounds so simple it's\njust the more that will come\ninto reality i feel so it's super simple\ni don't want people to be disappointed\nbecause it's like okay that's it but\nit does make a big difference it's like\nsimplicity is genius right\njust keep it simple keep looking at your\ngoals all day repeat them\nwrite them down 100 times a day if you\nwant to and i just think the more you\ninvest in that\nthe faster they're going to come into\nreality absolutely\nit's beautiful to hear how simple it is\nfor you and\none of my favorite quotes from einstein\nis if you can't explain something simply\nyou don't understand it well enough\nthat's so true and\nand so hearing you explain it that way\nand even though you find it so simple\ni'm glad that it's simple because\neveryone is listening i hope you've got\nyour notebooks and your notepads out\nright now\nbecause this is real advice and i think\nthis is the work that people don't take\nthe time to do\nbut but the beautiful thing about you\nand huda is that not only\nhave you written down your goals\nrepeated them built this\nprayer meditation manifestation morning\nyou also work really hard\nand i think that's sometime often lost\nlike the amount of\nhard work dedication the commitment that\nit takes\nto build something as incredible as you\nhave and and guide us through that as\nwell like the beautiful balance between\nmanifesting and then making things\nhappen like actually turning up\nit is really hard um the crazy thing is\nthat initially we worked hard first\nbefore manifesting so that's where i\nthink we are just putting so much time\nand effort into any\neverything that we did and we didn't\nreally see the results very fast so it\nbecame until\nwhen we started manifesting and working\nhard that we actually saw the results\nfast enough\nbecause i think both of us have just had\nreally high work ethics since we were\nchildren my father\nworked since he was seven years old he\nhelped support his family as a child so\nlike we always saw him being a\nworkaholic and\ntill this day he's retired he's 75 but\nhe just works constantly like\nnow i think he's in michigan helping my\nbrother as p with his phd and i'm like\ndad relax here\nand enjoy yourself he's like no no he\njust wants to work all the time so\ni think no matter what we would have\nbeen doing in life like we'd want to\nwork hard\num it just gives me satisfaction like i\ncouldn't imagine life otherwise\nand again it doesn't mean it has to be\ntied to a job or a number\nit could be working hard in charity it's\njust like feeling that i'm making a\ndifference is so important\nand i mean i like having fun too but i\nactually get more satisfaction out of\nworking\ni can relate to it i'm like on the same\nwavelength it just feels good and i\nthink it's important to have fun while\nyou're working that's like the best\ncombination ever so if you can find\nsomething\nyou know career-wise where you can do\nthat that's great and it's the best but\num\nmy entire life even when i was in\nbanking and i didn't really like my job\ni was working hard i just don't know\notherwise and i think that if you want\nto succeed in anything in life whether\nit's\na career goal a relationship goal health\ngoal or a personal goal you need to work\nyou need to put the effort in yeah you\nknow manifest and put in the effort and\nthen you're going to get magic you're\ngoing to get there\nyou have to be patient but you will get\nthere yeah and i love that i love that\nyou both\nshow the balance and that you've been\nsuccessful through the collaboration of\nboth because sometimes it's either raw\ni notice a lot of individuals or people\nor teams or companies\njust trying to manifest and it's all\nabout prayer it's all about meditation\nbut then wondering why there's no result\nand then the other side is oh we're just\nhustling all right i'm like mom you pray\nall day you need to also\ntake action she's like you know i just\nwant to pray all day like that's\nbeautiful that's beautiful\nyou're such a beautiful soul but i think\nmy dad's the opposite he works all day\nthat's why they work well together\nthat's true i never thought about that\nuntil now but um yeah they're the\ncomplete opposite\nso i think we kind of got inspiration\nfrom the two of them like my mom from\nher spiritual side my dad from this\npractical like let's work hard side\nbut um i think to find the most success\nyou have to do both\nso important i love that that's such a\nbeautiful message too yeah because like\nwe can get lost on either extreme of\nhustle and grind\nor meditation and manifestation and it's\nthe marriage of both\nlike in your parents marriage and\nbringing them both together yeah\nabsolutely i think about a year and a\nhalf ago when we were just\nso busy just keeping up with all the\ncrazy work that we had we were\ndefinitely lost in our hard work we're\nlike a hamster\nand a wheel and we're just constantly\njust keeping up with our to-do list and\nwe didn't really think strategically and\ni think having that time in the morning\nand then also something that one of our\ninvestors told me about she was like you\nneed to schedule in slack time and i was\nlike what is slack time\nand she's like time where you schedule\nnothing and i was like what is that i\ndon't even know what you mean by that\nshe's like you just need to\nput in an hour two hours for you to\nthink and i was like this is interesting\nbut it's so funny because most people\nwho have you know nine to five nine to\nsix\njobs they don't schedule time to think\nyes and\nnow that i do that i find it crazy that\ni didn't do it because you need time to\njust kind of\ndownload all your thoughts download\neverything that you had in meetings and\njust all the progress that you have or\nthe challenges you haven't just think\nabout it\nand reflect and create a plan absolutely\nyeah i often say that\nyou know all of our phones we know when\nour battery is at twenty percent\nand then it gives us an alert at ten\npercent but we don't have that for our\nown check\nlet's see like we don't have that we\ndon't have a signal from ourselves to us\nthat hey you're on ten percent now\nyou're on three percent oh wait you need\nto recharge and and often with our\nwillpower or whatever we maybe we push\npast that recharge\nbut we all know our phones die if they\ndon't get recharged you know they they\nburn out\nwe need an app for that we do we do need\nan app for that that's so definitely\nlike just being able to give us an alert\non our energy levels on our\nmental space i've been taking for the\npast couple of months two days a week\nwhere i'm just being creative which\nmeans i pick up a random book on my\nshelf or i make notes and\nthere's no real agenda for the day\nthere's no goal or deadline\nit's just have space to think and i can\ni can honestly agree that\nthat's made me more effective and\nimpactful when i have to be on all the\ntime right\nso i love that point i never thought\nabout that i'm like i need to check\nmyself\nbecause i don't really pay attention to\nwhen i'm on e or 10\nit's just i i think we've always had\nthat me and hood are both\num we've always had that mentality of\njust work until exhaustion yes\num but yeah i think you should check in\non yourself sometimes\nyeah just just even just sitting and\njust sensing with our body like where am\ni feeling pain or where am i feeling\naches\nwhere am i feeling great where am i\nfeeling good and then the same with the\nmind\nand and i know that in my life i've i've\noften neglected the body by\nfocusing on mastering the mind and then\nyou learn learn the hard way sometimes\nso i need to do more of that it's all\nprogress\ni think this year has really been a year\nof self-awareness for\nboth of us for myself especially i just\nfeel like this year i've learned so much\nabout myself it's been scary tell me\nsomething that you've learned about\nyourself that\nsomething that something that's new and\nsomething that's always been there but\nyou're like oh yeah\num i mean i learned a lot\nand you know it's funny doing the\nreality show coulda asked i wanted to\ntalk about that\nokay let's go yeah it just made me\nrealize that um\nso by the way if you've not seen huda\nbus you have to go and watch it if\nyou're listening or watching this right\nnow you have to\nbecause it's such an authentic reality\nshow\nand it really gives you a snapshot into\nhow hard they work\nhow deeply they work how meaningfully\nthey work so i highly highly recommend\nit but yes please let's\nlet's hear about it where do i start um\ni think one thing i realized was just a\nlot of blockage i had in my life\ntowards um relationships and just dating\nand marriage and things like that um i\ndidn't realize that until the producers\nproducer just started asking me so many\nquestions and i was just like\nnever thought about these things and i\nrealized a lot about my upbringing as\nwell because\nhaving parents from the middle east my\nmom's really conservative like my entire\nlife she was just telling me like\ndating's wrong and like these kind of\nthings are all wrong so my whole life\nhad been programmed to think\noh my gosh if i'm going on a date it's\nwrong you know so i just realized i had\nso much blockage towards that and i was\navoiding\nmeeting people because of that so i\nthink that was the first thing that i\nwas like okay i need to stop\nthinking about getting married\nmy mom's way because it's not going to\nhappen it's just not something i'm\ncomfortable with\nand if i'm not going to do that i need\nto be open to meeting someone on my own\nso\nit was kind of an eye-opener um\nyeah and it just made me realize i put a\nlot of negativity towards men\nin general i was just like no stay away\nbut then i\ndidn't want to arrange marriage so it's\nkind of crazy like you can't\ndo both you have to pick really or merge\nin between but you can't like avoid\nmeeting somebody and then avoid an\narranged marriage and i just think that\nwas something that was really\ninteresting\nyeah that's super interesting and i\nthink so many people from an asian\nbackground\nor an indian background or you know any\nof those backgrounds struggle with that\nand it's so much pressure so much\npressure right there's so much pressure\nand i hear that so often\nwe sometimes feel like the world's moved\non and everyone's more modern now and\nthinks\nmore forward but there are still many of\nus\nand a lot of us who are in that space so\nwhat's your advice to someone who's\nlistening and like\ni'm in that space right now you know\nlike how did you kind of navigate it in\nyour mind with your family with your\nrelationships with that and i love what\nyou said that you'd programmed yourself\nwith a sense of beliefs\nyeah but you deprogrammed yourself i\nthink you first need to get rid of all\nthe negativity because you know love is\na beautiful thing finding a partner in\nlife is a beautiful thing there it's is\na beautiful thing so i think that\nregardless of whatever route you want to\ntake just get rid of all the negativity\nbecause it should be positive you're not\ngoing to attract the right partner if\nyou're thinking\nif you feel guilty or if you think bad\nthoughts so i think remove all of that\nand just start\nfocusing on the goals that you want in\nterms of a partner and just highlight\nlike what's important to you and\nthe values that you want to find because\ni think if you focus on that you're\ngoing to attract people\nwho would work you know and take\neverything you've learned and just\ni think you should just erase it if i'm\nhonest i think all these things that\nwere kind of like middle eastern and\nasians are programmed to believe you\nknow ethnicity\nbackgrounds even religion i mean for me\nit's just i feel like it shouldn't be\nwhat you're searching for i feel like it\nshould be the common denominator of just\nvalues\nand goals in life and how you want to\nraise your children if you know if you\nwant to have some\nso i think focusing on that has changed\na lot\nbecause before i was just like i was\nkind of all over i was like my parents\nwant this\ni want that and i was just scattered all\nover and then i just\nhad blockage it was like nope not\ninterested because it's too complicated\nand i was complicating everything\nand then just opening up to my parents i\nthink that i've realized\nall they really want is for you to be\nhappy like all your parents i think\nno matter where you're from i think even\nif they think\nthey're trying to control you to follow\ntheir footsteps of whatever route they\ntook\nin the end of the day they're only doing\nthat because they think it's going to\nmake you happy\nit's not about a checklist in general i\nmean i'm sure there are some parents who\nstill want you to follow\nspecific traditional things but i think\nthe\nthe the meaning behind it all is just to\nsee you be successful and happy and what\nthey think happiness is\nso yeah i had very honest conversations\nwith my parents and\nthankfully they were very supportive\nyeah and it's\num it's been good it's it's positive i\nhave the blockage removed and i'm just a\nlot more open and i think my energy is a\nlot more open as well\nyeah yeah so that was the first thing i\nrealized i was like i need to stop being\nnegative towards guys\nmen are great and you know i i think\nhaving a partner is important\nit's not a necessity but it's great if\nyou find the right person\ni think it can add a lot of value into\nyour life absolutely yeah and before\ni was still talking to guys but it was\nall very negative\nbecause i had that negative energy\ntowards it had that guilt so i was\nmeeting guys but it was just like the\nwrong kind of guy\nand i think it was all from the blockage\nso get rid of blockage\nno room for blockage in your life in any\narea yeah\nyeah anything else you learned i love\nthat one by the way that's your your\nlevel of self observation and self study\nis beautiful to see\nthank you because just the way you're\nspeaking about and i hope\neveryone listening i really want you to\ntake this seriously everything mona's\nsharing is\nhuge huge takeaways so everything you're\nsharing is so powerful because i feel\nall of us are telling ourselves stories\nin our minds we're blocking our minds\nwith\nso many subconscious thoughts and i'm\noften talking about how like the world's\nfascinated with learning but the real\nneed is unlearning\nlike the real need is to unlearn what we\nbelieve is true because that's like you\nsaid\ncreating what you're attracting in your\nlife yeah so please please please when\nyou're listening to mona on this\non this episode just look at it from\nthat perspective of what in your life\nis blocking you what story in life have\nyou been telling yourself about\nrelationships\nabout someone you're attracted to about\nwork about career\nthat's actually stopping you from moving\nyour moving you forward\nyeah it's very true and learning is a\nbig part of it so i think from the show\nit's just like i need to unlearn a lot\nof things\nbecause you used to watch yourself back\nyeah\nlike who's this person like i just i i\nthink especially in the beginning i just\ngot super uptight\nand it makes fun of me she says i have\nlike pageant princess syndrome\nbecause i was in the pageants as a child\nso i was like really taught to\nbe poised and like you know just pose a\ncertain way carry myself a certain way\nbut i really think that that was kind of\nnegative in a way because i feel like it\nreally taught you to be\ntry to be perfect which i think is just\nso unrealistic and i think that\nyou should never encourage people to be\nperfect you're setting them up for\nfailure almost and you set them up to be\ntoo hard on themselves so that was\nsomething that i realized through the\nshow that\ni need to get that out of my head\nperfect doesn't exist just be your goofy\nfun self\nand you'll be happier people will be\nhappier around you and just\ni learned i needed to loosen up more\nyeah yeah but you're working on it but\nyou all do it so beautifully like i\nalways feel when i'm watching your\nstories i get so happy\non instagram yeah because i feel like\nthere isn't that\nexactly what you said you're being your\nfun and i didn't call you goofy you\ncalled yourself goofy\nlike i don't feel that there's that\nfilter or there's\nthat lens by which you're thinking oh no\nbut this is our brand and etc and i\nthink that's why people love you all so\nmuch\nand and they're attracted to your energy\nbecause it's so\ngenuine and i know the word authentic is\nso overused\nbut i feel like it's transparent and and\nyou're not afraid to\nyeah i like transparent because it's\nlike you're not\nafraid for people to see you as you are\nin that moment\nand and i guess and i'd love to talk to\nyou a bit about that because how do you\nfind it because in\nin one sense beauty and the way the\nmedia has worked with beauty for\nyears and decades has always been about\nperfection\nlike i always joked about this i\nremember i remember\naisles of the makeup side of brands that\nwould say\nget the natural look and i'm like how do\nyou get the natural look like you have a\nnatural look when you wake up\nright and so tell us a bit about how\nyou've managed that balance between\nbuilding this huge incredible beauty\nbrand which is built on\ninner beauty to outer beauty positive\nenergy but how you maintain that balance\nbetween\nnot valuing perfection\nbut but not selling it like not telling\npeople to be perfect\ni think we're really lucky to be to have\nbeen\nsorry i think we're really lucky to have\nhad a beauty start in a time where\nthere's social media because i think\npreviously it just wasn't possible to\nshare the message that\nscars are beautiful beauty marks are\nbeautiful asymmetry is beautiful and\njust\nyou know now is such a special time\nbecause i feel like with social media\neverybody has a voice and that's so\namazing and\neverybody feels like they're included\nbecause in the past it was like these\nbig\nhuge conglomerates decided on what the\nadvertisements would look like and\neverybody thought they had to look like\nthat\nand i think the conglomerates thought\nthat people wanted that\nyeah but they don't realize nobody wants\nthat nobody wants to feel like they have\nto look like a barbie\nyou know that's just it just makes you\nfeel so insecure in so many ways so i\nthink that now because of social media\nwe all celebrate looking different being\ndifferent\nand that's something so special and i\nthink that's something we're super lucky\nto be a part of now where\ncosmetics now are all about celebrating\nyourself and enhancing your own beauty\nyou don't have to be like anybody else\njust be the best version of yourself and\neven if that means some days you don't\nwear makeup at all\nand you just want to be in your pajamas\nand go to the grocery store like that do\nit\ndo whatever makes you feel good because\nconfidence is more beautiful than\nanything um so we're trying hard to just\ncelebrate that message with everybody\nright now um but it is a challenge it\nstill is a challenge you know you get a\nlot of people who say oh i don't look\nlike that and it's like\nwe try so hard to make sure people don't\nfeel like they need to look like anybody\nelse but it's a challenge and it's\ni think something that the beauty\nindustry will always kind of struggle\nwith\nbecause people think it is all about how\nyou look but it really isn't it's about\nhow you feel\nyes and we want to make people feel good\nthat's the goal\nyeah absolutely and you are i hope i see\nthat from the people that comment on\nyour posts\nand all the great new products and lines\nthat you're launching i see that\nlove i i see that genuineness from the\npeople that are following you and\nand inspired by you know i never want to\nmake people feel like they need to look\na specific way and that's another reason\nwhy we try to\npost videos and photos of ourselves\nwithout makeup and looking silly and\nbeing ourselves just like every human\nwould do because i feel like when you\njust show this perfectly\nfiltered photoshopped image people will\nfeel like they need to be that and they\ndon't especially photoshop no\nyeah photoshop i tried to stop\nphotoshopping my photos i still do\nsometimes but like i'm trying\nnot to because i feel like again you're\nselling the wrong message you're just\nmaking people think\nunrealistic thoughts and you know even\nwith other things hood and myself have\nbeen super open about\nplastic surgery just enhancements\nbecause again we don't want people to\nthink\noh we were born this way or we look this\nway naturally like i get my botox and\nfillers on the regular\nmy doctor's on speed dial and i'm like\nif you want to do that too here's what i\ndid and this is my advice but you don't\nhave to\nbut again it's just a matter of being\ncompletely honest because i don't want\npeople to think that oh\nyou know everybody should just be\nblessed with natural good looks\nyou know everybody has potential to look\na specific way and feel a specific way\nand\nyou should just feel good in your own\nskin and if you want help we'll help you\nget there\nyeah if you want to but again we're not\ntrying to encourage people to\nchange themselves but we just want to be\nhonest about\nwhat we do yeah and that's so important\nand that's the best right that's all\nall of us can do is is be honest about\nour choices so that people have that\ntransparency that's amazing\nyeah and that's why i don't know if\nyou've seen but how to sometimes post\nlike her photoshop before and after\nyes um she still puts the photoshop\nphoto but she shows you the before just\nso you know like this has been touched\nup it's just the industry we're in\nyes hopefully one day nobody will\nphotoshop their photos and they'll leave\ntheir stretch marks and everything else\nbut\nright now it's just it's still the name\nof the game but um we try to show the\nbefore and after so you know it's it's\nbeen enhanced\nyeah that authenticity is amazing i\nthink that's\nbeautiful to see that because you're not\nscared or\nfearful of putting yourself out there\nbecause you don't need to do that no\none's asking you to do that\nand i'm happy to see that thank you yeah\ni think the truth\nsets you free yes absolutely it's like\nbecause you feel you're holding on to\nthis thing that people might find out\nand might see and then it's\nuncomfortable completely\nit is it's super uncomfortable and i\nfeel like as well just holding things\nback it's just\nwhen you're super honest about\neverything you just have this lightness\nand this freedom to yourself\nand i feel like that's when you have\nmore creativity or just you don't have\nit's again like the blockage you don't\nhave the blockage\nyeah get it all out yeah absolutely no\nand i read this awesome study the other\nday that was talking about how\nthis is so simple again but i have to\nraise it because\nif you meditate it makes a lot of sense\nthat when you're lying\nyou have to remember the lie and the\ntruth and what that does is it takes a\nmore brain space it takes some more\nbrain energy and it's stress\nstretching you and stretch stressing out\nyour ability\nto recall whereas when you just tell the\ntruth\nand you share the truth then you have\nnothing else to remember and then it\nbecomes simple\nso it just you know even from a\nneuroscientist point of view\nit's just making the brains processing a\nlot easier and then obviously we know\nfrom a spiritual point of view it's\nmaking your\nyeah exactly the fulfillment that's so\ntrue i learned that as a child i think\nthat was the last time i i lied it was\nlike to my parents and i was like i\ncan't do this\nthis is too much stress in life i can't\ni can't carry on but\nno that's a great point um yeah so we\njust want to be honest with everyone and\nagain\ni think the more honest we are with\npeople the more we'll be able to help\npeople\nand that's the ultimate goal you know\nand it's great to create products it's\ngreat to achieve all these\nthese uh records that we've broken in\nterms of selling product and everything\nbut\nthe ultimate goal is to really help\npeople feel better about themselves\nyeah i was reading to reading a lot of\nyour interviews\nand hooters as well before today i\nalways like doing my research and\nhearing things that i haven't heard\nbefore\nand there was a part where huda was\ntalking about how you're just such a\ngood judge of\ncharacter and passions and noticing\npeople's like skills and their potential\nand that's how we worked with huda too\nwhen you first started out like you felt\nthat she was\nso in love with beauty and her passion\nwas there tell us about that\nthat journey because i think i think a\nlot of people struggle with a\nidentifying themselves but not only have\nyou identified your own you're helping\nother people identify theirs\nyeah well i mean i think similarly to\nyou like my whole life i kind of grew up\nwith tony robbins and all these really\ninspirational\num mentors i never met him but i feel\nlike he's my mentor anyway\nyou're my mentor now though i think\nyou've replaced everybody i just watch\nyour videos all day you should just call\nme\nyour shoes i know that you're busy so\ni'm just like i just watched your videos\nhonestly from now on and this is i'm\nsaying it on the record thank you\nplease thanks you're so great thank you\nbut you know so i just always used to\nwatch um tony robbins he was like a big\none for me i think i started listening\nto his videos at like 14 when i went\nthrough a hard time\nand um it was just the thing i always\nnoticed\nhim repeating was passion and i was like\nwhat do people have passion for and i\nwould always watch people and just\nnotice like when their eyes would light\nup and when they'd spark and\nfor heda specifically it was beauty you\nknow she would always spend all of her\nfree time talking about makeup and\nbeauty products and\none day i was just staring at her it was\na little while after she lost her job\nand\nshe was just trying to figure things out\nand just try to figure out what she\nwanted to do in life and\nat that time she had left her job in\nfinancial recruitment and she was just\nlike looking for another job like that\nthat my parents would be happy with and\nyou know another job that would take a\nbox of like okay my daughter's\nsuccessful because she's filling\nyou know a job that everybody expects\nher to have\nand none of us thought outside of that\nbox\nand one day i just stared at her and i\nwas like you need to do beauty like i've\nnever seen\nanyone so passionate about makeup and\nbeauty and just\nthat creative part of your life you love\nit so much and i just started staring at\nher it was kind of weird and i was like\ni had this like epiphany\nand i was like you have to do this and i\nwent downstairs and i started talking to\nmy parents i was like you guys have to\nsupport her like\nhelp her just give her that support and\nthen she went down and she told them the\nsame thing and\nthey were just super supportive it was\nthe most bizarre thing because my entire\nlife my dad has been very pro-education\nyou need to do your bachelor's your\nmaster's your phd\nand then another phd like he's just gone\nthat route for himself so\ni didn't expect them to be cool about it\nand they totally weren't and like a week\nlater she was in l.a\nstudying beauty it was kind of surreal\nwow\nand you transitioned also from banking\nso yeah\nhow did you feel when you were leaving\nthe traditional success\nyeah pathway it was really hard for me\nit was harder because i quit i didn't\nget fired so it was like i made the\ndecision to like\nclose that chapter and leave and it was\nso hard i knew i had to because i knew i\ndidn't want to do it but i\nactually i didn't even tell my boss in\nperson i sent an email and my sister\nalia had to press the send button\ni drafted it and i was so nervous that\nmaybe i'm making a mistake that i was\nlike i can't do it please send the send\nbutton\nand she sent it right away and i was\nlike no i didn't mean right now i was\nlike let's talk about it but she said\nwere you just waiting there for the\nresponse i was so nervous\nand um i thought oh my gosh i just\nscrewed myself like i'm\ni don't know what i'm going to do now\nwhat am i going to do for like my life\nand um it was definitely really hard but\ni knew in my heart that it wasn't\nsomething that i had passion for\num and i was still figuring myself out\nso\ni didn't start working in beauty right\naway i went into pr and business\nconsulting\nwhich helped me a lot it taught me so\nmuch about just starting your own\nbusiness and just\nmarketing yourself and just the way pr\nworks because i had no idea about it i\nstudied finance so it was\nall like new information for me but um\nit definitely helped me learn\na lot that helped us with huda beauty\nand another business that i started i\nhad a business before we went into\nthe beauty um i had the doll house yeah\nso that was a great experience and i\nlearned so much\nand it also taught me i'm not saying\nbusiness is easy but it taught me how\nnot hard it is you know it's not\nunachievable if you put your mind to it\nanything is possible and i think just\nhaving that\nthat smaller success with the dollhouse\nmade me realize okay anything's possible\nlet's put our minds together\nand let's create what you want and i saw\nthat huda you know um\nher passion with beauty and then i just\ntold her like we need to start a lion\nfor you\nbecause you have so much input on every\nproduct\nshe's the biggest critic she's a\nperfectionist so\ni know that she could improve standards\non everything so we started first with\nthe lashes and\nagain it was just i think building\nyourself with small\nsuccesses helps you get the confidence\nfor the big ones so\njust experiment that's what i did i just\nstarted experimenting and to be honest i\nwas like a serial entrepreneur\na lot of them were failures thank god\nthey weren't big ones they were small\nthings and you know i just think\nlearning from all those failures teaches\nyou so much yeah\nand we still we still have challenges\nall the time we have so many hiccups\nall the time like at least once a week\nthere's like oh my god\nwe're gonna have to close down this is a\ndisaster but like you just realize from\nyour experience in the past you're like\nokay we got through that we can probably\nget through this\nlet's pivot put our minds together and\nfind a solution\nand um yeah it's been a crazy crazy\njourney\nyeah i saw that episode where you talked\nabout how you'd lost two million or\nsomething like that and i was like wow\nyou put this on an episode i was just\nlike\nthat's that's why i was just like wow\nyou guys are really transparent and it's\nand\nagain it it's it's great for people to\nsee the reality of it because it's so\neasy\nfor us to sit back and be like oh mona\nand her they just have amazing lives and\ntheir lives are incredible and\nyou know there's no challenges anymore\nand but then when you put that out and i\nwas like wow\nand and it's great for people to see you\ndealing with that moving through that\nyeah it was embarrassing like sometimes\ntalking about your failures it's\nembarrassing sometimes you're like oh\ngosh it's you don't want the whole world\nto know you messed up\nand you know sometimes it's simple\nmistakes that have such a huge\nrepercussion especially the bigger you\nget\nthe more those small mistakes make such\na big impact and\nit can be really negative but we spoke\nto our investors about it beforehand\nand they gave us their blessing they're\nlike okay if you really feel like you\nwant to share this\nthis is who you are share it and we're\nlike okay great so\nwe just want to be super honest and\nagain like we want people to know\nwe're achieving this but anyone can in\nany area whether it's beauty fashion\nanything food whatever it is just put\nyour mind to your passion\nand um just keep going never give up two\nquestions if someone's\nout there and they're struggling to find\ntheir passion this is something i'm\nsuper passionate about myself if\nsomeone's struggling to find their\npassion what's the first thing that they\nshould do what's your advice\nwhere do they start it's hard\nbecause i think i've even struggled with\nthis before and i feel like to a certain\nextent i still feel this way because\ni love what i do but i still feel many\ntimes there's things that are missing\nout of my life so\ni think you should just spend a lot of\ntime on your own and that's something\ni've been doing for the past year i'm\nlike i need to spend time with myself to\nfigure out like\nwhat makes me tick what keeps me excited\nwhat what would you do for free like\nwhat would you do if there was\nno payment you know i think that's how\nwe should all live our lives and\nfigure that out and then just try to\nspend the most amount of time doing that\nand then before you know it you're going\nto make a life out of it hopefully\nsomething that can cover your expenses\nand more and that you can impact the\nworld with but i think that\njust figuring out what makes you tick\nand what excites you like when you're\nexhausted and you have no sleep what do\nyou think about\num not people not not the drama because\nsometimes i feel like when we're tired\nwe think about the drama but like think\nabout\nyour dreams like if you were five years\nold again and you were just daydreaming\nabout what you wanted to be when you\ngrew up what would that be\nand just find a way to make that happen\nas crazy as that sounds if you know that\nsuperman find out why did you want to be\nsuperman you know or yeah\nif you want to be a mom why did you want\nto be a mom do you like taking care of\npeople like what is it so\nfind out what gets you excited yeah\nthat's great advice\nyeah i always thought that meaning and\nhappiness to me is how you feel about\nyourself\nwhen you're by yourself and that's why\nyou've got use of being alone is so\nimportant sometimes because\nwhen we're not alone we fill the gaps\nwith different things or we find\nthings that make us feel happy or give\nus pleasure or joy or whatever it may be\nand you can almost mask yourself from\nfinding what it really is whereas when\nyou're on your own\neven though it can be uncomfortable to\nstart with as i'm sure it was\nlike it's just like oh no and but but it\ndoes start to make you think okay how\ncan i be happy\nwith myself by myself and start that\njourney\nit's very true it was about two years\nago i kind of realized i need to spend\nmore time with myself and\ni think everybody should do it but it\nwas super\nlonely and i got kind of depressed\nbecause i really just kind of took\nmyself\nout of everything and just really spent\ntime alone\nbut i did realize so many things i was\ndoing wrong in life and i just kind of\nre-centered myself\nso i recommend it to everyone like have\nat least a\nfour-hour session at one period once a\nweek by yourself\nyeah yeah no yeah and it's great advice\ni highly recommend it too i think it's\nuncomfortable\nit is i think i think especially we live\nin a world where it's like loneliness is\nseen as bad because isolation and\nloneliness have increased so much\nbut that a lot of that is because we\ndon't know how to be alone\nand and i think that's great advice\nespecially for people entrepreneurs\nbusiness people who i think\nfeel like they have to be networking all\nthe time or have to be out and about all\nthe time\nbut to take that pause press pause so\nmuch power and slowing down\nbecause then you get faster but not from\nbeing busier you just get more strategic\nso just slow down everything's gonna be\nfine i remember once when i was\ni think it was about a year and a half\nago my friends kidnapped me they took me\non a\na birthday surprise they're so amazing\nthey saw me working like a crazy person\nand they're like you really need a\nholiday\num so they took me to sri lanka and it\nwas a point right before we got\ninvestors so it was like\nliterally on emails from when i woke up\nto when i slept it was\nprobably the most insane part of my life\nand i remember one of my friends was\nsaying she was like okay if you don't\nanswer the email what's gonna happen i\nwas like um\npeople are gonna be upset it's not good\nbusiness and then she's like then what's\ngoing to happen and i was like it's\ngoing to make me have less opportunities\nand she's like if\nshe just kept asking that question then\nwhat will happen and i was like i don't\nknow\nit's just like you're not going to die\nright and and i was like i know maybe\nand she's like and then what will happen\nand i was like i guess i die\nand then you just realize like we we\nbuild everything up to be so\nbig in our heads when really it's not\nyou know um you just need to be calm and\njust\nrealize no matter what happens you're\ngonna deal with it and just get rid of\nthat anxiety of the pressure that we put\non ourselves\nif you're listening and watching to this\ni hope you're nodding as much as i am\nbecause it's yeah it's it's\nsuch the sense of karma i can feel it in\nyour voice and your energy\nthat it's it's not a good tip and i want\neveryone to know that like i'm sitting\nwith money right now like it's not a\ngood tip it's not just\na smart thing to do it's like she's\nreally practicing this i'm trying yeah\nmoments where it gets too much anxiety\nand i catch myself i'm like why am i\nanxious i need to calm down\neverything will be okay like no matter\nwhat you're going through it'll be okay\nlike there's always a solution no matter\nwhat so you just need to calm yourself\ndown so you can\nfind the solutions because you can't\nfind solutions when you're nervous and\nwhen you're\nstressed out and you're just yeah that's\nthe point\nthere you go that's a beautiful point\nyeah when you're when you're stressed\nout you're nervous all that anxious\nenergy that's not going to move you\nforward\nyou usually move backwards because you\nmake bad decisions decisions out of fear\ntheir decisions out of stress and\nanxiety so i really i think it's been\nabout a year now where i've just\nslowed down and i'm just really trying\nto catch myself every time i sense the\nanxiety i'm like i need to take a\nbreather\njust meditate and just pray amazing yeah\nthank you for those amazing amazing\nreminders i wanted to talk to you about\nyour new fragrance\nuh because i know you're very excited\nabout it did you guys get it\nno no no i'm excited to get it you're\nsupposed to get it\ni started looking into it because it's\nso exciting what i loved was your kind\nof deep dive into the research of\nfragrances\nyeah and but but you love fragrance and\ni think a lot of people want to\nbuild fragrances or have a cool idea or\nwhatever it is but you do the work\nlike tell us about the process of\ncreating a fragrance thank you\nit's been very interesting to be very\nhonest like i decided\nprobably about eight years ago seven\nyears ago that i wanted to create a\nfragrance because\ni've been a fragrance junkie since i was\nlike\n18 probably and since then all my money\nthat i made\nfrom working i would save up everything\njust to buy perfume and i was like this\nisn't working out for me i'm so broke\nand like every dollar i saw that video\nwith your wardrobe yeah it's been an\nexplanation\nfrom like years like over 10 years or\njust and i don't throw them out i keep\nthem i just love them so much they're my\nbabies\ni know that sounds crazy um but i just i\nlove fragrance and again it's because of\nthe feeling it gives me i think that\nwith perfume it really shifts your mind\nand your emotions and it makes you feel\na certain way\nso like for myself when i put on amber\nor something like\nmusky i feel like confident i feel\nstrong if i put on rose i feel feminine\nand\njust different um so i think that using\nit as a mood shifter is really important\ni think it makes a difference um yeah so\ni just wanted to make people\nfall in love with the feeling they get\nfrom fragrance it's not about how you\nsmell it's about how you feel again\nand that's something that we try to do\nwith our beauty products it's just about\nmaking you feel your best\nand um i don't know why for me perfume's\nalways been something that makes me feel\nbetter like i don't want to say this\nbecause i don't have to see but if i\nhave to choose between makeup and\nfragrance i would definitely choose\nfragrance\nshould we edit that out i don't know\nmaybe\ni think she knows but i'm not sure okay\nyou're heading for that\nyeah i would definitely choose fragrance\nany day um\nso yeah it was an interesting part\nproject tell us about this fragrance\nso k ali um it's a new line completely\nnew line and we do want to create\na new lifestyle around fragrance so\nthere's a lot coming out next year which\nwe're super excited about\nthere's going to be a lot more body care\nand other things that are going to be um\ndifferent i can't say too much because\nit will kill me she's very like\nthat's the better way of doing it yeah\nbut we have a lot of things coming out\nnext year to just really make people\nfall in love with fragrance and teach\nthem about our tradition as well and i\nthink it's\nsimilar in india as well where people\nare very into the oils the horror the\nincense\nyes the ood so i think that just making\nthat more\nglobal is part of our goal we we've\nalways tried to make everything that we\nrelate to\nmore understandable on a global level\nbecause i think there's so much beauty\nto the way\nwe we appreciate fragrance so i hope\nthat people around the world\njust experience it and if they like it\ncontinue if they don't at least they've\nlearned about our culture and i think\nit's gonna be fun yeah that sounds great\ni i remember even when i was a monk\nand i talk about this a lot about how\nyou know\ndiet isn't just what you eat it's what\nyou smell it's what you hear\nit's what you think about it's what you\nsee and i feel that so much\nof so many cultures are so rich\nin controlling the senses or giving the\nsenses\nanother feeling like a scent can\nliterally change your mood\nin an instant like you know we the best\nexperience anyone listening or watching\nhas is of good food\nwhen you smell good food it changes how\nyou feel it also makes you angry it\nmakes you want to eat and so\nwe're so not adept at being aware of our\nown senses and how they feel\nand i know when i walk into a space that\nis beautiful music on or has a beautiful\nscent\nagain i can feel relaxed in an instance\nit's why we all love spas and\njacuzzis and massa because there's\nthere's an experience for the senses so\nabsolutely and i feel that i'm so happy\nthat you feel that way too because like\nsometimes i think it's just like a girly\nthing\nbut that's great that you feel it as\nwell because i feel the same way i feel\nlike\nhaving the right scent around you even\nif it's your home yourself\nyour hair whatever it does make you feel\nstronger or\nhappier sleepier or whatever it is\nit's aromatherapy so i feel like it\nreally does work um\nanother interesting thing as well as i i\nreally think that\nfragrance kind of gives you a bookmark\ninto your life at that moment because\nthe first time you smell a fragrance\ni feel like that is now going to be what\nyou remember every time you smell that\nin the future\nso i feel like giving the gift of\nfragrance that's why i love receiving it\nas a gift because i'm like when i open a\nnew fragrance and all the times that i\ngot them in the past\nit's like i would immediately remember\nthat point in my life every time i smell\nit again so i just\nthink giving that as a present is so\nnice if you can find something i'm\nexcited now you're going to bookmark a\nmoment in my life yes\nwe're gonna have to find out which\nfragrance she doesn't have that's gonna\nbe our\njob i love that yeah that's such a i\nlove that a fragrance is bookmarked\nlike a scent anyway whatever it is it's\nlike if you can just\ntake it in deeply and just really smell\nit and just remember that moment\nevery time you smell that in the future\nand if it's years later you're going to\ngo back and you're going to think of\nthat and\nmy one of my best friends in university\nshe gave me the most beautiful fragrance\nthat i still wear to this day and every\ntime i smell it i think of her\nyeah and i think of that moment when we\nwere in university just\ntwo very inexperienced girls just loving\nlife\nand just buying perfume i'm like oh\nadolescence\nbefore the stress and everything but\nthat's how i feel about sandalwood paste\nso sandalwood paste is is very commonly\nused in in the tradition i was a monk et\ncetera for markings on the body\nand it's so true that whenever i smell\nthat i literally can transport myself\nback to\nthose moments yeah so you're so right so\npowerful yeah absolutely yeah\nso i want to share that with the world\nand just make people fall in love with\nit because i feel like\ni feel like beauty is really it really\ngets its moment passion gets its moment\nother things get their moment but\nfragrance i feel like it's really been\nneglected\nyou're like representing i'm like no we\nneed to follow the minority of\nfragrances and just really i want to\neducate people about it as well and just\neducate them about the oils the raw\ningredients\num the manufacturer we work with here\nmanish they're super careful about how\nthey\nhow they source ingredients and they're\nsustainable as well so if they pick\nroses they plant roses\nif they take vanilla they they invest in\nthe vanilla fields so it's\nit's important really important it's\nvery important to me that the people we\nwork with are careful with what they're\ndoing in the planet\nyeah absolutely yeah i read that so i'm\ngoing to move into the final five\nminutes which are our final five\nquestions\nand one so great have you enjoyed it\nyou've been amazing like literally\ni was like sir i had so much anxiety\nthis morning and i was like i don't know\nbut then i was like calm down\nit's gonna be great jay is amazing we're\nfriends and this is going to be awesome\nyou're so amazing to talk to you\noh you're the best yeah i know you are\nyou're so amazing you're like sharing so\nmany incredible insights i'm like\ni'm taking mental notes right now and\ni'm hoping everyone at home is taking\nnotes\nor wherever you are at work wherever\nyou're listening watching because\nyou've shared so many great insights\nlike honestly so not like it's not from\nyour videos\nno no no no it's not don't do that\ndon't say that i love your videos i've\nbecome so obsessed recently to be honest\ni found you\ni think on ig october last year 2017. i\nthink that was the first time\nbut recently i've been overdosing on j\nshedding\nand i've actually fallen asleep to your\nvideos and then i'm like okay this is a\nbit\nweird because i'm friends with them now\nbut\nbut you're so amazing you're so\ninspirational really you're my new role\nmodel like i got asked in an interview\nthe other day i mean\ni still love tonya evans if you're out\nthere but you're like the new one\ni'm like j shetty is the man you're like\nyou're the sweetest and i want you to\nknow that you can literally call me up\nthank you\ni'm not even just saying that you have\nto you have to test it now you're so\nsweet\nappreciate that no we we've yeah we fall\nin love with you it's\nyou're definitely i was thinking about\nthanksgiving i was thinking about all\nthe people that i met this year\nand and you know you're definitely\nwithout a doubt like in the top\none but you know just just\nyeah it's just been so one it's just\nbeen it's so rare\nand we were talking about this as you\nget older and if everyone's listening\ni'm sure you feel this as you get older\nit's so hard\nto make real friendships and we live\nbusier lives as we get older we're all\nbusier with work and business and family\nand whatever it may be\nand so to find people that you're like\noh wow i would i think they'd make time\nfor me and i'd make time\nyou know that feeling is so rare and i\nlove feeling that\nyeah so when i get that feeling now\nabsolutely\nthat's true yeah but i've got five\nquestions left i'm not letting you go\nyeah yeah so so so these are my\nquestions the first one was yeah i've\nread\nthat you're fascinated by agriculture\nand the environment\nand so tell us about why that's such an\nimportant area for you to want to learn\nabout\nthis is something that i also feel\nguilty about to be honest because i was\ntelling you like i have my passion for\nthe beauty industry it's great but i\nalways feel like there's something\nmissing and\ni feel like the world needs our help and\ni haven't found my way yet and i feel\nkind of guilty sometimes i don't want to\nfeel guilty because it's wrong but i\nfeel like i need to put more effort into\nit because i'm not educated enough on\nthe environment\nand also agriculturally like what the\nworld needs but i feel that\nyou know i love giving people confidence\nbut\nalso what is it going to be worth if the\nplanet's in trouble\nso for myself i would love to dedicate\nmy future years of my life to helping\nthe planet\nand i'd love to start now to be honest\nso if you find something interesting a\nnew initiative i am\ni'm ready to support and i think that\nyou know people\nlike yourself like let's work together\nto find some solutions because the\nplanet needs our help and\nit's for the future you know it's maybe\nnot for ourselves but\nyou know it's for the kids yeah yeah i\ndon't want them to grow up in a world\nthat's\nunhealthy and trees and everything i\nthink\nthe condition of just the animals and\nthe plants i just want to see people\nhave a great beautiful life and i want\nto leave the planet better than we\nentered it that's such a that's such a\nbeautiful way of putting it and\ni i get really fascinated and so happy\nwhen\nall of us have our thing that we love\nand we're successful and\nbut then using that as an energy to say\nactually i'm going to make time to serve\nthe planet back and think about another\nspace\ni think that's such a wonderful\nresponsibility i remember it was\nmuhammad ali who said that\nservice to others is the rent we pay for\nour room here on earth\nit's so true yeah and it's just such a\nbeautiful sentiment and i love it\nbecause\ni always think of them like yeah like\nhow can we serve the planet we take so\nmuch from the planet\nlike mother earth is just giving giving\ngiving giving giving\nand and to want to give back is just\nsuch a noble noble belief\nwhen i was when i lived as a monkey we\nhelped build this eco village so this\neco village is a sustainable village\nthat shows\nwhat village land could look like and\nshould look like\nfrom a sustainability point of view in a\nway that can maintain most of the planet\nthat's like that so we need to go there\ntogether first\nyeah it's just built on biotechnology\nand\nthe the cutting edge technology that's\nbringing together eco living\nand and humanity so we've definitely got\nto figure that out yeah i feel\ni feel bad about that because i do feel\nlike i'm not doing enough um me too\ni met somebody yesterday at the gala\nwith the bos gala\nand they're working on cosmetic\npackaging that's recyclable\nand reusable so i'm trying to find\nsomething i could do business-wise\nand then there was this incredible woman\nshe's actually a dame she got um\nshe became a name for the queen her name\nis ellen kind of last name though but\nshe's also working on just\nreducing plastic consumption in the\nworld and also helping people who do\nproduce plastic\nto make it more unrecyclable and\neverything so i feel there's a big space\nfor\nimprovement um but i hope that we can do\nsomething\nand i would love to learn more about the\nvillage and see what what can we do to\nmake this cool\nabsolutely and make people want to be a\npart of it totally yeah\nno 100 okay beautiful answer we're going\nto do that we're going to fix it it\nneeds our help\nit does we're going to figure it out\ntogether i hope so absolutely we have to\nwe have to yeah it's not even a choice\nyeah we have to\ni'm now moving from my extremely deep\nand meaningful topic to something\nfunnier and lighter because because it's\nit's you i love paradoxes i love people\nwho can represent like\ncan laugh and then be serious and change\nthe world but also you know and and i\nthink that's important for our wellness\nbut you're a huge karaoke fan oh my god\ni am yeah\nand and so you were nervous to come on\nhere but you're so the first person that\ngrabs the mic when it comes to karaoke i\nam\nwatching a microphone do\n[Laughter]\nwhen it comes to karaoke i have a\nterrible singing voice by the way even\nfunner oh yeah is it yeah\nokay okay for us okay yeah yeah for you\nbut uh yeah tell us about your what's\nyour favorite karaoke song and when was\nthe last time you went\num okay so what could be your idol\npartner actually let's do that\num probably huda okay we love to sing\ntogether ever since we were children she\nwould make me sing every disney song\nwith her\nbut she'd always make me be the boy so\nlike now\nand it's so annoying you'd\nbut also i'm like no now you have to be\nthe boy i want to be jasmine but she\nstill doesn't let me\nbut i'd probably go with huda worse we\nlove singing and i think it's such a\ngood stress release actually\nlike i feel like every time i just sing\nmy heart out i feel so much\nlighter yeah you get all that energy out\nyeah\nyeah and you also make fun of yourself\nso it's good well you're going to make\nfun of me now it sounds like yeah\nyeah we left what would be your song\nthat is so hard for me karaoke was never\npart of my life\ngrowing up so it's such an alien thing\nto me and i remember going through\nto a few work events when it was a thing\ni remember one of my friends doing an\nelvis song\nand he absolutely rocked it every guy\njust stepped back like all of us were\njust like okay no we would see people\nthat are really annoying to sing with he\nwas he was so he was incredible ollie\nriley if you're listening to this or\nwatching this\ni will never forget that performance in\nchicago he literally grabbed the mic\nhe was dancing with all the girls he was\nincredible and every guy just went okay\nno yeah i think one of my friends\nfollowed up with eminem i'd do an eminem\nsong i guess\ni was a huge eminem fan when i was\ngrowing up yeah that was my like passion\ngrowing up\nso i could do that i can rap i won't\nsing okay yeah\nwell i'm down you need to go i love it\nokay awesome\nthe third question i wanted to ask you\nis\nwhat's your biggest challenge right now\nand what are you doing to work through\nit\nthat's a lot it's a big one\n[Music]\nmy biggest challenge right now i would\nprobably say\njust finding more purpose you know that\nkind of haunts me\nsometimes i'm like okay i do feel that\nguilt again and i'm just trying to\ntransform it from guilt into action so\ni'm trying to figure out what can i do\nthat's\nmore meaningful in life because i love\nwhat i do and i don't want anyone to get\nit wrong like i\ni have passion for what i do but i need\nmore yeah\nand so i think just figuring out what\nthat more is and how i can make that\nhappen it's something that i still\nhaven't worked out myself yeah\nyeah so we're gonna do that we're gonna\ndo that because that's my fact\nthat's literally my passion and purpose\nare just my favorite words\nyeah and favorite experiences and\ni totally believe that purpose is\nsomewhere that everyone should want to\nget to and\ninstead of feeling guilt i really feel\nyou've planted the intention and the\nseed\nof wanting to find it and that's the\nperfect start\nyeah like not having done it up to and\nfirst of all first of all for everyone\nwho's listening moana does plenty of\npurpose\nwork like plenty of work like i i\nrecently asked her to support some work\ni was doing with youtube\netc and she was just wanting to support\nit so first of all you do\na lot of great work for the world and\nand so it's not something you're not\ndoing but i do believe i i totally get\nwhat you're saying\nand and yeah don't feel guilty about it\ni think i feel guilty a lot\nand i think maybe that's something i\nneed to work on and like in general i\nthink it's that\nguilt towards not helping people enough\nbut even with myself like\nit's my natural reactions to feel guilty\nlike i'm not doing good enough or i'm\nnot working hard enough i'm\nnot achieving enough i'm not being good\nenough to people like i just want to do\nmore for everyone\nyeah so i think that's my biggest\nchallenge and i'm trying to work on that\nbut\nthank you for sharing that so openly\nyeah i think that's quite a big part of\nmiddle eastern and asian culture too\nyeah your parents make you feel guilty\nabout everything everything right yeah\neverything you're 99 right yeah yeah\nyeah exactly so i think that's something\ni need to unlearn\nyeah definitely so we can work on that\ntogether yes that would be awesome i'd\nlove that that would be so fun to do\nand so that was the that was the third\nquestion fourth question is what's the\nbest advice you've ever received\noh um i don't know\nit's so hard or anything that stays in\nyour mind or a mantra\nor something that you repeat to yourself\nthat kind of holds you when\nwhen you need it well one mantra that i\nlove i think it's significant to myself\nand huda just because we have such\nhungry appetites for progression\nis that every delay has a blessing it's\nan arabic saying it's\ntrue and it's just yeah and i think that\nwe one of the biggest struggles we had\nin life is just being patient because\nyou want so much and you work so hard\ntoo it's not like we just want so much\nwe're also working so hard so not seeing\nthings\nhappen fast enough was always\nfrustrating and that frustration would\njust drain you\nso getting rid of that just saying\nthere's a reason for this be patient\nunderstand that you're going to look\nback and you're going to be so grateful\nthat things worked out exactly that way\num it's really changed the way i feel\nabout every\nevery crazy thing that happens every\nweek you know every week there's\nsomething that doesn't work out and i'm\nlike\nevery delay has blessing it's okay so\nthat's helped me a lot\nthat is a real gift you've given me\ntoday because i i've thought of that\noften and i've had that reflection and\nrealization often\nbut i've never found the right words to\nsay it in so\nyeah my words have always been don't\njudge the moment so i never judged the\nmoment because\nlike you said like that could turn out\nto be the best thing in the world\nbut uh but that's that's a really\nbeautiful gift thank you for sharing\nthat with me yeah\ni love yours too because i think we\nalways do we do label it\ncompletely and i'm trying to like get\nout of myself and just to like look down\nand see like what is going on\nand just try not to judge what i'm in\nbecause i think that um\nwe all kind of do that like whenever we\nhave a problem we become so absorbed in\nit\nand then we forget about all the\nrationale we have yeah yeah and we get\nso emotional about it so now i'm trying\nto not judge the situation and\njust try to like use my analytical brain\na bit better\nyeah but it's hard it's just the plan\nyeah absolutely yeah absolutely\nmy fifth question is is there anything\nthat you intuitively feel that you want\nto share with my audience that you\nhaven't said today that there's\nsomething and you're just like\nthis is calling to me because you're\nsuch a intuition and heart based\ni person we're going to change the world\njay i think you guys need to keep\nwatching jay i think you're going to do\nso many incredible things and i think\nthat you're going to be\nyou know something that well you already\nare but i think you're just going to\ncontinue to do so much greatness for the\nworld and i think everybody just needs\nto keep watching and sharing and\ntelling their friends about you and i\nthink that people like you are so\nimportant because you know i mean i'd\nalways talk about this people want to be\nthe next beauty influencer people want\nto be the next reality star\nfashion model or fashion designer but we\ndon't have enough people who are like\nwanting to serve the world whether it's\nin\nhelping people through spirituality and\njust life coaching or like\ndoctors and things like that so i think\npeople like you have such a strong voice\nyou do it so well you're so eloquent you\njust\nyou really make me i can't stop watching\nyour videos\nyou know in all honesty i put them on\nand i'm like i'm gonna watch one before\nbed

for me when i found out about your\nheart behind the success you've had\ni was just like yes this is what we need\nin the world because\nas it's the same way you feel that we\nneed change makers and people who are\nleading that way\nwe also need people who are doing what\nmajority of the world inspires to do\nbut doing it so differently and and\ndoing it in a way that's\nthat really makes you a real model for\npeople to follow thank you\nwe would love so help support you in any\nway because you know i feel like\nhaving great people like you i think a\nlot of people feel the way we feel like\nwhere you're dedicating your life to\nsomething that\ni'm not going to say it's superficial\nbut a lot of it is and there's that\nemptiness that you feel so i think\nhaving someone like yourself who can\nbe that person who's actually dedicating\nyour entire life to greatness\ni think that's so beautiful and just\nhaving more awareness of people like\nyourself\nand the causes you stand for it's\nimportant because a lot of people don't\nknow what they can do to help and it\ncould be something so simple and\ni think a lot of people want to feel\nbetter and feel\nlike they're doing something more\nmeaningful so you're amazing\ni'm so excited to take the word together\nin a good way\nthank you so much mona you're amazing\nthank you so much please go find her\nfollow us share this
