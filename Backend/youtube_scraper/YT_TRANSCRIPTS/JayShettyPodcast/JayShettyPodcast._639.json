so much for making\nthis commitment to learning\nand listening about work life and love\nand today's episode is going to be a\nreal treat for each\nand every single one of us our guest\ntoday needs no introduction\nhe's an incredible thinker in this space\nhe has been\ninspiring us for decades and\nhe's the co-founder of the chopra center\nfor well-being\nand the chopra foundation and has\nwritten over 86\nbooks on health wellness medicine\nand several of them are new york times\nbestsellers today's guest is none\nother than deepak chopra i know so many\nof you are so excited for this episode\ni know so many of you have been looking\nforward to us sitting down together\nagain deepak thank you so much for being\nhere thank you\ni'm so grateful for this opportunity i\nwas just sharing with you earlier\ni had the opportunity and the fortune to\nmeet you three years ago in new york\nand i was interviewing you for two of\nyour books at the time radical beauty\nand you are the universe\nand when i met deepak i want everyone\nwho's watching and listening to know\nthis\ni'd heard so much about him i'd read his\nbooks because my father used to read his\nbook so they'd be in my house since i\nwas a young\nyoung boy and when i met him the most\nfulfilling feeling\ni got to experience was that he wanted\nme to succeed\nand he wanted me to succeed because i\nwas trying to help others\nand he was so encouraging and so\nsupportive that i felt that\ngenuine energy of love and encouragement\nand empowerment from him so your\nblessings have been\nthank you very important in my life your\nsuccess is very important for\neveryone yeah well thank you it's not\njust about you absolutely 100\nfor me it's not at all and so we're very\ngrateful to have you today thank you\nand today i'm very excited because you\ninterviewed me two days ago\nand you were sharing that you can't wait\nto talk about your past in your journey\nwhich i think will be really\nilluminating for my audience\nand let's go all the way back new delhi\ni believe is where it all began\ni was born immediately\nbefore india's independence\nfrom british colonialism so\ni'm frequently referred to as one of\nmidnight's children\nyou'd know that phrase coined by\nsalman rushdie so it refers to all of us\nwho are kind of at the cusp of\nthe old era of colonialism and\nindependent india\nand my father was an army doctor he was\nactually\nin the war when i was born so he wasn't\nin new delhi\nhe was uh a prisoner\nin um imphal which is now\nin what we call used to call burma\nmyanmar and under siege by the japanese\nso he saw me months after i was born\nwow and what was that experience of\ngrowing up at that time and on that cusp\nlike\nlike take us back to what that\nexperience was like and\nwell you grow up and\nawareness comes very gradually\nso my first memory actually\nvery significant memory\nis when i was six years of age\nmy father was at that time in england\ntraining to be a medical doctor and then\na cardiologist\nand i was living with my\ngrandparents as was my younger brother\nwho later\nbecame the dean of medical education at\nharvard medical school so\nwe're all a family of doctors and\ni remember at the age of six years\ngetting a\ntelegram from england in those days the\npostman used to knock at the door\nit took actually 48 hours to get a\ntelegram from england\ntwo weeks to go by ship or\nboat and two days by\nairplane dakota planes anyway the\ntelegram was that my father had passed\nall his exams he was a member\nof the royal college of physicians my\ngrandfather\nused to be an old army sergeant in the\nbritish army\nso he had a gun he went to the ceiling\nof the apartment building\nshort a few rounds into the air to\ncelebrate\ntook us to the movies i still remember\nthe movie alibaba and the 40 thieves\nand then he took us to a carnival and\nthen in the middle of the night he died\nso i remember waking up to the wailing\nof women\nhe was taken for cremation and the next\nday\nshe was brought back in a little bottle\nof ashes\nand one of my uncles said what is life\nhere he was yesterday celebrating with\nthe kids\nand now he's a bunch of ashes in the um\nin that bottle and i remember not only\nbeing scared but also\neven at the age of six years having my\nfirst\nexistential crisis what's going on\nwhere is he now so you know\nand that continued throughout my\nchildhood\nuh and into medical school and\nessentially shaped my life\nyeah that one episode yeah what an\nunbelievable experience to experience so\nyoung yes\nand thank you for sharing that and and i\nreally feel that\nhow when were the moments where you\nstarted\nfinding those answers to that\nexistential questioning like when did\nyou start\nbecoming more awakened to the answers\nthat you now share with the world\nnot till uh a long time after that\nyou know when i was in high school all i\nwanted to do was\nbe a phys to be a writer\nmy secret wish always was to write and\nmy secret wish always\nwas to write fiction more than anything\nelse now i have written a lot of fiction\ntoo but mostly historical fiction\nand i at the age of 14\nwas reading a book called lost horizon\nand it was about\nthis mythical place called shangri-la\nwhere people don't age and where they\ndon't die\nand it was a very\ninteresting book and i was inspired to\nwrite\nfiction on my own but my father as you\nknow indian fathers\nthey want their kids to either go to\nmedical school or engineering school\nhe wanted me to follow in his footsteps\nand so he knew that was not my interest\nand when i was about 15 he gave me some\nbooks\nsomerset mom who was a physician\nwriter so these are amazing books of\nhuman bondage\nthe razor's edge which talks about\nexistential\nissues and so i was so inspired by these\nbooks\nthat i told my dad i want to be a doctor\nand then\nyou know i had to do biology all over\nagain to\nenter medical school and the thing is\nthat you know when you go to medical\nschool\nyou're supposed to understand health\nwell-being and all of that\nbut day one of medical school is anatomy\nwhich means you're introduced to a\ncorpse\nso you're supposed to understand life by\nlooking at a dead body\nthat's the model it's been the model\never since\nmichelangelo's times and still is\nand so that kind of model stuck in my\nmind the body is a physical\nmachine and uh consciousness is a\nbyproduct that you know\nwe have molecules that manufacture\nthoughts\nand i live with that model throughout my\nmedical school years i told you\nyesterday at that time\nbecause we were introduced to the\ndissection table\nand you know there's a certain smell\nthat comes from a corpse and especially\nif it's been preserved with formalin\nso i couldn't get the smell out of my\nhands you know dissection\nso i started smoking cigarettes to get\nrid of the smell\nand i was experimenting with all kinds\nof things then we had some\nstudents who had come from harvard our\nmedical school was founded by\namongst other foundations the\nrockefeller foundation so we had lots of\nvisiting professors and\nsometimes visiting students and these\nstudents from harvard\nmedical school um introduced me to lsd\nfirst time this is before even the\nbeatles got involved\nand so i had some interesting\nexperiences\nduring my medical school years with\nsmoking\nalcohol lsd scotch the whole works\nand it didn't stop till much later after\ni actually\ncame to the united states wow so we've\nhad this is so\ninteresting because i was sharing the\nother day my experimental phase\nyes and what were you experimenting with\nwas it just because it was new at that\ntime was it because\nyou felt a certain feeling like where\nwas that experimentation in your mind\nand life coming from\nso we're talking about the mid-60s\na lot was going on the vietnam war was\ncoming to an\nend there was a lot of protests against\nthe vietnam war um\nyou won't even know this but there was\nthe riots in america\nyeah against the vietnam war\nof course there was a shooting at kent\nstate\nuniversity and there was\nhuge global uprising\nfor peace the feminist movement was just\nstarting gloria steinem was burning her\nbra\nin in cambridge massachusetts\ngreenpeace was coming as\nyoung late teenagers\nand people who were just embarking on\nour life journey\nwe were very idealistic we thought the\nworld was\ngoing to change the best hit on broadway\nwas oh calcutta and hair\nand lsd rock and roll\nmusic were in the air the beatles had\njust\npublished their album lucy in the sky\nwith diamonds\nso yeah it was a time of idealism\nbut also a time of experimentation and\nalso the feeling\nthat the world was changing but it\ndidn't we actually regressed yeah how\nhave you felt about that because it's\ninteresting that everyone who's\nlistening and watching right now\nthe audience that's listening now may\nfeel that we're kind of going through\nthat period again in the world\nwhere there's an uprising of\nconversations around obviously the\ngender\npay gap women's rights we have more of a\nconversation\nright now about equality and unit unity\nwe have again the conversation around\nthe planet\nand the environment it's almost like\nthose same themes\nin in our generation are coming to the\ntop do you think\nyou just said there that we've regressed\nyou don't think i thought we were going\nto\nsee a world transformation we were\nseeing social justice\neconomic justice conflict resolution\nperhaps the absence of war a sustainable\nenvironment\nand a critical mass of consciousness\nthat was moving in the direction of a\nmore peaceful just sustainable healthier\nand joyful world\nbut it did not happen 20 years later\nin the 80s you had these my own\ncounterparts on wall street and\nall these corrupt scandals on wall\nstreet\nwall street and the idealism was totally\nshattered\nand then we started to regress until as\nyou said recently now\nthe conversation is picking up but it's\nnot enough to pick up this conversation\nyou know we have to\nactually see why we failed in the past\nand that is because idealism without\naction\nis useless you know they say that love\nwithout action is irrelevant and action\nwithout love is\nmeaningless but when you have love in\naction and love for the greater good\nthen things can happen and i'm hoping\nit'll happen now or we'll wait another\n30 years long after i'm gone i'm we\nmight not even survive with climate\nchange and all that\nthat's happening right now yeah wow so\nyou really think and i'm just digressing\nfrom your journey i want to go back to\nit but i think this is such a\nfascinating point that you've raised\nthat actually the real missing link is\nacting on our idealistic views\nand and getting it without being a\nangry social activist without being an\nangry peace activist that's a\ncontradiction in itself\nyes you can't be an angry peace activist\nyou have to be a\npeaceful being in order to create peace\nyou have to\nhave experience love in order to create\nlove and then you\nbring into action it starts with empathy\nwhich is feeling what others are feeling\ncompassion which is the desire to\nalleviate suffering\nand if you have that then that is the\nbasis of all love\nbut then love has to move into action as\nwell\nyeah absolutely what a beautiful answer\nand i really hope everyone who's\nlistening and watching right now\nif there's any cause that you feel\nempathy towards if there's ever a moment\nin your life you feel compassionate\nstart thinking about how you can\nexperience that and then act with it\nthat's what we need\nlet love lee creep in yes and let it\nbecome the healer\nand motivation for everything yes\nabsolutely\nabsolutely we need more of that i\ncouldn't agree more i really feel that\nway that\nwe live in a world today also when\nsomething's happening we're very good at\nchanging our social media picture\nwe're very good at changing the color of\nour profile and that's good because\nwe're standing up for something\nbut to really change something is going\nto require require activation\nwe're polishing our selfies instead of\ngetting in touch with ourselves\nyes yeah exactly and it's it's just such\na simple option to take that versus to\ndo more so no i love that let's let's go\nback to your story because i really want\nto\nget there so when was it now that you're\nexperimenting with\nlsd you're smoking cigarettes you're\nyou're drinking scotch you're having all\nof these\nexperiences while being a medical\nstudent when is the point that you come\nto a spiritual awakening so\nthe year 1970\ni get a letter from a foundation in the\nunited states\nthat if i pass certain exams that were\nthen given by the american medical\nassociation\nand another agency called the\nforeign something executive council for\nforeign medical graduates\nthat i could get a scholarship now i had\nnot even applied or thought for a\nscholarship but\ni did the exams and i passed and\ni showed up in new jersey at a little\nhospital in plainfield new jersey\na community hospital i realized when i\nwas here that actually this\nwhole scholarship thing was an excuse to\nbring foreign doctors into the united\nstates because all the american doctors\nwere in vietnam\nwow and there was a big shortage of\nphysicians\nthe prestigious posts went to university\nhospitals for\namerican graduates and the foreign\ngraduates\nwere then relegated to\ncommunity hospitals which offered no\neducation but lots of work\nso i ended up being in this small\nhospital in new jersey\nand all my colleagues were also foreign\ndoctors they were from egypt from korea\nfrom italy from\nthe islands and so on and basically we\nwere cheap labor for five dollars\nan hour but i got to\nactually experience what it was to be\nin a very traumatic environment so we\nhad gunshot wounds\nthe hospital had a reputation for\nbeing connected quote unquote to the\nmafia\nand all of that so i worked hard that\none year\nand then i got\na position in an academic institution\nboston\nassociated with harvard medical school\nand what happened there was i first did\nmy internal medicine\nstill smoking and drinking and partying\nas a\nintern and resident and then as i was\nfinishing my internship and residency i\nbecame a quote unquote internist\ni then took a specialty training in\nendocrinology which is the study of\nhormones\nand then in neuroendocrinology which is\nlooking at brain chemistry\nand i had some very interesting\ncolleagues\nbut also my mentor at that time was\nuh a person called seymour reichlen he\nwas world famous he's now\n94. and he's still if he finds a snake\nin his garden he'll\ndissect the brain of the snake looking\nfor neuro chemicals\nbut at that time now we're well into the\nmid 70s\nwe were discovering in the brain these\nchemicals that\nnow everybody knows about they're called\nneuropeptides\nso neuro because they're in the brain\npeptides because they're protein-like\nmolecules\nand one of my colleagues at that time\ncandi spurt\nshe was later the chief of brain\nchemistry at the nih\nshe used the phrase molecules of emotion\nand i'd never heard that word and now\neverybody knows\nthings like serotonin dopamine oxytocin\nopiates but that was we were just\ndiscovering molecules\nmolecules of immersion and so that got\nme hooked to\nthe so-called mind-body connection and\nat the same time i was besides the\nresearch i was also seeing patients\nand i was very perplexed as to why two\npatients who had the same illness could\nsee the same doctor\nget the same treatment and have\ncompletely different outcomes\none could die the other one could\nrecover so i started writing down the\nstories of my patients just to see if i\ncould learn something from them\nand i then started submitting these to\nmedical journals\nbut nobody would accept them so then\nwhat happened is\nand they wouldn't expect them before\nbecause because uh\nthey're too anecdotal there's not enough\nresearch\nso then i thought maybe i'll publish\nthem for the general public and\nthe publishers wouldn't accept that\neither it was too\nnew age so one day i saw\nan ad in the new york times about this\nbig it said if you want to get your book\npublished\nwe can do it for five thousand dollars\nit was a vanity press\nand so i didn't know what that was about\ni paid five thousand which is a lot of\nmoney for me we used to get\n202 salary a month\nso i borrow the money i got a hundred\nbooks\nvery shabbily produced i didn't know\nwhat to do with them but now\nat this time because of all my you know\nwhat i was learning i'd given up\nalcohol and i'd given up every\nexperiment i was\nmeditating and one day i was giving a\nlecture\nto the students at harvard divinity\nschool in cambridge\nand there was a young woman a student\nthere in divinity school\nshe said can you give me a bunch of\nthose books that you're talking about\ni had 100 and she took 12 and she put\nthem in the window of the harvard\ncoupe which is now barnes noble in\ncambridge\nand the book was picked up by some kid\nwho gave it to his mother on mother's\nday she happened to be a literary agent\nshe called me and she said\nwhy do you not have a regular publisher\ni said i tried\nand she said she said how much did you\npay for this i said 5000. she said i'll\nget two five thousand advance\nnext thing i know the book is a national\nbestseller i'm getting calls from jackie\nonassis\nand from major publishers all over the\ncountry\nand i didn't know my life transformed\nso then i actually got in\nvery deeply involved in mind-body\nmedicine\ni knew that my colleagues in boston were\na little embarrassed about me because\nthey didn't believe what i was doing\ni went to california and\nto give grand rounds at a hospital and\nsomebody convinced me to come to\ncalifornia\nand they'd open a center for me so\nthat's when i went to california in the\nmeanwhile i also had also\nmet maharishi maeshogi and\nyou know he was as popularly known those\ndays as a guru of the beatles\nand actually misunderstood by the world\nbecause he was so popular it happens\nwhen you get popular\nbut he was a very profound\nbeing and he asked me\nuh to study or get involved with first\nayurveda and then vedanta and\nconsciousness so that was how it\nhappened i told him about the molecules\nof emotion and he said they're not real\nso that's when i really understood that\nmind-body medicine\nwas a good start for integrative\nhealth and well-being but it wasn't\nwhat these great luminaries were talking\nabout that\nas we said you're not your body you're\nnot the mind\nyou're not even in this world and\nsomehow you're creating the experience\nof the body\nthe mind and the world so that happened\nalmost\ni was i would say 36\nwhen i started to shift into the world\nof consciousness and\ntrying to figure out ultimate reality\nbefore that i was a mind body\nintegrative doctor and i still have my\nkeep my license in california\nand massachusetts we have a medical\npractice but my interest\nright now is unveiling fundamental\nreality what gave you that\ninclination at that time because it was\nso early on\nin all of these themes beliefs\nphilosophies kind of coming to the west\nwith marishimae shogi et cetera it was\nit was such an early time for\nterms like consciousness and reality and\nillusion like those weren't themes that\nwere spoken about in such a broad way as\nthey are now what gave you\nthe conviction at that time that that's\nthe direction you wanted to go in and\nthat there was some reality there\nas opposed to everything you'd study i i\nspent a lot of time with people that\nmaharishi introduced me to\nthere were sears there were\nayurvedic healers they were philosophers\nthere were other adepts in the\nrealm of kashmir shaivism vedanta\nand the perennial wisdom traditions so i\nimmersed myself\ninto that environment also got very\nfamiliar with the terminology\nyou know that they were using and\nit made intellectual sense but still\ndidn't make experiential sense\nso that's when i really got deeply\ninvolved in\nnot only mantra meditation but in the\nyoga sutras of pathanjali especially the\nchapter on the cities\nand then i also\ngot involved in various other\ndisciplines\ntantra kashmir shaivism um\nself-inquiry self-self\num reflection\ntranscendence but also got into the\nhabit of\nbeing a witness of my mental space\nmy body what's happening inside my body\nand also of perceptual experience and\nyou know once you get um so deeply\nexperientially involved there's no going\nback it's like a new child who's been\nborn\ncan't return to the womb anymore yeah\nyeah absolutely absolutely\nit's a bit which was a period it was 10\n15 years of that\nthat's incredible i love this by the way\nthis is amazing for anyone who's\nlistening or watching right now who\nhasn't\nheard deepak's full story before from\nhim this is a this is amazing\nand you also we were talking about this\nthe other day you also ended up spending\nsome time as a monk too\nyeah that was actually recently oh wow\noh okay\noh i thought it was okay no i mean being\nwith marishi was like\nbeing in a monk environment yes but\nthen a few years ago i thought to myself\ni needed a break from um break from\nbeing so much in the public\neye i wanted to experience anonymity\nso actually i instead of going to an\nashram in india\ni went to the north of\nthe forest in korea in south korea\nat the border of um north and south\nkorea\nand i went into a buddhist monastery\nand spent some time as a monk\nwe shaved our head shaved our eyebrows\nput on robes went with a begging ball\nevery morning through the streets or the\nstreets of the village nearby the\nmonastery\num i had a couple of um\napprentice monks with me um there was of\ncourse the senior monk at the\nmonastery and we kept silence throughout\nthe day\nbut then and we had one meal and you\nknow in\nin these buddhist countries there's a\ntradition that if a monk goes by the\nstreet you\noffer food it's considered\na benefit yes yeah you know auspicious\nand\nyou get rewards car maker rewards for\nfeeding the monks\nso we used to end up returning to the\nmonastery with\nso much food you think we'd gone to\nwhole foods or something\nand the monks would keep filling it up\nand there was one meal\nand then in the night they would chant\nall night\num and we would listen so it was a good\nexperience anonymity\nand also the freedom that comes from uh\nnot being uh beholden to\nthe world in the sense yes it was good\nexperience\nyeah why was anonymity so why do you\nthink anonymity is so\nimportant for all of us in our life to\nexperience why is it such a fascinating\nbecause when you\ngo past your ego identity\nthere's a bigger identity that is\nso huge it's incomprehensible it can't\neven be\ndescribed and there's a freedom and a\njoy\nthat comes from that and i had had\nglimpses of that\nbut this period of intense stillness and\nby the way since then i've kept a week\nof silence\nevery year sometimes i do more and\nthat week of silence usually in\nseptember i do every year\njust to go back to the taste of timeless\nbeing yeah instead of you know our ego\nidentity which we keep\npolishing every day now especially these\ndays with social media\nand books and promotions and you name it\nwhat's something that people can do\ndaily to access that\nexperience because like you said our\ndays are just busy with work and\nfamily and commitments and events what's\nsomething people can do daily\nthat helps them access their true\nidentity their self going beyond the ego\nand the mind and the body\ni think the basic of it is to still the\nmind\nas much as possible and\njust become a silent witness\nto that which is happening on the screen\nof your consciousness\nso if you um close your eyes and take a\nfew deep breaths\nand then um you know i usually start\nwith a little reflection who am i\nwho wants to know the answer what is it\nthat wants to know the answer to the\nquestion who am i\nwhat is my purpose\nwhat do i want for me and the world\nwhat am i grateful for that's how i\nstart\nthen i go into a little bit of breathing\nand then mantra meditation and then what\ni do is i witness\nwhat's happening on the screen of my\nconsciousness just becoming\naware and sooner or later you realize\nthat\nwhat's happening on the screen of\nconsciousness is not who you are you're\nthe one who's\nwatching that and then what's happening\non the screen of your consciousness\nultimately leads to deep insights about\nmind and body and the physical world\nwhich actually doesn't really exist but\nwe can get into that when we talk about\nmeta-human but i think if people just\nask these four questions every day\nbefore they start the day even without a\nprolonged meditation\nprocess who am i what do i want what's\nmy purpose\nwhat am i grateful for suddenly the\nwindows to the bigger reality starts\nto start to open absolutely this is such\na beautiful point that deepak's making\nright now for everyone listening and\nwatching it's just\nsuch a simple way of starting to\ntranscend the noise and the clutter\nthat we feel every morning when we wake\nup and the first thing we do is look at\nour phones all you have to do is just\nswitch that habit for asking yourself\nthese questions\nand you don't need to know the answers\nbecause you know there are no fixed\nanswers these answers keep changing all\nyou have to\ndo is live the questions and then life\nkeeps moving into answers\nthat you need at that moment in your\nlife and it all happens spontaneously\nsynchronistically\nsuch a great point because these answers\nare revealed and received\nthey're not they're not found and\nthey're pertinent for that moment in\nyour life\nnot necessarily the answers i love that\ni think that's such a good point because\nso often we put this pressure when we\nask a question\nthat we must find the answer now it's\nlike the education system has\ndrilled us in believing that you have\nthe right or wrong answer within moments\nwhat was that\npoet who said live the questions and\nlife will move\nyou to the answers when you need them\nbecause if you got them right now you\nmay not be\neven prepared for them wow yeah that's a\ngood point i know life has done that to\nme a lot of times\nyeah when you ask questions and you\nthink you want the answer now\nbut then when you actually receive it\nyou realize yes i wasn't prepared that's\nright absolutely wow what a profound\nwhat a profound way of thinking about it\ni love that\nthat's that's made a huge shift in my\nmind not even to want to answer the\nquestions now\nno just ask them and let your day and\nlet them go\nyeah in the form of insight intuition\ninspiration creative um\nuh creativity but most importantly they\ncome in\nthe form of uh meaningful coincidences\nof what kalyan called synchronously or\nwhat religious people say\ngrace yes that's it yeah yeah meaningful\ncoincidences\nabsolutely yeah how beautiful is that i\nlove that so this is\nwhat i love about your journey deepak is\njust that at every point it seems that\nyou've\nbeen a seeker for more like you've\ncontinually\ngone in the direction of more learning\nmore growth\nnever settling how have you seen the\nmedical industry shift how have you seen\nother things around you shift with time\nbecause you've really gone all the way\ndo you think that we are seeing shifts\nin the medical yeah we are seeing shifts\nwhen i\nstarted i felt like a loner yeah i can\nimagine but\nnow integrative medicine is part of\nevery institution\nincluding academia and\nin the last 15 20 years our foundation\nhas done a lot of research so we made it\npretty mainstream right now so\nto summarize very shortly what has taken\n30 years to learn or more 40 years to\nlearn\nis that only five percent of disease\nrelated gene mutations\nare fully penetrant so let me explain\nthis\nfor a lay audience so a genetic a\ngenetic mutation\nis a is a mistake it's an error\nin the gene genes are stretches of\ndna that code for proteins so\ndna is uh stands for deoxyribonucleic\nacid and there are\nfour of these named after\nalphabets adenine guanine cytosine\nthymine\natcg so atcg are the four letters of\nlife\nin english we have 26 letters and most\nlanguages\nhuman languages we have more than 20\nletters but the language of life\ndna has only four letters atcg\nand these spell out words that we call\ngenes and the body is a story spelled\nout\nby those genes so when people say\nfirst there was the word word was made\ninto flesh in a way it's\nvery literal actually when you start to\nlook at the biological mechanism\nnow once in a while or more than once in\na while there are\ngenetic mistakes so you might think of\nthem again with\nspeaking metaphorically but a spelling\nmistake so instead of the word being\nspelled correctly maybe one of the\nletters\natcg is missing or it's in the wrong\nplace or it's upside down\nor you're redundant two letters instead\nof one\nthat mistake genetic variation is called\na mutation\nnow only five percent of these genetic\nmutations that are associated with\ndisease\ncancer heart disease arthritis\nstrokes you name it autoimmune diseases\nalzheimer's only five percent actually\nguarantee the disease which means if you\nhave one of those\nmutations you're going to get the\ndisease like angelina jolie\nhad a gene called the baraka gene which\npredicts breast cancer 100 percent\nso she had a mastectomy to prevent the\ncancer\nrightly so for those five percent there\nare new technologies\nthat are being developed right now and\ncrispr is one of them which means you\ncan cut and paste the gene\nthe way you would in email so you would\ntake the defective gene\nyou'd read the bar code with the\nmolecular scissors you delete it\nand then you'll insert the right chain\nit's not\nhappening right now but it'll happen in\nthe near future\nbut what people don't understand is\nthat's five percent of\nillness wow the rest even the genetic\nmistakes that are associated with\ndisease\ndepends on how you live your life and\nvery simple things like sleep\nmeditation and stress management\nmovement\nyoga and pranayama now yoga and\npranayama goes way beyond exercise\nbecause with yoga and pranayam\nthere's a particular nerve in the body\ncalled the vagus nerve it's the tenth\nnerve\nand the word vegas is a latin word but\nit's\nrelated to the english word vagabond so\nthis nerve comes from the midbrain\nit influences your facial expressions so\nyou can now\ndo micro expressions and see if a person\nis happy or not\nit influences the eye movements\nit influences the tone of your voice are\nyou threatened are you stressed are you\nfriendly are you happy\nit influences your heart rate activity\nthen it pierces the diaphragm\nand it influences the activity of every\nother\nbranch of the vagus nerve that goes to\nall the organs in the body\nso when i discovered this through yoga\nteachers and masters\ni realized that the yoga asanas you know\nwe say yoga asana\nand people usually translate that into\nas postures but actually the word asana\nmeans seat\nas you know seat of awareness seat of\nconsciousness\nso each yogasana is a particular seat of\nconsciousness that stimulates a\nparticular nerve\nthat is going to organ in your body\nand the only reason for that nerve is\nself-regulation or healing\nor homeostasis so when i discovered that\ni became\nfanatic about yoga i haven't missed yoga\nnow for as long as i can remember one\namazing\nwow not one day of yoga or meditation\nor um or pranayama so yeah it was a long\ntime so when you put together\nyou know yoga movement sleep stress\nmanagement healthy relationships and\nemotions like love compassion joy\nequanimity\nuh food that doesn't kill your\nmicrobiome which is the\ntwo million extra genes in our body\nwhich are not human\nso you only have 25 000 human genes\nbut you have two million bacterial genes\nin your body\nthis is called the microbial microbiome\nit is much\nit's as important as the human genome so\nyou can change the activity of your\nmicrobial genes just by changing your\ndiet so if you go\num not even vegan but if you go maximum\ndiversity on plant-based foods\nand foods that are not contaminated with\nantibiotics or\nhormones or insecticides\nyou can change your genetic activity wow\nand the population of your genes\nin less than six weeks and which means\nthen you're reinventing your body\nbecause your body\nis spelled out by your genes so this got\nme going\nstrongly into how do we reinvent our\nbodies\nby resurrecting our souls and\ngoing past our minds and that's what i'm\nobsessed with now wow i love that\ni'm so glad you're obsessed with it\nbecause the fact that we're so\nresponsible\nfor our own well-being is huge\nin the sense of belief that there are\nways in which we can rewrite that story\nyou can write the genetic structure\nof your body you can't change the human\ngenes by the way because you got them\nfrom your parents\nbut you can change their activity so\nright here's one of our researchers\num we put one we put people through\na one week retreat where they not only\nlearnt\nmantra meditation but they also\npracticed the yoga sutras of patanjali\nfrom the chapter on the cities\nparticularly transcending the senses in\none week\nliterally and this is published now in\nmajor peer-reviewed\njournals if people want to check them\nout go to chopra foundation.org\nand you'll see all the research and the\nresearch was in collaboration with\nscientists from harvard from ucsf\nfrom duke from scripps of course chopra\nfoundation mount sinai in new york\nand what did we find we found that in\none week\nof this practice of meditation and the\nyoga sutras of patanjali\nall the genes that are responsible for\nhealing and self-regulation\nthey went up some 17-fold\nover baseline these are human genes and\nthe genes\nthat cause disease or inflammation went\ndown drastically\nthe enzyme there's an enzyme in our body\ncalled telomerase it influences the\nlength of telomeres\nwhich are like little buttons at the end\nof your chromosomes\nthe the level of the enzyme went up 40\nin one week which means people were\nreversing their biological age at a\ngenetic\nlevel wow okay now how far does this go\nwe don't know and that was just one week\nwhich is one week and you know the\npeople who are in samadhi for weeks at a\ntime\nthose traditions are not that prevalent\nyou know there's a\ntechnique in ayurveda called kaya kalpa\nwhere you go\ninto a retreat where it is totally dark\nwhere you have no communication with the\nworld where you transcend\nwhere you eat minimal\nmaximum diversity of plant-based foods\nand within six months you come back\na younger person biologically\nphysiologically\nyou know i'm 72 now no you're looking\nfor i'm i'm i\nyou know i'm not uh focused on aging\nanymore\nyeah i think that's a mistake for anyone\nwho\nuh follows deepak on social media\ninstagram or facebook if you don't\nalready i highly recommend it\nbut i've never seen you miss a day of\nyoga meditation\ni see you every time when you inspire me\nso much because i just think like\nif you're able at your current body's\nage\nto be able to do the things you are with\nyour body and how healthy you are\nand how healthy your body and mind are i\nmean we have no excuses\nthere's biological age which is the\nexact\nbiomarkers so what's blood pressure bone\ndensity\nbody temperature regulation fat content\ncholesterol\nvision hearing skin thickness wrinkles\nhormones that's biological age then\nthere's chronological age\nwhen you were born what your birth yes\nit says yes\nthen there's psychological age how do\nyou feel yes and then there's spiritual\nage which is timeless\nyeah it has no age whatsoever so you\nknow we\nhave to make these distinctions and see\nwhich of these we're talking about 100\n100 when you said at the end there that\nyou're not thinking about aging anymore\nwhat did you mean by that\nwhen you said that it's now um\nsomething i talked about uh in my new\nbook made a human\nthat what we call body\nmind and world\nand aging and birth and death\ni've got so many questions on the book\nthat we'd put together for you so\ni'm happy to do that so in one of the\nthings this is what i was looking at the\nyou start the book by prompting two\nquestions right\nin moments where you feel very happy do\nyou watch yourself being happy\nand when you're angry is someone is some\npart of you free of anger\nright why did you start with this so in\nall the spiritual traditions\num not necessarily just the eastern\ntraditions they speak of\ntwo worlds the imminent and the\ntranscendent\nso the imminent is this world that we're\nin\nright now this space-time causality new\nyork city\nthe hotel we're in and then the\ntranscendent world is\nthe world of infinite being or\nconsciousness at all times we're\nin both these worlds without knowing\nbut once you become aware even\nslightly that the awareness of a thought\nis not a thought\nright if you're able to observe a\nthought\nthen you the observer is not that\nthought right\nsimilarly the observer of the emotion or\nwhich is the awareness of an emotion is\nnot the emotion agreed\nor a perception or a color you know\nright now we are perceiving\nthrough our five senses and what we are\nperceiving is\ncolors forms\nshapes sounds\nsensations in our body\nmaybe emotions and\nthoughts and maybe images that's the raw\nmaterial of experience that's all there\nis\nokay the words body mind and world\nare human constructs\nbased on the interpretation of these raw\nsensations\nso once you start to become a witness\nof experience you realize that\nyou are intrinsically free of the\nexperience\nunless you identify with it unless you\nsay that's me\nyes it's not you it's an experience\nyou're having right absolutely\nso once you bind yourself to the\nexperience\nwhich we call the karmic web\nof existence then you are in that\ncircle of karma memory desire\nyou are constantly seeking validation\nyou're afraid of people who criticize\nyou you're flattered by people who\nflatter you you feel beneath someone or\nsuperior to someone\nit's the melodrama of our daily\nexistence yes when you can\nobserve what's happening\nin the realm of experience and instead\nof reacting to it\nyou observe the reaction to react even\nfor a second\ninstead of reacting to the experience\nyou observe the reaction to react\nyou suddenly realize that your range of\noptions or choices right this moment\nis actually infinite and you don't have\nto be a bundle of conditioned reflexes\nand nerves\nthat's constantly being triggered by\npeople and circumstances to predictable\noutcomes so\nyou become you become you're at the\nmercy of every stranger on the street so\ni think it's very important to know that\nyes\ni'm having this experience but i am\nintrinsically free of this experience so\nthat's how the book starts\nyeah and i absolutely love that because\nit's an analogy i usually\nused to share that experience is like\nwhen we're in a car and someone hits the\ncar we say oh someone hit me\nyes but actually they didn't hit you\nthey hit the car yeah and you're\nidentifying as the car as yourself\nyes now how about if they hit your body\nyeah you know\nand and your body perishes right\nyes so that's the argument people have\nagainst\nthe argument that\nspiritual people have which is\nyou're not your body you're not your\nmind so but you know you remember that\nfamous\ndialogue between samuel johnson and\num and whoever that idealist was and he\nsaid you know the world is a projection\nof consciousness\nand i think it was samuel johnson who\nhit his leg\non a piece of stone and said i refute\nyou thus\nsaying that you know you get hit by a\nbus\nyou're going to you're going to break\nyour bones and you might die\nso why do you say that the physical\nworld is an illusion now\nif you want we can address that yeah\nlet's address that yeah let's address\nthat yeah so\nyou know this is of course i take people\nthrough the book\nvery slowly but if you asked a regular\nperson\non the street what is this\nthey'd say it's a microphone if you ask\nthem what's this\nyou'd say this is a watch what's this\nthis is my hand what's this this is\nmy body now if you really start to\nlook at this very carefully\nbefore you call anything by its name\nmicrophone hand body\num watch before you use that\nthose words it's an experience\nand the experience is actually not a\nphysical experience\ncolor form and shape are not physical\nexperiences if i asked you\nwhere in the physical world is the color\nred\nlocated you would say\nnowhere in fact there's no color red in\nthe physical world what's coming to your\neyes are\nelectromagnetic vibrations which have no\ncolor\nwhat's happening in your eyes\nthere's no color and if i asked you to\nimagine a beautiful\nred sunset you have a picture in your\nconsciousness but there's no picture in\nyour brain\nthere's no picture in your eyes and\nactually the sunset\nis not if you're imagining it it's not\nin the physical world\nnow what you don't realize is when\nyou're looking at a real sunset\nall you're experiencing is color the\nrest is a story\nokay that's a sunset this is a body\nokay color shapes textures\nsensations smells images emotions\nand thoughts have no location in the\nphysical world\nand yet out of this raw material we\ncreate the idea\nof a physical world so in sanskrit\nthat's called jagat mithya\nthe world appearance on the screen of\nyour consciousness\nand your body is part of that world\nappearance because people you know they\nsay where are you people say i'm here\nbut there's no one inside there\nokay because this is also an experience\nin consciousness\nthe mind is an experience in\nconsciousness moreover it's a shifting\nexperience in consciousness\nno you know a thought is un ungraspable\nit's ephemeral it's evanescent you can't\ncatch it okay you can't catch a\nperception\nand look here i look there these are two\nsnapshots of perception\nand they're evanescent i look at my body\nand by the time i look at it again it's\na different body because it's recycling\nso fast\nat the level of atoms and molecules and\ninformation and energy\nso the fact that we call this a body\nit's actually a changing experience of\nsensations images feelings and thoughts\nthat is a modified form of your own self\nand it's changing it's ungraspable same\nthing with the mind it's ungraspable\nsame thing which we will call with the\nworld it's a changing\nexperience of shifting what we call\nqualia in the in the spiritual\nliterature now in the consciousness\nliterature there's this word qualia\ninstead of quantum a quantum is a unit\nof measurement\nbut a qualia is a unit of experience so\nif i tell you\nthink of your wife right now and you see\nan image that's a qualia\nnow feel the emotion connected with that\nthat's a qualia\nnow think of what you want to do with\nher this evening go out for dinner or\nmovie that's a qualia\nso qualia are units of experience when\nwe string them together\nwe create the construct of mind body and\nworld\nand once we create that construct then\nwe're stuck with constructs like birth\nand death and karma\nand memory and desire and all the things\nwhich make a very\nfascinating human experience but it's\nnot reality\nit's we are already in a virtual reality\nokay so today with vr\nand immersive augmented experiences and\ndreamscapes\nit is becoming clear that the world that\nyou and i\nare inhabiting right now is a collective\nhuman dreamscape and as body minds we\nare fictional characters\nin that dreamscape and it's an\nillusion that we can upgrade or we can\ndowngrade\nyou know we can create heaven out of it\nor hell but it's still not fundamental\nreality and now with the new\ntechnologies\nthis is becoming very clear once you\nrealize that the world is a construct\nyes the construct has been evolving\nthrough mythology through religion\nthrough economics through history\nthrough society\nthrough culture but it's still a\nconstruct\nand what these great seers these great\nrishis were able to do is\nthey were able to deconstruct it once\nyou deconstruct it what are you left\nwith you know when you\nleft you've heard that expression 1890\ni'm not the mind i'm not the body\ni'm not the intellect i'm i'm the\nobserver\nwhat are you left with once you\ndeconstruct\neverything what you're left with is\nformless infinite\ndynamic field of infinite possibilities\ninfinite creativity infinite love\nand the source of intention\nso that's what yoga originally was\nand should be yoga means union\nunion with the self which is also the\nself of the universe\nand this is where you know i got totally\nseduced that human suffering as the\nvedanta says comes from not knowing\ntrue reality fundamental reality\nconfusing\nperceptual reality with fundamental\nreality grasping and clinging\nthat which you cannot grasp a cling the\nfear of impermanence\nthe construct of the ego and the fear of\ndeath these are\nall the same thing not knowing what is\nreal\nand what is a projection and even the\nprojection\ncan be changed absolutely wow what a\nclass\nin what a master class in in reality an\nillusion\nhow does then one function within the\nworld\nbut then still understand because i\nthink the challenge people have on a\nday-to-day basis as you've probably\nheard for decades\nis this well if it if what i'm\nexperiencing is not complete reality\nthen where do i go from there like what\nam i doing\nmarried do i fall in love why not do i\ngo to the movies\nyou know i used to go to a lot of movies\ni don't that much\nanymore because what we call everyday\nreality is a more interesting movie\nthan most movies yeah don't have the\nimagination to capture\nthe what is happening in what we call\neveryday reality\nso we are in it we might as well enjoy\nit\nand upgrade it and that's\nwhat the expression is to be in the\nworld and not of this world\nokay or we are spiritual beings having a\nhuman experience or non-local beings\nhaving a local experience\ntimeless but in time\nonce you understand that and once you\nalso get into the habit\nof self-reflection self-inquiry\nobserving perceptual experiences without\nnecessarily judging them so i'm right\nnow having the experience of\ncolors and forms and tastes and smells\nand sounds\ni don't necessarily have to qualify this\nexperience\nand transcendence where you know you go\nto that place where there is no mantra\nand no thought and just\ndeep stillness then the shift starts to\noccur\nthat you're not identifying with your\nbody mind or\nexperiences of the world and yet you're\nenjoying them\nor not enjoying them and now you want to\ndo\nsomething to shift and since you're in\nthe world\nyou know about 25 years ago i wrote this\nbook\nhow to make that practical and i don't\nknow how\nbut basically i came up with the idea of\nthe seven spiritual laws of success\nthe law of pure potentiality the law of\ngiving and receiving\nkarma intention desire\nleast effort and\ndetachment and dharma those seven\nprinciples guided me into a new idea of\nwhat success is\nthe progressive realization of worthy\ngoals the ability to love\nhave compassion but most importantly to\nidentify with your creative center\ninstead of\nthe projection that's coming from that\ncenter because most of\nthe time our experience of\nis coming from identifying with the\nprojection that has been created by the\nconditioned or ego mind\nnow the ego mind is not going to\ndisappear\nas long as you're in this body or\nactually you're not in the body the body\nis in you but whatever\nso it's not going to disappear but if\nyou keep it in the background and you're\naware of it and you ask yourself\nwhat am i motivated by and i have these\nlittle\ntricks in my mind pursue excellence\nignore success\nand then everything happens\nsynchronicity meaningful coincidences\nthe state of grace effortless being\nspontaneous fulfillment of desire these\nare little things over the years that\ni've gleaned as my little\ncatch phrases to remind myself yes\ni must live a life that is based on\nlove and if it's not based on love at\nthe highest level you know as\nthe vedanta say love should radiate from\nyou like light from a bonfire\nyeah not focused on anyone and not\ndenied to anyone it's just\nthe light of the sun yeah if you start\nand it takes time you know remember\nof course yeah yeah absolutely it took\nme and and i think that's the most\nbeautiful thing is that\nwhat we're having to do on a daily\npractical level is just continuing to\nrealign\nand just being able to recognize that\nall your experience you are not your\nexperiences\nyou are not the result of an external\nresult\nyou know you don't have to take on that\nburden\njust like layers of clothes we've just\nbeen wearing all these emotions like\nlayers of clothes\nyou can just take them off and let go\nthey're not very beautiful\nyeah but you see this is also very\ninteresting because\nawareness is never\nas free and creative\nwhen it's not tethered to an experience\ncorrect\nwhether the experience is that which we\ncall the body correct that which we call\nthe world\nor that which you call the mind when\nawareness is untethered\nwhich we call pure awareness it's\ninfinite\nformless but infinite you know tagore\nhad a beautiful poem he said\nin this playhouse of infinite forms i\ncaught sight of the formless\nand so my life was blessed the formless\nis the real you and it's infinite yeah\nthe form\nis a phenomenon and as the phenomenon\nit's you as that phenomenon so when you\nsee yourself\nin an object we call that beauty when\nyou see yourself in another person we\ncall that love\nbecause ultimately there is only the\nself as both the subject\nand the object of experience absolutely\nabsolutely incredible deeper every time\ni sit down with you\ni always get another revelation and\nanother thing to focus on genuinely i'm\nnot just saying that i can just\nsit and listen to you because yeah i'm\njust trying to piece things together and\ni really hope that when the book comes\nout\nwe can sit down again i'd love to and go\ndeeply into\njust the book comes out maybe we go into\nthe steps\nthat's what i think so i think that\nwould be amazing how about we go into\num living the awakened life absolutely\ni'd love that i'd love to do that\nyeah because today i feel like we've\nreally been able to capture your story\nand your background in your journey\nand when the book comes out in october i\nbelieve living the awakening that's when\nwe'll go into that world so diva we end\nevery interview with the final five this\nis a rapid fire quickfire\nround uh answers have to be one word or\none sentence\nso the first question is what's your\nfavorite principle in a book you've\nwritten\nwhat's one of the number one principles\nor how can i\nserve how can i serve beautiful thank\nyou wonderful answers second question\nif you could get everyone in the world\nto start doing\none thing every day what would it be if\nyou could task the world\nand they could take on one practice what\nwould be that one ask yourself\nwho am i what am i and see what happens\nokay awesome number three if you could\ndefine the human experience in one word\nwhat would it be\nsacred and profane amazing\nnumber four what do you feel is your\ngreatest accomplishment\nthese days i would like to say my\ngrandkids ah beautiful and question\nnumber five what is one thing you're\nlooking forward to\naccomplishing this year\nall learning

facebook and all the other\nplatforms twitter etc please go and\nfollow him\nhe is a real example of everything he\nshared today his practice of yoga his\npractice on meditation everything he\nspeaks it's just\nemanating from you all the time being\nwith deepak for a few moments you\nyou get to experience that too so please\nplease please go and follow him his book\nmetahuman\nis coming out in october we will do\nanother interview for that book because\ni believe there's so much to dive into\nand today we've been able to uncover\ndeepak's incredible life\ni didn't know all of that i'm sure all\nof you didn't as well so please go ahead\ngrab the uh\nseven uh spiritual laws of success as\nwell it's a phenomenal book one of my\nfavorite ones so i highly recommend that\nreading before metahuman\nwhen it comes out later this year but\ndeepak thank you again thank you for\nthis\nincredible incredible opportunity it's a\nprivilege thank you and thank you for\nbeing such a supporter of
