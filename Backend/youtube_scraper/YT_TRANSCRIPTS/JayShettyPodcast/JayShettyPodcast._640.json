podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you that come back\nevery week to listen learn and grow\ni love the community we're creating the\npurposeful conversations\nwe've been having over the past few\nweeks have just been\nabsolutely phenomenal and today's guest\nis going to take us to\nanother level i've been looking forward\nto this conversation for quite some time\nsince we connected on instagram and\nthrough a mutual friend\nand today i'm getting to hear about a\nstory that i think a lot of us\nmay know very little about but has had\nsuch a big impact\non our lives today's guest is the one\nand only\ngenie bus one of the most respected\nnames in all of basketball\nshe's the controlling owner of the\nbeloved nba franchise the\nla lakers jeannie started her stellar\nbusiness career\nat a young age learning from her father\nwho's widely considered to be the\ngreatest owner in the history of the\nsport\nshe's also shown that she's unafraid to\nmake big moves\nand under her leadership the lakers won\nthe 2020\nnba championship their first\nchampionship\nsince 2010. please welcome to on purpose\ngenie ginny thank you so much for doing\nthis and jay thank you for\nall the inspiration that you provide um\nyou know on an everyday basis you know\nlittle\ngems that you know sometimes just\nright when you really need to hear\nsomething your your voice is so\ninspiring and your messages are you know\nwell received and very appreciated well\nthat means the world coming from you\nuh you inspire so many through the work\nthat you do and so\nif my work's touched you in any way i\nfeel extremely blessed\nand grateful but i wanted to start off\nfirst of all by\nthanking you for the championship from\nlast year and all the success\ni've been a i always talk about this\nthere's there's very few teams that are\nknown internationally i was born and\nraised in london\nand so the only two teams we ever really\nheard about\nwere the chicago balls and the la lakers\nthose were the the two biggest teams\ni've been a lakers fan since\nand when i moved to la only two years\nago\ni think i moved here at the same time\nlebron came across and i was thinking oh\nthis is this is\ni was like this is great timing for me\nand and it was absolutely\namazing to watch but i saw that adam\nsilva the nba commissioner\nrecently called you nba royalty uh what\ndoes that mean to you how does that feel\ni guess you could say i was born into\ninto this position\nand so maybe that's how royalty um\nuh fits into the equation because i\ndon't feel\num you know i don't feel that i'm\nprivileged or\nyou know have just been given something\nwithout a lot of work\nand but you know to to have you know\nadam silver say that about me i think\nit's just because i've been\naround 40 years in this business\nno i i completely agree with you and\nthat's what i want to dive in today i\nthink\nuh from what i know of you what i've\nlearned about you\nuh you have so much depth and such a\njourney to share with us today\nand you're absolutely right that often\nthe media and the news\nlike in in the three-minute interview\nyou miss that context of someone and who\nthey are and\ntoday i hope we get to learn that i i\nwanted to start\nwith your childhood and because i think\nchildhood is so\nimportant in framing who we are tell us\nabout a memory that you have\nfrom being a young girl that you feel\nhas had such a big impact or impression\non your life today\ngrowing up i always wanted to work\nin the family business that i loved\nbeing\naround family and being connected and\ncontributing some way to the whole\nto the unit to the family and um\nyou know i think my dad saw that\npassion that i had for work\nat that time when he was building his\nwealth\nhe was in real estate that's how he made\nhis money\nand so i always thought someday i would\nbe\nworking in real estate and and\ndevelopment\nbut as as soon as he had the opportunity\nsports was his love and he felt that\num you know if he could\num you know buy the lakers um\nhe also bought the king's hockey team\nand the forum where they played\nthat he wanted um the opportunity to\num build a team\nand make them successful he he wasn't\nborn in los\nangeles but he moved here\nlike so many people who live here have\nand the city embraced him and he loved\nthe city and he wanted to give back\nand do something that he felt was\nimportant and he felt at that time\nthere was such a bias for\nteens on the east coast we heard about\nthe boston celtics and the new york\nknicks and the philadelphia 76ers\nthat um you know he wanted to make the\nlakers\ngreat and that would be his\nhis love letter to the city of los\nangeles\nand that's what he did and in 1979\ni was a high high school senior and\nhe he purchased the team and\nour family business pivoted from real\nestate\nand to sports and entertainment and\nthat's\nyou know that's when i started to work\nand um\nyou know i've loved it ever since i i\nnever thought i would be sitting here\ntoday as the reigning\nyou know controlling owner of a\nchampionship team but here we are\nthat's beautiful what do you think was\none of the biggest lessons or skills you\nobviously have so much love for him and\nand the work he did and the path he took\nwhat was one of the biggest things\nyou learned from him and what do you\nthink one of the biggest things you\ntaught him\nthat maybe you shared back with him he\ntaught me how to treat people\nhow important it was to um\nto give people respect no matter what\ntheir circumstance\nwas and um you know he\nyou know i still to this day i love\nhearing stories of people who\nwho met him along the way and um\nyou know he he treated you know the the\nmost powerful\nbusiness tycoons the same way he treated\nthe guys um you know pulling up his car\nat the valet\nalways treated people with love and\nrespect\nand kindness and um that\nwas something that you know i i will\ncontinue to carry on\nand he instilled that value in me i\nthink\nwhen you ask me what did i um\nteach him that no one's ever asked me\nthat question before\ni would say that um he\nwas always um\ninspired by my my sense of calm\nabout myself about um you know\nlearning you know through different\nkinds of\ntherapy and um you know just\nreally um you know kind of taking\nuh responsibility for me as a person\nand being disciplined and um\nyou know i think sometimes he kind of\nsaid you know you work too hard\nyou know take a weekend off don't you\nknow\nso as as my dad i think he\nhe he kind of got a kick out of how much\ni worked and how much i applied myself\nand i think he appreciated that yeah\nthat's wonderful i always think that\nteaching and learning is an exchange\nisn't it it's whoever it is whether that\nperson's\nyour parent or your partner or your\nfriend it's it's always a two-way thing\nand i'm sure\ni'm sure he was so inspired by you and\nlearned so much from you as well so\nthank you for sharing that with us i'm\nreally glad that we went there now\ni read that you obviously became general\nmanager of the la strings at the age of\n19\nand i'm thinking to myself wow that is\nthat's that's incredible\nfirst of all at that age uh at that time\nto do that\nwhat if has there been a similar\nexperience from that time\nthat has felt very true today like have\nyou found some connection or parallel\nwhere you're like oh we went through\nthat when i was 19\nand i'm experiencing the same thing\ntoday what are some of those leadership\nparallels that you're seeing in your\njourney when my dad named me\ngeneral manager of the la strings at the\nage of 19\num you know i was like oh great i now\ni've i've got a team to run\nand and team tennis consisted of four\nplayers two men and two women\nthat you drafted and they played each\nkind of tennis meaning\nwomen's singles men singles men's\ndoubles women's doubles and mixed\ndoubles five sets\nand the scoring was cumulative so um\nit was the brainchild of billie jean\nking who's one of my mentors\nbecause it was a a way of\nmen and women competing together where\nthey equally contributed to the outcome\nof the match and you know that's the\nkind of\nthinking that she does about gender\nequality and i\nso appreciated it so now i'm in charge i\ngo to my dad\nand i say hey dad i have to draft a team\nyou know let's let's go over the draft\nand let's pick players and he said\nyou know i really want you to\nto pick the team i want you to know\nwhat it feels like to to have success\nand also if it doesn't work out what it\nfeels like to fail so that you'll know\nyou'll learn that lesson and i was kind\nof taken aback by that\nbut he he wanted me to to either own the\nsuccess\nor experience the failure and that was\nsuch a gift\nbecause he wasn't gonna you know\ntry to you know put training wheels on\nme he wanted me\nto to take responsibility to feel that\nposition and i i so appreciated that\nand uh luckily in that first year i\ndrafted martina navratilova and\nwe won a championship that year so um\ni guess i um i got a taste for winning\nearly on\nbut i i really appreciated the the faith\nthat he had in me\nand that he empowered me and when i look\nback\nand i think wow you know that he took a\nbig risk because\nhe he really didn't know how things\nwould turn out\nbut um you know there's people along the\nway\nwho who believe in you and that that\nchanges\nyour whole dynamic of how you envision\nyourself\nand so you know i i learned that lesson\nof of you know when people\nyou know see you a certain way that that\nyou know you can accept that\nand and believe it yourself sometimes\nyou're\nyour own worst critic and your own fears\nare what hold you back\nand you know allow you know to\nto be you know people's opinion of you\nto be reflected\nand accepted yeah i love what you just\nsaid there were so many things that you\nsaid and i hope everyone who's listening\nis taking notes right now\nuh because there's a there was a\nbeautiful thing you said your father\nshared with you which was\nhe wanted you to own the success and\nexperience the failure\nand when you when you said that i\nthought wow what a powerful lesson to\nallow someone to do\nand and to learn to do where we own our\nsuccess we we celebrate it we value it\nwe take responsibility for it\nbut that we experience our failure and\nthen what you just said there at the end\njuni i feel you're so right that\nwe live in a world today where everyone\nhas an opinion about everyone and\neverything\nand it can be really hard for our\nself-esteem because\nwe already have an inner critic and now\non top of that we have external critics\nand that can become a really loud voice\nyou started leading so early on\nwhat was one of the first times you\nexperienced that you know\nfar before where you are now where you\nstarted to realize\nthat your relationship with yourself had\nto be a priority\ni truly believe that and you said it so\nwell\num you know that um i mean i've i've\nbeen\ninspired by so many great leaders you\nknow billie jean king\ndavid stern phil jackson um you know\npeople who\num didn't let the critics or the\nthe outside detractors um\nfeed you know that the outcome in other\nwords\nit's like you have to be fearless and\nsometimes it's hard to do\nand sometimes you could you you might\nsay\ni got to put on a face today for the\nthe people i'm leading and maybe i have\nsome doubts but they can't see that\nand i have to be strong and i have to\nstand my ground\nand you know i guess i i um\nyou know learned that because believe me\ni i had\nmany failures along the way on my path\nand i'm i'm sure i'll have more\ncoming up in my future that's just part\nof\nof being a leader and and not being\nafraid to stand up for what you believe\nin but know\nwhat your you have to know what\ndirection you're going\nbecause if your doubts might be about\nwhich decision you're making and you\ncan't\nyou can't be a leader like standing on\ntwo different sides of the fence\nyou you have to be decisive and you have\nto\nto to believe and stand for what\nyour values are and you know i i feel\nlike i'm\ni'm a values oriented\nleader that that my values dictate\nmy decisions and and when you are clear\nabout what you value\nthen the decisions become very easy i\nlove that you just spoke about values i\nin my book last year my first chapter is\nentirely about setting you and defining\nyour values so\nhearing you say that ring so true how\ndid you\ngenie develop your values because i\nthink a lot of people hear that today\nbut they don't really know\nhow someone chooses their values how you\ndefine them and\nand also then how you use them and it\nsounds like you're absolutely right as a\nleader you have to make some really\nbig decisions you don't get to kind of\ntoe the line and\nsit on the fence as you said tell us\nabout\nwhat you what your values are in\nleadership and and how did you develop\nthem where did they come from\ni think the most important uh value that\ndrives me\nis integrity and it's about being\ntruthful\num and and you know\nand you know like you know the cliche\nlike say what you wait uh do what you\nsay and say what you do\nyou know like that you you um are\nconsistent\nin the in your decision making and\num you know you don't look for excuses\nand that if if you if you didn't live up\nto your expectation that you can\naccept it instead of trying to find\nsomeone to blame\nin this day and age you can't sit by the\nsidelines you can't\nsee something that's wrong and ignore it\nand so that that that's really important\nto me and that that's like\nintegrity throughout an organization\nthroughout society\nand that's really holding yourself\naccountable\nand you know speaking the truth\nand not trying to you know lay off blame\nif things don't go your way such a\npowerful quality\nsuch a hard thing to truly like\nembody every day and it takes work i'm\nsure it takes work to\neven practice that on a daily basis and\nthe amount of attention it takes\nwell you know i i think we all continue\nto evolve\nand that's why like like what you bring\nto the world is so valuable because you\nhelp\npeople learn about themselves and\ncontinue to evolve\num and you know just from all the\nthe um social unrest that we experienced\nthis past year and um i\ni had to make a decision um\nyou know i posted on my social media\na letter a horribly and i get a lot of\nthem\nunfortunately but it was a letter\nusing words that you know discussed me\nand i decided to post it on my\nsocial media with the words blacked out\nso that it didn't offend anybody\nbut i i did that because i wanted my\nwhite\nfriends to see that racism\nexists in this world and that\nyou know it it we can't turn\na blind eye anymore in\nand living that with that example and\nand you know whatever i can do\nyou know i'm i'm willing to do because i\nthink it's important\nand i think that so so many people just\nyou know if it doesn't affect me then i\ndon't\nwhat do i care well if it affects one\nperson\nthen it affects us all like we have to\nto\nrealize that we're all part of a\ncommunity and that\nif if there's unfairness then\nthen we're not living up to what\nwe can truly be as human beings i'm so\nglad you raised that i'm so glad you\nshared that\ni saw you post that letter and if anyone\nhasn't seen it first of all i highly\nrecommend you follow genie on instagram\nbut then\ngo and see that piece too because uh\ni felt and i i love sports i i consume a\nlot of sport\nbut i felt that the nba and\nthe lakers did a phenomenal job of\nstanding up with integrity as\nactivists through the sport i really\nfelt that i mean when you're consuming\nthis sport you could see\nthe mba had taken a really clear stance\nand then of course the lakers have taken\nsuch a clear stance\nand and and that's not an easy decision\nand it's a big decision but\nas you said it came from a powerful\nplace why do you think\nit's really interesting because what you\nwhat you just said it's like you know a\nlot of people can say well yeah it's not\nour space it doesn't affect me\nwhy did you and the lakers feel it was\nso important to be a part of that\nmessaging\nin the sense where you felt we feel this\nis going to have an impact were you\nthinking about younger viewers were you\nthinking about all views like where was\nyour mindset when you're making a\ndecision like that\nwell you know and when i talked about my\ndad you know\nand what i learned from him and the\nvalues that he instilled in me\nand and the respect for human beings\nthat he had no matter what their\ncircumstance\nwas you know that's you know this is\njust\nyou know the next step this is what um\nyou know the lakers are you know\nchampions of the nba and a well-known\nbrand around the world\nbut we also belong to a community\nand um you know there are people in our\ncommunity that are suffering\nand if there are people who are\nsuffering then what can we\ndo and we can stand up for what we\nfeel is right and um you know i don't\nthink of myself\nor our organization as activists i think\nwe're just\nilluminating what needs to be\nknown and what needs to be seen and\num you know to have a player like lebron\njames\nwho i am so proud of and so\num honored to stand beside in so many\nthings um i think he represents\num so much of what the lakers stand for\num he is our leader he has you know led\nus back\nto the the top of the nba and\num you know and when we lost\nour beloved kobe\nand gianna bryant he was there\nto lead us through the darkness and the\npain\nand you know brought laker nation\ntogether so that we could mourn\nour um our favorite son kobe bryant\nyeah no and this is why i love hearing\nyou speak about these themes and topics\nit's\nit shows me what a what an incredible\nleader you are and what what breadth of\nvision you have like it's such a it's\nsuch a wide\nvision it's you know we could be sitting\nhere just talking about sports\nand stats and numbers and you know that\nkind of stuff and\nand obviously i we knew we weren't going\nto talk about any of those things that's\nwhy we did this\nbut but i love hearing that because i\nthink anyone who's listening or watching\nright now can see that\nbecoming a leader of an organization in\nan industry\ndoesn't stop you from illuminating on\nthings that are meaningful to you it\ndoesn't\nstop you from being who you are and\ncaring for people i think\noften we feel that when you become a\nleader you have to kind of toe the line\nand\nbe really specific and then you can't go\nout of your area but\nwhat you said there beautifully is you\ndon't see yourself as an activist you\nsee yourself as\nilluminating things that are important\nto your community\nand and i'm guessing that you felt a lot\nof\nsupport but i'm sure the players also\nfelt a lot of confidence knowing that\nthe team felt that way knowing that you\nfelt that way like\ni'm sure that builds a lot of trust how\nhave you built trust over the years\nbecause i think\nthat's one of the hardest things in\nleadership like it's you can have a\ngroup of people that win\nyou can have a group of people that\nsucceed but trust\nespecially these kind of themes require\na lot more trust\ntell me a bit about what you've learned\nabout trust over the years genie and how\nthat's\nbeen built well i think in in my\nbusiness\num you know there's if there's a lot of\nego\ninvolved and when there's big decisions\nthat need to be made\nit seems like everybody you know\nlooks for the scapegoat like you know\nand\num and unfortunately the media\ncan be complicit in posting\num you know a reporting on\nan unnamed source and so what\nwhat what i've seen in my experience is\ni've seen\num when a team has to trade a player\nand what if that player goes on to the\nnext team and does better\nwell then that's going to make me look\nbad so now they have to create a\nnarrative\nthat this guy doesn't work hard enough\nor this guy\nyou know was bad in the locker room and\nthat i cannot tolerate i cannot tolerate\num a person um\nyou know destroying someone else's\ncharacter\nto pump up their own value\nand you know so when when the media\nquotes\nyou know unnamed sources i throw that\nout the window\nlike i don't i don't listen to that i\nwould never be a part of that\num but i know even in in my own\norganization when we were struggling\num for a few years there were there were\nso many leaks\nin our organization that that you know\nnow you can't have integrity you can't\nhave trust\nbecause when you're bringing your your\nleadership\ntogether to talk about something and\nthen\nthe next thing it's there's an there's\nsomething\nin the media that was spoken behind\nclosed doors\nnow nobody trusts each other well who\nwas it\nfinger-pointing and you know\nit's it's completely undermining to\nan organization to try to build any kind\nof success\nso you know we have\nextinguished the the leaks we have built\na level of trust and now we don't have\nthat um you know who's stabbing me in\nthe back\nwho who's supposed to be on my side but\nis setting me up for failure\nand you know when that with all that\ndistraction aside now this is what\ncan be accomplished you can accomplish\ngreat things\nand it doesn't mean that oh we have the\nformula of how to win a championship\nbut what hap what happens is that we\nexperience\neach other in in the best way possible\nthat we can let down our guard and and\nrely on one another\nand allow each other to to complement\nyou know my skill set with your skill\nset because i know you're not gonna\nyou know make me look bad and um you\nknow\nthat's how the pieces come together to\nto be stronger than\nthe sum of its parts and um\nyou know we we got lucky that we we won\na championship because it\nit does take luck it takes um you know\ninjuries you know avoiding injuries and\nall that\nbut um you know we came out on top and\num we've got a really special thing\ngoing\na team that truly cares about each other\nand lebron signing an extension and\nanthony davis signing\nan extension is really a great\nreflection\non that you know what we're building\nhere and that that's what\nfor me that's what is the fulfilling\npart of it\nis that is the trust and the the\nconnections and the relationships\nthat we build and then the winning\nhappens\nright so um you know that's\nthat's how it yeah that's your metric of\nsuccess like that's\nlike winning the championship of course\nis an incredible metric of success\nbut the deeper measure of success is\nthat trust\nthat that rebuilding together that\ndesire for people to want to commit and\nstay on those uh\nthose are the real signs of something\ntruly being created\nis what i'm hearing and yeah and what\nyou were saying around\nit sounds like you've just created\nreally clear boundaries uh of\nof what your expectations are because i\nfeel when you were talking about the\nidea of\nyou know having people around you that\ndon't trust you or having people where\nthere are\nchallenges and conflict i think anyone\nwho's listening and watching can relate\nto that in whatever workplace they're in\nlike everyone\ngoes through that on a daily basis where\nyou don't know if that person is going\nto stab you in the back to get promoted\nor\nor that and so i feel people can relate\nto that but it sounds like you've just\ncreated\nreally clear boundaries for you and your\nteam and you're trying to hold everyone\nto a high standard\ntell me about what do you think genie\nhas been your\npersonal biggest and i use the word\nchallenge because i think failure often\npaints a negative view but what would\nyou say has been your personal\nbiggest challenge in your life and how\nhave you\nworked to overcome it wherever you had\nto go internally\nto overcome that challenge that's a\ngreat question because i\nrecently experienced that it was you\nknow when\nwhen uh magic johnson stepped\ndown as the head of our basketball\nit really took me by surprise and\nagain like that i don't know really\nwhat's happening right now\nand that's when um you know\nthe people that i i truly trust that are\nclose to me\nsaid you know you're you have to you\nhave to\nhave an organization that reflects\nwhat's important to you\nand you know you're you can't fight\nwhat's happening out with all the\nspeculation and the media\ndon't fight it just\njust be quiet and do your work and\nand that's what we did and and you know\nso\num it and and it was the hardest thing i\never\ndid was you know reading horrible things\nabout me\nor other people i work with and you know\nyour\nyour your first instinct is to punch\nback\nyou want to you know you want to get you\nknow tell people\nshut up and like and and you know so but\nyou know what for as much as they know\nthat's they're reacting to what they see\nso you have to let people on their\nopinion\nbut you know what the truth is and so i\nhad to\njust keep my mouth shut and not react\nto to the negative and do the work\nand that's um you know that's what we\ndid\nand and again we we were the fortunate\nwinners of the the the championship\nwhich is always the goal\nbut um really what i learned was\nthat i could trust the people that i'm\nsurrounded with\nand that that was always what was\nimportant to me to have\num was that that trust that\nthat i give that i would give back and\nand\nit's it's such a pleasure to work with\nthe people\nthat i work with now and i you know\nthere there was you know\na moment when when magic stepped down\nbecause he was such a an important part\nof\nwhy lebron came to the lakers to begin\nwith\nthat i thought lebron might decide hey\nyou know this isn't what\ni signed up for you know um you know i\nwant to be traded\nyou know he didn't he didn't do that\ninstead\nhe he um he knew what the truth was he\nknew\nthat the organization was well run he\nbelieved in what\nwe were doing he believed in me and that\nwas\nthat was such a turning point i can't\nimagine the levels of\nuncertainty when something like that\nhappens like the the level of\nuncertainty and uh\nthe the questioning and the insecurity\nabout what and if and what's this person\ngonna think and say and how's this gonna\nreact then when you're dealing with all\nof that\nit's uh i i wonder what does jeannie\nhave to do before she's in the boardroom\nright it's like what do you have to do\nbehind closed doors behind the seats\nwhat are your what are your practices\nand some of your habits maybe genie that\nyou do that\nthat allow you to stay you were saying\nthat the biggest thing your father loved\nabout you was your ability to work hard\nbut be calm\nand and he liked your calming presence\nand even today i i feel such a\nyou you have and i've seen interviews\nwith you before i've seen you celebrate\nand i've watched you many times\nbut you have this beautiful calming\nenergy about you even even through this\nscreen\nand i wonder what are some of your\npractices and habits what are some of\nthe\nuh internal rituals that you've created\nfor yourself\nthat are that are not there in the\nboardroom that aren't there on the news\nbut\nbut that you're doing every day or every\nweek or every month that are\nhelping you be calm during that\nthat chaos having a routine in the\nmorning is really important and before\nyou go to sleep\ni think that's that's valuable but um\nyou know i i i i was um with\nphil jackson um for over 15 years\nliving with him and um you know\nhe you know they call him the zen master\nso you know i i got a lot of\nof my um you know kind of clarity\nabout what's important and how to focus\nand um watching him\num you know you know there's a lot of\nups and downs\nin our business you know just\nin everyday life there's ups and downs\nand\nhe he's uh so consistent\nin um how he approached things he never\num he always looked forward there was\nalways a path\nhe never dwelled on what had just\nhappened if the team had lost by 60\npoints\nyou know it was you know\nit was forgotten about or and not\nforgotten it was\nyou know okay well now would we we have\nanother game coming up\nit's always looking forward and i guess\nthat's\nthat's the beauty is that we always have\nthe next day\nwe always have um you know\nwe do our morning routine\nwe we deal with what we deal with in the\nday\nand then we we go home and we\nwe have our routine and and we go to\nsleep to the next day\nand we can make things better so i i\nguess there's like a\nan optimism with that but also that\nstaying in the moment that a routine\nallows you and and you know that you're\ngoing to have the next moment and you're\ngoing to do better\nand you're going to have another\nopportunity so there's no reason to\ncollapse\nnow because you're going to have another\nchance\nand i guess that's where i\nyou know the calmness comes because it's\nlike you know there there isn't\nanything that we can't um you know\novercome or take on you know things\nmight not always go our way\nbut you know we have another day yeah i\nreally appreciate you saying that i\nthink\ni think that's something we often forget\nthat we often forget that there's\nanother opportunity you can take another\nshot you can try again you can rebuild\nyou can\nrecreate you can change this you can\nadapt and sometimes we live too in the\nmoment where we're just like oh no this\nis all there\nis and it's not going right right now re\nnot realizing that\nthere's always a growth now one of the\nareas we\ndon't see growth is that you know there\naren't many other\nwomen yet that are general managers of\nfranchises and\nuh i think that that's something that we\nare going to see change it is something\nthat\nyou're a forefront leader in and will\ninspire so many\nuh do you ever feel though that and and\nthis is a\nan honest question do you ever find that\nlonely or do you find that\ninspiring like how do you see that do\nyou see that as like\noh no one understands me and no one can\nrelate to me because there's not many of\nus\nand as you said you've had such amazing\nmentors\nuh in that space who've also felt that\nloneliness or inspiration how do you\nprocess that i know what it meant to me\nas a young person to see women in\npositions of power\nand how inspiring that was for me so\num you know i i you know in the last 40\nyears i've seen\na lot of change in uh women um\nhaving powerful positions in all areas\nof\nsports and entertainment um and\nyou know it's just you know\ni my advice to to young women\nis to follow your passion and you know\nthat will lead you to where you want to\nbe\num and and you know if if\nyou feel that that being a woman\nyou know it's such a competitive\nbusiness that if\nif if somebody you know\nwants to get an edge on you\nand they think that if they can push\nyour buttons because you're a woman\nbecause you you might think you're less\nthan\nthan they are than a man then they've\nthey found your button they found a way\nto get to you\nso you know i i can tell you that gender\ndoesn't matter you know it's you know\npeople are what matter talent is what\nmatters\nand that's what you know will take you\nto where you want to go\nhow much how much have you engaged with\ngenie with whether it's therapy or\nmindfulness in your own practice in your\nown life like how much of that has been\nuseful to you because of the extreme\npressure you've\nhad to handle throughout has that been a\ntool that you've reached to into your\ntool kit that has been\nthat has been powerful for you\nabsolutely i think\ntherapy um has been a huge benefit for\nme\ni even had the experience of\ngoing through group therapy which was\nreally\nreally valuable and i think there are so\nmany\nopportunities for people now you know\nbefore it was like\num i think therapy was something that\npeople\nkept quiet or didn't talk about but\ni think the more we can shine a light on\nit and show\nhow valuable a tool it is about\num learning about yourself um\nyou know in in group therapy one of the\nthe things that i learned\nwas it was a co-ed group probably about\n10 or 12 people i forget and these are\npeople you knew or people you didn't\nknow\nno didn't know oh wow oh wow like around\nthe same\nage you know experience\num i was going through my divorce\nand um so a co-ed group was good for me\nand um you know people just dealing with\neveryday\nproblems and finding a place where they\ncould discuss it\nwell there was there was one guy that he\nno matter what\ni couldn't connect with him like\neverything i said\nhe made a face at he just didn't like\nanything and\nand i knew it was i was coming to a\npoint\nwhere i was gonna have to confront him\nand and ask him\nwhat is it about me that you don't like\nbecause it was driving me crazy it was\nhaunting my dreams like\nyou know like i i could always find\ncommon ground with people\nand um you know i finally you know got\nup the courage to say to him like i i\ni just get the feeling you don't like me\nno matter what i say or what i do\nor you know can you tell me about that\nand he said\noh it's not you it's just that you look\nlike someone\nthat i went to high school with that i\nasked out and she didn't go out with me\nand like he was kind of surprised that\nhe\nhe didn't realize that he had an\nattitude towards me\nnot for anything that i did just because\ni reminded him of somebody\nhe he had a situation with\nand that that just like i was like oh\nwow\nyou know it's like the whole world\ndoesn't revolve around\nme it's not always me that's the problem\nright and so you just you kind of opened\nmy eyes to like\nyou know you know sometimes people\naren't going to like you and it has\nnothing to do with you\nand you can't spend all your time\nworrying about making sure everybody\ndoes like you\nbecause it just it may just not happen\nthat's such a good story i love that\nthank you for sharing that's such a good\nstory yeah it's\nit's such a truth not to take things\npersonally and not to\nmake everything about you and and and\nwhat you just finished with that\neven if you did everything right not\neveryone's going to like you\nand that's just not possible and that\nthat\nthat addiction we have to hoping that\nevery person we meet loves us\nuh giving that up allows us to receive\nlove from the people who do love us and\nlove the people\nwho who do love us in our lives it\nreally frees up so much mental space\nbecause\notherwise we're just pursuing this one\nperson or\ntwo people that we want to impress and\nwe want them to think we're amazing and\nit can be a whole life can be wasted\ndoing that i was going to ask you\nthe same question that i asked you\nearlier about your father\nand you've mentioned lebron a few times\nwhat's something that lebron's taught\nyou and what do you think you've taught\nlebron\ni wish i could teach lebron something\nhe's he i\noff the court off the court or on the\ncourt or on the court\nhe's he's he is um you know\nhe is he is fearless and i i\nyou know i've i've watched him and he\neverything he he says or does has a\npurpose\nyou know it isn't just wasted words or\nto get on camera\nit's it's like if he says something it\nhe's thought about it\nand it it it means something and he's\nvery consistent\nin his message and he's\nhe's you know i think he's like a real\nlife superhero\nbecause he he fights for what he\nbelieves in\nand he's the strongest person i've ever\nseen on the court\nand you know he's he's just he's been\njust uh you know an\ninspiration and i've enjoyed getting to\nknow him\nas a person and he has um\ninspired me and i hope that i've\ninspired him because he's\nhe has a daughter and i hope that you\nknow as a father\nhe sees what is possible for his\ndaughter because\nyou know the collaboration that we have\nin winning the championship yeah thank\nyou for sharing yeah it's beautiful and\nand i\nand i love hearing the the genuine\nfriendship you have with so many of the\nteam and the\nand the players and i wanted to ask you\nbecause it's\nsuch a deep and dear memory of mine and\nobviously such a big impact\non whole of laker nation when i think\nabout\nkobe bryant and gianna brian it's uh\nuh when when i sat with him for the\ninterview\ni've i've never felt that energy in the\nroom before it was it was different it\nwas\nit was completely different and\ni i say that to people and i said that\nas soon as i'd interviewed him but\nand i'm not and i just want everyone to\nknow i am not over amplifying it\nit was that in the moment it is not\nbased on\num the events afterwards that make me\nsay that it was very real\nwhat was one of your memories with him\nthat you think people may not be aware\nof or something he shared with you or a\nmoment you guys shared that\nthat you think really embodies just who\nhe was and and how\nimportant his legacy and messages you\nhave to remember like we met\nkobe when he was 17 you know\nand he he grew into this he evolved into\nthis great\nman this great leader and\nhe learned so much about himself through\nbasketball\nand you know his lovely oscar-winning\nfilm\nyou know dear basketball where he talks\nabout that love\nand what experience he had and\num you know\nhe i i i guess the story i would share\nis um when he had made the decision\nto retire from the game\num and at that time i i\ndidn't oversee any of the basketball um\nand you know but i obviously ran the\nbusiness side of the team\nand kobe asked to meet with me\nprivately and he'd never\ndone that before and you know was\nunusual because i didn't run the\nbasketball side\ni mean obviously i knew kobe but that\nwas my first\nyou know meeting that he asked for and\nat that meeting\nhe you know shared with me that he\nhe wanted to announce his retirement\nfrom the game he loved\nand he had a very specific way he wanted\nto do it\nand it required planning and logistics\nto make sure because he wanted he wanted\na letter to be given to every\nfan in attendance at the game i think\nit was two weeks in advance that we had\nand um he wanted you know nobody would\nknow\nanything that he was going to make this\nannouncement\nuntil he made it there was no leaks\nthere was nothing\nand i knew who i could trust in the\norganization to\nexecute this that it wouldn't get out\nand that it would the announcement would\nbe on his terms\nand that's when i think he he really\nhe knew that i was there in his corner\nfor him and you know that that\ngift that he gave us by\nannouncing his retirement at the end of\nnovember\nof that season allowed\nthe whole nba to pay\nyou know tribute to him so every get\nevery\ntown we went to it was you know because\nthat at the t\nthe time the team at the time was you\nknow we were in last place we were\nnot doing well and um\nbut you know the lakers sold out every\narena that we went to because\nthe fans that you know booed him and\ndidn't want him\nshowed him their love and i think he was\nso\nmoved by that like i don't think he even\nif he\nyou know saw that coming but he gave\nall of us such such a gift because he\nshared with us\nsomething so personal and allowed us\nto show him our love um\nyou know that that just meant the world\nto me that you know that he\ntrusted me and he knew that i would do\nthe right thing\nso that he could retire on his terms\nwhich was so important\nfor his mental well-being to leave the\ngame on his\nterms so um you know he\nhe uh i know the energy that you're\ntalking about\nhe had the charisma um\nthe knowing who he was um\nand he and you know we all know the\nmamba mentality and the tough\nbut it all was from love everything came\nfrom love the competitiveness\nhe loved playing he loved when an\nopponent\nyou know was he loved playing the\nceltics he\nyou know it was all love that was that\nwasn't\nanger and you know that that\ndetermination just was\nwho he was like he wanted everybody to\nchallenge him because it brought out the\nbest in him\nand that that was uh such a beautiful\npart\nabout him was um appreciating\nthe journey and um appreciating the game\nand appreciating the opponents that were\nwilling to\nto lace him up and take him on and try\nto stop him from\nscoring 81 points that's amazing thank\nyou for sharing that and thank you just\nthis this whole interview i appreciate\nyour\nyour candidness your your\nopen-heartedness you've been raw and\nvulnerable and\nopen and i'm always going to remember\nthis interview for\nhaving felt that i've experienced\nheartfelt and ego-less leadership from\nyou\nand and i really appreciate that like i\nthink that's very rare today\nand often we we think that that doesn't\nexist and even the mentors you mentioned\nor\nthe people in your life you mentioned\nit's amazing to see that the people that\nhave risen to the top\nhave all had that in common they were\nfighting for something greater than\nthemselves\nthey were working for a purpose higher\nthan themselves\nand that it was all heartfelt and it was\negoless and fearless\nand so i want to thank you for your time\nwe end every interview with a fast\nfive this means these questions that\nhave to be one word\nor one sentence answers uh so these are\nyour fast five genie\nlast five minutes you've been so\ngenerous with your time you usually do\nshort interviews you gave us a whole\nhour which i which i really value\nuh but these are your fast five so genie\nwhat's the best\npiece of advice you've ever received\ntell the truth\nyou know face the cameras just own it\namazing and what's what's the worst\nadvice you've ever received\ni i i i don't have a good answer for you\ni'm sorry\nno that's fine you just don't remember\nit right yeah\nyou don't remember it that's fine uh i\nwould say the third question is\num what's been the biggest surprise in\nyour career what's been the biggest like\nmoment where you felt an element of\nsurprise when in winning\nat that championship um you know\nyou know i my goal was to to see the\nteam do well in the playoffs\nand and to you know to be the last team\nstanding\nin what lebron has said\nyou know was one of the hardest\nchampionships ever\nto win after living in a bubble during a\npandemic\num you know that was\nthat the championship of 2012. i love\nthat\nquestion number four what's something\nthat you're so confident about but other\npeople may disagree with or may they may\nnot understand yet but what's something\nyou're so sure about\nyou gotta have passion you gotta have\npassion that's what will\nattract people to you that's it you know\nyou you have to\nyou have to find what inspires you\nand and you know and be authentic about\nit\nyou can't create that great answer all\nright fifth\nand final question for you is if you\ncould\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be no lying just i i can't\nstand liars\ni can't stand uh hypocrisy and and\nno stop lying tell the truth\nown the truth it'll set you free amazing\neveryone that is genie
