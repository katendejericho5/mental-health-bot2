attached to those kinds of things\nlater on in your life\nyou become really i your idea of\nyourself is very strong\nso that's when you become very\nself-aware\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to

an\nactor and also his philosophy on life\ncornell thank you for doing this man\nthat's a rousing\nrousing introduction um wow thank you\nit's all honest it's all true\nand the best thing about this is kunal's\nhad one of the busiest weeks\nhe's flying off to london tonight and\nhe's still found time to do this you're\na real friend\nno thank you i'm so glad thanks for\nhaving me i'm a huge fan of everything\nthat you're doing so anything i can do\nto be a part of it\nthank you and and the way we met is so\nso fun because\ni remember there was just so many random\ntouch points so we have a lot of mutual\nfriends\nwho'd mentioned you to me and said oh\nyou two would really get along you could\nyou could talk for hours\nand then the crazy thing is i was at a\nlakers game with my wife\nand she sees you she's like that's going\nout from big bang there and you were far\naway so we didn't we didn't get to say\nhello that day\nand then literally the week after we\nwere talking yeah and it was like this\nbeautiful series of events\nwhere you're just like the universe is\ntrying to bring you closer to someone\nthat's how i felt anyway no absolutely i\ncall it the six\ndegrees of separation uh from being\nindian that's what happens that's what\nit is\nbut uh let's let's start with the indian\nquestion because i know you have a\npassion for this\nwhen's the last time you played qriket\noh um\nthis time i was home after big bang i've\nbeen home\nfour times since may this time i was\nhome we bought a cricket\nbat and in the driveway my cousin and i\nwere\nplaying and it was such a wonderful\nfeeling because it brings back all the\nmemories\num i watch cricket incessantly too so\ni'm a huge fan\nyeah i know you're a premier league guy\nyeah i'm sorry\nit's always fascinating to hear about\npeople's interests and when you first\nmoved to the u.s you worked as a\nuniversity housekeeper\nyeah i was in the housekeeping\ndepartment i didn't really know what i\nwas getting myself into but\nthe the minimum wage in oregon was\nslightly higher than most of the states\nso it was a nice\namount of money for me um and i just did\nit you know i didn't think too much\nabout it it wasn't such a big deal to me\num so i did anything that was required\nof me tell me some of the things that\nyou had to do any fun story city\ni mean cleaning out you know the\ndormitories is not a\nthe big trash compactor and you pull it\nout and the things you see people throw\naway it's quite disgusting\num especially in a university that's\nlike the worst time that's a\nand also uh cleaning out uh professors\nwho had passed away\nuh cleaning other offices that was a\nvery interesting experience but\nthe most fun i ever had was on was it on\ni think monday evening monday afternoons\nwe had to wash the church windows\nand i would get to use the power washer\nand that was like for me the most\nincredible experience\never you know i was like arnold\nschwarzenegger like shooting down you\nknow\nit was really it was fun i i got fired\nunfortunately because well i didn't get\nfired but i\nwas got released because i forgot to put\nthe lorry the little lorries that we\ndrive in park\nand it rolled off the cord into the\ngarden where all the students were like\nstudying and stuff did anyone get hurt\nno one got hurt thank god and then my\nboss who's this guy named greg i'll\nnever forget he had this tongue like a\nsnake and he drove like old vintage cars\nhe was the coolest guy ever knew he took\nthe fall for me\nit was really sweet wow yeah he was the\nsweetest guy ever why did he do that\nhe's just a nice guy and he liked me are\nyou still in touch with him no\nokay we have to get this together yeah\nexactly greg greg\nif you're watching this somehow i want\nto get this video to you because\nthis is special you you helped canal not\nhave like a criminal record or i don't\nknow what would have come with that\nuh but no that's amazing and the reason\nwhy i want to go back to the beginning\nand everything for you is because\nobviously you grew up in delhi\nright and what was life like growing up\nin delhi for you personally like what\nwere the experiences there that you feel\nformed who you are today or maybe parts\nof you that you wanted to\nprogress and change as well yeah that's\na great question the beauty of growing\nup in india for me was\nthe the familial the idea of family\nis beyond just four people or five\npeople you know you don't grow up just\nwith your parents you grew up with your\ncousins you grew up with your cousin's\nparents aunts\nuncles friends friends parents the\ncommunity around you is so large\nevery night someone is over at the house\neating with you or at you know\n8 p.m someone knocked on the door oh\nthey're coming come on what do you got\nin the fridge you know you eat so\nuh it teaches you that it really\nyou feel so full you feel so emotionally\nfull which is a lovely thing and also\nnot just\nsocially but also grief when people die\neveryone shows up\nyou know so you get to experience death\nwith people we were never shielded away\nfrom death at a young age\nanyone passed away you went to the home\nthe first thing whatever you're doing\neven if you're in school you just leave\nschool and you show up to people's homes\nand there's a\nyou know there's a dead body there and\nyou you experience that firsthand\nand how a community is built around that\nand um\nand i missed that even to this day\nliving in america for almost 20 years\ni miss that you know sometimes if i want\nto have a meal with someone it takes two\nweeks to schedule it and i understand\neveryone's busy\nbut i miss that sort of everyone on top\nof each other all the time\nkind of love because it's very familiar\nto me\nyeah absolutely no i i know you've i can\nrelate to that in a smaller way\ngrowing up in london but in an indian\nbackground as well families\nfamily is definitely a bigger part of\nthat and since we've moved to the us\nwhich has only been three and a half\nyears\nbut it's the same but we're trying to\nbuild our our little family yes\nwith friends and so i think we have to\nsomehow bring it over here for sure\nbut tell me about that that's really\ninteresting what you said there because\ni think\nit's such a powerful point that's often\nmissed that in that eastern society\nyou're so used to seeing death\nwhich is a really powerful point you\nmade what was it about\nthat that you feel was powerful for you\npersonally like what about that as less\nleft such a lasting impression when i\nask what did you learn from india that's\none of the first things you remember\ni don't think that you you don't think\nabout it at the time\nyou just do it you know it's not like oh\nthis is something that i have to do or\nit just becomes part of your life\nso you're not sitting there saying this\nis so profound there's a dead body in\nfront of me you know no it's not like\nthat\nit's just the simplicity of the way the\nculture works you just show up\nin times of need and\nit's what i find sometimes in society\nright now what's happening is we're\nreally sterilizing all experiences in\nlife\nyou shake someone's hand you've got to\nuse antibacterial soap\nif someone coughs you look at them like\nthey're sick you know\nthis kind of a thing is really taking\naway the humanity\nfrom us as it is in the internet and\nsocial media and all these things are\nwonderful tools but it also is sometimes\ntaking away the humanity from us\nand i think now when i look back i think\nthe profound impact it had on me that it\nwas\nit was messy and it was full and it\nwasn't\nsterile and empty you know and i think\nthat's maybe what that's why now when i\nlook back it feels profound but at the\nmoment\nyou're just like wow that woman is\nwailing way too loud and\nyou know i i gotta get to the badminton\ncourt at four pm i have to be here like\nyou're just a child you're not\nyou're not so self-aware at the time you\nknow yeah just becomes part of your life\nyeah and i think that's a really good\npoint i think most of our lives\nare processed in hindsight always like\nmost experiences are more powerful when\nwe look back on them and we reflect and\nthat's why if we don't look back and\nreflect we often miss out\nbecause it's quite hard especially as a\nkid to appreciate or\nintrospect or reflect on any present\nmoment that you're in like you're saying\nyou want to run to the badminton court\nyeah well i think also when you're\nyounger the imp\nthe attachments or the identifications\nto the things around you aren't so\nattached yet\nit those things you predominantly get\nattached to those kinds of things later\non in your life when you become really\ni your idea of yourself is very strong\nso that's when you become very\nself-aware\nyou know but when you're young you're\njust that's the way you should be\nactually you should not be attached to\nanything and you should go with whatever\nthe universe is giving you\nyeah and you always wanted to be an\nactor that was always the plan\nyeah i was always a ham that's what it\nwas i mean i was always just doing\nanything to be in front of the audience\num no i don't know you know i think when\ni was like probably 19 i was in college\ni really enjoyed acting\ni really enjoyed there there was\nsomething about\nbeing an actor is you know you're trying\nto find the truth\nin in the moment that's really what\nthat's why people get addicted to\nacting in my opinion is because it\nreally forces you to dive within\nand find the truth in a moment and once\nyou experience\ntruth or you touch truth for the first\ntime\nit's an experience that i don't know\nit's very addicting you want to find it\nall the time and there you can't find it\nall the time there are takes when you\nare not present in their takes when you\nare present but once you experience it\nonce you truly\nare saying these words that you know\nyou've learned they're coming out of\nyour mouth but they're coming out of\nyour mouth like the first time\nand this person who's been rehearsing\nwith you for like you know a few months\nis saying these words\nand you know they're coming out of their\nmouth you know what's going to come but\nit's like it's happening for the first\ntime\nthat is probably how you would define a\nspiritual awakening almost you know\nif that's what happens because you can\nrecreate that on stage sometimes\nand that's what happened to me on stage\nand i was like oh this is it this is\ni have to i have to have this in my life\nand that was it for me\nyeah and so whenever you're acting\nyou're always trying to find that truth\nfind that moment\nwhere you can experience this again\nyou're always just trying to find\nthe moment where you're absolutely\npresent you're speaking and you're\nlistening\nyou know like this what a good skill\n[Laughter]\nwhat an amazing skill for everything\nelse in life well you know that's the\nhard thing about being an actor though\ntoo\nis that you you have this incredible\nintense experience\nand then you have to go back to your\nlife you finish\nacting on set and then you show back up\nat work\ni mean show back at home and how do you\nbalance the two\ntell me about that first experience of\nhaving this\nincredible experience on set and then\nactually have to walk back into your\nhome\ni was doing a thing that i didn't\nrealize until later where i\nwouldn't go home right after i would\nalways go out and have a drink\ni'll always go out and have a whiskey or\na martini\nor hang out with someone sometimes if no\none was\neven around i would just go up to the\nbar myself\nto wind down or whatever it was\nbut i realized now in hindsight that\nthere are much healthier ways\nto do that and i think it's hard i think\nit's hard to experience something so\nprofound every evening or every moment\nand then come back and try to reinstall\nyourself\ninto the reality of everyday existence i\nthink that's why so many artists\ntake to drugs or alcohol or\nother forms of staying high because you\nexperience this incredible high\nand then you like have to come home\nand how was your day i mean how do i\nexplain what my day was it was an\ninfinite experience into the cosmos of\nreality i mean how do i talk about that\nyou know\nso at that time i was escaping um so i\nwas not doing it in a very healthy way\nand i seem to have i think\nfound yeah absolutely yeah that's so\nthat's so profound because\nwe we forget that and i think not\neveryone sees that like not everyone\nknows someone\nwho is that much in the public eye yeah\nif you and and when you think about\ncertain stars who become\nfamous at 12 13 years old 15 years old\nand they're performing to audiences of\nlike 80 000 100\n000 people at that age like that's an\nincredible rush of adrenaline and\nyou know the the chemical imbalance of\nthat is just\ninsane and then to go back to normality\nyes it's and it's the same for you going\nfrom set to that it sounds like one of\nthe toughest things to do and it's\nsometimes it's hard to empathize with\nfor people because they're like oh well\nyou have it all like you know it's\namazing you have money that's yeah\nthat's yeah\nthe number one thing is if you if you\ntalk about something like this someone\nsays oh\nor did your you know did your paycheck\nnot cash this week\nyeah that's the standard answer right um\nwhich is also understandable yeah i mean\nwhat am i complaining about when\nobviously all the comforts of my life\nhave been taken care of\nso but let's let's dive into that\ntransition because i know we've spoken\nabout that before\nand the canal that i know and i've met\nuh you know whenever we've spoken we\nhave really\nevolved deep meaningful conversations\nwhere we're both exploring and i\nabsolutely love them\nbut you also told me over time when\nobviously what you're mentioning now\nlike\nalcohol self-medicating and that tell me\nabout that transformation because\ni think that that's really important to\npeople because no matter what\nfinancial situation people are in no\nmatter what\nstatus people are in everyone goes\nthrough getting addictions\nbad habits and getting lost like there's\nalways that option in life and\neveryone's experienced that tell us\nabout that transformation and how you\nwere able to\nto look for that gap and free yourself\nfrom that jail that you talk about you\ntalk about finding keys\nyeah yeah tell me about that experience\nof like releasing yourself from that\njail um\nwell first of all i'm so grateful\nthat it happened because i never would\nhave come home to myself\nbecause ultimately what i was doing was\njust\nrunning away from myself i began to\nbuild a facade that i began to\nbelieve in you know i began to believe a\npersonality\ninto reality that i have to be a certain\nway i mean i was young i was at grad\nschool i was on this show i was making\nmoney\nand i thought i had to be a certain way\nand i'm very lucky that i have a family\nthat supports me and loves me and whom i\ncan talk to\nbut it got out of hand before i knew it\nwas out of hand\nand i began to feel anxiety which i had\nnever experienced in my life as a child\nor as a youngster\nand i didn't know what it was but i was\nfeeling slightly uncomfortable and so\nwhen i did i would drink\noh i'm kind of feeling weird let me just\nhave a drink have a great time\nand that went on and on and on and it's\nnot like i ever drank during the day\nor anything but i couldn't wait for the\nevening to come so i could take the edge\noff\nand that one drink turned into five or\nsix\nand that anxiety never went away\nin fact the further i tried to push it\naway the more it rose and then it\nwas driving on the highway and i was\nhaving panic attacks and i was being an\nelevator\nin a tall building and i'd be having\npanic attacks you know\nand i was it was bad\nand i remember going home to india and\ntalking to my parents and saying\ni mean i'm something's wrong with me and\nyet i was very functionable\nduring the day no one could tell\nobviously i was working and that was\nmost important thing to me was working\nbut i was not in a good place and i was\ndoing things and putting myself in\nsituations\nwhich i shouldn't have been doing\nbut all to run away from myself\nand i didn't know that at the time and i\nwas given a pill\nto take in case i had another panic\nattack from someone\nand i remember i was feeling panic on\nthe 17th floor of the building and i'm\nlooking at this pill and i'm about to\nput in my mouth\nand a voice comes and says before you\nrun away from yourself i want you to\nexperience yourself something like this\nvoice came i threw it away\ni said even if i experience my own death\nin this moment i just want to experience\nit\nand then that from that day on i said no\nmore running\nif even if i'm feeling anxious no more\nrunning from it even if i'm feeling\npanic\nno more running from it you know\nno more running and that takes a lot of\ncourage\nit i don't think it was courageous i\nthink my house was on fire and there was\nnowhere else to go\nyou know it doesn't i don't think of it\nas courage\ni think of it as everything burnt down i\nmean there was nowhere\nthere was no other choice you know there\nwas no\nthere was no more running you see there\nwas no more running\ni had to look within what is this\nanxiety about\nwhat is this panic about what is it that\ni'm so afraid of\nwhat is it why do i feel so separate\nfrom everything that is happening here\nwhy are there two or three or four or\nfive or six\ninside what is this\nbut it was so beautiful because it was\nthe beginning\nof the end and so often that's what it\nis is it takes that\ni was describing to someone yesterday\nwas like you know\nwhen when two people are boxing there's\na lot of dancing there's a lot of\nmovement but then when\none boxer gets the other boxer in a\ncorner then that boxer really has to\nfigure out their way it's like when\nyou're pushed into that corner\nnow you can't just dance and prance\nabout and run away from it like you're\nsaying\nyou have to figure out what your\nstrategy is and how you're gonna get\nclose to that and figure out that person\nbecause now you're pent up in that\ncorner and you're stuck\nand i feel like sometimes life has to\nfortunately unfortunately some people\nsay unfortunately i say fortunately\nsometimes life just has to put us in a\ncorner where we stop running\nand you can't run like you're saying you\nrun out of options instead of running\nyou run out of options\nand and then you have to look with them\nbut i think so many of us struggle to do\nthat because we struggle to know what\nthe first step\nis to look within yes and that's why we\nrun sometimes we run not only to get\naway but because we don't even know\nwhere to start\nabsolutely how did you figure out where\nto start for you personally or what was\nit that really helped you in that moment\nbecause i love what you're saying by the\nway this is no but you're right\ni think there is that\nthere's an overwhelming feeling within\nus that we need to figure it out right\naway\nand because of that we want three steps\nto give us\nawakening or enlightenment or whatever\nit is that people are searching for\nyou know but i've been thinking lately\nthat\nit's i don't think\nthat awakening or enlightenment or\nspirituality\nis for everyone either\nbecause you have to give\nup your opinions about the world\nyou have to give up your ideas of the\nworld\nyou have to give up your ideas of who\nyou are and how you view the world\nto truly be free to truly be free\npeople want to be more loving and more\nconfident and more positive and more\npeaceful\nyet they're not willing to exchange the\none thing that is in the way\nwhich is their idea of themselves\nso how do you start right how do you\nstart\nbreaking down the idea of yourself you\ndon't\nyou just look and say oh am i\ndoing this out of just a behavioral\npattern that i've been doing for\nwhatever amount of years or am i doing\nthis from a place of\ntruth or reality you know is this what\nis actually happening in this moment\nor is it only happening because of my\nperception of it\nthat's really where you start is to\nbecome aware of yourself\nand it's actually very simple but\nbecause\nwe then get in doctrine by\n10 steps to do this or 17 steps to do\nthis\nor 105 steps to do this it's the same\nthing that people are doing\nthey're just using steps to again run\naway from what it is\nultimately if you want to be free you\nhave to come back and have the\nconversation with the one that is in the\nway and that's here\ni am in the way of my own freedom\nbecause i believe this one\nto be who i am\nand to truly find that one who you are\nyou have to lift the veil of that and\nsee what's underneath\nand that's the hardest thing it's not\nwhere do i start it's are you willing to\nput\nyour opinions about the world and about\nyourself\naside and that's the thing about\nawakening and enlightenment and all the\nthings that people want\nno one gets to be excluded from your\nlove\nonce you're enlightened you can't be\nenlightened and\nkind of not enlightened okay you can't\nhave\nfaith and not kind of have faith you\neither have\nfaith or you don't have faith you either\nare\nin this moment or you're not in this\nmoment\nand that's the rub that's why it is hard\nfor people\nbecause the the reason say i don't know\nwhere to start i don't know where to\nlook in\nthis eye that's talking is the one that\ndoesn't want to\nlook at itself because it's skirting its\nown\ndeath in a way because once it's caught\nit's over\nthat's the thing once you actually catch\nthe lie inside\nit's over you know yeah but\nthat's where you start you just start\nbecoming self-aware wait oh\ni've always thought it's like this oh\nwait it's not like that oh okay\ncool now i'm free i'm a little freer now\nyou know you begin to wear your\npersonality a little lighter\nyeah dude that's so well articulated man\ni love that\nliterally everything you just said right\nnow is just so well explained because i\nthink so often these\ntopics get quite heady and we've talked\nabout that before but you've really\ngrounded it and\nwhen i'm listening to you it sounds like\nit sounds like when you figure out how a\nmagician does a magic trick\nyes right like once you've figured it\nout it's like\nit's not you're like oh oh i get it now\nit totally makes sense but when they\nwhen you don't know how it's done\nand you don't know how they picked that\nexact card that was yours\nyou're like whoa like and it's the same\nwith yourself like\nonce you figure out the trick yeah that\nthe mind is playing or like you said the\nperception you've built up of who you\nare\nis playing all of these are just tricks\nand when you start to look beneath the\ntricks\nyeah you start seeing actually it's not\nbut that's free like but that's why i\nmet it\nthat's why meditation is very important\ni i don't think that meditation is the\nonly thing\nthat's the important thing in all of\nthis but it is important because it\nstills your mind it gives you quiet\nwhen your mind is very noisy it's very\nhard to look through the layers\nit's very important to even if you don't\nmeditate maybe it's just sitting in the\ncar with no music whatever it is\nfinding time to be still is very very\nimportant\nbecause through the stillness you can\nsee\nand in the storm it's very difficult to\nsee\nyou know and you're right\nyou're already the piece that you're\nseeking\nthat's the truth about life you are\nalready that which you seek\nit was the same francis of assisi said\nright what you're searching for what\nyou're looking for is already where\nyou're looking from\nyou're already home you just keep\nrunning in circles trying to find the\nhome\nbut the one trying to find the home is\nthe one you have to give up\nyes this is the paradox of life\nit's and it's beautiful and you're right\nit is simple\nbut that's not the end either because\neven after you awaken\nthere's still a journey and that's the\npoint of all of this\nis stop trying to find the secret elixir\nof life because\neven when you do find it you realize\nit's unknown\nso just give up and just enjoy enjoy i\nmean enjoy the fruits of what it is that\nyou have here\nyeah you know because even when you're\nenjoying you're still like i'm enjoying\nbut i shouldn't be enjoying because i\nshould be working harder and why work\nharder\ni'm sorry but like just be peaceful yeah\nwhy work harder\nit's all self-made goals are lovely to\nhave but\nthe more goals you have when you achieve\nthem then you want more goals then you\nwant more goals and then you want more\ngoals you're trying to fulfill an ego\nthat will never be\nfilled live a simple life\nbe peaceful be happy what more i mean\nwhat more\nbecause all the things you want to\nachieve you want to achieve because it's\ngoing to make you happy\njust be happy now it's really simple\ni love it it's awesome i i want to dive\ninto that now with you because i think\nsimplicity is such an interesting\nconcept\nand when i lived as a monk both our\ninternal and external lives were simple\nand simplified i would say not even\nsimple simplified\nyou eat what you're given you don't\nchoose what you eat\nyou sleep in a different place every day\non a map\nbut you don't have one place that you\nsleep so nothing is yours you\nwear the same style of clothing every\nday so there's no you know all that kind\nof stuff but\nso that simplifies the outer layer but\none thing that i\nfound and this is what i found profound\nand i want to ask you this as well is\nas i came back into the real world real\nworld we'll use that for now\nthe what i found simplicity in the\ndefinition of simplicity that really\nbrings me alive is simplicity of\nintention\nbecause what i found is that sometimes\nyou can be externally simple\nbut you're complicated up here and so\nsome people live very externally simple\nlives but really it's all complicated up\nhere and then the opposite is true\nwhere you're simple mentally but then\nyour externals are complicated and so\nfor me i was really\nseeking this definition of simplicity\nthat i could live by\nyeah and i was also trying to and i want\nto talk to you about this because i know\nyou talk about this\nthis this kind of never-ending cycle of\nobsession with what's\nnext right like they're always chasing\nwhat's next\nand then i was like but how do you\ncontinue to live in this world\nbe be in this world keep being\nactive because we can't all just sit\ndown and do nothing\ni understand and you and you are too and\nthat's what i want to figure out for me\nthat's my question that\nhow are you continuing to pursue\nany pursuit whatever it may be but\ncontinuing to connect with that\nsimplicity and that happiness now\nhow are you monitoring that balance in\nyour own life of being ambitious\nbeing open to new opportunities but\nstill remaining\nsimple happy grounded present how are\nyou how are you juggling that or how are\nyou\nhow are you thinking through that yeah i\nmean that's a good question\num i'm not saying not any of us are\nmastered it i'm intriguing no i don't\nknow i don't know i\ni think that you said something\ninteresting about the simplicity of\nintention i think that's\nwhere it lies i'm ambitious\nbecause i enjoy acting\nuh you know someone may be ambitious\nbecause they enjoy cars and they want a\ncertain kind of car\nnice that's a beaut who cares that's a\nnice ambition you know\nit is your the problem is in actually\nthe words in the language\nambition is imbued with an emotion i'm\nan ambitious person that person is not\nso ambitious you know\num my goals are like that that person's\ngoal is not like that\nuh i want this kind of a life so it\nmeans this kind of a thing for me\nyou know just do what you want to do if\nif you want to be ambitious be ambitious\nbut don't think i have to be ambitious\nfor a certain way\nof life or i need to be a certain way\njust be what it is and do what it is\nthat in here feels right if that means\nbeing ambitious be ambitious if\ni don't think of it i have to balance my\nlife my life\nis just the way it is it's just that i'm\nnot looking at everything and attaching\nemotion to everything\nthere's no resistance anymore within me\nto my life\nif i have to do something i'll do it in\nwhatever manner is necessary for the\nsituation\nyou know if i have it doesn't mean i'm\nimpervious to anger\nor anxiety or anything i'm sometimes\nhappy\nsometimes i'm sad i just have stopped\nthinking so much about what happens is\nbecause of a perception of the world\nsomething bad happens and an old\ntape starts playing and when an old tape\nstarts playing\nwe get pissed off of that old tape so we\nadd another tape on top of that i am\npissed off because of the old tape is\nplaying so now you've got two tapes that\nare playing\nright then you read 3000 books about how\nto stop\nthat tape to stop that tape and that's a\nthird tape\nso now you have three programs running\nwhen in the first place you could have\nbeen said oh you know what yeah i'm just\nhaving a shitty day and i'm pissed off\ncool next\nand right there it's over yeah it's the\nresistance\nto what is is where it lie where all of\nthe\nthat comes from yeah so\nyeah i yeah totally i completely agree\nthis it's the resistance to not\naccepting what is happening in that\nmoment\nbut even in the acceptance it can add\nanother tape i'm not accepting what's\nhappening\nyeah so it's the resistance every time\nyou're resisting\navoiding running away from not accepting\nyeah if you can just be\nfully here someone passed away and i'm\nfeeling horribly sad\nwhat's wrong with that you know i just\nmade a lot of money i'm feeling\nincredibly happy\nwhat's wrong with that sometimes you\nachieve what you want to achieve and\nthere's still a but\nattached to it why\nyou know that's the simplicity of\nintention that you're talking about\nyou don't have to go to a cave and sit\nfor 10 years to meditate\nyou know you probably your bum will\nstart hurting sitting on the rocks i\nmean\nit's it's okay you don't you can sleep\nin a comfortable bed and just be as\npeaceful\nit's true you can drive a really nice\ncar and enjoy the fruits of your labor\nand what's wrong with that do you have\nto say well there's a starving child in\nin sudan or india or or even in america\nor anywhere\nso i shouldn't enjoy the fruits of my\nlife\nwhy not do it all why not give back and\nenjoy\nit that is the simplicity\nis to accept the totality of what you\nare you\nare all you know i am\num i can have a cup of coffee\nand have a very profound moment or i\ncould be dancing on a table\ntill three in the morning and have a\nprofound moment also why can't i be\nanything that is that i want to be\nno resistance no resistance it's\nmy life it's my expression of this\nconsciousness it's my\nchance to experience this beautiful\nthing that is here\nand and every one of those choices that\nare made in alignment with that\nwill only reveal more that's the point\nthat oh yeah\nthat's that's a very good point yes if\nyou're doing it to run away\nit can be very messy but the beautiful\nthing about living this life\nawake is you begin to enjoy those things\nso much more because they're coming from\na place of freedom\nnot from a place of being trapped you\nknow and that's\nthat sticking thing that's in here it's\nnot like when i achieve this then i'll\nbe free no it'll just be another\nsticking point\nthat's not the answer it's just this\nthing that's in here that's stuck\nyou just have to be like oh what is this\nwhat is this and you realize\ni don't want to say it i guess you'll\nrealize whatever it is that you realize\nfor yourself\nyou know when you look within but it\nstarts here\nand it doesn't start with it\nreading really helped me books really\nhelped me really helped me\nit really helped me think my way into\nhere but the final step you have to take\nyourself\nany any books that you recommend or\nanything that really worked for you\nthere's one coming out in april that i'm\ndying\ni'm excited to share it with you too\nthere's a lot of what we're talking\nabout that's in there so yeah\nyou know i i i started reading um\nlike the secret uh the four agreements\nyes um\na lot of those books uh i read a lot of\ndeepak chopra's uh\nseven laws of spiritual success which i\nlove wonderful and that started the sort\nof psychological journey within\nright to and then i read the untethered\nsoul by michael singer that was the\njumping off point for me because that\nhelped me understand that there is a\nseparation between who\ni am and my mind my mind is recycling\nthoughts\nand i can sit back and look at them oh\nmy god when i experienced that\ni thought i have this is it i'm free\nyeah boy was that wrong yeah yeah yeah i\nremember the first time i read that in\nthe bhagavad-gita like you're not your\nclothes\nyeah you know that like like we you know\nwe just change our clothes every day and\nyou can change\nyour thoughts every day and i was like\nwow like that makes so much sense like i\ncan look at my clothes next\ni don't like those clothes yeah and i\ncan change them and i can put on clothes\ni like those clothes and you can do the\nsame with your thoughts every day i like\nthose thoughts i don't like those\nthoughts let me change those thoughts\nyeah or you can even sit and not listen\nto any of them true\ntrue you only listen to the ones that\nyou're attached to because your mind has\na\n3 000 thoughts that you probably don't\neven pay attention to but you only pay\nattention to the ones\nlike for me even to this day\nbecause i've had a gen even in my family\ngenetic fear of heights or from\ngenerations ago even to this day i\nremember growing up and my father\nwouldn't take an elevator and that sort\nof probably came\nnow he's doesn't now it's he's over that\nbut at that time that's probably where\nit came from for me\nbut even now when i you know i don't\nwant to go on the 65th floor we're\nbuilding because my body the trauma in\nmy body is still\nfresh and it's still there i may not\nhave resistance to it but it's not a\nnice feeling\nokay i don't sit here and say i have to\nclimb mount everest to be free yeah i'm\nfree\nit may it can all exist in here and i'm\nstill free it's okay it's okay to have\nthings\nyou don't have to scrub yourself clean\nof everything\nand then become free you are free once\nyou realize\nthat it's all okay you can continue to\nwork on it\nyou can continue to work on it it's fine\nso even to this day i'll still have like\na moment of\nnow the anxiety is very rare but\nanything that comes up it comes up i was\ntelling you right before this i was\nmoving this weekend\ni said if you ever think you're\nspiritually realized you should move\nyeah or help a friend move i'll have a\nfriend you didn't ask me i would have\nhelped you exactly no no\nno i'll spend one week with family\nthat's right baba ramdas who one ponji\njust passed away lovely spiritual\nteacher just always said that\nevery time you think you're enlightened\nspend one week with your family\nwhich i think is so it's so funny and so\nprofound\nin a way you know your your biggest um\nthere was a teacher muji who i loved it\nwas very important for me to experience\nemptiness for the first time in a\nmeditation i experienced\nnothingness and it was very beautiful\nbut mooji said when he experienced his\nawakening it was\nmost profound you know all these things\nhappened to him and he sat down to eat\nand the first thought that entered his\nmind is why are you eating potatoes\nyou're going to be diabetic\nand he just said i just freed you from\nmy mind why is how can that still exist\nyou know\nand that's funny and because that's just\nthat's the play you know yeah\nabsolutely yeah i remember when we were\nmonks one of the reasons the path that i\nlived\nas worked so well is half the day was\nvery much about your growth\nself and and going trying to find going\nbeyond the self and the other half was\nwith people\nwith other monks with villagers with\ncommunity\nand because we were always told that if\nyou're when\nif you're alone all the time your ego\nwill convince you that you're humble\nit's only when you're around people it's\ninteresting yeah like what you're saying\nabout\nfamily like you if you're always alone\nyou'll think you've become really\nenlightened\nbut actually when you then re-interact\nwith people\nthen you realize where you're really at\nwell in the ancient yogic tradition when\nyou did experience\nrealization yeah you would have to be\nvery carefully taken away and and sort\nof\nmolded and shielded because it's kind of\nlike\nwhen the worm is sheds when the when the\ncaterpillar sheds the skin and becomes\nthe butterfly it's very vulnerable for\nthat time\nand if you experience awakening and you\nhave no guide map or nothing to hold on\nto\nit can be a very very unnerving\nexperience yes it can be\nso you you should do it in a way that\nyou have someone who you can talk to or\nsomeone who can help you through it or a\nbook or a guru or something\nbecause i never really had that but i\nhad people that i listened to and\nspoke to you know through this process\nbut i think it's very important and i\nthink that's where that comes from\nthat's why people go high\naway from people because they want to\nfully understand what this is and mature\ninto that awakening yes because if you\nget thrust back into this world full of\nego\nyou shut back right up you know it's\nlike you have this beautiful\nocean and you're this drop and you drop\nin but a big drop drops in and it comes\nback out a bit and it drops back and\ndrops back you know it goes like this\nand then until you finally merge\nbut in that dropping going away it can\njust shut yeah\nthen it's very hard that's so true you\nknow yeah that's a really good point\nbut uh i know a lot of people listening\nto this probably just wanna be like yeah\ni know you're talking about all this but\nhow do i just be happy how do i just be\npeaceful how do i just like\ni just wanna wake up and you know and\nshut my mind off and i'm just here to\ntell you you can't shut your mind off\nit's a beautiful tool to use you need\nyour mind it's created this incredible\nthing in this world you know this this\nmicrophone i mean\nthis thing it's all because of people's\nminds some guy and some girl saw the\nmoon\nand put up a rocket ship and went to it\nit's just incredible\nwhy would you not want to use that it's\njust that it's using you\ncorrect and you have to figure out how\nto use it\nand that only comes with a little bit of\nlooking at it and training and looking\nat it and training and\nand takes time you know it's like\nlearning the alphabet\nyou start with the abcs by being aware\nthen you start using language\nand then you understand sarcasm and how\nto put sentences together and all that\nyeah we forget that that's a beautiful\nexample we forget that as kids\nhow much patience we had how much\nnon-judgment we had\nlike no one remembers you know\nmessing up as a kid on something at home\nor like falling over\nand walking again and you just don't\nremember it in a negative way you never\nlook to yourself and say\ni fell over 10 times today you know\noh no like you you never did that to\nyourself you just allowed yourself\nto naturally engage with something and\nfor it to naturally progress\nyeah at least i'm talking about like\nbetween zero to five no i understand\nyeah i mean if i was to fall over ten\ntimes right now it'd be weird\nyeah like that i should probably go to\nthe doctor yeah yeah yeah probably\nprobably too probably true\nbut with different challenges now yeah\nit is different challenges it's also\nit's i will say that i think that we\ndrive our\nown cells crazy about all of this i\nthink like i go back to my earlier point\njust stop the stop the obsessive search\nso much\nit might be in front of you it might be\nright here and you're just looking\neverywhere else you know\nyeah it's the obsession with perfection\ni find well that you'll never get\nyeah unless you can i mean i think to be\nhonest you can get\nperfection but to get that you have to\nbe willing to swap yourself out\nand it's and it's almost like to get\nobsession you have to to get perfection\nyou almost have to\nyou have to lose the obsession for\nperfection yes or the idea of perfection\nand what it looks like to you because\nperhaps the attachment\nyeah the attachment also it's because\nyou kind of want to push away the\nugly parts of you and you want to pull\nin the beautiful parts of you\nbut that's just ugly and beautiful is\nalso just kind of a concept\ntake those words away for a second\n[Music]\nand just take away all concepts and see\nwhat's left\nit's all of it so if we take something i\nlike\nlet's pursue that so if we take\nsomething like say envy\nenvy let's take envy or or anything you\nlike let's take one of those things\nhowever movies are good revenue event is\na good thing yeah how do you process\nthat then how does how do we look at\nthat how do we change our view of that\nwhat do we do with that\nas a thought if you look at someone\nelse's life\nand you think oh that would be you know\nthey live in a nice house and they look\nlike they have a nice family\ni want that what's wrong with that\nbut if you look at someone else's life\nand you say oh i want that\noh why do i want that does that make me\nenvious\noh i want that because i'm envious oh no\nwait am i envious i'm not envious\nit's just like this entire tape starts\nplaying yeah what's wrong if you see\nsomething that you like and you want it\ndoes that make you\nwhat's wrong with wanting that\nnow the rub lies and if you don't have\nthat does that make you unhappy\nand the other challenges which which\noften comes up is\ndo you want that just because now every\ntime you see someone with something you\nwant more\nbecause then it's just it's what you're\nexposed to right\nor is it that you really want that like\nyou really feel that's gonna make a\ndifference because i think so many\npeople\nand i agree with you i love what you\nsaid about the non-judgment of it\nbecause you're right that\nif you see something and you like it and\nyou think it's important to you\nand with that intention you pursue it\nthere's nothing wrong with that it's\nwhen you either want to take it away\nfrom that person\nwhere it becomes malicious yeah or\nwhether it\nbecomes a never-ending pursuit just\nbecause you see shiny things all the\ntime\ngoing back to exactly what you just said\nabout the the militia and you want to\ntake it away\ni was thinking about this the other day\ni think that\ninherently it is in human nature to be\ngood\nit just is very inherent in our nature\nbecause we come from\nnature i mean in nature this is the way\nwe are we we\nhave communities and we build\ncommunities and we live together\nin harmony\nand that's why i think it feels so bad\nwhen someone is mean to us\nor when we feel like we want to be mean\nto someone\nbecause it feels very unnatural when\nsomeone says something very mean to you\nit feels very like oh that's that's not\nsomething within you automatically he's\nlike wait that's not this is not how it\nshould be\nand vice versa if you're mean to someone\nit never feels good it never\nfeels good but why\nwhy because inherently in our nature\nit is to be good\nyou don't have to work to be good that's\nwhat i keep saying you don't have to\nwork to be loving\nyou actually are that you just have to\nget rid of the one\nthat is trying to be loving you know\nyeah\nyou stop you are loving\nit's very easy to be closed off and\ntough and mean and it's very hard to be\nloving it's very hard to be loving\nbecause it takes a lot of courage\nbecause someone who doesn't agree\nwith you you still have to love them in\na way\nyou know that's why it's hard to be\nloving because like i said earlier no\none gets to be excluded\neveryone wants to be loving yeah well if\nyou really want to be loving turn on the\ntelevision\nand watch the news and pick out the one\nperson or two or three people that you\nfind\nare the most abhorrent people and see if\nyou can love them\nlove that as a good challenge then\nyou'll know if you've actually become\nthat which it is that you seek\nyou want to be loving but you want to be\npeaceful but\nyou want to like everyone but remove\nthis butt\nand there it is your peace that's\nactually how simple it is\nyou don't have to run away somewhere\nright now in this moment if you remove\nthe butt\nthere you are you're right there\neverything you wanted you know\nyeah i love that man that's beautiful\nthis is great this is awesome see\nnow you can see what we do when we get\ntogether yeah we also go to basketball\ngames\nyeah we do that too we like the lakers\nyeah we're also really fun in real life\nwe're fun and we hang out we make jokes\nand yeah well good night\nlet's talk a bit about that let's we've\nhad a really deep dive let's talk a bit\nabout\ni want to go back because you know it's\nit's easy for us and\nto look at i'm going back to some\nmaterial conversation but because it's\nlinked no no i love it it's spiritual\nyou know the people can look at you and\nthink that you know your career has been\nthis huge success and everything worked\nout tell me about some of the key\nfailures that happened before this big\nmoment in your career where things took\noff because i think it's so easy for\neveryone to sit back and be like oh yeah\nwe found out about canal through big\nbang theory\nlike life just went like tell us about\nsome of the big moments that you\nremember now when you look back on you\nknow like\ngod that was a moment where i just yeah\nyou know that's the one i remember and\nthat's what makes this now so much more\nmeaningful\nyeah i mean look i in i got my\nbachelor's in\ntheater and in business i never got a\ndegree in theater marketing specifically\nmarketing was my degree and i told my\nparents i wanted to be an actor and\ntheir advice which was very sound at the\ntime said look become an actor but have\nsomething to fall back on because it's a\nvery difficult industry and it is a very\ndifficult industry to make it\nand i did that and then i got my\nmaster's in acting\nand all through grad school all through\nundergrad you know this was a very\ndifferent time in america i never got\nany of the roles i wanted really i was\nalways the funny guy\nor the older guy or the the sidekick you\nknow and i would\nsit we were doing the seagull great play\nby chekhov and i wanted to play\nthe lead role and i didn't get it\nand i would sit in the wings every in\nthe side of the theater every\nevery performance and mouth his words\nand uh and i did it with with a lot of\nplays and i kept dreaming that this is\ngoing to be me one day this is going to\nbe me one day and\nyou know i only had 10 months left on my\nvisa otherwise i'd have to go back to\nindia\nand work or england and work which is\nfine too\nand i auditioned for a play in the\nbasement\nof the mac store on fifth avenue\nremember that glass box because i didn't\nhave a computer i didn't have the money\nand this director was in la and she said\nyou know\nthey were setting up i chat i don't even\nknow what it was called at that time\na old video aol video maybe i just\nsomething it was called in the mac store\nthey had that thing\nand i auditioned for this lady director\nin la and the basement of the mac store\nand i got the part on the on the spot\nand i look over i was like crying in\nthis audition so funny\n30 asian tourists are taking pictures of\nme\nthat was a joke um so they don't have to\nbe asian\nthey could be indian it could be any uh\nand then i moved to l.a for seven\ndollars\num a play and i didn't have a seven\ndollars a play\nit was a non-equity show and then i and\ni was living on a friend's couch and i\nwas taking the bus\nwhich if you live in los angeles you it\nwould take me an hour and a half from\nsanta monica to pico\nand um and i was working in a raw food\nrestaurant\ncan you believe i didn't even know what\nraw food was no offense to anyone at\nthat time at that time\nit wasn't as trendy though yeah i\nremember because i got the job off\ncraigslist\nand she said you know about raw food i\nwas like yeah you use less cooking oil\nright\nor something like dumb like that and she\nwas like no we used no oil i was like\nyeah yeah\nless no i mean same\n[Laughter]\nthen i ended up working there and um\nit was a whole comedy of errors i\nremember i rented uh for my final\naudition of big bang i had to rent a car\nto drive to the studio\nand i went to the cheapest car and they\ndidn't have it so they upgraded me to a\ntoyota solaris\nif you ever seen this car and it was a\nconvertible white\ni mean i drove onto that a lot like i\nwas like\nyeah i was like p diddy or something you\nknow and i was playing california and i\nwas like driving i was like yeah\nit was really fun and then when i booked\nthe pilot i bought a car from the\nauction\na nissan altima with a broken light and\ni\ndrove up in the first day of big bang\nand i said\ni gotta get a new car you know\nthere was it was a there's so many\nstories about but it was\nyeah everyone comes from somewhere\neveryone i stopped ever looking at\nanyone who's successful and\nthink they've been given it because even\nif they have been given it\nin some way there's a lot of internal\nstruggle even in that\nthe feeling that they don't deserve it\nis worse\nthan struggling to be honest because\nwhen you struggle you have a real\nrighteousness about it i'm struggling\nbut when you're handed it the feeling of\ninadequacy\nis horrible wow man thank you for\nsharing those i i feel like\ni feel like we're going to need a part\ntwo and three just to dive into each of\nthose\ntwo we talk about the lakers and how\nthey need another piece to in the\nchampionship the a three and d\nguy yeah uh but that's my point is\nsometimes we get so\ninundated with this thing about\nspirituality but it's just a word\nyeah to be truly spiritual means to\nactually live a very\nfull life that in here it's very simple\nand peaceful and here in here it can be\nvery dynamic yeah\nyou can drive a beautiful car and and i\nand\nlike to travel and like nice clothes and\nand also help the poor\nand also do service and\ndo it all why are we living in such a\nlimited\nperception of the infinite beings that\nwe are\nwhy why because\nthe limited perception can never truly\nunderstand what it is to be infinite\nso to become infinite which you already\nare\nyou have to take the one that believes\nin the limited perception\nand put them aside and finally step into\neverything that you are there you guys\nbeing spiritual again\ngod went back to it yeah no no\ni was so close yeah and i and i\nexperienced that too i think you know\nwhen i\nwhen i came back and hence my books\ncalled think like a monk because the\nwhole point is like you can think this\nway\nand this is how to change your thinking\nand everything yes but i'm not telling\nyou to live like a monk\nyou're not not telling anyone to or if\nyou could give up of course i mean\nthat's another thing\nwhy not yeah why not yeah it's open i\nthink that people think oh you're\nspiritual\nwhy do you live it you know why why\naren't you in a in a cave\nwearing you know only cotton made from a\nworm i'm like\nbecause that would be very unspiritual\nof me if i was doing it for a reason to\nprove a point yeah\nif i wanted to do that i would yeah\nabsolutely absolutely\nyeah that is the point being spiritual\nis being who you\nare yes following that intuition yes\nfrom here yeah from here\nonce you're free yeah be who you are\nyeah i've always said that i felt that\nwhen\ni became a monk i felt that when i left\ni felt that when i started making videos\ni felt that when i'm sitting with you\ntoday like\ni'm constantly following that even when\ni get the smallest inkling to message\nsomeone\nand we've done that sometimes yeah after\nmeditation and i message you and\nthere'll be like an interesting point\nwe're like oh i was just thinking about\nyou or we i was just talking about you\nor whatever it isn't\ni i just follow it at all times and i've\nseen it never let you down it's so\nfascinating yeah when you actually get\nthat inkling not impulse i'm not talking\nabout impulsive\neveryone has it yeah everyone has it\nyeah it's good but\nyeah everyone has intuition everyone has\ninstinct everyone has just stop trying\nstop trying to have it yes you already\nhave it\nyes you already have it yeah believe\ni mean you can't kind of believe i hope\nif anything after this video is that\none thing you can't kind of believe and\nkind of not believe\ntoday do one thing just believe believe\nyou are incredible actually\nbelieve it why waste one second in a\nsmall narrow perception\nanymore you are universally\ninfinite believe it\nit's right in front of you you are\nrunning everywhere trying to find you\nare that you are already that you are\nperfect\nand loving and peaceful and you're also\ncrazy and loud\nand angry it's okay it's okay i was just\nlike\nyou know i went nuts this weekend while\ni was moving on something and i was like\nah\nand then it felt so good too i was like\noh there's a tiger in here too you know\nif i need to like if there's\nthere's there's a tiger in me too yeah\nwhen you can laugh there's a buddha in\nme too and there's a tiger in me yeah\nyeah\nabsolutely you know i love it man so\nwe're gonna end today's interview i know\nyou've got a rush off as well\nwith the final five which is our final\nfive rapid fire round\nokay you have to answer in one word to\none sentence maximum\nokay one word ideally but i let people\ngo to one sentence\nif it's expansive and it's you know you\nand if i get them right do i get a gift\nbasket\nno no there's no this is not a coffee\nwith current there is no uh\nthat's what i thought when you said give\nfast there's no gift basket but we will\nsend you your gift afterwards\nokay either way either way some\nchapstick would be either it's oddly dry\nin los angeles\neither way okay cool so the first\nquestion is the last\nkind thing you've done for a stranger\ni gave a\nuh home oh no i can't well yeah oh i\nwe went and bought some food for a\nhomeless person who was outside\nrite aid the other day great okay second\nquestion what's something you once took\nfor granted\nthat you value now time\nnice good answer question number three\nwhat's the one\nquestion you ask yourself the most\nis this for real nice\nuh and that can work in so many ways i\nlove that question that works it sony is\nawesome\nokay question number four uh what's\nsomething about you that most people\ndon't know that would surprise them i\nlove dancing i'm a i love being on the\ndance and you're a great dancer\ni don't know if i'm a great dancer i\njust
