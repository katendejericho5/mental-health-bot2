and\nshare this conversation with all of you\nguys welcome to the podcast it's so\ngreat to be here jay thanks so much for\nhaving me\nno thank you i remember just i think it\nwas a few months ago when we were just\ndming on instagram\nand you kindly invited me to do your\nlive event\nfor how i built this which was\nunbelievable and i'm so grateful for\nthat\nopportunity but i've been more excited\nabout today because i want to hear from\nyou\ni was so excited to have you on it was\nso fun we got an incredible feedback\nand um i mean i i i love your book and\nso i i love what you do and so\nit was great when you reached out and\ni'm so i'm so glad that now now we've\nwe we're you know we know each other\nwe're going to become friends\nabsolutely i love it and uh i wanna\nactually start off with with a\nhopefully a different question than you\nget asked often and it's uh what was the\nfirst thing you\never built uh as a child how did your\nfamily friends parents respond\nto your first ever thing that you built\ni grew up in a\num a fairly traditional i i'm not\nuh religious these days um i have a lot\nof respect and immense respect for\npeople who are religious and\nwho are observing and practice religion\nbut i grew up in a kind of an observant\njewish home as a kid\nmy parents were immigrants and it was\nreally important for especially my mom\nto keep\ntraditions and so friday nights were\nvery important in my home as a kid\nthat's the the friday the sundown it's\nthe jewish sabbath\nand saturday you kind of take a day of\nrest\nforeshadowing i do that today but for\ndifferent reasons\nand as a kid it was really important\nthat our house was clean\nand and bright and ready for the sabbath\nit was just part of our\ntradition growing up uh and so\ni was expected to clean my room and tidy\nit up and\nevery friday afternoon after school i\nwould spend\nhours building these elaborate villages\nout of lincoln logs lincoln logs\nare you familiar with lincoln logs do\nyou know what those are it was a cla\nthey still they're still around but it\nwas a classic american toy lincoln\nabraham lincoln\nyou know the myth was that he was born\nin a log cabin which is kind of true\nand so they were these logs that had\nlittle grooves and niches in them and\nyou could build these\nelaborate homes and structures out of\nthem and i would build\nthese villages in my bedroom as a kid\nfor my dad when he would come home from\nwork\nuh who was not my dad was not\nparticularly observant it was my mom\nreally\nwho this was but this was part of our\ntradition\num at home when i was a kid and so i\nwould\nspend hours building these elaborate\nvillages out of lincoln logs\nand then eventually legos um and i loved\nit it was like a\nwonderful um creative outlet of course\nyou don't think about that when you're\nyou know eight or nine years old but\num but it was a way for me to kind of\nexpress myself and also\num uh you know show my parents something\ni was proud of and then\nfeel pride when they were excited about\nit yeah that sounds\nawesome i i remember doing similar i\nused to play a lot with lego and\nplaymobil and uh some of this similar\nstyle of toys and i remember creating\nlots of\nvillages and castles and boats and uh i\nactually miss it now that i'm talking to\nyou about right\ni know yeah i'm like i want to go build\na train track but yeah\ni need to go and uh get back into it it\nwas so\nit was so interesting building it out\nand i feel when i go to places like\ni don't know if you have that in the us\nwe have in the uk we have lego land\nuh which is like yeah there are a few in\nthe us yeah there's one in san diego\nyeah yeah and whenever i go to those i'm\nlike oh this is so cool like there's\njust such a\nfascination towards building a city or a\ntown out of something very small so i\nlove that thank you for sharing that\nstory and\ni noticed recently also on instagram you\nposted an old\npress pass from your high school\nnewspaper\nand so you've been you've been a\njournalist and a reporter and a\ninterviewer for a very long time do you\nremember the first story you ever\ncovered\nyeah it was uh my hebrew school\nnewspaper\nagain i grew up having to go to hebrew\nschool it's like going to catholic\nschool you know\nyou start off something that you do and\nthen and then some people kind of uh but\nbut it was really you know an important\nthing when i was a kid and and um\ni was the i was the reporter for the\nhebrew school newsletter\num so it was you know about some\nsome some uh uh it was like some some\none of the\nthe the classes um did a performance and\nsing songs and i wrote about that\ni was um i was a journalist\nkind of a a you know a journalist i was\ninterested\nin journalism from a very young age and\ni don't\nsay that um to sound like you know some\nkind of you know precocious kid\nit's not that i was precocious what it\nwas\njay was that i am\nhave always been as a kid i was i still\nam um\neven though i do these very public jobs\nnow i\nam and i think you have a lot of this\ntoo um i'm super introverted\nand actually quite shy i'm not the kind\nof person that can\neasily go into a room and to start\nshaking hands you know it's a very\nthere's a\nit's a very american characteristic by\nthe way the charisma\nwhich is something that i i can find and\nhave found over time\nas i've had to do public things but it\ndoesn't come\nnaturally to me what journalism gave me\nwas a pass was this kind of\npsychological past in my mind to talk to\nanybody\nyou know naturally i'm not the kind of\nperson that would just go up and say hey\ni'm guy roz can i how are you\nnice to meet you and make small talk it\ndoesn't come easily to me\nbut when i had a notepad in my hand and\nthis was going back in\nin all of it in high school i could i\nfelt like as a high school kid i could\ngo up to other kids in high school and\nask them\nquestions because it was for the\nnewspaper i was a reporter\nand so i was doing a job on behalf of\nsomething bigger than me\nand that was what attracted me to it it\nwas\nthis idea that it was like a it opened a\nworld\nto me that i i couldn't access without\nwithout that notepad that safety net i\nlove that answer that that is such a\nbrilliant way of thinking about it\nand i can agree with you more we\ndefinitely have that in common i i feel\nlike\nwhen i told you about how my parents\nforced me to go to public speaking\nclasses\nit wasn't that after i finished the\nclasses i was just happy being a public\nspeaker\nit was not until i actually discovered\nthe bhagavad-gita and the vedas and\nand the spiritual texts that i studied\nthat i felt like i was speaking about\nsomething more than me and beyond me and\nfar more fascinating and interesting\nthan i was and so then i had the\nconfidence to share it because\ni felt i'd come across this treasure\nmine of wisdom\nand i had to share that wisdom with the\nworld and so i can\ni can identify very closely with that\nyeah\nand it's it's it's this\nthis thing that it's like um\nthere's no explanation to it because why\ndid i feel empowered\nwith a notepad and then eventually a\nmicrophone in my hand i mean\nit just something in my brain clicked\nand it enabled me to feel\nsafe and comfortable approaching people\nand having conversations and not being\nworried about being judged because i was\ngathering information\nand that that that was a strong\ngravitational pull for me\nit's what attracted me initially to this\nprofession and later on it would evolve\nand\nand and i would do it for other reasons\nbut that was really the beginning so\nyeah i mean i've got\ni've got my high school press pass still\nto this day\ni just happen to have it you know but it\nreally\nis what i eventually would do with my\nlife yeah you've encouraged me to go dig\nup some old uh\nthings from my life i think it's always\nfun looking back for anyone who's\nlistening and watching right now i'm\ntalking\nto guy raz how i built this the\nunexpected paths to success\nfrom the world's most inspiring\nentrepreneurs here is the book\nuh we've got the link in the description\nso you can go and grab a copy\nanytime while we're listening uh while\nyou're listening uh\nguy what i'm fascinated by and i was\nsaying this to you earlier i think\nyou've done a phenomenal job\nof breaking down the entrepreneur\njourney i mean you've done\nso many interviews with so many\nincredible people and i can't imagine\nhow you'd even start to write this book\nbut i i do want to honestly say that\ni thought everything from the titles to\nthe chapters to the structure was just\nwonderful to see and and i'm honestly\nand i'm not joking at all\ni'm thinking about pursuing a new\nbusiness venture and i'm going to follow\nyour book\nwhile i do that and i can't wait to tell\nyou how it goes so that's that's a side\nnote but\none of the first things i wanted to talk\nto you about is a question i get asked a\nlot\nand it's about this ideas of like how do\ni know\nif this is the thing i should be doing\nand i think we hear this a lot and i'm\nsure you hear it a million times and\npeople are like\nwell what do i start with like how do i\nknow if this is what i\nlove how do i know if this is my passion\nhow do i know\nif this is the idea and you start off\nthe book by telling people to be\nopen to ideas yeah tell us about how\nsomeone finds the answer to that\nquestion\nprobably the question that people ask\nthe most i'm sure you get this question\nthe most of\nalmost any question which is how do i\nknow how do i find an idea the answer is\nyou don't always know right away right\nand\nthe reality is that most of the time\nthe way we come across an idea\nis because we have a problem ourselves a\nproblem\nwe need to solve for ourselves and as we\nbegin to interrogate how to solve that\nproblem for ourselves\nit starts to crystallize in our mind\nthat maybe\nthat problem is a problem other people\nhave\nand could solve other people's problems\nso\na great example of this is my friend\ntristan walker who was on\nhow i built this tristan is an\nentrepreneur\na brilliant entrepreneur and he\nis a black man and he knew and knows\nthat razors were not designed\nfor most black men because most black\nmen have curly hair\nand when they shave oftentimes the hair\nand their beard grows back into their\nskin\nand most razors in the united states and\nand sold around the world\nby gillette and other companies have\nfour or five blades\nthat are designed to cut the hair under\nthe skin\nthe problem is is when it grows out it\ngrows back into the skin\nespecially for men with very curly hair\nand it affects\nmainly men of color and he he knew that\nthis was a problem for him\nand and and he knew was a problem for\nhis friends but nobody was addressing\nthis problem\nand in his mind he thought why isn't\nthere a beautiful\nproduct as good as a gillette razor as\nbeautifully packaged\navailable in the same aisle where\ngillette razors are available why\ndoesn't that exist\nand that was the genesis of the bevel\nrazor which is now part of the procter\ngamble company one of the biggest\nmultinationals in the world they bought\nthey bought the company and tristan is\nthe ceo but it's a\na great example of a problem that he\nneeded to solve and that solved a\nproblem for millions of men\nwhose day-to-day routine\nwas you know in in many cases pain it\nwas not just painful but it was also\npsychologically painful because of the\nscarring that occurred and that just the\nphysical pain of of dealing with that\nand that is how you begin to\nto come up with ideas you begin by\ninterrogating your own problems the\nthings that bother you or that need\nto be improved and we see these all the\ntime jay how many times have you been\nsomewhere and i know anyone listening to\nthis has experienced this\nyou're waiting in line somewhere for a\ncoffee or you're at a restaurant\nor you're in a shop and you think to\nyourself god they could do\nx so much better if they did it like\nthis way\nor man you know if they just tweaked\nthat\nthen the outcome would be so much better\nfor the cut for the customer\nthat's when you start to kind of connect\nthe dots and say wait a minute\nmaybe i can do that you know howard\nschultz\nloved coffee and he loved this one\nlittle coffee\nplace called starbucks in seattle but\nguess what they didn't sell\ncoffee they only sold coffee beans they\nsold great coffee beans but you had to\ngo brew it at home\nbut he wanted to have the coffee there\nand so when he\nbought this little shop he decided to\nturn it into\nsomething much much bigger which today\nis i think the second biggest\nfood company in the world and it was all\nbecause he\nhe saw a problem that needed to be\nsolved\ni i think that's such a great place to\nstart for anyone who's listening or\nwatching right now because\nit's something you experience it's not\nsomething you have to think about you\ndon't have to do a brainstorm\nyou don't have to get a pen and paper\nout you don't have to be reading lots of\nbooks\nit's it's something that we do almost\nintuitively i think my biggest problem\nthat i would love to solve right now\nis me and my wife never know what to\nwatch on any of the streaming platforms\nand i spend every night like flicking\nthrough like\ndo we want to watch this show oh what's\nthis trailer what do you think oh no\nall right do you want to watch this and\nit's we spend the whole night and i'm\nnot coming up with an\nuh coming up with a a solution for this\nbut it but it is interesting that that\nwould be a great starting place\nexactly if i wanted to because it's\nsomething that caused me a lot of pain\non a daily basis\ni'm sure it causes a lot of people a lot\nof pain on a daily basis at least\nfriends that i know and and therefore it\nwould be a good thing to start on\nthis is a huge challenge discoverability\nwith\nnot just with video content but with\naudio content too and so many people are\ntrying to figure out how to solve this\nthis problem because i think for most of\nus we go by recommendations from friends\nyou know in my case watching things is\nreally challenging jay because\ni'm i am i am sort of a weirdo when it\ncomes to watch like\ni don't like anything violent i don't\nlove\nthings i mean i i'm personally\nvery open and and and\nto the world into ideas and and um\nand but i you know i've got two little\nkids so\nit's hard to watch things with a lot of\nlike sexual content or\nviolence or not not only because\nthey're around but i don't really want\nto see that you know i i it's hard for\nme to see it i can't\nlike i appreciate quentin tarantino as a\ngenius but it's hard for me to watch his\nmovies because they're so violent\neven though they're sort of cartoonish\nviolence breaking bad i i stopped\nwatching it after\nthree or four episodes it was too\nviolent even though it's amazing\nso i i agree with you i hear you like i\nhave a really hard time\nfiguring out what to watch i end up\nwatching like\nyou know uh like a wes anderson movie or\nsomething that's that's fairly innocuous\nyou know yeah\nyeah no absolutely i think my the\nclosest i've got to a solution\nis i really trust votes on imdb\nso i believe that if anything is above\neight on imdb it's gonna be epic and\nit always fits and if anything's above\nseven on imdb\nit's usually a good watch if it's a six\ni'm setting myself\nup for a bit of disappointment at the\nend of the night and if it's anything\nlower than a six it is gonna be the\nbiggest waste of my time but\ni love your answer of starting with a\nproblem and\nthat takes us inward straight away it\nstops you from worrying about like\nwill this be successful how much money\nwill this make will i be able to\nexit this company you know all the\nthings that\nwith the people you spoke to and\nobviously they all went\nfrom a problem point of view with a\ncouple of examples that you've so\nbeautifully shared with us and so many\nmore in the book\nhow many people were really thinking\nor vocalizing or verbalizing their focus\non the result how many people started\nwith\nanything to do with the result almost\ndone\ni mean the reality is that\nin virtually every case for virtually\nevery entrepreneur i've i've interviewed\nthey had a vision and an idea and that\nvision and idea\nbecame something slightly or\nextremely different from from how it\nstarted out i mean\nyou know one of my favorite stories is a\nstory of of slack\nright and by the way jay i will add to\nthat\ni have never interviewed anybody\nwho is purely motivated by money because\nif you're purely motivated by money\nyou're probably better off going into\nfinance or getting a job as a lawyer\nbecause you will eventually make good\nmoney\nbeing an entrepreneur is super risky in\nterms\nof of you know going for for the gold i\nmean yes you can make a\nlot of money but but virtually everybody\ni've interviewed is motivated by\na problem and solving a problem and and\ntrying to fix something\nand or build something and and the best\nevidence for that is\nthe the vast majority of people who sell\ntheir businesses\num after 10 or 15 years\ngo and start something else or continue\nto work for the company that bought them\nout because\nit's it's not the gold they're chasing\nit's the\nit's the it's the challenge and it's the\nteam\nit's the collaborative part of it it's\ngoing into the office every day i've\ninterviewed people who have sold their\nbusinesses and then\nand then were kind of pushed out of the\ncompanies and they became very very\nmiserable\nyes because they lost that connection to\nthe people around them\nright yes so in term but in terms of\nlike\nthinking of an idea and it becoming\nsomething entirely different i mean one\nof the best examples of this\nis slack i mean this that this is a\nproduct now\nthat is used by so many people\nespecially in the pandemic era right\nmy team uses it to communicate slack\nbegan as a multi-player\nmultiplayer massive massive multiplayer\nonline game was called glitch\nstuart butterfield wanted to create a\ngame a video game\nhe is a gamer he's a friend of mine is a\nwonderful person and he loves games\nand he brought a team together he had\nalready had a successful\na business called flickr that he sold to\nyahoo so he had a track record he got\ninvestors\nhe brought this amazing team they built\nthis amazing game\nand it wasn't successful nobody wanted\nto play it even though it was a\nbeautiful game it was way ahead of its\ntime and this is 2012.\nso they had to shutter the company but\nbut what they realized very late in the\ngame was that they actually built\nsomething entirely different which was\nan internal communicating\ncommunications network that allowed the\nsoftware developers\nand the sales reps and the development\npeople\nand the backend people and the business\npeople to communicate\njust to internal but a friend of\nstewards from outside of the company saw\nand he was like this is amazing can can\nwe use it for my company's like yeah\nsure here it is here you go\nthat became the product they they did\nnot realize that the\nthe revolutionary thing they were making\nwas was that\ndidn't even have a name they were trying\nto build this game\nbut once they realized that they built\nsomething completely different that was\nreally useful\nthat was the that was the revolutionary\nproduct so sometimes\nthe idea sneaks up on you you know\nand you have to kind of go through the\nother stages\nto get there you know we just did a\nstory about\nand i can talk on and on about these\nstories\nwe did this story about a the largest\nmexican-american\npaleo food company in america called\nsiete foods\nit was started uh started several years\ngreat company\nstarted several years ago by a brother\nand sister from laredo texas\num miguel and veronica garza now it's\nthe whole family's involved they had no\nmoney\nthey really started this out because\nthey built a crossfit gym\nin laredo texas the family ran it\nand the crossfit gym basically ran out\nof money in the end they couldn't keep\nit going\nbut um miguel's sister veronica used to\nmake\ntortillas for the customers of the\nof the crossfit gym out of cassava flour\nand almond flour because\nif you do crossfit there's a good chance\nyou're a paleo you're\neating a paleo diet you're not eating\ngrains but you're in laredo texas which\nis like\none of the capitals of tex-mex food and\nif you love mexican food\nyou're gonna eat wheat and corn and\nbeans well\nshe was going to these crossfitters at\ntheir crossfit gym and saying hey\ndo you want to have a paleo tortilla you\nwant to buy some and that's how their\nbusiness began\nso it began as a crossfit gym which\neventually morphed into a food business\ni had no idea about that and i loved\nthat brand me and my wife loved their\nsauces and their dips and their chips\nand like they're incredible\nyeah they're really tasty and we love\nthem too when we\ndon't want to eat grains or exactly\nsaying like paleo diets like\nit's it's a great brand i had no idea\nthat was their story and i love how\nuh i love how you've shared that point\nabout the pivot and the discovery\nof a product is not how you expect it\none of my favorite chapter titles\nthat you have in here which in and of\nitself\nanswers the question but i really want\nto dive deep into it it's chapter three\nand it's called\nleave your safety zone but do it\nsafely i i just thought that that was\njust told perfectly because uh whether\nit's\nbeen in my own journey or when i'm\nspeaking to people and again the number\none question is well when do i know to\nquit my job\nlike should i quit my job and go all in\nis it because i'm not all in\nthat it's not working or when do you\nknow that\nyou know now it's time to bootstrap and\nget stuck in and when you wrote that\nchapter leave your safety zone but do it\nsafely\ni wanted to understand how does someone\npractice that how does someone\nbring that into reality because i think\nat one point\nor another everyone gets to okay i know\nwhat my problem i'm trying to solve is\ni've started the process we've started\nto create something\nbut now it needs momentum it needs money\nit needs investment and whatever else it\nneeds\nhow do you leave your safety zone but do\nit safely\nyou know there's a myth about\nentrepreneurs that they're all these co\nthese kind of kamikazes that they jump\nout of an airplane with no\nparachute and the reality is that's just\nnot true\nthe vast majority of entrepreneurs as\nyou know jay\nmitigate their their risks i mean look\nat your own story\nyou didn't just one day wake up and\nstart making videos\nbased on the the teachings and learnings\nthat you had assimilated as a younger\nman\nyou didn't just go off and start doing\nthat you were working for\na bigger company and you were making\ncontent for the company\nand through that experience that content\nwas\nrecognized by somebody else then you got\na job\nat the huffington post you built an\naudience and then you had the confidence\nto go out on your own\nbecause you knew by that point you had\namassed this experience and you had\nbuilt a\nplatform on which to stand yes\nthis idea of leaving your safety zone\nbut doing it\nuh safely comes from jim cook\nwho is the founder of boston beer\ncompany the the company that makes\nsamuel adams beer and jim cook was a\nhe had a very safe job he had a career\nat boston consulting group\nbut he wasn't happy he wanted to do\nsomething else with his life\nand he thought about creating a great\namerican craft beer this was in the\nearly 80s when american beer\ni mean monty python was making jokes\nabout american beer at the time\nright it was it was a joke i mean today\nit's crazy to think about because\namerican craft beer is the envy of the\nworld and and\nlove beloved in europe but at the time\nin the early 80s it wasn't\nso he started to experiment and research\nthis idea on the side\nbut he kept his job and he kept his job\nfor a long time\nand he kept working on this side project\nfor a long time as well\nuntil he started to dip first one toe\nand then two toes and then five toes and\nthen the whole foot and then a leg and\nthen\neventually he became comfortable and\nconfident enough and it saved some money\nfrom his job\nthat he gave himself the permission to\nto leap and to take the leap and to try\nit\nalways knowing by the way that he could\ngo back to his old job if it didn't work\nnow that doesn't mean\nthat you know it's an excuse not to try\nhard it just means that\nthere are ways to to take risks\nand to take the leap but to do it in a\nway that\nif it all falls apart it's not going to\nbe catastrophic you know we\nthere's a fetish around failure\nespecially in silicon valley there's a\nfetish fetishization of failure and\npeople say fail big fail fast fail you\nknow\nthe reality is that when people talk\nabout failure especially at a place like\ngoogle\nor you know facebook they can talk about\nit because those companies are already\nsuccessful the people working inside\nthem have already\nhad some successes failure is really\nimportant for all of us to experience\nbut failure can happen in small ways and\nmedium ways and even in big ways but it\ndoesn't have to be catastrophic\nfailure should always be something that\nyou can bounce back from\neven if it's painful it's super\nimportant to experience failure failure\nbut it's it's almost never a good idea\nto put absolutely all your chips on the\ntable\nwithout some kind of mitigation plan\nnot to say it's not important take risks\nyou have to take big risks\nbut you also want to take those risks in\na safe way\nguy tell us about some of the risks you\ntook in a safe way because\nyou like you were sharing about me\nyourself you've been a reporter a\njournalist you've been an interviewer\nand so\nyou know today you're obviously known\nfor being being the incredible brand and\nthe incredible host\nand of how i built this and then the\nname of the book and just you have all\nthese amazing relationships where\npeople open up to you in interviews and\nshare their stories very vulnerably\ntell us about some of the risks you took\nto get to that stage as well because i\nthink often\nit gets forgotten that you've had to\nlive all of this in your journey too\neven though you're telling the stories\nof others yeah i mean look\nmost of my career i was um i i worked\nfor\none one or two organizations npr and cnn\nand\ni was a reporter and it was a wonderful\nlife and a wonderful career\num but through those experiences i was\nable to to gain more and more experience\ni was a foreign correspondent for seven\nyears i covered\ni covered four wars i was based in in\nthree different countries i reported\nfrom 50\n60 different countries um i was able to\ngo to places i\ncould never have imagined and meet\npeople in in who were\nin in desperate circumstances but we're\nalso so incredibly generous i know\nyou've seen that in places like india\nyou find that in the most\ndeprived places in the world people are\nactually most the most\ngenerous those are the most generous\npeople and the kindest people\nand you know at a certain point in my\ncareer\ni i had to decide whether i was going to\npursue this\nlife as a news person and pursue the\nlife of maybe becoming a news\npresenter and and that there's a lot of\nprestige that goes with that\nbut about 10 years ago it it began to\noccur to me that\nif i was going to do something that was\nmeaning more meaningful to me\nit it had to be different it it couldn't\njust be about reporting the news\nit it had to be something that\npeople connected to on a visceral level\nand that was really the beginning of a\njourney that i started where\ni wanted to tell stories about human\nexperiences\nand not stories about things that\nhappened just at the moment\nbut stories that were\nthat were evergreen that were long\nlasting and it was very scary for me to\nleap\noutside of this safe comfortable job\nthat i had\nand to start production companies and\nand to try this on my own\nbut by that point i already had\ndeveloped the experience and a\nplatform and i i by the way i did this\nlater in life i didn't do this when i\nwas in my 20s i did this in my\nyou know my my late 30s um early 40s and\nby the way\nmost first-time entrepreneurs are like\n42 years old there's this there's\nanother myth that that it's all\npeople in their 20s it's not true um and\nthere's\na lot of reasons why it can often make\nsense to gain some experience before you\nleap out on your own\nbut that that was you know that was a\nscary thing to do\nnot just to leave the news but to kind\nof go off on my own and\nand eventually to um to to you know to\nto start programs and and and then make\na\na kids create a kid's company that i i\nnow have with um\ntwo amazing friends we we run a kids\nmedia company we make children's shows\nand we do live shows and\nwe're making all kinds of content we've\ngot books and so on\num and it's scary because you know\nyou're on your own you're sort of out\nthere in the world without the safety\nnet\nbut there comes a time and i and i can't\nquite\narticulate it in words but i think\nit's it's like you know it you just kind\nof know it there comes a time in your\nlife and i know you had this experience\nwhere\nyou say to yourself you know i got i can\ndo this i got this and i am not a risk\ntaker i am not a kamikaze\ni am somebody who really needs that\nassurance\nyou know i didn't grow up with a lot of\nyou know i didn't grow up with family\nmoney i i\ni financial safety was always important\nto me\nyeah having health insurance those kinds\nof things um\nbut there came a point in my life where\ni i felt like\ni could do it and i can't explain why\nbut i think it's because\ni had spent so much time in the trenches\nlearning the craft and getting trying to\nget better at it and i continue to to\nget\nto try and get better at it every single\nday and so\nit was very intuitive it was like\nthere's this little\nyou know angel that landed on my\nshoulder and says you got now is the\ntime you can do\nthis and it and i think that's it's it's\nit's not a very scientific answer but\nit's something inside of us that just\nsays gives ourselves permission\nto make the leap yeah well well i think\nyou did answer actually really well\nand it's it's something i think a lot\nabout and i think it's something that's\nnot\ntalked enough about and that's partly\nbecause of humility and modesty of some\nof the people we sit down with even\nyourself today i mean\nyou know you're what you just said of\nlike mastering the craft\ni think that it's so it's such an untold\nstory\nof repetition and actually building a\nskill\nlike you developed skills you developed\na craft\nand when you do that your self-worth and\nconfidence\nis natural and it's effortless in one\nsense and it becomes something that\nyou can share with others and it becomes\ncontagious i find that\none of the biggest things missing in the\njourney of entrepreneurship today at\nleast in how it's being\nshared is the point that at one point\nyou have to actually have a skill\nyou actually have to master whatever it\nis and your skill may be\nknowing how to iterate the best your\nskill may be\nthe skill doesn't need to be you know\ncoding inside out like that's not the\npoint\nthe skill could be you know how to bring\ntogether a coder and a creative to make\nmagic\nand and i think that that's just being\nso undervalued today like you\nwere a phenomenal reporter with lots of\nexperience that therefore meant\nwhen you went out you had confidence and\ni think that's where that intuitive\nfeeling calling comes from\ni agree i mean and i by the way i'm not\na businessman you know that's not my\ncore competency\ni and and you're exactly right like your\nskill might be\nyou are a great people person or you\ndevelop the ability to identify\nreally smart people who can make things\nhappen or you get really good at getting\npeople to do things for you because they\nbelieve in you i i recently interviewed\nsteve wozniak the\nco-founder of apple and his descriptions\nof steve jobs\nreally brought that home because steve\njobs talent\nwas of course he had an incredible eye\nand an\nincredible sensibility of what what\nwould work what was it beautiful\nand and he had a sense great sense of\nbeauty and also\num functionality but you know he didn't\ninvent the apple\nii he didn't invent the mac he didn't\ninvent the ipod or the ipad but he\nthey wouldn't have happened without him\nyou know the\nuh steve wozniak created the the apple\nii computer and\nall the software but steve jobs looked\nat that thing and said\nlet's make a beautiful case for it\nlet's make this really easy to plug in\nlet's make this really simple to use and\nhe couldn't\ncode it but he understood what people\nwanted and he could\ndirect people to make that happen and\nthat was his genius\nhe was not going in there with a\nsoldering iron\nor tapping the keys with his fingers his\ngenius was\nhe was conducting an orchestra yeah\nexactly exactly and there's that there's\nthat beautiful part\ni believe it's in walter isaacson's book\nor maybe in in one of the other\nstories of steve wozniak looking at\nsteve jobs and he's saying\nwhat do you even do you're not a coder\nyou're not you're not a marketer you're\nnot an engineer what do you even do and\nuh steve jobs supposedly replied\nmusicians played their instruments i\nplayed the orchestra\nand and you know that idea of he he\nwasn't a musician he didn't know how to\nplay the instrument\nbut he knew how to bring it together\nspeaking of uh steve jobs and steve\nwozniak\nyou have a whole chapter on here in in\nthe book called finding your co-founder\nand it's so interesting because that's\nactually a stage at which i'm at right\nnow in\nin something i'm wanting to pursue and\nand i like you as you said i don't\nconsider myself a business person that's\nnot my\ncore competency or skill set it's not\nthe part i find interesting or\nfascinating it's something i've had to\nlearn but it's people that i've\nsurrounded myself by to support me in\nthat space\nwhen you think about finding a\nco-founder tell me about some of the\nbiggest mistakes people may have shared\nand tell me about the solutions to\nfinding a good co-founder because\ni think we're also living at a time\nwhere and i'll be open when i was\nlaunching my businesses\na lot of people said to me they said jay\nlike why would you have a co-founder you\ncould have a hundred percent of a\nhundred percent and you're\nyou know you you have a brand so you\nshould protect that and i was always\nlike hey i'd\ni'd much rather have more people\ninvolved and and get excited and have\nlike you know\nmore energy and more enthusiasm and\nbuild more things because we have other\npeople\nand so i've always had that mindset but\ni think we live in a mindset today where\nit's like no\nown 100 of 100 and don't trust anyone\nwhat are some of the mistakes we make\nand what are the solutions\ni mean there's a famous investor in paul\ngraham\nand his rule for investing in a startup\ni mean he\nthis guy is the founder of y combinator\nhe's an investor in airbnb and you know\nall the companies that came out of y\ncombinator\nhis rule of thumb is he only invests\nwhen there are co-founders\nnow not every business has more than one\nfounder and some\nwork just fine with one founder what i\nhave found\nin interviewing hundreds of\nentrepreneurs\nwho have co-founders who started with a\nwho have businesses that they created\nwith another founder or more more than\none is\nit is going to be extremely hard\nstarting a business it doesn't matter\nwhat business it is\nwill be very hard it doesn't matter who\nyou are it doesn't matter if you're a\ncelebrity\nyou know lebron james by the way has\nmaverick carter they have a partnership\nand they created a business around\nlebron james which is a billion dollar\nbusiness\nhaving a business partner or partners is\ncrucial for\nthe one simple reason which is there\nwill come a time\non any journey where you will want to\ngive up\nwhere you will run into a roadblock and\nyou will say is this worth\nfighting for is this worth trying to get\naround\nand you will say to yourself it's not\nit's better for me to just move on\ngive up but the person who you\nco-founded the company with will say\nwe got this we can get through this\nand there will be other times where\nthose roles are reversed\nwhere you are the person with the\noptimism i have experienced that\nhundreds of times with my children's\nmedia company i have two partners\nmeredith halpern ranzer and mindy thomas\nwe make\nkids content and we make\nwe have live shows and we do all kinds\nand we're we were\nabout to enter into a a phenomenal\npartnership\num there have been so many times on that\njourney over the last four years\nwhere one of us is just feeling so\ndejected or low or we had a setback or\nwe tried to raise money and it didn't we\ngot a term sheet and then it was pulled\nit's all these things have happened\nand at every step of the way there was\none out of the three of us who was like\nwe got this guys we've had\nreally low points and really incredible\nhigh points\nthat is absolutely crucial you need\nsomebody in your life who can\nreassure you because you will have\nmoments where you want to give it all up\nhow you find that person is\npartly luck and but partly it's about\nfinding of course somebody who has\ncomplementary skills somebody who\ncan do things that you cannot do who has\ncompetencies that\nyou don't have but most importantly you\nhave to find somebody\nyou like you trust respect and can get\nalong with\nbecause ultimately the thing that\nbreaks partnerships up in every case\nprofessional partnerships is the same\nthing that breaks up romantic\nrelationships up it's\nit's differences of of outlook it's\nit's an it's an an inability to\ncommunicate\num it's an inability to work through\ntension\nthere will always be tension with\npartners but when you have a partner\nwith whom\nyou have agreed that you will be\ntransparent open\nand communicative with you will be able\nto work\nthrough that we did we did an episode\nabout 7th generation\nthe non-toxic cleaning products company\nthat was started by by two partners alan\nnewman and jeffrey hollander\nand within three years they had a\nfalling out\na very bitter falling out but they began\nas intense\nfriends fast friends but they didn't do\nthe hard work\nbefore they came to the to realize that\nthey should be partners which was\nto really interrogate what each person\nwas\nwanted out of this and why and i think\nthat was the mistake\nbut on balance i believe\nhaving a partner gives you\nmore uh creates a higher probability\nthat you will succeed yeah\ni i love that you compared a business\npartnership to a\nromantic relationship or a marriage uh i\ni think that's such a great way of\nlooking at it because in the same way as\nwe have a honeymoon period\nin our relationship so we get carried\naway with chemistry\nand not really forming a real connection\nor compatibility\nwe do the same in business like you said\nwhen you become fast friends and you\nfall for each other and\nthings seem to be going perfectly and\nthen all of a sudden\nyou're met with that moment where you\nrealize that you don't have the same\nvalues and you haven't communicated\neffectively and\nand i think what you said doing that\nmature work of\nsetting your values in the beginning\nsetting your systems and standards i\nthink\nwe all want to trust people more like we\nall want to\nlove and trust and have this open\nrelationship but actually doing that\nhard work up front seems to be\nthe long-term sustainable option and by\nthe way\nyou know it's really important\nto give yourself that time and to\ngive yourself the opportunity to decide\nthat maybe the partnership\nisn't right i mean i've been in the\nprocess of developing a partnership with\na a\nfriend well somebody who's now really a\nfriend become a friend but somebody i\nknew\nover the last year and it's regular\ncalls\nit's it's weekly conversations and also\ndeveloping the idea\nand that has been absolutely crucial\nbecause you will be\ntested there will be so many moments on\nthat journey where you will be tested\nand and you're you're going to need to\nknow that the person with you\nis a person of integrity and a person\nwho\nis in this with you in the trenches with\nyou\nand it's as they say there's an element\nof luck there too\nbut you can also control that control\nfor that\nby really taking the time to interrogate\nthat relationship\nand to understand that this is the right\nperson\nyeah absolutely absolutely this is so\nhelpful guy i'm enjoying this\nconversation so much so far we've got so\nmany more questions i want to ask you\nbut i did want to take a quick pause\nbecause i i just want to let you know\nthat your ability to share these stories\nof people you've\ninterviewed with your ability to share\nyour own experiences\nis just it's magical it honestly is and\ni know that you've had a lot on this\nweek and last week with your summits and\nthe live event and\nbut you're just so present right now\nright here with these stories and i want\nto thank you for that and uh\ni applaud you for being able to share\nthese stories in such a practical way\nthat everyone who's listening and\nwatching right now\ni hope you're all taking notes by the\nway because i'm taking mental notes\nand i honestly believe that you've given\nus the\npathway to building a business in a book\nwhich is which is actually really really\ndifficult to do so\none of the things that i think you shed\na lot of light on\nand i'm sure a lot of your guests have\nalso spoken about is that there seems to\nbe a lot of\nmysticism around fundraising right\nthere's a lot of mysticism about how\nmuch money you need to actually get\nstarted and then when you need a certain\namount of money i remember being one of\nthose people\nwho would sit and dream with my friends\nin london and we'd be like oh but you\nneed like a million dollars to do that\nor you need like five million dollars to\ndo that\nand then you always postpone it in your\nhead and it's always like\neveryone's always like when you see a\napp idea launching like oh i had that\nidea like seven years ago\nlike oh they're just you know there's a\nbig difference between\nthe idea of a company actually\nfundraising how much you need\ncan you what are some of the myths\naround fundraising that you think we\nhave\nin society today and what did you\nactually learn from speaking to the\npeople that actually did it\neffectively i mean i think the biggest\nmyth is that you need it\nright and and by the way sometimes you\ndo but i think there's an assumption\nthat you have to\ngo out and find money now because that\nhas been the path for\nseveral of these billion dollar unicorns\nthe reality is building a business\nis not about building a billion dollar\nunicorn\nbuilding a business is about building\nsomething that\nis sustainable and gives you fulfillment\nand might actually\nprovide employment for other people i\nmean look at your own\nyour own life you didn't have any money\nto make videos but you had a friend who\nshot weddings and he said i i'll help\nyou out\nand he he happened to be really good and\nat four\ntwo in the morning four five in the\nmorning six in the morning you went\naround in london and you got these great\nshots because\nnobody was out there and you didn't get\npermits to do it because you were just\nin and out quickly filming and you built\nthat up slowly\nand then you got to a point with such a\nhuge audience you'll mass such a huge\naudience\nthat you could then muster the resources\nin the capital\nto deploy for better larger scale\nproductions\nand so you built it up like a pyramid\nand that actually is a very simple way\nof thinking about any business\nright it starts here and then you kind\nof progressively move up\nnow there are some businesses that are\npretty much impossible to do that way i\ndon't think you could build tesla\nwithout going to investors but but the\nreality is that\nyou know elon musk when he started out\nbuilding x.com which was his payment\ncompany\nhe didn't have funding he had to start\non his own\nfor several months and then eventually\nhad to find\npeople who were willing to give him you\nknow a thousand bucks here a thousand\nbucks there now\nhere's the thing most people don't have\naccess to\nsandhill road uh venture capitalists\nthey can't just walk into sequoia\ncapital and say hey here's my idea and i\nwant a million dollars\nthe vast majority of people don't have\nthose networks by the way the vast\nmajority of people don't just have\na rich uncle or rich parent who can\nwrite them a 10 000\ncheck so the idea that\nyou know capital is accessible to to\neveryone is just not true\nbut i do believe that virtually all of\nus do\nif we need to to amass some capital do\nhave access to\nto some of it and ways to get it so one\nof the things i talk about in the book\nis\nthe concentric circles that we all\ninhabit you know\nwe are at the center of our own circle\nright our we're we're\nwe're we're sort of ego maniacal selfish\ncreatures\nthat's not really fair to say but we we\nall have our own\nwe're all living our own movie right\nthat's our consciousness it's\nit's our own movie but and we're at the\ncenter of our own\nworld but around us there are these\ncircles of of\nclose and loose ties so imagine\nyou want to start a business and you\nstart to talk to\nyour friends and you start to tell them\nthe idea\nand one friend might say you know my\nboss actually\nmight be interested in hearing this or\nanother friend says somebody i go to\nyou know i i'm in a bowling league with\nor whatever it might be\nthe way to kind of build that those\ncircles is by\nreally you know\ntesting your idea out on people talking\nwith people\nand trying to get feedback from people\nand asking people do you know anybody\nis there anybody you think i should meet\nwith one of the best ways\nthat founders that i've interviewed have\nraised money is by going to a meeting\nwith somebody\nand not going with the intention of\ngetting money from them even though\nin many cases they would love that\noutcome but saying to them who should i\ntalk to\nwho should i go see can you can you give\nme three or four names\nand you you very quickly build this\nnetwork of people that you have a\nconnection to and a tie to\nand that is really how many founders who\ndon't have access to venture capital or\nyou know big money is how they start to\nbuild\nthe funding to to create their their\nbusinesses and so\num it's it's a very it's a it's very\npossible it's just\nrequires a commitment and work and time\nand and a willingness to\nput yourself out there i love that\nquestion though because it puts yourself\nout there without having to put yourself\nout there so when you ask some of the\nquestion of saying\nhey do you know anyone that i should\nspeak to about raising funds for this or\nintroducing for this kind of\nmanufacturer or product designer\nyou give that person the opportunity to\nsay oh i want to be involved let me know\nand if they don't that's fine they\nintroduce you to their friends or their\nnetwork and so\ni feel like it's such a healthy way of\nbeing able to ask for help and put\nyourself out there without actually\nfeeling that kind of\nawkwardness or weakness or feeling like\nyou don't have it figured out\nyou have a great knack of asking good\nquestions\nuh you've you've developed the art of\nasking fantastic questions\nwhat has been your favorite question to\nask people\nthat has given you the answer that was\nmost fascinating the reason i asked this\nis a few years ago i used to say to\npeople i was like if you see someone you\nadmire\ngo up to them and don't ask them for a\npicture ask them for a question\nask them a question because that picture\nwill\nlast a moment uh but the question will\ngive you a story to tell\nforever and what question do you think\npeople should ask people that they\nadmire and people that they respect\ni think it's more about a tone rather\nthan a question and i'll give you\ntwo answers to this because i i will\ngive you a question i love it\ni think it's more about listening to\nsomebody i i actually get much more\ninformation\nby just being an active listener to what\nsomebody is saying\nand there's a wonderful book actually\ncame out it came out about\n30 years ago it's called um how to talk\nto your kids so they'll listen to you\nsomething like that i can't remember the\nname of the book and it's basically\ndesigned it's a parenting guide\nand it basically says when your kid\ncomes to you and says i'm\nso mad you know at school today johnny\nwas so mean to me you shouldn't say well\nyou know don't worry about johnny go\nfind another friend like that's the\ninstinct that a parent has\nthis book said no parents you got it all\nwrong when your kid comes to you and\nsays\njohnny made me so mad today i'm so angry\njust listen and say oh\ni'm sorry to hear that don't give advice\njust listen\nand what you find is that your kid will\ngive you more and more information\nthat principle applies to adults too if\nyou\nif if you are talking to me and you are\ntelling me your story jay\nand i'm with you on that journey\nand i am not just with you but i'm\ni'm i'm expressing empathy i'm i'm\nlike i feel you i'm really like god that\nmust have been so hard that sometimes\nthat's my\nresponse to somebody i don't say and\nthen what happened i'll say\nand it's not a strategic thing i'm not\nyeah yeah\ni'm not like doing this in a calculated\nway it's just\ni'm just saying that must have been so\nhard\ni i can't imagine how hard that was and\nthat person says\nand then they go on and they continue to\ntell you to tell you their story so\na big part of it is active listening but\nif you have one shot\nyou find somebody you admire and you\njust you've got\none question for them i think you can\nalways ask a person\nwhat is something if you could go back\nin time to\nto the younger version of you what would\nyou tell yourself now\nwhat would you say you will almost\nalways get an interesting answer from\nsomebody\nyeah that's beautiful i love that and i\ni'm so glad you raised the point about\ntone\nand listening because\nit's it's so refreshing to hear that as\nwell because\nyou also get a different uh you can ask\nthe same question with a different tone\nyeah and get a completely different\nanswer and you can almost feel it when\nit's a technique\nversus when it's a true\nseeking of of a individual's like heart\nand\nmind and like you can tell when they're\nobsessed with that question\nversus when they think it's a good\nquestion to ask\nand and i think that applies to the\nlistener the the receiver who's going to\nanswer the question\nas well uh tell me about when you\nare putting this book together and\nyou're obviously\ntrying to compile like i mean i don't\nknow how many interviews you've done now\nhow many is it do you have a number do\nyou know\nwe've done for how i built this total um\nabout 400 in-depth interviews with\nfounders entrepreneurs incredible okay\nso 400 interviews you're trying to\ncompile it\nuh what what do you think has been the\ncraziest\nmost outlandish story or pain that you\ncame across\nin these 400 interviews that has like\nstayed with you so strongly\nthat you just think this is you know\nthis is almost like a movie like i can't\nbelieve this was someone's actual life\ni try and think of every episode in a\ncinematic way i really do because i'm\ntrying to unfold that story\nand create a visual experience for\npeople i want people to go\nto just completely get lost in the story\ni think of what i think of how what i do\nis\nand by the way um you're right i mean\ntone and listening is such an important\npart of it because\nhow you talk to somebody\nhow you ask questions it's not what you\nask\nit's how you ask it right that's not how\nyou elicit information it's not the\nactual words you use to ask a question\nbecause if it was so simple you could\njust give people a list of questions\nsometimes questions are very effective\nbut it's how you ask them\ni think that for me i'm always looking\nto\nto help somebody tell their story in a\nway that you could imagine as a movie\nyou could imagine in a\nbecause story our human stories are\nmovies\nwe every single one of us is a movie\nmany people think i'm not that\ninteresting or my life isn't that\ndramatic and\nand and what they don't realize is that\nit is\nin my job is to show you that is to\nknow so much about you ahead of time\nthat i can\npull that out of you because i know that\ni can see that\nthat's the advantage we have as\noutsiders we can see other people\nin ways they can't see themselves and it\ngives all of us\na superpower i think you know a story\nthat sticks into my mind\nis a recent one we did about a company\ncalled the mcbride sisters collection\nit's the largest black owned wine\nbusiness in the united states and one\none of the largest in the world and it\nwas started by two sisters\nrobin and andrea mcbride they both\nshared the same father he was\nafrican-american\nand they had both had different mothers\nneither of these women knew the other\nexisted until they were in their 20s\ntheir father died and they were informed\nby relatives\nthat they the other one each sister was\ninformed that they had a sister\nandrea was raised in new zealand her\nmother was kiwi\nshe had met andrea's father in los\nangeles and then\nemigrated to new zealand robin's mother\nwas from monterey california\nand raised also a white woman raised her\ndaughter in monterey california and\nthese two women did not know the\nexistence of the other until they were\nin their 20s\nand the story of their reunion is so\nemotional it's so powerful\num we were all crying when we were\nrecording the interview\nbecause it's\nalmost impossible to believe that it's\ntrue that it happened that they\nthrough just a random miracle not only\ndid they\ncome together not only did they love\neach other from the moment they saw each\nother\nbut they both grew up in wine growing\nparts of the world\nmonterey california and new zealand and\nthey both had this incredible passion\nfor wine\nand they both decided that they were\nnever going to be apart again\nand andrea moved to the united states to\nto be with her sister\nand they went on to to create this\nbusiness they started it 15 16 years ago\nvery small with no money with no\nconnections\nin a world dominated by mainly by white\nmen\nand they created this incredible\nbusiness you can find mcbride sisters\nwine\nin virtually every grocery store every\nwalmart you know\naround the united states today and\nhow they got there is it's an epic it's\na hero's journey it's\nit's as good as any movie you've ever\nseen and it's all true\nthat's incredible i need to go back and\nlisten to that uh i've not\ni've not not heard that one so\ndefinitely excited to dive back into it\ni hope everyone who's listening will go\noff and listen to that episode as well\nit sounds absolutely\nphenomenal on how i built this uh guy i\nwanna\ncoming towards the end of our\nconversation here i wanna talk a bit\nabout\nhow this book and your work massively\nhelps people who don't wanna be\nentrepreneurs\nbecause i think that all the lessons\nyou've shared today all the lessons in\nthe book\nare applicable to each and every person\nwhether they're an intrapreneur inside\ntheir organization or\nwhether they work at their parents\nbusiness or whether they\nuh are just just working a a regular job\nand going out there and doing it i think\nthe what you're sharing and the things\nthat me and you care about\nare things that are applicable and\nuseful to anyone and everyone\nin a skill set and often the\nentrepreneurship journey\nhas today been made very sexy and like\nattractive and and it's almost like\neveryone feels the pressure that they\nhave to be an entrepreneur i remember\nwith one of my mentors who i absolutely\nlove\nand i had him he was a mentor for me\nwhen i was at accenture\nand he was he would always tell me he'd\nbe like jay you're an entrepreneur\nand i'd be like no i'm not i'm just like\ni was like i'm not an entrepreneur i'm\nlike\ni like working for people i just want to\nmake videos i just want to make content\nlike i'm\ni'm more of a reporter journalist kind\nof person i don't want to and he was\nlike no no you're an entrepreneur and he\nkeeps saying it\nlike go home and be like this guy just\ndoesn't understand me and and now i'm\nlike oh you were right you were right\nuh but if someone's sitting here\nlistening and they're like oh\nguy and jay i don't don't really want to\nbe an entrepreneur i don't think i have\nit in me it sounds too\nscary yeah what what can they take away\nfrom these conversations your podcast in\nthis book because i think there's so\nmuch for them to take away\nand i don't want people to miss out just\nbecause they don't want to be an\nentrepreneur\nyeah so probably only about 15 or 20\npercent of our audience\nare actually traditional entrepreneurs\npeople of a brick and mortar store or\nonline store who have hung a shingle\noutside and are\nare running a business the vast majority\nof people\nwho listen to how i built this are\nmay not think of themselves as\ntraditional entrepreneurs but they are\nthe reality is that entrepreneurial\nthinking\nhappens all of the time it happens\nevery single day of our lives if you are\na parent with kids\num trying to think of creative ways to\nmanage your\nhousehold if you are a single person\nthinking entrepreneurially about how to\nfill your time\none of the most innovative products in\nin modern human history\nis the iphone that was invented by\njohnny ive\ninside of apple would you not say that\nwas entrepreneurial\nthat whole product was developed by\npeople within apple who wanted to\nconnect people through a handheld device\nthere was no\ndictator mandate from above that said\nlet's do this now it was\nit was part of a process that developed\nand\ncreated these amazing products\nentrepreneurial entrepreneurialism is a\nmindset\nit's not about hanging a shingle outside\nof your door it's about thinking\ncreatively it's about thinking\ncollaboratively it's about\ntrying to to do different and new things\nand improve ways of working within your\nown team it might be\ncoming up with a whole new system for\nhow you\nhold each other accountable it might be\na small nudge or twist or\nchange in how you approach\nyour own role it or how your\nteam is organized it's the same thing as\nleadership\nyou know leadership is can be a title\nbut having a title alone doesn't make\nyou a leader\nwhat makes you a leader is when you\nshare your experience with others you\nknow we do this on our teams\nespecially on how i built this it's a\nsmall team of producers\nbut from the very beginning and we we\nreally work to promote people from\nwithin\nfrom from our interns eventually become\nproducers\nand we have a system where we encourage\nthe the sort of the lowest level person\nfrom a title perspective\nwe encourage that person to take a\nleadership role so we have an intern\nthe intern gets guidance from the\nprevious intern who's now a producer\nand other producers who may have been\ninterns two or three years earlier\nbut who are now leaders we now have a\nformer intern\nwho is mentoring a current intern that's\na leadership position that is a leader\nonce you start to behave as a mentor to\nother people and you don't have to be\nmuch older than them you might be a year\nor two ahead of them\nyou are a leader you are an innovator\nand you are an entrepreneur\nthat is what it's about it's a way of\nthinking and\noperating it's not about selling a\nproduct inventing a product and\nhanging a shingle it's a mindset and\neverybody has the potential to\nadopt that mindset i love that guy thank\nyou so much for\nuh sharing that so clearly uh both\nthrough this interview and in the book\nand in all of your podcast episodes\nuh we end every episode of on purpose\nwith a final five a fast five\nuh so these answers have to be in one\nword or one sentence\nmaximum i break my own rules all the\ntime so be ready for me\ndeviating but guy if you're ready uh\nwe'll get going\nokay all right so question one is\nwhat is the best piece of advice you've\never received\nit's hard to give one answer but it's a\nvariation
