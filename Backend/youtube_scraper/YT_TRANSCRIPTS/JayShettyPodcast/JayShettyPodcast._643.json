    "transcript": "what happened to me in my life is\nstatistically impossible\nso someone upstairs was looking out yet\ni wasn't showing that respect of saying\ni trust that you love me i trust that\neverything's gonna be okay\ngiving that trust to the universe i've\nseen amazing miraculous things start to\nhappen in my life\n[Music]\nyou and your wife have the most amazing\neyes\nso having to stare directly at you and\ndo this podcast i feel like i'm slowly\nfalling in love\nso there you go so now we now we can do\nthis because i have to stare into those\npools so this is why you don't look at\nme\nthis is why i was like it's like scooter\ndoesn't give me icons yeah it's funny\nprince is right there because there's\nthat famous joke of like never look\nprince in the eyes you'll fall in love\nthis is what you learned at the j-shad\npodcast i love it man you look different\nsince the last time i saw you\nyeah shaved shaved and you look well\nthough you look great man thanks man\nand and i wanna i wanted to tell people\nbecause i i think when people see\npeople connecting they don't realize\nsometimes how organically people meet\nand i want to share that story if that's\nokay and you can you can fill in the\ndetails let's do it\nbut it was a couple of years ago we were\nat our mutual friend justin baldoni's\nmovie\npremiere yeah he had the movie coming\nout five feet apart\nand i went to the movie premiere i was\nrunning late i didn't think i was going\nto make it\ni was like oh gosh i don't want to let\njustin down i really want to be there\nfor him\nand then i'm walking in and then i see\nyou walking in\nand i knew who you were based on all the\nincredible work you've been doing\nfor two decades now or more\nand and i and i knew you i i didn't know\nthat\ni was a fan of what you were putting out\nthere and i was in the positivity\nso when i saw you i got just just as\nexcited\nso i got excited and i was in this space\nwhere i was like i have to go and tell\nhim because\nif someone's impacted your life or you\nlove the artists they work with\nthe work that they do today we're going\nto discuss all the philanthropy work\nyou're doing\nwhen you're into someone i feel like\nit's so important to not go and ask for\na picture\nbut to go and express how you feel about\nthem and so i came up to you and i was\nlike scooter i'm a big fan of all the\nwork you're doing congratulations\nand then when you said it back to me and\nand i remember the words you said they\nwere so powerful and it just showed me\nhow\npresent you were and and i think maybe\nyou know people don't know this about\nyou but it's not everyone gets to bump\ninto you\nbut you were like i said the work you're\ndoing is really important thank you for\ndoing it and you you said\nyou're doing the most important work and\nyou i meant it\nyeah and it was it really touched my\nheart i was so you know\ni was so humbled and honored to hear\nthat from you and then we we were like\nwell let's get together and i think you\nkind of looked at me when i said it\nas like okay yeah you're not really\ngoing to get together\ndefinitely and we ended up going for\nlunch or\nyou know yeah our wives met and\num we became friends\nyou know and then uh you joined us on a\ntrip and\nyou know it's uh i just i'm so happy to\nsee your message getting louder and\nlouder and bigger and bigger because i\nthink\nyou're giving people a lot of the things\nthey need to hear and a lot of\npositivity\nand allowing them to slow down and take\na breath yeah thank you man and i've\nalways felt that support from you and\nwe've had some amazing trips and\nsome good walks and some good walks as\nwell some really important\nwalks and meaningful times in my life\nand uh\nyou've always been so helpful mentoring\nsupportive as well and so\nthank you but today i think you know the\nfascinating thing for me is\nthat you have these incredible artists\nthat you founded you then have the man\nbehind\nthe people the work the person but then\neven far removed from that you have the\nwork that the man is doing\nbehind the scenes and so it's almost\nlike you're twice removed\nthe real you the the behind the scenes\nversion of you\nis almost so distant from what people\nexperience\non the front lines that's what i want to\ndiscover today and share today\nbecause that's what i feel i got a\nglimpse of uh yeah i think you did and\num i think it's so funny that we're\ndoing this because we talked about doing\nthis pre-covet\nyeah and then covet hit and a lot of\nthings happen a lot of things changed\num and you know for me covid was an\nopportunity\nto slow down and do some real\nself-reflection\nand self-work which i think we all\nshould be doing at all times you know i\nreally came to terms with the fact that\nas long as i'm breathing i'm a student\nand it's funny that you start there\nbecause obviously\nmy nickname is scooter and my\nmy given name was scott and i can tell\nyou\ni don't remember ever liking the name\nscott\nuntil now you know i i didn't realize\nuntil i've\ndid the work i've done really over the\nlast six months um\nthat i kind of left scott behind in a\nway\nand built something that i thought was\npowerful enough to be in the world\nsomething that i thought deserved to be\nloved by the world and\ni didn't realize subconsciously how much\ni had\nleft that inner child behind\nand my friends didn't realize it and i\nwas having fun everything else but i was\nalways\nkind of trying to build something new\nbecause of\nyou know you and i spoke about this um\none of the quotes that i loved someone\nsaid uh\nmany times we don't know our trauma\nbecause it was never ours\nand you know my grandparents are\nholocaust survivors and\nmy parents went through what they went\nthrough and i feel like i kind of\ninherited some of that\nwhere i always felt like when is it\ngonna get taken away\nwhen are they gonna show up and take it\naway from me so i was always building\nfor something else\num to protect me and my family not\nrealizing that\neverything that i ever needed was right\nhere in the present\nand uh doing this work i went back and\ngot scott\nand i think you saw a glimpse of that\ncertain friends of mine saw a glimpse of\nthat\nand i feel like coming out of cove and\ni'm putting that more on the forefront\nyeah i love hearing that yeah i started\nthere just because i think it's\nit's the root of today's conversation\nyou know us sitting down here today is\nhis two friends wanting to go deep in a\nconversation we would have offline but\nonline\nand hearing you say that is so freeing\ni'm sure for everyone who's listening\nand watching for themselves too\nbecause i think all of us are holding on\nto a trauma that's not ours or\nor something that we experienced let's\nlet's focus on that let's go back then\nto\nwhat were you like as a kid because i'm\nintrigued to know i didn't know you then\nwhat were you like\nlike were you always confident was there\nan insecurity what is it that you were\nworking through as a kid or at least in\nhindsight\nyou know look i out of respect for\npeople that i love there's certain\nthings i'm not\nnot gonna go into only because i realize\nnow\nthat we all see the world through our\nlens\nand when you really start to do the work\nyou realize that things that happened to\nyou\na lot of times were happening to you\nbecause it's all that people knew\nyou know and that it's not about\nresenting anyone or being angry it's\nactually about\nloving more and then changing the\npattern\nyou know because you're choosing that\nfor yourself um\nso what i can tell you is i was a very\nsensitive loving kid\nand loved everybody\nloved having fun loved shining my light\nout there but was super sensitive\nand i think as i grew up i was you know\ni was raised for a tough world\nand i was raised by very loving people\nbut there was a lot of trauma\nyou know that you know like i said the\nholocaust like things happened um\nand when people go through that they're\ntrying to protect their next generation\nthey're trying to protect their loved\nones\nso they're giving them that what you\nneed to look out for\nand i'm grateful for that many ways\nbecause there's great things that come\nwith that but also as a child\nyou don't really have that rational\nthought until you're like six or eight\nyears old\nso you're interpreting things the way\nyou are you don't realize you're setting\nthese patterns\num and i'm not embarrassed to say this\nyou know one of the things i did during\ncovet\nin fact i'm not the opposite of\nembarrassed i'm grateful to these people\ni\ni uh i had canceled four times on\nsomething called the hoffman process\nand i finally went in october um because\nyou know friends were pushing me and\nsaying this is gonna be great for you\nand i was like what do i need this for\nlike i\nand i finally went and it was the\ngreatest gift i ever gave myself\nand it was the first time in 20 years\nthat i went no phone\nno email no tv i was completely\ningrained in this process\nand funny enough which is why you and i\nhaven't connected when i got out\neveryone was like okay he's gonna turn\nhis phone back on and i actually\ngot a burner phone and didn't turn my\nactual phone back on until the end of\nthe year\nwow until 2021 really and i\nyou know my team stepped up for me i was\nkind of going through a couple different\npeople and\nyou know giving the suggestions and\nhelping and um\nthe artists that i work with were\nincredibly respectful of it and\nappreciative\nbecause you know i've been there for\nthem and i remember\nthem looking at me like now it's time\nfor us to be here for you and let you go\nthrough\nyou know your learning and whatever and\num\nand i've really had a shift in my life\nand uh\ni couldn't be more grateful because you\ngo through and things are going good\nyou're seeing other people in their\ntrauma you're seeing other people with\nwhatever they're going through and you\ndon't want to look at yourself because\nyou're like well my life's so good i\ni have nothing to complain about i don't\ni don't need to do this work because\nwho am i to even say i need help\nyou know when people are really going\nthrough problems i should just focus on\nthe good things in my life\nand what i realized is we all deserve\nthe right to slow down\nand say why am i hurting what am i going\nthrough what work can i do\nand um i'm grateful that a lot of people\nthat love me push me to do that\nthat's amazing i'm so when you told me\nyou did that recently when we were\ntalking\ni was so happy and the other\nconversation we had that was attached to\nthat\nit actually brought me so much joy\nbecause i feel like when someone in your\nlife that you care for\nactually invests in themselves and now\nis saying\nno to certain opportunities or delaying\nevents in their life or priorities in\ntheir life like huge priorities i mean\nyour artists have\nhuge like not huge is not astronomical\ncareers with\nconstant releases with constant work and\nthe fact that\nyou took that time they're getting to\nsee what you're prioritizing\nand what i find so special about that is\nyou had to it's amazing to think about\nthis but you had to feel you were worthy\nof that time that you had to feel like\nyou deserved it\nand that you couldn't just neglect it\nbecause yes you do have a blessed\nfortunate life which you're grateful for\nvery tell us about that feeling of\nfeeling worthy because i feel like\nthat's such a\nfeeling like you're enough to be honest\nwith you i think um you know one of the\nthings i learned there is these we have\nthese core shame lies\nyou know that we tell ourselves that\naffect us and create our fear and create\nour transference with other people and\nit's not the root of things i mean i got\na new tattoo actually when i got out it\nsays love more on my chest\nbecause that's the number one lesson i\nlearned that's how you need to respond\nto really most things\nyeah and i'm working on that every\nsingle day with everything whenever i\nfeel resistance i realize oh my god this\nisn't there's a lesson for me here\num one of the things i had to realize is\nthat i'm i'm good enough because there's\nthis weird thing that like\nyou kind of go through life wondering\nare you good enough and all these things\nare happening for you and you're\nwondering do i really deserve this am i\ngood enough\nthe other thing i realized was none of\nus\ntruly love ourselves unconditionally and\nthen how we supposed to love other\npeople unconditionally\nto me the way god loves us is\nunconditional and one of the things i\nreally had to go through and\nto you know what i'm reminding myself\nevery day in my daily meditations now\nis that one you're good enough two\nyou're lovable\ntwo everyone else deserves love and then\nthe biggest thing i'm i'm\nrealizing is that i need to trust you\nknow\ntrust in the unknown because\nyou go out there and you i gotta make\nthis happen you know i'm gonna sleep\nwhen i'm dead like all these different\nthings\nand the truth is what happened to me in\nmy life is statistically impossible\nso someone upstairs was looking out\nand they've given me a life with every\nsingle sign\nthat god loves me and is looking out for\nme yet i wasn't showing that respect of\nsaying\ni trust that you love me i trust that\neverything's gonna be okay\nand giving that trust to the universe\ni've seen amazing miraculous things\nstart to happen in my life\nand i i can tell you it's almost like\ni'm prospering better than ever before\nbecause of that and the challenges have\nbeen getting harder and harder and\ncontinuing\nbut it's almost like these tools now are\nallowing me for the waves to hit me and\ni'm swimming through them\nand i'm understanding with everything\nthere's something else to be learned\nyeah see when i'm hearing you say it you\ncan tell that it's been so\nrealized because a lot of these things\nwe hear them in daily talk like oh yeah\nyou should learn from everything in life\nand\nevery every challenge has a lesson an\nopportunity but\nwhen you hear someone say it and they're\nliving it it just\nit sounds different and it's different\nand the biggest thing you said which\nreally resonated with me\njust now is the idea of the love more\nthe tattoo you got\ni've read this incredible statement from\na writer called russell barkley he's no\nlonger with us but the statement he said\nlike literally this is like\nit's changed how i view every situation\nand it\nand it correlates so similarly to the\nexperience you had so russell barkley\nsaid\npeople who need the most love often\nask for it in the most unloving ways\nand literally every day when i'm living\nmy life i\nsee people ask me for love sometimes in\nthe most\nunloving ways and i think we've all\nexperienced that\nbig time where someone's criticizing you\nbut really they just want love where\nsomeone's\ntrying to get something from you or\nreaching out to you but they want love\nlike everyone's ultimately seeking love\nbut they are seeking it through\nvalidation or attention or\nand i think we learned that as a kid i\nmean i i\ni told my dad you know recently that\nyou loved me so unconditionally that i\nsee through the lies of fear\nyou know because how you know we we're\ngiving our kids\nin a weird way sometimes transactional\nlove because we're trying to teach them\nlessons and then you go through life and\ni never thought i was a transactional\nperson because i'm not like that with\nmoney\nyeah but i realized i was like that\nweirdly with love\nyou know and and i was like that with\nrespect\noh i'm not gonna you know you gotta\nrespect me or respect is earned\nwell actually i can give respect without\nreceiving it yes you know i can give\nlove without receiving it\nyou know i can do that for my own self\ni'm just going to respond with kindness\nbecause that's what i'm working on and\nby the way it doesn't always work\nlike there are mornings you wake up and\nyou're frustrated we're human and i\nthink\na beautiful thing my teacher said to me\nrecently he said\nwhy are you giving yourself these\nunrealistic expectations\nand it was so beautiful what he said it\nwas he said if if you say to yourself\ni'm gonna work out every single day this\nmonth\nand then you miss one workout you know\nwhat you normally do you end up missing\nthree or four\nbecause you're kind of ashamed that you\nmissed that once you kind of fall off\nthe wagon\nthe truth is stop giving yourself this\ncrazy expectation give yourself some\nself-compassion\nwe're not perfect we're flawed so if i\nmiss that workout you know what\nthat's okay i'll get back on it tomorrow\nyou know and\nthe same thing goes with anger with\nfrustration you're allowed to fall and\nstumble\nand then realize it can get back on and\nthat's the biggest thing i'm working on\nbecause\ni'm a perfectionist i want to you know i\nwant to get this learning right\nbut it doesn't it doesn't end here you\nknow if it ends i die\nyeah yeah you know and then i could\nprobably come back and learn again yeah\num which is by the way anyone wants to\nunderstand you and i have talked about\nthis many lives many masters by brian\nweiss is a very good book to read to\nkind of just give yourself\nan idea of why thinking about\nreincarnation is such a beautiful way to\nlook at life\nyes um really but yeah it's\nthese are the things you and i talk\nabout i don't know i started going no\ni'm just saying it's\npeople like get on the podcast and\nthey're like we're gonna talk career and\neverything else and i said i want to do\njays because we're probably not going to\ntalk any career\nyeah yeah and well for me it's just this\ncoming from hashtag no days off\nso when i met you it was hashtag no days\noff and\ni'm going down and i'm personal but we\nworked out together\ni have never thrown up that bad in my\nlife if you remember yeah i was a little\nout of control with the expectations of\nworking out i was like\ni was like are you okay we worked out\ntogether we did this crazy circuit\nand i don't like high intensity for\nanyone who's listening or watching\nand literally we did this workout and\nyou know i mean you could tell scooter's\ngot a completely different body to mine\ni'm doing this i'm not i'm not like i\nwas back then but i will say this is\nmore competitive\nyeah because you would not tell me you\nweren't okay yeah and i just said jay\nyou look a little no i'm good i'm good\nlet's keep going\nand there were three of us and you\ndidn't want to be the one person falling\nout and then finally\nexcuse me um finally\nyou literally sat down on the ground and\nyou're like\ni'm not okay\nand you just you say i'm gonna go to the\nbathroom and you disappeared for a good\n45 hours yeah literally i was i was\npuking like anything but it was just\nyeah it was\nyeah i've always had that spirit of\nwanting to see how far i can go\nand when i did that as a monk there were\nexperiences that broke me\nbecause we were doing crazy fasts crazy\nmeditations and\nall it brought me back to was the\nrealization that i wasn't superman\nyeah and and i think that that's what\ni'm hearing from what i'm hearing you\nsay too is the idea\nof like no matter how able you are and\nhow capable you are and\nthe boundaries that you push we all\nstill have\nand you're going to fall again correct\ni'm having this learning and having\nthis epiphany i'm gonna break again yeah\nyou know and and this time i have tools\nto put my hand on my chest and say\nwe all suffer the world is filled with\nsuffering give yourself some self\ncompassion yeah\nyou know and and give it to others and\num\nit's it's been a beautiful thing and i i\ncredit\nsome amazing people in my life who\nreally pushed me\nto go there um and\nyou know when you go there there's also\nsadness you know realizing\nhow many things you missed because you\nwere planning for something in the\nfuture\nhow many times you weren't present\nbecause you thought you had to protect\nsomething\nthat you already had you know and\ni i'm just grateful i'm not going to\nspend another 39 years\nnot knowing these things yeah and i look\nforward to\nevery five years telling you another\nlevel of learning\nyeah yeah um it has to be that way you\nknow and i and i\nweirdly like the falls\nare where the greatest learnings are a\nthousand percent\nthousand percent and that's and that's\nthe problem right what you just said\nabout missing a day over workout and\nthen it ends up missing four days it's\nthe same when we go\nokay well now i'm not gonna fall because\ni found a new place of enlightenment\nand what we don't realize is again like\nyou said it may not be every five days\nbut every three or four years there's\ngoing to be another moment\nof revelation and when you keep thinking\noh no no this time i've got it\nthat's that's where the mistake is made\nis like oh this time it's not going to\nhappen but\ntell me about what does it take because\ni remember you discussing the hoffman\nproject with me\nuh when we first met and you were like\noh i think you're going to this etc\ni want to know a bit more about the\nprocess of huffman so that everyone can\nbe exposed to and understand a bit more\nas much as they can but also like what\ndoes it take\nfor someone like you to go in that\ndirection like what does it take\nwhat happened what's going on in order\nto urge you and encouraging you\nit's not as significant yeah yeah it's\nnot no\nit wasn't like you know it was funny\nwhen i went i started\nmy wife and i started hearing all kinds\nof rumors of he's gone crazy and they\nsaid like because i was away and\nyou know all kinds of weird things but\nit wasn't that it was just\nfeeling like i wasn't present in my life\nyeah and feeling like the people around\nme who love me\ni felt they're hurt because\none we're all coming in with our own\ntrauma and weirdly our trauma was\nmatching up\nand i couldn't fix it\ni'm a fixer you know i'm the guy who\nsince i was a kid\ni'm going to make it be okay for\neverybody and\nthere was this j i just couldn't fix\nthings in this moment\nin time and suddenly\nbecause i couldn't fix things i started\nto spiral\ni i started to literally lean more into\nmy negative patterns\nbecause of wanting to control things\nbecause i couldn't fix things\nand my heart was in the best place i\nwanted everything to be okay and\neveryone would be happy\nbut i couldn't get everything in the\nright place and i'd been playing that\nchess game for so long\nand the board was getting away from me\nand\nsuddenly i realized a very dark thought\ncame into my head\nthe ultimate i'm not enough the ultimate\ni shouldn't be here\nand that's not me yeah and when that\nthought entered my mind\ni said what are you doing here i was\nlike whoa that\ni've never gone that dark yeah and\ni signed up for the hoffman process the\nnext day why hoffman tell us a bit about\nit for anyone who doesn't know because\ni i think i love giving credit where\nit's due to\nplaces and started started by a guy\nnamed bob hoffman in the united states\nthere's one in the napa area and there's\none in connecticut\num amazing woman named liza was the one\nwho\nis one of the co-ceos with her husband\nand it's a non-profit\nit's just amazing process that really\ndelves into spirituality delves into\nearly childhood\ndelves into your trauma your patterns um\nand you give yourself over for basically\nseven days no phone no\nno phone no email no even to your kids\nno working out no book\nno nothing and writing there's a lot of\nwriting what i will say to you is\ni don't want to go into what processes\nbecause it's important whoever does it\ndoes that is surprised but what was\ninteresting is i started\ni had certain people you know what you\nneed you need to go to hoffman and i had\ncanceled four times and\nit was always a reason i'm not gonna go\nto this i don't need this like i'm busy\nand one of my friends who's one of the\nmost brilliant friends i have\num he said to me when i went in\ni went in to manipulate it so i can come\nout and show the people i love look i\ndid this aren't you proud of me because\nsomeone\nthat you know he loved it done it and he\nlooked at me and he said you can't\nmanipulate this\nand i was fascinated that he said that\nbecause he's such a smart guy and i'm\nlike what could they\nreally do in a week and he said it's\ngoing to be the most remarkable\nexperience of your life\nand my other friend penny had said it to\nme and you know and i um\ni decided i'm gonna go and it felt like\ni was it was gone for a year almost you\nknow and i really gave myself over to\nthis process and made really amazing\nfriendships\ni wasn't like sharing you share feelings\nand you know different things and\ni opened up in a way that i never\nexpected and i laugh now because i look\nback at the timeline\nof when we did things because i had this\nworkbook and i realized that day two\ni remember having such an intimate\nconversation with my teacher and i\nthought that must have been day five\nit was day two you know and we went in\ndeep sleep yeah i went in deep and um\ni uncovered a lot of things and i\nrealized a lot of things about myself\nabout my\npatterns about forgiveness\nfor myself understanding of things\nforgiveness of others\nand and i was just eternally grateful\nit was interesting is when i came out i\nhad this\noh i'm so happy i'm so in love with life\nand myself in the world and people\nand i came back and i entered a lot of\ndarkness\num and and the tools that i got at\nhoffman\nallowed me to understand that the\ndarkness was because\nthat's what god wanted me to have that's\nwhat\nthere were lessons that i needed to\nlearn i'd now be given these tools and\nthere was no darkness\nthere was an opportunity to learn there\nwas an opportunity\nto go deeper every single day and i\nalways found that when i was doing my\nmeditations\nthe biggest revelations were my deepest\nbreaths my longest deepest breaths i'd\nhave the deepest revelations\nand i in one of my meditations i\nrealized that's life\ni've been going around taking these\nquick breaths treating my life that way\nand i wasn't slowing down enough in life\nto take a deep breath and let it come to\nme\num and and that is that just comes down\nto\nyou know self-forgiveness and yeah you\nknow and a lot of uh\na lot of beautiful things and i'm really\ngrateful to you know\nthe people i will never say who i was\nthere with because they don't do that\nand\nno one has ever said i was there this is\nactually the first time i publicly said\nthat i was there\num and it was a very cool thing i'm very\ngrateful and\nand now sharing this there's so many\nother people who come to me of like\ntheir\nthings of self work that they've done\nyeah and they're like you should try\nthis and try this and it's\nit's just a very exciting place to be\nand i can tell you the greatest gift of\nall is\nfor my children you know i i was a good\ndad\nbefore i loved my kids i would come home\nevery night and put them to sleep and\nyou know and i'm married to super mom\num she's awesome and i\nam present with my children in a way\nthat i didn't know possible before\nand i think that's the greatest thing\nhoffman gave me\nit's it's so it's so beautiful listening\nto someone have that experience like i\ncould sit here and just listen to you\nall day because\nit's it is it it's so gratifying to the\nsoul like on a much more\ndeeper spiritual level to hear someone\nhaving that experience and and doing\nthat work\nand how does that and i do want to talk\na bit about career on this\non this level of frequency because what\ni'm fascinated by and i think this is\nwhat people often don't see as\nsymbiotic is how spiritual\ninsight leads to spiritual career\npractice\nhow does how does someone like you take\nthis very profound experience and work\nand by the way\nhaving known you for a few years like i\nknow that this wasn't just seven days of\nwork this is years and years and years\nagain there's a lot of leading ups yeah\nexactly in\nseven days where the seven days like\naccelerates and yeah like really makes\nit powerful and meaningful but\nyou've been doing this for a while and\nthinking about these things for a while\nhow does that then manifest in your work\nhow do you take this energy is it how\nyou're\ndealing with people is it how you're\ncreating stuff how does someone do that\nbecause i think a lot of people even i\nget asked this question a lot\nis like they see spirituality and\nbusiness is like almost separate yeah i\ncompletely disagree yes insane\nyou know the other thing i i want to\npoint out because i've been thinking a\nlot about this is that\nthe same way i said that i believe you\nget the lessons when you're supposed to\nget them\ni believe you're supposed to i don't\nthink i should have had\nthis mentality in the beginning of my\ncareer\ni think that i'm exactly where i'm\nsupposed to be\nthe universe wants me to be exactly\nwhere i am\nso things i needed to be a certain way\nat certain points to learn those things\nfor those things to happen\nand now this is where i am at 39 and\nthis is where i needed to learn and now\nyou know i'm i'm having a different kind\nof grace i'm having a different kind of\nempathy\ni'm understanding to let go and\nallow people to have their process in\ntheir journey in a different way because\ni'm understanding my own in a different\nway\ni'm i'm not having this need to\njustify you know there's times where\ni'm i'm seeing how i'm like well\nthey're they're seeing my growth as like\noh he got there and i'm sitting there\nlike well you haven't got there either\nand i'm i'm smiling to myself because\nit's not my place to say that because it\nwasn't their place to say it to me\nyou know and i'm i'm here to you know\nit's almost funny we talk about\ndifferent religions you and i\nand i'm jewish you know i've grown up in\na christian society\nand i've gotten to a place also where\nunderstanding i don't want to live my\njudaism and fear\nyou know thousands of years of\npersecution\ngave us strength but also a lot of fear\nand telling us we can't go near\nsomething yet\nyou know moses married zipporah who\nwas not jewish and when he brought her\nto his people and he said she loves me\nand everything no one questioned that\njust years of assimilation and losing\nidentity cause us to have a tremendous\namount of fear and i don't want to live\nwith that fear anymore i want to explore\nother spiritualities\nand be true to myself and my own you\nknow i'm not afraid to hear the wisdom\nof another spirituality so\nyou know my friend he was giving a\nsermon he's christian and i listened and\ni thought it was beautiful he was saying\nin the book of matthew it's not about\nsaying it and teaching it it's about\nliving it and letting someone else see\nit and i've now seen that you know we've\ntalked about it within your religion\nand i i'm trying to get to that place of\nlike\ni don't have all the answers i'm\nfiguring it out every single day i am as\nflawed as they get\nyeah you know but i'm just gonna try to\nlive my best self\nyeah you know and you know last night i\ndid a clubhouse talk\nwith demi and um she became my client\nover the past year\nyeah and she's been through a lot we had\nthis amazing documentary coming out\nabsolutely and she and i were talking\nabout her whole career\nevery time she faltered she has the\nstrength to get back up and people call\nher a role model\nand she's like i'm just afraid because\nit's just too much perfection to live in\nand then i always crash and she started\nto do interviews for this new element\nshe's like i want to be a role model and\ni called her up and said what are you\ndoing\ni said you're giving yourself that same\nsense self\nyou know perfection that caused you to\nfall before\ni said we got to change the word and i\nthought about my brother adam\nwho has a non-profit called pencil\npromise and he told me\ni don't want to be called nonprofit i\nwant to be called for purpose i don't\nwant to say what we don't do i want to\nsay what we do\ntotally and i said to demi stop calling\nyourself a role model let's go with real\nmodel\nyou're a real person and you are flawed\nand you are imperfect and you are honest\nand you don't have to be perfect ever\nagain and we like that and that's how\nshe's saying now\nyeah and i think if we start treating\nourselves and others with this same\nsense of it's why i hate cancer culture\ni mean i understand we all have a lot of\npain\nbut if we don't give people an\nopportunity for growth what are we doing\nwe're just giving the next generation\nthe same pain\nyou know and i and it's a hard thing to\nask people\nit's a hard thing to ask when you've\nbeen abused when you've been persecuted\nwhen you've been\nmistreated to love your neighbor\nyeah you know that's a very tall order\nand and i don't\nthink it's my right to tell someone to\ndo it\nbut i can choose to start doing it in my\nown life and i can tell you it's hard\nyeah it's hard and i falter and i\nstumble sometimes\nand i i said to my wife just the other\nday i said hey\ni caught myself the other day i was\nupset with someone on how they treated\nme\nso i made a comment to you\nthat wasn't the kindest comment about\nthem you know it wasn't awful\nbut i just wasn't giving them their\ncredit because i was upset about\nsomething that happened to me\ni said if you catch me doing that can\nyou just if you notice it just tell me\nto stay in my heart\nand she was like i got you and\ni think that's what i'm trying to do i'm\ntrying to stay there yeah and that's\nthat accountability culture like you\nknow you have someone in your life that\nyou're being accountable\nto your wife in this example and like\nthat feeling of we do need\naccountability we want to be accountable\nto ourselves to\nthe people we love the people that are\nimportant and i just want to point out i\ndon't if you notice how perfect it was\nthat you said the real and role models\nthing\ntwo-pack said we need real models not\nrole models and i'm looking at him\ni'm looking at you and i'm like i'll\ntake my shirt off yeah\nshow me the more love but but it's so\nthat's such a beautiful point and and\nyou know i i want to share this because\nwe talked about this\nand i and i struggle with that so me and\nmy wife when we talk about relationships\nwe talk about our mistakes if you listen\nto our podcast she's been my guest three\ntimes\nevery year we do an episode together and\nwe talk about everything we get wrong\nand the number one comment will be\nhashtag relationship goals\nor the number one comment would be like\nhashtag cutest couple or whatever it is\nand my comment back would be please\nlisten to what i'm saying\nand so what i find is that we've been\nconditioned and programmed\nto want someone to be perfect yeah demi\nyou justin uh you know\nwhoever uh me and my wife no one is\nperfect none of us have perhaps\nyou and i talked once i said um we're\nwe're made to serve not to be worshipped\nbecause no one can live up to worship no\none apart from god\ngod that's it yeah you know worship god\nserve each other yes\ni love that that thought is is perfect\nand beautiful\nbut that's what i mean that because\nwe've been conditioned to want to\nworship\nhumans we direct that worship into an\nathlete\ninto a singer into a teacher into a\nguide whoever it is but it's a shame\nthat even when you have someone opening\nup and saying what it's actually like\nour programming up here is so strong\nthat we still project\nperfection so now the new trend is\nbefore it was\nif you were flawless or at least\npresented yourself as flawless\nthat was considered worship worthy today\nnow it's the opposite if someone's\nreally vulnerable that's worship worthy\nbut the point is what you just said is\nlet's move away from worship completely\nand let's just serve and support each\nother i want to say two things yes one\nis about you and one's about me okay\num it's good we're both in the room i'm\ngonna go with you first\njust because and then i can end on me so\nyou don't feel bad a little over a year\nago\nyou called me and you said can we go for\na walk and we went for a walk\nand i said this is the unfortunate thing\nthat we do to each other\nwe get to this place where we just want\nto tear each other down\nand there's that line in batman where\nthey say you know if you do it you know\nwell long i forgot the line perfectly\nbut it's like if you do it well long it\nright if you do something long enough\nyou two could be the villain yeah i know\nexactly what i mean\nyeah it's okay let me find it it's a\ngood line it's i think i think uh\nheath said it as the joker you either\ndie a hero\nor live long enough to see yourself\nbecome a villain yeah there you go\nyeah yep and and and that's so spot on\nand what we do to each other\nand for me i i recently watched um\nthe uh queen's gambit special the show\non netflix which was fantastic\nand i had coming out of hoffman and\nseeing that i just had this epiphany\nthat i had been\nthis chess player my whole life i had\nstared at the board and people would\ncome and show me attention and affection\nbecause of my skills on that board\nso i thought oh that's love so i'm going\nto keep playing this game\nand people said wow you're really good\nat this you're smart\nyou look at the career you're building\nlook at the life you're building the\nchess pieces are moving and moving and\nmoving and moving\nbut i never took the time to stop take a\nbreath and say hey i'm really good at\nthis game\nif you ever want to talk about it i'm\nhappy to but my name is scott nice to\nmeet you\nuntil now and\nso many people that loved me didn't know\nme\nthat's where the darkness was coming\nfrom because i don't feel like i've\nchanged\ni feel like i've reclaimed myself\n[Music]\nand that was the gift of this year\nyou know i and i've had so many friends\noh they're such a change\ni shaved because when i was doing a\nmeditation i saw the spiritual version\nof myself that i wanted to be\ni didn't have a beard and i literally\nshaved that night and i haven't had a\nbeard since yeah\nand i feel good because i went back and\ngot me\nyou know and and i love\nthe person that i was all these years\nand that's a part of me\ni just reclaimed the rest of me and i\nwas relying too much on one side of the\nbody i went and got\nthe rest and now i'm walking in a\nstraight line and not putting so much\npressure on my right foot yeah\nyou know um that must feel good it does\nand\ni have this teacher now who literally i\nwill lay out things that have\nbeen done to me that are very anyone\nelse would be like and he looks at me\nand goes\nwhat role did you play yeah and it's an\ninteresting thing because you go\nthrough life just learning yeah and you\nknow i think that's why\nyou know i i would look and people think\ngod well god forgave me and i'd get\nfrustrated growing up because i'd be\nlike\nyou're just making an excuse using god\nyeah but i actually now realize\nwhy was i frustrated that they felt\nforgiven yeah\nthat was my stuff i'm angry that they\nfelt forgiving because i hadn't forgiven\nmyself for something\nyes you know and and i had my own work\nto do and i was projecting\nmy stuff on them yeah and the truth is\nif we can all get to a place\nif god sees everything that we're doing\nhe sees our messy\nbecause we're all messy but he loves our\nmessi\nif we can get to a place we start to\nlove each other in the messy\nthat's when you start to feel really\nloved you know i started to love myself\nin the messy\nnow i'm loving other people in my life\nin the messy\nand that's real love it's it's not it's\neasy to love somebody when they're\nshowing up for you all the time yeah\nit's easy to love someone when they're\ngood\nwhen they're doing good and they're\ngiving you this ideal of perfection that\nmakes you feel good\nyou know or not even perfection they\njust make you feel good\nit's so much harder to love somebody\nwhen they disappoint you\nyeah you know and what i've started to\nrealize is\nthrough my own actions if someone's\ndisappointed me or when i've\ndisappointed someone else\nit's because i'm really disappointed in\nmyself i'm projecting it on to somebody\nand that's where that empathy comes from\nand you and i could talk about this for\nhours and\nand i'm the first one to say i'm\nscratching the surface of this\nyeah i'm just figuring it out i'm\nscrewing up on a daily basis\nand i'm just starting to really give\nmyself empathy for the first time yeah\nand i'm excited about it i'm excited to\nlearn i'm excited to dig in and i'm\nexcited to be present\nyeah i'm excited to have long\nconversations with people\nand like look them in their eyes like\ni'm looking you and your gorgeous\neyes there um but\ni'm i've always been i want to honor you\nbecause i've always been grateful\nthat you and i have had these\nconversations yeah me too i mean it's\nbeen big for me because\ni think for me too it's like you don't\nyou don't you know when when things are\nchanging and moving\nand growing fast and you're not even\naware of\nhalf the things and i mean you do a\nmillion things and so\nand that's and that's partly the mistake\nalso because you start recognizing oh\nwell if i'm not aware\nor if i'm not conscious of everything\ni'm doing\nthen maybe i do need to slow down maybe\ni do need to change something maybe i do\nneed to find the right people to be\naround me\nand and it all comes back to everything\nis trying to remind you\nto be conscious to be awake to not try\nand get away with being asleep\nlike everything's trying to wake you up\nall the time whereas we want to go to\nsleep in some areas of our life\nyou know like you want to be able to\njust let go of this thing here over here\nit's so exciting yeah it is when you\nstart to have these discoveries within\nyourself\nthat you want to share so it's almost\nlike hey the thing\nyou've been learning the most when\nyou're not talking you know so it's like\nthis dichotomy\nand then there's that grace of just like\nit's okay\nyeah i don't have to be so hard on\nmyself if i'm excited today\nyeah maybe i'm gonna over talk that's\nokay tomorrow i can be quiet well this\nis an interview with you\nyeah but i'm just saying like it's it's\nthat it's giving yourself that grace of\nlike and that that's another pattern\nlike as a kid like\nyou know you dim your light a little bit\nlike oh you're being too loud and\ngetting to a place in your life where\nyou know when you're when\nyour child is running in front of you\nand they're being louder they\nyou're not holding a grudge against your\nchild\nwe hold these grudges as adults against\nourselves and each other\nbut when we watch children play they\nmove on so quickly\nand i wish we can get back to a little\nbit of that you know within ourselves\nit's you know even today i found myself\njust now being like oh you're talking\ntoo much\nand then maybe i am but that's okay\nyou know give myself a little bit of\ngrace like that's okay and you know what\ni can shut up too and like there's no\nright or wrong here it's two friends\nhaving a conversation and a bunch of\npeople listening\nyeah and everyone's gonna have a\ndifferent reaction yeah\nand that's okay yeah what does\ncompassion mean when we say being\ncompassionate with ourselves\nit means to change your behavior enough\nso that you've shown that you've learned\nbut it means to love yourself\nas you're growing and changing that\nwhich is confusing\nit's confusing but that's what it means\nbecause when people hear the word\ncompassion they think\noh you're just being soft on yourself\nlike oh oh you're not judging yourself\nwhich means you're not holding yourself\naccountable\nbut being compassionate means i know i\nneed to change my behavior\ni'm gonna start doing that but i'm gonna\nlove myself while i do that\nand i think it's i love that you said\nthat because let's take it a step\nfurther let's go back to that workout\nyeah\nright if i'm actually being\ncompassionate myself i'll get back on it\nthe next day\nyes you know it's we act as if we're\nespecially with cancer culture we move\nin such a finite way\nwe don't think long term we don't think\nin judging our lives we judge in the\nmoment and then we judge moments\nlater you know so it's\nthe compassion to me is allow yourself\nto understand\nyou're just in a moment in a very long\nstory yeah\nyou know and your story is not written\nyet\nyou're just writing part of it right now\nand\na great story is never stagnant yeah so\nhow would your teachers\ntell you to treat each moment like how\ndo they how do they say\nto go about it because the one thing i'm\nworking on is well you still have to\nshow up\nyou still have to show up to every\nmoment but how do your teachers tell you\nto show up to each moment how do they\ntell you to treat it mentally as you go\ninto it\nthe biggest mantra that was stated at\nthe start of a moment was don't judge\nthe moment\nas soon as you label a moment it now\ngets labeled in that jar or that box or\nthat filing cabinet and covered\nand then now you never reflect on\nwhether that label was right or wrong\nso just b so just b because if you label\nit's it's the labeling type the mind\nwants to label things to make it simpler\nthat was good experience that was a bad\nexperience that was a good taco that was\na bad taco that was a good restaurant\nit's a bad restaurant\nbut as soon as you label it you now\ndon't allow that to become anything else\nwhat if that restaurant evolves so the\nidea of labeling\nsimplifies for the mind but actually\nmakes the long-term complex so the idea\nis\ninstead of labeling allow yourself to\nexperience\nallow yourself to re-experience and then\nif multiple experiences obviously give\nyou the same experience then\nyou may put a label in pencil but you're\npenciling labeling you're not putting\nlike a permanent marker you know it's\nfunny my teacher\nuses the word be curious yeah exactly\nyou know it's\nit's not be definitive yes you know be\ncurious yes\nexactly and but i want to play this game\nwith you a little bit\ni want to challenge you a little bit i\nlove it only because i want people\nlistening your podcast to hear\nyou respond to this stuff because i\nthink you're brilliant about this for\nthose people who are listening to this\npodcast saying okay i get all this like\nyou know growth and learning and\neverything else but covet's been hard\nand i've\ni don't have a job right now and i can't\npay my bills and\ni've looked up who scooter braun is and\nthis guy financially he's not the same\nplace as me and he's out of touch and he\ncan talk about all the spiritual\nlearning but\nhe doesn't know what i'm going through\nthey're right they're right i do not\nknow their experience i don't know\nanyone else's experience i only know my\nown\nbut what i wanted to ask you is what is\nyour response to someone\nwho is saying this is easy to talk about\nbut\nwhat about in this capitalistic society\nthat i live in\nif i'm doing all this i i think i need\nto kind of just\nbury my head in the sand and just work\nwork work work work i don't have time\nfor feelings and relationship i need to\nget this money\nbecause i've gone on this new app\nclubhouse many times yeah yeah and i go\ninto these rooms\nand i hear everybody talking about get\nthis money get this money how do i get\nto the top how do i do this how do i do\nthat\nand every time i go in a room i keep\ntrying to stay\nthe top of the mountain isn't what you\nexpect so i wanted to kind of push you\non that\nbecause you have extraordinary people\nwho are living extraordinary lives\ncoming on here\nand there are a lot of people out there\nand i was once in\nyou know certain positions but i'm not\nin that position right now and i'm\nsensitive to that and i'm compassionate\nto that what do you tell somebody\nwho says this is all nice and everything\nbut i don't get i don't have that\nliberty\nyeah so the first thing i'd say is\nthat we all get to choose what our\nintention right now in life is\nand if that's the intention that makes\nyou happy and suits you\nthat's fine like i wouldn't even i don't\neven want to edit it i don't want to\nconvince you of anything because i\nremember being in a similar position\nmyself not so long back a few years ago\nand i know that i had an intention to\nmake a choice\nat the same time i would say to them if\nyou're open to the idea that there is a\nbetter smarter more fulfilling way\nto go about making money building a\nbusiness\nfinding your way to the top whatever you\nwant to call it then this is that path\nand if you're open to that then what\nyou're hearing from scooter but again\nwhat i loved you said and\nyou actually made this really clear\nthere was a mindset\nyou've got to this at the right time for\nyou yeah\nwhich i'm remembering because that means\nthat that person whoever saying that is\ngoing to get to this\ni've i don't know anyone who i meet who\ndoesn't get to this\nwhether they're a billionaire or whether\nthey just started out i was lucky enough\nto get here 18 when i met my monk\nteachers\nthis is the stuff i was talking about at\n18 years old because that's what i was\ngiven in this life\nand there are some people that i've met\nthat take until 70 to get it\nsome people are in their 30s and the\npoint is that you are gonna have to get\nhere at some point\neveryone's gonna have to get to this\npoint and you need the context from\nbefore\ncorrect and that's what might i just do\nwhatever you do\nintentionally that's my teacher said to\nme he goes you're exactly where you're\nsupposed to be\nand it's you know coretta scott king\nsaid each generation has to fight the\nfight all over again\nyes you know it all of us none of us get\nout unscathed\nand all of us get the blessing of the\njourney yeah you know and i was thinking\nabout\nyou know the this the teaching we all\nget in our judeo-christian society of\nadam and eve\nand this idea that we sinned and we were\ncast out\nyeah we were punished we were punished\nwe were cast out\nwe realized we were nude we were ashamed\nthat's why we started wearing clothes\nall this different stuff and i started\nthinking about that\nas a parent because\nwe're all god's children so i was like\nwell let me rephrase this in my mind\nwhen i give my child a consequence or a\npunishment\ni don't do it because i'm mad at them\nyeah\ni do it because i love them and i'm\ntrying to guide them to an important\nlesson\nyeah and i realized that my idea of this\nidea that the original sin took place\nwas wrong yeah i believe that\nall of us because god loves us\nand wants us to learn\nare given the gift of life and the gift\nof struggle\nyeah and the gift of being cast out\nso that we can go and get the context we\nneed to appreciate\nthe garden of eden the heaven yeah so\nspirituality the\nenlightenment and\nit's been an exciting way to look at\nthings now yeah that\neverything that's why i loved reading\nmany lives many masters because when i\nkind of realized that a lot of major\nreligions in spirituality actually all\nbelieve me believe in reincarnation\nkabbalah talks about reincarnation a lot\nof major religions talk about\nreincarnation in their spirituality\npractices\nand when you read this book which is a\ntrue story\nand you kind of understand that if you\njust kind of accept that\nyou get to come back and you're always\nlearning yeah you start to not\nfear death anymore and you start to\nrealize\nthis is going to be hard there are days\nmy heart's going to ache\nthere are days i'm not going to want i\nfeel like i can't breathe because i'm\nhurting\nbut all of those feelings all of that is\nhelping us learn things and give us\ncontext for greater lessons\nyeah and\ni'm in it and i'm excited and i know\nthat the funny part is i've come to\nterms the fact of like\noh i'm not here to have this great life\ni love my life and i'm grateful and i'm\ngonna like i've told you\nyou know i'm gonna keep pouring my glass\nin other people's glasses yeah but i\nthink the thing i'm most thrilled about\nis now i understand\nthat pain is coming happiness is coming\njoy is coming heartache is coming\nwhen i least expect it because the fact\nthat i wake up every morning and i'm\nstill breathing means that there's\nsomething else for me to learn\ni kind of take some joy in that now yeah\nbut see this but\noh wow what you just said it that when\nyou just said at the end that last day\nwhen you said but i take joy in that now\nthat was this sounds\nintense but it's actually beautiful and\nthat's where the joy part comes in\nso when we were trained the scripture\nwould say\nthat life is about education\nnot enjoyment like life's about\nenlightenment not\nenjoyment now what i mean by that is the\njoy of learning is the joy of life but\nwe are seeking\nenjoyment through the temporary pleasure\nthrough the external satisfaction\nthrough the quick win through the top\nthrough the mountain whatever it may be\nand as soon as you switch that so every\narea you walk\nif you walked into every room today and\nyou went in there and said how can i\nlearn from it and how can i serve in it\nversus how can i enjoy this moment i\nlove that\nthat's the difference i love that we\nwalk into every room going how can i\nenjoy this you see a woman or a man you\ngo how can i enjoy them\nyou see a house how can i enjoy this you\nknow it's funny i'm thinking to myself\nwhere's the struggle the struggle is\nwhen i haven't learned the lesson from\nthe last room and i'm still stuck on\nthat lesson\nand i got to walk into the next room\nyeah and that's where you start to get\nin a vicious cycle and you know\nit's like you start to falter give\nyourself that grace of\nhey let's slow down let's take that big\ndeep breath yeah let's reset it's why\nyou know when you you went on that trip\ntogether you guys were waking up every\nmorning\nand meditating yeah and i was like oh\ni've learned tm\ni now meditate every morning yeah and it\nhas changed my life\nyes and you know what let me rephrase\nthat\ni try to meditate every morning there\nare days that i miss\nand now i give myself the grace of i'll\nget back on it tomorrow or maybe i'll do\na quick one tonight\nyeah you know i'm not oh i meditate\nevery day\nyeah you know it's i i enjoy meditating\ni like what it does for me\nand i'm if i miss one i give myself that\ngrace and i get back on the you know\nhorse tomorrow\nyeah but that's what i mean that that\nthat the joy\nlike people go well then where's the fun\nin life if i'm always learning where's\nthe fun\nthe learning is the fun part like when\nyou come into a new place and like your\nteacher said you're curious\nlike when you came in here you were like\nlooking at the quotes yeah the people\nyou're not trying to enjoy the art\nyou're like curious and you want to\nlearn that is the fun of\nchildlike that's childlike exactly where\na childish mentality is to enjoy\nwell you know it's funny as i started\ndiving into all the different major\nreligions yeah\nthere's a quote in almost every major\nreligion that talks about god\nif you like they ask jesus they say show\nme you know\nshow me god and he says look at the\nchild yeah and in judaism they say it in\nhindu they say\nlike all these different every religion\nyou'll find something that points to the\nchild\nyeah and the innocence of the child and\nthe love the child has\nand you know for me\ni talked to um someone who actually went\nto hoffman after me\nand you know this person hit me up and\nthey were like\ni'm losing the high life is pulling me\nback in i'm getting depressed i'm losing\nthe high that i had three weeks ago when\ni got out\nhow do i get it back and i said i don't\nknow if i'm right\nbut i'll try and answer this question\nand the way i'm gonna answer it i don't\nknow if you're gonna like\ni said you got a high\nbecause you dealt with your worst demons\nand then you gave yourself forgiveness\nand you learned\n[Music]\nif you want to get that high again stop\nlooking for the happiness look for the\nresistance\nlook for the lessons and the resistance\nand when you have the epiphany again\nyou'll get that high back\nyeah and that's that's exactly the point\ni'm making is that we're looking for the\nhigh\nin life constantly we're looking for the\nenjoyment we're looking for that\nuh release that that fun moment but\nyou got that experience from the work\nyeah right and and that's such a\nbeautiful way of looking at it tell me\nabout\nsome of the projects that you're working\non right now that excite you the most\nthat you feel like are allowing you to\nlove more some of these could be\ni know sp projects media work but it\nalso could be some of the philanthropy\nwork that you're doing that\nbehind the scenes some of the work that\nyou feel so excited and proud of\nbecause i also want to give you an\nopportunity as i want everyone who's\nlistening to have the opportunity\nto celebrate the stuff that they're\nexcited about because again you'll dim\nyour own light so\ni'm going to ask you to brag about what\nyou're doing\nnice i appreciate that but it's it's\nit's weird because of where i am right\nnow\nservice based yeah but even service\nbased i mean\ni am having the most joy\nout of watching people that i supported\nhave their own wins weirdly\nthat is my biggest joy right now\nwatching justin bieber\ntake ownership of this album the way he\nhas\nownership of the performances the way he\nhas\nownership of his decision making the way\nhe has\nthis is the most hands-on he's ever been\nin his career\nthis is the most he's fought\nto push back on all of us to say i got\nthis\nand i told the other day proud is not\nthe word i respect it\ni respect it so much i'm\nso happy to see where ariana is in her\npersonal life in her decision-making in\nher\nchoosing to face\nso much trauma she's been through\npublicly\num and be the person that she is\ni'm grateful watching this demi\ndocumentary like i'm blown away by her\nyou know i can't wait to see it you know\ni am\nandrew watt just one producer of the\nyear i know the year and a half that\nhe's had\nand for him to come out the other side\nand then\ntell me the grammy was amazing but the\nwork i'm doing on myself has been the\ngreatest reward i mean\ni'm really proud of a lot of people in\nmy professional life\nand then i'm really proud of the people\nin my personal life\nbecause i'm seeing them do the same\nthing so it's\nweird like the accolades for me\naren't necessarily the fact that i'm\nmoving the chess pieces\ni did that for a really long time it's\nthat i'm seeing all these other people\nwho've been around me in my life and i'm\nlooking over at their chessboard and i'm\nadmiring their game\nyeah you know i'm admiring their game\nand\ni'm admiring who they are and i'm\nadmiring\nwho they're showing up to be and i'm\njust admiring their journey\num and i'm not passing judgment i'm just\nenjoying watching i'm curious\nyeah you know and to me\nthe funny thing is in the last six\nmonths\nsince i've let go more\ncommercially i think i've had more\nsuccess than i've ever had in my life\nbecause i'm trusting and i think there's\na weird reward in trusting the universe\nbecause i'm i'm finding that joy and\nthings have not been easy at times um\n[Music]\nbut i'm leaning into those uneasy times\nand saying where what is this resistance\nlike why am i hurting what does that\nreally mean\nwhat is there for me to learn there and\ni'm doing that as often as i possibly\ncan\nthat's what i'm celebrating that's what\ni'm excited about i'm\ngetting to a deeper place and i'm hoping\nthat my friends like you\nhold me accountable in six months when i\nstart getting\nout of that yeah and remind me of this\nand say\nare you doing your meditations have a\nlittle you know self-compassion that\nyou've missed a bunch\nnow you're giving me permission to do\nthat yeah i want that because i think\nthat's what friends are for\nright if you give them permission yeah i\ngive you full permission\nto keep me accountable to make me\ncontinue to learn the same way i said to\nmy wife\ntell me to get back in my heart you know\nlike\nand and i think we all\nshould be that for each other but not in\na judgmental way\nyeah i'll probably reach out and say\nlet's meditate together yeah sure that's\nwhat i'll do so\ni'm accountable too yeah because yeah\nit's yeah it's i\ni like i said i've always been grateful\nfor our friendship\ni've been grateful knowing that i have a\nfriend who's as spiritual as you are\nand enjoys the conversations of\nspirituality\num because it allows\nyou push me and you inspire me and i'm\ngrateful for this friendship well you're\nthe same man i i feel like the way\nyou've opened up today\nand and this is what i'd like this is\nwhat i try and do on this podcast\neveryone who's been listening or\nwatching\nfor me i like learning about the full\nhuman\nso when i sit down with someone i'm not\nseeing them\nas an athlete or a manager or a\nartist or i'm seeing you as a complete\nspiritual being and i want to hear that\nstory\nso when you're listening to this\nwhoever's listening or watching listen\nto\nthat story with every one of our\nepisodes and this one included as well\nbecause it's so easy to listen to\ninterviews these days and people pick\nout the one little thing\nand then it that becomes the meme and\nthe whatever it is and it's like but you\nmissed the point of the whole\nconversation like\nagain what we've been encouraging for\nour own selves as well\njust as if you don't give someone else\nthe permission to have context\nwe are blocking ourselves from having\ncontext of our own self yeah\nand that's the biggest thing i've\nlearned from today hearing you say it\nwhich reaffirms my belief of the\nunderstanding that\nif you're not giving someone a chance to\nexplain\nexpress be curious make mistakes then\nyou're basically blocking yourself from\ndoing the same thing\ni agree and and the more permission you\ngive everyone to do that the more you\ngive yourself permission to say what was\nmy role\nyeah i love that what was my role\nbecause i think that's where it starts\nif you can forgive yourself\nyeah for something you might not even\nrecognize yeah\nthen it's much easier yeah you asked me\nwhat happened\nearlier and i i was thinking about that\njust now like\nyou know is there a specific thing that\nhappened yeah you know what happened\nmy wife yale and my children i learned i\nlove somebody more than me\nand loving them\nmade me go do the work so what happened\nis\nthey were the greatest gift of my life\nand\nfor that i'm internally grateful and i\nwant each of them\nto have their own individual process in\ntheir own individual journey\nyeah you know and i want them to know\nthat i love them\nand they're messy yeah you know and\nand uh and i'm just grateful for them\nthat's it yeah i love that man and and\ni'm so grateful to you i want to say it\nback to you because\nyou know when i've gone through my tough\ntimes you really get to see who's\nshows up for you especially when they're\na newer friend or someone you're just\ngetting to know\nand and when you've stuck by me and and\nsupported me not in a\nwe've never had a relationship it's not\njust like oh yeah we're boys like it's\nnot like that it's\nlet's look in the mirror what work have\nyou got to do what do you need to work\non what where are you what is your role\nin this\nlike that friendship i think is so\nspecial and then feeling support from\nthat again\nloving your friends through growth\nloving yourself through growth making\nsure that you know you need to change\nbut you love someone through that change\nuh scooter we end\nevery interview with the final five\nwhich are the rapid fire fast five\nquestions so you have to answer in one\nword or one sentence maximum\nlet's go i am judging you on you if you\ntalk to you\nand i will and i will ask i will ask you\nto expand when i get intrigued\nall right so starting with your first\nquestion you ready\nall right the first question is what's\nthe best advice you've ever received\num david geffen told me that well\nfirst it's love more but really he what\ncomes to mind david geffen told me that\nin a hundred if you don't know he is\nlook him up\nhe said in a hundred years no one's\ngonna remember me so they sure as hell\nwon't remember\nyou don't have an ego and i loved it\nthat is great piece of advice all right\nsecond question what's the worst piece\nof advice you've ever received\ni think as a kid you're told it's your\nfault and you start to believe oh i'm a\nbad kid i deserve that\nand i think that was the wrong advice\nbeautiful man all right number three uh\nsomething that you\nare pretty sure and confident

you know this 90\nof what i do in business people don't\neven know which is the way i like it so\nlet's keep going\nwell no for me it was just the reason\nwhy we didn't talk about business is\nbecause\nwhen i started the podcast it was all\nabout what can i talk to people about\nthat no one else can do\nthat's also you and i don't have that\nrelationship nor should we yeah\nwe have a real relationship it's not\nabout business it's about the person in\nfront of you totally and\nand also just like you you're prolific\nyou can talk about so many different\nthings in so many different places\nbut this we're going to talk about it\nlike you know this is also fun for me\nbecause\nyou have treated me the way i actually\nwant to treat myself like i told you\nabout the chess board of
