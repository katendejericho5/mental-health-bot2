    "transcript": "the thing that i have failed at most i\njust\nhaven't set clear boundaries because\ni've been too scared to\ni've always wanted to like give\neverybody everything that i can i'm\ngonna give you my heart i'm gonna give\nyou my time my energy all my words\nbecause i haven't felt deserving of\nholding much of that back for myself\nsetting boundaries now is definitely\nsomething that i know\nis going to help me have healthy\nrelationships\nfull stop\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you that come back\nevery week to listen learn and grow\nnow you know that it's my priority to\ntry and sit down with people that i\nthink\nare going to expand your mind give you\nincredible tools for thought\nand help you navigate the challenges\nthat come\nin your lives and today is no different\ni'm so excited because today's guest is\nnone other than fern cotton\na tv and radio presenter and author her\nmost recent book\nspeak your truth was published in\njanuary 2021\nand i can't wait for you to hear about\nit make sure that you click the link and\norder it\nas soon as you finish listening she's\nwell known for presenting on radio one\nand on the bbc\nand the extra factor she also is the\nhost of her own podcast that i got to be\nour guest on last year\nhappy place which uh was just such a joy\nand fun i'm\nso glad to be engaging with you again\nand being present with you again\nand i had such a good time on your\npodcast that i had to have you back on\nand i'm so excited because today i get\nto ask questions and you get to answer\nthem so\nthank you for doing this well thank you\njay it's an absolute honor and um yes i\nwill try\nand relax and let go and not interview\nyou which is my comfort zone it's very\nawkward and weird for me to be\ninterviewed so i'm just gonna like\nshake it off let go and you can do your\nthing well someone smart once said speak\nyour truth\nso i will uh i will remind you of that\ntoday\nto to speak yours uh and and not\nnot make me speak mine but i actually\nwant to start somewhere\nuh a bit bit playful but i've been\nloving your running selfie videos\ni i think they're genius and they're\nbrilliant and i've not seen many people\ndo that before\nbecause it's so vulnerable it's so\nawkward it's so difficult\nand it's it's a skill it's an actual\nskill and i wanted to start there just\nby asking you you know what\nwhat inspired you to do that because\nit's\nit's such a different way of connecting\nwith people we usually\nusually you have people finishing their\nworkout and be like just done my workout\nor people or you see people ready for\ntheir workout in their best\nathleisure but you're doing it while\nrunning\ntell us well first of all i'm not that\nperson who wears like\na slick gym kit and looks amazing\nworking out i\ntend to wear the t-shirt that i've worn\nthe night before in bed\nand whatever leggings are clean and\na bra that will support what's needed\nand i'm\nout the door and i think the main\npurpose\nof um doing those little videos on\ninstagram\nis to get people to get outside because\ni know if i wake up and i feel a bit\ngrumpy and i really can't be bothered\nif i see somebody online who's just been\nfor a run and they look like they're\nproperly pumped and feeling good and\neuphoric i'm like i've got\ni've got to go i've got no choice i have\nto get out the door\nso i think it's just to remind people\nthat we've got agency over what we\nchoose to do each day and getting\noutside\nis a really good idea if you can do it\nyeah i think that's a great reminder i\nlove that and it simplifies it because i\nthink when you do see this\nperfect version of going outdoors or\nthe perfect park or the perfect view it\nbecomes really difficult because most of\nus\ndon't look that i just got back from\nplaying tennis which is my\nworkout every day and i did not look\nlike this when i finished playing all\nwhen i went out\nand actually i was facetiming with my\nfriend in london\nand i was wearing a hat because it was\ncold in l.a this morning\nand he was looking at me he's like why\nare you wearing a hat like why do you\nlook like that right now and i was just\ni was just like it's so cold right now\nin l.a in the mornings at least and so\nno i love that i think that's a great\nreminder one of the things i notice\nabout you whenever i see you\nis the same when you interviewed me and\neven today you're always so colorful\neverything you do is so colorful from\nyour clothes to your headphones to your\nphone to your microphone to\nthe cover of your beautiful new book to\neven even the happy place i i think the\nall the graphics and everything is just\nso beautiful when did color\nbecome important to you has it always\nbeen important to you\nand tell us about that journey with\ncolor because i feel\nlike when you're on tv in the beginning\nyou wear muted colors or you may have a\nstylist but\nfor you you've you've just embodied you\njust\nembrace and embody color all the time\nyeah i\nlove color it's always been really\nimportant i think it probably goes back\non a really subconscious level to\ngrowing up\nmy dad has always been a sign writer\nsince\nyou know he was a teenager himself\nso we always grew up with a lot of paint\nand color in\nin that respect and i i'm a massive fan\nof painting myself so i've always been\nreally into\ngetting colour on canvas and drawing and\nit just makes you feel good and i'm not\none of those people that\nis desperate to look chic or to look\nperfect or to look\nreally like sophisticated i'm not\nsophisticated\ni like to express myself and i like to\nfeel\njoy and i like to push the boundaries in\nthat way\nso yeah i think i try and inject color\nlike in my home\nall the walls are painted in various\ncolors and i it just makes me feel\nreally good and just sort of elevated i\nthink when\nwhen we're feeling really low and down\nand\nwe want to blend in we want to wear dark\ncolors and we want to not be seen so i\ntry and push myself to\nget myself out there and you know wear\nthings that are going to make me\nfeel alive and vibrant so yeah i'm much\nmore color than i am\nchic that is for sure i love that i love\nthat and no i i think it's a beautiful\nform of self-expression\nand and it's nice that you've allowed\nyourself\nto just give yourself the permission to\nto wear whatever color you want to put\nwhatever color you want\non the background and and you do feel so\nmuch better from it and i think it\napplies to\nsomething that i think you embody quite\nuniquely and in your introductions\ntitled this\nyou know how getting quiet made me\nlouder\nand when you when i read that and i read\nyour introduction a new book i was\ni was thinking about that statement i\nwas thinking about how people view\nwellness meditation well-being\npositivity often it's viewed quite\nsober and still and sometimes it can be\nseen as quite clinical and quite\nboring in one sense it's like oh you've\ngot to be very\nstill and silent and quiet but you\nembody it with this paradox and i'm i'm\na huge\nfan of paradoxes i love when two things\ncan meet and\npeople often ask me they're like jay\nlike you were a monk but now you're in\nmedia how does that work and i'm like\nthat's what i love about life that you\ncan\nyou can be two things and you don't have\nto\nyou don't have to choose and they're not\nnecessarily mutually exclusive they're\nnot opposites but they can\nand and i feel you do that too like on\none end you're speaking about\ncalm and quiet those are titles of your\nbooks and now it's about speaking your\ntruth which is all about loud and being\nout there and speaking up\ntell us about how you found sense or\nmade sense of having those two\nseemingly opposite ideas i think it's\njust very much you know who i am as a\nperson i\nyou know traditionally i come from a\nbroadcasting background\nso i think i always like to also\nchallenge\nhow people view you i don't want to be\nput in this car you know and it happens\nto people in the public eye a lot that\nonce you're defined as one thing you\nknow you can't change you can't move\nfrom\nfrom that career to that career and none\nof this was on purpose you know i didn't\nthink oh i'm gonna\nyou know sort of move away from\nbroadcasting and start talking about\nmental health or whatever\nit was all very sort of accidental and\nincremental to get to where i am today\nbut i think it all does work like life\nis a big mess\nyou know life isn't linear life isn't\nperfect life is\nnever one thing it's it's everything\nlife is\neverything and it's color and it's\nmonochrome and it's loud and it's quiet\nit's\nabsolutely everything and i i kind of\nhave to find that balance because if i\nespecially again you know in the uk\nbeing in the public eye if i'm putting\nmyself out there again and again and\nagain\nand also then you are open to whatever\nfeedback you get\ni have to find the balance with that and\nfind the quiet\nbit and find the still bit and i don't\nthink there's still bit\nit i used to probably view it as quite\nboring and like you've said\nperhaps clinical or sort of stagnant but\ni really don't now\ni see that bit as exciting because i get\nto process\nall the craziness that's just happened\nor all the thoughts that have been\nbuilding up or all the emotion that i'm\nreally\nnot enjoying and sit with it and just\nlet it you know permeate and b\nand i just get to sort of look at that\nso\ni've only really found that balance in\nthe last probably five or six years but\ni really enjoy\njust oscillating between the two and\ngoing with it so yeah i don't want life\nto be one thing that would be\nterribly boring i think it life is\neverything\nand it should be and i hopefully present\nit in that way with the work that i do\nyeah no you do definitely and i think\nwatching someone's\nso i i used to watch you as a kid right\nand and i mean when i say a kid you were\na kid probably on tv i was yeah\nbecause i think we are we're in the same\ngeneration so\ni was watching you on tv when i was\ngrowing up in england\nin london and when i'm watching you and\nnow i see the journey you're on and now\nwe're in the same space and we care\nabout the same things and we value a lot\nof the same things\nand and i love seeing that journey and\nyou're what you said there was so true\nthat sometimes if you're in the public\neye\nand what i find for people is that even\nif you're not in the public eye\nyour family is your public eye or your\ncommunity is your public eye or your\nuniversity or your school is yours for\neveryone\neveryone has a public eye even if\nthey're not a public figure\nand so often we feel scared or uncertain\nto shift who we are because people\nknow us as one thing tell us about where\nyou\nfound the courage or how was stillness\ninstrumental in those\ntransitions because you've had massive\ntransitions\nin the public public eye with family\nmembers with people in your life\nwhat was going through your mind in\nthose transitions what were those points\nof courage that kind of\nyou had to take which i think a lot of\npeople will empathize with\nand and feel that they're in that\nposition well i'd love to say that i\nfelt\ntotally confident making any big\ndecision but\nthat is so not the case i think you know\nthere although it was all very\nincremental there was of course a moment\nwhere i made\nan active decision to leave the main\nbroadcasting job i had at the time which\nwas on bbc radio one i had a daily show\nwhere i'd get to interview\nyou know the most amazing musicians\nevery week whether it's like eminem the\nfoo fighters alicia keys you know it was\njust constant\namazingness and and i loved every minute\nbut i\njust knew where i was in my life and i\nyou know i was having kids at the time\nand i just\nneeded change i didn't even know what\nchanged i just thought i need\nsome i need to shake it up i want a new\nchapter\nand i had to jump into the void and i\ndidn't have anything\nto necessarily fall back on i was lucky\ni had a home and i had a little bit of\nsavings that could kind of\nsee out whatever this unknown period of\ntime\nwas going to be but there was definitely\nno safety net there isn't in my job\nwhatsoever you know you can be\nyesterday's news very very quickly so\nit was terrifying and i had a lot of\npeople going to me\nwhy are you leaving radio you're\nabsolutely mad it's the best job in the\nworld\nhow could you you know why would you do\nthat it's just a crazy decision\nand every time i had to go back to the\nfeeling back to the feeling of i know i\nneed change\nback to there's an itch and i can't\nignore it anymore i need change but\nit was terrifying like every time\nsomeone said to me why are you doing\nthis\ni had to really step back and go why why\nam i doing this and it always went back\nto that feeling of\ni can't even articulate what it was i\njust\nneed change and it was scary for ages\nyou know i lost sleep over it for months\nthinking\nhave i made the right choice have i\nruined everything\nbut i i couldn't ignore that feeling of\njust wanting something a bit different\nso it was it was as simple as that there\nwas no you know huge confidence or\nmoment where i was like\ni know that i'm headed in the right\ndirection it was just jumping into the\nvoid and\ni'm hoping for the best\ni love that i love that honesty it's i i\nthink you're spot on i don't think\nanyone's\never fully confident about a decision\nand and i think you're so right that\nwhen you're walking through that\ndecision you're holding on\nso tight to that feeling of i don't know\nwhat it is but i know i need to change i\nthink that's such a real\ni can relate to that so you can't ignore\nit you can't\nyeah you can't you can't and and have\nyou ever found that when you kind of get\nto the other side where you've made the\ntransition people have now\nsomewhat accepted who you've now evolved\ninto\nand now all of a sudden there's a\npressure especially with what you do now\nthere's a pressure to always be positive\nor a pressure to\nalways say the right thing or come\nacross a certain way do you find that\nyou also come up against that sometimes\nwhere there's a\nwhere now you get pressure for your new\nidentity almost\nyeah but i think the the sort of\npressure to be purely positive i had\nreally in my sort of\ntraditional broadcasting career because\ni couldn't have gone on tv on or on\nradio one and said oh god i feel\nabsolutely crap today you know\nthat was there wasn't space for that\nwhereas now i think the only pressure i\ni feel is to be completely authentic\nand completely real and that that\nprobably took a little bit of confidence\nto go\ndo i want to do that can i do that you\nknow how vulnerable will i feel if i do\nthat\nbut i've actually i feel more\ncomfortable doing that than i did\npretending everything was brilliant i\nthink i used to just feel like under so\nmuch pressure every day to have you know\nthe funny quip\nthe right thing to say to a band or or\nwhatever it might be whereas now i think\nif i'm feeling awful if i've had\ninsomnia the night before\nif i've had a panic attack i now have an\naudience who are\nkind of willing to listen to that and\nthen to get into a discussion about it\nso if anything it's like lessen the\npressure and i feel\nway more comfortable like talking to you\nnow i think before i would have had to\nbe like\noh my god what would presenter fern say\nand can i be funny in this bit now i'm\njust like\ni'm a mom i've just been out on a walk\nwith my kids\ni've just squeezed in a little instagram\nlive this room that i'm in is a bloody\ntip there's just stuff everywhere and\ni'm knackered but i'm really happy and\ni'm presenting myself to you\nas i am whereas i just i couldn't do it\nbefore and i've had years of\nconditioning from like the age of 15 up\nto sort of probably\nmy early 30s and now as i sort of\nhurtled towards 40 this year\ni'm pretty comfy being me and that feels\nreally nice i love that i also want to\nadd just for everyone who's listening\nright now that we're doing this\nin fern's evening because she's been\nkind enough around\ndoing it in my morning in l.a so she's\nin london or in england\nand and it's it's 6 26 there or\nsomething like that right p.m\nand so i want to say a big thank you to\nfern and a big thank you i want to say\nthank you to you because right now\nyou've given me the best excuse to miss\nthe most\nhectic awful bit for any parent which is\nbath and bedtime\ni'm like i'm out of it i am up here\nchilling i might even pretend when we\nfinish that we're still going so i don't\nhave to go downstairs\nso thank you\ni love that i'm not a parent yet so i\nguess i'll find out but\ntell me tell me where you draw that line\nbetween\nand i'm really intrigued to get into\nthis with you because i think i think i\ni i relate to what you're saying and and\ni\nyou know listen to your podcast and i\nhave read your book and so i i feel like\ni\nhave a good understanding of your\nthoughts but where do you draw the line\nbetween\nbeing fully authentic and accepting who\nyou are and showing that\nand then finding action and growth\nand movement in a direction because i\nfeel like that's something you do quite\nwell where\nyou're okay with except like you just\nsaid and you gave a beautiful\ndescription of your room and everything\nat the same time you're someone who\nwants to grow\nand improve and and so but how do you\ndraw that balance in line for even the\npeople that listen to you so that\nit's it's more because it's more when i\nhear you and i read your work\nit's it's not just about venting or\nexpressing it's more than that tell me\nabout that walk me through that\ni can sum it up so clearly because i\nfeel in every bone i am like the driving\nforce behind\nall of it is curiosity i am so\nunbelievably curious about all of it\nand i think you know now i'm at the\npoint in life that i'm at and having had\nthe life experiences that i've had and\nthe big\nlows and the big highs i'm so\ncurious to learn and i'm so curious\nto hear about other people's lives like\nthat that's the foundation of the\npodcast\ni want to know like what drives people i\nwant to know what gave them the\nconfidence the courage to make big\ndecisions i want to know how they got\nout of like\ndark black holes that they felt they\ncouldn't get out of\ni'm so curious because like you just\nsaid i want to move forward i want to\ngrow\ni want to expand i don't want that to\never end i want that to be\njust perpetual like an omnipresent\nwillingness to learn and\nand move forward but with everybody else\ni don't want to be like here i am i'm\ntelling everybody what i know\ni'm with my audience doing it because\nyou know i could have had a panic attack\nthe night before about something but\nthen the next day be interviewing\nsome amazing prolific teacher or speaker\nand i want to get as much as i can out\nof that for me so i can\nhelp myself and also for my listeners\nbecause especially at the moment\neveryone is struggling if it might not\nlook like it\nbecause we'll go on instagram and\neveryone looks like they're having a\nwicked time but\neveryone is struggling in some way it's\nall varying levels obviously\nand in varying ways but everyone's got\nstruggles going on so\ni wanna i'm not gonna sit there in those\nstruggles i'm gonna\nlisten to these i'm like how lucky am i\nthat i get to interview like\ndeepak chopra or elizabeth gilbert like\nhow lucky\nthat i get to sit and do that so i'm\ngonna get\neverything i can out of it because i'm\ncurious and i think when we're curious\nwe can't get bored we can't get\ncomplacent\nand we'll always always be willing to\nlearn i love that and i think\nwhen you when you allow yourself to get\ncurious about\npain or challenges or pressure\nas opposed to getting judgmental about\nit or getting\nself self sabotaging or judgmental about\nhow you feel about how you feel right\nnow\nyou allow yourself the opportunity to go\nokay well what can i learn from this or\nwhat can i learn from this person\nwhen when was it that you felt you\nstopped speaking up like when was it in\nyour life where you realized you were\nlike\ni've stopped speaking up i've stopped\nexpressing myself i think for for all of\nus there's\nyou know definitely this just you know\nit happens all over the world\nthis uh very normal social conditioning\nthat we all go through either from our\nparents teachers just from being out of\nyour own home\nout amongst strangers that you act a\ncertain way you know\nlike my kids are now five and one of\nthem's about to turn eight\nand you know they're pretty wild still\nas they should be you know if they're\nunhappy about something they will\nkick off in the middle of the street i\ndon't care there's people watching or\nthat it's embarrassing or whatever\nthey'll just go for it and you know over\ntime we all get that sort of social\nconditioning that we have to act a\ncertain way we shouldn't show certain\nemotions etc\nyou know some of that's going to serve\nus well because we're going to be able\nto forge great friendships get jobs\netcetera but we all take it\nway too far and i think for a lot of\npeople\ndepending also on the type of person you\nare and the dynamics that you find\nyourself in\nyou might become highly responsible for\neverybody around you so feel like you've\ngot to always be pleasing everybody and\nyou shut down\nyour own needs and and you know the\npossibility of delegation etc\nso i think a lot of us start saying yes\nwhen really we mean no\nand for me that probably started\nat quite a young age because i started\nin tv at 15\nand i came from you know working class\nbackground didn't know anyone in tv this\nwas like the\nabsolute dream come true completely\nunusual\nso i wasn't going to turn up and be like\ni'm not wearing that i'm not saying that\nyou know i was like yes i'll well\nanything you want i'll wear the purple\ncordrey flares\nyes yes you can make me have any makeup\ni don't care i'll say whatever you want\nbecause i couldn't believe i was in the\njob and again some of that served me\nwell because i was able to keep going\nbut again i took it\nprobably way too far and in my 20s i\nthink there were a lot of moments\neither at work but also in my personal\nrelationships where\ni just didn't feel the confidence to say\nmy bit i just\ni didn't feel deserving of it i didn't\nfeel\nlike i just felt like well who's going\nto listen to me\nwhat what's what's my voice got to do\nwith it i thought that everybody else\nwas right that\neverybody else knew so much more than i\ndid\nthat i just let everybody say and do\nwhat they wanted and i just remained\nquite silent\nand again this has been such a new thing\nfor me you know\nreally within the last 12 months is when\ni've dug deeply into this subject matter\nso really it's only the last few years\nthat i've even\nexperimented with using my voice in a\nreally authentic way where\ni believe i can help people but also i\nbelieve that i deserve\nto ask for help to say no and to set\nreally healthy boundaries\nlike this is very fresh and new for me\nlike this book is not coming from an\nexpert led place this is like\ni am on this journey with you\nhow do we do this so hopefully the book\ncomes across\nin a way that's encouraging but also\nlike i am struggling i am with you\non this one because it's really hard it\ndoesn't feel anything else but\nreally genuinely you're coming from that\nplace of like guys i'm trying to figure\nthis out right now\nbut at the same time i think you said\nthree really incredible things there you\ntalked about\nsaying no uh setting boundaries like and\nthere's one more but but those two first\nof all saying no and setting boundaries\nas being\nsuch important simple steps to speaking\nup because i think even when we think\nabout speaking up we think\nwhat does that really mean yeah and and\nthere you've kind of defined just very\nsimple steps that someone can start with\ntell us about\nsaying no because i think that was a big\none for me i've\nthat was a big one for me for this year\nactually for me for 2021 where i've been\nunfortunately had to email back a few\npeople at the beginning of this year\njust saying sorry i'm just\ntrying to learn to say no and i just\ncan't do this you know and it's it's so\nawkward because\nyou want to please everyone and you want\neveryone to be happy and you want to\nmake people happy and tell us about\nsaying no in your journey of\nunderstanding where and when to use that\none\nyeah well yeah first of all it's you\nknow it's absolutely right that i don't\nthink speaking your truth is just like\ni'm going to say whatever i want to\nanyone because that's problematic and\nwe'll get onto that later but i think\nsaying no is a really good way of\npracticing this because like you say you\nwant to keep everybody happy and sweet\nand you also want to be making the right\ndecisions\nso that you're meeting interesting\npeople engaging with interesting people\netcetera but\nyou know when it becomes detrimental\nthere has to be\nhealthy boundaries and also like one of\nthe easiest ways to\ntest whether you really meant no we've\nall done this\nsomeone says not this year because we're\nnot able to go anywhere\nbut you know can do you want to come to\nthis party\nnow i don't really like parties that\nagain has been something that i've found\nthe confidence to say out loud more\nrecently\ni hate them i just don't like parties i\nsometimes like my own parties which is\nquite selfish\nbut i'm not a massive fan of going to\nlike unless it's someone that i really\nknow well i'm gonna know everyone there\nthen that's super fun\nsomeone invites you to a party and you\nsay yes because you think how can i not\ngo to the party i've gotta go to the\nblooming party\nthen the day before the party you're\nliterally like\ndreading the party you can't even think\nof how you're gonna leave the house it's\ngonna be\ndark you're gonna be knackered how am i\ngonna leave the house to go to this\nparty\nand then on the day you make up some\nawful excuse\nthat you know you've your kids got a\nrunny nose and there's a work thing that\nyou didn't\ndo and and then you're lying and then\nyou're lying\nand then you don't go to the party and\nthen you spend all night at home going i\nfeel so guilty about going to the party\nit's so awful that i lied i didn't go to\nthe party\nif you just said no two three weeks\nbefore\nnone of that would have happened but not\njust like no\nno with thank you so much for inviting\nme\ni'm not really in the headspace right\nnow where\ni'm i want to be out with lots of people\nbut i would love to take you\nto for a coffee or whatever at another\ntime\njust so me and you can celebrate your\nwhatever it is that's happening\njust be honest because people like that\npeople like honesty rather than you\nmaking up a lie\ndown the line so that's a really obvious\nexample but\nwe have all done that and you can apply\nthat to work\nfamily commitments things you said\nyou'll do your favors whatever\nif it's not really what you want to do\nthat's all right i don't think you're a\nbad person i think i'm a bad person for\nsaying no\nwe can't do everything it's impossible\nit's it's a good example actually\nbecause i think\nwhen you shared it it just shows you how\nthe simple act of saying no in a nice\nhonest way\nsaves you days of headache\nyes and and and that's literally what\nhappens when we don't speak our truth\nor we aren't honest with ourselves is\nthat you\nend up creating so much more headache\nand and pain for yourself because now\nyou're thinking about this very simple\ndecision\nfor for way too long and of course it\ngets more complex with\nmore complicated things but but it's\nstill the essence is still there that\nyou can save yourself\ntime energy effort relationships\nyeah all of that all of that can be\nsaved when when you say no you also\nspoke about setting boundaries tell us a\nbit about\nsome of the boundaries you think you've\nset maybe in the last 12 months\nthat have been really healthy boundaries\noh this one i find\nso difficult and i've really learned\nfrom amaze some amazing people like this\nthere's this wonderful um speaker and\nwriter that i know called donna\nlancaster who is like\nso big on boundaries and i have learned\nso much from talking to her because\nit's probably been the thing that i have\nfailed at most i'd say\nover the years as an adult that i just\nhaven't\nset clear boundaries because i've been\ntoo scared to\nbecause i haven't had the confidence i\nhaven't felt deserving\nand i've always wanted to like give\neverybody everything that i can\ni'm gonna give you my heart i'm gonna\ngive you my time my energy all my words\nbecause i haven't felt deserving of\nholding\nmuch of that back for myself so that\ngoes into a whole other thing of like\nself-worth and you know that can derive\nfrom all sorts of life experience of\ncourse but\nsetting boundaries now is definitely\nsomething that i know is going to help\nme have healthy\nrelationships full stop it's not gonna\nannoy people\nit's not gonna make me ostracised from\nsociety\nit's gonna create really healthy\nrelationships even with people\nthat i find tricky or people that find\nme tricky\nwhere there's like that discord is gonna\njust help in\nevery way so i think what i've tried to\ndo recently\nis be really honest about what i can\noffer people because\ni'm a mum of four kids i have two\nteenage step kids and two younger kids\nand i'm a wife and i'm a i'm a daughter\ni'm\na sister i'm a friend i am also\na very passionate worker and i love what\ni do so\nhow can i spread myself across all of\nthat\nand stay sane and that\ncomes down to just being honest with\npeople i i really\ni can't give you any more than i'm\ngiving you right now i love you\nbut i can't give you any more and i\nthink again when you're honest with\npeople\nthey might at first be like ouch oh okay\nyou're not giving me what you used to\ngive me all the time\nbut one i think that's just the initial\nbit of setting boundaries then there\nis a new normal after that so this is\nsomething i am\nvery gradually getting better at yeah\nbecause it feels like there's so much at\nstake\nright it feels like there's so much to\nlose when you start setting boundaries\nbecause your relationship with this\nperson has been built on certain\nexpectations and now you're taking away\nsome of those expectations\nyou feel like you could lose this\nrelationship and that could apply to\nwork\nthat could apply to a partner a best\nfriend a parent\nyou know i think a lot of people go\nthrough this with their parents where\nthey have a very specific relationship\nwith how their parent is involved in\ntheir life\nand now when they have a new person or a\nnew partner or a child it\nit starts to change that relationship\nand it feels scared so\nit's almost like a lot of this comes\nback down to being so\nnot sure because like we've we already\ntouched on that you're never\nsure about the decision you're making\nbut you need to be sure that this isn't\nworking almost like it's almost like you\nmay not be sure about\nwhat is gonna work but you're sure that\nthis doesn't work\nyeah like we all know the definition of\nmadness you know like doing the same\nthing on repeat but expecting a\ndifferent\noutcome you know that's just that is mad\nand we've all again we've all done it\nyou know i've\nmoaned and complained about things or\npeople over the years and\nthey want so much for me and blah blah\nbut i had never changed my side of the\nstory like we need to be responsible for\nwhat we're putting out there and you\nknow it is very complex like you've just\nsaid when it comes to\nyou know parents or very close relatives\nbecause they might have years and years\nof being used to you being one way\nand as soon as you change that and you\nmight decide\nquite quickly that you need to make\nchanges and implement them quite quickly\nthat might not go down well instantly\nbut it's still going to be better than\nwhat was\nhappening before which was just banging\nyour head against the wall\nresenting people you know maybe bitching\nabout them behind their backs whatever\nit might be rather than being honest\ncreating a healthy\nboundary that allows them to understand\nwhat you can do\nand give and receive and also give them\nthe opportunity to do the same\nyou know it hasn't got to be a one-sided\nthing of you just spouting out about\nwhat you need and want this can very\nmuch be like a two-way street of\nokay i can't give you any more than i am\nwhat what do you think you\nneed from me and you know you just use\nthe word expectations which i think is\nis so you know so common that we have\nexpectations of people\nbecause they've got you know the name of\nthis role in life whether they're uh\nit could be mother or it could be sister\nor friend\nand sometimes we need to look at what\nexpectations we're putting on other\npeople as well as ourselves you know and\nand is it fair to have expectations of\nother people and what are the varying\ndegrees of that it's\nall it's all bespoke to what's going on\nin your life i can't tell anybody out\nthere how they should be living their\nlives but we'll know\nwe'll know deep down what the you know\nwhat responsibilities we hold and if\nthey're the right ones or not\nand i have i guess um\nover the years generally been someone\nthat takes on a lot of people's\nresponsibilities that aren't mine\nand i've thought that they were and i've\nactually recently gone\noh god none of that stuff's mine i don't\nneed to carry that that's not\nmine i'm gonna just slowly hand that\nback and set a new boundary but\nagain as i said this is like new stuff\nfor me i'm learning it and i'm excited\nby it so i'm talking about it so\npassionately\nbut it is it's an everyday commitment\nand it's hard\nyeah i love that we almost have a to-do\nlist for other people so it's like\nthat person's happiness that person's\nstillness that person's\nyou know and it's and and it's nice\nbecause it means we care and we want to\nhelp out but\nthe problem is when you see it as yours\nand and that's the challenge right it's\nit's wonderful to be of service it's\nwonderful to help people you love and\ncare about\nbut when you start seeing that their\nhappiness is your responsibility\ni think jay you know once you've set\nclear boundaries and you've reserved\nenough energy or whatever it is for you\nyou can be more of service to people\nbecause you're all right\nif you're strung out doing everything\nfor everyone and make sure everyone else\nis happy you\nare gonna feel horrendous and have\nnothing to give so\ni think it actually allows you to be\nmore of service to others because you're\ntaking care of you're taking\nresponsibility for yourself your actions\nyou're not blaming everyone but equally\nyou're setting clear boundaries you've\ngot more to give so i think it leads\nback to service which you know you're\nthe expert on your\nyou're so wonderful when you talk about\nservice i think you have to come from\nthat place of\ni'm all right therefore i can be of\nservice\nultimately it comes down to what you\nsaid so beautifully is that\nyou should never see it as yours that's\nthe issue i feel like as soon as you\nstart seeing it as\nit's all yours and all for you to do and\nif it doesn't work then it's all your\nfault and that's that's where it starts\ngetting\nreally messy because it wasn't yours to\nbegin with\nyeah and i think that that's you know\nthat's where so many of us get stuck\nand it's tricky because you know as a as\na parent that one is\nso complicated because these little\npeople you know\nespecially when they're very young you\nare responsible for most of their life\nbut i think there is still this sweet\nspot of like say they are\nhaving a huge tantrum or seemingly\nunhappy about something\nyou can go into complete like self-blame\noh my god am i parenting right it must\nall be my full blah blah\nand i think you know you do still have\nto have that\nslight moment where you step back and go\nthey're little people they are their own\npeople\nyou know they're i can't be responsible\nfor that\nyou know having other emotions other\nthan happiness is fine\nand i can let them do that like if\nthey're going to be super unhappy about\nthis\ni'm going to let them do that right now\nyou know and it's there is still a\nlittle sweet spot i think where you can\ndo it but\nit it is tricky and i think especially\nwith teenagers right now they're having\na really tough time\nnot necessarily my step kids but i mean\nyou know in general teenagers across the\nglobe are\nfacing a lot of uncertainty you know the\nfuture is very unknown\nand that for parents is really really\ndifficult because you want them to feel\nokay\nand at the moment i don't know how any\nof us are meant to do that so\nso it is complex it's not an easy thing\nto do but\nwe have to be able to let go\nto some extent because it is out of our\ncontrol yeah no\nfor sure lockdowns lockdown as you were\nsaying and we were talking about as\nyou've been touching on it's been a\nreally tough time\nfor everyone in in every way and you\nknow different things for different\npeople across the world\nbut but for you it's also been a time of\nbeing really creative\nand and you've felt this really creative\nspark both personally and professionally\ntell us about why you think this time\nwas so powerful for that because i think\nfor a lot of people it hasn't been that\nor\nthey want to shift to that and they\nhaven't quite got there\nhow was it such a creative time for you\nyeah i\ni know exactly why and it it's\nreally interesting i think you know i've\ni've not\nbeen in my adult life someone that is\nparticularly good at like going on\nholiday\nor vacation you know i'm not i'm not the\nsort of person that's like oh\ni'm just going to relax for a week or\ntwo weeks\nwhen i'm in that sort of space and you\nknow the pandemic has been\na much less glamorous version of that\nwhere we're not going on holiday but we\nwe we're forced to stop we can't do\nanything\nwhen i'm forced to stop everything comes\nto the surface\nbecause i'm so busy normally and i keep\nreally busy and i'm probably quite\nhyperactive as a human\nwhen i'm forced to stop everything comes\nup\nand i might have a period where i'm like\nso\nedgy and like physically tense like oh\nmy god i could just like pull my hair\nout i don't know what to do with this\nenergy like i can't stop how can i stop\nand then that starts to turn into okay\nwhy are my feet what emotions are there\nwhy am i feeling like this what does it\nroute back to\nand then i'm just buzzing with ideas and\nthoughts and things because it's\nall floated up all the stuff that's\nnormally like below at the moment\nhomeschooling cooking for the kids\nmaking sure the house isn't a complete\nand utter tear etc everything's just\nsort of rumbling down here but as soon\nas we have to properly stop like the\ninitial lockdown there was nothing to do\nthere was no work\nnobody worked out how to do this yet you\nknow like podcast on zoom\nthis was all like in the future so i was\njust struck with like\noh my god and it coincided with me\nhaving this\nyou know diagnosis of a huge cyst on my\nvocal cords\nthat then again you know there was no\ndistraction from that because there was\nnothing to do\nso i was like why is it there i need to\nexplore this so i think\nin moments where i'm forced to stop\nlight going on holiday\nlight being in your first lockdown of a\npandemic\ni'm wanting to organize it all and sort\nit and then\ncollate all of that and do something\nwith it so i think i'm quite\nlucky in the fact that that's how my\nbrain works but it's obviously\nreally annoying when i do have the\nchance to relax because i sort of\ndon't know how to do it i'm kind of\nawful at going on holiday\nbecause i just don't know how to stop\nbecause i just there's so much stuff in\nmy head and feelings coming up so\nthere's good and bad to thinking like\nthat\nyeah yeah i that's that's definitely\nthere i think a lot of\npeople feel that way that you know you\ngo on\nvacation but you're thinking about work\nor you're at work and you're thinking\nabout the vacation and\nthat whole dichotomy of always\njust feeling full but but in a difficult\nway but at the same time\nsometimes it's that fullness that\ncreates something really special and\nbeautiful and so\ni think i think right now if people are\nstruggling to be creative\nwhat kind of advice or tips would you\ngive them if people were feeling i do\nwant to be more creative\ni do want to use this time i've got i've\ngot used to this now\nlike i've got i've got used to the fact\nthat this is life now\nand this is normal because in the\nbeginning i mean you know in the first\nmonth no one knew what was happening and\nwhere it was going but\nnow people may be thinking i want to be\nmore creative i want to be more\nproductive and effective where would you\nrecommend they start i mean i can only\nreally talk from my own personal\nexperience of how i do it and i think\nany negative thing that happens to me or\nany negative emotion that comes up\nor anything i feel stuck in or edgy with\nmy first thought is oh how can i how can\ni use this you know what can i do with\nthis rather than\noh this is awful i hate this i'm trapped\nin it i go\nwhat can i do with this and i think if\nyou work in a creative industry or your\nhobbies are creative whether it is\npainting or music or writing or poetry\nyou can channel all of that like some of\nthe best songwriters who are\neither friends with the ones that we all\njust know and love you see them directly\nchannel their most\nhorrific pain into something so utterly\nbeautiful\ni'm not doing it on that level but i am\ncertainly using it to go right\ni need to do an instagram live about\nthis i need to do an instagram live\nabout panic or anxiety or i need to\nyou know write a piece about the feeling\nof dread like i\ni need to get it out and i want to then\nengage with other people to hear what\nthey think what their experience is so\nit's not just this kind of\ninternalized thing that i'm going\nthrough i want to feel outside of that\nor what are you\nwhat's everyone else thinking about that\ndo you feel this you know i'm\nagain it goes back to that curiosity so\ni think if you are\na creative well everyone's a creative\nperson there's no like creative type of\neveryone's creative on a level it's just\nall manifests in a varying manner i\nthink you need to not\ndis disregard all the negative\ncircumstantial things that happen to you\nfeelings that you have things that\nyou're witnessing that you feel is\nunfair\nchannel that into creation we've all got\nthe ability to do it it might not be\nfine art or writing a beautiful piece of\nmusic it might be gardening it might be\nmaking something out of cardboard boxes\nwith your kids but just get like channel\nit out i think\nwhen we get stuck in all that negativity\nthat's where we get\nwriter's block or can't paint or\nwhatever but use all that dark stuff and\nmake it into something gorgeous yeah\nthat's such a\nthat's such a great point i think that\nyou've brought up because\nit's almost like everything in our life\nis cyclical\nand and everything's going around in a\ncycle and the challenge is that when\nwe're feeling something it's just\ngetting stuck\nand it's just getting stored somewhere\nand blocked somewhere\nand and often we think it's not\nshareable\nbecause it's not beautiful or it's not\nbut but that's your point that you can\nactually be\nthe person to transform that feeling\ninto something shareable into something\nbeautiful into something\nnot perfect we're not saying to turn it\ninto perfect\nsaying turning it into something that\nmakes you feel like you've had an\nopportunity i think the\nexample of a musician is such a great\none i think that's such a brilliant one\nbecause\nall the music we listen to are songs\nusually about that person being in pain\nof some some sort and now it's coming\nout in this way and we love that\nand we need to do that for ourselves i\nthink that is such a great\ngreat way of looking at emotion and i\nhope everyone who's listening or\nwatching today\nyou find a way to notice the pattern of\nwhat you feel regularly\nand find a creative outlet for that and\ni i mean i could give a personal example\nit's small but it was huge for me and it\nmay sound really basic but it was so big\nfor me\ni i really don't enjoy working out i\nnever have\ni really enjoy sport i don't enjoy\nworking out\nnever enjoyed the gym don't enjoy\npersonal trainers don't enjoy\nworkout classes like that's just not me\nbut i love sport\nand so when i used to live in england i\nused to play football with my mates\ntwice a week and it was amazing\nand then when i moved to la i couldn't\nreally find a group of that many\n22 people every week to play football\nand so\ni started going to the gym to keep fit\nand healthy and all the rest of it and\nthen obviously during lockdown that\nended\nand and i was really finding that\nworking out had become such a\npain point in my life it was almost like\ni felt that kind of block\nand to exercising and when i'd go on a\nhike it was nice but i didn't feel i was\nreally exercising\nand recently i started playing tennis\nand\nwhat i love about it is that i start my\nmornings feeling like a kid\nbecause it's playful it's competitive\ni'm not great at it like i'm i'm\nokay but it's playful and i feel like\nnow when i\nstart my day after having done that i\nfeel so happy and playful and fun and\nlike a kid and i'm like\ni'm ready for the day as opposed to\nbefore i was working out and starting my\nday\nfeeling stressed that i hadn't worked\nout enough\npressured that i hadn't done it right\nand then feeling\ntired from the workout not excited and\ni'm just it's so interesting how these\nreally simple things when we're not\nexpressing that like i need to feel like\ni'm\nplaying and competing in a fun way uh\nand\nand when i'm not doing that i don't i\ndon't get to express that if that makes\nsense\nyeah because i tell you what's sprung to\nmind there\nis you know this weird modern-day\nconcept\nprobably that all has been\num generated from how we use social\nmedia\nthat so often we're trying to like force\nour creation to this thing that as you\nsaid earlier\nends up being this perfect image or this\nperfect\nmoment or this perfect piece or whatever\nit is\nso we're kind of like forcing our\ncreation\ninto this square whereas let it be\nimperfect like perfect so uh\nlike what is perfect like perfect is\njust\nit's subjective anyway but it's become\nsomething that perhaps is um\nmore of a well it's certainly an\nalgorithm now you know like oh this has\ngot so many likes so this must be\nperfect and we're all trying to create\nsomething that\nis the perfect algorithm and it's like\nbe\nmessy be creative be playful\nbe you know let that pain all the good\nstuff\ncome out and manifest and create\nsomething that is\njust you so you know i know now if i put\na picture on\ninstagram of me looking dog rough you\nknow\nsaying that i didn't sleep last night\nthat's me showing you\nwhat is really happening and i'm\ncreating a moment for you\nwhere you can understand how i'm feeling\nif someone wants to have a go at me or\nthey don't think it's the perfect image\ni don't care like it's so not the point\nfor me\nanymore because i just think it's we can\nlook for perfect everywhere\nwe can go on pinterest we can follow\ncertain influencers on instagram\nwe can find perfect so easy it's all\nover the shop\nis it meaningful is it\nis it deep is it nourishing\ni don't think so but you know look at\nall people that i think eye class is\nlike my heroes like david bowie\nwas he this shiny perfect person no\nhe was this kind of iconic bizarre\ncreature who had you know two different\ncolored eyes and\noutfits that were totally not the norm\nand he just broke every boundary he\nwasn't looking for perfect he was\nlooking to\nexpress and create and i think we've all\nbecome\nso focused on creating perfection rather\nthan\njust what feels good and like you said\nwith tennis what's playful and fun\nexactly exactly and and yeah i can agree\nwith you more i think\ni think uh you're right it's\nperfection's subjective it's not real we\nall don't know what it is it's elusive\nit's\nit's ever changing its definition when\nyou look at\nyou know i've read articles and studies\non like what\nuh the perfect body shape for a man\nand women that's been created by media\nand how it's changed\nthe media cycle and you just see how\nlike a different\nin different decades different things\nwere seen as perfect and\nit's all just created and manipulated by\nwhat we see and what we're exposed to\nand so\nthere is no such thing as perfect uh but\nit there is just allowing yourself\nto feel but what you're saying what i\nthink the distinction that i want\neveryone to get who's listening and\nwatching is\nit's not just about feeling your pain it\nis about expressing it\nsharing it creating from it because i\nthink there's a lot of\nthere's a lot just about feeling it\nwhich is important but then something\nhas to happen with it after you've felt\nit\nand i feel that's where a lot of us are\nmissing that link\nyou know maybe create maybe say using me\nusing the word creating is actually\nbeing too narrow-minded because a lot of\nthe time rather than sitting with that\npain\nyou could choose i often if i'm feeling\nangry\ni will run i will get outside and i will\nrun and i will listen to some like heavy\nmusic like kings of leon's first album\nwhich is all angry and ferocious and i\nwill\nrun it out like i'm not necessarily\ncreating anything but i am\nmoving it on and i'm getting it out and\ni just know that\nif i feel one of those heavy emotions i\njust can't sit in it i've got to do\nsomething so if it's anger i need\nmovement\nif it's depression i need to write or i\nneed to\ntalk i need to connect with other people\nabout it even though that feels\nnearly impossible but i've got to do\nthat and if it's panic\ni probably need to paint or draw or do\nsomething fidgety and like\nyou know move and get it out of me you\njust have to work out what's right for\nyou but like get it out\nget moving get it out that's a great\nlist though that that's a really good\nlist of\nand and that's exactly what i think\nabout like i always say when you when\nyou feel hungry\nyou eat when when you feel you need to\nbe clean you take a shower like\nwe have we have something to go with how\nwe feel and we haven't\nfound what we should focus on\nwhen we feel something and what you've\njust drawn there for yourself\nwhich i agree you're not saying everyone\nneeds to do it the same way\nbut but i love the way you made that\nreally simple it's that when i feel this\ni need to focus on this when i feel this\ni need to focus on this and\nand it's almost like each and every\nsingle one of us and i know your book\ndoes this beautifully you have\nlots of different activities and\nexercises and places for people to\nscribble\nbecause i think it's so important to do\nthat to feel something and then move\nforward or focus on something else so\ni i think that's a really great piece of\nactionable\nadvice that i would suggest that if\neveryone can say\nwhen i feel this if i feel this\nthen i do this and you can play with it\nand experiment with it\nand also look at what you do habitually\nbecause\nnormally and this is what i've learned\nthe very hard way what i used to do was\noh i feel depressed i'm gonna buy some\nshoes\nyou know i've done an action but it's\nnot been the right one\nso i think we've got to find things that\nare free because that\nall of the good stuff is free we've got\nto find things that are\neasily um attainable or achieved so\nwhether it's just like\ndrawing with a pen on paper so it hasn't\ngot any paints in a canvas you know just\ndoodling like just express in a way that\nis like\nvery old school and natural and free\nbecause that\nthat will always be the thing that feels\nbetter than\nbuying something or like you know\nspending hours scrolling through\ninstagram because you feel sad that's\nnot going to make you feel better either\nor sending someone a terrible text\nbecause you want to blame someone else\nlike\ni think it's about making sure that\naction is gonna\nbring you up a level from where you are\nnot make you sink further you know\nwhat's gonna get you\none rung up the ladder even if it's like\nanger\nto you know just feeling a bit edgy\nthat's good you know that's better than\ngoing\ndown into like despair just i think it's\nabout looking for the action and i\ni don't always do this god i will still\nsometimes buy a pair of shoes when i\nreally shouldn't be or\nyou know you know say something to my\nhusband that it was like\nnot his fault and just go and blame him\nyou know i'm still i'm a human i'll\nstill deal that\nbut i from the work i do and the people\ni talk to i definitely have a\na deeper awareness of the moments where\ni should\ntake a good positive step in in the\nright direction\nyeah that's brilliant thanks fern i love\nthat so i've got\ntwo segments that we end on purpose with\nevery time\none's called fill in the blanks and the\nother one's the final five\nso we're going to start with fill in the\nblanks first and so\nfern this is your fill in the blanks uh\nvulnerability\nallows me to share\nlike it allows me to share that is the\ngift of it\none of my truths is\none of my truth says i still find it\nreally hard to speak my truth\nthat's great that's a great one calm is\nfound in\nbed with a book nice uh\nsolitude allows me to\nbreathe breathe\nand then last fill in the bank my\nfavorite color is\ngreen earthy grounding green\ninteresting was not expecting that cool\nokay\nall right your final five uh what's one\nthing you know to be true about yourself\nthat others might not realize that i\nlove\nlove love being on my own and being\nquiet\ni don't think people would assume that\nbecause i connect constantly with people\nbut i\nlove being alone and i love being quiet\nyeah that's the same with me i i can\ntotally relate to every time i say that\nto someone they're like no that's so not\ntrue that's not true\nyeah yeah they're like no yeah you don't\nknow yourself jake\nokay good the second one what's the\nbiggest lesson you've learned in the\nlast 12 months\nboundaries boundaries boundaries\nboundaries boundaries\ni am learning it every day it's the most\nimportant lesson\nset healthy boundaries with love\ni love that uh if there's one gift and\nwhen i say gift i don't mean a physical\ngift i mean like a gift of life\nthat you could give your kids what would\nit be the gift of\nlearning to set boundaries even with me\nwhich would be so hard because i'd be\nlike you can't set boundaries with me\ni'm your mum but i'm gonna have to live\nthat one\nto the end yeah that's that's probably\nthe toughest one i guess right\nbut it kind of comes back at us that's\nthat's a really important thing though\nit's\nyeah i'm gonna take a slight detour\nbefore our last couple of questions in\nthe final five but\nwe talk a lot about and maybe you were\nsaying about your\nyour friend and the expert you were\nspeaking about with boundaries we speak\na lot about setting our own boundaries\nbut how good are we accepting other\npeople's boundaries\nonce we get good at setting them\nourselves\nwe probably naturally will be much more\naccepting\nof those given to us like so say my\nfriend donna who i was talking about\nevery text she sends me she goes like\nyesterday\ni did this interview recently um i\nthought i'd send it to you if you want\nto read it\nboundaries you don't have to and you\nknow she'll constantly allow me\nto set a boundary she'll ask for one and\ni'll go no i want to read it it's fine\nbut i think\nonce you're really good at it you're\nalmost expecting people to do it i think\nwhen we find it\nwhen we're either being a martyr which\ni've definitely done over the years\ntry to like do everything for everybody\nelse and put myself last you know\nall that sort of stuff or we're just\ngenerally people pleasing\nwhen people set boundaries we think how\ndare you i give\neverything to you i do everything for\nyou and you're setting a boundary\nbut that's only because i haven't set\nany so i think when you're setting them\nwell\nyou're almost expecting other people to\nso i think that one will hopefully come\nnaturally with the other yeah that's a\ngreat answer i i think that's also a\ngreat\ntest and self-check on whether you're\nactually setting boundaries effectively\nis if you can ex\nif you can accept someone else's\nboundaries chances are you're getting\nbetter at setting them\nyeah and that's a good it's a good test\nand a good check i like that i'm really\nglad we touched on that all right your\nfinal two questions\nif you could create a law for everyone\nin the world to follow what would it be\nyou can't say set boundaries but you can\nyeah yeah boundaries\num you know i think\ni have to look at what's going on in the\nworld at the moment and\nwe certainly don't need any more rules\nthat's for sure so i think it would be\nthat we all have to just accept that we\nall think differently because we're all\neveryone's\nfighting everyone's arguing everything\nis so divisive and at times we do\nneed to stand up for our beliefs and\njoin in a community and\ndo good if it's always coming from like\na benevolent place\nwith good intent but i think we just\nlike the\nthe thing i think we all need to think\nand that the sort of law that we all\nneed to kind of abide to is\nwe're we all think differently like that\nis that is human nature that is\nlaw that is what's going on we we all\nthink differently you know we're not\ngonna\nalways meet in the middle and that\nthat's life\nwe have to be accepting of that yeah\nit's a great great answer all right\nfifth and final question\nwhat's something that you used to think\nwas true\nbut now you no longer do um i used to\nthink that\nsuccess was kind of like the biggest\nthe best the shiniest the most perfect\noh i really don't think that anymore at\nall it was the biggest\nlie ever that i believed you know\nsuccess is\nit's a feeling it's a feeling\nit's not a thing it's not it's not a\nnumber\nit's not something that's visual it's a\nfeeling\nof you know i could do something that\nwas quite small and\nintimate with my writing\nand it just felt juicy and right\nand that is success and i think we all\nneed to in the modern world\nreally look at that you know marker\nof what success is to us rather than\nwhat it looks like on instagram how many\nnumbers there are\nfollowers money shiny cars whatever\nit's it's just not any of that\nsuccess is a feeling and i've\ncertainly learned that over the last\nprobably 10 years of my career i'd say\ni love that thank you so much fern\neveryone speak your truth\nis available right now make sure you go\nand grab a copy of the book\nlike i said it's got loads of great\nactivities and exercises and lists and\nthings
