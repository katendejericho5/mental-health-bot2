the worst i've\nnever put a makeup for any podcast or\nanything i'm like\nbut anyway but you don't have to look\nhow handsome you are well you're very\nkind but\ni i could do with a bit of it but no i\ni'm so grateful to have you honestly i'm\nso so grateful\nthank you i was so happy when we\nconnected i've been a huge fan\nadmirer and no i was completely blown\naway i've been admiring you\ni was telling i was telling someone i\nwas like oh yeah i know jay and then i\ngo oh my god no i don't\nuntil we met and i was like i feel like\ni know you yeah well you were just\ntelling me and i\nand i want to ask you a ton of questions\ntoday because i feel like\nthe beautiful thing about you is you can\nspeak about talent and art\nyou can speak about parenting you speak\nabout life you can speak about activism\nlike you've really\nare living such a whole life and i know\nbut it's\nit's beautiful for me to observe and i\nwant to learn from you today and\nmy first question is just about you were\njust telling me now that you've been\nlistening to a lot of podcasts yeah and\na lot of them have been around parenting\nespecially\ni wanted to ask you what have you\nlearned about yourself\nuh through santiago oh my gosh uh i'm\nsaying his name right santiago yeah\num you do learn a lot about yourself\nwhen you have a child well he's just\nstarting to get\nto the responsive age so like what\npeople don't realize sometimes\nyou see you know parents disciplining\ntheir kids so early and you're like no\nthey don't have reason yet they don't\nhave\num judgment yet so like that's all going\nto waste and\nand you want them to explore you want\nthem to fall down you want them to touch\nthings that they're not supposed to you\nwant them\nto learn um i didn't realize i think\nwhat i learned\ntwo things i learned was what a\ndisciplinarian i am just in the sense of\nlike\nyou know okay you're gonna go to bed at\nthis time and this is what he's gonna\neat and this is like and my husband's\nlike the\nfun time guy and i always thought like\ni'd be the fun time person\ni just like you know his him having\nstructure\nuh and then him having freedom within\nthat structure um\nbut like bedtimes and nap times i'm\nreally like on top of it\num and the other thing that surprised me\nwas kind of like what you were talking\nabout which was my\nactivism my political activism or my um\nphilanthropy\ngot so much more intense and and that\nlike\nlike things hurt me in a deeper way now\nlike i just go oh my god i gotta leave\nthe world a better place even\nto do my tiny tiny tiny part the\nanxiety um that i have about that and\nthe stakes for me are so much higher now\nlike that's really like i was like oh\nthere's nothing surprising about\nmotherhood like if you\nread all the books and information\nthat's out there\nit's out there but like when when it\ncomes to like oh gosh wow that\nsurprised me of of just how intense my\nwork is getting now\nhmm that's beautiful i love it i love\nthat though just that the fact that you\nrecognize\nyeah we all become so much more mindful\nand\naware and aware that our actions matter\nand the world the way we leave it is\ngoing to matter yeah\nso many other generations that's a\nbeautiful lesson you know the biggest\nlesson i think i've learned so far from\nfrom many podcasts was mostly from how\nto raise a good human\num and i forget her name but uh she\nalways says you gotta which can be\napplied to everybody in your life but\nshe was talking about how to raise a\nchild\nwas meet them where they're at right\nlike people\nwell kids are at this point so you gotta\nmeet\nthem where they are you can't expect\nthem to\nknow more be more um say more\nif they're not ready they're not ready\nthey gotta learn that they gotta evolve\ntheir little\nnot only kinesthetically but like\nmentally emotionally\nyou know physically all of that and i\nrealized oh my gosh\nthat's what people like if you meet an\n[ __ ]\nyou're like oh okay he's not where i'm\nat right now\nso um i'm gonna have to figure out where\nhe's at so we can communicate or if you\nmeet\na wonderful person you can elevate\nyourself to meet them where they're at\nand like i was like oh my god it was\nlike that was a mind-blowing thing i\nlearned\nwith um the parenting the parenting\nuh podcast yeah that's beautiful and i i\njust want to point out\nhow amazing it is right now because\nshe's been talking a lot\nand she's had to do voice-overs she's\nhad an amazing movie out\nlike precious i know that's why i have\nthis sexy voice everybody\nnot that you didn't already but but\nshe's doing this\neven when she's got a strange voice so\nwe have to love her even more for that\nuh tell us about this you know you\nyou've said before\nthat you literally were the black sheep\nof your family yeah\nand now you look at where your life is\ntell us about like\na did you ever see it happening be like\nwhat it felt like to start that way\nbecause i think so many listeners today\nmay feel like the black sheep of their\nfamily\nright right no i really was i've asked\nmy parents many times if i was adopted\nbecause i look like no one i sound like\nno one i\ndon't even have the same illnesses that\nthey like they all have this\ni don't or i have this and they don't or\nlike i was like\nmom you can tell me now i'm an adult uh\nbut no turns out i\nam my my parents child\nbut no i was raised you know as black\nliterally the black sheep because my\nsisters were blonde\nand very light-skinned when they were\nborn and\nlike hazel eyes they all have very very\nvery light eyes and when i was born i\nwas born with a full head of black hair\nmy eyes are nearly black and\ndark skin i mean they call me la prieta\nwhich means ugly dark one\nalmost spanish yeah and um as people\nwere like who called you that i go\nmy mom my family\nand i that was i mean that was my entire\nlife people would walk up to my mom and\ngo your daughters are so beautiful\nand who's this and i'd be like i'm the\nbaby\num and you know my mom i mean i was\nspoiled with love i mean they\nloved me um amazingly so it's not like i\ni did without\nbut it was amazing how um\npeople defined i guess beauty was you\nknow this like especially in any\npeople of color community the colorism\nright like the lighter you are\num the the more opportunity you have for\nwhite passing\nwhite privilege situations and so um\ni feel like because i wasn't quote\nunquote pretty like my sisters\ni developed a sense of humor and so i\ndealt with everything with like\na sense of humor since i was six you\nknow and and kind of carried that with\nme throughout life because i didn't\nblossom\nuntil college like it wasn't until\ncollege that i actually\nlike oh people are noticing me and oh it\nwas literally like a summer and\ni had my face changed my\nmy hair changed it was funny i mean wow\nyeah and do you think humor was a\nhealing or a defense mechanism like both\nokay i think i think it originally\nstarted out as a defense mechanism like\ni'm going to criticize myself before you\ndo\nuh and then laughter was so healing and\nto hear people laugh\nwas healing to my heart and i was like\noh okay i'm gonna be\ni'm gonna be the clown then and then i\nmade a career of it\nyeah no no but i love that because i\nthink it's so important to\ntransition our defense mechanisms into\nhealing because sometimes as you know\nthe defense mechanism can just become\nthis\nyeah way of processing it in the moment\nbut then you walk home with\nall of that baggage yeah and it feels\nreally heavy yeah\nwhereas when you're healing it's almost\nlike oh actually i realize that there\nare multiple ways that people can\nappreciate you and recognize you and\nyou can serve and you can be significant\nyeah and i think once like once like\ni became famous i guess is um\ni i became famous late like i was 30\nyears old when and when i became a\nhousehold name\nand i already knew who i was by then yes\nso i had a really strong\ncenter of of who i was and i didn't let\nanybody dictate it whether it was the\ntabloids or\npeople or you know today it would be\ncomments but back then they didn't have\nwe didn't have instagram\nso that's how old i am but um and so\num that helped me and\ni never defined my life by beauty up\nuntil that point it was\nup not up until that point till i got\npeople's most beautiful and most\nbeautiful list\nthis and sexy that and i was like oh\nthat's cool\ni just thought it was cool i didn't go\noh that's who i am now\nand um you know i think that made a big\ndifference was that i was a little older\nwhen\nyes all those things started happening\nor when people\nactually tried to identify you only as\nbeautiful\nso now they go well you're obviously not\nsmart or hard-working or anything else\nbecause you're beautiful\nyes and you're like yeah no no you can\nyou can be many things yeah\nand they're like you can be only one\nthing and i think that's amazing because\nwhat you're saying is\nbecause you'd had time to construct your\nidentity as to who you truly were\nthen when people started to make your\nidentity singular yeah you were able to\nactually look at that and be like no\nactually\ni already know who i am yeah and this is\na part of it yeah but this isn't all of\nit\nyeah yeah you said it's so much more\neloquent than i no not at all no\nyou made a beautiful point i think it's\namazing i i think that there's so much\nto be said for that because\nit's it's almost like we know that like\nuntil we decide how we feel about\nourselves\neveryone else's feelings are just going\nto take over\nhow did you how did you yeah go on no\nyou're going to say something beautiful\ni really wasn't nothing nothing that\nbeautiful but i was going to say i'm\nkind of going through that\nagain right now\nof finding my identity because i feel\nlike that can change you can evolve like\ni'm not who i was when i was 30.\nand now that i'm directing and producing\nmore and i'm behind the camera\neven conveying that to my teams whether\nit's my agent or my publicist or my\nmanager or my\nthe people that actually have to make my\ndreams come true or who\nwho help me facilitate my dream like i\nfound myself lately being inarticulate\nabout it and so that's\none thing i meditate on is clarity like\ni go okay i need clarity because usually\ni've\nmy whole life i've been this is who i am\nthis is what i'm gonna do this is the\npath i'm walking here we go\nand now i'm like oh okay and being a mom\nchanges that too like it totally you\nhave a different compass\nlike you're handed a whole new compass\nand it's like here's north this is north\nnow and you're like\noh okay it's not me\ngod yeah i can imagine but i'm so glad\nyou said that thank you for sharing that\nwith us because i think it's so\nimportant for all of us to realize that\nthat evolution doesn't stop yeah and\nthat we have to go through it again\nbut the fact is you've been through it\nbefore so you have the familiarity to\nbring in\nright and like you said there's gonna be\nnew challenges yeah but the first one\nyou ever went to i feel and this is more\none that i've seen is\nyou know at one point you were going to\nbecome a physical therapist yeah or\nand then and then where did acting come\nfrom so tell us about like almost that\nfirst kind of\nthis is another funny story because i\nwas in college i was in my last year of\ncollege and i didn't have enough money\nto finish my senior year so i was gonna\nhave to drop out\nand my girlfriend was like you should\njoin\nthe scholarship pageant it wasn't a\nbeauty pageant\nit was a scholarship page and i was like\noh okay what what\nis that and what is that and it's\nbasically beauty passion okay but\nyou win a scholarship and and like first\nplace was like scholarship books tuition\nboarding meal it was like the whole\nshebang second place was like a little\nat third place with a little\nfifth place was books and and something\nelse and i said oh my god if i could\njust get fifth place\ni think i can figure out how to pay for\nthe rest and so i\nentered the pageant i remember calling\nmy mom and i said mom i need a dress\ncause i'm gonna be in this pageant she\ngoes\noh honey is that a good idea because she\ndidn't think i was pretty enough oh my\ngod she really was like\nyou're gonna set yourself up for\ndisappointment you're gonna be hurt and\ni was like no i'm not doing it because\nof that\nand because i was not doing it for that\ni\nuh i didn't really take it personally i\nwasn't going to take it personally and\ni was like mom i'm just hoping to get\nfifth place hopefully fourth right\nand i was doing like the statistics like\nif i could just\nyou know there's 20 of us here i just\nhave to do better than 50\npeople anyway uh turns out i win the\nwhole thing i did i won the whole thing\nmy mom my sisters didn't believe me they\nwere like was anybody else in the\npageant and i was like\nguys i'm pretty now uh i know\ni but it was and so what happened was\ni was graduating with my kinesiology\ndegree and i\ni'm still obsessed with exercise science\nand physiology and\nthe body and and fitness and so\ni wanted to be a sports trainer i wanted\nto work for like the dallas cowboys\nwhere i wanted to work for like a really\nmajor team\nand in the prize package was a trip to\nla\nto go and compete in this talent\ncompetition and i was like oh that'd be\nfun just to go to la i'd never been\nreally outside of texas\nand so i graduate college\ni come to la and i just go\ni did this little competition and i got\nall these callbacks and people were\ninterested and\nand they were like oh my god you're\ngreat you're amazing and i was like i i\ndon't even\nwhat is this where am i what is this i\nalso fell in love with l.a i remember\narriving in l.a\nand probably taking the best breath\nof my life like i went like my world\nopened up outside of\ntexas and not only outside of texas but\nlike outside of corpus christi texas\nand i just remember going whoa there's\nother things in the world\nother people it was the first time i'd\nseen a jewish person on the street like\ni was like oh\nthere's a person with a hat and the oh\nmy gosh and\num it was the first time i saw an indian\nperson and i was like\nthat's another mexican like me and\nthey're like no that's an indian person\nand i was like oh my god\nthere's other people of color you know\ni mean it was so eye-opening just to be\nin la\nand i said i think i'm going to do this\ni'm going to stay here i'm going to\nbe an actor and i remember calling i\ndidn't even go home i didn't even\npack enough clothes i just said mom i'm\ngonna stay and she goes okay\nlike my mom my parents were totally\nhappy because i got my degree\nthey were like you know what as long as\nyou have your degree of course you can\nget a job anywhere\nand i was like yeah i'll get a job and\nand it literally was a left turn and it\nwas some\nguiding force i really think about\nit now i i wouldn't do that today i\nwouldn't get up and move my\nlife and i didn't know anybody had no\nmoney um\nno car no i knew nothing about an\nindustry i wanted to be a part of like\nand i was and i felt supported and\nguided by\nsome sort of energy and presence and i\njust thought oh yeah this is where i'm\nsupposed to be i\nit just felt completely right and i was\nnever one of those people who said\nnow i'll give myself three years and if\nit doesn't work out i'm going home i\nnever\ni was like no this is it so it's going\nto take as long as it's going to take\nwow that's amazing how were you able to\nwhen i'm listening to you\none thing that's really coming out for\nme is how were you able to\nseparate the comments or judgment that\nyou were receiving from your family\naccept the love that you've received\nfrom them which you said beautifully you\nsaid\nthey always loved me and i felt that and\nhow were you able to see that\ncomment and judgment as separate from\nthat love because\ni find like so many people today one of\nthe biggest questions i get asked is\njust like\njay my parents don't believe in me or\nlike my friends don't believe me or they\ndon't think it's possible for me\nyeah and and sometimes what that does is\nit blocks the love too\noh right you know what i mean like it's\nlike we also don't see the love so how\nare you\ni'm just intrigued how are you yeah and\ni'd love for you to think about it\nbecause\ni think it's fascinating because when i\nhear you talk about it there's no\nbitterness\nthere's no resentment there's no like\nthere's nothing i also i think i was\ni have blinders on when it comes to my\ngoals and my like you there's nothing\nyou could say that deterred me from\nmy goal and by the way that that's like\nthe six-year-old eva that's\nthat's 20 year old eva that's 44 year\nold eva like\nyou can tell me it was a really bad idea\nlike here are the risks\nhere's the pros here's the cons and i\nwould still do what i want to do\nso i don't know if you're born with that\nyeah um so and i didn't\nsee their judgment as negative i thought\nthey were being silly and funny and\nmaking fun of me\nand that comes from love right like oh\nyou know there's so much um you only\nmess with the people you love the most\nlike that's who you can really joke with\nand i that's how i read it for my family\nwas they're like you really you're gonna\nbe in a pageant\nreally you won okay okay and i was like\ni have a picture\ni have a picture to prove it and i\ndidn't invite any of my family to the\npageant so\nthey kind of didn't believe that it\nhappened because i didn't invite anybody\nthey were like okay i think that\nhappened and he was head\nso they don't know till this day whether\nit actually happened well no you paid\nfor college\ni i was in college and i had pictures\nyeah\nthat you remember you had to develop\nthem back then you know i developed the\npictures\nhow much fun are you having with grand\nhotel right now it's fun\nit's so fun you know we've wrapped so\nlong ago so i'm a little removed for it\nbut what\nwhat i was doing was uh when i was\ndirecting ground hotel i had\nwell first we shot the pilot ground\nhotel and i was eight months pregnant\nand we shot in miami and i was running\naround and i was like\nokay we gotta do this we gotta do this\nand and that was so much fun because i\nfelt like i had two babies i had\nyou know santi in my stomach and this\npilot that we were hoping would get\npicked up by abc and then we get picked\nup and santi's born\nand i'm directing the first one and\ni'm breastfeeding santi's seven weeks\nold i'm getting three hours of sleep\nand i was like how am i gonna do this i\ndon't even know how to do this\nand i was just breastfeeding him on set\ni have i have a thousand videos of me\nsaying\nand action and he's i'm breastfeeding um\nso many pictures and he's just i'm like\nhere we go i mean\nwe're going to do it so i view grand\nhotel as\nuh you know a parallel universe with\nwith santi\nbecause they just happened at the same\ntime and\nthey were they were both so hard to get\noff the ground\nsanti and grand o'dell at the same time\nand so i yeah i think grand hotel is one\nof the most special projects that one in\ndora cause same thing dora i was\nshooting dora when santi was\ntiny and so those two projects will\nalways be so special to me because\nthey're they're in in encompassed and\nsandy yeah but this\nthis seems like like a theme in your\nlife like you you never\ndo the easy route i know yeah you never\ndo like the one\nthing like most people are like if\nyou're gonna have a kid one year like\njust have a kid right yeah i hear that\nwe don't have kids yet but yeah\nwe hear that all the time but yeah you\nwere you know you said dora yeah dora of\ncourse congratulations\nthank you it's been amazing seeing\neveryone so dora you've got grand hotel\nand you're having santee right at the\nsame time and then when you were\ntrying to become an actress you're also\nhead-hunting at this point oh my gosh\nlike\nyou're doing that and you're juggling at\nthis yeah let me tell you where all of\nthat comes from\nand i'll tell you the heading story but\nlike my mom raised four girls\none with special needs my oldest sister\nis mentally disabled\num worked a full-time job she became a\nspecial education teacher\num took care of our family took care of\nher sister who\num you know was also you know both of\nher sisters were older and so\nlike she was just a caretaker for the\nwhole family and had dinner on the table\nevery day at six o'clock\nthat she made from scratch so i always\nlook at my mom\nas like how did she do that we went to\nfour different schools she was a human\ntaxi she dropped one off pick one up\ni was in cheerleading my sister was in\nband my other sister was in flag core\num lisa's getting her therapies then and\nshe\nnever i don't remember a day my mom was\nsick i don't remember her getting a cold\na flu a cough\ni sneezed i'd she just did it and she\nendured\nand she she didn't only like survive she\nthrived like she was like\ndid it and so i look at my life and i go\noh my god i'm not doing enough\nlike my mom did like my mom did way more\nand did it\nhappily and with a smile and um so yeah\nthat's where i think the work ethic\ncomes from\num but when i moved to hollywood i was\nlike i had my degree and i was like i'm\nnot going to wait tables not that\nanything's wrong with that but i was\njust like i have a degree so i went to a\ntemp agency to get a temp\njob because i was like i'm an actor\n[Laughter]\ni'm an actor i can't really work too\nmuch and um\nthey hired me and they were like oh you\nshould work\nhere and i was like oh what's what's\nhere and they said oh it's um\nyou know matchmaking there's jobs and\npeople and you put them together and i\nwas like oh okay\nso not people and people match me yeah\nno not people people\njobs and people and i was good at it\ni mean i was i was just like this is\nlike my calling\nand i was doing so well that i paid off\nmy\nmy college debt my student debt my i\nmean my\ncredit card debt my student debt uh i i\ngot a car\ni had an apartment i got my head shots i\ntook acting classes like\nit really i i just it was like a dream\njob for me because it still allowed me\nto pursue acting\nand and financially support that dream\nand i remember the first big break i got\nwas on young and the restless and\ni was like oh my gosh i got this part\nand it was paying a tenth\nof what i was making yeah as a\nheadhunter i was like oh i can't\ni can't live on that like that i have\nnow all of these things i\nhave to pay for so i continued to be a\nheadhunter while i was young\nyoung and the restless for three years\nby the way wow the whole time i was in\nyoung and the restless i had to\nkeep my other job because they didn't\npay me enough and i did it out of my\ndressing room so i'd be on the phone and\ni'd be like\num yes i'm negotiating this salary and\nthen they're like ready on set i'm like\nokay i have to run i have another\nmeeting\nand you're learning lines too at the\nsame time learning lines\ngetting hair and makeup doing publicity\nlike it was\nit was fun i'm you know when you're\nyoung like that you have all the energy\nin the world and i mean i still do it\nyeah but now now i get eight hours of\nsleep though like i actually budgeted\nback then i could roll out of bed from\nthe club and be like here we go let's go\nyeah yeah\nnow that cannot if i drink today already\nyeah it's like four days later i'll\nrecover from drinking\ni love that no it's so true so true and\nyou've reminded me of my mom too like\nwhen you were swimming by your mother i\ni feel exactly the same way you know my\nmother was always there\nbut running her own business growing up\nwhen i was growing up taking care of me\nand my sister\nevery sporting activity or art activity\nor whatever it was\nalways supportive helping with homework\nyes my mom too homework yeah homework\nlike helping with school\nlike or just and yeah she did it so like\neffortlessly almost\nit felt that way well it felt like that\nto me to us yes it wasn't\nyeah it wasn't but she made it feel like\nthat she never made it feel like a\nburden\nor never made it feel like it was our\nfault or whatever it was\nand i can relate to that but you have\nthis real ability and i i\nit's your super power like you're able\nto continuously\nwe just talked about head hunting and\nacting like making both happen at the\nsame time\nyou're talking about even then with\ndesperate housewives and doing a month\nlike a master's degree\nyeah yeah my master's during disneyland\nwhich i i\nguess looking back i'm like not so much\na good idea yeah\nbecause getting your masters is\nall-encompassing\nmentally like you have to really dive\ndeep into\num the purpose of that like why are you\ndoing this and and\ni was um i come from a family of\neducators so like all my sisters went to\ncollege my mom my\nmy aunts were teachers like um so\ni was the last person in my family to\nget a master's degree like that's\ncrazy you know like what how many\nfamilies can say that and i knew i was\nvery blessed\nwith the idea that education was\nimportant and also\nhearing the word university university\nuniversity in my household so many kids\ntoday don't i don't even hear that word\nin their household so i was really lucky\num so it was something harping at me\nbecause i was supposed to always get my\nmasters and then\ni took a left turn and went to hollywood\nand then\nas um i was on set uh\ndesperate it was the number one show in\nthe world and my mom was like\nright but when are you gonna get your\nmasters like she was like\neven then even though yeah i'm like mom\nmom we're like number one in china right\nnow\nokay do you know what that means she's\nlike um yeah doesn't mean anything\num and so and also what was happening\nwhich was\na ironic because it's still happening\nwas this border issue this immigration\nissue\nand it was such a hot topic in that\nmoment and continues to be that i wanted\nto\ndive deeper into the history of\nimmigration of our country because\ni hate misinformation i don't like\nmisinformation it's one thing my grandma\ntaught me you never hate something\nshe's like don't say that word i would\nbe like i hate orange juice she goes you\ncannot hate orange juice you cannot like\norange juice but you do not hate\nanything i know i'm always that's why\nwhen i hear it i'm like that's the one\nword\nlike no curse word you can curse all you\nwant but when somebody goes i\nhate milk or what i hate anything i'm\nlike\noh don't say that word um so anyway i um\ni don't like the amount of\nmisinformation in the world so i was\nlike you know what i don't even know\nthis information let me go get it so i\ntook one class\nabout chicano 101 which was you know\nchicano's a\npoliticized word in the civil rights\nmovement the chicano civil rights\nmovement\nthat really is about the\nmexican-american specifically\nmexican-american journey in the united\nstates and so the history because\nmany of us didn't cross the border the\nborder crossed us and so we are rooted\nin this\ncountry in this in this tierra in this\nworld and this earth and this\nwhatever you know border\nthat is put up we're still part of this\nland and so\num understanding that history and\num i took one class and then uh i took\nanother class and then i took the third\nclass and finally the\nuniversity was like you know you have to\nenroll eventually\nand i was like okay so then i i enrolled\nbut like\ni didn't think about it other than i\njust want to take more classes i want to\nlearn and i was devouring it but once\nyou enroll\nuh there is a timeline you have to\nfinish and you have to take these\ncertain classes by a certain time and\nthen you have to do your thesis and then\nyour thesis has to be argued and then i\nwas like\noh what did i do and i never told\nanybody i was doing it by the way and it\ngot out that i was doing it uh and that\nput more pressure on me to finish\nbecause i was like even if i don't\nfinish at least i took more classes and\nonce it got out to the press\nand people kept talking about like\nthat's so great that's so great we are\nmy\nour community needs you i was like oh i\nnow i have to finish\num and so that's why i got my masters\nand then ended up\nwriting my thesis which uh was\nis the basis of my foundation which is\nmy life's work and so\ni remember had a great mentor at the\ntime um henry cisneros and\num there's 20 people like in your cohort\nin your class\nand 19 of them were doing immigration\nthesis like from different points of\nview\ndifferent entry points you know\neverything anything you can think of\num and i was like yeah i want to do my\nthesis on immigration and\nand my mentor goes but is that going to\nbe your life's\nwork like what is going to be your\nlife's work your thesis and your masters\nis diving deep into one thing and things\ncan branch off of that like oh\nbecause you know social issues are all\nconnected um\nbut he's like but what are you going to\nbe an expert at and i said\ni don't well i really am interested in\neducation because my family\ncomes from educators and i'm i want to\nhelp more latinos\num attain higher education even finish\nhigh school right like finish high\nschool and then\nbe able to to go further and so he's\nlike\nthat's what your thesis needs to be on\nso if it's education what about\neducation who do you want to help and i\nsaid well i want to help women\ni know that young girls he goes great\nand what where do you want to help like\nhe made me\ndrill down specifically what but how are\nyou going to help and why are you going\nto help\nand so uh i said well you know i feel\nlike\nthere's not enough latinas in stem\nfields you know science technology\nengineering\nand math and when we don't have a seat\nat the table with these industries\ninnovation doesn't service our\ncommunities correct so\num i was like okay let me help\nfacilitate that so my thesis was\nspecifically on um\nlatinas in stem fields and how diversity\ncreates innovation\nfor anything whether you're a researcher\nor a teacher\nwhatever you know or scientist or an\nengineer i mean\nsolutions come from people's experiences\nand so we need more experiences to\ninnovate\nworld problems you know to solve world\nproblems yeah what an amazing mentor\ni know like he's able to just really\npush you there rather than just\nyeah that's great but everybody's doing\nimmigration yeah yeah yeah\nwow and and good feet that's why i did\nthat\ni know i never do things easy\nit's beautiful we need you like we need\nthe strength and the toughness\ni think what it shows me is just what it\nshows me and shows so many people today\ni think so many of us get lost in the\nexcuse of like\nwell i can't chase my passion if i'm\ndoing this or i can't do this if it's\nmeaningful to me because i have a day\njob well i can't\nyou know and i'm not saying that\neveryone should do everything but what i\nam saying is that\nyou're showing us through your own\nbehavior and action and choices\nthat if you put your mind to it yeah you\ncan do multiple things that are actually\nvery different\ni think also what we don't realize is we\nwaste more time in the day than you\nrealize\nyes right and so like i'm i'm\nsometimes on instagram but i really look\nat the screen time\nand i give myself like this is the time\neva you can look at instagram like\nmy entire day is mapped out because i'm\njust an efficient person if i'm in the\ncar i'm doing a conference call or i'm\nlistening to a podcast if i'm on a plane\ni'm reading a script i'm reading a book\ni'm watching a tv show that i have to\nwatch for research\nlike if i'm um you know bathing santee\ni am face timing with grandma because\ngrandma's gonna this is your time\ngrandma with santa it's like\nit's just like what can i do and i\nremember also when i was\non desperate outsides i learned french\nand\nit was come on i did learn\ni learned french and spanish because i\ndidn't grow up speaking spanish but\nfrench was my first\num uh my second language and then my\nthird language was was spanish but\num through these tapes and so if i was\nworking out i was listening to the tapes\nif i was driving i was listening to\nthese tapes and then i would go to class\nand i would\nbuy the books and for french and um and\ni remember\nmy castmate going i can't believe you\nknow when we finished housewife she goes\nyou've learned two languages and got a\nmaster's degree she goes\nand she was like and i just i just\nendured\nbut because there was so much down time\non set there was so much i was in my\ntrailer for an hour and i felt like i\nwasn't reaching\nmy full potential as a human being like\ni was having fun on the show\ndon't get me wrong and i was really\ngrateful for like i'm on this amazing\nshow and i'm having and i\ntook acting very seriously but like\nthere's so much down time\nand off days that i was like i gotta\nfill this with something else\namazing yeah that is awesome i love that\ni love that now all of us everyone\nlistening and watching me included i'm\nlike no excuses there's more\nyou waste more time than you think and i\nlike i said i also scheduled my sleep so\nlike\ni go to the gym at six a.m so yeah i\nhave to be in bed by ten if i'm in bed\nby ten that means dinner's at seven if i\nhave a dinner like\nand i just like schedule things like\nthat and by the way\nthere's monkey wrenches like all right\nthis dinner went late i'm going to be\ntired tomorrow\nbut it's not my lifestyle you know what\ni mean yeah it's the exception not the\nright it's the exception of the role or\nwhen people go i don't know time to work\nout i was like yeah you actually do you\nprobably do\nand i think that's part of it we need\nrules to have exceptions from\notherwise everything's the exception\nyeah right like otherwise everything's\nall over the place and there's\nrules i can agree with you more tell me\nabout\nuh how you've seen the latino experience\nin hollywood like for someone who's not\nfamiliar with that\nwhat is that like um if you want to go\nthere no no it's a big\ntopic um there was a study that just\ncame out yesterday um\nfrom usc um stacy smith at usc\num talking about not only are we\nseverely underrepresented in hollywood\nbut the erasure of latinos in film\nis creating the um\nproblems we're having in society\ninteresting like it\ndefinitely is correlated um you know if\nyou only see\ngangbangers drug dealers and you know um\ncriminals\nin tv and film then that educates a\ncommunity\nabout who we are it educates people who\ndon't have a latino in their town\nto go oh that's what they are um and i\nthink\nmore important than that is it educates\nour community on who we\nare and so if i'm a young latino and\nonly see\nthose portrayals it's damaging\nand so you can't be what you can't see\nand and i think that um\nthere has to be conscious change\nto happen so i feel like sometimes\npeople go oh this is an unconscious bias\nlike like people just go to the\nto the well they always go to you know\nwhite male\ntalent um you know and so who's left out\nof that is women people of color\nlgbtqa i mean all of this and so you\nhave to understand there's different\nthere's different talent pools um\nawaiting\nuh uh usage and so\nhopefully i think we're facing the right\ndirection now i don't know if we've\ntaken a step\nright but you at least feel like yeah\nwe're like we're like this and now we're\nlike\noh okay there it is let's go you know um\nand then you know same thing happened\nyou know going back to grand hotel\nwhen i was finally in a position of\npower to hire um\nas a producer as executive producer and\na director\nit was our job to staff up the\ndirector's slots so we had 13 open\nslots and what we did was\nprimarily hire women for women first\nlet's fill the slots with women and once\nwe ran out of\nthat talent pool we said great now the\nrest of the thoughts people of color\ngreat and then once those filled up then\nthe remaining slots were\num your usual white male directors and\nwe did that\npurposely and so um same thing with\ndirector of photography\ni took these traditional um\njobs i took these jobs\ni looked at these jobs that were\ntraditionally held by men\nand i asked for women like i was just\nlike you know director of photography\ncinematographer is mostly male and i\nsaid\num are there any women and they go oh\nyeah yeah yeah and then they sent me\nsome female names\ni ended up hiring a female director of\nphotography alison kelly\nand she ends up hiring women in her\ndepartment\nright so then it like trickles down um\nthen we hired two female assistant\ndirectors and they\nend up hiring female pas and that and it\njust there's a great trickle-down effect\nthere was um we needed a stunt\ncoordinator because we had a big stunt\nto do\nand they're like here's tom dick and\nharry and i was like right are there any\nfemale stunt corners like there must be\nfemale\nstunt quarters they go oh yeah there are\nand of course they send me the names and\ni go\ngreat her helena so we had a female\nstunt where like we really filled these\nnon-traditional roles\num jobs that are held by men um with\nwomen\nand oh it works right like oh and\nthey're just a talented\nand they're just as creative so it's the\nsame with latinos in hollywood so\ninstead of\nunconsciously ignoring us you should\nconsciously hire us\nright in front of him behind the camera\nyeah absolutely and\nand i think that's amazing i think it's\nso amazing to see how\nintentional and focused and strategic\nyou've been about representation\nmattering yeah because it's almost like\nit feels like if you don't do that\nthen it kind of just doesn't happen\nwon't it won't yeah because it's like\ni'm not doing if you don't take it\nanymore why wouldn't you know john smith\ndo it yeah absolutely not it's this is\nmy community actually\nand like you said i don't do it to be a\nhero i\ni do it because i don't like you said\nwhen you open the podcast\nyou have to be very careful about\nspeaking for people i speak for women i\nspeak for you know it's like no no i\ndon't speak for latinos what i do\nis teach and inspire them to speak up\nfor themselves\nand the way we can do that in hollywood\nis by hiring them\nwhether you're a storyteller or a grip\nor\na lighting person or an actor or writer\num\nyou tell that story you tell your story\num so i'm not\nyou know trying to go oh listen to me\nthis is what we gotta do it's\nit's you know no go do what you want to\ndo and you can do it\nyeah i give you permission right like\nsometimes people just want permission to\nbe great yeah absolutely yeah that's\namazing was it hard for you to transfer\nover from\nbeing an actor to then production and\ndirection or\nhave you enjoyed that and love that no\nbecause i'm very bossy\ni like telling people what i can tell\nwhen they start no one saw it but before\nthis podcast started\ni thought i was about to get schooled i\nwas getting all sorts of directions\nyeah i'm like i'm gonna sit there you\nsit there i'm gonna have the better\nlight\ni love it i love it literally um no it\nwas\num i feel like you know people go oh\nshe's an actor turned director\ni feel like i was always a director\nproducer\nturned actor because i've been\nfascinated by the business side\nand the the assembly of a project and\nalso again i remember being on set\nin desperate housewives and going to my\nmark and saying my lines and then you go\nhome\nyou don't get to pick your co-star you\ndon't get to say you get to write the\nthings that are coming out of your mouth\nyou don't get to pick the music that's\ngoing to lay over this you don't get to\npick\num what you're wearing you don't get\nlike there's actors have the least\namount of control\nin in the whole process of filmmaking\nand movie making and tv making\num and so i just go i i want to have\nmore control\nof my destiny of my career and\nof the final product that is being put\nout there and\nthat's why i chose to get behind the\ncamera because i was like no no i want\nto make the decisions\ni think that's so important no i think\nit's great i think we should celebrate\nthat\nit's awesome i couldn't agree with you\nmore like i i think for so much talent\nto continue saying the words that they\nhaven't written\nand to be like what you're saying\ndefining an experience\nyeah yeah i want to i want to define my\nown experience yeah yeah absolutely and\nexperience\nthe viewers too yeah yeah absolutely no\ni can relate a lot to that i've been\ni'm planning my my tour at the moment\nfor me to go and visit\nall the cities in which i have a\nwonderful community\nand go meet everyone and for me it's\nvery much about defining an experience i\nwas like i don't just want to stand on a\nstage and\nspeak on any stage it's like i want to\ndesign an experience\nyeah so that people know that they've\ncome to a place that embodies everything\nthat i believe in\nand value well and speaking of this\npodcast like on purpose so i remember\none of the things i learned from oprah\num and i'm not name dropping because i\ndidn't meet her i just sang from her\nshow\nthere she is yeah um was when she used\nto do her\ndaily show i was like how do they fill\nup 365 days a year of like you know\nbooking people\nand booking you know talk\npsychologist whatever the picking the\nthe themes and picking the topic of the\nshow and\nand she said i produce with purpose\nso every show has to deliver something\nwhy am i producing this\nthis particular episode and i have\ncarried that with me in everything that\ni do like what is the point\nand so i'll get pitched things of like\noh it's like a like\nempire but latino i go right okay but\nand then what yeah great like i've\nturned down so many things that i go\nthat's going to be\npeople are going to watch that i just\ndon't know what the point is like what's\nthe purpose\nfor you yeah for me exactly it might\nserve as something\nin your life but it's not servicing my\ngoals of whatever that is right and so\num producing with purpose has been the\nmantra of my\nproduction company and that's probably\nwhy i produce so many documentaries is\nbecause\nhumanizing social issues is the best way\nto\neducate somebody about it and um and so\nmy agents\nto to my agents of grin because they're\njust like documentaries don't make\nmovies um don't make money eva document\nstop making documentaries they make no\nmoney and i'm like but that's not my\npurpose\nyeah if that was my purpose i wouldn't\ndo them but my purpose for the\ndocumentaries\nis a different yeah different point i\nlove that i love that and i think that's\nso important that applies to everything\nlike not just movies or shows it's like\nyou could apply that to everything in\nour lives like why are we sitting down\nwith anyone or\nevery meeting or friend we allow into\nour space\nor just really reflecting going what is\nthe purpose of this interaction\nconversation\ndeal whatever it may be yeah absolutely\nand being able to do that\nyeah anyone who's listening and watching\ni highly encourage you to do that with\nyour with your work with your\nrelationships with every area yeah and\nif you can't answer the question then\nyou can look for an answer and if you\ncan't find the answer then\nthen that is your answer and i think you\nknow like i'm doing now in my life is\nis taking an emotional inventory and\ngoing\nokay what's this servicing nothing out\nyou know\nokay what is it like just doing the\nspring cleaning of your\num emotions and so i always love that\nyou know\nidea of like oh let's take an emotional\ninventory my husband and i will do it\ntogether\nyeah where are we at what are we doing\nokay here we go all right that's\nthis is wasting our time and not really\num fulfilling us in any way so\nout not doing that anymore um even with\nlike you know\nsilly things like like um not only\nprojects\nand people um you know whether it's\nproperty like we you know we had this\nhouse in miami we're like we don't go\nwhy do we have that like\nand you don't realize it because\nsometimes there's a different part of\nyour life that is about attainment i'm\ngonna i'm gonna attain as much as i can\nwhether it's money whether it's houses\nwhether it's cars whether\nand lately my husband and i just looked\nat our life and go\nwhoa what what is the purpose of\nthis many things yeah okay let's we\ngotta\nwe don't need that we don't need that we\ndon't need that and\nand i think that's um important to do\nfrom time to time yeah i agree before i\nbecame a monk i did that in a tiny way\nbecause i gave away a lot of my best\nclothes to my friends one of them so i\ngave away all these like\nfootball jerseys or soccer jerseys that\ni had that i'd collected i love soccer\nso\ni had all these jerseys and i was giving\nthem away and then when i came back from\nbeing a monk i was like yeah\ni might take that i did that recently\nwith\num i never thought i'd lose the\npregnancy weight because i got so big\nthat i just\nresigned myself to like well this is the\nnew normal\nand i gave away so many clothes i was\nlike jeans out tight\nanything tight out out out and now i did\nlose the weight and i'm like\ncan i can i have that dress back and you\ncan't no\ni don't know my friend's name no my\nstuff no and i'll see my friend wearing\nit and i go i love that dress and she\ngoes\nyou gave it to me and i go oh okay yeah\ni love that yeah i auctioned off this\nsoccer ball that was signed by all the\nplayers\nof manchester united and i i auctioned\nit off for charity before i became a\nmonk to give it away\nis that your team yeah that's my team\nyeah is that what david played yes\nyeah yeah yeah yeah i mean what's the\nopposite of\nmanchester city okay yeah we don't like\nit yeah so no cause did you see the\nprank that gordon\njames gordon did on him and the guy's\nlike hey you and manchester city man\nand that was like no you you got the\nteam wrong that's when they got things\nstatue yeah oh my god that statue was\nhilarious\nbut the funniest thing was like he keeps\nyou gotta keep confusing\nthe the teams yeah that was so bad yeah\nmanchester city is like\nmanchester united's arch enemy and now\nthey're really good oh are they good\nyeah they're good now\nso where did tyrion replay arsenal\narsenal yeah\nhe was at arsenal and then barcelona\nwhere did zedan play he played well now\nhe's the manager of real madrid\nand he's played real madrid he also\nplayed at juventus i believe he also\nplayed in barcelona\njuventus yeah oh interesting i it's\nfunny story\nthis is like you can edit this out but\num uh\ni got this invitation to host the the\nfifa awards in zurich no way so i'm\nreading i'm in bed and i'm\nreading this and i go f-i-f-a honey they\nwant me to host\nsome fight fifa fifa thing and he goes\nwhat\nand i got the awards i don't know i\ndon't know all these people and he goes\nyou have to do it because my husband's a\nhuge soccer fan he's like you have to do\nwe have to do we have to go it'll be so\namazing\ni was like all right so i said yes and i\nhave to i had to interview all these\nplayers i had interviewed maradona\ni had interviewed ronaldo i had\ninterview all these play and i didn't\nknow who and even more\nthanks messi thanks eva thanks man yeah\ni'm really in love with you right now\nyeah\nyeah and and then last minute last\nminute my husband couldn't go\nand i had to go by myself i go well i\ndon't want to go like i didn't want to\ngo to the thing in the first place\nyou're the one that made me say yes and\nnow you're not coming he\nlast minute he could not go out of\nbusiness so i'm there going\nhoney okay so messy play is from spain\nand he goes no no\nhe is not from spain and if you say that\nthey're gonna throw a rock at you and i\nwas like but i thought you said he\nplayed in spain he goes no he plays in\nspain\nhe's not from spain they're very serious\nand i was like all right so maradona's\nfrom spain\nnobody said no no he's not from spain no\nhe was getting strong he made me a\npowerpoint presentation oh my\noh that's good so i could interview\nand then i was like oh when

like\ncristiano's from brazil right and he\ngoes no and i go he speaks portuguese\nand he goes hey he's from particular\nlike oh my god it's a think of music too\nconfusing\nanyway yeah i ended up doing it but not\nnot happy\nvery cool yeah very cool not happy about\nit no no not jealous at all yeah\nyou would have loved it i love that yes\ndo you want us to keep that in yeah i\nloved it it was great\nit was great but but no but uh where are\nwe\nnobody cares uh yeah no that's no way\ni think i think the awesome thing is\nthat no there's no lesson in that that's\njust no there's no lessons no lesson in\nthat that was me\njust being very excited that i know as\nyou call it soccer\ni i do when i'm here just so that\neveryone knows what i'm talking about\nbecause if i say\ni can't call it real football then\nanyone gets i know i know but have you\nbeen to the los angeles\ni have i've been watching so good i've\nbeen to the la galaxy stadium\ni what's the difference by the way\nbecause so there's lafc and la galaxy\nthey're the two teams in l.a\noh they're both mls they're both mls oh\ni didn't know that okay\ndid not yeah yeah they're both yeah i\nmean why would i know that yeah why\nwould you know\nyou don't know what chris jenner\nnowadays i just love the food at the\nlafc okay\nyeah great i was secretly hoping you\nwere a football fan but i guess i'm a\ni'm a football fan\noh american american i am a huge nfl fan\nyeah i love\ni love the nfl do you not like it i've\ni've been i'm interested in people in\nthe nfl like players yeah i'm fascinated\nby people\nbut i just didn't grow up on it that's\nwhat it is yeah i watch it but i didn't\ngrow i think when you grow up on\nsomething oh yeah and i'm from texas so\ntexas is a football state\ni think that's nice when you grow up on\nsomething it has a huge so i even\nwatched a lot of basketball growing up\nso i love basketball yeah i actually\nlove basketball\nbut football soccer is my main sport but\nanyway\ni was going to ask you with santi what\nis there i asked you earlier what you'd\nlearned\nfrom him and and since having him\nwhat are you trying to teach and what\nwould you like him to take on\nwhen i where the most important things\nyeah and how you're doing it\ni read a book when i was pregnant\nit's amazing how many how how this you\nshould write a book about this because\nthere's not a lot of books on it uh\ncause i was looking for it but i\ni wanted to when i was pregnant i wanted\nto know what was spiritually happening\nso\nthere's so many books of like today he\nhas fingernails this week his brain is\ndeveloping eat a lot of salmon this\nmonth\nthis is happening and i was like what is\nspiritually happening\nin my belly and my friend deepak um\ndeepak gave me his book and he said\num read this book and it was the\nspirituality and miracle of pregnancy\nand it was basically that of\nlike even in the book he said you know\ndon't\ndon't watch the anything that\nupsets you even if it's fake like a\nscary movie yes\nor something because he's like the baby\ndoesn't know that feeling\nis manufactured you just go oh you get\nscared or whatever and\nand you know same thing with like trying\nnot to be stressed or anything just\nhow everything channels into the baby\nand all of that stuff but there was\nliterally one\nit was like his book and that was it and\nthey said no there has to be more like\ndoes the heart create before\nthe mind i mean the brain like\nphysically so that's why like we do lead\nwith our heart like i wanted to know so\nmany interesting\nanswers um anyway uh and so in the book\nhe said you know every night when you\nrub your cream on or whatever do a\nmantra with what you wish\nfor your child and my wish for him was\nkindness and compassion\nplease let him be i mean health of\ncourse like that was like a given i was\nlike okay\ni hope he's healthy but the thing i want\nto impart\nmost on on him is to be i hope he's a\nkind\nand compassionate human being you know\nand and mindful\ni think a lot of things hang off the\ntree of mindfulness\nso you know sometimes you can have a\ngullible compassionate person\nbut if you're mindful i feel like\nthere's a level of\ncompassion and intelligence to be\ndeciphering good situations bad\nsituations what takes your time what\nshouldn't take your time and so\nmindfulness was a big one yeah those are\nbeautiful i love that\nand it's so true yeah the vedic terms\nand i know deepak well as well he's a\ngood friend\nthe samskaras that children have are all\nthe way from conception through\nas they get older and so the\nthe qualities and the values we want\nthem to embody and meditating on those\nand then the qualities when they come in\nso i think that's beautiful what a\nbeautiful meditation too\nand i love what you said there it's not\njust about being kind and compassionate\nand gullible\nyeah but being focused intentional\nmindful being able to process that\nyeah it's amazing yeah absolutely yeah\nabsolutely it's amazing and and one\nthing i read about you which i thought\nwas\nunbelievable which i have to say and\nyou're going to hate me for saying it\nbut i'm going to say it anyway\nis hollywood reporter named you the\nphilanthropist of the year\nwhich i thought was amazing and that's\nbeautiful thank you to have come\nhere to have paved your own path to have\nworked so hard\nand for this space and community and\nworld to recognize that\nyeah and that must have felt incredible\nno it wasn't and at the same time given\nyou an opportunity to\nuse that platform to do more incredible\nwork tell us about that yeah\num so so much so much that meant a lot\nto me\nbecause you know i grew up with a\nspecial needs sister so my oldest sister\nlisa has a mental disability she was\nborn at like seven months so didn't get\nenough oxygen to her brain so she has\nlike about\na third grade level for her life like\nyou know her reading her her\ncomprehension and so\nbecause of that i was born into her\nworld and when we were young\num we would use so many community\nservices\nwhether it was um boys and girls club or\nsalvation army um we would always go\nuh a special olympics there were so many\norganizations that helped\nmy sister and our family that i never\nforgot like i was like who are these\npeople helping us they don't even know\nus\nand my mom would always say charity and\ni thought charity was a person like i\nwas like\nyou know charities um and we used to\nhave to volunteer\nthat was the greatest lesson i think my\nmom taught us very early was\nvolunteerism\nand so she was like we're gonna go\nvolunteer at the soup kitchen we're\ngoing to volunteer at the boys and girls\nclub we're going to volunteer special\nolympics\ni thought it was a job like i was like i\nwant to be a volunteer when i grew up\num and how beautiful yeah it was because\nat my\nearliest childhood memories all revolve\naround special olympics\num because my sister was in it so we had\nto go and volunteer because my mom's\nlike we're all going let's go get in the\ncar you're volunteering lisa's competing\nand i remember my my first job was a\nhugger like\nthat's a job at the special olympics and\nyou hug\nthe athletes at the end of their race at\nthe end of their competition\nand wow the healing of\nthat gesture of a hug\num to a stranger um was\nreally something that has stuck with me\nand i remember i must have been maybe\nfive like the fact that i remember that\nand i always wanted to go back and be a\nhugger\num so just that lesson of like giving\nback\nvolunteering community uh\nwas ingrained in the dna of who me and\nall my sisters are\nso regardless of being famous i knew\nthat was my destiny and my role and my\nresponsibility\nand then the fact that i became famous\nand had this platform\nto talk about and shine a light and give\na voice and all of that stuff was\nreally just a natural evolution because\ni was doing it anyway\nyes um so i was really grateful for the\nmicrophone that i ended up\nreceiving so i could do more of what i\nwas already doing what my family\nhas always been doing and and so yeah\npeople a lot of times want to go\nno like when what got you philanthropic\ni'm like oh god no that's\nsince i was a kid yeah and the other\nthing that\nuh that i do uh i manifest\na lot of things and i remember moving\nhere in 1998\nand walking in hollywood boulevard i\nwanted to live in hollywood because when\ni wrote home\ni wanted the address on the envelope to\nsay hollywood california\nnot knowing hollywood was like really\nghettoey at that time now it's like chic\ni'm not sure yeah um but\ni i was walking to holly boulevard and i\nwas looking at all the stars\non the walk of fame and i said one day\ni'm gonna have a star here i'm gonna\nhave a start and i pick the spot\nand it's just gonna be right here and\nthis empty this is an empty one i'm\ngonna it's gonna be right here\nand 20 years to the day i got my star on\nthe walk of fame\nprobably five feet from where i\nno said that you don't get to pick no\nyou don't get to pick yeah you don't get\na picture you don't get to pick they go\nand it was five feet away from me\nfrom where i stood on the corner of la\nbrea and hollywood\nand i was like it's gonna be right here\nand mine you know mine's like five feet\nfrom where i said\nand so that's something i i believe in\nbut it's also more than that like you\nknow people go i'm gonna be a star okay\nwell you gotta\nput the work in yeah and we've talked\nabout that let's see let's not get in\nthe way\nyeah you know you've done that yeah um\nbut just first visualizing it\nsaying it is really the two biggest\nsteps and i think for women too\nyou know there's not a lot of female\ndirectors there's not a lot of female\nfemales behind the camera like there\nshould be um\nand a lot of that is because you know we\ndon't want to even say it out loud\nbecause\nthat might be it might be full of myself\nbut i should be a writer\ni should be a director i should say it\nsay it do it give yourself\npermission um because that's the first\nstep then you\nthen you go into your plan of how to how\nto accomplish it but the first step is\njust\nyou know verbalize it verbalize it\nvisualize it and then\nsay it yeah visualize verbalize\nand and yeah i always feel like you have\nto feel it and mean it when you say it\nlike if you're going to believe it you\nhave to feel it and mean it for sure\nbecause\nyeah that's what i think the difference\nis in what you're saying of like yeah\nit's going to happen for me and you know\nit's where it's like no\nthis is it but and then following it up\nand i think that's what i love about\nmanifestation is that\nthe visualization and verbalizing then\nalso backing it up with\nfocused action right yeah focused action\nand\num i always say like\ncurate your day right so like does what\ni'm doing today\nlead to that goal yes when there's so\nmuch you do in the day that is not\nleading to what you\nare trying to manifest and so all of\nthat energy is being burnt up\ntowards something that you don't even\nwant yeah and that's why some people\nwake up in marriages\nthat they never wanted and jobs they\nnever wanted they're like what happened\nbecause you were\nputting so much energy into this thing\nyeah and instead of the other\nyeah that's why i think our intention is\nsuch a strong compass as well because\nif you're not doing it for a deep reason\nyou can get there and actually feel\ndisappointed\nyeah yeah if you're doing it for a deep\nreason you get then realize there's so\nmuch more to do\nand you keep going but otherwise most\npeople if you don't have a deep\nintention you may never get there\nand so then you feel you still keep\nthinking oh there was something there\nyeah\nor you get them then you're disappointed\nand we see that a lot where yeah people\nget the name and the\nfame and the money and the star and\neverything but then you still feel like\noh well\nit didn't add up yeah because it wasn't\nwhat your intention wasn't driven by\nanything else but the other thing i\nlearned about intention\nwhich um was like another aha moment for\nme was\num your actions have to match your\nintentions yes right so you know people\ngo oh i didn't intend to hurt you\nyes that was my intention to hurt your\nfeelings but your actions\ndid hurt me so your actions have to\nmatch your intention\nand and i really use that as another\nmantra to go\nwell my intention is to do this\nwhat action do i have to do towards that\ncorrect\nabsolutely i love that eva you're\namazing oh you're\nawesome thank you for doing this with a\nsore throat\nhaving done so much press you have to do\ncolbert tonight usa conan\nconan sorry conan\nyou're doing conan tonight as well which\nis just insane so\nuh thank you for being here we end every\ninterview with what i call the final\nfive this is the final five rapid fire\nquick fire round so you can only answer\nin one word or one

gonna give you more than one\nsentence to answer because i think\nyou'll answer it beautifully\nuh one thing we can all do today to make\nthe world a better place\nthe one thing the one one practice the\none mantra the one\nhabit that you think the world could\nadopt on a daily basis to make the world\na\nbetter place god\nwhat i'm usually saying is look around\nyou\nthe biggest myth about philanthropy is\nthat you have to be rich and famous to\nmake a difference\nthat is not true if you look at the\nbiggest organizations in the world it\nwas started by an angry mom\na frustrated co-worker\nand you know uh some injustice that\nhappened to somebody\nlike those leaders\nwere inspired to do something bigger\nbecause they experienced something and\nso\ni always say you know look at your\nneighbor see if they have needs\nlook across the street look in your\ncommunity you don't have to cure aids\nyou don't have to solve global warming\nyou don't have to like\nyou know sometimes the world's problems\nfeel so big and you go i'm not going to\nmake a dent so i'm going to drink out of\nthis plastic bottle\nit's like no let's why don't you just do\nthat stop using plastic bottles\nyeah don't use plastic straws like\nthere's so many tiny tiny tiny things\num that do make a difference and i think\nthat goes across\neverything people feel that way about\nour democracy like my vote doesn't count\nthere's so many people it's like no it\ndoes you know me recycling one person\nrecycling doesn't count it does\nyou know me meditating for the world\npraying for the world it's not going to\nmatter it does\nbecause when you have a collective\nmovement of any sort it's going to\nto move mountains and so we do need your\nindividual\num energy and and your individual\nuh
