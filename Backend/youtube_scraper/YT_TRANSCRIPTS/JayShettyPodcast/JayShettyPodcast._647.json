    "transcript": "you realize that it never came from\nanything out there it didn't come from\nthe wardrobe or the facelift or\nsports car or whatever it came from\nwithin you and so you stopped looking\nout there for it and now the love affair\nbegins and you never want to miss a date\nbecause it's just too good\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you\nthat come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow\nnow you know that i love diving into\nreally fascinating discussions with some\nof the most interesting people on the\nplanet\nand today's guest is one that we've had\non before but one of your favorites\nso there's only a couple of guests that\nwe've had on a couple of times\nand today's is going to be a real treat\nwe have the one and only dr\njoe dispenza joe it is such a pleasure\nto have you back\ni i was finally remembering the last\ntime we were together and i have to say\nmy audience\nloved the conversation they got so much\nout of it\nuh the amount that you share every time\nand i\ni'm i'm a fan so i watch you all the\ntime so i listen to all your interviews\nand i always gain something new\nand what i loved about our approach last\ntime\nis you have this unique ability to be\nable to go really deep into the science\nand then bring it back to being really\naccessible and then you add this layer\nof spirituality over it too\nand and i love that kind of blend so so\nthank you for being you\nthank you jay i'm happy to be here yeah\nand you look really well i mean it's\nbeen a\ncrazy year for everyone yeah uh for you\nas well i mean you know you're used to\ndoing so many events\npacked out audiences and of course last\nyear that may have been slightly\naffected and\nwhat's the biggest difficulty or\nchallenge you've had to overcome in the\npast 12 months\ni think first of all i one of the things\nabout the global pandemic that i said to\nmy staff and to my family the moment\ni heard how the circumstances in the\nworld changed\ni just said i refuse to be a victim to\nthese circumstances so\na victim consciousness is when\num we allow something in our outer\nenvironment to control the way we feel\nand think so if i say to you jay\nwhy are you so upset today and you said\noh it's because of this person or\ncircumstance what you're really\nsaying is something in my outer\nenvironment some person or some\ncondition is controlling the way i think\nand feel and that's not the truth\nthat's just a response right so anything\nthat controls\nour thoughts and feelings causes us to\nbe victim to those things\nand the stronger the emotion we feel to\nsome circumstance in our life\nthe more we pay attention to it and\nwhere we place our attention is where we\nplace our energy so\nwe're giving our life force we're giving\nour power away to that circumstance and\nso\ni just made up my mind that it was a\ngreat opportunity to get into the cocoon\nand i don't think i've been healthier in\nmy life i mean i'm usually on six\ndifferent time zones in four weeks\nrunning a lot of events as you said but\nbut i saw it as an opportunity to\nreally self-reflect to really immerse\nmyself into my own personal work\nuh to redo our website to redo our brand\nto connect more with my staff to cook my\nown meals again and\nwork out and and use my body and do my\nwalking meditations on the beach and of\ncourse um\ni've had a fabulous fabulous\nnine months or so uh but i think you\nknow um\ni think one of the challenges i think\nmany people have is really\nthe discernment of information uh it's\nreally difficult\nto know what's the truth anymore just\nbecause\ninformation is so accessible and i used\nto say that in an\nage of information ignorance is a choice\nand and now we have to\nconfront a whole another level and that\nis the information that we're getting\nis it is it actually supporting us or is\nit something that really\nis an incentive to to cause us to make\nchoices so\num for me i think the biggest challenge\nhas been just really an awakening to\nwhat kind of information i want to\nexpose myself to and i and i think it's\nnow more than ever\na challenge for a lot of people in the\nworld yeah i think it's really\ninteresting to hear you say that\ndifference between reacting to our\nexternal changes and uncertainty versus\nresponding we we hear that a lot and\nthen the pandemic comes along\nand everyone feels we all feel we have\nlegitimate reasons\nand true reasons external of us that we\ncan't control\nto feel a different way but i've heard\nyou say before that our thoughts can\nmake us sick\nand that always sticks with me like\nwhenever whenever i think of you saying\nthat that always sticks with me\nwhat are some of the challenging\nthoughts that we've all developed\nin the last 12 months that you think are\naffecting how we feel\nfirst of all every time we have a\nthought we make a chemical and and if\nyou have\nuh an unlimited thought you will feel\nunlimited\nand if you have a self-depreciating\nthought you'll feel unworthy and\nyour brain instantaneously fires\ncircuits\nthat signal another part of the brain to\nrelease peptides or\nchemical messengers that signal hormonal\ncenters and\nwhen we get that arousal from the\nthought that we\nthink those thoughts sometimes\nweaken the response weakens the physical\nbody so\nit turns out that the emotions that are\ncreated from the thoughts\nare the signaling mechanisms of the body\nthoughts of the language of the brain\nand feelings of the language of the body\nand how we think and how we feel\ncreates our state of being so it turns\nout\nthat the thoughts based in the stress\nhormones\nbased in survival those are the thoughts\nthat begin to push the genetic buttons\nthat create disease in other words\na person wakes up in the morning and the\nbrain is a record of the past\nthe first thing they do when they wake\nup in the morning is they start thinking\nabout their problems\nand those problems are memories that are\netched in the brain that are connected\nto certain people\ncertain objects certain things at\ncertain times and places\nso if you believe that your thoughts\nhave something to do with your destiny\nthe moment you think about your problems\nyou're thinking in the past\nright now every one of those problems\nhas an emotion associated with them\nbecause we've experienced them so the\nmoment you remember your problems\nnow you feel unhappy now you feel\nanxious now you feel fear\nso the moment we feel those emotions it\ntakes a thought and a feeling\na memory or an image an emotion a\nstimulus and a response and we start\nconditioning the body emotionally into\nthe past\nnow the body is so objective\nthat it doesn't know the difference\nbetween the real life experience that's\ncreating that emotion\nand the emotion that person is\nfabricating by thought alone the body's\nbelieving it's in that environmental\ncondition\nso if the environment signals the gene\nand that's the truth\nand the end product of an experiences in\nthe environment is an emotion\nwe're signaling the same genes and genes\nmake proteins and\nif you keep signaling the same genes you\nstart down regulating the gene and make\ncheaper proteins and the body begins to\nbreak down now\nthat's an unconscious process so what\ngoes along with that is the moment the\nperson feels that emotion of unhappiness\nor\nwhatever it is uh the brain checks in\nwith the body and says yeah you're\nfeeling pretty miserable you're\nsuffering\nand we tend to generate more thoughts\nequal to the feeling that we have and so\nthen we get caught in this loop of\nthinking and feeling so\nif we can't think greater than how we\nfeel\nour feelings have become the means of\nthinking then we're thinking in the past\nright and so we call that\nthe familiar past and then a person gets\ngoing in the day and they start thinking\noh i gotta see this person i gotta go to\nthat meeting i hate doing this\nand now they get in their routine and a\nhabit is a redundant set of automatic\nunconscious thoughts behaviors and\nemotions that's acquired through\nrepetition\na habit is when you've done something so\nmany times that the body now knows how\nto do it better than the mind\nso now the person running through the\nsame routine every single day\nis on autopilot and their body's now\ndragging them\ninto a predictable future based on what\nthey did in the past and they've lost\ntheir free will\nto a set of programs right so now you\nhave the\nfamiliar past and you have the\npredictable future those are knowns\nso the only place then reasonably where\nthe unknown exists\nis the sweet spot of the generous\npresent moment that\nis when the body and mind are free from\nthose conditions\nso along with those emotions that\ninfluence the same\nthoughts people start becoming more\njudgmental\nthey start becoming more impatient they\nstart becoming more entitled\nthey start getting more afraid more\nanxious more depressed\nand now the body is literally being\ndepleted\nof energy because it's believing that\nit's living in an emergency situation\nand in emergency you tap all the body's\nresources\nfor some threat whether it's real or\nimagined and so then\nwhen you're releasing all of these\nchemicals we are literally drawing the\nbody's life force and turning it into\nchemistry\nand so for the short term that's cool\nbut\nthe arousal that's created from those\nstress hormones\nis a rush of energy and so then people\nuse the problems\nand the conditions in their life to\nreaffirm their\nconditioning or their addiction to that\nemotion and in a sense they become\naddicted to the life they don't even\nlike\nand this is why change is so hard so\nthen\nwhen a person makes up their mind to\nchange and they say okay i'm not going\nto say i can't\ni'm not going to judge another person\ni'm not going to blame i'm not going to\ncomplain i'm not going to make excuses\ni'm not going to be a victim i'm not\ngoing to talk trash about anybody i'm\njust going to stop\nwell that works out really well for the\nfirst couple hours\nand the bodies sing you're out of\nschedule you normally at 8 in the\nmorning you're getting traffic and\nyou're angry then at 11 o'clock you\ncheck your emails and you're really\njudgmental and frustrated\nthe body's saying well you've been doing\nthis for the last 20 years\nyou're just going to stop today so now\nthe body which has been\nconditioned emotionally to be the mind\nwants to return back\nto its familiar territory to the known\nso the body starts influencing the mind\nand it says you know come on this is a\ngood time to judge that\ncome on this is a good time to suffer\nit's your ex's fault it's it's\nyour it's the government's fault it's uh\nyou know it's the weather what the news\nwhatever it is and if we\naccept believe and surrender to that\nthought without analyzing it\nit slips by and it begins to program the\nautonomic nervous system to make those\npharmacy of chemicals\nand so that's when the person makes the\nsame choice\ndoes the same thing creates the same\nexperience\njust for that familiar feeling okay i'll\ncomplain\njust so i can feel suffering then they'd\nrather\nbe unhappy and step into the unknown to\nstep into possibility and the hardest\npart about that process\nfirst of all is not making the same\nchoice as you did\nday before and here's the payoff\nyou got to stay conscious and not go\nunconscious and it turns out that 95\nof the time we're unconscious so if\nyou're going to stay conscious\nthen there's an element that also\nrequires a certain amount of awareness\nor energy\nand you got to step outside of that\nunconscious state so\nthe thoughts that they're thinking are\nslipping by their awareness\nunnoticed because they're hardwired in\ntheir brain because they've been saying\ni can't it's too hard\nmy life will never change it's someone\nelse's fault those thoughts have\nconsequences in the body\nso then if a person then becomes\nconscious\nof those unconscious thoughts becomes\naware of how they speak and how they act\nand they notice\nhow they're feeling they're no longer\nthe program they're the consciousness\noutside the program and that's the first\nstep to change so there are\nwhen you when you're distracted by your\nenvironment and you got your cell phone\nand your tweeting and your\ninstagramming and facebook and whatever\npeople do you're distracted by that\nfeeling\nbut i now know that if you take a person\nand you say okay\nclose your eyes sit in the in the\nsilence\nof any external stimulation remove the\nenvironment\nsit your body down like an animal body\nis the animal tell it to stay\ni'm gonna feed you you can check your\ncell phone you can shower you can have\nyour coffee\nbut when i say and so then here\ncomes the challenge right so and and\nthen\nif you say then you're not gonna live in\nthe familiar future familiar past or\npredictable future you're not going to\nthink about how long you've been\nmeditating what you got to do\nyou you labor uh for that present moment\npeople think when they do this that\nthey're doing something wrong because\nthere's such discomfort that comes with\nit but they're in the unknown they're\nactually doing it right people say\ni think i'm meditating wrong i always\nsay oh no no no you're doing it right\nbecause\nwhen you notice that your body wants to\nget up and check your cell phone or have\na cup of coffee and you become aware\nthat it's on autopilot and wants to do\nthat\nand you say come on over here\nand you return it back to the present\nmoment\nyou're executing a will now that's\ngreater than the program and if the\nperson's\nwants to just get angry while they're\nsitting there there's an arousal\nand they notice the body is amping up\nand revving up\nand they settle it back down now they're\ntelling the body it's no longer the mind\nthat they're the mind now we've\nresearched this\nand it's tedious in the beginning at\nfirst because\ndavid is fighting goliath but if you\nkeep practicing it\njust like training an animal sooner or\nlater the body acquiesces sooner or\nlater the body\nis trained to a new mind and when that\nhappens there's a liberation of energy\nthe body goes from particle to wave from\nmatter to energy and there\ngoes that emotion literally liberated\nfrom the body as energy\nso the person who has the strong emotion\nto some circumstance in their life\nand they're they're working and lowering\nthe volume of that emotion\nthe more they lower the volume that\nemotion the more they're going to take\ntheir attention off that person and\nproblem and they're going to take their\npower back there's going to be a break\nin their attention from that\ncircumstance and now\nthey build their own field and now\nthere's energy to heal\nnow there's energy to create a new life\nnow there's energy for the mystical\nmoment because\nthey've overcome their old personality\nself so\ni think you know it's not like thinking\npositively that's not the message\nit's it's overcoming overcoming\novercoming overcoming until we become\nsomebody else and\nwhen that occurs and the person starts\nthinking differently\nand they start acting differently and\nthey start feeling differently they're a\nnew personality and\nthey they start seeing those\nsynchronicities and serendipities now\ncrossing that river of change\nthe creative process now gets exciting\nbecause what thoughts do you want to\nfire in wire in your brain what kind of\nattention and intention do you want to\nplace so that that becomes the loudest\nvoice in your head\nand if you keep practicing it the\nhardware becomes a software program and\nit'll say jay you can do anything\njay you live in no time and accomplish\neverything\njay you're unlimited you just got to\nhang with it on the other side of this\nis greatness whatever\nyou want to program in there you get the\nprogram in there if you sat down and say\nhow am i going to be with my wife\nmy husband my partner how am i going to\nbe with my kids i'm going to be at work\nwith my co-workers how am i going to be\nin traffic\nand you close your eyes and you begin to\nrehearse in your mind\nif you're truly present the brain does\nnot know the difference between the real\nlife experience and what you're\nimagining\nso now the brain goes from a record of\nthe past to a map to the future now\nyou're installing the hardware keep\npracticing it it becomes automatic comes\neasier now it's a software program\nyou may just start behaving differently\nand then if you said well listen i'm not\ngoing to wait for my healing\nto feel gratitude i'm not going to wait\nfor my new relationship\nto feel love i'm going to actually teach\nmy body emotionally\nwhat that future feels like before it\nhappens now\nthis is a big turnaround for a lot of\npeople because we're so reliant on the\nouter world to change our inner world\nright\nwaiting and perspiring waiting is not\ncreating i mean period\nand when people are they could have the\ngreatest intentions in the world\nbut if they don't combine that with an\nelevated emotion\nthere's no signal because the elevated\nemotion is the carrier it's the energy\nthat carries the thought\nso then when we're in separation in lack\nwaiting for our wealth to feel abundance\nwe're\nbasically living our whole life in pain\nright\nso then if you reason this and a person\ncan get up\nfrom their meditation and they literally\nfeel differently\nand they're feeling the emotions of\ntheir future before it happens this is\nturning\nthe whole process around they can't be\nlooking for\nwhy would they be looking for it if they\nfelt like it there\nit already happened now there's no\nseparation now this is\nwhen those serendipities and\ncoincidences and opportunities begin to\nshow up in people's lives\nso it's work but then when they start\nseeing the experience in their life\nall of a sudden they start believing\nthey're more of the creator of their\nlife\nyeah and less of a victim of their life\nyes absolutely\nso many parts of that i want to unpack\nwith you but what what a beautiful\nanswer\nto you know our reflection on\nthe last 12 months and what we're\ncreating for ourselves there were parts\nof it that i wanted to comment on\none was the idea you mentioned around\nbeing recognizing that the unknown is\nactually the place of growth yeah and\ni think there's so much beauty in that\nwhat you were saying about meditation i\nremember always being trained that we\nthink that\ngetting distracted is taking us away\nfrom meditation\nwhen actually the awareness that you are\ndistracted is meditating right\nthe problem is the thought that comes\nafter like i can't meditate it's too\nhard\nno on the other side of that thought is\nyour healing\nyeah so i say to people when they come\nto our workshops oh\ni'm gonna take you way further than\nwhere you normally stop\nyeah because you're only gonna have two\nchoices yes you're gonna let your energy\ndrop and suffer and go get into\ntime and my body and when's this going\nto end and i'm hungry and those are all\nprimal drives or you're going to apply a\nformula\nand in the unknown you learn how to be\ncomfortable in the unknown and when\npeople this is so funny because\nyou stretch a person outside of the\nknown and it's not scary nothing\nhappened to them and all of a sudden\nthey relax more into the present moment\nthey're not thinking about what's going\nto happen tomorrow they're not going to\nthink about what happened yesterday\nnow we watch 1500 people just by the end\nof an event just\ntotally present yeah it's completely\ndifferent people and\nwhere you place your attention is where\nyou place your energy there's energy for\nthem to heal there's there they have\nenergy they're\nthey're they can execute so it's\nsomething that it's hard to\nyou can only talk around you know i\ndon't you have to experience\nit's like how do you explain a mango to\nsomebody what does it taste like you got\nit you got to experience it so\nso but the cool thing about it i think\nyou know of course speaking from my\npresent state of ignorance but\ni've been watching you know closely you\nknow you can't tell me\nany longer that you're too sick to do\nthis work i i have seen\nin the last couple years blind people\nseeing deaf people hearing people with\nstrokes that were paralyzed moving their\nlimbs\npeople with parkinson's disease that had\ntremors or paralysis moving\nms lupus rheumatoid arthritis rare\ngenetic disorders\ntumors there it is then they're it's\ngone you can't tell me\nyou're too sick to do this work i mean\nof course people\ncome up against themselves and\nwhen they come up against themselves\nthose sick people came up against their\nfear\nlike you're gonna die in three months\nand they had every reason\nto not do the work but they showed up in\nspite of their fear and they\novercame their fear a little bit more\nthere were people that had self-doubt\nand they their their condition was\ngetting worse and their family was\nworried about them\nthey could have doubted and said i i\ngive up but they showed up for\nthemselves again and they overcame their\ndoubt a little bit more\nthere were days that they were really\nfeeling sick\nand their body was really failing and\nthey could have said i'm too sick to do\nthis meditation they did it sometimes\ntwo or three times a day because nothing\nelse was working yeah\nand and they overcame their body they\ncould have said i don't have enough time\ni got kids i got\nobligations i got a job they they showed\nthey made the time to do it and\nthat was the overcoming process you\ncan't you can't tell me that um\nyou're too out of shape you can't tell\nme you know\nyou're too old we have elders in this\nwork i can show you brain scans that are\nso elegant and so beautiful and\nthe arousal that they're having is\necstasy it's coherence in the brain\nso you can't even tell me that you've\nnever meditated before because husbands\nwho get dragged to our events by wives\nwho are sitting there going who is this\nguy\nand they're listening to the science and\nit makes sense\nand it comes down to the practical\nthey're just saying\njust i don't know what i'm just tell me\nwhat they follow the exact\nformula someone who's been meditating\nfor 40 years doing the same thing\nthat's the one that has to get out of\nthat that's yeah habit not to say that\nthat's a bad thing but when it comes\ntime to\nto connecting i fully agree with you i\nmean i talk about this i've been\nfortunate enough\nto meditate for consistently for about\n16 years now\nand i started when i was 18 years old\nand it's been part of my daily practice\nbut i realized probably\nprobably halfway into that which was too\nlate like as\ni wish i realized it earlier but it\nprobably took me eight years to realize\ni shouldn't have ever been trying to\nrecreate the last meditation\nyeah right like you get into that habit\nwith any good habit\nyou get into the habit of like i want to\nmeditate like i did yesterday yeah i\nwant to do this like i did yesterday i\nwant the workout that i had last week\ni want the body that i had last year\nyeah yeah and we do that to ourselves\nand that actually traps us from a new\nfresh incredible experience\nturns out that repetition and\npredictability are impossible in the\nquantum\nif you're truly evolving the experience\nthe experience should be an\nuh an extension of the last one right so\ni always just go at it\na different way if i could i always just\ntry to mix it up right yeah\nit's usually better that way but tell us\nabout how do we\nyou mentioned something before which was\naround you know as soon as you're\nthinking about your problems you're\nthinking about the past right\nhow do you think about a problem\neffectively let's talk about that\nbecause i feel\neveryone feels their life is full of\nproblems how do you process a problem\nproductively effectively through\nthoughts yes\nyeah great great question again i i\nthink we're all faced with\ngreat opportunities brilliantly\ndisguised as impossible situations\nand in order like for me personally and\ni and\nafter looking through your book and\nreading a good portion of it\ni mean for me there's there's no school\nof ancient wisdom that you need to go to\nto be initiated your life\nis your initiation if you're paying\nattention so we meet\nchallenges in our life from a certain\nlevel of mind right\na certain level of consciousness or\nunconsciousness and\neven einstein said we have to go to a\ngreater level of consciousness\nthan the consciousness that's created\nthe problem what is consciousness\nconsciousness is awareness\nand awareness means possibilities that\nyou haven't thought of before\nso we confront problems or challenges in\nour life and\nas a side note i was having breakfast\nwith a researcher just last week\nwho's studying what happens when we\nperceive\na condition in our environment as a\nproblem how it\nweakens the organism they're measuring\nthis and when a person sees it as a\nchallenge\nhow they draw energy they raise the\nenergy of their body\nback into order so if we said\ni want to be wealthy or i want to be\nhealthy well what what you want to be\nthat because you're not it\nso the initiation of going from not it\nhere to it here you're going to have to\nclimb some steps\nand there's going to be some blind spots\nso you try it out and it doesn't work\nwell that's because there's a part of\nyou that's still in a habit there's part\nof you that's still unconscious okay\nso what is it about myself and that\ncircumstance\nthat i am feeling about that\ncircumstance\nand that feeling is causing me to think\nabout it so you say oh it's impossible\nthey'll never change\ni'll hire a hitman i'll hire the mafia\ni'll hire an attorney\ni'll have my friend's friend to talk to\nhim and nothing changes right well\nyou're not you're not separate from that\nexperience you're\ninvolved in it and how you think and how\nyou feel broadcasts energy into the\nfield so\nyour energy is the same every day and as\nlong as your energy is the same\nnothing's going to change in your life\neither\nand nobody changes until they change\ntheir energy\nso then what piece of knowledge\nwhat piece of information what would\nlove do what would greatness look like\nokay i don't know all right well\ncertainly somebody in history has faced\nthis problem\ndon't get on facebook and say does\nanybody have any answers don't\nget go look it up and study and read and\nlearn you'll own it and you'll say wow\nthat person that was wealthy\nthey failed 500 times well hell\ni had the wrong view of wealth okay then\nfailure is not a thing i got to overcome\nfailure\nwell yep just climbed a step yeah okay\ni'm reacting to that circumstance with\nthe same emotion\nthat emotion is firing the same thoughts\ni'm broadcasting the same energy into\nthe field\nif i were facing that circumstance and\nsituation again with that person that\ncircumstance\nwhat do i learn from that circumstance\nhow could i do it differently the next\ntime\n[Music]\nfind out a solution and rehearse it\ninstall the circuitry so when you get in\nthe circumstance you're not going to\nrespond in an automatic habituation yeah\nnow you're at a greater level of\nconsciousness now you're looking at\npossibilities that you weren't looking\nat before because you were unconscious\nnow\nthat process of trial and error is so\nimportant\nin the spiritual path how many times\ndo we have to forget before we remember\nand then we remember and we forget again\nand it takes\nconstantly remembering until we stop\nforgetting\nand when we get to that point now we're\nconscious now\nthere's wisdom and wisdom is the memory\nof the experience without the emotional\ncharge now you're ready\nfor the new adventure so then people\ndraw conclusions and say\noh it's that person that ripped me off\nit's that person that\nwhat now now you don't create your\nreality you only create your reality\nwhen things are good\nwell somehow you got to tango through\nthis somehow your\nobjectivity in not reacting emotionally\nis going to change the energy of how you\naddress this situation so then\nwe keep going in introspection\nat the end of the day if you really\nwanted to be wealthy say\nhow did i do today did i make the right\nchoices was i ethical was i purpose\ndriven\nwas i was i was am i interested in\nmaking a difference was i fair was i\ntempered did i really think before i\nspoke what did i remember reading about\nthat book about that person that did it\nhow'd i do and if you said i when did i\nfall from grace when did i lose it\nokay i want that opportunity again\ni want another shot at that and i'm\ngoing in this way what would love do in\nthis situation what would greatness do\nand now you you evolve your experience\nand somehow\nthere's a door there's an opening\nsomething shifts something's changing\nand now here we go we climb another\nladder and then all of a sudden\nthere's another challenge and then\npeople who finally arrive at their\nabundance\nthey could care less if they're abundant\nthey're already knowing that they've\nearned the right for it so\nso there's sometimes a shortcut in the\nprocess uh\nif we're if we really learn and we\nreally get it but the trial and error is\nso\nimportant because not only is the person\nearning the right to be wealthy\nbut they're earning the right to live in\nworthiness\nworthy to receive like hey you people\npeople\ncome to our work all the time for a lot\nof reasons and one of the common reasons\nis they want to get healthy\nyeah and they're because they're dealing\nwith a very serious health condition\nand i always say the same thing to them\nstop wanting to be healthy\nlearn the formula yeah on how to get\nhealthy\nlearn the formula on how to heal and the\nhealing will be the side effect of it\nif you're obsessing about why am i not\nhealed you're still the old person\nyou're gonna become that person every\nday right turns out that\nwhen you sit down and the people that we\ninterview that have had significant\nchanges\nwhen it's no longer about their health\nbut they are\nthey are out of the bleachers and\nthey're on the playing field\nand they are coming up against the\nbelief like one lady said\ngod i i always thought that this work\nreally worked that this these concepts\nare the truth\nbut i never believed it worked for me\nand i was in a car accident in a\nwheelchair\nand she made the decision that she was\ngoing to overcome that belief now\nit was no longer about her healing it\nwas about overcoming the belief\nbut she overcame the belief and showed\nup every day for herself when you\nbelieve in yourself you believe in\npossibilities when you believe in\npossibilities you got to believe in\nyourself you don't show up for yourself\nyou don't believe in it yeah and that's\nwhy people don't do the work i mean if\nyou\nyou believe that your thoughts created\nreality you would show up every day and\ncreate and so\na lot of people believe in their past\nmore than they believe in their future a\nlot of people fall in love or more in\nlove with their past or romance their\npast instead of\nromance their future or love their\nfuture it's it's that simple so\nthe initiation process of life is always\ngoing to be there you're always going to\nbe challenged if if you want to be a\nmaster\nwell then you better learn how to heal\nsomeone else and you're going to fail a\nlot of times\nand if you think that you're a failure\nthen you'll quit but if you\nfeel like you just didn't quite ding it\nyet and you show up again\nto just ding it and you keep evolving\nyour experience and go deeper how much\nmore can i open my heart\nhow much more can i surrender into this\ninfinite field\nhow much more can i become can i walk is\nit with my eyes open people\ndo meditations and they have great\nmeditations me included\nand then you get up you open your eyes\nand you're back in the program\nand people want to know why they haven't\nhealed them we have testimonies of\npeople\nthey're speaking the truth they said my\nms\nmy rheumatoid and my lupus never went\naway\ni had great meditations i felt better\nand then i realized with my eyes open i\nwas still that person\nand now next level they're in the game\nof catching themselves or catching how\nthey speak\nor watching how they think they're not\nletting their body\nfall in the same emotional state to put\nthem in the same past experience that\nthe body's believing it now\nthis is the this is a great part and\nwhen the person\nfinally breaks through from the chains\nand there's a different consciousness of\nfreedom that happens\nthey look back at their past they want\nto change\none thing in their past because it\nbrought him to that present moment\nthat's the path\nno longer existing that's the freedom so\nis it worth the effort yeah it's no\nlonger about healing\nit's no longer about abundance it's\nabout who you're becoming right that's\nwhat it's about\nyeah i love that emphasis on trial and\nerror\nbecause again just like when we're\ntalking about through some of your\nearlier answers around\nbecoming comfortable in the unknown it's\nthat same alignment again if like what\nwe're trying to avoid is the trial and\nerror what people come to you for is\ni want a definitive answer right i want\nthe conclusion i want the path i want\nthe decision\nthe one thing that's gonna i would never\ntell anybody what to do yeah i believe\nin free will\ni would never tell anybody what to\nbelieve like politically or\nsocially or whatever i want to provide\nthem the tools\nand give them the free will to create\nlife however they want and believe\nwhatever they want that's totally cool\nwith me\nso those people then that\nwant to be healed and they live in fear\nthat fear has to be addressed i mean and\nit's\nnot easy because it's re it's hardwired\ndeep in the limbic brain it's just a\nsafety net it's a mechanism so then\nimagine being in the unknown\nthat the instinct and the unknown is\nit's a scary place\nwow imagine not having a body and we\npractice\nlingering without a body in in in an\ninfinite space and\nwithout a name without a face without a\nculture without a job without a\nsocial security number without a disease\nwithout a diet just\nas an awareness you you practice that\nyou're going to be comfortable in the\nunknown you're going to relax more into\nit that's\ngoing against thousands of years\nof programming and the people who\nactually overcome their fear\nand they trade it for gratitude their\nimmune system gets stronger\ntheir genes up regulated i mean there's\njust a host of\neverything their brain changes their\nheart rate variability\nthey feel differently and it's it's\nbeing measured and and some of these\npeople\nuh we're measuring this now in our in\nour events with\nwith reputable scientists and and\nuniversities they're they're\nshocked at what they're witnessing on a\ncellular level on a brain level on a\nheart level\nthey cannot believe the capacity of the\nbody i\njust was i just got an email today of\na sign one of our scientists said i ran\nthis\nthree times the virus\nthat we expose the cell to in advanced\nmeditators\ndoes not enter the cell it's outside the\ncell it won't\na virus in novice meditators some of\nit's in the cell\nsome of it's outside controls all the\nviruses in the cell there's an immunity\nso when the person's less reactionary to\ntheir environment\nthere's less of response that weakens\nthem they're less of a victim to their\nenvironment\nthen they're less of a victim to their\nenvironment\nlarge scale small scale the body has a\ngreater immunity to whatever it is and\nand that's the truth that is the true\nwe're measuring that so\nso you never know the outcome\nwhen a person really catches that\nthought that leads to the same choice\nthat leads to the same behavior that\ncreates the same experience that\nproduces the same emotion\nthat discomfort that unpredictability\nthat uncertainty\nthat's that's that's the side effect of\nleaving the known that's what change is\nabout and\nlearning how to be comfortable in it\ninstead of just white knuckling it go\noh i have some tools to self-regulate\ni'm in fear oh excuse me\nand you excuse yourself yeah and you\nchange that\nand then you're there and then here\ncomes the fear again excuse me\nand i always say if not now when\nand how is the new later like don't wait\nand so a person who's\nno longer about healing their disease\nit's about overcoming their fear their\nattention is off their disease and their\nidentity\nis changing because we're not\nidentifying with anyone now they're\nlooking\nat something right in the face and now\nonce they're engaged\nthey're showing up every day just like a\nworkout is pain involved\nbut you move through it a little bit\nmore and the volume is lowered and their\nresponse to people and circumstances are\ndifferent\nand then they know they're changing\nbecause people say to them i just saw\nthis just\nyesterday they people say to them\nsomething about you is different yeah\nwhat is it\nyou get a little work done you are you\non a new medication\nbecause their memory of them\nis different they're out of phase we\ndon't see\nthings how they are we see things how we\nare so we feel in reality based on\nmemory and all of a sudden the person is\nout of phase\nthey're they don't they're not they're\nnot remembering them that way they're\nthey're not that\nthey're in the unknown and it's obvious\nand then all of a sudden people get\nraises and they get all these great\nthings going on why\nbecause they're leading by example it's\nnot what they're saying it's who they\nare\nand they're less responsive and they\nhave more patience and they're\nthey're practicing being in their heart\nand when they're in their heart\nthey're more patient they're more kind\nthe more loving the more giving and you\ncan't create a future\nwithout putting your heart into it and\nif your heart if you're throwing your\nheart into your future it better be\nactivated and\ncoherent and so we measure that stuff\nbecause\nit becomes a science and that is the\nlanguage of mysticism now\nwhy is uh why is our memory for\npain stronger than our memory of a\nsuccess or a joy because it sounds like\nwhat you said one one thing that really\nhit me and i loved that was the idea\nof remembering forgetting remembering\nforgetting\nand so often we have a positive powerful\nexperience\nbut sometimes we'll just discount it as\nirrelevant\nand then you have a negative experience\nand we hold on to it and and i find that\nin all of this the memory is exactly it\nthat you said that wisdom is\nwhen you've kind of gone down that\nprocess so far down the line where now\nyour memory is stronger than forgetting\nwe forget the powerful experiences we\nforget the moments where we\nrelieve things so so why is that and\nwhere and what do you do about it\nwell i'll answer it on two levels jay\nthanks for the question\ni i really think that when the survival\ngene is activated\npreservation is the key so we can have\nten things\nthat happen really great in our lives\nyou have a family member or somebody you\nknow that does this\nthey have ten really great things happen\nin their one thing bad and they\nfocus on that bad thing why because the\nsurvival genes activated they want to\nmake sure it doesn't happen again so\nso you put your attention on it because\nyou don't want it to happen again so\nwhat people do when they're aroused\nis there to start thinking it's gonna\nhappen and so they actually\nselect the worst case scenario\nin their mind and then emotionally\nembrace that future before it happens\nand they're conditioning their body to\nbecome the mind of anxiety and fear\nso in preservation and in survival if\nyou prepare for the worst\nanything less that happens you have a\nbetter chance of surviving so\nthat's the mechanism that takes place so\nsurvival means you better take care of\nyour body yeah you better be aware of\nyour environment and make sure there's\nno threats and so you got to keep your\neye out there\nand you better be thinking about the\nfuture based on what you learned in the\npast now\nthere's nothing wrong with that when the\nanalytical facilities are in balance\nbut when there's an arousal arousal\nthere's three things that create arousal\nfear hostility and anger or aggression\nand pain\nand that arousal drives the brain into\nthese high states of what we call high\nbeta\nand most people need something or\nsomeone or some circumstance or some\ndrug or some pill or some computer game\nto change that internal state and the\nmoment they notice a change in their\ninternal state then they pay attention\nto what's causing it they start\ndeveloping a dependency on it right\nso it turns out that when we\nteach people how to self-regulate and\nchange their brain waves\nuh we could actually see then that the\nincoherence the disorderliness that's\ntaking place in the brain you know when\nyou're\nover aroused you're overly analytical\nand you're shifting your attention from\none problem to one person to one thing\nto one place to another problem to\nanother circumstance to your phone\nto your car and each one of those\nelements has a neurological network in\nthe brain so the arousal causes\nthese different circuits to fire out of\norder and the brain is incoherent so\ntake two waves that are out of phase and\nmix them\nwhen they interfere they flatten out\nthere's no energy so energy leaves the\nbrain\nright so then when you're in arousal you\nnarrow your focus on the cause if\nthere's something rattling in the bushes\nand it's dark\nyou freeze and you narrow your focus on\nit and there's a rush of adrenaline and\nyour pupils dilate and your heart starts\nto race\nand you're ready to run fight or hide i\nmean that's a survival moment but\nwhat if it's your co-worker sitting\nright next to you or six feet away and\nand you're judging them you're the same\narousal's taking place and what's\nonce very adaptive becomes very\nmaladaptive\nthis is where it gets challenging so\nwhen we teach people how to open their\nfocus we've done\nthousands and thousands of brain scans\nand they get beyond their analytical\nprocesses and they\nopen their awareness and go from a\nconvergent focus to a divergent focus\nand they learn how to relax and regulate\ntheir brain waves start to slow down\ninto alpha and then if they do it\nproperly and they're connecting\nthose different compartments of the\nbrain that were once firing out of order\nstart to unify different communities\nform bigger communities the brain starts\nto synchronize and\nthen all of a sudden you start seeing\ndifferent compartments of the brain all\nin resonance so now when they're all in\nresonance and they start interfering\nwhen those waves come together there's\nmore energy in the brain so when a\nperson dials down the mechanism\nthis neocortex that plugs us into\nthree-dimensional reality that\nkeeps us aware of our body that's the\nautobiographical self where\neverything's stitched in memory in there\nwhen we start\ndeactivating the mechanism here and we\nget beyond the memory bank of the known\nself and brainwaves move into theta we\nwe've studied this so much when a person\ncan let their body\nbe in a light state of sleep and feel\nso safe that you can finally let go and\nsurrender\nthe body is sleeping but the mind is\nawake and now the door between the\nconscious mind and the subconscious mind\nis wide open and if they can regulate\nand stay there\nsomething amazing happens there is a\nrelease of energy\nfrom the body and their brain goes into\na very very super coherent state of\ngamma\ngamma is super consciousness now i'm not\ntalking about\na little gamma i'm not talking about a\nlot of gamma i'm not talking about a\nreally loud gamma i'm talking about a\nsupernatural amount of gamma there's\nso much order and so much energy in the\nbrain like if we were in an audience and\nwe were all\nclapping like this that could be alpha\nright theta would be\nand if everybody could do this it's\nslower we could do it the more we can\nget our timing down the more we can get\ncoherent\nbut if we were doing this it would be\nreally hard for all of us to do that at\nthe same time it takes a lot of order\na lot of awareness a lot of energy to be\nable to\ncreate that kind of order so\nthat's how fast the brain is and that\narousal\nthat's taking place is ecstasy that\narousal\nis bliss it is the most familiar\nunfamiliar feeling that people ever\nhave and that memory then that the\nperson has that is\nso profoundly different than the feeling\nof success\nthe feeling of wealth the feeling of\norgasm or love or whatever this is a new\none and it's a thrill\nand the person notices a dramatic change\nin their inner state\nand with that experience comes a very\nlucid picture\na very profound insight a download of\ninformation\nthat's the moment then the body many\ntimes\nrewrites the biological program energy\nis in forming matter and the autonomic\nnervous system is\nregulating it's in high order and\nremember disease is autonomic\ndysregulation\nnow it's getting into a very very high\nfrequency of order\nand it's sending very coherent\ninformation\nto the cells and tissues sending energy\nto the cells and tissues and\ncells begin to emit more coherent light\nand information\nand then there's the disease and there\nit's not\nand listen i've seen it too many times\nthe person said\ni had we had a guy in cancun in our last\nevent that was a\nveteran that was became in a wheelchair\nhe had both his knees blown out he had\nbroken his back he was extreme pain on\nthe bottom of his feet he couldn't walk\nhe was suicidal\nhe had post-traumatic stress disorder\ntried everything\nfirst walking meditation he's out there\nlumbering around on two crutches\nnext day he's on one crutch the evening\nin the evening of the final meditation i\nswear\nhe is he's running down the beach\nwithout his crutches and the volunteers\nthat usually help people with handicap\nare\nchasing him and he's running the other\nway he he hit he hit gold\nthere's no pain in his feet no\nlimitation in his body he got an upgrade\nnow that arousal that experience he'll\nnever forget\nthat's a new one so i think that a lot\nof people you know\nuh we get you know we get conditioned\nlike oh wow success but\nyeah you know sooner or later you're\ngonna be like when the novelty wears off\nyeah\nthat's not what i meant but but but\nhere's the cool part the cool part is\nlike\nwhen you hit pay dirt like that when you\nconnect when you connect to the field\nwhen you connect the divine whatever you\nwant to call it when your consciousness\nmerges with a greater consciousness\nand that arousal creates ecstasy bliss\noneness whatever you want to call that\nyou realize that it never came from\nanything out there\nit didn't come from the wardrobe or the\nfacelift the\nsports car whatever it came from within\nyou and so you stopped\nlooking out there for it and now the\nlove affair begins\nand you never want to miss a date\nbecause it's just too good\nso that memory then that is what i'm\nafter\nbecause when you have those\ntranscendental moments and you\nunderstand this\nyeah the experience of that\ntranscendental moment\nlays down new circuitry in the brain\nthat's what experience does\nand the experience produces a feeling\nbut it's not chemical\nit's electric and it's orderly and every\ncell of your body is\njiggling in an order and they're and\nyou're aroused and you're awakened\nright you have to admit\nwhen that occurs your spectrum of\nreality is going to broaden some\nconditioning\nsome illusion some belief about a white\nguy in a bee with a beard keeping\ntrack of if you did something right or\nwrong and you failed\nyou let god down that's not how it\nsomething is removed\nand you start seeing reality as it is\nand\nall of a sudden you start seeing the\npart that we edit out\nfor survival now you start seeing\npatterns and lights and information\nthat are transcendent of\nthree-dimensional reality and your\nspectrum why because\nyour brain had the experience and the\ncircuitry is there\nand now your your experience of the\nworld changes you get an upgrade to the\nto the vr set the virtual reality said\noh you got the upgrade you got 2.0 and\nnow it looks different everything looks\ndifferent\neverybody looks different the world look\nyou're seeing beauty more well\nand there's more holism and more\nconnection and sounds and words and\nmusic and sense and sight and light is\nall working together\ni mean that's the blessing of an\nawakening right that's where\nthat's where we're going what are the\nthings that\ndisturb or disconnect our awakening and\nconnection to the divine what are those\nthat that source or that power that\nconsciousness that you are speaking\nabout\nwhat are the things that then disturb or\ndisconnect us from that once we become\nconnected because i'm sure many people\nfeel connected they get it they they get\na breakthrough\nyeah yeah but then yeah you know we kind\nof fall back\nwell this is a great question also i\nmean i mean\num wow i think a lot of times when\npeople\nthey hit that point they try to\nreproduce it the same way as we talked\nabout and you can't\nyeah you can't do it the same way\nbecause that's redundancy\nbut also many times uh we have the\nexperience and we start to try\nand because trying is matter trying to\nchange matter and\nand so we're forcing we're controlling\nwe're predicting\nand and then the uh and when we do that\nthen of course we're in separation and\nwe're waiting for the event to happen to\nfeel the emotion right and\ni've done that long enough and it's\nactually we have to lay down\nthe very thing we used our whole life to\nget what we want for something greater\nto occur and it takes\npractice of surrender right so\nthat's one element i also think that our\nresponses\nemotionally like\nlet's just say that a person gets\nconnected to the future they get\nconnected to the energy of their future\nthey feel it it's really great\nand then they start their day and then\ntwo hours later they're they're feeling\nsomething else because some person or\nsome circumstance altered their state\nwell\nthey just disconnected from the energy\nof the future and now they're back to\nthe energy of the past don't expect\nanything to change in your life because\nthen work that way\nso then then when they get back to that\nold self again\nthen they say what's wrong with me i\nfailed they didn't do it right no\nthat's all the program you show up again\nand you go after it again\nso familiar feelings cause us\nto no longer see through the lens of the\nfuture we're seeing through the lens of\nthe past\nand and we color reality that way so\num i think i think familiar emotions\nuh get in the way as well and then of\ncourse there's always belief\nand a belief is just a thought you keep\nthinking over and over again until you\nhardwire it in your brain and all\nbeliefs are based on past experience so\na person has an experience\nthe stronger the emotion they have from\nthat circumstance\nthe more they pay attention to the cause\nand the brain freezes a frame\ntakes a snapshot and that's called the\nmemory the moment they draw a conclusion\nabout that experience they'll think\nneurologically within those circuits and\nthey'll feel chemically within the\nboundaries of emotion\nthinking and feeling thinking and\nfeeling belief becomes an\nunconscious or subconscious state of\nbeing they don't\nmost people don't even know they have\nbeliefs about things about god about\nrelationships about money\nbecause it's it's not a conscious thing\nit's a subconscious thing yeah so in\norder to change a belief or a perception\nabout yourself and your life you got to\ngo all in\nit's not like you go 50 in you got to go\nall in you got to make a decision\nwith such firm intention\nthat the amplitude of that decision\ncarries a level of energy\nthat causes the body to respond to the\nmind\nthat the choice that you make becomes a\nmoment in time you'll never forget and\nyou would say\ni remember the moment i made up my mind\nto change\nand the stronger the emotion you feel\nthe more you'll pay attention to the\ndecision and that's a\nhuge stone you drop in the quantum field\nbig splash\nbig waves and in this in essence\nwe're giving the body a taste\nemotionally of the future we're aligning\nto a new future now how many times you\nhave to do that i don't know i've done\nit over and over again\nuntil it becomes uncompromising and\npeople say i remember\nwhen i made up my mind to change i\nremember i made up my mind to heal\ni remember the moment i can tell you\nwhere i was who i was with what time of\nday it was\nit wasn't like 9 11 something out of the\nworld changing your inner world\nyour inner world is changing your inner\nworld which is ultimately going to\nchange your outer world so\ni mean people say well i i i believe god\nlives within me the vine lives within me\nokay you sit them down and do a\nmeditation ten minutes goes by and\nthey're hungry and they quit\nif you knew the divine lived within you\nyou you wouldn't quit\nyou would not you would you would be\nlike i'm here yeah and you're gonna go a\nlittle deeper a little further you're\ngonna get past your hunger you're gonna\nget past your pain you're gonna you're\ngonna go a little further because like\nyou wanna know right if you knew it was\nthere\nso that's a belief that you're not aware\nof right so we all have them i i face\nthem every day so\npeople have beliefs that like that the\ndivine has a\nas an opinion about them it's it would\nnever it's impossible\nto judge it would divide itself it can't\ndo that so\nas we start having these experiences\ni think then our paradigm shifts many\ntimes at least for me i mean\ni can't tell you how many times i've had\na transcendental moment come back to joe\nthis benzett\nand looked at looked out in this world\nand i said i got this\nall wrong this is not about abstaining\nfrom life\nwho's the opposite it's about going all\nin and\nreally engaging and really living and\nreally experiencing and tasting and\nsmelling and eating and loving\nand have explore here for that we're\nhere for all of that so you create the\nexperience\nand then when it gets predictable or it\ngets boring\nlet's change it up let's create another\none and then how far can you go with\nthat it just goes on\nso i think there's i think really belief\nis the other thing that some it's a\nblind spot that we have to become\nconscious to\nyeah one of the other blind spots or\nbeliefs that i think where even that\nsometimes\ngoes the other way and not what you're\nsaying i i i know what you're saying\nbut one of the ways that we find our\naudience struggles is\ndeducing the energy of the people around\nyou and the energy that you attract into\nyour life and the people that you keep\noften like you said there are people\ncoming to your seminars that are\ndragging their partners\nyeah and they have to drag their\npartners there because their partners\nare not\nunderstanding it initially where is that\nis there a method for people to start\ndeducing the energy\nof people they meet and connect with to\nbe aware if they're on the same\nfrequency or on the same path uh\nuh well well i don't i don't know if\nthere's a machine that does that\nbut once again like i think that if we\nshare the same experiences because\nwe like the same things we share the\nsame emotions\nand if we share the same experiences we\nshare the same emotions i can relate to\nyou so we can exchange\nideas and information and if we share\nthe same energy\nenergy is information so many people\nas an example they use each other to\nreaffirm their\ntheir dependency on suffering so i\nsuffer more than you then you say i\nyou i suffer you suffer more than me we\nhave this thing we just complain with\neach other well that's the same\nresonance the same frequency\nand there's a match right but goes to\nthe same means if you if you're\nif you're someone who's has a uh\naccountability partner that that you\nexchange ideas like this with and it's a\ndifferent frequency and different energy\nso\nwhen energy comes together and it's\nconstructive something comes out of it\nyeah you feel it right it's\nand you feel an elevation if there's\ndissonance\nthen your your sensing meter is how you\nfeel about that person many times in\nyour gut or in your heart or wherever\nand there's decon there's a destructive\ninterference and there's no energy\ninvolved so\ni think that's just a practice but\nreally\nthe ultimate mastery is to be able to be\nin such residence\nsuch coherence that when you walk in the\nroom that you raise\neverybody's energy and you don't let\nyour energy drop because of any\ncircumstance or any condition and that\nwould be greater than your environment\nright and that's\nthat's the model that we use so imagine\n1500 people in an event\nwhere everybody's getting super coherent\nand the interference that's going on in\nthe room\nis creating these high amplitudes and\nwe've measured that in the room and the\nenergy in the room is\noff the chart many times there's i mean\nthere's energy for healing in there\nthere's energy for all kinds of things\nthat\ncan happen so we brought it to life\nwith our awareness and so the more\nelevated the emotion\nlove gratitude freedom bliss ecstasy\nthe higher the frequency so but it turns\nout you can have a collective group of\npeople with a lot of energy\nand be incoherent and it creates entropy\nyeah\nyou could have a smaller group of people\nthat are highly coherent and put out a\nvery big signal so when we see a\ncollective really get coherent wow the\nenergy in the room\nopens up doors of possibilities that i\nwould\ni would never expect i mean i i don't i\ndon't\nknow how to explain some of the\nphenomenological things that happen\nbut that's that's everybody's divine\nlike everybody's everybody's\nin that state they're they're in that\nelevated state so\ni think our i think our truth meter is\nreally whether we feel it lifted\nuh or we feel like uh we've been robbed\nyeah\nyeah and often often our feeling of\nfeeling lifted\nis based on everything we've just talked\nabout it's based on a void\nbased on unhealed trauma based\non a gap or a\npart of ourselves that we haven't yet\nbroken a belief\nand so often feeling lifted is not\nfeeling lifted in the way you're saying\nright it's feeling lifted in the just\nthe external superficial sense\nreaffirming the emotion you need just as\njust as you said earlier at the\nbeginning that an external event\ncould make you feel sad right the\nexternal event is making you feel\ngood right right but it's still\nextensive exactly the opposite right\nso then that means then when things are\ngood you feel good yeah when things are\nbad you feel bad so\nthere's dramatic contrast and polarity\nand this is the realm of polarity right\nso\nhow do you find the middle path well the\nheart is the middle path it's the union\nof polarity it's the union of opposites\nit's\nit's oneness it's wholeness and this is\nwhere we have to begin to create from\nall of this down here is all\nhumanity this is all our animal nature\nwe get up in here\nthings change right you go from selfish\nto selfless\nand something else happens so it's\nreally funny too because when\na lot of people come they say i i don't\nknow i'm having difficulty opening my\nheart\ni'm you know i'm practicing but i'm not\nfeeling anything yet and then it comes\ntime to do our healings on other people\nand\nthe moment you it was no longer about\nyou all of a sudden something happened\nwell of course that's what the heart is\nabout right so\nso it comes in ways that uh we least\nexpect at times\nyeah i love that you've incorporated\nthat element of people\nhaving that experience and and often\nmost people can't open their heart to\nothers because they haven't even opened\ntheir hearts\nthemselves right like they haven't been\nthrough that process\nof sitting long enough yeah to let the\nheart i mean\ni always say to people when was the last\ntime you sat\nwith your heart and just worked with it\nlike so that it's not contracted and\nafraid and protected\nit takes practice to to do that and and\nso we we work with people in letting\nthem\nwe give them numerous opportunities to\npractice this\nover and over and over again and sooner\nor later\npedal by pedal it starts to bloom and\nall of a sudden\nthere's an authentic smile on their face\nand once energy\nmeets the heart it goes right to the\nbrain we have\nwe did this study where we hooked up an\nelectrocardiogram to an\nelectroencephalogram and an\nelectroencephalogram is a brain mapping\nmachine so we measure\n19 or 26 different compartments and\nwe're looking to see all different kind\nof activity in the brain\nbut we measured the heart along with it\nand\nwhen the heart starts beating coherently\nin\na sense of order like like taking a big\nsheet j\nand going like that the heart sends a\nwave right up to the brain\nand the brain goes into these beautiful\nstates of alpha\nthe heart is telling the brain it's safe\nto create again\nit's safe to imagine it's safe to dream\nof a new future\nand there's the stroke volume of the\nheart in order and then you see these\ntwo or three seconds of beautiful\ncoherent alpha\nthe brain is in it's it's in that\ncreative state then there's a pause and\nit happens again and\nit's it's it's beauty it's a it's a\nsymphony\nif you don't have that mechanism you can\nhave all the intention in the world\nbut there's no carrier wave i mean when\npeople when they make energy\nreach their heart there's an external\nfield that's created it's it's\nit's magnetic it's it's it's measurable\nand that energy is frequency and if that\nfrequency is coherent\nit can carry the intent or thought on a\ncoherent brain of that future\nthe energy of suffering cannot carry the\nthought of health or wealth\nit's not consistent with it it carries a\ndifferent set of thoughts\nso then the training then is getting\npeople into those hard states because\nonce they start trading that fear or\nthat pain or that frustration or trying\nor whatever forcing\nyou know control for gratitude and they\njust let all that go\nand i say to them listen if you can't\nfeel gratitude if you can't feel love i\njust want to know what you've been\npracticing feeling every day\nbecause that feeling that you're\npracticing is what\nyou're always feeling now let's practice\nfeeling something else in the beginning\nit's not going to be easy but you got to\nkeep following the formula keep doing it\nkeep doing it keep doing it\nwell when they start feeling gratitude\nit's very interesting because\nthe emotional signature of gratitude\nis that something wonderful just\nhappened to you\nsomething favorable is happening to you\nright so you've just received something\nor you're receiving something you say\nthank you so\ngratitude is the ultimate state of\nreceiving emotionally\nso when you move into a state of\ngratitude and you open your heart\nyou will accept believe and surrender to\nthe thoughts equal to that emotional\nstate and you'll program your autonomic\nnervous system into a different destiny\nyou could say i'm healthy i'm healthy\ni'm healthy i'm wealthy and wealthy and\nwealthy and wealthy and free i'm free\ni'm free and your body is conditioned in\nthe misery and it's saying\nno you're not and that thought stops\nright at the brain stem\nit never makes it to the body because\nthe body is on a different program\nso then while the person starts trading\nthat and they start opening their heart\nwell their immune system gets stronger\nby 50\n50 in three days they start making\nimmunoglobulins\ntheir body's natural defense against\nviruses and bacteria\n50 not a little bit a lot that's that's\none study and\nso trading that telling the body it's in\nthe in the environment where it already\nhappened\nand so that's when the miracles start\nhappening that's when people say\ni'm not doing anything well of course\nyou're not\nyou don't have to yeah so then last\npoint about this because it's so\nimportant that people understand that\nmost people are creating\nmatter to matter so the more you live by\nthe hormones of stress the more altered\nyou are inside of you the rush of those\nadrenal chemicals\nnarrows your focus the senses are\nheightened and we become materialists\nand now all of our attention is on our\nbodies and our environment and on time\nand now we're\nlost in the vr machine of\nthree-dimensional reality everything\nappears as separate\nso i'm here and you're there and there's\nspace and time between us\nthen there's me here and there's my\ndreams i place them way out there in the\nfuture why do i place them out there\nbecause i'm estimating how much i have\nto work to get that house to get that\ncar how much i have to save how much\novertime i have to work what things do i\nhave to do how do i have to cheat\nrob steal lie whatever i have to do to\nget it right\nthat's matter trying to change matter\nand so when it doesn't happen we feel\nmore separation we try harder we force\nwe pray we control\nall that stuff so then\ncreating from the field instead of from\nmatter means that you have to take all\nof your attention off your body\nall of your attention of all the people\nin your life all your attention of all\nthe\nobjects and things all the places and\neven time itself\nand become nobody no one no thing\nnowhere in no time\nand if you're not any of those things\nwhat are you your consciousness\nand now you are liberated from the rules\nof three-dimensional reality where\neverything takes time and energy to get\nwhat you want now when we create from\nthe field\ninstead of from matter because it's not\nmatter that's emitting the field\nit's actually the field that's creating\nmatter change the field\nyou change matter right now this is not\nsomething you\ntake one bite of and you get it's\nsomething you got to really practice\nso then by doing this properly with a\ncoherent brain and a coherent heart\nyou got a wi-fi signal and if you're\ncreating from the field instead of from\nmatter\nyou no longer have to go anywhere to get\nwhat you want if you were connected\nto that invisible field of energy called\nthe unified field the quantum field\nwhich connects everything physical and\nmaterial and you're aware of it and\nyou're connected to it\nyou're connected to source why would you\nif you were source\nwhy would you go get anything you'd draw\nit to you\nso the thought coherent brain is the\nintent it's the electrical charge\nthe elevator the motion the heart has a\nmagnetic signature\nit's the magnetic charge the thought\nsending the signal out it's the\ndirective\nthe feeling is drawing the event back\ncreate that\ncombination and now you're going to\ncollapse space and time\nand you're going to draw those\nsynchronicities to you now i'm here in\nthis lifetime\ni'm clear that i want to master that i\nwant to get good at that because i don't\nwant to i did the other stuff you can\nget successful the other way but you're\ntoo tired\nit takes too much energy i would rather\nsynchronize my energy to synchronicities\nin my life and be mystified yeah by\nwow this stuff really works and every\nsynchronicity that happens\nthat catches you off guard and brings\nyou joy and awe and wonder\nyou're going to use that energy to\ncreate the next one and it gets weird\ni've had some crazy synchronicities in\nthe last three days\ni'm laughing while i'm driving going oh\nmy god this life is\nso incredibly mysterious what an amazing\nride this is that's a different\nperspective one is when you're not\nsynchronizing well you asked the person\nwas it worth it you showed up every day\nwas it worth absolutely\nso when it starts happening and you\nstart seeing those\nyou see feedback in your world you're\ngoing to pay attention to what you did\nand you're going to do it again and\nyou're going to be like okay i've done\nthis i've done this and\nthis people who heal themselves have\nvery\nlittle difficulty healing someone else\nyeah that's just the next step\nand then with covid and we couldn't do\nthe healings in our events\nwe had students just get together and\nsay if we're in the quantum\nokay and everything's connected do i\nreally need to be there i just need a\ntarget\ngive me the face give me the coordinate\nlove transcends space and time\nyeah okay give me that coordinate i'll\nlove that person in the life and these\npeople\ndo it and we have we have reputable\nuniversities now that are\nstudying this phenomena and they're\nsaying they're telling me\nthese are universities that have some of\nthe most advanced laboratories this is\ni'm talking the nobel prize\nresearchers they want to change the\nconversation in medicine\nand today i got a video of somebody\nbeing healed remotely\nand she's laying there her cancer went\nfrom\nreally bad to nothing and she videotapes\nherself when the group\nworks on her she is laying there and her\nbody\nis moving all over that floor it's\ntwisting and turning there's\nenergy manipulating that body they're\nchanging the pattern in the field\nthey don't need the body is the illusion\nthe tumor is the illusion that's the\nhologram\nchange the pattern in the field you\nchange the projection in\nthree-dimensional around\nour person who's healed themselves and\nbeen in a circle where they've healed\nsomeone else\nhow and then when you do that what's\nnext i don't know you won't know until\nyou have that experience\nyeah i've sat in on the groups where\nthey get together on the zooms and\nfive people that they've healed tell\ntheir story\nyou know a mother whose daughter is\nunresponsive with a\nwith a with an injury or a handicap from\nbirth\nwho's now looking at her brothers who's\ntrying to talk who's smiling who's\npresent\nthe mother's telling the story there's\n40 people on the zoom we're all crying\nnot crying for any other reason but the\nspecies\nis helping the living organism called\nthe human being\nis healing one another they're informing\none another taking care of one\nsomething innate is awakening us we're\nwe're crying\nthe experience of that produces an\nemotion\nthat's different than any other emotion\nyou could ever feel that's a new\nexperience\ndo you think that that person who goes\nto heal the next person\nis going to have a problem opening their\nheart after that\nthey know what the payoff is\nand so they don't contract oh my god\nthat person has\nin a coma you know how many people have\ncome out of comas because of this\nhealing group\nthey're spot on they can hit a target\nand they lay their energy over that\nfield and another one over there and\nanother one over and all of a sudden you\nget these complex\ncoherent patterns and it's creating a\nchange in matter and\nand they they figured it out and we have\nuniversities that are we're collecting\nall the data and they're\ncrunching all the algorithms we know\nthat it works really well for anxiety\nit works really well for insomnia for\nneurological disorders\nparkinson's disease inflammation we're\ncapturing that pain\nhuge changes in pain and they're they're\non the other side of the planet it's\nkind of and we're synchronizing we're\nmeasuring heart rate variability and\nwe're sending electrodes and sensors to\nthe people that are being healed and\nwe're seeing if there's a correlation\nbetween the coherence of the group\nthat's doing the coherence of the person\nwho's having the experience and\nwe're measuring dna before the healing\nand three days of healing we measure the\ndna after why because\nevidence has allowed his voice you see\nthat it's the four minute mile\nthat you can't go back to being the same\nperson\ni scratch my head sometimes when i'm\nstanding on the stage\nand there's someone speaking to the\naudience\nwho has had a very serious health\ncondition and they don't look like a\nvegan\nand they don't look gluten free and they\ndon't look young and they don't look\nbuffed and they don't look like they're\nin shape\nthey just look like a normal person that\nhas struggled\nwith a health condition and they're\ntelling the truth\nthey you are witnessing the truth\nthey are the example of truth in other\nwords they have the scans they have the\nblood test\nit's gone and i'm looking out in the\naudience jay\nand everybody is leaning in nobody is\nmoving there\nthey are in awe of the four-minute mile\nright in front of them\nsomebody broke through somebody pierced\nthat veil somebody broke out of that\nlevel of consciousness\nand that story is filled with truth not\nnot my words\nyeah it's star wars they just showed up\nevery day for themselves they just kept\nshowing up and believing in it and they\nbecame it right\nyou asked that person where's the\ndisease they'll tell you it's in the old\nperson\ni'm somebody there's i'm not the same it\ndoesn't can't be there\nthe person in the audience who's\nrelating to that person\nwith the same rare genetic disorder the\nsame lupus the same cancer\ndon't you know that their belief is\ngonna change\nright in front of them and instead of\ntaking two years to do it\nthey do it in three months why because\nas soon as the four minute mile was\nbroken yeah the next one that broke it\nwas two weeks later and there's been\n1400 people have done it i mean\nit's not a thing anymore right so\nto me that's we have such compelling\nevidence in science\nwith brain scans you make your brain\nwork better you can make your heart work\nbetter you make your immune system work\nbetter you can\nmake your cells go from really sick to\nreally healthy we've got\ngreat evidence you can become immune to\nserious viruses you can be immune to\nbacteria we've got the measurements\nyou can blame in your life we have great\nevidence and the people aren't monks\nthey're not\nthey're not nuns they're not religious\nscholars they're just\ncommon people and then we have testimony\nof people who are the example of truth\nthey are they are the example of truth\ni would rather have dinner with those\npeople than anybody anybody else\nthey know something right so evidence\nthen becomes the loudest voice\nright and and that's what i think what\npeople are looking for right now\nthe truth is so lost in sensationalism\nand the truth is so lost in emotional\nagreement\nand so people who want to feel fear\nthey program themselves and accept\nbelieve and surrender that people who\nwant to be hate\nbe hateful it's all there it's all there\nand it's a\nit's a matrix to find the way out right\nand\nand i think i think there's a door i\njust i just think that we have to\ntrust the innate information that that\ncomes from within us\nabsolutely fascinating and i can't wait\nto actually experience an event\nin in really i'm going to invite you one\nmore time and then i'm going to send\nsomebody over here in a car to pick up\nyou well i think the last time we wanted\nto do it and then the pandemic yeah\nso you know from from last time better\nno i would i would love to i can't wait\nto experience that and to\nexperience it personally not just to\nwatch others but to actually go through\nit myself too but\nwith all of that said and seeing these\nbreakthroughs seeing these breakthrough\npatterns you having transcendental\nexperiences\nwhat do you believe in this present\nstate of ignorance as you said\nwhat do you believe is the purpose of\nlife overall\nto figure out the purpose of life okay i\nknow i mean i mean i\ni really think it's i think the\nmathematics\nthat i've looked at says there's\ninfinite\nexperiences to have you will never know\nthe end\nso then if you study any religion\ni i mean i've looked at a lot of them\nthis concept of eternity\nthat the soul is going to be around for\neternity\nthat's a long time and that means you\ngot to be\nokay with you for a very long time\nyeah so i think it's i think it's the\ncreation\nof more experiences and i think to to\ni think we came from source from\nsingularity from oneness\nand we have descended down into density\na fooled\nby our senses into separation and\nevery single being has a spark of\noneness of the divine within them\nand we got so separate that we now have\nour own\nfree will to answer the question is\nthere more\nbecause if your oneness it gets kind of\nboring after a while like is there\nanything else well\nthe moment you ask if there's anything\nelse you're no longer oneness you're\nsomething other than oneness right and\nyou're\na a different consciousness separate\nfrom oneness\nso i think then we live life and then\nwhen we can predict the feeling of\neverything that can happen in our life\nand\ngets boring and we're not impressed by\nanyone or anything\nwe ask the same question is there more\nand that's when the soul goes\nall right well it's been how many\nlifetimes you've been doing this\nokay there's an awakening and the and we\nask that question and then all of a\nsudden\nwe start getting information and books\nand stuff and meet people and it gets\nexciting and\nand it's the it's it's how the universe\nworks and so\nwe climb out of this and i just think\nthere's so many incredible experiences\nthat are left in the unknown\nuh that we get to have and and then of\ncourse when\non the journey is over and you evolve to\nthat point\nthen you take that wisdom and you went\nyou say here's what i learned and it was\nscary down there and i was like boy i\ntell a great story and then you hang out\nthere and you go\nis there anything else besides and here\nwe go again it just never ends\nthat's my theory that's a great answer i\nloved it i i resonate deeply with many\nparts of that answer i think it's a it's\na really\nbeautifully put way of thinking about it\nand bringing in that like i said at the\nbeginning\nbringing in that spiritual that science\nand the experience of\nof what it would actually look like to\nlive for eternity so it's a beautiful\nbeautiful answer dr joe we end\nevery episode with the final five these\nare the fast five questions\nwhere the answers have to be one word to\none sentence maximum\nokay so this is uh i don't remember this\nfrom last time so this is good\nyeah and i'll probably break my rule\nwith you because you give phenomenal\nno i'll i'll do my best i'll try my best\nas well me too i'll try my best as well\nokay so\ndr joe these are your final five uh the\nfirst question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever received\nhow to show up for yourself what's the\nworst advice you've ever received uh\nbelieve what people tell you what's\nsomething that you've said in the past\nthat you were confident about it then\nbut now upon reflection you're like oh i\nshould have changed my mind about that\noh that it takes a long time to create\nreality okay i'm going to ask you to\nexpand on that because i like that\nanswer\ni want to know more that's fascinating\nwell um\ni think just like anything else uh you\nlearn how to snowboard\nyou go through that learning curve you\nlearn how to ride a bike you go through\nthat learning curve\nuh that that i used to think that\ncreation was hard\ni just thought it took a lot of energy\nand it took a lot of sacrifice and\nyou had to work for it and great onsen\nand uh god i mean even my definition of\nsurrender\ntoday is very different than it was just\nthree months ago because i'm always\ndoing it\nand so i think that\nit doesn't have to be that way i just\nthink that it could be any way you want\nand that and then working on that uh\nchanging that belief\ni love that beautiful answer thank you\nfor sharing yeah question number four\nuh what's one thing that you think\npeople value but you don't\noh other people's opinions if i really\ncared what people thought i would have\nstopped this a long time ago and now\nit's so great because i have\nso many researchers and physicians and\neverybody i'm very glad you didn't stop\nand we are very happy you didn't stop i\nthink it's deeply meaningful work and\nthe more time we spend\ntogether and the more time i hear\nwhere you want to take people where you\nwant what you want people to experience\nis just beautiful so\nthank you for what you're doing thanks\nuh fifth and final question\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be take care of one\nanother\nnice and simple that's beautiful i love\nthat\neveryone dr joe dispenza an amazing\namazing interview so many\nfascinating insights i hope you're going\nto listen to this one twice\nmake sure you go through make some notes\nand you can follow dr joe on instagram\non facebook on youtube is there anywhere\nparticularly you'd like anyone to find\nyou or anything you have right now\nthat people can start getting excited\nabout you know uh\nyeah sure first of all website we just\nbuilt a new website and i realized uh\nin during covid that my greatest value\nis our community\nwe have our community is we're doers you\nknow we we do the work you know and\ni love us i love people who walk their\ntalk you know and so\nwe built a new website so the website dr\njoe the spenza is super cool it's got\nreally great\nresources there we're releasing this new\nprogram called\nthe formula and after after all the\nresearch that we've done we figured out\nthat if we could just teach it in small\nepisodes\nand give people the meditations to\npractice and each meditation\nbuilds on the next and it's not too\noverwhelming and you want to turn it on\nto your boss or to your\nspouse or to somebody you love it's it's\njust\nit's in smaller by chunks and there's a\nlot of content there so\nthe formula will be out at some time and\ni think the end of april will be i love\nthat\ni love hearing that yeah that sounds\nfascinating i think that's what we need\nmore than ever i think\npeople uh right now especially in their\nhomes and needing the formulas\n[Laughter]\nwell i'm happy to contribute anyway yeah\ni love that make sure you go and check\nout the formula end of april it will be\nout so probably by the time you listen\nto this\nit will be available go and check out\nthe website we will put all the links\ninto the description so you can follow\ndr joe on social media\nand check out his website and the\nformula program uh dr joe dispenza thank\nyou so much\nthank you for your beautiful answers and\nheartfelt answers thank you so much\nthank you\nthank you if you want even more videos\njust like this one make sure you\nsubscribe\nand click on the boxes over here i'm\nalso excited to let you know that you\ncan now\nget my book think like a monk from think\nlike a monkbook.com\ncheck below in the description to
