    "transcript": "hey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten\nlearn and grow and i am just honored\nhumbled and grateful today\nbecause i have the honor of speaking\nwith the one and only\noprah winfrey the person who's inspired\nme to start this podcast to have the\nconversations that i get to have\nevery single day and inspired me to\nbelieve that wisdom\ntruly can be viral it can be contagious\nit can truly change people's lives\nso i'm excited for you to hear more from\nher\nand dr perry in a moment but we got to\nchat to oprah just before this wonderful\nbook tour event we did\nand so oprah welcome to on purpose thank\nyou so much for this opportunity\ni am excited i did not know that i\ninspired you for this i did not\ni had no idea i've always wanted to tell\nyou and\ni'm glad i get to tell you in this way i\ngrew up watching you\nand you made me believe that\nconversations about\nconsciousness and purpose could reach\nevery person on the planet\nand that gave me so much confidence as a\nyoung man that\nthis was the work that was so deeply\nneeded and so thank you\nso much well look at what i did who knew\nthat who knew that\nyou know maya angelou said to me years\nago when i'd come back from doing my\nschool in south africa the opening of\nthe school and i was\nshe wasn't able to attend so i came\ndirectly from south africa to maya's\nhouse jay and i was\nsitting at the kitchen table and she was\nteaching how to make biscuits and i said\noh my other school's going to be so\nthat school's going to be my legacy it's\ngoing to be incredible and she said you\nhave no idea\nwhat your legacy is going to be because\nyour legacy\nis every life you touch your legacy is\nin one thing\nyour legacy is everybody who was moved\nto who watched your show\nwho went back to school who got out of a\ndomestic\nviolent relationship who changed the way\nthey saw things\nand so now i'm looking at you jay shetty\na part of my legacy\nthat that's the most wonderful and\nbeautiful thing to be a part of i'm i'm\nso humbled and\ni meant every word but uh well thank you\nwell we're here today to talk\nabout a big part of your legacy which i\nthink is this beautiful book called\nwhat happened to you that you've\nco-authored with dr bruce perry who will\nbe speaking\nto in a moment but i i want to ask you\nhow did you\nmeet dr bruce perry in the first place\nhow did you connect\nand where did that relationship start\nyour learning and your journey\ntowards understanding what happened to\nyou well\nyears ago uh in the late 80s early 90s\non the oprah show\nwe met talking about early childhood\ndevelopment and how\nwhat you do with children from zero to\nsix was\nthe most important years because you're\nreally cooked by six\nyou are who you're going to be that\npersonality is set\nand then i was working\non a a bill\nthat would require child\nabusers child molesters to\nhave a database there would be a\ndatabase for child molesters in the\ncountry and so\ni had i called dr bruce perry and a\nbunch of authorities on\nchild sexual violence to my house\nthere was a national child protection\nact that was signed\nthat i went to washington i think with\nbill clinton\nand because in the early 90s there\nwasn't a database for all the\nall the child abusers and you could just\ngo across state to state lines and so\nuh i started working with him early when\ni\nopened my school in south africa jay\nuh taking girls from traumatized\nbackgrounds who were\njust like i was growing up who were\nsmart\nwho were passionate who wanted to\nsucceed in their lives\nbut didn't have the means so i went from\nvillage to village to township choosing\nthese girls\ni built this beautiful school i chose\nevery sheet every towel\ni made it a beautiful aesthetic for them\nand i thought they're going to just now\nhave these magnificent lives well the\nfirst\nthree days girls were having really\nstrange behaviors\nand like running out of the rooms and\ncrying in the classrooms and having\nbreakdowns\ni call bruce perry dr perry from\nsouth africa and said i don't know what\nis going on here\ni i i and he said i think your girls are\nsuffering from ptsd\nand i said how can that be nobody's been\nto war\nso he explained to me the way the brain\nworks\nif you've been raised in an environment\nwhere every day\nyou're just worried about are you going\nto get food are you going to survive\nare your parents going to keep their\njobs you're literally constantly in the\nstate of anxiety\nthen you bring a child into an\nenvironment where there are not six\npeople sleeping in the bed\nit's just you in the room you're alone\nthat now causes anxiety\nbecause your brain isn't accustomed to\noperating\nin calm in discipline in order\nand so that's when i started working\nwith bruce at my school\nso he's been a major influence for me\nand then we did a story together for 60\nminutes\nwhere this question of what happened to\nyou came up where he said people always\nask the question the wrong question\nwhen they're dealing with children with\nbehavioral issues they say what's wrong\nwith that child\ninstead of what happened to them and\nthat was the biggest aha for me\nit is the biggest aha when when i heard\nyou frame it in this book it's\nit's truly as i as i'm going to talk\nabout later on it's truly the simplest\nand subtle but most\npowerful reframing i i wonder you share\nso many honest and open and vulnerable\nstories in this book\nwhat do you think was something that you\nmisunderstood\nor had an incomplete understanding of\nabout trauma that has now become more\ncomplete\nor more deep oh what a great question\njay\ni thought trauma prior to\nmy conversations with bruce in doing\nthis book\ni thought trauma had to be a big\ngigantic\nthing experience you had to go through a\ntsunami\nliterally a s if not literally a tsunami\na tsunami-like crisis in your life\na fire a hurricane a tragedy a car\naccident a stabbing\nsomebody died and it was through\nco-authoring this book with him that i\nunderstood that it was the consistent\nlittle\nthings it was the aggressions and\nmicroaggressions\nin a person's life that causes them\nto have their own world view whatever\nthat worldview is for you\nis different from me so the biggest the\nbiggest learning for me is that\ntrauma doesn't have to have a great big\nold capital t on it\nit's really how you were loved and that\nneglect\nand trauma are hand in hand because\nboth are equally as toxic and so\ni'd always you know just like you with\nyour\nyou know millions of listeners i\nover the years of interviewing people\nit was my greatest classroom i was\nalways paying attention\nto what people were saying and paying\nattention to their lives\nand what i understood and could\narticulate\nnot through science but just through my\nown observation is that oh people are\nas dysfunctional as\nunhappy as disoriented in their lives\nbased on how far they are from the\ncenter of themselves\nand the center is where wholeness lies\nas you know\nand so where there is no where there is\nno center\nand there is no sense of wholeness and\nlove for yourself there's going to be a\ndisarray chaos confusion\nand you know dysfunction in your life\nand i saw that over and over and over\nagain\nthat people behave based on how they\nwere loved\nand then how they were able to process\nthat that in a way\nto love other people and so bruce just\ngave me the science for that what this\nbook did is\ngave me the science for it i love that i\ni think it's a brilliant distinction\nbetween\nyou know what we think is trauma and\nwhat what trauma can be for all of us\ni have one last question i want to ask\nyou before we dive in to the\nconversation with dr bruce perry\nit's this idea you've interviewed so\nmany influential\nsuccessful people and people of all\ndifferent backgrounds and walks of life\nand so often their success is actually\nbuilt on their trauma and so\ntheir success doesn't often satisfy them\nwhat have you seen\nhas been that transition when they go\nbeyond their success\nthey heal their trauma to actually find\ntrue success for themselves\nthat's deep layered complex question so\nthis is why\nthis is many layers to that what i've\nwhat i realize is\nthat if you come into success\nand fame and particularly fame\nbecause fame is its own world and\ndefinition because\nit really is based upon what other\npeople\nthink of you so fake because\nfame isn't what you think of yourself\nit's what other people think of you\num when if you come\ninto that and you don't have a grounded\ncentered self you will be controlled by\nthe outside instead of the inside\nand if you come into that not in the\nfullness of knowing\nwho you are and what you're supposed to\ndo with\nthat fame it whenever somebody likes you\nor doesn't like you\nthat determines whether or not you're\nhaving a good day or a bad day\nand you are you have lost control of\nyour your own life so i think\nwhat fame teaches you quickly\nis to grow the wholeness within yourself\nso that you're not controlled by others\noutside opinions of you\nthat is a beautiful answer and and i\nthink it will resonate with so many\nbecause\nso many of us are on that journey to you\nknow be successful or be famous or be\nrich or whatever it may be but to hear\nit from that perspective is is truly\nrefreshing\nand i was gonna i was gonna say this to\nyou and why i was so happy to see this\nbook being released what\nhappened to you for anyone who's\nlistening right now\nis because we have a mutual friend who i\nwon't mention right now but we have a\nmutual friend and he said to me that\nonce he asked you a question and his\nquestion was\noprah what do you know to be true out of\neverything you've heard what do you know\nto be true\nand he told me that the answer you said\nto him was that whatever a child\nexperiences from zero to five is going\nto define\nhow they live out the rest of their life\nand so he shared that with me a few\nyears ago and then when i saw this book\ncome out go\nfinally we actually have an answer\nand and i just think that that is such a\ntrue true statement i'm not a parent yet\nbut uh\nwhen i am i'll definitely be trying my\nbest uh to\nto practice you'll know that those\nyounger years the\nthe younger the younger the children are\nthe more influence you have not only\non who they become but on what their\nbrain\nbecomes because if you're surrounded by\nchaos and dysfunction\nand loudness and disorder at as\nzero to two months it means the synapse\nin your brain\ndoesn't form in the way that it does in\nchildren who have had that\nand you are more likely for behavioral\nproblems\nhealth problems all other problems in\nlife\njust because you didn't get what you\nneeded from zero\nto two months that is what is so\namazing it's crazy oprah i'm going to\nask you a fast five these questions have\nto be answered in one word\nor one sentence maximum so they're super\ntight\nuh oprah winfrey these are your fast\nfive the first question is what is the\nbest advice you've ever received\nuh when people show you who they are\nbelieve them the first time\nfor maya angelou beautiful okay second\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\na lawyer told me not to purchase hana\nhana was for sale i mean hana\nthe city of hana 5 000 acres\nwere for sale and i had a lawyer who\ntold me not to do it\namazing okay uh question that's another\nanother day another story okay question\nnumber three\num what is something that people value\nthat you no longer value\ncars i went through my car face i went\nthrough my car phase i have had every\nkind of car\nand now i don't care now i'm getting\naround on a scooter\ni love that okay literally uh question\nnumber four\nuh one lesson or breakthrough from this\nbook you\nreally want people to understand i want\npeople to understand\nmost importantly that when you\nare arguing with a friend and they act\nlike they can't hear you because they're\narguing so strongly back at you\nthey really can't because of the way\ntheir brain is structured so when you're\nin fear mode\nanxiety mode when you're really amped up\nyou just need to both of you need to\ncalm down take a walk\ntake a break and come back that's that's\nwhat you\nunderstand and also the thing the thing\nthat i just shared with you earlier\nis that you think you are protecting\nyour children or you that you are\nbeing okay when you're doing destructive\nthings around your young children\nwhen that is really when literally they\ndon't have the language\nbut they're taking in the energy and the\nfrequency\nand they're absorbing it all and fifth\nand final question that i'm going to ask\nyou if you could create\none law that everyone in the world had\nto follow\nwhat would it be it would be a law\nthat allowed for at least\n12 minutes of stillness every day just\nfor people\nto come to themselves\nthat's what it would be thank you so\nmuch oprah i can't wait to meet you i\nlook forward to it and i'm so grateful\nfor this time with you thank you so much\ni recently had the chance to host a\nvirtual book tour stop\nwith oprah and dr perry and now i want\nto share it with all of you\nthis was an exclusive event that i was\ninvited to host\nand i'm getting to give our on-purpose\nlisteners exclusive access\nto listen to it right now thank you so\nmuch and make sure you leave a review\nmakes a huge difference to on purpose\n[Music]\nhello everyone thank you so much for\nbeing here with us this evening\ni am so excited to welcome you all\nto the first virtual book event for what\nhappened to you my name is jay shetty\nand i will be your host tonight along\nwith our friends\nat books a magic bookstore out of\nbrooklyn and semicolon bookstore\nin chicago i feel extremely honored and\ngrateful to have this opportunity\nto interview dr bruce perry and oprah\nthe book came out today so i know none\nof you have read the book yet\nbut this conversation will prepare you\nto truly allow this book\nto enter into your hearts and minds and\ninspire you\nto take out some time for stillness to\nexperience\nevery single word when you read it but i\nwas fortunate enough to receive\nan early copy and i have to tell you\nit's phenomenal\nthe stories the studies and the steps\ninside this book will truly help you\nheal\nbuild resilience and help others that\nyou love so much\ni can't wait for you to read it and\nwithout further ado let me introduce you\nto the co-authors of this groundbreaking\nwork\ndr bruce perry is a renowned brain and\ntrauma expert\nwho spent the last 30 years researching\nchildren's mental health\nand of course oprah winfrey the person\nwhom i was fortunate enough to watch\ngrowing up\nand what happened to me oprah was i got\nto see you change lives every day\nso you have led the way for so many of\nus to benefit from the work of\nscientists and thinkers\nlike dr perry whose life-changing work\nis the reason we're here today\nwelcome dr bruce perry and oprah\nexcited to be here excited to be here\nand especially excited to be here for\nbookstore magic and semicolon in in\nchicago\nbecause i love uh going to my own local\nbookstores and love the support that\nbookstores bring to the community\nand love that we are all able to be\nsupportive of\nour local bookstores jay so excited that\nyou're excited about the book\ni'm excited that you're excited i'm very\nexcited i'm extremely excited and dr\nperry thank you so much for this\nopportunity\nit's my pleasure i'm happy to be here\nand\ni'm also excited that you like the book\nbecause as\nyou probably know when you work on a\nproject for a long long long time you\nkind you lose\nperspective on how it's perceived so\nit's\ni think it'll be fun to see how people\nlike it over the next week\nyeah because our stories end science\nit's stories and science\nstories and science and that's what i\nloved about it that this book\nwas in fact a conversation or multiple\nconversations and\ntoday we get to have this first\nconversation so i want to start off\nwith a question that actually comes from\none of these beautiful\nparagraphs that you both start the book\nwith and if you don't mind i'd love to\nread from it\nand this section says do i have your\npermission both of you if i could\nplease jay please yes so you\nyou both say this book is for anyone\nwith a mother\nfather partner or child who may have\nexperienced\ntrauma and if you've ever had labels\nlike people pleaser self-sabotager\ndisruptive\nargumentative checked out can't hold a\njob\nor bad at relationships used to describe\nyou\nor your loved ones this book is\nfor you now i don't know anyone\nwho's never been told one of those\nthings i know i've heard some of them\nmyself as well\nand we've all heard those labels and i\nwant to ask you both\nthis first question to start with is\nwhy is it so important to make this\nswitch\nfrom us thinking what is wrong with you\nto what happened to you\nwell let me answer that because i first\nuh\ncame across this question of what's\nhappened\nwhat what what what what happened to you\nwhen i was doing an interview\nwith dr bruce berry a couple of years\nago for 60 minutes story i was doing\nnow i've known uh dr perry for over 30\nyears i first started interviewing him\nin the\nearly 90s late 80s early 90s on the\noprah show\nwhen we were talking about uh raising\nchildren and how important it is\nthose first zero to six years so i've\nbeen hearing about\nwhat it means to nurture and support\nthe brain early on it wasn't until that\nconversation a couple of years ago\ni don't know whether i think it's\nbecause of where i was in my life at the\ntime\ni opened a school in south africa i've\nhad these wonderful brilliant girls who\ncome from traumatic backgrounds\ngrow up and have really serious\nmental health issues and i was trying to\nat the time\nfigure out what are we doing wrong at\nour school\nsomething's really wrong here and in\nthat interview with dr perry he said\nyou know most people ask the question\nwhen kids are not behaving the way you\nwant them to behave or what's wrong with\nthem\nwe really should be asking about what's\nhappened to you and something went\nin my brain it was like a major moment\nlike\ni got it in a way that i hadn't received\nit before and i realized that it's not\njust\nfor children that you ask that question\nbut it's really everybody\nand that moment bruce as i've said to\nyou many times dr perry\nchanged the way i saw my relationships\nhow i saw my own life how i interacted\nwith people\nand even in politics where it was so\ncrazy in the\npast four years and everybody's always\ntalking about what's wrong what's wrong\nwhat's wrong i would always say i wonder\nwhat happened\nto that person i wonder what happened to\nthem younger\nthat caused them to be this way so all\nof the labels that you just gave jay\nthere there's a world of labels there is\nyou know overachiever there's\nyou know obsessive compulsive moms\nsoccer moms there is the desire to you\nknow\nplease people all the time there's a\nmultiple multiple multiple multiple\nlabels\nthat refer back to what happened to us\nand so i will just say this one of the\nthings that bruce says in the book\neach of us comes into the world with our\nown world view\nand that world view is actually shaped\nfrom the crib and\nyou get from the world what you project\ninto the world\nand you project into the world what you\nwere raised\nwith and what you were raised around so\nthat's why\nwhat happened to you is the essential\nquestion\nso beautifully said and i i wish my\nbrain had aha moments that sound like\nthat oprah too so\ni love that and dr perry i'd love to\nhear your thoughts\nwell i come at this from a slightly\ndifferent perspective because i\nhave a long history of being a history\nfan and had studied history\ngrowing up and was very well aware of\nthe relationship between\nthe things that happened in the past\nplaying a major role\nin how things were functioning currently\nand i think that that's\ni think most people are able to kind of\nmake that connection\nbut as i became a biologist and learned\nabout the development of the human body\nand the human brain\nit became clear that we have our own\npersonal history and that the things\nthat happened in our life\nshape the systems in our brain that\ninfluence how we think about things how\nwe feel about things and how we behave\nand it really\nit leads to a completely different\napproach to getting to know somebody\nyou're you\nyou enter the interaction with a curious\nmindset you're curious about like what\nwhat's going on i mean and and it really\ni think\nis as oprah says it it really opens up\nthis\nnew perspective on understanding a\nperson you can be much more empathic\nwith them as opposed to being so\njudgmental\nyeah for me that reframing that you both\nhave so beautifully\nilluminated in this book is is so subtle\nbut it's so powerful because it removes\nthat\njudgment it removes that negative\nobservation that criticism that that\nfear that people feel on the receiving\nend of that as well to me just that\nswitch of question is\nis so powerful so what i want to do now\nis i want to ask you both\nquestions uh throughout the different\nchapters of the books as no one really\nhas it\ntill today and i'd like to start with\nyou dr perry and ask you what\nwhat happened to you what inspired you\nto study child trauma\nyou know where did your journey start\nand\nwhy did it become so important to you\nbecause obviously this is something that\nyou've done for decades\ntell us about the beginning of that\njourney\nwell it started kind of randomly because\nwhen i went to college at stanford they\nhave a\nfreshman seminar process where they take\nincoming freshmen and they assign them\nto\nsome eminent faculty member and then for\nevery week for the whole year you meet\nwith that person\nand you get to know their work and have\nconversations it's a great experience\nand i was randomly assigned to uh\nseymour levine who is the grandfather\nand now great grandfather of almost all\nof the\nbig stress researchers in our field\nand he had just been doing a series of\nstudies looking at how you could take\na little rat pop and give it a tiny\nlittle bit of stress\nhandling stress you just take it out of\nit the litter hold it and then put it\nback after a certain period of time\nand then let the animal grow up and then\nwhen they looked at those animals\ntheir brain was very different than the\nbrains of animals that didn't have that\ntiny little stress\nand i thought that was stunning that you\ncould have an experience that was\nliterally minutes long and it would\ninfluence\nin a lifelong way the functioning of\nthis really critical set of systems in\nyour brain\nthat are involved in how how every organ\nin your body functions\nand from that point forward i was\nstudying the development of the stress\nresponse systems in animals and then\ngot into clinical work and it's\ninteresting you know going back to what\noprah said about labels\nwhen you go into mental health and start\nto get trained\nthere's a manual that people use that\nthe dsm\nand it's full of labels and it's based\non the symptoms that somebody has\nand basically it's a big book that says\nwhat's wrong with you\nand it doesn't say what happened to you\nand so i was a developmentalist\nand i had been studying the brain and i\nwent into the field and i'm like wait a\nminute\nthere's about 30 different ways that you\ncan become\ninattentive you know you can have\nattention problems from\nhyperthyroidism and developmental trauma\nand\nyou know lead toxicity and all kinds of\nthings we need to ask\nyou know we need to get to know the\npeople that were giving these labels\nand if we did that i think that we would\nstop giving them labels and start giving\nthem some solutions\nabsolutely absolutely thank you so much\nfor sharing that and\noprah as you were saying earlier it's\nthe book is full of stories\nand the science and when i was reading\nabout your own childhood\nstories and trauma traumas in this book\nit's it's difficult at times and it's\nchallenging but at the same time\nyour level of honesty and transparency\nis\nis genuinely such an inspiration for\nmyself and countless other people who\nare struggling as well and\nyou know when i was diving into the book\nthere were moments where i just\ni was so grateful to you for what you\nshared and you know you open up about a\nstory about how your grandmother used to\nwhip you over the smallest most\ninsignificant things like\nspilling a glass of water and this horse\nright exactly breaking a plate and this\nharsh\nthis harsh behavior was normal for you\nas a kid and you said something in the\nbook that really stood out to me you\nsaid that\nthe long-term impact of being whipped\nturned you into a world-class\npeople-pleaser\nfor most of your life i want to know\nhow did you become aware of that\nconnection between\nthat experience as a child\nand how it was being lived today and how\ndid that start to help you on your\njourney\nwell thank you so much i'm so moved that\nyou\nwere touched by that story because i\nuntil\ni was a full-grown adult and i met my\nbest friend gail gail is the first\nblack person i ever met who wasn't\nwhipped as a child i mean she was the\nfirst person\ni ever encountered so it is a part of\nthe black culture to not just spank your\nchildren\nuh almost everybody you run into of a\ncertain age was whipped as a child so\nthat was such the norm for me that\nwriting about it\num for the first time\nis the first time i actually recognized\noh this is not a normal thing\num so to\nreally i was in a board room having to\nconfront\nsomeone in my 40s\nand i had so much anxiety about\nthe fact that i was going to have to\nhave this confrontation with somebody\nand it just just just the most um\nnormal disagreements would cause me a\ngreat sense of\nangst and worry and oh my god and what's\ngoing to happen\nand i just said what where is this\ncoming from\nwhat what why am i so afraid\nwhen i am the one in the power seat i am\noprah winfrey\nrunning the harpo studios my name\nspelled backwards\ni'm the person in charge and in order to\nhave\na disagreement with somebody i go\nthrough so\nmuch angst and i realized jay\nthat even though i had the power\ni still felt that every confrontation\ni was gonna get a whipping that a\nwhipping was gonna result that that\nthing that cut that used to come up\ninside me when i had to walk to get my\nown switch\noh where is this feeling coming i'm\nfeeling like in\nevery confrontation i'm gonna get a\nwhippin\nand at the end of it that person's gonna\nbe mad at me and at the end of it that\nperson is gonna say\nyou better not act like you're mad you\nknow all the things that happened\nto me as a kid so it wasn't until i was\na full-grown adult\nin my own seat of you know perceived\npower feeling those feelings of\nanxiety and anxiousness having to have\nthe slightest bit of confrontation\nso what i say in what happened to me\nis that being beaten as a child\num having to be subservient to other\npeople's\nideals of what it means to be a child\nmeaning\nyou are seen and not heard so i've grown\nup to have this big personality\nbut being raised in an environment where\nchildren are seen and not heard and your\nopinions\ndo not matter so what happened to me\ntaught me\nthat my opinions do not matter keep your\nopinions to yourself\nand do whatever you can to please other\npeople\nso that other people will like you\nso that other people will not be upset\nwith you\nand i will have to tell you it is also\nfor me not for everybody else\nbut for me one of the reasons why\ni was so susceptible to sexual abuse\nbecause i had been taught and trained\nnot to speak up for myself that whatever\nsomebody wanted to do\nwho was older than me or in a position\nof authority\nthat they had rights i that i did not so\nthat what happened to me was ingrained\nin a way that\nyou know literally uh caused me to be a\nmajor people pleaser\nfor for a great deal of my life\nthank you for sharing that that full\njourney and just i really gravitate\ntowards\nthat statement you said around how we\nwhen we normalize something we don't\nactually even recognize the trauma in it\nwe don't even realize that it that\nthere's any it was just normal to you\nyou just expected it and\ni think that really brings us nicely uh\ndr perry to this\nthis thought about what something you\ntalk about how we're loved in the book\nand you know you say that a common\nphrase people use whenever a child\nacts out is that he or she must\nnot have been loved as a child right\nand in the book you go on to explain\nthat how it isn't\na matter of how many hugs and kisses you\nreceived as a kid\nso for the parents watching and i'm sure\nthere are many parents watching and for\nthose of you are watching right now and\nenjoying this conversation i highly\nrecommend to make sure that you go and\norder yourself a copy of the book but\nfor those of you that are watching\nand dr perry when you think about this\nwhat should parents\nbe thinking about differently or doing\ndifferently\nthat many of them may be missing today\nand the idea of wanting to give\nlove and often our perspective on what\nlove is or our definition of what love\nis\nfeels like hugs and kisses well\nfirst of all to clarify love hugs and\nkisses are nice things and\nand they can be part of a really\npositive loving environment\nbut one of the things about the brain is\nthat these systems\nin our brain that allow us to form\nrelationships and maintain them in a\nhealthy way the systems that allow us to\nlove\nand be empathy can become ultimately\nhumane\nthese systems develop like any other\nsystem in the brain\nthat require repetition repetition\nrepetition\nthat when you want to get better at\npiano you have to practice your piano\nand you want to get better at reading\nyou need to read and read and read\nand if you want to develop the capacity\nto\nform a healthy loving relationship you\nneed\nlots of tiny little doses of attentive\nattuned responsive nurturing interaction\nwith people around you and uh you know\na lot of people grow up and and again\nthis is this\nthis is language that's not uncommon in\nour world is it\nit's the quality and not the quantity\nyou know so if you give your child a\nlittle quality time\nuh then that is somehow supposed to\novercome the fact that you're gone for\nfive days of the week\nand it just doesn't it doesn't do that\nyou know children\nneed your presence even if it's your\nneutral presence\nand they come over and they give you a\nhug and they wander away they come over\nand they ask a question and they wander\naway\nand they need lots of tiny little doses\nof positive interaction\nand now one of the challenges in our\nmodern world is that we have\nso many isolated single caregivers\nparents\nwho may have multiple children who need\nthat\nand since in the modern world we've\nmoved away from having aunties and\ngrandparents and neighbors\nplaying a role in this sort of community\ncaregiving model\nwe've got tons of exhausted overwhelmed\ncaregivers who are\ntrying to do their very best but there's\njust no\nphysical way possible that they could\nmeet all of these needs of these\nchildren and so\ni think that that's a big that's a\nburden that our society needs to address\nand think about how to create more\nrelationally enriched environments to\nsupport our young parents\nbecause the vast majority of them would\ndo the right things they'd just be drawn\nto do the right things\nif they weren't exhausted worn out\nworried about housing\nworried about food you know we\nstructurally contribute to the inability\nof these caregivers\nto provide those loving environments\nyeah one of the things dr perry says in\nthe book\njay is that we're the only country in\nthe world that does this that we're the\nonly country\nthat expects a single mother to be\neverything and all things\nyou know to children whereas other\ncountries\nwhere there is uh number one a greater\nrespect for the elders and the elders\ninvolvement in the\nchild's development and aunties and\ncousins and\nfamily members and so when you don't\nhave that\nuh these moms which i feel\nso deeply for moms who are trying to do\nit all it's impossible to be able to do\nit all right\nit is and it and and the thing for an\ninfant and a child growing up\nlove isn't the feeling the parent has\nfor the child\nlove is an action right love is sort of\nnight after night after night after\nnight getting up and meeting their\nfundamental needs when they're hungry\nthirsty cold\nand and over time\nas they build in these neurobiological\ncapabilities\nto mature then you can move to more\nemotional\nvariations of that equivalent of love so\nnow that we're adults we can actually\nsay you know what\nthere's somebody in my past who was\npresent attentive\nand i love that person and and if you\nif you know that's that is love but your\nability to sort of\nbuild that much more advanced\nneurobiological capability emerge from\nthousands and thousands and thousands of\nrepetitions of these loving\nnurturing relations relational\ninteractions i think that's such a great\npoint because\nuh as i grew older and it wasn't just my\ngrandmother whipping me but were other\npeople\ni remember getting a whipping once and\nhaving uh\nyou know one of my relatives say i i'm\nwhipping you because i love you\nwell it certainly didn't feel like love\ncertainly didn't feel like love but i\nknow\nthat for that generation the idea of\ni'm going to keep you in line and i'm\ngoing to make sure you're disciplined\nand that you're going to obey\nand do the right thing in their minds\nmight have felt like love\nbut certainly did not feel like or was\ninterpreted\nby me to mean love i mean i think for\nanybody who's listening to us or\nwatching\nright now and i know if you are\nculturally raised\nuh the way i was you have a lot of\nof pain behind those whippings and i\nremember doing a show\non the oprah show years later talking\nabout should children be spanked and a\nblack woman stood up and said\nwell i got beat every day and my father\ni was in the choir and my father\nbeat me in front of the whole\ncongregation in church\nand i turned out okay and i'm like did\nyou really\nbecause nobody anybody who's ever been\nhit\nrealizes the humiliation of that what\nyou feel more than anything\neven as a little kid is the humiliation\nof it\nand what you are being told in that\nmoment is that\nyou have no value that you are worth\nnothing that you are so worthless\nthat i get now to lay my hands on you\nand\nphysically beat you so it takes a lot\nand i\ni would have to say that\nit was a lot for me to overcome\nto begin to understand that my life was\nof value\nand as i say in what happened to you\nwhat did that for me\nwere relationships with my teachers i\ncould cry right now\nthinking about the the teachers who\nstood in\nthe gap for me and made me feel\nvalued made me feel important so it was\nonly\nat school or speaking in church that i\nfelt a sense of\ni mattered that there was some\nmeaning and and and purpose for me in\nlife and so\nyou know as when i was talking to bruce\nin 60 minutes i said bruce please\nexplain to me why i'm not crazy\nbecause because i\nyou know grew up in these circumstances\nwhere\ni should have no self-values no\nself-worth but bruce\nas he explains in what happened to you\nyou don't have to have it come from your\nfamily\nother relationships with people who are\nnurturing supporting\ncaring and actually just see you so the\nreason why i love\nschool so much is because that's the\nplace that i felt seen\nyeah it makes me so happy to hear you\nboth\ngive people the permission to realize\nthat they don't have to\nhave it all figured out and that they\ncan't have it all figured out and that\nit's\nwe're all trying to be the perfect\nparent the perfect person the perfect\nprofessional the perfect partner and\nperfection's impossible as it is but\neven at striving for it you're giving\neveryone the permission to realize and\nalso i love that point that was just\nmade around how\nthis is not just what's happening at\nhome it can be\nheightened or amplified by what happens\nat school or it can be\nnurtured and nourished and improved as\nwell by what happens and\noprah one of the things you talk about\nin the book when we're talking about the\nneed for rhythm\nand balance and that's what i think this\nbook does so beautifully is\nwhat this book allowed me to do was feel\nvulnerably\nbut then project that onto a framework\nof how to think about it\nand and i think that that is such a\nrefreshing thing because often we're\ntold to be vulnerable\nand be open and then you you let it all\nout and then you're like oh well this is\njust a mess i don't know where to put it\nall and then\nyou know this book allows you to kind of\ngo okay well that makes sense and this\nis how i place this\nhow did you how do you recommend for\npeople to find the time\nto create rhythms i know you say you\nblock out the sunday to be with yourself\nand spend time walking in nature\ntrying not to be distracted for anyone\nright now who's saying\ni i recognize from hearing both of you\nthat i must have some trauma\nwhere do i where do i find the time to\nunpack it how do i make time for that\nand where do i start well you start with\nunderstanding that\nyour cup being full is how you allow\nyourself to give to other people\nyou you can't give what you don't have\nyou can't love if you haven't been loved\nyou don't\neven know how to begin to do that so i\nthink\nit begins with fundamentally\nunderstanding that you are worthy enough\nyou are valuable enough you matter\nenough\nto give yourself the love that you\ndeserve\nand that starts by taking out time for\nyourself so\ni have my own rhythm and pattern i know\nthat\nif i go six days and then on the seventh\nby the seventh or eighth\ndon't give myself a break that\nlots of other things give that i'm not\nas alert\ni'm not as attuned i'm not as centered\ni'm not as focused\nso i know that that is that is my limit\ni cannot go\nbeyond a certain amount of days and for\nme\num walking in nature uh is my solace it\nis\nwhere i feel that i am one with all\nand all being you know all creation and\nyou know connected for other people it\nmay be dancing it may be music\nit may be knitting it may be whatever\nit is that brings some kind of\nrhythmic pattern into your life actually\nit was bruce and i were walking on my\ncampus in south africa\nand uh there were a group of girls\ndancing literally on the lawn because\nlord knows they\nlove to dance and bruce says oh that's\nnot just i said oh they're just having\nfun\nand bruce said oh they're not just\nhaving fun they actually are healing\nthemselves\nbecause the rhythmic pattern that's why\nwhen you've been in an argument with\nsomeone\nor you're in the middle of an argument\nwith somebody if you just go and take a\nwalk\nor you go and turn on some music and you\nstart dancing if you just\nhave some form of movement you feel\nbetter\nthat's number one number two one of the\nmost important things\nmost most important takeaways from what\nhappened to you\ni believe is understanding how the brain\nworks\nand that diagram that's on page 26 or 27\nabout the\ninverted brain being like a triangle so\nyou see that beginning with the brain\nstem that's the lower part of the brain\nall the way to the cortex and through\nthe limbic area\nyou understand that we're looking at it\nright there\num you understand that when you're upset\nor in fear or angry or are in\nan antagonized state and you're trying\nto\nreason with a person a child your spouse\nyour boss your friend they\nliterally cannot hear you because\nthe reasoning part of the brain is in\nthe cortex and\nwhat you're saying is only reaching the\nbrain stem\nso whenever somebody is dysregulated\nwhich is what that is being\nanxious and fearful in yelling and\nscreaming\nthe thing to do is to calm yourself\nfirst\nthen you will be able to help that other\nperson\nget calm and regulated that's how you\nget to reason\nbut if you both are just yelling at each\nother literally you're going you don't\nhear me and you don't hear me either and\nyou\nthey actually cannot hear you that's\nwhat i thought was so fascinating\ni think i explained it well right yes\ni'm just sitting here smiling\ndo you concur dr perry do you concur i\njust want to make sure because\ni do i do i have no praise this is\nactually a lot of fun\noprah's just become a neuroscientist so\nwe're going to expect you to now tell a\nstory\nto trade to trade to trade places\nuh but you know i'm so\nit's so amazing to hear you explain that\nand that's exactly what i meant by\ngiving a framework\nto really look at it in such a clear way\nuh in a way that we're often not\nencouraged to see it because it sounds\ntoo difficult or too complicated but to\nto simplify that idea is that here's\nwhat you think is going on and here's\nwhat's happening inside your brain\nand dr perry when you when you dive into\nthe science you\nquote a study in a survey that said that\nalmost 50 percent of\nchildren in the united states have had\nat least one significant traumatic\nexperience\nbut a lot of people will still deny\never having experienced trauma a lot of\npeople will feel uncomfortable\nadmitting and accepting that they have\nexperienced some trauma what are some of\nour\nmisconceptions around what trauma is\nand how it affects us and would you mind\nexplaining what sort of experiences are\ndefined as traumatic\nto help us expand our definition\nso most of us first heard\nthe concept of sort of trauma as we're\ntalking about it now in context of\npost-traumatic stress disorder and\ncombat veterans and so\neven within our field in psychiatry the\nmajority of people who studied\nuh trauma and looked at trauma we're\nlooking at\nthe effects of these horrific events\nexposure to combat\ndeath of a a of a soldier next to you\nas you know the thing to understand\naround trauma but over time the\npeople like me who were studying the\nstress response systems\nin in animal models\nwere very uh well aware that it's not\nnecessarily these\nbig traumatic events that are\neasily identified by everybody as a\ntrauma that will lead to the changes in\nthe brain\nthat cause the problems and so certainly\nif you do have these\nevents that can be a problem so natural\ndisaster\nhouse fire car accident you know\nabuse of all sorts that's certainly\ntraumatic\nbut probably the most important thing\nand and i think the thing that's\nimpacting more children\nand adults than anything else\nare experiences that are patterns of\nstress\nactivation where you have no control\nover the experience it's not predictable\nand it's prolonged it's ongoing and i\nthink to some degree\nthe experiences of the last year\nare an example for many people of a\nprolonged\nset of uncontrollable and unpredictable\nstressors\nand we've all felt sort of our baseline\nlevel of\ntolerance is going down we're a little\nbit more tired we can\nhandle situations a little bit less and\nso what we've been studying is\nthe combination of these experiences\nwhere you are\nnot in control of your life and it may\nbe a child who's living in a domestic\nviolence environment where\nhe or she is not the direct target of\nall of this stuff but there's so much\nunpredictability about when the fighting\nis going to happen\nand there's so much unpredictability\nabout whether mom is going to be\nin a good mood today or a bad mood or\ndad's going to be angry or not\nangry and that can lead to these\nphysiological changes\nthat increase your risk for physical\nhealth problems mental health\nproblems and learning problems and so\nthat's kind of where we're moving in the\nfield is\nthis recognition that you don't just\nhave to have some sort of capital t\ntrauma in your life to be impacted by\ntrauma and in fact if you are\na minority in a majority culture\nyou're going to get all kinds of\nexperiences where you're getting\nthese relational interactions that are\nnot are sending the signal that you\ndon't belong\nwhich will activate your stress response\nwhich can over time accumulate\nand influence your physical and mental\nhealth\nyeah thank you dr perry for you know\nilluminating on that point because i\nthink for so many of us\nas you rightly just said that we feel\nthat trauma only means trauma with a\ncapital t\nand so we often disregard we often let\nthese things just\nfade away and you know put them under\nthe carpet and just just not not really\ngive them enough\nemphasis and focus because we don't see\nthem as\nbeing significant and so yes oprah\ni wanted to say that one of them\none of the most important points i think\ndr perry makes in\nwhat happened to you is that neglect\nis as toxic as trauma and so\neven though you might not have had a\ntrauma with the big t\nthat it boils down to did you get\nwhat you needed and i have done so many\ninterviews as\ni know you have too jay with people who\nare raised in the same family\nand everybody in that family has a\ndifferent experience and sometimes\nsiblings are arguing about a thing that\nhappened because from their point of\nview it felt like one thing and from the\nother person's\npoint of view it felt like another thing\nwell that is the reality of life\nthat you can have two children four\nchildren six children raised in the same\nhousehold and they experience the love\nof their parents differently\nand not all the kids could have gotten\nwhat they needed and some of the kids\ngot what they needed so\nneglect is you not getting what you\nneeded for your worldview for your\npersonal\num approach to life your sense of self\nvalues your your sense of self-esteem\nand so\ni i i have seen in the thousands of\ninterviews that i've done over the years\nthat the level of dysfunction in a per\nperson's life\nis almost directionally directionally\ndirectly proportional\nto how they were loved what happened to\nthem\nand how they were able to receive or not\nreceive that love\nso the the what happened to you isn't\nyou know just for people who had the big\nt traumas but it literally is\nwhat happened to you were you loved\nwere you not how were you loved how was\nthat love\napplied in your life and were you able\nthen to apply it in the rest of the\nworld\nso i know many people are listening who\ndidn't get what they needed\nand i say this to my girls in south\nafrica all the time because\nso many of them were born during the\nyear of\nuh during the decade where\nso many of their parents died of aids\nand they have this sense of abandonment\nliterally going from one family to the\nnext family member and then that family\nmember dying and that family member\ndying\nand when you grow up feeling abandoned\nand certainly abandoned from an\nearly age you\n[Music]\nyour world view is that people are going\nto abandon you\nin their relationships and so you either\ngo into those relationships\nbeing very needy and afraid that this\nperson is going to leave me\nor you go into those relationships being\nvery jealous and\nyou know holding on and having to know\nwhere you've been and looking at\npeople's cell phones and all of that\nbecause you're afraid that you're gonna\nleave me and so\nwhat happened to you no matter who you\nare\nis important in understanding why you\nhave the world view that you do\nyeah and it applies to each and every\nsingle one of us\nevery single question i'm seeing a\nquestion coming in from one of our\nuh viewers tonight uh g saying\nhow do you reach an understanding so the\nanger and sadness\ninside can calm down i think what i'm\nwhat i'm hearing here in ida question 2\nwhich i think relates is around this\nidea of\nyou know when when you've connected the\ndots and you you start to notice that\nsomeone's caused you pain\noften that can be quite uncomfortable\nand you start to now have resentment or\nanger or sadness as g\nis saying and gee's question really is\nyou know how do you come to an\nunderstanding so that you're\nnot feeling that anymore either of you\nwould love for you to answer that\ni'll let the psychiatrist answer that\nrock paper scissors\n[Laughter]\nall right so first of all that that\nquestion\nis in many ways a central question to\nalmost\nall people who are seeking mental health\nhelp right\nand it's\nand i wish i had a perfect answer but\nit kind of relates to what happened to\nthat person\nso the place at which you want to try to\nhelp somebody repair and\nredevelop a capability or a connection\nhas to kind of match where they had the\nloss\nso the way you would do therapeutic work\nfor example\nwith somebody who had the loss of a\nparent at age three\nand all kinds of transitions after that\nwould be very different than someone who\nhad a comparable experience at age 17.\nand so not to sound like a politician\nbut it kind of depends a treatment\napproach\nbroadly depends upon where you are\ndevelopmentally and when all this stuff\nhappened\nbut in general no matter what happened\nno matter when it happened\nthe vehicle for providing\nthe therapeutic experiences that will\nhelp you\nis the relationship and so it really\nalways is relationships and\nthe beauty of it is most\ntherapeutic change takes place outside\nof conventional therapy\nit takes place in these little present\ncaring moments with friends with family\nwith coaches with teachers\nthe other people and this is why\nyour relational density matters you know\nif you live\nin an environment where there's a lot of\npeople you're connected to\nyou know a church home like we write\nabout in the book if you're connected to\na sports team if you're connected to\nyour classmates and there's some\nduration to the other relationships you\nhave in your life you have this in\nbuilt-in therapeutic web where you can\ngo through a healing process that is not\nnecessarily\ntraditional therapy and i think oprah\nyou know\npart of what you talk about in this book\nis that you've had these\nhealing moments over the course of your\nlife\nand um and you know gail's\nbeen one of the people who's been\ninvolved in that but other people as\nwell right\nyeah yeah i've never had i've never had\na day of therapy\ni had all my therapy in front of the\naudience during all those years the\noprah show\nand i realized in writing this book with\ndr perry that\nactually gail was my regulation\nthat i would come home after a show get\non the phone with gail\ntalk about my day that's how i regulated\nand\ncalmed and released and then get in the\ntub go to sleep start the whole process\nall over again so having somebody who\nfully sees you\nwho cares about you makes a world of\ndifference\nno matter who you are and so like as i\nsay i\ni never had therapy uh but i had a lot\nof people\nwho i was in relationship with who saw\nme\nfor who i was for that little girl in\nthe fourth grade my first\nyou know experience with my fourth grade\nteacher was the first time i ever felt\nlike\nwow she gets me\nand i could not wait every day to get to\nschool\njust to be in front of mrs duncan who\nreally\ngot me you know and uh one of the things\ni think\nthat is that i learned from the writing\nof this book with bruce\nis uh is what he says on page\n109 and that is\nuh first 108 109. the timing of\nadversity makes a huge difference in\ndetermining overall risk which is what\nhe was just saying\nthe difference between being 17 and\nbeing three when something happens\nand also this thing struck me so much\njay\nthat if in the first two months of life\na child experienced high adversity with\nminimal relational buffering\nbut was then put into a healthy\nenvironment for the next 12 years\ntheir outcomes were worse than the\noutcomes of children\nwho had low adversity and healthy\nrelational connection in the first two\nmonths but then spent the next 12 years\nwith high adversity\nwhich is to say the child who is only\ntwo months of really bad experiences\ndoes worse than the child with almost 12\nyears years of bad experiences\nall because of the timing of the\nexperience\nthat's so huge isn't it that's so huge\nthe reason that's so huge\nis because people do terrible things\nterrible things in front of their young\nchildren\nthey say horrible things in front of\ntheir young\nchildren they fight in front of their\nyoung children i've talked to so\nmany women who were involved in domestic\nviolent relationships who were waiting\nfor their kids to get older before they\nmoved\nand not realizing that most of the\ndamage\nwill already have been done because that\nsame part of the brain that allows you\nto\nrecognize mama versus daddy and colors\nand all of that that's being formed in\nthe early\nearly early earliest months of your life\nthat br\nthat same part is taking in\nvibrationally\nsocially not having the language\nbut taking all of that in and the\nsynapse either forms in a certain way\nthat protects you for the rest of your\nlife or does not\nthat's why if nobody gets anything else\nfrom this book\nthat's what i hope the world understands\nthat what you're saying in front of your\nyoungest youngest youngest youngest\nchildren causes lifelong\nissues and this you know\nto sort of take off on that jay this is\none of the reasons that\nhigh quality home visitation programs\nthat really help take care of young\nvulnerable families\nso that when they're at this crucial\nperiod in life\nin the first year of life that they've\ngot\nsome of supports and they've g they are\ngetting the parents getting regulated so\nhe or she can be present in the lives of\nthese children in ways that will be\nlikely to improve development and lead\nthe resilience as opposed to\nstruggle and struggle and struggle and\nresult in increased vulnerability\nand it's such a small investment\ncompared to the way we spend money now\non these\nkids and that struggle as they get older\nand older and older\nand uh you know that's why i you know\ni'm active in uh\norganizations that do home visiting like\nhealthy families america and prevent\nchild abuse america they they\nyou know they for years have been\nputting these high quality programs in\nplace to really help\nsupport young young parents\ni'm so happy that in what happened to\nyou you're both magnifying and\nand simplifying such deep\nresearch and work into the simplicity of\nwhat your children see at this time what\nthey experience what they hear what they\nfeel is going to impact them and it's\nthat simple for all of us to learn to\nunderstand to digest\nand using that example of an extreme\nstory i mean\nyou know one of my the most imp\ninspiring stories in the book\nis about a four-year-old girl called ali\nuh dr perry who you worked with\nand she witnessed if i'm not mistaken\nthe death of a mother by the hands of\nher father\nwho then committed suicide and\nyou know she went through so many\ndifferent experiences after that\ni wanted to ask you actually where is\nshe now have you kept in touch with her\ndo you know how she's\nevolved through that journey she is\nactually\na very healthy young adult woman\nwho um is giving back to her community\nshe's caring and compassionate i mean it\nreally is one of those stories that\nyou're like wow\nthis is a young woman who through the\nlove and support of her\nextended family and community which\nreally\nthat's how she helped he was able to\nheal\num ended up with what we end up we talk\nabout post-traumatic wisdom in the book\nthat that you know a lot of people when\nthey think about trauma and\nin the effects of trauma they focus on\nall the negative things which definitely\ncan happen there's definitely risk\nbut you can actually\nlearn from these experiences grow from\nfrom these experiences and\nyou figure out ways to carry the pain\nthat don't interfere with your\nability to be loving to be productive to\nbe creative and in fact in many\ncases i think that that pain becomes\nfuel for the productivity and the\ncreativity\nso there's so much hope say that i say\nthat to gia\nwho had just asked a question about\nprocessing that anger\nfirst of all understand where it comes\nfrom and a lot of times people are\ndoing what i did you know in in the\nboardroom\nyou know having anxiety about\nconfronting somebody because\nthat's triggering uh pain from the past\nyes and a lot of people in their\neveryday\ninteractions aren't even mad at what\nthey think they're mad about they're\njust being\ntriggered by something from the past so\ntrue that is going on with so\nso so so many people so being able to\nunderstand that is is\nis really crucial what i love about the\nali story\nthere's the extreme that there is so\nmuch hope that if there's anyone who's\nwatching and thinking\ni've seen too much or my children have\nseen too much or experienced too much\nthere is still so much hope right that's\nwhat i'm hearing from\nboth of you and through this book well i\nsay that for my own life i say first of\nall the ability to be\nhonest about it i think that\nthe the in the many cases where i've\nseen where people suffer\nis when they are in denial about what\nhappened to them in the past\nor they want to create a facade around\nwhat happened to them in the past\nthe thing that has been the most freeing\nto me is being able to be truthful about\nit\nto own it and to not only own it\nbut to use it as leverage\nfor growth for myself you know the thing\nthat i didn't get in in growing up\nis what i most wanted to give as an\nadult\nand so there's a beautiful uh uh a\nspiritual that we sing in the black\nchurch\ni wouldn't take nothing for my journey\nnow\nfor my journey now for my journey now\nand i think maya angelou even wrote a\nbook called wouldn't take nothing for my\njourney now based upon\nthat hymn and that's how i feel about my\nlife and i want everybody else\nto embrace that for their own that\neverything that has happened\nto you can also be\na strength builder for you\nif you allow it and you take that\npain once you have acknowledged what it\nis and\nwhere it came from and the people who\ndid whatever they did to you\nthat is the past and how you're willing\nto now take that pain\nand use it as your own personal power is\nwhat post-traumatic wisdom is all about\nso you don't have to continually live\nin the past you can step up and out of\nyour history jay\nand let that be your platform to begin\nto build strength over strength over\nstrength which in in the end equals\npower for yourself\nthat was beautiful that was so wonderful\nto hear you say that that\nwhat has happened to you uh once you've\nprocessed it\nand actually understood it and unpacked\nit that it can actually transform into\nbeing for you and and become your\nstrength\nthat that pain can actually become your\npurpose and your\nservice uh as we see in ali's case dr\nperry\nwhere she was actually able to turn that\ninto service and support and care\nfor others i mean that's that's truly\ntruly\nphenomenal and of course oprah in your\ncase that's what we're hearing\nas well uh what i'm hearing there and\nyou talk about this in a chapter\nis the difference between coping and\nhealing\ni think a lot of us right now are trying\nto cope\nwe're trying to cope cope it's something\nwe always say like i'm coping with it\ni'm dealing with it we always say coping\nand dealing\nrarely or do we ever shift i'm healing\nit right i'm working through it\ntell us about that difference uh dr\nperry\nin the brain and what's happening and\noprah through your experience\nmaybe stories of times when you felt you\nwere just coping with it\nto when you actually started healing it\nyeah i it's interesting i had a\nconversation i've been having a lot of\nconversations with people in education\nabout transition back to the new normal\nand\none of the things that's very apparent\nis what we talked about earlier that\neverybody's kind of worn out\nand the needs of some of these children\nhave increased and some of the families\nare struggling more\nand the people who used to step in and\nhelp them are now\nworn out and so what i've been trying to\nencourage people to do\nis actually think of this period of time\nas treading water\nyou just need to learn how to tread\nwater there's sometimes when you just\nyou don't know exactly which direction\nshore is\nso don't just swim aimlessly just tread\nwater\nand get yourself sort of your bearings\nagain\nkind of refresh oprah talked about it\nyou can't you should\none of the things is this upside down\nbrain\nthe more distressed you get the more you\nshut down the top part of the brain and\nso\nyou're not thinking very well you're not\nreally\nreasoning in a way that will lead to a\ngood set of solutions so\nyou need to learn how to cope which is\nbasically treading water get yourself\nregulated get yourself refreshed get\nyourself reconnected to people who can\nhelp you and then\nyou'll carefully look around and you'll\nsee the horizon and you go i'm swimming\nthis this direction then you can start\nthe\nhealing process but all too often\n[Music]\nwe spend a lot of time swimming in\nfrantically in circles and we're not\nwe're not connected and regulated the\nway that we should be\nwell i will say this also we were\ntalking about how rhythm is so important\nhowever you bring rhythm into your life\nwhether it's taking a walk or whether\nit's dancing or\num one of the most important things\ni have learned with coping is to accept\nthis moment for what it\nis do not spend your energy\npushing again and that's whether you are\nlate\nin traffic or whether you are late on\nyour bills and you don't know where the\nnext\nuh paycheck is coming from to do it\ndon't spend your energy\nresisting what is you know\nthe five stages of grief begin with\nshock and denial\nand end with acceptance i have found\nthat to be a great formula for operating\nin any crisis\nor challenging circumstance get to\nacceptance as quickly as you can\nand that will allow you to cope better\nwith this\npresent moment because when you are\npushing against i wish it wasn't this\nway i mean i've seen so many people\nduring\nthis pandemic last march\ncan't i can't wait until this is over\nthat was last\nmarch now we're a year later and they've\nspent the year\nin resistance instead of ah\nthis is where we are not so sure when\nwe're gonna get to shore\ni just better learn how to tread\nstronger oh my legs are getting stronger\nin the tread\nso being able to accept the treading\nmoment for what it\nis and and having the wisdom\nthe faith the understanding the knowing\nthat you're not going to be in this\nmoment forever because if life does\nanything\nit consistently consistently changes\nso for however long we're in this\npandemic\nmoment it is not going to be forever but\nhow do i make the adjustment to accept\nthe moment for what it is and stop\npushing against it\nusing all of my energy wanting it to be\nsomething that it's not\nit's that whole adage of accepting the\nthings you can change\nand being willing to live with the\nthings you cannot\nso that has been the most helpful for me\ni don't have a problem coping because i\nimmediately go to\nthis is what it is now what must i do\nto be fully present in this moment not\nresisting and pushing against it\ni love that so much as all the wisdom\ntraditions tell us\nlike holding on to our normal\ncauses us more pain than letting go and\naccepting\nwhere we are today yeah and i want to i\njust want to thank\neveryone who's been listening and\nwatching today to
