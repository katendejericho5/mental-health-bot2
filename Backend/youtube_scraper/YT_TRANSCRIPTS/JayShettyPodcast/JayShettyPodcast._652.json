i\nthought about this and i'll be honest\nwith you when\nwe're researching guests and we're\ngetting the bio together and i'm picking\nout what to say and i i read that and i\nliterally said to julian\ni said to him when we were looking at it\ni was just like i'm going to say all of\nit because she deserves it i'm going to\nsay all of it and there's so much more\nbut i was like i wanted you

watch so check it out but\nit is it is it's very vulnerable\ni will say i'm very exposed literally\nand figuratively and\nspiritually so you get to see more of a\njourney and more of like my growth as\nlike a human being but also\nas a character and it kind of like\nparallels my real life of me\nstepping into my power and so does my\ncharacter so i'm excited for that that's\namazing\ni love that and i love how much of when\ni've been watching it i love how much of\nyou is infused into the character\nyes like it doesn't help yeah no but\nit's it's so\nit's still done so uniquely like so

a\nbunch of other amazing\nmagicians and cooks in the kitchen so\ni'm just blessed to have this like\namazing family that's willing to uplift\nthis story that hasn't really been told\nso\nor at least told from my perspective so\ni'm excited yeah absolutely thank you\nwe were just talking about starting off\nwith compliments and i have the like\ni'm like you know i was nervous because\nmy first podcast i'm trying to do my\nmost\nsoothing voice possible sounds like an\noff-grand beyonce right now\nhey y'all how y'all doing but i look\nlike crazy cardi b\nright now like if cardi b was raised at\ndisneyland or something\nif you're watching the visual i'm\nwearing many colors every color in the\npantone book i swear\nso we have eliza crossing cardi b and\nbeyonce in this part\nfor one three for one baby is amazing no\nand this is your first podcast this is\nmy first party which\nwhich i felt so humbled and honored by i\nwas like wow like thank you\noh so grateful it is an honor to be on\nyours i can't tell you like how many\ntimes i've been in my times of weakness\nand i felt empowered and strengthened\nthrough your words and through your\nshares\non instagram i always say like you know\nfeed your feed with things that\ngenuinely feed you\nand genuinely is a word that's thrown\naround a lot but you are genuinely one\nof the most\namazing like enlightening souls that\ni've like\never come across and this is like our\nfirst time like hanging out too\nso you're watching this like full-on\nfull\nconversation that we've never had before\njust like on camera with each other so\ni'm excited but\num yeah yeah i i appreciate everything\nthat you've done you\nyou helped me through a really tough\ntime and i'm grateful to be here today\nto thank you in person\nand i'm here for you i'm totally here\nfor you anytime any you know any time\nand\nand uh i'm i was so touched by dimension\nin the wall street journal and so many\nother places it's not even that like i\njust\ni wanted to say that like i think this\nis who you are and this is where i want\nto start with how this conversation has\nalready gone because it's turned into a\nconfidence\nalready i want to stop this i actually\nhave some questions i wanted to ask\nwhich i will get to yeah\nbut but but i want to point this out\nbecause i think it's important to\ntestament to who you are\nlike like you said this the first time\nwe're like sitting down face to face\nhaving our conversation\nyou could have said anyone but you still\nsaid me and you've you've mentioned so\nmany wonderful things about me and i'm\njust like\nthis is the most beautiful thing about\nsomething like you're saying it when we\nhaven't even had this moment to sit down\ntogether\nand so anyway the feelings we're gonna\nstop complimenting each other\nyou will not hear a compliment for the\nrest of this podcast both of our egos\nare boosted yeah we are good to\ngo yeah exactly like now that now that\nwe've got that out the way like we're\ngonna we're gonna ask\nserious interview questions i wanna\nstart off i wanna start off with\nsomething and i wanna dive into the\nmaking of the show and everything but i\nwanna start off with something that i\nthink is\nimportant to what you've touched on it's\nimportant to how you've spoken about it\nand you said this and it's really\npowerful when you returned from your\nsocial media break\nyou said that it was the first time that\nyou felt successful\nyeah and when i heard that i was just\nlike wow like\nwhat happened in that time yeah like\nwe've just read your resume you know\neveryone knows your accomplishments but\nyou said that that was the first time\nyou felt successful what happened in\nthat time\nwhere people were like where liza was\nlike now i feel successful\nyeah okay well everybody has their own\ndefinition of success right\nand my definition of success although it\nmay sound selfish it's not\nthe feeling of joy and happiness that\nresides in that quiet confidence that\nresides in myself and i was always a\nvery\nbig kind of obnoxious like real loud\npersonality who like\ncomes out in different forms and has\nexplored myself creatively in different\nforms whether it be through hosting or\nacting or whatever it may be\num or whatever inspires me in that time\nbut i i\nwas finding myself i created this box or\nthis rectangle if you will\num of you know my youtube videos and all\nthese characters and personas that i\ni put on and that i created for myself\num and i'll get more into that later\nbecause there's reasons why i created\nall those personas and i\ndeveloped this level of awareness that\ni'm like oh that's why i made that\nbecause i needed that\ni'll get into that but i i literally\ncreated this\nthis rectangle and people knew me they\ncreated a definition around me\num as to what i do or or what i create\nand\ni had to break out of that so you think\nof like a you know a kid on disney\nchannel right and that network created\nyou know\nwhat that character is in that show and\nwhat the messages are trying to convey\nin that show\num and then when that person as a human\nbeing naturally grows and evolves they\nbecome\nyou know their themselves or whatever\nversion they may become\nand that's like a that's like a role you\nbreak out of now i created my own\nand so to break out of that and become\nthis host or become this actress was\nme you know experimenting creatively\noutside of what people knew me to be\nand so i made this definition i allowed\nthem to define me and then i was\nredefining myself in that time that i\ntook away\nand i allowed myself to breathe allowed\nmyself to be whatever it i may be\nwithin that day or 10 minutes forever\nchanging and ever evolving and there was\na point where i was\nyou know kind of stunting myself and\nholding myself back from\nbecoming and now i've become myself\nourselves so now my whole thing is like\nnot only be yourself because right we\ngot we know that cliche we know that\nlike yes\nbe yourself whoever that may be but now\nit's plural be yourselves\nwhatever you may identify as and\nwhatever you\nare drawn to and and want to become so\nin that time there's a lot of growth and\na lot of like spiritual awakening my\nforehead always hurts because my third\neye is seeing things now\nyeah but it's been fun and i'm i'm so\ngrateful to my audience for\nallowing me to have that break and\nallowing me to\nbe a human instead of you know the\ncharacter the persona that i created\nonline\nyeah i love that be yourselves be\nyourselves i love that so that's almost\nlike giving your permission to be more\nthan one thing be more than one thing\nidentify as many you are\nyou know i i in the industry i'm this\nhost or i'm this actress or i'm\non this personality whatever that may be\nin your in your real life it's\nwho you are at work who you are at\nchurch who you are at you know whatever\nyou wherever you may go\nyou are these different versions of\nyourself and allowing yourself to be\nand accept yourself yourselves\ni love that yeah that's such great\nadvice i think you're so right that we\nget\nso caught up in our definition of what\nwe think we should be\nand then we get caught up in the\ndefinition of what everyone thinks we\nshould be\ni think it's i think it's the japanese\nsay we have three faces\nso the first face is the face that we\nshow to the world the second\nface is the face that we show to people\nthat are closer to us and the third face\nis the face we show to no one else\nthose are the three faces and i'm sure\nthere's multiple other layers of that\nbut it's interesting what you're saying\nis actually like embrace all of them\nyeah\nembrace all of them and that face that\nyou don't show to the world is the\nhardest to show but i think it's like\nit's what the industry needs and it's\nwhat you do essentially is like is\nshowing the world that it's okay to be\nwho you are behind the curtain but in\nfront of it as well like that's that's\nthe most exciting most vulnerable most\nrelatable part that you can be\nis like accepting of your feelings and\nyour emotions that's the hardest part\nbut is\nit's what we need so i'm thankful for it\nthat's so beautiful and compliments are\nnow over so yeah\ncalm down all right i get it i have a\nwhole podcast\nvery successful actually keep listening\njust want to come\ni love it and i love what you're saying\nearlier like this that really got me\nthinking and i didn't know that you were\nsaying that\nyou started to realize that you built\ncharacters\nto express certain feelings or because\nof what you were going through yeah\ntake us through that because i think\nthat's fascinating oh thank you\ni mean i didn't know i was crazy and\nthen i found out as i had this like\nlevel of awareness you hit your 20s man\nthat\nhit me like a brick i ran straight into\na wall when i hit my 20s and i'm\ngrateful for that wall because it\nallowed me to stop and like\npull back and listen um to what i was\ndoing into myself into the world\nso i created these crazy characters one\nbecause i'm a real good looking man\ni look good in a bowl cut and that is a\nhard thing to achieve\nhis name was jet or his name is still\njet he's still with us i sounded like he\ndied\nhe's fine he's doing well he's thriving\num but yeah no he\nwas this character that i created a\nlittle bowl cut a little mustache\num always wearing black he looks real\ndapper he thinks he's\nfantastic at everything but he kind of\nsucks but he has this like\nunspoken also very loudspoken confidence\nof like\ni i can't do anything and i embody you\nknow uh\nmy truth always which is that i'm great\nand i believe in that\neven if you know physically i can't\nprove that so he's really bad at sports\nhe can't do a single thing he's awful\nhe's the world's greatest olympian in\nhis book but in everybody else's he's\njust crazy\nbut he he was basically what i needed so\ni needed\nthat that confidence that just like\nentire like\nalmost delusional belief in oneself and\nthat's i forget who said it it's\nprobably somebody on this\nvery inspiring wall but someone said you\nhave to be a bit delusional oh it was\nit was yeah ali he said you have to be a\nbit delusional in order to believe\nin yourself that nothing has ever been\ndone before that you\nare able to provide the world and so i\ni created this jet to be this branch of\nconfidence that i needed and that was a\nform of myself that\nsometimes you step into that power of\nconfidence and you're not sure what the\nhell you're doing\nbut you look you're confident doing it\num and you're just leaning into fear\ninstead of you know letting it control\nyou but yeah\nthen this other version was helga who's\na very like maternal figure she is uh\nshe's from somewhere she sounds a bit\nlike this i don't know where she's from\ni say she's not from anywhere so i don't\noffend anyone hello\n[Laughter]\nthere you go she's just she's from the\nworld she's cultured she just picked up\nan accent she's actually just you know\nfrom minnesota\nbut she was this like maternal figure i\nmoved out at 19\nand i didn't have my mom in my life in\nl.a um and i had her blessing to move\nout here\nbut i didn't have the guidance that you\nknow i wanted or craved\nso i created her and she was you know\nthe\nvery outspoken confidence too of like\nknowing and being sure\nin her word and what she believes so\nthat's who i created for that\nand then this little liza is this young\nversion of myself\nthat has you know she's kind of unaware\nshe's innocent\nshe ignorance is bliss kind of thing and\nwe all have this inner child in which\nwe embrace at times but sometimes\nsometimes we also shove down we don't\nwant to be\ntoo crazy too big or wear too many\ncolors at the same time\num and and that's what little liza was\nfor me she allowed me to\nembrace you know the the younger\ncharacteristics of myself\nand and it was me not wanting to step\ninto adulthood either i'll tell you that\nmy midlife crisis she was holding me\nback from me you know what i'm saying\nso i created her in order to allow\nmyself to play and we should all just\nbe allowed to play and have fun and not\nyou know conform to whatever\nsociety may be saying they want to see\num but then\nyeah those are my characters and they're\nall different branches of me and so\ni created all of them and now i'm kind\nof bringing them all together as one\nwhich is just me\nand that's the lies that we see on live\nzone demand and that's liza you see on\nlives on demand is her like\nyou know being a little confused about\nwhat to do with her career but um\nthank you for tying it back into the\nshow god dang you are good at this\num you see that that version of me that\nlike\nis is embodying everything and embracing\neverything about herself so\nyeah yeah i love that i'm so glad that\nyou shared that because i think\nand i'm guessing when you actually\ncreated them you didn't know that no i\nhad no idea it's in hindsight\nnow that you've reflected and you've\nlooked at those roles and you've been\nlike oh that's why i did that\nand i love that because what you're\nsaying is so true there's two things i\nwant to point out to the audience which\nyou've just done here is\nwhen you look at what ali said is like\nali said that you know he said he was\nthe greatest before he was\nyeah and so that's exactly the point of\nlike he was saying that to convince\nhimself not really to convince anyone\nelse\nbut then going through that process he\ndid become yeah and in the same way\nsteve jobs had something called reality\ndistortion field\nso that's where you're creating a almost\nnot slightly delusional but a\naspirational version\nyeah of who you want to be yeah and\nyou're creating it so that you can then\nbecome that\nand then martin luther king used to put\non glasses yeah so todd herman who i\ninterviewed and\nwrote the book the alter ego effect he\ntalked about how martin luther king used\nto wear glasses\nbecause they made him feel more\nconfident me and martin luther king have\nso much in common\ni mean like i actually have i didn't\nwear them today because i just want to\nlike look you directly in the eye but i\nhave a pair of fake glasses that i wear\nall the time no wait that's right\nbecause it makes me feel like so much\nmore like regal and like do you read\nthem to meetings and stuff i wear them\nto meetings\nbecause i feel like they take me more\nseriously you see like a little five\nfoot gnome waddle into the office you're\nlike well i'm going to listen to this\nthis is going to tell me an idea a good\nidea and i put my glasses on and i\nbecome just like hey yeah i got some\nthings to say i've seen the world and\nlet me tell you about it\nlike you're mine is the gig being the\nking yeah it's amazing\ni have dreams too i love it no but and\nthis and that's something i wanted to\ntalk about there like\none thing i get from speaking to you\ntoday and obviously courtney\nwho we both love yes and and when she\ntalks about you to me\nand from what i've observed i i think of\nanyone who's\nanything that you've accomplished\nexternally but also just the person that\nyou are\ni think i'm trying really hard not to\ncompliment you i know as i talk about\nthis\nsay what you love about me but the thing\ni find is that\ni don't think people should\nunderestimate people based on their age\nor their professional experience because\ni'm like when i see what you've\nachieved externally in terms of\neverything we talked about\nand who i see you as a human and just\nhow you've just reflected on how you\ncreated roles\nlike that's not a i don't know about the\ntime i took a year off youtube man i had\na lot of time to think\nand journal and meditate you know yeah\nbut it's like that reflection is super\nmature\nlike people don't realize for decades\nthat they've been creating personas to\nplay and not knowing who they are\nand figuring out their identity like\nthat's something we do for our whole\nlives and so i think\nanyone who's judging someone or\nquestioning someone's ideas when they're\nwalking through their room because of\nhow they look\nand how they dress and how old they are\ni mean that needs to go for sure that\nneeds to go for sure\ndon't judge a book by its cover because\nthere's a whole story on the inside that\nyou're about to find out if you're\nwilling to listen yeah yeah and how have\nyou\nhow have you dealt with that with like\nyou know you're creating shows you're\nhosting shows like\nhow have you dealt with that to be able\nto display without having to like defend\nyourself\nyeah because i feel like you do that\npretty well display defend there's\nanother d\nword i say disarm so i immediately\nthat's my\nmy favorite thing to do is like disarm\nand that's what i use my humor for is i\ni either compliment what you just did by\nthe way thank you for all those\ncompliments that you said you weren't\ngoing to give any more of\nyou either you the compliment or you\ndisarm you allow them to know like yo\nwe're all just here\nwe have really cool jobs and like what\nwe're doing is a blessing to do every\nday so\nto walk in and just immediately like yo\njust let's set the temperament now let's\nlet's enjoy ourselves let's have a good\ntime let's let's you know acknowledge\nthe world around us and and the fact\nthat we're living this life is so cool\nso\nthat's that's my go-to um when walking\ninto a meeting that i'm feeling nervous\nabout\num because that's what i want for\nsomebody to do for me i want them to\nmake me feel comfortable so\nallowing someone complimenting someone\nis making them feel comfortable and who\nthey are and like taking\na second to acknowledge and notice what\nthey've done to themselves whatever that\nbe\num but yeah so i think for me it's just\nstepping in and being bold and being\nconfident and being that version of\nmyself i tap into my\nmy jet or i put in my put on my glasses\nand\ni allow myself to firmly believe that i\nhave something to say\nand you know if you're receptive and\nyou're ready to listen then you're in\nyour place and if you're not\nand you want to shut down that idea then\nthat's all right i forgive you you\nthere's\nthere's something that you're working\nthrough and when you work past it maybe\nyou will see\nhopefully i pray for you more clearly\nyeah i love that\nthat's awesome don't display or defend\ndisarm\nyeah i think that's beautiful i think\nthat's such a thank you\ni've i've never thought about it like\nthat like i i almost feel like i've\npracticed some of it i've never really\nconsciously\nunderstood that in that word awareness i\nthink that yeah and i think you've just\nmade me conscious of and you've woken me\nup to it's beautiful it's like\nthat's such a powerful point that i\nthink if we can always\nlook when we walk into meetings or we\nwalk into an interaction or anything to\ndisarm\neveryone so that we can allow ourselves\nto be more ourselves\nsure i think i think that's beautiful i\nthink that's such a great practical\ntakeaway because i think we all get so\nlost in\nwe always walk into a meeting and feel\nlike i'm gonna have to defend myself\ntoday i'm gonna have to like stand up\nfor like\ni'm i'm i'm there so we start looking at\nall of our things that people could pick\nout like i'm going to\nbuild myself up or we go like i'm going\nto show what i'm good at i'm going to\ndisplay and i just\nthat's a huge takeaway for me yeah\nthat's massive yeah i'm going to teach\nyou one thing\nyou've taught me so many like how many\nposts you have on instagram\nyeah that many things you've taught me\nthat many things and more now you just\nworked me up to i think that's a huge\npoint i just think if we can walk into\nevery interaction in our lives\nyeah and think how can i disarm the\nother person and disarm myself\nhumanize you human humans yeah that's\nbeautiful yeah hey thanks man that's\nwhat i love to do is just like\nmake you feel comfortable in whatever\nheightened or relaxed environment that\nyou're in like this is\nso relaxing to be here and just talking\nto you it's definitely it's different\nthan met gal for sure\njust to brush the brush and dirt off my\nshoulder i mean you were doing all the\ninterviews on matt geller standing on\nlike this\npodium right that wasn't powering in\nitself that was empowering i'm five feet\ntall i was wearing four inch heels i was\nfive four but\nthey still needed more and you had to\nwait for everyone to walk the whole\ncarpet\nand you were standing there as like the\ngatekeeper ready but you were amazing\neveryone seemed to love talking to you\nthank you thank you\nwho was the conversation that you\nremember that kind of left an impact\nyeah i mean i have to say i love stephen\ncolbert\nso like last year was my first year\ndoing that gala this year i kind of like\ncame back and and felt more comfortable\nand in my power for sure\nbut uh last year i just geeked out over\nstephen colbert and from that i was\ninvited to be on his show which was\namazing and it was just a chain reaction\nof\nfortunate events yeah so it was it was\ncool but uh he\nhe just you know he has a platform and i\nthink he uses it in amazing ways and he\ndoes the same disarming so i'm just\ninspired by\npeople i watch all the time and yeah\nyeah it was cool but let me think who\nelse\num it's wonderful just like seeing\npeople this year especially\nthe the theme was camp yeah so you could\ngo as hard as you wanted to and i had\na whole pocket full of like could have\nbeen hot cheetos that i was selling on\nthe side\nwhich i'm sure people would have\nappreciated because inside you just get\none chicken breast which\nyeah just a chicken breast and a little\nscoop grains\ni think uh anna winter's paleo uh she\nwas ensuring everybody else was\nfollowing her diet\num but no i had a like my arm was\nmissing so my arm was inside this giant\npocket the whole time it was just like\nflaccid in there the whole time and\ndidn't see the sunlight\num it's a little more pale to this day\num\nbut it was cool because everybody was\njust expressing themselves and like they\nwere decorating their spirit that day or\ntheir soul that day which i like to say\nbecause they were just\nhaving fun and being who they are and\nembracing it so it was fun yeah it's\nawesome i remember you describing\nlady gaga's outfit changes on the carpet\ni was like this is brilliant like i was\njust because you can see it from afar\nand you're like you're going through the\nmotions that everyone got to go through\non the pictures afterwards but\ni think you did an awesome job and and i\nlove how again like i i think\nyou are constantly giving everyone who's\nlistening everyone who watches you are\npermission to be themselves because you\nalways are\nlike i just don't see you change in in\ndifferent\nforums and different you know whether\nit's the streamies\nwhere i first met you last year or\nwhether it's you know the met gala\nwhatever like you're always\nemanating who you are and i think that\nthat's a beautiful thing i think\nholding on to that at such a young age\nlike you're only 23 years old\nand i think that's amazing that you've\njust been able to really understand\nyourself and be comfortable in your own\nskin\nand i'm glad it looks like that that's\nwhat i'm saying i think i might be a\ngood actress because\nbecause i am you're i became comfortable\nwith being uncomfortable\nand i love the skin i'm in but i'm\nalways trying to understand what exactly\nis inside so that\nthat willingness to be open and accept\nwhatever may come out yeah well that's\nit\nthat's what's beautiful about it like\nthat's even more powerful what you've\njust said there like you're constantly\ntrying to understand\nlike that constant like awareness and\nactualization going on is what people\nneed to do\nyeah i love that amazing awesome well\ntell me\ntell me about what i was really\nfascinated by is like obviously you've\ndone all of this great social media work\nlike you've you know\nan amazing platform amazing audience\npeople\nlove you like you know and and it's just\nwhat i was fascinated by is then you go\nand create a show\nand and as i was pointing out earlier to\nme\nit's another level like the writing is\nincredible the scripting is incredible\nthe\nyou know all the jokes and the punch\nlines the character style the\nthe other characters that are involved\nwhich is different to you being\ncharacters it's now you\ninteracting yeah with real other people\nwhich is different from your work\ntell me about the process of actually\nbuilding a show oh man because i feel\nlike\nit's a massive undertaking i mean\nbuilding a youtube audience on youtube\nis hard enough\nbut then to like transition tell us\nabout that transition\nhow much time do we have um okay so\nbasically i hope you like the sound of\nmy voice by the way just checking in mid\npodcast\nbecause i've been talking a lot and i\nappreciate you guys listening i was\nactually to say you have a great podcast\nvoice\nthank you if you ever want to you know\nstart a podcast i'll be back\nyou were saying that on the phone\nyesterday like a podcast is a great way\nto make friends you wanted to have deep\nconversations\nwith people literally yeah i've\nliterally been\nlike i've said to a few people like i'd\nlove to hang out and they're like yeah\ni'd love to too and i'm like uh can you\ncome on my podcast i'm like oh yeah when\ndo you want me to come on\ni'm like great like but no i i do\nbelieve that\npodcasts are very intimate conversations\nand\nit's a chance to go vulnerable quicker\nyeah and\ni can ask whatever i feel like on a\npodcast truth\nand sometimes when you're off off camera\nor off micro\nyou can't you don't always feel like you\ncan yeah but on a partner you know\nwhatever and like so anyway but yeah i\nlove that i love that sorry my add\nkicked in what was the question again\nthe question was i'm just trying to i\nguess there's two parts to this question\nlet me break it down the first part of\nthe question is\nwhat do you think people misunderstand\nabout the life of a creator\nlike i want to understand like how\nchallenging it is\nto do what you've done like you know all\nthe kind of the process it's taken to\nbuild the social platform\nyeah and then the second part of the\nquestion is i want to hear that\nhow how interesting the transition was\nfrom\nsocial media to them building a show\nyeah right yeah\nokay so i will say the life of a creator\nis\nan interesting one it's you you don't\nget bored you definitely\nthere is no idle mind i will say you are\nyou are constantly working and it\ndepends what kind of content you're\ncreating right so\nwe have vlogs that are out there you\nhave your scripted content that's out\nthere you have just\npodcasts i mean you have you have it all\nso from\nfor myself i i started off doing\nvlogging and i enjoyed that but i wanted\nto like build i wanted some kind of like\nstructure some kind of you know formula\nmethod to my madness if you will\nand i i created all these scripts and\nall these characters right\nand so that was me literally dragging\naround a tripod in my room and\nfinding lighting and just googling\neverything how do i what camera does\nwhat and what what does this so starting\noff from scratch and creating kind of my\nown\ni didn't know what it was but my\nproduction company and that's what i was\ndoing\nbut really for me it was just like\ncreating videos and having fun and being\nthis\nthese versions of myself and putting\nmyself out there um and little did i\nrealize i was acting too i just didn't\nknow\neven though i was looking at a white\nlike i just didn't know that me looking\nat a white wall\ndressing up as a different version of\nmyself was acting until like the label\nwas placed whenever i was like oh that's\nwhy does it feel so familiar when i do\nthis you know on set with other people\noh because i've been doing this alone in\nmy living room\nfor years you know making my own like\naudition and my own reels online well\nthat's what's so cool about social media\nis like\nyou create your own real your own resume\nonline so you can show the world what\nyou can do\nif placed in another environment or\ngiven another chance of some sort\nso that's what i was doing in in my own\nliving room and\ncreating that but it takes hours hours\nof\nscripting and and making sure the\nlanguage is right and you're trying to\nget the message across and\num you know costume changes on my own\nand switching to those characters and\ni'm\ni'm better at night i'm surprised i'm a\nhigh functioning human right now during\nthe day look at that\nit's probably because you got blackout\ncurtains yeah it feels like yeah yeah it\nfeels like night it was chill\num but i i filmed everything from like\nprobably i'll start at like 10 p.m and\ngo until 4 am and just\nchange into all these different\ncharacters because i just like was\nbetter on\nand and and more in a performance mode\nat night so\ni i did that and then i would go to\nsleep and i'd wake up and immediately\nstart editing and\nediting is the longest process takes\nlike\ndays and days that's why this is so\nbelieving i'm like you don't have to\nedit this really you just gotta chop\ninto these different angles hi\nhow you doing now you're on jay now\nyou're back homie\nwe're acknowledging the visuals guys for\nthose of you listening to the audio\num but yeah no i i i was you know\ntaking it too it took a very long time\nand i think that's what you see a\nfour-minute video but\nwhat went into that was four days or\nwhat went into that was a week\nin that 10-minute long video so like it\nthere's a lot that you don't see that\ngoes into making this one baby\nthere's a lot of parents not just two\nyeah yeah but in this case for my\nchannel it was just me i was just a\nsingle parent of all these babies i was\nmaking\nonline just taken care um and then\ni got to meet my other parents and i got\nto you know co-create\nand and that was exciting for me\nstepping into a different world of\ncreation\nwhen it comes to lies on demand and um\nyou know stepping into the writer's room\nand and being able to work with all\nthese mad geniuses who have\nthese stories and ideas and experiences\nthat i get to\nyou know throw into my show and and\nhave these bouncing around ideas and and\nit was just so fun to be collaborative\num\ncreating on what i did online was so fun\nand it was exciting but\nit was very isolating at the same time i\nwas on my own\nand i felt like i had to be on my own\nand that was the rectangle that i had to\nbreak out of\num or the box i say rectangle because\nthat's what you're watching on your\nphone right\nthat's how you're watching your little\nbaby movies so that's\nthat was me you know breaking out of\njust being\nthis solo act i did the opposite of what\nbeyonce did\ni found my destiny's child i created my\ndestiny\nwith others um and then we made children\ntogether so\nso i got to make this this whole show\nwith like all these\nincredible creatives and and for them to\nbe willing to work with me and put up\nwith me i'm so i'm so lucky because\nit was it was fun to produce and write\nand be in that writer's room for hours\ninstead of\nalone in my living room on the couch and\nand and being in production and figuring\nout how we're going to do this as a team\ninstead of me dragging around that\ntripod and they're both equally as\namazing and and those experiences made\nme who i am and gave me the experience\nand knowledge that i needed to\ntransition over into traditional\nquote-unquote traditional because i\nthink everything's just entertainment\nnow forget this traditional digital\nlet's blur that line thank you for\nsaying that yeah that's what i always\ntry to do\nno matter what i do in my career like i\nwant to blur that line like will smith's\ndoing like he's he will smith is my\nfavorite youtuber\nwhich is crazy that's wild right so to\nblur that line and just call it\nentertainment's exciting\num but yeah all of those experiences\nhelped me into\ninto this new one and i'm grateful for\nanybody who's willing to watch and join\nme on the journey as i evolve yeah 100\nwill all be watching for sure i want\neveryone who's listening to it thanks\nfor the views\nyeah yeah no i think everyone should\nwatch it just because i think it's\nit's what's interesting for all of us\nand especially those of you who have\nalready been a part of your audience for\nyears and those who are new\nto your audience it's like i think we're\ngetting the fortune of watching creators\nevolve\nlike that's special yeah like i'm like\ni'm not\nmeeting you or like people are not\nmeeting you when you\ngot your first big break people people\nare being able to watch the whole\njourney\nyeah the growth the evolution of someone\nand i'm like imagine you got to do that\nwith\nleonardo dicaprio imagine you got to do\nthat with leonardo is one of my favorite\npeople in the world like\njust like imagine you got to do that\nwith someone like you got to watch\nsomeone grow and evolve and\ntake the next step and you know all of\nthat stuff and i think that's special\nyeah to be able to have that with\nsomeone and so when i'm seeing you and\ni'm like you see vine and then you see\nyoutube and then you see like you've got\nyour own show and like\nthen you're hosting nickelodeon it's\nlike you're getting just like we're\ngetting to be a part of that\nand i think if all of us should be\nmaking the most of being a part of those\njourneys because those are stories you\nget to tell in the future\nyeah those are things that uh you know\nyou can't you can't join someone at\ntheir start of their journey ever again\nsure sure right and not like this is the\nstart of your journey at all but i mean\nlike\nno one's ever gonna get to be a part of\nthis part of your journey yeah without\nwatching it now\nyeah and you can always go back and\nwatch it and see where i came from and\nactually i've never deleted anything on\ninstagram never\never you can go back to my very first\npost you can go back to everything that\ni've ever created that's impressive go\nfind a vine i didn't have an option they\njust deleted the whole thing\nit just died you tried you tried to keep\nit alive i tried to give it up\ncouldn't i went over into youtube um but\nyeah no i\nit's exciting to see that whole journey\nand there was something that someone\nsaid to me that\ni believe it was someone that worked\nwith nicole kidman who\nwas you know we knew her as this movie\nactress and that she started doing big\nlittle lies\nand you know people were hesitant to\nwalk up to her as a movie actress like\nseeing them you're paying to see nicole\nkidman\non the big screen like there's this\nthere's this level of like there's a\nfilter in between\nyou and her like you feel like it's a\nyou can't touch her yeah um\nbut then when she was on big little lies\nshe stepped into the living room into\nthe homes of so many\nand apparently people would you know\ncome up to her and say i love your work\nand immediately\ngo in for a hug without asking nicole\nkidman can i give you a hug\nand it was just immediate connection and\nshe was confused by it because\nyou know to go from people not\nnot speaking to you for whatever reason\nand then to\nbeing a part of their family and sitting\ndown and being a part of their story\nshe was shocked by it because there's a\nlevel of comfort there now\nnow creators we are with you we are on\nthe toilet with you\nwe are in bed with you i have slept with\npeople i don't know about\nand it is and it's wild to me how\nintimate that experience is and how\nintimate it is to share\nyour story via vlogs or whatever and\nyou're seeing behind the curtain more\nthan ever now so it's exciting that's\nwhy all these celebrities too\nare wanting to get into youtube and show\nthe process\nso fingers crossed leonardo dicaprio has\na youtube channel\nyeah which will save the planet too i\nmean that would be the best yeah that'd\nbe so cool that would be so\ncool tell me about you you've said\nbefore that life has been and and when\ni'm\ni'm feeling your energy today and i'm\nsensing it's you're in a great place\nlike\nthings are exciting and every but you\nhave said before like you know life is\nlike equal parts joy equal parts pain\ntell me about that like what does that\nmean to you and and how do you\nprocess that and how does that help you\ngrow oh man\nyou i mean you wouldn't know the joy\nwithout the pain like i am\ni am full in my power right now and i\nfeel good and i feel proud of everything\nthat i've worked on and everything that\ni am and have become\num but there were many many times where\ni was just living in\nin shame and and you know spiraling of\nsorts\nof like who am i and and trying to\nidentify myself and what i am and what\ni'm doing and what i'm meant to do\nand i feel like that's a description of\nyour twenties\nit's so true it's just so true thank you\nthank you for sitting there i really\nlike i'm i'm ready for 2020. i think\ni'm going to tease a series that i don't\neven know if i'm going to do it but i\ncan't wait to be like in the 20s\nliving in the 20s but i work on it we'll\nfigure it out feel that guys still the\neditors\ni'm going to manifest please do i\nplease do it please do it i will i will\ntry because i\ni really want i wish there was some kind\nof guidance from my 20s outside of my\nsisters who have helped me so much\num shout out to them um but yeah they\nyou know it's it's such an interesting\ntime where you're like trying to\nidentify yourself\nlike going through high school again\nlike what what group do i you belong to\ndo i sit at this table do i sit at that\ntable but for you it's in your 20s and\nthere's no distinguishing like\ni'm in high school now i'm in college\nand now that's why i'm not friends with\nthat person because we went to different\nhigh schools\nbut now it's just like life and now it's\njust like oh i'm not friends with that\nperson because we just\nwe grew apart temporarily or maybe it\nmaybe just for life and that's okay\nbecause\nthey served a purpose in my life at one\npoint and i've learned from them and\ni've loved\nthem and every experience of them but\nlike no longer does and\nand and so it may be and maybe life will\nbring people back together at some point\nbut\ni definitely lived in in such shame of\nmyself and that was from\nunfortunately reading comments online\nfor a little bit too was\nreceiving feedback and and and\nquote-unquote validating but\nquote-unquote validating a feeling that\ni was already internally feeling but\nfrom an external source which was\nall these comments online um and i was\nlike oh they're seeing me they're seeing\nme i don't want them to see me\num and and allowing myself to you know\nfeel those feelings and lean into those\nfeelings and\nlet myself sit with them and figure out\nwhy i'm feeling that what's the root of\nthe problem\ninstead of shoving it down even further\nand not allowing myself to feel it\nbecause society tells us you know\nyou can't feel or put out anything but\nbeing happy and that's why i'm glad for\nthis\ni'm so happy for this generation this\nyounger generation who\nknows and they're learning through media\nthat has become even more vulnerable\nthrough\npeople like you who have encouraged us\nto allow ourselves to\nfeel every feeling and and and\nexperience it\nand and and figure out what exactly is\ngoing wrong and what\nwhat childhood trauma did i go through\nin which that it's bleeding into\nadulthood\num and and so allowing myself to sit and\njournal and meditate\nor you know whatever solutions you may\nfind for yourself like i\ni did that and i'm i'm glad that's what\ni did in that year too\nwas give myself that time and i've come\nout\nthis of the fire being this phoenix just\nlike\ncool like you're like ready to like\nserve the world because you know i gave\nthat time and i served myself and that's\nwhat i want to do is be generous of\nthe energy that i've harvested for\nmyself and and give it to others so\num but yeah that definitely there was a\ntime i think it was at the\ncontinuum conference yes i remember i\nwas just i was not feeling\nthe utmost myself and or myself and\ni it wasn't wasn't my strongest place\nbut\neven just sitting with you in that\nmoment and you just like kind of\nempowering me and through what i do i\nwas like\noh he sees something i don't see right\nnow i hope i see what he sees one day\nyou know like you were just you were so\nkind and so giving at a time that i\nreally needed it and so i thank you for\nthat\nmy nostrils are flaring because i'm\ntrying to hold back tears because there\nis a visual\nyour podcast you can't hear my shaky\nvoice but i was grateful for that\ni really really truly grateful and i was\ngrateful for the strangers that smiled\nat me at a time where i couldn't smile\nmyself\nyeah yeah that's so beautiful thank you\nfor sharing that i think it's so\nimportant\nfor people to hear that because and i\nloved what you said that\ni do think that we're at a time when\nyour generation especially\nand this generation right now is\nallowing itself to explore\nand i think when i remember even with me\nand i'm only you know\na little bit older than you but yeah\nyeah all right\nyeah yeah yeah but it's like\ni remember thinking that my 20s i was\ntold anyway my 20s had to be when i\nfigured it out\nyeah like it was already figured out\nyeah like by the time you finish college\nor university\nyou have to have it figured out and i\nwent off and became a monk so i totally\nwent off\nlike if there's any way to say i don't\nagree with the system it's becoming a\nmonk it's like you know it's like\ncompletely\nanti-inflammatory it's totally\nrebellious like i always say becoming a\nmonk is one of the most rarest things i\ncould have ever done because\nit's totally anti uh the systems and the\nestablishment it's like it's like\nbasically saying i don't value material\nthings\nand so when i went off and did that i\nspent and i can and that's why i can\ntestify and totally agree with\neverything you're saying\ni spent my whole 20s figuring myself out\nand learning not that i figured it all\nout and that i'm done now\nbut at least one phase of that cycle was\nwhat i dedicated my 20s to\nlike i i made my first video when i was\n28.\nwow that was one of my first 29 28 29 so\ntwo three years ago is when i made my\nfirst video\nand that was the first time i'd made any\npiece of media yeah\nand but but i'd come it was coming from\na place of i've just spent my\n21 to 28 just reflecting thinking\nmeditating figuring stuff out in tension\nreflecting it wasn't just like\nit wasn't just like oh yeah let's make\nvideo you know it wasn't like that and i\nthink\nhearing you say that is so beautiful\nbecause i think that applies to\nwhenever anyone who's listening or\nwatching has that reflection yeah so if\nyou have that reflection at 30\nthat's your 20s if you have that\nreflection of 40 that's your 20s\nyeah you know it's like there's no\nnumber on it no none and you're\nconstantly you're\nforever be a student like you're\nconstantly learning and you're\nconstantly like\ntrying to figure out you're always\ntrying to figure it out whatever it may\nbe\nand and to not have it figured out is\ncomforting to come to as a solution at\nleast for me\nit's like being like oh you know what i\ndon't know someone asked me what they\nthought my\nuh someone asked me what's your purpose\nwhat do you think your purpose is\ni was like multi-purpose\ni'm like a cleaner of sorts i can do\nhardwood floors or glass surfaces\nlike i i don't know i'm trying to figure\nthat out like i\ni don't have it figured out and i'm okay\nwith that so i think like i agree\nthat learning and unlearning of what\nyou've learned before like it's it's\nconstantly changing as our world around\nus changes right\nand i think i think the challenge that\nwe set ourselves up for\nwhich you're doing articulating so well\nis\nwhen we're in the process of reflection\nfiguring it out introspection whatever\nthat may look like\nit doesn't have to look a certain way\nyeah that's the place we're going to be\nforever anyway\nyou just don't want to be in the place\nof either saying okay i found it and i'm\ndone\nyeah or i'm not even going to bother\nyeah to be in the process because i\nthink\nthose both extremes can be quite\nisolating and scary when you're like\nokay i'm done now i know i found my\npurpose\nyep i found it and i've been at times in\nmy life where i actually was on that end\nwhere i was like\ni know exactly what my purpose i know\nexactly what i'm doing yeah\nand that also makes you go backwards and\nthen yeah like you don't want to be\ni look at you and i'm like oh he's got\nit figured out like i'm i'm over here\nsaying i'm okay without figuring it out\nbut jay\nlet me tell you about jay he's no he\nknows everything yeah no and\nand i i'd say i'm i always think life is\nin percentages\nlike i don't i think life is percentages\ni don't think life is ever 100 or 00\nit's 99 it's 87 it's 93 like\neverything is proportionate right it's\nnot like you've got it\nthere are times in my life where i'm\nlike okay i'm 95 on track but there's\nfive percent i've got to leave that\nspace\nto figure out more and to get to the\nnext phase and learn and grow\nyeah but if i ever go okay i'm 100 done\nnow yeah then it's kind of like well\nthen i don't need to\nthen i don't need to be or do it conch\nout totally yeah exactly\nyeah power is like okay it's your time\nexactly and i think it's just making\ni just want to be always shifting my\npercentage in the right direction but i\ndon't ever get to a point where it's\nzero or a hundred\nyeah you know so that's beautiful i love\nthat yeah i just think like\nlife is phases and phases change and\nnaturally you're going to go through\ndifferent transitions in your life yeah\nand and i just think that we\nwe try and get out of transitions\nquickly but transitions are the time to\nspend time\nin like that's where you want to spend\nyour time is in the transition and get\nit right\nbecause when you rush a transition you\nend up at a destination you don't want\nto be at\nright so yep right i don't know you're\ninspiring me right now\ni'm just saying this based on what i'm\njust trying to validate what i'm hearing\nyou say at 23\nand i'm like i'm 31 now and i'm\nlistening to you and i'm like that is\nexactly what i was doing when i was like\n23 like i was a monk so yeah they're\npractically the same\nlike you know the same thing but you\nknow that's what this is this is what\nyou wore as much this is where i was\ncolors yeah the nails yeah the acrylics\nbut no it's the same process that's what\ni'm loving hearing about\nyeah yeah yeah well thank you thank you\ni'm glad i mean that's crazy that that\nthat that's a process that you have to\nyou see your ex and maybe say process\nprocess i say process process yeah\nthat's a process process that you have\nto go through um and and you never you\nkind of never stop going through it\nwhat percentage would you say you're at\ntoday that's\noh food oh you put me on the spot yeah\nyeah this is my podcast this is\ni'm definitely in the i'd say in the 80s\nand the 90s\nnice so like yeah 80s of the night like\nyeah\nyou know 80s or 90s and it's getting\ncloser but i'm never looking for and i\nthink you've you've said this\nbeautifully like multi-purpose\ni think that's a great we got to change\nthe podcast name guys it's not on\npurpose it's multiplayer multiplayer\nlike but i i think that\ni i resonate with that yeah like i get\nwhat you're saying there right i think\nthat\nthat's what you do yeah and i think that\nyour purpose should always evolve\nbecause if it's not evolving and you're\nnot giving it space to grow and\nchange and deepen yeah then then you're\njust stuck doing one thing\nor believing one thing that you only\nshould do but you only should do and be\nand\nachieve one thing and then i'm just like\nbut that's not real and i've not seen\nthe greats do that and i've not seen\npeople i admire do that and\nand also i just don't think that's\nrealistic so but i feel very on purpose\nand that's why i call the podcast on\npurpose is because\ni always want to feel am i on purpose\nlike am i going in the right direction\nyou know is you know and that's how i\nfeel and my life is very on purpose and\neverything's intentional yeah but it's\nnot all figured out\nand i think you know you can figure out\nthe intention but you can't that you\ncan't\ndefine you can't expect a result yes\nyeah does that make sense\ni don't know if any of that makes sense\nbut what's insane is that you say the\nmost profound\nprolific things you're like did that\nmake sense no but i'm being serious\nbecause i'm just flowing and saying\nstuff and i'm like this is the float\nthe flow made sense man i'm so glad\nyou're recording like i'm glad this is\nbeing recorded so you know you can look\nback and be like i'm a genius yeah that\nwas a good episode\nthis is a good episode because of you\nthe other thing that\nreally that stuck out to me was um this\nwhole process that i was thinking about\nof you have often mentioned\nthat you even experience like social\nanxiety right\nand you talk about it a lot you address\nit a lot and i think when people first\nsee you and like what you're saying\nabout me like\nwhen i see you and again what you've\ndone it's like you're like i don't know\nbut liza is like confident like\nshe's got it figured out and the same\nway you're saying about me like when you\nsee me like oh but jay's got it figured\nout\nand it's like i think when people hear\nus like when i'm like no actually it's\npercentages and i'm figuring it out\nit's not only good for everyone to hear\nthat it's good for me to know that but\nfor you to say hey i'm a social media\nperson but i've actually\nexplained social anxiety like walk me\nthrough\nwhen you felt comfortable saying that\nbut more importantly like\nwhat have you seen has helped you with\nthat or how have you managed that\noh man oh man good question that's deep\num okay we'll be back we don't have 30\nminutes\nwe're back after this short commercial\nbreak that's actually 30 minutes long\nno i i believe i'm trying to pinpoint\nthe exact moment where i became\ncomfortable\ni think i made a video about anxiety and\nit was my\nyou know kind of like my social thoughts\nand it was very like surface level of\nyou know i was trying to bring\nhumor integrating humor into actual like\nsocial anxiety commentary or social\ncommentary\num and it was it was tough for me you\nknow it got especially interesting or\ncontroversial\nin the comments because we're like\nthat's not anxiety or that's not how i\nexperience anxiety\nand we all experience it in different\nways right there's different\ndifferent i don't even want to say\nlevels because not no level is worse\nthan the other because there's\nit's just your own experience and it's\nyour interpretation of life or\nsocial interactions or you know some\npeople have anxiety about death\nand like i've talked about many\ndifferent types of anxiety but i think\nthat was the moment in which i i thought\ncomfortable and appropriate in a time\nfor me to speak out about it was\ncreating that video\num but i do have social anxiety and i\nthink\nspeaking about it and even hearing\npeople like yourself who appear to have\nit all figured out just like i even said\nno jay knows everything\num to hear that that you do or\nexperience anxiety or nerves\nit disarms people and it just allows\nthem it humanizes you and allows you to\nknow that you experience these other\nemotions outside of the confidence that\ni\ni also admit emit\nand and it's it's what i strive to do is\nto show people that you can feel\nconfident no matter what situation but\num\nmy social anxiety definitely became like\neven social media anxiety\nand i was like scared to put myself out\nthere online\num which i was scared to put in which i\nwas scared to put myself out there in in\nreal life\nand it kind of went hand in hand and i\nwill say with like\nmy social anxiety i even was nervous\ncoming here today i'm even nervous\ni fluctuate and flow just throughout the\ncourse of this podcast i'm like\nyo i said that and that was dope wait no\ni can't say anything that tops that i\nhave to\ni have to have something else more\nprofound i gotta whip out google real\nquick and\nquote gandhi real fast or something i\nneed to peek um\nlike there's waves ebb and flow of your\nmind and and so many thoughts happen\nper second per minute and you know i\ni've\ni with my social anxiety i also have a\nlittle bit of derealization where i do\nrealize and i question\nreality i think that's my like creative\nside of my brain going and being like is\nthis real this occurs here and you're\nlike what was in my drink earlier\njust like you know you have ebb and flow\nof like confidence and then lowered\nconfidence and that can happen within\nthe span of five minutes or a couple of\ndays or a couple of years and\nyou know you might stay down low for a\nlittle bit but the fact that you know\nyou can come back up and\nand when you are low to know to think of\ntimes where you felt high and to\nexperience\nthat that gratitude that you you know\nyou can feel that happy that's what i i\ncling on to most you\ncling onto most you can't feel any other\nfeeling but gratitude when experience\nexperiencing gratitude and i'm so\nthankful for that because in my times of\ndarkness i just\nfeel grateful that i know what light\nfeels like and so that's that's what i\nhold on to at all times but i forgot the\nquestion again what happened no no no\nno no no there was the ebb and flow\nright there just me being like\ni think i said that right that's like\nthe reacting does that make sense\ndo you get what i'm saying yeah for\nthose words yeah yeah yeah\nlike because in my mind it just sounded\nlike random words together no no you\nhave answered the question i\ni think that's i love the way that you\neven brought it into this podcast\nand and i think that's why we look to\nmake we try to have shorter phone calls\nwe try to message people instead of meet\nthem like this is all part of that\nanxiety because\ntrying to be interesting for a long\nperiod of time is tough\nlike you know we or we we put that\npressure on ourselves of like\noh crap like i don't think i can go on\nthis date because i've got to be\ninteresting for 30 minutes on a date\nwhereas if i just message her or him\nthen that's gonna you know whatever it\nis and so i feel like we avoid and i\nthink just the fact that you just\nmentioned\nsitting you're right now you are sitting\non a podcast\ntalking about how you've felt anxiety on\nthis podcast breaking out\nright and and the ebbs and flows and i\nthink that's awesome because\ni think the beautiful thing is that when\nwe lean away from our anxiety that's\nwhen it gets scary\nbecause we just ignore it we try to bury\nit we try like push it away\nbut when you lean into it you're like oh\ni can see you like i see you i i'm aware\nof you\nand and i know when i feel you and when\nyou appear in my life yeah and i know\nthat gratitude is going to help me\nand how do you recall those grateful\nmoments of you feeling that light is\nthat\nhave you written them down do you ever\nmeant do you have an amazing memory\nwhere you're remembering them\nis it is it something you're wearing\nlike earlier you were talking about the\nt-shirt with the\nyeah you know be humble be brave be\nhumble be brave i have i have a lot of\nlike shirts like that that like\nsomething just like wearing all these\ncolors makes me feel\nbright like yes it's kind of like a\ncostume depending that helps me feel\nwhat i'm feeling on the inside and kind\nof accentuates that so yes\ni do wear like a lot of shirts that say\nlike be grateful be humble be this be\nthat\num just as a reminder to me and anybody\nwho's you know receptive to\nreading my shirt whoever has really good\nideas that is really tiny and\nminimalistic and aesthetic in the middle\nof your shirt um\nbut no i i have i have a journal i\njournal a lot\ni journal i also do the most millennial\nthing where i\nvideo diary and i make videos and i make\nvideos in my time\nof even darkness where i kind of like\nget analytical and explain to myself how\ni'm feeling\nare these the videos we're seeing or\nyou're making these are not the videos\nyeah that's what i'm saying\ni've seen videos you've put out i'm just\nlike yeah yeah and those are my\nthose are my more like lighthearted\nvideos obviously that i put out there\ninto the world but i do have these like\nvery intense videos where i'm like\ntrying to figure out why i feel a\ncertain way and it's just for me to kind\nof have it's like a personal video but\ni'm constantly making content it's just\na matter of whether or not you see it\nbut it for me it allows me to like\nemotionally release\nbecause you know i think i don't think\nany millennial has good handwriting we\njust we do not pick up pens or paper or\npencil\ni just the books in here are freaking me\nout because the amount of paper cuts\nthat could happen it's a dangerous place\nwe're in right now guys\nbut like i i have i i don't journal as\nmuch as i do\nvideo journal i guess um or i make these\nown\nmy own versions of podcasts that i'll\nnever release but they're\nthey're audio audio of me just like\nworking things out and and\ni see myself slowly get to like a place\nof comfort and\nand positivity and light again you know\nas i you know work through\nyou know the feelings of darkness kind\nof thing so i eventually get myself back\nbut it is it's a lot of reminders it's\nyour posts\nit's literally your posts that remind me\nand feed me\nbecause i i even said before that your\nfeed can sometimes starve you\nof reality of what real life is because\nwe're constantly scrolling and looking\ndown\num and like you're looking down how can\nyou not feel down that's\nyou know and so right\ni cannot feel down when you're looking\ndown at somebody else live their life\nand you're\nyou're busy watching you know so i\nyou know i i fed my feed when i was\ngoing through that time to\nmake sure i had that that positive and\nperspective\nyou know from others who were willing to\nshare their stories and i knew you know\nthis is my problems are so small and and\neverything what i'm going through is yes\nmy reality but it's so small in\ncomparison to like\nhow big the world is and there's so much\nto see and love and experience so\nyeah i love that those are such\npractical tips i love that no i\ni i think the video journal is is such a\ngreat idea yeah i personally prefer\naudio and video journals to written ones\nreally yeah i actually do because hey i\nthink you're right that\nthe handwriting point definitely but\nalso just the the patience to build a\nwritten\nlife i think because we've not been used\nto it growing up especially\nyour generation even more so the younger\nmillennials yeah and and it's\nwe're not used to it as much so being\nable to talk it out and also what i\nthink is really powerful\nis when you talk it out and then you\nlisten as if you're listening to someone\nelse\nyeah that you can then hear your\nproblems from a more objective point of\nview\nyeah and so i actually think what you're\nsaying is perfect i think doing video or\naudio recordings\nis such a brilliant way of journaling\nyeah and i think you can hear yourself\nin your voice and when you talk it out\nit's like\ni i think that's such a smart move yeah\nand i've not heard many people say that\nbut i definitely feel it's i definitely\nfeel that's a huge huge thing i\nrecommend anyone who's listening and\nwatching right now\nif you've struggled with journaling in a\nwritten form please take liza's tip on\ndoing audio and visual journals and it's\nsuch a great thing to be easily looked\nback upon\nthank you yeah and jay's tip too because\nyou do it as well which is\nit's nice sometimes i'll go back and\ni'll watch myself like not in my power\nand i'm like\ni want to give her a hug and that's the\nmost like feeling of self-compassion you\ngot to remind yourself of too\nit's like oh like it's okay girl it's\ngoing to be all right like i promise you\ni'm here right now\nand everything inevitably turned out\njust okay\nbut you are going to be just fine and\nthen i also make videos for myself where\ni am\nfully in my power and feeling confident\nand make a video saying yo\nthis remind yourself of this you see\nthis girl right here\nand like that looked like i was making a\ntick tock plug tick tock\nit's great um but like i'll make videos\nlike that even just to remind myself in\ntimes of\nwhen i'm feeling not so not so hot and\ni'll go watch that and be like yeah\ni know she exists i get back to her\nshe's within me at all times all right\ncool\nit's nice yeah exactly you mentioned\nearlier that\nyou've learned a few things from your\nolder sisters yeah mentioned over you\nthank you sisters tell me about some of\nthe things you've learned from both of\nthem they warned me\nabout their 20s oh that's good they won\nthat's good\nthey were in the 20s yeah yeah i like\nthat\nsounds like a good book um but yeah no i\ni they warned me about 20s being a tough\ntime and\ni was 18 was like well i went through\nwhatever i needed to go through because\ni'm\nfine don't worry i got it figured out\nand then 20. hit me like a brick\noh it's funny i actually went in for\nthis sidebar yeah as always with my\nattention deficit disorder\nbut i went in to get tested for\nattention deficit disorder and\nthey told me you you don't have a d\nno we can't give you any medication for\nthat but you have anxiety good luck\nlike that was it that was the end of\nthat doctor's appointment and i was like\nwhat\ni was 18. i was like what like i don't\nknow what you mean then 20\n20th birthday hit me and i had the most\nanxiety i just moved out to la i was\nexperiencing all this new life\nexperiences for the first time and\nanxiety just like came at me so it was\nit was definitely them you know warning\nme about 20s\nand then just allowing they told me that\nlike i think my middle sister olivia\ntold me that\nthings are just like temporary like you\nhave to understand that there's a lot\nthat's\nthat's temporary so with that knowledge\nknow\nto appreciate the moment when it's there\nand be very very present when it's there\nthe ultimate goal another sidebar dogs\nare amazing\n[Laughter]\nthat seemed random\nmy brain had to like run from like my\nleft-hand side of my brain to the\nright-hand side to be like what like at\nthe sidebar i'm having sushi tonight\nbut like cyborg the dog thing it's\nbecause dogs are so present\nthey're so they're so just there um\nthey're there with you at any moment\nthey just want to love and be loved and\nthat's that's all they do so i just\nwhenever i say present like if you need\na grounding presence\nit's a dog sometimes so that's another\ntip if you just go find a dog go to an\nadoption place and go pet one just be\npresent with that moment\num but yeah with that information that\nthings are temporary um to know that\nit's not this is this moment doesn't\ndefine you it's not who you are\num and and that this too shall pass and\nthen also temporary it being like\nexperience that would be grateful that\nyou're there and\nand and so that that's what i took away\nfrom my sisters so i'm grateful to\nboth of them that's beautiful usually\ntalk a lot of crap about them so this is\ngood\nthis is good this is this is just before\nfamily holidays yeah perfect\nright it's like a family holiday by the\nway they're all\nsuch like my whole family is like such

when\ni went to university and became a monk\nand stuff but yeah\ni think like you leaving at 19 20 to\ncome to l.a\nyeah like la's is a big crazy place yeah\nand but it seems like you've attracted\nthe right people around you here like i\nfeel like you've kind of\nyou've built a unit or a squad of people\nthere yeah you feel very happy around\nyeah they understand me and i understand\nthem how did you get to want to figure\nout who was right to have around you\nlike how did you get because i don't\nthink\ni don't believe people are good or bad i\njust think there's right people to have\naround you and there's times when it's\nnot the right people to have around you\nbut how did you get\na sense of figuring out who you wanted\naround you like what was it\nyeah that was i mean there's like this\nalmost instinctual like gut feeling of\njust like energy and like\nsounds like such an lay word but vibes\nbro like vibes of that you get from a\nperson\nand you just know that that's that those\nare your people you feel the utmost\nsense of comfort and strength\neven within the first interaction the\nfirst minute of meeting them and you're\nlike oh you\nyou are someone i want around because\nyou you keep me\nin my power and you believe in it even\nif i don't yeah and that's what courtney\ncourtney carter my manager\nshe cmg carter love you yeah i love

she walks into the room so\ni i you know meeting her\none of the first days that i was out in\nla and it was just a\nby chance by fate by destiny by\neverything the stars aligning and just\nme meeting her\nand and finding like my left brain yeah\ni i say i'm the right brain i get to be\nall creative and crazy and wear all\nthese colors\nand then she uses the left brain who\nkeeps me keeps me in line and supports\nme and like tells me this is logical and\nthis is not and i'm like yeah\nbecause i was being emotional i\nloved that you had her and she had you\nyeah like i loved it like i i've

important to have those\ncomplimentary people around us\nyeah because it's hard to find it's not\neasy at all\nand and to found it on your first day\nyeah\ni mean that's insane insane yeah i

clothes which is\ninteresting and intriguing like we got a\ngood editor\nyeah the editor has fully seen me but we\ndo have a good editor who censored\neverything so don't worry\nyou're getting a taste there's some left\nup to the mystery\ni love it tell us tell us about what has\nevolved in your character in the season\ntwo like what are we exciting to see\nabout your character\ni'm excited because it's just kind of it\nis and isn't a reflection of my own\npersonal life so like\nliza in the show has gone on many\nor he's going on dates and like is going\nout and like\noh she's like talking to boys and stuff\ni'm working on that in real life\ni don't have any dating apps i'm not\nyour average millennial but\nbut meeting people organically just\ngoing to coffee shops and just ordering\nfrom the barista like hello how are you\ngoing to coffee shops\nno no no i can't i totally can't i told\nagain it's really fun like i love\nmeeting everybody that i run into in\nperson it's cool yeah but\nyeah i gotta try to find me a man at a\ncoffee shop\nbut um no i just head over to the coffee\nshop starbucks on the break\nbut but no i i i think for liza on the\nshow she's\nyou know she's romantically evolving and\nlike allowing her emotionally evolving\nand allowing herself to go on these days\nand like have fun\num she is a little bit more established\nin her career\nand so it's it's her becoming\ncomfortable with what she's doing and\nand and being confident in what she's\ndoing and there's more clarity for her\nuh she's just having fun like she's just\nlike she like knows what she's up to now\nand she's like okay now i'm just gonna\nlike\njust go boss to the wall or over to the\nwall if you will\nwith whatever she's doing so she's just\nhaving fun i love that fun yeah i love\nthat\nyou mentioned career there is evolving\ndo you feel like the show has helped you\nfind like a newfound respect for like\nuber drivers and postmate delivery\npeople by playing the role\noh yeah yeah thank you for your service\neveryone out there\nyeah literally because those those are\nthe p those are the connective\ntissue of my life post mates\nbringing me some food it's crazy what we\ndo man we hire personal assistants\nthrough these apps\nwe are so lazy and also the most\nhardworking generation i know\nlike nicely nicely done right yeah a\nlittle slap to the face and then i'll\ngive you a spawn\nyeah but like it's it's wild like how we\nhire these people to do these do these\njobs for us for us to go about our day\nand and it is\nit's insane but they're i've always had\nthe best uber conversations and always\nlike get to know\nthem and they have many parts to\nthemselves too so like a lot of people\nhave\ni've seen um like a printed imdb sheet\nin the back of somebody's like uber no\nway yeah i'm not seeing what i like\nhe's like yeah i booked a couple jobs\njust by having my head shots here in the\nback seat yeah\nand like i was like oh that's cool other\nwoman had her daughter's head shots in\nthe back seat now the guy was selling\nhis mixtape\nand i was like yeah respect yeah i'm not\ngonna buy it but\nit's 15 man yeah you got an audio demo\nyeah no one has a cds man\ni don't have a cd player for this um but\nbut\nthere's i mean there's so many people\nand they're all out there hustling so i\ni appreciate and like thank them for\nwhat they do\nbecause i need them in my life yeah yeah\nwhat's your process for getting into\ncharacter\nlike i'm intrigued because you've played\nso many different characters in your own\nworld that you explain\nyou play this new character like when i\nsaw you win the streaming last year like\nyour\naward acceptance speech was just the\nbest so if anyone's not seen it go and\nfind the video\non youtube it's up and i\ni'm gonna give it away anyway spoiler\nalert but but liza literally starts it\noff\nand i was like wow she is so sweet and\nadorable\nand like you know she was like getting\nemotional she was crying for winning\nthis award and then she\nswitches it on like the sass turns on\nthe\nyou know the the kind of like the the\nbeast comes out you know\nit's like the beauty and the beast yeah\nand i loved it and i was just like\nyeah like how do you get into character\nlike what do you do what's your process\noh man\nyeah uh uh man i'm trying to figure out\ni'm not i'm not no uh daniel day lewis\ni'm not daniella day lewis yeah i do not\ni do not stay method and character\nanything like that but i was\ni guess you could say a little bit\nmethod this season in terms of\nmy roommates who i\ncast last season a year ago um and i\nremember them stepping in and taking\nskype calls with them and like casting\nthem\nthey became my roommates in real life\nthis year no way go glenn if you don't\nmove your stuff out of my room but she\nis still living with me to this day at\nthis moment oh my god\num and then travis coles who's also he\nalso has an amazing show out called\ndavid mix man it's on oprah winfrey's\nnetwork\ni'm so excited for him um oh yeah and\nkamiko too just they're two brilliant\nbeasts and i didn't know i was casting\nmy roommates my real roommates let alone\npeople who became my best friends\nand like i'm so lucky in that sense too\nbut it was the same like energetic\nenergy when i met met them too\num of just like oh yeah you're gonna i\nhave to get used to you you're gonna be\naround for a while\nso i put up with them and by around i\nmean they're right\nnext door between the thin wall that i\nhave\nmy house is structurally sound we're\ndoing well but but\ni they're right next door in in the\nother rooms and we\nwould go home every night read our lines\ntogether memorize together light candles\nand like do squats the same it was the\nmost ridiculously\nla thing when i looked in my living room\nand we were running lines\nand doing squats and eating dinner\ntogether because we had to get it all\ndone at once because we shoot like\n14 pages a day which is like a a gnarly\namount of content to make in one day\num um so it was just it was fun it was\nreally fun it was really crazy\nthat's not off that's not common right\nis it common for people who are on\nscreen to go and become really really\ngood friends in real life\ni've i've heard from yeah what have you\nheard i'm intrigued i mean i'm\ni'm friendly as hell i make friends with\nlike i do my best like yeah\nfriends but i'm intrigued because you\nalways wonder that right like when you\nsee on\nscreen romance or chemistry and people\nare like i wish they were together in\nreal life and like\nbut even with friends like is that\ncommon yeah what have you heard tell me\ni've heard that that no that\nfortunate events again if if you become\nfriends\nreal life friends with your with your\nfriends on screen and so it helps the\nchemistry\nall the more too like like we're on the\nclock but we're also just like in the\nhouse just hanging out\nand it's cool to like have that real\nlife chemistry with them so i love hope\nit shows on\nno and i i think that's special i\ndefinitely think that i think it's the\nsame in sport\nlike if you're playing on a team and you\ndon't\nif you're not really friends with the\npeople you're playing with yeah i mean\nlike you can do the right thing\nyeah but it makes a difference yeah how\nmuch you're going to enjoy when you\nscore how much you're going to enjoy\nyou know all of that i think it affects\nthe performance for sure because you're\ngoing to be there how long are you\nrecording every day oh truth\nby the way i was saying yeah at all that\nbut i have no idea anything about sports\nso i was just like yeah\nwell you do you just you just had the\nnike thing at night thing at vidcon\nthat was awful you were playing football\nsoccer\ni was i was and it was an interesting\nthat's why take on it yeah i know i was\nlike he thinks i get this right now\nhe thinks i understand keep nodding your\nhead smile and wave smile and wave\nuh no i i i was so bad i like i had no\nidea how to play soccer before and they\ndidn't tell me\ni was playing a full game i thought i\nwas just doing warm-ups so i i went into\na for context i went into a game of\nsoccer\nat nike or with nike at vidcon and just\nlike\ni feel like i was bad i was really\nreally really really bad especially\nbecause courtney's so good\nsoccer players and she was looking at me\nwith just well you know\ncan't all be good at things you know\nyeah i love it no but i i think that's\nthe point i was making sports aside yeah\nwas i do think that chemistry of real\nfriendship shows on screen\ntruth and and i think that's beautiful\nbecause how many days i was asking how\nmany hours are you filming per day\nwe film when you're filming how long\ndoes it take to create a little over\nwe'll go over 12 hours\nsometimes in one day that's normal\nfilming day in in\nhollywood and christmas trees like 12\nhours and then if you go over that you\ngo\ninto overtime kind of thing and you're\nin your little trailer in between\nno not really no it's like i'm in most\nmost scenes oh jump from one scene okay\nwe wrap that scene we'll go\nstraight into the next yeah go to\nanother area and film that but it's 12\nhours so you're spending 12 hours with\nthese people it's great when they're\nyour friends yep\nit's really nice you're nice it gets a\nlittle awkward\nbut no i'm lucky i'm lucky we had so\nmany conversations off camera on set so\nit was really cool\nthat's awesome yeah i love that i'm so\nexcited to see how things are evolving\nand growing for you\ni'm like so glad that i've met you now\nand i've got to know you now i'm like\nyeah i do wish i knew you were 18 but i\ndid\nour brown families didn't figure it out\nbut no i'm glad that i met you now\nbecause i'm just so excited to see\neverything you do\nlike i just think you're going to have\nthis incredible\npersonal and professional life for\ndecades and decades and decades\nand i'm just so excited to be your\nfriend and and be there with you\nthroughout the journey and just see it\njust\ngrow and excel even more and more and\nmore like you're going to do incredible\nthings and i think\nboth from a professional point of view\nbut i think also from like\nthe stuff you so effortlessly stand for\ni think that's what's so powerful about\nyou is that you so effortlessly stand\nfor things like i saw your clean beauty\nthing recently oh thank you and i was\njust like you know it's like i want you\nto talk about that but i was just like\nwhen i saw that i was just like you so\neffortlessly can stand for so many\nthings\nbecause they're just a part of you\nrather than having to be an activist or\nan\nambassador yeah how do you how do you\nsee that responsibility that comes with\nhaving lots of\nyeah following an audience versus like\njust doing what feels natural how have\nyou kind of balanced that\nyeah i feel like activism or you know\nwhatever it may be doesn't i support i\nmean anybody who is is standing up for\nsomething just to do that alone is just\ncourage and bravery in itself\num but for me it's just more so like the\nway i was raised the foundation i was\nraised on\nyou know the morale that i was raised on\nand being you know eco-friendly as much\nas\nas well as i possibly can um it's hard\nto do there's a lot of plastic\nit is yeah i love a good coaster and\nlike you know there's like there's\nthere's many things that like i i\ni appreciate and embody and and hope to\ndo that even with this\nclean beauty brand that is all natural\ningredients organic like\nthe story behind that is that is what\ni'm looking forward to sharing even more\nbut like i had eczema growing up\nand moloska which if you don't know what\nthat is did you yeah\neverybody did we had rough patches like\nliteral rough patches\nwe went through those rough patches and\nnow we found out like over time after\nmany like product\ndating and testing you you figure out\nwhat works for your skin and some people\nare like yeah just\nwash it with water i'm like you disgust\nme get out\nyou saving so much money damn you but\nlike you\ni i started using seymour which was is\nthe beauty brand and\nit's it's an amazing brand that just all\nnatural ingredients there's no\nanimal testing and like i hope that's a\nrevolution in the beauty industry\nto just you know switch over into this\nentirely vegan line\neverybody's worried about the vegan food\nthey're consuming what they're putting\non the inside what about the outside too\nyour skin that sits on your face so\nso just to have that i'm excited to\nembrace and encourage others and empower\npeople to use\nyou know

something\nsomething awesome\nquestion number three uh this is\nactually i'll end this one so uh who on\nyour team is the one to tell you\nno like who's me oh yeah\ni recently just even found out about\nthis word no\nand then i started using it maybe when i\nwas like 22. and\nand and i got really excited about it\nnow i say no\ni love it awesome awesome i had to ask\nyou this because i saw this years ago\nbefore\nwe knew each other obviously because it\nwas a while ago but how does obama smile\nlike um he just smells like like\nlike really really clean laundry like he\njust did it he washed that shirt over\nand over and over again so that when\nsomeone did ask\nwhat did he smell like he was like\nthey're gonna say clean laundry\nyeah he that's what he wanted like and\nalso like like a little bit like like\nlike a forest like like like a mystical\nforest with like fog\nand like a deer like in the distance\nhe's amazing he's incredible that must\nhave been awesome what an experience is\nincredible\nbasically like a like a dryer sheet in\nthe woods that's what\nobama smells amazing this is your fifth\nand final question okay\nso you said you like love this quote\nsuccess is going from failure to failure\nwithout losing enthusiasm so\nwhy that quote why is that quote so\npowerful for you oh i love that\nbecause i've and i think we all do\nsometimes with our with\nself-doubt and whatnot we consider\ncertain things or certain experiences or\nmoments to be failures\nand if you let that failure bring you\ndown sure you can spiral and yes i\nencourage you to lean into the feeling\nof whatever you're feeling but\nif you if you allow that if you won't\nlet your\nit won't let you yourself live that\nmoment down\nyou're gonna just feel down forever you\nknow and and so\nto not lose enthusiasm and to keep\nbelieving in yourself and have this\nquote unquote delusional confidence\nthen you can keep going and that's what\nmakes you successful is not letting\nthose moments\nof failures define you but just to keep\ngoing\nand and believing that you have so much\nto say and and you're going to keep\nsaying it no matter what your mind says\nabout you\nyour mouth i like to say that though\nrecently i've discovered that your mind\ncan either live in the past and the or\nthe future but your mouth lives in the\npresent and it's true that's so good\n[Applause]\nthat is so good yeah you need to post\nthat i'm i'm working on it\nyeah go on say it again sorry i said i\ncut you off i got too excited oh you're\ngood i love that it was a little\ncheerleading moment thank you thank you\num but like your your mouth speaks the\ntruth and you you're able to speak\nyour reality my mind might be saying oh\nno you're not doing well in the podcast\nright now you're not this isn't\nwhat you're saying it's not profound\nenough for mr g shetty no my\nmy my my mouth is saying a little bit of\na stutter but my mouth is saying\nno i have something important to say and\ni'm going to say it and perhaps\njay will ooh and he did and so he did so\nthat's\nmine i love the mind in the mouth man\nthat's such a powerful way of putting it\ni've never had anyone say that that's\namazing i say thanks i say\nno you said so many things like i just\nfirst of all i just want to say\neveryone who's been listening and\nwatching there have been so

disarm\nthe other person and disarm ourselves to\nto be our best selves\nuh delusional confidence right eliza was\ntalking about like having the ability to\njust go beyond what we think is possible\nand like\nbeing able to realize that there's an\naspirational version of ourselves\nuh you're hearing the mouth i mean this\nmouth and mind is like blowing my mind\nright now i'm like\ni'm going to use that everywhere i quote\nyou again and again and again\ni'm going to put that on it and i just\npeeked you're watching my peek right now\ni love that like i think it's such it's\nso much truth because\nwe believe everything our mind says but\nif your mouth said something different\nyou could believe that\nand that could change your mind\nabsolutely\nabsolutely and this is one you can hear\nout loud so i love that\nso many takeaways in this whole episode\nthank you liza we're so\nexcited for eliza ondemand season two i\nwant everyone to go watch it on youtube\nuh it's it's gonna be
