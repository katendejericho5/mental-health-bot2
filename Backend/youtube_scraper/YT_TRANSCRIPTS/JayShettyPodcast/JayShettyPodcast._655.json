for a treat jamie welcome to\non purpose\njay thank you so much i am so excited to\nbe here it's such an honor and i can't\nwait thank you\nthis is so fun because i feel like i\nremember the journey when we started\ntalking about your book\nand we started talking about what you'd\naccomplished\nand the incredible journey you've been\non now first of all i think it's\nimportant to say and i\ni really mean this even though you're a\nfriend and you know we live in a world\nwhere we're surrounded by people doing\namazing things\nit is important to say that what you've\ndone is truly historic\nlike it is historical it's we shouldn't\nunderestimate it we shouldn't just\npass it off we live in a world today\nwhere you hear numbers all the time and\neveryone's like oh yeah this company\ndid this and this what you've done is\nhistoric\nand and i just want to take a moment to\nrecognize that as your friend\nuh as an interviewer today and and for\nour audience\nbecause you're about everyone who's\nlistening right now and when you go out\nand get the book you'll\nyou'll read about it you're hearing\nabout a journey of someone who was\nthe underdog someone who didn't have\nall the possibilities and access in the\nbeginning\nbut someone today is having such a big\nimpact on people's lives so\njamie today we're going to go through\nthe journey in a different order i want\nto start with\nuh what i saw the other day because i\nreally want to\nyou know give testament to the book i\nsaw a video on your instagram the other\nday where you were unboxing the book\nwith your husband and your daughter\nuh and it was it was a super emotional\nmoment now you've achieved a lot of\nthings in life tell us why the book was\nso\ndeep and personal and meaningful after\neverything you've been through\nyou know jay i am i watched my daughter\nopen the book\nand the thing that i felt my husband\nstarted crying and he never cries and he\nwas\ncrying uh you know i i think this is\nwhat it comes down to is you know when\nyou google\nmy story you see oh denny's waitress\nbecomes billion dollar entrepreneur and\nit seems like such a fairy tale\nand after years of having so many women\ndm me on instagram saying like oh\ndid you get lucky or you know i wish i\nhad connections like you\ni kind of realized that if we don't\nshare the real\nstories behind the stories like all the\nreal stuff then people feel\nalone in their own rejections or\nsetbacks or you know self-doubt or not\nenoughness\nand and watching my daughter open the\nbook was kind of my proudest moment\nbecause\nthis is the first time ever that i've\never just\nlike pulled back the curtain and said\nhere's here's what really happened and\nhere's\nyou know here's how the first three\nyears of\nof constant rejections happen and here's\nhow i got through them and here's the\nthings i did wrong the things i did\nright\nand um you know at the end of the day\nit's it's it's really\na story this book believe it is really a\nstory about a girl who\nwent from not believing in herself to\nbelieving in herself and\nand not not trusting herself to then\nlearning like how to\nhow to get still and hear my own\nintuition and make the decision\nto trust it um and how to kind of go\nfrom doubting\ni'm enough to knowing i'm enough and i\nthink that\nwhy i got super emotional watching my\ndaughter open it is because i realize\nyou know this this isn't just my story\nit's the story of so many\npeople out there right now on their own\njourney of like learning how to believe\nin themselves and\nand trust themselves and know no they're\nenough and um\nand so for me it's the most meaningful\nwork i've ever done\num in my life because it's you know it's\nnot about me and it's just\ni don't know i'm just i'm honored i\nthink every one of us and you are\ntestament to this oh my goodness\nevery one of us has a story\nto share that if we're you know\ncourageous enough to share it can really\ninspire um inspire everyone else on\ntheir own journey of like\nstepping into the person they're born to\nbe so yeah\nit was a really emotional moment and um\nand just proud for my daughter to see\nthat i want her to grow up\nand not doubt herself the way i did for\nmany many years and\nand to you know learn to believe in\nherself too and i'm just\nhonored to have learned a ton of lessons\nthat i can hopefully share with her and\nso many other people\nyeah i'm glad you're doing that what i\nlove about this conversation already\nis everything you're saying is\nexactly what 99 of our listeners our\ncommunity\nme a few years ago before i got started\nlike this is the emotion that feeling we\nall had we doubted ourselves\nwe were negative about ourselves we\nthought that someone else got lucky we\nthought\nsomeone else just had it handed to them\nand so we judged them\nor we had a different perception but\ntell me about\na time or their times when you felt\nyou underestimated yourself because i\nthink\nwe've all been underestimated by people\nand you put up a quote the other day on\ntwitter that i loved you said\nyou might be tempted to underestimate me\nbut let me save you some time\ndon't and and i loved that i was\nlaughing when i read that but i\ni know you and i i've spent time with\nyou\nand you you speak about in the book\ntimes where you underestimated and\ndoubted yourself\ntell us about what that really feels\nlike because i think people forget when\nthey see you today they'll be like oh\nshe's probably been confident our whole\nlife\nand and i know as your friend and\nsomeone that you've been vulnerable with\nthat's not true and so i'd love i'd love\nfor you to share a bit about that\nyeah so many stories jay and and this is\nsomething i think too for anyone\nlistening right now who's struggling\nwith self-doubt and who\nlike knows they're made for more but\nstill doubts themselves anyway\ni think it's a lifelong journey for all\nof us right it's something that even to\nthis day\nthere'll still be days where you know\nmaybe a friend i was counting on like\ndidn't show up for me the way i thought\nthey would\nand i start in it it hurts my feelings\nand then b\ni go right back and i'm like okay let me\nget let me get over that um\nbut there's there's so many moments and\ni think us learning how to handle those\nmoments and\nand uh is key to everything because i\nthink self-doubt\nlike kills more dreams than almost\nanything else\num you know one big moment that that\nstands out to me and there's so many\nthat i share in the book because\ni i really want to share how i navigated\nthings the right way and how i did it\nthe wrong way and\neverything i've learned but you know i\nremember um you know a few years\nuh well actually let me tell you a\ndifferent one so so i knew ever since i\nwas a little girl\nand sitting in my living room i always i\nwould watch oprah\nevery single day and i always thought oh\nyou know\none day i'm going to grow up and i'm\ngoing to interview other people like i\nwant to share their stories with the\nworld i knew i was going to do that my\nwhole life i just knew\nand i was finally working in my dream\njob uh uh\nin my 20s and uh and 30s as a news\nanchor\ntelling other people's stories and i\nthought like oh and i started\ni went through this big season the\nsetback where i got a hereditary skin\ncondition called\nrosacea and there's no cure for it and i\nwould be live anchoring the news and i'd\nhear my earpiece from the producer\num there's something on your face\nthere's something on your face you know\ncan you wipe it off can you wipe it off\nand they had they were having my back\nlike they were they were great but i\nknew\nthere wasn't anything i could wipe off i\nknew it was that this bright\nred because my skin would get bright red\nall bumpy\nand like sandpaper texture i knew i\ncouldn't wipe it off i knew it was the\nmakeup\nbreaking up under the the hot lights and\nso i went through this season i'm just\ntrying to find\nevery product out there that you know\nand nothing would work for me\nand uh and and i thought that i was in\nthe season of setback\nin my life and what i'd later learn is\nour setbacks are often\nour setups for something that we're\nsupposed to do next on our own calling\nand our own purpose in life and\nbut at the time i was in the season of\nself-doubt\nuh where my inner critic was really\ngetting loud\nand taking over and there'd be so many\ntimes i would be\nyou know live on television and i'd be\nthinking thoughts like\nare viewers changing the channel am i\nam i going to get fired and i went\nthrough this big season of self-doubt\nand then\ni had this you know moment one day this\nreally strong gut feeling where i was\nlike wait a minute\nif i can create a product that actually\nsolves my own problems i bet you there's\nso many other people out there\nthat like me their whole life they've\nseen these these beauty commercials on\ntv or magazines that show perfect skin\nthey've never seen anyone that looks\nlike them\nuh and i always aspire to look like\nthose ads they always kind of made me\nfeel like i wasn't enough deep down\ninside but\ni realized wait i've never seen\nanyone that has a skin challenge if i\ncan create a product that works for me i\nbet it's going to help so many other\npeople\nand and then i had this wild crazy\ngod-sized dream i was like\nwhat if i just redefine beauty in the\nwhole beauty industry what if\ni'm sitting there right as a broke news\nanchor because you don't get paid much\nto all in journalists so\ni'm sitting there i'm like if i launch a\nproduct that works what if i put real\nwomen\nevery age and shape and size and and and\ngender identity everything what if i\nyou know and and i call them beautiful\nand authentically\nmean it and that's how i use those\nmodels and i had this whole big dream\nmeanwhile i'm sitting there knowing\nnothing about the beauty industry\nhaving no connections um and and but\njust\nhad this gut feeling and when i look\nback on my journey now and\nyou know that was 10 years ago when i\nlook back at my journey over everything\nthat's happened\num i have done so many things wrong\nbut i think one of the biggest defining\nmoments\num and i share all the mistakes in the\nbook too but one of the biggest defining\nmoments\nof one of the things i did right was\nwhen i when i would get a strong gut\nfeeling like i decided to trust myself\nand and it changed everything doesn't\nmean it was easy\nyeah it was a hard a hard journey after\nthat but\nyou know it was a moment too jay where i\nbecause i\nreally thought i was in my dream job um\nbut i also had this big moment come over\nme where i realized like oh\nthe victory isn't in just not quitting\nright we're always told like\ndon't quit don't give up i feel like the\nvictory is in us\nknowing um when to let go of a dream\nright i think that's as important as\nknowing when to go after one\nand it was this moment where even though\ni thought i was where i was supposed to\nbe i all of a sudden\nfelt like i wasn't and i was supposed to\ntake this next leap and i decided to\nto trust it um and\nand become an entrepreneur and and that\nwas crazy\ni love that story thank you for sharing\nthat because i think\nwhen you think about that like being on\nbroadcast television\ntalking to to so many people\nand then to have someone whisper in your\near there's something in your face\nlike that is you know that's scary like\nthat's that's really scary\ntell me about how it how you even got\nthere because i feel like\nthere's even a layer before that\nthat when you when you had the\nconfidence to be on tv and that was a\ndream that you had watching oprah\ntell us about the period even before\nthat maybe it was in your teenage years\nas as a young girl what were the\ndoubts and the underestimates\nunderestimations you had\nin even to get to that stage of being on\ntv yeah\ni think that you know being a person who\nis\nkind and i think maybe you can relate to\nthis\ni think whenever you're kind um people\nunderestimate you just\nright off the bat and uh and and so\nthat's been something that\nyou know is important to know i think\nyour whole life but\nyou know i am i was always\nunderestimated for that\nbut i i also always had this kind of\ninternal knowing\ni'm actually curious if you've had this\num but you can tell i want to interview\nother people\nthat's not happening today it's i'm not\nletting you i'm not letting you\nokay one one question because maybe\nmaybe your listeners um\ncan relate to this or maybe even\nremember this moment but i was nine\nyears old when this happened and\ni remember watching oprah on television\nand barbara walters said to her\nuh asked her a question and interview\nand oprah said\ni always knew i was destined for\ngreatness\nuh her whole life so she always knew\nthis and i remember at the time\nthis made the press everywhere and\npeople started kind of like\nhating on her for saying this i think\npeople weren't used to\num in particular a woman being so bold\nto say something like that\nbut i remember being a nine-year-old\nlittle girl and\neven though you know and i think we all\ndeal with underestimation\ni also remember having this feeling when\noprah said that when oprah said\ni've always known i was destined for\ngreatness i remember sitting there as a\nlittle girl going\nme too me too and i would literally\nsee what's possible through her sharing\nher own story and her sharing her own\nvulnerabilities\num and that's a big reason i wrote this\nbook too but that's\nthis will be my i'll try to make this my\nonly question for you like because look\nat everything you are doing look at how\nyou are helping to heal humanity through\nlove and look at the millions of people\nyou're impacting\nlike have you always had that feeling as\nwell\num since you were little yeah it's a\nreally good question actually\nand this is why you were a great\ninterviewer i i i don't think i've ever\nbeen asked that question before\nuh i so when you were watching oprah and\ni\ni grew up watching oprah 2 but i think\nthe first person that had a big impact\non me through their media\nwas eminem so i grew up as a teenager\nlistening to eminem\nand i would not just listen to his music\ni would watch his interviews\ni would watch his early videos and i\nthink i learned so much about\nresilience and opportunity from his\nstory and\nyou know he had so many famous songs\nwhich would have so many lines about\nlike\nyou know taking your shot have taking\nyour opportunity\nand so i don't think i ever believed any\nof what i\nam able and blessed to do today was\npossible i don't think i did because i\ndidn't know anyone\nwho'd done it i wasn't exposed to the\nmedia industry i wasn't\naround people like that but i always\nknew that i had to try\nand so i was very much convinced that i\ncould try and that i had to put myself\nout there and i had to take\nopportunities and i had to give things a\ngo\nbut i never was aware of the result i\nnever really believed that the result\nwas mine\ni just knew that if i listened to what\neminem said that it might happen because\nhe had this he had this belief set and\nso when\nyou ask me that question i i can see i\nknow exactly what you mean and\nand it's lovely hearing you say that i\nthink we should celebrate that because\nwhy we would all want our children to\nsay\noh mom dad i i want to go and help\npeople i want to go and serve people\nlike we're not\nyou're not celebrating you know even\nyour work like it's not\njust celebrating the success of a makeup\ncompany it's like\nyou're celebrating the success of you\nwanting to help people\nwith a real challenge with real\nconfidence with there's so much depth to\nthat so\nyou your first chapter is called when\nyour intuition talks to you\nbelieve it how do you know\nyou're hearing your intuition because i\nfeel that for so many people today it's\ngot so\nquiet and you're mainly hearing just\nnoise and your parents and your family\nlike how do you\nknow when you know it's like oh that's\nmy intuition how do you know\nyeah and i'll ask you later if you\nbleached your hair like eminem and if\nyou were slim shady and went through\nthat whole phase\nwe'll have a combo offline um but i love\nthat like you know he was someone in\nyour life that you like turned the\nvolume\nup on and we're inspired by it i think\nthat's huge so\num yeah you know intuition when your\nintuition talks you believe it like i\nhave learned jay like\ntime and time again uh and i believe by\nthe way every one of us\nhas an intuition and a knowing and i\nbelieve that our knowing\nis always right and i think that to\nexactly to your point\ni think all of the noise of everything\naround us of self-doubt of our inner\ncritic\nof you know our friends and family who\nlove us but like\ndon't get our dreams or our hopes\nbecause they're seeing it\nthrough the lens of their own fear or\ntheir own experiences and\nand all of that can become so loud\nthat it's like this huge barrier almost\nof self-doubt\nit reminds me of like when you're on a\nflight and you see all these clouds\nbelow you it's like\nwe're walking through life with all\nthese clouds of self-doubt and sometimes\nit's so hard to\nlike penetrate through them and hear our\nown\nour own gut and our own internal knowing\nand i think a lot of people have lost\ntouch with it and haven't\nheard it for a long time absolutely um\nyeah but i i think it's a lifelong\njourney and\nand i think it takes a lot of practice\nand i also think it takes\na lot of grace um that we give ourselves\nright because a lot of times we'll think\noh\ni trusted my gut but it was wrong and\nall these things like what do i do and\ni think that um it takes literally a lot\nof practice and it takes building that\nmuscle and getting\nstill and learning to hear your own\ntruth\nand i'm sure that you know through all\nof your teachings of meditation you\nprobably hear from people all the time\nlike oh\njay i try to meditate but all i do is go\nthrough my to-do list in my own head or\nall those things right it takes time and\nand you have to give yourself grace in\nit and\nyou know an example of how i started\nbuilding this this\nintuition muscle also is looking back at\nexperiences\nright like everyone listening right now\ncan probably think of a time\nthat they trusted their gut they trusted\nthemselves and it was right\nor they can probably think of a time\nwhen oh\ni i had this gut feeling that this\nperson i was dating was super sketchy\nbut\nlike i didn't listen to that gut feeling\nand i was like i should have\nright we all kind of can look back and\nbuild this muscle and\nyou know a big a big powerful story\nuh that happened to me that i think is a\nuniversal story because\nso many of us go through different\nvariations of someone else telling us\nwe're not enough\nor someone else telling us we're not the\nright fit or someone else\ntelling us we're not qualified right and\nsometimes it's ourselves telling\nourselves that too\num but you know there is a moment where\nyou know after i i\ndecided to take this big leap as an\nentrepreneur and\nquit my job and and you know i wrote the\nbusiness plan on my honeymoon flight to\nsouth africa with my husband\ngot back and went all in and i just\nthought jay i\ni thought oh uh if i can just create a\nproduct and it's amazing and it works\nlike\nit's just gonna sell and and uh thank\ngoodness i didn't know how\nhard it was gonna be to be an\nentrepreneur or i may have\nuh second guessed myself but um you know\nwe poured every penny we had into into\ncreating a product and hiring an\nadvisory board and\nand then what i wasn't anticipating was\nfrom the moment we launched the brand\nand from the moment we had a product\nthat i was like oh this is life changing\nand it works uh it would be three years\nbefore we could afford to pay ourselves\nand\nall of the beauty retailers that i had\nput on pedestals that i love like i\nwould save my tip money as a denny's\nwaitress\nto buy a mac lipstick or a lancome\nisland go into all the big department\nstores\num all over the world you know like i\nloved i loved it and so i had always\nheld these amazing retailers on this\npedestal\nand now i'm sitting there with my own\ncompany thinking like oh\nthe product works they're gonna love it\nand every time i would send my product\nto all the department stores the beauty\nretailers qvc\nuh everywhere they all said no uh\nunanimously no\nyou're not the right fit your packaging\nis not nice enough and this went on and\non and on\nand about two years into it and we were\nstaying alive by\nthe way selling about two to three\norders a day on our website\num and and that was it uh and about two\na little over two years into uh the\ncompany\ni got a phone call from a potential\ninvestor and i was like\nand i was so excited because i thought\noh my gosh and this was a big private\nequity company that has\nuh invested in a bunch of the consumer\nproduct companies that we all buy in\ngrocery stores\nand they've invested often in\npre-revenue and made them big household\nnames\nand i thought oh gosh if they invest in\nit cosmetics like a\ni'm not going to go bankrupt and b um\nthey're going to help like maybe they'll\nuse their leverage to get me\ninto these stores that keep telling me\nno so jay i was\nso excited i thought this was going to\nbe life-changing and\ni we started doing meetings with them\nand then entered the diligence phase and\nthey loved our product\nuh and uh and and diligence phase\nmeaning like we showed a\nproduct pipeline and future projections\nand all the stuff\nand it got down to the final meeting and\nmy husband and i flew up for the meeting\nand i'll never forget this moment um\nbecause it's\nliterally a moment that's etched so\ndeeply when i think about how i\nbuilt my my muscle of intuition uh but\nwe were\nwe were there for the final meeting and\ni just thought it was going to be\nlife-changing and i was standing there\nabout three feet\nuh from the head guy and he was super\nnice and he was like\nlisten we're you know we love your\nproduct we want to wish you the best of\nluck but it's a no\nuh we're gonna pass on investing in it\ncosmetics\nand i was like okay um\nand i'm so used to hearing no at this\npoint right and i'm like okay can you\ntell me why\num because feedback's usually a gift\num can you tell me why and he he was\nabout three feet from me\nface to face and he says do you want me\nto be honest with you\nand i said yes please and he says i just\ndon't think women will buy makeup from\nsomeone who looks like you\num with your body and your weight\nand i remember in this moment wow two\nthings\nyeah two things happen so i remember\nfeeling like\nphysically feeling this like feeling\nthrough my body like a lifetime of body\ndoubt just like flooding my body\nand i remember looking at him i\nliterally felt no anger at all i mean\nit's obviously\nsuper hurt um but i was watching the\nwords come\ncome out of his mouth and literally i\nhad this\nfeeling like this deep feeling that he's\nraw and i remember this feeling like it\nwas yesterday it was like literally in\nthe pit of my stomach like it was like\nthis knowing he's wrong um but i also\nknew i had no proof he's wrong\nuh and and you know his words\nhurt i went out to the car and cried my\neyes out\nand i had to do a lot of work to like\nturn down the volume on those words not\nrepeat him over and over for years um\nuh but i just felt like he was wrong and\nthe other thing i felt jay was\nuh you know i it's weird the one thing\ntoo\nthat you know when i look at the things\ni've done right to how to build this\nbillion dollar company\ni never took the rejection personally um\neven when it hurts and there's hundreds\nof rejections\nbut like in the case of this guy when\nyou said those words\ni realized after i had a moment you know\nto process them\num he was just as much impacted by a\nlifetime of the beauty industry as i was\nand\nto the point where he thought oh if you\ndon't look a certain way\ni can't make money off you so he's\njust so so his words and\nin a way were just confirmation\nof why i needed to keep going because\nthings needed to change\nand you know and by the way just to\nshare this in case i forget\num uh i share so much more about this\nbut\nsix years later six years later when\nl'oreal\nacquired the company that i started and\nmy living room they\nacquired it for 1.2 billion dollars cash\nand it was all over\nthe they released this right in a press\nrelease which i didn't know they were\ngoing to do until the day before\nand that day it was all over it was the\nhome page of the wall street journal\neverywhere\nand i got an email from that investor\nand i hadn't heard from mj in six years\nand i got an email from him uh and he\nsaid congratulations\non the l'oreal deal i'm so happy for you\ni was wrong\nand i learned it would have been the\nmost successful investment in his firm's\nhistory and um\nthe other thing that i that i just want\nto share um because i think this is\npowerful because i think so many people\nespecially listening to us watching us\nright now uh\nare coming out of a really hard year and\nthe year of\nthings not making sense and the year and\nsometimes\nyou know people are just in a season or\na moment of rejection\nor setback and um there's a really\nfamous\nquote that says rejection is god's\nprotection\num and i think this applies to every\nfaith you can a lot of people replace it\nwith the rejection of\nthe universe's protection and it's wild\nbecause when i look back at so many\nrejections that i've gone through\nand i just feel like someone might need\nto hear that today right because it's\nlike i look back and\neven when they didn't make sense at the\ntime and even i thought there's\nno way this is um\nmeant to be or you know all those things\nlike this just hurts or it feels unfair\nor\nor personal or i look back and it's like\nwow i'm so grateful\nfor the hardship or the setback because\nyears later sometimes and sometimes it\ntakes\nyears till we see like oh i'm in the\nplace i'm supposed to\nbe i was per you know the rejections\ngod's protection\nbut in this case jay at the time that he\nsaid those words to me\ni was so desperate i didn't know how we\nwere going to stay alive as a company i\nwould have probably given him the\nmajority of the company\nfor almost no money right and because he\ndidn't believe in me\nand because of that rejection and then\nand then a lot of others as well\non the way um and other people that did\nbelieve in us for sure\nbut because that guy didn't believe in\nme by the time we did sell our business\nto l'oreal we were still the largest\nshareholders\num so it's like wow\nit's like i i always thank god not just\nfor the open doors but for the closed\ndoors absolutely and just having that\ntrust in it right\nabsolutely what a i i loved every bit of\nwhat you just shared\nbecause i think that's the reality of it\nand\nyou know obviously you've only told us\nabout one of the bigger rejections and\nthe book goes into detail on\nall of the the smaller rejections the\nquick rejections i mean the idea of that\nyou were patient that you didn't pay\nyourself for three years\nthere's so much patience involved\nthere's so much\nresilience and adapting and going at it\nagain and you're getting so much\nnegative feedback from even people of\ninfluence and i think you know and i can\nrelate to all of those in my own\npersonal life and my journey\nthat there's so many parallels that i'm\nlike oh i remember exactly the executive\nthat\nthat i had a similar uh run-in with and\nso\nwhat i what i'm fascinated by though is\nhow much have you found\nthat building something successful\nwhat percentage or what ratio is it\nmindset\nversus the actual skill of business and\nproduct that you're doing like\nif you had to divide it where would\nsomeone like you divide it how much of\nthis was you having to learn\npackaging learn sales learn spreadsheets\nlearn growth versus how much of this was\nyou\nbeing adaptable being persistent being\nresilient and relentless in that pursuit\ntell us a bit about that journey of both\nof those\nyeah i mean gosh if i had to answer that\njust right off the fly i would say\n80 or 90 percent mindset wow\ni i really believe and and\nand now in this journey you know um now\nhaving a blessing and meeting thousands\nof entrepreneurs and just seeing the\nones that make it and the ones that\ndon't and the ones that build things or\neven just human beings and and the ones\nthat go after their goals and\nthings like that and step into all of\nwho they are um\nversus kind of like stay in their\ncomfort zone and talk themselves out of\ntheir own truth i\nreally believe i truly believe um\nwhere you come from doesn't determine\nwhere you're going i believe that\nwe all tell ourselves these lies like oh\nyou know i don't have the right\nconnections i don't come from the right\nfamily or i am not\nqualified and i'm not smart in all those\nthings\nuh i don't believe that i think that\npeople that\nchange the world right are actually um\nfamous uh steve jobs\ncommercial um and it's jack oh my gosh\njack\nuh kirsten i'm telling you his last name\nthat said these words but it's like\nthe people that are in his words the\npeople that are crazy enough to believe\nthey can change the world are the ones\nwho do\nit's not the people who are smart enough\nchange the world it's not the people who\nare\nright and it's like look at you having\nand you're brilliant but\nhaving a vision to take to make wisdom\ngo\nviral it's like you have the guts to go\nfor it\nyou know what i mean you have the guts\nto believe you can and it's like\nthere's so many stories i share in this\nbook where\noh my gosh i was not by any stretch of\nthe imagination the most qualified\nperson in the room and i was\nnot the most experienced in all those\nthings\num but so many times i just made the\ndecision\nuh to believe that i could and and\nand sometimes that's what it comes down\nto and i also feel\nlike you know i've learned a lot of\npowerful lessons along the way as well\num\nthat should have become freeing and you\nknow\ni heard you share a quote and you'll\nknow where\nwhere this is from you shared where it's\nfrom too but that you can't be anything\nyou want but you can be everything you\nare will you share that really fast\nagain yeah no that's it i i\ni talk yeah i talk about in my book i\ntalk about how we've been told two lies\nsince we were young and the two lies are\nthe first one is you can be\nanything you want and and i do think\nthat's\nthere's a lie in that because i think\nyou have a unique\njourney and you're not meant to be\nanything\nand the second lie that we've all been\ntold is you'll be nothing\nyou won't make it you're insignificant\nyou're irrelevant it won't work\nand that's where i i say that the uh\nyou can't be anything you want but you\ncan be everything you\nare because what you are is and that's\nyour story what you just said now the\nidea that\nthis person said to you like oh people\nare not going to buy makeup\nfrom someone who looks like you like\nthat's i mean that's\none of the worst things i've ever heard\nanyone saying like that sounds terrible\nbut the idea is that\nyou became who you were meant to be and\ni think that stops you from the idea of\nenvy and comparison and all of that but\noh you're going good that's so huge\nthat's so huge and just to add one thing\nto that\num so i'm gonna get so fired up right\nnow because i just know i know someone\nneeds to hear this right now who's going\nthrough this because we're in this world\nof social media where we're like oh\nit's so tempting to compare ourselves or\nto get distracted or to feel\nless than or to see someone else's\nhighlight reel and think we should\nchange who we are\nand you know there's there's two big\nthings that happened jay\nin this journey and and one of them was\nafter three years of hearing\nno we finally got a yes\nto get one shot on qvc right one shot\nand it came and qvc is a live tv\nshopping channel so in the us they're\nbroadcast to 100 million homes live\nand there's no script and and\nevery company from apple iphone to dyson\nvacuum vitamix they all sell their\nproduct there\nand i had learned oh you can sell more\nproduct in an hour on qvc\nthan in a whole year in department\nstores so i'm like oh my gosh\nand my whole thing was like well if i\nget this shot if i can ever get on qvc\nlike let me you know let me take this\nhuge risk of instead of showing models\nof perfect skin\nlet me actually prove that i made a\nproduct that works for everyone and\nlike i had this vision of what if i just\ntake my makeup off and show my\nbright red rosacea what if i put women\nof all ages and sizes and shapes and\nskin tones and skin challenges like\nand as models and show live how the\nproduct works i had this whole vision\nyet for three years they said no every\ntime every time\nand by the way that's another example my\ngut kept saying\num you're supposed to be on qvc and for\nthree years they said no\nand i think when these things happen to\nus in our life when we have a gut\nfeeling\nbut then we're like oh it must have been\nwrong if you still\nfeel in your gut it's right it's right\nand you're supposed to keep going\nand and you know learning to look back\non those\nmoments i think is how how we build our\nmuscle and\nand you know we so we finally get this\nyes and this one shot on qvc\nand it is it's a long story i go to\ndetail in the book on how it happened\nand what happened and all that but\nyou know just to share one tiny piece of\nit uh we learned that in this one\nshot i was going to get in this\n10-minute window on live tv\nuh i would need to sell over 6 000 units\nof our concealer\nin this 10 minute window to hit the\nsales goal or not come back\nand we were only doing two to three\norders a day on our website and so\nwe didn't even have enough money to\nmanufacture the product get it in there\nso we applied for 22 sba loans the 23rd\nbank\ntiny bank in california said yes just\njust to covering the money to get this\none order off to qvc\nand it was consignment so what that\nmeant was in this 10 minute window right\ni get this one shot on national\ntelevision after three years ago\nand if we didn't hit the sales goal\nwhatever\nproduct didn't sell they would ship back\nto us and we wouldn't be paid for it\nright as a consignment deal\nand so you really shouldn't take this\nrisk as an entrepreneur but we were to\nthe point where\nit was like it was this i didn't exactly\nand\nso i thought okay you know do we have a\n10-minute window and i had this whole\nthought of what i was gonna do\nand we used some of the loan money to\nhire um third party consultants that\nhelped\nso many people sell their product on tv\nand they really\ntruly do help so many people uh and then\ni was faced with\nthis dilemma though because what they\nall told me was\nokay jamie like if you want a shot at\nsucceeding which most people fail\non qvc after one chance if you want a\nshot at succeeding here's what you need\nto do\nand they told me exactly what to do\nwhich was to cast\nall models that were in their early 20s\nyou know perfect skin and i'm like\nokay but that's not why i made this\nbusiness and\nis that why i made this product and you\ncan't fake authenticity so if i go out\nthere live on tv and i'm like\nyou know it's not it it'll create a\nbarrier or disconnection with me in the\ncustomer\nso i knew all those things today yet i\nwas like oh my gosh\ni get one shot i don't like like what do\ni do and and\nand i couldn't try it both ways and i\nflew out to qvc\na week early before this one shot on air\nand they're in pennsylvania so they're\nabout 30 minutes west of philly\nand i sat in this rental car all alone\nin the qvc parking lot\nuh which sounds creepy now because i've\nnow been in the parking lot thousands of\ntimes but this was\nbefore i ever got a first shot and i sat\nthere in the parking lot\nuh staring at the front door no like\nwatching people in and out all day for a\nweek straight and i sat there in that\ncar\nlike praying crying feeling like you\nknow because i think all of us go\nthrough these moments where we believe\nin our values\nbut then they get challenged and i just\nremember\nhonestly at times being like well maybe\nif i try it their way\nand then i get success and then i build\nmaybe then i'll try it my way that's\nauthentic\nlike this yes\nlike enter my head challenge my values\nand i'll never forget there was one\nmoment in that car where i just\nimagined like okay if i'm if i\nhave one shot like like what do i want\nto stand for\nat the end of the day and i imagine like\nwho that person was\nturning on their television and i don't\nknow why but i kept imagining like a\nsingle mom\nfolding laundry who had like forgotten\nlike was too busy to remember that she\nmattered and that she's beautiful\nand i had this crystal clear moment of\nintuition where i just\nrealized like i'd rather she's gonna\nbless me of two seconds of her precious\ntime\ni'd rather ever look up on her\ntelevision and see me showing women\nwho look like her calling them beautiful\nmeaning it like i'd rather have her see\nthat and be reminded of her\nown beauty and have her not buy anything\ni'd rather that happen\nthan me like sell a ton of product and\nstand for nothing and\nso i knew what i had to do and and\ni knew for me it was like how do i try\nand stand for something\nfor every little kid out there who's\nabout to see these\nimages and start doubting themselves and\nevery grown person who still does and\ni just knew what i had to do but\nhonestly it was really scary and i\nremember\nwalking into the studio for this one\nshot this this 10-minute window\nand jay you'll totally understand the\nsetup but there is cameras everywhere\na big um a big time clock on the floor\nat 10 minutes it was set for 10 minutes\nand i knew\nonce the host came to my set uh because\neverything's so quick in real time like\nthey'll go from dyson vacuum to\nyou know to me so once she came to my\nset and that clock started\nwe would be live to 100 million homes\nthat would get one shot\nand i learned which was really fun i\nlearned\noh if you're not selling hitting your\ngoal a minute or two in\nthey'll actually cut your time like you\ncould be at eight minutes left and jump\nto two minutes left\nand you know oh it's not going well and\nif you try to sell\nnothing sells so i was freaking out and\nyou know you talk a lot about this and\nabout\nvision and about mission about purpose\nand\nthose words of wisdom that are so\npowerful that you share\nare what help save me those ideas are\nwhat help save me in this moment and\nwhat i mean by that is in this like\n10 minute you know segment as we're\nabout to go live\nand i see the clock and it's like 9 59 9\n58\nand i'm live i would go into the space\nof\nis my dress too tight is my i felt the\nsweat dripping\nand i'm like in my head okay if i make\nthis about me\nin this moment i'm done like what like i\nhad to in that moment with so much\npressure\nremember why am i doing this and like oh\nit's way bigger than me it's literally\nnot about me\ni remember the moment my bare face\nbright red\nrosacea came up on national television\nand i was literally shaking like a leaf\nand\nand uh from the pressure of just the\nmoment and and i remember going over to\nall the other models all the real\nreal women all ages and skin tones and\nsizes and skin challenges like i have\nand\ni'll never forget there's about a minute\nleft and the host and i didn't know how\nit was going i was freaking out i knew\nthat they hadn't cut my time yet\nand there was about there was a minute\nleft and the host says\nuh the tan shades almost sold out the\ndeep shade is down to it and i'm like\nand shade started selling out and i just\nliterally\nand then i remember the 10 minute mark\nuh it hit and the big sold out sign came\nup\nacross the screen and i started crying\non national tv\nand my husband comes running through the\ndouble doors of the studio and i'm like\nreal women have spoken and he's like\nwe're not going bankrupt\nand you've met my husband you could\nprobably imagine doing that so we're all\ngoing bankrupt\nand and that one airing j\nthis is after three years of no right\nand that one airing which was september\nof 2010 turned into five earrings and\n101 earrings the next\nyear and then i did 250 live shows a\nyear\nuh for eight years and we built the\nlargest beauty brand in qvc's history\nand it is right now as you and i are\ntalking it is right now\nto this day and the only reason i share\nthat is because\nit was three years of no and like\nsomebody in your audience needs to hear\nthis today that like no one can tell you\nyou're not the right fit\nno one can and if you listen to your gut\nand you're knowing\nit's not about selling a company for a\nbillion dollars it's not about\nselling out on qvc it's about oh like\nlike like you said\nlike am i stepping into all of who i am\nand am i trusting that and those are the\nmoments that change our life\nyeah no wow that i mean i was literally\nwith you when you were sharing that and\nthat's what i love about the\nstorytelling in your book as well it's\nlike\ni'm with you and and i can feel it with\nyou and\nwhen you're talking about like whether\nyou're sweating or whether you look\nright like i'm with you and i can\ni i feel it all i you know what i love\nabout what you've just shared\nis that it it convinces me\nand gives me more confidence in faith\nin the idea that purpose is the only\nthing\nthat can let someone win because what\nyou're just sharing with us\nis you had to make it not about you it\nwas about the people\nwho are struggling with this skin\ncondition it was about the people\nthat are not being welcomed onto ads and\nnot welcomed into magazines and not\nwelcomed because\nof of the judgment that society had at\nthe time like and you were doing it\nbefore like i feel like a lot of these\ntopics are being talked about today\nyou know you're this is what we're\ntalking about is like 13 years ago\nright like 13 14 years ago and it was\nlike a\nseveral year journey to try and try and\nshift this to happen\nin the beauty space and um and the thing\nthat's so special\nto share is you know we built to\nmillions and millions of customers over\na thousand employees\nall of that and like i think it's like\n95\nthe last time i checked of our customers\nhave no skin issues wow\n95 right it's people that feel\nless alone and more enough and more\nseen and are tired of seeing images that\ndon't look like them and\nand don't just want to find great beauty\nmakeup products because actually it's\nnot even why i created the brand and\neven though i love our products\nit's like it's not like create a brand i\ncreated it for to try and shift culture\neven for women to be more confident on\nthe days they don't even want to wear\nmakeup you know what i'm saying to feel\njust as beautiful so it's like this\nway bigger bigger thing and exactly what\nyou said i think is so true and i you\nknow one of the stories i talk about\nin the book is this experience i had\nwith mean girls and dealing with that\nand\ni actually never was bullied as a kid\nand the first time i ever was bullied\nwas in my 30s in the qvc green room\nand it was like shocking because it was\nadult women and i've never shared i mean\n95\nof the book i've never shared before but\ni share these stories because\ni just want everyone going through them\nto connect and to see like oh\nyou know here's one idea of how to get\nthrough it and here's another\nperspective on it and\nyou know in this this story i had\nfriends i thought were my friends\nand by the way most of my close\ngirlfriends have been my friends for\nlike 20 years and they are amazing\nand they don't have they all have\ndifferent faiths different\nthey they don't vote the same they don't\nlove the same\nall the things and they are amazing so\ni'm blessed to have really great friends\nbut\none thing i learned is you know when you\nstart a new dream\nuh uh not everyone's happy when you\nactually start to become successful and\ni had this\nmoment where i i thought uh there's a\ncouple like just a handful\nof women who i really thought were my\nfriends and when my brand started really\ntaking off\nuh they didn't like that and i went\nthrough this this season of\nbullying which i go into in the book and\ni would i would like\ngo out and leave the leave a show after\nlike selling\nyou know all the sales pressure and i'd\nleave a show and go sit in the car and\ncry\nfor hours and then come back in and have\nanother show and just trying to get\nthrough it and figuring it all out\nand i had this big moment that was\nthe two big moments actually jay that\nhappened in the qvc green room that were\nlife-changing\nuh and i've now seen to be universal\nacross\nthousands of entrepreneurs i've met and\nall the the women i mentor now\num two big things happen in this in this\njourney of mean girls i realized oh my\ngosh\nso many of us think it's easy to think\nthat someone else's success\nuh takes away from our own uh and i\ndon't believe that's true\nand uh right it's not true and and\nwhat i decided to do in this moment of\ngetting bullying was not let it be a\ndistraction not\nactually even for a second think i'm\ncompeting with them\nand i had this big aha moment where i\nrealized\nlike and i believe this to my core\nuh none of us are here to compete with\nanyone else like we're here to i believe\nwe're here to compete\nwith with with the person we know we're\nborn\ncapable of becoming and\nthat person has nothing to do with\nanyone else\nlike that's to your point our own unique\npurpose our own\nunique calling and that's what i focused\non\nand even to this day jay i know i'm\nnowhere near\nthat person yet who i'm capable of\nbecoming but i'm sure\nyou know on my journey but the thing\nthat when i kept that as my focus\nwhat ended up happening in these eight\nyears i spent uh in the green room i saw\nthousands of entrepreneurs come and go\nand uh\nand when i look back at like oh what's\nthe commonality with the ones that\nactually made it and the ones that\nbuilt something that lasted or built\nsomething that matters and to your\nquestion earlier\nit's not how smart are they how\nqualified are they how\nright it's literally this simple this is\nwhat i've seen\nin thousands of entrepreneurs the ones\nthat were the same\non-air live selling to customers\nwhich is a form of connection right but\nas they are in the green room the people\nthat had that\nthat alignment were the same for better\nor worse\nsome are quirky and crazy and funny and\nsome are not very\nbut like the ones that were offensively\nthemselves on camera\nsame as in the green room those are the\nones that last\nright and and the whole idea right\nbecause you know all of the research out\nthere that you can't like it's\nimpossible to have a real human\nconnection unless you fully show up\nauthentically\nas yourself and so many people think oh\ni need to i'm distracted by social media\ni need to show up like somebody else or\nthis is working for someone else on\ntheir page or with their community so\nlet me try to show up that way because\nthen i'll get more followers or\nlike or let me show up this way in the\ndating world whatever it is\nwe're literally putting a barrier up of\ndisconnection when we show up\nas our representative and i watch this\nhappen\nthousands of times where someone would\nbe super\nyou know whatever in the green room\namazing funny happy sad introverted\nwhatever it is and then they go on air\nand they're their representative and you\ncan't fake authenticity\nand it's the most freeing lesson in the\nworld because\nit's so much pressure when you think you\nhave to\nchange who you are or be more like\nsomeone else or\nhide the parts of you that you feel like\nare past\nmistakes or are embarrassing or anything\nelse\nand it's like oh no the power is\nand the freedom and the freedom is in\nrealizing oh my gosh\nwhen i fully like fully show up as who i\nam for better or worse\nuh that's your super power and that's\nwhen people\nactually authentically connect with you\nwhether it's customers\nor your community online and i feel like\nwhen people get that it's the most\nfreeing thing in the world because it\ndoesn't matter what someone else is\ndoing on social media or this or that\nit's like all that matters is you like\nlike\nfully showing up as who you are and it's\nit's really\ni talk a lot about this in the book this\nidea that like\nlike authenticity alone doesn't\nguarantee success\nbut inauthenticity guarantees failure\nand i've just seen it now thousands of\ntimes and i just think it's\none of the most freeing things to learn\nand i think it helps us\nto use the words you shared earlier i\nthink it helps us\nbuild our confidence around becoming all\nof who we are\nyeah but i love the way you define\nauthenticity as\nalignment like between the green room\nand and being on stage because i think\nauthenticity today\nthere's a lot of misconception about\nauthenticity just means like\nbeing yourself and showing yourself but\nwhat you're saying is actually like\nyou know internally your integrity\nis aligned and what i love about the\nbook\nand this is what i recommend to everyone\nwhen you grab a copy you'll see this\nis that jamie walks through all the\nstruggles we have so you have chapters\nwhich you just mentioned\nbelieve in the power of authenticity but\nthen there's other beliefs that we all\nneed like believe\nin being brave over being liked and i\nlove the way the book structured\non what we need to believe in versus\nwhat we need to stop believing so\njamie i want to ask you this question\nand\nand i think it's going to really help\neveryone who's listening and watching\ntoday because when i'm\nspeaking to you i can i can feel your\njust\nbelief in humanity and belief in people\njust like\nit just you know bounces off you like\nit's coming through you like you really\nbelieve\nnot just in what you're saying but you\nreally believe in everyone who's\nlistening\nbut they're beating themselves up right\nnow there's someone who's listening to\nthis\nand they've just spent the whole day\nbeating themselves up they've spent the\nwhole week\nbeating themselves up and i almost think\nlike the opposite of belief is not doubt\nit's beating yourself\nup because doubt is questioning yourself\nand that's a\npositive healthy habit but the negative\nunhealthy habit is you're just\nbeating yourself up if someone's\nlistening right now and they've been\nbeating themselves up what would you say\nto them yeah i would say you're not\nalone\ni would say the very friend i love that\nyou're asking this question\nit's so important because i think when\nwe do beat ourselves up it's so easy to\nthink\num that we're alone in that that\nyou know other people don't do that it's\njust us and and\nand and we're wrong and we're bad and\nwe're damaged and all those things right\nand\ni think the first and most important\nthing is that i think\nthis is this is a universal thing that\nwe all that every person\nevery person um and i just think even\nthe way our brains are wired that we're\ntempted to do that\nand i think that uh you know the words\nwe say\nabout ourselves to ourselves right\nare the most important and\npowerful words so one of the things i i\nreally go into\nin my book and i talk about this a lot\nis this idea of\num almost an imaginary volume\nuh uh dial uh another thing i talk about\na good friend of mine bob goff taught me\nthis lesson and i said oh my gosh\nit was just in a small group\nconversation i'm like this has changed\nmy\nit changed my life and i'm like bob can\ni share this with everyone because this\nis going to serve a lot of people and i\ntalk about this too where he talks about\nthe power of your own microphone right\nso\nuh here's the thing we all need to get\nreally good at\nand this this takes practice and it\ntakes time\nand it takes intentionality in terms of\njust being aware of it\num but i imagine like a\na a volume dial right and\nwe need to get really good at knowing um\nwhen to turn the volume down on stuff\nand when to turn the volume up\non stuff right and for example with the\nguy that said to me no one will buy\nmakeup from someone who looks like you\nor i could go into\nliterally thousands of stories jay about\nabout\nabout some of the rejections and some of\nthe things that that people said to me\nalong the journey and\nyou know even to this day i mean every\none of us hops on social media\nand it's so easy to see a great you know\nbeautiful positive message and it's just\nas easy to find someone saying something\nhurtful\nright so this is something that's a\nuniversal\nexperience um and whether it's someone\nsaying this on social media or it's\nus saying it to ourselves we have to get\nreally good at and the way i do this\ni imagine i i literally imagine this\nimaginary volume dial where\ni and still to this day you know i still\nhave thoughts of self-doubt that pop\nup about the most random things and i'm\nnow able to catch them\ni literally imagine myself turning the\nvolume down on them\nand i instantly replace it with\nsomething positive\nthat somebody said that i believe i know\nit's true\nbut we we are not built to remind\nourselves of all the positive things\nabout ourselves right we have to do it\nintentionally\num and i share a story in the book of\nwell\nfirst i want to say too uh about the\nmicrophone thing\na lot of us uh uh have friends and\nfamily\naround us that mean well\nand that we want to keep in our life\nbecause they've been in our life forever\nand all the things\nbut when we share our hopes or our\ndreams with them\nor when we share our struggles with them\nthey say things\noften with a great intention that just\naren't for us that just lower our\nvibration\nright and one of the things i talked\nabout that my friend bob goff shared and\ni talked about this a lot in the book is\nlearning how who to hand your own\nmicrophone to in life to speak into\nand when you need to take that\nmicrophone back and a lot of people\nstruggle because maybe they watch your\nshow and they have big you know\nuh vision for the kind of life or the\nkind of health or the kind of\nlove that they want in their life but\nthen they're\nsharing that and those thoughts and\nthose ideas with people in their circle\nor in their family or\nin their home and then instantly they\nfeel their vibration get lower\ninstantly they go back to that place of\nself-doubt and so\none big thing um and i talk about this a\nlot and believe it is\nyou know holding your own microphone i\nimagine for anyone listening and not\nwatching this imagine\na news reporter who's holding a\nmicrophone and they hand it over to\nsomebody\nto speak into right and give their story\nand then they're able to take their\nmicrophone back\nif you watch really seasoned tv news\njournalists they never let go of their\nmicrophone\nbecause they know if you give it to\nsomeone who's giving you a firsthand\naccount of a\nsomething or other that person will take\nthat microphone and you have a hard time\ngetting it back on live tv\nthat's such a good analogy that's such a\ngood analogy but imagine in real life\nevery second jay we're giving our\nmicrophone to someone else when we're\nletting them speak in into our life\nright and sometimes it's like a friend\nat the gym\nand sometimes it's you know a family\nmember\nbut we have to get really good at going\noh when i'm struggling\nand when i you know need someone to talk\nto and i talk to this person\nis this filling my soul is it helping me\nif it's\nnot you have to take your microphone\nback from that person you can still keep\nthem in your life but maybe you talk to\nthem about like\nwhat happened on the bachelor last night\nor whatever but you don't talk to them\nabout your struggles\nand similarly you know so many people i\nknow watch your show and are inspired\nfor their own purpose and their own\nsense of health and their own sense of\npeace\nand you know if you share these ideas\nmaybe with a partner maybe it's your\nspouse or your boyfriend a girlfriend or\na significant other whatever\nthey may not be on that same path of\nenlightenment and personal growth and\nand you might be so frustrated that you\nkeep sharing it with them and then\nyou're just like\noh so listen like and then all you're\ndoing is literally stealing your own joy\nand lowering your own vibration when you\nkeep trying to do that and so\ni've learned this lesson and i think\nit's so powerful of taking your\nmicrophone back and\nand similarly you know why you and i\ntalked i think for 14 hours the first\ntrip we're on and roddy and all the\namazing people on that trip\nis like oh you can feel when you're\nspeaking into each other's microphone\nand your vibrations going higher\nand and people get it and they're\ndreaming and it's not that people tell\nyou what they want to hear they'll still\ncall you out in your crap but like\neveryone has this this this vibration\nright and\nand i think knowing and by the way\nyour show can be something that someone\nputs their microphone up to right\nit doesn't always have to be a person\nphysically in their life\nyour book is it perfect that's a perfect\nexample absolutely\nyeah exactly and so that is huge um\nand and what i would say for people you\nknow really\njust struggling with that inner critic\nis that i think it is a practice\num of identifying it and and for me\nof course i am the biggest proponent of\ntherapy and i'm the biggest proponent of\npersonal growth and\nand all of those things um and in my\nbook i share a lot of the tools that\nworked for me\nbecause i think that you know so many of\nus are in that spot and\nthat self-doubt takes over um we start\nto you know\nhold on to past labels people put on us\nuh words they said about us past\nmistakes\num past miscalculations or regrettable\nincidents or things we did wrong\nbut like i believe in life like we're\nnot\nour past mistakes or any of those things\ni believe\nwe're our intentions um going forward\nand\nand i think that you know starting some\nof these\nimplementing some of these tools from\nthe book and into real life is\nis is really big because for me\ni battled self-doubt my whole life and\nyou know there are so many stories the\ninvestor and the weight one is just one\nof many\nthere are so many um that i share and\ntalk about how did i get through and\nand you know i would create this\nimaginary toolbox that i would just go\nback from and pull from and\nand one thing in my imaginary toolbox is\njust every time i\nevery time i catch myself you know\nuh putting myself down telling myself\nthings like you're not qualified either\nset\ni pull from another moment and i replace\nthat in my own mind\nand i try to turn the volume up on that\nright and sometimes it could be\nyou know something kind that somebody\nsaid in the line at starbucks like\nsometimes it could be someone saying oh\nyou just brighten my day and i'll remind\nmyself oh\nand i turned the volume up on that um\nthere's a moment i share\nthe first time when i met michelle obama\nand something she shared to\nto me in the book and and she just said\nthe most beautiful\nwords and i won't i won't i won't give\nup the story but\nthose words i replay them in my mind\nright\nso when i have moments like i'm tempted\nto replay my own self-doubt\ni literally turn it down and i replace\nit and i think that's a big thing\num and i think it's important to know\nwe're not alone and it's all a journey\nyou know the way we started this\nconversation i think is so relevant to\nthis question\nwhich is all of us have these\nexperiences of self-doubt and\nthen we all of a sudden have the noise\nof other people's opinions or\nif you're launching a business or\nbuilding a community online like\nwhat i went through was years of no\nproof that my idea was going to work\nso when we have no proof around us that\nwhat we're doing might be successful and\nwe have\nyou know friends and family worried\nabout us saying are you sure you could\nshould have quit your job or\nare you sure you're qualified all those\nthings right and then we have rejection\nand we have our own self-doubt\nit can be so loud that we literally\nend up like like staying in our comfort\nzone\ndecide talking ourselves out of our own\ntruth\nright staying in our comfort zones never\nstarting the dream never\nyou know writing the book never creating\nthe blog in the podcast or\nright all those things we stay in our\ncomfort zone which makes a lot of other\npeople more comfy too\nbut then it chips away at our own soul\nand i think\nit's it it robs us from from becoming\nthe person\nwe're born to be um so it's a journey\ni think of intentionality and and we're\nall in this together right and what a\nbeauty a beautiful thing that\nanybody going through this right now is\nable to hear your show and is able to\nhear\nyou and me and connect with us and\nbecause you know\nwe're we're all the same i believe we're\nall connected absolutely and i believe\nwe all have the same\nhopes and doubts and fears
