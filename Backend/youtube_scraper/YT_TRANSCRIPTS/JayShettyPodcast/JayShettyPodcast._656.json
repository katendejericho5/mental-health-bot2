    "transcript": "how do we make what we do worthwhile and\npurposeful\nand it's not it's a question i asked 30\nyears ago 30 plus years ago but it's a\nquestion i still ask today the answer is\ndifferent\num and the mechanism to realize it is\ndifferent still\nbut the questions aren't i believe the\nworld needs a new set\nof real models people with deep\nintentions behind their actions\nand this is where you meet them today's\nguest\nis kenneth cole and i'm so grateful\nbecause we all know he's a designer he's\nan activist\nhe's a married father of three who\nbelieves that he thrives at work\nthe home and his community because he\nmerges the three worlds kenneth i'm so\ngrateful honored and happy to have you\nhere thank you so much for coming\nthank you jay thank you very much i\ndon't know that i thrive in each of\nthose areas i aspire\nto thrive in all three of those areas\nabsolutely and\nlast time we were together you were so\ngracious and patiently sat and listened\nto\nme tell my story i'm glad that i get to\nreciprocate today\nand listen to your incredible journey\nyour brand which is\n35 years bold which i love but i want to\nstart by asking you that question\nbecause i think my audience will love it\nhow do you merge those three worlds\nbecause i feel that today\nwe live in a world that's so\ndisconnected people see their work\ntheir family their friends as these\nthree separate parts\nbut you've somehow aspired to merge them\nhow does that work let's unpack that\nwell i think\nthey are separate parts and i but i\nthink that\nbeing successful in anything that we set\nout to do\nis all-consuming and it requires making\nsignificant life compromises which is\nnot in not easy for anybody in and of\nitself\nso and so one can be successful\nprofessionally invariably\nthey're taking away from their personal\nneeds\nand because they're working extra hours\nand they're giving of themselves\nphysically as well as emotionally\nmentally they're not present\nto the degree they need to be and um and\nthen if they're successful personally\nand their personal lives are coming\ntogether and\nthen very often they're struggling the\nprofessional quotient\nof component doesn't always fall in line\nand then if you layer on top of that\nyou know the community outreach or\nengagement\nfriends then it complicates it even\nfurther so i\ni came to realize absence of a good\ntherapist that um\nthat if i could somehow marry them\num and by my what i did from\nnine or whenever it was i that i showed\nup in the office was addressing multiple\nagendas simultaneously\nthen i was more likely to find\nfulfillment in that process\nso i brought social engagement into my\nbusiness model\nvery early on in the process and i'm not\nsure it was intentional or it just\nhappened and then by um by nature of it\nof being able to bring all these\nincremental resources to it\nit became successful in that regard and\num\nand then and also familial at the same\ntime as well personal\nand professional and social engagement\num\nat every intersection and um\nand and i encourage people to do it but\nit's it's hard\nit's hard to be successful in anything\nlet's let's rewind a little because\nyou talk about how of course you were\ngoing to law school\nand then you switch into fashion\nbecause you have this rebellious nature\nand you thought that fashion didn't have\nany rules\nas opposed to law tell us tell us about\nthat transition so i was going to go to\nlaw school because\ni didn't know what i wanted to do and i\nthink i'm all about creating\nalternative paths and so if i with a\nlegal education i could now have one\nmore\nset of of opportunities hopefully um to\nto look forward to um but in that\nprocess um\nmy father has small shoe factory at the\ntime in this\nvery depressed area of new york\nwilliamsburg\ni love how it's changing and it's voice\nof chase so then\num so i worked with him one summer and i\nhaven't kept navigating to the pattern\nroom to the design room and i\nbecause i was fascinated because that's\nwhere it all happened it didn't happen\nand if the product\nwas distinctive and specifically\nappropriate business would reflect it\nand if it wasn't it wasn't so that's\nwhere i kept finding myself and i\nlearned how to make shoes i wanted to\nmake patterns i wanted to\ntaught myself how to draw technically\nwhich i had up until that point\nand um and i realized quickly\nthat law is about\nit's reading it's a book and he who\nlearns it the best\num goes the furthest and he who can\ninterpret it the most successfully\nrealizes the greatest rewards whereas in\nbusiness um\nyou pretty much write your own book\nevery day you write your rules and the\nfashion business specifically the\nfurther those rules are from anything\nwritten before you\nthe more likely it is that you'll be\nsuccessful\nso there's essentially there's no\nboundaries so\nyou know we're taught as children to\ndraw within the lines but you realize in\nin my business that\nthey're more successful than success\nusually is outside those lines\nso um and i was fascinated with it and\nuh\nand success was relatively reasonably\num short and coming um or\nrewards from that success is a tough is\na difficult word for me to\nbut um why is it difficult to explain\nwell because it's\nit's so subjective and success in\nwhat was successful yesterday only\ndefines new boundaries for tomorrow\nso and uh and we can't\nkind of cite we can't harbor over what\nhappened yesterday because then\nwe fail in our ability to do what we\nneed to do tomorrow so\num but we can get that yeah so\num i realized that that\nthe this business the shoe business at\nthe time specifically was\nwas fascinating to me and there was\nessentially no no boundaries and\nand you take this this\nshoe this um object\nand you can transform it in so many\ndifferent subtle ways and\nand sometimes even the most subtle ways\nmake the greatest\num change and impact the greatest so\nand i stayed on that path and i kept\ndiffering going to law school and i\neventually never went\nwhat's your advice for people who are\nlistening who feel like you did\nthey chose to do something because they\ndon't know what to do\nand i find so many people find that they\nend up in college degrees or\njobs or positions and companies because\nthey just didn't know what to do\nhow did you kind of break away from that\nand start using that as a\nlaunch pad to explore well i don't know\nthat i\ni broke away from it i i still sometimes\nwonder if i know what to do but\ni i knew that that what i was doing\nfelt good and i knew that i could do\nthis\nin a way that could be um meaningful in\nsome way\nand so and i knew i needed to explore\nit further and um and i and\nlaw school i could probably always do\nand i was only my interest in all it\nreally was just\nto create more opportunities for myself\nand i found that i was on a path that\num that uh\nwas was fulfilling just to as to a\ndegree so it just stayed on that path\nright and you ended up posing as a\nfilmmaker\nto be able to sell shoes at the\nbeginning tell us about that introduce\nus that story because i love it\nso i left that working with my father\nafter a couple years and i wanted to do\nmy own\nthing and it was a hard decision but\ni knew if i didn't do it then it would\nmy life would only get more complicated\nas i got older and\num and i was still single and i\nhad no real obligations in the world and\ni\nso i had a little bit of money but not\nenough to start a business and\num like very little bit of money so and\ni\nuh there wasn't these\nmechanisms in place like tech world has\ntoday where you can raise\nyou can do a raise and you can outsource\nand you can crowdsource and you can find\nall these resources i didn't have that\nso\ni go fund me yeah right so i uh\nwanted to start a business it was more\npersonal when i um\nso i left what i was doing\nand i\nneeded to a and i i named the company i\nset up a company i named it kenneth cole\nbecause\nthere weren't these search engines then\nwhere you could\nmake up a name and find out if it was\nownable\nbecause you would it the process\ninvariably took 18 months before you\nknew\nthere were objections and then you had\nto address those objections\nand then maybe you had to you'd win or\nyou'd lose and you'd have to rename your\nyour business so i you could almost\nalways get your name your own name\num registered so i named the company\nkenneth cole\nand i ran to italy\num knowing i had a better chance of\ngetting credit\nfrom an italian shoe factory that needed\nbusiness than from an american bank that\ndidn't\nand so i found a couple factories and i\nfound some people over there that were\nwanted to\nhelp me and i designed a line of cool\nladies shoes\nand then i came back and had to sell\nthem and there was a trade show at the\ntime the new york shoe show is what it\nwas called and then\nat the time and in that process you had\ntwo choices you could\ntake a room at the hilton hotel and\nthere were about 1100\nother shoe companies and there was 34 30\nsomewhat companies per four and the\nbuyers would come and they'd walk all\nthe floors\nnot very um distinctive not\num very differentiated and um and not\nwithout\ncost so and then the other\noption was to take a big fancy showroom\nwithin a two buck radius of the hilton\nhotel with clearly i didn't have the\nmoney\nor the time for that either so on a whim\ni called the friend who was in the\ntrucking business and i said if i could\nfigure out\nhow to park one of your 40-foot trailers\nacross the street from the hilton hotel\nwould you lend it to me and he said sure\njerk\nthis is new york you can't park a\nbicycle for 10 minutes let alone a truck\nfor four days\ni said if i could figure it out will you\nlend it to me he says you could figure\nout i'll help you decorate it so i\ncalled the mayor's office with mayor\nkoch at the time\nso excuse me mr mayor how does one get\npermission to park a 40 patrol in the\ncorner six damage 56th street\non december first week in samurai sorry\nson they don't this is new york\nwe get permission only into two\ncircumstances if you are a utility\ncompany servicing the streets a t or\ncon-ed\nor if you're a production company\nshooting a full-length motion picture\nbecause we were going through an isle of\nnew york campaign\nin the early 80s and we probably still\nare today so i said thank you mayor hung\nup the phone\nthat afternoon i went to a stationery\nstore changed the letterhead from\nkenneth cole inc the kenneth cope\nproductions inc\nfiled for a permit the following morning\num with the mayor's office\nfor permission to shoot a falling motion\npicture called the birth of a shoe\ncompany\ni opened for business on december 2nd a\nweek later 10 days later\num and i had two new york policemen as\nmy doorman compliments of our fine man\nand i had a creepy extensions and i\nhad a director and sometimes it was\nfilming this camera sometimes it wasn't\nand um we saw every important buyer in\nnew york\nthe more important they were the longer\nwe made them wait and\nwe sold 40 000 pair of shoes in two and\na half days\nthere was a phone booth on the corner\nthat was my line\nof connection to the to the source the\nfactories\nand i was changing the orders from high\nheels low heels to red to blue\nand these shoes in\nsix weeks and and um and i tell that\nstory\nstill because it speaks to the\nimportance of resourcefulness and\nproblem solving the best solution is\nrarely\nthe most creative it's so rarely the\nmost expensive it's almost always the\nmost creative\nand the company um by the way went\npublic 10 years later traded in the new\nyork stock exchange the same was kcp\nchemical production\nand we stayed public for 20 years we\njust recently went private\ni love that story it's i mean\nwhat you just said there the amount of\npeople that\nonly see the blocks i mean the fact that\nyou call the mayor up in the first place\nand the mayor actually picked up no\nno there's somebody in his office but\nyeah\nand but the nuance there by the way is\nnot\ncan i park the truck there because your\nanswer would have been no the question\nis\nhow can i park the truck yes and then\nwhat scenario and that in that\nin that question was the answer i needed\nso um\nand i figured out what i needed to be in\norder to be able to do\nwhat i needed what i hoped to accomplish\nyeah\nso and if he had said no if that wasn't\nwe were\nprobably found another path no\ndefinitely and that's what i love that\ntoday i feel there's\nespecially for everyone watching and i\nhear this so often that there's just\noh this doesn't work or i tried this but\nthat path had a block\nor we went down this road and then it\ngot cut off and\ni feel like a lot of us are constantly\nfinding excuses or finding\nblocks more often than what you just\nsaid it was just about asking the right\nquestion\nright that's another question to the\nright person in the right way\nand um go a restaurant do you have\navailability no\nbut under what scenario could you have\nso do you still practice that today do\nyou have to still practice that has that\nenergy\ntoday do that in the ordinary course\nbecause there are inherent obstacles in\neverything\nwe do so the question is how do we get\nfrom here to where we need to\nin the most efficient and productive way\nin an an appropriate way by the way i\ndon't\ni don't seek to do anything that's\ninappropriate nor was what i did that\nday inappropriate\nbut although i do know that today if the\nmayor's office is much more careful\num because issue permits because i've\ntold this story so many times but\nbut based upon the rules they existed i\nwasn't inappropriate in fact we that\nstory never got\nthat movie never got i'm told\nunfortunately but\nin this world of content creation but um\ndo you have any of the footage well\nsome of that footage actually is on our\ncompany uh website\nyes also i think on our uh company's\ninstagram\num some of the original trailer footage\nthat's brilliant if anyone listening\nright now watching does not get inspired\nby that\nto figure out a way to their goal you\nknow i don't know what will\nthat's it's there's so many elements in\nthere where you had to just\nmake it work call a different person and\nthe fact that you're ordering\nyou know like you said now we have\ntechnology now we have social media you\nwere standing next to a pay phone\nto make your orders right like that a\nlot of quarters\nyeah yeah exactly yeah stacked on top\nexactly\njust keep going there and i just feel\nlike that resourcefulness is something\nthat's so useful today as a skill\nand we have more resources to be\nresourceful with right\nbut it's the mindset it's such a it's a\ntotally different world today\nand the obstacles the objectives the\nchallenges are just different\none of the challenges today you know i\nmean you just speak to people in my\nbusiness today and they say\nyou know everybody everywhere is\ncompetitor it's too hard\nand because everybody who offers product\nproduct is available to everybody\neverywhere there's literally an infinite\namount of alternatives\nbecause by the time you get halfway\nthrough that list there's twice as many\nthat have since been created so\nyes and so but\ni argue make the case that there's also\ntwice as many infinite amount of\nopportunities as a result\nso you can look at the obstacles you\ncould you can look at uh\nlook at it from another context and um\neverybody who makes shoes or fashion\neverywhere\nis is a competitor but everybody who\nconsumes fashion\na product everywhere is a customer\nabsolutely so\nyou know it's a different time but we\njust changed and it kind of refocused\nthe lens through which we see it\nand and it's something that that we do\nevery day how do we make an\nimpact in the world how do we make a\nmeaningful impact in people's lives\nand how do we make what we do worthwhile\nand purposeful and it's not it's a\nquestion i asked 30 years ago 30 plus\nyears ago but it's a question i still\nask today the answer is different\num and the mechanism to realize it is\ndifferent still\nbut the questions aren't definitely and\nand that leads us on nicely because\nin 1985 when you launched the aids\ncampaign you say that shifted\nthe brand forever it was such a huge\nmoment for the brand\nwhat were your answers to that question\n30 years ago yeah\nbecause um well\njust you you need to create the context\nwhat was happening in 1985 so\num so i've been in business now a couple\nyears and\ni was um and my goal was always\nto figure out how to speak to people\nabout\nwhat was not just on the body but was on\ntheir mind and\nknowing that i'd have a much more\nmeaningful connection relationship\nand much more sustainable than any heel\nheight or any hemline thor\nso and so i would periodically reflect\non\nwhat what we were all um\nconsumed with and at that point there\nwas this pervasive consciousness that we\nhadn't seen since the 60s\nand it was about\nhunger and it was\nto a large degree in ethiopia and there\nwere these initiatives that were\nhappening um constantly there was\num uh it was we are the world um\nwith michael jackson and quincy jones\nand and it was live aid and it was world\naid it was hands across america\nand everybody wanted to be part of\nsomething bigger than\nthey were something i hadn't really\nexperienced in my\num somewhat uh adult life\nand so but it was odd because nobody was\ntalking about\nwhat was really this glooming dark cloud\ncalled hiv aids because actually wasn't\neven called aids yet it was just hiv\nbecause\nif you did you would um\nbecause well a the stigma attached to\npeople\nwho had hiv was so\nsevere um and so significant and if you\naddressed it publicly you were perceived\nto be at risk\nand that meant you were either\nintravenous drug user you were\nmaybe haitian or you were gay and\nthe stigma against each of those groups\nwas was overwhelming um\nso i saw this rare opportunity to talk\nabout something that was really\nimportant that nobody was talking about\nand and i only had a little bit of money\nat the time we were a very small company\nso we did a i did a campaign\ni reached out to annie leibowitz who\num was and then she still is an\nimportant social photographer\nand um and annie agreed to help me i\ndon't think she knew who i was at the\ntime\nand she loved the message and showed up\nthe idea and we reached out to all these\nmodels the biggest models in the\nindustry and\nthey all wanted to do it so we did a\ncampaign\nthat speak spoke about the fact that\nnobody was speaking about\nthis ominous um ominous dark cloud\ncalled aids hiv aids and um\nit changed me changed the man changed\nthe brand\nand the company in in a very profound\nway and\nyou know i had it what i was doing\nwas fulfilling but it wasn't meaningful\nand and i had a hard time asking my\nassociates\nto put in the hours and do what they do\nwhat i needed them to do and do\nto be successful um because i don't\nbelieve\nanybody can really be successful doing\nanything today nine to five\num and between your physical engagement\nyour emotional involvement your\nresources you need to bring to bear at\nanything you want to do requires\nyou know making a commitment so um i\nneeded to make what i was doing more\nimportant than it was\num in the ordinary course and\nand this did it it just made it\nimportant and we\nand we stayed on this path and i was\nasked\nto do um we did this campaign and i did\nit in conjunction with amphar who was\nthe\none of the only aids research\norganizations at the time\nso we did it bringing shining light on\ntheir work\nand uh and i believe that cure phrase\nwould only come from research and that's\nwhat anthra did\nand then a year or so later year later\nthey asked me to join the board\nand and i did and then they asked me to\nbecome chairman in 2004\nand i did and in the 14 years\nfrom that point forward and\nand in the many years throughout i um\nand far had a very profound impact on\nmillions of people's lives\nand um millions of people were alive i\nbelieve\nnot because of that for a little bit\nbecause of a lot of air force important\nwork\nuh and i continued to do personal\nefforts to engage a global hiv community\nand uh and in 2004 the simultaneously i\ndid a campaign that\na global campaign that we all have aids\nif we don't have it\nmeant physically we have it socially or\nspiritually\nand will infect if we're not affected\nregardless we're infected\nif we're not infected we're affected and\num\nand i i got a different photographer at\nthe time mark seliger\nand he and i flew to south africa and we\nphotographed nelson mandela and desmond\ntutu and sakia committed and we\nphotographed dr solomon in india and and\nelizabeth\nand elton john in los angeles and so um\nand the bringing together the community\nhad not been done before\nand that was you know a level\nof engagement fulfillment that i had\nnever experienced in\nbut again still it was then\nset a new standard from which i now had\nto go further and\nand um you know i've continued\nto do that um and it continues to be um\nmake everything more meaningful it's\nit's beautiful hearing about it for\nsomeone like me in my generation looking\nback\nbecause often we think that all of these\nchallenges are new\nbecause we're experiencing them for the\nfirst time and so when you're hearing it\nback from\nsomeone who's a change maker who's\nactually been working on meaningful\nthings for such a long period of time\ntwo questions come to mind\nthe first one is i feel like from a\npersonal level\neveryone has to get to that point in\nlife where they may be doing something\nthat's fulfilling like you said but it's\nnot deeply meaningful\ni feel like everyone has to or will get\nto that stage in their life\nwhere they have to ask that question\nwhat are you i also don't know at the\nend if those two\nexpressions are mutually exclusive i\ndon't know if anything could be\nfulfilling but it isn't at some level\nmeaningful sure\njust to you or to people you that are in\nyour life\npeople that that um\nthat inspire you or are inspired by what\nyou do\nso um so i think we're always\nsearching for that and and that's a\nmoving target i don't think it doesn't\nchange and i think every day we come to\nwork and we\nyou know we look at it and people you\nknow people at the time\ni'll go back a little bit to when i\nstarted the business and they said to me\nwere you nervous because you put a lot\nat stake you know you left where you\nwere\nand you you really made it hard to ever\ngo back and you made a commitment to\ndo this without really knowing what you\nknow where this was going to take you\nand you know was it hard was were you\nnervous and i said you know what\ni never really thought\nabout that scenario i never thought\nabout it\nin that regard about failing and um\nand i i then i want to say but i knew\nsomehow i'd make it work\nbut what i didn't explain to people\nbecause i didn't know how to\nwas i never that the it\nwas very undefined and continues to be\nyeah so because the factors and\ninfluences continue to change every day\nso and i knew i'd figure out how to stay\nrelevant and how to have a reason to\nexist and i\nand and that the need to do that\nyou know is still exists today 35 years\nlater\nand that was my second question that\nseeing as you were asking these\nquestions\n30 years ago you were thinking about\nthis stuff 30 years ago do you think\nthat we've gotten closer to a more\nevolved world where people are asking\nthese questions more often\nor are we going backwards are we still\nin the same place or is it always the\nsame cycle there's a beautiful quote by\nmark twain where he says history doesn't\nrepeat itself but it always rhymes\nand so i wonder where how does that fit\ninto this where does that\nthought process fit into this so you\nknow\ni i think that we need to learn you know\nwe need to\nknow what the past so that we know\nhow to contextualize the present in the\nfuture so\nand in fashion i was always obsessed\nwith\nthe universal alternatives and not so\nthat i knew what to make but often so i\nknew what not to make\nand nobody needs what's there so but\nabsent of knowing\nwhat what the current existing\nalternatives are you don't know how to\nhow to um create a creative innovative\nalternative so um so you need to know\nthe history you need to know\nthe present and um and and i love mark\ntwain\nyeah so uh me too uh right so um\nyou know and i think it's you know we\nreflect on her often i at the time when\ni started doing my work with amfar it\nwas\nthere wasn't there wasn't this\ncollective\num uh i forget what they called at the\ntime um\ncorporate um social responsibility uh\ni mean this wasn't it just was something\nthat seemed right to do there wasn't a\nname for it\nand there wasn't a classification a\ncharacterization of it per se\nmaybe it was philanthropy at some level\nbut\nand then you know interestingly um i\nlearned over the years and partially\nfrom my daughter\num my middle\namanda who was obsessed with not\nthat we're doing philanthropy because\nplan three or something that\nor community engagement was something\nthat you should do and everybody did\nbut it became about not just what you\ndid but how you did it and the impact\nthat you made\nand the transparency within which you\ncommunicated that\nand um so\nyou know so the process of you know of\nour community outreach\nhas changed profoundly over the years\nand and how we engage with communities\nand and how we do it in a way that\nensures\nresults uh with absolute transparency\nand accountability\nis um is is really important\ntoday which in the past wasn't so so\ni don't know if that yeah it does yeah i\nknow absolutely it does answer my\nquestion yeah\none of the things i love about you ken\nfrom our from a couple of weeks that\nwe've had\nis that you're extremely humble uh and\nin\nin a positive way you're confident that\nyou're humble in the sense that you you\nalways consider yourself a learner\nyou always consider you're growing and\nyou feel that\nthere's this beautiful quote that i\npicked out of yours actually so now i\nget to quote you\nas well it's quite mark twain in the\nsame podcast so we have i wanted\nhere we go it's uh if you stand on what\nyou've accomplished\nit gets in the way of what you still\nneed to do\nand when i read that it reminded me of\nsteve jobs and i was sharing with you\nearlier that\nsteve jobs when he came back to apple he\nsaw that in the entrance they had this\napple museum\nand he asked for it to be destroyed\nbecause he didn't want to live\nand work for a company that was still\nliving and operating in the past\nhow do you practically apply that\nmindset every day at work\nand how do you get the people that you\nwork with to apply that mindset as well\nbecause actually\nmajority of us are quite happy to just\ncelebrate the past and\nlive on the glories and the success of\nthe past and nostalgia\nwe always think about the good old days\nit's part of our human psychology\nhow have you shifted that how do you get\nother people to shift as well\nso i didn't know that story about steve\njobs but\nbut i one of my biggest regrets but\nmaybe it's a conscious\nprocess so it shouldn't be is that i\ndon't have any an archive\nof my past products over the 30 years\nand people have always said\nasked me that wow and i never saved it\nbecause i always felt\nmaybe because we need to stay focused on\ngoing forward and at these various\nmilestones in my career\npeople have encouraged me to write books\nand tell these stories and and i\nresisted it\nand i've still never really told the\nwhole story\ni've told it anecdotally in a book\ncalled footnotes\n15 years ago and then in a um\nrecently in a book um\ncalled a kenneth called production or\nsomething but\nit was episodic and it wasn't really\nabout it it wasn't the story because i'm\ni'm i believe that if we allow ourselves\nto it's like driving a car if you're\ngoing to look in the rearview mirror\nyou're going to\nyou're going to miss that next bump in\nthe road so you if you\ndon't stay focused on where we have to\nbe you need to go\nyou significantly encumber your\nlikelihood of getting there\nand and i do believe that what we've\ndone\nover these years is we've built a great\nfoundation from which to do what we\nfirst now need to do\nand um and you can't\nstay idle in in the business which is\nwhy it's a great business the fashion\nbusiness but\num but it's also why it's so difficult\nso\num and i think it's an indulgence that\ni've\navoided um you know reflecting too much\non\non on the past and but it's\nit is true i do think we need to stay\nfocused on the future\nand and and i and i don't want to\ncelebrate the past anymore except to the\ndegree that now this is what defines our\nplatform\nand i say to people that\num there is a literally an infinite as i\nsaid\namount of alternatives today to what we\nbring to market\nnobody needs what we sell which is very\nhumbling\nthere's not an american that needs\nanother pair of shoes um\neven most people you know without\nmeans have shoes today and maybe not the\nshoes they want and maybe\nnot but in the condition that they\nshould have but\num uh and if as i've\nsaid if we closed our stores tomorrow at\nnoon it's hardly in america would go\nbarefoot for\nfor 14 years so um\nwe uh we need to give\nwe need to make them think they want it\nglad they thought it and think it again\num but at the end of the day we can't\ndelude ourselves and we need to be\nrealistic and understand\nthat we create something that people\nneed to want they don't\nneed but if we attach it to something\nthat that\nconnects with them in a meaningful way\nthen what we do becomes more meaningful\nbut i i didn't answer your question i\nthink that's true that's okay i loved it\ni loved the tangent you went on it was\nit was a great tangent and that's that\ncomes back to your whole principle of\nit's not just what people stand in it's\nwhat they stand for\nand and that reminds me everything you\ndo just echoes\nin timelessness for me and that's what i\nlove like it literally echoes because\nthere's a beautiful statement by martin\nluther king around\nyou know someone who stands for nothing\nwill fall for anything\nand then there's another beautiful\nstatement that says\nsomeone who has nothing to die for has\nnothing to live for\nand then when i hear your statement\naround people who have it's not just\nabout what they stand in it's what they\nstand\nfor and i truly agree with you i i\nbelieve with you that\nthat fashion without meaning or clothes\nwithout meaning\ndon't make us happy they don't stand for\nanything beyond and actually that's\nwhere we get become consumers\nright as opposed to conscious creators\nor expressives\nright i i knew where i was going oh\nyou're going tell me i\njust do i just you just prompted me\nremember so\npeople have infinite choices today\ni believe after all these years i've\nearned the right\nonly to be considered and every day i\nhave to earn the right to be chosen\nand i can't become complacent and relax\nin and rest on what we've done in the\npast because i need to be\nrelevant um and\na relevant a competitive and relevant\nalternative\ntoday and then even more so tomorrow\nyeah absolutely i feel like that\nthat old cliche of curiosity killed the\ncat needs to change the complacency\nkilled the cat\nbecause curiosity should be encouraged\ncuriosity should be\nthe future that's that's how we explore\nit's complacency that actually\nmakes you fall back and fall behind and\nlose\nright right yeah i agree but it's not i\nmean\nyou yeah i just think you\nyou need to every day contextualize what\nyou're doing\nand um because\nit's moving so fast and today in my\nworld everything is global\neverything is interconnected you know\nthe notion of building\na physical wall separating two countries\num is so so silly\nto me because the end of the day we are\nso connected\num everywhere today um and\nvirtually and and electronically and\nwe have the ability to just to speak to\nand inspire and move um\npeople wherever they are all the time um\nand and i think today everybody is\nin the media business yes we're only\ntalking about that briefly before\nand we don't need the media to help\namplify and tell our stories because we\ncan\nall find audiences and there are social\nplatforms today we can connect\nwith audiences and effortlessly and\num and we all have the ability to\namplify\nours and each other's stories and we can\nand uh we can\num align and build an even bigger\nplatform and\npeople can get together and we can\nretweet and repost and\nand uh and there's no end to\nhow far you know we we can effectively\num\nuh proceed in that regard yeah and i\nlove that about you and anyone who's\nlistening or watching right now you\nshould definitely\nfollow kenneth on instagram because i\ni find that you're extremely witty it's\nextremely relevant\nit's it's it's beautiful to watch\nbecause i find so many\nexecutive ceos founders don't\nnecessarily manage their own accounts\nand there's like a million layers\nbetween the individual\nand then what actually gets posted\nwhereas with you it's it's\nit's very close it's very authentic it's\nstuff you're thinking about it's things\nthat are\nfresh off your mind and i found that\nrefreshing when we met\nbecause i know that as someone who's\nextremely busy involved in so many\ndifferent things for you to even find\ntime to\npost on instagram but you do and it's\nmeaningful and it's witty it's not just\nputting out a corporate stamp and that's\nwhat i love you've been able to\ndifferentiate\nthe man and the brand as you said yeah\nand that's partially how i was able to\ndo it because we've gone back and forth\nand so the brand tells the business\nstory and i\ntell my story and i i don't take what i\ndo seriously\num i take um the world seriously but i\ndon't take what i do seriously\nand what do you mean by that well i\nthink that\nnobody needs what i sell right so and i\ni don't\nuh i don't present it in a way that's\nany\nthat's any bigger than that um i have to\nmake you want it and want it again and i\nknow that\nand i do think it makes us feel great\nabout ourselves and i do think that\nwardrobing one is an extraordinary\nprivilege and i don't want this to\nbe misinterpreted because i think when\nwe wake up in the morning\nwe have a queen sweat as queen slate we\nhave a\nthe ability to represent ourselves to\nthe world every day\non our own terms unedited because most\nof the people you encounter in a given\nday\ndon't get to know any more about you\nthan how you present yourself and\nso you can send a very powerful message\nto the world\num independently individually every day\nand to be part of that is an\nextraordinary privilege if i can be part\nof that expression that self-expression\nthat you choose to make\nand and i don't take that seriously but\nat the end of the day is like\nyou know you wake up in the morning um\nit's not usually the first thing on your\nmind\num especially if someone in your world\nisn't well\nor if you're hungry and um\nso i need to somehow keep it in context\nso and you know and as i've often said i\ncan't change the world alone but i can\nbe an accessory\ni love that so um and hopefully i'm\nenabled enough\nto do that and empowered to do that yeah\nin your\nin your spirit of always being a learner\nyou told me a beautiful story about how\nyou've been learning even from your\ndaughter\nand and i wanted to just share that with\ncontext of just how\nyou've recognized this ability to learn\nfrom everything and everyone around you\nwhen we met you not only mentor but\nyou're willing to learn from those that\nyou mentor like there's this\nbeautiful reciprocal exchange in your\nlife that exists\nand the spirit the energy you've built\naround yourself of always learning from\neverything around you\nyeah i think i i love the access we're\nall provided\num through social media and just and the\nlikes to\nto be enlightened and inspired by so\nmuch from so many\num i the story that i was telling you\nbefore was when\nthe one i was trying to write this book\ni guess i think it was the first one it\nwas footnotes\num my daughter katie was it was eight at\nthe time so if i figure out\nwhen this was but um i would come home\nfrom work and i'd have to\nedit or these work because i was i was\non a deadline\nand she's asked if i could help her with\nher homework and i'd say\nkatie i need just a few more i need half\nan hour\ni have to work on this project and then\ni'll be there i promise\nand then she'd ask me this question i\nremember vividly and it was\nwho gives you the work which i found\ninteresting because she's at school and\nat school you don't\nhave work unless somebody gives you the\nwork and then she says to me and i said\nwell i give it to myself\nbecause i need to do it and then she\nsays why aren't you the boss\nand it says i am and that's why i give\nit to myself because even if i don't no\none's going to do it.\nso i'm thinking to myself i just you\nknow this opportunity to share an\nimportant lesson with my daughter and\nthen the next day\nthe same time right after dinner\nkatie says to me so can you\nhelp me with this other project and i\nsaid well\ni can't but just like yesterday i need a\nlittle bit of time\nand then i will be there i promise and\nthen so she this time she changed the\nquestion she says aren't you the boss\nand i'm saying to myself i just answered\nthis question then she said and i said\nyes but i have to do it\nand then she says well who gives you the\nwork\nand and this went on for three or four\ndays and then\num i was uh\nand it was the same questions each time\nand and i saw this spiritual advisor of\nmine\nshortly after that and he says to me\nhow is katie and i said you know it's\nfunny because\nyou know we went through this process\nand she asked me to help her and i was\nworking and something i had to get done\nand\nshe says aren't you the boss and who\ngives you the work and\nand then and then after several days she\nkept asking the same questions and i\nsaid to him\nit's amazing she just doesn't get it\nand he said to me or you don't she spent\na week trying to teach you a lesson\nand you clearly still didn't didn't\nlearn it\nand and the lesson is that we're inc\nwe make these choices and i was choosing\nto prioritize them over her\nand it wasn't uh and it was i had the\nability\nto change that and i was choosing not to\nso\nbut we are empowered to to to do\nmost of what we do is we are empowered\nto change it we're empowered to\naffect it and we're very comfortable\nsometimes attributing\nthat to other forces absolutely always\nremoving our own accountability somehow\nand thank you for sharing that i know\nit's a\nit's definitely an open and vulnerable\nshare but it's\nit's so important for us to recognize\nthat that we are accountable we are\nresponsible especially those of us who\nhave created lives where you are working\nfor yourself and i find myself in that\ntrap all the time\nthat i love what i do i'm blessed to do\nwhat i do i feel very fortunate to do it\nthat means i do it all the time because\nit's\nyou feel so fortunate and blessed to be\nable to have that privilege\nyeah and then you do it in a way\nyou know when your your beautiful wife\nworks with you and it's part of what you\ndo at home it's part of what you do\nis your career it's you're emotionally\nvested in it and that you're\nprofessionally committed to it\nand which is why you're so inspiring to\nso many of us\nbecause um um you\noffer us so much um in that process\nyou're very kind no that's beautiful and\ni i wanted to ask you what have you done\nas a\nis there has there been a kenneth call\ndaily ritual\na daily aspect of your life that has\nbeen there\nthroughout or is there a new one does it\nchange every few months a year has there\nbeen something that you've done\nasked yourself practiced on\na regular basis even if it's not daily\nweekly that that you feel has been a\ncornerstone\nfor your success both internally\nexternally when i sit with you\ni feel i'm with someone who's both\ninternally and externally successful\nhowever you\ndefine that word but someone who's\naccomplished on both levels\nso what has been is has there been a\ncornerstone practice\nthat's always been there you know i i\ndon't know how to answer that question i\ni what i've often said to people is that\nthe\nbest part of what i do is that over all\nthose many years\nthere's been no two days i've done the\nsame thing because\nyou know i'm touching so many aspects of\nthe business and i'm touching the\ncustomers so many different ways\num you know i've often said that i um i\nneed to put myself in the customer's\nshoes and hope that they'll put\nthemselves in mine\nbut um but i'm not and\ni'm i don't have a ritual um\ni don't and uh and probably i should the\nmost successful people i know\ntoo and um but i do have a sense of i do\ni do have visualize where i want to be\nand what is the best way to get there\nand i am and a an\nexample that i i've often been using\nthese days is if we all agree that we\nwant to be in\ncalifornia by sunday then let's also\nknow we have to be in st it was by\nwednesday\nyes and denver by thursday yes um not\nchicago not\nnot florida and not texas so\nand i always kind of check myself and am\ni on a path it kind of takes me somewhat\nin the direction i want to go\ni love that and i think you do i think\nyou have them whether they're\nconscious or subconscious your ability\nto question your\ncomfort with change like to even say\nthat you don't do the same thing every\nday\nmost people think that they aspire for\nthat but most people don't really want\nthat because that's not easy to be able\nto\ndeal with new situations new scenarios\non a daily basis\nat work i i say to my associates often\nare we going to do what we're going to\ndo on monday\njust because that's what we did last\nmonday yeah because\nnext monday is a different world than it\nwas last monday so there you go\nand and just make sure your ass we're\ntaking you know we're taking our pulse\nand we're taking that to consideration\nand if it is the same then so be it but\nyeah i love it is there anything we\nhaven't covered\nanything in your mind that you wanted to\nshare maybe i i don't know if you wanted\nto talk about you n and sundance\nso on your involvement more specifically\nso um\ni accepted a u.n appointment uh about a\nyear ago\num because they had just put forth a\ndeclaration to end aids by\n2030. and but i did it conditionally and\nthat is that\nthey agree that to aid to accept\ncure as a component because if we don't\nhave a cure by 2020\nwe're close to that you're not going to\nend days by 2030. and that was the kind\nof the amp\nagenda so i was trying to marry my\nagendas so i could then\naccept um you know that generous\ngesture that was put forth um and\nso um so then\nand then how do we bring other resources\nand how do we all how do we get the\ncommunity aligned\non and with a clear sense of\ndeliverables and focused on\non very real um precise outcomes and\nhow do we articulate what st louis looks\nlike\nand um and how do we know when we're in\nl.a so\nbut so i accepted that and that's and so\nand i\ntry to marry that to what i to my\nprofessional agenda\nand uh uh i'm on my way to mexico soon\nand\nfor business because we're launching the\nbrand and i'm gonna wear my un hat for\ntwo days and\nand then there's also um i'm also on the\nboard of sundance which is a\nextraordinary um initiative that i\naccepted and then i i totally totally\nenjoy\num about 10 15 years ago so\nand that's all about effective story\nindependent storytelling and that's what\nthat's what sundance does started by\nrobert redford so\nand i've you know it has motivated and\ninspired me in many ways because\nyou know that today the world is about\neffective storytelling\num independent storytelling and how do\nwe do it with the means we have\nthe resources we have to work with and\num\nso i i marry that as well um\nto what i do and um there was\none initiative actually i wanted to tell\nyou yeah please\nyeah of course there was another so we\nlaunched\namphar we launched the aids campaign in\n85 i joined board in 87\nabout a year or two later um i had a\nbusiness dilemma\nthat there was we needed to be able to\nsell shoes in our stores without\nselling them off price and we came up\nwith this great strategy\nwhich this great plan and and that was\nto do a campaign\nto encourage people to give people a\ndiscount off of the shoes based upon\nthem doing something\nsocially important and meaningful and i\nlooked around\nand there was a a an\nunsettling amount of homelessness\nthat was overwhelming new york city at\nabout that time\nand first of all people think\nhomelessness is embedded in our\nin our economy and in our infrastructure\nit's not and\nhomelessness to a very large degree\ndidn't exist in this country until the\num reagan bush years when the social\nsafety net was withdrawn\nand but now you had this population that\nwas growing\nand it was overwhelming many of us in\nthese urban\num cities centers um\nso uh politicians didn't want to address\nthem because they didn't vote\nusually and businesses didn't address\nthem because they didn't consume\nso we did a campaign which said bring in\na pair of shoes you don't wear for\nsomeone that\nwill with a picture of a homeless person\nand we'll give you a 20\ndiscount on a new pair so we've said now\nto people\num we motivated them to do\nwhat was in their heart they would feel\ngood about doing\nat a time when they would not ordinarily\ndo it and it was the month of february\nwhen our stores now were\nhad all summer product and it was still\n10 degrees outside\nbecause the weather hadn't changed even\nthough we had changed\nour inventories so um and we started\nwhat became known as the shoe drive and\nlater on\nthere were coat drives and there were\nclothing drives none of that had existed\nat the time\nwow and over the years we collected\nseveral million parachutes\nand then we'd find populations my wife\nwas running a homeless organization in\nnew york\nand she kind of always kind of\nencouraged and inspired me\nand still does called help usa which was\noriginally founded by new york's\ngovernor and my brother-in-law andrew\ncuomo\nso we would collect these shoes we'd\ngive them to home and help um\nresidents and and then we find out other\nresidents\nother individuals that could benefit\nfrom um\nfrom the product from these shoes and\nthen it became over time\nit was from a couple days in february to\nthe entire\nto a week or then two weeks and it\nwasn't just new york it was all of our\nstores around the country\nand it wasn't just shoes and it was\nclothes and accessories\nso we collected several million pair of\nshoes over a period of time\nthen all of a sudden haiti earthquake\ncomes\nand everybody is emotionally overcome\nand destroyed and agonized how can\npeople\nso close to us um be\nso devastated and how in fact we come to\nrealize\nhad they been so devastated even before\nthe earthquake living in such\num such uh poverty and\num and be so undeserved and uh in such\nneed\nso um we changed the\ninitiative immediately to a campaign\nto to correct shoes and also funds\nfor people affected by the earthquake in\nhaiti we ended up raising\na little bit maybe a hundred and\nsomething thousand dollars which is a\nlot but not\nin that world and i mean you're talking\nabout\nyou know a couple million people and we\nthen i took a bunch of associates and we\nwent to haiti\nwe figured out how can we somehow\nmake as meaningful a commit a meaningful\nimpact as we can with the limited\nresources that were available to us to\ndo it\nand then we ended up needing to take a\ncouple of trips because we couldn't\nfigure it out and eventually\nwe invested in a health care center with\norganizational st luke's in um cd soleil\nwhich is\nthe most overwhelmed and underserved\nuh and poorest population arguably in\nthe northern hemisphere\nand um and to this day it exists and to\nthis day we\nevery year we we raise\nfunds to um bring medical equipment or\nother things\nto that facility and it's this other\ndimension to what we do it's we solved\nthe business problem\nbut in a way we created a um\na uh an opportunity to engage\nin a community in such a meaningful way\nand\nassociates come with us we didn't go\nthis past year but we have to we've gone\nevery other year and um\nand it's uh i find that maybe the\ngreatest gift i've had after 35 years\nis i've been able to use i've been able\nto do what i love\num as a platform for which to do\nsomething that is\nadds so much more meaning to what i love\nand uh\nand we the those opportunities continue\nto\ngrow not and get bigger and more\nmeaningful now less so\nthat's why i love you your commitment to\nservice and your commitment to impact\nis absolutely incredible i've got my\nfive quickfire questions with you\nto to finish off with the so here we go\nthese are these are quick answers so you\ncan give me\none word one line one sentence if you\ncould walk a mile in anyone's shoes who\nwould it be\noh man there's so many people who've\ninspired me along the way but\ni will say nelson mandela okay amazing\nuh your favorite guest that you could\nhave over for dinner\ni know there's a lot of people that you\nprobably already had over assuming that\nassuming that that nelson is busy yes\nyes assuming nelson is busy\num i may be mined with the king\nokay amazing biggest lesson you've\nlearned in the last 35 years\nthat what i do is not who i am\nwhat that's a little more yeah\nanswer than the first two i was thinking\nthat is something i often\ntry to share with people because i think\nwe often are blindsided by\nby what we do as in the bigger context\nit's not\nfavorite city in the world in new york\nand your best piece of advice you've\never been given\num\n[Music]\nis organic or\nwhat is the impact you want to make\nand apply it to everything you can\num as often as you can i love it\nthank you so much kenneth i'm
