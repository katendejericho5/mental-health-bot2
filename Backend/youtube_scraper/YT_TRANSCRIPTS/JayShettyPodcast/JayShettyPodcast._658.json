it\nwith the conscious mind you feel it in\nthe heart you feel it in the body and\nthe soul but the mind\nis clueless\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast

leaders thinkers\nteachers and guides\nthat can help us all elevate our minds\nbodies hearts and souls and today\ni'm joined by the one and only martha\nbeck she's a harvard trained sociologist\nworld-renowned coach and new york times\nbest-selling author\nshe's written nine books and a novel and\nher latest book\nthe way of integrity will be out this\nspring martha is also a life coach and\ncontributor to the oh magazine\nher work and multifaceted career has\namazed me for years\nand i'm so excited to talk to her today\nabout\nintegrity befriending suffering paths\ntaking new ones\nand changing parts of our life martha\nit's truly an\nhonor and privilege to be with you today\nand i'm so glad that we're getting to\ndiscuss\nuh your amazing new book the way of\nintegrity\nfinding the path to your true self uh\nsuch an important topic such an\nimportant book at this time\nthank you for doing this podcast oh my\ngoodness the honor is\nall mine jay i'm a big fan\nwell i i really do look forward to\nmeeting you in person i i feel your\nenergy\nthrough the screen already and through\nyour voice\nand i wanted to start actually with a\nquote i saw from one of your other books\nrecently\nand it's from your book called steering\nuh\nby starlight and here's the quote the\nvariety of an\nordinary life is infinite\nand precious and i read that\nand and it really struck me because i\nfeel that\na lot of what i read today is always\nchallenging me\nto be extraordinary or a lot of what i\ncome across or what we see\non social media and instagram is asking\npeople to think\nbig and vast and when i looked at this\nquote\ni'm not saying that it's opposite to any\nof those ideas i just wanted to\nunderstand from you\nuh what you mean by an ordinary life\nand and why is that such a infinite and\nprecious thing and\nwhy is that quote so powerful so let's\nstart there the idea is that\ndefinitely culturally we are\nurged to seek the extremes and what is\ncalled happiness\nparticularly in american culture but i\nwould say culture around the world now\nis actually mania and the points that\nare supposed to be our happiest times\nare\npoints where actually when i work with\nclients they're actually feeling\nsuper stressed in my latest book i talk\nabout this guy who made 400 million\ndollars in one day\nwhen his company went public and he\ncalled me at three in the morning\ncompletely stoned this rock band you\nknow famous rock band in the background\nand he was screaming into the phone it\nisn't enough when's it gonna be enough\nand i was like dude all you really like\nis hiking maybe go for a hike sometime\nso that idea that everything's supposed\nto be super spectacular works against us\nand the opposite of that not really the\nopposite the alternative\nis peace and i have coached everybody\nfrom\npeople in prison murderers billionaires\nsuccessful celebrities homeless people\nevery single one of them resonates to\nthe\nto the idea i am meant to live in peace\nthat is the one thing that feels true to\nevery single person\nthat i've ever coached and peace is\nboring to the mania mind or as you would\ncall the monkey mind\ninstead of the monk mind yeah so the\nmonk mind\ngoes for peace yeah so\npeace is flat and dull to the mania mind\nand to the culture but when you go there\nwhen you meditate every day you sit you\nknow i\nspent several years out living in a\nforest and i would go out and meditate\nevery day\nand birds would land on me for example\nwell i guess that's not completely\nordinary but i did sprinkle myself\nwith bird seed i have to confess when\nthat happened\ni remember the first time a bird landed\non my knee while i was meditating this\nlittle bird and he looked up at my eyes\nand the love i felt between the two of\nus just\nexploded my universe it was the most\nincredible thing a little gray bird\nnothing special about it\nand that started to that feeling started\nto come into everything\na sip of tea i mean there was a lemon\ntree i'd pick a lemon and my heart would\nexplode with the experience of it\nbecause the mania mind was finally quiet\nand once you get to peace or\nordinariness\nyou find that it is vast and\nmuch more interesting than this the\nheights which are weirdly\ndull when they if you repeat them too\nmany times they get very dull\nwow yeah i mean so much to unpack there\nand and so much to look at\nbecause i find that before i was\nworking with people\nlike the ones that you were mentioning\nso for a lot long part of my life i\nworked with\nhomeless communities and charity\nprojects and individuals and\nuh young people uh whether they were in\nyou know coming out of uh gang violence\nor college issues or\nor early drug use or whatever it may\nhave been and then when you do work with\nsomeone who's\nwealthy and successful and they have\nthat moment that you just\nexplained of 400 million in in one day\nfrom exiting their company and you know\nhaving this moment and it not being\nenough\na lot of people will stop and say well\nthat's\neasy for them to say because they\nalready have it but explain to me\nthat that that interesting thing that's\nhappening\nand and in your in your book that we're\ntalking about the way of integrity\nyou talk about the desperation for\nsuccess\nand i thought that word is so true\nthere's this desperation\nfor success that exists within all of us\nwhether we are successful or not\nsuccessful or on the road\nwhy is it that desperation so damaging\nand destructive for us\nwell what this whole book is about it's\ncalled the way of integrity and\nintegrity\ndoesn't mean what most people think it\ndoes at least not here\nit comes from the word integer which\nmeans one thing and being in integrity\nis being\nwhole and undivided so there's no part\nof you that's divided from your true\nself\nso when people get when they're\nsocialized\nto do something like seek a certain type\nof success\nif that's not according to your true\nnature\nand your culture pulls you toward it you\nleave your nature to serve your culture\nand what that does is it splits you into\nso you're no longer in integrity you're\nin duplicity\nbut you don't actually even know it with\nthe conscious mind you\nfeel it in the heart you feel it in the\nbody and the soul but the mind\nis clueless because it's a cultural tool\nthat's why i love the saying that the\nmind is a wonderful servant but a\nterrible master\nso when we go to serve our cultural\nideas of what joy is\nwe leave our true nature and\nalways but always that causes suffering\nwhich is a huge gift because suffering\nis the only thing that will get our\nattention enough to say wait i need to\nchange my life\nso if it weren't suffering we would not\npay attention to it and we would never\nfind\nthe path of our right self our true self\nour one\nindividual path that no one else can\never have\num so yeah being in a hole in integrity\noften means turning off cultural noises\nand tuning back into\none's own true nature i love that\ndistinction you make between nature and\nculture and how our culture can pull us\naway from nature that's\nthat's so beautifully said how do we\nfind\na culture that reflects our nature\nbecause i find that that's probably one\nof the most difficult things that we all\nwant to be\nin a culture i guess that's natural to\nwant to be around others that\nencourage us to become more of our true\nselves and i've definitely\nfound that in my own spiritual tradition\nthat i follow and\nand the work that i've done but i also\nfound that even sometimes that culture\nwas taking me away from my true self as\nwell\nand so how do we start to create the\ncommunity and culture to suit our nature\nyou begin by asking how do we find the\nculture that matches our nature\nnow i'm not meaning culture in the sense\nof you know british culture versus\namerican culture i mean\nanytime there are two people in a room\nculture is the third guest at the table\nright every couple has a culture every\nfamily has a culture\nethnicity whatever there is no culture\nthat is exactly aligned with your true\nnature\nit just can't happen but as you said\nwe're social primates so we have this\nbiological desperation to be in culture\nconnected to other creatures like\nourselves\nin every single case there will come a\nmoment when you leave your nature\nto serve that culture and it may just be\na little bit which is fine\nbut as you said like you left the city\nculture in london\nwasn't serving your spiritual self went\nto become a monk\nclearly that didn't totally serve your\nwhole self either agreed\nagreed and what you are doing is not\nfinding a culture but\nleading a culture so\nyou come out of those two experiences\nand you say i will\ncreate something that is true to myself\nand i love your story and think like a\nmonk about giving your first\npresentation to an empty room\non a college campus and just nobody\nshowed up and you still gave the\npresentation\nthat's what you did you were purely in\nyour true nature\nand you didn't care if culture came to\nbe with you at the table or not you\ndidn't care if there was anyone else in\nthe room you're going to serve your\nnature\nand initially nobody came but truth\nintegrity is the sweetest thing that a\nhuman being can find\nit's the most precious energy it\nis peace and so as you stayed in that\nenergy\nyou didn't make other people like you\nyou showed by being yourself how other\npeople could be themselves\nso you create a culture in which the\nonly\nironclad rule is we all support each\nother in our uniqueness\nand that's new that i think is a new\ncultural form\nthat if it get hits a critical mass in\nour\npopulation today a global population\ncould actually save the ecosystems\nstop war stop ethnic violence\nit's a new phenomenon and in sociology\nand your life is an example of how it\nhappens\nand i hope mine is too no i'm i mean\nyours definitely is thank you that's\nvery kind of you i'm touched by your uh\nwonderful encouragement it means the\nworld to me hearing that from you and uh\nit's it it's definitely\nfun living it and figuring it out and\nand i think i've i've had moments in my\nlife where you rightly said where i was\ntrying to make something\nme and it wasn't me and then i was\ntrying to become\nsomething that i wasn't and that wasn't\nme right and then eventually you kind of\nsettle and let go and go\nall right let me just be myself because\nbecause that's where i feel most peace\nas as you rightly said tell me about how\ni want to go into a few concepts that i\nlove from the book but\ntell me about how someone can know right\nnow if they're listening\nif someone's listening or watching us\nright now and they're thinking martha\nthis\nis really resonating with me this is\nreally connecting with me\nhow does someone know whether they're in\nintegrity\nor or feeling unaligned and out of\nintegrity\nright out of balance in their life how\ndoes someone know because i feel that\nthat\ndiagnosis is almost the trickiest thing\nto do because you don't just go to a\ndoctor and get a scan\nit's something you have to do for\nyourself i'm guessing or working with a\ncoach of course\nuh but please please walk me through\nthat and walk us through that how can\nsomeone know whether\nthey feel they're aligned or not yeah\nthe first thing\nis uh that you have to notice if there's\nany degree of discomfort whatsoever\nemotional psychological physical um\none of the things i do when i speak in\npublic there would be people in the\naudience\nand i'd stop right in the middle of a\nspeech and say is everyone comfortable\nand they'd be like well yes of course\nand i'd say no seriously are you really\ncomfortable\nand they would say yes go on with your\nspeech and then i'd say\nif you were at home in your bedroom with\nno one else there how many of you would\nbe sitting in the position you're in\nright now\nand no one raises a hand and then i\nwould say why\nand it would take them like five minutes\nto kind of go oh\nit's not that comfortable and the\nproblem is not that they were\nuncomfortable because people can survive\na lot\nthe problem is that they their bodies\nknew they were uncomfortable and their\nminds did not they looked me dead in the\neyes\nin clear daylight and lied and did not\nknow it that's duplicity the culture\nsays\nto learn you sit in chairs like this and\nand it goes through a filter\nare you comfortable given that i am\nforced to sit in this really\nuncomfortable chair in a fairly\nuncomfortable position\nthis is tolerable but the way the brain\nthinks of it is\nthis is comfortable so the way i get to\nsomeone's integrity is what i call a\nsense of truth and you\nuse the word alignment which is really\nimportant a lot of\ntraditional cultures divide the self\ninto body mind heart and soul\nso you start with the body make sure the\nbody is the body comfortable\nand relaxed because whenever we tell the\ntruth i don't know if you know this\neverything in our bodies strengthens\nwhenever we lie\neverything gets weaker our muscles get\nweaker we blink more rapidly our\nheartbeats go up we perspire more\num if you want to weaken someone have\nthem lie they\nliterally become physically weak um\nso once you're telling your own truth\nthe body becomes relaxed and strong\nthen the heart are you emotionally okay\nand that\nyou could be sad or happy but there\nshould be an undertone of\npeace peace peace you can be happy\nin peace and you can be sad in peace\nthe peace is separate and then there's\nthe soul\nand the way the soul knows truth is does\nit\nfree me or does it liberate me like the\nbuddha used to say everywhere you know\na body of water is the ocean because the\nocean tastes of salt\nand you know enlightenment no matter\nwhat form it takes because enlightenment\ntastes of freedom\nso the soul feels freedom even if\nthere's terrible fear terrible pain\nwhatever\nthat freedom comes with the truth the\nlast one to the party is always the mind\nthe mind we worship is like what what go\nback i didn't get that\nbecause it's drowning in culture right\nbut\nwhen you get the mind to say oh\nthis makes no sense to my culture but my\nbody is relaxed my heart is filled with\nwarm and warmth and peace\nmy soul feels free okay let me check the\nfacts because they're probably going to\nsay this is true\nand once they're all aligned you have\nwhat i call the sense of truth which is\nlike a\nclick or a chime or a ring we actually\nuse\nwords for that that feeling of\neverything it's like a puzzle piece\ngoing click\nin the perfect place and that sensation\nis integrity beautiful deep definition\nof integrity i've\ndefinitely never heard integrity\nexplained that way and\ni i hope that's resonated with everyone\nlistening my favorite thing that you\nmentioned was around how\ntelling the truth strengthens our body\nand and telling a lie\nweakens our body and i think you're so\nright that you can you can feel that and\nyou can see that and those physical cues\nthat you mentioned and even on a deeper\nlevel but\ntell us a bit more about uh there's this\nconcept\nof mount delectable that you have uh\nfrom dante's divine comedy in the book\ni i want you to explain that how it\nrelates to integrity\num because because that was something\nthat when i was reading it i thought oh\nthis is really going to resonate with\nthe with the audience so i i really want\nyou to share that with them\nbecause everybody's a huge dante fan yes\nexactly\nexactly i have been using dante's divine\ncomedy as my own private self-help book\nmy entire life\nand the whole book is standing on the\nshoulders of this giant\nof um enlightenment really i think dante\nhad an enlightenment experience similar\nto the enlightenment experience of the\nasian masters\ni think it's a biological thing that\nhappens to people\nthat's a totally different story it's at\nthe end of the book but at the beginning\nof the book if you've ever read the\ndivine comedy it starts out\nwith him saying in the middle of my life\ni came to myself\nin a dark wood and the true way had been\nlost so he's in this forest\nit's foggy it's dark it's like it's\nswampy there are wild animals and he's\nconfused he doesn't know what he's doing\nand i think a lot of people sort of snap\ninto consciousness at some point in\ntheir life when they've wandered from\nthe true path\nand they're miserable and they don't\nknow why it's very foggy and swampy but\nit's just not right\nand he looks around and he sees this\nmountain rising\nout of the merc and he calls it mount\ndelectable\nyeah dilitosa monte i think is what it\nis i don't even speak italian\nbut it translates to mount delectable\nand he sees all these people climbing it\nand and the sun is coming up and the\nmountain looks all\ngolden and glowy and so he's like that's\nhow i get out of here that's how\ni get happy so he starts climbing\nbecause\nthis is what culture does it gives us\nthose manic high points and bathes them\nin a golden glow and says if you get up\nhere you'll be happy\nbut as he goes ferocious beasts keep\npushing him back down the mountain and\nthe ferocious beasts all have an\nemotional quality so there's a wolf\nthat makes him super sad there's a\nleopard\nthat just makes him desperate that word\nagain\num and there's what's the one that makes\nhim um there's a lion\nthat is so frightening that the air is\nafraid of it\nso what happens to us when we start\nclimbing the cultural\nyou know the pyramid is that our\nemotions\nsay no no and we get scared we get\nanxious we get depressed\nwe don't know why and it drives dante\nback down the mountain and there he\nmeets a guide who says\nfor you for everybody the only way\nout is through we have to go not up but\ndown\nwe're going into he calls it among the\nlost\npeople but i read it as the lost aspects\nof dante himself\nand of each of us part of us have a we\nhave a lost\nself and to get to it we have to go into\nthe inferno\nnot what one typically wants to do\nbut it's the only way to paradise\nyeah i i love that analogy and how it\nlinks to integrity because\nto me i i've always described it as the\nmountain and the valley\nand and and the idea that there's\nthere's\nuh we've always felt that our journey\nhas to be\nforwards and upwards but actually i\nthink the journey is deeper and inwards\nand and we've always felt that the\nskills that get us to the top\nactually it's the opposite skills that\nlet us go down the valley\nwhen i was 18 and very very depressed\nit's the first time i read the divine\ncomedy and i\ndidn't care about the literature i just\nwanted help and what helped me so much\nwas that he goes down through the\ninferno he gets\nthings get worse and worse and worse and\nworse and they get to the very bottom\nhere and his guide gets the very\npit of hell which is the center of the\nearth and\nthe monster lucifer is there trapped in\na lake of ice\nand dante just says well i guess we're\nthis is us now and virgil his guide says\nno no no keep going\nthe same direction he's like there's no\nmore direction to go and virgil's like\nno you have to climb on the body of the\nmonster like he has to face his\nworst fear so he's lowering himself down\nand when he gets to the center of the\nearth\nsuddenly everything switches and he's\ngoing away from the center of the earth\nwhich is up\nhe's going in the same direction but\ninstead of going into hell he's now\nheaded\nto heaven and that was what got me\nthrough my depression when i was 18.\nthat image\nwell tell us tell us a bit more about\nthat i think there are a lot of\nyoung people today and people across any\nage and generation\nstruggling with depression struggling\nwith anxiety struggling with tr\nstress and and mental health challenges\nwhat was it for you that was so\nkey at that time in your life that made\nyou feel depressed\nand then what was it that started to be\nthe cure for that journey\nyeah the problem was that um i was\nraised in a culture that didn't fit my\ntrue nature at\nall i was raised in the most mormon of\nmormon places you can imagine\na very very mormon family and it just\ndidn't really work for me but i tried to\nmake it work for a very long time\nwell 18 years now i kept trying after a\nwhile\ni grew up also but i was really drying\nup to that time and it just wasn't\nworking for me\nat 17 i went off to harvard which is\nabout\nas different from mormon central as you\ncan get without going to pluto so\nnow i was in this complete sort of\natheist materialist culture\nand my only really strong imperative as\na personality is\njust please everyone right so\ni sort of adapted to my culture at\nharvard and just sort of fit in there\nand then i would go back to utah and try\nto fit in there\nand these two selves were so different\nthat i i lost my sense of what was true\nso i just got\nincredibly depressed like constant\nweeping\ncouldn't function at all almost\ncatatonic at a certain point and i\nthought\ni've got to figure out what's wrong with\nme and\ni just started turning inward i went\nstraight into the pain\ni went into my inferno and i went down\nand down and down\nuntil i found the thing that was the\nmost painful thing to me and that\nthought it was the thought i don't know\nwhat's true\nbecause i was so split and anybody who's\nbeen pulled different ways by\ndifferent loved ones different jobs\ndifferent um national cultures or\nwhatever\nif you feel that lostness that's the\ndark\nwood that dante woke up in i am so lost\nand i don't know\nwhy and i didn't know what the answer\nwould be but i knew that the\nthe pathway was into my own suffering\nand it worked it took a while but it\nworked\nit sounds like that's a it's a scary\njourney or a journey that requires one\nto\nbe okay with as you say in the book you\nknow going into the inferno\nand embracing that fear\nhow can people today feel more\ncomfortable with discomfort feel because\nit's strange we're talking about\ngetting back to our nature but it almost\ntakes discomfort and fear and\npain to get back to that which seems\nnatural\nso it's or explain that journey to me a\nbit because i'm just trying to\ni'm thinking about everyone who's\nlistening and thinking i don't want to\naccept\nthat i'm not living in my truth because\nthat's scary that means i might have to\nquit my job\nit might mean i have to break up with my\npartner\nit might mean that i have to move across\ncountry like it means\na lot of real things and you work with\nreal people all the time so i know that\nyou're you're greatly placed to help\npeople but that's what i'm trying to\nunderstand is\nis what does someone do and they're like\nwell i can't accept the truth because\nthe truth\nwill ruin my life we are all terrified\nof the truths\nthat will take us away from the culture\nwe belong to the culture that makes us\nfeel grounded in the world\nif there's a truth that we've hidden\nbecause it doesn't work with that\nculture\nwe are terrified so where does\nvirgil take dante in the dark wood of\neric he takes him to a gate and he says\nhere's where we're going in and it says\nabove the gate abandon all hope ye\nwho enter here and dante's like i don't\nthink that's a good sign\nliterally and bronzer just pats them on\ntheir hands and trust me and they go in\nand it's horrible so what i like to do\nwith clients and what i do in the book\nis\nfine if you're not completely happy in\nyour life and i mean completely happy\ni think we should be completely happy so\nfind a thing you're frightened to think\nabout and you don't need to think about\nit\nyet just identify it like okay\nthere's something about my job and i'm\nscared to think of it\nthere's something about my spouse and\ni'm scared to think about i don't want\nto think about it\ndon't want to think about it don't want\nto think about it the irony is that the\nfear is only there because we already\nknow\nwhat's inside there what's inside as you\nsaid\nwhat's on the other side of that may\nmean a divorce it may mean\nchanging a career it may mean giving up\nscotch you know and we don't want to\nwe're as comfortable as we can be you\nknow clinging to our little dark wood of\nair things\nbut if we want to be free the suffering\ngets stronger and stronger and stronger\nand typically there are things that like\nin dante's case a guide shows up in our\ncase it might be a book it might be a\nteacher it might be a podcast like yours\nbut something says walk up to that gate\njust walk up to it and for me the\nscariest\nthing was when i was 25 and i was now\ngetting my doctorates with my third\nharvard degree and i got pregnant for\nthe second time i was married\nand my son was prenatally diagnosed with\ndown syndrome\nthe fear was like nothing\ni have ever experienced and i just\nwalked around harvard and i looked at\nthese\ni looked at the professors i looked at\nthe students and they all looked really\npinched and anxious and\ni thought jesus my third i kept thinking\nif i get another harvard degree i shall\nbe happy\nand it never worked i was getting more\nand more tense\nand then i thought okay\nis it possible for a person with down\nsyndrome to be happy\nand everything i knew said yes so i\nthought\nokay emerson said beauty is its own\nexcuse for being\njoy is the felt equivalent\nof beauty maybe joy is its own excuse\nfor being and if that's the case\nthen anyone who can feel joy belongs\nhere as much as\nanybody else in the world the fear i\nwent through for the next several months\nas i waited and they said there was a 40\nchance he would die at birth and all\nthese things would ruin my older\ndaughter's life he would ruin my\nmarriage everything\num i've never experienced fear like that\nand it finally pushed me to a point\nwhere i broke\ni went into the i went through the door\nand i let\nmyself feel all the fear\nand it was just this it was exactly the\nway dante describes going to hell just\nscreams and\nnoise and you know wailing of it like\nall silent of course in my own head\nand then in the middle of that whole\ncacophony\ni heard this one whisper that said\nare you sure are you sure\nare you sure that's true and i was like\ni don't know what's true\nand it said you may want to think about\nwhat's true\nand that was the first moment that the\nfear let go of me\nand i was like i was in the inferno\nafter that\nso yeah life will take you there well\nthank you so much for sharing that with\nus\nthat it's um it's a very\nthat's a very real uh result of going\ninto the fear and i liked what you said\nthere where\nyou just allowed yourself to feel it and\nthen ask whether it was true and and the\npart that really struck from\nme from that story was the idea of when\nyou were saying that\ni asked if he still had a chance to be\nhappy and the answer was yes\nand and i thought wow like that's it's\nit's again\nagain it comes back to the same point of\ndisconnecting from the culture\nyes because the culture makes you\nbelieve i i remember i mean\nnot in any comparison at all and it's\nnot similar\nuh but just to share it like i remember\nwhen i uh\nwhen i when i left the monastery people\nalways told me that i wouldn't be as\nclose to my teachers anymore and they\nsaid well you know\nif you move on you know you're going to\nget lost in the material world and\nadmire as it's called illusion and you\nwon't you won't\nbe able to maintain this and and i\nremember saying to myself i was like\ni'll never look you know i don't want to\nlet go and this was so important to me\nbecause\ni'd found my soul teachers and i want to\nspeak with you about that\naround soul teachers and it was really\nfunny because\nconstantly in different stages of my\nlife\npeople have said things to me and that's\nculture is saying something to me\nand actually culture saying it to me has\nbeen a beautiful reminder\nfor me to not make that my reality right\nso instead of feeling bitterness towards\nculture i feel this like gratitude\ntowards culture because\nevery time they say to me they're like\njay you know when you get married you'll\nhave less time for spiritual things i\nwas told that when i got married\nand and i was like oh okay that's a\nreminder to me to not do less spiritual\nthings so i'll make sure that i'm\nmore grounded in my spiritual practice\nuh people said oh jay when you build a\nbusiness like this will happen when you\nbecome an entrepreneur this will happen\nand that was always a good reminder of\nwhat i didn't want to let happen\nright and that was such a beautiful way\nof responding to it but you talk about\nmeeting\nsoul teachers and when you were sharing\nearlier\ni do feel it's beautiful to find\nteachers in podcasts and books but i do\nfeel and i was lucky growing up in a\ntradition where mentorship\nwas encouraged and highly it was part of\nthe culture\nand it was a good part of the culture so\ni really strongly believe in coaching\ntell me about\nhow someone finds their soul teacher\nknows it's their soul teachers you talk\nabout in the book\nand give us some of those insights from\na few of these chapters so that\npeople who are listening can start\nthinking about that because i think\nagain culture hasn't made coaching\nor mentorship normal and\nnot not at all and so we kind of feel\nlike we're just figuring it out\nand and it's many years after which\npeople are even okay\naccepting a teacher they feel that to be\nan alien concept to accept a teacher and\nas an adult\nexplain to us why it's i i feel like\nhaving a human coach is there's nothing\nbetter than that like you\nit needs to be beyond the book beyond\nthe\nthe podcast in the book are the starting\npoint but there's another level as well\nyeah and what i found is that when you\nso if you if you walk up to to the gate\nof your fear and you surrender to the\nfact that you're afraid and you just ask\nor set an\nintention i would really like some help\nhere please\na teacher is always sent and but it has\nto be asked for from a place of peace\nthis is what i\nwanted to talk about with the question\nabout desperation\nwe tend to only ask for help when we're\ndesperate in this culture\nyes western materialist culture which is\nvery\nlinear and it doesn't accept having to\ngo through\ncycles of change and meeting teachers at\neach cycle and all of that\nwhich is what i teach coaches to do get\npeople through those cycles\nbut when we're desperate for it um\nthis is what i believe i believe that\nevery time you pray or desperately ask\nthe universe for anything it is\nimmediately sent to you the answer is\nalways yes\nand the response is always immediate but\nit always gets\nsent to your true home address which is\npeace\nif it were to send what you want to\ndesperation\nthat would make you move into\ndesperation and just sit there gathering\nup\nyour stuff but in instead if you can be\nat peace so you walk right up to your\nfear find a moment of peace and it\ndoesn't have to be a day it doesn't have\nto be an hour\nit doesn't even have to be a minute it\nhas to be a moment of peace when you say\ni need help please send teachers\nand sometimes for me they first came in\nbooks because that's how i allowed it\nnisargadatta maharaja is my favorite one\nof my favorite soul teachers\nand let me tell you when i saw his book\nin a cabin in\nsouth africa i stole it\ni was like i can't stop reading this i\nneed it\nso i mailed them another copy later when\ni got home but i'm like i can't\ni can't leave this book behind and\nsometimes like my son\nwith down syndrome adam he was the\nteacher who came for me\nturned out to absolutely transform my\nlife and bring me\nso much the the uh the first best seller\ni wrote was a book about how he came\ninto my life and the magic he brought\nwith him\nlet me tell you one of my little adam\nstories once i was listening to\na recording of the different planets\nmade by the voyager spacecraft as it\nwent past it would take radio signals\nfrom the planets and\ntransform them into sound and they sound\nreally weird like the earth is like wow\nwow\nand part like some of the moons of\njupiter go\nso my son was walking past his i was\nplaying these\nhe was like 20. um and he doesn't talk\nvery well\nand he came into the room he said wait\nwhat are those sounds\ni have those sounds in my body and i\nsaid you do\nand he said yeah where are you getting\nthem and i said\nthey're from the planets and he was like\noh right and i was like\nwhy do you he said it's it's a call it's\na message\nand he put his hand up to his head like\na telephone receiver and i said\nthe planets are sending us a message\nthat's in our bodies and he said yes\nand i said well what is the message and\nhe said that we're\nsafe and then he just walked away and\nevery now and then he'll just pull one\nof those out\nand so he was my teacher and once i\nrealized\nthat i could be taught by a newborn with\ndown syndrome\ni was looking for teachers everywhere\nand\nas long as i stay in peace they pour\ninto my life\nyou poured into my life\nand i'm so glad to be talking to you but\nthrough your books and i guess you do\ni i mean every communication you have\nwith your soul teacher feels like this\nyou feel that ring of truth this person\nthis book and then weirdly like\ni i love jill balti taylor the the\nharvard neuroanatomist who had the\nstroke\nhave you have you talked to her ever i\nhaven't no i haven't\nshe's awesome but she lost the left side\nof her brain and had to build\nit back and the right side of the brain\nis in the presence of god at all times\nso she came back\nvery different and i've been quoting her\nstuff and learning from her reading her\nbooks\nand the day before yesterday she just\ncalled me\nshe just zoom called me and i was like\nokay why are you calling me and she's\nlike\ni don't know i just wanted to talk to\nyou like are you serious\nand she told me all this stuff about\nneuroanatomy that helped me understand\nmyself\nand that's what happens when you just\nsay i'm i'm gonna stay in peace and ask\nfor teachers\nokay you you just blew my mind uh with\nall of that\nand and how you so clearly\nmade the proposal to us all\nthat we can only receive our true\nteachers and our soul teachers when\nwe're at peace\nand actually if we ask for them out of\nuh\ndesperation and they'll go to that home\naddress right it'll shift\nus that blew my mind because\nthat made so much sense more than\nintentions it made more so much more\nsense than\nseeking the right people out like that\nidea of\nwhat place what space from which\nare we asking for what we're asking for\nand you're absolutely right that we only\never ask for help when things go wrong\nwe never ask for help when things go\nright\nand also haven't you often found that a\nlot of our asking\nis a demand and not a sincere request\nlike it's a demand of like why is this\nnot happening to me or\ni need this right now yeah and it's the\nantithesis of\npeace as as you're saying is where we\nneed to be it's it's the\nanger it's the pain it's not asking from\na place\nof a sincere request uh you know which\nis\noften what's needed even to get your\nfriend turn around but you know what\nhere is how miraculous and benevolent\nthe universe actually\nis when you go to peace\nthe things you screamed for in your\ntantrums if they're right for you\nwill be there or they will come there\nlike every childhood wish\nthat i'd ever had when i started i i did\na sort of monastic\nperiod of my life when i was 50 i just\nmoved out to the woods\nand spent six years meditating and and\ntracking bears\nand um everything i had ever wanted\nstarted to come to me it was it was\nbizarre\nlike people like jill bilty taylor but\nthis type of miracle started happening\nover and over and over again and i would\nsay to the universe\nbut i was really fussy when i asked for\nthis and it would just say\noh sweetheart we want you to have\neverything why do you think pain exists\nso that you'll ask for things so that we\ncan demonstrate our love for you by\ngiving you those things\nwhen you're in peace and so try going to\npeace and just staying there and\nsee if things you asked for\nwhen you were a child when you were an\nadolescent when you were young\nif those things don't come and find you\ni wrote this book just because i wanted\nto be absolutely sure i was telling the\ntruth i didn't want magic miracles\ni use those words because stuff like\nthat happens to me a lot\nand i wanted to get out of it i wanted\nit to just be the science let's just\ntalk about the facts\ntruth truth truth and i went deeper into\nintegrity than i'd ever gone and the\nmiracles and the magic in my life went\nabsolutely bananas because i was in\npeace i was in that ring of truth all\nthe time and holding myself there\nwhoa you want to manifest a ferrari\nget some peace\n[Laughter]\nwhat what are the things you think we\nshould be\nasking for if asking at all because\nlike you said that that if you're in\npeace you can probably attract anything\nyou ever wanted\nuh but as we spoke about earlier\nsometimes everything you ever wanted\nisn't what you really need and isn't\nthat satisfying as you expect it to be\nis there is there a\nis there a better search that we should\nbe on\nthat then helps us i i always it's kind\nof two ways so\nhere's here's my my uh hypothesis and\ni'd love for you to dissect\nand destroy it if it's terrible but i'm\njust offering it that's what i live for\ni want to destroy it as an idea\ndestroyer was a strong word it was a\nstrong word if\nwe need to dissect it or take it in a\nnew direction that's better that's\nbetter let's use that\nuh it's uh one of\none of my teachers teachers would often\nsay that\nanything material in your life is like\nzeros so like lots of zeros so every\ntime you have a new material\naccomplishment or a material success or\na material goal it's like a zero\nand all those zeros if you look at them\nas they are they're they're not valuable\nat\nall they they actually don't satisfy the\nsoul and the heart and\nthe example that you gave earlier on but\nactually if if your\nintegrity in this in this language if\nyour spiritual connection is\nis aligned then that's like that one\nin front of all those zeros and all of a\nsudden all those zeros have meaning\nyeah and and and i remember hearing that\nas an 18 year old and thinking oh that\nmakes so much sense because i meet so\nmany people who have all the zeros in\nthe world\nbut but they themselves will tell me and\neven more so now\nwhere people i'm working with in\ncoaching will tell me jay this means\nnothing like this doesn't work and\nand now they're seeking that spiritual\nspiritual connection and so it's so\nimp that's where i'm seeing it that\nactually all of this can be given value\nwhen we have this pursuit aligned in\nintegrity\nbut all of it loses value when we don't\nhave that it's really beautiful and it's\nit's\ni believe that suffering has two\nfunctions and one is to get us back\ninto alignment and the second is to\npush our imaginations to cr to play with\nthis material universe in a creative way\nso every person i've ever\ncoached who has suffered greatly for\nwhatever reason and then found peace\nmakes more peace with the suffering\nthey've experienced\ncan you say that again that was\nbeautiful every suffering is the raw\nmaterial for its opposite\nthe more time you spend in fear if you\ngo to peace you have more courage\nthan others if you've spent more time in\ndepression\nyou go to peace you have more joy you\nspent time\nin um what rage you go to peace you have\nmore ability to be peaceful and to\nspread peace\none of my favorite examples is the\nspiritual teacher byron katie do you\nknow of her\nyeah i've interviewed her she's been on\nthe podcast ah yeah\nyeah i was talking to her one day and\nshe was a woman who was in horrible\nhorrible depression\nevery kind of pain physical mental\neverything and then she lost the ability\nto believe her own thoughts and was\nsuddenly\nin a space of complete peace and bliss\nbecause thought\nis what connects us to culture and once\nshe lost the ability to be in culture\nshe was her true self\nand um i was talking to her one day and\nshe said something about\nbeing you know the transformation and i\nsaid well you can't have been\nfat rat and she she looked at me very\nseriously and she said no i was a very\nbad person\nand she she was absolutely serious she\nis\nthe most delightful\njoyful blissful human being you can\nimagine\nand it's because she was so miserable\nthat when she came to peace her life\nexploded into joy\nso whatever suffering you've got going\non whoever's out there listening\ncome to peace and yes a one will appear\nin front of those zeros and you'll be\nricher than you ever\nimagined and what are the what are those\nsome of those beginning\nsteps towards peace martha that you\nbeautifully allow in the book but tell\nus some of those\nsteps to peace because i think when we\nthink of peace again\nand this is this is why going back to\nthe concept you've shared with us\nwhen we think about peace the problem is\nthe understanding we have of peace is\nthe culture's definition of peace yeah\nwhich is kind of like you know like\nthat's that's what peace looks like like\npeace looks like this\nthis very like you know perfect\ntranquility\nuh and and that's the challenge that\nwhen you have that cultural\nimage and vision of what peace looks\nlike\nyou don't allow for the pathway to peace\nto look like that i always feel like we\nhave\nwe have two we have two things we're\nalways looking at our vision of reality\nand then the actual path we're walking\nbut the actual path to peace doesn't\nlook like the vision to peace so we\nwe leave it we we we abandon that path\ngoogle piece and you get eight million\npictures\nof women in sitting on a deck in the\nsunset\nyeah and it's like that's not\nthat's not peace that's boring yeah\nactual piece is that alignment i was\ntalking about the feeling\nthat our bodies hearts minds and souls\nare all working in the same\nthey're working like a team of horses\nthat are exactly matched\nand they will go all kinds of amazing\nplaces\nlike they'll push you into action as\nsurely as they'll push you into rest\nyou know i i had a i had an autoimmune\ndisease\nseveral actually uh from the time i was\n18 to the time i was about 30 i was\nalmost completely bedridden and in\nconstant pain physical pain\nso it was not um a fun time raised my\nkids on a king-sized bed\nbasically and um\nwhen i was as i was trying to find my\nway\nout of that what i realized is that my\nbody was responding to whether or not i\nwas in the truth i had to\nconnect my truth to\nmy i had to connect my story in my head\nto the truth that my body was telling\nand then when i started following my\nbody heart and soul as well as my mind\ni locked into this thing that i call\nintegrity in this book but it's also\npeace\nbut it was at that point i remember i\ngot diagnosis for one of these\nthey were all terminal progressive\nautoimmune illnesses with no cure\nand i was resting i was resting i was in\npeace i was in peace i was meditating\nwhat else do you do when you're\nbedridden for 12 years but they've given\nme a hotline\nthat i could call i called this hotline\nand i said i've been resting and resting\nand resting and the pain is getting\nworse\nand the nurse on the hotline said when\nyour soul wants to dance\nthen lying down is effort and dancing\nis complete perfect peace like dance\nget up move even if it hurts do what\nyour soul wants\nand it completely knocked me out of that\nwhole yoga pose thing\nnothing against yoga but i realized that\num true peace pulls us through life by\nall four of those body heart mind soul\nand into\njoy and into wonderful amazing\nsituations it's\nput you behind that microphone right now\nlike\nit's not static it's ecstatic\nit's dancing tell me about the opposite\nmouth\ni'm intrigued by something because um i\ni learned about and i'm sure with your\nstudies you've come across this too or\nstudied with it\ni was i was very much uh trained in the\npath of bhakti bhakti yoga\nuh which is the path of devotion and\nlove and\nthe idea was that or\nor a core idea is that when one has\ntrue love and true compassion\nand true joy one can even experience\nstress for the object of our love or the\nidea of\nstress doesn't feel like stress anymore\nright because\nyou and and the closest thing can be\ndescribed and you've lived this\nuh through your beautiful examples and\nstories in in one of the deepest ways\nis the the closest example or comparison\nthat would be made\nis the idea of love uh of a mother for\nher child\nlike that level of love that like no\nmatter what challenge this is\nthis is love like you know it's it's not\ncoming from anything else a mother's not\nlooking for praise or\nvalidation or for the child to do\neverything perfectly a mother's love is\nbeyond\ni mean i feel that from my mother i grew\nup with that kind of love from my own\nmother\nso i know it exists uh where tell me\nabout how\nhow you understand that with this\nwith the movement towards stress and\npeace is that somewhere\nwhere does that come about where do we\nget to that point where we start to\nsee stress is peaceful because actually\nit's based on love\nthere's a word in psychology called\neustress eu\nplus the word stress which is the\nopposite of distress\nso distress is uncom discomfort and\neustress or positive stress is like\neudemonia\nis that where it comes from the eu or no\nyeah it's like euphoria or\num utopia yeah so eustress is positive\nstress\nand it's the kind of it's the difference\nbetween um\nbeing stabbed in the gut and being cut\nopen by a surgeon\nto heal you like it could be the same\ntype of pain\ni was walking down the street one day\nand i i tripped and\nturned my ankle and i was very worried\nthat i'd hurt it\nand then later on in the day i got a\nmassage and i realized during the\nmassage\nthat the massage was actually more\npainful than my ankle\nbut i was interpreting it as helping me\nso i\nloved it i was like deeper pressure\nplease um\nyou know whereas it was all about how i\nwas thinking about it\nand if we apply that to stressful\nsituations like somebody's screaming in\nyour face you can actually\ngo into that and go where is the\nwhere is the beauty where is the lesson\nwhere is the healing there's always a\nhealing in it\nyou can always find if you're caught on\nanything negative\nyou you know something in you needs to\nbe healed because\nif nothing needs to be healed nothing\nhooks you like that\nnothing is distressful you look at it\nand you go\nah this could go well like\nand and you're like you're such a living\nexample of that\nit's so funny i think you hit the nail\non the head when you said the words and\ni want everyone to write this down\nit changes when you interpret it as\nhelping that's the key like what you\njust said there with the massage example\nwhich i thought was brilliant\nis even when we're experiencing pain\nwhen we interpret that\nas helping us not hurting us\nthen it heals us and and as soon as we\ninterpret it as this is hurting me it\nactually stops helping us\nand stops healing us because at least in\nthe massage you know\nsomeone you're working with has\nexpertise\nbut sometimes when we're being badly\nhandled by\nculture or people around us we think\nthat they're damaging us but\neven then there is help there and that's\nwhat you're\npushing us to seek which you can always\nfind it if you're willing to walk the\npath of your integrity don't get pulled\ninto the story of the culture\nfind integrity find integrity so you you\nfind all\nthe places inside yourself where what\nyou believe\nis not true for you and this is the\nsource of all\nsuffering and i say this after 30 years\nof doing this coaching stuff\nthe single reason for psychological\nsuffering is believing something in the\nmind that is not true\nat the deepest level once and that's\ngoing through the inferno you get\nrid of those lies and then dante walks\nup purgatory\nin the next part of the divine comedy\nwhich is where you take the new truth\nthat you found in your own heart mind\nbody and soul and you begin to live it\neven if the people around you don't\nagree you know in your case even if your\nparents were like becoming a monk what's\nwrong with you or\nyour spiritual friends going don't get\nmarried and you're walking your true\npath that's purgatory and it strengthens\nyou\nyou go upward and upward and upward and\nwhen you reach the place where\nyour thoughts are completely clear and\nyour actions are aligned as well\nso now you've put activity into it\nyou've put that\nthe the joy of movement in peace the\necstasy of that\nyou get to the top of purgatory and\ndante just flies off into paradise\nat this point and i do believe he had\nan enlightenment experience and i was\njust talking to jill bolte taylor\nabout how that works neurologically it's\na real condition\nto which we are biologically predisposed\nand\nthat's what everyone is actually in\ntheir heart and soul\ntrying to find beautifully said martha\nabsolutely beautifully said\nand i i only wanted to add this because\ni think it\nrelates to what you're saying there is\nthat often people\nfeel that as you go on that journey\nat one point everyone's going to agree\nwith you and everyone's going to somehow\nlove you and everyone's going to\nand and and that doesn't happen and and\nyou know that's\nno matter how much in integrity you're\nliving\nthat doesn't mean that everyone loves\nyou\nbelieves in you and thinks you're\namazing can i tell one more story oh\nplease i'd love for you to yes\nabsolutely i'd love i had to i had to i\nhad to take it there because\ni think we also again have this culture\nview of\nif i live in integrity and if i'm\naligned and if my actions are perfectly\nmanifesting and i'm spirit\nthen all of a sudden everyone's gonna\nbelieve in me and agree and i haven't\nexperienced that at all\nthe more i've gone into integrity the\nmore i've gone into integrity the more i\nrealize\num there are more people who have issues\nwith that\nso it's it's not yeah it's not become\neasier so i'd love to hear your story\nokay\nso when i was 29 i decided\nthat i was not going to tell a single\nlie for a whole year\num it was a new year's eve um resolution\nlater on when i needed therapy from this\nmy therapist told me that my biggest\nproblem was i kept my new year's\nresolutions\nbut i did not tell a single lie there\nof being 29 to 30. i don't tell lies now\neither\ni just decided no lies at all um i found\nmy true self that year\nthat was the year my body started to\nheal i also\nlost my religion my family of origin\nwhich is very deeply part of that\nreligion so complete\nno contact every friend i'd made growing\nup before the age of about 17\nmy job and my marriage and\ni i realized i was gay\nthis was not a year of everybody coming\nto my side\ni was this is what i came out thinking\nfor the first time in my life i was\nhealthy and happy and there was\nno part of culture that was on my side\nand i realized that if i want to walk my\nparticular path\ni have to give up like i\nyour integrity will give you every\nsingle thing you need to be happy\neverything the wildest dreams the\ndeepest love\nthe joy the most joyous experiences but\nit will cost you absolutely everything\nelse and yeah my whole life\nchanged from that and that's when i\nstarted coaching and that's when\ni started getting published and\neverything just went from there but i\nwas stripped down to\nbone by total integrity i don't\nrecommend that\nby the way it's too rough martha this\nhas been\nsuch a joy speaking with you and\nlearning from you today everyone\ni've been talking to martha back the way\nof integrity\nfinding the path to your true self the\nbooks available now please please please\nmake sure you go and study this deeply\nthis isn't one of those books that\num you're just gonna read once and and\nkind of\nyou know put it on the shelf and think\noh that was cool it's it's it's gonna be\na book that you study it's a book that's\ngoing to make you reflect it's a book\nthat you want to\nsit with use it as a workbook use it as\na

living in integrity\nas well as learning all the amazing new\nskills and all the\npassion projects you want to build and\nall that kind of stuff you want to do\nit comes from this this is actually the\nroot of it and sometimes when we don't\nstart here and we get started on\neverything else\nwe either get everything and it doesn't\nfulfill us or we don't get it at all\nbecause we weren't asking from a place\nof peace and so\nright i really want you all to start\nhere and um\nmartha as you know as as you listen to\nthe podcast and\nand and sharing your wonderful thoughts\nabout it\nwe end
