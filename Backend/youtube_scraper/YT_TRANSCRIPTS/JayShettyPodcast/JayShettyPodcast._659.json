studying with\nwith jay um uh\ni felt fell in love with the the\nbhagavad gita\njay and i have been spending time we've\nbeen hanging we've been traveling\ntogether\njay has really been the the catalyst for\nthis next phase of my life\nwe have uh committed to one another in a\nbrotherhood\num of service\nand support and uh\nyou know we we've been uh i guess we've\nbeen in the gym\nyeah we we've been sold in the soul gym\nuh working out for the past eight months\nand this is really this is our first\ntime\num you know uh\ndoing anything that's a a that's public\nfacing so\nuh i'm excited to talk about uh what\nwe've\nyou know been working on and uh jay's\nbeen working with my\nmy family pretty much uh every day a new\nsmith\nuh starts to uh study with\nwith jay and um also our\nour teacher radhanatswamy so it's been\nit's been a beautiful year um and i'm\nvery\nexcited to to start talking to people\nabout what we've been\nstudying and learning and uh doing\ntogether\nabsolutely man and i also want to say\ntoo like i think it's rare where\nyou you get to sit down with someone\nthat you've got to know intimately and\nclosely\nand also when you sit down and i've i've\nprobably watched i'm trying to think i\nthink i've watched every interview\nyou've ever done like over the years\nbefore i met you when i met you i'm\nalways talking to you i'm like i\nremember you said this\nfive years ago or 10 years ago you were\nsaying this and when i'm sitting down\nwith you now i'm thinking you know it's\ni remember the first time i properly met\nyou was at willow's birthday a few years\nback\nand everyone was wearing it was\nwilloween yeah so everyone was dressed\nin costumes and stuff so i didn't even\nknow it was you and then you had you had\nlike the zorro kind of mask over your\neyes\nand so it was a big person i was like oh\nmaybe that's will maybe that's not i\ndidn't know and then\nyou lifted your mask off and the thing i\nrecognized you about from the moment i\nmet you was just your ability\nyou have this unique ability to just be\nreally present\nand kind and and deeply there with\neveryone you meet\nand i think that for you know having\nhaving met you in\npublic arenas whether it was the bad\nboys premiere and then in our personal\nmeetings as you were mentioning\nyou you're just even better okay and i\nthink that that's so hard to be\nyeah when you're that good so\nbut i remember that and that was the\nhospitality men rodney felt with you\nlike that\nthat ability to care for each person\nwalking in the family aspect\nmaking us feel welcomed and a part of it\nthat i just think that that in today's\nworld\nthat human aspect is what we're all\nmissing\ni think that's a that um\nis a a part of my\ndna you know um part of it from\ndifficult aspects of my childhood you\nknow\ni grew up with violence in my home\nyou know so um i developed\nyou know a really acute emotional\nsense you know out of defense you know i\njust needed to make sure that my father\nwas okay i needed to make sure things\nwere going well\nand i just became really hypersensitive\nto emotional movement in a room\nas a as a defense mechanism and then as\ni\nyou know grew and as i started to\ndevelop that you know that heightened\nsense that\nstarted out as defense as i settled down\nand you know came into uh\na deeper understanding of my my\nuh my power and my desires in the world\nit was easier to connect\nto people in a loving way it trans\nit transferred easily from a defense\nmechanism\nto an ability to love and and\ncare for people that's that's amazing\nthough that you were able to process it\npositively\nyeah i feel like we're living at a time\nwe've talked about this before that\nour childhood experiences form\nour adult desires absolutely and i feel\nlike now people are starting to hear\nthat in the conversation where they're\nlike\noh yeah because this happened with my\nparents\nnow i feel like this how do you think\nyou were able to\nbecause we've talked about this before\nwhen you've talked about different your\nmother your father what you learned from\nthem tell us a bit about\nwhat you learned and how you were able\nto process it positively and engage with\nit\nrather than create a negative story from\nit because a lot of people may see\nviolence and react differently yeah yeah\ni think there's\nalways uh an aspect of\nus that when we feel unloved\nyou know in any capacity in any\nrelationship when we feel\nunloved uh when we feel mistreated\nwhen we feel uh somehow\ndisrespected um it's a natural reaction\nto want revenge\nand i think that's what happens with\nmost people\nspecifically in our in our most\nvulnerable stages when we're children\nand we haven't done anything to deserve\nthat kind of treatment um it's really\nhard for the ego to not click into\nrevenge\nyou know and you know once\ni discovered that that\nmechanism once i saw that that\nlike that that most of us walk around\nwith\nyeah that you know we we want revenge\nagainst that mistreatment it's a little\npiece of that\nwith all of us so the problem is\nthat when you seek revenge you destroy\nyourself\nand that's the um\nthat's the paradoxical\nconflict that we all\nlive in someone has mistreated us\nwe want revenge but if we take it we\nhurt ourselves more\nit's crazy right you know what i mean\nyou know so that is the uh\nas rather not swami referred to the\nperplexing situation that we find\nourselves in\nand the the the only\nanswer is loving kindness\nand most of us don't want to hear that\nit's like i'll take my chances with\nrevenge\n[Laughter]\ni'm going to take my chances with\npunching this dude in the face or\ncussing this girl out or whatever it\ntakes\nbut uh um i can't do love and kindness\nand for me i had such a beautiful\nexample of loving kindness\nin my grandmother when when i was\ngrowing up\ni always knew i wanted to be that\nthe way that she loved and cared for\npeople\ni didn't realize that her giving was\nconnected to her\npiece that was something that that i got\na concept of\nlater but i always knew that that was my\nexample and i think that's the critical\npart we need\nwe need an example somebody has to be an\nexample human beings\nare uh creatures of example we need we\nyou got to see it yeah you know so uh\nthat's really where i am in my life\nright now i i want to\n[Music]\nshow what it looks like to be loving\nand kind and giving and forgiving\nand and i i just wanna i wanna model\nthose virtues as best i can\nit's amazing how the thing we think\nthat's gonna help us feel better\nyes is actually what makes us feel worse\nyeah\nand you hold on to it because somewhere\ninside of you you feel\nyou have to be the person to show that\nperson yes yeah\nthe truth like you feel like it's your\nresponsibility\nyou're going to be the hammer of justice\nyeah and so you carry that\nand it reminds me of there was this\nthing that this this lesson that we were\ntalking about and sharing in\nin our meetings was um this quote by\nrussell barkley where he said\nuh people who need the most love ask for\nit\nin the most unloving ways absolutely\nabsolutely and that's what you were\nsaying when you were giving examples of\npeople in our society today\nwho it sounds crazy but somehow\nthey are seeking love absolutely and\nwhen you\nwhen you kind of put that in your head\nyou're like oh\nlike that's that's just a plea uh a\nbegging\nbegging yeah a literal like\nit's not even a proposal it's like a\ndemand it's a demand\nabsolutely and you're saying and i love\nwhat you said then that's why i'm\nbringing it back to what i was saying\nearlier the reason why i was\nhighlighting the personal aspect of you\nis that i think that the example\nthat you're setting through who you can\nbe\nis even more than what you've done\nyeah what you've done is amazing and\nthere's nothing to be taken away from it\nit's phenomenal what you're achieving\nand what you continue to achieve\nbut being able to do that with a loving\nheart yeah\nthat must be i mean how does that feel\ninternet does that also feel that way or\nor no is that are you like no no jay no\nthe success\nsuccess feels way better than that yeah\nyou don't get it but no but you know we\nwe had that we had that conversation and\nthat there was a\nthere was a real period in my life that\ni had to\nto struggle with\nwe can win or i can be nice\npick one right and\ndifferent people pick different things\nright\nfor the type of material world\nclimbing you know that that i did for\na big chunk of\nmy life um\nit was military-minded you know\nwe're going to get that flag to the top\nof that hill\nand you are going to help or you're not\ngonna be here\nright so that's that's one mindset and\nthen after i got the flag to the hill\na couple of times and kept getting the\nflag to the hill and\nrealized that you just\nyou don't feel good and you've\nscorched earth you know around you\nand you're like no but nobody's really\nhappy\nyou know and then i started to have to\nquestion\nthat mindset you know i had one of the\ngreatest runs\nin hollywood history you know\nthat eight number one movies all over\na hundred domestic biggest global movie\nstar all of that and my family was\nmiserable you know\nand i had equated winning\nwith happiness right\nit's like we're winning what is your\nproblem you know\nyou know and the the\ntransition from product\nfocus like\nmilitary-minded get to the top of that\nhill and then i shifted into\nuh a mindset it was really my kids who\nbrought me\nout of that uh a shift into\ndiscovering like well damn people really\ncare about how they feel right\nyou know yeah and it's as crazy as that\nsound\nlike you know you know my father\nwasn't concerned with how i felt\nyou know he wasn't concerned with how he\nfelt\nhe was military-minded you achieved the\nmission\nand there's two possibilities when i\ngive you a mission there's two\npossibilities\none you complete the mission or two\nyou're dead\nright you know that's what my father was\nsaying i grew up with that oh cool\nright i actually had to discover\nfeelings right and start like\ni used to have to really focus on okay\nhow's this person feel how's this person\nfeel not what do i need them to do\nand not they're wasting our time right\nnow and we're losing time and we're\ngoing to not finish this mission\nright but there's a there is a balance\nbetween\nthe mindset of achieving\nand loving kindness\nthat at this point in my life i've\nactually discovered the magical balance\nbut it's really hard to get people to\nlet go\nof the attack and defend achievement\nmindset\nand trust the care and concern\nfor your fellow humans as a\nway of creating higher production yeah\nyeah i hope everyone who's listening and\nwatching right now is taking this in\nbecause\ni think what you're painting is a very\ntransparent\nhonest picture of our minds yeah\nlike i can relate to what you're saying\nso i can relate to times in my life\nwhere\ni've been so about winning and success\nand and numbers or whatever it may have\nbeen and\nand i know i'm not even becoming the\nperson i want to be\nin that process and i don't even like\nmyself but because you're choosing to\nlike yourself because of what you're\nachieving\nyou're finding a new way to like\nyourself but not over\nwho you really are yeah and so i just\nhope everyone who's listening and\nwatching you know\nwhen you speak sometimes will it's so\nit's so extreme because you've got so\nclose to that emotion that sometimes\npeople can think oh no that's a bit\nextreme i'm a bit more balanced but\nreally we all have that\nkind of does that make sense like we all\nhave a bit of that extreme instinct\ninside of us\nin some area of our life yeah yeah and\nit's it's sometimes a delusion to feel\noh i'm actually balanced like\nwe sometimes listen and go oh yeah no\nthat's him that's him his father was\nmilitary yeah\ni'm but i'm i'm balanced you know and we\nalways feel\nwe always feel weird badly we're about\nyes exactly i felt like i was balanced\ni felt like i was balanced we always\nfeel like we're on that as the buddha\nwould says we talked about the middle\npath\nlike we always feel we're on the middle\npath and everyone's lost i know yeah\neveryone else is confused oh my gosh\nthat that celebrity is confused or that\nperson's on the wrong path i'm okay but\nyou know i really hope as you're\nlistening to this everyone that put\nyourself in those shoes put yourself in\nthat mindset it's a healthy\nuh activity to do and you can learn\nsomething from the extremes\nalso right and when you when you look at\num the athletes\nright there's a certain extreme mindset\nthat you i was gonna say you have to\ntake on i don't know that you have to\ntake it on\nwhat i do know is that in this society\num we worship that mindset\nthat um you know it's the the\ncan you become michael jordan\nwithout that mindset yeah you know\nand that is a that is a really\npowerful difficult question it's like\nmost people can't sustain the mindset\nyes\nthat you know fortunately because it's\nit can be so destructive but most people\ncan't sustain\nthat level of discipline to manifest the\nthings that they want\nin in their life and\nthere's just a there's a poisonous\nedge to that kind of\ndiscipline and i've been to the edge of\nthat kind of material world discipline\nin my mind\nand i can tell you you can have a whole\nlot of stuff\nand be miserable out there on that edge\nand i found a much\nmore comfortable uh and productive\nspace in my life and you still need that\ndiscipline yes\nbut it it it's like when you're when you\nuse\nthat kind of power to achieve things\nit's like there's a uh there's a there's\na\nuh uh brutal reckoning yeah\nthere's a brutal reckoning at the at the\nend of that\nbut the amazing thing about you is\nyou've been on that path\nin that direction i think people\nsometimes see these flips where they're\nlike\noh yeah now that you are rich and\nsuccessful and famous now you're going\nthis way but actually\nfrom our conversations and how you've\nshared with the family or even when\nwe've\nuh worked with some of the friends in\nyour life it's like this has actually\nbeen a\nlong process this isn't just 10\n12 months this isn't just a couple of\nyears this is planted a seed from your\ngrandmother\nyes absolutely through your whole life\nalways be reminded of it to study\nspiritual paths world religions to study\nphilosophies\nlike this is just a long process tell me\nabout\nthat belief your grandmother had in you\nand tell me a bit about how she\nplanted that deep seed because i think\nwhat you said at the beginning that we\nneed that example\ni think everyone if they really\nreflected there'd be someone in their\nlife either indirectly or directly\nbut sometimes we forget them but when\nwe've been talking everything your\ngrandmother's been such a\npivotal figure yeah yeah i'd love for\nyou to share what you think she did that\nwas so powerful because\nmaybe there are some parents listening\ntoday and brothers and sisters and\ngrandmothers and grandparents listening\ntoday and\nthey'll be able to do that for their\nchildren and grandchildren my father my\nmother and my grandmother\nwhenever i think about the the three of\nthem\num i i picture a triangle\nin my mind and i see like my father\nwas the the base uh as discipline\nand my mother didn't care about anything\nbut\neducation like that you had\nto learn grow study travel\nlike my you know my mother was really\nserious about\neducating the mind and uh\nmy my grandmother uh\nwas love and god\nmy grandmother was that grandmother at\nresurrection baptist church\nand she had you know we were doing our\neaster recitations and we was in the\nnativity\nyou know so she was that she was that\ngrandmother at the church\nand her life was deeply devoted\nto god um and jesus\nin the form of loving service\nright so the form that it took was\nshe was working hard to love\neverybody you know my i remember my\ngrandmother\nuh bringing homeless people into\nour house when we were little and\nwashing them in our bathtub\ni thought that was the nastiest thing ah\nbut she would be in the bathroom with\nher hands\nwashing homeless people you know and as\na child it was\nlike no\nbut as i grew older i just i just saw\nhow\ndedicated and devoted she was\nto living her life in service\num it took me 50 years to figure\nyou know to figure out what the secret\nof that was you know but\nit's it was um there was\nthere wasn't there was a day of her life\nthat wasn't devoted to uh\nloving and and serving you know\nand i just watched her she worked the\nthe graveyard\nshift at the hospital and she watched\nus my brothers and sisters during the\nday while my parents were at work\nyou know and then when my parents got\noff work then she went she would take a\nlittle nap and then she would go to work\nat the hospital\nyou know and she was the\njust the the happiest person\nthat i had ever met nothing faced her\nshe was okay\num and i remember i was about 12 and i\nhad started\nuh rapping and you know so i had my rap\nbook so i had all of my all my little\ncurse words and everything in my rap\nbook\nand she found my rap book and she never\nsaid anything and she just opened the\ncover and she wrote\na letter to me um dear willard\ntruly intelligent people do not have to\nuse words like this\nto express themselves\ngod has given you the gift of words\nbe sure to use those words to uplift\npeople\nand i you know i was sitting i was\nreading that\nand just love gigi yeah and\nyou know that was part of the reason why\ni never used profanity\nin any of my music and\nit was like she she missionarized me\nin that way to make sure that what i was\ndoing\nwas uplifting others\nyou know and when you're telling stories\nyou can always find the part of the\nstory that is\na gift for the potential of liftment of\nsomebody that would see it\nyeah you know so uh but yeah she was\nall god all love i love that man that's\nsuch a beautiful story i hadn't heard\nthat one before oh yeah\nwhen your grandmother finds your rap\nbook and you got curse words in it\nit's a bad look it's a bad look well\nit's good that you found it that early\nand that\nthat had such an impact on you and and\nbrought you out where was the\nas you started to grow in that success\nand that journey\nand you decided you wanted everything\nyou do to have a positive impact on\nothers whether it was music and then\nmovies\nand then that journey led you to just\ntell us about\nthe the hard work and graft that went\ninto the creation of what you said\nearlier which was like\ni was working so hard and my family\nhated me and this didn't work\nbut tell us about that hard work because\ni think sometimes\nit's forgotten yeah yeah and it's you\nknow it's it's almost like\nyou don't realize how\nwhen i started spending closer time with\nyou and started seeing you on set\nyeah yeah and in the trailer and then\nyou'd walk out and in two seconds you'd\nbe in character\nyeah yeah and then you'd walk back in\nand you'd be real again\nand then and then we were in your man\ncave and you have your um you have the\nmovie plotted out and you'd walk me\nthrough like how that\ntells you and and i started to\nunderstand and appreciate\nthat what you do is a science\nand it is strategic and systematic and\nit is\na skill you have worked on for decades\nand decades and decades you start to\nrealize that\nthe external view of like will's\ncharismatic and he's cool and\nyou start to realize like yes but that\nis underpinned with\njust hard work yeah uh and and i think\nthat that's a real awakening that\na lot of people don't get to experience\nwhen they see you on a big screen\nbecause you don't see all of that there\nyou don't see the um\nthe learning of the lines and and you\nhave a phenomenal memory like you\nyou know we're studying spiritual books\ntogether and you can remember\nstuff that you've read that day and that\ncomes from all your years of training\nand\nand even your ability when we first met\nand you said j i'm an actor\nyou know when we're direct just direct\nme and we can do this because i can drop\ninto a\nstudent mindset so so much of this is\ninternalized it's not tell us a bit\nabout\nhow long it took to learn all of this\nand start playing with it beyond just\nthinking\noh yeah i've got this because i can act\nyou know i grew up in a military\nhousehold\nand um you know while there you know\nthere are certain\nemotional drawbacks to that um\nthere there are uh\nintellectual and organizational pluses\nthat are um you know\nhard hard to beat so um\nyou know my my father was really\nyou know strict on\norder um organization\nand the uh\nincremental completion of tasks\nyou know um and you know also combined\nwith my mother's push\non on education uh as a really young\nchild you know we had\nto put hospital corners on our beds and\nour shoes\nwere lined up you know so and\nyou know at at six years old\nwe were we were forced to think along\nthose\nmilitary lines um and everything\nwas a mission to my father like you know\nnever there was nothing that was um\na basic task you weren't just gonna\nwash the dishes you know it was a\nmission you\nknow that had to be completed with\num you know military precision\nyou know down to how much dishwashing\nliquid you're using and how much the\nbottle cost and if you use that\nmuch and how many dishes do you wash\nwith that amount\nof dishwashing liquid and how long\nare you going to be able to use this\ndishwashing\nbottle so you can relate that to how\nmuch work you have to do to be able to\nwatch that many your dad sounds indian\nyeah\nthat's more that is intense yeah you\nknow so it was really\nyou know his mind was like that and i\ntook you know\nwe always take the things we hate the\nmost from our parents\nbut you know from that the the gift of\nof structure and the gift of breaking\ntasks down you know you said you know\nyou set the goal\nbut the breaking the tasks down into\nsmaller manageable pieces was a\nthing that i came out of my childhood\nwith\num you know for for example you met jl\nyeah yeah so i told when i when i said i\nwanted to i wanted to be the biggest\nmovie star\nin the world you know and i was 18 or so\ni haven't met\ni want to be the biggest movie star in\nthe world so the first thing\nthat we did is we looked at\nokay well what are the top 10 movies\nof all time because if you want to be\nthe biggest movie star in the world\nyou're going to have to make the biggest\nmovies in the world\nso we said well what are the top 10\nmovies so we looked at the top 10 movies\nwe said well what are the patterns what\nare the patterns in the top 10\nmovies and at the time 10 out of 10\nwere special effects movies and\n9 out of 10 were special effects movies\nwith creatures and 8 out of 10 were\nspecial effects movies with creatures\nand a love story\nso you know for that's where the\nbent for me towards sci-fi\nmovies came from the recognition of the\npatterns\nof sci-fi creatures and a love story\nso that became what we were looking for\nwith everything and then\nindependence day was a no-brainer and\nthen men in black\nwas you know behind that and\nit it's it's that kind of\nsystemized algorithm yes right exactly\nlooking for what's the\nwhat is the pattern you know and that's\nthat's uh\nyou know one of the one one of the gifts\nmy father\nuh uh stuck me with coming coming out of\nchildhood\nyeah this is one of my favorite parts\nabout talking to you because of this\nability to to turn those into gifts yeah\nand and i i want to just emphasize that\npoint to everyone who's listening and\nwatching again because\ni think we're living in a time right now\nwhere\nthere's a lot of bitterness towards\nparents and what we've received and\nand some and rightly so as well like\nsome things are you know\nquite hard to deal with that level of\ntrauma etc but at the same time\nwhen we start looking at our lives this\nway not in not in a fake way or in\ngenuine way but\nbut really start to process some of\nthese things to see the powers that it\ngave us absolutely well all the\nsuperheroes that we all love in sci-fi\nmovies\nthey all got their powers from bad\nthings yeah exactly no one ever had\nsomething good happened to them\nand then they like for spider-man he got\nbit by a spider\nlike all the superheroes we all love and\nworship all got their powers from\nsomething bad happening to them you know\nit's really difficult\nto say that to someone yeah\nin the in the middle of the the throws\nand you should have medic experience\nyeah we've talked about that right\nbut you know from\nsitting on this side of the experiences\nthat i've shared uh\nyou know in in my life and in my\nexperience\num there's there's\nthere's no such thing as a bad\nexperience\nright there's experiences you don't like\nand they hug\nand they hurt right but to define\nsomething as a bad\nexperience\nfor for me um has not been true\neverything that's ever happened\nto me in my life that at the time\num was\ndeeply traumatic and and debilitating\nyou know there's\nthere's you know been only two times in\nmy life when\ni contemplated suicide wow\nyou know there's been two times in my\nlife um\nyou know the the once was when my my uh\nmother and father uh separated\nwhen my parents broke up and i you know\ni was 12.\nand you know that was one of the only\nyou know\nserious times in my life that i\ncontemplated\nsuicide but even out of that as i look\nback on that the pain\nof that experience cultivated devotion\nin my life to my family\nand i just never\nwanted to have my children\nthat and of course the you know the i\ngot divorced\nwith from cherie so that was i was\nrecreating\nthat situation but it it woke me up in a\nway\nthat forced me to try to\nuh connect with my children so the the\nnegative experiences or the things that\nwere\nawful at the time\nthere you know there's the there's\nalways the other side of\nthe coin and in my experience\ni've cultivated uh\nonly positive things out of the most\nnegative experiences\nof my life my my my father's death\num and the six weeks up to my father's\ndeath\nwas probably the most formative time in\nmy life\nand as painful as it was and as\ndifficult it wasn't all the stuff\nthat came up during the time i still\nit it was a powerful\nformative positive experience in my life\ntell us a bit about that if you don't\nmind about why you felt it was formative\nand because i think a lot of people go\nthrough the loss of their parents and\nyou know we've talked about this like\nthe idea of like sometimes people regret\nof what they did or didn't say to them\nyeah yeah yeah or maybe what they\nexpected of their parent what was it\nthat was so powerful\nthat allowed you to feel that way about\nthat moment because\num i got a i got a gift that some people\ndon't get and it was that\nthe doctors told us he had six weeks to\nlive\nright so and then he lived for four\nmonths\nright so i\ni got a warning so most people you know\nmost\npeople don't get a warning you just get\nthe call one day and you just you just\ndidn't get a chance\num and when i found out\nthat he was dying um\nit just by the grace of god was in the\nmiddle\nof the shooting i was doing a movie\ncalled collateral beauty\nand it was about a guy dealing with the\ndeath of his daughter so i was into the\nuh tibetan book of living and dying\nand um reading all the uh was it\nelizabeth kubler\nuh just reading all the all this stuff\nabout death so i've been programmed\nfor six months and i had read and\nstudied all of this\nall these books about death and grief\nand dying and then i get the message\nand i was like i said you know i sat\ndown\nwith my father and of course i had all\nof my traumas and all of my issues and\neverything with them but i had also\nbeen six months of programming of\nall of the things that you're supposed\nto do\nyou know to prepare yourself for the\ndeath of a loved one\nand you know so i\nsat with them and we we talked about\neverything so i said\neverything that i wanted to say and we\nwe got to those six\nweeks and when we got to those six weeks\nuh we were clear\nbut then he lived for another\nthree months so what happened was\nevery meeting every time i saw him i was\nflying back to la\nbut every every time i saw him\num was like oh thank god yeah\nand then every time we said goodbye we\nmade sure we said a\ngood thorough full goodbye because we\nknew at any moment that could it could\nactually be the last goodbye\nright and but the lesson was\nit's always like that when we say\ngoodbye\nwe can't know if this is the last time\nwe will ever see\nyou should never greet someone casually\nor say goodbye to someone casually\nand that lesson came from that\nexperience\nevery moment was so rich\nevery time we saw each other\nand every time we said goodbye we made\nsure was a good\nthorough full goodbye but that's how\nyou're supposed to live every day anyway\nevery time you leave your house could be\nthe last time\nyou're supposed to like be in the\nrichness of your hellos and goodbyes and\nthank yous you know and\nyou know so i learned that lesson um\nwith my father and then when he when he\npassed\nit was easy\nwe were we were finished you know and\njust the lesson of\nthat kind of presence and that kind of\nattention\nand that kind of recognition that\ntomorrow's not\npromised you know and just getting\ngetting shaken out of thinking that\nyou're going to have\nyou know tomorrow anybody who hasn't\nspoken to their parents\nor their brother or their cousin that\nthey had a thing with or their ex and\nthey don't talk anymore\ncall them right now\nyou just don't like don't think you're\ngonna have a chance to call them\nto to mar to tomorrow or\nnext week and it's like that that\nopportunity with my\nfather changed every relationship\nin my life i i've cleaned\nall of the relationships in my life to\nno regret\ni do not want someone to be gone and i\nwish i had and wish i could have\nand um i'm just i'm not doing that in my\nlife\nthat's beautiful man thank you for\nsharing that that's that's just hearing\nyou say that i think\nthere's a lot of people who needed to\nhear that and i'm hoping everyone's\ngonna pick up the phone and message and\nif that person's not here anymore still\nwrite them a letter\nright absolutely right if they're not\nhere anymore and you didn't get to say\nall of that write a letter\nread it out to them read it to a picture\nof them if that's what it takes\nallow yourself to share and express\ndon't hold it in and hold it back\nbecause somehow that energy will still\nreach that person and that energy's left\nyou too\nso absolutely you know even if you can't\ncall someone up today make sure you\nmake sure you still follow the same\npractice because\nyeah it's it's just not it's never worth\nit it's never worth it it's just\nnever worth it never worth it and and i\nlove that idea of valuing each\nhello and goodbye absolutely and not\ntaking it for granted or taking it\nlightly you never know\nwhatever's gonna happen right you just\nhave no idea and unfortunately we\nwe we see it this is this is the um\nthere's actually a beautiful i don't\nknow if we ever talked about this\nthere's a beautiful\npiece in the mahabharat which is the\ngita is a small part of\nand one of the students asked the\nteacher he said what's the most\namazing thing in the world like what's\nthe most incredible\nthing in the world and and the teacher\nresponds and says the most\nincredible amazing thing in the world is\nthat we see people\nleave all around us but we never think\nit's going to be us\ni never like so you see it and you have\nthat moment again and again\nand then you lose someone in your life\nand you think oh that could be me or\nyeah that could be someone else\nand you live like that for a day yeah\nand then the complacency sets back in\nabsolutely\ntell us a bit about you know you've been\nstudying world religions and spiritual\npaths\nfor for a long time and the first time i\nofficially reached out to you and your\nteam and everyone which was a few years\nback now\nwas because i saw that you'd been\nreading the gita and the gita was\nobviously the book that i read and\nstudied so deeply and\nand fell in love with and after having\nstudied world religions myself too and\nand i've i've had beautiful experiences\nreading the bible and the quran and\nand the gita and so when i saw you\ntalking about it when you were in india\ni was just like wow like this is amazing\nlike i'm already a huge fan\ni love will smith like how is will\nreading the gita i was like how did that\neven happen\nand then when i got to know you and jada\nand spoken family i realized that you'd\ntaken on a challenge to like study a\nworld religion every year and\ntell us about that and what you learned\nalong the way what were some of the\ntraditions that stood out\nin your journey uh that that and\nwhat did you learn from them whether it\nwas the kabbalah or even scientology all\nthose because\nyou've shared so many beautiful lessons\nwith me from what you've studied yeah\nand i'd love to pass them on so what\nwhat was uh\ni guess probably in the the first 10\nyears\nof our marriage that was uh\nme and jada's bonding right so\nevery year we would pick a spiritual\ntradition\nand we would study it all all the way\nthrough\nhow did you even start doing that like\nbecause when i hit when i heard you did\nthat i think jada told me first time\nwhen i heard you did that i was just\nlike i was i was just\nit just took me a back because i've\nalmost\nyou don't come across that all the time\nand i i was lucky enough\nto study world religions my father\nstarted encouraging me when i was about\n14\nto start reading spiritual books and\ni i dated a muslim girl who asked me to\nread the quran that's how i read the\nquran which was a wonderful\nexperience in my life at 16 i read the\nbible because we would celebrate\nchristmas\nand i'd feel guilty that we celebrated\nchristmas but i didn't hadn't read the\nbible\nso i started going to church on\nchristmas and then reading about\nchrist in the bible and i just\nabsolutely fell in love with the\nscripture and then\ni was just reading so many different\nbooks and finally i came back to the\ngita which was the book i was brought up\nwith\nbut yeah tell me about even why you and\njada decided to do that\nso i don't even know how it\ndeveloped as a thing i know um\nuh when we got married\nwe were trying to decide you know\nwhat what church we were going to get\nmarried and were we going to get married\nin baltimore or philly\nand would just who was going to be the\nthe priest you know\nand you know so gamey had a different\nreligious background\nthan gigi you know you know so we were\ntrying to figure all of that\nkind of stuff out and and jada didn't\nwant to do any of that\njada wanted for she and i to go to a\nmountain\nyou know and you know pledge our love\nand devotion to one another to god\nwithout\nyou know she felt like we we weren't\ngoing to um\nadhere to this specific religious\ntradition we would just be picking it\nfor\nour her mother or my grandmother or\nsomething to try to figure that out\nso um i think the discussion\nabout the the religious background we\nwould raise our children in is what came\nup\nuh when we were when we first got\nmarried\num and she grew up in a thing called the\nethical society\nin in baltimore and they would honor the\nthe different religions um and my\nbackground i\ni grew up i went to uh baptist church\num i went to a catholic school\nand some somewhere in that first decade\nof our\nmarriage we were like oh wouldn't it be\nhot\nif we could say that we had read cover\nto cover\nall of the major holy books um\nand we we started with the the bible\nand i just remember seeing her bible\nwas my you know how i do my books now\nyou see how like all my books are\nhighlighted all the way through and\nyou know she completed the entire\nbible you know seven months before me\nright so now it's on right\nso then when it came to time for the for\nthe quran\ni was like i was i wanted to win yeah\nright\n[Laughter]\nbut you know so we would take a year and\nwe would study\nall of these traditions as a you know\nreally as a way\nof the two of us bonding spiritually\nand and you know intellectually around\nthe concepts and\nyou know we went through kabbalah um\nand uh you know scientology and really\nwhat was happening is every time i would\nmeet\nsomeone who was of a different tradition\ni would allow that person to introduce\nme to what their\ntradition was and then i did ali\nand so we circled back around to the\nquran\nduring during that time but we really\njust\nwe we love the the idea\nof of spirituality\nand the study of the love of god\num and uh\nwe don't necessarily believe in\norganized religion we believe that the\norganizations\nkind of jump ahead\nof the spirituality you know the the\nyou know the church of christ is very\ndifferent than\nchrist the the the steps that christ\nactually\nwalked you know so we started to notice\nuh\nthose kinds of differences and we just\nwe really just wanted to find\num the truth\nyou know what is the truth and you see\nhow my whole family dives and the kids\nare doing it\nyeah now you know with the with the the\ngita\nand it's and it's really uh just just\ntrying to\nfind our way you know in in this world\nyeah and and\nand i love that and i was so fascinated\nby that myself because\ni saw that within myself and so when i\nsaw it with you and the family i was i\nwas\nso drawn to that because yeah i think\nthat\na lot of what we're trying to figure out\nin today's world\nhas been suffered for long enough in an\ninternal way\nthat when you're diving into these books\nof wisdom there's just so much there to\non earth because people have been\nthrough the same challenges for decades\nand decades and decades the the\nthe problems have already been solved\nand lived and solved\nyou know and at the core\nof all of\nthe you know the the spiritual teachings\nthat i've ever studied at the\nat the the core of\nall of the ideas um\nhow you treat your neighbor is\ncentral right yes absolutely yet\nsomehow people\nmanage to twist you know\nin in all the faiths and all backgrounds\npeople do unto others\nas you would have them do unto you is\nvery\nclear if you ask yourself that question\nwell in this situation how would i\nhave them do unto me and you did that\nyou'd never have a problem yeah because\nthe answer is never going to be i think\nthey should curse me out and spit on me\nand whoop my ass\ncause i was tripping\nit's like you just you know i mean i\nguess somebody\nyeah maybe no no no no no i think you're\nright i think you're right\nif i were in this situation how would i\nwant them to treat me\nyeah yeah right huge\nit's the most simple yeah yeah the most\nour teachers in the ashram would always\ntell us and i've said this to you before\nbut they'd always tell us that these\nprinciples\nyou'll learn them on day one you'll\nthink that you know them on day two\nbut you spend your whole life trying to\nrealize yes\nand and that's the challenge with us\nthat we we take what we learn on day one\nand what we know on day two\nto be like i already know that yes\nexactly and then the teaching doesn't\nwhat i love about what we've been doing\nis like\nthe teaching gets to like reveal itself\nto you it's like it's always opening up\nit's like a lotus flower it's right\nit's always blooming it's not like oh\nit's open now it doesn't matter yeah\nit's like always opening up to you and\nif you give it that time and patience\nthen you can truly see it grow and bloom\ninto something but if you just\nif you just try and force it open it\njust i mean\nyou know if you forced a flower open it\nwould just break and that's what happens\nthat what i say what i say to you all\nthe time\nis you know so to give people a sense of\nit so\nwe're we were doing you know\ntwo to four hours uh a day\nyou know you know a few days a week for\nmonths for months yeah for months you\nknow\nand you know i we were spending\nas much time together as we were would\nspend with our families or\nother things so we we we've logged some\nreal hours\nin this in this last year and the thing\nthat was\nalways amazing to me is\nthat we could take eight hours\nright and we spend it and we get it and\nwe study we do all of that\nand you leave my house and i pick up my\nphone\nhow quickly somebody could snatch me i\nwas like\nand and it really is\na serious moment-to-moment\npractice to remember to be nice to\npeople\nwhen you get sucked back into the\nfoolishness\nso hard and so fast\nand that was frustrating to me for a\nwhile\nlike like literally we would do eight\nhours\n[Music]\nand i'm great i'm great and you wouldn't\nbe\noff of this off of the block yet\nand i pick up my phone and there's a\nbusiness call and\nliterally that fast like literally in in\n45 seconds my mind could get triggered\nback into that that mindset\nyou know i i i know now that that's just\nit's every day yeah it's you don't you\nknow you don't get to know it\nand be done like it's a it's a daily\npractice\nfor the rest of your life to be able to\ndeal with the foolishness\nof this world in a way\nthat's uh productive and kind\nyeah now everyone knows i'm terrible at\nwhat i do well i know\nit's like as soon as\nyou're really bad at this oh jay you\nshould have left will with a little more\ngirth than that\nyou can't even last two seconds tonight\nthat's terrible\nwell you're work you're working with\nyears\nof of sediment you know all of us\nlifetimes like the conditioning is so\nstrong yeah\nyeah and it's it's almost like when we\nstart to do the work\nyou're walking into a garden full of\nweeds yeah\nyeah so all the flowers are covered all\nthe beauty of the garden is covered in\nweeds and so you're cutting down the\nweeds but because you've been watering\nthe weeds for so long they keep growing\nyeah and so you keep cutting them down\nand then they keep growing back\nit's the example the analogy of the\nmirror that's given um\nin the vedic tradition around how when\nyou walk in and you try and clean a\nmirror that hasn't been cleaned\nfor lifetimes it's dusty and so when you\nstart cleaning it the dust comes up in\nyour face and you're like oh\ni can't see i can't i can't see and\nthat's what we're all going through\nand we when we start realizing what you\njust said the day to day it's like if\nyou if\nif all of us said we want to plant i\nkeep using\ngardening analogies but it's only\nbecause it makes so much sense i feel\nbecause we're so disconnected from\nnature our mindset has become\ninstant and our mindset has become now\nwhereas when you watch nature nature's\nnever insulin yeah\ni call that hunting versus farming right\neverybody\nhunting versus farming where where\npeople just look just\nlet's let's get it let's get it and eat\nright\nthat's a great i love that i love that\nyou know versus no\nwe're gonna like we're gonna play the\ncrops\ni love that yeah because it's it's it's\nthe idea that\nif you if me and you said we want to\nplant a tree\nyou'd have to come back to that tree\nevery day to see how it was doing\nyeah and it wouldn't be a tree for many\nmany years but you'd have come back\nevery day water it\nsunlight move it replant the soil and\nthat's what we're doing with ourselves\nbut for some reason because we're so\ndisconnected from nature now\nwe think that oh if i just meditate\ntoday yeah\nthen it's you know it's like saying oh\ni'll eat today and i don't have to eat\ntomorrow oh yeah\nbro i showered last night i'm starving\nlast week i'm good\ni'm good but uh but yeah it's you know\nand i again it was your commitment i\nremember when we were on that first\nphone call and i was like\nyou were like oh yeah i want to work on\nthis i was like how much time do you\nhave like how much time do you have and\ni\nyou know your will smith's on thinking\nyou don't have any time and and i don't\nknow\nhow serious you get yet i'm not i'm not\naware yet\nof how how immersed and obsessed you get\nwith stuff i'm still learning about you\nand then you're like i've got two hours\nand i was like all right two hours a\nweek two hours\nbi-weekly two hours monthly you're like\nno two hours a hours a day\nand i was like wow he's real like he's\nserious\ni was like wow he's for real and then\nyou know it was just\nit was and i'd go away and you\nreinspired so much of my own study\nand that's what i was telling to you\nover christmas which is when we kind of\nbroke off as i went to london and you've\nbeen traveling\nit's like i spent the whole of christmas\nreading myself for four to eight hours a\nday meditating\nagain it's beautiful because i felt i\nhad to be more to give you more\nthat's beautiful and and i think that\nthat was such a\ngift you gave me where i felt back in\nlove\nwith what i fell in love with years ago\nthat's beautiful because of the work we\nwere doing yeah\nand because when you're answering\nsomeone's questions you have to read\ndeeper and think more and reflect more\nand so for me i went away from those\nmeetings going gosh\nyou know i better start reading more\nit was but it that's what's so beautiful\nabout sharing something like that\ntogether\nit was great when uh with the the rather\nnot swami\nwhen when uh\nyou told him that you were going to be\nworking with me\nand i just loved his response you say oh\nthat is so great\nyou're going to get to teach all of the\nthings you need to learn\ni remember i was i was just telling you\ni was like\ni was i was explaining to him how\nsincere you are and i was like you know\nhe's so\nserious and he's sincere and yeah that's\nwhen he came back to me like\nyou know that's when you know you've got\na good teacher who knows how to like\nsquash your ego\nyeah and make you realize how small you\nare\nand and it was beautiful because from\nthat moment that was my attitude when i\nwas meeting you i was like\ni'm saying this for me i'm saying this\nyou know and that allows you to be so\nmuch\nmore um just allows you to get out the\nway\nyeah and let the wisdom do its work yep\nthat's so real\nthis the central um\nproblem that has been\nthe focus of my life\nand everything that i've done has been\ncentered on\num having a successful\nlove relationship right so\ni saw my parents when when they were\ngrowing up and i hated that my parents\nuh marriage deteriorated and\num you know as young as i can remember\nfive six years old i wanted to be\nmarried i wanted to have a family\num i've never been the guy that that\nyou know wanted to do threesomes and\ngroupies and i like i just\ni've never been that guy i always wanted\nto\nuh come in commit and have a single\nsuccessful\nrelationship so the\nthe scientist in my mind and in my study\nof spiritual texts and things like that\ni've always been looking for the secret\nto successful\nuh love relationships and then as i've\ngrown it's sort of\nexpanded and i'm seeing the through line\nuh oh the same basic ideas are\nsuccessful parenting and the same basic\nideas are\nbeing a successful follower or a\nsuccessful\nleader or successful student and i\nstarted to see\nthe central issues\nwith all of human relating and it's it's\nthe the problems or it's not even\nproblems\nthe problem is really singular\nin if you're talking about a husband and\na wife or you're talking about a\na parent and a child or a democrat and a\nrepublican\nor a a you know\na saudi and an american whatever\nin all of the configurations of\nof human difficulty at the\nat the center of it is\nalmost exclusively a lack of\nunderstanding of the other person's\nperspective right and\nyou know it sounds simple and it it it\nit\nmay oversimplify slightly\nbut the the concept of\nignorance the concepts of ignorance and\ndelusion\nare always a problem yeah right\nit's it's always the center if you have\na difficulty with another human being\nthere's some point of ignorance\nand some point of delusion that are\nkeeping you from being able\non both sides on both sides right and\nthe the problem is you can only worry\nabout yours\nyou have to clear yours and then once\nyou clear yours and your vision\ngets uh clean\nand purified and you approach\na person from a purified\nspace things get a whole lot easier\nyou know and it's like you're all\nyou're you are always bringing poison to\nthe party\nand when you recognize that in any\ndifficulty you're having with\nany human being you brought poison to\nthe party\nright and if you can focus on\nlocating and purifying\nthe the poison you brought it opens up\nentirely new avenues of connection and\ncompromise and solutions\nthat you can create with a person\nand you know that has really\nbeen the the central focus of my life\nand being an\nactor has been spectacular in that way\nbecause my life is exploring my mind\nyou know and changing it right when i\nplay a character who believes something\nthat i don't believe i have to learn\nhow to feel something that's in\nopposition\nto my truth\nwhich is a spectacular skill set\nto have to uproot beliefs implant\nnew ideas and have them\nblossom on camera at the right moment\nyou know it's been such a a powerful\num inner process of development\nto explore acting in conjunction\nwith spirituality and supreme absolute\ntruth\nyou know to explore that as my job\nyeah is fantastic everyone should be\ntrained as an actor\nwhen you first said that to me when you\nfirst said that to me i was like\ni never thought of it and obviously i'm\nnot an actor and so i wouldn't know that\nthat\nwhen you said that to me i was like wow\nthat's like how people should be\ntaught how to be students right because\nthe idea that\nyou have the skill set and it's a skill\nto put your beliefs aside yes and go i\nneed to live by the beliefs that this\ncharacter would die\nabsolutely yes and what would they be\nwilling to die for yes and then you're\nexperimenting with it and then you can\nsee whether you like it or not\nright that's how it feels whereas most\nof us are so grounded in\nour own beliefs that we don't know how\nto take that hat off right\nand put another one on absolutely and\nthat's where all of our\nissues come from because that story of\nsomeone else yeah\nsomeone that you know that did that\nextremely well\nin in probably the the most difficult\ncircumstances with nelson mandela yes\nabsolutely you know you've spoke we've\nspoken about many times you've spoken\nabout it publicly many times i found\nthis\nclip of you guys together oh no you're\nnot in love\nthat i have to show you it's it's a\nwhile ago but it's really it's it's\nreally\nit's i've watched this whole i would\nwatch anyone who's watching you have to\ngo watch the whole thing i'm only\nshowing will a short clip\num but it's this clip here\ni don't know if you remember i was i was\nsaying to you you know\ni'm an actor\ni make rap music that's what i do what\ncan i do and you know\ni sat with mr mandela i was so inspired\nyou know you want immediately you want\nto quit your job\nyou know you want to go out in the\nstreets\n[Laughter]\nhe said he said no you have to\nunderstand the power\nof what it is that you do you have to\nunderstand the hope\nthat is created by the work that you\ncreate and\nhe told me that don't not to force it\nthat the call would speak to me and um\ntoday the uh the call has spoken to me\nand i humbly\ngratefully and will aggressively respond\nand\nthank you\n[Music]\nwow\ngoodness i've forgotten about that\n[Laughter]\nthat's wild wow\ni mean there are so many i could show\nyou that was one of those pictures there\nwas so many\nthat's fantastic beautiful clips of\nyoutube yeah\nno that was uh that was um\n[Music]\nthat was one of the\nyou know i'm not i'm not a man prone to\nregrets\nyou know and we talked about this a lot\nbut that was one\nof the that was one of the regrets and\nand you know i'm i'm making my way back\naround to the ideas and that's\nyou know part of our um\nrelationship uh and with rather not\nswami\nbut i was sitting with mr mandela it may\nhave even been that day\nand we were sitting he was calm he just\nhad this look on his face\nand i said uh i said\nwhat's that look on your face and he was\nkind of looking he was just watching\npeople\ni said you know something that the rest\nof us don't know\nhe definitely did yeah and he looked at\nme\nand he the look that i recognized\nnow was he said oh\nright that he was like that's the right\nquestion you know\nand he said um he said if\nyou come spend some time with me i'll\nteach you\nand somehow i was so\ni just felt so unworthy of that\nhe reached out to me every year\nbefore he died and you know he said i'm\nan old man\nyou need to come spend some time with me\nand i just felt\nunworthy you know um\nand he wanted to teach me what we're\nstudying\nyou know he went you know i\ni i've tasted a little bit of what\nhe wanted to teach me\nand you the the the question is\nhow can you smile in this world\nyou know because you're not going to\nchange it you know you're going to\nyou're going to\ndo your part but\nthis this this world is chaotic\nand it's brutal and it can be really\nunloving\nand how do you do your part with a smile\non your face\nyou know and it was um\nit's really beautiful one of the few\nthings not not even you know\ni know things happened in their in their\ntime so it's not a\nnot a regret regret regret but it's like\na\nregret but i i always say to you that\nit's\nfirst of all it's it's it's it's it's\nactually a very um\nthe fact that you didn't go because you\nfelt unworthy\nis is a at least from the traditions\ni've studied would be considered an\nextremely good spiritual qualification\nfor learning yeah like like when we\nthink\nit's weird like spiritual life is like\nit's teaching you\nself-worth without having low\nself-esteem yes yeah yeah but it's\nand you said it once in an interview\nspeaking about nelson mandela you said\nlike\nyou know it's like being in his presence\nmade you realize how small you were\nyes yeah but how big you could be how\nbig yes right you said that\nso when i said damn i said that yeah\nyou're gonna start saying that again\nyeah\nthat's good stuff yeah you said that you\nsaid that and\nand it was when i heard you say that i\nwas like\nthat is spiritual self-worth like we\nlive in a world today with self-worth or\nself-beliefs all like i'm the best like\ni i own this like\ni'm worthy of everything like of course\nnelson mandela wants to spend time\nwith me like that that's material\nself-worth yeah\nbut it's it's fickle and it's boring and\nit's so\nit has no base to it's basis whereas\nthat feeling of like\nwhen as you said that when i'm with him\nor when i was around him\ni realized how small i was but how big i\ncould be\nthat spiritual self-worth and i think\npeople often\nconfuse humility with weakness\nlow self-esteem like oh well you must\nhave had low self-esteem\nbut it's not it's just the idea that\ni still have to evolve a little bit to\nfeel like and and you know\nto deserve his time and attention yeah\nand because you had that i feel\nyou know you've continued in your way to\nfind the\nand he's still involved in your life i\nthink that's the beauty of it someone\nloves you that much yeah\nthey don't stop like your grandmother\nyeah you don't stop being involved in\nyour life\nabsolutely and i felt every time you've\nspoken about him\nthat you've brought him into my life\njust by speaking about him\nuh and now into everyone else's life\neven more\nand and you know i'm sure you know\nobviously i can't speak on his behalf at\nall but all i can say is that his energy\nis still in your life yeah that's real\nhe lives through it that is real\nyeah it's uh it's beautiful but i want\nto talk about a few more things before i\nlet you go there's i could talk to you\nforever and we do do that\nso i won't do that today um but i wanted\nto talk to you about when you mentioned\nbecause this\ni have i came back to this because this\nwas the initial statement that was like\ni need to get to know will and it was\nwhen you said that you were channeling\nyour inner origin\nyeah yeah and you said that and i was\njust like\nit's just two of my worlds collided i\ngrew up watching freshmen\nevery day i knew every pickup line i\nused every pickup line because of you\nuh i bought the i bought the bad boy sue\nyeah\nyou know for me it's like that was my\nteenage years\ni i watched bad boys for life for the\nseventh time on the way here today to\ndubai\nbecause i thought i wasn't i was like\nit's it's offensive to watch any other\nmovie\nso i've been a big fan for years then i\ngo off be a monk i come back\nand then i'm in the world and then i see\nyou say this and i'm like what\nlike to me it was just it was so it was\nit's just\nand obviously getting to know you yeah\nafter that has made me go okay god had a\nplan and this is\nyou know but but tell me about why arjun\nas a character for you has been because\nyou even and i think this is because of\nyou and your storytelling you even\nbrought arjun in my life more to life so\ntell me a bit about\nwhy arjun was so synonymous with you and\nyou know so the there are\num figures in in\nspiritual texts and uh just\nin general for human beings you know\nbeing creatures of example\nand there's\nyou know for probably for five or six\nyears\nbefore uh arjun\ni i i just was stuck on abraham\ni just loved abraham's life right and i\nwas\nfollowing abraham and on his you know on\nhis deathbed he gets\nup to wash the feet of the guests in his\nhouse\nyou know just stories like that you know\num\njust really stuck with me so then i\nstarted reading\num about arjuna and\nthe circumstance that he was in\num for people that don't know um\nuh arjun is in uh a\na battle his his family has\ntripped out he's a he's a a wonderful\narcher he's the best archer in the world\nand his family trips out and take the\nkingdom and they're like\nyou know they snatch his wife and\nthey're trying to disrobe his wife\nand he's looking like yo what are y'all\njoker's doing\nlike and he comes home and he's like and\nthey seize the kingdom\nand he can't believe\nthat they have done this and\nhe you know he's a warrior and you know\nhe could get he could get the kingdom\nback you know but these are his uncles\nand his\nhis brother's in-laws and his teachers\nand\npeople that he loved and trusted and\nthey\ntook his kingdom and\nthey prepared an army and they're going\nto fight\narjuna and he's he's devastated\nthat his family and his friends and all\nof that\nfor material gain\nwould would do this to him and he's\ndeeply pious\nand they prepare an army the greatest\narmy\nthat's ever been assembled\nexcept that they don't know that god\nis driving arjuna's chariot\nright right and\nthey think they're going to tear through\narjuna they're going to do all of this\nbut\ngod is driving arjuna's chariot\nright and even in that you know\narjuna he's\nhe's like how can me\nkilling all of my family\nbe the right answer\nright and\non the on the other side of that\nhe's like well i'll just let them kill\nme\ni'm not doing that there's no version of\nme going into battle\nwith them i don't care how wrong they\nare i don't care and it's\nand as i just got deeper and deeper into\nthat story it's like i feel like that\nall the time right i feel like\ni'm in um what rather not swami referred\nto\nas a perplexing situation\nalways always right that i feel stuck\nin a perplexing situation with people\ni love where\nthere's not clean answers\nright and i\nalways feel strong enough\nlike if if you if you want to fight\nwe can fight i know how to fight but\ni thought how can that be the right\nthing\nyou know and i just really related\nto um how\nthe gita handles those kinds\nof perplexing situations and recognizing\nthat's what life is\nyou are born into\na perpetual perplexing situation\nand that the the it was\nit was the first time that i'd ever\nheard the spiritual idea like that\nthat life is\na perplexing situation and you're never\ngoing to get around being stuck in the\nduality\nyou have to elevate above the\nthe whole thing you know and the the\nthe christian\nconcept about that that i i always heard\nand never understood fully and my\ngrandmother would say all the time\nyou got to let go and let god yeah right\nyeah\nand it was and it was like that it just\nyou know the\nthe the gita filled in that concept of\nwhat it really means it doesn't mean\ndon't do anything\nyeah yeah let go and let god doesn't\nmean don't do anything it means\ndo your divine duty\n[Music]\nwhatever that may be\nand just for whatever reason the study\nof the gita at this\nparticular point in my my life really\nclarified a lot of ideas of\nhow to move through a world\nwhere you almost\ncan't do it right\nright it's like there's a there's god's\nplaying a practical\njoke right and when you start seeing\nyou know that there's a trick\nin there you know and the the gita\nilluminated that trick for me\nin a way i was like how could i\nbe the biggest movie star in the world\nbe the best at all of this\nand you how you do not love me\nright and you know how was my family\nmiserable\nand it's like that's the trick\nit's the practical joke that's beautiful\nbecause it's it's the perception of the\nright reaction\nyes that's where we get lost is that\nfor us something what going back to what\nyou said at the beginning you were like\nthere's no such thing as a bad\nexperience\nwe're looking at the result of our\nactivity\nabsolutely as a signal of how well we're\nliving\nyes absolutely and that messes us up\nbecause the result of your activities is\nnot under your control\nyes absolutely and so if you're living\nyour life\nbased on the result of your activities\nbeing a signal that you're successful\nright\nyou're setting yourself up to absolutely\nall of us do it all the time\ni was using\num jada's reaction\nto my actions as a measure\nof the quality of my actions yeah\nand one thing has nothing to do with the\nother yeah\nright and that's that's not\nwhat we're taught right\nand you know the the the\nthe concept that someone's reaction\nto your behavior is theirs\nand your behavior is yours\nand when you try to marry the two\nwhen you try to use the\noutcome as a measure\nof the quality of your own being\nyeah that is the kiss of death correct\nthe this the way that this material\nworld works you\ncan do everything right\nand it's still go wrong in terms of\noutcome yeah and you can do everything\nwrong\nand it still goes right in the outcome\nin the outcome\nthe outcome is not connected\nto the quality of your behavior\nand that is such a hard idea\nto you know to digest\nso when i started interacting with\njada and with my family\nas uh what a friend of mine michaela\nmckayla yeah what she refers to as a\nfreestanding man\nright so i am i am certain\nand i am committed to being who i\nam and how i want to be\nwithout a craving for someone's approval\nright because i know their approval\ndoesn't have anything to do with me\nright and you know sometimes we get\nstuck in these situations\nwhere we're seeking the approval of\nsomeone\nfor our self-esteem\nself-esteem is about yourself\nright absolutely but we start looking to\nother people\nfor our self-esteem and\nyou know sometimes we find ourselves\nlooking\nin broken mirrors to get a reflection of\nourselves\nright and the greatest tragedy\nis when you look into a broken mirror to\nsee\nif you're pretty right and you're gonna\nlet that person\ntell you about your inner qualities\nand the greatest tragedy is when you\nlook in a broken mirror\nand you're gonna change your face to try\nto look\ngood in a broken mirror man\nwhoo i'm so glad to be free from that\nthat was fantastic that was yeah that is\nincredible\nand that and that's it that's that's\nthat's literally it yeah\nwhen you can free yourself from that\ncycle yeah yeah and it's and it's a trap\nit's rough\nit's crazy it's it just keeps you there\nand um\nyou know it's but but that's what i\nthink\ni keep seeing in your journey like\nto see you at this stage in your career\nto\nstill be growing still be pushing i mean\nfor people who don't know like i have to\nshare this because it's what i find\nand this is the only time i get to tell\neveryone is uh you know like for me to\nsee you\non set busy like you know i mean\nfor anyone who's never been on set it\ncan be a stressful environment\num you're it's high pressure like you're\nacting you've got to know your lines\nyou've got to interact\nand the sun's going down\n[Laughter]\nwill would literally come back in the\ntrailer and he'd be\nreading in between being on set so\nreading\nspiritual texts spiritual books in\nbetween and i\ni just saw that i was like wow like you\nknow it takes so much\nuh effort and determination and hunger\nto be filling each and every gap with\ngrowth\nand so for anyone who's listening to\nthis podcast while they're driving to\nwork while they're commuting while\nthey're\nediting a video however you're consuming\nthis podcast\ni want you to know like you're doing\nthat same thing you're committing to\ngrow\ncommitting to growth in your gaps when\nyou could just be doing something else\nlike you could have been in your trailer\ni don't know doing what people do in\ntheir trailers i don't know i don't know\nwhat people do in their trailers no\nthat's my past jay\ni don't do that in my trailer no more\ni'm in there by myself now yeah\nover here yeah you know and we would you\nknow and just\ni would see that dedication and i think\nif\nyou know to find time in between when\nyou're filming a movie and it's\nyou know big budgets and all this\neverything and your your\nyour focus was here yeah yeah\nyour focus was here even in amongst all\nof that that was\ntruly inspirational and uh you know that\nthat behind the scenes\nlook at your your internal journey is\nhas had such a big impact on my life\nit's it's a no excuses\nyeah it's the only thing to do right so\nand that's to learn right\nto we have to free ourselves\nfrom the the darkness of our own\nignorance and\nthe you wouldn't call some up something\na problem\nif you understood it the problem is you\ndon't understand it\nright that's why you're calling it a\nproblem right\nyou don't you don't call things problems\nthat you have complete comprehension of\nright so the the the the process of\nfreeing yourself from the pain\nand the misery of your difficulties and\nyour problems is in\nyou know constantly cultivating a\nbroader comprehension\nof the deeper\nabsolute truth of what's actually\nhappening\nright and one of the things that i\nlearned\nis that if i feel bad\num if i'm unhappy if i'm upset\nif i'm disrupted or disturbed\nthe only thing that could do that is my\nignorance\nthat's the only thing that\ncreates misery\nis you you you slip\ninto a sort of hopelessness\nof not being able to figure it out you\nknow\nand i just you know for me\nit's i've gotten to the to the place\nthat\nlife is school right\nyou know you're not getting the\npromotion you want\nat work that's school get it\nfigure it out you know someone in your\nfamily is sick\nthat's school that's like life\nis the greatest teacher there is you\njust have to be\nwilling to learn and recognizing that\nyour pain and your suffering\nis the thing that the universe is poking\nat so you recognize that's where you're\nignorant\nyeah you know you're you're\nyou wouldn't be having those struggles\nin those\nareas if you had a deep\num broad\ncomprehension of the fundamental\nrealities of those\nsituations yeah it's\nso beautifully said again it's i well as\ni was listening to you i was thinking\nabout how\nwe're programmed to believe that life is\nfor enjoyment\nright but actually it's for education\nfor education yes\nand we keep seeking enjoyment in the\neducation\nyes so we're trying we think we're in a\ncandy shop yeah but we're in a classroom\ni call that the poisoned honey scenario\nright you're you're seeking enjoyment\nyou want something sweet\nand you don't recognize that that\nhoney's poisoned\nright it's gonna be sweet going down but\nit's\nyou know the the kickback on that thing\nis something terrible\nyeah and we see that we see that\nin you know what you're creating now\nand i remember we talked about how you\nwere amazing as the genie and you were\nsaying how\nyou felt you got to be so much of you\nand in the character but\neven with the release of a mend that\njust came out\nlike i i feel like we've talked about\nthis concept before and you brought it\nup you were like you know the sacred\nclown\nyeah has always been the emblem and the\nsymbol\nand and again it's a it's god's gift\nwhere you get to\nentertain make people laugh but you want\nto help people grow through that\nabsolutely and and that's\nreally hard to do but you do that's you\nthat's who you are\nand tell us about how that's now coming\nthrough in the work you're doing like\nhow you've actually brought this into\nreality because\nsometimes it can feel very heady yeah\nyeah but you've really been working hard\non\ntaking it out of the head into the heart\nand into the world yeah\nyeah and that was that that was one of\nthe things about um\nuh aladdin aladdin that was so defining\nfor me you know and that that concept of\nthe sacred clown\ni had written that down in one of my\nbooks you know five or six\nyears ago and it's like\num\nat my core that's\neither who i am or who i want to be but\nit's in there it's it's\nit's in there really deep and in playing\nthe genie it was like\nthat i was at home right that\ncombination\nof fun light\nsilliness and\nthe imparting wisdom\nto to aladdin right i was like that\nthat's who i want to be in the world i\nwant to be\nsinging and dancing and being silly and\nplaying and all of that\nand then sneaking the ideas in you know\nunder the joy um\nbut i had i had uh heard that i think\nwas the the\nthe lakota indians or something like\nthat the native americans yeah\nthey had the image of the the the sacred\nclown which is often considered negative\nyeah right yeah yeah but it's like i i\ni connected to it it's like oh that's\nright that's what\nthat's what the singing and dancing and\nall of the joy and all of the smiling\nand all of that\nis for it's a it's a\njust a beautiful conduit for\nthe the ideas and um\nyou know that's just that that's\njust at my core that's i'm i'm happiest\nin that space yeah\nbeautiful well i could talk to you for\nhours and we will\ni'm sure we might i'm gonna let you i'm\ngonna ask you what i call the final five\nthese are one-word answers\none word one word to one sentence the\nphosphide\nokay fast-forward smith these are your\nfast five the first is what is the best\nadvice you've ever received\nthe best advice i've ever\nreceived um\nthe first day i got on uh the tour bus\nwhen\nwe were leaving for the first time\nleaving philly me and jeff and all our\nsquad\nand the the last thing my grandmother\nsaid as the door was closing\nshe said uh and she called me lover boy\nshe she said uh she said hey lover boy\nremember\nbe nice to everybody you pass on your\nway up\nbecause you just might have to pass them\nagain on your way down\nand i was like and that that that always\nstuck with me\ni love that that's great all right\nsecond question what's the worst advice\nyou ever received\nthe worst advice\nmy boy charlie mack charlie mack told me\nhe said hey man listen listen listen the\nway you make a woman love you to make a\nwoman love you\nyou take out the dinner you know and\nthen as you're going out to place\nyou just knock somebody out cause a\nwoman got to know you could defend her\nyou just knock somebody out\nand if you knock if you knock out you\ncan be a stranger but you just\nyou just knock somebody out and she see\nyour strength and that's how she'll feel\nconfident and\nit changes everything it changes your\nsexual life it just changed everything\nabout it\nbut you you gotta get them good and just\nknock somebody out\ndid you try it yeah no i never know i've\nnever tried it\noh that's brilliant i love that oh man\nif you'd if you would have tried it yeah\nno i never tried that well i kind of\nkind of felt that that was bad advice in\nthe moment third question\nuh i have to ask you about all three uh\nno two of them uh\none thing you learned learned from\nobserving the life of julius irving\nand muhammad ali wow wow so\nso julia serving because like the man\nwent right right in the heart of my\nchildhood the\n76 zeus won the the\nchampionship in 1983\nin a four-game sweep of the lakers it\nwas\nheaven and\nuh you know dr j was in\neverything in philly um and i would say\nthe the the single thing\nwith doc is he was\nhe was always dignified\nno matter what somebody said no matter\nwhat somebody did\nhe got in one fight in his entire\nnba career but the idea that he was\njust perfectly still and\nuh he was an exquisite well-spoken\ngentleman and and and that was the thing\nuh he was a killer on the court\nbut you know he was he was he was just\nexquisitely elegant\nand peaceful while at the same time\ndoing the thing and that balance of\nthose two things i always thought was\nspectacular\ni love that that's beautiful yeah oh you\nsaid it yeah yeah\num cause you guys spent so much time\nthere's some great interviews between us\nali was hilarious one of the things um\nyou know so ali would just\ncome to set he would walk around he\nwould walk away\nand just get on a bus we said yo where's\nthe champ\nand he would get on a bus and just ride\na city bus\nand just ride with people no idea where\nthe bus is going nothing no security\nanything like that right and he was\nengaged\nwith you know people in a way i had\nnever seen\nanybody like as famous as\nhe was he he engaged with people\nin that way and\ni would say the\ntotal and utter submission\nto god right and\nhe would he he looked\nlike he was arrogant but it was\nit was the other way it was like he was\ntalking like that and\nacting like that because he was so\nutterly submissive to\nthe the will of god and that\nthat combination uh it just really\ninspired me with how i wanted to be with\npeople in the world and i asked millie\nchan why do you\nyou just walk away with people like that\nand you know\nyou know he said oh man you got to let\nthese people see you\nhe said they they ain't never seen\nnothing like you before\nyou got you got to get out there and you\ngot to touch them so they know you real\npeople can't aspire to stuff that they\ndon't think is real\nyou know you know and it was like he was\njust\nso in tune with what he was\nyou know and he he that the\nthe seemingly arrogant humility\nwas was a beautiful combination i love\nthat\nall right question number four uh\nwhat's the biggest lesson you've learned\nin the last 12 months\nin the last 12 months i would say the\nthe\nit's that um\nignorance and evil\num are twins\nhmm say look you look at you look at\nthem\nand they look they look just alike\num except that ignorance\ncan be educated and\nevil is a much more\ndifficult problem um\nand i would say i learned\nfortunately that ignorance\nis much more prevalent\nfinal question if you could create one\nlaw in the world\nthat everyone had to follow what would\nit be\none law that everyone had to follow\num\nit would be that you have to repeat\nback what you heard the other person say\nbefore you're allowed to say what you\nthink\nthat the the law is you're not allowed\nto respond\nto what someone said until you repeat\nback what you heard and the person has\nmultiple opportunities no no no that's\nnot i didn't that's not what i meant and\nuntil you\nrepeat back accurately what the person\nsaid\nyou don't get to talk that is a great\nlaw\ni love that principle it helps in every\nevery year because we\nour minds go way off the deep end with\nwhat we heard somebody say and our\nresponse\nwell first of all we're not really\nlistening because we want to\nwe already know what we want to say no\nmatter what they say and\nand we go really way off the deep end\ni was shocked and surprised\nby how far we can be\nfrom what someone actually said to what\nwe heard absolutely\nabsolutely yes that broken mirror yes\nexactly yeah i love that will is there\nanything i haven't\nlet you share or something in your heart\nright now that you like i have to say\nthis\nand you want to share it it doesn't have\nto be but\nuh no not really just and that idea\nthere was\nsomething that popped in while you were\nsaying it um that's called the broken\ncalculator\nright so and it's about you know human\ninteracting and the the\nthe the ego can sometimes be a broken\ncalculator\nin that imagine the seven is stuck down\nso every equation you punch in is seven\nequals seven equals seven equals seven\nequals seven right so no matter what you\nsay\nto a person if they've experienced a\ntrauma yeah and in their trauma you know\num men ain't\nmen ain't so that's the broken\nseven so no matter what you say\nno matter how you behave it keeps coming\nup man ain't\nand getting our seven unstuck\nis a really critical part of\nbeing able to interact with other human\nbeings\nbecause we're we're painting\nuh on everything we hear them say we're\nadding\nour stuck seven to\neverything they say and you just can't\nget\nthe the equation to come out correctly\nif your calculator is broken\ni love that analogy that's awesome i\nnever heard that before i love that yeah\nif everyone who goes away listening to\nthis interview the one thing you\nremember is that\nyeah what what is that broken calculator\nwhat's that number\nthe calculator or whatever that is the\nequation and you're gonna make it be\nthat no matter what is in front of you\nyour equations coming up\nwith your broken number yeah\nif you want even more videos just
