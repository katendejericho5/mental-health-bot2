    "transcript": "so a conversation of like oh you know\nwhat happened on netflix last night\nwe predicted that we'll feel more\ncomfortable we'll enjoy it more\nbut a conversation where you're like hey\nwhen's the last time you cried\nor you know what's something that you\nfeel really guilty about in your life or\nwhat's a thing that like you don't admit\nto people but you're really grateful for\nlike those aren't the conversation\nstarters we use at the beach party\nbut we should be because those are the\nones that both make us feel better make\nus feel more connected\nand drive the kind of deep friendships\nthat we really need\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou i just wanted to say\ni've been noticing that so many of you\nhave been sharing the insights\nthe nuggets of wisdom on instagram on\ntwitter on facebook and i'm so grateful\ni love scanning through and seeing what\nyou're noticing\nwhat you're practicing what you're\nexperimenting with so keep that going\nand thank you all so much for the\nincredible\nreviews i actually read through them\npersonally and it warms my heart to see\nthe incredible impact that some of my\nguests\nand some of my solo episodes have had in\nyour life so thank you so much for\nsharing those those are not unnoticed\ni recognize each and every one of them\nas much as i can and i wish i could\npersonally write to each and every one\nof you and say thank you so i'm saying\nthat\nright now and today's guest is someone\nthat i'm so excited to introduce to you\ni've been following her for an extremely\nlong time and\ni'm currently this week at the west\ncreek ranch at the arthur\nm blank family foundation and we're\ntalking about the state of well-being\nin america and this lady\nis absolutely phenomenal if you've not\nseen her work yet you're in for a real\ntreat\nbut she's a psychologist an expert in\nhuman behavior\nand she actually teaches the most\npopular class\nat yale of all time which is an\nincredible achievement in and of itself\nand so you're going to get to be a part\nof that class today so you can pretend\nthat you're at yale right now as you're\nlistening whether you're\nin your car walking your dog at the gym\nor wherever else you are\nand her name is laurie santos laurie\nthank you for being here thanks so much\nfor having me\nyeah i heard you speak the other day and\ni was just like\nmy audience is going to love you and\ngoing to learn so much from you i sat\nthere and\ni felt so much reassurance and\nconfidence that what i was sharing with\nmy audience\nwas true based on your years of research\nbased on all your hard work\nand today i can't wait for my audience\nto fall more in love with you\nand learn more about you because i think\nthe work that you're doing and more\nimportantly the way you do it\nis so graceful and so impactful i i just\nwant to point this out to anyone i've\nspent only a couple of days with lauren\nwe've only\nexchanged a few moments but the\nbeautiful thing is when someone's\nteaching well-being you're hoping that\nthey live it and when i met laurie she's\njust really sweet\nreally graceful really kind and and i\nlove seeing that more than anything but\nthank you for being here thanks so much\nthis is great\nyeah so lori tell me how you even came\nto this point because you've been at\nyale for 16 years\nyeah i've been teaching at yale for 16\nyears and most of the time i was just a\nprofessor at the front of the classroom\nyou know i saw the students but kind of\nfrom a distance\nbut just in the last two years i\nswitched i became\none of the heads of college at yale so\nit's worth yale's kind of a weird place\nit's like hogwarts it's got the kind of\ncolleges\nwithin a college you know your\ngryffindor slytherin kind of thing who\nare you i'm well we're silliman which\nsounds like slytherin but\ntotally no no no no no connection\nwhatsoever\num but but that gave me a completely new\nperspective i'm hanging out with\nstudents i live with them on campus i\nlive with them in their courtyard\nand i hang out with them directly and i\nstarted just seeing how miserable\ncollege students were you know just the\nlevels of depression the levels of\neven things like suicidal ideation and\njust like the general like trying to\nfast forward their life you know you ask\nstudents how it's going it's like i\ncan't\nwait to get to end of the week i can't\nwait to get to end of the semester and i\nwas like\nthey're missing it you know this is the\none time you're going to be at college\nwith your friends and\nand i was just really sad about it and\nso uh one could be depressed by all\nthose kind of sad statistics but instead\ni was kind of inspired because i\ni know all this work in positive\npsychology i'm a practicing\npsychology professor and i'm like there\nare answers here you can do better\nand so i just decided to teach students\nall these insights i'm like let me just\ndevelop a totally new course for yale\nkids where i teach them\nall the stuff you've been teaching your\npodcast listeners right like just how to\ndo a little bit better\nsome of these misconceptions about\nhappiness and and the practices you can\nput into\nyour life to do better and so i put the\ncourse together\nit was a completely new class i didn't\nknow what was going to happen i figured\nyou know 30 or 40 kids would take it\num i was completely shocked when around\n1200 students at yale wanted to take it\nand this is one\nout of every four students at yale who\nwanted to be in this classroom and learn\nthat's insane\nhow many people is that it's around\ntwelve hundred um which didn't really\nfit in any classroom you know most\nclassrooms like 100 people so we were\noff by an order of magnitude\nwe ended up at first teaching the class\nin a church which i thought was really\nbeautiful and kind of telling\num and then we moved to a concert hall\nwhich i think has different symbolism\nbut uh we eventually found a place to\nfit everybody\nand then you know the class went through\nbut one feature of the class that i\nthink was important and a little bit\ndifferent from a typical\ncollege class is in addition to hearing\nabout all this scientific work you know\nall the studies on happiness\nwe also force students to practice those\nhabits like just like in the syllabus\nyou'd have a quiz every week\nin the syllabus every week you'd\nmeditate once a week or you'd exercise\nor sleep more like all these practices\nscience tells us\nmatter a lot we'd prescribe those to\nstudents who had to do them\nand they were in this course where 1200\nof their peers were doing the same thing\nyou know so you'd kind of feel like a\nloser on exercise week if you didn't get\nup and do your cardio and so it was a\nwonderful social support\nsystem for students um so yeah so that's\nthe story of the class\num i didn't expect it to go crazy but\nyou know as you've seen and all your\nlisteners know there's a real hunger for\nthis stuff people feel\nlike they're not flourishing enough and\nthey really want some answers\nabsolutely and i love that you were able\nto create this yourself\ni know you were saying that you\nestimated that 30 or 40 people would do\nit\nwell that was your idea and then you\nhave 1 200 people doing it\nwhich is amazing just to show how much\ndemand there is tell me about what your\ncollege experience was like when you\nwere at college yourself\nwere you one of those students who\nstruggled with optimism or have you\nalways been this way\nyeah i think i mean my college\nexperience was so different than the\ncurrent experience of so many of my\nstudents i think you know i had the\nsense that i worked hard in high school\nbut once i got to college i'm like now's\nthe time to reap the benefits you know\ni've kind of hit the finish line like\nlet me soak in all the good stuff\nand i had you know a tight friend group\nand did the things i loved\ni wasn't overwhelmed i had lots of time\nfree and this is exactly the opposite of\nwhat i'm seeing in my students i'm\nseeing these students who\nare just overwhelmed by all their\ncommitments they have they're completely\ntime-famished\nthey don't necessarily have a strong\nfriend group because they haven't taken\ntime to to develop that\nthey don't put time into it they're just\nkind of too busy and they seem to be\nreally lonely and just kind of\nyou know trying to get through things to\nget through them and kind of triaging\nthis this wonderful experience so\nyeah my experience was completely\ndifferent yeah absolutely and\none of the things i know you said about\nthis course tell us the name again\nuh the course is called psychology and\nthe good life which we kind of\nwe called it that to sort of sound a\nlittle sexy we want it to pop from and\nit worked\nand it worked yeah and it worked maybe\ntwo what are the other classes what are\nthe other classes like\nyou know like intro to psychology or you\nknow they sound kind of boring so i\nthink students saw the good life and\nthey're like oh this is the kind of\nthing\nand and for anyone you won't get if\nyou're watching this then you'll be able\nto see lori but if you're not and you're\njust listening laurie also drops in a\nlot of drake references\nand treat yourself references and all\nthese other things so\nyeah we the class was filled with a lot\nof memes actually that was a really fun\nthing that happened in the class was\nbecause so many students were taking it\nuh the class and the content of the\nclass really took over the school's\nkind of culture right so it took over\nthe school's meme page yeah like imagine\nlike most schools has a kind of meme\npage\nand so all the memes for the whole\nsemester were about things like\ngratitude and taking time off and\nmeditation and it was like you know\nwe went from like the normal memes to\nfull wholesome memes all the time which\nis fantastic\nlet's dive deeply into some of those\npractices\nthat you were teaching both from a\nscience perspective and a practical\nperspective\nand i love both and i try and do the\nsame whenever i'm doing the podcast\nbecause\ni love knowing and i was saying this to\nyou yesterday when i lived as a monk and\ni was studying\nspiritual texts that were 5 000 years\nold all i ever did was sit down with\nthem\nand then look at behavioral science and\ntry and find the parallels and i love\nseeing that because there's a beautiful\nstatement from martin luther king where\nhe said\nif you want a new idea read an old book\nand and i love that statement because\nthat's what i found that so many of\nthese ideas that are now becoming more\npopular\nare resurfacing are actually have been a\npart of\nthe happiness of society for thousands\nof years\nin pockets that have just got smaller\nand smaller so i'd love to hear from you\ntell me about\neach of those but let's start with the\nscience and then switch to the practical\nhow\nyou were able to actually get them\npracticing in exercising all these\nthings\nyeah one of the biggest pieces of\nscience that we teach students at the\nstart is that\nour minds are kind of sucky like they\nkind of lie to us a lot of the time\nwhich is\na weird thing to realize that your mind\nmight be giving you intuitions that are\nincorrect\nbut you know if you've been on social\nmedia you've seen this like probably\nsome of your guests have seen the\nlaurel yani audio track or the dress\nwhich looks different\nblue and white dress yeah blue and white\nso we see these visual illusions which\nmeans our mind is telling us the wrong\nvisual information our mind also tells\nus the wrong motivational information\nit causes us to seek out stuff that we\nthink is going to make us really happy\nand it doesn't work in the way we think\nthink salary right you know if you're\nliving below the poverty line\nyes it's definitely the case that if you\nimprove your income you're going to feel\na little bit better you're going to have\nless stress and so on\nbut for most folks have a roof over\ntheir head you know reasonable middle\nclass job\njust getting that christmas bonus isn't\ngoing to work that's not what our mind\ntells us we seek out more\nsalary more money more material goods\nbut those things just don't work\nmy college students a big thing i see is\nthey are seeking out grades\nyou know they think the perfect grade\nwhich gives them the perfect job like\nthat's the way to well being in life\nbut it turns out the science suggests\nthere is a correlation between grades\nand happiness\nbut it's a negative correlation what\ndoes that mean that means as your grades\ngo up\nyou're more and more likely to be less\nhappy it's not all we think but it's\nwhat the data suggests so so we're going\nabout it all wrong\nthe next thing i teach is that this is\nwhere you need the science because\nif our intuitions are wrong who do we\nbelieve right we can go to the ancient\nthinkers\nand we can go to the behavioral science\nand the good news is as you said those\nlink up way more than we expect\nwhat seems to matter scientifically for\nwell-being the top thing is social\nconnection\nlike you can pull out any happy person\nand you'll find that those folks\ntend to have lots of social connections\nand they just tend to spend lots of time\nwith people\nthis is the thing that's tragic for me\nwith my yale students because\nwhat's the opportunity cost when you're\nfocusing on grades you don't have time\nto hang out with anyone you don't have\ntime to make friends\nyou know what's your opportunity cost if\nyou care about salary and you're putting\nin tons of hours at work\nyou don't see your family you know you\ndon't get to hang out with your pals so\ni think that's a huge one yeah let's\ndive let's start yeah die deep yes\ni think they're fascinating so i love\nthat point you're making about how\nwhat we expect to make us happy doesn't\nactually work\nand there's that fantastic statement\nfrom jim carrey where he said that we\nshould\ni wish that everyone would become rich\nfamous and get everything they ever\nwanted just to realize it's not the\npoint\nand and it's fascinating that we\nactually trick our minds so\nin the vedic teachings that was called\nthe four defects of the mind and there\nwere four defects that were explained\nto show how everything from visual to\nmental\nstimuluses can actually drive us wrong\nso you specifically said there that\nactually we believe that an\nincrease in wealth despite the poverty\nline example you gave\nan increase in wealth actually doesn't\ncorrelate\nis there a space that does correlate\nwith a certain amount of happiness is\nthere a\nexact number or salary per year or\nanything that does correlate\nyeah it gets really tricky but there's\nsome numbers that are floating around\nout there actually one study by danny\nkahneman and angus dean\ntwo different nobel prize winning\neconomists right so they should get it\nright\num they grabbed all these different\nwell-being measures how stressed you\nwere how happy you were and so on\nand they tried to plot that against your\nincome and what they find at least in\nthe u.s is that lower income so if\nyou're earning\nten thousand dollars or something like\nthat if you get more money you'll\nincrease on all those well-being\nmeasures so you'll be less stressed\nyou'll be happier and so on\nbut in the u.s they find that that bump\nup for salary\ndrops off it kind of flatlines at a\ncertain point and the flat line is at\naround\n75k in the us right now what does that\nmean that means if you're earning 75 000\nright now in the u.s even if i quadruple\nyour salary\nyou're not going to see one tiny\nincrease in your happiness levels\nwhether it be in terms of your stress\nyour positive emotion and so on now this\nis not what we think i bet there's folks\nwho are earning 75k out there who play\nthe lottery thinking you know if i could\nonly get 16 million i'd be happier\nand that's just wrong wow amazing okay\nand then the other one was the grades\none which fascinated me even more\nbecause\nis that more linked to ambition and\nsuccess and achievement or is it\nspecifically linked to grades\ni think folks this is one that folks\nhaven't dug as deep into is really\nlinked to grades it seems like\ngrades higher grades are correlated with\nlower well-being\nalso correlated with lower optimism\nlevels and lower self-esteem\nagain not what we think but that's what\nthe data suggests the causal reason for\nthat one is trickier i think we have\nless data but my guess is again it's\nbased on opportunity cost you know if\nyou're freaking out about your grades\nyou're not hanging out with your friends\nyou're not taking time to just be and be\npresent\nyou're focused on this external reward\nthat even once you get it is going to be\nit's going to go away you're not focused\nat all on the journey\nand so focusing on grades is at a cost\nof focusing on all the good stuff that\nreally does matter\nyeah especially i think when you could\nalso be working hard for a grade that\nyou don't even care about\ni feel like if there's more meaning from\nfrom anything i've seen i remember i was\nreading\nuh the upside of stress by kelly\nmcgonagall and she was talking about how\nactually\nwhen we're doing something meaningful we\ncan take on more stress\nyeah and we can deal with more pain when\nwe feel connected or omission or meaning\nand so i feel like sometimes grades\ndon't make us happy when\nthey are and i loved what you pointed\nout there about the journey and and\nthat's what i've seen in my life as well\nis that\ni get these beautiful moments and and i\nknow you've had them too in in your work\nof like\ngetting onto the today show or being\ninterviewed by ellen degeneres or any of\nthose things that have happened for me\nand\nand i'm always saying to people like no\nbut it's the journey that i'm in love\nwith\nand those are beautiful almost mild\nwhat do i call it what are they called\nmilestones they're beautiful milestones\nalong the journey\nbut they just pinpoint the external\njourney but the internal journey of\nwaking up every day and doing what i\nlove is\nfar more fascinating yeah i mean i think\nthis is what i see in the students all\nthe time i think the students who are\nstudying these things because they want\nto learn more right they want to grow in\ntheir understanding they have some\npurpose in doing it you know they want\nto be a doctor or something like that\nthose are the students who don't fall\nprey to this kind of thing but the\nstudents who are just obsessed with the\na because it has to be a a\nyeah they get there and they get the a\nand they immediately get anxious for the\nnext step because you know now i've\ngotten straight a's for like three\nsemesters you know now it's gonna be\nfour\nnext and so i think we we put in these\nkinds of accolades like\nthe the this the idea that they're going\nto just make us\nhappy like for all time right we think\nthese accolades are just going to bring\nus the well-being we've been craving\nbut when we put all our eggs in that\nkind of external reward basket and we\nget there and we're like\nokay now what it's just on to the next\nthing yeah you have to\npay attention to the journey there has\nto be some purpose there i love that and\nand i think that's so indicative of just\nit's okay to get good grades it's good\nto get good grades but with the intent\nof\nyou're getting them in something\nmeaningful that's purposeful to you\nthat's useful\nand not believing that the grade in and\nof itself will provide you happiness\nthat's right so i love that\nyeah in fact the grades if you just\nfocus on the grades in and of themselves\nthen you kind of get off track it's not\nabout learning anymore it's about the\ngrade\nso what does that do there's research\nsuggesting kids who are focused on\ngrades are more likely to cheat\nwhy because they don't care about\nlearning it they just want to get a\ngrade um kids who are more focused on\ngrades don't like the learning as much\nright because the learning is kind of\nscary right it's this outcome that could\nmake or break your opinion of yourself\nright\nand kids who are focused on grades\nactually end up hating learning over\ntime\nso the kids with the best grades\nsometimes have the least enjoyment of\nschool so the kids\nwere doing the best like school the\nleast which doesn't make any sense but\nno absolutely that's crazy and you\nbrought about this point of social\nconnection\nwhich which i really appreciate and i\ntotally see the value in\nthe biggest challenge i see today and at\nmoments in my life which i'm very aware\nof as well is\nthat you can be surrounded by people and\nstill feel lonely\nand i think one of the people that made\nus most aware of that was robin williams\nwhen robin williams passed away\nhe spoke so often about and it was just\nthere hidden in\nmessages that we didn't notice until he\nwasn't here with us anymore\nbut this message around how you could\nactually be around lots of people and\nstill feel lonely\ntell me tell us about what true social\nconnection is\nbecause i think sometimes we mistake it\nfor being at the coolest party\nor being out with everyone at the beach\nand i don't think that's what you're\ntrying to say\nyeah i think i think we mess up social\nconnection all the time you know\ni see this so tragically just in my own\ncollege at yale where\nyou know walk into the dining hall and\nstudents will be you know quote unquote\nconnecting they'll all be on their\nphones you know\nscrolling through likes and texting\nsomeone but they have these you know big\nbose headphones on and they're not\nconnecting with the other humans that\nare there with them like real social\nconnection\nis about like real connection it's\ntalking to like people\nlive in the flesh or at least people in\nreal time like you know talking to your\nfamily on facetime or something like\nthat\nand i think it's not about being around\nlots of people it's like deeply\nconnecting with other folks\nanother spot where our mind lies to us\nis we think that it'd be more fun to\nkind of connect really shallowly\nyou know go to the party and just like\nyou know talk about the weather or talk\nabout something stupid\nbut the research suggests that like\nactually having these deep meaningful\nconversations ones where you're\nvulnerable\nthose are the ones that really increase\nwell-being so a conversation of like oh\nyou know what happened on netflix last\nnight\nwe predicted that we'll feel more\ncomfortable we'll enjoy it more\nbut a conversation where you're like hey\nwhen's the last time you cried\nor you know what's something that you\nfeel really guilty about in your life or\nwhat's a thing that like you don't admit\nto people but you're really grateful for\nlike those aren't the conversation\nstarters we use at the beach party\nbut we should be because those are the\nones that both make us feel better make\nus feel more connected\nand drive the kind of deep friendships\nthat we really need i love that that is\nsuch practical advice\nand i think it's so powerful because\nwhen i first started making videos\nmy belief was that people had meaningful\nconversations\nbut not often enough and\nin very small circles and my hypothesis\nwas if i could make videos\nthat would spark a conversation and give\npeople thought-provoking discussions to\nhave\naround meaningful life then we could\ntest whether people actually cared\nand what i shared yesterday showed that\npeople do people do want to have\nmeaningful conversations\nand it does feel and i know you\naddressed this really well and i'm glad\nyou did that\nin the beginning a lot of your students\nwere like oh that's cheesy or that's\ncliche or that's so\nwhat was the other word you used awkward\nemo emo yeah right like\nthat's so emo or that's so awkward and\noh that's like that soft stuff\nand how have you seen that change tell\nme about some of those stories in which\nyou saw people say that\nbut actually you saw these\ntransformations because i think what\nyou're encouraging people to do and\nyou're so right we think talking about\nthat show\nor that sports game is where that social\nconnection comes from but you're you're\ntotally right it's totally beyond that\nso give us some of those examples\nyeah the sad thing is they're not\nthey're not lots of examples where\npeople\nget it and i think that comes from a\nreally dumb feature of our mind which is\nlike\nour mind is like biased but even knowing\nabout those biases doesn't make them go\naway\nand so my favorite recent example you\nknow we're here at this wonderful\nuh ranch at the art of the bank\nfoundation that's funding this wonderful\nhappiness summit\nand they have a lot of these exercises\nthat are evidence-based and last night\nat dinner\nthey gave us these deep conversation\ncards like at dinner have these deep\nconversations\nand a whole room of experts some of whom\nknow this data\nreally well we're like this is awkward\nlike do we really have to do this\nand then the person was like no you\nreally have to do it and then we were\ntalking about things you know hard\nquestions like you know\nwho are you closer with your mother or\nyour father or you had one thing you\nregret about\ndealing with your family what would that\nbe like you know i'm talking with these\nother scientists about those deep\nquestions\nand even i had the intuition of like\nthis is going to be weird i don't want\nto talk with these folks\nbut by the end we were literally hugging\nand high-fiving\nand it just kind of came together and so\ni think this\nthis is a hard thing even for folks who\nlisten to your podcast and have been\nlearning all these insights\nit's like even if you know the insights\nsometimes they still don't start feeling\nintuitive\nyou still have to kind of like no i know\nthis doesn't feel right but like i'm\ngoing to do it anyway\nand i think there can be really power to\nthat once you understand the deep wisdom\nonce you understand the ancient stuff\nand the behavioral science\nthat gives you clues about what to do it\ndoesn't always feel intuitive\nbut as you do it more and more you're\nlike oh this is going to work this is\ngoing to feel good\nabsolutely and you were telling me that\nsome of the students actually\nafter being grateful or after doing the\nexercises that you set out\nactually had moments where they they did\nrealize the value they had the insight\nyeah\ni mean it it it's always in the context\nof like i didn't believe you\nbut i did it anyway and it worked one of\nmy favorite ones another thing we\nprescribe\nuh are these healthy practices simple\nthings like sleep which we know can\nimprove mental health\nuh and i had one student in my college\nwho was you know it was midterm season\nwhich is a time when no students are\nsleeping they're all kind of staying up\nand studying and he said\nyou know like professor santos this year\nfor the first time i decided i was gonna\nfollow your advice and i was gonna get\neight hours of sleep for every midterm\nand the whole time i was just completely\nfreaked out that i was not going to\nstudy enough and\ni get the best grades this semester that\ni've ever gotten oh wow\nand i was like were you going to do it\nfor the finals and he's like well maybe\nso it doesn't always translate but i\nthink yeah i mean i think people get\nthese insights where you start realizing\nyou know the old way wasn't working\nright and so you start doing you're like\nwait this feels better\nyes and i think it's so important that\nwhen we do have that moment\nwe write down what those patterns are\nbecause\ni remember when i was at college\nuniversity as we call it in england\nevery year when i do well and then it\nwould get to the next year and i'd be\nlike\nhow did i get do well last year and i'd\nand then i'd be trying to\nfigure out what i did last year that\nworked well yeah and then after a while\ni just started to write things down\nand so i know that i'm most impactful\nbetween 10 a.m to 3 p.m\nand that's when i do most my creative\nwork in the day i know things like i\ndon't like revising or studying late at\nnight\nbecause that actually gives me anxiety\nand stress and pressure and so i barely\nwork\nat night in a in a creative way or a\ndiligent way\ni also know that i like more breaks now\nand one of my favorite things that i'm\npracticing a lot right now is single\ntasking is\ni don't like doing multiple different\nactivities\nin the same day i'd rather have a day\nwhere all i do is record podcasts\nand then have another day is all i do is\nwrite scripts then live a life from\ndoing all of it at the same time and i\nsee when i\ndo mix it too much because my life gets\ncrazy i start to see myself becoming\nless effective less creative less\nproductive\nand and so for me i think that's such a\nvaluable point tell me about the study\nyou talked about when uh\nstudents were on the train oh sorry\npeople were on the train and talking to\nstrangers i thought that was fascinating\nand\nanother spot another spot where we get\nthings wrong is like\nwe just don't think that talking to\npeople will feel good\ni think that's especially true in the\nmodern day especially true in cities\nright i have trouble like you know\nstriking up a conversation with somebody\non the train and so on but the data\nsuggests i'm going about it all wrong\nthis is some lovely work by the\npsychologist nick eppley where he did\nthis crazy study he just walked up to\npeople\non the l train in chicago her commuting\nto work said do you want to be in a\nstudy he offered them a 10\nstarbucks gift card which turns out is\nthe engine of all of scientific research\nbecause people say yes i want to get\nthis 10\nstar wars gift card he said great you\ncan have the 10 starbucks gift card but\nfor the rest of the train ride\nyou have to pick a random stranger and\ntalk to them and don't don't just talk\nlike\ndo that exercise really trying to make a\nsocial connection\num that was one group the other group\njust was told you know be silent on the\ntrain don't talk to anybody or a kind of\ncontrol group we're just told do\nwhatever you want\nhe also had people predict and so people\npredict\nprobably what a lot of your listeners\nare predicting when you think about\nbeing on some commuter train and picking\na complete stranger and just walking up\nto them and trying to connect really\ndeeply awkward emo\nlike this is going to suck right and\npeople actually predict their positivity\nand they think\ntheir positivity is going to drop like\npretty drastically\nthat's what they predict but what really\nhappens is just the opposite\nit's the solitude condition where you're\nnot talking to anybody that's what makes\nyou feel yucky\nthe connection condition boosts people's\npositivity\nuh for long ranges the other thing he\nfinds is like that's true for introverts\nand extroverts true\nthe only difference between introverts\nand extroverts is that introverts\noverpredict it's going to feel really\nawful\nbut they get the same basic benefit when\nthey actually engage in connection\nyeah that's insane yeah and i'm\nrecommending everyone listening right\nnow\ni want you to try it out yeah they have\nto take their headphones out on the\ntrain right now and just like pause\npause the podcast talk to somebody for\nfive minutes and then see yeah and make\nsure you come back to the podcast yeah\nyeah no like literally just try out\nwhether you're on the train or whether\nyou're walking down the street or\nwhatever it is just try and do that more\nif you're at a coffee shop and\nthere's other people there and you're\nalone and they're alone give it a go\nyeah and i know it i mean i know what\nyour listeners are thinking because i\nthought the same thing when i heard this\nstudy like\nmaybe for other people but not for me\nand and this is\ni think this is the thing i still\nstruggle with you know as a person that\nteaches\nyou know the happy class at yale you\nknow these intuitions don't come easy\nfor me too\ni remember with this particular study a\nvery embarrassing thing so i was on a\nflight to california\nuh you know like long six-hour flight\nand i'm not taking my own advice i\nhadn't actually struck up a conversation\nwith the person\nwho's sitting next to me and i get an\nemail from one of my former students\nwho is saying that you know she like was\ntrying to follow the advice and she's\ndoing this more and she was on a flight\nwhere she started talking to the person\nnext to her it was a really long flight\nand\nthis amazing conversation and at the end\nof the flight\nthe guy who was sitting next to her was\nlike you know this was the first time\nfor me the first time i talked to\nsomebody but i took this\nclass by laurie santos and you know they\ntaught\nshe taught me to talk to someone and it\ntotally worked and she was like thank\nyou so much i just thought it'd be cool\nthat you know that\nyou know people are spreading this\nmessage and talking to people on the\nplane and here i'm sitting with my\nlaptop and i looked at the guy next to\nme and i was like\nall right you did it yeah i finally\ntalked to him\nit went really well and i felt much\nbetter afterwards but but yeah i think\nit's important to\nrealize that if you're hearing these\nthings and you're like ah that's not me\nthat's just the way minds work like we\nmight not get the quick intuition that\nit works you have to try it\nbut then once you try it you can reap\nall these benefits and where is the\nspace because i know you speak\nabout this too where is the space\nfor personal time because\ni know that i'm someone who because my\nworld is so much of giving and\ninteracting and communicating and even\nthough i'm a\nself-admitted interval which no one\nwould probably ever agree with who knows\nme but\ni find myself far more at the corners\nand edges of rooms i find myself\nin a more one-to-one smaller deep\nmeaningful group\ni barely speak up in a group unless i'm\nasked to or referred to\ni feel very comfortable on stage but i\nfeel that's a very different different\npart of being an introvert so\nfor me as well like where is the room\nand space in our lives to have\ndecompression time to have time to\nrefuel to have time to\ngain energy from being silent and alone\nwhich i take so much\npersonal pleasure in yeah and personal\nkind of\nsacred space in tell us about the\nstudies and reese's that you found\naround that and how you encourage the\nstudents to do that too yeah\nso so this gets to another topic uh\nthat's big in the field of\npositive psychology research right now\nwhich is phenomenal of time affluence\nwhich is just having time for exactly\nthe kind of thing you're talking about\num it's not the objective amount of free\ntime you have in your life\nbut it's the amount of free time you\nperceive yourself having which can be a\nlittle bit different right\nthat amount of free time it turns out\ngoes a long way for our mental health in\npart because we can be by ourselves and\nrecharge we can take time to be present\nwe can take time for serendipity where\nyou're walking down the street and maybe\nyou have a conversation with someone or\nnot\nand the research suggests that people\nwho prioritize getting a little bit more\nof that\ntime affluence feeling wealthy in time\nlike that can go a long way for\nimproving your happiness\nturns out people who focus on becoming\nwealthy in time are happier than people\nwho focus on becoming wealthy in money\nagain a thing that we mispredict but it\ncan be really powerful\nand this is something i see my college\nstudents going wrong all the time\nright they think that the way to a happy\nlife is to like fill it like\nmeeting with friend and i'm going to run\nto my extracurricular then i'm going to\nswitch to the gym and then i'm going to\nstudy and it's like you look at their\ngcal and it's like\nbled all over it so there's just a sea\nof red and you think like can i just\nopen this up a little bit like what\nwould it look like to have you know a\nfree hour\nevery day you know just to kind of have\nspace to breathe and space to be\nyeah absolutely and i love what you said\nabout changing our perception because\nit's\nnot objectively around how much time we\nhave and i always joke like you know\nbeyonce and bill gates also have 24\nhours a day\nand and it's you know if you have that\nhow do you change your perception\nof how much time you have because i feel\nthe world we're all time poor the most\ncommon thing we hear from our friends\nand family is i don't have time\nprobably the most common thing we say to\npeople is i don't have time\nso glass how are you you're like busy\nbusy right right and i i\nstarted changing one thing i started to\ndo last year because i started to\nrealize\nthat i was using that word a lot and i\nstarted switching the word busy for\nproductive\nfor my mental state and because i\nstarted to realize that that forced me\nand pushed me to be more productive\ntoo and be careful about recognizing\nthat time affluence was a part of\nproductivity yeah but time affluence did\nnot sit in busyness\nyeah and so for me just that mental\nswitch was huge and if the words we use\nmatter right i mean this is\nour own perception of time so if someone\nyou know three times a day people ask\nhow are you and you say busy you start\nconvincing yourself\nand the data actually people the data\ndon't necessarily bear out that we're\nbecoming busier\nuh ashley williams who's at harvard\nbusiness school looked at this and she\nfound that like it's not the case that\nwe're busy or we're just as busy as we\nwere 20 years ago we just think we're\nbusier\nand so so what can you do to feel less\nbusy one is it sounds odd but to feel\nlike you\nhave more time you have to gift yourself\nsometime you have to like just\nallow yourself to have some and we all\nknow this kind of implicitly like if\nyou've ever had\nyou know a moment at work or something\nwhere you thought you had like a day\nfilled with meetings and you show up at\none meeting and it gets cancelled\nand like oh what's happening now it's\nlike it happens to me sometimes i like\nwalk into a faculty meeting i was like\nwhere is everybody like oh it got\ncancelled didn't you hear i'm like no\nthen i'm like i have a half hour\nobjectively it's only a half hour but\nfor your\ni mean i feel like i could go skiing\nlike i could take up a new hot like it's\nlike a half\nhour right and so that's the power of\ngiving yourself a little free time that\nyou didn't expect\nright is it can feel so much bigger than\nit is um\nwe i i did this for my students so i\nfound it really ironic that i was going\nto teach them\na whole lecture on time affluence and\nall these studies when they're just so\ntime famished\nand so i'm like let me let them see what\nthis feels like so\non the day we were supposed to have this\ntime affluence lecture students came to\nclass\nand my teaching assistants were handing\nout these flyers and the flyers said\ntoday's lecture is about time affluence\nand to make you feel what that's like\ni'm going to give you some no class\ntoday\nright and it's better i couldn't cancel\nclasses the day before because then\nthey'd know it's like but it was like\nthat cancelled meeting moment yeah and\nthey were screaming and students freaked\nout one student brought out a bluetooth\na speaker and they were playing like\ndrake god's plan\nwas like oh yes but what was amazing was\nsome students\nuh reacted like the deep emotional\nreaction like one student\nburst into tears and she said this was\nthe first free hour and a half she's had\nall semester\nand i think you know we can all start\nfeeling like that but but that's our\nchoice you know we can free this up so\nso homework some professor i give even\nyour podcast listeners homework homework\nis go into your gcal or whatever\ncalendar system you use right now\nand block off next month sometime just\npick a random day just block off a month\nand put it in there and write time\naffluence two hours time affluence\nand i promise when you get to that spot\nit will just feel amazing yeah she's a\nprofessor after all yeah give us some\nhomework no i love it\nand and yeah i i talk a lot about uh\npeople setting meetings\nso meetings are emmy and then meetings\nbecause\ni feel like we're so busy scheduling\nmeetings with everyone else\nyet the most important meeting of the\nday is with yourself\nand i don't know anyone who's really\nprioritized\nmeetings with themselves and when we\nwere monks time with ourselves and\nmeetings was such an\nimportant part of before you have time\nfor anyone else if you haven't had time\nfor yourself how are you going to show\nup\nin that podcast meeting conversation\ndiscussion etc so\nand the work that ashley williams is\ndoing is suggesting that just\nfeeling time strapped causes us to do\nall this yucky stuff she finds that\npeople who are\nmore time strapped even if i just do\nsome intervention where i have you you\nknow list all the things you have to do\ntoday which makes me feel like oh gosh i\nhave\nso much to do those people she finds\nwill recycle less for the\nrest of the week like there's old work\nin psychology suggesting that people who\nare\nkind of feeling in a rush will be more\nmean to other people\nthis very classic study where they had\nseminary students so these are people\nwho should\nreally be wanting to help other people\nseminary students where they made them\neither feel like they were in a rush for\na meeting or not\num and they did this thing where as the\nseminary students were walking out to\nthis meeting they might be in a rush for\nthere was a homeless person a seemingly\nhomeless person it was actually a\nconfederate like a fake\nactor who was in the study who seemed\nlike they were in distress and the\nquestion was who stopped\nand what you find is almost three times\nfewer people stopped when they were in a\nrush than if they felt like they had\nsome time\nright so all these things we value about\nourselves we feel our moral choices like\nwhether we recycle whether we help\npeople\nas soon as we get in kind of frantic\ntime famish space all those goals go\naway\nyes and i and i think that's the study\nwhere actually they were made to be in a\nrush to give a presentation on being a\ngood\nseminar that's right like it was like it\nwas a rush i have to i have to get out\nof here to be a i give james my lecture\non being a good samaritan\nlike then they're not actually being a\ngood samaritan exactly yeah and that and\nthat's the\nthat's the dichotomy of it always that\nyou know\nand we weren't they didn't do any mean\ntests like that on us as monks but we\nwere\nwhen we were out on the streets and\nasked to fend for ourselves what we saw\nwere two modes that people went into\nand what we saw initially was survival\nmode where you just started focusing how\ndo you survive yourself\nand then others went into service mode\nand we found that over two to three\nweeks those of us that went into service\nmode\nnot only were happier and healthier and\nactually had all our needs provided\nbut we were also accomplishing the task\nof\nactually doing what we were meant to do\nfrom a from a sole point of view and\nfrom a service point of view\nwhereas those who were in survival mode\nalso didn't have the same access to food\nor friends or any of it\nand so we find that that survival mode\nis such a\nit's such a disconnecting way of\nbelieving and thinking and that's kind\nof like what we were just doing now\nwe're having a group\nand and what i'm so excited about\ncollaborating with you and figuring out\nways to work together is that\ni've always believed that people who can\nfigure out a way to work together and\ncollaborate will be happier\nthan those who build their own towers\nand are sitting on them alone\nand and i think we see that a lot in\nsociety that we always hear the words\nit's lonely at the top\nand it's because a lot of people grow\ntheir own tower but they didn't grow\neveryone else's tower and\nshare towers at the same time it's it's\nboring being in your own tower but if\nyou could visit someone else's tower and\nthey could visit yours\nit'd start becoming a more fun place to\nbe yeah and i think you learn incredible\namounts you know\ni mean you mentioned learning from my\ntalk but i feel like i learned so much\nfrom hearing you speak both hearing your\njourney and hearing how you put this\ninto practice\nin your own life you know committing to\nbeing a monk committing to the service\nbut also just like how much you realized\nabout you can\nteach people through things that are fun\nyou know your yours your listeners\naren't taking listening to this podcast\nin part because they're getting a grade\nfor it like my students in class right\nthey just think it's really cool and so\nso i'm i'm grateful the fact that you've\nshared your tower with me or our towers\nhave collided with a tower better yeah\nyeah we have a bridge yes\nyeah no no no it's the same for you like\nwhen i saw you present it's like your\nwork is very entertaining\nyou're you're great at communicating in\na way that's really simple and effective\nand that's what i love and i think\nthat's\nwhy people are now listening to podcasts\nlike this\nand and i know your podcast is coming\nout lately so just to do a little plug\nso uh i'm starting a new podcast called\nthe happiness lab which will launch\nseptember 17th\nuh it's a free podcast that's coming out\nfrom pushkin industries so those are the\nfolks who brought us\nrevisionist history by malcolm gladwell\nmy favorite author of all time yeah he's\nincredible but\nuh but it's gonna be great it's every\nepisode is gonna be a different way your\nmind lies to you about what you can do\nto be happy\num and what you can do to live a little\nbit more flourishingly\namazing i love it i think it's gonna be\nincredible thanks so much and jay's\ngonna and jay's gonna be on the podcast\nyeah and i'm really happy you're doing\nthat i just i just think there's such a\nneed for people who are deep into\nresearch\nto share what they're finding because i\nthink it gives people so much more\nconfidence and conviction in what\nthey're doing and i know like i've said\nbefore i'm quoting studies\nall the time in my work my solo episodes\nare full of me\nquoting studies that i'm reading that\nback up the points i'm trying to make\nand make them more relevant\ntell me what's the biggest thing you've\nseen that differentiates happy people\nfrom unhappy people what have you seen\nas being\nthe critical biggest thing yeah one of\nthe biggest things you've seen i mean\nif you had to rank i think it really\nwould be social connection you know\nloneliness\nis bad for us as smoking 15 cigarettes a\nday um\nand these days in colleges for example\nwe have over 60 percent of college\nstudents report feeling not just lonely\nbut very lonely\nmost of the time um so i think that's\nhit number one i think hit number two\nwould be to take time\nto have time to be present to take time\nto be with oneself either through\nmeditation or through prayer or just\nyou just canceled some meetings and you\nhad some time to yourself\nand then the final thing that we preach\nis sort of healthier practices so\nyou know silly things that we forget\nthings like taking time to exercise\ntaking time to be in nature\ntaking time to sleep those things are\nmuch more powerful than we think\nyeah absolutely just and just one more\nplug if i can squeeze in yeah\num if folks really want to learn more\nabout the science then they've been able\nto get on your podcast\nuh one fun thing that we've done is that\nwe've put the yale class online\ncompletely for free\nyeah so if this short version of the\nyale class piqued your interest\nstudents can check out coursera.org the\nscience of well-being\nit's a 10-week class where you do all\nthe stuff that the yale students do\nyou don't have to take it for 10 weeks\nyou can binge watch it like a netflix\nseries just watch all the lectures\num but what's amazing is we're seeing\nscientifically that this class is\nhelping people with these data\nshowing that within 10 weeks it's\nincreasing people's positive emotion\nit's making people feel less stressed\nit's actually giving people more of a\nsense of meaning in life\nso scientifically backed ways of\nlearning these habits putting them into\npractice and feeling better 100\ndefinitely check it out i think that's\nawesome for anyone who's who's enjoyed\nthis conversation which i'm sure you\nhave make sure you go ahead and and take\na look\nyou can be a yale student for free yes\nno sats yeah\nreally you don't have to take an exam\nlike it's amazing yeah that's awesome i\nabsolutely love that you've done that\ni'm glad that it's\nspreading further it needs to and you\nsaw that right because you told the\nstory of the reason it spread is you had\na student that was interning at the new\nyork times or\nyeah he actually just he just had\nstarted a job at the new york times or\nwas going to start when he graduated\nuh and he was in the class and you know\nhe he\ndecided to pitch a story on the class\nand i think the focus of your time was\nlike that's so weird that one out of\nevery four year old students is taking\nclass\non happiness not a class on computer\nscience or pre-med class or some\ndata whatever it's like happiness right\nand so\nuh yeah so he did this lovely article on\nthe class uh\nthat went completely viral you know then\nyou know just like you know i'm on the\ntoday show i'm on nbc news\ni had all these international outlets\nthat were talking about me you know i\nhave a little google or myself as i\nimagine you do as well and i don't\nyou should actually definitely should do\nyeah you get lots of interesting stuff\nbut\nbut uh but it would it would pull up\narticles that were like you know in thai\nand in check and i'm just like\nthis is crazy yeah yeah and it's\nbeautiful and i'm so glad that\ni am so happy that the proof is that\nthat's the most subscribed to class\nat somewhere like yale and and i know so\nmany you showed so many examples of\nother\nfamous schools in different schools\ncoming to that point of wanting to do\nthe same\nand it just shows that despite us\nknowing that the future is data and the\nfuture is\nai and the future is vr and the future\nis all this incredible stuff\nthat ultimately if it can't be used in\nleverage to create more happiness\nwhere you know where is it going to go\nand and that's i believe that all of\nthose things i've just mentioned\ncan be used for happiness it's just we\nhave to look at it through that lens\nand it's also just you know i think many\npeople particularly young people kids in\nhigh school think you know\nstudents at yale have kind of won the\nlife lottery at least up to that you\nknow 19 year old point right they're\nyoung they're\nat an ivy league university they got\ninto this place\nand that many of them felt like they\nweren't flourishing enough that they\nneeded some scientific tips to feel\nbetter\ni think that's really telling too and i\nthink particularly for your younger\nlisteners\nyou know even like this moment you got\ninto hail like you're not\ndone like it's a journey and like the\nthings they teach at yale apart from my\nclass\nthe things they teach at yale might not\nbe the kinds of things that are really\ngenerating well-being\nyeah absolutely love that i've got one\nlast question for you before we\nmove forward and this was around\ngratitude and what i loved yesterday is\nyou talked about gratitude letters\nand when we were monks we did the same\nthing and so gratitude letters have been\na part of my life for a long long time\ni'm a huge fan of writing\nhandwritten notes or personal notes to\npeople as well tell me about how\nmy audience today can use your form of\ngratitude letter writing for their own\nlives\nyou want me to give them more homework\nyeah more homework okay i love\ni love shelling out the homework i love\nyale professor yeah um\nso a gratitude letter is just a simple\nact of thinking somebody you haven't\ngotten around to think for a long time\nyou know it could be\nan old teacher it could be a family\nmember it could be someone at work\nwe often don't express gratitude to the\npeople\nwe care about the most and for a couple\nreasons we assume they already know it\nwe assume it'll kind of be awkward\nbecause we don't you know we feel like\nthe sharing is going to feel weird\nand that means we don't share the kinds\nof things we're super grateful for\nbut sharing what you're grateful for is\ngreat because it's a way to make a\nsocial connection you have this really\nvulnerable conversation with somebody\nwhich we know boosts well-being\nyou're feeling gratitude which i'm sure\nas listeners every podcast know can bump\nup well-being\nand you can kind of cement this bond\nwith someone and really help them like\nreally do something nice for them that\nthey weren't expecting\nand so the the the challenge the\nhomework is\ndo this you know take 10 15 minutes pick\nsomeone the prompt is just\nwrite a letter of thanking somebody you\nhaven't think yet and in the best case\nscenario don't just like mail it to them\nor email them\nfind them in person and read it to them\nyes and i'm sure some of your listeners\nare thinking what my yell student said\nlike emo awkward\nyeah yeah yeah uh\nbut the research suggests that it that\nthat letter will make the person who\nreceives it\nnot just incredibly happy but will boost\nup their purpose and meaning in life in\nways they don't expect\nbut what's more amazing is what will\nhappen to you the research by\npositive psychologist marty seligman and\ncolleagues suggest that it not only\nbumps up your happiness\nbut it's a happiness bump that can last\nfor over a month\nwhich is crazy i mean when i present the\nstudy in class i say if i started this\nlecture by saying there's something you\ncould do in a half hour today\nthat would statistically bump up your\nwell-being for over a month you would\nsay i was crazy\nor i was trying to sell something or\nmake money but like gratitude is\ncompletely free you know maybe you have\nto like pay for the paper or something\nbut it's really cheap right\num and so it's like such powerful\ninterventions that are completely free\nand don't even take that much time\nwe have this huge effect on our\nhappiness i absolutely love that and and\nwhat turned me really on to gratitude\nwas i remember a few years ago one of my\nfriends\nlost his father's father passed away and\nhis last conversation with his father\nwas an argument\nand he remembers that being the last\nthing he said to his father and they\nwere shouting at each other\nand then his father passed away you know\nit was unpredicted and\nno idea that it was going to happen and\ni remember him opening up to me and\nsaying to me that he'd\nregretted that was his last conversation\nwith his father because\nreally he loved his father and that was\njust the argument that they were having\nat the time\nbecause of whatever reason and i\nremember him telling me that and just\nthinking to myself\nokay my last conversations with everyone\ni have from now\nare going to be good conversations so\ni'm never going to go to sleep angry\ni'm never going to say something mean to\nsomeone as the last thing i say to them\ni'm never going to end anything on that\nsort of a note and so i've gone around\ntrying to always\ni tell my wife i love her every day i\ntell my mama i message my mom as much as\ni can to tell her i love her\nand it's not just artificially just\nsaying i love you i love you i love you\nit's\nlike you said being specific and that's\nfor me gratitude is specific\nfor me whenever i teach gratitude is\nlike how specific can you be\nabout what you're grateful for and what\nsomeone's done in your life because we\nall get\nlike when someone comes up to me and\nsays jay that was really nice\npresentation i'm like\nthat's nice and i appreciate that when\nsomeone says gee that was a really nice\npresentation because this is what i\nlearned\nthat is far more revelatory to me that\nthe person was actually listening\nand engaged and also it's just so much\nmore meaningful and deep and you form a\nbond and\nand so i feel that the more specific we\ncan be in gratitude\nthe more we feel the benefit and the\nmore the other person does too and\nthere's research on this it's the\nspecificity and it's also but it's also\nthe emotion part\nyou know when somebody says you know i\nloved your talk and like it really\ntouched me and you\nthey're being vulnerable and like\nadmitting emotions to you that might be\nawkward especially if they just met you\nat your talk\nlike that feels really good but that's\nnot what people predict one of the\nchallenges of writing the gratitude\nletter is our own perception of what the\nother person's thinking\nlike we think like oh if i express too\nmuch emotion it's going to feel weird\nor if i mention some specific thing it\nmight sound like really strange like why\nthat one specific thing in the talk\num or even worse we start analyzing\nespecially if you're writing it\nlike what the letter sounds like i know\ni can be very perfectionistic and i get\nthis myself of like they're going to\nanalyze my grammar\nlike that this is some work by the\npsychologist nick eppley and what he\nfinds is like\nthat's what that's what the writers are\nthinking and so they're so worried about\nit\nbut what the listeners want is just like\njust to feel like you connected you know\njust the specific emotion and like oh\nman you just you notice this right\nthat's what people are paying attention\nto absolutely absolutely in sanskrit\nthere's a word that's called\nsarah grahi and what it means is that\nthe seeker of the essence and it said\nthat ultimately everyone is just\nyou're not listening to what people say\nyou're listening to how they say it\nand what's being communicated is the\nemotion and i think we all do that and\nwe were talking about it yesterday\nthat when we're speaking and\ncommunicating sometimes you could be\nsaying something that makes complete\nsense\nbut you say it in the worst way and\neveryone's already shut off\nand and sometimes like you said we're\ntrying to poetically articulate how we\nfeel\nbut the person's just going to get the\nmessage from him just the emotion there\nyeah and there's so much research on the\npower of that right this is another\nbenefit of gratitude is that\nyou can actually use it to increase\nproductivity you know there's studies in\nbusiness schools about you know if you\nwant to motivate\nyour workers if you're a manager don't\npay them more express\ngratitude there's one study by adam\ngrant where they have folks who are\nworking in like a university call center\nso these are like my poor students who\nhave to make money by calling alums and\nbegging for money and it's you know\nreally kind of like soul-wrenching sort\nof work\num but what they find is that if the\nmanager comes in and just says\nyou know we're really grateful for what\nyou do you're really like positively\naffecting the university thank you so\nmuch\nand like in a way that the emotion kind\nof comes out using your sanskrit\nterm what you find is not only do people\nwork more they work\nthey make twice as many calls so you\nincrease productivity two-fold\njust by this simple act of expressing a\nteeny tiny bit of emotion in this short\nthing\nwe forget the power of this stuff to\naffect people to affect ourselves\num but we just have to be a little\nvulnerable and sometimes go against you\nknow as my class teachers go against\nthese instincts\nand our what our mind's telling us to do\nit's like oh it's going to be awkward\njust do it you get all these benefits\nokay one last question before because\nyou you're just too good to know i have\nto come back i have to go\nyeah you 100 have to come back this this\none's really important to me because i\nthink so many people\nand i'm sure you see in students the\nmost and i get asked this a lot that's\nwhy i'm asking you because i think\nyou'll be able to help\nprocrastination and overthinking it's\nhuge right now\nthe amount of people that message me and\nsay i don't know what to do because i'm\nprocrastinating i procrastinate too much\ni overthink too much i overanalyze\nwhat have you seen both from a science\nand practical step-by-step process of\novercoming procrastination\nand overthinking yeah well part of it\nkind of comes from the stuff that we've\nbeen talking about like we're not trying\nto enjoy the journey we just have this\ndestination in mind right\nyou know i have to write the perfect\nessay or i have to you know finish the\nperfect project this huge huge thing\nand it's from the anxiety that comes\nfrom putting all our eggs in that basket\nthat procrastination arises right\nyou know my students will be you know\ndoing a final paper and they're so\nworried about their grade the final\npaper has to be perfect\nyou know they're not thinking about what\nthey're going to learn how fun it's\ngoing to be it's just like\nthe anxiety of that and that's what\nplagues you that's why you can't\nthat's why you can't start and so i\nthink you know\none one way to get over procrastination\nis to\noften people talk about breaking up the\nproject into kind of steps\nand i think that does two things one is\nit makes it more manageable that you can\nkind of\nfeel like your journey is getting you to\nlike some goal and you can keep\nkind of building on that but a lot of it\nis getting us away from this external\nmindset you know we're not if you're\nthinking about oh my god my final grade\nin this whole class that's going to\nfreak you out you're not going to be\nable to start\nbut if you're thinking about like i'm\njust going to do the first paragraph and\neven that kind of be mindful about like\nwhat am i going to learn from this\nparagraph like how can i make it more\nabout the journey and i can make it fun\nthat kind of opens you up a little bit\nsort of shuts off all the emotion that\ncomes with procrastination\nthat's awesome laura you're amazing what\nwe end every interview with is a final\nfive\nquickfire rapid fire round so it's you\nhave to answer these questions in one\nword or one sentence okay\nmaximum i i'm a lengthy i'm a you know\nwords\nkidding i usually ruin this because i\nget really interested by what people say\nand then\nwe go ask more questions but anyway\nwe'll try and do that so what's the one\nthing you can always count on to lift\nyour mood\nuh my husband oh that's amazing i love\nthat i'd say i say my wife to the answer\nthat's awesome\nquestion number two what's the biggest\nlesson you've learned from being a\nteacher\nuh this is a hard one um\npatience patience question number three\nwhat's the best\npiece
