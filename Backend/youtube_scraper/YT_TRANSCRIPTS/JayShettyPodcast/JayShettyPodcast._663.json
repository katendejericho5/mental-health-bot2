    "transcript": "the challenge i always give to my\naudience is think about someone you\nreally adore and really love\njust absolutely are spectacularly\nfaithful about\nif they were putting in their body what\nyou're putting in your body what would\nyou tell them\nwhatever that is tell that to yourself\nhello everyone welcome back to on\npurpose\ni'm so excited for this episode i know\nthat you\nare focused on growing your purpose\ngrowing your passion\nand improving your life work and love\nevery single day and every single week\nhere with me\nand i'm always trying to find guests\nthat i believe can truly help you\ntransform that\ntoday's guest is someone that i've\nadmired for a very very long time i've\nbeen a follower and fan of his work\nfor a long time as well so i'm so\nexcited to have this opportunity\nto sit down with him here in new york\ncity and ask him about his thoughts\nhis background and his story and of\ncourse his purpose\nhe doesn't really need an introduction\nhe's a multiple new york times\nbest-selling author he has an\nincredible show on tv he's none other\nthan dr oz dr oz thank you so much\nfor this opportunity it's a great\npleasure to meet you jay yeah it's a\npleasure to be with you\nthank you for inviting us into your\nspace and and allowing us to\ngatecrash we fixed the feng shui for you\ngot the whole studio back this is the\nback part of the studio it's okay\nbut it's working it works for us it\nworks for us and i\nlike i said to you just before we\nstarted i've been a long-term fan and\nadmirer of your work\ni think it's incredible what you've done\nand so again i'm very grateful for this\nopportunity\nbut i want to start by helping my\naudience just learn about you as a whole\ni just find people's stories fascinating\nand i think as people grow\nand continue to have incredible careers\npeople who find out about them later on\ndon't get to see that side of it and so\ni'd love to go back\nto seven years old when you actually\ndecided you want to be a doctor which\nseems\nvery very early what sparked that in\nyour life\nso the name mehmet is turkish last name\noz is\nmy real last name it has two dots over\nit in turkish my parents were immigrants\nto this country\nand my father is a physician just passed\nactually 93 years of age\nand when i was 7 years of age we had\nmoved to a town bloomington delaware\nwe were foreigners i mean didn't\nunderstand the culture\ni didn't know some english words even\nthough i was speaking english with all\nmy friends in school\nand as an outsider my dad was trying to\npass along things to me that he thought\nmight be helpful as\nas i grew up we were in an ice cream\nshop i'll never forget it's called\npatterson's ice cream hit the best\nvanilla fudge\nso i'm waiting for my ice cream and\nthere's a kid in front of me was about\n10 years of age\nand this young man was just minding his\nown business trying to get his ice cream\nand my dad asked what he wanted to be\nwhen he grew up and the kid looked back\nand he said\ni don't know i'm 10 years old i haven't\nthought about it it makes sense that\nmakes you\nvery rational i thought it was pretty\ngood answer yes kid moves on my dad\nturned to me and said i never want to\never\never hear you give an answer like that\nand i said why and he said because if\nyou don't know what you're aiming for\nyou can't possibly head in that\ndirection this gets back to the very\nfundamental\nmeaning of the word sin what's a sin sin\nis a bow and arrow term\nright you pull your bow back and you\nfire the arrow\nif you don't hit the target that's a sin\nwell if you don't know what target\nyou're aiming for\nhow can you possibly hit it so my dad\nsaid i don't care if you change your\nmind 50 times\njust have a goal tell me what you want\nto do and then we'll keep talking about\nit you're only seven you can change it\nbut you got to have that in your mind\nright now\nso i said i love going to the hospital\nwith you i'll be a doctor\ni never changed my mind and i i'm\nblessed because there's not a lot of\nthings i could have done\nand the field that i've selected heart\nsurgery is perfectly designed for my\npersonality i mean ideal\ni couldn't be a hematologist or\npathologist i need to be in there\nin the battle i need to have immediate\nfeedback and gratification\nif my operation doesn't go well i can\ntell right then because the beep beep\nbecomes beep\nit all these changes begin to happen\nyou've spoken about heartbeat and ekgs\nin your work\nso you know the metaphor will we'll come\nback later in this podcast\nbut for me as a as a heart surgeon i\nrecognized early on\nthat there were aspects of what i was\ngood at that would make me excel at\nheart surgery\nand there are things that i was bad at\nthat would hurt me and hold me back\nin other fields and so although i told\nmy dad i'd be a doctor at seven the\nnuances have it evolved over my life\nbut it allowed me to begin to head in a\ndirection and that's an\nimportant message for a lot of your\nlisteners juventus is a great job\ngetting people to\nto think bigger but also think by\nstepping back\nfrom their perception of what life is\nand what they're destined to be\nbecome and if you can have a bigger\nvision for yourself\nuh then you'll be able to head in that\ndirection and one of the biggest\nmessages i always have my own kids and\nthe folks i try to mentor is you don't\nwant me to have a bigger vision for you\nthan you\nyeah if my thoughts about how big you\ncan be are greater than your thoughts\nwho you can be\nman that's not a good match right yeah\nyou're underserving yourself\nabsolutely listening to you now you have\nsuch a high level of self-awareness\nlike when you're speaking about why\nbeing a doctor was right for you it's so\nclear and it's so specific to you\ni've heard many people tell me why they\nwant to be doctors and often you will\nsee\npatterns or you'll hear broad answers\nwhereas when i hear from you there's so\nmuch\nspecificity tell me about when was that\ntime after you said it you know at seven\nyears old at that early age\nwhen was that time where you started to\nget the awareness to start noticing\nwhat was needed to become a doctor\nspecifically in that field\nand then that you had those skills what\nwas it that revealed that to you\nit wasn't until i was in college i i i'd\ngone to a\ngreat school i'd learned a lot of the\nfundamentals that i needed to have to\nsucceed in life\nand i went to college and i was playing\nfootball mm-hmm and i was beginning to\nunderstand\nwhat excelling at it at any adventure\nwould require and i began to study my\nown body and realize there were\nsubtleties about my body that i never\nappreciated i had taken for granted by\nthe way most of you listening out there\nprobably\njust where i wasn't you know i'm not\nperfect either but i you know began to\nget a little more proficient\nand so as i began to appreciate the\nspectacular wonders of the human body\nand the fact that i could get by do\ncertain things i didn't otherwise expect\ni began to appreciate that i could\nactually do this\nas a career i liked telling people\nthings about their body it gave me joy\nto look in someone's eyes have them know\nthat i was there for them and i could\ngive them insight they could\nchange their basic assumption of the\nworld around them i'll give you one\nexample right now please\nabout and just stay away from illness\nright because i can try to diagnose\nblood pressure but so you know it's hard\nto get the stethoscope this far\nsure everyone put their hands out in\nfront of them if you're not driving and\nlook at your third digit\nand your fourth digit your ring finger\nversus the middle finger right and then\nlook at the index finger you get those\nthree fingers there right\nokay which is longer the index finger\nthe or the ring finger\nthe ring finger for me all right so\npeople who have a ring finger longer\nthan the index finger had testosterone\nexposure in utero\nthey're usually men but not always women\nwill usually have a index finger the\npointer\nlonger than the ring finger because they\nweren't exposed to testosterone when\nthey were in utero yes\nyes it's true right now here's something\nthat's been true your entire life\nright it's so obvious in retrospect you\nwould think you would have already known\nit but you didn't\nthere are literally hundreds of examples\nlike that\nthat if you appreciate them they will be\nable to help you\nas guideposts as you get through life\nthat's just a parlor trick i just gave\nyou\nbut there's some pretty profound ideas\nlike are you a super taster or not\nthat's genetically determined by how\nwell you taste certain foods\npeople who are super tasters are very\nsensitive to bitter\nto taste like broccoli and leafy greens\nthey don't like vegetables\nso it's not because you're a bad person\nyou don't like vegetables literally your\ntaste buds don't want you to like\nthose vegetables and kids have more\ntaste buds when they're young\nand more of these taste buds so they\ndon't like vegetables and there's a\nsurvival benefit of that\nbecause in the wilds of 10 000 years ago\nif you're wandering around\neating bitter things well poisonous\nthings are bitter\nso you don't want to eat bitter things\nso you naturally gravitate to sweet\nthings\nright which is why kids are taught that\nthey naturally want it anyway so it\nworks but\nif you don't mature your taste buds if\nyou infantilize them with fast food and\njunk food\nthen they never grow up to become real\ntaste buds they're no longer going to\nhelp you\nchoose the foods naturally that you\nwould want in the indian subculture\nyou're you know it's\nyou're exposed to turmeric so early in\nlife it becomes part of\nyour your natural desire to enjoy food\nyou put it on\nmaking curry food right turns out that\nturmeric has a remarkable\nand powerful effect at reducing amyloid\nplaque in the brain\nwhich might explain why there's less\nalzheimer's in india than we would\nexpect\nnow all these things are ways long ways\nof me telling you that\nit's not just luck that you are the way\nyou are and because\nyou can understand the way you are\nbetter than you thought you could you\ncan hack it\nto make it easier to do the right thing\nand how do you start that\ntransformation then so now that you're\naware that actually my taste buds are\nnaturally putting me towards\nthese sweet foods but they may not end\nup in the best place for me\nhow do we start molding and transforming\nour taste buds for example\ncreate an environment that feeds what\nyou're good at and protects you from\nwhat you're not good at\nautomate your life i love chocolate i\nmean i really\ni'm glad you brought that up i have a\nmassive sweet tooth for chocolate\nit's just something about i don't i\ndon't like cupcakes but i like chocolate\nreal chocolate not\nyou know cocoa that's 30 dark chocolate\nand you put that on nuts\ni'm a turk that's i eat them nuts i just\nuse i mean 90 of the hazelnuts in the\nworld are made in turkey yes so you just\ncan't get away from this stuff\nyeah and if i know if i put chocolate\ncovered nuts around me i will finish the\nwhole bowl i just don't have the ability\nto stop\nso i just make sure i'm never around\nchocolate covered nuts and bowls\ni'll eat one or two at a time i don't\ndeprive myself i eat the chocolate by\nitself nuts by themselves but not\ntogether ever\nthat's a simple example but there are\nmany others that you could\njust think about in your own life there\nare a lot of folks who very\nappropriately medicate with food\nbecause turns out carbohydrates simple\ncarbs especially are incredibly soothing\nto the brain they hit their brain like\ncrack cocaine\nso if you are prone to that addictive\nresponse you have to be careful about\nthat so\nif you get home from work and you've had\na fight with your boss or your spouse or\nthe kids weren't respectful and the\ntraffic was bad\nand you walk in there and you're a\nlittle down and the first thing you see\nwhen you open the fridge is a cheesecake\nyou're gonna grab that cheesecake\nbecause you're disciplined and cut a\nvery thin sliver of it\ni mean so thin you can see through it\nit's a micron thick\nright yeah it's like you know micro fish\nfish and you cut that little thing you\nput in your mouth\nit tastes so good and then you realize\nyou didn't cut the cake straight\nso to straighten it out take another\nsliver another bigger sliver and then\nit's wedged and by the time you're done\nyou finish the whole thing off\nright past that whole thing over here\nmama and you're done and what you've\ndone\nunconsciously is feeding into your\nweakness but if there's no\nstuff that you're prone to eat in your\nfridge you'll eat what you get\nthat's why i always tell folks the\ncrisper is actually disservice to you\nyou hide the veggies in the crisper you\ndon't see them\ninstead you see the soft drink and\nleftovers and other stuff at eye level\nat eye level in your fridge put foods\nthat you know are good for you that you\nalso like\nthat's in fact that's the biggest\nmessage only eat foods that you adore\nthat happen to be good for you yeah\nbecause you like eat the other stuff\nanyway\nabsolutely and then you'll slowly start\nto get into a habit if if you're gonna\ndrink alcohol and you know you're gonna\ndrink alcohol when you get home\nthe best alcohol probably is tequila\nbecause it's got a little sweetness to\nit from the agave anyway\nso you don't have to add anything to it\nyou can drink it straight up put some\nlemon in it so\nserving is 66 calories and one ounce\nright so if i if i try and i like you\nknow\nif i'm gonna ever have a drink that's\nwhat i generally will have so i put it\nin my\nfreezer at eye level i open the freezer\ni don't see ice cream which i also like\ni'll see the agave and i'll drink that\nand then i'll have a little bit and i'm\ndone\nand so i haven't undermined myself for\nsomething that i know will cause a\nproblem for me in the future now if\nyou're listening you have your own\nlimitations your own strengths feed the\nlimit the the strengths\nthen hinder the limitations starve them\ni love how practical that is especially\neye level because we all know at grocery\nstores\nand superstores the stuff at eye level\nis the stuff that we all want to buy\nand it's necessarily bad for us but we\ncan change what's at eye level in our\nhome\nand they're paying to get that yes\nexactly exactly which again is for good\nbusiness i don't blame them\nnow that you know address it\nappropriately yeah absolutely that's\nsuch great advice i know i know that for\na fact that\nit's it's it's why mini bars and hotels\nare so dangerous\nbecause mini bars are another like i\nusually take my own food with me\nyes me too yeah and i try i travel with\na bag of knife bagging that's in my\nbriefcase right now yeah i never leave\nhome without it yeah i think everyone\nwill have nuts in their pockets\nright male and women by the way i soak\nmy nuts\ni like to put them in the water they\ngerminate and i cart them around and\nthat way i'm not foraging through\nvending machines looking for food\nagain simple little thing hacks like\nthat end up making your life a little\nsimpler because\nuh i mean they make it life simple but\nit's more straightforward because what\nyou really want to do is focus your\neffort your chu\nchi of the energy decisions that you\nhave to\nuse and consume have to be focused on\nthings that matter\nso i don't want to rediscover what\nbreakfast i want every day i'm going to\nhave greek yogurt and blueberries most\ndays or\na little oatmeal whatever i mean there's\nother things that but\nthere are two or three options eggs you\nknow that's it i'm not going to go out\nthere wasting all my time in the morning\ntrying to find out what to eat for\nbreakfast\nyou know i think the smart thing to do\nis just save your energy making\nprowess absolutely for the ideas that\nyou absolutely have to do that are your\nbest interests but also\nonly you can do absolutely and that way\nby the time you get to the middle of the\nafternoon you haven't exhausted\nall that energy making me worthless\ndecisions\nand then you don't fall prey to the\nafternoon dilemma that many have the\nthe bewitching hour yeah because by the\ntime it's four five in the afternoon\nyou're so exhausted your brain is\nthat you have to supercharge it with\ncarbs yeah that's why people crave\nfoods that aren't good for them at four\nor five in the afternoon that's such a\ngood point and\nwe all know that decision fatigue is so\nreal when we're\nwasting our energy on making these\nsmaller insignificant decisions i've\nbeen having\nthe same thing for breakfast and same\nthing for lunch for the last\n10 15 years of my life so proud and it's\nmade\nit's made my life so much easier no it's\none of those things that you do because\nit\njust gives you sanity and space to use\nyour creative energy i\noatmeal every single morning and i\nusually have avocado on toast for lunch\nthat's that's usually my ideal line\nthat's why you look the way you look and\nthen you can you know\npull around for the for dinner and\nwhatever you want yeah i'm a bit more\nexperimental at dinner usually it's\nindian\ni'm very fortunate that my wife's an\nincredible cook so i get spoiled every\nnight with something something good for\nme but\nno i love that and i think so many of us\nput so much pressure on ourselves\nto have to be creative about our meals\nevery single day and i'm sure what's\nthat doing is it also confusing our\nsystem\nlike if you're always taking different\nthings i've always had that intuitive\nsense that\ni'm actually confusing my own body\nbecause i'm just giving it something new\nevery day or every morning i think you\ndo confuse your body at times but even\nmore importantly\nyour body knows what works for it and\nwhat doesn't and it tells you that\nin subtle ways and then more loudly says\nit and then shouts in your ear as you\nget ill from not paying attention\nso most of us will naturally gravitate\ntowards the kinds of foods that are in\nour\nbest interest so if you eat oatmeal\nevery morning there's a pretty good\nchance that you don't have a problem\nwith oatmeal\nbecause you wouldn't do it anymore now\nthere's some folks listening uh who\nhaven't paid attention so you're\nexempted from this comment okay so\nplease pay attention but if\nyou get up in the morning and you're\nbloated your eyes are swollen shut you\nfeel like you've got to cough\nyou're having a food allergy oftentimes\nor an allergy to something so\nlisten to your body but assuming you get\nup you feel rested and yeah yeah\nenergized then you what you did the day\nbefore works for you you'll naturally\nwant to reproduce that\nand i know that i have sensitive\nintestinal systems around certain things\ni can't eat\nsuper spicy food me too yeah my and my\nwife loves it she's also a chef\nthat was one of our you know one of the\nnew york times bestselling books was her\nbook on\nfood i forgot that one yeah the uh but\nthe uh and show she likes spicy foods\nand i see her mouth burning up and i\nknow when i eat three spicy foods my\nbottom hurts when i go to the bathroom i\nmean the entire intestinal system is\nravaged\nso i've learned not to do that it's\nalways not fun the first time or anytime\nit happens\nyeah listen to our buddies everyone\nwho's listening and watching right now\nthere are so many incredible\ninsights in this podcast already i hope\nyou're taking notes and if you're\ndriving and you can't take notes and if\nyou're walking your dog and you can't\ntake notes\nthen please please please make sure you\ncome back to this episode there are so\nmany great nuggets that\ndr oz is already sharing with us thank\nyou so much for making it so practical\nand applicable for my audience\nyou you made a point uh a few moments\nago where you were talking about how\nwhen you're talking about people with\ntheir visions and their goals\nyou're always wanting them to expand\nthem further you were saying that if i'm\nspeaking to someone and my goal for them\nis bigger than theirs\nthen they need to work on that how have\nyou seen that like obviously you spent a\nlot of time between turkey and the u.s\nwhen you were growing up how were you\nable to expand your vision and how can\npeople who are listening today\nalso do that because i don't know about\nyourself and i'd love to know when i\nstarted i never knew\nhow big things could scale and i'm not\nsure when you started as a doctor\nwhether you believed you'd have this\nincredible tv show\nand selling over 40 million books like\ndid you have that vision or was that\nsomething that gradually\ngrew as time went on none of the things\nyou say were on my vision board\never exactly that's yeah and i didn't do\nany things that i did\nfor that vision yes i had much more\nmeasured desires but there were desires\nthat would address\nthe deep urging longing inside me\nthat i i felt that while i was on this\nplanet having this experience if i\nhadn't done these things shame on me so\ni began pursuing a lot of things i do\nwith that\nmeasured goal and my wife who's actually\nhad a much\nbetter pulse on what i should be doing\nand what america's feeling and needs\nthan i've ever had\nwas the one who kept nudging me and she\nwas the one who conspired with oprah\nactually because they said my wife had\nso i'm\npracticing heart surgery and minding my\nown business you're in new york city i'm\nat new york presbyterian so sometimes\nthe news agencies will call and say\nbreaking story someone's having heart\nsurgery what do you have to comment or\nmaybe you did the heart surgery because\ni did i had done operating some a\nbunch of famous people so i ended up\nbecoming part of the news but it was you\nknow\naround the edges that wasn't i didn't do\nthe art surgery to\nbe in the news yeah of course so that my\nwife one day said you know you're coming\nhome every day and you're\nmoaning about the fact that that people\nare having heart surgery who didn't need\nit\nif they just taken a few proactive steps\non their own they could have avoided the\nwhole thing\nyes instead of complaining about it\nlet's fix the problem\nlet's make a show that it teaches people\nwhat you guys know\nand this is the accusation she launched\nat me and she was right\nshe says the reason america doesn't have\nthe message about health is because you\nhaven't given it to them\nso with that in mind i started with\nworking with her we crafted a show that\nwas in the air on discovery channel my\nfirst guest was oprah\nand they said oprah bonded they began\ntalking about things that we could do in\na bigger way and of course we're having\nthe biggest platform of all so\nthen she loves to teach people don't\nalways give her the credit she's there\nbut that's primarily what she wanted to\ndo\nyes whether it's race relations or\ntransgender issues\nuh glbt issues or if it's uh\nspirituality or\nhealth in fact the word doctor means\ndoctor right teacher\nthe word itself means teacher so i would\ngo on a show\nyou know 60 70 times we pour work stuff\ntogether and lisa and oprah began\nplanning out ways we could do it\ndifferently and brand it better and\nand get america to believe they could do\nit that because our biggest enemy\nyour biggest enemy j is nihilism people\ndon't\nthink they can do it and we're both here\nto say yes you can\nyes absolutely only you are holding\nyourself back\nand what you want to achieve that's your\ndecision but what but you can do it\nso i began talking more and more\npublicly about\nthe possibilities of health and that led\nme into a place where i could\nyou know talk to folks in the public\nareas in fact i started on radio with\nbecause i would hope host oprah's radio\nshow\nwhen i do her show and then i go off\ninto the radio studio and do that and\nactually taught me a lot about how to\ntalk to people about stuff that matters\nand i recognized at that point um and\nactually i remember the moment that it\nhappened\ni was with oprah and she said has it\nhappened yet\ni said what i said you know are the\npeople know and i said no what\nso do they see you on the street and\nknow who you are and know what you're\ndoing\nand it just started because most of us\nare comfortable with anonymity right\nyou're walking down the street no one\nknows what you're doing\nuh thankfully we behave ourselves but\nyou know you don't have to\nyeah but at a certain point people begin\nknowing who you are they think they went\nto school with you they can't quite\nplace you\nand it eventually becomes a bit more\npowerful of a link to what you do for a\nliving\nand she said when you have that use it\nfor good\nit's not about self-aggrandizement it's\nreally about using that\npower of the platform the the bully\npulpit the the megaphone that you have\nand telling a story uh sharing wisdom\nis what you're doing that allows people\nto define themselves in their own life\nstory because listen we all are in a\nstory\nyes and if you don't know what story\nyou're in that's a problem\nyou don't want to be in someone else's\nstory because if you're in someone\nelse's story you're a big player and\nthey're\nbecause they're not gonna make you the\nstar of their story right so don't be\nyour spouse's\nstory person you're just a co-star there\nyeah\nright and if you're not sure what your\nstory is about where you might be headed\nin the wrong direction\nso figure out what your story is small\nor big as it is and then show up in that\nstory because you're the star of it\nbecause only you could be the star of it\nand that was part of the message we\nstarted to go out with on the show\nand i tell you what resonated the most\nwas\npeople's interest in their health\ni mean it's selfish in a way because you\nwant to be healthy and it's for your\nbest interest\nbut at its very core if you can't\ntake charge of your own health if you\ncan if you cannot\ncontrol what's going on inside your body\nhow can you change the world outside of\nit\nabsolutely and the reason you should\ncare about your body is is because it's\nthe first step\nof everything else that you have to do\nif you're starting with diabetes and\nhigh blood pressure and your cholesterol\nis whacking you're depressed because\nyou've got\ncontinuous inflammatory problems you\ncan't remember anything because you're\nheading towards dementia because\neverything else in your body is in\ndisarray well how are you going to\ncontribute to the planet right your\nparents not give you the body you were\nblessed to have\nyour most vital inheritance so you can\nmuck it up so\nnow that you realize how sacred you are\nif you truly appreciate that\ntake the manager so you can do all the\nother things and the challenge i always\ngive to my audience\nis think about someone you really adore\nand really love\njust absolutely are spectacularly\nfaithful about\nif they were putting in their body what\nyou're putting in your body what would\nyou tell them\nbecause whatever that is tell that to\nyourself that is great advice i love\nthat tell that to yourself\nwhen you yeah when we treat people we\nlove or are fond of or affectionate\ntowards with so much more\ncare and attention that we do ourselves\nand you reminded me\nof this was one of arnold\nschwarzenegger's first\never documentaries it was called pumping\niron i've seen it i know the guy\ni know the guy who produced it butler oh\nno way okay i've only ever seen it when\ni was growing up but i remember there's\none line in there that stuck with me\nand in that he said the reason why\nfitness goals were so important to him\nand his health and his physique was so\nimportant to him\nis because he believed that was\nsomething you could never cheat\nright you could never cheat your own\nbody yeah if you're eating badly\nyou're going to see the result you can't\ncheat it like you can cheat you can lie\nto yourself in your mind but your body's\nnot going to lie\nwhat a beautiful insight from a very big\nman absolutely absolutely absolutely and\nhe said it now i think it was like 1970\nor something it must have even\nway before i was born but i remember\nremember watching that but it was it was\nfascinating i\ntell me about this belief principle and\ni'd love to hear from your perspective\nbecause we hear about it so much but i'd\nlove to hear it from your\nmedical background and this is us diving\ninto purpose a bit more now as well but\nwhere have you had a failed belief that\nyou've had to rewire\nand then seeing the benefits of having\nnew\nbelief systems in your own life where\nhave you seen that in a big way a failed\nbelief that you had to\ntransform or upgrade a good example i\nthink\nin my life has been my interaction with\npatients\nso i've got a couple strikes i'm uh i'm\na doctor\nso i'm you know sometimes you know i\nthink i know everything\ni'm a surgeon which is basically\ncontrolled arrogance\nokay right because if you don't want to\nhave a tepid surgeon in there really\ndarling around\nyou got to take a knife and cut somebody\nthat you have to have unbelievable\nconfidence that's the right thing to do\nuh and i'm a guy which is a third strike\nokay because\nso because you know we mansplained for a\nreason right because we think we got\nit all worked out don't ask directions\nall that stuff so you send a mail\ndoctor surgeon into a room and talk to a\npatient we're going to tell you the\nanswer\nand then expect that you got it and move\non because i know not you heard me tell\nyou the answer you'll\nyou'll act accordingly yes and that\ndoesn't happen doesn't happen in the\nhospital doesn't happen in real life\ndoesn't happen with schools and\nrelationships or anything else\nthat we really care about people do not\nchange based on what they know\nthey change based on what they feel so\ntrue\nand you can't fix a feeling until you\nhear it\nso the failed belief on my part was i\ncould cut corners\nbe fast about it tell my kids the answer\nbark something to my wife\ntell the patient what to do stop smoking\ni mean please i mean if it was that easy\nthey would have done it\nthey know it's not good for them they\ndon't need to tell them it's bad for\nthem\nquite the opposite they feel guilty when\nyou remind them that they're incompetent\nand couldn't stop smoking\nand then to deal with their self their\nfailing and their self flagellation they\ngo out and smoke to relax\nso if you're really going to get people\nto change and this gets back into the\nfundamental psychology of change which\nis\nit's not the psychology of freud which\nis about how messed up you are because\nof your parents\nit's not about the beautiful wonderful\nwork that's been done in the mid part of\nthe last century\nuh that helped establish the\nfundamentals of why we think the way we\nthink\nand why archetypes are so important to\nus and why faith is\nultimately so essential to our\nwell-being faith in anything\nourselves something bigger than us and\nall the things that go along with that\nbut but the psychology of change is\nabout the very seemingly pedestrian\nissue of how you get people to something\ndifferent than they were going to do\nbut it drives all politics it drives a\nlot of decisions that are being made\ntoday all marketing is based on this\nbut it is also the main reason we have\nconflict in our relationships\nbecause men marry the women exactly they\nwant\njust the way they want her and then she\nwants to change\nand women marry the man they think he\ncan become and he won't change\nright yes and then women are all from\nthe moment you're married\nyou're moving apart from each other yeah\nand you've got to find ways of\nreconnecting\nafter the chemical handcuffs come off\nwhich is about seven years\nthat's about enough time to bear a\ncouple children and get them to an age\nwhere they can actually\nchip in a little bit not run off the\ncliff right but at seven years that\nchemical handcuffs fall off the oxytocin\ndopamine serotonin they go away\nand now you actually are left with who\nyou really are and if you can't figure\nit out because you don't understand the\nemotions drive it\nit seems self-evident but think about\nhow you communicate with each other\nyeah so i'm going to tell someone stop\nsmoking i don't tell them they're stupid\nfor smoking i tell them do\nyou do you care for yourself as much as\nthe people in this room who brought you\nhere care for you\nif you really loved yourself you would\nstop but even more importantly\nif you love the people who are around\nyou your stops you'll be there for them\nwho's going to walk your daughter down\nthe aisle who's going to keep your wife\ncompany when she gets frail because\nshe's going to need you\nso if now with that mindset here a\ncouple tactics that might work we'll\nstill give you the tools\nyeah sure but you'll use them now with a\nbit of passion\nand that is the fundamental way we get\npeople to adjust their lives and\nwhen we try to ignore that that's why\npolitics is so fascinating\nbecause people emotionally already know\nthe answer\ntheir answer may not be your answer but\nit's their answer then the facts are\njust there to defend it\nthat's why people have the exact same\nset of facts and have opposite answers\nbecause they can manipulate facts it's a\nclassic line\nthere's statisticians damn statisticians\nand liars\nyeah right yeah actually i said it wrong\ni'm sorry i got it wrong it's liars\nuh i'm not completely\nthat's why i said it again it's liars\nyeah i don't have to edit if we all make\nmistakes it's liars damn liars and\nstatisticians\nright right and uh because the\nstatisticians are ultimately not that\nthey want to do it but they can\nmanipulate\nanything to say anything and if you\ndon't deal with the underlying emotions\nof why you feel a certain way about\nabortion or gun control or inequality or\nimmigration\nthen you're not the facts are who cares\nyou can change minds with facts\nsometimes\nbut it's uncommon absolutely how have\nyou seen\npurpose linked to health choices\nin people's lives it's the best best way\nfor you to identify\nthat part of your purpose is to better\nthe planet to bring light to us\nthis is a rabbinical concept and judaism\nmay speak to this\nthat you know your goal is to bring\nlight and you have to challenge yourself\nare you bringing light to the world or\nnot\nand we can get petty all of us can uh we\ncan make mistakes\nbut if what you're fundamentally trying\nto do is to lift the burden\nthen you're doing good and one of the\nbest ways you can do that is through\nyour own body\nbecause you either are an albatross or\nin the neck of the people who love you\nor you're leading the path forward\nand the big insight that people don't\nacknowledge but i'll share with you\nright now\nis people who hang with healthy people\nget healthy people hang with unhealthy\npeople get sick\nthat's why when people when couples\nmarry\nthe the wife will generally lose some\nhealth because she takes better care of\nherself in general than he does\nand his bad habits rub off on her right\nwe want to flip that\nmove it the other way yeah because once\nyou figure out\nthose basic simple steps which are much\nmore tangible and visible\nwe can all get up and walk half an hour\nin the morning and if you didn't walk\nyou didn't do it\nthen from there your meditation well how\ngood is your meditation well you know\nyou can be yourself about it\ntrying of course is the most important\nthing but walking the 10 000 steps is\neasier to measure quantify and\ncheck the box on that did you get to a\nplace in meditation\nthat you were aiming for and then did\nthat translate to living a life of\nawareness and fulfillment well that's\nyou know that's hard right people spend\ntheir whole lives and don't get there\nwhich\nyou know maybe you're never supposed to\nget there then and on and on\nuntil you finally get to a place where\nand i've seen this especially in older\npatients\nwhere you did what you wanted to do that\nthere's a\nserenity a peacefulness and\ni i see that as in especially in people\nwho say i've i\ni've i've done enough i don't need to\nhave my life saved anymore\ndr oz i know you can operate on my heart\nand make my valve better but\nit's not about that yeah people that i\nloved i loved\nmany are gone the things i needed to do\ni got past i'm ready for the next\nchapter\nand i pray that i'll one day be able to\nget there for most of us\nthinking through this podcast right now\nwe're not there but we better take the\nsteps so that we'll one day\nbe that otherwise what's it about\nabsolutely\nyeah i love that okay so dr oz honestly\ni could talk to you for hours like\nyou're fascinating like this is\nwe've we've got it we've only got the\nfinal five left now which is our quick\nfire rapid fire round that we end\nevery episode with but genuinely i hope\nwe can do this again\ni look forward to it i'm gonna have you\non the show yeah absolutely and i'd love\nto develop this friendship too because\nyeah you're fascinating to talk to i\ncould literally sit and listen to you\nfor hours so\nthese are the final five the first\nquestion i want to ask you is your\nfather actually set you up with your\nwife\ntell us a bit about that uh the best\nthing i ever did was marry my wife\nokay and uh i remember meeting her in a\nrestaurant because my father\nis meeting her father for dinner they're\nboth heart doctors\nsurgeons and she she she walked into the\nrestaurant i was in love with her\nimmediately she thought i was the maitre\nd\nand i didn't want my father to have any\nsatisfaction thinking he may have\nintroduced me to my wife this is a\nyou know classic this discord you should\nhave i think\nif you're in a healthy father-son\nrelationship uh and\nso i dated her secretly for a while\nuntil one day he was giving me a hard\ntime\nand saying you know you're always\nworking you're not focusing on things\nreally matter i'm interested in that\nwonderful woman you didn't even\ntalk to her and i finally acknowledged\nhim but not only was i talking to her\nthat i was but\nwe were dating and i was going to marry\nher and i did within a year\ni love that great question number two\nyou've been married for over 30 years 34\nyears\n34 years which is incredible tell us one\nof the biggest lessons that has helped\nyou\ncreate such a long-term relationship\nalso successful it seems like you're so\nhappy\nmy father-in-law this my father-in-law\ntold me that i should give it on the\nsmall things because when the big\ndecisions had to be made i'd be giving\nit on them as well\nso i shouldn't know what it feels like\nbut the bigger\nthe bigger message i i didn't respect\nthe yin-yang\nof marriage i didn't need lisa to be\ngood at what i was good at\ni needed her to be good at what i was\nbad at yes this is\nvery thoughtful about deeper spiritual\nissues\nshe went to theology school columbia she\nyou know if you look at her bed stand\nit's\ndeep the deepest of the deep wow and\nthat's pleasure reading i mean she's\ndevouring young just as a you know\nafternoon on a sunday just to remind\nherself about some of the basic premises\nand i'm trying to catch up on\nplaying football with my son i'm very\ntactical yeah\nand i needed her to tell me what to aim\nat back to our initial comment about sin\nand until i really respected that's what\ni needed to fill the\ncolor in the lines of who i am and it\nalso puts my responsibility to me to\ncolor in her lines\nabsolutely then if you do that together\nthen we're both satisfied\nand so i see and because of that i now\nactively seek out people who are\ndifferent from me\nmm-hmm because i don't need to get\nbetter at well and with people who are\ngood at what i'm doing i need to get\nbetter at things i'm really bad at\nabsolutely love that question number\nthree what is the most used app on your\nphone\nmost used app i mean it's the\nmessaging apps yeah because i'm always\ntalking to folks and i find it\nincredibly valuable to ping people that\ni miss\nyeah and i i don't ping them just to say\nhey you know you owe me something i ping\nthem to remind them that there's stuff\nthat's important\nthat we got to focus on in life my kids\nsay i'm too clingy\nyeah but but i i feel an obligation\ni love that number four walk us through\nyour morning routine\ni get up every morning around six uh\ni'll do yoga for about seven minutes\ni say seven minutes on purpose because i\nknow uh i know i always have seven\nminutes i'm not gonna admit to myself\ni'm so disorganized i don't have seven\nminutes\nyou won't either jay or anyone or anyone\nlistening um so seven minutes we can\nalways start and by the time you start\nyou're almost done\ni do a sun salutation with some\ncalisthenics push-up sit-ups\nif i have more time i'll work out for an\nhour i'll go down to the gym and you\nknow we have a gym in our\nvlog and i'll manage it if not then i'll\nuh\nget off to work then i don't eat any\nbreakfast don't have any coffee i have a\nlittle lemon juice and water\nis all diabetic treatment by the way get\nyour gastric your juices flowing\nuh around eight o'clock 8 30 a couple\nhours later i feel a little hungry\ni'll have your blueberries i don't have\nany coffee or any caffeine\nuntil later in the day and i'll\nchallenge everyone who can hear my voice\nto do the same you don't need caffeine\nwhen you first wake up the alarm just\nwoke you up\nthe toothpaste must have could have\nhelped in the shower for sure will get\nyou up\nyes that's just a cultural issue and if\nyou can't go for more\nwithout for two hours without coffee\nyou're addicted\nso audit that in yourself around 9 10 in\nthe morning have a cup of coffee i'm not\nagainst caffeine\nbut recognize that it's not actually\ngiving you energy it's withdrawing your\nenergy from energy banks\nso you make it a cultural issue make it\na pleasurable item\nyes i'm not making something you have to\nhave first thing in the morning and then\nfrom then on i'm automated uh you know i\nmake the shows\nuh i nap every day it's done oh wow let\nme just share that with your audience it\nis the most valuable thing i've\ni've done in my life i used to nap even\nat the hospital when i had a chance\nbut you can go leonardo da vinci never\nslept through an evening but he would\nnap every day\na couple times so a nap is much more\neffective than caffeine or\ncarbohydrates or any of the other things\nyou may try in the afternoon eight hours\nafter you awaken so for us it's about\ntwo in the afternoon\ntake a five ten minute nap it'll change\nyour life wow i love that\nand fifth and final question if you\ncould set the world\nan experiment they had to do for 30 days\njust one thing that they had to do for\n30 days in a row what would it be\nsleep better and it's much harder than\nyou think\nuh work at it it's worth the investment\nyour creativity will be dramatically\nincreased\nand here's the best part uh you you'll\nwork hard because you probably do anyway\nyou'll work smart\nand everything will turn out better\nbecause you'll be able to connect the\ndots more impactfully than anybody else\nand sleep with something you do by\nyourself only you can do it uh but don't\nshortchange yourself\nyeah i love
