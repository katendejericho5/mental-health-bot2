through your body which means\nprior to that\nyou were tense you were holding on to\nlife\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you\nthat come back every week to listen\nlearn\nand grow now today i have the\nhonor and privilege to sit down with one\nof my favorite authors\nsomeone who has impacted millions of\nlives over the last couple of decades\nand someone that i was just sharing with\ni never believed i'd ever get the\nopportunity to sit down with\nbecause back in 2006 and before when i\nwas reading her work and\ninteracting with the work that she was\ndoing in the world i never believed i'd\nget this opportunity and so today i feel\nextremely grateful\nto be sitting down with the one and only\nrhonda byrne\nand for those of you that don't know and\ni mean they'll literally be like 0.3\npercent of you that may not know\nthere's an internationally renowned\nbest-selling author\nthat is best known for a documentary and\nbook titled\nthe secret ronda's work has massively\ntransformed\nmillions of lives around the world and\nher newest work\nis a continuation of her previous\ninsights\nand it's called the greatest secret i've\njust finished reading this book\ni genuinely cannot wait for it to be in\nyour hands\nand so we'll be putting the link to the\nbook uh with the podcast so make sure\nthat you go and grab this whenever you\nhave that moment during this\nconversation\nuh that you are accessing the greatest\nsecret ronda welcome to\non purpose and thank you so much for\ndoing this\noh jay thank you so much do you know as\nyou were doing that intro i got very\nteary because\nuh just uh when you're mentioning\nchanging the lives of millions of people\ni really to this day you know it\num it just affects me it's so humbling\nand uh i'll i'll receive a letter from\nsomebody and it's honestly it's like the\nvery first time\nthat i've read a letter and somebody's\nlife has changed and\nit's never altered over the years it\njust affects me the same way so\ni just had a total meltdown listening to\nyou then so\nthank you that's amazing i i love\nhearing that\nbecause i i feel so similarly that\nit's such a honor and and humbling\nopportunity to have an impact on anyone\nand so\ni i love hearing you say that and it's\nso beautiful and\ni i know i heard recently that you\nactually moved\nand you moved home is that true i was\ngoing to start there because i almost\nfeel like\nthe act of moving is such an\ninteresting journey in and of itself\nphysically mentally emotionally\nspiritually\nand i wanted to ask you what your move\nwas like\nand what that journey was like on each\nof those levels well i love it because\nyou always end up by throwing material\nthings out you know i don't need this\nand i don't need that so\nit's it's a real cleansing to move i\nthink and go through everything\nand i don't need any of these things\nanymore and and i mean sometimes i give\naway things and then i'm like oh gosh i\nreally didn't need that but\nwho cares you know who cares but do you\nknow\ncan you believe this i moved\num next door to where i was\nnext door right that great is that crazy\nand so um i'm on and\ni'm on a property that is uh\n85 acres of orchards and avocados and\noranges and lemons and all of those\nthings\nand what absolutely gets me all of the\ntime in life and i never\ntire of it is the way that\nlife or the universe always lines up\neverything i've ever loved in my life\nand so always always absolutely always\nlike open fires and this property has\ndeer\nwalking all over it and for me coming\nfrom australia we don't have deer in\naustralia\nand so it's just oh my gosh so amazing\nto wake up in the morning and there a\ndeer outside\nmy bedroom window and i mean just\nsquirrels jumping everywhere and\nso yeah i it was um it was\nreally really beautiful a beautiful move\nactually\nand it was effortless absolutely\neffortless\num and uh and kind of a new\nyou know when you move it's sort of a\nnew but then at the same time\nyou take you with you wherever you go\nright and so um and so\nit's always really good to just be\nworking on the\ninner part of ourselves because then\nwhen you take you with you\nyou have a fabulous life\nwhat was the thing that you were happy\nto let go of\nphysically or emotionally of that space\nand\nwhat was something that you rediscovered\nmaybe that you'd forgotten about that\nyou thought oh i actually am excited to\ntake this with me\nactually i had moved a year earlier so\ni'd had a massive plans when i moved\ni had been in a really really really big\nhouse for like 15 years\nand so that was amazing because i was\njust giving away\neverything do you would you like this\nwould you like this\nand so this move wasn't as great um\nbecause\ni'd already cleaned everything out for\nthe year before and so let me think\ni mean the things that i loved about the\nhouse that i was in\nwas the incredible sunrises and sunsets\nand that i got to see those\nthat house had massive orange trees\neverywhere\nand so the orange blossom was absolutely\nintoxicating\ni think jade you know all the things i\nlove in life are the things that are\nfreaky\nyou know they're not they're not\nanything that kind of money buys\nand um and the house was that i was in\nwas full of light um and absolutely\nbeautiful\nbut then the house that i've moved to\nand it didn't have open fires to the\nother house and i love open fires\nanother house that i've moved to has\nopened fires it has all of the light\nit has the orange trees the orange\nblossom\nit has a beautiful view across\nthe ocean ocean front views so it has\nthe sunrises and the sunsets and\nuh so it's just everything kind of lined\nup for me\nwith with the house that i'm in um after\nbeing in the previous house but i'm\ntrying to think of things that\nyou know really i think i just gave away\nmostly kind of clothes and things like\nthat\nand a few appliances and\num yeah just just sort of things like\nthat you know\nnot her in my previous house i gave away\neverything i gave away barbecues and i\nwas like saying to people do you need a\njuicer do you need this do you need that\nand i was just giving away absolutely\neverything which i love\nand you know when i moved from australia\nto the united states\nthis was just prior to the secret being\nreleased\ni came with two suitcases that was\nit i left my home everything that i had\ncollected over gosh 20 years or whatever\nit was\ni left it all behind and i came here\nwith two suitcases and it was for the\nrelease of the\nsecret and i just intuitively knew\nthat the united states would be the\ncountry that lit the secret up first and\nthat i needed to be in the states\nso uh so i tr i traveled here i had two\nsuitcases\nand then everything that i owned back\nthere i gave it away\ni gave it all away absolutely everything\nyeah except for two things\ntwo things that i that i ended up by\nhaving shipped over\nthat one you can see behind me there\nthat tapestry\nright can you see that yes yes i could\nsee it and see\nand see that border yes that border\nand those two things those two things i\nbrought with me they were just like\nreally special to me but\neverything else i gave away so i'm\nreally good at letting things go and\njust\nactually i'm great now letting things go\num especially especially material things\ni'm not really attached jay\nanymore you know i used to i had\ndecades of attachment and um\nand i don't think attachment in the end\nis a lot of fun\nabsolutely i mean it's really beautiful\nand i have\nall of open space here and i think that\nthat\nreflects the way that i feel inside and\nmy journey of the greatest secret\nis just like this freedom and\nand openness to life and just this trust\nand faith\nin life this total faith that life has\ngot\neverything under control yes\nwell let's let's start there at the\nbeginning of the greatest secret\nyou you share this beautiful thought\naround how\nyou know what keeps us from the greatest\nsecret\nis a belief\nand i really liked how\ndespite the incredible success of the\nsecret\nyou've continued on this journey\nto continually seek for a deeper secret\nand the greatest secret as you call it\nand you say that a belief has been\nblocking us\nthis whole time from this secret tell us\nabout this belief\nwhere does this block of a belief come\nfrom\nand how is it created such a strong hold\non each and every single one of us well\nthe belief is that\nwe are separate and that we are\nindividual\nand that all that we consist of all that\nmakes us up\nis just a body and a mind and i think\nthe majority of people\nwill consider that they're a body and a\nmind\nand the name that they've been given and\nthe story\nuh of their life and i was born here and\nparents did this and i do this for a\nliving and siblings and\nthe story that we then ca we identify\nwith\nand carry around with us and and\nand those stories this story it doesn't\nmatter what the story\nis it doesn't matter how fabulous your\nlife has been\nit does not compare to who we really are\nand so we have this belief that we\nare limited basically in a nutshell that\nwe're a limited individual that we're\nborn and that we die\nand and that's kind of it and the truth\nis we're\nwe are so much more than that we are\ncertainly having the experience of being\nan individual\nand we're certainly having the\nexperience having a human experience\nbut ultimately it is not who we are and\nwe were never born\nand we never die and\nwe are if i were to sum\nup everything that we are it's almost\nthe opposite\nto everything we strive to be so we are\nall the\nintelligence that there is we are all\nthe beauty that there is\nwhere all the happiness that there is we\nare pure love\nwithout any judgment whatsoever um\nwe are complete and utter freedom\nwhich is why freedom means so much to us\nwhy we will fight and struggle\nto be free uh and so we\nand and we have total knowing of\nabsolutely everything in the moment of\nknowing it\nwe are infinite and we are eternal and\nthat\nis what is actually experiencing\nthis particular form and so we have a\nbelief that we are an individual that\nwe're separate that we're born\nand that we die and our mind\nreaffirms that over and over and over\nagain through all of its thoughts and\nwith everything we say with every\nthought and\nevery single thing that we say and\nactually doesn't the world\naffirm that over and over that we're\nthat we're separate um\nbut we are unlimited we are absolute\nperfection\nand and i'm not talking about the name\nor the ego i'm not\ntalking about that because we we all can\nsee what egos can get\nup to you know they can get they can\ncause a lot of trouble\negos why egos want approval they want\nattention and they want to be right all\nthe time\nthey judge all of the time and so you\nknow\nthey're not they're not something to uh\nto attach ourselves to\nand to identify with when we\nare this incredible being that is\nlists full happiness and so\num and so we can\nhave a life where we are\nliving as an individual human\nhaving an individual human experience\nbut from the perspective of the infinite\nbeing that we are\nin which case we will never be touched\nby negativity\nno matter what happens and we will\nremain\nin lasting happiness no matter what\nand it is and this has been my journey\nreally from the secret to to now\num and i was searching seven days a week\ni was jay i'm just like i was just like\none of those crazy people and like if\nthis there is this law that governs our\nmind\nthen there is definitely way way more to\ndiscover\nand so i just searched and searched for\nreligions and spiritual traditions and\nread thousands of books\nand it was until 2016\nthat i had this experience where i\nrealized who we are and\ni was like why haven't i seen this\nwhy haven't i what is it how could i\nhave\nmissed this and uh and from that\nmoment of realizing that there was this\nhappiness\nthat arose inside of me and then with\neverything that i did from 216\nto 220 that happiness just became deeper\nand deeper and\nand then i would just notice things like\nthat person\nyou know when they would do something or\nother they used to bother me a lot that\ndidn't\nbother me anymore and how was i ever\nbothered by that\nand that particular subject doesn't\nbother me anymore and\nso i was just finding that i wasn't\nreacting to life\nmy the reactions were all dissolving i\ndidn't judgment was dissolving i was\njust whatever was happening i'm like\nit's fine it'll be okay and\nand so with letting go of all of those\nthings\nincluding the belief that we're a\nlimited being\num we become free really truly free\nand then we will live a life that's\ndescribed as heaven on earth\nor nirvana um a life where we know we\ndon't die\nand the body ends sure but\nbut who we are does not and so yeah\nthat's been that's been my journey\nbetween my journey well well it's\nbeautiful hearing it because\ni was very fortunate enough to\nat least learn about that intellectually\nwhen i was 18 and i first met the monks\nthat i lived with\nand then when i went and lived as a monk\nfor three years in india\nand across europe when i was 22 to 25\nthe text that we studied\nuh whether it's the vedas or the gita\nintroduced me to that at least\nintellectually\nand i say at least intellectually\nbecause i believe\nthat a lot of these ideas begin\nintellect\nbefore they truly become realized\nyeah you're absolutely right and um and\ni think in 216 you know it was\nit was and it was a realization of who i\nam but had i\nwas i completely living that no i\nremember thinking oh my gosh i've lost\nit\nnow you know i i had it and now i've\nlost it\nand of course you can't lose it because\nit's who you are you know\nbut you've got to go you've kind of got\nto go on this a bit of a journey\nyou don't have to there are some people\nthat\noh gosh they will just hear it and\nthat's it they will leave it\nthey will live like that for the rest of\ntheir life yeah and\nthey they just enjoy and i've had some\nletters from\nfrom some people that that has happened\nto you\nfor me it was more of a journey and\nuh but oh wow when you\njust in it definitely intellectually\nis the beginning and there's nothing\nwrong with that\nat all because that's where right that's\nwhere you start\nand then and then it's sort of the\ndiligence to\nkeep noticing um who you are\nnoticing awareness you know noticing\nuh asking yourself am i aware is\nyou know one one way one way to begin am\ni aware\nand even in secret i talk about that you\nknow remember to remember\nthat you're aware and to be aware and so\nit you just keep coming back to noticing\nwho you are\nit's so interesting because when you\nnotice who you are you feel this\nabsolute relief\ntravel all through your body which means\nprior to that\nyou were tense you were holding on to\nlife you know the kind of white knuckle\nand everything\nand so um i mean i just\noh my gosh it's just like this\nincredible thing that we\nthat we have and and and then you know\nand then you look out and you see people\nsuffering\nand um and that part's you know really\nchallenging because\nyou you you want to help everybody and\nso so that they don't suffer anymore and\num i remember with my teeth i remember\nwith my teacher really early on\nand i would be like oh i've lost and\ni've lost it and\nand uh and why don't i have it all of\nthe time and she said\nshe would say oh because you haven't\nsuffered enough is what you\nsay to me you need to suffer some more\nyou know\nand then and then you really really\nreally it's going to mean more to you\nthan anything else in in life and\nuh yeah it's a it's it's a wonderful\nthing but oh my gosh\nin your 20s jay heaven i remember\nlearning that definition which you\ndescribed so beautifully of sachitananda\nand the idea that we are full of\nknowledge\neternal and full of bliss and i remember\none of the ways we were trained\nto understand that is we had no mirrors\nin the ashram\nand without a mirror you lost conception\nof your physical self because\nyou no longer could check how you looked\nand\nthe other one was i remember when i\nfirst started i would and i know you\nused the beautiful word\nawareness in the greatest secret i\nremember i used to write on a little\npost-it note\nwhen i'd wake up in the morning i'd have\nit next to my bedside table and then on\nthe\nuh by the place where i brush my teeth\nthat i am awareness\nyeah yes that's beautiful yeah to remind\nmyself\nto remind myself in the morning to wake\nup with the understanding that i'm not\nthis body\noh brilliant that is brilliant people\nshould do that\npeople should do that i mean that is\nabsolutely fantastic\nyeah i am awareness because the moment\nthat you say\nlike our mind can't comprehend awareness\nit can't it can't comprehend that the\nmind is sitting in awareness and so\nand so the really beautiful thing is is\nthat saying something like i am\nawareness or am i aware\nthe mind just goes quiet you know just\nreally quickly\nand one when the mind's quiet then all\nthat there is is awareness or\nconsciousness or\nwhatever if the word doesn't matter you\nknow i tried to choose the word that i\nfelt was the simplest that people could\nkind of understand\nbut the moment the mind drops there\nthere is awareness and so and so\nah i love that i am aware i love it\noh thank you yeah it was i you know it's\nthat's why when i was reading your book\nand i hope you can tell like when i was\nreading your book i felt so happy\nuh because when you were sharing this\nwas the greatest secret\ni i couldn't agree with you more i i\ndon't think there is\nis a deeper secret at the beginning of\nknowledge and we were always we were\nalways told that\nthis is the first lesson you'll learn\nand and the one that will take your\nwhole life to live\nlike to actually practice uh\nand and and and so when i was reading\nthe book i was just it was so beautiful\nfor me because\ni i could totally see how much you care\nfor people and and for what journey you\nwant them to take but isn't it\nfascinating that\nwe almost and you said something really\nbeautiful and you talk about in the book\nabout how\nactually we are free and we have\ncomplete\nfreedom but we limit ourselves but isn't\nit fascinating that we\nthink that the body and mind keep\nus safe so like the very things that are\nactually keeping us\nimprisoned we think that they are our\nsafety\ntotally and don't you think you know\nalso with\nwhat's happened in the last year that\nthat we had this idea or or\nor most people have this idea that they\nwork really really hard\nto get safety and security you know to\naccrue things and to have money in the\nbank and to have a house and all of\nthose\nall of those things to have safety and\nsecurity\nand this world event that came along\nshook that\nand actually showed everybody what is\nthe truth\nand that is that we will never find\nsafety and security in the world\nand the reason we won't is it's always\nchanging\nalways changing but\nwe are the only safety and security in\nexistence\n[Laughter]\nwe're trying to get on the outside what\nwe\nare on the inside and that is not to say\nto to enjoy this incredible world\ni mean this is a miracle this is\nmiraculous this\nthis experience of this world and it is\nhere for us to enjoy\nin every way that each person wants to\nenjoy it\nbut to know who we are\nto to instead of\nspending our whole life trying\nto fill ourselves from the outside world\nwhich will never\never work is to spend just\na little bit of time on the inside like\nwaking up to i am awareness and\nor asking am i aware and one of the\nthings that i found\nthat was really fantastic and there's so\nmany incredible practices and i'm sure\noh my gosh she would have done so many\nfabulous ones i would love to hear about\nthat\num one of the things that all of the\nthings in the greatest secret all\nof the things that i did and the\nteachers that are in the greatest secret\nwere my journey all of them from the\nsecret through to now\nevery single one of them changed my life\nin in one way or another some i followed\nfor a couple of years and\num and some for a month and but all of\nthose\nteachers played a really really big part\nin my life\nand so the practice in the greatest\nsecret\nthat had the greatest effect on me and\nthat i would say for\nanybody is the best thing you can ever\never ever do\nand that is to never resist negative\nemotions\nand instead to do the exact opposite\nwhich is what we have not been told to\ndo which is the opposite to resistance\nis to welcome so resist is push away\nand welcome is to pull in\nembrace yeah embrace exactly exactly and\nto\nembrace those negative emotions because\nthe most\nincredible thing happens when we do\nembrace them\nwhen we allow them to be there when we\ndon't try and change them when we don't\ntry and\nwhen we don't want to make them go or or\ndo\nanything but just allow them to be there\nthey just evaporate\nthey just evaporate and the more that\nyou do it the faster they evaporate\nbecause when i started\ni would feel a strong emotion and it\nwould maybe last 30 seconds 45 seconds\nor something like that\nand then gradually gradually ever way\nbut the more that i welcome the\nweaker they get each time you welcome a\nnegative emotion just gets weak a week a\nweek or weaker\nuntil you don't have a trace of that\nnegative emotion\nin the body at all anymore and when you\ndon't have a trace of it you're never\ngoing to feel it\nexplain to us as you do in the book what\ndoes it mean to truly\nembrace and welcome a negative feeling\nwhat does that mean in\npractice because i i couldn't agree with\nyou more\nand just to help people as they're\nlistening and watching the thinking you\nknow what i just right now i'm just\nthere's so much negativity in the world\ni'm watching the news i'm stressed out\nabout this my kids are at home\ni'm having to homeschool how do they\nwelcome that and and i agree with you\nwe resist completely we don't want to\nfeel negative\nwe don't want to because it's not\npleasant you know feeling negative\nfeelings so\nand so when you when you feel a negative\nfeeling arises in you\nnotice the feeling don't focus into the\nfeeling\nbecause if you focus into it you'll just\nmake it stronger the mind is really\npowerful\nso don't focus into it but notice the\nfeeling\nand so and just welcome it so it's\nalmost like\nyou could imagine just putting your arms\nout like this\narms out to the side of you and just\nallowing the feeling which is\nsimply energy that's all it is even fear\nit's just energy and just allowing it to\npass on through\none thing that i did was i\nwould imagine putting my arms\naround and embracing the feeling and\nand pulling the feeling in close to me\nand i just found that that was amazing\nfor me i think people can try all kinds\nof different things like\ni just imagine that that feeling was one\nof my oldest dearest\nfriends that i loved so much that i\nhadn't seen\nin decades and they arrived at my door\nand i was just like could not get my\narms around them fast enough\nand that is what i imagined with each of\nthe feelings and i mean\nat one point in my life i did that with\ndepression and so i wrapped\nand that's really how i learned how\npowerful this practice is\nbecause uh when i wrapped my\narms around the depression it just\ndissolved\nand her and the relief i\nmean the relief that you feel when the\nnegative feeling dissolves\nis so good it's worth every it's like a\nhigh\nand the heart and the reason it's like a\nhigh is because when you dissolve\nthe feeling there's you underneath and\nwho you really\nare and so you get a flash of who you\nreally are this kind of\njoy and happiness and so yeah that's\nwhat i did i would embrace the feeling\nand hold it in without focusing on it\nnotice it but don't focus into the\nfeeling\nand and just let it dissolve and i\npromise the next time you feel that\nfeeling\nit will never be as strong when you do\nit and so you do the same thing the next\ntime that feeling arises\nand then the time after that it's going\nto be weaker it just gets weaker\nand weaker and weaker until you get to a\npoint where you're like\ni can't remember the last time that i\ngot angry\ni just can't remember when did i ever\nget angry\nyou know you're just or agitated or\nimpatient\nor and so you do it with every feelings\nso\nso my to give people a really good guide\ni would say that unless you're feeling\nreally happy joyously happy welling up\ninside of you\nyou have a negative feeling pretty good\nyou don't need to know what the name of\nit is to welcome it\nyou just welcome you it doesn't matter\nabout its name it doesn't matter what it\nis\njust welcome the feeling or embrace the\nfeeling or allow the feeling\nto be there and then you will begin to\nresolve dissolve these negative feelings\nthat are actually masking who you are\nthe more you dissolve them the greater\nthe happiness the rises within you\nbeautiful i love that and i encourage\neveryone right now who's listening and\nwatching to\nto do that practice to give it a go to\nexperience it and experiment with it\nbecause\nwhat rhonda's saying is is something\nthat it needs to be experienced it needs\nto be felt\nit needs to be put into practice it's\nit's not something that you need to\noverthink or overanalyze\nactually do it and and feel it and\nyou'll figure out how it\nworks for you rhonda i'm intrigued what\nwhat is the first thing you do in the\nmorning\n[Music]\nto start your day what is it that you do\nthat you feel\nstarts your day because i feel that a\nlot of the times what i'm noticing\nespecially now in the culture we live in\nwhether it's reaching for our phone\nwhether it's looking at the news\nwe're starting our day with energy\nthat's\nalready putting us in the wrong\ndirection or pushing us in the wrong\ndirection\nwhat are you doing what are you\nencouraging people to do first thing in\nthe morning\nto start with this understanding that we\nare awareness to start with this\nunderstanding that\nnegative feelings need to be embraced\nit's so amazing because the first thing\ni do\nnow is i lay in bed and\nas awareness so i be\nawareness and i just lay there for a\nparticular amount of time\njust feeling the joy\nand the freedom of the eternal being\nthat we are\nand uh and just lay in an awareness and\nso that's what i do\nabsolutely every single morning and\nwhat's extraordinary now\ni mean at the beginning it was like i\nfelt like i had to remember to\nremember to do that but that doesn't\neven kind of make sense but\ni that's what i felt i felt like i had\nto remember to do it\nand now at the moment i open my eyes is\njust\nawareness just fills the room and the\njoy just fills the room\nand so i lay i lay in that prior to that\ni would wake up every day in gratitude\nyeah\nyeah prior to that was gratitude was\nand you know jay even now if life gets a\nbit\num bumpy or something happens just\nsomething not really negative but just\nsomething where everything isn't flowing\nthen i will just\nlook at gratitude and and through\nawareness just be so grateful\nfor the fact that we are this infinite\nbeing and that\nno one dies i'm so grateful to be aware\nof this and to know this\nit's quite you know it's that's also\nquite humbling\nthat somehow or another in this lifetime\nis that i had this awakening and\nrealization of this\nand um because as you say i agree with\nyou 100\ni there is nothing greater than knowing\nwho you are\nthere's nothing there will never be\nanything greater than that\na thousand years from now 10 000 years\nfrom now\nnothing will be greater than knowing who\nyou are and being who you are\nand it's just step by step little step\nby step\nand now's a really good time because\nthe ego is being challenged the mind is\nbeing challenged as being hit on all\nsides with\nwith the disharmony and the and the\ndisruption\non the planet and so now is the best\ntime\never to really like welcome those\nemotions and\nand to look toward to look in the\ndirection\nof who who you are instead of who you\nare not\nyeah absolutely absolutely and and i\njust want to address because i feel like\nsomeone may be listening to us and\nthinking well\nwell rhonda j how does this help me\nbe successful be happy live the life i\nwant how does\nyou know how does this create it and i\njust wanna and i wanna dive into what\nrhonda's going to have to say about this\nbut\ni just want to address it from from how\ni see it\nthe understanding is very simple that as\nrhonda's saying we're not our body and\nif we think we're our body\nwe will surround ourselves with things\nthat\nare good for the body but if we're not\nthe body then none of those things can\nactually satisfy us and\nan example that we'd always learn from\nthe vedic tradition was\na fish out of water that if you took a\nfish out of water\nyou could give it a mansion you could\ngive it a car you could give it\njewelry you could give it money but that\nfish will die\nbecause it's not in water it's not where\nit belongs and it isn't\nin its natural habitat and and so\nsimilarly\nunderstanding that we are awareness\ngives us the opportunity\nto do what is right for us as awareness\nto truly feed that awareness because\ni think the challenge that we think\nabout when we think about success or\nhappiness we\nthink of success and happiness on the\nbasis of the body and the mind\nand that's why even after accumulating\neverything\nwe still feel dissatisfied because those\nthings\nonly touch the body and mind correct\nrhonda correct\ncorrect and and and really the best\nthing that could happen to everybody\nis that their greatest dream comes true\nbecause when your greatest dream comes\ntrue the dream that where you are\nabsolutely convinced that when this\ndream comes true\nthat is when i will really be happy the\nbest thing that can happen is that dream\ncomes true\nbecause when it does you will realize\nthat there is something missing and that\nhappiness that you thought you would\nhave\ndoesn't last and so it's\nyou know it's it's it's such a beautiful\nthing and for people who have been\nsuccessful\nthen they get to that point and they're\nlike they're not happy\nand they're not happy because those\nthings were never going\nto make you happy in the first place\nanyway and so\num but in terms of success\ni would say this that\nwhen you are who you really are when\nyou're\nliving from the place more of who you\nare than who you are not\neverything that you need and want\nwill fall into your hands effortlessly\nand\nyou are actually the infinite being is\neffortless\nand the way to kind of tell who's in\ncharge\nis whether it's the ego or the mind\nthat's in charge\nor or who you really are that is in\ncharge in any moment\nis effort and if you're efforting if you\ncan feel this efforting\nthen it's the ego and the mind and if\nyou're coming from a place of\neffortlessness\nwhere athletes call it being in the flow\nand everybody has these kind of\ndescriptions\nit's where the mind has stopped and just\neverything is flowing you just feel like\neverything in the universe\nis just dancing your dance and singing\nto your song\nand so in terms of success when you are\nbeing more of who you\nare that idea that was going to make you\nsuccessful\nis what will come to you that original\nidea\nbecause the mind just recycles\nthat's all it can do it's a program and\nrecycles\nand the ideas that business kind of\nbusiness ideas\nthat have never been on earth they are\ncoming from awareness\nthey are coming from above the mine so\nwhen you are\nawareness that is when everything will\nfall into your hands everything that you\nneed\nand it just your whole life flows and\nyou're just happy\nall of the time like there is it's just\nlike the universe\nis just saying and i even wrote in the\nsacred you know\nthe shortcut to the secret is be happy\nnow\nright just be happy let go of all of the\nthings that that you're saying why you\ncan't be happy\nand just be happy now because when\nyou're happy\neverything just everything just falls\ninto place\nit's so amazing so definitely for\nsuccess\nthat is the fastest fastest way\nto success is to be who you are\nand um it's not you don't we're not\ntalking about going in a cave or\nyou know or doing anything like that we\nare talking about living\nyour life in the incredible form and\nhuman being\nthat you are and having the experience\nthat you are\nbut from a place of knowing that you are\nthe infinite being\nthat you are immortal and we are taught\nas jay said\nit's got to be through your experience\nit can't be\nthrough oh i heard you know want to talk\nabout this and whatever no\nnot interested in you taking on another\nbelief\nwhat what it is is for you to experience\nit and it is not hard for you to\nexperience it because\nit's who you are already it's not\nanything that you have to go out and get\nin some ways it's almost frustrating\nisn't it\ni remember when i started it out i'm\nlike it's who i am already but\nat the time you know it'd be like i can\ntell the minds\nmind's taken over at the moment and yeah\nit's\nalready who we are and so we've just\nwhat we've done is we've attributed\neverything that is awareness to the mind\nwe've given the mind the whole thing\nand it's awareness that is hearing these\nwords right now\nthat is what's hearing these words right\nthat\nis what he's seeing uh through these\neyes\nit's awareness it's without awareness we\nwouldn't even know we're alive\nexactly well that's that's the thing\nrhonda that\nyou know i've i've heard a lot of people\nsay that when they first saw an autopsy\nor they\nwent to a funeral that's when they\nrealized they weren't the body like that\nwas\nwhen they've if you've ever if you\nhaven't seen an autopsy i recommend\neveryone finds a way to visit the\nhospital and see\njust to see to see that allows us to\ndisconnect from we're not this physical\nbody we get that\nbut i feel that for a lot of people like\nyou rightly said\nit's difficult to think we're not the\nmind because\nlike you said we have given the mind\nall of awareness we think that that is\nus so so i think a lot of people are\ngetting to the understanding that we are\nnot this body\ni think i think people can get there to\nsome degree at least in their mind\nbut then a lot of us struggle to get\nbehind well if i'm not the mind then\nthen what else is there tell us about\nhow you\nstart seeing the the the\ntell us about how you start seeing the\nfallibility of us thinking we're the\nmind so let's just investigate and look\nat the look at the mind and what the\nmind is and so it's really good for you\nto find out what the mind is\nespecially considering that most of us\nhave given a total authority over our\nlife\nand we believe all of the thoughts that\nit produces\nand which is the voice in your head and\nthe voice in your head is\nnot who you are so that was a really big\nrevelation for me\nso so all that the mind is made of is\nthought\nbeginning to end full stop it's thought\nand so\nit's memory which is thought and it has\nimages\nwhich is just thought in pictures but\nit's still thought and the current\nthoughts that we think\nuh and so all that the mind is is made\nof thought\nand so without a single thought\nand check for yourself the mind isn't\nthere\nif there's no thought there's no mind\nand so\nwhen you begin to look at that and\ninvestigate that\nthen it's really quite interesting but\nthen so\nso now we know that the mind is just\nthought\nand therefore when a thought comes and a\nthought goes\nif we were our mind\nthen that means that when a thought\ncomes and when a thought goes a little\nbit of us would go with it\nand then when a thought comes and the\nthought goes a little bit more of us\nwould go with the thought if we were our\nmind a bit of us would be disappearing\nwith every single thought but if you\nlook at it guess what\nyou are there aware before a thought\ncomes\nand you're there after it leaves so how\ncan you be the mind and the other thing\nis\nwhat is aware of the thoughts in your\nhead\nawareness is aware of the thoughts in\nyour head because a thought\nis not aware a thought has no awareness\nwhatsoever\nand so the one that is aware of the\nthoughts\nis who you really are and so when you\nstart to and just sort of\nsit with this a little bit i'm not\nsuggesting that\noh in this moment you're like oh i know\ni'm not the mind\nbut if you just kind of sit with this\nand next time when you've got a whole\nlot of thoughts coming through your head\nthat you remember this and\nand and think about it oh i was\nhere before all of these thoughts and i\nam here\nstill here after they go fully intact\nnone of me has disappeared and what was\nit\nthat was aware because you could you\ncould even ask this question\nam i the thoughts that i think or am i\nthe one that is aware of those thoughts\nwe never say i mind we say my mind\nor my body or we say my car\nbecause we realize that we are not it\nright you don't say i mind you you know\nso it's\nit's so clear to us in our even our\nlanguage that it's\nmy mind that means my mind belongs to\nsomething that\nis me and hence the question is who am i\nbecause it's my body and my mind and i\nthink\nwhat you just shared so beautifully is\nexactly that is that\nit is something that is existing\nbeyond the purview of the mind and\nthought simply\nand for anyone who's wondering and\ntrying to intellectually wrap their head\naround this\nthe reason why it's so powerful\nto understand this is because then\nthe negativities of the mind and the\nbody\nstart to affect you less because you\nrealize that they are not you\nand that they are not your life uh\nand and that's the key that you know if\nanyone's wondering well how does this\nhelp me that's how it helps you is\nbecause you start to recognize\nthat what happens to the body just like\nif your car has an accident you may feel\na little bit of pain but you don't feel\nthe same pain as when something affects\nyour body directly\nand that the car is a shell and so\nsimilarly you start realizing that i'm a\ndriver inside my body\nand my mind and so even though my body's\nhurt yes obviously i need to go to the\nhospital and take care of it of course\nbut that still isn't me no and um\nand you know lester levinson who is in\nthe um\nwho's no longer in physical form but\nwho's quoted in the greatest secret\nand he would say that uh that\nour mind is was is just being created\nfor one reason and one reason only\nand that is to create what we want\nthat's it full stop\nthat's its job that's its tool to create\nwhat we want in this life and what we\nwant to experience\nin in this life and that it's not\nour psychiatrist psychologist\npsychotherapist\nand tells us what to do and and\nbelieving our thoughts\nand hi jay i believe my thoughts for\ndecades\nit's just amazing that you would believe\nthese thoughts in your head\nand and if if people just notice the\nnext time and i hope there's no next\ntime but that you feel agitated\nor negative emotional feel stressed it's\nbecause you were believing a whole lot\nof negative thoughts\nthat's it you were just believing\nthoughts\nand and then that sends you you know\ninto\ninto negativity and so our\nfreedom is the mind is wonderful\nfantastic tool\nnothing wrong with the mind the only\nproblem comes with the mind is when we\nthink it is who we are\nthat's the only problem and and you give\nthis analogy which i loved you talk\nabout\nhow we're in this dream state uh\nand there's a need for awakening from\nthat\nbecause when you're\nasleep right when you're asleep and i\nthink a lot of people feel that\ni think people right now feel an\nawakening in their life\nthat's coming tell us about the\nawakening you're speaking about i just\nthink you\nknow when you've woken up i just think i\nknow\nwhen you've woken up because um like if\nyou're wondering oh am i asleep now have\ni woken up\ni just when you wake up you feel\nincredible you feel so much lighter than\nyou've ever felt\nyou feel so much freer happier uh\nlife just becomes miraculous everything\nis a miracle the little things that\nthat you just kind of ignored before now\nare just things that will bring you to\nyour knees\nbecause the sheer beauty and love of\nthose things\nlike sunsets and i remember in my life i\nwould hear people speak of\nthese things and i remember i used to\nthink oh you know i just need to be able\nto pay my bills you know\nforget about sunsets and all that kind\nof thing you know\nbut uh but as you\nas you awaken it's it's uh\nit frees it just frees you from\nall of the all of the limitations and\nall of the conditioning that we've all\nhad in our lives no one's to blame for\nthat\nit's just kind of part of the journey\nand\nyou you just you just become free\nthe feeling is incredible and you and\npeople can have lots of little\nawakenings can they not you know along\nthe way like a little\nand it's usually when you've seen\nthrough\nsome belief that um you're like oh my\ngosh i used to believe that and that\nisn't true\nand then you just suddenly feel lighter\nand freer and so awakening is just a big\none of those it's just a huge sort of\nrealization\nit's it's like a wow moment but instead\nit's a\nwow wow wow\neveryone can have it there isn't anybody\nthat is\nthat that can't have it everybody can\nhave it because it's who you\nare already what are some of the daily\nrituals that people can do\nto experience what you're speaking about\nbecause as we both know it's not\na it's it isn't a life hack or it isn't\nan\napp download or it isn't a you know it\nit isn't it isn't a mechanical\noperational\nlogistical read this three page\nyou know it's not that so what is it\nlike how do we\nmake it more tangible for our tangible\nminds because our minds are wanting to\ndo something\ndaily and repetitively because it is\nrepetition there is repetition\nwhat would you say we can do daily well\none of the things that\nthat you can do which which\nreally helps disidentify with\nthe body and the mind is to is to\ntake so let me see so first of all take\nyour body\nand um and just put your body aside over\nthere\nbecause you are not the body so just\nlike put that aside\nfor the moment that is not who you are\nyou you can\npick up the body in in a minute or two\nbut just put the body aside\nand then put aside your name and the age\nand the description of you\nand also put it put it aside the story\nof who you think you are put all of that\naside so now the bodies aside the\nstories aside\num all of those other things are aside\nnow what you're going to do\nis you're going to take the mind and\njust for a moment you're going to put\nthe mind aside\nand that includes all memory and all\nthoughts\nand all feelings and you're just going\nto put that aside as well\njust pop that aside and now very quickly\nnotice what is left\nbecause what is left is awareness\nand so that is one way\nthat's a really good way in the\nbeginning to come back to\nawareness and it's like i think in\nancient tradition some of them spoke\nabout it's like peeling the\nonion right so instead of us\naccruing we all we think we have to pile\non all this knowledge and everything\nwe go go through life and you know i\nneed to learn more and i need to accrue\nmore and\ni need to get all of these degrees and\nall of that has its place\nbut it's never going to set you free and\nso\npeeling away what we are not and\nseeing awareness is what will set you\nfree\nand once you can get to the place i mean\nhonestly the way that i did it\nwas and i i put it in the book and it\nwas three and it's three\nsteps i would ask myself multiple\nmultiple multiple times in the day\nam i aware and the moment i would ask am\ni aware\nawareness would be there there would be\nthis awareness\nand then i would go about my day and\nthen i would ask again\nam i aware so i did that constantly\nthat's a practice to do constantly\nafter a while actually really short\namount of time\num days really uh or a week\nor two weeks when you go to ask am i\naware\nyou can't even ask the question because\nawareness is just\ncompletely there immediately like\nimmediately\nand so the second step is the first step\ntransforms into the second step so you\ngo from\nasking the question am i aware to\nautomatically\nnoticing awareness so then lots of times\nin the day\nnotice awareness and then the third step\nis stay as awareness\nand the second step merges into the\nfirst step\nbecause when you notice awareness enough\nthen you're going to find that you are\nstaying as awareness more\nand so what happens is just so people\nunderstand\nwhat happens is the mind is kind of in\nthe\npotentially for many in the foreground\nat the moment and sort of\nrunning your life and um an awareness is\nso quietly beautifully\nmagnificently quietly sitting in the\nbackground\nbut when you ask the question when you\nnotice awareness stays awareness\nwhat happens is there's a total shift\nand awareness comes to the foreground\nand the mind goes to the background and\nthat way you can use the mind whenever\nyou need to use the mind it's great to\nmake a date like for\nus doing this podcast it's really great\nfor things like that\nbut then you can stay as awareness and\nthen your life is just absolutely\neffortless and you just have incredible\nhappiness and\nthat's that's where it all is i love\nthat rhonda that's\nit's been beautiful discussing this with\nyou because\ni love that you really i really do\nbelieve it is this you're really\nchallenging all your readers and and the\npeople in the world to go\nbeyond yes uh the body and the mind\nwhich really means to go beyond the\ndesires of the body and the mind which\nis\nreally difficult because we've been\ntrained to believe that the desires of\nthe body and the mind are what will make\nus happy\nand so i i can you know i commend you\nand and feel\ngreat joy that you're putting this\nmessage out there and encouraging people\nto go in this direction\nand i want to ask you now what we call\nthe final five these are your final five\nquestions\nand we do them in a fast five rapid fire\nso\neach answer each answer has to be\none word to one sentence maximum\n[Music]\nso so rhonda these are your final five\nand

number four\nif you could create one law that\neveryone else in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\nhappiness is mandatory\nyeah that's right i would have the law\nof happiness because then everything\nwould be totally fine\ni love it and question number five final\nquestion beautiful very quick\nconcise answers very very clear and\namazing uh fifth and final question\nwhat is one truth
