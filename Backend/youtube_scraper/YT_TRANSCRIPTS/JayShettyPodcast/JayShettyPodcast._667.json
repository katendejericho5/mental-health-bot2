    "transcript": "all we have right now is time and our\nattention\nso where our attention goes needs to be\nreally carefully thought out therefore\nthat's where self-knowledge comes in as\nmy compatriot socrates\nsaid the unexamined life is not worth\nliving so we need to examine our lives\nexamine our habits without judgments\nand just begin with microsteps\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you that come back\nevery week to listen learn and grow now\ntoday we have\na really special and exciting guest one\nof the few people\nthat we've ever had on the podcast twice\nit is none other than my dear friend\nmentor and someone who i consistently\ntell you changed my life\nthe one and only ariana huffington now\ni'm so thrilled because ariana is the\nceo and founder of thrive global she's\nbeen named as the world's 100 most\ninfluential people by time magazine and\nhas also been included on the forbes\nmost powerful women's list she's a\nmother best-selling author\nbusinesswoman as well as a dear friend\nof mine\nand today we'll also be talking about\nthrive global's latest book\nyour time to thrive if you're someone\nright now who's been\nstruggling working from home remote work\ntrying to figure out how to manage the\nstress of everything we've experienced\nin the last 12 months\nthis is the book for you this is the\npodcast for you\nif you're someone who's sitting there at\nhome right now thinking jay\ni just don't know how much more i can\ndeal with this this\nis the conversation you want to be\nlistening to ariana welcome to the\npodcast\njay so great to be with you i\nlove every day reading and watching you\nspread wisdom\nmaking wisdom viral i love that\nwell i'm so grateful to you especially\nnow as we were just talking about the\nwonderful\nthrive original top you're wearing\nonward\nupward and inward i love that as a motto\ni think that's a\nbrilliant mantra and motto it's very\nmuch what your work has been about to\nremind us that when\nwe go inward our journey\nonward and upward is better in\nevery possible way it's so true it's so\ntrue and\none thing i love that we're having this\nconversation today ariana is because\nyou built thrive global and\nby the way i just want to remind\neveryone so my first day\nin new york city was ariana huffington's\nfirst day of starting up thrive global\nariana i don't know if you remember\nwe were at the final party like a\ncelebration party of\nyou uh moving on from huffpost and\nstarting thrive global\nand and you said in your speech you said\nwhether you've been here since day one\nor whether you just joined yesterday\nlike jay shetty\nuh i want you to know that uh you're all\npart of the family\nand i remember just seeing you go off\nand start this new company\nthis new organization destined to\nhelp people's well-being in their daily\nlives at work\nyou must be feeling like the purpose of\nthe company\nis coming alive right now more than ever\nactually jay you're absolutely right and\nyou know anytime you\nleave something established and\nsuccessful to start something new there\nis a risk involved\nand i remember actually um\nagonizing over that decision and\ntalking to sheryl sandberg and she said\nto me\nstop thinking about it just close your\neyes and jog\nand sometimes that's what life requires\nof us\nand the themes that we build thrive\naround you know ending the stress and\nburnout\nepidemic uh making well-being\nan essential and central part of our\nlives\nhave now become more important than ever\nthey've really gone\nmainstream because the pandemic\nhas forced everyone whether individuals\nor\ncompanies to recognize you know how\nfoundational our well-being is to\neverything and\nand finally jay ending the delusion\nthat in order to succeed we have to burn\nout we have to power through exhaustion\nwe have to be always on which is simply\nnot supported by science or data\nor ancient wisdom absolutely absolutely\nand and i think\nthe level of burnout that we've seen in\nthe last 12 months\nand i would like to mention that whether\nthat's companies that are\ngrowing or struggling in the last 12\nmonths certain companies\nwent through their biggest growth curve\nin the last 12 months and their\nemployees have experienced burnout\nand then other people obviously were\nlaid off what are some of the trends\nthat you've noticed over the last 12\nmonths of how people are experiencing\nburnout and stress and pressure what\nhave you been seeing through the data\nthrough your company's work in what are\nthe biggest challenges that people are\nhaving\nso what we're seeing is that all the\nchallenges we were facing pre-pandemic\nhave been exacerbated which is a bad\nthing but also a good thing we can no\nlonger avoid dealing with them\nand the primary challenges that we're\ndealing with\nare first of all the mental health\ncrisis\nwhich existed before the pandemic but\nnow\nit's right in front of us\nwith the hundreds of millions of people\naround the world being affected with\ndepression anxiety\nand also the skyrocketing increase of\ndiseases\nespecially diabetes and heart disease\nand which also have become\nmuch worse because of the stress levels\nbut also it\nforced us to realize that\nwe are never going to be able to deal\nwith the mental health crisis\nor all these diseases if we don't go\nupstream and change our behaviors\nand that's why we wrote this book to\nmake it clear to people that changing\nbehaviors\nthrough microsteps you know small daily\nincremental steps\nis very doable to actually take\nlofty goals like i'm going to lose\n30 pounds or give up sugar or\nwork out every day and break them down\ninto the smallest possible actionable\nstep\nwe call our micro steps too small\nto fail and there are eight chapters\nthat break down all the micro steps\nand the first one because jay i believe\nit is foundational to our well-being is\nsleep\nand as you know i'm an evangelist\non sleep we all sleep and\nincreasingly during the pandemic we've\nall had a harder time\nsleeping or falling back asleep after we\nwake up in fact there is a term\ncalled corona insomnia\nbut there are small daily steps\nwe can take to improve our sleep\nand to reduce the stress which makes it\neasier to sleep\ni i'm so glad that you brought up sleep\nand corona insomnia which i which i had\nnot heard actually but\ni i know when i read your book sleep\nrevolution\nthat really gave me the permission to\nfeel like i needed quality sleep it\nreally did that like\nwhen i read it and you share the stories\nof so many of your friends\nceos of large companies all over the\nworld who\nprioritize sleep one of the things i\nfind right now the reason why people are\nstruggling at home to sleep to practice\nwhat's a micro step they can take\ntowards better sleep\nand i love your idea of micro microsteps\nbecause\ni practice it in my own life and your\ndefinition\nactually is the best definition i've\never heard of a microstep of\ntoo small to fail because if you fail at\na step then it wasn't micro enough\nand so that's a great great definition\nwhat's a great micro step we can all\ntake towards getting better sleep during\nthis time\nso jay actually out of all the hundreds\nof micro steps in the book\nmy absolute favorite is\nto pick a time at the end of the day\nthat you declare the end of your work\nday\nand to mark this end with a ritual\nbecause you know we are creatures of\nrituals\nand the ritual turn off your phone\nand charge it outside your bedroom\nnow you may say to me you know ariana\nthat's too big a microstep for me\ni say not a problem jay can you pick\none day a week when you can do that\nmaybe\nfriday night or saturday night just\nstart\nwherever you are if you say no ariana\nthat's too big a step for me i say okay\ncan you just put your phone on aeroplane\nmode\nbut instead of putting it on your\nnightstand which 72 percent of people do\nput it somewhere further away so if you\nwake up in the middle of the night\nand you can't immediately go to sleep\nmost people jay go to their phone\nand that's like allowing your day life\nwith all these challenges and\nand the problems to invade your night\nlife\nwhich is the time to really deeply\nsurrender to sleep and recharge\nso that's my favorite microstep that\nthat's a brilliant micro step\nand i love how compassionate and\nempathetic you are in\nin simplifying it and making it easier\nevery time\ni love that micro step i i think it's\nabsolutely brilliant and i love\ni remember years ago you built those\nbeautiful thrive\nfoam beds yeah they're fantastic phone\nbed is great\nif anybody listening has children and\nthey are about to be given their first\nphone\nwe have this charging station that looks\nlike a little phone bed you can put the\nphones under the blanket tuck them in\nand reconnect in the morning\nso you teach your children like phone\nhygiene\nwhich is this your phone and you don't\nsleep together\ni think it's brilliant i i think it's\nsuch a it's such a\ncool idea and you've made it you've made\nit trendy again for people to know how\nto have these habits and i think\nwhat i like about your approach ariana\nis that it's very real\nand and even that it's almost comedic\nit's funny it's it's playful it's not\nit's not like this harsh discipline it's\nnot military there's this\nthere's this love and joy behind it i\nsee on instagram you're always posting\njoy triggers\ni always pass your joy triggers\nyou are my i love it you're my go-to\nplace for joy triggers\nand we both we both recognize the\nimportance of joy in fact\nyou know for me jay um\njoy is a barometer of how i'm doing\nit's like at some point in my life i i\nknew i could be effective and productive\nright i didn't have to prove that to\nmyself anymore\nso my test now is am i bringing joy\ninto my daily life i'm not talking about\nall the time\ni mean i'm dealing with challenges i'm\ndealing with problems\ni'm working on my own reactivity you\nknow i'm a work in progress\ni'm on this journey but if i can't find\njoy in what i'm doing\nit means that i need to course correct\nit's almost like a sign for me to course\ncorrect\nand that's like the key to all our micro\nsteps uh\nto recognize that um\nwe all have this place of wisdom peace\nstrength in us it's like our birthright\nright\nand nobody lives there all the time\nand the opportunity now is to be aware\nof when we are not there and how quickly\ncan we course correct it's almost like\non course\nof course on course of course and a\njudgment-free zone\nyeah absolutely i feel like right now\neveryone's judging themselves to be the\nperfect\nperson the perfect partner the perfect\nparent\nand it's exhausting because we're all\ndealing with something that we've never\nexperienced before no one's ever been in\nthis situation before\nin history and and here we are\nwhat are some of the ways we can become\nmore loving to ourselves\nmore more empathetic to ourselves at\nthese times because like you said you\nyou're asking yourself how can i bring\njoy into my life\ni think a lot of people are asking\nthemselves well maybe i'm not working\nhard enough with my kids or\nmaybe i'm uh you know maybe i'm not\nworking out enough or maybe i've been\nhow do we how do we train ourselves out\nof that or how do we approach that and\nnavigate that properly\nwell as you know jay the first step is\nto accept where we are and not judge it\nand loving ourselves is kind of a\nprerequisite for really truly loving\nothers out of our overflow\nand so for me\num gratitude is the antidote\nto anxiety to stress to guilt\nso i practice what in the book we call\nhabit stacking so anytime i'm doing\nthings that don't require my brain\nlike washing my hands washing the dishes\nwashing my hair i repeat to myself\nthings i'm grateful for\nlike right now i'm having my bulletproof\ncoffee i don't know if you like\nbulletproof coffee but i love it\nand i'm grateful for this every morning\ni'm grateful that i'm here with you and\nthis is um\nit fills my heart and\ni'm really very grateful every day that\ni\ni do work that is meaningful\ngoing back to on purpose and has an\nimpact on people's lives i feel\nextremely grateful for that\nso remembering all these things\nconstantly literally jay as you know\nmoves us from the sympathetic nervous\nsystem the fight-or-flight nervous\nsystem to the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem\ngratitude and anxiety cannot coexist\nwhat i love about this moment we are in\nis that modern science is validating so\nmuch of\nancient wisdom\nif you take um what i've considered the\nhero feature in our app\nand in the microsteps book is the 60\nsecond reset\nand i love the fact that if you tell\npeople you know can you take 20 minutes\nto meditate they may throw their arms in\nthe air and say ariana i don't have the\ntime to take 20 minutes to meditate\ncan you take five minutes to meditate oh\nthat's really hard\ndo you have 60 seconds\nwe break it down to 60 seconds\nand 60 seconds\nanother favorite microstep in the\nmorning\nbefore you go to your phone 60 seconds\nto set your intention for the day to\ntake deep conscious breaths\nto remember what you're grateful for\nanything kind of almost like\nreconnect with yourself before the world\ncomes at you\nand so that is\nat the heart of every religion if you\nlook at um\nislam let's take islam i mean the call\nto prayer\nis kind of unbelievable it's like these\ntiny\ninterventions during the day when you\nhave to get up from what you're doing\nstretch which is great and\nreconnect with something larger than\nyourself\nand every religion you know judaism\nchristianity buddhism have like these\nshort\nmoments you know that having been a monk\nand that bring us back to center so we\nwe've integrated that in our app and in\nthe microsteps\nfor anybody who um\nfeels overwhelmed with their to-do list\nor their zoom fatigue or whatever\nthey're dealing with\nthat's that's such a brilliant piece of\nadvice and i love how\nagain no one can say they don't have 60\nseconds\nand it's amazing that you spoke about\nislam there for a moment\ntoo because i was recently in dubai\nwhere the call to prayer is happening in\nthe morning and throughout the day the\nfive times a day\nand i went skydiving for the first time\nin my life\nand the free fall is exactly 60 seconds\nand so for anyone who doesn't say that\n60 seconds is a long time it's enough\ntime to get your intention right in the\nmorning it's a brilliant amount so\nthe the skydive was 60 minutes uh sorry\n60 seconds of\nfree falling and then six to seven\nminutes\nof parachute falling once the parachute\nis released\nand now that you're saying that i when i\nwas in that 60 seconds of freefall\ni was trying to meditate and pray and\nand experience\nand you can achieve a lot in 60 seconds\nand so i think that that is such a\nfor anyone who's there going well you\nknow 60 seconds what am i going to do in\nthe morning\nwe don't realize we pick up this within\nthree seconds\nor one and a half seconds and so 60\nseconds in the morning that is such a\nbrilliant invention because just being\npresent with yourself and letting\nyour heart rate naturally get up letting\nyour brain actually wake up\nletting your mind wake up that's such a\ngreat micro step\nand now we've brought it into our team\nmeetings at thrive\nso we start our team meetings within 60\nseconds\nand we have um everybody can create\ntheir own reset like you could create a\nreset with pictures\nthat you love of your wife your um loved\nones\nquotes music everything and in 60\nseconds you are reminded of what you\nlove about your life so we play this\nsomebody from the team plays their reset\nwhich also connects us to each other so\nthere's so much we can do\nthat connects us with ourselves connects\nus with others\nand doesn't take a lot of time\nwow so every meeting starts with someone\nsharing their 60 seconds i'll send you\nmine\njust to see you know my daughters\nmy favorite quotes like roomie live life\nas\neverything is rigged in your favor\nlandscapes of greece\nmusic and a breathing pacer 60 seconds\ni love that i mean every company should\nbe doing this this is brilliant i love\nthis advice and i hope\neveryone who's listening and watching i\nhope you're thinking about your zoom\ncalls\nand how you can start your next zoom\ncall with your company set differently\ni hope that you can recommend this to\npeople within the company\nariana tell us a bit about that let's\nsay some of our listeners\nare inside an organization but they're\nnot necessarily a\nleader or a senior manager how do they\naffect\nchange you've you've worked at the\nbeginning of a company you've owned\ncompanies you've sold companies you now\nhave a new company\nyou have employees at all different\nlevels how does someone more\njunior in an organization create change\nwhen it comes to health and wellness\nso one of the great things about this\ntime jay\nis that these questions of well-being\nand transformational change within\ncompanies\nis no longer just the province of hr\neverybody's talking about it\nfrom the c suite to every intern\nso anybody can raise their hand\nthere is such a greater opening to\npeople expressing how they are feeling\nif they need help and come up with ideas\nto suggest\nand anybody who\nwants more ideas please reach out to me\non instagram linkedin\nyou know any any medium of communication\nand that we are happy to send you a lot\nof ideas in fact we have partnered with\nzoo\nand zoom is bringing thrive reset\nas a downloadable app so that anybody\ncan actually download it and be able to\ncreate their own reset\nbut even without that anybody can\nhave these 60 second protocols for\nanybody who is maybe thinking oh this\nsounds like warm and fuzzy you know for\na\nhigh growth um company\nlet me just tell you um i was\ninterviewing mark benny of yesterday on\nmy podcast he's an investor in thrive\nand we were talking about how he starts\nmeetings\nwith closing his eyes for a minute\nand everybody around him knows that he's\nnot zoning out\nhe's not going to sleep he's just coming\nfully present\nto tap into what is best in him his\ncreativity\nhis empathy his best idea so\nwe i always like to make it clear that a\nlot of hyper\nsuccessful people use these small\nmicro steps to make them even more\neffective\nand that these things are not like for\npeople who just want to chill under a\nmango tree\nabsolutely no i i think these uh i love\nthat you've built an app\ninto zoom that's a thrive reset i think\nthat's fantastic i\ni think that we live at a time where we\nneed these\ndigital tools to remind us of being\nmore present with our physical mental\nand emotional and spiritual selves\nbecause we've become so wired to our\ndevices we need our devices to help us\nin that process\nhow have you found though ariana that a\nlot of people just feel this\naddiction to scrolling and you've worked\nwith tristan who is obviously the social\ndilemma i remember when you\nintroduced me to tristan's work years\nago before the social dilemma even came\nout\nuh tell us a bit about that approach\nthat you've seen through your micro\nsteps\nwith people's addiction to scrolling\nendlessly like me and you look for joy\ntriggers\nbut what if people are just scrolling on\ninstagram and tick tock and losing\nthemselves in that\nhow have you found to help people remove\nthat addiction from their lives\nwell first of all it is a real addiction\nand that's why our second chapter in the\nbook is called\nunplugging and recharging you know how\ncan we unplug\nfrom what has become\nso dominant in our culture basically\neverybody in our lives is competing with\nour foe\nyour wife your children uh your friends\nyou know it's as though this thing is\nthe most\ninteresting thing in our lives and we\ncan't separate ourselves from it\nso as thick not han said\nyou know it has never been easier to run\naway from ourselves\nyet at the same time we can use\nparadoxically digital\ntools to help us disconnect from\ntechnology\nit is a paradox but truth is often\nparadoxical\nso you know the reset example\nis one of them but the fundamental\nproblem of our addiction\nbecause it is real requires us to take\nsteps\nfor example if you are particularly\naddicted to\nto instagram\ntake it off your front page\nso that you have to download it you have\nto be intentional to go there i mean\nthere are great stuff\nthere's great stuff on instagram uh\nreally i mean i i love following you and\num and i get joy\nfrom the quotes and from everything you\nhave but there's so much\nthat leads to comparisons that makes\npeople feel less than\nand that it's just something\nwe need to honor and love ourselves\nenough not to expose ourselves to all\nthat because\nall we have right now is time and our\nattention\nso where our attention goes is it needs\nto be\nreally carefully thought out and\ntherefore that's where self-knowledge\ncomes in\num as my compatriot socrates\nsaid the unexamined life is not worth\nliving so we need to examine our lives\nexamine our habits without judgments\nand just begin with microsteps\nyou know if you can't take him um\na social media account you're\nparticularly addicted to off your phone\ncan you move it to gray\ncan you and all notifications that are\nnot personal i have no notifications on\nmy phone i don't get breaking news\nbecause\nfirst of all 99 of the time it's not\nbreaking\nand and second anytime i don't want to\nbe\nconstantly interrupted that's how we\nneed to see that\nanytime i want to get the news i go get\nthe news\nbut it's on my timing yes i love what\nyou said there of\nsetting the time of when do we want a\npiece of information when do we want to\nreach out to this person\nwhen do we want to connect with this\nidea\ni think that that what you just said is\nintentional\ncurated living and unfortunately our\nworld has made us\nunintentional livers we live\nunintentionally and\nunconsciously where we're just exposed\nto whatever anyone feels like exposing\nus to\nand then you know you may not be in the\nright mindset to take on some breaking\nnews and\ni loved what you said half the time\nbreaking news is not even breaking news\nit's it's\nit's just trying to get our attention uh\ntell me about\nariana what's what do you think has been\nyour\nbiggest challenge in the last 12 months\npersonally and\nalso what has been your biggest\nopportunity that you've seized and that\nyou've gained and grown within the last\n12 months\nso um the biggest challenge has been\nthat thrive has been growing very fast\nso i had to hire a lot of people\nthat i have never met\nyeah that's crazy isn't it it's crazy\nyou know i'm\ngreek i want to break bread\nand look you in the eye and i had to\nhire a ceo wow\nand a head of business development and a\nhead of sale i mean literally very\nsenior positions\num that i have never met\nand that took um\ntook some kind of developing some new\num intuitive abilities\nand being able to look in the eye\nthrough zoom\nand and like\ntrust these feelings that you\nyou want to trust when you are hiring\nsomebody that goes beyond their resume\nand their references the\nthe best thing has been that\nin this year of incredible pain and\ngrief we can never\nunderestimate that you know it's it's a\nit's been a year of unbelievable losses\nlosses of life financial losses\nand we also have a catalyst for\ntransformational change\nand as you know jay transformational\nchange is hard\nlike we have known for a while that we\nhad to change the way we work and live\nthat the breathless flanatic way we're\nliving is not sustainable\nwe have known for for a while that the\ngrowing inequalities\num in our country are unsustainable\nand unjust racial inequity we've known\nfor a while\nabout the existence of these problems\ni've been to so many conferences about\ninclusive capitalism etc etc\nplanetary sustainability but so\nlittle has been done and now as somebody\nsaid a crisis is a terrible thing to\nwaste so we have an opportunity to use\nthis crisis as a catalyst for\nfundamental change\ni i agree i what really resonated with\nme\nwith what you were saying is this\nchallenge of\nhaving to create human connection\nthrough digital media where we've never\nmet someone i think that is a really\nit's truly i've i've also made mistakes\nin that department in the last 12 months\nbecause in the same way my work was\ngrowing and i've had to think about\nhiring and recruiting through through\ndigital and i haven't got it right\nmany times because yeah your intuitive\ncapabilities through a screen i mean we\nknow each other we've\nspent time together and so this is very\ncomfortable\nyeah what are what are some of the\nquestions\nthat you've asked people that you think\nwere really powerful that people\nhere today if they're listening or\nwatching could use\nin their digital meetings with people to\nhelp understand people better what are\nsome of your favorite questions and\ninterviews\nor questions and conversations that you\nfeel have helped your intuitive\nabilities\nso if you're going to to work with\nsomebody\nand for me the most important thing is\nwhat is our number one cultural value at\nthrive\nand this is compassionate directness\nthis is my my number one cultural\nquestion\nbecause in any relationship\nwhether personal or professional things\ncome up that you are not happy with\nand you know that frustrate you\ni mean you've talked about it even with\nyour beloved wife you may you may have\narguments disagreements you need to have\na way to express them\notherwise they're faster and they become\ntoxic the same applies to professional\nrelationships and if you are not able to\nsurface discontents frustrations\ndisappointments\nand express them you can't deal with\nthem\nand jay it's much harder for people to\ndo that\nthan uh than it sounds\nso i tried to dig deep\ni asked for examples where they they\nwere able to be direct with the manager\nwith anybody it's not just with the\npeers uh to express to disagree\nand i feel cultures that\num have achieved that\nare healthy thriving cultures and\notherwise\num a lot faster\nif you come to me if you work a thrive\nand you come to me\nand complain about someone in the\ncompany\neverybody knows and say okay let me just\nbring them in\nor let us just all get together on a\nzoom and talk about it\ni don't want to hear about it without\nthe other person being present\ni don't accept anybody coming to me to\ncomplain\nwithout that other person being there so\nthat everything can be out together that\nfor me is number one\nunless you know somebody comes and\ncomplains about something\nillegal or egregious or sexual\nharassment or something i'm talking\nabout the everyday\nuh complaints of people who work\ntogether\nyes yes absolutely absolutely i\ni uh it's so when you talk about your\nvalues so strongly and i love that\ncompassionate directness again it's yes\nyou a paradox be compassionate you don't\nwant to be adversarial but you want to\nbe that way\nyes how do you find that are you\nare you good at that you know what\nariana i've realized that recruitment is\na completely\ndifferent skill to the\nattracting of energy in your life so i\nfeel like me and my wife have\nvery similar values and we've found that\nthankfully and\ni have really good friends and i have\nreally good\nrelationships but i find that\nrecruitment is a is a real\nchallenge uh it's it's difficult to\ntruly understand\nif you can be of service to that person\nand if that person is also going to\nserve with the same values and\ni think i'm learning i think i'm\ngenuinely speaking i'm learning i'm\nreading a lot about it that's why i'm\nasking you about it is very useful and\nand i like how value-centered your\napproach is\nbecause i think today also what's really\ninteresting is\ni was hosting a panel for linkedin the\nother day or multiple panels\nand one of the biggest talking points\nwas around\nthe difference in well-being needs of a\ndiverse organization\nso realizing that people from different\ndemographics different genders different\nbackgrounds different walks of life\nneed different support and well-being\nwhat are you seeing in\nhow well-being and diversity affect each\nother in the programs that you're\nimplementing especially when it comes to\nunconscious bias it also comes to a\nlack of sensitivity to understanding\nsomeone's background\nwell we actually um have a whole\ntraining around the connection between\nwell-being\nand diversity because what we have found\nscientifically is that when you are\nexhausted\nand running on empty you are less\nempathetic\nyou are the worst version of yourself so\nyou are less\nlikely to be open to people who are\ndifferent from you\nand to create a culture of belonging\nbecause diversity is not just a question\nof numbers\nit's creating a culture of true\nbelonging where everybody feels at home\nit's not just to have so many african\namericans and so many asians because\nwhat's the culture like yeah how calm do\nthey feel\nhow do they connect with everyone so\nthat\nagain micro steps\nuh going back to the recruiting\nconversation\nand that applies to people applying for\njobs\nas much as to people uh hiring\nnever never enter that conversation if\nyou are tired\nno it sounds very simple but any time\ni've interviewed and i'm tired i miss\nall the subtle things yes yes and also\npsychologically\nyou just want to cross one more thing of\nyour to-do list\nand so you are like um more likely to\njust say okay good that sounds good\nenough\nespecially in times like we're living\nthrough now\nwhen we can't just do maintenance\nlike these times are challenging\nwe need to be able to access our\ncreativity\nand our empathy and the the best in us\nand and that's why it's more important\nthan ever to prioritize our well-being\nhow do you know as someone who's been so\nsuccessful\nhow have you known when to push\nand when to press pause because i feel\nthat\nas you're on a journey of acceleration\nand growth\nand momentum even when you're doing what\nyou find purposeful like i love\nwhat i do but i work really hard at it\nand i've over time i've had to\nunderstand this this balance between\npushing and pressing pause\nhow have you find that like how does\nsomeone know\nwhen to push forward when to work a bit\nharder when to stay up at night\nversus when to start pulling back how do\nyou find that balance\nwell first of all um jay i've\ni've done it wrong so many times\nincluding as you know finally collapsing\nfrom doing it wrong and keeping my head\non my desk and breaking my cheekbones so\ni learned the hard way and through a\npainful wake-up call\nand what i'm clear about now is first of\nall there is no such thing as balance\n[Music]\nit's not like you can balance you know\nyour work your life is\nthe same every day that doesn't exist\nagreed\nthe key is\nwhat are the baseline things you need to\ndo\nto show up your best for me\nmy baseline is sleep\nand the science on sleep is categorical\nlike unless you have a genetic mutation\ni don't know if you do\npeople with a genetic mutation only need\nfour hours of sleep and that's one to\none and a half percent of the population\nthe rest of us need somewhere between\nseven and nine\nyou know tom brady famously says that he\ngets nine hours of sleep a night\nand he considers it absolutely\ninstrumental to being able to win a\nsuper bowl at 43.\nso if he had said oh you know i really\nwant to win the super bowl i'm just\ngoing to\npower through exhaustion and and\nwork out and train more he would not win\nyou know that's really what is amazing\nthat our culture for centuries\nhas believed something false yeah\nyou know i'll sleep when i'm dead you\nsnooze you lose\nand i went back because i'm a bit of a\nnerd\nto try and understand how come an entire\nculture has believed something false and\nit goes back to the first industrial\nrevolution when we started revering\nmachines\nand what's the goal with machines the\ngoal with machine is to minimize\ndowntime and what's the goal with\nsoftware\nwe brag you know this piece of software\nhas 99.9\nuptime but the human operating system is\ndifferent\na downtime is a feature not a bug\nyeah and now we need to\num have this mindset shift\nthat acknowledges that we are swimming\nin a culture\nthat's driven by principles that are not\nscience or data based\nyeah i'm so glad that you are such an\nevangelist for this movement because\nyou know i i came to a point in my life\nwhere i realized\ni either i had two choices i either\nslowed down\nor i invested more in my health and what\ni realized was that the more i\ninvested in my health and the more\npriority\nmy sleep was my exercise was my diet was\nthe more i was actually able to extend\nmyself\nso a lot of the time when people told me\nthat they just had too much on my first\nquestion would be do you exercise\nand they would say no i haven't\nexercised for years and i'd be like okay\nand then i'd say\nwell do you sleep seven to nine hours\nand they were like no i sleep like\nsix and i was like oh okay so you start\nto realize that a lot of our experience\nof\nlow productivity or effectiveness or\nburnout\nis because we're not actually investing\nin our health so i know\nthat when i've exercised and when i've\nslept well\ni can actually do more in less time and\nand\nas you said you don't want to do an\ninterview when you're tired because you\nmake mistakes\nyou you feel like you're actually making\nbetter decisions this morning i played\nan hour of tennis\nand i meditated for two hours before\nthat so now when you're getting me\nyou're getting like the best version of\nme i also slept\ni'm trying to think how many hours did i\nsleep last night yeah i slept eight and\na half which is my sweet spot i like\neight and a half hours\nso i slept eight and a half hours last\nnight so i'm able to give you my best\nenergy\nand you're so right that if i'd missed\ntennis today if i didn't meditate if i'd\nslept badly\ni would feel like this was a lot harder\nright like\neven though it's the same thing and also\nit would feel just like another chore\nlike you know like oh another thing i\nhave to do\nand yeah no this is not a dress\nrehearsal you know even if you believe\nin incarnation\nyou know it's this is it so\nto find the joy in what we're doing we\nneed to come from that\nplace of fullness and i'm\nso happy you are saying that we need to\nshout it from the rooftops\nto to help people eliminate their fear\nthat if they invest in their health they\nare\nnot going to achieve all that they want\nto achieve because it is a fear\nand and a lot of people have achieved a\nlot\nthrough powering through so you can have\na lot of examples of that\nbut you can achieve more\nif you invest in your health and also\nyou can have a lot live a life which has\nmore meaning and purpose because in the\nend\nthe definition of a good life is not\njust\na successful life in terms of money and\ndata it's also a life of well-being\ntapping into our wisdom giving wonder\nand if we miss out on all these things\nwe have a very shrunken view of\nexistence\nabsolutely tell us uh ariana i've got a\nfew more questions for you before i let\nyou go but\ntell tell our audience how they can\nrecognize\nif they're experiencing burnout because\ni feel that today we don't even know\nwhen we're experiencing burnout because\nwe don't have that time to sit with\nourselves and we're not aware\nhow what are the signs of burnout that\nsomeone can be aware of so that they can\nsay you know what\ni need to start doing what ariana's\nsaying i need to do that 60-second\ncheck-in\ni need to put my phone away in the\nevening i need to\nsleep for seven to nine hours what are\nthe signs of burnout that we\nmiss because we're so busy that we don't\neven realize what we're going through\nfirst of all that's such a good question\nbecause we do miss the science\nand we need to kind of fine-tune our\nantenna\nand i would say\nthere are three signs that are\npredominant and the first is actually\nwhen we begin to feel\nto be very negative and cynical about\nour work\nour lives uh that's a sign\nthat we are not connected and\nto our center and our essence\nthe other is when we really wake up in\nthe morning\nand everything feels like drudgery\nlike we can still do things we can be\ntransactional and get through a busy\nschedule\nbut it's we have to be pushing ourselves\nand often\nwe find ourselves going to carbs or\nswedes to give ourselves energy and i\nlove my coffee nothing wrong with coffee\nbut\ni stopped having caffeine at two o'clock\nso that doesn't affect my sleep\nand noticing in all these like\nways that we try to fuel ourselves\nbecause we don't really have any natural\nhealthy fuel in us\nand the other is very simply our\nproductivity\ni mean you can see it in any area of\nyour life\nwhen you are when you're running on all\ncylinders you know things can be done so\nmuch faster you are clearer\nand and when you are exhausted it's like\ni mean for me like trying to write an\narticle when i'm exhausted seems like\noverwhelming\nso there are so many little signs\nthat we can begin to notice and the\nother thing i am a big believer in and\nwe practice at thrive\nis having an accountability body\nyou probably do that with your wife but\nhaving somebody who can say to you\nyou know hey jay you seem off today or\nyou haven't done this\nand not in a critical way but you know\ncan you can you stop for\n60 seconds can you is there something\nthis afternoon that we can reschedule\nyou know\nkind of see your see your schedule also\nas something\nthat is fungible if you're if you're not\nfeeling fully yourself is there some if\nthere are some things that\ncan't be rescheduled yeah unless you're\nreally on your deathbed and other things\nthat you can reschedule\nyeah i love that i and i the\naccountability thing for me is huge\nuh i know that i'm i need someone to\nkeep me accountable in different areas\nof my life whether it's\nexercise whether it's diet and having\nthat commitment and and what i find is\nthe most important thing about\naccountability is being ready to receive\nfeedback because you can find an\naccountability partner and you can find\nan accountability buddy but if you don't\nwant to be told that you're wrong or\nthat you could improve something\nit all goes wrong and i find that with\nmy wife she's so good but\nif if i have my big ego on that day\nyou know you don't allow yourself to\nreceive it because\nyou you just want to defend yourself no\nno i i'm getting it right\nbut i found that in my own practice\nbeing able to be humble enough\nto actually hear someone out and realize\nthey're telling you for your own good\nlike my wife will always say to me\neat slower eat slower she'll always say\nto me you're eating too fast\nand i'll be like yeah but i've got so\nmuch to do i'm so busy i've got i've got\nto go to this place\nand she's just saying it for my own good\nshe's just you know she's not saying it\nfor her body she's saying it for my\ndigestion and my body\nand and i think being able to receive\nhumbly is\nis a really you know i i definitely\nit's something i think that we all\nstruggle with and can work on more\nuh but ariana you've been amazing i want\nto ask you what we always do which is\nour final five you were amazing last\ntime this is\nour last five questions which you answer\nin one word or one sentence maximum\nthat's it\nuh so these are your final five uh\nquestions\nuh so the first question ariana are you\nready\nyes okay great the first question is\nwhat's the first thing you do in the\nmorning the first thing i do in the\nmorning is the 60 seconds\nto set my intention for the day amazing\ni love that\nuh what's the last thing you do at night\nthe last thing\nis to write down three things\ni was grateful for for the day from the\nday\nbeautiful question number three a habit\nyou wish you started earlier\nrecognizing that life is shaped from the\ninside\nout and that changes all the habits i\nlove it question number four\na habit you're trying to develop right\nnow or something you're trying to work\non right now\ni'm working on reactivity\nso being less reactive\ntaking deep breaths\nand then acting or saying something\nnice i like that okay and fifth and\nfinal question your favorite micro step\nfrom the book your time to thrive so um\nmy favorite microstep beyond everything\nwe discussed\nis the recognition of the\nsuperpower of our breath\nand specifically practicing what navy\nseals practice\nbox breathing i know that's more than a\nsentence but\ninhale to the count of four pause to the\ncount of four\nexhale to the count of four absolutely\ngreat\nadvice great insights everyone please\nplease please\nif you're listening to this right now\nyour time to thrive will be\navailable everywhere books are sold make\nsure you go\nand grab a copy i really believe that\nright now\nis the time to build these micro steps\nwhen we're in this stress\nin this pressure in this challenging\nsituation there's no better time don't\nwait for the right time or a good time\nor a better time\nto build these micro steps if you build\nthem right now\nyou're going to feel so strong so\nconfident and so powerful when\nwe move out of this space uh slowly into\nthe future\nariana i thank you for your amazing\ninsights i loved\neverything you shared today and they're\nso practical yet so\nphilosophical and uh i i miss you i just\nwant to\nhang out with you again and see you guys\nwe need to break bread together\nand let me know what color you want and\ni'll send you\nonward
