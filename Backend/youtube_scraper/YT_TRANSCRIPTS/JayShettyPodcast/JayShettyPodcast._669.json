song\nthey shouldn't have a whole school for\nthat that is a great question that my\nwife and my mom still ask me every\nsingle day hey jennifer it's so good to\nsee you\nhi jay let me give you a hug i think you\nhave to strive to be the best\ni think that's an important key but you\ndon't have to be the best\nto have success welcome everyone to\ncoach conversations a\nmonthly youtube series where we get\ntogether to talk about the things that\ntruly impact\nour minds our hearts and our lives and\ntoday's theme\nis finding your purpose leading with\ngratitude\nand as the new coach campaign coach it\nforward encourages\ntelling the people in our lives how\nthey've moved our world forward\nnow who better to do this with than you\njennifer someone who found\nher calling so early in life someone\nwho's dedicated her life to pursuing her\ndreams\nand done it with so much authenticity\nand what can i say you've been a\ncultural touchstone for the past 25\nyears\nyou're a member of the coach family and\nwhat i'm most\ninspired by and what i want to dive\ndeepest into today\nis how purpose drives everything you do\ni'm ready let's go\ni'm fascinated to know how you define\nyour calling and purpose today\nand why you think it's important to\ndefine it\nwow that's you know i i went like that\nwhen you asked the question because it's\nit's such a\nstill such a big question for me even\nthough i kind of know what i do for a\nliving and what my life is\nand the things that drive me for me\ntoday\nin january 2021 i think my calling is\nto empower inspire and entertain\nthose are the things that i do and in an\nentertaining\ni kind of hope i'm always empowering and\ninspiring people\nto be the best at whatever they want to\ndo\nyou know i went and uh before ruth bader\nginsburg died\num i i got the the privilege to meet her\nand her chambers\nwhile i was on tour and i said to her i\nsaid what can i do to help like it seems\nlike the world is so crazy right now\nand she said uh exactly what you're\ndoing\nevery person just has to do what they do\nbest and be the best that they can be\nand\nin that they will help the world what a\nperfect answer thank you so much for\nsharing that by the way\nsince we're talking about purpose this\nmonth and that's the topic\ntell me a bit more about you what\nexactly does a a purpose coach\ndo that is a great question that my wife\nand my mom\nstill ask me every single day a purpose\ncoach helps people\nfigure out how they can have the deepest\nand biggest impact on people's lives\nusing their gift\nand i believe there's someone out there\nright now jennifer who's\ngoing to cure a disease and they don't\neven know it yet\nthere's someone out there who's going to\ninspire millions of people and they\ndon't even know it yet\nand if i can play even a tiny role in\nhelping them get closer to that\nthen that's what i'm trying to dedicate\nmy life to yeah that that's amazing i\nlove that that's like a perfect answer\nbut you you weren't always a purpose\ncoach you had you had kind of a second\nact you know i didn't what we call\nsecond act so i'm always about we\nwe wrote that movie with this whole idea\nin mind of like you can do many things\nso how did how did you get to where you\nare today i thought i was going to be in\nbusiness\nbecause it was the safe option and then\ni\ncompletely went on to the other side and\nrebelled against it and went and lived\nas a monk\nand then i came back to the real world\nthree years on where i found\nmore stability back in the world of\nmanagement and business\nand then i found that that wasn't my\ntrue calling what drew me to the purpose\nwork\nis that i saw a lot of pain in humanity\nand\nthe source of that pain was a lack of\neducation\npeople were just never given the tools\nso if you think about it\nwe have a class for biology but we don't\nhave a class for\nthe heart or emotions we have a class\nfor math\nwhy don't they teach kids from very\nyoung to love themselves\ni'm i'm with you on that that's that you\nshould start that school or of course\nwell we should do something\ni remember when i was like going through\ntherapy at the beginning you know\nyou know kind of like in my late 30s and\nit was there was a lot of talk about\nloving yourself and i was like i love\nmyself\nbut obviously i was doing all these\nthings in like my personal relationships\nit\ndidn't seem like i was loving myself but\nso i didn't even understand the\nconcept of it and it took time and it's\na journey and it's still a journey for\nme\nhow do you feel that you know people are\nstruggling obviously as you know as\nwe're aware\nhow do do you feel like finding your\ncalling and purpose\nhappens at difficult times and at tough\ntimes is that the right time to\nopen your mind and heart up to that is\nthere ever a right time\nyou know this is such a tough moment\nit's a very tough moment and\nand the whole year has been tough but\nmany of us if we're lucky\none of the blessings of 2020 was that we\nhad a moment of pause\nthere was a moment where we could just\nstop for a second and we could\nlook inward even if it was just taking a\nfew moments\nevery day to take stock in those things\nand\nto prioritize what was really important\nin our lives our family our kids\nyou know and not only see what you want\nbut more importantly\nwho you want to be when it all comes\nback around it's a great insight great\nadvice\nlet's talk more about the words calling\nand purpose\nall right because that's what this month\nis about how would you define them\nit's not the same thing as as career for\nexample\nyeah i think there's a difference\nbetween a calling and a career because a\ncareer feels like something you're\nalways pushing\nlike you're like pushing it trying to\nmake it work and a calling feels like\nsomething that's pulling you\ncloser to it like it feels like you're\nbeing pulled towards it and so\nbut i i have to say that i do feel\ncareers\ncan evolve into callings and so i often\nfind that when people just start on\ntheir career and rather than feeling\nlike oh my gosh my calling's so far away\nor my purpose is so far\naway let me just learn what i can from\nthis because it's going to be useful\nlater\nthere's going to be some part of it\nthat's actually powerful\nfor my future and so i think that's how\nthey connect and overlap yeah and i\nthink when you\nwhen you take on any job or anything\nthat you have to do\neven if if it's like well this doesn't\nfeel right if you put your heart and\nsoul into it and you do the best you can\ndo\nyou're gonna get something out of it\nit's gonna lead to\nsomething else and when you're trying to\nbe like i said you have to\ntry to be the greatest of all time like\nyou have to aim for that\nand that's what i am right and when\nyou're aiming for that all of a sudden\nas an\nactor you're like when you're aiming to\nbe the best actor you can you realize\nthat you have to learn what it is to\ndirect you have to learn what it is to\nproduce you have to understand what it\nis\nto be the set designer to be oh because\nall of it works together and you wind up\nyou know growing and growing and\nevolving and evolving just because\nyou're open to being\nthe greatest in the job that you have\nright there it seems like\neven in your new single in the morning\nyou speak to metamorphosis\nand it seems like what i'm hearing from\nyou today is that\neverything's highly intentional you're\npicking things\nbecause they seem deeply purposeful have\nyou always been\nlike that has that always been the way\nyou've approached\neverything in life where it feels deeply\nintentional\nyeah i think because you know i started\nas a dancer\nand i wasn't always the best dancer i\nwas a great dancer but i wasn't the best\ndancer you know and everybody's so\ncompetitive in these fields right\nbut i knew that every from the beginning\nbecause of that i\ni put something extra into it i\nput my heart into it i put my soul into\nit into each move\nthere was a purpose behind it like\neverything had to speak something\nand i learned that early on when i was\nwhen i was dancing from when i was very\nyoung\nthat i had to for it to affect people\nsince i couldn't kick my leg the highest\nbecause i couldn't jump and make the\nsplit the highest\nthat i had to have something else that\nwas connecting because that at the end\nof the day doesn't really matter\nwhat i realized what matters was\nactually you know connecting\nin a way and putting a passion into each\nmove and making everything mean\nsomething everything i do i want it to\nhave a purpose to it\ni i really want to remind people to own\ntheir power always you know morning team\nit's not it's not just when you're in\nthe spotlight it's like\nbeing your best self at every moment you\nknow even when the cameras are not on\ni think i love hearing you say that you\nweren't you didn't think that you were\nthe best dancer because i think there's\na lot of people just hearing that and\ngoing\noh you know like just taking the\npressure off of like thinking that you\nhave to have\nthought you were the best from that\npoint on so i think i think that's just\nstriving to be the best\ni think that's an important key but you\ndon't have to be the best\nto to have success to have\nyou just have to not give up you have to\nkeep going\nyou have to always just know that you\nhave something special to offer\nbut you have to strike i think striving\nto be the best is\nis part of the secret when i've watched\nyou whether i've been watching your\ninterviews\nor your performances i always feel like\nit's more than entertainment\nit's it's more about empowerment tell me\nabout what's going on in your mind\nand what you want people to experience\nwhen you ask them to dream\non my mantra for this you're one of them\nbecause i always have many i always have\nmany is to dream on i really believe\n2021 can bring change and healing\nand my dream is that you know together\nthis year we can make a more\nunified more loving more accepting more\nunderstanding\nworld i always want to inspire inspire\ndifferent things in people and whether\nit's to make them laugh or cry\naffect them in some way and in these\ntimes\nwhere all of us can feel lost i i wanted\nto give people\nsome hope and some direction and i'm\ninterested to hear about\nhow you go there in your creative\nprocess because\nto be able to do that it means you're\nhaving to go through things yourself\nyou're having to feel\nthings yeah the creative process for me\nespecially in building a show or\nperformance is is really a many\nlayered you know process for me i don't\nthink\nanything has an impact if you're not a\nhundred percent in it and behind it so\nwhen i'm creating something i\ni do it because i love it and i love the\nmoment-to-moment\nconnection that i get with with the\naudience whether it's\na song or a movie or a live performance\ni want it to be successful of course and\ni want to do my best but i believe that\nthat things that resonate with me will\nresonate with other people\nand when you make choices that way yeah\nthere's always some risks involved some\npeople are going to love it some people\nare going to\nhate it whatever but i i don't let that\nworry kind of overcome me\nyou know is this the right choice or\nshould i be more cautious because\ni want to feel passionate about the\nthings i create and i and i think that\nthat\nthat shows in my work yeah one of one of\nthe things that really resonated with me\nwas when on the last day of 2020 you\nused the launch of your jlo beauty brand\nto tell people to literally\nwash away 2020 like ceremoniously right\nlike it was\nand i feel like everybody needed to do\nthat go ahead i'm sorry\ni agree with you everyone needed to do\nthat what do you think\nyou were washing away in 2020 or what\nwere you letting go of in 2020\nwith the launch because it was on\njanuary 1st and because it was a\nsymbolic kind of\nnew beginning of a new year that the\nidea of washing away\nthe year before which was 2020 which was\na year we all wanted to wash away\nit was it was a chance to kind of wash\naway\nsome of the pain some of the uncertainty\nsome of the fear\nthat we've all been experiencing this\nyear it was a chance to just\nwash away the energy of that year\nand really start fresh\nand know that that that's possible but\nwe\nas a collective have experienced a lot\nof trauma over the past year\nphysical emotional psychological is is\nthere such\na thing do you think as universal\nhealing\nhow do we move forward with purpose\nas you know because we're all emotional\nworks in progress\ni love that i'm so glad you asked me\nthat question there's a\nthere's a beautiful thing i read from a\nwriter called russell barkley\nand in it he says that people who need\nthe most\nlove often ask for it in the most\nunloving ways and\nand i thought about that i think about\nthat a lot about how every cry for\nattention\nis a cry for love every cry for\nvalidation\nis a cry for love every act of pain or\nhurt to someone\nin in one way or another is a deep cry\nfor life\nbut also like it's just not a cry\nsometimes it's like\nthat person who's really angry the\nperson who's like really angry you're\nlike you just need a hug\nlike you give let me give you a hug\nright now like you could just tell\nthat's what i mean yeah it is exactly\nthat and i know exactly what you mean\ni i find that a lot of people right now\nfeel this pressure to find their purpose\nwhen someone's feeling pressure\nlike if someone's sitting there and\nthey're going oh gosh i just don't know\nwhat my purpose is i feel so far away\nfrom it\nhow do you deal with that pressure of\nredefining your purpose and evolving\npeople always like oh she reinvents\nherself like there's a reinvention i\ndon't like that word i'm not reinventing\nor trying to be something different\nor trying to trick people into like\nsomething new\nit's just it's an evolving right so when\nyou're talking about a calling or\npurpose\nthere's there's a lot of pressure around\nit right the most important thing is\nthat you have to listen to yourself\nand the words that you tell yourself\nbecause what you say and what you think\nand i tell this to my kids all the time\nbecomes your reality if you're telling\nyourself you're\nyou know i'm going to be this or i'm\ngoing to be that you're telling yourself\ni'm a\nloser then you'll be a loser whatever it\nis\nyou tell yourself that and it will\nmanifest i really believe\nthat we create our lives again not just\nwith our actions and the things we do\nbut the things we think and the\nself-talk that we give\nbeing in this business where people are\nalways trying to tell you what you\nshould and shouldn't do\nyou really have to have a strong sense\nof self and gut\nand instinct and follow that we talked\nabout listening to the inner voice but\nwe also have to listen to\nvoices around us surrounding ourselves\nwith the right mentors tell us about\nwhat\ncoach it forward means to you i mean\nit's about\nreally telling people in your life\ntaking the time\nto let the people in your life know\nthat they've impacted your life that to\nme is such a beautiful idea\nand why i love being associated and\nworking with them because they're always\nthinking about\nkind of more just not you know the the\nbrand itself but what the brand stands\nfor and it's social good\nand uh and i love that and i love this\nidea of coaching forward i mean we all\nknow what pay it forward means it's like\nyou have a blessing\nand you somehow pay it forward\nselflessly to somebody else\nand i love that idea but i also love the\nidea\nof coach it forward which is just you\nknow simple as picking up the phone and\ncalling somebody instead\nand saying you make my every day better\ni would say\nwho i talk to every day maybe multiple\ntimes a day is my producing partner\none of my very best friends elaine\ngoldsmith thomas and she\njust pumps me up every day she just you\nknow she goes i feel like i have to\nremind\nyou all the time because you're so hard\non yourself and you're such a\nperfectionist\ni i want to remind you that you're doing\ngreat it's\ngood you know because i'm always like oh\ngot to do this i didn't do that but\nsure you're a good mom you're a good you\nknow person you know\nand it's important to have people like\nthat in your life and so\ni'm saying to elaine right now i love\nyou and i love what you bring to my life\nand\num everything about you and how you make\nme feel\nis priceless to me in my life i love\nthat\nthat's beautiful to hear and i'm so glad\nthat that gratitude was\npersonalized and specific like that's\nwhen it works\nlike studies show that when you're\nactually specific about gratitude and\nit's so personal and i could see when\nyou were talking about them it was just\npouring out from your heart like that's\nwhen gratitude is\nbeautifully received and given like you\nfeel as much joy giving gratitude\nas the person feels receiving it but\njennifer thank you so much for your time\ntoday\nand to join me in this first ever\nepisode of coach conversations\ni feel like we
