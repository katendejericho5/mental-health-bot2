    "transcript": "instead of focusing again back to\nperception because perception's reality\nif we stop if you would stop if i stop\nyou stop we stop\nthinking about the aspects about what\nwe're doing that we don't like\nand you're then getting more of it and\nwe start thinking about what it is that\nwe want\nand envisioning that dreaming about that\nembodying that\nvisualizing yourself in that life i\ntrust the universe enough to know that\ni can't help but get it\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\none of you that come back every week\nto listen learn and grow now i'm really\nexcited about this conversation today\nand i think you're going to absolutely\nlove it\nbecause you're going to get practical\nadvice deep insights\nand potentially even a bit of a\nspiritual awakening i'm speaking today\nto danica patrick a former race car\ndriver and the most\nsuccessful woman in the history of the\nsport\nsince her retirement in 2018 danica has\nbecome\na business owner entrepreneur and an\ninspirational speaker\nshe's launched her own clothing line\nwritten a book and became an\nowner of a winery in napa valley she's\nalso the host of the podcast\npretty intense a podcast dedicated to\nhelping people become their true\nbest self i had the pleasure of going on\nthe podcast last year where we talked\nabout my book think like a monk\nand i've been looking forward to\ninterviewing and reciprocating with\ndanica's love\nthrough this podcast danica welcome to\non purpose\noh man it's my honor i mean it's through\nit's through your podcast and a few\nother friends in which\nyou know well that i've been inspired to\ndo my own so\nuh like-minded missions absolutely\nabsolutely and it's\nit's amazing how you can have such\ndifferent\njourneys but we all evolved to this\nsimilar value similar mission similar\npurpose and i think that's what i love\nso much about getting to do this is when\ni look at your journey\ni'm like wow like after your incredible\nsuccess and experiences and\nif this is what your journey is evolving\nto you know how lucky are we to connect\nthat way i wanted to start with though\ni saw uh a lot of posts and videos and\nthings on your instagram recently of you\ndoing yoga and meditation in nature and\nby a beautiful river and just it's\nreally interesting and i know i've heard\nyou talk about how nature's been such a\nbig part of your spiritual\njourney tell me a bit about\nhow nature is we hear a lot about the\npositives of nature but for you\nspecifically\nhow has nature been so deeply connected\nto your spiritual journey\nsuch a great question and so powerful\ni just say off the bat quite simply with\nnature\ni don't i would i would challenge anyone\nto say\nanytime they've gone in nature that they\nfeel worse\nlike just starting there like have you\never gone to the beach have you ever\nwalked in the woods have you ever gone\nfor just a walk outside in your\nneighborhood or wherever you live\nand been like man that was terrible i\nhated that it was horrible the\ntrees were so ugly i mean you never do\nthat even when you look at a dead tree\nyou're like\nwow it's winter and look at that tree\ndoesn't even care it's dead it's gonna\ncome back to life why can't i be more\nlike a tree\ni think that's kind of the magic of\nnature is that\num i don't i i believe that there's\nmore of a frequency element to it that\ngoes a little deeper probably more\nscientific\nbut um but i think it's just that\nyou know it's i feel like we want to be\nlike nature\nsubconsciously like being able to lose\nour leaves and not care being\nable to die and be reborn being able to\ngrow\nfreely finding the light\ni mean look at trees and how they you\nknow managed to\nweave their way on up to just find a\nlittle bit of light at the top i mean i\nfeel like it's a\nbig analogy for what we're all\naspiring for um so i think it's a little\nbit more science\nscientific and subconscious um but then\nif we just look on the surface i mean\nfor the most part it's beautiful\ni love those examples already they're\nabsolutely beautiful and\nyou reminded me of two things as you\nwere saying that\nin the vedas that i studied there's a\nbeautiful section called the 24 gurus\nand it looks at the 24 gurus in nature\nso it gives some of those examples where\nit looks at 24\nelements of nature whether that's rivers\ntrees\nanimals flowers plants and it shows how\nwe can learn something from them so\nyou reminded me of that beautiful\nsection and also what you were saying\nscientifically i remember reading about\na term\ni believe it's called biomimicry where\nyou\nbasically emulate nature in your life\nso what you were giving the example an\nexample i often give to people is like\nletting and this sounds like a crazy\nthing but i remember\ni would often well not often sometimes i\nwould see uh shedded snake skins when i\nlived in india\nand it would always be like we were told\nthat letting go was like a skin\na snake sheds its skin like it's not\nthis forced\nlike you don't have to break yourself\nyou just slither out of\nyou know what you don't want to be\nanymore and so when you were saying that\nseeking the light\nand it brought about so many beautiful\nvisuals\nand you're so right that you're so right\nthat\ni i agree with you fully i think the\nchallenge you set us all today is\nbeautiful whenever you've been out in\nnature\nand not valued and i was thinking i was\ntrying to think of a time and i couldn't\nfind one\nto the point that i was thinking even\nvisualizations when i lead visualization\nmeditations\nso many people their most relaxing\nvisualization\nis in nature and and i\ni think that's such a beautiful message\nuh that you're sharing with all of us\nand tell me about that tell me about how\ndifferent is that because\nwe often talk about this paradox\nof we're moving so fast in life\nthat we miss these beautiful things\nbut the truth is no one has actually\nexperienced what it means to go as fast\nas you have or very little\ni mean behind the behind the wheel like\nyou've\nactually lived life in a way where you\nare moving\ni mean how many miles per hour are you\ndriving yeah over 200 almost all the\ntime\nevery time i think i'm cool on the\nhighway i'm definitely not like 200\nmiles per hour that is insane\nand you're driving with extreme control\nof course in extreme focus\nbut you think about that life's almost\nlike we're driving 200 miles per hour\nand we miss\nthese beautiful things tell me about the\nparadox of having lived so much with\nmachines for so long\nand now spending so much time in nature\nwas that different then or did you\nalways value nature even then\ni think there's sort of a bigger\ntransition concept to talk about but the\nfirst thing that comes to mind is\nperception\nright so as i'm narrowly focused because\ni have to be\non the job and going 200 230 200\nyou know like you're very narrowly\nfocused so it's that point of perception\nthat i'm lasered in on that allows me to\ndo that job now if you just sort of\nshift that sort of\nthought into nature and you go what if i\nput my point of perception on that\nflower\nwhat if i put my point of perception on\nhow beautiful it is versus\nhow many branches are broken or whatever\nlike\nit's all about perception um\nand so that's kind of what i thought\nabout as you were talking about that but\nthen i'd say that when it came to\nthis sort of extreme opposites of\nnature and then machine\ni found being honest it was really\nbecause of so much exploration of nature\nand being\nin it more and doing more yoga more\nmeditation\nmore connection to myself spiritually on\na deeper level\nthat i actually started to\nshift frequency frequency wise\nenergetically\nfrom the space that i was in it no\nlonger was really that comfortable for\nme anymore\nand it wasn't necessarily just about\ndriving the car i think that's\nmore of a dance that's artistic it's\nlike\na feel thing there's an um it's it's a\ndifferent\nit's it's different than than than what\ni'm talking about but\nunfortunately it came in the package\nwhich was\ni just like i stopped resonating with\nthese sort of moods that i was\nexperiencing around me\njobs that i was experiencing around me\nwhether it was just\nbeing a jerk on the track to make things\nhappen\nor to promote something that you weren't\nthat passionate about or to watch other\npeople promote things that were just\nlike\num and uh and then just the the vibe\nthis sort of vibe that everyone had\nthere was like a a cutthroat angry\nnature\njust through a rise in my own frequency\nof being\nin nature and doing more things that are\nin that sort of\nrealm i just wasn't as happy anymore\nand so i didn't i in that last season of\nmy career\ni really like to call it like i let it\ngo i was open to continuing on if\nsomething made sense and happened but\ni wasn't forcing it and i wasn't running\nfrom it i was just sort of\nin the middle in that neutral ground of\nallowing\nand when it didn't come through i let it\ngo\nand i just thought it's not for me\nanymore so\nyeah nature was a real powerful thing\nyeah that's amazing i want to come back\nto letting it go\nbut let's dive into what you said that\nyou're talking about this spiritual\njourney and the depth\nwe hear that a lot for a lot of people\nand i love asking people to define their\nown spiritual journey because i think\nit's\nso personal and so unique and\nthere are the practices which i want to\ndive into of yoga and meditation but\nfor you as a philosophy of your\nspiritual journey like what does that\nmean to you how do you\ndefine that transition and that focus in\nyour life\ni feel like spirituality is one of those\nthings in my life that i have actually\nnot\nset a destination on\nalmost everything in my life i'm\ndestination oriented this is how it's\ngonna turn out this is where i'm gonna\nlive this will be my life\nthis is my goal it will do this this is\nthe success of it this is what will mean\nsuccess\nand in my spiritual journey it's\nliterally like\nnext step next step next step so\nin this quest of being i've never really\nunpacked this verbally like this\num so it's a great question um of being\npresent\ni'm actually present with being present\nthat makes sense like i'm allowing\nmyself to just take\nnext steps as they come and as they feel\nright um and not\nnecessarily thinking about uh where i\nwant to end up\num which is kind of kind of surprising\nfor me actually\nyeah no it's and it's often what deters\npeople from spirituality because\nit's so much of a revelatory journey i i\nknow that\nwhen when we were trained in the ashram\nit was always said that a spirituality a\nspiritual journey is one that is\nreceived not achieved\nlike we'd always hear that constantly to\nto help us\nmove away from that achievement\nmentality that we could do something\nrespectfully not achieve what does that\nmean explain that what it means is that\nthe spiritual journey is revealed to you\nit's not something that you can say i've\ngot it now and i've bottled it up and\nand here it is i look at my metal look\nat my trophy of i meditated for 18 hours\ntoday look how great i\nam it was it had to be revealed to you\nthe answer the\nthe next step and kind of what you're\nsaying now that when you're present with\nyour step it's revealed\nthe next step is revealed to you if that\nmakes sense\nyeah that that's that that makes sense\nwow\ncool no you you made me think of it in\nin what you were saying of the idea of\nif you are truly present it's it's\nalmost like i\ni mean you're making me think about just\nways of understanding it and explaining\nit but\nit's almost like if you're trying to get\nacross a river and there's lots of\nstones everywhere it's like if you're\npresent on this stone\nyou can then see the next one and yeah\nyou know where you want to jump to next\nbut if you're constantly looking\nat the other side you may just fall into\nthe river right\ni think about two there's another\nanalogy where you're driving let's say\nyou're driving from one coast to the\nnext\nyou can't see the other coast\nyou just follow those headlights right\nyou're just following the headlights\ni mean obviously it's daytime sometimes\nbut you're following the headlights\nessentially like\nshowing you you know the next mile or\nthe next half a mile or\nwhatever and it's it's not that you can\nsee it but you just keep\nfollowing the lights yes following the\nroad\nyeah that that makes so much sense that\nthat's a really good one i\nreally like that analogy and how do you\nget comfortable with that\nuncertainty like how do you get\ncomfortable with really truly being\npresent\nbecause like you said in all areas of\nour life we're all\nneed the goal we need to see the end we\nneed and i'm not saying there's anything\nwrong with that\nbut how do you get comfortable in that\ndiscomfort and that uncertainty and that\nlack of surety of where this is going i\nguess it's because\nyou know i feel like this is an abraham\nhicks line like you can't get it wrong\nand you're never done\nlike i guess there's a thought in my\nhead where i feel like i'm never gonna\nknow\nthe answers to the universe anyway so\nlike i don't even it would be that that\nwould be my answer if i had to set a\ndestination would be like\noh i'll i'll know everything there is to\nknow like i'll know everything there is\nto know about the nature of reality\nwhich relates to me as a human\nbut i know that we won't get to know\nlike until we die\nso i guess i don't even know what\ndestination to set\nbecause i'm so used to setting the\nfurthest one\nso i guess since i don't even know what\nto set i just keep taking the next step\nmaybe maybe i need to use that in my\nprofessional and personal life too like\ni\ni don't how much better could it get\nlet's see you know\nyeah i i think what you said was really\ninteresting is you talked about how\nwhen the frequency of what you were\nexperiencing in your career\nwas no longer matching the frequency you\nwere\nspiritually experiencing that's when you\nkind of\nwere able to let go what do you think\nabout for people who are almost\nmaybe in a toxic work atmosphere or in a\nspace where their career where they\ndon't have the opportunity they haven't\nachieved that level of\nsuccess where they now can move on or\ntry something new\nhow have you thought about and i'm sure\nyou had to do this too it's never\nperfect for anyone it's like\nhow did you deal with the toxicity or\nthe negativity\nwhile you had to before you could move\non and let go because i think that's\nwhere most of us spend our lives like\nmost of us spend our lives where you\nhave this energy and frequency around\nyou and you somehow have to\ncontinue on every day you have to wake\nup and go to work and switch on your\nzoom call\ni'm just thinking about the people in\nour audience and and i'm sure you had\nthat\nyou know that that bridge period yeah\nand this is so\nrelatable and applicable and useful\nand i'd say i the first thing that i\nthink about like\nfor myself i'm a dreamer so for me this\nis easy this is natural\nit's natural for me to think what's next\num because again i'm a future caster\nforward thinker right so\ni would say that it's thinking about\nwhat it is that you actually\nwant for your life um i feel like i\nshould go back\nbackwards and say this is your situation\nyou tend to become\nso uncomfortable you don't want to be\nthere no matter what\nlike especially if you're nurturing\nthese\nother aspects of yourself and\npractices whether they be spiritual or\nor whatever you get so uncomfortable you\nreally don't want to be there anyway and\nso you by nature might even start to be\nseeking out other ways to exist\nother ways to make money whatever\nwhatever it's going to take for you to\nget out of your situation\num but but i would say like a tangible\nthing that you could do\nwould be to just start instead of\nfocusing again back to perception\nbecause perception's reality\nif we stop if you would stop if i stop\nyou stop we stop\nthinking about the aspects about what\nwe're doing that we don't like\nby nature then getting more of it and we\nstart thinking about what it is that we\nwant\nand envisioning that dreaming about that\nembodying that\num visualizing yourself in that life\ni trust the universe enough to know that\ni can't help but get it\nit's hard when you're in the moment but\nit but it's good advice because\ni remember spending a few years in the\ncorporate world\nin between monk life and what i do now\nand\nand it's like i didn't really fit in or\ni didn't necessarily love everything i\nhad to do every day but\ni was able to use the parts of that job\nthat\ndid make me feel alive and just amplify\nthem as much as i could and i\nwas like oh i'm learning about\ntechnology and i'm learning about this\nand i'm\nlearning about connecting with people\nand whatever it was and it was just\nwhen that's when you when you put your\nvision and your perception on to those\nthings\nall of a sudden even something really\nmeaningless\ncan start to feel meaningful because\nyou've started to notice the meaning\nin it and and i think we just live in a\nworld where we think of it as like this\nis meaningless and this is meaningful\nbut\neven i'm sure you could say this that\neven on this side of\ndoing things that are more spiritual or\nmeaningful or fulfilling\nthere's still plenty parts of our lives\nthat we have to do stuff we don't\nlove yeah right absolutely and it makes\nme think of two uh\nyou know it's another thing abraham i\nlisten to a lot of abraham too\nbut another thing that comes to mind is\ncontrast and how\ngrateful we should be for contrast\nbecause it's in the contrast that it\nshows us when we show\nwhen it shows us what we don't want we\nknow what we do want\nand so you know just because something\nand it also\nit also allows you an opportunity to\nshift your mindset to gratitude and go\nthis isn't fun but i'm so glad i get to\ngo on this vacation\nor whatever it is that comes as a result\nof it because\nto think like you said that life is just\nyou know\nthis easy breezy flowing extension\nof vacation after vacation after\njoyful experience after joyful\nexperience\nlike it's not realistic and sometimes we\nhave to do things that we don't really\nwant to do but when we focus on why\nwe're doing it\nit gives it more meaning yeah absolutely\ntell us a bit about that\npractical daily spiritual journey that\nyou're on you\nyou mentioned yoga meditation we've seen\non instagram tell us about that morning\nroutine of yours or your daily routine\nthat's giving you that\ntrust that confidence because i often\nfeel like\nthat that trust as you said trusting the\nuniverse\nthat trust doesn't come from just a\nfeeling or a belief it comes from a set\nof practices in my\nexperience of when you know you're doing\nsomething to have that relationship of\ntrust\nbecause it's a relationship and a\nrelationship relationship requires\ninvestment so what are some of the\ninvestments you're making\nevery morning every day that you feel\nlike giving you that sense of\nsome sense of structure and growth well\nyou have to find a way to get\nsort of quiet enough\npresent enough to notice the signs and\nsynchronicities\nand feelings of not only yourself but\nother people in your environment\nto navigate accurately where you're\ngoing i think\nto get more out of the head and into the\nbody of\nof of truly what's sort of like the\nuniverse guiding you through\nmessages through those people or\nsynchronicities\num but i would say one of my first\npractices of uh um\nfirst morning practices i changed this\nwas\nthis was i think fall of 18. so it was a\nlong time ago\ni stopped watching the news um\nand i think that was one of the first\nmost productive things so it wasn't\nsomething i actually\ndid it was something that i didn't do\nanymore so i\nused to wake up in the morning i'd watch\nlike good morning america or\nyou know cnn or today show or whatever\ni'd watch\ni just that was my comfort zone it was\nlike a familiar pattern\nuh familiar sound in the morning and i\njust drink my coffee and make my\nbreakfast\nand then as soon as i stop doing that\nand this is something that everyone\nshould know is that\nanytime you want to change a pattern\nthere will always be discomfort\nso i remember like and it's not to like\nrevert back because that's the easy\nthing to do\nbut it's to try and figure out something\nto do\nlike maybe it triggers something else\nthat you do so what i started doing\nis i started watching youtube videos and\nlike watching you on youtube or watching\nour buddy lewis on youtube or abraham\nhicks on youtube or\nwhatever it was i'd start watching\nyoutube videos and\num and that was what really kind of like\ngave me a new morning\nroutine um in fact i think i just posted\nabout it the other day it was like so\nthis is my morning news and it was like\nbreakfast with\nlike a teal swan video or something and\nso\nthat's that's like that became the norm\nyears ago\ni love that that is such a big one i\nlove that that's so awesome like choose\nyour news\nlike you know like choose your news\nrather than uh\nlike you said you had to disrupt that\npattern\nand and that's the hardest thing to do\nand you're so right the morning\npattern and the morning mood is is\neverything\nlike it's everything and i think we we\njust start\nin the negatives and then spend the\nwhole day trying to climb up\nto the positive as opposed to like\nstarting in a strong place\nand then kind of being broken down\nthroughout the day which is which is\nbetter\nthan feeling like you're trying to play\ncatch up all day it's like school\nyou know when you start off with an f\nyou might still end up with a b at the\nend of it\nbut that first quarter all you're doing\nis playing catch up and you feel like\nyou're never going to get there but you\nstart\noff with an a and you end up with you\nknow i mean it just seems so much easier\nto keep your grades up like when and\ntrust me i'm\nreally scrapping for history here\nbecause i'm in school i was 16.\num but you know it's it's like that\nwhole thing of just playing catch-up or\nor for me in my racing career it was\nit felt like if you could start off in\nthe championship in a really strong way\nin the first sort of five races or so\nit felt like you were always ahead of\nthe game instead of playing catch-up\nfrom a couple dnfs to start the season\noff so um it's the same thing you know\nmicro macro with your day itself in the\n24 hours that you have\nso now i'd say in the last like sort of\neight months i've become much more\nregular with the routine of waking up in\nthe morning\nand um rolling over and it started when\ni lived in indiana for the summer with\nmy parents\nand i have meditation pillows and so i\njust like threw it down on the ground\nand\nit wasn't a big bedroom i was staying in\nand so\nthere wasn't a lot of space so i just\nthrew it next to the bed and i ended up\nrealizing\noh that's perfect like you get up and\nyou just go sit down\nlike that's the right spot to put it so\nthen when i moved back to arizona and\nyou know\ngot my house and filled my you know my\nmeditation spot\nup like it was it's just right next to\nthe bed\nand so i get up and um i sit down\nand i meditate and then sometimes i\njournal\nsometimes i pull cards like i burn\nthings whether it be palo santo or\ncertain\nincense um as we talked about in our\ninterview like what was it\nsal sight set what was it again sight\nsense and sounds\nyes yes so setting that up and um\nand then sometimes like you know this\nmorning i did yoga afterwards but\nsometimes it's just going to the kitchen\nand having coffee\num i really i for a little while i was\ngoing to the\nkitchen and having coffee and then\ncoming back and i'm like no no\nno i took like the body under control\nand i went i know you want to\nautomatically walk to that kitchen and\nget the coffee that you want to have but\nlike take control of that and say i am\nin it is my\ndecision what i do with the body and\nit's going to sit down and it's going to\nmeditate now\num the one thing that i'm trying to do\nand this is like\ni was just thinking about this the other\nday and it's funny i\nwas about to go to bed and i was\nstarting to\ndo what i wanted to do and i was like\nwait a second my mom hasn't texted me\nback today\nand i left her a pretty good message\nlike i thought she would have responded\ni better not this is what i want to do\nturn my either leave my phone in the\nkitchen\nso that i don't go to bed and wake up\nlooking at messages\nfor some reason i have a default to like\nlook at my messages\nlike first thing and it's my alarm if i\nneed an alarm so i'm like\ni need to get one of those old school\nclocks\nand i need to leave my phone in the\nkitchen or\nbecause i also think of emf like\nradiation like\nsignals so i think so then i'm at a\nminimum i could at least turn\nmy phone on you know off of wi-fi and\nonto airplane mode next to me\nand then not so i won't actually have\nnothing will have come through in the\nnight anyway\nand then once i'm ready i can still use\nit as an alarm but then when i'm ready i\ncan turn on\nall my systems and go but that's what i\nneed to do next but it was like the\nother night like\nthe ego was like your mom might not be\nokay\nand i didn't i remember when i first\ntrained myself to not look at my phone\nfirst in the morning\ni used to lock my devices in my car\noutside so i would lock my laptop my\nphone like all my devices outdoors\nso that i couldn't even like get up and\ngo and grab it from the other room\nbecause i knew that it was\ntoo hard because you're right i was so\nhardwired\nand i started waking up to a post-it\nnote that says\ni am awareness or i am the soul or some\nsort of\nspiritual affirmation that that\nresonates with me\nand it would be in my handwriting it's\non a little post-it note next to my desk\nand then now i've started to change that\nsometimes for a little quote that i read\nin the morning\nor there's like just a highlighted line\nin a book\nand and i feel like when you start off\nthat way you stop your mind\nstarting with anxieties like i get\nanxious i get worried i\nyou know i i uh can wake up feeling\nyou know misaligned and that changes as\nsoon as the first\nthought you consume from the external\nworld is a thought that is\naligned and a thought that is powerful\nand whether it's from someone's favorite\nbook or\neven from someone's favorite podcast and\ni i love that idea that you're sharing\non\nhelping yourself to stop you know to\nstop\nlooking at your phone fest in the\nmorning and i love the idea of the\nmeditation\nuh pillow right there i i think that's\nthat's brilliant it's a it's a visual\nreminder and i think we need these\nvisual triggers and reminders to not\nhave to make every decision in our head\nmake it as easy as we can make it right\nnot put it in another room where you're\nlike oh i haven't been in my meditation\nroom in a while\nlike it's that whole it's definitely\nit's like as every time i walk by to go\nto my bed\ni have to walk by my table and walk by\nwalk by the pillow walk by my rug walk\nby\neverything i put a lot of intention into\nsetting up\nso that the space is ready um and to\nmake it beautiful too i'd say that too\nlike\nyou know if you want to create a\npractice like\nwhy wouldn't you decorate it why\nwouldn't you make it beautiful why\nwouldn't you make it inviting why\nwouldn't you put a beautiful\nrug down why wouldn't you have a pillow\nyou know it doesn't have to be\nlike drill sergeant kind of like\nuh something something um that you have\nto endure\nlike enjoy it my meditation table my\naltar has\npictures of my family pictures of my\ndogs\nit has um you know crystals and certain\nsignificant things that i've picked up\nalong the way it has\na mala that i do mantras to or it has a\npendulum that i'll ask questions to it\nhas\ndecks of cards that i can pull from it\nhas books it has\njournals like it's beautiful yeah oh i\nlove that i had no idea\ni love hearing about your altar that's\nbeautiful it sounded you rem\ni'm gonna backtrack a little you\nreminded me when you're saying you're\nwalking past the pillow it reminded me\nof like a mindful walk of shame\nit's like you're walking past this this\nbeautiful space to be mindful and you\nlike feel\nthe positive guilt of i should use this\nspace tell us about\noh now i want to talk about your altar\nthat sounds so amazing i\ni think the idea of having an altar\nso i grew up with an altar in my home\nand you know my parents\ngrew up hindu and so having an altar has\nbeen a very normal part of my life\nand having deities and having um\ncrystals and malas and everything you\nwere saying like\nand books very very normal in my house\nand then even now my wife and i have our\naltar\nin our home here and we've placed our\naltar and our meditation space as the\nheart of our house so\nwhenever anyone comes to our home it's\nthe first place you see everyone walks\nthrough it\nit's it's the first place i see after i\nwake up and come upstairs\nuh tell us a bit about like i i you\nalready dived into it but\ni love the idea of setting up an altar\nif someone doesn't know what that\nis or if someone's more new to that\nconcept\nwhy has it been helpful and how did you\neven discover that was that common in\nyour home or background or something\nyou're aware of\nno this actually started um back in\nnorth carolina\nwhen i lived there i lived there for\nfive years and\ni had i feel like i don't know where i\npicked it up but it was like a\ni was in for a while i was picking up\nthings at\nantique stores and it was like this old\nlittle cart thing\nand it started really slowly where\nit was just the extra room where it\nwould be like a pool table or something\nlike that would go in it\nnear the right off the pool in the\nbackyard and then i was like can i move\nsome of this stuff over and then i was\nlike i'll do a little yoga and then it\nwas like what if i move it all the way\nto the corner and then i\ngo in the middle of the room and then\nwhat if i move that out and\nlet's paint this room and then what if i\nbuy a bunch of little knick-knacks and\nstart hanging them and so like i\nprogressively kind of made this\nmy room which is when i wrote a book a\ncouple years ago called pretty intense\num\ni have a whole chapter in dedicated to\nyour woman cave because it always seems\nlike guys have like their man cave but\nthat's so true they'll have their wool\nman cave so\nit started like that and then i had this\ntable and i started just putting things\non it that i\nlike books and things like that and then\nit just sort of like\nmigrated into being a meditation table\nand i had\nyou know my eye pillow i had like\nlavender spray and i had all kinds of\nlittle things\non this table and i was like wow and\nback in those days if i would be sitting\nthere meditating\ni would have been called weird so i\ndidn't do it as much\nbut i had like a meditation table and i\nwould do it sometimes when i was alone\nbut it was also originally really just a\nplace to\nput a lot of really meaningful things to\nme\num and i think if i'm pulling from like\nyou know where i grew up and culture\nit's like almost feels blasphemous to\nsay you have an\naltar right yeah yeah i was wondering if\nthat was the case\nyeah yeah and i and and since i i didn't\ngrow up in\nchurch i didn't i in fact my mom said\nnot long\nlike a year or so ago she was like i'm\nsorry i didn't take you guys to church\ni'm like\nthat's okay um and not because there's\nanything wrong with it just because it\nkept my scope really open\nand um and so and and also i don't have\nthose\nreally negative attachments of sort of\nit being blasphemous or wrong\num and it's the intention that matters\nthat's what i focus on so this intention\nof a space that's really dedicated to\nto loving not only myself but loving\npeople in my life\nand aspects of my life so that's kind of\nhow it started\num but i think that i really think that\nthat's kind of what whole\ni would guess that's what holds a lot of\npeople back from creating what they\nwould call an\naltar um you probably even heard me call\nit like a meditation table or\njust because it's lingo that's not\nyes yes it's just like a little more a\nlittle more\num inappropriate or i do the same\ni i can relate to that i do the same all\nthe time i'll say my meditation\nspace or whatever and it's yeah it's\njust because\nyou you don't want to you don't want to\nalienate what's i mean the definition of\nalter to me the definition of alter\ni actually i really don't know what is\nthe definition of altar\ni i don't know about the english\ndictionary definition but i know about\nthe definition of um\nfrom from a spiritual vedic place it\nwould be\nthat this is considered the\nthe temple within your home so and and\nwhat is a temple there temple is\na place that reminds you of your\neternal connection with higher energy\nthe divine the source\nso a place that is of spiritual memory\nuh would be considered the definition of\nyou know having a temple in your home\nuh a place that reminds you of of who\nyou are what you believe in and what you\nreally care about\nyou know for a while so um\ni i i went to i've gone all\nto all kinds of churches in my life i\nbecame a catholic\nat one point in my life and went to that\nchurch and then i\nwent to baptist church and then i didn't\ngo to any church and i started off going\nto no church\nbut i remember what i always used to be\nable to say even in the very beginning\ngoing to church\n[Music]\nwas that i i really felt like\ni could be just as spiritual just as\nreligious\nat home and it doesn't take this\nbuilding to make it happen\nand in fact if i don't show up here and\nget a message\nwhat's the point that's blasphemous\nright\num so i've always had this innate\nknowing that\nlike it's not some destination that is\nlike opening up some space portal or\npermission to like live a certain way or\nbe\nbe uh be\nloved on some like like religious\nspiritual level um i don't i don't\nsubscribe to that\nso yeah i encourage everyone to have\ntheir own altar like\nyeah whatever that means yeah have your\nown nook your own corner\ni think it's just it it helps kind of\nadd to this sort of idea of like make\nthe space beautiful\nif you had a spot that was filled with\nthings that made you smile\nwouldn't you want to go there exactly\nand we don't have that\nwe don't have that i think that's a\ngreat great tip and great insight and\ni don't think we've ever shared that\nmessage on the podcast before i i think\nit's a really really\ngreat idea and i loved how you described\nit there a place that\nmakes you smile dan again your career\nthough it's\nobviously you've had to be an extremely\ndisciplined\nfocused individual to achieve what\nyou've achieved it doesn't come through\nanything but that hard work tell us\nabout\nthe idea of building a habit because\nyou had to build habits to become a\nsuccessful race car driver you've\nnow built different habits to focus on\nyour spiritual journey\nif someone's listening and watching and\ngoing how do i build better habits like\ni just\ni can't get myself even if i built this\nbeautiful decorated room and i put the\npillow down but\ni just walked past it and now i feel\nguilty that i don't meditate and\ni keep hearing everyone tells me to do\nyoga and pilates and meditation but i\nyou know and and some and i'm sure you\nmeet people who say this to you all the\ntime like\nwhere does someone start with habit\nformation from your experience of\nbuilding habits\nwell first off i think it's very\ndifficult to just say\neveryone should xyz\nbecause it might not really be for you\num i think there are so many different\nmindful modalities of life and\ni know that i don't do all of them i do\nsome of them\nso i think the important part is\nfiguring out which\nof those some really\nare for you and easy for you like it\ndoesn't have to be hard\nyou know maybe for someone it's getting\nup in the morning and writing five\nthings that they're\nreally grateful for and that feels easy\nfor them it's not something i do\nyou know but that is a practice of\nmindfulness\nof gratitude of spirituality of\ngetting in the right mindset so for me i\nthink that it's more a matter of like\ntesting the waters of a bunch of\ndifferent things that you could do that\nmake you\nfeel good um and and so that's really\njust comes through testing\nit just comes through testing some\npeople you know\nsome people are gonna love meditation\nsome people are gonna really love\nyoga some people are really going to\nlove a walk with their dog\nsome people there's so many different\nways to\nconnect with yourself to create\npractices\num and habits and so i guess maybe\nnot thinking about and not thinking\nabout habits as being like\nall these are the ones that you have to\nsubscribe to\num go with the ones that feel natural to\nyou like go with the ones that feel\ngood like i love to work out guess what\nit's a habit you know if i hated to work\nout i'd probably try and choose a\ndifferent sort of\nform of you know being\nmoving my body other than going in a gym\nand throwing some weights around\num so and and i think i think it's\nreally about following what it is that\nit feels like is\nnatural for you um and then\nit always ends up at a deeper level i\nmean we treat others as we treat\nourselves so if you feel like you're\nworth the time to have a habit\nlike then you tend to respect others\nthat do too\nso it always just starts with yourself\nit starts with the self-worth enough\nthat you deserve the time to\ntake an hour to go work out or take a\nhalf an hour to go\nmeditate or take an hour and a half to\ngo to a yoga class like\nit starts with believing that you\ndeserve it and then also\nyour why like why are you doing it are\nyou doing it because you have to\nare you doing it because you are being\nguilted are you doing it because someone\ntold you this is what's going to be good\nfor you\nare you doing it because you want to\nfeel good\nare you doing it because it does feel\ngood are you doing it because you\nenjoy the place that you arrive at when\nyou're done doing it\num find your why like i mean as a as\nlike a specific example\nit could be pretty regimented like with\nmy food i'm very um\nyou know i don't eat gluten and dairy\nand beans\nthere's like a bunch of things i don't\neat and it's and it's really easy for me\nto stick with it because\nof my why which is that i\nwant to feel good and so i know that\nwhen i\neat things that are not in that in my\nsort of\nnormal um lineup that it makes me either\nfeel bloated or distended\nor you know whatever it can cause\nbreakouts it can\nyou know there's a lot of other things\nand i'm like i just don't want to feel\nbad\nso it makes my it makes it easier to do\nit so when you know\nwhy you're doing it you keep going it's\nlike another example specific example\nwould be\nsay you're going on a beach vacation and\nyou got to put a swimsuit on\nguy or girl and you're like\nyou're really good about what you eat\nand working out for\na couple of months before you go because\nyou have your why\nright it's like makes things or you're\ngetting married and\nyou know especially girls are like i'm\ngetting married you know and like\nyou have your why it makes the job a lot\neasier when you know\nwhy you're doing it so having a why is\nalso helpful\ni think there's a great piece of advice\ni i've been going on about this on the\npodcast but it's it's been real for me\nand it's\nwhat you're saying definitely a line so\ni've never enjoyed\ngoing to the gym or working out but i've\nalways enjoyed sports\nso i love sports extremely athletic\nenjoy\ncompetition like fun competition and\nback and forth\nand during the pandemic\nand since i've really moved to the us i\nused to play football soccer\ntwice thrice a week in london because\nall my friends play and that's where i\ngrew up and\nwe'd play after work in the evenings and\nthen when i moved to the united states\nfor the first two years i lived in new\nyork\nand i was very busy with my career and\ndidn't really make that much time for it\nand then when i moved to la\ni realized that getting 22 people to\nplay a game of football was pretty\ndifficult\nuh any weekend like that's pretty tough\nto do\nand i recently took up tennis\nand i'm not good at tennis i i haven't\nplayed tennis historically\nbut i'm absolutely in love with it\nbecause it's playful\nit's fun i run and sweat more than i\never would if i went to the gym and i\nwas on a treadmill\nand i feel like i start my day just with\nthis like\nchildlike enthusiasm because it reminds\nme of being at school or you know that\nkind of feeling of like i just played a\ngame of tennis at the beginning of the\nday\nand and i do that every i do that about\nthree four mornings a week now\nand not only am i getting better at\ntennis but the idea of what you're\nsaying is like you've got to have fun\nwith it\nand my wife for exercising has always\nbeen to stay healthy\nand to never let my bad health be my own\ncause like that's always been a very\nclear thing for me it's like\nif something's gonna happen to me if it\ncomes from the outside that's fine i\ndon't want to be\nthe one creating it for myself because\nof my negligence or whatever it may be\nand you know but the why for me of going\nto the gym or like that feeling just\nnever worked for me because i've never\nreally been\ninto like oh look at my muscles or this\nthat's not been my why\nbut for me the idea of feeling happy\nevery morning like you said\nfeeling good uh you know it's a huge one\nso yeah i encourage everyone because for\nages i didn't feel like i enjoyed\nworking out and i kept questioning\nlike what i was going to do to stay fit\nand then when you find it it's like oh\nthis is so obvious\nbut uh it's it's been life-changing you\ncan order your eggs a million ways in\nthe morning you can do a million\ndifferent workouts you can do a\nmillion different mindfulness mindful\npractices\num there's something for everybody out\nthere so just because you don't fit into\none box that somebody's talking about\ndoesn't mean\nthat uh you can't do it you know yeah\nyeah i heard you say something on a\npodcast with our good mutual friend\nrachel hollis\ni believe uh and and you and it really\nstuck with me i think it's a really\npowerful statement\nand and it's it's not counterintuitive\nto what we said it's\nit's complementary but it's also\nexposing a different truth and you said\nthat i've never experienced\ngrowth without pain and\nand you know and and i think that that's\nso true as well that\nyou know we don't always experience that\ntell me about\nwhere that lesson just where in your\nlife have you felt that that's just\nbeen so true and and something where\nyou've got more used to that as well\ni mean it's happened a lot especially in\nthe last\nfour or five years and it comes in the\nform of\njobs changing relationships changing\nfriends changing um\nit can get the whole your new life's\ngonna cost your old one\nsaying it's it's um\nand that's hard because if we're going\ninto another sort of\naspect of things and it's this this idea\nof\nchange and that we're not i don't think\nwe're actually all that\nsad about where we're going because the\nidea is that you're improving\nand you're expanding um but\nthere is an aspect of you that has to\nlet someone thing else\ndie and deaths are always sad um\nso the sun the idea that you'll never\nsee someone again\num you know never live here again never\ngo to this job again never park in that\nspot again\nthere's the the nevers are the things\nthat have to we have to sort of die to\nthat\nand die to the dream like because i i\nmean\nyou know it's in changing there's\nessentially an\nidea that something isn't going to\nhappen that was going to happen and so\nit's when that has to go away that you\nhave to allow that\nthat that dream to die and\ni think that's also a really painful\nthing however\nyou know on the other side of it you\nknow this is why when\nbig things happen and the growing pains\nhappen you come out the other side and\nyou're like\noh that wasn't that bad like you know\nyou because you're ending up somewhere\nbetter ideally um so\ni guess for me it's come in the form of\ntrue emotional breakdowns like i mean\njust like where i like get it resonating\nin my body i can\nfeel it i can feel it and like i always\nget a lot of action in my solar plexus\num sometimes in my heart but definitely\nmy solar plexus sometimes\ni have this horrible thing where um i\nfeel it in my body before i know it in\nmy mind\nso that's a real bummer so i'm like wait\nwhat's going on with my\nwhy don't i feel why can't i i ate a\nstrawberry\nand i feel like i'm gonna buckle over\nthat's not right like\nyou know my body's like\nand then you know it's cut it sort of\nfollowed you know within\nthe next days by something that\nis emotional and a breakdown of some\nsort and all of a sudden there's usually\nlike a big flood of information that\ncomes through\num but yeah it's it's it's that pain or\neven on a smaller level\nexplaining me not watching the news\nanymore\nright so i wake up in the morning and\nit's while it's not maybe painful and i\ndon't have some sort of\nphysical reaction going on but i kind of\nhave a little bit of a mental one or\nyou know a little bit of an emotional\none where i'm thinking well i want to\nwatch tv\nand it's like no this shift is going to\nbe uncomfortable\nand um so it falls it's a scale\nyou know there's you know it's it's\nhappened in all facets of my life\nand uh you know i also describe it like\nyou know with with messages that come\nthrough to us\nas the universe comes knocking for what\nis it what we resist persists\nso you know it's like it's knocking on\nthe door and\nthen it's like pounding on the door and\nthen it breaks the door down and then it\ncomes in it can't find you and it burns\nyour house down because you're somewhere\nin there\nand that shadow is hiding somewhere i've\nexperienced that i know what that feels\nlike yeah\ndefinitely definitely and what is what\nhas made you\nwhere have you become more comfortable\nwith letting go like\ni loved what you explained about the i\nwon't be able to park at that spot again\nor go to that job again i won't see that\nperson again like\ni think that was such a when you were\nrepeating those things i was like yeah\nthose are the things we really worry\nabout like that's what we're holding on\nto\nit's that repetition it's that security\nit's that\ncomfort it's that consistency that's\nwhat you're\nlosing how have you become better if you\nhave or\nhow have you become better at processing\nletting any of those things go\nin a way that you think our listeners\ncould today maybe\nlearn apply take a few of those things\nbecause i think\ni i mean letting go is probably the\nhardest human emotion\nof anything right of any of the things\nyou have to let go because\nwe get so intimately connected with\nsomething\nit's the familiarity of the discomfort\nit's that whole\nand this is where you start to learn\nthat all these like silly sayings are\ntrue it's like finding comfort in the\ndiscomfort\nand and the comfort is just just really\njust familiarity you're like oh got it\ni've been here before i know how this\ngoes\nand you you can sort of lessen the blow\nby surrendering a little bit more to it\nbecause it's in the resisting and the\ngripping\nthat your house has to get burned down\nso just don't let it get to that point\nwhere you can just go\nokay not for me and that comes with like\ngoing all the way back to\nthe beginning of the conversation about\ngetting quiet enough that you can start\nto\nfeel and notice the signs and some\nsynchronicities\nand like the doors that are opening and\nclosing for you\ninstead of um being so like\nattached to this idea of how things are\nsupposed to go\num i also think i have a little bit of\nan easier time because i'm\ni'm a future thinker instead of a past\nthinker so i think it is burdened on\nthose who\nare really like uh symptoms of that\nwould be someone who's like really\nnostalgic\num someone who has a hard time forgiving\nsomeone who is um\nyou know sentimental which is kind of\nlike nostalgic but someone who um\nreally ruminates on the past i mean\num yeah i think i think there's a little\nbit of a harder time for someone like\nthat because\nit's it's it's you're associated with\nmemories so now\nyou're being told you got to let go of\nthose memories so but if you keep\nthinking thoughts of the past they start\nbe\nthey they can only be created in the\nfuture and so you know you've got to\nyou've\njust got to learn to let go of them i\nmean look a future caster has their own\nissues to deal with\ndestination syndrome but um but i think\nit gets easier to move on and allow that\nchange when you can just um and you know\nmaybe it's uh i like to shift my mindset\nfrom going from like\noh shoot like because i i think like\neveryone else when something comes\nyou're like\nno and then i'm like but what if it's\nbetter than i could ever\nimagine yes and i like trick myself into\nthinking like but what if it's gonna be\nbetter\nand the idea is that it should be yes\nyes it always is somehow let the\ncontribution into your\nyou know into the universe that you've\nbeen putting through contrast and\nexperiences and dreams and\nvisualizations\nlet it get delivered to you because if\nyou keep hanging on to that\nyou're not gonna get that right and so\nyou've gotta like allow that to happen\nbut you've gotta surrender and make\nspace\nyou've gotta make space in your world\nyou got to make space in your\nin your emotions and your perception\nbecause your perception becomes reality\nso\nyou know there's a letting go it's like\nalso\nmaybe this is something applicable for\npeople listening is that when i retired\ni looked at it like a letting go not\nquitting and so learn the difference\nbetween\nletting go and quitting because wow\nthere's a really it's a nuanced\ndifference and to me\nit came and this is about being able to\nbe present but\nwith the letting go it's it's it's you\nmaking an\neffort and an effort and an effort and\nthen you go wait a minute\nit shouldn't be this hard and then you\njust let it go\neven though it might be you quitting\nretiring walking away\nwhatever it is you tried\nand so when you know you've tried that's\nnot quitting it's like\nseeing the signs and so for me and my\nat the end of my career that's what i\nhad to realize was that you know i'd\nnever had a problem with a sponsor\nbefore and they\nthey left at the beginning of the year i\nhad all these other projects going on\nthat i had never had going on all these\nother businesses starting\num sponsor wasn't coming along and so\ni'm looking at like\nall these things are happening and i'm\ni'm like you know what and i'm not that\nhappy when i go to the track and i'm\nlike\num i'm gonna look at all these signs and\nsigns and synchronicities and symptoms\nand um and just i'm this is letting go\nthis is not for me anymore but we become\nso identified you know\nof course like we become and that's why\nit's so important to\nuh nurture other aspects of yourself\ndiversify it's like a portfolio for\nanyone who invests or has an investor\nyou know look at yourself like a\nportfolio don't put all your eggs in one\nbasket don't be all in\nall in stocks and not in bonds or\nwhatever\nwhatever your financial advisor does\nit's all about like diversifying so that\nyou have stability because\nthen no matter what happens one aspect\ndrops out and you have other to support\nothers to support you\ngreat insight i i absolutely couldn't\nagree more with you on that i think\ni think the idea of\nyou know just yeah just the idea of\ncreating\nspace to to really let go and to realize\nthat you can't\nchange the direction you want to go in\nif you are still holding on tight\nto something that's being taken away\nfrom your grasp anyway\nand and often that's what creates more\nfriction and more tension is when you're\ndesperately holding on to something that\ndoesn't exist anymore\nuh and and you know it and you're so\nright about it\nbeing we always we always ask the\nquestion like what if\nsomething goes bad and like your idea of\nlike well what if there is an\nopportunity here for the best thing ever\nso i mean this has been amazing danica\ni've been so grateful for\nyour time we end every on-purpose\nepisode with the final five so this is\none word or one sentence maximum uh so\nthis is your final five danica are you\nready\nyeah okay so the first question is\nwhat's the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nhave fun ah nice okay\nwhat's one piece of advice you wish\npeople would stop giving\ni'm so guilty of it opinions\nyou should wait for someone to ask for\nthem i'm literally practicing this in my\nlife i'm like\nonly an opinion when someone asks for it\n[Laughter]\nabsolutely it's funny sometimes i find\nlike my friends are like\njay why do you never why didn't why\ndon't you like\ntell us all the stuff you share in your\npodcast in your book and i'm like\nbecause in my social relationships i'm\ni'm just like\ni'm just hanging you know because i i\nrelate to what you're saying like i just\ndon't i'm not\ni am me fully internally but i don't try\nand be that in my social circles until\ni'm asked for it so i\ni relate i think that's a really good\nanswer because yeah\nit's otherwise it can be painful to give\nadvice all the time and not see it being\nlived\nbut also i think that sometimes we\nrefrain from\nasking for an opinion sometimes\nbecause we're scared but also like look\nat it like a form of respect\nif somebody wants my opinion on\nsomething or advice\nthat's a form of respect this is a this\nis a form of\num communication of relating\nof um connecting\nyeah i couldn't agree more all right\nquestion number three\nuh what's the biggest lesson you learned\nin the last 12 months\nthat i was supposed to be choosing\nmyself all along like\nmy relationships were all about like\nthis is how it's gonna go\nand they're not choosing me and then i'm\nlike\noh god that's because i was supposed to\nbe choosing myself thanks mir\nthanks great big beer love you hate you\nlove you so\nyeah it's like when we when we treat\nourselves a certain way\nthat's how we teach others to treat us\nand so you know\ni i didn't choose myself all the time\nand didn't prioritize myself um\nenough in certain aspects so um yeah\nthat's that was the last that was the\nlesson yeah\nwhat's uh what's a skill or a habit or a\nmindset that you've learned\nnow that you think would have helped you\nas a race car driver\nmore telepathy\nyou know i think that uh\ni i probably still didn't visualize\nenough\nvisualization is so helpful\ni mean shoot they've proven that you can\nliterally\nincrease your muscle mass with your mind\nyep so i guess i would have done more\nvisualization\nyeah beautiful that's that's a great\nanswer i i\ni mean i remember a whole section of my\nbook is dedicated to visualizations and\nmeditation because\ni'm such a big believer i remember\nreading years ago about how\nlewis hamilton and and david beckham\nvisualize\neverything and so you know that's that's\na beautiful one and obviously you didn't\nneed it you did it\nyou succeeded without it so uh but but\nbut it's a nice it's a nice addition to\neverything\nelse i remember doing it when i was a\nkid and go-karting and i did it like i'd\nvisualize a perfect lap before\nqualifying but i'm saying like\nyou know i did like i said in go-karting\ni'm sitting there like i don't even know\nwhat this is but i'm like visualizing my\nperfect lap\nexecuting it but there's always more of\nthat right if a little is good a lot is\nbetter\nyeah i could have visualized more\nperfect passing more perfect laps more\nperfect finishes\nvisualizing myself winning i think i\ncould have done more\ni love that that's great advice thank\nyou for that and fifth and final\nquestion\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be\ni say this hesitantly it's because i\nthink that it always comes out anyway\nand if it was\nalready put out on the front end it\nwould reduce a lot of confusion\nhowever it will be a different world\nbut it's something i seek every day and\nthat's just\ntruth i'm such a truth seeker\nand i feel like it always comes out\nanyway and if you can't understand\nwhat's going on it's because you don't\nhave enough information\nbecause there's not enough truth\nincluded and so\ni i think that i i just would say that\neveryone would have to be\ntruthful um i mean i'd also like to\ncaveat that with\nkindness but you know sometimes the\ntruth hurts too\nand um you know if we can look at it\nfrom a more sort of\nquantum or spiritual perspective of that\nyou know everybody's just a reflection\nof us then we really\nwe really see a lot we would really see\na lot\nthat's great thank you so much danika\nthat's been an amazing time spending\nwith you everyone go and\nsubscribe to danica's podcast pretty\nintense\nand you can order a book by the same\ntitle to find out more about that woo\nman cave i love that\nand danika again thank you so much for\nbeing so generous with your time and\nenergy with us and i can't believe we\nstill haven't met\nso i'm looking forward to that day when\nwe can be in the same room together\nuh and share some energy and share more\nof these great insights so i really\nreally look forward to that\ni would just love that i'm so it makes\nme sad that we couldn't do this in\nperson but um\ni uh i i know that day will come and it\nmight not be in the form of a podcast\nand maybe that's the luck is that maybe\nif we just let go of this idea that it\nwas supposed to happen for the interview\nand now we get to go like have lunch or\ndinner and meet your wife and maybe\nmaybe maybe it's going to come in a\nwhole different\nmore expansive form awesome well thank\nyou danica thank you for your time"
