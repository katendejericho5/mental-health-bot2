    "transcript": "you have to tap into suffering every day\nof your life because we have so\nmuch scarring that we have to clean up\nyou have to look at suffering as almost\nlike i look at failure\nto succeed you must fail\nin failure and in suffering all the\nanswers\nare in there all the answers to all the\ntest questions the test is your life\nall the answers are in there you have to\nlive in suffering and pain and failure\nall the time\nyou have to learn i need to visit it\nlike people hate working out\nyou're only going to visit working out\nmaybe an hour a day\n23 other hours of the day you're not in\nit\nbut how you become in shape is you must\nvisit\nsuffering visit working out one hour a\nday\nvisit suffering one hour a day visit\nyour past failures\none hour a day the relationship with it\nis the answers are in there\nthey they are in there within the\nsuffering go in there\nand i call it the live autopsy the live\nautopsy how you find out someone died\nthey crack you open after you're dead\nhow you can live\nis do it while you're alive go back in\nyour brain crack it open\nwhile you're alive don't wait until\nyou're [ __ ] dead\nto figure out why you died do it while\nyou are living\ngo in there go into the suffering go\ninto the pain of your life and say why\ndoes this suck for me so bad\nwhy am i afraid of all this stuff why\nhave i shut down the whole world\ni guarantee i'll tell you why you shut\ndown the whole world it's in these\nnooks of the suffering within your brain\nin the scarring\nare all the answers to why you are on\nthe couch feeling sorry for yourself\nthey lie within the scars visit them\nfor at least an hour a day study them\nand then you'll find out more about\nyourself you will then grow\nso don't look at us every day i suffer\ngo into it an hour a day\nlearn from yourself learn from life\nlearn from your failures learn from your\ninsecurities\nlearn from your self doubt don't just\nsay i'm afraid to jump off an airplane\nwhat makes you afraid of it study it\nthat's why i studied my mind why i\nbecame so powerful in the mind\nbecause i realized i was weak so instead\nof running away from the mind\ni dove into and say what is making me\nweak oh\nthis makes sense i came from hell\ni came from a place that beat me down to\nnothing\nwhich is why i'm afraid all this makes\nsense\nso systematically one by one i went back\nand met every single person in my mind\nevery situation i went one-on-one with\nthem again\nin my mind it said okay let's\nnow revisit this and that's how you do\nit that's how it works\nabsolutely man that is i love that\nthat's brilliant advice\nbrilliant advice because it's ultimately\nit's observing\nand self-study that's it like observing\nand self-study becoming an expert\nin observation of one's self and\nthe reason why that that process\ncan be so challenging or that process is\nbecause like you said and i love that\nyou literally went through and re-met\nevery person that caused you pain\neverybody loved that and guess what\npeople say how'd you do that\nyou know every painful moment\nyeah you remember you remember it we try\nto put it under a rug\nlift the rug up you'll find them yeah\nthe dust will come up yeah it'll come up\nquick\nyeah so yeah that's how that's how i was\nable to write that book\nyou don't forget that [ __ ] you want to\nyeah and that's where you fail\nby trying to forget it that's what you\nfeel that's where there's no growth\nlet's just move forward from all this\nyeah there's no growth there there's no\ngrowth there no you just wanna you just\nwanna forget about it\nyeah you will continue making the same\n[ __ ] up mistake\nyeah you will continue doing the same\nthings wrong if you don't go back\nyeah and the challenge we have is when\nwe do revisit it when someone tries or\nstarts they end up revisiting it but\nthen we end up\nand we me too all of us like i'm not\nsaying when i'm whenever i'm referring\nit's me too\nit's it's also we become complaining or\ncriticizing or preparing so\nwe do start like i know a lot of people\nand myself too\ni sometimes start revisiting something\nright but then i just use it as a crutch\nor an excuse then i'm still not getting\nthere that's right and the same thing\nyeah right i'll do the same thing how\nhave you broke through that times when\nthat's happened sometimes\nso as i'm talking and as i'm going back\ni'm very aware that i'm going to do that\nyes\nand i may do it for 45 minutes\nand then i'm like you knew you're going\nto do this\nyou have to be very aware of the\nconversation you're having while you're\ndoing it\nbecause your mind chooses the path of\nleast resistance\nyour mind has the ultimate tactical\nadvantage over you\nit knows what scars you it it it knows\nyour fears\nit knows your insecurities and it\nprotects you which i talked about the 40\nrule in my book the 40 rules all about\nthe brain has the tactical advantage\nover you it knows and it keeps you away\nfrom all that\nthat's why it says don't jump out of an\nairplane don't go in the ocean where\nthere's sharks\nit's a protective mechanism don't go\nback to the place where your dad beat\nthe [ __ ] out of you in your mind\ndon't go back the brain protects you\nbut protects you so much it doesn't\nallow growth\nso the brain is an amazing thing but the\nbrain controls you\nyou must control it you must take power\nover your own mind\nor your mind will guide you into all the\nsoft spikes\nsoft places that your brain wants to\nlive in\nyour brain has enough information it\ndoesn't want to go through that process\nof of mind hardening he doesn't want to\ndo that\ni gotta remember what time i gotta be\nhere what time i gotta be there\nthis is where i wanna stay i'm peaceful\nand wants to stay very peaceful away\nfrom scarring\nso that's that's what it is man yeah\nthat's what it is it's as simple as that\nand we just\nnever touch it like a like a box that\nyou need to look inside you just leave\nit there\nyou just mark it scar yeah put it up in\nthe attic\nnever touch again let it get dusty yeah\ni wanted to talk to you about this\nbecause when i was reading about it\nin the book it fascinated me because it\nreminded me of my my three-month boot\ncamp as a monk\nthe first the first three months i'm\nsharing with you earlier the first three\nmonths of\nof monk training is super intense like\nreally really tough because the whole\npoint of it is to figure out who's in\nand who's not\nright like they don't want people to\njust be passengers on this side it's not\na\nit's not a place you come to just have\nquiet and and don't do anything so\nthat three-month boot camp something\nthat taught me so much i'd love to hear\nabout\nhell week and specific programs you\nbuilt in your life that you went on\nand what did you learn from what did you\ntake away but tell us first a bit about\nthe program and then tell us about what\nyou learned so what i liked about your\nthree-month hell week yeah you know was\nthe fact that\nthat's where you find yourself you find\nyourself when you were\nthe at when you're not comfortable\nyou're not comfortable on a\ndaily basis and that's how i started to\ngrow\nlike i said about the mind it wants to\nput you in that nice 72 degree\ntemperature\nwith with everything right there it\nwants to be in that nice with a little\nmassage therapist\nthat's where your mind wants to be\ndoesn't want to be\nand we're going to talk about hell week\nso it doesn't want to be in hell week\nin hell week i i was in three of them i\nfinished two of them\nin one year only person never do that in\nstill history there's been people who\nwho have gone through a couple of hell\nweeks but in like five years\nsix years seven years eight years i did\ni was in three in one year\nthey say it takes off three to five\nyears of your life\nso hell week is 130 hours of continuous\ntraining\nyou might get two hours of sleep and\nwhat it does is\nit's designed to break a man\nto break a man down to the parts where\nlike i talk about the surface\nhow it's fixing the surface if you only\nfix the surface\nyou will never get through hell week\nbecause what it does it starts to bring\nout these demons\nbecause even though there's a lot of\nyelling and stuff like that there's\ntimes where it's very peaceful\nin a very eerie way so the first hour of\nthe 130\nis breakout they're shooting guns it's\nloud it's noisy your mind is\nin chaos when your mind's in chaos\nyou can't think so you're having fun\nyeah this is great yeah we're in hell\nwe're navy or trying to be navy seals or\nbad asses\nthen what they do and i don't even think\nthat they understand what they're doing\nbut i studied the mind it's perfect it's\npsychological warfare they go from an\nhour the first hour when you're going\ncrazy\nthe second hour of the 130 they put you\nin the cold water\nit's called surf torture now they don't\ncall it surf torture because it's a kind\nof gentler word it's called\nsurf acclimation or something like that\nwhatever\neverybody's getting soft so they call\nsurf torture\nfor a good reason they put you out there\nno one's quit yeah it's only been an\nhour\nmaybe a couple of guys have and you're\nin the pacific ocean which is never warm\nyou're all linked arms you're sitting\nthere and the waves are crashing over\nyou\ni went through winter hell weeks which\nis cold the pacific ocean is like 50\ndegrees it was 49\nthis particular night in my third hell\nweek\nand what it does is\nit makes your mind flip out we've been\ndoing this now for three weeks being in\nthis water\nbut for some reason now the water is\ncolder than it's ever been it's not\nour minds are fragile we can process\na day it's hard to process 130 hours\nthere's no end there's no end so the\nmind starts to ramp\nup so you're sitting there it's quiet no\none's yelling at you hear the ocean\n[Music]\nand you're freezing and your mind goes\n[ __ ]\nstarts to think of another 129\nhours you're not going home you're\ngetting yelled at\nyou can be frozen so you panic you freak\nout\nand you want to quit what i realize\nabout the mind is those people who can\nbe in that time\nand embrace that time and be in that\nmoment and not allow the mind\nto go to 129 hours on hour one\nit's the control that we don't have in\nour minds it's a control that you had to\nhave for three months\nwhen you're miserable when you're\nsuffering when you're laying on the\nfloor when you're doing all the\ndisciplines it takes to be a monk\nyou cannot think about the whole process\nit will make you it will it will make\nyou so\ninsanely crazy it's impossible\nit's inhumane what i'm about to do to\nmyself you have to be able to break\nall these big humongous painful things\nin life\ndown to the smallest molecule because\nthat's all the brain can handle\nthe brain can't handle hours and hours\nand hours of suffering\nbut it can handle right now i'm in the\npacific ocean\nand it's very cold and this is what i'm\ndoing\ndon't think about the rest of it so\nthat's what i learned from hell week\nthat's what i learned from being in\nthree hell weeks\nthat's what i learned from all the\nmilitary i went to ranger school i went\nto all these different schools\nto learn all of that to learn\nhow the mind process so i talk about\ntheorists\ni talk about practitioners a theorist is\na person who reads a book\ndoesn't do it reads a book learns about\nsomething\nand then talks about it a practitioner\nis myself\na practitioner is a person like me i\nwanted to be an expert in the mind\na mental toughness guy beyond mental\ntoughness the only way to do that in my\neyes\nis to put yourself in hell put in hell\nrepeatedly\nrepeatedly put yourself in hell and\nstudy how you\nprocess it and that's how i was able to\ncome up with all these different ways\nall these different tools to to slow the\nmind down\nin hell because the mind just speeds up\nthe mind wants to get out of the painful\nsituation the suffering it can't\nit can't process it so that's what i\nrealized by going through all these\ndifferent processes of\nbeing in hell weeks you know it's just\nthat i love that\nhow the mind process is in hell were you\never scared that you would lose\nthe processing ability to be able to\ncoach yourself through it were you ever\nscared when you're there\ni was there there's some times where the\nmind gets overwhelmed\nand you cannot slow it down but by\nthese these certain tools i developed by\nnot allowing your mind to get away from\nthe moment\nyou cannot you have to think about the\nexact moment that you're in\nbut i saw when i was younger the moment\nbecame too big\nit became too big i spazzed out and i\nwould quit\nbut now i don't think about even like an\nhour from now i'll be eating\ni don't even go there because then your\nmind\nno we must embrace this because now\nthere's you have to be a leader in this\nmoment it's not about you just getting\nthrough it\ni had six guys i had five guys and six\nincluding me in my boat crew\nnow as the boat crew leader so now\nanother trick is this\nif you don't think about yourself\nthere's no pain\nwhich can also lead to pain later on in\nyour life but in these moments when\nyou're struggling if you are a true\nleader\nand you're worried about your men or\nwomen beside you\nyour mind doesn't care how cold you are\nanymore your mind's only worried about\ntaking care of the men and women besides\nyou\nso i started realizing man if i take\ncare of these cats to my left and my\nright\nin the worst moments my mind is no\nlonger thinking about you're\nmiserable david goggins get the hell out\nof here think about how is john how is\nandy how was sam how was pete\nhey how are you guys doing you're not\nthinking about me so there's so many\nthings you can do to get outside your\nown head\nto then allow your body to be like hey\nwe're just a machine\nbut you have to let your mind be able to\nprocess all these different tactics\nto do that take a different vantage\npoint in life when you are\nin the hell you can't see the beauty of\nbeing in it when you're in it\nget on top of that mountain top in your\nmind guess what mountaintop and look\ndown in what you're doing\nyou can see a whole different world that\nworld is beautiful but you got to get a\ndifferent vantage point\nin this in the suck don't be in it\nspiritually get out of it get that soul\nlook down on what you're doing be amazed\nby the process of where you're at now\nand where you came from wow i've got\ni've got so many questions from that\ni've got so many questions for that okay\nlet's let's start with\nyou and i love that so you said one of\nthe tricks is when you stop thinking\nabout yourself because when there's no\nself there's no pain\nno pain and you start living for your\nteam the people the other people\nsuffering\ni love that totally understand that\nservant leadership\nwanting to go beyond oneself but you\npointed out something really fascinating\nyou said it can lead to pain later\nthat's right explain that because i i\nget that\nso i've had this mentality for years\nit got me through a lot of hard times\nyou cannot use it\nevery day of your life that's it yeah\nthat's what i think you cannot use it\ni use it as like my god this is the\nperfect\ni found it this is the trick you just\ntotally you don't even matter\nyou're just a machine you are a machine\nlike just just like a lever that's all\nyou are man\nyou're not you're not and\nin my book i talk about what that lever\nstarts to get rusty\nstarts to get crusty it starts to like i\ncan't even think about anybody but\nmyself so through the process what i\nstarted to learn\nwas that helps a lot and you can tap\ninto that all the time\nbut you have to be able to heal yourself\nyou have to be able to recover yourself\nit can't be something that you continue\nto do\nand do and do there has to be a recovery\nprocess for your mind your body your\nsoul your spirit\nencompasses your whole body so those are\ntactics\nbut those tactics must be oiled up that\nlever has to be oiled again\nto go back in it absolutely yeah it's\nit's not\nit's not an emergency use but it's used\nin specific moments exactly knowing you\ncan go back and it's so true that\nfor so many people who want to serve it\nbecomes the default\nand i made that mistake myself when i\nbecame a monk it was because\ni wanted to wake up every day and serve\nthat was my goal i was like i want to\nwake up every day\ni want to use everything i've been given\nto serve humanity i just want to serve\npeople i just want to give\nand i was just being that and so i would\ngo through sleepless nights i would push\nmyself for weeks on\nend to go further for other people and\nit was amazing because it felt\nfulfilling\nand it and it helped them too but after\na while i was broken\ni i lost my voice for six months i was\neating out of\ntubes for six months i was writing on a\nwhiteboard\nyou know it was just my whole life kind\nof crumbled i was sleeping 14 hours a\nday then because my life kind of went to\nthe other side\nbecause i'd worked so hard to just give\ngive give and i loved it\nbut in the process i broke myself\nbecause i wasn't refueling i wasn't\nrenewing that's right even though i was\nstill taking i was still meditating i'm\nstill doing everything\nyup i talked about that big time in my\nlast chapter how it just\ntakes me to nothing how i'm where you\nwere at\nyou know it's taken me five years of\ndoing\nmy meditation my stretching my eating\nright my sleeping right\nand you have to be on a constant\nreminder\nalmost like how you put a reminder on\nyour phone 15 minutes you got this\nit has to be in your brain you've done\ntoo much\nstop and what happens in life is that we\nstart to see our lives becoming so\nsuccessful\nwe're making money we're doing this\nwe're doing that\ni want more i want more i push harder\ni'm all about pushing hard don't get me\nwrong obviously i'm\nall about it but to push as hard as you\ncan\nyou have to be mindful of the machine\nthat's pushing\nit is going to end up dying and then it\ntakes years to get it back so you lose\nthat time\nthat time is gone you know i lost five\nyears\nof i could be crushing it where now i'm\njust now back to crushing it realizing\ngod man\ni learned the hard way that's really\nsometimes one way to learn\nyeah sometimes yeah sometimes one way to\nlearn that's how i've learned the best\nyeah how do you know those indicators so\nwhat are those indicators to know\ni'm pushing too hard or i'm i'm\nsuffering too much because it's hard to\nknow\nright everyone gets in the gym even once\na week or whatever and it's like\nif you don't go off then you can feel\nlike you're falling apart after 10\nminutes\ndo me a favor go to the first go to the\nfirst\npage of the of not no no go to like the\nfirst three pages of that book you see\none\none sentence okay to the unrelenting\nvoice in my head\nthat will never allow me to stop okay\nthe unrelenting voice that we all have\nwhat happens to that voice i'm going to\nanswer your question we all have a voice\nin our head\nsome of us are very spiritual some of us\nare not but we all have this voice and\nyou're doing [ __ ] up [ __ ] this is\nwrong don't do that\nthe more you don't listen to that voice\nthe further that voice gets away from\nyour head some people call it the holy\nspirit some people call it gossip\nmonks whatever whatever you call it it's\nthere we all have it\nit's the right or wrong voice but the\nmore we don't listen to it the more that\nvoice goes\naway the only voice you hear is yourself\nwith all it when the only voice hears\nyourself you're wrong\nthere's a voice that guides you through\nlife but sometimes this guy in your\ndirection that you don't want to go\nthat's usually the right place to go\nit's that uncomfortable place\nso that voice is always talking to me\nbut we don't listen to it\ni listen to it and when i start getting\nanxious nervous like i've done\nwe all know we've done too much because\nit's telling us i'm getting tired i'm\nwearing down\nbut we we go we go we go i started\ntalking to my fiance hey\ni'm doing too much you start now like\nlike i did in hell week like i do all\nthe time the one second decision\nit's that decision when your mind starts\nto get so amped up whenever you can't\nhear yourself think\nyou gotta slow down whenever you're\nliving off a schedule every day is a\nschedule every day's a schedule you have\nno time for yourself\nwhen you start and we all know it i\ndon't have time for this anymore i have\ntime for that anymore\nthat's when your mind and your body are\nsaying think about that\ni'm neglecting my fiance i'm neglecting\nmy disciplines of life\ni'm neglecting my reading my learning my\nmy workouts my\nmy my diet you start neglecting all of\nthat\nyou neglect one of them you can you can\nneglect all of them\na long time it's going to haunt you\nwhen you start seeing that my god i\nhaven't eaten right in a long time\ni haven't been sleeping a long time it's\ngoing to be one of those things to take\nyou off\nso i'm i'm very aware of\nmy eating my sleeping my my my\ndisciplines\nof life and i started to get too far\naway from them\nit's a hard stop because what made me me\nare the self not just disciplines the\nself\ndisciplines of life and those are\nalways in front of you if you have any\nthey're always in front of you\nso that's so that's my hard stop yeah i\nlove that man that's great advice and\ni guess a simple example is is of like\nsleep like when you wake up in the\nmorning\nthat's right there's a party that's\ngoing i just go back to sleep exactly\nright\nwhen we used to wake up at 4am as monks\nsometimes three\nit's like there's the part and then\nthat's what you're saying and then all\nyou hear is\nyourself saying ah it's all right just\ngo sleep it's okay that's right but then\nthat voice has got quieter that says no\nyou need to get up that's right you need\nto get up\nand you've just pushed away just pushed\nit away that's the\ndiscomfort that you need to that's right\nembrace exactly\nso those voices are very important they\nthey can guide you let's think about\nlike i said\nthe mind's the most powerful weapon in\nthe world yeah\nit can guide you to being very\ncomfortable also yeah so you give you\nyou got to be careful the\nthe mind will trick you yeah and they're\nsaying this sleep in the day you deserve\nit yeah\nsometimes you don't deserve it so\nthere's that there's that fine line\nof of the mind getting the tactical\nadvantage over you to really like\ni've worked too hard yeah you really\nhaven't worked hard enough\nso yeah absolutely yeah in in when we\nwere trained as monks in the vedic\nphilosophy\nhe talks about the difference between\nthe mind and the intelligence the mind\nis compared to a child\nand the intelligence is compared to a\nparent and so when the child goes\nloose when the mind goes loose when it's\nnot trained\ncontrolled disciplined self-disciplined\netc\nit can have tantrums you can throw\nthings out the pram right it demands\nmore\nlike a child always wants to sleep in\nright all right always\neven if the child knows that it's better\nto wake up to go to school\nright a child doesn't want to a child\ndoesn't want to study for exams\nright because it's hard it's painful and\nthe adult role it's the intelligence\nwhich is often we forget that it exists\nthe intelligence is that voice coaching\nthe mind that's right\nbut what often happens is the\nintelligence just tries to shout at the\nmind like a bad parent\nexactly the parent just shouts that's a\nhundred percent no teaching no education\nno no knowledge just shout that is a 100\nthe way you explain that about the\nchild's mind\nis 100 the truth i just want to sleep in\nalways throwing tantrums never getting\nwhat they want\nwhenever they don't get what they want\nthey throw attention but what happens is\nwe never grow\nwe we are 40 50 60\nstill throwing that tantrum we once did\nat seven and eight years old so people\nthink with age is growth\nno it's not you have to go back into the\nscarring to get the growth\nabsolutely because if if with age you\njust repeated what you did when you were\nyounger exactly\nstronger that's it right you've just\nstrengthened a bad muscle i'm throwing a\nbigger tantrum\nat 43. yeah that did it eight yeah so\ntrue\nyeah you just strengthen a bad muscle\nstronger stronger stronger stronger\nand then that can break you if you want\neven more videos just like this one make\nsure you subscribe\nand click on the boxes over here i'm\nalso excited to let you know that you\ncan now\nget my book think like a monk from think\nlike a monkbook.com\ncheck below in the description to make\nsure you order today"
