    "transcript": "when things are difficult actually\nthings are difficult and i don't need to\njudge myself for that because\nthis is a moment that many of us are\nfinding difficult and so\ni think courage in its most quiet and\nmost powerful\nis expressed in the conversation that we\nhave with ourselves if\nif we are not able to see ourselves\nhow do we create change in the world\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you who come back\nevery week to listen learn and grow now\ni'm really\nproud of the incredible community that\nwe've been able to build together\nand i'm really excited to introduce you\nto today's guest\nbecause i think this is something we've\nall been struggling with for the past\nyear\nand i've been really trying to find the\nright person to have a conversation with\nabout\n2020 about the new normal about\nour emotional well-being and i think\nthis is the one i think this is it\nso i'm really really excited to\nintroduce you to none other than susan\ndavid\nwho's a harvard medical school\npsychologist and best-selling author\nher most recent book emotional agility\ndescribes the psychological skills\ncritical to thriving in times of\ncomplexity\nand change you may know susan from her\nfamous ted talk on the topic of\nemotional agility\nand if you haven't seen it i highly\nrecommend it and as it went viral with\nover 1 million views in its first week\nof release\nsusan is the ceo of evidence-based\npsychology\na co-founder of the institute of\ncoaching and on the scientific advisory\nboard\nof thrive global and virgin pulse please\nwelcome to on purpose\nsusan david susan thank you for being\nhere thank you i am delighted to be with\nyou today\ni'm so excited for this and and i really\nmeant what i\nsaid i think what's been happening over\nthe past year\nand as we were just connecting a few\nmoments ago\nyou were talking about you know the\nstart of the year\ni've really been trying to find the\nright person to have this conversation\nwith because\ni think there's a lot of aspects of your\nwork\nthat are even though you wrote this book\nfive years ago so much of it is so\nintegral\nto what we're experiencing today so i'm\ni'm really fascinated but i wanted to\nstart with\na quote you shared on twitter the other\nday and i'm going to read it out because\ni don't want to mess it up\nbut you recently posted something on\ntwitter and it flawed me and it says\ncourage at its most powerful\nis rarely loud mostly it's a whisper\nthose moments every day when you do\nwhat matters tell me\nmore about this idea of courage being a\nwhisper\nso firstly yes i mean my work\nthat i started so many years ago is\nreally\nfinding i think it's a moment in\na world that feels like very often it's\ndelivering gut punch after gut punch to\nus\nso jay let me start in\na story and then you'll see what i mean\nby courage\nis a whisper i think often we think\nabout courage as being very\nloud it's very active and it's very out\nthere\nwhen i was around five years old\ni became petrified by the idea of death\nand this might sound like an unusual\nfear for a five-year-old but in fact\nat around that age children become aware\nof their own mortality and the fact that\ntheir parents\nwon't be around forever and\ni recall going into\nmy father's bed i would lie between my\nmother and my father and i would say to\nmy father\ndaddy promise me you'll never die\npromise me you'll never die\nand my father would comfort me and he\nwould comfort me with soft pets and with\nkisses but he never lied\nand he said to me susie we all die\nit's normal to be scared and\nwhat he was inviting me into in that\nmoment was a whisper of\ncourage you know a whisper of courage\nfor him as a parent\nwhere our impetus or our impulse\nis always to fake positivity or make\nthings right\nor to do away or to story tell our way\nout of something\nit would have been so easy for him to\nsay you know don't worry everything's\ngonna be fine\num but his his message to me was this\nidea that courage\nis is a whisper and courage is not about\nnot being fearful but rather about\nwalking in the direction of your fears\nstep by step so\nwhat do i mean by a whisper when we have\nan\nargument with our spouse and we love\nthat person\nit takes courage to reach out for a hug\nrather than pull in and develop a wall\nof disconnect it takes courage\nsometimes to speak up but sometimes it\nactually takes courage\nto slow down and to not speak and to\nlisten\nand so the idea with courage is again\nthat it's often\nseen as being something that's only\navailable to heroes\nand yet i think that life every single\nday\ninvites all of us into choice points\nthe choice point might be you know do i\nreach for the\nmuffin or do i reach for the fruit the\nchoice point might be do i speak up or\ndo i slow down\nthe choice point might be do i\nhave a difficult conversation or do i\nnot and\nthese are the pieces of courage that i\nthink get expressed in a whisper\nand why i think it's so important is\nbecause\nthere is a groundswell of whisper that\nmakes\nchange and it also speaks to\nwhat we know about uh human\ncapability and that is that human\ncapability is not\noften this idea that i'm upset and i'm\nfrazzled and they're finally to go sell\nup and go live on a wine farm in france\nso often the change that we bring about\nin our own lives is through\nthese incremental moments of values\naligned\nchoices this whisper that can often be\nfearful\nbecause it often says you know when we\nexperience our emotions it's often this\nidea of like you shouldn't speak up you\nshouldn't do those things\nbut when we move into that\ncourage we actually ground ourselves\nin enormous change what a beautiful\nanswer i love that story you told and\ni'm going to come back to that later i'm\ni'm\nwithholding my temptation to dive into a\nsubject that i want to share\ni want to say for later so anyone who's\nlistening if if you see me going that\nway\nuh i'm i'm pulling myself back right now\nif you're listening\nto to asking a question that i think is\ngoing to help us build to that\nwhen we speak about courage susan tell\nme about the last time\nyou or the most recent time\nthat you felt you did something\ncourageous but it may not have looked\nthat way to anyone else\nbecause i think sometimes we think of\ncourage as being\nperceivable right and and that's what\nyou're saying when you're talking about\ncourage being a whisper and you're\ntalking about big\nchange actually coming from a\ngroundswell of whispers\nwhen recently did you act on courage but\nactually no one really would have sensed\nit that way apart from you\nwell i think one of the most profound\nways that we can be courageous\nis what i describe in emotional agility\nand that is\ncourage with our own difficult emotions\num and certainly i\nam in boston and we are nearing\nthe first year anniversary so a one-year\nanniversary of basically being\ni don't want to say house bound but\ncertainly in the last year i've not been\nto\na restaurant a coffee shop or anything\nelse um\ni'm married to a physician who's very\nmuch in the\ncontext of this experience that we are\nall having\nand so the courage on a day-to-day basis\nis the courage\nfor myself of uh compassion\nbecause i'm home and remote schooling\ntwo children\nand that courage it's it's a whisper but\nit's the courage of\nbeing able to feel my feelings it's the\ncourage of being able to recognize that\nwhen things are difficult actually\nthings are difficult and i don't need to\njudge myself for that because\nthis is a moment that many of us are\nfinding difficult and so\ni think courage in its most quiet and\nmost powerful\nis expressed in the conversation that we\nhave with ourselves if\nif we are not able to see ourselves\nhow do we create change in the world how\ndo we see other people\nhow do we relate to our partners\nin an effective way if we are not able\nto see ourselves and so being able to\nsee ourselves\nour difficult thoughts emotions and\nstories i think is\none of the the most elemental building\nblocks of courage\ni couldn't agree with you more and and i\nthink we're hearing about this more and\nmore now the idea of\nlooking into your fears sitting with\na difficult emotion trying to understand\nthose feelings but\npractically what do we actually do with\nit\nbecause i find that we see two extremes\nwe see some people say jay i think about\nmy feelings so much that i end up\nfeeling\noverwhelmed and overthinking and\nprocrastinating\nor maybe pushing myself into feeling\ncompletely burdened by my feelings\nand then you hear the opposite where\nit's like jay i don't even know what my\nfeelings\nare right i i don't even let myself feel\nthat because i'm so scared and that's\nthe courage part that you're mentioning\nbut when you actually look at your\nfeelings when you sit with a difficult\nemotion\nwhat do you do with it what does that\npractically look like\nso jay what you allude to is exactly you\nknow\nprofoundly uh important\ni wonder if i can share a story and i\nhope it's not the one that you were\ngoing to draw me on\na little bit later no please you know i\ngave the example\nearlier of my father and these\nconversations with my father\nso i'm five at that time fast forward\nuh ten years my mother\ncalls me and she says to me go and say\ngoodbye\nto dad because now my father's 42 years\nold\nand unbeknownst to us when i was five\nten years later when i was now 15\nhe was gonna be diagnosed with cancer\nand so\nmy mother is calling me to go and say\ngoodbye to him\nand i'm this little girl now walking\nwith courage\nto say goodbye to my parent and\nwhat's kind of remarkable in that\nexperience\nis afterwards i had\nwhat so many of us have which is\nthis idea that like what do i do with my\ndifficult emotions my father has\ndied we live in a world that seems to\nconspire against\nour feelings even though there's a lot\nof like feel your feelings\nstill the meta message of our emotions\nis that we've got to be positive\nthat we've got to be happy and so i'm\nthis 15 year old and i become the master\nof being okay i'm not dropping a single\ngrade i'm getting on with life\nand i have this teacher who recognizes\nmy pain\nand who says to me as she hands out\nblank notebooks to the class\nshe says write tell the truth\nand write like no one is reading and so\nwhat do you have there you have this\ninvitation to come into the self\nand what this does is it sparks off then\nmy career as a psychologist as a\nresearcher into the world of emotions\nand so what you describe which is often\nwhen people are dealing with difficult\nemotions\nthey tend to do one of two things the\nthe first is to\nbottle emotions bottling is where you\npush them aside\nyou disconnect it from them you're often\ndoing it with very good intentions\nyou're saying things like i've just got\nto get on with my goals and my job and\nmy\nmy life you know so i don't have time to\nfeel these feelings\nand so it's almost like you've got this\nthis uh stack of books\nand you're walking but you've got the\nbooks like really held very tensely away\nfrom you\nand what we know psychologically is you\nwill drop the books\nit might take you a little while to drop\nthem but you will drop the books\nand dropping the books when you've been\nbottling your emotions\neither looks like you know you you\nsay something that you didn't intend to\nsay over the thanksgiving table\nor to your colleague at a meeting um\ndropping the books can often look like\njust\nwhen life hits you not have\nthe capacity to cope because you haven't\nbeen practicing difficult emotions\nand dropping the books can um often\nplay out in what we see in high levels\nof depression\nlower levels of well-being high levels\nof anxiety\nand obviously the many factors that play\ninto these but that's what\nbottling looks like but on the other\nhand\nwhat we can do is we can become so\nimmersed by how i feel\nwe become victimized by our twitter feed\nor what someone else said and whether\nthe relationship is\ntoxic or not toxic and it's this like\noverwhelm\nof emotions and it's almost like taking\nbooks and holding them\nso closely to yourself that you are\nunable to\nhug your child you are unable to\nlive in your life because you are so\nclosed into yourself and so what does\nemotional health look like when it comes\nto emotions\num it is fundamentally\nabout the courage of\ngentle acceptance you know gentle\nacceptance in the same way as if you\nwent outside and it was\nraining a lack of gentle acceptance\nwould be like why is it raining i wish\nit wouldn't rain when i\nyou know want to go and have fun why\ndoes it always rain when i want to do\nthat's not gentle acceptance gentle\nacceptance is\ngee it's raining you know that's what\ngentle acceptance is\nso the first component of emotional\nhealth of that\nmiddle ground where it's not bottling\nwhere it's not\nbrooding but it's actually being healthy\nand whole as a human being is gentle\nacceptance\nof our own and other people's emotions\nbut there are also core\ncomponents of skill that become\nnecessary here\nso i know one thing that you've spoken a\nbit about and certainly something that i\nfound in my own research\nis that often when people are struggling\nthey'll use labels to describe what it\nis that they're feeling but they're\noften these\nbig umbrella labels uh\ni'm stressed is the most common one you\nknow everything is i'm stressed i'm\nstressed\nbut but there's a world of difference\nbetween stress\nand disappointment or stress and feeling\nunsupported\nstress and stress and that\nknowing knowing feeling of i'm in the\nwrong job or the wrong career or\nthis relationship isn't working out so\nwhen we\nlabel everything as stress as an example\nand i've got other very practical\nstrategies that i can\nshare but when we label everything as\nstress\nphysiologically we don't actually know\nhow to\nmanage that so if we just take that one\nexample\nof stress and we say what are two other\nemotions that i'm actually experiencing\ni'm depleted oh i need to\ntake some time for self-care whether\nthat's a walk or a piece of\nmusic oh the thing that i'm calling\nstress\nis actually i'm worried about a\ndifficult conversation\nand i'm avoiding it okay\nand this thing that i'm calling stress\nis actually exactly about the\nconversation\nwhen we label our emotions more\naccurately literally what it does\nphysiologically is it enables what is\ncalled the readiness potential\nin our brains and it's the it's the\naction readiness that allows us to start\nsaying\nwhat is the cause of that emotion and\nwhat do i need to now\ndo in response to it so literally the\naction\nof moving out of bottling moving out of\nbrooding but moving into\ngentle acceptance but then also\nrecognizing that we own\nour emotions they don't own us\nand so how do we own our emotions we own\nour emotions by accurately labeling as\none example\nwhat this allows us to do is to breathe\ninto the space\nof what it is that we do next and i can\ngive some other practical examples of\nhow this\ncan be helpful or strategies that people\ncan use but i just know please please\nlet's hear them i think i think i'm so\nglad that you introduced the idea of\nlabeling emotions i\ni'm so happy that you went there because\nyou're spot on that we\nuse these umbrella terms that even we\ndon't know how to define\nand not only do we not understand them\nwe\nchallenge our partners because we think\nthey don't understand us either and so\nwe\nare trying to get them to vocalize and\nverbalize\nand articulate what we're feeling to us\nand we feel no that's that's not how i\nfeel right now and it's like because\nyou don't know how you feel so it\ncreates a lot of issues but yes please\ngive us some of those\npractical steps in the direction well\nthere's all the practical steps actually\nyou you kind of evoke an idea or a\nmemory of mine which is i remember a\ncouple of years ago\nworking with a client and this\nparticular client wouldn't label\neverything as stress\nhe would label things as angry he was\nvery quick to anger and every time you\nsaid\nwhat's going on for you he would say i'm\njust angry like i'm\nangry how's your team doing my team's\nangry\nyou know my team's angry\nit was it was this fascinating\nconversation and i started to just do\nthis this very quick thing with him\nwhich is\nsaying to him what are two other options\nwhat are two other emotion options\nand he started to say he was in a new\nrole\nand he started to say maybe i'm not\nangry\nmaybe i'm scared you know maybe i'm\nscared\nand maybe the team's not angry maybe the\nteam is actually\ndistrustful because they've had a really\nbad experience with a previous leader\nand maybe they're trying to build trust\nnow you can see\nif you go into a conversation with\nsomeone of i'm angry and they angry\nwell what's the next step the next step\nis that we all get locked into\nright versus wrong but if you going into\nthe conversation with\ni see that my ego wants to do well\nbut actually i want to connect with my\nvalues here which is\nthat i want to care for this team and i\nwant to see them as trust\nand that the teams coming up from a\ndifferent place that's a completely\ndifferent conversation\nand so jay a couple of months after\nhaving this conversation and working\nwith\nmy client on this he and i um\nit was a consulting client and i became\nfriendly with his wife as well we went\nout to dinner and\nshe said to me this simple skill\nactually completely changed the tenor of\ntheir relationship\nwow he would come home from work and he\nwould say to her\noh you you seem angry and she would be\nuh i'm not angry i'm just tired you know\ni'm just tired or i'm not angry i just\nneed some support\nyeah and so this is it seems so subtle\nbut to not i don't want to make too big\na thing of this but we actually know\nthat\nchildren as young as two and three years\nold\nwho are encouraged to label their\nemotions more accurately\nactually over time have not only\ngreater levels of psychological\nwell-being but you can actually see\nthat you are more able to regulate\nyourself\nand to develop perseverance\nif you have a greater level of accuracy\naround your emotions\na child who's now 16 years old\nwhere someone says oh i've got a great\nidea let's let the air out of the\nprincipal's\ncar tires the child who's able to say\nthis thing that i'm feeling that\nthat feels really exciting\nbut actually beneath the excitement\ni've got a sense of disquiet about this\nand the child who's\nable to elevate that disquiet\nis the child who's able to resist peer\npressure\nwho's able to have the cornerstone of\nsaying you know i want to go to the\nparty but i actually also want to study\nand how can i bring myself to that\nlatter option\nso it is a profoundly important skill\nso anyway i promised other practical\nstrategies\nbut i wanted to detour into that example\nif that's helpful\noh that's that that example is\nabsolutely brilliant and and i think\nit's great because you're spot on that\neven when we see other people we\nproject our idea of what their behavior\nsuggests\nso like you said like your client who\nwould go home and say oh you look angry\nthat's him projecting what he thinks\nanger looks like\nand and i've done that for so long i\nwent as soon as you said that i was\nthinking oh yeah like\nwhen i see someone really uncomfortable\ni get really uncomfortable around them\neven though it has nothing to do with me\nbut maybe they're not uncomfortable\nmaybe they're just feeling another\nemotion that i'm not actually aware of\nand i haven't checked that so i think\nthat's that's that's brilliant and i\ndidn't even know about the\nto hear about that in children's\npsychology i'd never heard that before\nand so\nthat level of emotional agility\nin a young person to be able to decipher\nbetween two choices\nwhether that be trouble or whether that\nbe\nuh study i think that's really really\ninteresting i didn't know about that\nstudy at all so that's\nthat's really i loved it i'm so glad you\nwent there so\nso yeah i mean it's such an important\nskill\nso some other practical strategies or\nsome other ways that we can kind of\nthink about emotional agility because\nif you said to me or if you say you know\nwell what is emotional identity let's\nlet's ground this emotional agility is\nbasically about our ability to be\nhealthy\nhuman beings okay to be healthy with\nourselves\nthe idea that every single day we have\nthousands of thoughts\nyou know thought might be i'm not good\nenough for um\nbeing undermined an emotion might be an\nemotion of\num sadness or grief or loneliness\nwe have stories some of these stories\nwere written on our mental chalkboards\nwhen we were five years old stories\nabout what emotion is\ngood or bad what emotions are loud\nversus not allowed and\nthat can lead us to be comfortable or\nuncomfortable\nwith emotions even in our adult life and\nand\nfeel like we've either got the skill\nwith them or we don't um\nbut we also have other stories we've got\nstories about whether we're creative\nwhat kind of love we deserve whether\nwe're leaders\nyou know again some of these stories are\nwritten on our mental chalkboards\nwhen we were just little when we were\nlittle\nand a very important aspect of emotional\nagility\nis that these thoughts emotions and\nstories are normal\na very important part of emotional\nagility is\nnot this idea that there's good emotions\nand bad emotions and we should\nonly feel the good emotions or that\nthere's good thoughts that we allowed\nand\nwe're not allowed bad thoughts a very\nimportant part of emotional agility is\nthe recognition\nthat when you have difficult thoughts\nemotions and stories\nthis is literally your evolutionary\nhistory\ndoing its job which is to try to protect\nyou\nso there is nothing inherently good or\nbad about\nany of this so what is it that makes\nus in agile or ineffective\nor unhealthy in the world the litmus\nis this idea that when we get\nstuck in our thoughts our emotions and\nour stories where we\neither stuck in the avoidance of it or\nstuck in\nfeeling that it's a directive and that\nit's telling us what to do you know i'm\nfeeling undermined\nso i'm going to leave the room or i'm\nfeeling shut down in this meeting so now\ni'm going to stop contributing\nwhen we do this we are letting our\nthoughts emotions and our stories\ndrive us rather than\nus driving them okay rather than\nus owning them so\nwhat is you know what are other parts of\nemotional agility that are critical\ni've already spoken about showing up to\ndifficult emotions\nwith acceptance and i would add in there\nvery importantly with compassion you\nknow that\nit takes and is necessary for us to be\ncompassionate towards ourselves as human\nbeings but then we also want to be able\nto\nstep out of our difficult emotions and\nso the example that i've given is\nemotion granularity\nbut i'll give you another example which\nis um\nwhen we feel and this will probably\nconnect with you in terms of your\nbackground and your experiences\nbut often what we do is we use language\nto describe our emotions that is\na linguistic trap so we'll say things\nlike\ni am angry i am sad i am being\nundermined\nand you can hear that when you do this i\nam sad\nall of me 100 of me is sad\nthere's no space for anything else\nthere's no space for intention for\nvalues for breathing\nfor our wisdom we've all got wisdom\ninside\nof us that when there's all this noise\ngoing on about what we're allowed to\nfeel and not feel and whether we\nhustling with our emotions we are unable\nvery often to connect with our wisdom\nso when we say i am sad\nyou are defining yourself by the emotion\nbut you are not the emotion you\nare a human being who is more than your\nemotions\nor stories or thoughts\nand those are part of you but they're\nnot definitional of you\nand so a beautiful metaphor of this is\nit's almost like when people say things\nlike\ni am sad it's almost like the sad is the\ncloud\nand they are the cloud you know you have\nbecome the cloud\nbut you are not the cloud you are the\nsky\nyou know you are the sky you are\ncapacious\nand able to have all of your clouds\nand to still be the sky so how do you\ndevelop this\nmeta view this ability to observe your\nemotions\none strategy that's very\npractical and you can use even in a\ndifficult meeting or a difficult\nconversation\nis to simply notice your thoughts\nyour emotions or your stories for what\nthey are\nthey are thoughts their emotions they\nare stories they are not\nfact so what does this look like i am\nsad\ni'm noticing that i'm feeling sad\ni'm being undermined i'm noticing the\nthought\nthat i'm being undermined it sounds very\nsubtle but what you are starting to do\nis you are starting to create\nlinguistic space between you and the\nemotion\nyeah in that linguistic space\nyou are then allowed and enabling\nyourself to bring other parts of\nyourself forward um and one of the core\nparts that we want to bring forward\nis our values that's a very important\npart of\nemotional agility excellent i hope\neveryone who's listening and watching\nright now is taking notes because\nthose no i mean it because that is such\na simple\nsubtle but yet so practical and such a\npowerful tool\nand i recommend that everyone writes\nthis down draw draw a line down the\nmiddle of the page\nand write down what you say you are on\nthe left hand side so you may say right\nnow i am\nsad or i'm unhappy or whatever it is\nand then on the right hand side i want\nyou to perform the activity that susan\njust said to us and write down\nhow you're now going to rewire your\nlinguistic understanding of that because\nwhen you get this out of your head and\nonto a page and\nwrite it down and scribble it down you\nstart seeing how\ndistant it is from you rather than it\nbeing yourself so\nplease use this as a moment uh take a\nscreenshot of where you are right now if\nyou need to come back to this later\ncome back to this time and do that\nactivity with\nany of the emotions you've been feeling\nthis week or in the last 12 months now\nin your fashion season i'm gonna take a\nbit of a a random detour\nback to where i want to go and and this\ndetour is i was\nwe've always already started talking\nabout your book emotional agility it's\nright here\ni wanted to ask you this question just\nnot because i don't judge\nbooks by their cover but i'm fascinated\nby choice\nand imagery yes yes i want to ask\nwhat is this fish sugar cookie\nso as you know firstly having published\nyour own book uh we often don't have a\nlot of\nlatitude in the very final say of what\ngoes on\nthe cover definitely that said a core\nmetaphor of if we think about what is\nemotional agility emotional\nagility is about being able to be with\nourselves with\num compassion with curiosity\nand we'll get that you know what is what\nis this emotion telling me\nyeah um and with courage which is a core\npart of my work\nso that we can experience difficult\nthoughts and emotions and stories that\nare part of\na complex changing world\na world that is both beautiful and\nfragile\na world in which we aren't happy all the\ntime and that is the reality\nof our experience and so emotional\nagility is about being able to\nbreathe into that space with a set of\nskills that allows us to be open-hearted\nand um and\nintentional and calm and wise\nin how we move through life and then if\nwe think about the\nopposite of emotional agility which is\nemotional\nrigidity and emotional rigidity\nis when we treat our thoughts our\nemotions and our stories as\nfact emotional rigidity\nis when we get so autopilot in the way\nwe go through\nour lives that we aren't living\nintentionally we we get so sucked into\nour social media or our netflix or\nwhatever it is we're doing\nthat we we on autopilot and autopilot\ncan even be\nin a relationship you know we can\nautopilot where\nwe're in the same house with the same\nperson 24 7\nand yet our autopilot has led us to put\nup\ndefenses and you can actually see the\nwall going up and feel the wall going up\nand you with this person but you\nactually recognize that you lonely\nyou know that is autopilot and so\nwhat is the fish the fish is an example\nof how we get hooked\nhow we get hooked into this rigid way of\nbeing um\nit might be we get hooked in bad habits\nthrough this autopilot i've been\nspeaking about\nit might be we get hooked by our\nthoughts emotions our stories\num we get get hooked often\nbecause we in our lives\nhave very often learned ways\nto adapt you know we've learned that\nmaybe when we were angry as a child\nwe were punished and now\nwe struggle to be authentic with our\nteams or with our spouse\nand so we've got this way of being that\nactually might have been really\nfunctional for us as our child\nwhen we were that child but that we've\nnow grown out of it\nso the imagery of the fish is really\nto denote that often we get hooked\nand emotional agility is the process of\ngetting off the hook that is probably\nthe most profound\ndescription of a book cover i'll\nprobably ever hear in my life i love it\nit's so\ndetailed way too deep oh it's great it's\nso deep and rich i love it that's that's\nwhat i wanted to hear\nand and and it's so hard i i\nunfortunately had to have my face on my\ncover so i couldn't do anything else and\nso\nto have to have that beautiful deep\nsubstance-filled\ndecision sounds like a great answer i i\nthere are two big things i wanted to\nspeak to you about\nas this conversation's evolved and we've\nreally set the tone and the foundation\nof\nwhat emotional agility is where courage\nfits into our life how do we face our\nemotions\nand the first one comes from something\nthat when i look in hindsight now and i\ndon't even think i put this in my book\nbut you've made me think of it\ni don't think i spoke about it as\nexplicitly as this\nbut when i lived as a monk something\nreally\nfascinating happened in how we lived our\nlife so\nwe never slept in the same place\nevery night in the sense that even if we\nslept in the same room\nthere was no place that was yours so you\ndidn't even have the consistency\nof the space on the floor that you slept\nin so that's\none thing uh when we got on a train\nto travel to another destination we\ndidn't know what our accommodation\nlooked like yeah and so if you think\nabout now when you plan a\nholiday or a vacation you always know\nwhat your apartment's going to look like\nor your\nhotel or your airbnb you pick it out\nmonths in advance\nwe didn't know what it would look like\nsometimes it was\nopen hall sometimes it was a corridor\nand sometimes it was the train itself\nand sometimes it was once it was an\nunfinished\naccommodation building where i nearly\nstepped into an elevator that didn't\nexist\nand so what i'm what i'm trying to get\nat here\nis the way monk life is set up\nit it made me so okay with change\nand constant change and constant\nsurprise and uncertainty\nbecause we never had any of that we just\nand you never even knew what your next\nmeal was\nyeah when food was always given to you\nyou never chose off a menu\nand so when i look at your title of your\nbook and i look at what's happening in\nthe world right now when you talk about\nembracing change\nthe the common rhetoric right now is i\nwish things would go\nback to being the same or\ni guess this is our new normal or when\nwill this\nend and it's funny because when you ask\nthe question when will this\nend that's a sign that you want change\nbut then we're also at the same time\nasking the question like oh i wish\nthings would go back to being the same\nand so where does emotional agility why\nis it that we're so\naddicted to sameness\nand where does emotional agility and\nstability come in like what is stability\nis stability even real\nuh and so yeah i hope that's not too\nmany questions\nthat's that's really beautiful so\nfirstly\num we know that\ncognitively human beings are\ndrawn to what is\neasy what is coherent\nand what is familiar so what is easy we\nwill\nalways default as human beings to what\njust feels\neasy uh we will always default to what\nfeels coherent you know they've been\nvery interesting studies showing that\nwhen uh people in organizations are\nsometimes individuals with a very low\nself-concept\nand then they get promoted those\nindividuals will often\ncompletely counter-intuitively leave the\norganization\nand part of what's been explored is\nthere there can be a disconnect between\nthe story they have of themselves which\nfeels so coherent\nversus this countervailing feedback that\nthey're getting from the organization\nthat actually makes them feel\nuncomfortable\nso human beings are drawn to what's easy\nto what's coherent the story that we\ntell ourselves\nand to what is familiar and again this\nis\nreally important because it is necessary\nwhen i wake up in the morning for me to\ngo\noh you know this little child that is\njumping on my head\nis my seven-year-old daughter sophie and\ni need to pay attention to sophie and i\nneed to\nyou know not pay attention to the\nwashing machine in the background okay\nso coherence is what allows us to make\nsense\nof all the different pieces of\ninformation that\ncome at us every day so that we weave\nthem into a story\nand again this is from an evolutionary\nperspective really really important that\nwe are\nable to do as human beings we\nwe are drawn to this now\nthe downside of this is that it can lead\nto this\nautopilot closing down\nfrom discomfort um the curse of comfort\nthe positive aspect of\nis the positive aspect of these ideas is\nand i explore this in emotional agility\nis if you've got\nsomething that feels really values\naligned to you\nyou can then use this idea of ease to\nbuild\na habit that is values aligned so an\nexample might be\nthat i um feel really stressed\nat the end of the day when i'm done with\nyou know if i work in a corporate\nenvironment when i've i'm done with my\nmeeting after meeting\nand now i'm trying to generate a sense\nof um\nof work life uh integration but in a way\nthat feels a bit healthier and more\nbalanced to me\nand i've been finding that i've been\nbringing my cell phone to the table\nand not spending time with my family and\nthat that\nwork life and home life have completely\nmeshed\nand so what i do is i know that\ni always you know put\nmy computer in a particular place\nas i finish up the workday and now what\ni do\nis i do what what is called piggybacking\nwhich is i'm now adding my cell phone\nto the same place so that i'm not\nbringing my cell phone\nto the dinner table and so what we're\ndoing is we're starting to\nshape our environment so that it's not\neasy\nto do the things that are intentional\nand values connected\nthat we really want to be doing another\nexample of this that we see very often\nis the way we\nwe create the choice architecture in our\nhouse\nwhere we might put fruit on the table\ninstead of something that feels a little\nbit\nless healthy so that it's easier for us\nto go to the fruit\nso as human beings we are drawn to these\nthings\nhere's the difficulty\nwhen we sidestep tough emotions and\ntough emotions that\ncome with the reality of life\nwhen we sidestep those tough emotions\nwhen we sidestep\ntough experiences and discomfort we\nare not able to develop the skills\nthat help us to adapt and change\nbecause j in truth laughs beauty\nand its fragility are interwoven\nwe are young and then we are not we\nare healthy and then a diagnosis\nbrings us to our knees and\nso life's beauty and its fragility are\ninterwoven\nthey are they are inseparable\nand when we sidestep tough emotions\nwhen we when we listen to\nthe mantras of positive vibes only\nor just be positive and so we think when\nwe feel difficult emotions that we\nshouldn't be feeling them that they're\nbad and so we\nside step them what we are actually\ndoing\nis we are failing to develop skills\nto live in the world as it is\nnot as we wish it to be but as it is\nand so discomfort circling back to our\nconversation earlier about courage\ndiscomfort is extraordinarily important\nwe can we can think about this at an\nindividual level you know\nif i keep taking these small\nwhispers if i t keep taking these small\nsteps of courage\nwe build our own courage but i actually\nthink that\nat a at a broader level\nthe the culture that we are in the\nworld that we are in is begging\nus for courage the world is\nbegging us to be able to have difficult\nconversations\nnot to just say oh well that person's\nsaying something that i don't like\ntherefore they're toxic therefore i'm\ngoing to cut them out of my life\nif we can't have these difficult\nconversations what we do\nis we shrink ourselves we shrink we\nshrink\nand we are actually more fragile\nrather than more agile that was\nbrilliant\nthat that was amazing that that specific\npoint there was something you said there\nthat was\nwas so clear for me and and i understand\nit but i've never heard it\nbeing experienced and explained in that\nway is the idea that\nthose discomfort those uncomfortable\nemotions\nwhen we ignore them we're losing the\nability to develop\nskills that we need and so actually when\nyou're pushing away that\nopportunity to grow your skills and your\nlessons\nand the idea that we shrink like that\nword was so strong for me i was like wow\nyeah that's so true i'm\ni'm thinking about every time in my life\nwhere i've avoided a difficult\nconversation\nand actually it's so true like you just\nthink oh yeah i need to cut that out in\nmy life and move away from that and\nand actually you're so right that we're\nlosing that skill because life's going\nto keep\nbringing us that same situation and\nsimilar people and similar examples\nbecause that's just life yes and then\nwhat you've done is you've avoided and\nshrunk\nrather than rather than develop the\nskill and grown\nyes yeah and i'm fascinated by thinking\nabout what are some of those skills that\nwe've missed out on\nand i'm thinking about it for myself\nright now as you're saying that i'm\nreflecting on\na couple of decisions i've made and\nasking myself what is\nwhat what skill did i miss out on and i\nrealized that\ni i think it's very natural for us to\nshut down when we're not getting the\nresponse from someone that we want\nand and switch off and just say oh well\ni'll just move on and that is such a\nnatural thing to it feels natural\nbut what you're actually saying is that\nit may feel natural but it's actually\ncounterintuitive and useful to our\ndevelopment\nyes so a hallmark of psychological\nhealth and well-being\na hallmark is\nintegration rather than segmentation\nwhen we segment when we say\nthese people are toxic they're not\nallowed and these people are okay\nbut soon they might be toxic if they say\nsomething that i don't like\nyou know we are involved in segmentation\nwhen we say things like there's good\nemotions and bad emotions\nwe are involved in segmentation whereas\nwhereas life the truth of\nlife is one of\nfragility and beauty interwoven\nyes and that is integration and so if we\nthink about like\nwhat does integration mean integration\nmight mean that i\nfeel a difficult emotion i feel angry\nwith a spouse\nand i know that i love that person and\nso i can still\nreach out and and give the person a hug\nbut what's what's happening very often\nis\nwhen we push aside what's difficult we\nthen develop a story about\nwhy we've pushed that aside and it makes\nsense and that person's bad for me and\nand and we do it and we create the story\nbut we\nare shrinking like we are shrinking we\nshrinking ourselves we shrinking our\ncommunities\nwe are shrinking our capacity we are\nbecoming\nfragile when we do this now\nto be clear that's not to say that every\nrelationship\nis a relationship that is healthy\nand it's not to say that um\nyou know that that every person and\nevery\nevery way we are with a person requires\nus just to keep\ngoing and going and going but the\ndifference\nis that when you have a rule\nthat says something like oh that\nperson's\ntoxic or that person's evoking something\nin me and i don't like and therefore i'm\ni'm not going there what we are\ndoing is we're being driven by our\nemotions\nemotional agility what it's suggesting\nis that our emotions are\nbut they're not directives and i'd love\nto come back to this a little bit later\num they data not directives and so\nwhen we are cutting people off\nor not going there out of\nout of our emotion when we acting on\nthose emotions\nwe are reacting but\nwhen we are instead of acting out of our\nemotions\nstepping into our values\nthen we are responding and\nso you might if you're in the heat of\nthe moment\nsaying i don't want to have anything to\ndo with that person\nthat's reacting to your emotions that's\nemotional inagility\nemotional agility might be saying\nwhat are these difficult emotions\nsignposting\nokay my difficult emotions are data\nso uh grief\ngrief is often love looking for a home\nloneliness might be signposting that you\nvalue more intimacy and connection with\nyour spouse and you\nneed more of it um\ndisappointment might be signposting that\nyou feel unsupported\nand that you need more support\nstress might be signposting depletion\nand you need more self-care\nso what i'm suggesting in my work on\nemotional agility is not just that\nwe let difficult emotions live with\nour so-called positive emotions\nbut actually that difficult emotions\nare are signposts they are\nextraordinarily beautiful because they\nsignpost\nour values and if we just slow down and\nwe\nsay what is this emotion telling me\nabout what i\ncare about then\nwe are able to respond to step into\nthose emotions\nso to go back to this example an emotion\nthat says\noh this person you know is toxic and if\ni'm not going to go there\nwhat that's doing is it's allowing the\nemotions to call the shots\num when we say what is this disquiet\nthat i\nfeel it might be that the disquiet\nsignals that there's something deeply\nvalues misaligned in the relationship\nthat you have with the person\nwhere it just actually doesn't feel\nright\nor um the difficulty motion might be\nsignposting\nthat you need to have a difficult\nconversation and that actually it's not\nabout\ndoing away with the person it's actually\nabout the conversation and it's about\nso a very important part of this is\nthis idea that our emotions signpost the\nthings that we\ncare about and so jay to circle back\nyou might still be in a situation where\nyou say\ni choose not to continue investing\nin this relationship but there's a\ndifference\nwhen the choice is made as a react\nreaction out of your emotions versus a\nstepping into your values\nthe one is grounded\nand skills developing\nand agile and that's the stepping into\nyour values\nthe other which is the reactive part\nis life shrinking and fear-based\nand it's not wholehearted it's not it's\nnot healthy it's not\nwhole okay i've done that i need to i\nneed i need to go solve some issues i've\ndefinitely done that\nthat is that listening to you i'm like\noh gosh i\nyou know i i can totally see where where\ni've made that mistake and it's it's\nactually\nreally nice to be able to spot it and\nand hear it through some\nuh you know well articulated ideas where\ni'm\ni can i can see that as a mirror i can\nlaugh at myself for it which is\nwe all can i mean we all we all care you\nknow it's like we all\ndone that we've all done that yeah which\nis which is wonderful\ni want to dive into you've mentioned the\nword a few times\nand it's a big part of your work\nfragility\nand i want to start off by\nmy limited understanding but but also my\ncuriosity with fragility\nand i was saying this to my team earlier\nwhen we were having this conversation\nabout\nthis question and i was saying that i i\nhad a really\ninteresting childhood where uh\nmy mother was out and out like loved me\nand\nshowered me with love and my father was\nmuch more detached and aloof\nand what that allowed me to do is i feel\nlike it gave me\nat least at least how i see myself i see\nmyself as someone who's pretty resilient\nemotionally agile can\ncan you know can can roll with the\npunches and\nand uh in touch with my emotions though\nat the same time\nand i feel like knowing that i was loved\nbut knowing that i had to figure it out\non my own\nwas like a really nice unique\ncombination so i'm grateful to my\nparents for the different\ntraining i got from them in one sense\nbecause i always knew my mum loved me\nand she'd always be there for me\nand my dad he kind of gave me the space\nto become my own human and become my own\nman and become my own person because he\nnever really\nwas there to to coddle me or you know\nto guide me and so i wonder\nsimilarly with what we were talking\nabout with the extremes i see fragility\nas\nsometimes i see as parents and i'm\ntrying to understand this i'm not a\nparent yet so i'm trying\nto understand it for my future sometimes\ni see that children today are so cuddled\nand so like almost like insulated and\nthey've\nit's almost like they're wrapped with\nbubble wrap right like you've got bubble\nwrap all around them\nand i wonder is that just making them\nmore fragile is the\nover compensating actually creating\nfragility because now\nif they've been wrapped in bubble wrap\nall their life when they're dropped one\nday\ndoes that make them fragile and on the\nother side\nwhat we've seen before where the\ncompletely\nyou know almost unparenting where there\nwas no\nthought of like a child's emotions and\nunderstanding them and\ngetting to know them and seeing how they\nfelt that obviously led to a lot of\ntrauma which we which we see today in\nthe world where people talk about their\nparents that way\nso so how how do we how do we train\nourselves\nfriends people in our life children how\ndo we train people to be\num not fragile and and actually have\nemotional\nemotional agility and and steadiness\nwhere does that where does that start\nso um i've given you very long answers\nfor\na lot of the questions i'm going to give\nyou like a very short answer and then\nand then i'll do longer\num but when you're saying you know does\ncoddling make children more fragile the\nvery short answer is\nyes yes it does what counts as coddling\nbecause i i want to know what counts as\ncoddling and what's considered good\nas you described your your childhood\nthis\nthis very beautiful um\ni just very beautiful um\nlike almost kind of a mental model\nand i want to walk you through this and\nand then\ni'll circle back to what i think this\nactually looks like when it comes to\nthe way we parent and the way we connect\nin our relationships\nso bear with me all of us have had this\nexperience\nof going to a restaurant and\nyou see a little child in that\nrestaurant and\nthe the child maybe is 18 months old or\ntwo years old\nand the child has a huge\namount of glee and fun in running away\nfrom its parents or caregivers and it's\nthe most\ncute thing to watch because what the\nchild does is the child's in a\nrestaurant\nit kind of runs a few steps it looks\nbehind it makes sure that its parents or\ncaregivers are there and then it runs\naway\neven more and then it looks again and\nruns even more\nnow what is happening there is so\nbeautiful\nuh one of the most beautiful\npsychologist john bolby described this\nidea that\nchildren need a secure base you know\nchildren need a secure base and it's\nthis really\nfascinating thing that you see in a\nrestaurant where\nthe very essence of knowing\nthat the caregiver is there that\nif something's going to go wrong that\nthe caregiver is going to be able to\nhelp okay step in and help\nit's that essence that allows the child\nto explore\nso in a completely interesting\nparadoxical way it's\nknowing that there is a secure base to\ncome back to\nthat then allows the child to be\ncurious to take risks to grow\nto extend themselves etc and as you were\ndescribing your childhood\nit it seemed to me that like the\ncombination\nof your parents almost allowed\nallowed for that in you now\nwhat is going on here it's it's the\nknowledge\nin the child that someone's got their\nback\nokay that is the essence then of\nallowing the child to be\nresilient and to explore and be curious\nokay let's bring this to ourselves\ncompassion i know it's something that\nyou talk about in your work\nand yet there is still this idea that\nbeing compassionate\nyou know whether it's in organizations\nor beyond is somehow about being\nweak or lazy or letting yourself off the\nhook\nbut self-compassion is as fundamental\nas that example that i just gave in the\nrestaurant\nwhen you have your own back when you\nknow that if a relationship doesn't work\nout\nor that you know you didn't get the job\nor that something else has gone wrong\nand you\nknow that you will love yourself that\nyou will be\nthere for yourself that you will be kind\nto yourself\nin the way you speak and hold yourself\nwhen you have your own back what it\nactually does\nis it allows you to then\ntake risks be more honest be more\nmotivated\nand to explore in the world and so this\nidea\nthat self-compassion is about being you\nknow\nthe myth of it being weak or lazy or\nbeing dishonest\nin actual fact it is the opposite people\nare self-compassionate\nare more able to be honest and motivated\nand so on\nnow circling back to your question\nbecause now i want to broaden this into\nrelationship\nwhat does this look like in relationship\nand i'll use the example of a child but\nlet's we can extend this into couple or\ninto the workplace even\nso when a child for instance i'll be\nvery practical here\nsay you've got a child who comes home\nfrom school\nin in non-covert times right now my kids\naren't\nin school but you've got a child that\nthat comes or not in\nnormal normal day school um so you've\ngot a child that comes home from school\nand the child\nis extremely upset and the child says\nmommy jack didn't invite me to his\nbirthday\nparty now i'm not gonna invite him to\nmine\nwhat you can see is the child is\nbeing rigid okay in agile the child is\nhooked\ni'm upset now i'm going to react in this\nway\nnow often what we want to do as parents\nis\nwith very good intentions we want to\njump in it's\nheartbreaking for us that the child is\nbeing rejected that the\nchild hasn't been invited and so what we\nwant to do is we want to step\nin and we want to say to the child don't\nworry you know\ni'll phone jack's parents and i'll\norganize your invitation\nor or don't worry you know i'm here for\nyou let's\nlet's go bake cupcakes now we do this\nwith really good intention but\nwhat are we doing we are signaling to\nthe child\nthat there are some emotions that are\ngood when they're happy everything's\nfine\nbut there are some emotions to be feared\nand\nwe should fear sadness we should fear\nanger we should fear fear\nand what we are doing when we steal\naway our child's opportunity\nto feel the full range of emotions in\nthe way that i am suggesting that as\nadults we need to feel then what we are\ndoing\nis we are not allowing them to develop\nreally important emotional skills and\nthese are\nnumber one emotions are not to be feared\nthere is\nnothing in anxiety or\nanger that is going to kill you\nor sad there's nothing in that\nnumber two a child that is\nsupported in feeling their different\nemotions\nrealizes that emotions pass that\nemotions\nare transient and isn't that that is\njust foundational to mental health\nand well-being often when we struggle\nwith our difficult emotions it's because\nwe feel that the emotion is here to stay\nthe sadness is here to stay\nso the child learns emotions are not to\nbe feared the child learns\nthat emotions pass the child also learns\nthat things that\nthey do can actually shape\nhow they feel okay that they don't need\nsomeone to come and\npaper over emotions but they're\ndeveloping the skills and\nthis you know jay we teach our children\nmathematics we teach them\nscience which but it doesn't matter what\nthey\nknow in the world if they are not able\nto deal with the fragility of\nlife of pandemics of broken\nrelationships\nthey do not have the skills to thrive\nso what does the alternative look like\nthe alternative looks like firstly\nyou know and i might use this beautiful\nword which is\ni started my ted talk with this word\nsawabana sawabona\nis a zulu word for hello\nyou hear it every day on the streets of\nsouth africa which is where i grew up\nbut there is such a beautiful and\npowerful intention behind the word\nsabobona because\nsoul born and literally translated means\ni see\nyou and by seeing you i bring you\ninto being the first thing we want to do\nwith\npeople who are experiencing difficult\nemotions\nis not to tell them just be positive\nwhen we say to someone just be positive\nwe are saying\nbasically i don't see your humanity\nbecause humanity is woven with difficult\nemotions\nso with our children with our loved ones\nwe need to be able to show up to them in\nthe same way as i'm inviting us to show\nup to ourselves\nwith acceptance with compassion and with\na sourborne\nto see to see so that's\nshowing up the second part jay this is\ncircling back which is\nhelping the child to label emotions\neffectively\nyou don't need to jump in and fix just\nhelping the child to label emotions\neffectively\nwe've already explored how that is so\nimportant\nto their well-being you know it sounds\nlike you're really\nangry with jack because he didn't invite\nyou to the birthday party\nand that you are sad and that you\ndisappointed\nand that you feel rejected\nand then j lost our emotions signposts\nour values\nso the child who says\ni haven't been invited to this birthday\nparty what is the\nthe anger sign posting what is the\nsadness i'm posting\nit's signposting that the person values\nfriendship and so you can have the\nmost beautiful conversation that is\nliterally developing\nyour child's character their values\ntheir moral compass\nwhere you say to them it sounds like\nfriendship is important\nto you how do you want to be a friend\nwhat does being a good friend look like\nhow do you want to come to the\nconversation with jack tomorrow\nso what you're doing is you're not\njumping in\nand coddling instead you are providing\nspace for emotion\nand in that emotion there's the seeing\nthere's the stepping out and there's the\ndata not directives the values and\njay you know i again use this as an\nexample\nwith children but the same applies if\nwe're leaders\ninstead of signaling to people they're\neither on the bus or off the bus\nwe can show up to their difficult\nemotions and we can\nwe can try to understand what's going on\nand we can help them to\nchoose who they want to be in the moment\nof uncertainty\nand we can do the same with our loved\nones and with\nourselves susan i have learned so much\ntoday from you i'm\ni'm uh honestly so excited to go and put\na lot of this into practice because\nit's it's also speed it's like trying to\ndo things\nfast and living a speedy\noverproductive life is what stops us\nfrom being able to do this because\neverything you're saying requires\npatience and\ntime and stillness and space it requires\nthat in our lives it's\nit's so hard to do in a fast-paced\nhectic environment where it's easier\njust to say\nokay i can't work with these people\ngonna work with whatever it may be\nyes yes and and and it's needed it's\nit's really needed\nit's showing the need for us to to\ni don't mean slow down as in do nothing\ni just mean\nbeing present and allowing ourselves to\nhave the space to think in this way\nwell jay firstly thank you so much for\nthe conversation i think i think it's\nso there's power in the pause there's\nsuch\npower in the pause and sometimes you\nknow sometimes the pause\nis we know people who spend even 10\nminutes writing about\nwhat their values are you know if you're\ngoing into a difficult relationship or a\ndifficult conversation or\na new experience like who do you want to\nbe in that we know that even\nspending 10 minutes thinking about your\nvalues in the situation\num actually and in studies like it can\nchange the course\nof whether people drop out of university\nor or not\nlike literally changing the course of\npeople's lives\nbut jay you invited people earlier to\ndo that example where they say you know\ni am sad versus i'm noticing that i'm\nfeeling sad\nand that is such a quick beautiful\ncall to action and there's another that\nis\nthat i'd love to add that which is if\nyou imagine a piece of paper\nand you write down on the one side of\nthe piece of paper\nwhat it is that you might have been\nfeeling lately\ngrief loneliness anxiety anger\njoy whatever that is now\nour culture would ask you\nwould instruct you to turn\nover the piece of paper and instead of\nlonely\nto write what you should be grateful for\num\ninstead of anxious to\nwrite you know what why you should be\npositive\nwhat i'm gonna do is i'm gonna invite\npeople to do something different\nwhether that is physically or\nemotionally because this can literally\ntake\na second you've got this word\non the piece of paper on the one side on\nthe other side\nturn the piece of paper over and ask\nyourself\nwtf what the funk\nwhat is the function of the emotion what\nis this emotion\ntelling me about what is important to me\nor what i\nneed lonely\nintimacy and connection grief\nit might be love that i've loved\nand that i need to reconnect with that\nlove for the person\nsadness might again be\nlooking for a way to connect differently\nuh joy might be\nsignaling that you you know\nthrive when you are doing a particular\nkind of work and that you need more of\nthat creativity\nboredom if you're feeling bored\nboredom might be signaling growth so\nit's a very different way of being and\nit\nwhen we step into the pause there is\nextraordinary power in that and i\nbelieve\nthat that power is what allows us to\ngalvanize\nthe courage the whisper not just for\nourselves but for our community and for\nour\nculture and for our countries and for\nour world\nthat needs more of this right now\ni couldn't agree with you more susan\neveryone who's been\nlistening or watching today if you want\nto dive deeper you can grab a copy of\nsusan's book\nemotional agility get unstuck embrace\nchange and thrive in work and life it's\nright there we'll put a link in the\ncomments as well susan i like i i meant\nto as i said\na few moments ago i've learned so much\ntoday and we end\nevery on-purpose podcast episode\nwith our final five segment so these\nquestions have to be answered\nin one word or one sentence\nmaximum so we'll see how it goes\nfirst question is what is the hardest\npart\nabout being courageous the hardest\npart is in a world that seems to\ndraw us in other directions\nand compare ourselves constantly it's\nabout being grounded\nin what your version of success and\neffectiveness looks like\nwhat is the\nskill that you missed out on before you\nlearn to be emotionally agile\nwell firstly i think i'm still learning\nto be emotionally agile\num i think\nfor me i i\nhave very big emotions and so i think\nfor me it was like often getting hooked\ninto these difficult emotions where\nyou know the the the arguments that i\nwould have with my husband are like you\nknow you don't love me you know you know\nthe\ndrama i think i think that for for me\nit was being able to almost\nrecognize the capacity to helicopter\nabove our emotions\nand to be able to be wise in the place\nof our emotions all right question\nnumber three what's something that you\nknow to be true but others may disagree\non\nhappiness is over rated\nas a goal we get to\nhappiness by pursuing things that are\nmeaningful\nrather than by pursuing happiness in\nitself\nquestion number four what is one thing\nyou wish you knew 10 years ago\none thing i wish i knew 10 years ago is\nhow quickly it all goes you know how\nquickly\nchildren grow up how quickly 10 years\nflies\nhow quickly it goes i turned 50 this\nyear\nand it just goes\nhappy birthday in advance and congrats\nit's amazing\nuh and fifth and final question what's\nthe biggest lesson you've learned in the\nlast 12 months\nthe biggest lesson that i've learned in\nthe past 12 months is that often\nthe things that you feel are going to be\nreally difficult um and i'm talking in\nthis context for\nme i went from you know traveling\nconstantly into\nbeing at home um are often an invitation\nto practice your\nown work and to reset and i think for me\nvery much\num at first there was this idea of oh my\ngoodness you know\nall of the things that are typical in my\nlife feel stripped away\nand i think that i have\nlearned how resilient we are\nas human beings if we can step into that\nand for me certainly\nof re-threaded a sense of\nthe way that i'm with my family the way\nthat i use my time and it's just\nactually been you know notwithstanding\nthe difficulties\nit's it's been an extraordinary gift for\nme that's a great answer susan i can\nagree more thank you so much please let\nus know where are the best\nplaces
