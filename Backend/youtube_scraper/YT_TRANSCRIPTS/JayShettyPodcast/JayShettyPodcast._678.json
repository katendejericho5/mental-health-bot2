    "transcript": "there is a difference between doubting\nyourself and doubting your skills right\nyou're never saying\ni think i'm an idiot or i think i'm\ncompletely incapable of being a good\nentrepreneur\nor a great investor or a successful\ncontent creator you're just saying\ni don't know if i'm there yet i think i\nhave work to do i have knowledge to pick\nup i have expertise to gain and i think\nwhat that is is basically just having\nconfidence in yourself as a learner as\nopposed to\nas an expert or a master\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back\nevery week to listen learn and grow now\ni know that we talk a lot about\nlearning we talk a lot about growing we\ntalk a lot about thinking differently\nbut today\nwe're actually talking about unlearning\nwe're talking about all the things that\nwe need to\nreflect on and maybe rewire and renew\nour thoughts about\nbecause i'm speaking with the one and\nonly adam grant an\norganizational psychologist at wharton\nwho's been recognized as one of the\nworld's 10 most\ninfluential management thinkers he's\nalso a new york times best-selling\nauthor\nwho has sold millions of copies of his\nbooks on generosity\ndriving success non-conformist moving\nthe world\nand building resilience after adversity\nhe currently writes for the new york\ntimes about work and psychology\nand host work life a podcast on how to\nmake\nwork not suck his latest book think\nagain is the topic of our conversation\ntoday\nthis book seems to cover so many of\ntoday's biggest\nchallenges and mindsets that we're all\nstruggling with uh challenges that we're\nall having in our lives\ntell me why you thought now's the time\nto write think again based on obviously\nall the years of study that you've done\nfor it but\nwhy was now the right time to get people\nto think again\ni actually didn't realize it was when i\nstarted working on think again\nit was i think it was three years ago\nthat i i started writing it and it just\ngrew out of my frustration with\npeople who were clinging to knowledge\nthat was no longer accurate for a world\nthat had changed a lot\nor who were stuck to opinions that\nclearly it was time to question\nand maybe complicate a little bit and i\nfelt like okay this is a great time to\nsay i have spent my career as an\norganizational psychologist thinking\nagain\nright my job is to rethink how we work\nhow we lead how we live our lives\nbut i never really explored the process\nof thinking again and\ndone a deep dive into the question of\nhow do we update our own opinions and\nassumptions\nhow do we open other people's minds and\nhow do we build cultures of learning\nso i set out to write this book and then\nthe pandemic hits when i'm\nabout halfway through writing it and\nsuddenly we are all forced to rethink\nall these things that we've taken for\ngranted most of our lives\neven something as basic as can i hung my\ngrandparents\nor can i go and eat in an indoor\nrestaurant or will there be live sports\non tv\nand given all the rethinking that we've\nhad to do because of the pandemic it\nseemed like the right time\nto try to give people a general\nframework for how to think about it\nyeah asking people to think again is is\nquite a bold thing to do\nbecause we feel so safe\nin our regurgitated\npattern-oriented thoughts like i feel\nthat even now\na lot of what i hear is or when are\nthings going to go\nback right i'm still hearing that and we\nhear things like well when are things\ngoing to be normal again\nand there feels like it feels like we\nhave such a\nstronghold as humans on safety\nsecurity stability certainty\nand and this idea of things staying the\nsame\nthat when you say think again it's like\nwell actually that's a lot of work like\nit's almost like we're scared of that\nso tell me about what you found and why\nare we so obsessed with things staying\nthe same and\nand having that same thought and where\nwhere's the root of that jay it's ironic\nthat you're asking me this question\nright as a monk\nyou specialize in helping people\nunderstand and accept\nimpermanence so let me ask you why do\nyou think we're so\nattached to our ideas and opinions\nas opposed to being willing to question\nthem look at you switching\nswitching the interview over already\ngetting everyone to think again\nhow they should structure their\ninterview questions uh\nnever to allow for this uh from from a\nvery\nmonk spiritual perspective the idea\nwould be is that\nwe are all wired for\nspontaneity for growth for ever\nexpansion but through our education\nthrough our parenting through the\nconditioning\nof what we've experienced in this\nmaterial world\nwe've become safer or feel\nsafer in this false safety net\nof stability and from a spiritual point\nof view the idea would be that there is\nno such thing as stability there is no\nsecurity\neverything from the cells in our body\nthrough to our minds through to every\npart of us in this material world\nis constantly changing and so the idea\nof holding on to something\nthe root of that is because we feel\nor we've been trained to believe that\nthat's how you survive that's how you\nthat's how you're happy that's how\nyou you're scared of almost taking a\nrisk\nof what may happen if i let go of this\nwhen actually when you live in a\nspiritually abundant life you already\nknow\nthat movement and growth and expansion\nis the only way that you feel happiness\nso from a very spiritual point of view i\ncould answer in many different ways but\nfrom a very spiritual point of view that\nwould be seen as the root\nthat tracks very closely with what we\nwould say in psychology which is\ni first of all there's there's just a\nbasic ego threat\nthat comes from admitting that your\nopinions have changed because\nthat means you're saying you know what i\nwas wrong\nand for a lot of people that makes them\nquestion their intelligence\nit makes them worry that everyone else\nis going to find out that they're a\nfraud and it it plays into imposter\nsyndrome\nand then there's also a challenge of\nunpredictability that\nif i need to change my opinions every\nday or every hour or even every week or\nmonth\nthen how do i make sense of a world that\nis not standing still under my feet and\ni think a lot of people are\nuncomfortable with that idea and they\nlike to maintain a sense of control\nby saying look if i stick to the comfort\nof conviction and avoid the discomfort\nof doubt\nthen i can feel like i have a grip on\nthe world around me\nand then i think there's a social piece\nof this too which is belonging\nright if if i am willing to rethink some\nof my views\ni'm putting myself at risk for being\nexpelled from my group\nright i might be in some ways\nchallenging my tribe\nand that sense of exclusion that risk of\nloneliness is obviously something that's\neasier\nto steer clear of yeah so where do you\ndraw the line between\nthinking again and being\nstable and feeling like you're in a safe\nspace like how do you how do you kind of\ndraw that line because i feel like\nfrom your studies i'm sure you found\nplaces where it was good to not think\nagain or\nor you know good to not question and\nalmost sometimes\nover questioning leads to overthinking\nand\nover analyzing and procrastination tell\nus about that boundary\nyeah i think it's very tricky it's\nprobably a tightrope walk for a lot of\npeople\nbut my reading the evidence is that when\npeople start to\nmake their opinions their identity they\nget in trouble\nso you believe a bunch of things and you\nsay well that's who i am\nand i just i would love for people to\nimagine rewinding the clock half a\ncentury or a century or more\nand say okay if you made your opinions\nor your beliefs your identity and let's\nsay you're a teacher\nyou might have seen yourself as a\ncorporal punisher right whose job it is\nto discipline\nstudents or if you were a doctor you\nwould have said all right i'm a\nprofessional\nlobotomist and what i do is i you know i\nsolve all kinds of medical problems by\ntaking out part of the frontal lobe or\nif you're a police officer you might\nhave seen yourself more recently as a\nstop and frisker\nand the problem with all these\nidentities is they're attached to\npolicies and practices\nthat we now know are counterproductive i\nthink what we want is to build our\nidentities around our values\nand that's where we're looking for a\nlittle bit more stability and\ncrowdedness\nso i want to go to the doctor who says\nmy values are around protecting and\npromoting health and i'm\nopen to rethinking what are the best\nprocedures to do that right\ni want to go to the police officer who\nsays i'm here to promote justice and\nsafety\nand i'm not sure what the best ways to\ndo that are but i'm going to look at the\ndata\nand i definitely want to send my kids to\nthe teacher who says i'm here to help\nkids learn\nfirst and foremost and i'm not going to\ncommit to any one way of doing that\nand i i don't know that we should always\nfreeze our values\nright i think they should evolve too but\nit's a lot easier for me to say\nmy core values are generosity excellence\nintegrity and freedom\nand i'm going to be pretty flexible\nabout learning\nthe most effective ways to live by those\nvalues what do you think about that\ni think that's such a great distinction\ni i've never heard it put that way but i\nreally appreciate that for me that's\nbeen really clarifying\nabout how your values as you said they\ndon't need to be frozen they can they\ncan evolve as well\nbut the idea is that you have a set of\nvalues but you're flexible and adaptable\nabout how they come to life\nat different times in your life and and\ni often say to people like\ni love the books that i studied uh\nliving as a monk\nand and i got so much value from them\nand i obviously share them\nbut i'm always open to discovering\nsomething\nsome new spiritual truth that i'm not\naccustomed to or aware of when i'm\nspeaking to someone because\ni just want to be a seeker of the truth\nand and i think that allows me to have\nthis\nvery uh deep affinity for the work that\ni've done\nbut not a sentimental attachment to them\nif that makes sense and i think\nthat's what i was getting from you is\nthat often we create this sentimental\nattachment\nto our beliefs because we feel they\ndefine us\nas opposed to feeling well i have this\nvery strong loyalty\nbut i'm still able to peruse and\nand search and discover i i think you\nnailed it\nattachment is such a barrier for so many\npeople to\nrethinking opinions and ideas that are\nno longer serving them well and this\nthis isn't just true with the things we\nbelieve about the world right\nit's also true for the plans that we\nmake so you mentioned a lot of people\nare asking when are we going back and\nobviously i think you and i would both\nsay well\nactually let's just try to move forward\nyes but it's so common for people to to\nget attached to\nearly images that they formed of how\nthey wanted to live their lives and who\nthey wanted to be\nright anybody who ever was asked the\nquestion as a kid what do you want to be\nwhen you grow up\nand had an answer like well i'm going to\nbe a lawyer or i'm going to be a doctor\nand then 20 or 30 years later still\nlocked into that plan\nnever really questioning does that make\nsense for me\nthere's a there's a term in psychology\nfor that it's called identity\nforeclosure\nand it's the idea of sort of seizing and\nfreezing too early\non a sense of who you want to be before\nyou've really explored alternatives\nand i think the danger of that is what\nyou want what you value what you're\nlooking for in life is going to evolve\nover time\nand i think we need our identities to\nevolve with that\nyeah absolutely i couldn't agree more\nand i and i guess\npeople struggle with thinking again\nbecause we're almost like where do we\nstart like what\nwhat value do you start on what part of\nyour life do you start on\nin in your studies where did you find a\ngood place to start\nthinking again like because i feel like\nyou're opening up like\na can of worms of like childhood trauma\nyou know it's like people\npeople don't know where to start so\nwhere did you start yeah i\ni honestly don't know the answer to that\nquestion because i think it's going to\nbe a little different for everyone\nbut let's just let's continue on the the\nplan path for a second and say okay\na lot of people have career regrets\nright they they started down a path\nand then they they fell victim to\nescalation of commitment to a losing\ncourse of action\nwhich is where you you invest time and\nenergy and money\nin in a path and then you discover you\nknow what this isn't quite what i wanted\nit to be and instead of cutting your\nlosses you double down\neconomists will say that's because of\nsunk costs right you don't want to admit\nthat you've wasted all that time and\nmoney\nbut the psychological factors are even\nmore important ego and image\ni don't want to look in the mirror and\nadmit to myself that i made a stupid\ndecision\nand i want to prove to everybody else\nthat i made a smart one\nand so i get caught in this\nself-justification spiral\nwhere i'm rationalizing my past choices\nas opposed to rethinking them\nand what i've advised my students to do\nfor years is to say look you know what\nyou go to the doctor or the dentist when\nyou're healthy a couple times a year\njust for a checkup\nmaybe we should have career checkups put\na reminder on your calendar twice a year\nto ask yourself have i reached a\nlearning plateau in my job\nor a lifestyle plateau for that matter\nhave i learned something new\nabout what my strengths are or my values\nare and is it possible that this culture\nis no longer serving those\nand i think having that kind of\ncheckpoint is a great way to keep\nyourself honest\nand make sure that you do some\nrethinking about what your plans are and\ni don't think it has to be limited to\ncareer right i think we could do\noccasional marriage checkups we could do\nall kinds of\nlife decision checkups i think a lot of\npeople have done this during the\npandemic saying wait a minute where in\nthe world do i want to live\ni don't need to be tethered to the city\nthat i've been for the last eight years\nthat's such a practical uh piece of\nadvice and and i love that one and\nwe're almost scared of asking that i\nwant to talk to you a bit about that\nfear of addressing that because we're\nscared of\nasking that question because of the idea\nof what if i hate my job and then now\nfrom tomorrow i know i hate my job and\nthen\ni'm just going to be depressed or if i\nask that question about my partner then\nmaybe we need to get a divorce or maybe\nwe need to break up\nhow do we curb our fear\nof even asking that question and\nthinking again because that seems to be\none of the biggest blocks to even\ngetting to that point of doing that\ncheckup\ni think a lot of this is about regret in\nthe long run\nthe decisions that we tend to regret are\nnot our actions\nthey're our inactions they're the\nchances that we didn't take\nand i think in a lot of cases right\nrebooting your career or\nrethinking a relationship is scary you\nknow it's even scarier\nnever even considering that possibility\nin the first place\nand so look i think everybody's afraid\nof taking a risk or failing at some\nlevel\nwhat we want to do is remember that we\nshould be even more afraid of failing to\ntry\num yeah i i think regrets is is such a\nbig one\nuh that i that i've often thought about\na lot and\nhas helped me so much in my life i\nremember\neven even before i started creating\ncontent it was i i remember asking\nmyself\nwould i regret not trying because\nobviously when you start something i'm\nsure you felt this\nwhen you started studying or when you\nbecame an author for the first time\nit's almost like will i regret not\ntrying because you don't know if it's\ngoing to work\nand and you're so right that now i look\nback and i think\nwow i would have had massive regrets not\nbecause you know where things can go but\nto be in that same place again and again\nand again and again and again\nand and i think that's what we don't\nremember is that\nwe're always worried about what if the\nnext step doesn't work out not realizing\nthat this step around right now\nisn't feeling great either i think\nthere's so much wisdom in that and\na funny place that you can see it is\nwith students who are taking tests\nyeah where you you see that students are\nreally reluctant\nonce they've come up with an answer to\nchange their response\neven though the data show that on\naverage if you're you're willing to\noverride your first instinct\nyou actually improve your score and\nhilariously when we tell students this\nthey still are reluctant to rethink\ntheir answers and i think regret is a\nhuge factor here because\nimagine the pain of saying i had the\nright answer\nand i undid it yeah as opposed to if i\njust stick to my gut\nand i don't rethink it well it doesn't\nseem like i was ever going gonna get it\nright in the first place\nand i think if we're not careful that\ncan obviously steer us in the wrong\ndirection\nthat's crazy that even when you tell\npeople\nstudents in that example that they still\ndon't change like\nwhy why is it that how many times do we\nhave to hear something\nto know that it works out have you\nfigured this out like like what do we\nneed\nwhat is needed to genuinely change like\nwhat is needed to genuinely think again\nand and act on that thinking i think\nprobably the most relevant date i've\nseen is\nuh from studies of leaders introducing\norganizational changes\nand trying to bring a new vision into a\nteam or into a company\nand on average in the classic data\nleaders under communicated their visions\nby a multiple of eight\neight times less often than people\nneeded to hear the vision\nthey explained it and i think a lot of\nthat is because\nonce you come up with the vision it\nmakes perfect sense to you it's crystal\nclear in your head\nright you've spent days or weeks or\nmonths or maybe years thinking through\nthis\nand so the first time you say it you\nassume everyone else gets it\nbut obviously they don't the first time\nyou explain it and i don't know\nfor any person whether that multiple is\nunder communicating by 3 or 17 but\ni think on average we we probably\nunderdo it for the most part and\nwhat i often tell leaders is the moment\nyou'll know that\nyou've really gotten through to people\nis when they say okay\nenough already i get it i'm tired of\nhearing it and that's when you know\nyou've you've really gotten your point\nacross\nyeah it's almost like you don't know\n[Music]\nevery time you\nfeel you've oversaid it you haven't\nuntil that person thinks you've oversaid\nit\nuntil i i guess until you feel your\nteam or your partner can complete your\nsentence\nright it's almost it's almost like\nlooking at google like google can auto\ncomplete because it knows what most of\nus\nare asking all of the time and the idea\nthat if i was going to say something and\nyou could complete my sentence chances\nare i've said it\nway too much it's like it's like that\nfeeling of when your friend or your\npartner says something like yeah you've\ntold me that story like 72 times like i\nknow exactly what you're\ni know exactly what your mom does in\nthat scenario whatever it may be\nuh that that's a good checking system i\nlike that i really like that i think\ni think i undervalue that too you we\nassume\neveryone thinks like us we do\nand i would say the most the most\npowerful form of persuasion is\nself-persuasion\nand that means that instead of having to\nrepeat your vision\nover and over again you explain it once\nor twice\nand then you ask people to articulate it\nin their own words and\nwhat they often think they're doing is\nis trying to get other people fired up\nabout it\nbut really what they're doing is they're\ninternalizing it and\nconvincing themselves that this is a\ngood idea yeah\nabsolutely you you mentioned in your\nbook that people tend to slip into\nthree well there's there's a few but\nthere's one more but the mindsets of\nthree different professions\nwhen they think and talk and i love this\ni really really like this\nshe said preacher politician and\nprosecutor\ntell us a bit about those and give us\nsome examples of those so that we can\nunderstand\nand everyone who's listening and\nwatching what i want you to do is\nreflect on when you fall into one of\nthese because we all fall into them at\ndifferent times in our life so\nif you're listening right now or\nwatching please reflect on\nas adam's guiding us through when in\nyour life you do one of these things so\nadam such a fun direction to go i i'm\ni hardly even know where to start in\npart because when i think about my life\nas an organizational psychologist\nit is incredibly peculiar to me that\nalthough i've never worked as a preacher\na prosecutor or a politician\nsomehow all of those occupations managed\nto waltz into my mind\nduring my daily life and i think that's\ntrue for all of us so the\nthe original idea comes from a brilliant\npaper that my colleague phil tatlock\nwrote\nand the idea is that we are social\ncreatures right that we're very\nconcerned with\nour standing in the world and what other\npeople think of us\nand that a lot of times a lot of the\ntime we think we're making rational\ndecisions\nwe're actually paying a ton of attention\nto\nwhere we fit into a social hierarchy\nwhen we're in preacher mode\nwe believe that we have found the truth\nand our job is to go out and proselytize\nour sacred\nsacred beliefs and get other people on\nboard with them\nprosecutor mode is sort of the reverse\nthat's about saying you know what\ni've got to win an argument you are\nwrong\nand then politician mode is essentially\ncampaigning for the approval of an\naudience\nright trying to lobby to get a tribe on\nboard with what whatever you think\nthey want to hear or trying to earn\ntheir admiration in some way\nand i think the the thing that i worry\nmost about is if you're in preacher\nprosecutor mode\nyou don't do enough rethinking because\nyou already believe you're right\nand everyone else is wrong so why would\nyou ever change your mind\nand in politician mode we see more\nflexibility but it kind of looks like\nflip-flopping\nright i don't i don't really believe\nwhat i'm saying\ni'm just trying to appease my audience\nand cater to what they want to hear\nand so you know it looks like i'm i'm\nrethinking at the wrong times and maybe\nfor the wrong reasons\njay i'm curious if these three modes\nwhich one is your biggest advice\nwhich one is my biggest vice it would it\nwould definitely ha\nfor years i would say it's the preacher\none for sure like i think i think for\nyears\nuh and and i find that especially when\nyou're in an early stage formative\nstage of a set of beliefs preach is very\nnatural\nso i remember when i first uh started\ngetting involved in spiritual teachings\nit was like i was preaching to my\nparents i'm like preaching to all my\nfriends and you're like here's how you\nshould have raised me yeah\nexactly and you like push everyone in\nyour life away from you\nbecause you think you've figured it out\nand you forget that this person has a\nbit more age they have a bit more\nmaturity they have\nthere's things that come and come with\nlife and time and experience\nand so i think for long parts of my life\nespecially in early stages of anything\ni think i've naturally shifted into that\nand then slowly\ntried to move away from that as much as\ni\ncan hopefully into the fourth mindset\nwhich we'll talk about but yes in answer\nto your question\ni'd say my biggest advice has definitely\nbeen the preacher mode\nthat's so interesting it it i i've\nthought about this\nover the years and whenever i encounter\nsomebody who i think is\nis pretty frequently in preacher mode\ni just think okay you know what highly\neffective\nfor appealing to their existing\nfollowers\nright because there's a group of people\nwho are already drinking that kool-aid\nand it's very inspiring and it gives you\na sense that you've\nyou've found some kind of enlightenment\nbut to everybody else\nlike why are you trying to force feed me\nyour wisdom right i didn't sign up for\nthis\nback off and so i think the more\nresistant or skeptical an audience is\nthe more likely that preaching is to\nbackfire\nyes i i couldn't agree with you more and\ni think that's that's where i started to\nrealize and it was\nit was more so it was luckily i i feel\nlike i caught it early where i was just\nlike well actually i i only want to\nyou know i just want to discover more\nand hence the podcast has been\nphenomenal for that because\ni'm sitting with people who can share\nideas and insights that may be\ndifferent to what i've grown up with or\nchallenging sometimes and sometimes even\nsparking debate in a positive sense\nand so i i think that's why sitting down\nwith people from different i mean me and\nyou didn't grow up in the same area we\ndidn't\ngrow up around the same group of people\nand we\nwe don't even stay in fascinated in\nnecessarily\nthe same types of thought on a daily\nbasis and therefore\nthis conversation allows me to do that\nand and that's why i think\nthe podcast or the idea of sitting down\nwith someone\nis so powerful it is even though one of\nus is having a very\nbad hair life or a great one\nor a great one you know or a great one\nso\num but the fourth mindset which you say\nis\nalmost like the best mindset to be in or\none that you encourage\nuh is the mindset of the scientist uh\ntell us about how\nwe shouldn't just look at that as like\noh i have to be like a scientist but\nwhat that mindset actually means\nyeah i'm not suggesting that anybody has\nto go and become einstein or bill nye\nthe science guy\nright the thought is you don't have to\nwork in a lab you don't have to wear a\nwhite coat or carry around test tubes\ni think about being a scientist as as a\nway of seeing the world\nand the way of navigating your life i\nthink that what scientists value\nis truth right trying to get closer to\ntruth even if\nif they might never really find it and\nthat means whatever opinions they form\nare tentative right they're they're\nhunches they might be hypotheses\nand what i need to do as a scientist is\nwhen i have a\nan idea i want to go out in the world\nand explore\nwhether it's true and better yet when\nit's true that means i might run some\nlittle experiments i might do\nobservations i might interview people\nright if i were going to go into sort of\nanthropologist mode\nand the hope is that i'm going to\ndiscover sometimes that i was wrong\nand i'm going to discover information\nthat challenges my beliefs not just that\naffirms my beliefs\nand after all i think that's what\nlearning is about jay right evolving our\nbeliefs\nnot just validating what we already\nthink is true and\ni i'm actually starting to rethink this\na little bit because\nuh i think the the data the data are\nreally compelling so\nyou know there's there's an incredible\nexperiment with italian founders\nwhere some of them are randomly assigned\nthese are these are entrepreneurs who\nare pre-revenue\nand there's a control group who\nbasically takes a couple month\nentrepreneurship course\nand then there's another group that gets\nthe same education in how to start a\nbusiness\nonly they're taught to think like\nscientists and this is a little bit\nforeign for business people right but\nthey're they're encouraged to just say\nlook\nyou know what your your strategy that's\njust a theory\nabout a future state of the world and\nhow your company can succeed in it\nyour customer interviews those are ways\nto develop hypotheses about\nwhere your theory would be successful\nand then you build a minimum viable\nproduct\nthat is an experiment to run and then\nwhat data do you need to find out if\nyour experiment worked or didn't\nso the control group over the next year\nmakes less than 300 us dollars in\nrevenue on average\nper startup the scientist group makes\nover 12\n000 us dollars in that year on average\nper startup it's a staggering effect\nyeah driven by the fact that the the\nscientists are more willing to pivot\nthat when they're encouraged to think\nlike scientists they say you know what\nmy my strategy might have been bad my\nhypotheses might have been wrong\ni'm willing to change gears and so i\nstopped there and said wow\nif we can teach business people to think\nmore like scientists if we can\nteach entrepreneurs to be a little bit\nmore disciplined that way and\nexperimental in their approach\nthat's actually good for their success\nand growth and i was excited there but i\nhave a hunch that you know\nwhy i'm rethinking this now what what do\nyou think is is maybe missing from this\nperspective\nthat's interesting i i wasn't thinking\nalong those lines i was\ni was agreeing with you and now that\nyou're asking me that question\nyeah yeah i was agreeing with you i i\nfelt i felt like that makes a lot of\nsense\num what's missing from that interesting\nuh i'd love to reflect on that for a\nmoment give me a second let me\nlet me think yeah let me think about\nwhat do i think's missing from that\ni was in agreement with you because i\nfound in my life and and even as a\nyou know even as simply as a content\ncreator which isn't what i\nam as a total but if i look at that part\nof my life that rule holds so\ntrue is that if you just say oh i only\nwant to make this and i'm going to put\nit out\npeople may never watch it or connect it\nor communicate with it\nengage with it so what is missing\ni wonder whether the the missing layer\nis\nthe idea of and and i could be totally\nwrong the only the only thing i can\nthink of is the idea of discovery and\nthen commitment like when\nwhen do you actually finally commit\nrather than continually\ntesting testing testings testing and\nthat could just go on forever\nthat's the only thing that came to mind\nand that may be way off but but that's\nwhat came to mind\nthat that's one of the couple things\nthat have been on my list right now i\nguess one of two\nto be more specific so yeah i think\nthere's there's a risk that if you're a\nscientist you're always rethinking\nyou're always questioning you never\nbelieve that you found the truth you've\njust\nyou ruled out a bunch of hypotheses that\nwere wrong but you know you only have a\nmodel and it's just an approximation\nof reality i think the best antidote\nthat i've come across to that is\nsomething that bob sutton has said\nfor years which is in his view an\nattitude of wisdom\nis acting on the best information you\nhave while constantly doubting what you\nknow\nyeah and i think a good scientist\nprobably does that\nthe other thing that that i i've been\nquestioning a little bit\nis is is the scientist mindset pushing\npeople too much toward\nsort of formal quantitative inquiry\nright saying\nyou can only arrive at knowledge through\nrigorous a b\ntesting and i think you're you're such a\ngreat person to\nyou know to toss this around with\nbecause i think if i were to broaden\nmaybe what i really mean is you want to\nbe in the mindset of a scholar\nright somebody who has the humility and\nthe curiosity\nto know what they don't know and always\nbe searching for new insights and of\ncourse\nscience is one of the tools to do that\nbut as you've discovered in your life\nthere are also more spiritual paths to\nthat kind of inquiry right\nand so i wonder what your take is on the\nscientist versus the scholar\ni try and approach my life and and i\nhaven't used these terms before it's how\ni see myself but in the way you're\ndiscussing it\nof like a spiritual scientist and what i\nmean by that is\ni feel like to get things done you have\nto have the scientific approach\nbut i love looking at insight with\nintuition or like data with the dynamic\nnature of spirituality and i love trying\nto find that\nalmost like the middle of the venn\ndiagram of where that collides\nbecause that's where i find like real\ncreativity is found that's where i find\nlike\nenergies created it's almost like i\nnever feel satisfied\nif i'm only seeking internally if i\ndon't test that externally or if we're\njust testing loads of stuff accidentally\nbut it's not inspired from within and so\nto me\ni love the juxtaposition of of both of\nthose elements like the scholar and the\nscientist\nand as you said because i feel like too\nmany of us\nand this is part of thinking again too\nmany of us\nare trying to be just one thing and and\ni often get the feedback of like jay you\nused to be a monk how can you be in\nmedia now like how can you be on social\nmedia\nyeah it usually goes the other direction\nright yeah exactly\nand and i just opened my heart and i'm\nhonest i'm literally just\nexperimenting with what feels right to\nme like\ni it felt right to me but to become a\nmonk when i was 22.\nand i'm 33 now and at this age it feels\nreally\nright to be doing what i'm doing now and\ni'm allowing myself to grow and evolve\nand not have a\nsimplified identity and so i feel that\nthe scholar and the scientist together\nor the spiritual scientists\ntogether can be a really fascinating\nplace for people to live\nthat venn diagram is such an exciting\nthing when you're able to see the\noverlap\nuh there's actually an example that\njumped out at me when i was writing\nthink again\nwe had a doctoral student danielle\ntussing who is now a professor at suny\nbuffalo\nand danielle decided she was going to\nrethink the importance of ambition and\nleadership\nand she said you know i wonder if\nthere's something to being a little bit\nreluctant\nas a leader to having some hesitations\nabout\ntaking the helm you might be concerned\nabout the implications for work-life\nbalance\nyou might be daunted by the\nresponsibility and worried about being\nracked with guilt\nyou might just be concerned that you're\nnot qualified\nand she ended up it was it was hard to\nstudy this because there aren't that\nmany people who rise to leadership roles\nthat said\nno i don't want it keep me out of here\nno thank you\nbut she ended up studying charged nurses\nin hospitals who get rotated\nand whether they seek the leadership\nrole or not uh on\nevery every so well a certain number of\nshifts will go by and then it's\nbasically your turn\nand so she was able to measure how\nreluctant they felt about leading\nand she found that a little bit of\nreluctance actually predicted\nhigher leadership effectiveness as rated\nby the the people they worked with\nand that was in part because the\nreluctant leaders were more willing to\nempower\nthe people around them they were less\nlikely to assume i know all the answers\nthey were more likely to seek out second\nopinions and i thought this was such a\ncool finding\nand then we were talking about this and\nwe started thinking through okay\nwhere else has this idea appeared and it\nturns out that plato had this insight\nright so ancient greek wisdom was\nyou know what the person that we want to\nelect to a leadership role is the one\nwho was\nvery hesitant to be in charge and then\ndouglas adams wrote about it in the\nhitchhiker's guide to the galaxy\nright that the only person we should\nwant as a president is the one who had\nno interest in doing the job\nand that's that's one of those moments\nwhere the venn diagram comes together\nand you say okay\nif one of the great ancient greek\nphilosophers one of the great modern\nbritish sci-fi writers\nand empirical evidence are converging\nthere might be something here\nyeah yeah i love those examples i'm so\nglad you shared those\nuh because that is it's such a\nrefreshing way of thinking i think we\nalways\nbelieve that the person who should get\nit is the person who puts themselves\nforward the person who's\nconfident about it it's you know it has\nthat kind of\nself-belief that they were meant to be\nthat person\nand i'm guessing there's truth in that\ntoo sometimes\nthe the best athletes in the field are\npeople who believe that they were going\nto be the best athletes\nof all time but at the same time when\nyou look at leadership and business and\neven spiritual traditions i mean that's\nvery true of\nthat's very true of monk culture and and\nlooking at spiritual\nrankings that the person who went on to\nbe the the master\nthe master teacher would rarely be the\nperson who thought they were the master\nteacher it would always be\nalmost like humility was the the key to\nthe door of of that person not feeling\nthey were worthy\nallowed them to be the best and caring\nleader wow\nwe could use a lot more of that humility\nin the world right now i think a lot of\npeople write it off\nand they misunderstand humility as\nhaving low self-esteem\nor having just a low opinion of yourself\nand if you go back to the latin root of\nhumility it's actually being grounded\nit means from the earth right and so\nhumility is about recognizing hey we're\nall human\nwe're fallible we're flawed we have\nlimitations and weaknesses\nand i think if you see it that way it\nbecomes a source of strength because if\nyou can see your weaknesses more clearly\nthen you can figure out how to overcome\nthem what we reward we repeat\nand so we're seeing people always\nrewarded\nfor not being vulnerable or not being\nhonest and transparent and\nyou know i remember looking at some you\nknow basic studies on\nuh how men and women approach um\njob specifications and job descriptions\nand it was showing how\nwomen look at a job description be like\noh i can only do 25\nof that and whereas a man would look and\nbe like oh i can do over 50\nof that and so it's like they feel\nconfident based on what they can do\nwhereas a woman may not and so what i\nwas finding fascinating about that the\noveramplification in one's beliefs is\nalmost rewarded in a job interview uh\nhow do you start to reconstruct that\nforeign and even me as an employer and\nyou work with some of the biggest\nemployers in the on the planet\nhow do you reconstruct that in a healthy\nway so that\nit's you are hiring the right person\neventually because\nthere's there's a bit of that there's a\nbit of a dichotomy there\nthere is i i think the place i would\nstart is to say we've got to stop\nconfusing confidence\nfor competence right the fact that\nsomebody believes they can do something\nis not a good proxy for their actual\nability to do it\nand in fact you're familiar with the\ndunning-kruger effect in psychology\nthe finding is that the people who have\nthe lowest emotional intelligence scores\nand also the poorest logiological\nreasoning abilities\nare the most likely to overestimate\ntheir abilities\nand you could just say okay some of\nthat's ego but some of it is also\nif you have no idea what emotional\nintelligence looks like then it's really\nhard for you to judge whether you have\nit or not\nright and the same thing is true for\nlogical reasoning skills\nand i think in a job interview context\nthe place i like to start is to ask\npeople to\nto demonstrate what they're bringing to\nthe table right i'll give them a try out\ni'll let them do a little bit of an\nexperiment\nto show me their skills i also though\nhave started betting on people who\nunderestimate themselves a little bit\nthere was uh there was a great study at\ngoogle a few years back of engineers\nand this this speaks to the gender\ndifferences you were just highlighting\nit turned out that when you looked at\nself ratings of of how great you are as\nan engineer\non a one to five scale in order for\nwomen to make it at google they had to\ngive themselves a five\nthey had to have this unassailable\nconfidence to say look i know i'm one of\nthe best engineers in the world\notherwise they were just constantly\nfeeling discouraged and\nprobably facing more gender bias than\nthan anybody should\nthe most successful male engineers gave\nthemselves a four\nnot a five the fives were arrogant like\ni'm the best\nand they closed their minds to learning\nand i think i think the fours were like\nthe experts that you and i would both\nadmire\nthey didn't boast about how much they\nknew they were constantly marveling\nat how much more they had to learn and i\ni would love to live in a world where\neverybody who self rates as a four\nis more successful and i think we have a\nlot of work to do there to\nto remove some of those barriers that\nwomen face absolutely and\ni'm really glad you shared that with me\nin a small way i i found even with my\nown teams\nwe always did a self-assessment and then\nuh a\nmanager assessment of of the individual\nand i always found that\ni always rated people higher the people\nthat i rated higher and they rated\nthemselves lower\nwere always my top performers so i\nactually saw them as better than they\nsaw themselves\nand and that was such a beautiful thing\nwhere i'm like well i think your score\nis like\n45 out of 50 and they're like i see\nmyself as like a 38 and i'm like what\nlike that's amazing\nyou're hired yeah and and then the\nopposite was true also where i saw\npeople as like a 38 or a 35\nand they saw themselves as a 50 and i\nwas just like okay well this there's\nsomething wrong here\nand and you're so right about that we\ncould probably add a few other\nexplanations to that puzzle\none is angela duckworth has shown with\ngrit\nthat the grittiest people often rate\nthemselves more in the four range than\nthe five range\nbecause they have much higher standards\nfor what counts as having real passion\nand perseverance and they never feel\nlike they've made it\nyeah and then another factor is we had\nanother student besima who's now an mit\nprofessor\nand she studied how often people have\nimpostor thoughts\nfeeling like you know other people might\nfind out that i'm a fraud\nthat i'm not as good as you know as they\nthink i am that i don't deserve my\nsuccesses\nand a lot of people see if you had incr\nchronic imposter syndrome\nthey see that as debilitating and it can\nbe if you're just plagued by those\ndoubts\nbut the more ordinary imposter thoughts\nthat we all feel occasionally you know\ngee i wonder if i'm good enough or i\nwonder if i've lost it\nand i'm no longer at my peak people who\nhad those thoughts more often\nactually were motivated to perform\nbetter they didn't get complacent\nthey didn't fall victim to what's often\ncalled a fat cat syndrome\nthey said you know what i might not be\nthat good\ni've got to work that much harder i've\ngot to learn that much more in order to\nmake it\nand that's why i know you talk about\nthis that imposter syndrome actually has\nsome benefits\nlike it can actually be used and i feel\nlike now\nwhen we feel impostor syndrome we often\nthink of like i don't want to feel that\nway anymore\nsomeone i'd love for you to talk a bit\nmore about more of the benefits of\nimposter syndrome i think that could\nreally benefit\nour community because that's been a\nreally hot topic an important topic for\nus\ni know for me imposter syndrome has\nalways showed me my skills gap\nso so i've never seen imposter syndrome\nas a identity issue\nor uh issue of like my self-confidence\nor esteem it\nshowed me a skills gap so if i feel\ni don't know how to it was it was the\nfirst time i think i sat at a table\nwith investors or whatever it was and i\nwas like oh i've never invested i don't\nknow what this means like\nyou know and all of a sudden you feel\nthis sense of imposter syndrome\nand and i realized it was just a skills\ngap every time and i love using it as a\nsignal\nof asking myself is that a skill i want\nto learn and sometimes it's like no i\ndon't care\nand sometimes it's like yeah i'd love to\nlearn that so tell us a bit more about\nthe benefits of imposter syndrome\ni think you just framed that so\nbeautifully and i think it probably\ncalls to mind a caveat before we go into\nhow did how to build on that which is\nthe response you're describing\nbesema finds is more common for men than\nwomen when men experience those imposter\nthoughts\nwe've had the often the luxury of going\nthrough our lives with other people\nassuming that we were competent\nright so people hear you speak and they\nhear how eloquent you are\nand they say you know what this guy\nclearly knows what he's doing\nand so it doesn't end up really crushing\nyour motivation\nwhen you question yourself whereas i\nthink in a lot of places women\nyou know especially if they've been\nraised in a male dominated world or\na less egalitarian or more paternalistic\nculture\nare more likely to to have these ongoing\nfears\nabout well am i worthy do people really\nthink i can make it\nand they haven't had these constant\njolts of confidence that that maybe even\nwere unearned in a lot of cases\nand so it's that response is rarer among\nwomen than men\nbut we see it across the board with all\ngenders\nand i think the the starting point is to\nsay look there is a difference between\ndoubting yourself\nand doubting your skills and that's why\ni love how you described your skills gap\nright you're never saying i think i'm an\nidiot or i think i'm completely\nincapable of being a good entrepreneur\nor a great investor or a successful\ncontent creator you're just saying\ni don't know if i'm there yet i think i\nhave work to do i have knowledge to pick\nup i have expertise to gain\nand i think what that is is basically\njust having confidence in yourself as a\nlearner as opposed to\nas an expert or a master i love what you\njust said the idea of having confidence\nin yourself as a learner\nand you develop that when you learn how\nto learn\nthings like it's almost like that\nfeeling of like i know that if i\nwanted to i could learn this how do we\ndevelop the ability to\nlearn because i and unlearn of course is\npart of that because\ni feel like that's what's missing we did\nwe don't believe that even if we had the\ntime and even if we made the effort that\nwe'd quite\nget there because we've never been\ntaught how to learn\nwe've never been taught how to pick\nsomething up and roll with it\nuh where do you start in that process\nwell in the growth\nmindset research there's a simple\nexercise that really seems to help\npeople and it's one that i've used in\nsome of my own experiments\nand been surprised by how effective it\nis what you ask people to do is just\nreflect on a time when they started out\nterrible at something\nand then got halfway decent or even good\nand you say look you know what you've\nbeen learning your whole life whether\nyou realize it or not\nand if you analyze some of your own\nmoments of progress and improvement\nyou're probably going to pick up\npatterns and so in some cases what\npeople notice then\nis okay i learned through observation\nand\nyou know i was i had a role model that i\nwas able to watch closely or\ni found the right videos on youtube and\ni was able to pick this up\nother people will say you know what\nthose the pattern behind my moments of\ngrowth\nis i had a coach who was in my corner\nand who saw more potential in me than i\nsaw on myself\nand so now i need to find that person to\nto raise my aspirations\nand then for other people it's as simple\nas saying you know what\nwhen i learned best when i was most\nmotivated to grow was when i\ni had a curiosity gap i really wanted to\nunderstand something\nand it almost hurt i wanted to scratch\nthat itch so badly\nand i couldn't stop myself from then\ngoing and digging deeply into that\nphenomenon\nand i think there's obviously there are\ndozens and probably hundreds and\nthousands of possible stories that come\nout that way but\ni think reflecting on your own moments\nof learning is probably the best way to\nfigure out\nwhere your confidence in learning should\ncome from yeah for sure because it could\ngo back is\ni i remember like if someone asked me\nwhat was the first time i felt like i\nwas learning something i was\nprobably in grade four i had the best\nteacher of all time i'll never for his\nname was mr foxwell and i'll never\nforget him because it was\nhe just made learning so fun and i was\nprobably like what i don't know eight\nnine years old maybe and so you know\nsuper young and\nnot necessarily thinking about being a\nlearner or thinking i'd be sitting\ntalking to you about learning but\ni remember that really strongly and i\nremember it was being with someone\nwho made learning so infectious and\nnow if i think back to anything that\ni've learned in my life\ncoaching has been the number one part of\nit like being around someone who\nis energy is contagious and infectious\nbecause they\nlove this thing so much whatever it may\nbe and i think that's what it's been i\nhaven't just been around\nexperts i've been people who re i've\nbeen around lucky to be around people\nwho love what they did and were very\ncompassionate with it\nand i think those two qualities are so\nbeautiful because\nwhen you learn just from an expert it's\ndifferent from learning from a\ncompassionate expert like that has\nsome very special pass-ons i feel so\nthere's a classic study by benjamin\nbloom\nwhere he looked at people who had been a\nlead across a lot of different fields\nhe looked at olympic swimmers\nworld-class tennis players\nscientists musicians chess players and\nhe wanted to know what in their\nupbringing was common\nand he found that they were rarely the\nmost talented in even even in their city\nwhen they were in you know when they\nwere 12 13 years old\nbut one of the distinguishing factors\nthat set them apart from their peers\nwas they had a first teacher or a first\ncoach who made learning fun\nwhich is exactly what you're getting at\nwhere you know all the deliberate\npractice\nall the hard work that a lot of people\nwould say you know what it's a grind\nit's not going to be pleasant they they\nactually learned to experience that as\nrewarding and that motivated them to\nkeep going and it sounds like you had\nthat experience too\ni'm curious what did what did mr foxwell\ndo that made learning so fun\ni think he was one of the first people\nthat that introduced a lot of games\nat school as part of the learning\nprocess so i can't remember what we're\nlearning in grade four but the idea of\neverything was gamified i didn't know\nwhat that word was then but it was\nit was this opportunity where everything\nwas uh everything was play\ni think that was a big part of it he was\nalso extremely animated and charismatic\nand he would\nhe was providing a lot of energy in what\nhe was sharing and teaching\nuh and and i'd say at the same time he\nwas able to change the classroom he was\none of the first teachers we had that\nwould and this is you know i'm talking\nabout\nif we're talking about like 25 years ago\nhe was taking classrooms outdoors\nhe was you know taking the class in the\nplayground he was taking on the lawn\nhe wasn't trying to keep us cooped up in\nthis uh in this building and so i felt\nlike he was\nhe was quite a visionary for you know a\nsmall class in\na small suburb in london like he was he\nwas really taking risks and\ntrying new things i guess he sounds a\nlot like\nthis incredible teacher that i got to\nknow while i was working on think again\nron berger\nuh ron of of all the teachers i've met\nsince since i finished school he's\nprobably the person i most regret not\ngetting to be in a classroom with\nuh he for years taught in rural\nmassachusetts uh in a tiny town where\ntoday\nhis uh his nurse and his firefighter\nand his plumber are all his former\nstudents and\nron was interested in teaching students\nan ethic of excellence and\nhe's sort of a he's a do it yourself\nkind of guy he's very crafty\nand he decided that he was going to do\nexactly what mr foxwell did which was\nhe would take students out into the\nworld to learn and so when they were\ntrying to learn about\nabout gas and radon they actually went\nand did measurements\nin local communities when they were\ntrying to understand scientific\nclassification and taxonomies of animals\nhe had the students come up with their\nown taxonomies\nand you know some people sorted animals\nby size\nothers did it by whether they had sharp\nteeth others did it by color\nor habitat and they realized oh they're\nall these interesting choices that\nscientists make and\nthose are always open to being rethought\nmy favorite round burger practice\nis teaching students to recognize that\nrethinking and revising your work\nis actually an enjoyable opportunity as\nopposed to a chore\nand what he would do is he would send\nfirst graders even off to draw a house\nand then instead of saying draw a house\nhe says we're gonna do four different\nversions\nof a house and they they accept that\ntheir first draft is just a work in\nprogress\nand a lot of people told him don't do\nthis because you're gonna\nyou're gonna leave students frustrated\nthey're gonna get discouraged very\neasily how many first graders want to do\nthe same drawing four times and he said\nyou have no idea\nafter they do the first draft they can\nsee problems in their drawings\nand they are so excited to rethink them\nand refine them\nand his students will often then after\nthat experience\ninsist on doing seven or eight different\ndrafts before they turn something in\nand i was just blown away by this and i\ni had our kids try it\nand our uh our nine-year-old daughter\nand our six-year-old son were working on\nsome art and i said okay you know what\nyou can draw whatever you want and then\nwe're gonna try a second and a third\nand they just lit up and then the next\nday they said i'm gonna do a few\ndifferent drafts\nand i don't want you to frame the first\none and i think teaching that joy of\nrethinking is something we should all be\nlucky\nto be part of yeah because the truth is\nmost of us get it right\non after a couple of goes anyway and the\nidea that you had to get it right the\nfirst time\nis actually what's that's actually\nwhat's created this whole issue is\nwe've been trained to believe you had to\nget it right the first time and that was\nthe\nonly way that you got the reward and\nthen you got the mark and\nyou're reminding me actually of of my\nart teacher so i loved\nart at uh at high school\nand i was always very good at\ngraphic design and and digital and\ndigital art or\nuh collages as opposed to fine art i'm i\ncan i'm terrible at painting\nuh but but i i had that and my\nteacher would always always ask me\nwhy i did that like why i put that color\nnext to that color or why i put this\nimage next to this image\nand if i couldn't explain to him\ncoherently\nwhy i did that he wouldn't want to grade\nthat piece\nso he wouldn't give me a bad grade he\nwould just delay the grade\nuntil i could explain to him or come up\nwith a real reason for why it was done\nand it's so fascinating that when i\nthink about where did i develop\nthe mindset to act intentionally it all\ncame from him saying to me\nwhy did you do that why did you do that\nwhy did you do that and the idea of\nhaving to explain it and rethink why i\ndid it\nwas the only way that he was satisfied\nas opposed to how it looked or how it\nappeared\nthat's very powerful and i i'm wondering\nif part of what happens then\nis you know he's going to ask you and so\nyou actually think through your choices\nup front the next time\nyeah and then he would still do it he\nwould ask about he would ask about a\npart that i would and it would annoy me\nlike i would be really frustrated\nbecause\nsomeone else in the class would get a\ngood grade and you know mine would be\ndelayed grading and whatever and i'd be\nlike well mine looks better and you know\nyou'd have all those thoughts\nand he was he would just keep\nchallenging me and i think that was such\na\nit was such an important important piece\nof\nteaching that i you know that that has\nstayed with me for so long but\ni wanted to move forward in a few other\ntopics that you talk about in the book\none of the big ones you talk about is\nuh charged conflicted\ndebate level conversations and these\nexist in the workplace they exist at\nhome\nwhen i think about this i think about\nrelationships and marriage\nand in families where we constantly\nargue and i think that's one of the\nplaces where we do the least\nunlearning because we have such strong\nviews about our family and our\nupbringing versus our partners or\nother people in our family that it's so\nhard to let go of it tell us a bit about\nwhat you learned about these about\ndepolarizing a\ncharged conversation or a debate where\nyou just keep arguing the same point\nevery week\nwhich is very common yeah this uh\nthis i feel like this is happening\neverywhere now and the world has just\ngotten more polarized\nuh one of one of the funnier studies i\ncame across\nuh during the research for the book was\nthat a third of women\nsaid that their pets were better\nlisteners than their partners\nthat's brilliant i mean i guess all your\npet can really do is listen so\nmaybe i don't know our cat has an\nadvantage right because she can't talk\nback\nbut i think we talk a lot about the\nimportance of listening\ni don't think that we actually really\nbuild\nskills in how to do it well my favorite\nmy favorite approach to listening that i\ni came across is this idea called\nmotivational interviewing\ncomes out of counseling psychology and\nthe premise is\nthat it's very hard to change somebody\nelse's mind but\nit's more likely that you could help\nthem find their own motivation\nto change their mind and what that means\nis let's say\nyou know you've got an uncle who you\nthink has a really hateful set of\nbeliefs\ninstead of telling him here's what you\nshould believe and prosecuting him for\nbeing wrong and preaching about why\nyou're right\nwhat you should do is say you know i i\nwas really interested in how you landed\nat this set of views\nand i was curious about you know what\nthe pros are of having that viewpoint if\nyou've ever experienced any negative\nconsequences\nof that and can you just walk me through\nthat because i i actually don't\nunderstand your perspective that well\nand then you listen and what most people\ndo when they're asked to talk about the\npros and cons of some stance they have\nis they'll give you a little bit of both\nand then your job is to hold up a mirror\nand help them see that they might be a\nlittle more ambivalent\nthan they thought that there's more\nnuance in their own views than they saw\nbefore\nand then you might just elaborate on\nthere are two kinds of talk that you\nhear here um\nthis one is called sustain talk which is\nbasically a bunch of reasons why they\nwould they would stick with the status\nquo\nchange talk is here are some rationales\nfor my\nwhy i might want to make a shift in my\nbeliefs or my behaviors\nand when you hear change talk the\nrecommendation is not to manipulate\npeople not to try to influence them but\nto say you know it actually sounds like\nyou've you've considered revisiting this\nview\ni was curious you know what do you think\nwould be the consequences of of making a\nshift\nand what if you wanted to do that what\nmight your plan look like\nand i've tried this in a bunch of\nconversations recently and it is\nshocking\nhow much less friction it creates and\nhow much more openness not only the\nother person brings\nbut how much openness it creates in me\nbecause i'm not here to give you answers\ni am here to learn from you and i guess\nthat's part of the scientists or scholar\nmindset in action yeah yeah i i i\ni completely value that because i feel\nthat that's what where you become a\nmediator in your own conversation\nyes and and you become an observer in\nyour own conversation of\nrather than looking at it as like this\nis my ego versus this person's ego\nand and you talk a bit about i wanted\nyou to mention this because i love this\nuh you talk a bit about how it's better\nto bring up only one or two reasons for\nyour viewpoint in a debate\nrather than providing a lot of reasons\ntell us about that because\nwe often think like we have to reel off\n10 reasons why this person's wrong\nbut actually you're telling us to limit\nthat tell us a bit about that\nyeah i'm tempted to pile on too many\nstudies to support this point which\ni'll try to avoid but i will say uh\nstudies of expert negotiators compared\nto average negotiators\nshow that the experts use fewer reasons\non average\nbecause they're afraid of deluding their\nargument and they know\nlook jay if i give you nine reasons why\nmy proposal is fair and compelling\nand you don't like it then you're just\ngonna pick the least compelling reason\nand ignore the other eight\ni just give you my one or two strongest\nreasons you're a lot more likely than to\ntake them seriously\nand i think the number of reasons\nobviously matters there's also the\nquestion of how the reasons fit together\nand i'd done an experiment at a\nuniversity a while back where we were\ntrying to get\nnon-donors who'd never given a cent in\ntheir lives to their\nalma mater to think about making a small\ngift\nand we sent them letters and the big\ntest was is it better to appeal to the\nmore\negoistic or the more altruistic reasons\nfor giving\nso some people are told look alumni say\ngiving feels good\nothers are told alumni really appreciate\nthe opportunity to do good\nthrough giving and we found that both\nreasons were equally effective\nwe were able to get over over six\npercent of alums who had never given\noften in 30 40 50 years to\nwrite a check which was exciting then we\nsaid all right\ntwo reasons are better than one let's\nput them together and the giving rate\ndropped in half wow\nthere was a little bit of a conflict\nbetween hey this is going to make you\nfeel good\nand hey this is going to do good and\nhelp a lot of people and when we gave\nthese conflicting\nor sort of mixed reasons people were\nmore likely to realize that a persuasive\nattempt was happening\nand they put their guard up and they\nsaid wait a minute you can't influence\nme\nand i think that that just strengthens\nthe case to say look you want to be\ncareful not to dilute your argument\nyou also want to make sure there's some\nclarity and consistency in the\nperspective you're bringing to the table\ni love that and and i would say that for\nanyone who's listening or watching\nthat's a great takeaway\nbecause i feel like when we're trying to\ncreate change we try and give way too\nmany reasons and way too many\nideas and options and and actually when\nyou really believe something's an issue\nand there's a challenge and you just\nspeak about it\nwith passion and empathy and you focus\nin\nthe other person actually gets more\nclarity so i often find like when you're\ntalking to someone\nthe reason it's hard for them to listen\nis because you're making it harder for\nthem to listen by\nby speaking about far too many things\nwhen actually most of our minds can't\nfocus on more than three things i guess\nthat\nbringing up any more than the two or\nthree you suggested\njust goes over people's heads and they\ndon't actually understand what you're\ntrying to say\nyeah it's it's amazing how many times i\nhave to relearn that you cannot bully\npeople into agreeing with you\nthey'll either fight or they'll choose\nflight and i think\nif if you've if you have to watch out\nfor preacher mode\nmy my biggest challenge is prosecutor\nmode i think\nthat there's just there's something\nabout my personality my values and also\nmy training as a social scientist\nthat says if somebody believes something\nthat's inconsistent with rigorous\nevidence\ni feel like it's my responsibility to\ntry to correct their view\nyeah and i can't remember the last time\nthat went well\nyeah yeah absolutely\nwell that's why those those three the\npreacher the prosecutor and the\npolitician are such great reminders\nuh anytime we feel we've got one of\nthose hats on we can we can\npolitely take it off and and go back to\nbeing the scientist and\nand that's the one that gives you so\nmuch joy in the long term you learn more\nabout your partner you learn more about\nyour colleagues you\nyou learn more about and when you learn\nmore about someone you know how to\napproach them every time\nand whereas when you don't learn about\nthem you approach them in the same way\nevery time and\nyou get the same result i think there's\nthere's so much truth to that and in\nfact i've i've seen it recently in that\ni've started telling people that you\nknow i've i've increasingly noticed\nmyself\nthis is a great example of\nself-persuasion right i wrote a whole\nbook about how\nwe need to watch out for slipping into\nthese other mindsets and\ni have a habit of going into prosecutor\nmode when i'm exploring ideas\nand if somebody believes one thing the\nway that i i really try to understand it\nis i argue the exact opposite\nand i know that drives people crazy\nsometimes so i started telling people\nyou know\ni occasionally and and then i have to\nstop and say okay more often than not\nwhen i'm in a disagreement i become a\nprosecutor\nand if you ever catch me doing that\nplease feel free to call me out\nand i've had people do it i've also had\nsome early readers of the book now\nsay hey you know that uh that lawyer\nthing that you wrote about you're doing\nit right now\nit's a great it's a great sort of check\nyourself moment to say okay\ni just caught a glimpse of my reflection\nin the mirror i do not like the person\nwho's staring back at me right now\nthat's not who i want to be i love that\nadam adam we end\nevery episode of on purpose as you know\nwith\na segment called the final five which\nyou have to answer in one word to one\nsentence\nmaximum uh this is\nyour final five are you ready i'm ready\nlet's start with this question\nuh what's something you wish you had\nrethought\nearlier i wish i had rethought my\ndecision not to study abroad in college\ni wish i had studied abroad in college\nokay\nbut yeah yeah that's clear because you\nrethought it and therefore you didn't go\ni sorry i to be to be actually clear\nthis time\ni decided not to study abroad and i wish\ni had rethought that\nyeah okay interesting why tell us i'd\nlove to hear that one\ni think i i felt extraordinarily\nfortunate to get into harvard\nand i had a massive case of fomo before\ni even knew that there was such a thing\nas a fear of missing out\nhow could you take a semester away from\nthis incredible learning opportunity\nand it just it seemed like i would be\ngiving up too much and of course what i\ndidn't see\nwas all the things i gave up by not\nimmersing myself in a new culture\nand a different education education\nsystem and\na set of norms and values that might\nhave been pretty foreign to me\nwhat's the time when you rethought\nsomething\nwhere you realized your original thought\nwas actually right\nuh i\nactually the title for think again oh\nthere's an example on this\ni the title clicked for me one day think\nagain the power of knowing what you\ndon't know\ni love it that's the book i want to\nwrite and then\ni gave an early draft to my challenge\nnetwork\nuh the group of readers who who brought\na lot of criticism\nand some of them said well don't you\nwant a different title like what if what\nif the book was called\ni might be wrong or unlearning and i\nrethought it a bunch\nand i said well i'm actually pretty\nexcited about those titles and i think\nthey're really novel\nand compelling and every time i\nexplained the book to people\nthere was just something sticky about\nsaying you know what whatever you think\nabout that you might want to think again\nand i realize that's a phrase i use all\nthe time and it captures something that\ni stand for\nand i couldn't let it go i love it i i\nlove think again i think it's a great\ntitle and uh\nit's interesting i went through the same\nthing with think like a monk so i i had\npretty much every publisher an imprint\nthat i went to meet tell me they didn't\nthink the book should be called think\nlike a monk\nare you serious that is one of the best\nbook titles i've ever seen\nno seriously honestly and i was so\ninsecure about it for a long time but\neven up until the day before we launched\nit because\ni'd heard that from like i met 17\nimprints and i heard\nthat from like 14 to 15 of the imprints\nuh\nthat they believe that we should change\nthe title they were just like well jay\nwho wants to be a monk\nuh what does a monk mean to people and i\nand i was struggling with\nalternatives because this was the only\ntrue thing that the book was trying to\ndo\nyeah and and i felt was was\nmy unique offering in the world that i'm\ni'm trying to you know pass along\nand so it's so hard and and you know i\ni'm glad that we stuck with it\nuh but i've rethought it a million times\nyou know so it was\nit was very i was very scared up until\nlike the day we got\nlike results in and all the last rest of\nit i was so scared\nwell it sounds like the imprints you met\nyou met with were not your target\naudience\nbut i i actually think it's an ingenious\ntitle for\nthe exact reason that they're\nhighlighting which is\ni don't think most people want to be\nmonks but we all\naspire to have the wisdom and also the\nequanimity\nthat that you model and so the idea that\ni could even if i\ni don't have the patience or the\ndiscipline to\nimmerse myself in a spiritual tradition\nlike that that i could learn to think\nmore like one\nthat's that's right at my fingertips\nright yeah well you're my target\nadam you're always gonna be my target\nfrom now on\nno i love that title i think that\nanybody who told you to rethink it\nclearly should rethink their role in\ntitling books\ni love that well thank you thank you for\nthat all right question number three\nwe've been spending so long on these\nit's great but i love it sorry uh\nno no no it's great question number\nthree is what's the worst piece of\nadvice you've ever received\nthe worst piece of advice that i ever\nreceived was\nnot to give credit to undergraduate\nco-authors\non a paper i was writing because they\nwere just research assistants and\neveryone has them wow\ninteresting that's a great one thank you\nfor sharing that what's the worst piece\nof advice you've ever given someone\nthe worst piece of advice i've ever\ngiven someone\nis probably don't go back to school ah\ninteresting okay i i should talk to you\nabout that i've been thinking of going\nback to school\nso it's interesting for what that's a\nbig question which i could go into all\nthe\nthere's like three different areas that\ni'm fascinated by and i think i don't\nknow enough\nagain i don't know enough about what i\nwould end up studying if i end up\nchoosing any of the three\num you know broad terms neurosciences is\ndefinitely one of them i'm i'm\nfascinated\nby my passion's always been to find the\nthe juxtaposition or the intersection\nbetween timeless wisdom and\nmodern science and so for me i'm always\ntrying to find like i love reading\nstudies about how meditation impacts the\nbrain how a lot of my old monk practices\naffect the brain and so\nneuroscience is definitely one of the\nbig ones i'm i'm\nbehavioral economic economics books have\njust been my\nmy passion forever and so anything\naround\nhuman behavior but but wanting to know\nwhat to study so i'm still exploring it\nbut it\ni shared it with you prematurely but\nit's definitely been something i've been\nconsidering so it's good to hear you say\nthat so i like that\ni like that a lot uh this is a longer\nconversation but when you have a moment\nlook up a colleague of mine named\nmichael platt\nokay he's uh he's an economic\nneuroscientist\nand he basically he uses brain imaging\nto understand behavioral economics\noh wow there are a few others like him\nand i wonder if that's a\nsynthesis of your interests oh that's\ngreat well thank you for sharing i will\ndefinitely pick your brain properly when\nwhen please do\ni look forward to that i thank you so\nmuch i really appreciate that and and\nfifth and final question\nuh what is something that you don't know\nabout yet that you're fascinated to\nlearn about\nthis is such a long list i think\none one thing that is just a total i'll\ngive you a macro and a micro one\nand you can pick on the micro side i\nreally want to know\nwhy it is that you can't tickle yourself\nthat's genius i i everyone's trying it\nright now at home right like everyone's\nthey're all i've i've i've asked\nneuroscientists i've run google searches\ncannot get to the bottom of this one so\nthat's the next book tickle\ntickle something yeah maybe the best\ni'm not sure i'm the person to write\nthat book but i definitely want to read\nit the the best answer i heard was\nwell you can't surprise yourself and you\nknow if you go to tickle yourself your\nbrain already knows it's going to happen\nwow it took me about four seconds to\ndebunk that because i said you know what\njay i'm going to tickle you right now\ndid you still laugh\nyou would have right and so even if you\nknow it's coming\ndoesn't seem to matter yeah anyway\nthat's one thing i would love to\nunderstand better\nshould we do a macro one two yeah tell\nus macro too i love that that's a great\nanswer there\nit's fun bigger picture i think one of\nthe things i'm curious about\nis how we how we can establish\nsome common ground across very partisan\ndivides\nfor example you know take any political\nleader that you think is great or\nterrible today\nthe moment that you try to point out\nflaws in their character\nor shortcomings in their competence\npeople accuse you of being partisan\nyeah and i would like to have an\nindependent standard where we say look\nthis is what we mean by leadership skill\nthis is how we judge values so that we\ncould try to get on the same page\ni love that and i hope you're going to\ncreate what that is\nand and then we start using that i think\nthat's such a\nnot just noble approach but but it's\nwhat's needed right now the\nthe idea to look at things objectively\nwithout sentimentality without\nattachment without you know to be really\napproach something and go\nwell what is best for everyone uh and\nand to approach conversations like that\nin that in in a way\ndriven through data but but also through\nintuition that would be amazing so i\nthink it would be fun\nwe need to ask you jay before we wrap\nyeah one thing that i'm adding to my\nlist as i\nas i do the the book tour is i would\nlove to know something you think that i\nshould be rethinking\noh okay that's that's that's fascinating\nuh what do i think you should be\nrethinking\nthis is hard do you know why this is\nhard because i agree with you on so many\nthings\nwell that's a mistake yeah that's you\nneed to rethink it's like i've read\ni've read all your books and like i i\nfind them\nso fascinating and i agree with you and\nso much stuff i i think\ni don't know this is interesting and\nit's because i don't know this about you\nso\nso you may this may open up a whole\nother conversation\nbecause you're so open to so many things\ni would love to know\nhow open or how much you've allowed\nspiritual thought to match your\nscientist mind into your life because\ni think someone who's as open as you and\nmaybe you already have and you're like\nyeah i've already done that and that's\nwhy you are who you are but\nit would i would i would be fascinated\nbecause i just think that your\ni think your thoughts are already so\nspiritually evolved and if that's what\nyou've got\nfrom studying organizational psychology\nand behavior then i'm fascinated to see\nwhat you'll go on to achieve\nwith with that added to it so yeah that\nwould be my\nmy addition and thank you for asking\nit's a it's a it's a gaping hole\nin my learning in my and my really in my\ntraining too\nright which is anytime i came across\nspiritual ideas\ni would either you know look for\nevidence or i would say well how do you\nknow\nand it's only more recently that i've\nrecognized how many of the fundamental\nprinciples of psychology that have\nresonated with me\ndo have these roots and very ancient\nreligious traditions\nin philosophical wisdom and i think i\nhave a lot to learn on that front no i\nlove that you're you're extremely uh\nhumble modest and and kind and so i love\nall the time we ever get to spend\ntogether adam i i recommend to everyone\nto please go and grab a copy of the book\nthink again you will not regret it i i\ndo believe that it's\na skill that everyone needs right now\nand we need desperately in our\ncareers relationships family the world\nyou know leaders\nuh it's such a big need and i'm so glad\nthat you're uh helping us think again so\nadam thank you so much is there anything\nelse you want to share that you're like\njay i have to share this and you haven't\nlet me share it\ni'm open to that so no jay this has just\nbeen such a thrill\ni i will say since you raised the\npolitician prosecutor preacher\nscientists\ni put together a little questionnaire\nthat people could take to figure out\nwhere they stand and which of those\nmodes they fall into most often so\nif anybody wants to take it it's just at\nadamgrant.net\noh i love that yeah definitely i i love\nfinding out more about myself so that\nthat's great adamgrant.net\nif you want to go and figure out which\nof the prosecutor\npreacher politician or scientist you are\nso please go and\nwe'll put that in the show notes as well\nadam thank you so much for tuning in\nuh and and so grateful to spend this\ntime with you as always and\nexcited for lunch or dinner next time i\ncan't wait thank you so much for having\nme\nthank you so much if you want even more\nvideos just like this one make sure you\nsubscribe and
