    "transcript": "having treated many drug addicts through\nthe years is the drug\naddicts tell you initially the drugs\nmade them feel awesome and then they\nused the drugs\nto prevent the depression so just so\nthey would attempt\nyeah to feel normal but then you know\nthe addiction cycle\nkicked in and they were hot\nyou know how passionate i am about\nsitting down with\ndeep deep experts people who can broaden\nand open\nmy mind and yours people that can teach\nme things that i've never thought about\nand that i can share with you as well\nand today's guest will definitely not\ndisappoint\nhe's a clinical neuroscientist a\nprofessor\na psychotherapist and he's a 10 times\nnew york times best-selling author his\nname\nis dr daniel g ehman and today we're\ntalking about his new book\nfeel better fast and make it last\nunlocking your brain's healing potential\nto overcome negativity anxiety anger\nstress\nand trauma so if you like the sound of\nwhat we're discussing today\nmake sure you go out onto amazon go to\nbarnes noble and grab\nthe book daniel thank you so much for\nbeing here jay it's just such a pleasure\nno the pleasure is all mine i was saying\nto you just briefly when i was speaking\nbefore that\nthis is what i crave in life is to sit\ndown with someone who has\ndedicated their life and work and their\npurpose\nto such a deep and noble cause and to be\nable to sit with you is a complete honor\nfor me so thank you for being here\nthank you thank you so much and yeah\nthis book when i was diving into it and\nthe conversation we've just had\ni instantly had so many questions\nbecause\nfor me the brain's the most important\nthing for us to talk about right now\nespecially right now and that's the\nquestion i wanted to start with\nyou with is why did you\nchoose the brain throughout all your\nwork as being such a big area of focus\nwell it runs everything um but when i\nwent to medical school\ni wanted to be a pediatrician because i\nadore\nchildren and when i was a\nsecond year medical student i'd just\ngotten married\nand my wife tried to kill herself\nand i was horrified and um i was\ntraumatized\nand i took her to see a wonderful\npsychiatrist\nand i came to realize if he helped her\nwhich he did\nit wouldn't just help her that it would\nhelp me\nit would help our children it would help\nour grandchildren\nand so nearly 40 years ago i decided to\nbe a psychiatrist\nand i have loved it every single day\nbut i joined the only medical profession\nthat never looks at the organ\nit treats and before i went to medical\nschool i was in the army i was an\ninfantry medic\nand i got myself retrained as an x-ray\ntechnician\nand developed a passion for imaging and\nour professors used to always say\nhow do you know unless you look how do\nyou know unless you look\nand now i'm a psychiatrist and we're not\nlooking\nand i'm an agitator my father\num growing up he called me a maverick\nand to him that was not a good thing\nbut i got it from him his favorite words\ngrowing up when i was growing up the\nfirst favorite word was [ __ ]\nand the second his favorite word was no\neverything was [ __ ] or no\nso obviously i got it from him and\nand i loved being a psychiatrist but i'm\nlike well why don't we look at the brain\nand because obviously the brain is our\norgan\nthe brain you know is involved in how\nyou think how you feel how you\nact how you get along with other people\nit's the organ of intelligence\ncreativity and every single decision\nyou make and with my x-ray background\ni'm like we should look\nand so in the late 1980s i started\nlooking at the brain with a study\ncalled called quantitative eeg\nand it was fascinating that i could see\nunderlying\npatterns for things like depression and\nadhd and autism but in 1991 i went to a\nlecture on brain\nspect imaging spect is a nuclear\nmedicine study\nthat looks at blood flow and activity\nand it rocked\nmy world um let me take a little detour\nplease\nso how do addictions start um let's say\ngambling addiction addictions start with\na big\nwin right either cocaine you're like\nwhoa i've never felt like that before i\nwant to feel like that again\nor with gambling you win the whole\njackpot\nand dopamine floods the pleasure centers\nof your brain and you're like oh\nwhoa i want that again well\ni'd been a psychiatrist for nearly 10\nyears when i ordered my first spec scan\nmy first 10 cases were big wins\nbecause i went into this profession to\nget people well\nbecause i knew the pain of\nwhen you're not well from a suicide\nattempt\nfrom my first wife and then the the\nlevel of\nemotional and personal pain that brought\nto me of course\num and so as patients got better\num because i had more information i'm\nlike i have to do this again\nwell today we have 150 000 scans that\nwe've done\non patients from 120 countries so i'm\ncompletely addicted\nbecause you know if you don't look\nyou don't know and we need to stop\nlying about that but wholesale across\nthe u.s really across the world you'll\ngo to your doctor you say i'm depressed\ni'm anxious i can't sleep i have temper\nproblems i'm obsessiveness\nand within a 20-minute office visit you\nleave with prescriptions\nfor anxiety depression sleep and that's\ninsane\nwhen no one has looked at your brain so\nyou don't know\ndoes it work too hard or not hard enough\nis it toxic\nfrom drug abuse or from mold in your\nhome\nor is it traumatic because you played a\ncontact sport\nand it damaged your frontal lobes and so\ni have been on this crusade really\nto change psychiatry because we should\nact like our other medical colleagues\nand look at what we do before we do it\nbut along the way i learned big lessons\nlike first do no harm that some of our\nmedications are actually not that great\nfor you that they're natural ways to\nheal the brain and oh by the way you got\nto get your heart rate\nyou got to get your gut right you got to\nget your kidneys right you got to get\nyour liver right\nin order for your brain to be right\nbecause when your brain works right\nyou work right absolutely no i couldn't\nagree with you more and it was actually\nfascinating just earlier this week i was\nspeaking to naveen jane on the podcast\nas well\nand i don't know if you've come across\nnaveen et cetera i should definitely\nconnect you both\nhe feels very closely with the way you\ndo around having a crusade around modern\nmedicine\nand what's supplied and how it's just\nprescribed to anyone and everyone\nwithout actually knowing anyone's gut\nbrain or any other health\nso i should definitely connect you\nyou've just sparked an idea but i want i\nwant to ask you before we dive into and\ni know everyone listening and watching\nyou're probably\nthinking like i am oh my god we cannot\nwait for this because you can give us so\nmany practical tips but before we do\nthat i want to ask you more of a\ni guess a conscious question around what\nis the difference between the brain and\nthe mind\nand and what are the mistakes we make\nwhen talking about the mind versus\nunderstanding the brain the mind\ncomes from the brain if your\nbrain is damaged it damages your\nmind and without a brain you don't\nhave a mind now\nyou can train the brain so that you have\na\nhealthier mind but let me just tell you\na story\nsince i know that's what you love is\nstories storytelling\num there was this couple\nthat were in marital therapy and they\nwent for three years\nspent about twenty thousand dollars and\nat the end\nthe therapists flunked them told them to\nget divorced\nand um they were very unhappy\nthat they had failed and so they got mad\nat the therapist and the therapist said\nwell i know a doctor\nin costa mesa california that takes care\nof really difficult\npeople you should go see him\nand you know as part of our process we\nscan people we do spect\nand the wife had a pretty healthy brain\nthe husband had a moth eaten brain\nit was really low in activity it's a\npattern we usually see\nwith alcoholism or drug abuse but in his\nhistory he said he never used drugs\nand he didn't drink now the first thing\nyou learn about drug addicts\nis they lie so in front of his wife\ni'm like well is that true you don't\ndrink and you've never done drugs\nand he said dr amon that's not my\nproblem i've never\ndrank and i've never done drugs and then\ni looked to his wife and i said\nis he telling me the truth and she said\noh yes dr amy he doesn't drink as far as\ni know he's never done drugs he's just\nan [ __ ]\ni started laughing can you imagine that\nbut in my head\ni'm like why does his brain look so bad\nand so\ni thought about what are the different\noptions\ndrugs alcohol well probably not if your\nwife who doesn't like you\nsays no um an environmental toxin\nanoxia lack of oxygen an infection\nsevere anemia or hormone disruptions\nand so my next question to him is where\ndo you work\nhe said i work in a furniture factory\ni said what do you do he said i finished\nfurniture all day long\nhe was doing drugs he was doing the\nworst drug of abuse\nwhich is inhaling organic solvents\nand i'm like do you wear a mask he said\nno they tell me i should\nand i'm thinking to myself i don't say\nit because i have good frontal lobe\nfunction i'm thinking that is not the\nsign of intelligent life\num i'm like is there ventilation he said\noften not it's hot i'm sweaty\nand i looked to his wife and i said so\nwhen did he become an [ __ ] and she\nsaid what do you mean\ni said did you marry him that way\ndo you have father issues you're trying\nto work out\nand she said no when we dated and for\nthe first three years\nhe was great it was about five years ago\nand then the light went on in her head\nabout the time\nhe got this job his behavior started\nto change do you think it could be\nrelated\nof course it could be related and\ni love this shift that's what the scans\ndo\nthey shift from he's an [ __ ]\nand actually his therapist gave him that\nsame diagnosis\nnow you can't write [ __ ] in the chart\nso what you write is\nmixed personality disorder with\nnarcissistic and anti-social features\nwhat's that you're an [ __ ] right it's\nyou can't it's not a billing code right\nand that shift was so\nimportant because play this out with me\nhe's angry\nhe's depressed he's so he's mad and he's\nsad\nif they did what the therapist\nrecommended which was get divorced\nnow it's going to be like his skin is\nbeing ripped off\nbecause this is the love of his life he\njust can't act in a consistent way what\nis the organ of acting it's your brain\nright and his brain is damaged and so if\nthey would have gotten divorced he very\nwell\ncould have killed himself and as many\npeople do he also could have killed his\nwife and his children\nright so this is the consequence of not\nlooking but once we looked she\nshifted and she's like do you mean\nin his attempt to be a good husband\ngoing to work supporting the family that\nhe's being\npoisoned and that he's sick and he's not\nbad\nexactly and so we took him out of work\nworked on rehabilitating his brain which\nis one of my\nfavorite things to do is taking bad\nbrains and making them\nbetter and years later they're still\nmarried\nthey love each other he's much better\nand she's not as stressed because when\nyou live\nwith someone whose brain is damaged\nyou become damaged as well\nabsolutely wow that's incredible so how\ni guess my my follow-up question\nthat is how many of us are living with\nsomeone\nwho has a damaged brain how many of us\nme sitting right here like how many of\nus have a brain that is\nsomewhat damaged and what are the\nmistakes we make when we're trying to\nheal that in our everyday life\nand and the first mistake we make is we\ndon't care about it\nthat we don't love it so when i started\ndoing spec in 1991 i scanned everybody i\nknew i scanned\nmy sisters have five of them pray for me\ni want you to scan and scan me one day\ni want to yeah i'd love that um i scan\nand then i scanned my mom\nand she had at 60 a perfect brain\nin fact she was our resident model of a\nperfect brain\nuh and she must have loved that it fit\nthe story of her life\neven at 87 she has 48 grandchildren\ngreat-grandchildren she knows\neverybody's birthday she's everybody's\nbest friend\nshe's just a phenomenal human being and\nthen i scanned my brain\nand i didn't like it because i played\nfootball in high school and i had\nmeningitis when i was a young\nsoldier and that just really pissed me\noff\nthat my 60 year old mother had a better\nlooking brain than i did\nand so i developed a concept then called\nbrain envy i wanted a better brain i\nwanted a brain that looked like\nhers and you know as a psychiatrist or\nas a trained psychiatrist you have to of\ncourse read freud\nand he had this concept of penis envy\nand in 40 years i've like not seen\none case the only time i've seen a case\nof it is when i was\non broadway a few weeks ago and at\nintermission i saw\nthe long line at the women's bathroom\nand no line at the men's\nand i go penis said me there it is right\nthere but\nyou know it's really the only organ\nwhere\nsize matters is your brain\nit's the three pounds of fat between\nyour\nears so the first thing you have to do\nif you want a better life is you have to\nstart\nwanting a better brain and\nthat is critical because\nthat leads i know you you want\nfor your listeners and viewers tips\num we call them tiny habits we work with\num the stanford persuasive tech lab\non how people change and they make small\nincremental changes that can make huge\ndifferences over time\nso the first tiny habit we'll talk about\nand i actually think this is\nthe most important one it's whatever you\ndo whatever you say whatever you eat\nwhatever you do it takes three seconds\nyou just ask yourself\nis this good for my brain or bad for it\nand if you can answer that question with\nintelligence\nand love because you do the right thing\nnot because you should but because you\nlove yourself\nultimately doing the right thing is the\nultimate act of love\num it just works\nis this good for my brain or bad for it\nand if it's bad for it i don't do it\nif i care about myself you've ruined\nchocolate for me forever now\nnow that's great for your brain it is\nthat we actually make\nokay sugar-free dairy-free chocolate\nsome vegan\nchocolate coconut bar and they're\nphenomenal\nand what they really are are because\nthat's not our primary business\nit's it's a metaphor for there\nis no suffering in getting well\nplus i am um named after my grandfather\nwho was a candy maker i mean that was\nhis job\nman but he died early because he was\nalso fat and had heart disease\nand i'm not fat and i don't have heart\ndisease\nbecause i know it's a risk for me and i\ndon't give in\nto the behavior making it likely to be\nso but you don't have to give up\nchocolate in fact i don't know if you're\nlike me but i'm very much a creature of\nhabit\nand so you know i have maybe\n30 foods i eat yeah and\ni only want them\nto love me back so i only want to be in\nlove\nwith someone or something that loves me\nback isn't that all of us so i have i\ndon't know if you've ever been in a bad\nrelationship\nyes to meet your beautiful wife and um\nand one day i hope you meet mine and i\nadore her but i've been in bad relations\nme too\nand i'm not doing it anymore there's\njust\ni'm not um and i'm damn sure not doing\nit with food\nyeah that's too often people say i love\nbread i love pasta i love brownies i\nlove\nyou know in fact i had one woman we\nshould talk about the daniel plan at\nsome point\nit's this massive program i did at\nsaddleback church now thousands of\nchurches around the world do it\num and one of the pastor's wives after\nshe heard me talk she said you know\nafter i heard you i told my husband\ni'd rather get alzheimer's disease than\ngive up sugar\nwell and i'm like did you date the bad\nboys in high school\nbecause that's like a seriously bad\nrelationship yeah\nabsolutely right that's terrible yeah so\nlet's start talking about that kind of\nrehabilitation process and in the book\nyou obviously have\nyour incredible acronym and i picked out\nsome of the letters that i wanted to\nfocus in on and one of my big ones is\nwhen you talk about the rational mind\nnow\ni know that we are prone to making\nirrational decisions and choices\nall the time we do every single day as\nfar as i know and as far as my reading\nhas gone and i wonder\nwhy we do that why we constantly choose\nto make irrational decisions and how we\nstart to\novercome that so in the book there's\nthis cool mnemonic brain excel\nand it starts by getting your brain\nright\nbecause your rational mind is better\nwhen you do that\nand the rational mind is really about\ntraining your brain and training your\nmind to help you\nrather than hurt you so often people are\njust brutalized\nby the thoughts that go through their\nheads and\nmany years ago at a really hard day at\nwork\ni had seen four suicidal patients and\nthat's hard\nbecause you feel responsible for them\nbut you actually don't have\nfull responsibility i saw two couples\nwho hated each other\ni saw two teenagers who had run away\nfrom home and at the end of the day\ni'm feeling pretty stressed and i walked\ninto my house\nand my wife and kids were gone but there\nwas an ant infestation\nin my house in my kitchen and i'm\nfurious\nand as i'm wiping up what felt like\nthousands of ants\num when you go to medical school you\nhave to learn 50 000\nnew terms your first year and so you\ncome you get good at coming up with\nacronyms and mnemonics\nso i'm always playing with words yeah\nand as i'm wiping up the ants i'm\nthinking oh\nautomatic negative thoughts um\nmy patients are infested with ants\nand i need to teach them to eradicate\nthe ants and so the next day at work i\nbrought a can of ant spray and i put it\non the coffee table\nand i'm like we're going to get i'm\ngoing to show you how to get rid of the\nants\nand over time that morphed into an\nanteater\nin an ant puppet because i also see\nchildren and\ni taught them how to do it and it's one\nof the most important things that i\nteach anybody\nhow to how to do you don't have to\nbelieve\nevery stupid thing you think\nand if you can learn to tell yourself\nthe truth\nbecause this is not positive thinking i\nam not a\nfan of positive thinking i agree\npositive thinking\nmeans you know i can go a couple of\nblocks to jack-in-the-box\nand get four of their big desserts and\nit won't have a negative impact\non my life and our positive thinking is\ni can\nyou know fool around on my phone until\ntwo o'clock\nin the morning and it's not going to\nhave a negative impact on me\nthe next day people who have low levels\nof anxiety\ngo to jail and they die early there's\nactually a cool longevity study\nout of stanford where they looked at\n1548 10 year old children\nin 1921 and then researchers followed\nthem for\n90 years looking at what goes with hell\nsuccess and longevity\nand the don't worry be happy people died\nthe earliest\nfrom accidents and preventable illnesses\nthe people who live the longest\nthey're conscientious they told\nthemselves the truth\ni have taxes to pay i better pay them or\ni'm going to be in trouble\nor i said i'm going to show up at 2\no'clock\ni show up at 2 o'clock so it's\nconscientiousness which is really a\nprefrontal cortex\nfunction right so you have to have your\nbrain right but here's\nthe tiny habit whenever you feel\nsad or mad or nervous or out of control\nwrite down what you're thinking and then\nask yourself is it true so those are\nthese\nthree little words i love um\nand i have a process that i talk about\nin the book\nso a bad thought like today is going to\nbe hard\nis that true well i don't know\nand then the second question is is that\nabsolutely\ntrue no how do i feel when i believe the\nthought\nawful um who would i be without the\nthought\nfree take the original thought turn it\nto its opposite and what you find\nthe opposite of what's torturing you is\nusually true\nso it just blows your mind but if you\ncan learn\nto be disciplined about questioning your\nown\nthoughts and i got this technique from\nmy friend byron katie\nshe wrote a brilliant book called loving\nwhat is\nbrilliant it's sort of a combination of\ncognitive therapy and buddhism\nand it's i just i love it whenever i'm\noff or i'm sad or i'm stressed i'll\nread portions of loving what is or\nlistening to it because she read it and\nshe has a beautiful voice\nand it's training your mind to help you\nrather than hurt you another rational\nmind technique yeah please\nis start every day with today is going\nto be a great day\nwhy because your unconscious mind will\nfind why it's going to be a great day\nwe are programmed through our\nevolutionary biology\nto wake up in fear because our ancestors\nwoke up and the fear was real\nsomething was going to eat them\nsomething\nwanted to hurt them and so you wake up\nanxious but now that's not true\nfor most of us and\nif you start with today is going to be a\ngreat day\nyour unconscious mind that begins to\nfind\nwell why is it going to be a great day\nand\nfor families it's a great ritual\nhey honey today's going to be a great\nday and then you begin in your mind to\nfind why it's going to be a great day\nit's so easy to find why it's going to\nbe a bad day\nat the end of the day actually do this\nas a ritual both at dinner and then when\ni put myself to sleep\nis what went well today and we focus on\nwhat went well now we also want to focus\non well what can i learn from today what\ncould\ni have done better because we're always\nstriving to grow\nbut when i put myself to sleep at night\ni'll say a prayer\nand then i'll just go back through my\nday what went\nwell because it actually sets my dreams\nup to be more positive\nthan negative because dreams there's a\npurpose for them\nit's really we're consolidating memories\nfrom what happened that day and\nsometimes because you didn't consolidate\nthem from the past\nthey get infected by negativity\nso super simple\num tiny habits that can make a big\ndifference yeah that's a great tiny\nhabit i think building that\nand this is what we find so often even\nin the work that i do that\npeople don't have a conversation with\nthemself\nthat is conscious they have an\nunconscious or subconscious conversation\nwith themselves\nwhich is naturally taking down that\nnegative rabbit hole\nor living out the pattern that they've\nbuilt up for so many\nyears or decades or whatever it may be\nbut i don't know how many people are\nhaving a\nconscious intentional conversation with\nthemselves\nto dive deeper into a thought a belief a\npattern and they've never\num never been taught absolutely\nabsolutely i have a children's book\nthat's relatively new i love\ncalled captain snap and the super power\nquestions\nit basically teaches kids to think about\nwhat they think about\nand to not believe every stupid thing\nthey think and four year olds can do\nthis so one\nquick story yeah please i love your\nstories\nmy last one i have four children and\nchloe's 15\nand she's got red hair like her mother\nand\nwhen she's four she announces to her\nmother that she's going to get her ears\npierced\nthat day and you don't announce things\nto tana\nand tana said no that they didn't have\ntime and she had to wait until she was\nfive\nand chloe said i can't wait till i'm\nfive bursts into tears\ndrama runs into my office climbs on my\nlap\nshe's just crawling crawling her eyes\nout lip little lips going\nand i'm like what's the matter and she\nsaid mommy said i can't get my ears\npierced till i'm five\ni'm like okay what's the matter i can't\nwait until i'm five\nlike is that true yes is it absolutely\ntrue\nwhat do you mean are you gonna die if\nyou don't\nand no lie she rolled her eyes at me i\ndidn't think that was gonna happen until\n12.\nof course not how do you feel is when\nyou believe the thought you can't wait\ni'm mad and i'm sad and my ears aren't\ncute\num okay who would you be if you didn't\nhave that thought\nfour years old free\nwow so what's the opposite of i\ncan't wait what do you mean i said you\nknow opposites we just read a book on\nopposites\ntall and small and fat and skinny\ni can wait until i'm fine and then she\ngot off my lap and one played with the\ndog\nwe could have had drama all day long\nover the years\nor we could just teach ourselves we\ndon't have to believe\nevery stupid thing we think um wow i\nlove that and that's incredible\nthe children's book if you have kids\nthere you go what was the name of the\nchildren's book again\ncaptain snout captain superpower\nquestion that's brilliant i love that\nthat's incredible it's teaching kids how\nto think about what they think about\nthat's brilliant that's amazing that's\nsomething we could all use too\nwe should start there before this it\nwould be such a useful technique that's\namazing\nwell i get the parents to read it to the\nchildren so the parents will get the\nidea absolutely absolutely no i think\nit's you're spot on that we've never\nbeen taught these things\nwe can't expect if anyone's listening\nand watching right now\nwe can't expect to know these things and\nso we have to look at alternative forms\nof educating ourselves it's the only way\nit's absolutely the only way now the\nnext in your mnemonic is about\nattachment\nand this one fascinates me a lot because\nwhen i lived as a monk we\nfocus so much on detachment and\ndetachment yeah i've never\ni've never got that quite down yes i'm\ntotally attached to my wife to my work\nhow the book does you know i want to not\nbe attached\nto how the book does but i totally am\nyeah um\nand thank you for being honest with us\nand yourself i've written\n13 public television specials they've\naired 100 000 times across north america\nand i'm sort of attached how they turn\nout but\nattachment causes suffering and so the\nidea\nwhat i've seen as a psychiatrist is when\nrelationships\nbreak that causes intense\nemotional pain so if we know that's true\nthat we are a pair bonded species that\nwe are\na relational species\nwe are wired that way well you need to\nknow how to take care of them\nand so based on 40 years of helping\ncouples and helping families and helping\nbusinesses\nit's what are the ingredients and\nthere's a cool mnemonic for\nattachments it's called relating it's\nthe r is you're responsible for it\nso you're 100 responsible for that\nrelationship what is it you can do today\nto make it better\nis empathy seeing things from the other\nperson's point of view which is a brain\nfunction\nand autistic kids actually have damage\nin the mirror neuron system of the brain\nwhich is\nthe part that allows me to see things\nfrom your point\nof view l is listening something parents\nare generally not very good at\nand so i teach them this technique\ncalled active listening\nso powerful a is assertiveness\nt is time actual physical time\num i is inquire and to the negative\nthoughts\nyou have so it's about inquiry and it's\nnotice what you like more than what you\ndon't how do they train\npenguins at sea world um they're not\nbeating them\nthey're not noticing the negative they\nnotice what they like that's how you\nshape\nbehavior and g is grace and forgiveness\nand there's a technique on forgiveness\nit's just so powerful because you know\nwhen you hold on to hurts\nthe person you're poisoning the most\nis yourself and how do we do that now i\nknow a lot of the people that\nwatch and consume my work really love\nhearing my perspectives on relationships\nand dating because\nonline dating has completely changed my\ngeneration's approach to love and\nrelationships and modern romance\nand on top of all of that we see this\nchallenge with attachment and avoidance\nconsistently we\nhave people who are scared of getting\nattached because they're scared of\nhaving their heart broken so they avoid\nand\nplay that avoidant role in a\nrelationship and there are those that go\nin full throttle and\nget attached and get their heart broken\nwhat would be\nyour advice in terms of the best brain\napproach\nto building a healthy relationship\nwell it's one get your brain right\ni wrote another book called the brain in\nlove\nand chapter six is how to have a first\ndate from a neuroscience perspective oh\ni love how you can\nscreen the other person i'm gonna have\nto make a video about this you're going\nto be\nif this person's going to be a good\npartner or not a good can you walk us\nthrough it\num bits of it that you can remember so\nit's pay attention be a good listener\nlearn their family story\nbecause they'll tell you about the\nhistory of\ndrug and alcohol abuse or physical abuse\nviolence look for attachments\nand and then watch their habits\nand know going into it new love\nis a drug new love works on the nucleus\naccumbens or\nthe pleasure centers of your brain\nand it works just like cocaine so you\nhave to be suspicious\nof new love because you're not going to\nsee\nthings clearly for probably three or\nfour\nmonths and so just\nknow that and and be ready\nfor it and when people are telling you\nabout their\nfamily history which i think is such a\ngreat example like i couldn't agree more\nwith you\nwhen people are telling you about their\nfamily history how is that corresponding\nor what parallels are drawn between that\nand then their current habits what are\nthe kind of things that you're sensing\nso let's say someone had\na a childhood where their parents were\nalways arguing\nor not getting along how would that how\nis that seen\ntrends pattern wise to affect people\ntoday well\npeople do what their parents\ndid not what they told\nhow they told them how to be yes and so\nyou just are gonna if they don't work on\nit\nthen that's going to be a source of\npotential pain and\nyou know if you're going to have babies\ntogether you really want to understand\nthe history because you know things do\ntend to run in\nfamilies now if you date one of my\nchildren\nfor more than four months i scan you i'm\nnot kidding\nwow it's sort of like meet the parents\nyeah but\nworse but cooler this is crazy i love\nthis\ndo you have a scanner at home like is\nthis like is there a no\nyou haven't seen the clinic don't you\nwant to see the clinic\nand you know my um\noldest daughter married someone whose\nmother had paranoid schizophrenia\nand whose father killed himself now did\nthat mean i didn't want her to marry him\nno but if he had vulnerabilities\ni wanted to make sure he was open to\ntaking care of them\nand and he was and he and i\nactually he's a professor at corbyn\ncollege now\nand we wrote an online high school\ncourse\ncalled brain thrive by 25 where we teach\nkids to fall in love\nwith their brain and how to take care of\ntheir brain so\nthat early scan set up sort of a\nlifelong partnership\nfor us in fact um you know i told you\nabout my first wife and\nshe tried to kill herself i got divorced\nabout 18 years ago\nand i told myself if i ever got married\nagain i'm scanning her\nbefore we go to the next level and when\ni met tana i just\nloved her right away and i knew that was\ncocaine\nyeah and i'm like two weeks after i met\nher i'm like you know you haven't seen\nthe clinic do you want to see the clinic\nand she was game because she's a\nneurosurgical icu nurse and she had a\ngreat brain\nbut by putting brain health toward the\ncenter of our relationship\nit really helps us 100 right when you're\nand she grew up in some serious\ncraziness\nright so i'm not advocating looking for\nthe perfect person because they're very\nfew of them\nbut i knew with her history\nthat she could really deal with a little\nbit of emdr\nit's a psychotherapy for past trauma and\nit was so helpful to her\nand we like never fight with each other\nwow\nand it's it's awesome but\nyou know if if you go out on the first\ndate with somebody and they have three\ndrinks to manage their anxiety\nthat's a bad sign you know i know that\nwas sort of\nin this in the new movie star is born\nthat was\nyou know part of it um but that just\nmeans you're going to suffer um\ni'm not a fan of alcohol and marijuana\njust because of what i've seen them\ndo to the brain yeah i'd love to dive\ninto that actually and before we do i\nwas going to say the reason why i'm\nfinding this so fascinating\nis so many of these were subconsciously\nmy ways of observing my relationship to\nbe with my wife right now but i never\neven knew about it from this perspective\nso one of the first things i asked my\nwife about was her family and her\nrelationships with the family and\nmy wife comes from an incredible family\nher parents are\nextremely respectful to each other i\nhave a wonderful relationship my wife\nhas an incredible relationship with her\nfather\nand i knew that that was going to play\ninto our relationship and these were\nalmost\ntruths that i was looking for\nunknowingly without knowing that there\nwas\nsigns to back it up so for me it's right\nit says chronic fighting\nyeah is a sign that something's not\nright in their brains\nyeah right because ultimately you you\nmarry someone who becomes your best\nfriend or your\nworst enemy and if you're not acting\nrespectfully sometimes it's because the\nbrain\ndoesn't work hard enough and people\nbecome conflict driven as a way to turn\nit back on\nthey don't know it it's not conscious\nit's pavlovian\nother times their brain has an ocd\npattern\nobsessive-compulsive pattern and if\nthings don't go their way they can't\nstand it\nand so in order for you to get them to\ndo what you want you actually have to\ntell them the opposite\nof it and it's just it's a lot of work\nyeah but\nyou can balance the brain and and i did\na study once called the couples from\nhell study\nwe studied 500 couples who failed\nmarital therapy and wanted to be\ntogether\nand 85 of them one or\nboth of them were struggling\nright i mean if if people just buy this\nreally super simple idea your brain is\ninvolved in\neverything you do how you think how you\nfeel how you act how you\ninteract then why wouldn't a marital\ntherapist\nthe first thing he or she should do is\nscan their brain and go\nis it healthy does it work too hard how\ncan i balance that\nbut no marital therapy program\nteaches anything about the brain they're\nall teaching these outdated out\ndata um methods of\nbetter communication and problem solving\nbut if you don't have a computer that\nwill run the software program\nit's not going to work wow so we're\nactually not dealing with the root of\nthe issue at all we're not dealing with\nit\nat all and the issue is always in those\nfour circles right there's a biology a\npsychology\nand so the brain excel format b is\nbiology\nthe rational mind is psychology\nattachments\nis the social circle and i or\ninspiration\nis the spiritual circle it's why are you\nhere why do you care\nand we are wearing out our pleasure\ncenters in the brain\nby constantly hitting getting these\nlittle dopamine hits from our cell\nphones\nfrom social media from\npeople screaming each other on\ntelevision and we're wearing out our\npleasure centers which is why depression\nis so high in our country now let's dive\ninto that bit more i've boxed\nthe marijuana and alcohol conversation\nwhich i really want to get on to\ni've shelved it for now we'll bring it\nback out in a bit but this\nis so so important because i think too\nmany people are talking about this and\nthey may not have the actual expertise\nand the insight that you do\nwhat do you mean by our pleasure centers\nbeing worn out what does that actually\nmean\nand how is that leading to depression\nhow is that leading to\nthe challenges we see in society so you\nhave these two areas\ndeep in your brain they're part of a big\ngroup of\ncells called the basal ganglia and\nwithin them are called the nucleus\naccumbens and when you push on them and\nyou push on them with the\nneurotransmitter dopamine\nyou feel good you know sort of like the\njackpot\nthat i said when i first started doing\nscans it's like i\nlove this i love it when people get well\ni have meaning i have purpose\nmy education is working to benefit\nthese people um well cocaine does that\ntoo\noh i'd love that um pornography\ncan do it um\n[Music]\na scary movie can do it jumping out of\nan airplane\ncan do it and the more\nyou do it\n[Music]\nthe more it begins to wear out your\npleasure centers\nso it takes more and more in order to\nget the same response and so in feel\nbetter fast and make it last\ni talk about the dopamine dump\nversus the dopamine drip right so you\nwant to drip\ndopamine onto your nucleus accumbens so\nthat way it keeps them stimulated and\nhappy as opposed to the dump the scary\nmovie\npornography cocaine\nbecause if you hit them too often and\ninterestingly people who are obese\ntheir nucleus accumbens doesn't react\nlike other people it's sluggish it's\nslow\nto react than if you're\nat a healthy weight because those really\nhigh calorie high sugar high fat foods\nwhen it hits it over and over with\ndopamine it just begins to wear them\nout so you need more and more\nto feel anything at all and you know\nhaving treated many drug addicts through\nthe years\nis the drug addicts tell you initially\nthe drugs made them feel awesome\nand then they used the drugs to prevent\nthe depression\nso just so they would attempt yeah to\nfeel\nnormal but then you know the addiction\ncycle kicked in\nand they were hooked so you want to\nalways\nprotect your pleasure centers and with\nsocial media i did a show with dr oz\non tinder and you know swipe left swipe\nright\nand for the person who was getting lots\nof positive responses his brain actually\nlooked happier\nbut many of the other ones their brains\nstarted to look depressed\nwhen they weren't getting the response\nthey had hoped for\nyeah i love that you brought that up i\nsaw that i highly recommend it you can\ngo and check it out\nwith dr oz and uh dr ayman i highly\nrecommend it it was brilliant\nand and it's so fun to see it because\nwhat's the difference then between\nthe dopamine dump the dopamine drip and\nthen\npurpose because with you having said\nwhat you said that when you\nwere able to heal people or you saw that\nbreakthrough we also get it when i\nlive my purpose and i create some\ncontent or i see a breakthrough for\nsomeone through the work that i'm doing\nwhat's then the difference between that\nyou're getting this\nconstant drip that keeps your pleasure\ncenters\nhealthy right plus you're not doing\nanything that's damaging\nright them i mean it can keep it going\non and on but say for example you're a\nrock star\nand you get the high from being on stage\nover and over again um\nyou don't feel right because too much\ndopamine has hit your nucleus accumbens\nand i have a prayer\nfor the young stars i see it's\ndear god please don't allow me to be\nfamous\nbefore my frontal lobes have developed\nand your frontal lobes really don't\ndevelop in girls until they're about 25\nboys until they're about 28. so you see\nwhy all these young stars get into so\nmuch trouble\nbecause they don't have the forethought\nthe judgment the\nimpulse control it's all prefrontal\ncortex stuff\num to manage their nucleus accumbens and\nso there's this wow\num think of it as the elephant and the\nwriter\nso your pleasure center's really the\nelephant i mean it drives you\ntoward whatever behavior the prefrontal\ncortex is the writer\nand it directs you so\nwhen the writer is inefficient or\nineffective\nor it's not there it just ruins your\nlife\nso you you need a strong prefrontal\ncortex\nto break your pleasure centers\nor you end up doing all sorts of\ncompletely stupid things\nwow that's amazing so and for women it's\n25 on average men it's 28.\nthat sums up so i i never recommend\nwould never let my children go too far\nfrom home\nto go to college because they're right\nin the middle\nof massive brain development\nthe most important brain development\noccurs\nbetween about 15 and 25 and people think\noh it's all from zero to three and it's\nlike your pre-frontal cortex is\ngetting myelinated which means it's\nreally developing\nfrom 15 to 25. yeah the reason why this\nis so current for me right now is i've\nbeen speaking a lot with\nthe social media platforms of youtube\ninstagram and facebook because even a\nlot of creators\nwho are extremely young most of them\nyounger than me too as a creator myself\na lot of creators are going through\nburnout and are going through\nfeelings of depression and anxiety\nbecause of having\nhad a rocketed accelerated fame\nearly on in life and b having to keep up\nwith the pace of social media as a\ncreator to continue to create that\nthat level so their pleasure centers are\nworn out when they don't have frontal\nlobes to modulate it\nbut what you did i mean you spend time\nmeditating and really developing your\nbrain we haven't talked about that but\ni've actually published three studies\non a kundalini yoga meditation called\nkirtan kriya yeah\nand it activated the prefrontal cortex\nand it calmed down the limbic or the\nemotional brain\nso it had that very nice balancing\neffect and it's like a 12-minute\nmeditation\nright this isn't hard or my favorite\nmeditation a loving kindness\nmeditation developing practices\nto balance your brain it should just be\npart of school but unfortunately you\nknow school really hasn't been\nredesigned in 110 years\nand i often think of paul simon's song\nkodachrome which starts off with when i\nthink back\non all the crap i learned in high school\nit's a wonder i can think at all\nand that's why we developed our high\nschool course because come on it's like\nteach them practical things like how to\nor\nmanage the organ that's going to run\neverything in their life absolutely\nand then okay now now you've got me now\nyou've got me thinking of a million\nthings uh the next\nnext thing was around that so the\nresearch that you've done on meditation\nand the brain\nwhat if what are the specifics so you\nsay kirtan korea they have kundalini\nyoga\nwhat would the direct a bit more detail\naround the direct impacts of that\nmeditation on the brain what was\nactually happening\nso we did three studies on it and the\nfirst study\nwhat we found activation of the\nprefrontal cortex\nand we're not the only one they've done\na lot of studies at the university of\nwisconsin\nand calming of the emotional brain\nit also dropped activity in the parietal\nlobes that's a talk\nback part of your brain that's sort of\nwhere you sense\nspace and time so it during that time\nthe 12 minutes seems like it actually\nwent by in about three\nso things become timeless and then we\ndid another study at the university of\npennsylvania\nand found that people who did it for\neight weeks two months\nhad stronger resting frontal lobe\nfunction\nand that's like the holy grail yeah of\nbrain science\nis if you want anything you want big fat\nfrontal lobes\nbecause that's what makes us human\nthirty percent of the human brain\nis the prefrontal cortex eleven percent\nof the chimpanzee brain\nseven percent of your dog's brain three\npercent of the cat's brain\nright this is the part of us that makes\nus human\nand it's called the executive part of\nthe brain because it's about\nfocus and forethought and judgment and\nimpulse control and organization\nplanning empathy learning from the\nmistakes you\nmake so it's where you play chess it's\nwhere you're not just thinking about the\nmoment\noh i can take your rook it's where\nyou're thinking\nfive steps ahead which is\nhow we have survived as\na species we just don't we don't have to\nbe\ninstinct like the squirrel\nwe can plan not just for this winter but\nfor 10\nforward and when your prefrontal cortex\nis damaged you can't you're just in the\nmoment\nand people go oh but i want to be you\nknow and and a lot of people love the\nbook the power of now\nand i actually love the book but i hate\nthe title right because if you're always\nin the power of now\nyou're screwed um because you need to be\nnow\nand later which is why the title of the\nbook feel better fast\nand make it last is so important people\nare too into feel better now\nbut not later yeah and let's dive into\nthat too this is\nif you're listening and watching this\nright now if you're just listening you\ncan't see my face i'm blown away\nuh i'm i'm in awe because i feel like\nthere's so many\ncliches are not the right word but\nthere's so many things that are thrown\nabout\nin this world right now about these\nthemes and topics and we take them as\nreality but then getting to sit with you\nand i almost feel like now i need to go\nand buy all your books and read\nall of them not just this one that's\ngenuinely how i feel right now like i'm\nabout to walk out of here\nand ask my team to order every single\none of your books and i feel like i have\nto\nsit with them for for weeks because i i\nfeel like you're giving me such a\nrefreshing perspective\non so many things that i feel i know\nsubconsciously things that i've known\nwithout the backing of science but to\nhear that from your perspective\nis fascinating one of the big ones for\nme is\npurpose is such a big part of my life i\nbecame a monk because of purpose\ni left being a monk because of purpose i\nmarried my wife because of purpose\ni do what i'm doing right now with you\nbecause of meaning and purpose\nis purpose critical to happiness in life\nor can someone be happy without purpose\nyou know they probably can it's just a\nheck of a lot easier\nto be happy with purpose\nbecause we are a relational species and\npurpose can take\na number of forms it can be helping\nother people\nit can be developing personal skills\nlike i have a ping pong coach\nbecause i love playing it keeps my brain\nyoung it makes me\nhappy or it can be doing something\nmassively important at work\nmy favorite book or at least it's in the\ntop\nfive is man's search for meaning by\nvictor franklin yeah absolutely\nand me too he was younger than freud but\nthere were competitors in the sense\nthat freudian psychoanalysis was very\npowerful in psychiatry\nbut he developed a kind of therapy\naround\nlogos therapy or meaning therapy\nand i'd so much rather talk to my\npatients about meaning\nthan their love relationship with their\nmother right that just it just never\nwent anywhere\nwith me in that whole thing but getting\npeople into\nwhy you want to be well why are you on\nthe planet what is your deepest\nsense of purpose and too often\nin the younger generation nobody's asked\nthem\nthat question and so now they go\ni want to be jeff bezos and i want to be\nthe richest person in the world and as\nsoon as you do that\nyou will set yourself up to fall right\nand\nthat is one of the origin thoughts of\ndepression\nand this is what the bad part of social\nmedia it's\nyou start comparing yourself to people\nthat are actually\nnot completely real and\nbecause you can't live up you feel less\nthan\nand then that drives depression along\nwith oh by the way\nyou're eating crap you have low vitamin\nd\nlevel your hormones aren't good because\nof the\ntoxins your mother toxic lotion your\nmother's put on your body\nright i mean it's more complicated than\nthat but whenever you compare\nyourself you know i could go well i\nhaven't won a nobel prize so my\nlife is meaningless well\nthat's just nuts right the\nthe person who won the nobel prize in\npsychiatry did it\nfor pre-frontal lobotomies right putting\nan ice pick\nup above your eyes and wiping out your\nfrontal lobes so\nit's it's not i'm not pining for the\nnobel prize right\nthe thing that gives me joy and meaning\nand purpose is not being\nbetter than other people it's being the\nbest\ni can be and having the most meaningful\nexistence i learned that so when i was\nin college i was\ngenerally the top student in my class\nbut i helped everybody else i was never\nabout i\nneed to be better than you i wanted us\nboth to be our best and oh by the way if\ni helped you study\nit's reinforcing the information for me\nso han selye was a very famous stress\nresearcher and he it's a term he called\negoistic\naltruism it's mean when i help you\ni'm also helping me yeah absolutely and\nis there such a thing in the brain as\ncompletely selfless altruism like does\nthe opposite of that exist\nand what does that feeling look like you\nknow i don't know i always there's a\nphrase\ni say often is we're all out for\nourselves\nit's just the more sophisticated you are\nthe harder it is to tell\ni recently adopted um\nmy two nieces got taken by child\nprotective services in oregon\ninto foster care which sent me\nso i know you talked about vulnerability\nit sent me into a panic and\ni'm like no i'm not okay with this but\nmy wife grew up in a home\nwhere there was a lot of addiction so\ni'm rescuing the kids and she's like\nno i don't want to be part of that world\nand so\nit was one of our very few fights and so\nwhat we agreed to do was wrap services\naround their mother my wife's\nhalf-sister\nand then within five months the kids\nwere out of foster care and now we\ncare for them and people go oh well\nthat's so kind of you and\nit is kind but it's awesome for me\nyeah right when i see their report cards\nand they're getting straight a's when i\nsee them\nfall in love with their brains that\nturns on the dopamine\ndripping to my nucleus accumbens and you\nknow i see them do a ward yes okay\nso that's a dopamine dump but you don't\nwant too many of them right and\nit's it's meaningful it's purposeful\nbut it's a huge blessing\nabsolutely yeah so yeah that one's i'm\nalways fascinated by\nis is you know what is selflessness and\nwhat is the\ndefinition of selflessness because i\nactually don't think it's\ni don't think it's bad as and i think\nyou agree from what you just said i\ndon't think it's bad to want to do good\nfor\nothers and and feel good about it but\nalmost we sometimes look at that in a\nnegative way and say oh well you're only\ndoing it to help yourself well you know\nthere are always\nnegative people and you know i think cnn\nand fox have done\nmore to promote mental illness\nwith the constant negativity fighting\n[Music]\nlooking for something to be wrong and\nthen they\ntrain the minds of the millions of\npeople who watch\nto look for what is wrong\nwhich is a bad mental discipline\nrather than looking for what is\nright absolutely absolutely i want to go\nback and pick up off the shelf the\nexciting topic you brought up because i\nthought oh yeah let's talk about that\nbecause i\ni have some very similar views to you\nbut i want to hear your perspective\naround marijuana and alcohol\nspecifically marijuana we're in la right\nnow and\nobviously it's legalized and hot\ndispensaries\nabsolutely lots of corners you can go\nyeah you can go\nget it uber as quick as you can um\nso i have no dog in this fight um in\nfact i make more money\nif you smoke pot than if you don't smoke\npot\nyou are way more likely to come see me\nand\npeople just don't understand the\nresearch they go oh well there's not\nenough research\nno marijuana increases the risk of\npsychosis 450 percent\nif teenagers start smoking pot that is\nnot a good thing\nand the reason i sort of turned negative\non it\nwas i've done 150 000\nspec scans inspect looks at blood flow\nand activity\nit makes the brain look toxic ah\nit does i published a study in the\njournal of alzheimer's disease on a\nthousand pot smokers\nevery area of their brain was lower\nand then just a few months ago i\npublished the world's largest imaging\nstudy on 62\n454 scans on how the brain ages so we\nlooked at the brain from nine months to\n105\nand it's got fascinating aging patterns\nlike it's not really done until about 25\nand girls and 28 in boys\nand then we looked well what are the\nfactors that accelerate aging\non the top of the list with\nschizophrenia if you have schizophrenia\nyour brain looks worse than everybody\nelse\nthe second worst thing was marijuana was\nworse than smoking it was worse than\nalcohol\ni'm not a fan\n[Music]\nand i see so many people go\nbut i feel better i concentrate better\ni'm more\ncreative and i'm like there's so many\nother ways to do it\nthat don't have a potentially toxic\nimpact on your brain now having said\nthat\ni'm a huge fan and i think it should be\nlegal you're really going to put\npotheads in jail\nyou're going to sleep deprive them\nchronically stress them\nlet them hang out with people who do bad\nthings\nthat's insane um but let's not\n[Music]\nthey're they're really separate issues\nyeah right let's not glamorize\nthey use glamorize and everybody thinks\nand cbd\nnow is like they're giving it to their\ndog for goodness sake\nand i worry you know cocaine used to be\nin coca-cola\nyeah and opiates used to be\nthe antidepressant and when xanax came\nout onto the market\num it was called mommy's little helper\nand all of those things have caused\ndisasters in our country and we're\nwe're setting ourselves up again it's\nsort of like\n20 years ago alcohol was a health food\nyeah right i gotta have my two glasses\nof wine a day because it's good for my\nheart\nbut we clearly know now it's related to\nseven different kinds of cancer\neven if you're only a mild to moderate\ndrinking\nany drinking shows an increased risk\nfor cancer so i don't smoke pot and i\ndon't drink now my wife drinks like two\nor three glasses of wine\na month where when i first met her\nshe drank considerably more than that\nnever a problem\nbut i don't want it to have a negative\nimpact\non her health yeah you've all heard it\nthere we go\ndon't have to just hear my perspective\nwe're going to get haters\nno but i'm so glad no but i'm glad we\nwent i mean who better to speak to than\nsomeone who's looking at\nthe direct effect and it comes back to\nthat same point that you brought up\nearlier around if i go take that one\nback off the shelf of\nnow versus now and later and it comes\nback to that because\ni experimented with drugs throughout my\nteens absolutely everything under the\nsun\nnever got addicted never did something\nconsistently enough but always wanted to\ntake one or two tries of everything\nand then gave it all up at 18 and never\nmet i haven't drank alcohol or\nsmoked anything or or taken anything\nbecause you feel like you're missing\nsomething not at all not at\nall not at all i feel amazing and i get\nto be creative and my whole life is\ncreative and i get to travel the world\nand\npeople go well if i go to a party i'm\nanxious learn how to deal with\nthe anxiety rather than have to medicate\nthe anxiety because that's\nnow but not later right\nyeah and you know and when you're around\nand you go to a party where there are a\nlot of people drinking\nyou know for me i generally just leave\nbecause they're sort of stupid\nand they're like saying things that it's\nlike did you really say that that's\nso rude why would you say that because\nit drops\nfrontal lobe function and it drops\ncerebellar function\nand your cerebellum is the major\nprocessing organ in your brain\nand you don't want to be slow absolutely\nabsolutely and this is what we're saying\ni'm not i'm not judging anyone\nwho does either of these things and i'm\nnot criticizing anyone it's just making\nyourself\naware it's just becoming more aware and\nthat's that's all i\nthat's why i ask the question not to\njudge anyone not to criticize anyone not\nbecause i think i'm better than anyone\nfor not having done it\njust to be aware and when i was young\nthe thing that made me become aware\nwas my friend and i went to see his aunt\nwho happened to be a heroin addict and\nshe had a fit\nin front of us and that was the day i\nwas like okay i\ncannot do this any longer because\nactually seeing someone\nwho is addicted to heroin have a fit in\nfront of me\nwas far more telling to me than any\nstudy or\nany research or whatever it was just\nseeing that and experiencing that i was\njust like okay\ni need to stop messing around in this\nspace so i was at the white house\nlast year about this time and all of my\nliberal friends uh go you'd really go to\nthe white house\nand i'm like it's the executive branch\nof government\nand we were they asked me to\nhelp them think about the issue of the\nopioid epidemic\nand prison reform and so i was really\nhonored\nof course and my\ninput was we need to develop\na national brain health program\nto teach people to fall in love with\ntheir brains\nand that's why you don't drink or that's\nwhy\nyou don't do drugs because you love your\nbrain and you want it to be\nhealthy absolutely i couldn't agree more\nand congratulations by the way that's\nincredible and i'm happy that people\nlike yourself for being involved in\nthose discussions and decisions\nbecause like you said again if you don't\nsee it i mean how can you tell anyone\nwhat to do\namazing i wanted to\nstart touching on a specific area that i\nhad here was around\nthe eye in the mnemonic as inspiration\nand i wanted to talk about why is it\nthat inspiration is often\nso short-lived instead of long-lasting\nlike we feel like even on social media\nnow people watch a video and they feel\ninspired or people hear a speech and\nthey feel inspired and people\nuh people even hear this podcast today\nand they'll feel inspired but then\nthe change doesn't happen there's no\napplication there's no practice\nwhy is that inspiration short-lived and\nhow do you make inspiration\nlast into action and application yeah so\nyou have to turn them into habits\nand because we're habitual creatures\nand if you can turn the good things\nand so you know it's the smallest thing\ni can do today\nthat will make the biggest difference\nstart every day with today is going to\nbe a grade\nright right um what one purposeful thing\nwill i do\ntoday and you know people spend more\ntime\nplanning their vacations\nthan planning their lives which is a\nlittle odd\nand so i love everyone\nto do the one page miracle that's in the\nbook\nit's so what do i want in my\nrelationship so for example with my wife\ni want a kind caring loving supportive\npassionate\nrelationship i always want that i don't\nalways feel like that\nyeah right but if i get my eyes on that\nwhen i get that rude thought that comes\ninto my head\ni just filter it with will this get you\nwhat you want and no\nit won't get me what i want so i inhibit\nit\nnow how can i inhibit thoughts well if\ni'm drinking i'm less likely to inhibit\nit if i'm smoking pot i'm less likely to\ninhibit it if i haven't\nslept i'm less likely to\ninhibit it and so it's the brain\nhealth habits it's then the clear\ndirection i want this and so\nwell then how do i get that and that's\nwhere i begin to break free\nof the bad habits plus i published two\nstudies that showed as your weight goes\nup\nthe physical size and function of your\nbrain goes down\nso you need to be a little bit horrified\nby you know i always think with\nmotivation is know what you want\nbut also be clear with what you don't\nwant\num because pain is actually a bigger\nmotivator for people\nthan pleasure often 100 and that's what\ni love about this book i love how\nstrategic the book is and how practical\nit is and that's when i was speaking to\nyou earlier i love the fact that there\nare\nactivities exercises questions that\npeople can use to reflect\non themselves in the book and and that's\nunique because often\nwe find that when books are written from\na medical perspective\nit can be quite hard to digest whereas\nwhen i was reading through this i didn't\nfeel that way at all so\nanyone who's watching and listening\nright now if you're looking for tools\ntips practical habits to actually break\nthrough\nthen please please please go and get the\nbook because it's going to help you do\nthat\nso just just thanking you for actually\nhaving gone through that\ngone to that stage so now we finish\nevery interview i will ask you if\nthere's anything i missed but we do\nfinish every interview with what i call\nthe final five\nwhich is my final five questions usually\nrapid fire quick fire\nin the final five minutes so i have\nyours here if they're not\nrapid fire i'm not upset because i i\nthink your insights are beyond one to\nthree words and i'm okay with that\nuh the first question i have which which\nis from the book but i loved it was\nwhat is the quickest way to break a\npanic attack\nso four simple things the first thing is\nbreathe\nyou gotta take a big breath and take at\nleast\ntwice as long to blow it out that'll\ntrigger a parasympathetic\nresponse in your body to calm\nyou down the next thing is what are you\nthinking write it down\nbecause often fortune telling negative\nthoughts drive panic attack you're\npredicting the worst possible thing\nand then your brain is just masterful at\nmaking it worse\nso killing the ant the third thing is\ndon't leave\nif you're starting to have a panic\nattack at work don't leave\nbecause if you leave the panic will now\nstart to control you\nand it could actually turn into\nsomething called agoraphobia where you\ncan't even leave your home because\nyou're worried\nyou're going to have a panic attack and\nthen\nthe fourth thing if all those things\naren't working there's some simple\nsupplements that can be\nreally helpful thinning gaba ashwagandha\nhuge fan of things like that\nto just help calm you down and i talk\nabout them in the book absolutely\namazing great piece of advice\nlove that uh second question is what are\nthe simplest food we can add to our\ndiets to nourish our brain\ncolorful fruits and vegetables so not\nskittles when i say colorful\num or m m's no no no\nbut try when you're in the produce\ndepartment\nto pick as many colors as you can\nbecause they're loaded with antioxidants\nalso scratch the low-fat diet\nbecause 60 of the solid weight of your\nbrain is fat\navocados are god's butter\nuh i'm a huge fan of wild fish\nthe societies that eat the most fish\nactually\nhave the lowest incidence of depression\namazing great advice so succinct as well\ni'm impressed this is uh\nbrilliant third question is what's where\ndoes ego sit in all of this and how much\nhave you\nstudied ego at all if that's why i\nactually like\nfreud's concept of id ego\nand super ego and i really think of them\nabout prefrontal cortex\nso when your prefrontal cortex is low or\nyou are young\nit's just not developed that's the child\nin you\nthat takes over and in our society\nthe four-year-old rules um\nyou know whether it's the white house or\ncongress or the media\nor you know just everyday society\nit's we're way too impulsive and there\nare way too many temper tantrums\ngoing on um the ego is really healthy\nfrontal lobe\nfunction um so you're\n28 or 40 and you're good to your brain\nand it helps you make good decisions and\nbe\nthoughtful this super ego\nfreud's concept is really when your\nfrontal lobes work too hard\nand you get you're rigid you're\ninflexible\nand you're harsh to yourself and\nto others so balance your brain and\nbalance the ego\nin a good way brilliant question number\nfour you brought up slightly earlier\nwhat's your best advice for anyone who\nhas party anxiety\nor social anxiety in those kind of\ncircles\nso it's so common it's actually one of\nthe most\ncommon anxieties on the planet and it's\nwhy people drink\nit's why people do drugs because they\nfeel uncomfortable\naround other people and and i think\nyou'll like this\nlearning how to manage your anxiety\nthrough things like\nhypnosis guided imagery meditation\nit just should be part of everything we\ndo\nalong with learning how to not believe\nevery stupid thought you have in the\nbook i have one of my favorite rules\nit's called the 1840-60 rule which says\nwhen you're 18 you worry about what\neverybody's thinking of you\nand when you're 40 you don't give a damn\nwhat anybody thinks about you\nand when you're 60 you realize nobody\nhas been\nthinking about you at all people spend\ntheir days\nworrying and thinking about themselves\nnot you so it's really hard for my\nparanoid\nschizophrenics to get this guns up\nbecause they think\nthe whole world revolves around them it\njust\ndoesn't and if you can get it that a\nnegative look from someone else\nmay mean nothing more than they are\nconstipated\nyou don't know\nand other people are anxious too and so\noften\nif you're at a party and you're feeling\nanxious go you know i just\nfeel anxious sometimes you know and the\nother person's likely to go oh you know\ni'm that way too\nand then all of a sudden everybody's\nanxiety goes down\nwhen you believe you have to present\nyourself as that\nperfect person nobody can relate to you\nbecause\nnobody's perfect yeah so true that's a\ngreat piece of advice as long as soon as\nyou open up and say hey i'm struggling\nwith this\nsomeone else has the permission to say\nthat too absolutely i love that and\nfifth\nand final question was actually all\naround what we spoke about before which\nwas about\nwhat i'm fascinated by you and when we\nspoke earlier as well is your ability to\nbring together\nscience and spirituality your ability to\nunderstand both\ndimensions and and both approaches to\nunderstanding our human\nselves and condition and you spoke about\nearlier we're talking about death\nand and i'd love for you to reiterate\nthat story that we were speaking about\nearlier and just\nelaborate more on on what you have found\nin terms of all your studies etc through\nspirituality coming out\nwe are all spiritual beings and\nas a psychiatrist if i don't understand\nyour\ndeepest sense of meaning and purpose why\nyou believe you're on the planet\nand what happens to your soul after you\ndie\nthen i don't really understand all of\nyou which is\nmy goal and so i told you before\nlast week i had a friend that died and\nhe told his partner\nthat she had to let him go because he's\nbeen invited\nand where he's going he's seen and it's\nbeautiful\nand as 1977 i\nread a book called life after life by\nray\nmoody and it was about people who had\nnear-death experiences\nand it gave me a really deep sense of\npeace\nthat i don't believe i'm here by random\nchance\nnow i know a lot of my science friends\nyou know they're 100\non evolution and we're all here by\nrandom chance they just forget the\nsecond law of\nphysics the second law of physics is\nentropy\nthings go from order to disorder\nin the universe they don't go from\ndisorder to order\nand i'm sorry i have a brand new\ngranddaughter and\ni don't think havens here by random\nchance it just\nit makes i think it actually takes more\nfaith\nto believe we're here without any\ncreative design or intelligent design\num than to believe that\nour interaction today happened out of\nrandomness\ni love that perspective it definitely in\nmy sense is to think things are\nundesigned\nis actually generally pushing our faith\nmuch further i couldn't agree more\nthat's really well said really\nbeautifully said\ndaniel it's been absolutely incredible\ni've learned so much today i genuinely\nmean this and i'm not lying\nas soon as i walk out of this room i'm\ngonna ask my team to order every single\none of your books i feel like i'm gonna\ndive deep into all of them and i feel\nlike i want to continue the conversation\noffline\nand back on the podcast anytime you like\nbecause\ni can only think that anyone who's\nwatched and listened to this today has\nbeen benefited in some way\nand i know that when they go and buy the\nbook they'll be benefited in an even\nbigger way so i highly highly recommend\nit\nis there anything that i haven't touched\non that you really feel like\ni should have asked you could have asked\nyou would have asked you and and you'd\nlike to touch on\nyou know the only well two things yeah\ni finished the book with a chapter on\nlove\nthat you don't do the right thing\nbecause you should\n[Music]\nyou do the right thing because you love\nyourself and\nand and i've just thought more and more\num\none of my other books is called the\nbrain warriors way\nbecause uh my wife and i wrote it\ntogether\nand we just believe we're in a war for\nthe health of our brain alzheimer's is\nexpected to triple\num 36 percent of teenage girls suffer\nfrom\ndepression um that if you\nlove yourself and you love your planet\nand you love your country and you love\nyour world that ultimately doing the\nright thing\nis not because you should do it but\nbecause of love\nand if you do it out of love it's just\nso much\neasier to do um\nthe other thing just to touch on for a\nsecond is can i before we get it is\nthere another thing separate is that\ndifferent way can we go into the one you\njust mentioned because\ni'm fascinated by it too and in the\nvedas that i studied as a monk it talks\nabout\nthe three types of motivation and and\nthe lowest motivation is\nignorance or fear the middle motivation\nis duty or\nobligation or responsibility or because\nyou have to\nand the highest motivation is love as\nyou rightly said so\ni couldn't agree more do you think\nthough that that begs the question that\nthe biggest challenge we all have is\nthat we don't\nlove ourselves like we don't love our\nbrain like we we just\nwe're so inundated with trying to be\nthat which we're not\nor letting the opinions of others affect\nhow we are\nand our self-belief and that's actually\nwhat's affecting our brain health the\nmost\nis we're not looking at through the lens\nyou're you're recommending and\nsuggesting\ni think that's exactly right yeah and\nyou know when i turned 50 my doctor\nwanted me to have a colonoscopy\ni asked him why i didn't want to look at\nmy brain wasn't the other end\njust as important but we don't screen it\nwe don't look at it and\nultimately we don't love it you can't\nlet a child hit a soccer ball with their\nhead\nand say you love that child or that\nchild's brain\nit's just not possible when you\nunderstand the physics\nof it and i've had a lot of sucker boys\nall of them just flashed before my eyes\ni love soccer i'm a huge huge football\nfan so\nyeah okay so if and i tell them because\ni\nhave done 225 nfl players i mean hall of\nfame players\nlike terry bradshaw and if you're going\nto do it\nbecause we're always going to have\ndangerous jobs that's a dangerous job\nif you're going to do it you should be\nputting your brain in a healing\nenvironment\nall the way along not just\nwhen you retire see that's like doesn't\nmake any sense\nbecause if you're going to play and one\nof my players signed a 42 million dollar\ncontract so he's going to play\nyou have to be rehabilitating it all\nalong because you'll actually be a\nbetter player\nyes absolutely and the second thing you\nwere going to offer and then i stopped\nyou\nthe second one is we had just\nbegan to talk about a book i'm just\nstarting to write called the end of\nmental\nillness yes i'm so tired of\nthe stigma attached to mental health\nproblems and these in fact aren't mental\nhealth problems\ntheir brain health problems get your\nbrain right\nand your mind will follow\nand i just think we have to completely\nbreak\nthe paradigm and create a new\nspecial stress depression anxiety all of\nthese are brain\nhealthy brains they're not mental\nproblems and\nwhen you get your brain right then you\nrealize\num i have to learn how to manage stress\nbecause\nstress actually shrinks the major memory\ncenter\nin my brain which is going to make me\nmore stressed\nif i can't remember what i'm supposed to\ndo\nthat depression clearly is a brain\nhealth problem\nand there's not one form of depression\nand that's the problem\nyou go to your doctor and 85 percent of\npsychiatric drugs are prescribed by\nnon-psychiatric physicians\nor nurse practitioners or your physician\nassistant\num i'm depressed so they give you one\nsize fits all and one size fits all when\nyou look at the scans of depressed\npeople\nthey're at least seven different kinds\nand one\nyes can help this pattern but will\nactually make that pattern worse\nand so all of these medications have\nblack box warnings because they\nhurt people and we can just do\nso much better and coming here i saw\nsomeone on hollywood\nand vine who was clearly psychotic they\nwere talking to themselves they were\nhaving this whole conversation\nand i'm thinking to myself i wonder if\nhe had a brain injury\ni wonder if he has an infection in his\nbrain lyme disease is rampant in this\ncountry\num for causing psychosis um\ni wonder if his body's inflamed and so\neasy to call him crazy easy to give him\nan antipsychotic that he won't take\nbecause it'll make him\nfeel bad the harder question but the\nbetter question\nis why is he that way and if i balance\nhis brain\nwill it help balance his life and my\nexperience the answer is yes\nabsolutely amazing thank you so much\ndaniel thank you to everyone who's\nwatched and listened remember you can\nget the book feel better fast and make\nit last\nuh go get it right now if you're\nfascinated by this conversation we\nliterally just scratched the surface\nof what this book really takes into\naccount make sure you go and get it if\nyou like this conversation thank you so\nmuch daniel for taking up the time to be\nhere and\ni feel like we need to do another 10\nbecause i'd love to dive into\nall of the different types of clients\nyou've worked with and hear the stories\nabout\nhow you specifically worked with them\nwith their specific challenges to\novercome them so i think this is\nthe first of many hopefully and i'm sure\nall of you watching and listening will\nagree but daniel thank you so much for\ntaking out the time\nso great to be with you again yeah i\nreally appreciate it thank you so much\nyou're welcome\namazing if you want even more
