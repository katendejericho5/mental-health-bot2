    "transcript": "the more you're exposed to you see a lot\nmore\nnegativity and it's disturbing and\ndisgusting to me\nbut instead of me becoming bitter and\nevil about it i've chosen\nto become more self-aware and i have\nmore empathy for people\nand i never want to change that i think\nif anything it's given me more empathy\nbecause i'm like oh i feel really bad\nfor you yes and i feel bad that you\ncan't also understand\nthat i'm just living my life i'm not\nperfect i\nam doing what you're doing every single\nwe're just trying to figure it all out\nbut if we're all a little more\nunderstanding and kind to one another it\nwould make\nour trials tribulations ups and downs\nthat much easier\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and\nevery single one of you i'm so grateful\nto you for your time\nweek in week out you show up to listen\nto learn\nand to grow and it means so much to me\nthat you trust me with your time\nand that's why you know that my\ncommitment to you as my community\nas my audience is to find people that i\ngenuinely connect with\nto find people that i believe that can\ntruly help us live more vulnerably more\nauthentically more deeply and today's\nguest is someone that i can't wait to\nintroduce to you now she\ngenuinely needs no introduction so i'm\nnot even going to\ndo that element of the show but she's\nsomeone that i started talking to\nprobably about a year ago now or maybe a\nlittle less\nand all of our conversations have been\nso uplifting\nso inspiring so motivating everything\nshe posts on social media\nreally speaks to her beautiful heart and\ni'm so excited today to unpack that to\nunravel that and discover more about her\nand her name is khloe kardashian chloe\nthank you for being here thank you that\nwas such a beautiful intro thank you\nwell i meant every single way genuinely\nthank you\ni'm excited to be here i really am and\nyou've been someone i've been dying to\nmeet in person so this is an honor for\nme so thank you well i'm honored and\ntouched to hear that because\nthe feeling is very very mutual and my\nintention for doing this podcast and\nreaching out to you to do this was\ni love a podcast as an excuse to get to\nknow each other better\nand i was also hoping that we have all\nthese secret conversations offline\nright or well online sorry online on\ninstagram and i was like\ni wish we could share this with the\nworld everything that we talk about all\nthe things that we believe in\nright to explore the things we have in\ncommon right and for people to get to\nknow the deeper parts of you and\nall the amazing messages you have well\nand it's so i mean i know your job is to\nbe positive and uplifting but when it is\neven we talk through dms and it's\nit's really beautiful when that\ntranslates because sometimes it's all\nabout smoke and mirrors and people might\nproject that they're one thing but\nthat's not really what they live and\nthat's entirely who you are so it's\nreally great to see that and even coming\ninto your home and you allowing me and\nmy film crew and all of us in here your\nhome is\nsuper zen and beautiful and you have\nlife in here with your trees and it's\njust\ni mean it's a great message thank you\nthey're wonderful too i actually said to\nthem before you came i was just like\ni've never never met a crew that's so\nhappy yeah that's that's great energy\nlike everyone was like smiling\noh they're the best you're having a\ngreat conversation yeah they're the best\nand they're like that\nevery single day and they're dealing\nwith me and my crazy family with\na slew of emotions so for them to\nmaintain that beautiful energy it really\nkeeps\nme very balanced and centered yeah\nno it's beautiful so anyway the feeling\nis very mutual even your demeanor the\nway you came in today\nand and all the conversations i mean\ni've read some of our conversations to\nmy wife and she was just like\nlike we're both just so lovely i just\nlike you you project so much love in the\nconversations we've had thank you\nand so that's why i felt compelled to\nreach out to you i appreciate it yeah\nbut\none of the things you said to me that\nstood out in one of our dm conversations\nwas you said imagine if everyone in the\nworld was\nfive percent kinder and and that stuck\nwith me i was just like\nwow like yeah imagine if everyone's just\nfive percent kinder like you weren't\ntalking about oh let's make everyone in\nthe world super kind and you know\ntell me what that means to you and like\nwhat made you say that and where that\ncame from\nwell i feel i don't know if it's the\nolder i get or the more accessible i\nam to so many people because of social\nmedia nowadays and\njust the technologies in our hand\nit just feels really heavy the world\nfeels really heavy\nand depressing and if you read\nstatistics um\nfrom mental health bullying violence\neverything is escalated and i think\nwe're too\nexposed to too many avenues of people\nand too many ways for people to connect\nwith us\nand we are all made up of energy and\nwhen people either take too much from\nyou it is\na ripple effect and sometimes if someone\nprojected\nnegativity onto you you just\ninstinctively will project it back to\nthem\nor as a defense mechanism to somebody\nelse and\nit's also not fair to misdirect that\nenergy because it is a ripple effect and\nit goes to other people\nbut if we were to be a little more\nself-aware and when someone is mean or\nnegative to us instead of\nus being combative back if we were just\nlike\nwhy are you hurting or just even like\nokay and just took it instead of having\nyour ego involved where you have to\nshout louder\nif you just took it that's even just\nbeing kind i'm not saying\npeople have to go buy roses for everyone\nor whatever but even\nopening a door um smiling at someone you\ndon't even have to talk\nit's a universal language that everybody\nunderstands\nthat would give a ripple effect or even\nthe\nkarma back to you that you're going to\nreceive a little bit more kindness that\nday i think it's\nhighly naive of me to say 50 or let's oh\ni want everyone\nto you know think that they're\nsurrounded by glitter and unicorns like\nthat's just not reality\nit is and it's also cool when life gets\nheavy too to see how you can manage and\nfilter through it\nbut that doesn't mean we still have to\nbe horrible people to one another\nyeah no i love that i love what you're\nsaying because i think we also\nand you touched on this we think being\nkind means these\nbig gestures or like having to save the\nworld or you know doing something really\ncolossal like it has to be big and\nexpansive but you're right that we\nforget and we underestimate\nhow much just a smile a kind word\na kind message or thinking of someone\ncan just change someone's day\nand i love those simple things because i\nthink that those are things anyone can\ndo\nand those are things everyone can\nappreciate whenever i have like a\nwaitress or someone\nthey are busting their butts to\nwork and they're cleaning tables and\nthey're serving you it's a beautiful\nthing\nand instead of just like you don't even\nlook up at them if you just look at them\nstare them in their eyes and say thank\nyou or\nyou can tell that people are so rude\nto people in any service industry\nbecause they almost get\nlike shocked like that someone's staring\ndirectly at me\nand as a human you never want to feel\nthat you're invisible or that people are\nlooking past you you want people to look\nat you yes and even just that alone that\nmakes someone's day and if someone was\nhaving a bad day or feeling like\nman i can't get by i'm working my ass\noff and i'm still people are just\nmean to me it depresses them more like\nit's like just look at someone hey how\nare you thank you so much\nlike that's it a busboy anything i think\nwe all take for granted\nhow hard everybody works no matter what\nyour job is it's still a job\nand just a little smile or a little hope\nyou're having a nice day like something\nso simple it does nothing for you like\nwhy does that hurt you just do it\nand it could really change their entire\nday yeah i remember a huge mistake that\ni used to make like this was\nsomething that i wish i never did but i\ndid and i is i literally used to\nwalk into ubers and or lifts and i'd be\non my phone\nand i wouldn't say anything because you\nknow you've already programmed where you\nwant to go\nright so you don't need to talk to the\nperson if you don't want and i would\njust walk in i wouldn't even say hello\nand i wouldn't say hello i wouldn't say\nhow's your day i wouldn't greet them and\nit took\none driver to actually not start driving\nfor like three minutes\nand he was like hello how are you oh wow\nand i probably even missed it the first\ntime and the second i was like hello how\nare you and he kept\nasking me and what's been like the third\nor the fourth time that i registered\nbecause i was so busy\nwow and i was just like oh wait a minute\nhe was just like yeah i just wanted to\nhave a just\nask how you were and it just took me to\nthat where i was like i can even just\njust saying hello now i'm not saying you\nneed to get into a big life story\nconversation with your uber or lyft\ndriver but\nthe point being that they're still\nhumans correct right\nand i think because of our phones and\nwe're so busy\nbut remember we all operated before our\nphones somehow\nso life goes on do you remember that\nthough i do and i miss that time\ni do feel bad for like my little sisters\nwho i don't think will ever\ni don't think they ever knew that time\nbecause they were too young they didn't\nthey wouldn't have a phone\nat that age anyway but we forget that\nwe're all\nhumans and i also yes of course we don't\nwant to have like sometimes we're just\ntired and we don't want to talk\ni get it but i also just\nmost people can be room readers so if\nyou go in the car like hey how are you\nlike and that's kind of it\nif you even just if they keep engaging\nyou're not being rude you could still\nkind of just give short answers and\nhopefully\nthey'll kind of get the clue yeah and\nstop talking to you and if not you know\nmaybe they just need someone to talk\nyeah definitely not encouraging anyone\nto get into a life story conversation\njust be human i think you put it best\nyeah be human we talk a lot about\nself-care self-worth in our\nconversations\ni see you post these amazing stories and\nthat's how i actually\nfound out i remember once you posted one\nof my videos and i was just like oh wow\nlike i just\nfelt very humbled and touched and but\nyou share so many other people's and i\nthink\nyou do such a great job of encouraging\ncreators like myself as well in sharing\nthat\nand not just me and i know you share\nplenty of other creators as well which\nis so beautiful\nand when i started to see that and i see\nthat on your stories all the time like\nis either true\nor a true statement right you see the\ntrue or true statement and and\nand i love that i've commented back so\nmany times and said i'm really glad you\npushed that whatever\nwhen did you kind of get to that space\nin your life where that became a\npriority like when did you come to that\nyou were just like\nmy self-care and this journey of\nself-reflection are\nimportant to me now like when did you\nget to this space of everything you're\nsharing now\nwell i've always been a writer i write a\nlot and i journal\num i write a lot mainly for myself and\nthen i love it it's so therapeutic\num i did a lot when i especially when i\nwas going through my divorce\nspecifically and it was so therapeutic\nfor me um\nyou're just even able it's like a\nrelease and sometimes when you write\nsomething you either see how important\nit is or how\nsilly it is to you at the same time but\nit's out of your system and you could\nburn it do whatever\nand then i used to write um\ni would post a quote and then write a\nlarge caption\nand it's before i had as many followers\nand it\nsome people would tear it apart so much\nthat they took out\nlike the real meaning of it and they\nwould make it into whatever they were\nfeeling\nand it wasn't what i was feeling so i\njust chose to\nstop doing that as much because it kind\nof ruined it or like the blogs would\ncreate\nthings i'm like but that you took the\nbeauty out of it that wasn't what it\nmeant right um but not everybody is as\ndeep or as\nthey just want it to be salacious and\nsomething way worse than it is\nbut i also started seeing how much\npeople\nwere craving some sort of guidance if\nyou will\nand not that i'm that person to go to\nbecause i'm still figuring out my life\nwe all are we're still just\nhuman beings and we're gonna make\nmistakes and live our life but that's\ni'm okay with sharing my failures\nbecause i'm secure enough\nand just me being a person i'm still\nfiguring it out i don't know what i'm\ndoing every day\nbut some i just realized how much what a\npositive\nreaction i would get when i would post\nsomething encouraging to other people\nor i would go on someone i would go on\nstrangers pages and just like oh my gosh\ni love your freckles and like what that\nwould do i'm like\nthat's crazy that just being kind gets\nso much positive feedback like that\nshould just be normal\ni think we're just used to people\nbullying each other and if someone like\ni would never go to someone's page\nto criticize them that's just not who i\nam i wouldn't waste my time if i felt\nsomething i'm like oh\nwhy don't i even think that about the\nstranger who am i i would go to\nsomeone's page to encourage an uplift\nso but i think in today's day we're so\nused to people going to pages\nto be these uh you know computer bullies\nand let's just talk about people but\ni mean they're really struggling in\ntheir own life and that's the only\nreason why they're acting out like that\nis because\nthey're feeling that about themselves or\nwhatever and they're just trying to\nproject it to somebody else\nyeah and i love how that what you just\nsaid now it's almost like it transforms\nyour\nfeeling towards them into kindness too\nbecause you start recognizing where\nthey're coming from\nright what they're going through to make\nthem that way i think it's just created\nit's interesting in the world that we\nare in it's either\nthe more you're exposed to you see a lot\nmore\nnegativity and it's disturbing and\ndisgusting to me\nbut instead of me becoming bitter and\nevil about it i've chosen\nto become more self-aware and i have\nmore empathy for people\nand i never want to change that i think\nif anything it's given me more empathy\nbecause i'm like oh i feel really bad\nfor you yes and i feel bad that you\ncan't also understand that i'm just\nliving my life i'm not perfect i am\ndoing what you're doing every single\nwe're just trying to figure it all out\nbut if we're all a little more\nunderstanding and kind to one another it\nwould make\nour trials tribulations ups and downs\nthat much easier\nyeah i love that you've always been\njournaling i think that's such a\nit's such a great practice and and i\nlove that because i've recommended so\nmany people that i've worked with to\nto journal and read it back themselves\nand you're so right that sometimes you\nread your feelings back\nto yourself and you cry and there are\nsometimes you've read your feelings back\nto yourself and you laugh\nbecause you're just like what really\nyou're like that's what i'm upset about\nyeah like that is so petty in today's\nworld or\nbut and we all have to also be kind to\nourselves and realize\nthat like i hate when people say like\nwhat do you have to worry about you have\nall this money or whatever\noh so money means you don't have\nproblems and\ni don't care who you are problems are\nproblems um\nin your world i might you might walk a\nday in my shoes and be like i don't want\nthose issues or i might walk a day in\nyour shoes and be like wow\neverything's beautiful but you might see\nwhat i thought was beauty\nas you're not happy and satisfied with\nthat and you still want more or maybe\nyou want less\nthose are all okay feelings that's why\nwe each have our own\nlives but to attack somebody else for\nwhat is considered their problems i just\nfind really counterproductive and that's\nnot\nmotivating yourself if you want a lot of\nmoney go out there and get it i believe\nin you i'm applauding you\nbut when people i think journaling is so\ngood especially when it's private\nbecause for me personally it's something\ni get to write down and i don't feel\njudged\nbut i'm allowed to criticize myself\nbecause it's my journey and i know\nthe day one to the last day that i've\ntaken those steps so i'm allowed to\ncritique and be like you know what khloe\nyou're\nyou're way past this you don't need to\nharp on things like this\ni think it's healthy and even if you\nread it back and you just laugh at\nyourself i think that's also a great\nform of therapy\nyeah 100 what's the most powerful or\nmeaningful journal entry you ever wrote\nthat was\nthat was really like transformative for\nyou fascinated\nthat's a good question you know i\nsometimes i write and i don't even know\nwhat i'm saying\nright like sometimes i'm just like it's\nlike words and then it turns into\nsomething and i never even knew that was\na thing but i i was like you know i'm\njust compelled to write\nand i would just start scribbling and it\nmight be literally talking about my day\nand then it goes into maybe like\nsomething to do with like why did this\nhappen like you just like because your\nmind wanders\ni know you meditate i'm not i pray i'm\nnot great at\nmeditating and sitting and my mind\nwanders too much so i\nwhen i pray my prayers are very\nconversational and i realize it's kind\nof how i\njournal as well it's more of a\nconversation but i'm talking\nalmost to myself which might be a little\ninsane but\ni think the most important meeting we\nhave is with ourselves i guess so\ni think it's great yeah no it makes\nsense i i love that because\nfor me meditation's a prayer too and and\ni think that's what's so beautiful about\nit that it is a conversation it is an\nexchange\nand often one of the things that i would\ndo is i would in my meditation or prayer\ni would ask a question\nand it's not about trying to find the\nanswer it's about sincerely asking the\nquestion\nlike can you really ask a question with\nsincere intent\nwith with a genuine feeling of like i\nreally want to understand this and when\nyou ask it with that\nthen of course it becomes a conversation\nbecause there's a response and you're\nright sometimes it's from within\nsometimes it's from someone you have a\nconversation with that day it comes from\nabsolutely anywhere and\ni i love that i i think prayer is so\nimportant and and like you said even if\nit's just a conversation with yourself\ngod the universe whatever you work with\nit's\nit's a beautiful practice to have i\ndon't care what anybody else believes i\nbelieve in god i'm not judging whoever\nbelieves in i do believe everybody\nshould have a faith\nin something it centers us it holds us\naccountable\nfor our actions every day and so my\nfaith is in god i'm christian\nand i wake up every morning early\nintentionally so i can i have\na beautiful view and i open my windows\nand i just\nlook and i pray of i always start my day\nwith gratitude because i think that\ntranscends through the rest of my day\nand not that we can control every\nemotion but i like\nto even if i sometimes you just wake up\nand you're either melancholy or you're\njust\nkind of grumpy but even if i\nam i try to convince myself this is a\ngreat day\nlook how blessed you are like\neverything's beautiful we take our\nhealth for granted like we're healthy\nlike i just try to\nhave a conversation with myself and if i\nam having a grumpy day it normally\nturns it around yeah normally we all\nhave those moments where it doesn't yeah\nwe've intersected some of our mornings i\nthink some of our conversations been in\nthe morning and\nwhat do you have is that gratitude\npractice that you have is just talking\nto yourself like that's what it is for\nyou just\nalmost like guiding yourself to be\ngrateful in the morning right\nyeah i just it's um and that's new i've\nalways prayed but it used to be just at\nnight and\nover the past couple years i've decided\nlike you know what i want to start my\nday like this too i think because it's\ni used to just be so busy i'm still busy\nbut like i would never take that\ntime and yes i have to wake up earlier\nbut it changes my whole\njust the momentum of my day um so i wake\nup earlier i make it an effort\nyou make time for the things you want to\ndo 100 and\nyou know i make that's something i want\nto do it gives me\nsuch a better lighter energy throughout\nthe day\nand i just it's important i think we all\nhave ups and downs and we're all going\nthrough rough patches so not every day\ni've felt compelled to do it but i've\nstarted doing it maybe like\nfour years ago and i i love it it's more\nit's increased over the past year\nsignificantly where you probably would\ndo it\nevery now and then and now i do it\nreligiously i would say for the past\nyear\nthat's beautiful thanks for sharing that\nas well i love finding out about these\nthings because i think\nso many of us don't get a space to share\nthis and that's one of the reasons why i\nwanted to do this was i'm happy that\nwe're learning this about you but and\ni'm learning this about you\nuh what's something i i love what you\nsaid about figuring things out because i\nactually think\nwhen we're sharing when we're figuring\nthings out\nthey're more relevant it's almost like\nwhen you figure something out perfectly\nand then you teach it\nright it's kind of doesn't feel as real\nto everyone who's learning but\nlike you said like when you're when\nyou're trying to navigate life and\nyou're making mistakes you're failing\nand that's the same with me like i'm\nalways\nsharing that everything i'm sharing in\nmy videos is stuff that i've been\nthrough and i'm working through\nand figuring out what's something you're\ntrying to figure out right now like\nwhat's something that you've been\nreflecting\non right now goodness my life no\num you know i there's nothing\nspecifically i can pinpoint um\ni absolutely love being a mom it's one\nof my favorite things\nand you know i've read well about\nunder a year i would say about eight\nmonths ago i went into i've had a\nbreakup and so\nfiguring out i think\npeople are so good at distracting um and\ni've\nreally chosen to not distract myself or\nto try to not distract myself\nmaybe people can say true would be a\ndistraction but if anything she's a\nhealthy distraction\nand i love like i haven't jumped into\ndating i don't\ncare to date right now i'm not in a rush\nfor it i feel so\ngood in my life and i i don't really\nneed much else um and so\nsomething that i'm focusing on is just\nmaking sure that i process everything i\nthink\nespecially in my family we're good at\nmoving on like we're we have\nvery big forgiving hearts we just move\non but we don't really talk about\nthings that happened and i don't really\nknow if that's\nhealthy or not and so for what i went\nthrough with my breakup\ni forgive tristan i don't think he's a\nbad person i think we all make mistakes\nwe're humans\nbut it's only going to hurt me if i'm\nholding on to this anger and playing\nthis victim role i don't believe in\nbeing a victim\ni believe in okay this happened to me\nlet's figure it out let's push through\nit\nand maybe if i'm open and honest about\nit it can help other people\nfeel like it's okay we're all human\nwe're all gonna get through things but\nyou also can't condemn somebody else for\njust either sinning differently than you\ndid or i just feel like we're all\nwe're all so quick to you know uh\nexile people and it's just so\nheavy to me and so something i'm just\nfocusing on\nis making sure i'm healed from that or\nas much as i can\nand try to understand it as much as i\ncan\nand then don't distract myself right now\nand so i just try to have a lot of\nme time in the mornings and that's where\ni kind of filter through that\ni think hearing that's beautiful i don't\nthink yeah no just listening to you say\nthat i was like\nwow like how what a beautiful place to\nbe in thank you i feel really\ngood like i can hear that i do i'm proud\nof myself because i think so many people\nit's natural to almost be the victim\nit's natural when like especially when\nyou're on this platform and the whole\nworld is like\noh i feel so bad for you it's like okay\nthank you but\nthis else also happened to i'm sure\nhundreds of other people before\nnot saying it's right i'm just saying\ni'm not going to die we're all fine\nand i want to show my daughter that it's\nokay and it's a beautiful thing to also\nforgive her dad he's a great person\nit's you know maybe him and i weren't\ncompatible or whatever on that way but\nthat's okay\nlike nobody's gonna die here and i\nalways want true to be surrounded by\nlove\nand i know babies feel energy we feel\nenergy and i just want her to always\nfeel just bliss as much as i can\nthat's so incredible i know it's not\nrealistic every day\nbut as much as i can control it i feel\nlike it's my\nmama bear job to control it i think so\nyeah well well when i'm when i'm hearing\nyou say that i'm feeling the energy of\nwhat you're saying and to me it sounds\nlike the\nyou know i don't think i don't think\nwhat you're presenting is an ideal\nimpossible i think what you're\npresenting is\na very real opportunity to say it's my\nchild i want her to have\nthis environment and i'm going to work\nreally hard for her to have this\nenvironment\nwhatever that means oh it's hard yeah\nit's not easy for me\nit's you know it would be easier for me\nto keep my daughter away and be like\nno because you hurt me but he never hurt\ntrue like you know what i mean like\nhim and i have our own relationship and\nthen tristan and true have theirs and i\nwill never come in between that i don't\nbelieve in that\nbut i attest that to my parents were\nincredible co-parenters from what i know\nthey brought my mom and my dad i'm sure\nfought all the time\nnot around us i would never know um my\nsister courtney\nand my i like he's like my brother scott\nthey're incredible co-parenters and\nas long as it's not hurting you in any\nway\nlike if this was hindering courtney's\ngrowth or if it hinders my growth\nthen you have to also put yourself first\nbecause\nyou are in fact taking care of your\nchildren\nbut if it's not hindering you or hurting\nyou in any way i think it's important to\nwork on all relationships\nyeah i read something the other day that\nkind of i feel really articulates what\nyou're saying\nit said letting go is hard but holding\non is harder\nand and that's the choice almost that we\nhave in these tough situations and the\nway you're sharing it is just\namazing by the way like i'm just thank\nyou yeah i mean i mean or i think it's\nincredible gosh thank you\nyou and all of me i mean it i'm not just\nsaying it\nno that's something i mean it because i\ni think\ni'm sure there's so many people\nlistening right now who can relate to\ncircumstances in your life situations in\nyour life that you've been through you\nknow we we all know that these are\nthese things happen you know out there\nand and i think\nso many of us hold on for so long and as\nwe know like you said it's hard work\nit's not easy it's\nit's not just going to be plain sailing\nbut the fact is that\nyou can move in that direction you can\nand i've\ni've been through a lot of things in my\npast that i think have put me here i'm\nnot saying oh it's\nso easy and no it's hard work it\ndefinitely is\nbut i think with every relationship i've\nbeen in i've always\nlearned kindness is really kindness and\nunderstanding\nand also i've like one reason why i\nstopped\nsharing my journaling or my long\ncaptions if you will\nis because people only understand from\ntheir level of\nperception as well and it would\ninfuriate me when\nmy beautiful notes i'm sure you could\nunderstand because you share so much\nwould be taken in a way that i'm like\nthat's not at all\nhow i meant for that to be and so\ni can't explain something to someone\nwhen this is only the level of their\nunderstanding and the their want\nto understand yeah people also have to\nhave the desire to\nwant to learn more and want to open up\ntheir mind to un like if i'm closed up\nand if i'm just some bitter\nperson where i live my life like the\nworld is unjust and why do bad things\nhappen to me\nit's like to me there's no good there's\nno bad things happen\nit's the energy of the world how you\nhandle it is\nthen again another ripple effect from\nhow i think\nmore things are going to happen to you\nbut if i'm sitting here like\nlife sucks life is so unjust unfair\nall these bad things are happening then\noh my gosh you're just going to attract\nall this heavy stuff but if i'm like\nokay\nthat was not the best but i'm going to\nfigure out why and let me try to move on\nand still let me\nnot misdirect my energy let me try to be\nhappy let me try\nto still be kind to others as much as\nyou can and\nyou can still hurt but you should also\nheal and then be\nresponsible for your hurting and not\nchannel it to other people\nyeah i just feel like sometimes we're\nreally irresponsible with our feelings\nand we have to be responsible as adults\nespecially adults that are supposed to\nbe\nguiding kids and like our youth you have\nto be a lot more responsible and\nhow we do things yeah that that's so\ntrue i love that about being\nirresponsible with our feelings let's\nexplore that a bit because i think\nthat's such a powerful statement in and\nof itself\nand this morning literally this morning\ni was sharing this uh reflection that i\nwas having on social media\nand it was about how it's it's tough to\nstart communicating with children\nbut sometimes it's even more tough to\ncommunicate with our inner child\nright and like while we're trying to\ngrow up and everything and it's like\nwell you're saying that we're\nirresponsible with\nall the feelings that were there and we\njust move on and we think when we move\non you've dealt with it\nright but but that healing that you're\ntalking about it's just\nfor me as well like i always felt like i\nwas someone who moved on and i was\nalways felt like i was someone who like\ni didn't get affected by that\nand then i started to see that actually\ni had behaviors in me\nthat were complete reflections of a past\npain\nright like there were there were\nbehaviors in me that were reflections of\na past guilt\nright and then i realized that it's not\nthat they just disappeared it's that\nthey were going to come out in a\ndifferent way\nthat was going to hurt future\nrelationships it was going to hurt\npresent relationships and and for me\nthat's where i started to work through\nthat where i said\nsee actually what i saw in whatever it\nwas i'm now reflecting that\nlet me look at that behavior and see how\nthat behavior can be healed and\ntransformed right and what's the root of\nthat does that make sense\ncompletely and also i think people\nget confused even when you're like no\ni'm i'm totally over that i'm healed\nyou can still talk about things and be\nhealed you can still\ndraw back on those things and say it\nhurt me when\nit did hurt you when but i think\nsometimes people like oh you're done\nwith that\neuro like why are you talking about this\nfor so long or whatever and it's like\nthat's also a form of my\nhealing i hate when other people who\nhave not been through the trauma you\nhave been through\nany of us because we've all gone through\ntraumas they want to tell you\nwhen to stop hurting and that's not\nanybody's place to tell you when to stop\nhurting\nit's and everybody has a different\nlifespan of pain\ni think everybody will deal with things\nin different what might be\ntraumatizing to me might be nothing to\nyou and vice versa we can't invalidate\npeople's feelings\nthat's only going to traumatize them\nmore and also shame them\ni'm so over like the emotional shaming\nof\nwhat people do to other people people\ncan have their feelings and do what they\nwant\nas long as they're realistic you also\nhave to step outside\nof your own self and be self aware and\nsay okay am i completely\ndelusional am i making these because you\ncould also your mind you can play tricks\non\nand you could start creating a false\nreality as long as you're being\ni think really authentic and genuine\nabout your feelings i think\nit's okay to talk about your pains and\ntraumas i think especially for doing it\nin a way that's\nbeneficial to other people i think\nthat's\nbeing responsible um but i think if\nyou're just talking about\nnegative stuff to talk about negative\nstuff you're like oh my gosh shut up\nalready\nyeah you know there's like there's it's\ni think you just again you just have to\nbe responsible\nyeah you can't i love what you said but\nyou can't put a deadline\non someone else's pain right you can't\nbe the one to\ninvalidate or validate how long someone\nneeds to\ndissect something or break something\ndown and i think that's such a great\npoint and and you're right that i think\nbut as long as it's\nrealistic do you know what i mean like\nsome people just care they just\nare negative they just have like a dark\ncloud over them because they've created\nthat\ncloud but that's realistically not their\nreality you look at them and you're like\nwhat are you talking about\nand if it was something from five or ten\nyears ago you're like okay babe we gotta\nnot that we're putting a deadline on it\nbut let's start working\nthrough it let's not sit in the\nbeginning stages of\nwhatever's holding you back so it's the\nbalance that you're talking about it's a\nbalance it's it's\nit's not either raw correct because you\ncan't just talk about it forever and\nyou're not doing anything about it right\nat the same time you can't say oh get\nover it today\nright it's that balance like i can't\nstand people that are like eating a\nbucket of like\nhaagen-dazs ice cream look i'm so fat\nand like they won't work out\nthey won't change their diet they won't\ndrink more water they want whatever\nbut they're complaining complaining\ncomplaining i'm like well you're always\ngoing to be in this victimized\nstate because you're literally not doing\nany you're not being self-aware you're\nnot even looking at your own\nreflections saying okay what can i do to\nchange things about myself\nit's everybody else's fault and what\nwould you say to someone who's in that\nsituation whether it's\nwhatever is whether it's their physical\ntheir emotional their mental\nhow do we then talk to that person or\ncoach them with compassion out of that\nlike you've done a lot of that work\nhow do you do that with someone else in\nthe same way as we do with ourselves\nlike what would you say to them\nit's uh it's it really does come from\nwithin i think whenever people do things\nfor other people\nit's always you're setting yourself up\nfor failure i think you really\ngenuinely have to want to change areas\nof your life and if you don't just be\nhappy with who you\nare um it doesn't i don't care\nphysically what you look like\nyour weight whatever as long as you're\nhealthy and happy\ndo you but i know for me\ni was overweight for like i was\nunhealthy for a lot of\nmy life and then when i was like i just\ni started going to the gym\nduring my divorce like a significant and\nconsistent amount\nfor my mental i needed a release and i\nneeded to feel\nstrong and i just needed to get rid of\nall of these thoughts and\ni wanted to be alone and the only place\nto really be alone was being on an\nelliptical with headphones in my ears\nand kind of just vibing out\nand as a side effect i started losing\nweight and i was like oh i kind of like\nthis\nlike you know losing weight and then\nbecame like\njust some competitive weird streak in me\nthat it was like i want to see if i can\nget\narm muscles i want to see like it\nstarted that but that was never my goal\nwas never\ni want to look good in a bikini that was\nnever my goal it was i just wanted to\nfeel good mentally\nand i think when you start putting\nyourself first you start feeling so much\nbetter there's not\na size close that that you have to fit\ninto it's just\nthen you start exploring things like wow\ni like how i feel\nwhen i drink more water i like how i\nfeel when i pray in the morning\nand because of that you start to become\nhappier and lighter\nand then you start to want to do more\nthings be more active\nsocialize more whatever it is and so\nmany studies now show that\neven a small amount of exercise a day is\nso great for the mind and the brain and\ni think that's been underestimated for\nso long\nand i know i underestimated that in my\nlife for so long where\nyou know i was always someone who\nfocused on the mind and kind of\nneglected the body and like pushed the\nbody to limits and then i was just like\noh wait a minute they're all\ninterconnected right you can't just say\noh i'm going to deal with this i'm not\ngoing to deal with this actually\nwhen you take care of mind body and soul\nthen it starts then you feel\nthe best version of yourself correct and\nand even if\nand that's what i love that even if your\nfirst intention for going to the gym or\ndoing anything\nis wrong as you do it more you'll\nprobably come to the right conclusion\nright right if you\nstay consistent with something you can\nusually raise your intentions completely\ni have a\ntv show called revenge buddy and all the\npeople face it's a show and\nall these people are from different\nwalks of life and they start with some\ntrauma\nand they all come on the show like i\nwant revenge on and it's\nlike it's a play on words revenge body\nit's not i don't think\nthe best revenge is a good body yeah\nit's just a play on words but they come\non the show\ni want revenge on my ex-boyfriend or on\nmy dad or whoever\nand i'm always like okay and like the\nfirst interview and then towards the\nshow\nthey're feeling so because they think\nthis good body is gonna want this\nperson's gonna treat them good it's like\nhow superficial and narcissistic are we\nbut we are that's the world we live in\nand so towards the end they never want\nrevenge\non the person it starts out with they\nwant compassion and they're like i\nand or i don't want that boyfriend\nbecause i deserve better because i feel\nbetter\nand the show they think it's all\nphysical but what we do we kind of break\nthem down mentally to\nself-reflect and look at themselves and\nfigure out what got them here to this\nplace\nbecause you can't always blame somebody\nelse for why you are the way that you\nare\nyou have to be accountable too and\nthat's something that\nit means it's means so much to me\nthat through that show people get to see\nthat a little bit\nthat you might it might start off one\nway but that's\nit's all about internal at the end of\nthe day yeah whatever gets you started\nis usually a good thing because at least\nit gets you in there\nbut but what i love about what you've\njust said is that\nit's just anything that\nanything that gets us started is a good\nplace to start but\nwhen you're giving someone the power to\nmake you feel beautiful you've also just\ngiven them the power to make you feel\nugly right and so\ncompletely you're just always giving\naway your power if you don't upgrade\nthat intention\nand i think we see that in every part\nwhether it's our body our mind our\nintellect our academics whatever all\nthese expectations of others\nthe more we're looking for someone to\nsay yes you're amazing now yeah\nit's like you're waiting for that\nstatement you could wait your whole life\nfor it it could never come\nright and it also almost could become an\naddiction\nlike people they might not it might not\nbe good enough for one\nfrom one person they need it from\nthousands in this or whatever but it's\nnot\nthat it's because they need to hear it\nfrom within you need to tell yourself\nyou're beautiful you're dope you're so\nsmart\nwhatever it is but they don't feel it\nthey don't believe it so when people\nkeep telling them\nyou're such a good person they don't\nbelieve it at all that's why they keep\ntrying to\nfind validation and empty things\ni love that that's amazing you've you've\ntalked about things that you do like\ngratitude journaling prayer what else do\nyou do on a daily basis that\nyou don't negotiate with you like i have\nto obviously exercise two workouts\nyeah working out yeah that one too what\nelse is there in your day that you're\njust like i can't negotiate\nwith this like this has to be something\nthat i must do\nevery day every week um are those\nthose are pretty much the core i mean\nit's\npraying and working out are like my two\nthat i do\nbasically every single day and like\nyesterday i did my schedule wrong\nor no the day before i did my schedule\nwrong so i missed my workout and i was\nlike oh like i felt\nno i felt fine i went along my day but i\njust when i realized that i did my\nschedule wrong i was like oh my god i'm\nso bummed because what it does i'm not\nlike it just clears my head i feel so\ngood afterwards so\nwhatever that is for people it doesn't\nhave to be what your\nnon-negotiables are mine it's just i\nthink everybody has to have\nthose there are like i think they they\nfuel me\nyeah you talked about working with your\nfamily which i think is fascinating\nin in the first sense because it's an\namazing thing that you're\nconstantly surrounded by working with uh\nyou know just you're just in that\nenvironment all the time and you said\nthat you're good at moving on and\nforgiving each other which i think is an\nincredible quality as well like what's\nthat like to\nto deal with every day and how are you\nhow are you learning more from that\nexperience like what are you learning\nfrom that\ni think it's one of the best blessings\nin the world that i get to say that my\njob\nis being with my family every day when\nthis first started we were much younger\ni think it was 23 or 24.\ni'm still 23 or 24. i don't know how\nthat works but yeah we're in the same\nday yeah\ni'm like what um but it\nyou know norm when you get older you all\nhave your own families and kids\nand not that anything happens but you\nnormally see your family\nholidays not as frequently we see each\nother every single day and i'm\nhonored to be able to do that yes there\ncauses more fighting or tension\nbut the thing that i've learned about my\nfamily is we are\nloyal and we no matter what disagreement\nwe have or whatever we'll always\nfigure it out we're not a family that's\nlike i haven't spoke to my sister in\nseven years like\ni don't know how people do that and we\nare very\nunderstanding of each other um\nand i just think it's a really great\ndynamic like we're understanding of\nif we're all going through something or\nwhatever we really try to be there for\none another\nand support them through that and i just\nthink it's\ni think it's important to show our kids\nabout family unity or to show that\nyou know two heads are better than one\nthree are better than two we're not\ncompetitive with one another and\nwhatever we each want to do\nwe support each other until the end and\ni i think today's world everyone's like\nin a battle to who's the best and who's\nthis and who's that and\nwhen we first started i remember like\ninterviewers would always say so\nlike do you guys go after the same men\nor do like they would always like our\nquestions would be more\nthey would almost want us to fight they\ndidn't they couldn't stand\nthat we it was just really like no we\njust\nlove each other and i don't know why\npeople love\nsomething salacious and twisted rather\nthan\nbeautiful and just kind\nright no but i mean it's true and it's\ninteresting but that's you know i guess\ngood stories don't sell\nthat's why yeah and i think we can\nchange that like the reason why i do\nwhat i do and what i really believe in\nand\nwhy we've connected and what i love\nabout our connection is i\ngenuinely believe that if we keep giving\npeople if we\nif we keep shooting for the lowest\ncommon denominator for people\nthen they'll settle for that right like\nif you only put junk food\nin front of someone yeah they're gonna\ntake that and eat that\nright but if you put healthy food that\nmaybe looks and tastes like junk food\nbut that's you know really amazing then\nmost people will switch\nright and i feel the same is true of\nmedia i feel the same is true of stories\ni feel the same is true of everything i\ni believe that people are more beautiful\ndeeper and\nsmarter than we believe and we don't\ngive we don't always give everyone an\nopportunity to live to that and\ntherefore\npeople with influence people with\nresponsibility people with power\ncan either choose to sell something that\nshoots at the lowest common easy thing\nto shoot at and it's easier to sell\ngarbage quite frankly it's so much\neasier but\nwe are the ones with the influence of\nthe power to say no actually let's let's\nmake people\nright aspire for the higher that we know\nthat's inside of them right\nyeah it's interesting i get so many\npeople will comment negatively when i\npost\nalmost positive things i have i have ups\nand downs i have a handful of\nsupportive handful of oh my gosh get\nover yourself or whatever and i'm like\nyou need this the most like it's so you\ncan tell the people that are really\nsuffering the most\nbecause they're so quick to condemn and\nto\njust take the junk food they just want\nthe bad stuff they can't handle\nthe good things and especially when it's\nconsistent because that's just i post\nfor me i don't post for other people\nlike i'm like this is for me i need to\nhear those messages\nand if i need to hear it i'm hoping at\nleast one other person does\nand but it's interesting that you can\nsee right off like the people that are\nresistant to it because some people\ndon't\nthey also don't want to open their mind\nup to becoming better people\nbecause sometimes your own comfort\nwill restrict you from your own\nhappiness though because they're too\nafraid\nto step away from their comfort zone\nthey would rather just be complacent\ninstead of actually finding like\nsomething that really makes them happy\nand excited about life\nyeah and i think i remember being there\nsometimes too and\nand so like what you were saying earlier\nof like having empathy towards that\nperson and then\npraying for them and hopefully opening\nthe door for them one day or having you\nknow wherever they're gonna find that\nbecause i do believe that\nthe more we have these conversations\npublicly openly\nthe more these kind of messages\ncirculate and go viral and get shared\nthe more people feel the permission and\nthe reflection to look within themselves\nit's almost like if it's not out there\nif you've never heard it from your\nparents\nif you've never heard it from your\nteachers right you never heard it from\nyour best friend growing up or the\nperson you looked up to\nit's kind of a lot of this stuff we\nexpect people to have self-taught but\nit's not it's something you have to hear\nfrom someone that you look up to or\ninspired by that kind of gets you going\nit's interesting you said\ngive yourself permission to look inside\nyourself\nand it's it blows my mind that so many\npeople do feel like they need\nthe permission yeah when you're in\ncontrol of your own self\nbut so many people they want to be like\nsheep they just want to be told what to\ndo and let me follow the herd and that's\njust\nit's mind-blowing to me yeah yeah it is\nit is tell me something that\nyou've learned from true and something\nyou're trying to teach her\nbecause so many of us because her energy\non hi felica\nmalika that's my best friend so nice to\nsee you thanks for being here\nyeah nice to meet you i'll give you a\nbig hug in a moment\nyeah yeah later definitely uh but i i i\nknow that you post so much about her\nwe've we've spoken about her i think her\nenergy radiates straight off the page\nyou know\nmy team was speaking about it earlier as\nwell like\nyeah what what has she taught you and\nwhat are you trying to teach her\ni'm asking this because i haven't had\nkids yet oh my god no she's\nand it's interesting i never like\nyou can feel your child's personality\nand like she's a really good person\nshe's has empathy already\nfor other people and it's\nit sounds crazy that you can know that\nbut you can i\nnever really understood that until i had\na child\nand i've always had patience i'm good\nwith patient i've\nalways loved kids but she gives you a\ndifferent\nkind of patience and when you feel that\nlike you're exhausted and you can't go\non with your day\nwhen you're around your own child you\nget this surge of energy and you're just\nlike oh i got to keep going like\nyou just figure it out and so she just\ngives me\ni think more of a drive and\nto stay fit to stay healthy because i\nwant to be an active mom with her i want\nto be here as long as i can\nbut i would say it's a different type of\npatience i think it's a softer patience\nand i mean i've always been goofy i've\nalways been silly so\nmy inner child is there and i will be\nthe first one to\nplay and be wild and i don't care how i\nlook like i'm like\ni'll be an animal it doesn't matter but\ni mean you're just like reliving your\nchildhood again it's fun\nyeah oh that's awesome yeah so that's\nwhat she's teaching you\nshe's and she's also she's taught me so\nmuch more understanding from my mom\nand you just realized that\ni think when you're a kid you'd think\nyour parents are\nsuperheroes and they are but you still\nhave to understand\nthey're just humans they're still like\ni'm just a person\ndoctors are just people we give\neverybody so much power\nand they're allowed to make mistakes\nthey're allowed to not know what they're\ndoing\nmy mom didn't have google how the hell\ndid she figure things out like now me\ni'm like\ni don't know can kids have honey i have\nno idea i\nask my phone and i get the answer back\nthen it's like\ni have so much more compassion i think\nfor my mom and if\nwhen i was a teenager and i'm like oh\nwhy'd you do this to me when i was a kid\nand whatever and i'm like\nbecause she didn't know yeah she had\nlike you know i feel like\nyou just i have more understanding and\ncompassion for my mom\nyeah absolutely i love that we did a\npart i did a podcast about\nthree weeks ago and it was called six\nreasons why we need to develop the\nemotional skills our parents didn't have\nand one of them was to recognize how\nhard it is yeah and and the second one\nwas to\nbuild compassion because of how hard it\nis and to recognize what you just said\nlike the\nthe ease at which we have information\nthe more conversations about parenting\nnow and like\nmore research that's been done and you\nlook at parents before all they had was\njust what their parents told them and\nthen that was passed down and passed\ndown and passed right\nso yeah that's a beautiful lesson i'm\nexcited to see what i learned when when\ni have children\nyeah but those are definitely beautiful\nones yeah it is the best yeah those are\ndefinitely beautiful ones that i can\ni can take forward what is it that's on\nyour mind right now that when we were\ntalking and we decided to do this what\nwas there that was in your heart that\nyou were like\ni really want to share this i want to\ntalk about this that we haven't kind of\ndived into right now you're like there's\nsomething on my mind that\nno i feel like i mean i was so excited\njust to sit with you and to have this\nnatural conversation i feel like we've\ntouched a lot of topics and i love that\ni didn't want it to be too contrived and\nabout promoting something i just wanted\nit to be like a beautiful conversation\nso i appreciate that and i feel like\ni don't know is there anything else\nthinking no that was the same for me\nmy intention was to just i wanted to\nhold space to just\nhear you and let you talk and share\nbecause\nlike i said at the start from any\nconversation we've had\ni just think that your journey of\nfiguring it out\nsharing this positive message that\nenergy is so awesome and i want everyone\nto experience that\nthank you and that's what my intention\nwas and i think i've had that today i'm\nsitting here listening to you going i've\njust learned so many things today oh my\ngosh\nand that's the thing i think i our show\nis our show and that's a\nthat's a piece of me i don't blame\nanything like on editing that's who i am\nthat's one\nbut that's one layer of who i am\nand i don't really get to divulge in\nthis\nlayer of who i am i mean i do little\nbits here or there on instagram\nyeah but sometimes like i said it's hard\nbecause people tear it apart\nfrom what they ever what their level is\nto perceive something\nand sometimes that discourages me from\nwanting to share because that's not at\nall what i meant but when you're able to\nreally vocalize something and have a\nnatural dialogue it's sometimes it's\neasier to share\nhow you feel so thank you for giving me\nthis platform to do so\nno of course that's i mean that's what i\nlove about podcast in the first place\nbut also just like\nyeah just being able to dissect the\ntopic for like 30 minutes 40 minutes\nlike\nthat's we need more of that to also\nunderstand people better and give people\nan opportunity but\ni'm hoping that we're going to continue\nseeing you share your work\ni'm hoping that we're going to see more\nof your journals i'm hoping and praying\nthat we're going to see more of that\nexpression\nthank you because i truly believe it's\nhelping people\nand the the percentages are always going\nto be in your favor because\ni think the amount of people that are\ngood and seeking good and\nare starting with good intentions are so\nmuch more powerful and stronger and i\nwant you to feel that so\nthank you well you're definitely a huge\nlike motivation i know for so many\npeople that i know\nand it's i know it's scary and sometimes\nreally daunting and\nheavy because so many people do someone\nlike you turn to you because i know the\nlittle amount that people turn to me\nand i'm not some self-help retired monk\nare you a retired monk yeah i don't know\nwho am i\nformer monk i don't know what the proper\nterm is no no but like\ni could only imagine how draining it\ngets for you\nbecause people are requiring so much\nof your energy but you know keep going\nbecause\nyou've helped me in so many ways and\njust by remember the first time i ever\nheard about you someone sent me a\nyoutube video of you was before i found\nyou on instagram\nand i i was like who is this man\nhe is you're so moving you're so\ngenuine and kind with what you're saying\nand from what i feel non-judgmental and\nit's\njust a really amazing trait that you\nhave\nand i know you're helping a lot of\npeople and you've made me feel like it's\nokay to share more things and that's why\ni like to share more other people's\nstuff\nbecause i feel like people sometimes\nthey get too critical if they think it's\njust mine\nand they need to know that it's okay to\nshare love and kindness the way that you\ndo so thank you yeah\nand thank you for encouraging people\nlike me i'm humbled by hearing that from\nyou and\nit means the world it it really does\nbecause there's\nthere's a beautiful statement that was\nsaid by martin luther king and he was\ntalking about how like\nthose who love peace need to learn to\norganize themselves\nas well as those who love war and and i\nthink that those of us\nwho are in this mission and purpose of\nwanting to spread kindness and\nand not just in like this positive\nmovement sort of way like i\nthink like real work real healing real\ntransformation not just like\nlet's be happy not that kind of stuff\nbut let's really do the work let's\nreally heal\nright i think it's it's really\nencouraging when we work together and we\nencourage each other and\nand help to build stuff together so and\nsometimes people find it so\nlike uh you guys are just so happy it's\nlike i'm not
