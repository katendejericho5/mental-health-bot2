are the simplicity\nof do you have people who love you and\ndo you have people you love\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you\nthat come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow now\ntoday i'm super excited because i have\nbeen reading these authors books since\nmy teenage years\nand i found them fascinating they\ntotally inspired me when it came to\nbehavioral science understanding the\nmind how we think how we make decisions\nhow we get driven and motivated and i've\nbeen a fan ever since so\nthis is a true fan moment for me our\nguest today is none\nother than daniel pink he's the author\nof six books\nabout business and human behavior his\nbooks include the long\ntime running new york times bestseller\nwhen which will be dissecting today\na whole new mind as well as the number\none new york times bestsellers\ndrive which was actually the first book\nthat i read from him and to sell\nis human dan's books have won multiple\nawards and have been translated into\n40 languages and have sold more than 3\nmillion copies now\ndan has been a contributing editor at\nfast company and wired\nas well as a business columnist for the\nsunday telegraph\nhis articles and essays have also\nappeared in the new york times\nharvard business review and other\npublications and in 2019\nlondon-based thinkers50 named him the\nsixth most influential management\nthinker in the world\nand he lives in washington dc with his\nfamily and today we're here to talk\nabout\nhis latest book when called the\nscientific secrets\nof perfect timing which i know you're\ngonna love so dan thank you for doing\nthis jay it's a pleasure to be with you\nyeah you literally you were like one of\nthe first people i ever thought of\ninterior interviewing before i even had\na podcast\nand i remember saying to i believe our\nmutual friend\nuh dan chabel who i i believe you know\nwell as well sure of course\ni remember saying to him i was like i\nwould love to interview dan\nand he was like yeah i can introduce you\nto him i can introduce you to him and\nthen i didn't have a podcast there so i\ndidn't interview so we waited but uh\nwe're absolutely worth the wait yeah\nwell thank you so much for doing\nthis i i've genuinely enjoyed your books\nwhat you've helped me understand about\nhuman incentives drive and now timing\nwhich i think\nis the most fascinating i recommended\nthis book uh last year as one of my top\n10 books and uh pushing it out as much\nas i can so i'm excited to dive into it\nbut i want to actually start off with\nsomething that i saw on your twitter\nprofile i think it was yesterday or a\ncouple of days ago where you recommended\nyou actually recommended trevor noah's\naudiobook of\ncrime for a book to study with for high\nschool students and i was understanding\nwhy why particularly that book\nthere's a large presence um uh on\ntwitter of\nand other social media of educators and\nand those are\neducators among the few people who i\nactually enjoy interacting with\non twitter uh and so there was a fellow\nwho i think was a high school principal\nwho was looking for recommendations for\nbooks for high school students to read\nand i thought that um that trevor noah's\nbook\nincluding the audio edition was just a\ngreat choice for high school students i\nmean i i'm a father of a high school\nstudent\nuh my son has my son has read that book\nuh\nfor it's it's just a it's an\nextraordinary\nfirst of all it's it's men it's\nmonumentally entertaining it's just a\ngripping story of this kid\nand i think that what he is telling us\ngives us all kinds of\ninsight into our world today he trevor\nwas the son\nof a black mom and a white dad german\ndad\nuh growing up uh he was born in\napartheid\nera south africa and so simply\nfor for americans especially white\namericans\nhearing about that is just i mean even\nthough you know it it's just kind of\nmind-boggling\num and then um and then what happens\nafter post-apartheid\nhow he decides what he wants to do what\nhis relationships are with his\nmother and father but i actually\nlistened to the audio edition of this of\nhis book\nand it is jay i i think\nthe best audiobook i've ever listened to\nand the reason for that is that is that\ntrevor noah speaks\nmultiple languages um and and so\num and so he goes into some of these\nlanguages but also his ability to do\ncharacters and accents is just\nextraordinary it's just\nit's a virtuosic performance uh and just\na gripping read i can't imagine a 17\nyear old not being\n16 year old not being just mesmerized by\nthat as i was and i'm\nway older than 17. i love that no it's a\ngreat recommendation\ni think that's awesome and it's always\nnice to hear authors and very successful\nauthors recommending other authors and\naudiobooks so\nuh i think that's brilliant now now\nyou've made it really really clear\nthat's that's great tell us about i want\nto start\nyou know about with your fascination\nwith\nhuman behavior and the mind and the way\nwe think and why we\ndo certain things like where did that\ncome from for you because\nyou know like i said you were the first\nperson or one of the first people to\nintroduce\nme into that whole school of thought and\nand i just think like when you're young\nand you're at college or you're at\nschool you don't really\nyou don't really get exposed to these\nkind of topics so where was it for you\nand you know how did that start for you\ni guess i'm not totally sure\ni think part of it comes i i'll i'll\ngive you i'll give you some analysis jay\npart of it i think part of it comes from\nbeing a pretty quiet kid\ngrowing up um i don't i wouldn't say shy\nbut just kind of a quiet kid\nmore of an observer uh a reader a kid\nwho went to the library all the time\nand so just that sort of putting myself\nalways feeling like i wasn't quite\nin the center of things but was kind of\non the periphery observing\nand who was i observing i was observing\nthese crazy people uh and so\nthat i think was i think that was part\nof it i also was fortunate enough when i\nwas in\ncollege to uh to study um\nmy very first uh my very first\nuh trimester in college i took\nintroductory\nto psychology and loved it i studied a\nlot of economics a lot of psychology\nand uh but i ended up i actually majored\nin in linguistics\nwhich is a which is a um which is\nanother social science so i was always\nkeenly keenly interested in it i think\nif i had my\nuh if if i i can totally see in\nretrospect in my life\nthat i would have become a professor\nrather than um doing\num the the noble hackery that i'm doing\ntoday no that's awesome i i it's\ninteresting always how people got to\nwhere they got to and\ni'm fascinated that you haven't fully\ndissected your journey and like broken\nit up into little pieces and i quite\nlike that i think it's\nuh i think it's it's very humble of you\nactually\nwell i i also think it's you thank you\nfor that i'm not sure that it's humble\nas it is accurate i think a lot of times\nthese\nthese they're different vantage points\nin looking at these journeys and i and i\nlike the metaphor of a journey the\ndifferent vantage points in looking at\nthese journeys\nso if you're in it and you're in you're\nyou're you're you're you're navigating\nyour way\nat least for me there was much much less\nintention\nthan one would think um luck\nuh that kind of thing i i think that in\nin some cases\njust because it makes us more\ncomfortable existentially\nwe look back on these things and say oh\nthere was a clear\nnarrative to that journey yeah and there\nmight be i think that that retrospective\nlook is actually valid is\nis is valid too yeah absolutely and and\ni know that you spent a lot of time in\njapan right\nor you've spent some time in yeah i\nspent some time in jail and sure yeah\nwhat's the culture like or what kind of\ninfluences have you taken from that\nculture\noh it's your life yeah it's a a really\nreally interesting question\num probably more profound than i realize\ni think that one of them\nis the virtue of simplicity\num i think that there is a and and you\nand you know and you know\nliving in a japanese zen garden style\nhouse\nthat um that there is in in\njapanese design um in in in certain\nforms of just japanese culture there is\na premium on\nthat simplicity and i think in in in\nmany cases in many realms\nof particularly american in particularly\nkind of\nuh elite well-educated american circles\nuh there is this kind of performative\ncomplexity\ni mean forgive even that phrase\nperformative complexity is an example of\nwell no it's total bs because it's an\nexample of performative complexity\nbasically what it is is that people want\nto feel smart and the way that they want\nto feel smart is by making things really\ncomplicated\nand and and and to me one of the things\ni absorb from spending time there\nis actually the keenest form of\nintelligence is to make things as simple\nas you possibly\nsimple and clear and elegant as you\npossibly can whether you\nare writing a book whether you're making\na film whether you're building a house\nwhether you're raising a family anything\nlike that that there's a virtue in that\nkind of\nsimplicity and clarity so i think that's\nprobably the thing that sunk in the most\nfor me\nthat's so profound i'm so glad you\nshared that actually i i didn't know\nwhat answer you were going to give and\nand\ni either did and i and i love that\nbecause\ni've i've always thought that for a\nwhile like you know i was\nmy all my work is inspired by two\nstatements uh\none statement is uh statement often\ncontribute attributed to martin luther\nking where he said that if you want a\nnew idea read an old book\nand so i have this fascination with\ntimeless wisdom and kind of\nyeah yeah and then the second one is\nfrom einstein and when he said that if\nyou can't explain something simply you\ndon't understand it well enough and\nand so i've always been fascinated with\nsimplification and your work does that\nvery very effectively apart from\nperformative complexity which i believe\ni don't know if you just made that up\nright now but it's a great i did i did i\ndidn't\nhave it because i don't want to ever say\nit again and sometimes i feel like\ni feel this pressure as as a as a\nthinker or a sharer or\nwhatever you want to call us you know i\ni have this pressure of like oh well\nmaybe i'm making things too easy to\nunderstand\nand actually hearing you say that it's\nso like refreshing for me because i'm\nlike\nno i want people to be able to practice\nit and just get it in one you know so\nthat's a beautiful part of culture and\nwhat part of the culture did you\nfeel that was it architecture was it\nlanguage was it\nyou know where was that in the culture i\ndidn't have any mastery of the language\nthat that was hard for me to that that\nwas hard for me although i think there\nis something\nyou know even in the pictorial uh\naspect of the language where a single\ncharacter\na single image represents something\nthat's actually that can actually\nsomething be fairly complex so if you\ntake out some a notion that is complex\nlike\num luck okay there'll be a character for\nluck i know that's true obviously in\nchina that's true obviously in chinese\nas well\num i just i just thought that when the\nuh\nif you if you look at uh even japanese\naesthetics it's it's\nit's even japanese cuisine it's\nunadorned\nit you know like like really good\njapanese cuisine is unadorned it is in\nfrench\nwhere there's like late unlinked sauces\nand all kinds of stuff on it\nisn't you know heavily garnished and\ndisplayed in this grandiose way\nit is pure it is simple it is\nunadorned the the essence speaks for\nitself\nand there's there's um there's a there's\na lot to be said for that even if you\nlook at\nuh like even japanese cuisine where you\ngo into a place\nand all they serve is ramen okay so\nthey're not trying to do everything\nbut they're you're gonna get the best\nbowl of ramen you've ever had because\nthat's\nall they serve um uh and so\ni i think that that has been that way of\nthinking has\nprobably had a bigger effect on me than\ni than i realize in fact in some ways\njay your question is\nmaking me understand that that had a\nthat had a bigger effect because i do\nthink that their clarity and simplicity\nto me are\nare such those are things that i as a as\na\nas a creator and as a consumer a prize\nvery very\ndeeply yeah i mean you're you're a\nphenomenal public speaker as well and if\nanyone's\nnever seen down on stage you just go on\nyoutube and just watch them on stage\nwhether it's\nted or or other events but\nhave you ever reset simplicity or\nclarity out of interest like are they\nthemes that you see yourself writing\nabout or\ndo you ever have you ever been down a\nrabbit hole on one of those and\ndiscovered anything\nfascinating about simplicity or clarity\nbecause i think you're spot on that\nreally those are the two things we're\nalways seeking out right whether\ndecision making or or whether it's in\nhow we feel about ourselves or\na relationship we have in our lives i'm\nintrigued because i\ni definitely studied those for my\nmeditation\nmindfulness right right but i'm\nintrigued to hear about if you found\nanything scientifically that's\nthat fascinates you yeah that's another\nreally interesting question i\ni don't think i've ever intentionally uh\ngone\ngone after that but there is there is a\ndecent amount of\nthere's a decent amount of of research\nshowing aspects of this so for instance\num so so for i'll give you i'll give you\nsomething\nprofound and something mundane okay so\nso on the\non the on the mundane is um\nit's a concept it's a concept uh in\nlinguistics\nuh which is which is known as processing\nfluency\nuh processing fluency and all processing\nfluency means is that\nthe message the words that the\ncommunication you're making\ngoes down easily or all right so so it\ngoes down easily now\nthat's a virtue in and of itself but one\nof the things that we know from\nfrom linguistics and some from some\nsocial psychology\nis that processing fluency enhances\nbelievability not only understanding but\nbelievability and\nthere's a dark side of this of course um\nand so what you see is that things that\nenhance\nprocessing fluency are effective in\ngetting your message across\nan example would be repetition okay we\nknow that right like\nrepetition is effective repetition\nincreases people's understanding it\nincreases their believability\nnow there's a downside there's a\ndownside to that even things like\nrhyming there's some brilliant research\nshowing that that\nthat messages that rhyme are not only\nconsidered more understandable but\nactually\nmore believable alliteration lists and\nthings like that\nso um so we we do know something from\nscience that\nthat clarity and simplicity are\nobviously extraordinarily are\nextraordinarily effective that's the\nmundane\nrhymes increase processing fluency okay\nthe\ni think the more profound thing is that\nwhen you look at say things like\nyour listeners some of your listeners\nare probably familiar with the famous\ngrant study out of harvard where\nuh they followed um uh\na group of men it was at the time as all\nmen um i think was all white men\nin uh graduated from harvard in the\n1940s something like that and they\nfollow\nfollow i might be a little bit off in\nthe years they they they um\nand they follow them through the course\nof their lives um\nuh checking you know a massive\nlongitudinal study they also did it with\num they later did a group of of\nworking-class men all men\nfrom from from boston and um one of the\nthings that you see from the grant study\nis that you know like what makes\nsomebody satisfied what makes somebody\nhappy with their life\nand it turned out that it's completely\nunadorned it's\nbasically do you have somebody you love\nand do you have people who love you\nperiod full stop that's it\nyeah so the the adornment that we were\ntalking about in japanese cuisine that\nlack of adornment in japanese cuisine is\nthat\nour the best lives in some ways are\nunadorned lives that lives that are not\nadorned by\nthe trappings of wealth or performative\ncomplexity\nor um posturing\nor status seeking but are the simplicity\nof do you have people who love you and\ndo you have people you love\nyeah that that that is truly one of the\nhardest things to understand right now\nas well because\nyou know i was literally speaking to on\nanother podcast i was interviewing peter\ndiamandis recently and you know he's\nobsessed with the future and we're\ntalking about how\nyou know he thinks the world's improving\nand the future is changing\nand and like we could we could live on\nanother planet and we could you know do\nall this kind of stuff\nand and it's you know at the same time i\nremember a couple of years ago i got to\nvisit one of the blue zones in sardinia\ni don't know if you've come across blue\nzones as well i'm sure you've done i\nknow i know i've actually ordered i've\nactually there's a there's a there's a\nwine from that\nfrom sardinia the grape i'm spacing out\non what the varietal is i've actually\ngone out and looked\nand ordered wine from sardinia because\num for that very reason oh that's\nincredible okay what a small world so i\ndon't drink so i have no idea what that\nwine is others help you out but\nuh but yeah so when i went there and i\nwas i was you know i lived with\nsome of the people in the town in the\nvillage and i was looking at their\nlifestyles and i also interviewed dan\nbuttner who talks about the blue zone\nand and you know it's\nyou look at that simplicity and you look\nat that you know that stability of like\ngrowing up in a village\nfarming the land natural exercise not\nneeding to do any hit workouts or\nany any weights exercises it is it is\nreally\nreally special to see that and i like\ntrying to entertain the paradox of\nwhat parts of our lives are better\nsimpler and what parts of our lives are\nbetter with some\nand maybe complexity is the wrong word\nyeah maybe complexity not even the\nopposite of simplicity maybe there's\nanother\npoint that's a great point yeah maybe\nthere's another element to\nlike not the opposite of simplicity but\na complementary\nparadoxical version of simplicity that\nbecause i find\nin in and of myself and i'd love to hear\nwhat you think like\ni what i get fascinated about excited\nabout\nis the the correlation between\nsimplicity and then strategy right like\nor like simplicity\nand then like ambition or drive or focus\nand and i find like often today people\nyou know people may connect simplicity\nwith laziness or lack of focus\nor you know that but we are speaking\nwith a much more deeper essential level\nof clarity\nyeah yeah i think that's right um it's\ninteresting there is a\num it's it's an interesting it's it's in\nsome ways a linguistic question no\nno joke uh about like what's the right\nword to describe what you and i are\ntalking about because i feel like you\nand i are talking about something\nwell at least what i think is important\nand quite interesting but\num our vocabulary the or at least in\nenglish might be\nimpoverished and doesn't have the quite\nright term for that\ni think you used a really uh important\nword they're essential\nit's partly about what you know what is\nwhat is what is fundamental and\nand i do think that this idea that that\nwe know\nthat simplicity and ambition can be\neasily twinned\nno question about it i mean you you\nmentioned that one of your guiding\nquotations was from\nwas from uh what was from einstein who\nwas talking about simplicity and he\nended up i mean among his among his\nbreakthroughs were\nwas something that is so profoundly\ncomplex that most of us\ndon't understand it beyond the equation\nwe memorized in seventh grade\nyeah it's very true it is very very true\nand that challenge is real but\ntalking of essentials i i do want to\ntalk about because i think this book is\nso\nessentially driven so for everyone who\nhasn't read it and i have recommended it\nbefore we have\nthis book when that i want to talk about\ni think time is one of those things you\nknow how we\nuse time spend time create time\nwhat we make time for like time is one\nof those things that\nof course is and the way we use an\nessential essential essential part of\nall of our lives and i think when we're\ntalking about\nsimplicity or clarity i think one of the\nbiggest things we\nlack simplicity and clarity on is time\nuh\nand and for me i've definitely noticed\nhow\nover over life especially when your book\ncame out i've tried to remove\npeople from having to live their life\nbased on a timeline\nor an expectation and i realized that\nbecause my life went in a completely\ndifferent direction whereby\ni became a monk at 22 and didn't have my\nfirst job until\n26 uh and today\nlead one of the most meaningful\nfulfilling lives in the world thanks to\nour all my experiences and so it's just\nit's fascinating there were times in my\nlife where i felt like i was behind\npeople that i should be in line with\nthere were times in my life where i felt\ni was ahead of people there were times\nwhen i felt like i was\ntrying to figure it out and i think a\nlot of people usually feel like\nthey're behind ahead or equal to\nand that's kind of how we make sense of\nstuff and that's when this book came out\nwhich i know was like\nmaybe a year ago a year and a half ago\nmaybe a couple years ago\nit's to me that was i was fascinated\nthat you were able to pinpoint\nyou know and go so deeply into time\nwhich i always thought was so much more\nfluid\nand so i guess the first question i want\nto ask you and and please take this\nwherever you like like don't feel\nuh constricted at all because i like\nwhat we're kind of co-creating right now\nwhat fascinates you about time the most\nthat you were so deeply drawn to\nactually write a whole book about timing\nyeah uh so so that is actually um\ni'm gonna put the answer to that in more\nof the mundane category um the reason\nfor the impetus for it was just\nfrustration um more than anything else\nit wasn't any kind of deep\nconceptual fascination so so here we are\nuh\nyou know i'm talking to you from this is\nthis is my office here in washington dc\nit's the refurbished one car garage\nbehind my house i live there\nlike right there um and so you know i\ni would come to my office and and do\nstuff do work\num and at a certain point i realized\nlike i would have a i have a to-do list\nuh and maybe i would have appointments\non the calendar but i wasn't intentional\nat all about when i was doing stuff well\ni would write when i felt like writing\ni would make phone calls when i felt\nlike making phone calls i\nwould do interviews when i felt like\ndoing interview you know um\nand i wasn't intentional about it and i\nsaid that's that's great that's that's\ncrazy like like i i end up\ni i'm actually a fairly kind of rational\ni like to think i am at least a fairly\nrational evidence-based guy\nand and i'm making these decisions about\nwhen to do things i'm not even making\ndecisions i'm just kind of\nstumbling my way into it um and so i\nsaid well there's got to be some\nguidance out there on on\nlike when we should do things and i\nfound to my surprise that there wasn't\nuh and that got me really curious i said\nwell i wonder if there's anybody's ever\nresearched this so i started looking\naround for research and\ninternet there was a huge amount of\nresearch on this question but it was\nsplattered all over the place\nuh it was in literally two dozen\ndifferent domains so it wasn't like you\nsay oh there's a sociologist who studies\ntiming well\nthere might be there is there are but\nthere are also biologists who do that\nthere are economists who've studied that\nthere are\nmicrobiologists who have done studied\nepidemiologists there's a whole field\ncalled\nchronobiology and so what you had was\nyou had\nliterally two dozen different fields\nasking\nvery similar in some cases identical\nquestions and what i said is like\nmaybe you know it was painful but if i\ngo wide enough and deepen up into this\nresearch\ni can begin to piece together the\nevidence-based ways to make better\nsmarter decisions about when to do\nthings\nwhen to do things in a given day but\nalso to your other point jay\num uh when we think about our lives our\nour lives are episodic episodes have\nbeginnings the episodes have middles and\nepisodes up ends this whole idea the\njourney metaphor you introduced earlier\nis like journeys have beginnings\nthey have middles and they have ends and\nit turns out that\nthere is some fascinating research on\nhow our\ncognitive abilities change over the\ncourse of the day and then more\nepisodically\nhow beginnings affect us how midpoints\naffect us how endings affect us\nthere's research on how groups\ncoordinate in time there's research\non how the way we think about time\naffects our behavior\nthere's research again all roads lead\nback to linguistics there's research\nbased on\nthe way that languages configure their\nverb\ntenses it can predict people's savings\nbehavior as crazy as that sounds\num and so um so it ends up being\nsomething that is going back to another\none\nanother one of your words it ends up\nbeing essential it ends up being\nfundamental\nuh because uh we are temporal creatures\nthat is we have\nwe talk about colloquially about\nbiological clocks\nuh about a biological clock but but\nessentially what we have we know from\nfrom biology is that especially\nchronobiology is that we\nessentially have clocks in every cell in\nour body\ni mean we are walking time pieces and\nagain depending on your notion of time\nsort of philosophically existentially we\nare in some ways moving through time\nat the very least our conversation began\nin the past\num that right it's going to end in the\nfuture\nright the people who are going to listen\nto the recorded version of this are\nlistening to something that happened in\nthe past\nbut they had but those people haven't\ndone anything yet because that's in the\nfuture\nand so we're sort of swimming in this\nessential element of our lives\nand so what i was just trying to do is\njust make it\nunderstandable yeah and i think you did\na phenomenal job and so i want to dive\ninto\ndifferent parts of it i guess my first\nquestion is like there's actually\nthere's a few things so\nthe first one is i think the most\ncommon relationship and of course i'm\nmaking a huge assumption here but\ni think maybe we'll agree maybe your\nresearch will say something else\nbut i'd say my assumption is that the\nmost common relationship and i believe\neveryone has a relationship with\nmoney we have a relationship with time\nwe have a relationship\nwith uh anything knowledge wisdom etc\nand so our relationship with time for\nmost people is\ni always feel like i don't have enough\nright that is a\nvery clear relationship that we all\nevery time it's like\ni don't have enough time i i can't make\nenough time i can't\nfind time like we say all these words\nwhich are all about making\nfinding creating having what does that\ndo what is that mindset toward time how\ndoes that actually affect our behavior\nour relationship with time we can think\nof it as an ally we can think of it as\nan enemy in some ways that's over that's\noversimplifying in that case but i think\nif what we're trying to\nand one way to make time your ally\nrather than your enemy\nis to recognize the effect often\ninvisible that it has on\nyour life um so if you look so\nso i'll give i'll give you an example uh\nwhat we know\nfrom let's just take the unit of a day\nwhat we know very clearly from a whole\narray of research is that our brain\npower\ndoes not remain constant over the course\nof a day our brain power changes over\nthe course of the day\nso doing something at 9am is not the\nsame as doing something at 3pm\nperiod full stop now there's some\ncomplexity underneath that\nbut the main idea is that our brain\npower doesn't remain constant over the\ncourse of a day\nand the best time to do something\ndepends on what it is you're actually\ndoing\nso once you understand those kinds of\nhidden invisible rules\nyou can begin to make time your ally\nrather than your enemy\nand end up mitigating some of those\nfeelings that you never that one never\nhas enough time\num so so i think that's i think that's\npart of what it is\npeople who feel like they don't have\nenough time this is not something i\nwrite about but i'll open about it\nanyway\nin many cases people who don't feel like\nthey have enough time\nsometimes not always sometimes it's not\na time it's not a\na sufficiency of time issue it's a\nsufficiency a priority issue\nbut they they actually don't have any\nclarity about their purpose or their\npriorities\nand so they're moving in all kinds\nthat's not always the case but i think\nthat's\nthat's partly the case the other thing\nthat we know is that when\ntime becomes extremely salient in our\nlives\nwe underperform uh and i'll give you uh\nin certain circumstances or we're\nunhappy in certain circumstances so\ni i a great example of that is in\nprofessional services but\nparticularly in the practice of law is\nthe billable hour\num what we know so if you are a lawyer\npracticing in\na law firm not working for the\ngovernment or doing that or non-profit\nor something\nuh you bill yourself out by the hour and\nso what you do is that you have\nyou know a way to well i mean going\nanalog here but you you have on your\ncomputer or\nyou know scribbled down an account of\nwhat you're doing\nliterally in some cases in six minute\nincrements\nuh and what we know from research there\nis that that makes people\nthat is incredibly thwarting to people's\nsense of autonomy\num and so so there are all kinds of\nthings in our relationship with time\nthat if we reconfigure it we can\nfeel a little bit better do a little bit\nmore and better\nyeah that's that that's that's put on i\nthink that makes uh\nthat answer and all the parts would make\na lot of sense i think the\nthe part that i get really interested by\nwhen we start talking about time in the\nway you just did now where you talk\nabout priorities you're talking about\nuh the you know the the ally versus the\nenemy and\nand i i i love that is productivity\neven the goal of time because i feel\nlike today\none of the biggest challenges that i get\nasked at least and and maybe\nyour children experience this or maybe\nwhat i see outside in the world of\nsocial media is\na lot of people today spend a lot of\ntime overthinking\nand procrastinating and that's seen as a\nnegative\nthing and people are often like scared\nof overthinking scared of\nprocrastinating or\nthey judge themselves and then they\nstart getting into this kind of like you\nknow\nuh vicious circle and cycle of feeling\nlike oh like i'm wasting a lot of time\nhere\ntell me about what you found or even\nyour thoughts on on\nproductivity as a goal of time versus\nthe the effective use if possible of\nprocrastination and overthinking\nuh procrastination and productivity okay\nlet's talk about what productivity is\ni'm going to be\nliteral with this here productivity is\nthe amount of units you produce over a\ngiven\namount of time so it is inherently time\nbased because time is in the denominator\nof productivity okay so so\nagain i'm not sure that productivity is\nnecessarily the best\nmeasure i say that as a writer okay so i\ncould be like\nlike i could be a product like\nsuppose i wrote more words per hour\ntoday versus yesterday i would literally\nbe more productive\nbut am i am i a better writer i i don't\nknow it's\nprobably it doesn't matter like what are\nthe words right um and so\nand so in some ways productivity is the\nnotion of productivity in that very\nliteral sense\nis an artifact of our being an economy\nwhere we were producing identical\nmass-produced goods and so efficiency\nwas the\nwas the highest value because everything\nwas the same\nand so what you wanted to do was in a\ngiven denominator\nmake the numerator larger okay that's\nhow you increase\nthat that's a way to increase\nproductivity or keep the numerator the\nsame\nand shrink the amount of time in the\ndenominator so\num so that's what that's what that's\nwhat productivity is i think a way to\num you know a looser way to measure\nthings is\nis quality and and in quality\ncontribution\nimpact those sorts of things uh and\ncertainly for\ncertain kinds of professions like like\nbeing a writer writing more words is no\nmeasure of my\ncontribution to the world yeah so if\nanyone's listening or watching right now\nand it's like\ndan i'm i just feel like i procrastinate\na lot i overthink a lot yeah\nand i waste time what would be your\nresponse to that okay so let's okay so\nso that's the product so that's a\nproductivity thing now let's\nlet's talk about let's not let's talk\nabout procrastination because we know a\nlot about procrastination okay\nokay two big ideas here one\nprocrastination\nis not always bad okay sometimes\nyou're procrastinating for a reason\nbecause you haven't worked it out\nbecause you're still incubating an idea\nokay so it's not inherently bad it's not\nlike all procrastination is bad\nthe second big idea here is that\nprocrastination is basically\nin general the downside the darn the\ndoubt negative procrastination\nis just an emotion regulation problem\nright it has nothing to do with time\nit means that you are unwilling to\nconfront something\nand therefore are not something so\ndisturbing to you\nthat you would rather actually sabotage\nyourself\nthen confront it that in some ways\nyou're making a quasi-rational decision\nthat the pain of confronting man can i\nreally write this\nis greater than actually not\nwriting it in the first place um and so\nso we know this from a lot of research\nprocrastination is an emotion regulation\nissue and so what you have to think\nabout is what is the emotion that you're\navoiding\nand is there a small step is there a way\nin some ways to trick yourself into\neither confronting it directly\nor to do something to just get yourself\ngoing and\nthat in that the action ends up\nconfronting the the emotion\nbut a lot of times but again i just in\ncertain circumstances it's hard to say\nthe fact that you're not ready to start\nis a signal\nthat it might be a very very positive\nsignal it could mean that hey\ni'm still incubating this yeah that's\nthat's a great answer i i i love that\nperception because i think\ni think as soon as you start labeling\nand going oh my procrastination's bad\nand this is not a good place to be in\nyou're right you just\nevery all of that is just avoiding the\nactual emotion which is a signal or a\nsign or an\nalert that's kind of trying to get your\nattention and\nand you just keep putting it away and i\nthink what that leads to and this is\nsomething which i found fascinating book\nis like\nstarting things like i feel like you\nknow\nknowing when to start a business or\nknowing when to start a project\nis like the hardest thing in the world\nand you know i'm sure you get asked this\na million times but like tell us about\nthe research behind starting something\nand\nand what you found was most critical\nthere again\nthere's no there's never there's very\nrarely\nprospectively a perfect time to start\nsomething all right\nbut there are ways to give ourselves a\nlittle bit of a different it's like a\nlot\na little bit of a psychological edge uh\nand this is the work of katie milkman\njason reese and hangchen dai\num they did it at penn at university of\npennsylvania\nand uh they had this idea of of um what\nthey call the fresh\nit's called the fresh start effect and a\nway to understand the fresh start effect\nis like this\nthat certain dates certain days certain\ndates\nare what social psychologists call\ntemporal landmarks\ntemporal landmarks that is they are they\nstand out in time\nthe way a physical landmark stands out\nin space so\nagain back to the journey metaphor\nyou're navigating your way you're trying\nto find your way\noh there's a landmark i know where i am\noh there's that building i have a sense\nof where i\nam temporal landmarks are navigational\ntools in some ways\nbut certain temporal landmarks have a\npeculiar psychological effect\nwhat they do is essentially they operate\nas kind of a restart what they\nsay is that on certain days that are\nfresh start days you essentially\nrelegate your\nprevious bad self to the past and open\nup a fresh ledger on your new self\nall right and so there's certain days\nthat actually are more you're more\nlikely to start something and you're\nmore likely to succeed while starting it\nso what does this mean let's let's be\nconcrete here you want to start\nsomething you're probably better off\ndoing it on a monday rather than on a\nthursday\nyou're probably better doing it on the\nday after your birthday rather than\nthree days before your birthday\nyou're probably better doing it on on\nthe uh\nlike uh the first day of summer rather\nthan three days before the first day of\nsummer\nuh let's say you're uh if one is a\nreligiously observant you know\nuh you know the day after uh or the day\nof a religious holiday rather than\nfour days before that religious holiday\nuh and so you can in some ways\nuse have that sense of where you are\ntemporally\nand pick the right date to start\nsomething yeah i i can so relate to that\nand my my problem is\ni'll try to start something on a monday\ni'll fail on tuesday and then i wait\ntill the next monday\nwell okay so so that's that's that's a\nmixed bag\nthat's a mixed bag it depends on it\ndepends on on how deep the failure was\non\nuh it depends on how deep the failure\nwas on tuesday now there's another\nstrategy for all of this\nyeah please is with which we which i\nmean\nit's reasonably well known and in some\nways it's it's interesting\nbecause i think it's analogous to our\nconversation about simplicity and\nthe opposite of simplicity or simplicity\nand complexity\nuh in that i do think that in many cases\nwe have been\num seduced into the idea of moonshots\nand big hairy audacious goals\ni think that they're important but i\nthink that they're oversold\nin a way and what's undersold just think\nabout it just think about it as a\npricing issue okay\nso the so so the big heriot issues goals\nmoonshots i think they're overvalued\nand i think what's undervalued is small\nwins\nuh and once again there's a lot of\nthere's a lot of evidence of that\nstarting from carl vik\n30 years ago small winds are\nenormously important because what small\nwinds do is that they\nsmall winds can overcome that\nprocrastination problem small winds can\nthen lead to other small winds and other\nsmall wins that cascade into something\ninto something bigger so a strategy for\novercoming\nprocrastination a strategy for many\nthings is to go\nis to go for small wins let me give you\nan example of that so\nso uh one strategy that i um\nthat i've heard of i i mean i just i\ncalled it this it's not originally for\nme it just sort of\nyou know out there i call it j5 not j y\nbut\nj letter j and uh that's just that and\nthat stands for just five more\nokay and so if you don't feel like doing\nsomething you say okay you know what i'm\ngonna do\nuh man okay so i'm so i'm doing some\nresearch right now okay i have these\npapers\nsome of them are incredibly boring okay\nyou know what i can't stand it i want to\nquit you know what i'll just read five\nmore pages\njust five more pages i'll read that okay\noh my god i got a boatload of email here\nugh i can't deal with it i just want to\ngo inside and have a drink\nyou know what i'm gonna just do five\nfive more five more emails and we'll do\nthat\num uh you know what i'm tired of writing\nokay just five more sentences\nthat's it and that you know that\ncan get us going give you a small win\nand what happens a lot of times is that\njust five more becomes just 10 more just\n20 more\nsomething like uh something like that i\nreally like that one that's that's an\nawesome strategy i think that's good\nit's very simple i use it all the time\ni'm not joking around i use it today i\nuse it today\nwhen i looked at my email file and i was\nlike oh god\ni i can't bear that it's okay i'm just\ngonna\ni've already answered enough email i'm\nlike okay just five more\nand you know what i did i just i did\nthat and i got it done and i probably\nended up\nanswering eight or something like that\nanother one a very well-known technique\ni use it i have no shame in using it\nyou're probably familiar with it your\nlisteners are probably familiar with it\nis the pomodoro technique\num which is which is bit you know\npomodoro is italian for tomato\nuh and so um you know you said a\na timer i i have one on my computer uh\nthat i use in on very dark days\nuh i set a timer for whatever\ni do it for 25 minutes and i just can't\nbear this okay i can't\nresearch this anymore i can't read this\nanymore i'm sick of writing\nokay here's what we're gonna do it's 25\n25 minute\ni'm not gonna do anything else i'm just\ngonna do it for that 25 minutes and\nand that can um yeah and that can and i\nthink let me let me extract\nfrom this as always a large theoretical\nlesson\nand it's this all right that a lot of\ntimes\nin our understanding of what makes human\nbeings tick we think that\nbelief precedes action that you have to\nconvince yourself and then\nthat is the impetus to act and in many\ncases\nmore cases than we realize the arrow\nruns in the other direction\nthat getting yourself to act can\nactually trigger the belief\nyes and that's a very very important\nthat's a very very important lesson\nthat that's so true and that's really\nit's it's kind of like when we're like i\ncan't make my mind up\nright like even that saying is exactly\nin that belief where you're just\nspending so much time trying to\nmake your mind up and decide something\nand and\nwhat i love about what you just said is\nis around that whole the small wins\nelement of just\ni always feel like when you can get into\na good rhythm and pattern of keeping\npromises to yourself\nand keeping small commitments to\nyourself you start to trust yourself\nand when you start to trust yourself you\ncan then trust yourself with bigger\ntasks\nthe problem is like you said is that we\ngo for these moonshot goals and\nnaturally we fail at them\nand therefore we don't trust ourselves\nand i feel like self\ntrust is like the big issue when it\ncomes with time\nis that you're like well do i even trust\nmyself with this much time do i even\ntrust myself to complete that\nand you're right about the small wins\nwhether it's making your bed or just\nfive\nmore or you know all of these principles\nthat you're laying out like that just\nbuilds trust with yourself\ni'll give you something else uh that\nbuild trust with yourself that's related\nto this concept\nwhich is uh again is research based it's\nbuilt on uh\ntalked about i've written about this i\nwrote about it in that book\num i've talked about it before is um the\nwork of teresa mobile at harvard\nbusiness school and she found that the\nsingle biggest day-to-day motivator on\nthe job is making progress and\nmeaningful work okay so the days we're\nmaking progress the days were\nmotivated we come back the next day\nfeeling motivated uh but one of the\nchallenges is that is that we never have\na good we often don't have a good sense\nof how much progress we're making\num and so one of the so one of the\nthings that i've done for\nthis is now for like eight or nine years\nnow is\num at the end of every day i have a\nprogram what you know called a progress\nritual\nand all i do is i just basically say\nwhat i what would you get done today and\ni just list what i got done today and i\nkeep a record of that\nuh and i have to say i almost never look\nat the list\nbut it's the act of doing i mean\nseriously i almost never look at the\nlist\nbut it's the act of doing it so i so i\njust take a moment it's a it's a\nit's a it's a ritual all right and you\nknow i don't have to tell you\nformer monk the importance of rituals in\nin in human understanding right so it's\na it's a ritual it's a punctuation mark\nat the end of the day what did you get\ndone today dan\nokay this is what i got done\nokay what what i love that how do you do\nthat\nfor other people so if you're leading\nteams if you've got a small team a big\nteam a company\nhow do you kind of help people realize\nthe progress they're making\nyeah there's something you can do for\nyourself but yeah how do you do it for\nothers\ni mean you could do it you could do a\nver you could do a version of what i'm\ntalking about for your\nfor your team i mean what i would want\nto do is is i would want to get\ni would want to build that habit in\nothers rather than have them rely on me\nfor that i would want to build that\nhabit in others\nso what you could do is you could have\nyou could ask your team send you that\nat the beginning not as a way to monitor\nthem but as a way to\njust as a way to build that habit and\nthen eventually have them continue the\nhabit without sending it to you\num yeah absolutely i'm going to try i'm\nactually going to try that out\ni'm 100 going to try that out what did\nyou get done today just write down the\nthings you get done\ni mean i mean it's a very simple concept\nwe always we often have a to-do list at\nthe beginning of the day\nlike have it done list at the end of the\nday and it's almost like gamifying your\nmind right because you know that if you\ngot\nthree things done yesterday you might\nwant to get four done today so you push\na bit further\nright i think a lot of times also when\nwe're scrambling around we don't have a\nsense of what we what we've accomplished\nsometimes it can be and sometimes it can\nbe um\nit can be affirming so i know that many\ndays where i feel like i haven't gotten\nanything done during the course of a day\ni stop and i do my little progress\nritual again we're talking like\njake 30 seconds yeah\nnot anything elaborate um i'm like oh\noh okay i actually got more done than\ntoday and then on the days where i\ndidn't get much done you're like oh come\non man you gotta you gotta\ndo a little bit better than this come\nback yeah you're coaching yourself\nyou're coaching yourself yeah that's a\ngood way to put it you're in many ways\nyou are what you're doing is you're just\ngiving yourself you know\nyou're coaching if you think about it\nlike a like a like a sport it's like\nlike uh\nlike in in in in track and field or in\nswimming or something like that your\ncoach is there with a stopwatch saying\nhere was your time today okay uh or you\nknow here's how much you lifted today\num you have a sense of you know are you\nmaking progress or you're not making\nprogress\nyeah one i love that one thing i want my\naudience everyone who's listening right\nnow or watching i want you to be aware\nof is that\nliterally dan in this book breaks down\neverything from like\nproductivity i've done some of the tests\nwith you guys before and i've shared the\nbook when we talked about um\nyou know all of the different\nproductivity times for different types\nof people based on what time you sleep\nand what time you wake up\nthe naps breaks i'm not going to ask dan\nall those questions because they're in\nthe book and that's why i recommend the\nbook\ni i want to ask dan stuff that isn't in\nthe book or is extending the book\nand and par i think one of the biggest\nquestions i do get asked that i do want\nto talk about is relationships\nbecause i think dating and getting\nmarried\nand knowing when to either pop the\nquestion or when you should\nexpect the question like these are like\nthese are like some of the biggest\nchallenges in\nin the world for on a personal\nindividual level for people and so\ntell me about some of the work that you\nfound when it came to not just like\nwhen's the best time to get married but\nit's almost like when did people when\ndid\nor what did you find when people said\nthey knew\nor they felt they'd found the right\nperson yeah that one is\nthat one is more inscrutable i have to\nsay um\nuh i wrote about that only very very\ntentatively because i wasn't sure about\nthe the research on that i mean\nit you know what what it says is that um\nin general in america\nmarriages are more likely to last if\npeople get married\nafter age 25 and before age\ni think 34 somewhere around there uh but\nagain that doesn't mean if you get\nmarried at age 35 you're gonna get a\ndivorce you get married at 28. you're i\nmean it's just like there's a slight\nthere's a slight effect there uh there\nis some interesting effects on\num especially in america today uh people\nwith more formal education are more\nlikely to get married and stay married\npeople with less formal education are\nless likely to get married and less\nlikely to\nstay married if they are uh and there's\nalso seems to be an effect whatever your\nlevel of education\non getting married after you complete\nyour education rather than before\nbut again i don't think you take those\nlarge population\ninsights to make a decision about\nwhether you're going to spend the rest\nof your life with someone you love i can\nrecommend a book\nthat is um well one of the leading\nscholars of\nof of marriage um really the social\npsychology of marriage is is that\nnorthwestern his name is eli finkel\nuh he wrote a very good book called the\nall or nothing marriage about how\nmarriage has about how marriage has\nchanged\nuh so a lot of what we know about\nhealthy marriages and also how marriage\nhas changed in america over\nthe last uh 200 years it's a it's a\nreally really i it's a very very\ninteresting book\nall or nothing married yeah the\nall-in-one marriage by eli eli finkel\nwhich uh and\nyou know there's a lot of really good\nresearch uh in there and there there's\nsome relationship advice in there too\num you know among the most important\nthings are um\nyou know what do you attribute to\nsomeone's inherent personality and what\ndo you attribute to circumstance\nso if you're so if your spouse snaps it\nyou say\nuh you say oh my god my spouse is the\nbiggest jerk there ever was or you say\noh my spouse is having a bad day\nand people who make the attribution that\nit's circumstantial not surprisingly\nend up better off than people who say\nyou know\nattribute the behavior to someone's\ninner jerkiness\nright yeah no it would be fascinating\nalso to look at things like\namount of time couples spent together\nbut amount of time couples spend arguing\non useful arguments maybe two yeah yeah\nthere's other there's other there's\nother research out there right there's a\nguy i'm spacing on this there's a guy\nnamed gottman i think\nyeah john gottman yeah yeah yeah he's\ndone some research on on marriage and\nyou know one of the\nnot this is not surprising one of the\nbiggest um\nthings that you see is i if i'm not if\ni'm\ncharacterizing it right is not arguing\nper se\nbut how people argue yes um and\num and so somebody has to do with the\nattribution the other thing one of the\nbiggest signals i think in gottman's\nresearch\nis uh when people express contempt\nfor their partner not surprisingly\nthat's a marker of things gone awry\nyeah yeah you're right he talks about\nlearning how to fight\nis the number one skill needed in a\nrelationship not knowing how to plan\ndate night or\nhow to uh you know just how to\ncommunicate how to specifically fight\nand uh\nyeah really useful one thing i want to\ndefinitely dive into\ntoday is around this and you talk about\nin the book is about\nyou know when's the right time to end\nsomething because i think we're always\nfascinated by\nand we talked about that like when do\nyou know when you should start something\nwhen's the perfect time to start\ni think one of the things we're not very\naware of when it comes to\nbusiness work leases whatever it may be\nis\nending what have you learned and not\njust in the book but what have you\nlearned from just\nyour own life and experience and just\nlike when you found\nis the right time to end something\nthat's a harder call to make\num i think it depends a lot on the\ncircumstances one of the things that\none of the things that one of the things\nthat i do know for sure though is that\nendings are much more important than i\nrealized before i\ndid this research that endings have a\nprofound effect\non our behavior and he's have a profound\neffect on how we remember entire\nexperiences so\nyou know famously um you know this is\nfairly well known is that how an\nexperience\nends has a disproportionate effect on\nhow people remember the entire\nexperience james bond\nyeah all right right so and also even\neven how we evaluate people's lives too\num so there's a famous piece of research\non on where\nthey give somebody a description of a\nfellow who for 29 years was\na wonderful guy great ceo generous and\nwhatnot\nand then uh in his 30th year he\nbecame a jerk and then unexpectedly died\nand they said you know they had people\nsay how moral of a life did that person\nlead and then they had a\ndifferent set of group people evaluated\na different character this character was\na total\nweasel and jerk for 29 years in his 30th\nyear he decided to become a good guy\nbeing more generous\nand then he suddenly died and so what\nthey what they found was that someone\nwho was\na good guy for 29 years and a jerk in\nhis last year\nwas rated as a slightly less moral than\nsomeone who was a complete jerk for 29\nyears\nand happened to be a good guy in his in\nhis final year so\nso so how something ends has a big\neffect on us on um\nhow something ends has a big effect on\non how we remember it how\nuh uh the the presence of ending has a\nbig effect on our motivation\nso when we see the end of something we\nend up kicking a little bit harder so if\nso\na way to a way to get yourself off the\ndime in certain kinds of procrastination\nsituation is to impose an ending\num so and so but endings um endings\nmatter endings matter a lot and i think\nthat one of the things that we need to\ndo in organizations and our family lives\nand whatnot is\nis mark endings and and established\nrituals around endings because that ends\nup being a deep source of meaning for\npeople\nyeah great answer i love i love that\nexample that's that's\nsuper powerful and i think everyone\nneeds to think about that because often\nit's like\nwe put so much what you're saying and\nwhat i'm learning from this and you're\nso right and\ni'm on it's only hitting me now too is\nwe put so much effort into starting\nsomething like so much effort like\nwhether it's a goodness or a\nrelationship or whatever it is like\nwe're excited\nand all these enthusiasm and then when\nyou break up or you end a business or\nyou reject someone or someone gets fired\nor whatever it may be that process is\nalways\nhandled really poorly yeah and and\nand you're so that's actually what\npeople remember absolutely right\nyeah and that's scary to think about\nwhen when you when you think about that\nfor a moment but\nanyway you have been amazing with your\ntime dan i'm really really grateful i\ncan i could talk to you for hours and\nhours and hours you're literally\nfascinating conversation yeah no it's\nabsolutely brilliant and i hope we can\ncontinue to talk offline as well\nuh i'm gonna end with what we do which\nis two rapid fire rounds they're super\nfast you've got to get\nin the blanks for this one so these are\njust okay so time\ntime are you ready yeah awesome time\nshould\nalways time should always um\num be on your mind but not obsessing\nyour mind\nokay good answer okay second one taking\nbreaks\ntaking breaks is one of the\nmost powerful bang for the buck things\nyou can do for your mental\nphysical and professional well-being\nyeah and it's all in the book everyone\nso just you know there's a whole\nbreakdown of breaks\nuh number three every day i must\noh interesting uh well so i'm gonna i'm\ngonna interpret that as\nwhen i say i meaning i daniel yes um\nuh every day i must contribute okay i\nlove that\nyou you excel in your career when\nso this is this is about other people uh\nyou know what i'm gonna use the same\nword here uh other people like so so\npeople excel in their careers when they\ncontribute\ni love it brilliant okay these are your\nfinal five these are answers in one\nsentence all right i'm sweating now\nwell one word yeah okay ready gotta make\nit to the end here yeah\nabsolutely so the one lesson you feel\nhelped you the most throughout your\ncareer\nnot caring what other people think about\nme great answer i love that\nuh what do you want to leave your kids\nwith that you didn't have growing up\na deep and unshakeable work ethic nice\nokay\nif you could create a law that everyone\nin the world had to follow what would it\nbe\num okay this i'm gonna show my\namerican midwestern roots here uh\nsay please and thank you nice great\nawesome okay uh two more questions left\nfourth question\nwhat is something that you know to be\ntrue that many people disagree with you\non so something that you're so sure\nabout\nthat a ton of people were like nah dan\nyou're totally wrong\nthe world is less fair than it seems so\nyou believe the world is less fair than\nit seems\nand people disagree with you on that\nyeah yeah well that's a whole other\nconversation\nwhen i say people i might be reflecting\nmy own kind of biases here but i think\nespecially\num uh well-educated american
