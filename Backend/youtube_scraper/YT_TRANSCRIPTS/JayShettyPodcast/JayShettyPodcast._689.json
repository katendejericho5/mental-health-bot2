attached\nto those opinions that might be wrong\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health and wellbeing\npodcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you that come back\nevery week to listen learn and grow\nand i'm so grateful today because we\ndon't do this often\nbut now and again every uh few years we\nend up having a guest that comes on\ntwice and this is one that i'm really\nreally excited about\nnow this guest who came on last year\ncompletely blew our minds it was one of\nour most\npopular podcasts downloaded last year so\nyou're in for a real treat\nand today's is even more practical\ntactical\nand useful for you so i know that you're\ngoing to get a lot of value\nfrom it so i want to get your pens out\nyour pads out i want you to be taking\nnotes\nand ready to learn from none other than\nray\ndalio in 1975 ray dalio founded an\ninvestment firm\nbridgewater associates out of his\ntwo-bedroom apartment in new york city\n40 years later bridgewater has made more\nmoney for its clients\nthan any other hedge fund in history and\ngrown into the fifth most\nimportant private company in the united\nstates according to fortune magazine\nray himself has been named to time\nmagazine's list\nof the 100 most influential people in\nthe world\nhe's the number one new york times\nbest-selling author of one of my\nfavorite books principles\nand today we will be talking about his\nnew personal discovery tool\nprinciples you which i cannot wait for\nyou to try out and we'll be putting the\nlink for you to try it out\nin the caption and it's built with the\ninsights from his unbelievable career\nand we'll also be talking about his new\nbook the changing world order\nwhy nations succeed and fail ray thank\nyou so much for doing this i'm so\nhappy to be speaking with you again oh\ni'm excited to be back they're always\ngood conversations\nso let's do it yeah last time we were\ntogether in new york city and\nit's a different setup this time i i'm\nover in la i'm\nguessing you are in new york still is\nthat right i'm in connecticut\noh you're in connecticut okay my home in\nconnecticut\nabsolutely beautiful and today we're\ndiving into this fascinating\nconversation\nthat i'm really excited to have with you\nbecause when you first brought this to\nmy attention and your team brought it to\nmy attention\nand i remember emailing back and forth\nwith your team and i was just\nelated because i have found\npersonal discovery tools and personality\ntests to be\nso foundational in so much of my career\nand at times some of the ones that i've\ndone have been groundbreaking for me\nwhich have just\nhelped me focus in on my true strengths\nand talents and skills\nand now as i go on to the next stage in\nmy career and\nentrepreneurship journey of hiring\npeople and building my team we're about\n50 people across the world right now and\nas that continues to develop\ni'm so excited to use this tool for that\nreason but i want to start off by asking\nyou what was the first tool you ever did\nand and what did it teach you about\nyourself or what did you learn about\nyourself\ni'd say it was i don't know 20 25 years\nago um\ni was running the company and i\nunderstood that people were\ndifferent and i got exposure at that\ntime to myers-briggs\nand i gave it to the top 150 managers\nuh and i i re so we got the test rip\nback\ni read the results and in many cases\ni couldn't believe that people actually\nthought the way that they were described\nthat they think\nand yet the they were asked to rate the\nthe\nquality of the rating of them uh from\none to five\nand eighty-five percent rated at a four\nor a five that says that that is me\nso whoa and that prompted conversations\nwhat are you like what it what and\nthat changed everything it had a big\nimpact uh the reason was\nup until the that point people who\nthought differently\nthan each other often got frustrated\nwith each other you know\nthe big picture thinker would and uh\ndealing with the person who paid\nattention to details would get\nfrustrated they'd say you know what are\nyou caught up in the details and the\ndetail\nperson speaking with the big picture\nthinker would say\nyour head's in the clouds you know and\nuh\nwhat we began to realize when we started\nto correlate that data\nwith job performance is that\nuh people excelled in in different types\nof jobs\ndepending on what they needed what they\nwere like and also\nwe were able to put them together to\nwork well together\nthey began to appreciate the differences\nunderstand the differences\nand build from there so that got me\nhooked\nand it was much more valuable than\nresumes i'm not saying resumes aren't\nbut it was helpful for their development\nfor and for us for placing them\nand i'd say that was about 20 or 25\nyears ago\nyeah that's that's incredible and i love\nhearing that it's it's been the same for\nme i found that\nyou know as you dive into these\nunderstandings you realize people\ncommunicate differently people deal with\nconflict differently\npeople connect and create rapport\ndifferently\nand that's what these tools are so great\nat showing us that actually\nideal teams and good teams have people\nof all different types of thinking\nabsolutely and then beyond that\nwell like you took the test other people\ntook the test and\nthey understand now where they are in\nthe population distribution\nbecause they even when they understand\nwhat they how they think\noften they don't fully understand it but\neven when they do\nthey don't know the weaknesses and how\nto deal with the weaknesses\nand they don't know how to deal with\neach other so what we found is when we\nwe you we can take a picture\nwe have diagrams that represent how\nsomebody is in different dimensions\nand when we overlay that on top of\nanother diagram of another person\nwe know how they're going to interact we\nknow what the issues will be\nand we can then build on that so yeah i\nmean it's it's\nlike you i don't know how long it took\nyou to take it maybe 40 minutes or\nsomething i don't know\nthat's what most people take and then\nboom they get it\nso yeah it's invaluable yeah absolutely\nand you've already shared with everyone\ni wanted to tell everyone i i have done\nthe test so i will be sharing my results\nso i want you to keep listening to this\npodcast if you're listening or watching\nright now\ni will be sharing a few insights from\nthe test\nuh from my own reflection and reflecting\non it with ray so that's going to be\nreally fascinating so stick around for\nthat\nbut ray i wanted to ask you how do you\nstart building a tool like this because\nit's it's very difficult and as you've\nseen over the you know the last 25 years\nsince you've been exposed to this\nlearning building you've been\nhiring building teams how do you go\nabout actually building a tool like this\nto make it as accurate as possible\nin a way that you're really proud of\ntaking out to the world right now\nwell we we started then i wanted some\nother tests\nand they would give me different\ndimensions of about a person\nso i wanted those different dimensions\nand then\nwe would use that data to compare with\nhow they were performing in different\ntypes of jobs and uh\nwe're going to get into the dot\ncollector later but that'll be an\nexample\nand so we were we found it very valuable\nand then naturally i was working with\npsychometricians\nabout this partially to understand it\nand then partially to build it and what\ni decided to do\nwas to build one test that would have\nall that the other tests had\nuh plus uh some some some more\num and so i brought on um these three\npsychometricians who were fabulous and\nwe discussed\nuh just built the test and um i'm now at\na stage of my life\num that i'm passing along the things\nthat have been valuable\nso i'm passing it along to people for\nfree so that they could\ntech take it and benefit from it before\nwe share my results and get into my\ninsights i'd love to hear your advice\non how you recommend people approach the\nquestions\nin this test because what i find is that\na lot of people\nwhen they're faced with questionnaires\nlike this they either overthink it they\nanswer too\nquickly sometimes they aren't self-aware\nenough to really put the best answer out\nthere\nhow do you answer this in the most\nauthentic accurate way\nso that it actually helps you with\nself-awareness and understanding\npretty much just uh relax and and and do\nit naturally whatever\nfeels right um we haven't had much of a\nproblem\nwith people um getting to\ngetting either anxious or even trying to\nmanipulate it or anything\nbut if you just answer the questions in\nthe best possible way don't worry about\nperfectionism\nuh there are a number of questions that\nget at the same\nbasic idea and so there's some\ntriangulation\nyou know just go with it and have a good\ntime with them most people have a good\ntime with it\nthat's great yeah no i found that\nsometimes some of these tests people\nare writing down what they think they\nare versus what they do in reality and\nthere's that discrepancy of like how we\nthink we think\nor how we think we behave but actually\nwhen we look at our actions they suggest\notherwise\nso i think it's just gonna like it'll\nask you the equivalent of\ndo you like chocolate ice cream or\nvanilla ice cream you know just\ndon't think about it too much just you\nknow what do you like\nyou know that's that's pretty much it\nthat's that's a good analogy i like that\none and what's your hope for people like\nyou said earlier and we're going to talk\nabout this later about how you're at a\nstage in your career where you're\npassing things on\nthat you've learned what is your biggest\nintention and hope\nthat when someone uses this what are you\nwanting them to get out of it\nfirst of all discovering of themselves\num and then the discovery of\nthe difference in people and the\nrelationships they have with other\npeople\nto make those relationships uh better\nwork better so personal discovery\nwill help them they'll know um what they\nhave\nand what they're missing and by knowing\nwhat they're missing they'll be able to\nsupplement it\nand be more successful and then uh\nin the relationships with others those\nthings that might be confusing or\nfrustrating\ncan be turned into being efficient so\nit's great\nthat's what i hope that's what i hope to\ngive people that's a great hope you said\nto me earlier\ni think before we started recording that\nyou had your wife do it does it help in\nmarriage and relationships too is it\nsomething we can apply to\ndating and should be people using it in\nthose relationships\nabsolutely and and it also helps you\nyou know know how to talk about it\num i i there there was a test out there\nafter we did this uh that one of my\ndaughter-in-laws\nuh had us do over a holiday and\nwe don't use it some part of this test\nbut it was an example it was\nuh the five types of love yes\nokay you know the test yeah um and that\nwas a good example\nyou know how you speak and interact and\nwhat the others looking for\nis very very helpful very valuable right\nyou know it's 40 minutes this isn't like\na big commitment\nso um so people have also had a lot of\nfun with it\nbecause when they take theirs and they\noverlap the others\num on it and the group um this is\nwhat what i gave you and what your uh\nlisteners are going to be able to take\nis a beta version of it which doesn't\nyet have all of the\ninteractions with others yet built out\nwe'll have that\nand if they leave their names uh when we\nhave that other feature we'll get it to\nthem\nbut um we're we're operating that way\nand it's fun\npeople laugh because\nwe had a group session uh with uh family\nand\nuh you know i have four sons four\ndaughter-in-laws and\nand so on and everybody it was funny\nbecause it said oh that's right that's\nhow it works and that's why it works\nin that relationship so they can be fun\nas well as insightful\nyeah you you mentioned to me last week\nwhen we were catching up about this that\nyou even sent it to elon musk and bill\ngates tell us tell us about some of the\nthings that\nsurprised them or something that you\nwant to share about those\nreflections that were useful and\nimpactful for you\nwell i wanted to um\nget the uh profiles\nof a certain type of person a shaper in\nother words\nsomeone who uh was great at\nvisualization\nand then built it out to actualization\nso\nlike elon musk has done or uh\nbill gates has done or you know\nmany people i can rattle off but very\nvery the most\nsuccessful and i wanted to get that\nbecause i wanted to\nhire one of those so what is the pattern\nof the preferences shapers i call them\nwhat is the pattern of the those types\nof people i wanted that\ndna basically and that's what that's\nwhat i got\num so they're all these different\npersonality types\nuh but that shaper has distinctive\nqualities that um only a small\npercentage of the population has it\nbut almost everyone who is doing that\nkind of thing you know visualizing\na business or and um i did it also\nuh for muhammad yunus who won the nobel\npeace prize for microfinance\ni did it for jeffrey canada who is\nharlem children's own built\nthis fabulous institution for dealing\nwith poverty\nthe patterns are clear there's a lot of\ndifferent\npersonality archetypes in your world so\nyou have creators enthusiasts\ninfluencers givers organizers leaders\nfighters growth seekers thinkers so\nanyone who does this test you're going\nto find that and what i found most\nfascinating\nwas when you start going inside of your\nwhat you call the cognitive orientation\nso if you don't mind let's take a deep\ndive in some of my uh\nresults that came out from the test if\nthat sounds like a good idea for you ray\nright now\nuh and and you can guide me through this\nand this is you know i consider myself\nvery fortunate\nuh first of all to be doing this with\nyou personally so i don't take this for\ngranted this is like you know\nsitting down with the sage and the guru\nand the mentor and to\nto be guided personally through this uh\nso when i look\nat my interpersonal orientation so this\nis my sorry this is my cognitive\norientation how you prefer to think so\nmy creative is 99 it's very high\ni'm guessing that's a good thing for\nwhat i do you've pursued\nwhat you're like right um and\na creator um is not better than anything\nelse\nother than uh creating you know um\nso um it may be the opposite of somebody\nwho wants to be\nreally reliable uh\nmeticulous um and is really\nrule-following uh which can be fabulous\nfor certain jobs you want those people\nin certain jobs\nso uh yes that's your inclination you\nlike to let your mind go wild\nand you um you want to have\ngreat imagination and you like creating\nokay the act of creating\num and that feels true to you so you\nthink of it almost like the food you\nlike to eat\nit's not that you know if you ate um\nitalian food or chinese food or indian\nfood or something\nit's not better it just is a strong\npreference\nyeah absolutely and i would have to\nfully agree with that assessment\ni definitely i consider myself someone\nwho\ndeeply is an artist and a creative at\nheart\nbut has had to develop entrepreneurial\nskills to be able to spread that message\nif that makes sense that comes across\nin the other dimensions of your test\nbecause\nin many cases um there are these\ncreators who don't accomplish anything\nand sometimes they just\ndon't have a sense of the practicality\nall that's necessary to be as creative\nas they can or to accomplish as much as\nthey can\nso it's in the mix absolutely and that's\nwhy i found when i look at analytical\nhere\nit says you tend to be methodical and\nprocess oriented\nwith the tendency to rely on personal\ninstinct\nwhen reaching decisions and making\nchoices so my analytical is 60\nwhich i love that it was able to be so\nspecific\nbecause i really do trust my intuition\nin in decision making and i and i\nconsider myself to be an\ninsight intuition person so i like to\nlook at the data\nbut i like to make a decision based on\nmy intuition not based on the data alone\nwell you can hear how that sentence that\nit gave you\num is so clear because and that your\nrating is\nat 60 percent is so clear because what\nit's describing\nis that you are an analytical person\nright you like to do that but\nunlike a person who is totally\nanalytical\nwho may not then deal with that other\ndimension that is part of you that is\nthat other 40 percent you have that\nother 40 percent\nif you were to see that go all the way\nover to that scale\nand you wouldn't have that other 40 it's\na different type of\nanalytical you know what you understand\nwhat i mean\nyeah absolutely you wouldn't have that\nintuition you wouldn't have that\nsubliminal gut intuition element\nas much you would be just purely um\ncalculating and how much do you think\nray like at this i'd love to hear your\nperspective on this having had\nyou know such an incredible career and\nhaving seen this over and over again\nhow much do you think some of these\nthings do need to be developed\nor don't so for example let's say my\nscore\nwas like a 10 on analytical\nwould you be encouraging me to raise my\nanalytical to be more successful\nor let's say it was a hundred percent\nanalytical would you be encouraging\nsomeone to develop\nintuition or is that not how this works\nexplain to us how you see that work\nsuccessfully\nthere are two ways to be successful to\nacquire\nall of the skills and abilities to be\nsuccessful\nthat's the tough way or to work with\npeople who\nare have those things that you are\nmissing\nuh and work with them well and that's\nthe easy\nmost effective way so yes we could try\nto change you\nthe difference is you can move and\nby the equivalent if you work hard at it\nby about one standard deviation of the\npopulation\nin other words yes if you work hard at\nit you can become\nmore and more analytical you practice\nyou exercise it and so on\nyou're to use that example that you're\nusing\nbut you you're um you have to work on it\nyou'll change some\nand so on and and generally uh just\nrealize like you don't need to have it\nall\nright and and if you have a\ncomplimentary relationship you're\nhelping somebody\nwho needs you and now that's usually the\nbest way to do it\nanother one that i'm looking at here is\ni'm just picking out some fun ones\nthat i like so conceptual it says you\nhave a preference to think abstractly\nand philosophically\nusing theories and models to solve\nproblems that is very me and it says 93\nvery high i couldn't agree with that\nmore i\nlove philosophize my my greatest joy in\nlife\nuh comes from two statements so the\nfirst statement\nis by ivan pavlov and he said if you\nwant a new idea read an\nold book so i i really believe that i\nlove going into\ntimeless text and unearthing truths\nand then the second statement that kind\nof defines my work is by einstein where\nhe said that\nif you can't explain something simply\nyou don't understand it well enough\nand so for me i like to try and find\nsomething that is really complex or\nintricate and detailed from the past and\ntry and\nreally extrapolate the essence from it\nso that i can share it with people\nthat's kind of where i get my joy\nand buzz in life i can hear that in you\ni can empathize with you by the way\nbecause my\nmine is quite similar my testing and my\ninclinations are quite different\nquite similar to that and then and you\ncould hear the passion and we could feel\nthe passion\nand then we also have to understand that\nthere are other people\nwho are exactly the opposite and get\ntheir passion from something different\nyeah no absolutely and and and there's\nyeah i've also met people you're right\ncompletely the opposite\nwho actually love making things more\ncomplicated and intricate\nand mystical yes you can see where\npeople go\nin a conversation you will see do they\ngo down to the detail\nand can they separate the detail do they\nwant the detail\nwhen they want the big picture um\npsychologists also call that\nhelicoptering\nyou know um there everything has\ndifferent\nlevels like google maps it's equivalent\nconceptually\nof google maps so if you go up\nand you're looking down the picture is\ntotally different from that level\nand then you go down into it so people\nare either inclined to be in one level\nor another\nor some can navigate from the detail\nto the big picture to the detail like\nwhen elon musk gave me uh he gave me his\ncar to drive this one this was\nway back when it sort of first came out\num\nand um he was able to navigate it showed\nit up in his testing and everything\nso he would pay um tremendous attention\nto detail\nhe showed me then the car and how uh the\nbutton and\nyou push this and the trunk opens and\nthis does this and\nand so he was like a jeweler with\na piece of jewelry in terms of that\ndesign the detail\nand then he goes back to the big picture\nand we were talking about like going to\nmars\nand humanity over a period of time he\nwas able to navigate both of those\nthat's a rare occasion by the way\nbecause people don't always\nbut there are those different levels and\nyou can see in the conversation\nwhere people tend to gravitate to\nabsolutely and\nwhat you're saying is if someone is\nactually using this tool in their\ncompany\nor in their family or in their teams\nthen actually they don't just have to\nrely on reading people and what they're\nsaying and hearing\nthey can actually have a framework that\nsupports that where they can find the\nparallels\nyeah so we connect it to the dot\ncollector for example\num put those profiles on\nand then they when they're interacting\nthen they're aware of those profiles and\nit helps yeah i saw that great video you\nmade\nuh on youtube about the dot collector\nwhich i highly recommend everyone goes\nand watches as well\nuh if it's available to the public but\nthat video really explained it well and\nwhat i found fascinating about the doc\ncollector let's talk about it seeing as\nyou mentioned it there\nis we're spending all of our days on\nzoom right now\nevery single one of us even us doing\nthis interview right now and you were\ntalking about just how\nthere's so many people who have so much\nto say\nwho are not necessarily even the people\nspeaking at that moment in time\nthere are so many notes being missed\nthere's so many in between the line\nmessages that are lost\nin communication and you've created this\nsoftware to be able to actually capture\nall of that\nand then share that data in a way that's\npractical and applicable and\nactionable yeah um i'll give you a\nlittle\nbackground yeah i um i created it\nin bridgewater so um i\nit what people will see it uh to take a\nit allows people to express what they're\nthinking\num about people about what they're\nthinking on an ongoing\nbasis um and then it allows questions\nand answers to go back because what\nbothered me was only the people who\ncould\ntalk could i get the ideas from and so\nthere's a big bottleneck\nand also i wanted an idea meritocracy\neverybody to be able to speak up and i\nwanted everybody's thoughts so that was\nthat\nand i also like the tests wanted to\ncollect the data\nso that with that data they could on a\nday-to-day basis\nsee how their what they're thinking the\ndata\nis collected so they know how they think\nagain\nand also uh it's been fantastic for\ndaily 360 reviews because everybody is\nworking with their\num with others and they're getting\nessentially a 360 review simultaneously\nso you don't wait to the end of the year\nfor\nthe feedback you're getting that on an\nongoing basis now\nat this stage of my life one of the\nthings i'm doing\nis trying to help others um who are\nrunning companies and so on so\num eric yuan who uh runs zoom and his\nteam\nruns zoom he he started it he's running\nit um\nhe asked us all to help and uh because\nit had such a big effect on them\nhe's having it integrated into zoom\nso we expect in january when you go on\na zoom call like this they'll be\nattached to it\num this dot collector and it'll allow\npeople to\ndo what i've just described yeah that's\nawesome i love hearing that that's\nbrilliant i\ni think we need to make our technology\nfar smarter and it's great to see\nyou adapting so quickly to bringing\nsomething out like that that's going to\nhelp teams function because\ni'm doing so many corporate events right\nnow i speak\npotentially nearly a company a day at\nthe moment because of the\nchallenges that people are having with\ntheir mental well-being their stress\nlevels\ntheir disconnectedness lack of\nengagement of working from home\nand and i think this tool is one of\nthose that can really act as a\nhuge solution right now at least the\nright direction\nto give an example like you go in you\nhave a conversation like this and\nthere's a group conversation\nand you go away and you go on to the\nnext thing\nand nothing is saved and you don't know\nwhat everybody's thinking\nokay that's the way it normally is\nabsolutely\nthat's no good okay just imagine\neverything is saved and that it's clear\njust imagine\nyou could take a summary of that meeting\nand you could pass it to somebody and\nthey could hear whatever they\nwant to in that meeting and and okay\nthat changes things so for example um\none one of the ceos in a big company\nwho's running it we did the\nsame thing with him then afterwards\nwe took the print out of what was\nwhat happened in that meeting and then\nwe went through that\npoint by point and we discuss that\nand then it's data that goes in\ndata is powerful you know\nyeah but some people get a little bit\nnervous about it and so on it gets a\nlittle\nyou got to get a little um used to it\num because as you know uh\nabout psychology we were talking about\nthis before\nuh in every person there were two u's\nright there's the upper level you which\nis\nconscious the conscious you that is\nuh and you could be logical you could\nreason\nthen there's the subliminal you which\nyou actually don't get to see it's\nit's not conscious to you and it has its\nown\ninclinations and it's emotional or maybe\ninspiration things that come from the\nsubconscious\nand all of those things are operating to\ndetermine your behavior\nand so by being able to take your\nanalytical\nyou and to then collect the data and use\nthat\nso sometimes people have emotional\nbarriers\nnot not that it's logical um almost\neverybody\nwho looks at this uh these things finds\nthem very logical but\nit might get a little bit used to okay\ncan you be can you give somebody\ncritical feedback\nhow do you react to critical feedback do\nyou want facts\nthis is another dimension we were\ntalking about this last time we talked\ndo you want to know what's true can you\ntalk about what's true\nthese are other dimensions to it so the\npotential we're living in a world now\nin which there's an op an opportunity to\nknow what's true\nevidence-based through data okay\ndo you want to know what's true\nif you know what's true it's a\nfoundation for making great improvements\nbut some people do you want to know what\nyour weaknesses are\nthere's a power from knowing what your\nweaknesses are of course\nyou want to but you have to get yourself\ninto also that psychological state too\nso they work together like i found the\nreason my company\nwent from nothing to\nquite something as you point out the\nfortune said the fifth most important\nprivate company in the country\num was that in other words to get at\ntruth\num meaningful work and meaningful\nrelationships\nbeing on a mission together to achieve\nsomething great\nand then the relationships but to\ndo that through radical truthfulness and\nradical transparency\nso we can take people's strengths and\nweaknesses\nand work with them to achieve that much\nhigher level\nof performance yeah no i i'm totally\nwith you i think having data\nto measure the subconscious reactions\nactions responses is phenomenal\nbecause that's far more interesting and\nactually that conscious version of\nourselves has been so\nconditioned and has become so default\nthat it can often actually hold us back\nfrom a completely collaborative team or\na completely\nuh high-performing team because that's\njust been the way we've worked for so\nlong and so all of it is lost in\nnot noticing the subconscious so that\nthe fact that that's being measured is\nis brilliant it's really useful it's so\npowerful\notherwise it's all buried in subliminal\nthings that people don't talk about\nyeah not not good yeah and i love what\nyou say about wanting to know the truth\nbecause there\nthere has to be some courage to face our\nweaknesses\nand truly honor our strengths i find\nthat you know we've grown up in a\nsociety of\ni've talked about this before right\nwhere i went to a high school\na very competitive good high school back\nin england\nand the school would rank us in\norder of number one to number number 180\nof all the students in every subject\nevery year\nagainst our peers and so you would get\nto see that\nuh and that was useful but what was\nmissed there was what you're talking\nabout this subconscious potential this\nhidden potential\nyeah what what what what people don't\nunderstand\nis that they think how good they\nare is in that number yes\nokay and what they lose\nis um the power of\nmistakes and weaknesses that's why one\nof the reasons why\nacademic success is very poorly\ncorrelated with\nsubsequent success in life and so people\nbecome\nattached to what they know the one i\nthink the greatest tragedy of mankind\nit's a big statement the greatest\ntragedy of mankind\nis that people hold opinions in their\nheads\nwhich are wrong that they could so\neasily\nstress test but they're so attached\nto those opinions that might be wrong if\nthere's a disagreement\num then somebodies must be raw\nhow do you know that it's not you and to\nbe able to learn\nif you're attached to knowing you don't\nhave a capacity to learn\nif you're curious and you focus in on\nwhat you don't know\nand you're excited about not knowing and\nlearning then you have you will learn\nmore\nand you'll raise your chances of coming\nup with a good answer\nso that whole dynamic as you're dealing\nwith\nit is am i worthy am i good\nand i don't want to look at my mistakes\ni don't want to look at my weaknesses\nis one of the great tragedies of our\ntime\nyeah i couldn't agree with you more\nthat's a really bold statement but but\nyou you backed it up well so i uh\nuh i'm definitely one who agrees with\nyou and i want to move back to\nsome parts of my test because i still\nwant to get your insight on it\num this one is this section on\ninterpersonal\norientation so how i engage with others\nright\nuh and my extrovertedness is 97\nand the definition is you tend to be\nengaging and outgoing\nyou thrive at the epicenter of social\nactivities and are socially bold and\nadventurous so\ni'll share something that's interesting\nabout this i agree with that\nhighly very much agree with that at the\nsame time\ni love being alone more than being\naround lots of people\nso i i get a lot of energy from\nseclusion and solitude and\nuh being in silence and i crave that\nalmost and i try and\nconstruct my days in such a way that i\ncan\nhave more of that so how does that how\nis your i'd love to hear your\nunderstanding of\nextroversion and introversion and how\nwhat i just shared with you\nfits together in a very natural way what\nhappens is you have\nthe um your natural inclination\nis to do those things that were\nmentioned\nand it described you very well and then\nyou like your\nlike me also meditate\nor or understand the\nuh power of the rejuvenative\nnature of that experience and also\nwell we both meditate and so we\nunderstand\nthat what it's like to go into the\nsubconscious\nand uh to refresh ourselves\nand how that balance\nthen gives us the energy and the\nequanimity\nto come back and to do the other so\nthat's how it works you've experienced\nit you describe it\nand that's basically what it's picking\nup in you in terms of\nthe the excitement there will be\npeople who will be very different from\nthat\nuh meditation is something for example\nor going within\nis something that is beneficial to\neveryone\nbut at the same time when you\num there are many people who wouldn't\nwant to do the things that\nthey just described you wanting to do in\nother words you\nwant to you will go into a group you get\nyour energy with that you will\nnaturally be there there are people who\nare\nintroverted who would say that's the\nlast thing in the world that i want\nso you're naturally as described\nand then also using that in the way that\ni use that i'm i'm\ntested and i'm uh very much exactly like\nyou\nand and i experience that i love hearing\nthat it's very reassuring hearing that\nfrom you and\nand i know that meditation's been a huge\npart of your practice and\nwe'll come back to that towards the end\nof the interview i want to dive more\ninto that\ni this was fun uh how i engage with\nothers it says that\ni am 81 caring so you have a strong\ndesire to prioritize\nand support others needs are fascinated\nby their behaviors and tendencies\nthough tend to be less sensitive to and\ncaught up in their emotions and feelings\nuh so that was that that was interesting\nto me i was like yeah\ni consider myself to be an empathetic\ncaring individual\nat the same time and to compare that to\ni'm also 68 on the tough scale so you\ntend to be willing to debate\nyour and others ideas and perspectives\nshare criticism openly when warranted\nbut tend to be more diplomatic and\nnuanced than blunt\nand direct in your style and that i\nfully agreed with too that i don't\ni've never believed that being rude\nor being angry\nwithout control or you know to just be\naggressive\nis ever useful but to to really share\nthings in an open way without\nbeating around the bush is really my\nvery much needed so i like that\ncomparison between tough and caring well\ndo you see\nhow uh it really picked up the subtlety\nof it that's\nthose sentences were written\nspecifically for that mix of\nuh attributes and and tailored that way\nbecause it's saying um that you are\nthis way but you're not this way and so\nthough that sentence\nwas a very apt um um\nvery sophisticated or subtle um\nuh finessed kind of description\nof what that means for you and there's a\ncontinuum there you see\nthat somebody might be they might be you\nknow just\none way or another right but you so yes\nyou are direct you are strong um\nyou you want those things and while\nyou want those things um and\nyou're deeply caring okay that\ncaringness does not mean that\nyou're going to shy away from\ntalking about difficult things to talk\nabout\nbecause you feel that you need to well\nyou can hear that's captured you and\nthat's\na very important difference than\nsomebody who might be\nalso not you know caring\nbut cannot talk about the difficult\nthings because\nthat makes it it's very difficult for\nthem to do\nand there are many people who are like\nthat and so they in the test\nwould have a description that would say\nand you find\nit difficult to talk to people about\nsuch things and resolve them\nthat's the power of the test what i've\nwhat i found\nso unique and powerful about this test\nespecially this point that you've just\nagain\nre-emphasized to me and highlighted to\nme is that that subtle nuance\nplays so deeply into my self-awareness\nbecause\ni believe i'm someone who likes to\nembrace polarity\nso i believe that being spiritual\nand being strategic need to work\ntogether\ni don't believe it's either or i don't i\ndon't think you can say i'm i'm just\nspiritual i'm just strategic for me it\nhas to work together\nor when i hear people say like oh you\nhave to be affectionate or assertive and\ni'm like no no\ni'm both of those things like i want to\nbe affectionately assertive\nand so to me i've always wanted to\narticulate and share more that i believe\nin embracing polarities\nand this picked up on that which i found\nfascinating because\nit's such a key integral part of how i\nsee myself\nand the fact that it could get right in\nthere uh is is really truly powerful\nand think about that what that means for\nthe people that you have relationships\nwith\nthen when you give it to them and they\nsay this is a description\nbecause you could just go check i\nbelieve it it's powerful here you\nunderstand\nthey're understanding you they're\nunderstanding what you're doing\nwhere you're coming from and you could\nunderstand when they give you\ntheirs you can understand that and all\nmake sense\nyeah absolutely for everyone who's\nlistening and watching right now if\nyou're ever speaking to your partner or\nyou're speaking to a colleague\nand you're wondering why they don't tell\nyou it how it is because that's how you\nrespond\nif you do this activity with them you'll\nbe able to see how they deal with\ndifficult conversations how they're\ncaring and how their caring style comes\nacross\nand this one for everyone's listening\nand watching i want you to tell me if\nyou agree or disagree so my\nmy humor score came back and my humor\nscore is 63\nit says you tend to be more joyful and\nlight-hearted\nthan serious and intense 63 is pretty\naccurate i'd say i\ni like to be quite sober too my wife has\nbeen pushing me in the more\nlight-hearted and joyful because that's\nwhat she is\nand i'm pretty sure if we dialed this up\nfor her it would be like 99\ni can't wait to send it to her uh but\nbut anyone who's listening or watching\nright now you can tell me if you think\ni'm funny or not you can tag me and rey\non instagram as well\nat j shetty at ray dalio tell them\nwhether you think it should be more than\n63\nor less than 63 uh but that was a fun\none\nto see in there again right uh the next\npart is called motivational\norientation uh which just for everyone\nwho knows describes how you manage and\napply yourself\nas challenges of face so i'm interested\nin this\nuh composed said 99\nvery high you tend to remain calm\nconfident and controlled\nunder stress or pressure uh i i feel\nvery grateful\nto have been trained in that ability\nthanks to meditation\nuh thanks to my time as a monk and it\nfelt very\nit felt very reassuring to to see that\non paper\nwell yes and it and it's you\nand you see how this composite then adds\nup to you\nright so um you're creative you have the\ncaring but you're strong\num you'll talk about those issues and\nthen\nyou know you're in a position where\nunder stress you'll be calm and so on\nwow this is painting a very rich picture\nbecause there are some people who\nyou know stress is not good for and you\nwouldn't want them to be in that\nparticular situation that you might\nwanna\nthey need help absolutely and this one\nreally resonates so it's really\ninteresting i'll share this with you\nso the composed aspect is what i gained\nfrom being a monk\nbut the next thing i'm going to share\nwith you is what stopped me from\nremaining a monk so my autonomous is 99\nso you are independent self-motivated\nand hold yourself accountable for\noutcomes you experience\nbut that independence is what broke me\nout of living as a monk because i could\nno longer\nadhere to the rules and practices and\nand feel that that's how i wanted to\nshare the wisdom and so\nit's interesting how experiences in our\nlife help us\ngain certain skills like that composure\nbut then also our natural inclination of\nautonomy which is very high in me i know\nthat for a fact\npushes you out of it too yeah and then\nthis is great flexible 99\nwhich i found this one was really\nfascinating so status seeking\nyou have a moderate preference to please\nuh and keep up appearances be liked\nadmired and respected so i was 50\nmoderate which i was actually really\nhappy\nthat that was actually measurable so i\nalways say to people i\nbelieve it's really important to uh\nyou know show up be there be present be\nrelevant\nbut at the same time you're not that's\nnot your governing factor that's not\nyour anchor\nthat's not why i do what i do but i\nrealized the value of it and the fact\nthat it was able to hit it 50\nthat was that was mind-blowing to see\nthat uh\nthat level of that level of accuracy\nso these these sentences literally feel\nlike they were written directly for me\nand by the way just so everyone knows i\nreally do believe in the horoscope\neffect where\nif you think something's written for you\nit is you but having done a lot of these\nexercises and having spent a lot of time\ndoing self-awareness\ni can promise you that this is not the\nhoroscope effect\ni'm reading these statements and feeling\nvery well\nunderstood uh and and deeply understood\nso i just want to throw that out there\nray because\nthe horoscope effect is real um but but\nthis is not that\nuh and the way that we test it is uh we\ngo back\nyou you we sometimes we blind test it\nand we say who is this person and they\nget oh that's that person\nand and you get the triangulation no\nit's\nyeah it's the real deal yeah\nyeah so and it's 40 minutes and wow\nand it's free so yeah it's it's awesome\nso yeah no i i absolutely love the test\ni highly recommend it to everyone i\nthink it's a great conversation starter\nwith your partner\ni think it's incredible to do with your\nteams i think it's phenomenal to do in\nyour companies\ni was saying to ray when we spoke about\nthis last week that my hope is that my j\nshetty certification school\ncan adopt this and use this in our\ncoaching school\nis one of the tools that we recommend to\npeople because we want people to gain\ntheir self-awareness\nand what better way than to have a\nreally accurate like you said 45 minutes\n120 questions it did not feel like that\nat all it was\nreally i love doing these things and i\nlove reading the results even more\nand i couldn't recommend it more to each\nof you for your relationships your\nfamilies your teams\nyour companies depending on what level\nyou're at in the company but i'll\ndefinitely be recommending this to the\nto the ceos the executives that i work\nwith in my work and coaching work\nand we're going to put the link for all\nof you to try out so this is the beta\nversion\nuh i believe that ray is giving us\naccess to and so we're very grateful to\nray and the team at principles you for\ndoing that\nfor us and so i want each and every\nsingle one of you that are listening to\nthis\nif you've been fascinated by learning\nabout my answers\nand seeing how me and ray have been\nreflecting i want to see yours so head\non to instagram\nshare your archetype share your insights\nof what you learned\nand tag me and rey on instagram because\nwe want to be able to see\nwhat is it that you learned about\nyourself and then i want to keep you\nmonitoring\nand i want you to come back and tell me\nsome stories about how this has impacted\nyour relationships and your companies\nand if you record it and send it to us\nwe will put it on a future episode as\nwell\nso i want to gather some qualitative\nresponses from you as well as\nquantitative so\ni want to throw that out there for\neveryone who's watching well then let me\nsay thank you very\nmuch because you know my goal is to pass\nit along and make it as good as possible\nto people\nand if you all give that kind of\nfeedback\nin this beta test it'll all make it\nbetter and better\nand it's better for everyone so wow that\nwould be\njust great awesome thanks ray so ray i\nhave to ask you before we move on to the\nnext part of the interview i have to ask\nyou so if you were hiring me for a role\nin one of your companies what would be\nmy role\nwhere would you put me based on what\nyou've learned i'd have you as\na my strategic partner\nin other words okay big picture where\nare we going\nuh you know how do we get there um and\nthen\ni think you'd be extremely effective in\ndealing with people\nbecause okay you understand all of those\nthings\nthat that mix that you have between on\nthe one hand uh\nbeing able to deal truthfully with those\nissues\num and not shying away from that but to\nbe able to do that\nwell and to keep their well-being\nas paramount importance in their\ndevelopment and so on\nare qualities that you have that would\nbe your inclination but i'd also need to\nsupplement you\nyou know as everybody else and that\nwould mean\nthe people that would um work with you\nto help on the implementation\ni wouldn't want you to get caught up in\nthe details\ni wouldn't want you to um necessarily\nrely on all the precision\nand the accuracy and all of those types\nof things\nthank you very much i appreciate that\nthat's that's great to hear i know i\nhave a job lined up\nif i need it\n[Laughter]\nbut no that's that's awesome it's really\ngreat to hear that and i agree that was\ngoing to be my second question\nwho do you think i should be surrounding\nmyself by\nto be more effective and productive and\nyou answered it just there and then that\nhaving people around me that are highly\ndetailed oriented\nimplementation oriented people who can\nbring that vision to life\nand i couldn't agree with you more i\nknow i'm on the search for them in my\ncompany right now so\nvery much aligned with that uh and and i\nwant people to know i\nreally felt a great degree of accuracy\ndoing this now ray we've talked about\nthis before\nyou're at a stage in your life and and\nyou said it very wonderfully to me the\nother day you said\nyou know i'm at a stage in my life i'm\ntrying to share what i've learned\nuh we see you doing that with principles\nnow with principles you with the dot\ncollector with\nyour new book that's coming out called\nthe changing world order why nation\nsucceed and fail\nand what i love about the way you do it\nand you beautifully said this you were\nlike you know when when you get to\nyou you're saying that we share it but\nyou said when you get 71 you want to do\nit faster and i thought\nwhat a what a you know what a beautiful\nway to\nlive uh that you're living with such\npurpose and service and you always have\nuh but you're continuing to do that\ntoday and we're benefiting from it\nbut what i love that you have the\nability to do based on your experience\nand background\nis you're able to go from these micro\nindividual\ndeep personal topics to then\nscale and like you said the helicopter\nkind of method\nof then talk about these really macro\nglobal\nnational issues and challenges and\nand you have not just the authority and\nexperience but you have the\ninsight to be able to speak about these\nthings and so your new book the changing\nworld order\nwhy nations succeed and fail which you\ncan pre-order right now if you're\nlistening to this episode the book is\nnot out yet but it will be out soon so\nyou can pre-order it on amazon\nuh you talk about these three really\nfascinating concepts we talk about a lot\nbut i want to dive into these three\nimportant concepts and the first one is\nsomething that rings really true for\npeople right now\nuh and and we'll see the crescendo but\nwe talk about the\nfinancial challenges and the financial\nissues that society is currently facing\nonly amplified by\nthe pandemic and the the craziness of\n2020\nuh and and i was i was intrigued to hear\nwhat you felt is what's going to make\nnations financially succeed and fail\nas the future unfolds where does our\nfinancial\npower history and legacy lie and how are\nnations going to fail or succeed at this\nvery important metric\nwell i'm happy to ask the question i'll\nanswer it i just wanted\nuh to also clarify um\nthat i'm writing the book and i'm\nputting in\nmy drafts of all the chapters they're\navailable on linkedin so\nif you really want to uh read the book\nas it's being written\nuh you go to linkedin and you can\nget it as it's happening and it doesn't\ncost you anything so that's a\npossibility if you'd like to\ndo that you can understand it\nthere are um there are three big things\nthat\nare happening in our lifetimes or right\nnow\nthat didn't happen in my lifetime before\ndidn't happen in our lifetimes before\nuh but happened in history and uh\nuh it was interesting to me over my\nyears\num that um that uh that my surprises\noften came from things that didn't\nhappen in my lifetime but happened\nbefore in history and\nthose three things that are i'm\nreferring to and by the way all happened\nin the 1930s\nwere first with financial\nand and debt and that means when\nthere was a lot of debt and interest\nrates\nwere pushed down to zero percent and in\norder to stimulate the economy\nthe governments had to produce a lot\nmore debt\nthat the central banks had to\nprint money to buy that debt\nthat coming to the end of a long-term\ndebt cycle\nis happening now it's we're in that era\nit has big implications for the value of\nmoney and who gets money and so on\nand the last time that happened was the\n1930s\nso i'll explain that those implications\nin a minute but i want to get to the\nsecond of those\nbig influences the second of those big\ninfluences is large\ngaps in wealth\nvalues and politics i can measure the\nwealth gap the income gap\nthe political gap statistically i show\nit i know it and we have not had such\nlarge gaps you have to go back again to\nthe 1930s to have that those types of\ngaps and we see it every day\nand that me has real implications\nit has economic implications such as\nwhat will tax policy be\nwhat will um spending be what will we\nput as our prioritization\nso it affects us every day but it even\naffects how are we dealing with each\nother\nuh we have gotten almost to the point\nof having irreconcilable differences\nand being in a position where there's\nwinning at all\ncost and history has shown\nthat that is a very threatening type of\nsituation that\nit's the brink of civil war and\nrevolution\nwhen there's not enough respect for the\nsystem\nor enough interaction so it's a risky\nreally\nrisky point that we see every day what\nhow should we be what are our values all\nof\nwhat does that mean for taxes you see it\nred states and blue states\nand the differences and that has\nimplications\nfinancial economic and so on and the\nthird\nfactor is the rise of a great power to\nchallenge\nthe united states as a great power um\nand that\nagain in the 30s for example there was\nthe british empire\nand then germany and japan grows and\nwere able to challenge\nand and that led to conflicts and\neventually led to war um we\nnow have for the first time in this\nuh order this world order which began in\n1945\nwhen the end of world war one we began a\nnew system\nwas the american system put the dollar\nat the center of that system\nin america and the american world order\nrules\nwho were american and that um\nis now uh there's the emergence of china\nand so we're having conflicts of china\nthere are five types of major conflicts\nthat always happen over and over again\nand we're experiencing that they call\nthem wars there's a trade war\nthere's a technology war there's a\ngeopolitical war\nthere is a capital war and\nthere is a military buildup and so on\nand so how a lot of things are going to\nhappen how\ntechnology will unfold how capital and\ntrade will\nbe which will affect us all is\ninfluenced by that\nso those three things happened\nover and over again so i studied the\nlast 500 years of history to see the\npatterns\nand i learned a lot about those three\nthings and how they relate to each other\ntells us where we are and gives us some\ngood ideas\nof the risks and opportunities of what\nmight come\nyeah no those three are so\ninteresting when like you just said are\nbeing faced at the same time\nwhich makes it such a unprecedented time\nas we hear\nover and over again what is the root\nof solving or finding a solution within\nall of those three because it's almost\nlike all\nroads point to like a bad space or like\na negative outcome\nwhen you hear those three things the\nfinancial problems we're at each other's\nthroats as you've said\nthe opposition power rising what is the\nsolution in it or what are the what are\nthe ways or alternative paths that we\ncan take\nuh as as a nation as countries across\nthe world to\ncreate more uh harmony well that's\num the great thing about the lessons of\nhistory is\nit's not unprecedented it's only\nunprecedented in our lifetimes\nyes we can look back over theirs and you\nsee these things happen\nover and over again um and so there\nare lessons for example on the war\nissue uh there were 12 there were 16\ntimes where there were rising powers\nthat challenged existing powers in 12 of\nthose times\nthey had wars in four of those times\num they didn't have wars that they\nworked it out\nand and so you could see societies that\ncame close to civil war\nor wars internationally the big\nthings are two big things\nhow the people deal with each other\nrecognizing what whether this is a\ncommon challenge and they recognize\nthe need to find the common solutions\nthrough working together to find those\ncommon solutions\nwith the recognition and the horror of\nknowing\nwhat the the these wars are like\num it so fear of those\nwars um understanding those wars\nanybody who went through those wars and\nsaw those things up close\nknows that they never want to have\nanything like that again but\nunfortunately\nthey've those people have passed away\nand so\nthe that that notion of fear that the\nnecessity of working it together in a\nnon-conflicting way is very important\nand the second of those things\nare skills skills that\nthat so that you can engineer\nthe increasing the size of the pie and\ndividing it well\nwhat what history has shown is that some\npeople\nare focused in on increasing the size of\nthe pie\nbut not dividing it well and so\nthat's a problem and some people are so\nfocused on dividing it\nthat they don't know how to increase the\nsize of the pie\nat the end of the day you have to raise\nproductivity\nwhatever you get to consume whatever you\nget to eat\nsomebody's got to produce and so\nproductivity\nhas got to be important while there's\nalso a recognition\nthat that has to encompass most people\nso that those most people can be\nproductive and\nand share in that productivity if you\ndon't have that you'll have that out of\nbalance and you'll have a problem\nso those are the two things skills and\nthe need to do it together\nare the two most important that history\ngives us as a god\nyou know where you are every day is not\na new day\nright in other words we're not in a\nposition\nwhere our debts were the same as\nwhen we 30 years ago and we're not in a\nposition that monetary policy could be\nthere and we're not in a position\nnot like at the end of the war where\nwere most people there was a big middle\nclass\nand the differences between them weren't\ngreat you have to recognize those\ndifference\nand be able to skillfully and together\ndeal with those differences\nthat's such great analysis and i'm so\nglad that you\nwent and picked those lessons out from\nhindsight because\ni think there's a beautiful statement by\nmark twain where he said uh\nsimilar to what you're saying and he\nsaid history never repeats itself but it\nalways rhymes\nand and you know we're in that situation\nright now where you're saying it's not\nexactly the same\nbut there are a lot of the same factors\nthat are that are involved\nand by recognizing the differences but\nstill applying the knowledge of the past\nthat we missed out on i think\ni'm really hoping that you're speaking\nto and guiding some of our world leaders\nin that direction\nuh because it's you know i think there's\na lot of people who\nfeel at least from my conversations on\nthe ground at least feel very helpless\nand don't know how they can be a part of\nthat macro change\nand so i am speaking to world\nleaders and i also know how challenging\nit is to be in their position because\nthey also report to a population\nthat could be quite emotional and quite\ndemanding\nand so the idea of doing it rationally\nis is important but that's policy for\nthe whole\nbut individuals need to start with\ntaking care of themselves\nso don't worry if you're not changing\nthe world\nokay and fixing the world but worry\nabout how you're handling that yourself\nright and that means how you how you\nsave your money\nhow you prepare you bet your cook you\nknow your financial cushion\nhow you invest your money um how you\ntreat yourself and that may be your\nmeditation\nor your understanding of such\ntimes these are all things that you\ncould do\nto help you and your family and the\npeople that you care about\nthat's important you may not solve the\nproblems of the world\nbut you can know how to deal with the\nworld well\nyeah that's great advice ray that's\nawesome thank you so much\neveryone who hasn't like ray said you\ncan get the free chapters on linkedin\nuh or if you're like me and love having\nreal books in your house then you can\norder the changing world order for when\nit's out right makes\nray your team makes beautiful books\nprinciples is a beautiful book it\nit feels good it looks great it reads\neven better inside and so\nif anyone does want the physical copy\nyou can pre-order it but\nliz ray said he's being very kind and\ngenerous and you can find the draft\nchapters as the books being written\non linkedin as well to download ray it's\nbeen wonderful speaking to you again and\nyou've been so generous with your time\nand\ni wanted to uh thank you again for your\nbeautiful testimonial
