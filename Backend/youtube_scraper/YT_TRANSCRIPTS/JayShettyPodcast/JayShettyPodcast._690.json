and\nrapidly improve our life\nour communication and our relationships\ngretchen ruben everyone gretchen thank\nyou for doing this\noh i'm so happy to be talking to you i'm\na huge fan of your work and we're\ninterested in so many of the same things\ni'm really looking forward to our\nconversation thank you for having me\ni know i know and i remember when this\nbook came out i was so\nexcited to read it because i'm so\nfascinated\nby personality types tendencies how we\nthink styles and\nand how we're different and the fact\nthat i get to sit here with you today\nand dissect it\nis a real treat and joy for me but i\nwanted to start more on the personal\nside i actually wanted to start off by\nasking you what the last adventure you\nwent on with your two daughters\nuh considering it's been such a uh\ninsular time and obviously restrictive\ntime what's what's something you've done\nwith your daughters recently\noh my goodness well i think our\nadventures have been very home\nhomebound adventures but i decided i\nwanted to learn how to play poker\num i wanted to do something with the\nbeginning middle and an end and so\nwe were like we're gonna learn to play\npoker my husband knew how to play but\nthe three\nmy two daughters and i did not know how\nto play so i rallied them\nand that was kind of that was an\nadventure and i realized like i've been\nmisunderstanding the plots of so many\nmovies and books because\ni had a complete misconception of how\nhow poker worked um\nand so that's been kind of a an\nadventure uh that we did under our own\nroof\noh i love that what a tell me what your\nperception of poker was and how it\ndiffered from reality\nwell i thought it was like a long\ncomplex game where there's a lot of like\nyou know trading cards back and forth my\none of my daughters said\nshe said the thing that i don't like\nabout poker is it doesn't feel like a\ngame it feels like the prelude to a\ndifferent game and i was like\ni don't usually like games i think\nthat's what i like about it it's kind of\num\nit just sort of unrolls and and you deal\nwith what you have and then you move on\num so i thought it was very i think i\nthought it was more like bridge\nwhatever my conception of bridge is i\nalso don't know how to play bridge\num but i i didn't realize like uh\nlike sort of what i it's sort of an\ninstant gratification game\nmore than some some games yeah what's\nthat movie i'm thinking of now that you\nremind me molly's game\noh there's so many poker movies yeah\nyeah\nand everybody gasps when they see a hand\ni'm like i have no idea what that means\nbut now i know so i'm very excited yes\nmy family was very patient with me um\nbecause i was always like\nwait tell me why you what to flush again\nyeah that's awesome i i didn't have the\npatience to learn how to play that\nproperly but for my\nit was my wife's birthday during\nquarantine about a week ago maybe 10\ndays ago\nand we did uh i i organized a minute\nshe's my wife's a vegan recipe developer\nand chef\nand so we did a mini food olympics\noh yeah all these games that were based\non foods\nuh getting foods eating foods playing\nwith food\nand it was it was a lot of fun we did it\ndigitally but it was a lot of fun\nthat's a great idea i love that that's\nso whimsical that's really fun\nyeah it was olympics it was very silly\nyeah it was very silly um\nuh another thing i wanted to ask you is\nabout this uh you know and i love this\nline that you say\nreally it really has stuck me every time\nyou've said it you said that i rather\nfail as a writer than succeed as a\nlawyer\nand and i think that's such a powerful\nmessage and and and that one line\nthere's so much depth to it tell us\nabout\nthat journey of becoming a lawyer\nto then realize that it wasn't your path\nbecause i think a lot of our listeners\nare either at that point on their path\nor getting to that point on their part\nsome of them have already made the\nswitch over and hearing about your\njourney i think will help a lot of\npeople because\nthis isn't what you set out to do in the\nbeginning right well\nyou know i went to law school for the\nsame reason a lot of people go to law\nschool because i was like it's a great\neducation\ni'm good at research and writing it'll\nkeep my options open and i can\nalways change my mind later my father's\na really happy lawyer\nhe didn't put any pressure on me but he\nwas definitely an example of someone who\nloved being a lawyer\nso i went for all the wrong reasons\nwhich i call drift so drift is the\ndecision you make by not deciding or by\ndoing the kind of path of least\nresistance you know you you get married\nbecause your friends are getting married\nyou become a doctor because your parents\nare doctors and you're good at science\nor\nyou take a job because somebody offers\nyou that job so i just kind of drifted\ninto law\nand the fact is i had a great experience\na lot i was editor-in-chief of the law\nreview\nat yale where i was i was a clerk for\nsupreme court\njustice sandra day o'connor um but while\ni was clerking for her\ni got an idea for a book and at the time\ni didn't even know it was a book i just\nwas obsessed with an idea and i was and\nthis happens to me all the time in my\nlife i'll get really interested in\nsomething and do a lot of research and\nwriting\nbut this was um i was just doing so much\nresearch and so much writing and finally\ni thought\nwell this is the way somebody would\nprepare to write a book\nand then i thought well maybe i could\nwrite a book\nabout this and then i got went to the\nbookstore and bought a book that was\ncalled something like how to write and\nsell your non-fiction book proposal and\ni just followed the directions\nbut as you say it was like it felt very\nrisky but i did\nsay to myself i would rather fail as a\nwriter and then succeed as a lawyer\nand i have to give it a shot i have to\nallow myself to either succeed or fail\nbecause if i don't try\ni think i'm going to be haunted by this\num and so i did\ni love that i love how simple it is and\nhow\npractical it is because i know that so\nmany people if you're listening or\nwatching right now that's\noften what it takes like you you get a\nfeeling and then you go and do the\nresearch and then you follow the steps\nand\nof course there's so much more hard work\nand sacrifice and\neverything all that all the other\ningredients that are really important\nbut the methodology is\nis usually uh aligned it's it's very\nsimilar to\nwanting to break into his particular\nindustry or whatever it may be\nthe methodology can be similar but it's\nthe hard work tell us a bit about that\nside\ngretchen around the sort of pain or\nsacrifice or some of the pressure that\nyou felt\nbecause you know you were successful you\nwere doing well for yourself you've\nobviously\nworked and there's so much sunk cost\nbias yes\nof the drift of like you've worked so\nhard to get into this incredible\ninstitution and\nyou get so much respect for it and\npeople think you're great at it and then\nall of a sudden you're starting out with\nlike basically\nzero it's almost like you know starting\nfrom the bottom again\nin an industry which you have no\nreputation in you have you have no\nqualification in\ntell us about what that feels like and\nand what was it that helped you kind of\nbuild your way up from there\nwell you're exactly right like i didn't\nhave a clip i hadn't worked on the\ncollege newspaper or my\nyou know i had not i hadn't published a\nshort story\nwhereas in law i had all these you know\nfeathers in my cap but\num if anything i think you know lawyer\nturned writers on so boring i was like i\neven hated to tell people that i was a\nlawyer because i thought that would make\nthem you know\nrun run screaming for my proposal but\nyou know i had something\nthat at the time i didn't even think\nabout but then looking back and talking\nto other people who are similarly\nsituated i i realized how fortunate i\nwas\nwhich was how the people around me were\nso tolerant of me taking a risk and so\nencouraging\nand i think sometimes the people around\nus out of the deepest\nlove and the desire to protect us they\ndon't want to see us disappointed they\ndon't want to see us fail they don't\nwant to see our feelings get hurt they\ndon't want to see us frustrated\nthey want us to be safe but there is no\npath of safety i mean if anything if the\nlast 10 years have shown us anything\n15 years you know there is no safe\nprofession\num and i was really lucky because\nmy parents were like great you want to\nstart all over from scratch\nafter having just completed this long\nthing which by the way we paid for\nfine great excellent go for it my\nhusband was also switching from a lot of\nright\nfrom law to finance and so he was also\ngoing through a big switch so\nwe were doing that together i remember\nthere was a day when\ni had decided that i was going to like\ntry to get an agent and he was going to\ntry to get a job in finance\nand we had moved to new york city and\nthe note\ncame from the new york bar association\nit was time for us to pay our bar fees\nand\nthese are not inconsequential fees like\nyou have to pay a lot to remember the\nbar\nand i said to my husband are we gonna\npay our bar fees\nand he said are you kidding no way and i\nwas like okay we are doing this we are\ncommitted now now now i find out you can\nalways get readmitted to the door if you\njust like do a few things but at the\ntime it felt like this massive step\nso i was very fortunate that the people\naround me were really encouraging and my\nfather said something\nto me that others i repeated it because\nit was so meaningful to me\nand people have said oh that sounds\ndiscouraging but actually it was very\nencouraging\nso i said to my father okay i have this\nidea for a book i'm going to write it\nand he said\nwell look darling you might not hit it\nout of the park the first time but\nyou'll get there\nand people said but that that's telling\nhim he didn't think you could succeed\ni was like no it was him telling me if\nyou don't fail the first time that\ndoesn't mean you're a failure\nyou don't have to succeed right away in\norder for this to have been the right\ndecision\nand that was very comforting to me\nbecause i was like this could take time\nyou know and here my father's reminding\nme sometimes things take time but that\ndoesn't mean that they're the wrong\nthing to do\nyeah it's it's incredible isn't it\nyou've just kind of hit a\nhit a point for me while i'm listening\nto you that\nit's it's amazing how how what how old\nwere you when you became a qualified\nlawyer like 25 is it\nis it like uh when i took the bar i was\nprobably like 26 27.\nright okay so you took the bar at 26 27\nand if you think about it you've been in\neducation or in the educational system\nsince like three or four years old yeah\nwhich means to become\na lawyer and which is an incredible\nprofession\nit took 23 to 24 years\nand and i think we almost forget that\nthat it took x amount so i\ni went to uh cash business school where\ni studied management science with a\nfocus on behavior science\nand i graduated at 21 22 i was\nthe oldest in my year and it's like\npeople forget that that means i've spent\n18 years to get this qualification which\nmeans\ngetting to something i didn't want took\n18\nto 24 years but it's funny that we\nexpect all of a sudden that when we do\nsomething we're passionate about\nthat it has to happen on the first time\nand and we forget\nthat we spent 18 to 24 years\ntrying to get good at something we\ndidn't even love\nyet we expect ourselves to be perfect at\nsomething\nthe day we try it and not realizing that\nit may take sometimes another 10\n20 even 30 years in some cases yeah and\ni think sometimes that's the way that\npeople deal with the fear of it\nuh is by saying well if i if it's not an\nimmediate success\nthen i know that i should give up\nbecause\num uh to\nstruggle to flail around to make\nmistakes to learn things the hard way\num is tough and it's\nit can be no fun and so sometimes it\nfeels good to be like well i tried it\nand so now i you know i learned my\nlesson instead of sort of staying\nin it and kind of allowing yourself to\nto feel that frustration\num you know it's funny because sometimes\nwhen people talk about a happy life they\ntalk about\nthey talk about it as if a happy life\nwould be a life when you feel\n10 on the 1 to 10 scale 24 7. and that's\nnot realistic and it's not even a good\nlife\num there's many reasons why we feel sad\nor we feel angry or we feel resentful or\nwe feel\noutraged or we feel you know insecure we\nfeel scared\nand these are all really important\nemotions we can learn a lot from them\nand they can direct our behavior\nin really really positive ways but it's\nnot always so fun\nto feel those emotions you know envy is\na really powerful helpful emotion but it\nis no fun to feel it\num but we can learn a lot from these\nnegative emotions\nyeah it's funny how we've created a\nviewpoint in our minds that we're almost\nbroken if we have those emotions yeah no\nand they're and they're\nextraordinarily important and useful\nyeah and we feel like we have to fix\nourselves\ninstead of feel that emotion and and\nfixing can kind of lead to so much more\npain because every time we fix something\nthere's another thing and then there's\nanother thing and\nit can be a never-ending cycle tell us\nabout how you discovered\nthe four tendencies first was where you\nwere like\noh this is you know this is a really big\nidea that's going to help people\nwell i was sitting right where i'm\nsitting right now i remember it i mean\nit hit me\nlike a lightning bolt because it was\nsomething i had been struggling about\nwith for months months and months maybe\nyears um\nand uh and there were all these pat i\nhad been writing a book called better\nthan before that was all about habit\nchange how we make or break our habits\nand i've been noticing\npatterns in what people said and how\nthey behaved and certain challenges that\nthey faced\nthat i couldn't make sense of but\nsomehow i intuited that they were\nsomehow connected but i couldn't\nunderstand the pattern it was just my my\nbrain was melting trying to figure this\nout\nand one of the most significant examples\nwas when a friend said to me\nyou know i would be happy i know i would\nbe happier if i exercised\nand when i was in high school i was on\nthe track team and i never missed track\npractice so why can't i go running on my\nown now\nand i thought i've heard so many people\nsay something like that what's going on\nand you can think of a hundred different\nreasons maybe that could explain that\nbut what's really going on and then\nthere were certain i would always say to\npeople how do you feel about new year's\nresolutions because that's sort of a\ngood habits related question to get\npeople talking\nand certain people would give me exactly\nthe same answer they say\ni would keep a habit or start a\nresolution whenever it made sense to me\ni would not wait for january 1st because\njanuary 1st is an arbitrary date and\nthey always said\narbitrary i was like that's interesting\nbecause the arbitrariness\nnever really bothered me then i was at a\nparty and i was talking to a woman\nand who i now know what tendency she is\nbut i was telling her i was writing a\nbook about habits\nshe literally took a step back from me\nbecause she was so repelled by the idea\nof writing about she was like\nwhy would you write about such a\nterrible subject i was like i love the\nidea of habits to me they're energizing\nand freeing i love the subject of having\nit\nand so one day i was sitting there and i\nwas just thinking these were just\nrunning through my mind and i was trying\nto understand how were they connected\nand i realized that the idea was\nexpectations how do people respond to\nexpectations and when i got to the word\nexpectations i quickly realized that\nthere are two kinds of expectations\nouter expectations like uh\nmeeting a deadline or meeting a request\nfrom a friend and then there are inner\nexpectations like my own desire to\nbecome a writer and write a book\nproposal my own desire to keep a new\nyear's resolution\nand i realized that when i looked at how\npeople responded to outer and inner\nexpectations\nthat's what made someone an upholder a\nquestioner an obliger or a rebel now of\ncourse i didn't have those\nthose terms right away it took me a long\ntime to figure out the terms but i saw\nthe pattern you know and it was like\na pattern of nature where everything fit\nand every example i could think of\nfit in some way so it felt like you know\nthe periodic table of the elements where\nyou're like this just works like it's\ngot that solidity that you get in nature\nand i was like\nand it was just the most exciting moment\nof my intellectual life i have to say\ni i love it i i really enjoy\nthat same feeling of how psychology\nhelps us\ngroup and understand yes understand\nourselves i think there's such a need\nfor it\nand as much as we understand that\neveryone is genuinely very unique and\ndiverse and different there are these\nkind of\nfoundational principles and aspects that\nkind of keep us in certain\ngroups with others tell us a bit about\nwhere did these tendencies come from\nlike are they manufactured through\nschool and family or are they things\nthat we develop where does it where do\nthey actually come from\nwell i really do believe the four\ntendencies are hardwired like i'm a big\nbeliever in the genetic roots of\npersonality generally and i think that\nyou're in a polder questioner blighted\nrebel you bring that into the world with\nyou now obviously your culture is going\nto affect it like if you're a questioner\nwho's always questioning\nand you're in north korea you maybe\nlearn to keep your mouth shut but if\nyou're in silicon valley that might be\none of your greatest assets greatest\nstrengths\num and i think you know with time and\nexperience we all learn how to manage\nour tendency so that we\nat least we would hope that we would be\nable to gain from the strength of it and\noffset the weakness and the limitations\nof it because we sort of learn\nabout ourselves and how to manage\nourselves but i do think it's\nit is something that you're born with\nyou're not one at 20 and one at 48\nyou're not one at work and one at home\nthese are consistent aspects of your of\nyour nature\nyeah absolutely and and do you find that\nsometimes that\ni i agree with you too so i believe\npersonality types are hardwired too and\nand the way we behave do you find though\nthat sometimes\nalmost that because one type of\npersonality is demanding to us from work\nthat often you find people jostling\nbetween\ntwo in terms of pretending and acting as\nopposed to being\nyou know i think actually it's really\nhard to\nbe inconsistent with your tendency that\nit's pretty it's in it and that um\nthat will either either you'll steer\nyourself to a place\nwhere your tendency works for you or\nit's going to be a major source of\nconflict\num and so maybe i should go through the\ntendencies yeah\nso there's there's a quiz that people\nwant to take a quiz that like gives you\nan answer and spits out a report because\nsome people get a kick into that if you\njust go to quiz.gretchenreuben.com it's\nlike\n11 questions quiz.gretchenrubin.com\ngo there now i love quizzes and i love\nyeah yes uh like 2.8 million people have\ntaken this quiz\nand um it's free so you can get your\nlittle report but the fact is\nmost people know what they are just from\nthe brief description that i'll give\nright now\nit's pretty these are very blatant these\nare not subtle tendencies\nyou'll know what you are you'll know the\npeople at your workplace people in your\nfamily game of thrones characters people\nand you know parks and recreation you\nknow tv shows\nmovies they're all around us anyway so\nit looks at what\nuh how you respond to outer and inner\nexpectations so again outer is like a\nwork deadline inner is like a new year's\nresolution\nso upholders readily need outer and\ninner expectations they\nthey want to do what others expect from\nthem but their expectations for\nthemselves are just as important\num and so their motto is discipline is\nmy freedom\nthey want to execute and follow through\nthen there are questioners\nquestioner's question all expectations\nthey'll do something if they think it\nmakes sense so they want\njustification research rationale\nreasons they resist anything arbitrary\ninefficient unjustified\nso if something meets their own inner\nstandard they will do it no problem\nif it fails their inner standard they\nwill push back so their motto\nis i will comply if you convince me why\nthen there are obligers obligers readily\nmeet outer expectations but they\nstruggled to meet inner expectations and\nso this is my friend on the track team\nwhen she had a team and a coach\nexpecting her to show up she had no\ntrouble showing up but when she was just\ntrying to go on her own when it was her\ninner expectation\nshe struggled and so the key thing for\nobligers to realize is if they want to\nmeet an inner expectation\nthey have to create a system of outer\nexpectation if you want to read more\njoin a book group if you want to\nexercise more take a class\nexercise with a friend who's going to be\nannoyed if you don't show up you know\nthink of your duty to be a role model to\nsomebody else there's a million ways to\ncreate accountability once you realize\nthat's what you need\nso their motto is you can count on me\nand i'm counting on you to count on me\nand then finally rebels rebels resist\nall expectations outer and inner alike\nthey want to do what they want to do\nin their own way in their own time they\ncan do\nanything they want to do anything they\nchoose to do\nbut if you ask or tell them to do\nsomething they are very likely to resist\nand typically they don't tell themselves\nwhat to do like they won't sign up for a\n10 am spin class on saturday\nbecause they think i don't know what i\nwant to do on saturday and just the idea\nthat it's on my calendar is going to\nannoy me\num so their motto is you can't make me\nand neither can i and obliger is the\nbiggest tendency for both men and women\nyou either are an obliger you have many\nof lighters in your life and rebel\nis the smallest tendency it's\nconspicuous but it's a small tendency\nokay good to know great great foundation\nsetting for all of those areas everyone\nupholders\nquestioners obliges or rebels and\ngretchen told you the quiz as well\nquiz.gretchenrubin.com\nuh is where you can take that quiz uh so\nlet's let's dive into all of them a bit\nmore because i want people to understand\nhow they connect one of one of the big\nones for me is what i\nfind is how\nwe we think everyone we we have two kind\nof we have the mirror belief where we\nthink everyone thinks like us\nokay right yeah and then and then\nsometimes we run into the other extreme\nwhere it's like well no one thinks like\nme and i think differently\n100 i completely agree with you you're\neither in one or the other\neither everyone is like me or no one is\nlike me\nyes which whereas with this framework we\nstart to understand that there are some\npeople that think like me and there are\nsome people that don't\ntell us about how to communicate with\neach type in a way so that they\nunderstand because i feel like\nthat's where we really see this come\nalive i know in my life\nwhere i've seen these tools become the\nmost applicable\nis when i change the language and the\nway i speak to certain people\nbecause that's the language that they\nunderstand and resonate with can you\ntell us a bit about those\nyes and i'll tell you where you can see\nthis play out not now because of the\npandemic but in general if you go to the\noffice kitchen and you look at the\nsignage\nyou will see all the tendencies like in\nfull blossom because everybody is coming\nto it\nfrom their own perspective and they\ndon't understand why people disagree and\nyou're exactly right\nyou can use the tendencies to really\nminimize conflict\nuh and procrastination and also just to\nshow more compassion to yourself and\nmore compassion to other people\nso i'll start with obliger because\nthat's the biggest tendency so blighters\nneed accountability and a lot of times\nother tendencies like i'm in a polder\nit's my tendency\nwe'll say things like well i don't want\nto be your babysitter do it whenever\nit's right for you\nlike i don't want to have to check on\nyou but but but\nobligers do much better work when they\ndo have accountability and when they do\nhave deadlines and deliverables and\ncheck-ins\non the other hand rebels don't like that\nthey don't like somebody looking over\ntheir shoulder they don't like somebody\nchecking in they want to do what they\nwant to do in their own way and if they\nfeel like you're telling them what to do\neven if you're praising them for what\nyou're doing\nthey may start to resist and so the kind\nof behavior that might be very effective\nand even necessary with an obliger could\nbe counterproductive\nwith a rebel like i i know a rebel who\nwas working uh\nas a as a consultant he had a boss who\nsaid this is a really hard problem\ni don't know what to do you've got the\nchops to deal with this\ngo away figure it out in a month if you\nrun into roadblocks let me know\notherwise come back to me with a\nsolution and he's like that's how i do\nmy best work\nbut to an obliger they'd be like what is\nhappening like\ni have no like like i need a little more\nstructure so bliger said to me when i\nwhen i try to apply for a new job i say\ni work best with a tough boss\nare you a tough demanding boss because\nthat's how i give my best work\nquestioners need reasons when i talk to\nhealth care professionals they know they\nknow this kind of person very well but\nthey're like\nyou're telling me to walk a mile before\nbreakfast every day\nwhy am i why do you for breakfast why am\ni walking not running what if i take a\nbike what if it's in the evening i don't\nunderstand\nand it's like they will get on board but\nthey have to have their questions\nanswered and if you say\nbecause we've always done it this way or\nbecause i'm the doctor and i say so or\nbecause you said you would or that's the\nlaw\nthey're like i don't understand like\nthis doesn't make any sense and\ntherefore\nit's illegitimate so for the with\nquestioners you have to take the time\nto take them through and so let's say\nyou're in a work situation\nyou want to think about well how can i\nhow can i give\neverybody what they need but not burden\neverybody with what they need so like\nlet's say you were going to implement a\nnew software program\nyou might say to a group oh you know\nwe're switching to a different software\nprogram\ni'm going to give you a 20 minute\npresentation about why we're doing this\nand then if you feel like you've heard\nenough please feel free to return to\nyour desk\nif you would like to stay here and ask\nme further questions about why we feel\nlike this is the right decision\ni'm happy to stay here until you really\nunderstand why we think this is the\nright course for our company\nthe questioners get their questions\nanswered because by the way they often\nwill just silently not go along with\nwhat people tell them to do and that can\ncause a lot of conflict and a lot of\nlike you know uh inefficiency\nthey need to have their questions\nanswered but you know maybe the\nmaybe the obliger's like whatever that's\nnot my problem like just tell me what\nyou want me to do and i i got other\nstuff on my to-do list\num so when you know the tendencies you\ncan you can think cleverly\nabout how to give people what they need\nand not burden them with a lot of stuff\nthey don't need\nyeah those are those are such great\ninsights whether it's workplace whether\nit's family\nyou know it's just we often wonder why\npeople aren't\nyou know motivated yes where we are yes\nhow do you not get this like yes yeah\nand no that's exactly what happens with\nthe tendencies everybody does what would\nwork with their tendency\nso questioners deluge people with with\nresearch and articles and\nand and data and i get very tired some\npeople are like\ntoo many too many questions too much\ninformation\nobligers see everybody's like you keep\nsaying this is important to you i don't\nunderstand why you're not doing it like\nyou keep saying you want to exercise\nwhy can't you why can't you keep your\npromise to yourself rebels people are\nlike why don't you ever do what i want\nyou to do\nuh and then upholders well they get\nrigid they're like oh i'm sorry i have\nto go to bed at 10 pm every night i\ndon't care if it's your anniversary\nparty i got to go home because i'm going\nrunning at 8 00 am you know\nso when you understand that other people\nhave a different perspective a lot of\ntimes it makes you you might\nthink well it's kind of annoying the way\nyou are but i'm not going to take it\npersonally\nand i'm not going to feel like you're a\njerk i just\nunderstand how you're bringing a\ndifferent perspective to it yeah for\nsure\nare there any then in your perspective\nwhat are the\nrecommended occupations behind certain\nbecause i feel like\nuh often people may reflect and be like\noh wait a minute i don't get to be this\nin my\njob or role or i'm not really playing\nthis role tell us a bit about yeah what\nare the right are there recommended jobs\ndoes it mean you can't be a job how do\nyou how do you\nalmost create a pathway to success\nknowing your tendency\nwell you know there's so many qualities\nthat make somebody good at a particular\nprofession i think that\njust about any tendency could do just\nabout any profession well like i could\nimagine being a lawyer as an upholder as\na questioner as an obliged rebel i think\nthey would all do that really well\nbut i also think that you're right that\ncertain professions tend to value\ncertain uh aspects of nature more highly\nand so\npeople tend to do well like i would say\nthat question asking professions maybe\nscientist journalists\nmight be particularly appealing to\nquestioners because it just scratches\nthat\nitch that they have it kind of gives\nthem permission um rebels interestingly\noften are entrepreneurs because they\nwant to do things their own way they\ndon't want to take advice for\nor direction from anybody else um they\nalso often thrive in sales because with\nsales a lot of times it's like listen\nwhatever you gotta do to make that sale\nlike okay fine you know and so they have\nthat freedom\nthey often do better in prison in\npositions where\nevery day is different like i talked to\nsomebody who was a restaurant manager so\nthat he was like i'm on the road all the\ntime every day is different i'm always\nwith different people nobody really\nknows where i am they're not taking\nkeeping track of me there was a lot of\nfreedom and choice and that's really\nimportant to a rebel\nhowever some rebels are very uh\nattracted to areas of high like\nregulation like the clergy the military\nthe police\nbecause they like to have something to\nresist they need the energy of kind of\npushing back\num upholders tend to thrive in places\nwhere it's pretty clear\nwhat does success look like what are the\nrules they tend not to\nlike things where there's a lot of\nemphasis on flexibility and like sudden\nshifts like i'm working for a visionary\nleader who every day has a different\nplan it's like as an upholder i don't\nlike working that way\num or where it's ambiguous uh what the\nrules are\nor what success looks like they tend to\nmake want to make a plan and execute it\nand questioners do not like to be in a\nplace um where things are not justified\nagain like a visionary leader where\nyou're supposed to just like\ndo what that person wants without\njustification can be very annoying\nand obligers really need that outer\naccountability now what's good is that\nusually the workplace is kind of an easy\nplace to get accountability because you\nautomatically have deadlines and\ndeliverables and a boss and a team and\nclients and students and all that\nso often obligers will do very well at\nwork and then they don't understand why\nthey can't\ndo equally well at home they don't\nunderstand well at work i have all this\naccountability\nthis architecture that's keeping me and\nyou know going\ni if i would create the same\narchitecture for myself in my private\nlife\ni would also succeed with my private\naims but i don't understand that i need\nto\nfigure out how to create that kind of\naccountability\num at home as well as in the office and\nso for many of lighters that's like a\nhuge light bulb to understand\nwhy can i keep my promises to other\npeople but i can't keep my promises to\nmyself\nit's like that's just a thing that\nobliges experience like there's no shame\nin that there's no weakness in that you\njust fix it and then you're done\nit's very simple it's not it's not easy\nbut it's straightforward\nright yeah let's talk about that\nactually how do you improve the\nnatural weaknesses that come up in each\nuh and and which weaknesses do you focus\non because\noften yeah let's start there and then\ni'll follow up i don't want to get asked\nlike three questions in one let's start\nno i know and i think you're exactly\nright this is the question because this\nis where we have the opportunity to to\ngrow it's like to see the weakness\nso like my my tendency is upholder and\nso i would say the weaknesses that you\noften see with the polars is rigidity\nlike we get it in our mind that\nsomething's supposed to happen a certain\nway and it's very hard to get off of\nthat you know it's like\ni remember i got invited to a wedding\nand they're like the bus is leaving for\nthe church at five and then the bride's\nmother was like nowhere it's actually\nleaving at 4 30. and i was like\nwell see that's not possible because i\nhave a card and you know it's like\nwhat you know that kind of rigidity um\nand upholders can be kind of judgmental\nand cold because they're i'm like\nhey jay we both have our reports due on\nfriday and you want me to proofread your\nreport but like\ni got to proofread my own report i don't\nhave time to help you tune a bl to a\ndepolar that seems right because i'm\nmeeting my inner expectation\nbut to other people it can seem cold\nlike you need to like make an effort to\nextend yourself and\nand upholders can be judgmental because\nthings tend to come certain things come\nmore easily to them than they do to\nother people\nquestioners need to learn how to ask\nquestions in a constructive way\nthey can seem disrespectful uh or like\nnot team players if i'm a thin-skinned\nboss and you're asking me question after\nquestion i start to think\nyou don't trust my judgment you're\nquestioning my authority you're not a\nteam player i don't want to work for you\nso questioners need to learn how to ask\nquestions in a way that don't make other\npeople feel like they're on the stand\nyou know or that they're being grilled\num or that there's cheekiness you know a\nlot of times questioner children get in\ntrouble because they're like well why\nshould i do this dumb book report it's\nlike\nthey really are saying why should i do a\ndumb book report um\nso they need to do that and also\nquestioners can sometimes have analysis\nparalysis this is when their desire for\nperfect information makes it hard to\nmove forward or to make a decision\nbecause sometimes in this world we have\nto\nwe can't wait for perfect information\nright you can\nwhat kind of email platform should i use\ni can research that for the next year\nyou know at a certain point they have to\nsay it's more efficient to decide and\nlearn\nand experiment than to keep them to keep\nresearching for obligers\ntheir weakness is this it's not even a\nweakness it's just a fact they need\nouter accountability\nand they have to get that out of\naccountability and so\nwhether that's taking a class or\nteaching a class or thinking of your\nyour duty to your future self or your\nduty to be a role model or\nuh hiring a coach you know joining aaa\nor weight watchers all these things are\nways to create utter accountability\nnow obligers have an interesting\nphenomenon where they can fall into\nobliger rebellion\nyes i'm going to ask you about them so\nthey they meet\nme and expectations and then suddenly\nthey snap and they say this i will not\ndo\nit happens when they feel like exploited\nor taken advantage of or unheard\nand sometimes it's small like i'm not\ngoing to answer your emails for two\nweeks and sometimes it's huge like i'm\ngoing to quit this job and walk out\ntoday\num and it's done to kind of blow up a\nsituation that's become\njust kind of uh untenable for the\nobliger but it can have very serious\nreputational consequences because to the\nother tendencies\nit doesn't make sense i'm like jay i\nasked you if you wanted to be on this\ncommittee\nand you said okay so i don't understand\nwhy you're so mad\ni don't understand that uh what you're\nalready on seven committees and nobody\nelse in this company that's on more than\ntwo and that's not fair and so now\nyou're rebelling\nbecause that's that's how a bloody\nrebellion gets started\nand then so for rebels\nthey can do whatever they want to do and\nso with the rebel you just can't tell\nthem what to do\nuh and that is hard um it can be\nfrustrating to live or work with\nsomebody who\nisn't going to do what you tell them to\ndo so if you're dealing with a rebel you\neither want to remind them of how it\nfits into their identity\nyou're doing this because you're an\nathlete you're an animal lover you're a\nmusician you're a poet you're a writer\nthis is who you are or you give them\ninformation consequences choice\nlook if you do your physical therapy\nthis happens if you don't do your\nphysical therapy that happens\nup to you um that's what tends to work\nbest with rebels because they want it\nand then sometimes\nalso they will work with a challenge\nlike i know a guy who quit smoking\nbecause his 18 year old son\nno guy like you could never quit smoking\nhe's like watch me okay\nthat's great i love that one that's\nawesome i think when\nwhen i'm when i'm listening to all the\ndescriptions\nuh i definitely feel myself to be in the\nrebel category\ninteresting yeah i definitely find\nmyself and it's interesting that you\nbrought out the both\nexamples of the rebel category of the\nyou you spoke about the army and the\nclergy\nbut then you also talk about\nentrepreneur and it's interesting that\nobviously\nmy life previously is living as a monk\nand now\ndoing what i do today it's it's i like\nhow you're able to\ni think we look at tendencies as so\nsingular\nlike when you hear the word rebel you\nwouldn't necessarily think of monk but i\noften talk about how\nmonk life was like the ultimate\nrebellion yes\nbecause it was literally saying well\nthis version of the world doesn't work\nlike this this path doesn't work i'm\ngoing to go find it completely extreme\nand different\nyes uh a path well and i'll tell you if\nyou want to do some rebel monk reading\nthomas burton who is a very famous uh\ncarthusian monk\nwho lived several decades ago you read\nhis journals because it is like\ndiary of a rebel as a monk and it is\nreally\nfascinating exactly that thing like i'm\ngonna do the extreme unexpected thing\nthe thing people\nthink i can't do uh i'm kind of going\nall the way and it's very fascinating\nhow those how those another thing and\nmaybe this will resonate with other\nparts of your career\num i was talking to a guy who's a rebel\nwho worked for i won't say the name of\nthe company but let's just say it's like\na very big\nfamous uh tech company that's well known\nfor being very controlling\nand i said how does a rebel like you\nwork for a place like this he's like ah\nthey're working for me i'm gonna start\nmy own company they're training me i'm\ngetting paid to learn how to do all this\nstuff and then i'm gonna go off and i'm\ngonna start my own company\nso to him they were all working for him\nthis is what he wanted and i was like\nright he's doing it in a rebel way but\nit's allowing him to get\nwonderful experience at a really really\nbig prestigious company\nand but he did it in a real way he found\nthe rebel mindset that allowed him to do\nit\nthat's what i love about what you're\nsaying it's it's all about the mindset\nit's not what you're externally\ndoing yes and and that the beauty of\nthat is is that no matter where you\nare if you go\nall in on the mindset that you naturally\nare the tendency that you actually\nare then you're guaranteed to find in\nthat space where you want and so\nwhat you just said to me resonates so\nstrongly with me\nbecause i after living as a monk\nobviously worked at accenture for a\ncouple years\nright big corporate that's what made me\nthink of it 1000 people\nand the most amazing thing is that it\nwas completely a revel inside the\ncompany and so\nit was that the mindset that you had i i\nnever i don't think i have the\ni don't think i had the element of\nthinking people work for me but i\ndefinitely had that complete\nunderstanding of i'm here to learn yes\ngrowing up i'm actually carving out a\ncareer path\nin the company that is so rare and\nunique yeah that hasn't existed for\n90 of people inside the company before\nand i'm gonna go all in on that i don't\nbelieve i have to\nbecome the generalist i don't believe i\nhave to become what they want me to\novercome i believe i can\ncreate my own part but see and your\nexample is perfect for why we need\nall of the tendencies in a workplace\nbecause it's very when you're hiring\nof course you you gravitate to people of\nyour tendency because they think the way\nyou think they have their same responses\nthat you have\neverything seems very sensible but think\nof how your company would have lost out\nif they hadn't had your\nrebel entrepreneurial spirit and the way\nthat you were able to see\nand be attracted to an opportunity that\nnobody else saw or wanted to pursue\nright maybe for whatever reason they're\nlike oh why would i take that risk why\nwould i do that\nnobody's done that before whereas for\nyou that's like catnip\nfor other people that maybe was a turn\noff but they needed you there because\nthey needed what you could bring and so\ni think when you're hiring or you're\nputting together a team\nyou need to be very careful like i've\nhad people say to me i only want to hire\nobligers\nteach me how to screen for obliger and\ni'm like obligers are wonderful they're\nthe rock of the world but you don't want\nonly obligers because you need the\nquestioners to be like why the heck are\nwe doing this\nyou need the rebels to be like let's do\nsomething completely out of the box you\nneed the upholders who are like\nthese we're gonna we're gonna execute we\nare gonna surpass\nand we have our eye on that excellence\nthey all bring so much to it\num and i think that your your your\nhistory is a perfect example\nof why even somebody who's like i don't\nlike working with a rebel it's like well\nsuck it up because you need that\nyeah no that's that's it it's because\nall these examples you're giving me are\nmaking it more and more clear to me\nwhy i'm definitely a rebel and it and it\nmakes so much sense and it and it\ncompletely you know it's it's it's\nalmost like there's there's a beautiful\nverse that i quote in in my book think\nlike a monk but it comes from the\nmanu smithy and it says that when you\npre\nwhen you protect your purpose your\npurpose protects you\nand and it's almost like and when when\nwe're using the word dharma or purpose\nin the hmong context it very much\napplies to a tendency\nor a personality type uh and and what i\nmean by that is\nit's almost like i feel like the working\nworld is constantly trying to get\nor at least maybe this is just a rebel\nexperience so you can tell me if it's\njust a revolution\ni feel like i've i've always felt like\neveryone is always trying to get me to\nnot\nbe a rebel like i feel like i'm always\nbeing trying to be pulled and that maybe\nevery personality attack feels that so\ni'm not saying it's just me\nbut i've always felt that and and i've\nhad people openly told me that i had one\nexecutive\nwho said to me jay you know when you\nwere at accenture and you were dabbling\nin like social media and meditation and\nall that kind of stuff\nyou're just like i was like who's this\nkid he doesn't know what he's doing like\nhe's going to ruin his career\nand and you know he came up to me\nafterwards uh probably earlier on in my\nmedia career it was just like jay this\nis how i felt about you when i first saw\nyou but\nit's really amazing that you proved me\nwrong and you found your own path and i\nwas just thinking that\ni've always come across that resistance\nwhere it's always been like really do\nyou really want to do that like\nis that something that all uh tendencies\nexperience or is that something\nspecifically a roblox\nyou know i think that everybody feels\nthat in their own way\num and it's so i think questioners are\nlike\nwho are these lemmings everybody is just\ngoing along\nwithout asking why like who are you\npeople like this\nmakes no sense and the obligers are like\nwhy is everybody telling me what to do\nwhy are they why am i always the one\nsaying yes why is ever you know why am i\nthe one\nstruggling with boundaries why why can't\nother people just act like civilized\npeople and do their part and i'm always\nthe one picking up the slack\nand then the rebels are like why is\neverybody trying to tell me what to do\njust get\nout of my way and stop talking to me and\ni will do it\num and so i think that uh and then\nupholders of course when you get up\nholders together we're just like why\ncan't anybody else get their stuff done\nlike we just are all you know and so um\ni do\nfeel like there is that aspect to it\nwhere you sort of feel like everybody's\nexperiencing it but people are\nexperiencing kind of slightly different\nversions of it\num now you're a rebel but it's\ninteresting because all the tendencies\nkind of tip in one direction or another\nbecause all the tendencies overlap so\nthere's rebels who tip to obliger\nand there's rebels who tip to questioner\nso rebels who tip to obliger tend to\nhave more of a spirit of resistance\nthey're like\nyou can't tell me what to do and even if\nit's something i want to do if you tell\nme to do it now i won't do it because\ni'm not going to let you think\nthat you're telling what to do then\nthere are a relationship to question and\nthey're more like i'm marching to the\nbeat of my own drummer\ni don't care what you want me to do i'm\ngoing to do what i want you want to do\nwhether you want me to do it or not i\ndon't care i think you're a question\na rebel who tips to question her which\nby the way is what steve jobs was\num which is like i have my own path\ndoesn't really like you know what i i've\ngot to do things my own way\nbut if you weigh in it's not going to\nignite the spirit of resistance to me\none way or another\nwhereas rebels who tip to obliger really\nfeel\nlike if somebody tells them what to do\nit's like they just\nhave to resist and in a way that they\nbecome controlled in the negative\num so then they have to manage that i\nthink a little bit\ni think you're i think you're a rebel he\ntips the question it's even more crazy\nbecause\nunless unless you really and i didn't i\ndon't know if you do know this\nso i am like a huge steve jobs fan oh\nwell there you go\nprobably because you're like everything\nhe says makes so much sense\nnow literally when you said that i was\njust like that's so funny because no one\never understands how i can be a steve\njobs fan and\ni'm fascinated by so much about him as a\nhuman uh\nincluding his spiritual quest too he he\nspent a lot of time with monks and uh\nspiritual traditions and\nuh and and at the same time had so many\nother\ncomplexities in his life of course like\nwe all do but but yeah i would agree\nwith you on that definition i\ni've never felt the resistance i i was\nbringing up the resistance because i\nthink\nit's such a important thing to protect\nyour tendency\nin the sense of i feel like there's such\na need for you\nto know truly what your tendency is so\nthat you can go\nall in on that tendency with confidence\nbecause i think sometimes we\nwe doubt our tendencies yeah we we doubt\nlike whether it's the right thing\nor we doubt whether it's a good thing uh\ntell us about that that and like looking\nat it from a good or bad thing sometimes\nwe've been trained to believe that\ncertain qualities we\nwe actually have as a tendency are\nactually negative in the world but\nactually\nfor us well i think you're exactly right\nand it's it really saddens me when\npeople say well i don't like my tendency\ni want to be this tendency how do i\nchange\nyeah and the thing is it's like they're\nall have strengths they all have\nweaknesses they all include people who\nare wildly successful and also people\nwho are big losers\nand really when you look at the people\nwho are the most successful the happiest\nthe healthiest\nthey're really the people who have\nfigured out how to harness the strengths\nof their tendencies the most effectively\nand then also how to offset the\nlimitations or the weaknesses of their\nof their tendencies most effectively\nnow where you see this a lot is with\nobligers because obligers they they say\nwell it's weak\nthat i i i rely on outer accountability\ni don't want to have to do that\nwhy is it weak it's a huge percentage of\npeople need outer accountability\njust put it in there and then you can\nget you can achieve your aim i don't\ni don't think that you need to transcend\nit or transform it it's just embrace\nit and like you say go with it and then\nbecause you're going with the kind of\nthe natural\ncourse of your of your stream you're\ngoing to just your your little boat is\ngoing to float much faster\num and so and that so obligers will\noften say that now sometimes rebels say\nthat because they can really get\nfrustrated with themselves\nif they haven't figured out how to get\nthemselves to do what they want so\nif you're an entrepreneur but you can't\nget yourself to do the drudge work well\nthat's gonna that's gonna slow you down\nor\nmaybe every time you decide that you're\ngonna exercise every day then you\nimmediately\nrefuse to do it um i know somebody was\nlike i decided i was gonna give up\ncarbohydrates and i went out the next\nday and bought in a big loaf of\nsourdough bread because i'm not no one\ntells me what to do including me\nso part of it is figuring out okay well\nhow do i do it and i've heard from so\nmany rebels who are like\neverybody told me that there was\nsomething wrong with me that i wasn't a\nreal grown-up\ni couldn't get things done in the normal\nway and now that i know\nwho i am i can embrace it and take pride\nin it and see the power of it enormously\npowerful tendency\num and i can set things up in a way that\nwill allow me to succeed in my own way\nand here's the thing about rebels it's a\nlot of times people make it worse\ni mean i just if you're the parent of a\nrebel of the spouse of a rebel or the\nboss of a rebel\nyou think oh i'll make a list i'll\ngive helpful i'll make a star chart i'll\ngive helpful hints and\nand reminders no every time you do that\nyou invent the spirit of resistance if\nyou would just shut up\nand stay away then then the rebel would\nbe like oh i do need to apply for a job\nor i do need to make my bed or i do want\nto get an a on the chem\nexam and they will do it but\npeople trying to be helpful um\noften do exactly the wrong thing and\nthen again then that creates the spiral\nof why can't i do the things that others\ntell me to i want to do and maybe that i\nwant to do for myself and yet\nthere's something that keeps tripping me\nup in my own head\nonce you understand the pattern it's\nvery easy to say oh\noh you can't use a to-do list a lot of\nrebels don't like to use to-do list this\nis a very common pattern so what do you\ndo\nhere's these other things that rebels do\nto kind of get to the place that\nother people use a to-do list for or\nobligers it's like people say\ni don't understand it i do really well\non weight watchers and then i say to\nmyself\nwhy would i pay to go i know the whole\nroutine i don't need to do that i don't\nneed the time and the money\nand then i gain all the weight back and\nit's like oh because i need the\naccountability so maybe there's many\nways to create that accountability\nonce i realize that that's the key thing\nfor me uh so now i have a lot more\nfreedom\nto get where i want to go because i\nunderstand what i need and\nthere isn't a magic one-size-fits-all\nsolution um like you say\nwe're all different and we need to take\na different path but we can all achieve\nour aim even if we\ngo different ways there yeah that's a\ngreat answer i\nthis is uh this is revelatory i feel\nlike i'm getting a personal\nfour tendencies master class oh good yes\nlet's see uh and i'm learning so much\nmore about myself and that's how i've\nalways felt that\ni've become more confident about my\ntendency as life has gone on\nmm-hmm i've exercised it and and i feel\nlike often\neven if we are a tendency we may not be\nexercising enough\nconsciously enough where we develop a\nconfidence around\nit um no i think you're exactly right\nand i think\nprobably it's because you figured out\nhow to succeed and so you have faith in\nyourself because you're like you know\ni've i've figured things out in the past\ni'll probably figure this out i know\nwhat's worked for me in the past so i\ncan figure out like how to sort of\nreplicate that\num i think what happens for some people\nis they've tried and\nthey've gotten discouraged um or they\nsee other people around them\nusing a certain method or a certain\nprocess or a certain curriculum\nand having great success and then they\nthink well if my brother-in-law can do\nit\nif my boss can do it what's wrong with\nme\ninstead of saying well that's something\nthat works for my brother-in-law but\nthat doesn't\ni maybe i'll try it it might be useful\nto think about if it worked for him\nmaybe it'll work for me i love a data\npoint of one\nuh but maybe it's not and i think\nknowing your tendency makes you don't\nhave to just throw spaghetti against the\nwall\nyou can sort of be you can be targeted\nand say this sounds like the kind of\nthing that would work for a questioner\nuh because there's a lot of\njustification there's a lot of data here\nthis is really like answering all my\nquestions i feel like i can really get\non board with this program\num like i don't eat carbs i'm like one\nof these really crazy low carb eaters my\nfather's a questioner\nand he did so much research after i told\nhim about it\nand then he went 100 into the low carb\nworld because he's like i'm completely\nconvinced\ni'm on board whereas with me i like read\none book i'm like i'm doing this that's\nall i need i don't\nyeah i just want just one authority gary\ntops that's all you know i read uh why\nwe get fat and i'm like\ni'm changing everything overnight\ni love that yeah and that's also what\nhelps us have more compassion\nfor other people exactly right like i\nthink that that's what's missing in the\nworld right now\nin so many areas where we we kind of\njust don't\nrealize that for some people it's going\nto take a year\nand for some people it's going to take a\nday and for somebody who's going to take\na book and for something it's going to\ntake\nan overseas trip or whatever it is like\nit's just\nit's it helps you build so much\ncompassion because you go oh i get it\nwhy i learn this quickly and you learn\nit slowly and you learn that\ni learned it slowly well i had this\nexact experience with my husband so my\nhusband's a questioner\nand i was filling out some boring form\nthat we had to fill out as a couple and\nthat's why it's nice to be married to\nholder because i'm the one that's just\ngonna go ahead and get it done to get it\noff the list\nand he had changed jobs recently so i\ndidn't know his office address so i\ncalled him and i said hey jamie what's\nyour office address\nand what did he say why do you want to\nknow\nand i would have said years ago before i\ncame up with this i would have been like\nwhy can't you just answer a simple\nquestion why does everything have to be\nlong drawn out i'm the one doing all\nthis work you're just slowing things\ndown are you jerking my chain\nwhy are you so annoying and now i'm like\nhe doesn't do anything unless he\nunderstands why\nthat it's it's like he's like that with\nme he's like that with everybody i i\nmight be annoyed by it but i don't have\nto be hurt by it it's a reflection on\nour relationship\nand i know what should i have said i\nshould have said hey jamie i'm filling\nout that boring bureaucratic form\nwhat's your work address and he would\nhave told me no problem he just needs to\nknow why\nand so again it's like i don't take it\npersonally anymore because i know that's\njust that's just where he's coming from\nand a lot of times i benefit from it\nit's great for me in many ways to\nhave a questionnaire in my life i'll say\nto him i feel like i have to do this do\ni have to do this and he'd be like\nwhy would he do that like you're right\ni'm not going to do that you know it's\nvery freeing for me to consult with them\nyeah i i love what you just said there\nyou you said i'm allowed to be annoyed\nbut\nbut i'm never hurt by it yeah and i\nthink that that's\ntrue that and you know and eventually\nwhat you explained you realize\nyou're like actually i don't even need\nto be annoyed by it it can actually help\nme\nyes i think it's such a refreshing\nperspective because half the things we\nargue about\nwhether it's with our spouses or with\npartners or girlfriends or boyfriends or\npeople in the workplace is usually just\nbecause we're speaking in different\ntendencies\nyeah it's usually not that much deeper\nthan that\nand the problem is that we we take it to\nbe hurt and emotional\nyes connect an emotional distance tell\nme about is there a\nrecommended partner or friendship\ntype like are you meant should you marry\nsomeone or should you\nuh obviously you've taught us how we can\nadapt but is there a recommended friend\ntype or business\nwell here's the most striking pattern if\nthere is a and you can tell me if this\nis true for you\nwhen you have a rebel who's paired up\neither in romance or in a work life like\na founding team\nif one person is a rebel almost always\nthe other person is an obliger\nnow there are exceptions and they\nusually it's funny the exceptions\nthemselves fall into very distinct\ncategories\nbut almost always if there's a rebel\nthey're paired up with an obliger um\nbecause questioners and upholders tend\nnot to work well with rebels but\nobligers do work well with rebels\nand actually obligers are the the kind\nof type o appropriately they are the\nones that team up the most easily with\nall\nother three tendencies um which is good\nthey're the biggest tendency and they\nthey do the best with the other three\num upholders tend to do very well with\nquestioners\num i'm an upholder married to a\nquestioner and that tends to be very\nconsistent\nagain they can work with the bloggers\nthey can work with rebels um but rebels\nand upholders are kind of the two\nopposite they're the most extreme\npersonality types they tend not to work\nwell together because just what they\nvalue is so different so like\nmaybe as a rebel you experience this\nthere's a lot of value on spontaneity\nthere's a lot of value let's let's keep\nthings open let's let things play out\nlet's see how we feel\nas a double as an upholder i put no\nvalue on spontaneity i would have a plan\nfor everything i just like to live that\nway\nwell that's hard for us to work together\nbecause i'm trying to plan out six\nmonths and you're trying to keep\nour days open um or you might like\nhave a vision and be like let's rethink\nthe priorities of this company and i'm\nlike but i've made\nyou know i've have such an extensive\nexecution plan\nit's distressing to me to like throw it\nall away whereas you find that like very\nliberating and freeing and creative\num i find it creative to dig deep and\nexecute over the long term\nso it's not that they can't but it's\noften that they like to work in such\ndifferent ways that they end up\njust um not not enjoying working with\neach other as much\num in a big team you could you could\nhave it but if it's just like\na pair it could be hard yeah that's it\nyeah that's\nthat's a really that's really good to\nknow i think for people because\nyou know obviously me and gretchen are\nnot sitting here saying don't marry\nsomeone who's not right\nno no and there are many many exceptions\nwith someone we're not saying that at\nall\nbut you've got to know what you're\nworking with\nwhether you're dating or already married\nyou've got to know what to adapt to the\ngreat example that you gave virtually\nabout you and your husband having a\nconversation\nyou know it's it's it can be so\nbeneficial actually\nand if we don't just look at that\ndifference as emotional and i think\nsometimes we take it too personally too\nemotionally\nyou don't realize that it's a tendency\nwell like i collaborate with a lot of\nrebels and believe me\nwhenever i write an email it's like if\nthis works for you if this sounds fun\nwhenever it's convenient for you\nsomething that you could do\nif you thought it would help you is this\nbecause i know i don't i want them to be\nlike this sounds fun\nthis works for me this gets me what i\nwant i will do it in my own way\ni don't want to accidentally push their\nbuttons by like could you please do this\nby friday because they're going to be\nlike\nuh yeah i don't want to do it by friday\nbecause like i don't want to get in\ntheir way or my way\nso it's everything is the same i just be\ni just am careful to frame it\nin a way that will be sweet to their\nears it's\nit's totally easy to do once i know\nthat that's the way to communicate more\neffectively and that's through everybody\nin our lives\nhow does it work into the conflict in\nrelationships so\nif there's a conflict in a relationship\ndo\nsome of these tendencies in all the\ntendencies do we tend to\nuh close off or open up is it different\nbut how does it work for the different\ntendencies\nwell one point of conflict that comes up\nsometimes with obligers\nis the other tendencies will say\nwhy do you keep talking about this and\nyou don't follow through and they get\nvery kind of exasperated\nyou keep saying you want to exercise you\nsay you want to switch careers you say\nyou want to write a novel in your free\ntime\ndo it don't do it i don't care but i\ndon't i don't like seeing you just\nkeep talking about it and so they get\nfrustrated and they don't understand now\nsometimes\noften sweethearts don't make good\naccountability partners and it's also\nvery burdensome to be an accountability\npartner that's why many people hire\ncoaches and\nyou know people like they you know you\nhire somebody to do it so they're\ntrained at it and they they're really\ngood at it\num but if you understand that's what's\nnecessary a lot of times again that\nemotion drains out of it and you're like\nwell let's get you what you need instead\nof like why am i\ni'm getting frustrated with you or\nfeeling like you know you're you're\nsomehow like not keeping your promises\nto yourself\num with questioners um the conflict\noften comes from them feeling like\npeople are asking them to do things that\nare arbitrary\nso here's an example like somebody's\nlike if i said to my husband like we\ndon't have a suburban house but like\nsomething a friend wife was just saying\nshe said her husband\nlet's clean out the basement this\nweekend and he's like we never use the\nbasin why would we clean it out\nit's like that just doesn't make any\nsense to him but if she said something a\nlot and then she gets irritated because\nhe'll never do it you know blah blah\nblah blah\nbut if she said oh we're having company\ncome in two weeks and their kids need\nsome place to sleep if we clean out the\nbasement\nthey can have a whole room to themselves\nlet's do it by you know by the time they\ncome it's like\ni see why i'm being asked to do this and\ni see the timeline and this makes sense\nto me\nyou're going to have a lot less conflict\nif you present the reasons\nand then with the rebel again it's like\na lot of times it's because i'm trying\nto tell you what to do\nand i mean i we on the happier podcast\nwe had two people\ncall in with questions like in the same\ntwo weeks where they had sweethearts who\nneeded to look for jobs one guy had been\nlaid off and one guy was moving to a new\ncity to be with his girlfriend\nand these one was a question one was the\nwhite shirt they're like what do i do to\nhelp my boyfriend look for a job\nit's like nothing these guys know they\nneed a job\nlike if you make a list and remind them\nmake a list of phone numbers circle\nthings in the newspaper you're going to\nignite that spirit of resistance let\nthem do it in their own way\nthey got this just be just let them do\nit in their own way\nnow it might not be your way you know\nthis is like when someone decides to\nclean out the basement at two o'clock in\nthe morning because that's what they\nfeel like\ndon't get in their way let them do it\nwhen they want to spontaneity when they\nfeel like it their choice their freedom\num but once you recognize that and what\na high value it is\nyou can let the rebel do it i love that\nthat's amazing i absolutely love that\nyeah no it's i\ni really believe everyone needs to at\nsome point\ndive deep into this uh work in their\nlife you know because\nit's just it can solve so many issues\nin so many areas of our life simply by\ndeeply\nunderstanding people and wanting to\ncommunicate with them\nin a way that actually and that is\ncompassion that is empathy that is\na real connection it's not a technique\nit's not a manipulation strategy it's\nnot a tool it's\nit's not to take advantage of someone\nit's to deeply\nspeak to someone's wiring in their heart\nuh without without making it so\ndifficult to understand someone\nwell and i hear this a lot from doctors\nand nurses physical therapists\noccupational therapists people like that\nwhere they do want to connect with their\npatients they\nthey want so much to be helpful to be of\nservice to help help people get out of\npain and get towards good health\nand they're very frustrated because they\nknow that in many cases they are not\nsuccessfully communicating and reaching\nthose patients and so they're very\nexcited to have a tool where you as you\nsay\nit's not about manipulation it's not\nabout tricking somebody\nit's about speaking in a way that it's\ngoing to strike a chord with them\nin a way that's going to allow their\nactions to follow their thoughts\nyou write about this all the time how do\nwe put our\nour values and ideas into the world\nthat's not always\nas easy as it sounds um and so this is a\nway to kind of\nmake that match up more effective\nthis understanding has made the biggest\nimpact on where i am today and how i\nfeel\nbecause in in the in the hmong teaching\nit's called dharma and the psycho\nnature is called dharma that's that's\nwhat i studied and and when you look at\nthe four tendencies it's so brilliantly\nexplained and i love the detail you go\ninto of\nreally helping someone understand which\none they are so anyone who's listening\nand watching i highly recommend\nuh the four tendencies is a great way of\ngetting some real self-awareness take\nthe quiz\nuh and and really dive into the people\nthat you spend the most time with in\nyour life\nat work at home at least start by\nknowing theirs you don't need to walk\naround with a\nfour tendency radar like gretchen would\nknow anyone she meets in two seconds and\nwill know what they are and\nyou know you may not be at that stage\nand you may not want to but it's really\nimportant that you understand\nyour family and your work environment\nlike if you know those two environments\nand you know their tendencies\nit's gonna make a world of difference uh\ni know that we've been\nusing these tools in our recruitment as\nwell so i use a lot of these tools in\nrecruiting people onto my teams because\ni want to build like gretchen said a\na complete holistic team where we have\ndifferent people\nuh allowing us and i when i'm speaking\nat companies and if we ever use tools\nlike this we're always\nlooking at like you want a company that\nideally has a equal split\nuh rather than be too far off in one or\nanother so gretchen this is amazing i\nwant to ask you your final five\nthese are usually questions that are\nanswered in one word or one sentence\ni'm asking you some really questions i'm\ncurious about so you may go slightly\nover\nthe final five are meant to be concise\nbut i\ngive you permission in advance to not\nhelp that i'm asking someone really\ncurious about\nokay so uh these are all picked up from\nthings you've said\ni love this piece of advice i'm\nintrigued by it you've said it's better\nto have frequent boring mundane\ncommunication\nthan to save it up i\nbefore i understood what you meant by\nthat it took me a while to wrap my head\naround it but i love your explanations\ncan you explain\nwhy when we talk to people often we have\na lot to say and we don't want to talk\nto them very often we're sort of like\ni'm fine how are you i am also fine and\nso\nlike these little mundane details of our\nlives help us stay connected and\nand kind of keep our our relationships\nmore alive\nlove it great answer uh so anyone who's\nwondering whether\nyou should talk to someone regularly or\nnot as regularly regularly will be\nbetter uh\nsecond question i absolutely love the\nsaying that you said the days are long\nbut the years are short uh expand on\nthat for us\ni think of everything that i've ever\nwritten in my whole life like i did a\nlittle video about a story\nuh called the dates along with the ears\nare short and uh it just really\nresonates with people\nyou know sometimes getting from morning\nto night it feels like an eternity but\nthen you're like where did may go where\ndid 2019\ngo um especially i think for the parents\nof young children\nthe days can seem very long but the\nyears seem very short\ni love that yeah it's such a beautiful\nreminder for us as well\nand uh yeah it has so much meaning to it\ni love it okay question number three\nwhat are some of the common small\nchallenges you've heard\nuh people made in their lives that\nsignificantly boosted their overall\nhappiness and i love the one minute rule\nthat you speak about\noh yeah the one minute rule is that\nanything you can do in less than a\nminute you do without delay so if you\ncan hang up a coat or\nput a dish in the dishwasher or file\nsomething you do and that gets rid of\nkind of the scum on the clutter of life\nanother quick uh lift if you need it is\nto jump up and down do jumping jacks\nrun down the stairs jump over a puddle\nit's quick it's lively\nuh it's kind of childlike uh and another\none of the\neasiest quickest ways to intervene in\nyour mood is to listen to one of your\nfavorite upbeat songs\num it's just it's one of the quickest\nways to give yourself a boost\ni love it okay awesome question number\nfour i know you love children's books\nyes i've heard that reading them before\nbed is a great way to unwind\nuh i've actually been reading my friends\nhave a six month old\nand i go over once a week or something\nand i read a bedtime\none of his books and we sit there and we\nlie on our backs on the floor and i read\nit and he loves like\nhe's six months old yeah he loves like\ngrabbing the book and\nand and it's really beaut i mean\nchildren books are just written so\nbeautifully and i you know i don't have\na child yet but\ni've definitely connected with them so i\nresonate with you tell us some of the\nbest children books you recommend i love\nthe lonely doll\ni love the seven silly eaters good night\nmoon of course\ncrazy strange where the wild things are\noh yeah\nyeah mr rabbit and the and the gift um\nyeah those are picture books and then\nfor chapter books if you haven't read\nchildren's literature lately you are\nmissing out because there are so many\ngreat books you should read historic\nmaterials the trilogy\nand subsequent books by philip pullman\nuh kristin cashore's\nuh graceling trilogy um\nyou know the hunger games is amazing by\nsuzanne collins uh i really i can't even\nlike my mind is staggering because i\nlove children's\nliterature so much there's so much great\nstuff right now oh jason reynolds is a\nfantastic writer he's writing today\nwon every kind of award jaclyn woodson\num\nanyway there's so many great writers\namazing i love it and fifth and final\nquestion i've heard you say people\nknow they don't want what they have but\nthey don't know what they want\nhave you heard do you remember saying\nthis yes and i mean it's hard i mean i\nthink you raised this at the beginning\nof the conversation which is sometimes\nwe don't know ourselves you know we\nthink we\nwe know ourselves but we we know what\nother people expect from us or\nwe know what we wish we expected from\nourselves and so sometimes you\nor you know what you you don't want but\nyou don't know what you do want like and\nback to my\nmy career transition i feel really lucky\nbecause i wanted to write a book so\ndesperately it was like the death star\npulling me in its tractor beam like it\nwas very clear to me what i wanted\nwas a lot of times when people are\nmaking a career shift they know what\nthey\ndon't want but they haven't figured out\nwhat they do want and that's when you\nhave to like read what color is your\nparachute and like do all that soul\nsearching\nand that's painful and hard um because\npeople know what they don't want but\nthey don't know what they\ndo want absolutely thank you gretchen\nand that's your final five thank you for\nbeing\non purpose everyone who's been listening\ngo and grab a copy of the four\ntendencies if you enjoyed
