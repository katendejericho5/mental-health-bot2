communities\nand our planet one bite at a time\nwith the discussion about his latest\nbook food\nfix welcome to the show mark i'm in\nthank you so sweet\nthank you jay so fun to be with you oh\nit's so fun to be with you i loved our\ninstagram live we were just sharing\nwe did that just before lockdown and the\npandemic and\nand everything kind of shifted and i'm\nremembering back to doing it with you\nand i i loved it so much and i'm so glad\nwe're actually getting to spend this\nquality time together now and really\ndive into this great book you've written\nthank you thank you it was a it was\nreally the combination of life's work to\nconnect the dots between everything we\nlove and care about and how they're\nconnected\nin ways that we don't imagine but that\nwe\nactually solve the problem of food we\nsolve the problems\nof chronic disease of the stress in our\neconomy\nof the disintegration of our communities\nof racism\nof environmental destruction climate\nchange national security\nkids education i mean all of this\nconnected to food and\nand it's really such a joy to be able to\nshare how those things are connected and\nactually what we can do about it because\nit's not called food apocalypse it's\ncalled\nfood fix absolutely absolutely and\ni can't wait to dive into all areas of\nthat with you because i think\nwe don't realize how powerful\nand influential food is not just in our\nbodies not just in our minds but in the\nworld\nand i know that inside this book you've\ngone into so many studies and so much\nresearch to really\nshow the impact of food in the world but\ni actually want to start\nsomewhat a bit more personal with you\nbecause i\nuh was discovering some fascinating\nthings about you and this was one that i\nloved\nuh that i feel there's no better way to\nstart this interview than letting our\naudience know that you were a yoga\nteacher before you were a doctor that is\ntrue\ni mean that fascinated me when i was i\nwas like wow that's cool like\nyeah actually i made i majored in\nbuddhism and asian studies in asian\nreligions\nuh in college and um i wasn't going to\nbe a doctor i was going to be a monk\nand i actually decided well you know i'm\nnot sure i want to be a monk maybe i'll\njust try to be a doctor and be a service\nin that way and it was really driven out\nof the\nnotion of compassion and service that\nwas so embedded in buddhism and i\nlearned about in college so yeah and i\nthen become a yoga teacher and\nuh decided to become a doctor after that\nso it wasn't an afterthought and i'm\nstill working at it i love that i love\nthat but when we get onto that it means\nyou're thinking like a monk for sure so\ni i love that but um\ni tell me about how you think that\ntell me a bit more about that compassion\npiece that you were sharing there\nbecause\ni think it's really interesting that you\nknow people get involved\nin medicine for so many reasons people\nget involved in\nbeing authors for so many reasons but it\nsounds like your your kind of foundation\nwas one thing to help people wanting to\nmake a difference yeah that was good\ni mean i think you know when i really\nstudied buddhism you know obviously\nlooking for answers as a young man of 18\n19 years old and what's the truth and\nwhat's the meaning of life and in it i\nrealized it was a description of how to\nheal suffering\nand the focus of buddhism isn't a\nreligion it's a it's a methodology for\nhealing and relieving suffering\nand understanding that the way our minds\nwork that cause us to suffer so much\nand i began to really focus on this\nnotion of how we don't have to suffer\nand why we suffer and and it was really\nthat led me to\nunderstanding that i could actually be\nin that space of service and working on\nhealing through not just you know being\na monk\nbut actually being a doctor and and\nactually helping patients\nand people understand how to heal\nchronic disease which is what i do and\nso i\ni think you know there's so much\nsuffering in the world there's so much\nburden that everybody suffers from both\npsychologically physically and\nso many different ways and i was really\ndrawn to doing something to help\ndeal with that and and that's really\nwhat led me to becoming a doctor\nyeah that's beautiful thank you for\nsharing that i think it's uh\nit's a really unique way of looking at\nit because i think for so many of us\nsometimes we can be dealing with\nphysical or emotional\npain or issues for such a long time\nbefore we even\nthink that there's something we need to\ndo about it yeah sometimes people are\nliving with\nchronic issues for such a long time and\nwe we don't really listen or hear from\nthe body or from the mind what we need\nto change so when you look at it that\nway that you can change\nwhat suffering you choose and what you\nallow in it's it's huge\ntell me uh one more thing oh sorry go on\nyou're going to say something no you'll\nsay you know like\nwhat's your mission in life you know\nit's like it's really to end needless\nsuffering there's some suffering you\ncan't avoid but\nthere there is a lot of needless\nsuffering and and the\nplace where i i feel most effective is\nreally helping people understand that\nthat they they can't heal from chronic\ndisease using a new strategy which is\nfunctional medicine it's really an\napproach of using food as medicine but\nit's understanding the root\ncauses it's understanding the body the\nsystem it's really helping restore and\nregenerate health\nas opposed to treat disease and and\npeople suffer necessarily and i think\nthis this\ngoal of of for my life has really been\nto sort of bring this way of thinking\nand\nand helping people into into a broader\nperspective and that's really what i do\nat cleveland clinic is\nwe're publishing research on this it's\nreally gratifying to see that actually\nthat it's catching on that people now\nunderstand what this is that they\nunderstand that our current medical\nparadigm isn't\nreally solving a lot of their problems\nand you know i i got there because i was\nsick i got very very ill when i was\nyoung from chronic fatigue living in\nchina got mercury poisoning\nand ended up having as you know my body\njust collapsed and i had to literally\nreverse engineer my way to health\nusing principles of functional medicine\nof how to restore my health\nand and i realized it was applicable to\nso many patients you know\npeople with autoimmune diseases and\ndigestive disorders and mood disorders\nand alzheimer's and autism\ndiabetes and metabolic issues all the\nthings that people suffer from that we\ndon't really deal well\nwith traditional medicine is what i\nreally focused on\nyeah that's that's incredible and i love\nhow\nso much of the good we do always comes\nfrom some sort of pain in our own life\nit's you know it's it's it's amazing\nthat you've been able to go and take it\nso far and\nnot just take it far but you're really\nchallenging the status quo let's start\nthere actually\nwe in food fix uh you know i doubt\npeople take the time to actually\nthink that the food industry has an\nagenda of their own\nbut can you share some ways in which the\nindustry is strategic and how it\nadvances its own goals and missions i\nfeel like\noh boy that's a can of worm so uh there\nare uh\na lot of unintended consequences that\nhave led to our current food system that\nwere born out of\ngood intentions right we wanted to feed\nthe world we wanted to\nhave the ability to grow lots of food\nfor a lot of people and provide a lot of\ncalories\nat scale and modernize agriculture and\nand that was happening in the 50s and\n60s which led to this commercialization\nof\nof industrial agriculture which led to\nenormous amounts of\nstarchy industrial food being produced\nright so it was\nwe were all enamored with you know\nastronaut food and processed food and\ntang instead of orange juice and\nunfortunately that's led to\na method of growing food that's produced\nthe worst food on the planet\nit's mostly ultra processed food which\nis made from soy corn and wheat in\ndifferent\nextruded colors size shapes and forms\nit's all deadly\nabout 60 of our calories and it's also\nled to destruction the environment\nthrough destruction of the soil and\nbiodiversity of plants and animals and\ninsects and also stresses on our water\nand and increasing climate change and\nall\nthe pollution from the incredible amount\nof pesticides and herbicides and we use\n6 billion pounds around the world\nof glyphosate which is pretty toxic and\nwe use\nyou know 400 billion pounds of nitrogen\nfertilizer which has all kinds of\ndevastating consequences\nso the way we're growing the food and\nthe food that we're growing is\ndevastating our health and devastating\nplanetary health\nand and and so the problem is that the\nfood industry is the biggest industry on\nthe planet it's 15\nbillion sorry trillion with a t dollar\nindustry\nuh that is now trying to maintain the\nstatus quo unfortunately which\nis not a good one so it wasn't like they\nsaid oh we're going to make people sick\nand fat and we're going to destroy the\nenvironment they just didn't know but\nnow they know\nand so there's a very concert effort to\ncontrol our food policy which is you\nknow what\nas a doctor why would i be caring about\npolitics and food policy but it occurred\nto me as i'm sitting in my office seeing\npatients one-on-one\nthat i can't cure diabetes in my office\nit's cured in the kitchen in the grocery\nstore on the farm\nand i need to sort of look upstream and\nlook at the root causes and\nthey begin to say well what's causing\nthe food that they're eating that's\nmaking them sick well it's the\nfood system what causes the food system\nit's our food policies and\nwhy do we have the food policies we have\nbecause it's a food lobby that drives\nthat and so they drive a lot of the\nstatus quo\nand that and they do it in in in they do\nit in government policy and we spend\nhalf a billion dollars just on the farm\nbill\nuh in one year in 19 i think in 2005\nthe uh the gmo labeling law was defeated\nuh because the food industry\ncollectively spent 192 million dollars\non one\nbill in the lobby uh and they do this uh\nby\ndriving our dietary guidelines policy\nour agricultural policies they promote\nthe growth of these\num raw materials or commodities for\nultra processed food\nthey do it through controlling what we\ncan say on food labels\nuh they control the the restrictions on\nmarketing so we can't actually limit\nmarketing for\njunk food and across the whole you know\nmultiple ten agencies of the government\nthere's\nthere's so many policies that are\ninfluencing our food system that are\noften\nat odds with each other contradictory\nbut they're in the interest of the food\nindustry\nso so that's happening and then they're\nalso co-opting science so\nthe national institute of health spends\na billion dollars\non research for nutrition food industry\nspends 12 billion most of its propaganda\nlike\nyou know if the dairy council says milk\nis nature's perfect food well all the\nstudies show that or\ncoca-cola finds it you know when they\nfund a study that obesity has nothing to\ndo with soda\nyou know so it doesn't make sense they\nalso\nfund uh uh groups that are friend groups\nlike the american council on science and\nhealth which sounds like a great noble\ncause with crop life or\nyou know uh the group for sustainable\nagriculture and they're all\nfront groups for the food industry to\npropagate their agenda\nand create misinformation uh and then\nthere's the co-op\nuh public health groups like the\namerican heart association american\ndiabetes association\nacademy nutrition dietetics 40 of their\nbudget\nis from the food industry so they're\nthey're they're not giving independent\nadvice\nand then they they co-op uh social\ngroups like the naacp\nand hispanic federation and groups that\nare doing you know good in the world\nthey fund them for for example i i was\num i was\nshowing a movie as that was in this a\nnumber of years called fed up which is\nabout childhood obesity\nand the the problems we have with the\nfood industry and sugar and starch\nand i went down there and i met with the\nthe head of the ebony baptist church\nwhich is martin luther king's church met\nwith his\ndaughter bernice king and they were very\nexcited to get behind this and and have\na screening at the king center atlanta\nand i was excited about this and a few\ndays later i got a call said we can't\nhave this\nshowing at the king center i'm like why\nso well coca-cola funds the food\nindustry\nfunds the king center so it's pretty\nfrightening when you see all these\ndifferent\nstrategies to target certain groups to\nput out wrong science to support\nmisinformation through these front\ngroups\nthrough influencing public health groups\nthrough controlling policy\nand and it's it's it's a really\ndevastating\neffect which has led to the fact that\nsix out of ten americans have a chronic\ndisease that 75 percent of us\nare overweight that 42 are obese that 88\nare metabolically unhealthy i mean just\ntake that in for a minute 12 percent of\namericans are metabolically healthy\nthat means 88 are not and and these\npeople are more risk for covet 19\nand other other chronic diseases so we\nreally have this this crisis moment here\nand and i think we need to understand\nhow all these things are related\nand then we need to design a strategy to\nto both from a\ngrassroots level from a business\ninnovation level\nfrom philanthropy and from clearly\npolicy to change what's happening\nwow i mean that that is uh\none news update in in a great way i was\nwith you the whole time\nyou know when when i hear that and i\nthink about my community my audience\nlistening or watching or\nor anyone consuming this right now it's\nlike\nit can feel very overwhelming\nto an individual for the individual that\nyes\ndoesn't have the feeling of just like\nthere's two things that come to mind one\nis like\ndo these people realize that they're\nactually destroying people's lives\nbecause you know it almost at the end of\nthe day\nit's like you said it's not a conspiracy\ntheory it's not like it started that way\nbut now that people are aware\nand we continue to fund it in that\ndirection\nit may leave people feeling quite\nhelpless where is a great place for\npeople to get started of course this\nbook\nfor people to get educated because i\nfeel like the biggest challenge\nin making choices when you're like oh my\ngod i can't trust the labels\ni can't trust uh the the ingredients on\nthe back\nwhere do people trust where do they find\ntrust\nis really yeah well you know i spent a\nlot of time when i wrote the book food\nfix to\ndive into practical solutions both for\nindividuals\nfor businesses policies and i created a\nfood fix action guide it's free they can\ngo to foodfixbook.com and download it\nessentially it gives you 20 of the top\nthings you can do as citizens and\nindividuals\nto have an impact to change change your\nhealth\nand change society and change planetary\nhealth and drive policy and drive\nbusinesses\nand it works when we when we change what\nwe want to do we vote with our\nwallet we vote with our voice we vote\nwith our fork and we vote with our vote\nwe see massive change i mean general\nmills and danone which are two\nbig food companies are now funding\nfarmers to convert their lands to\nregenerative agriculture\nso they're literally stepping up and\ndoing what the government isn't doing\nand funding farmers to transform\nagriculture to produce nutrient-dense\nfood in a way that restores the soil\nrestores the plant nutrition and\nrestores human health\nthat that's groundbreaking and it's\nbecause we we can make those choices so\ni talk about how do you become a\nregenetarian how do you regenerate your\nown health\nand how do you regenerate planetary\nhealth and our social communities\nand their health and it's pretty simple\nright it's eating real food it's\nnot buying into the industrial food that\nwe're all eating which is hard to do for\nsome people but i get real clear\nresources on\nwhat to look for where to buy things\nwhere to buy things that are not\nnecessarily expensive because people\nthink it's expensive to do this but\nactually can be done\nreally at scale in a way that isn't\ngoing to break the bank\nyou have to become a smart consumer you\nhave to read food labels\nyou have to seek out different sources\nof food whether it's community support\nagriculture or farmers markets\nor or online retailers that sell direct\nto consumer\nlike thrive market or mariposa ranch\nwhich actually sell regeneratively\nraised\nbeef and other animal foods that are\nreally healthy for you and there's\nthings you can do if you if you get\ninspired in your own community\nyou can be an agent of change right\nmaybe you want to get your local\ngovernment to start a compost ordinance\nyou'll compost your food because\nfood waste is a huge problem like 40 of\nour food is wasted and\nit's one of the biggest drivers of\nclimate change it's bigger there's a\nbigger contributor methane\nthan cows and it's all your vegetables\nyou're throwing in the\nin the compost that i mean in the in the\nlandfill and\nyou can you can actually um start to\nunderstand how to\nhow to do these things for yourself you\nmaybe have a compost pile in your in\nyour group if you want to become an\nactive activist you can\nturn up the heat on your politicians and\nand food companies by\nfinding organizations that are doing it\nand supporting them or\nlobbying your representatives i mean you\ncan actually\nhave an impact locally and you can\ndecide maybe you want to work in your\nschool and help the\nschool lunch and nutrition be better and\npeople have done that and so in the book\njust full of examples of actually how to\ntake control of your own health and your\nown life and your own community\nand it's working i mean it's why we're\nseeing the changes we're seeing\nyeah absolutely and thank you for\ncreating that action guide everyone\nthat's foodfixbook.com\nif you want to go and grab that because\ni think that's what people are looking\nfor i really believe that\npeople are looking for action guides\nbecause that's where they know they need\nto start and\none of the things i'm fascinated by when\ni was looking at the book\nand i've been looking at your work you\ntalk about how i think it's like the\naverage\nchild between something like 2 and\n13 or 14 you say like sees on average\nlike\n10 to 11 junk food ads per day on oh\nit's terrible i mean the average kid\nsees probably\n10 000 ads a year and that's television\nnow we're seeing stealth advertising so\nthis a lot of these studies were done on\nfood marketing to kids it was there's\nabout\n17 billion dollars spent in 2004 when it\nwas tracked\non junk food advertising to kids and the\nworst the food\nthe the more the ads and the the worse\nthe ads were so\nand and now facebook for example last\nyear had\nyou know 500 billion ads\nfor junk food on facebook\nright it's just it's just unbelievable\nhow much and they're stealth\nuh games for kids like advert games\nwhere they're literally embedded\npropaganda for food companies so little\nmcdonald's go to the mcdonald's store\nand go to you know get your burger king\nwhatever it's\nit's it's terrifying so we see the the\nbiggest impact actually is this\nchanges in food marketing and in this\ncountry there's the first amendment you\ncan't restrict people's right first you\nknow\nright right to free speech and it's you\nknow but i don't think there's any\nlaw that prohibits us from protecting\nour children from these kinds of\nmessages because they can't tell the\ndifference between\nuh reality and an ad until they're about\neight or nine years old\nand they're targeting these kids and in\nchile when they actually\nrepealed the ability or remove the\nability for these companies to market\nbetween 6 a.m and like i think 10 p.m\nthe there was dramatic reduction in the\nuse of these foods and dramatic\nreductions in obesity\nbut this country doesn't want to do that\nbecause it's it's such a it's such a big\nmoney maker for these companies\nyeah that's that's that's really\nalarming because ultimately\nthe people making the decisions are\nobviously aware that\nthe food's not healthy for people and\nit's not\ngoing to benefit their body or their\nmind but they still\ncontinue to invest in you know creating\nchallenges for kids\nand you know i always whenever i get\nasked\nrandomly to invest or\nbe a spokesperson for different brands\nor whatever it may be and\nuh whenever it's something that's aimed\nat young people i'm always just like\nwell would you\nlet how old you i always ask you how do\nyour son or daughter and then tell me\ntheir age and i'll be like\nwould you recommend them to use this\nproduct and the amount of times i've\nheard people say\nno i wouldn't but i'm like but you're\nselling this like that you know and it\nit i'm just so confused by that do you\nthink that that's\ndo you think that's the level at which\nwe have to change it like it needs to\nchange on the level where\npeople go my profitability is not\nimportant not as\nimportant as people's children like yeah\ni think that's changing you know i was\nreally excited to hear you know there's\na group called the business roundtable\nwhich is all the top\nbusinesses in america they get together\nthe ceos and\nthe last meeting they they made a stand\nthey said we have to look not only at\nshareholder value\nbut stakeholder value meaning what is\nthe impact\nof our company on our customers on the\nworkers\nyou know on the environment you know who\nare the stakeholders\nin the products we're creating and it's\nnot just about profit and shareholder\nvalue\nwhich i thought was a big step forward\nso i think we're seeing more\nmovements towards conscious capitalism\nbut there's definitely entrenched\ncompanies that just don't want to change\nand\nthey're not they're not going to do it\nvoluntarily so there has to be sort of a\nparallel system that grows up\nthat that shows that this can happen and\ni think we're doing it and i want it to\nhappen faster\nbut i i think it's i think it's\nhappening yeah and how much of it is\nalso and and i know you\nyou know the answer to this but it's how\nmuch of it also is\nis our addiction and the habits\nbecause of the way those products have\nbeen created so we also find it hard to\nlet go of them so i'll give you a\npersonal example\nyou know i grew up eating four sugar\nproducts a day\nuh when i was young and so sorry for\nchocolate products today sorry not fresh\nchocolate products today and so i would\neat a chocolate biscuit a chocolate bar\na chocolate ice cream and a chocolate\nyogurt nearly every day of my life\nand i was overweight as a child uh i\nstruggled with it whether it was\nbullying or whether\nit was just feeling unhealthy and as i\ngrew older i started to realize that i\nwas addicted to sugar especially in\nchocolate\nand i got so used to having it and it\ntook me to who i've talked to you about\nbefore meeting my wife\nwho was able to find me alternatives\nbecause that's what i said to my wife i\nwas like\ni need an alternative if i'm gonna have\nto shake this habit yeah\nand so i ended up finding things\nsweetened with monk fruit and\nyeah and other things which have been\namazing but that's good for you monk\nfruit right\ni know how ironic i do not own the brand\ni have any affiliation with it\nwhatsoever\nbut but the intriguing thing to me about\nthat is that there\nare alternatives that exist but but i\nwant to share this for the audience it's\nlike\ni get what it feels like to be\naddicted to a food that may not be good\nfor you but tell us about how much we're\naddicted to these things yeah i mean\nthis is a real\nproblem jay and i think most people\ndon't realize it and they internalize\nthe feelings they have about what they\neat and blame themselves so oh why can't\ni stop eating this oh i'm gaining weight\ni just can't stop myself and they\nthey think it's their fault that they're\noverweight or that they're sick\nand that is just a bunch of nonsense and\nscientific nonsense because\nwhen you look at the science of of these\nfoods these ultra processed\npulverized foods that are high in starch\nand sugar they're really designed\nto hijack our brain chemistry our\nhormones and our metabolism in a very\nspecific way\nand and the um\nthese companies have organizations\ncalled taste\ninstitutes where they hire craving\nexperts\nin the science of craving and they they\ndesign their products in a specific way\nto create the bliss point of the food\nwhat is that perfect crunch taste sugar\nwhatever it is salt\nis going to make you go boom and have\nthis pleasure sensation\nand it's about dopamine it's like heroin\nor cocaine and it works in the same area\nof the brain\nand and it's not just a theory they know\nthis uh of course they deny it although\none of one of the top executives from\none of the big soda companies\nsaid to me mark you want to come to our\nlab and\nsee see what we've done we've actually\nbeen able to extract the taste buds from\nhumans\nand we grow them in a culture in the lab\nand then we can stimulate them and see\nwhat's happening\nlike you do not want me to go in there\nbecause i don't put this all over social\nmedia\nand uh it's a very scary thing and so\nthe science has shown for example that\nif you take a group of overweight guys\nand one day you give them\na milkshake that's a regular milkshake\nand the next day you get my trick\nmilkshake which is\nexactly the same except for the way in\nwhich the sugar is absorbed so there's\nstarch and there's the same carbohydrate\nthe same protein the same fat the same\nfiber the same calories\nexactly the same and they taste the same\nso they don't know what they're drinking\nwhen they found that when they had the\none that had the sugar that was absorbed\nquickly\ncompared to the one that's absorbed\nslowly it\ncreated this pattern in their brain that\nlit up the same area called the nucleus\naccumbens as heroin or cocaine\nand you can see it on a functional mri\nso this is not just a theory that\noh it's maybe addictive it's not really\na true addiction\nit actually is and when they looked at\ntheir other biomarkers or blood levels\nof insulin sugar\nadrenaline cortisol stress hormones you\nliterally eat sugar your stress hormones\ngo up\nso you can be meditating all day but if\nyou're eating sugar all day you know\nyou're in trouble\nand i think we don't understand how\npowerful these foods are and how they\nhijack our biology\nbut within a very short time literally\njust 10 days or less\nyou literally can reset your biology\nreset your brain chemistry reset your\nhormones and your taste buds and\nget out and i remember i ran this uh\ncourse once in a couple which is a yoga\ncenter near me i know it yeah yeah and\num and it was it was it was sort of a\nsugar detox and this woman came in she's\nlike there's no way i can do this i've\nbeen addicted to sugar my whole time my\nwhole life i'm never gonna be able to\nget off this\ni said just do exactly what i'm saying\nand just try to do this and eat in a way\nthat's gonna reset your biology because\nfood is medicine and she's like okay\ni'll try it\nwith day two she's like i can't believe\nit anymore cravings i don't want it i\ndon't need it\nit's like my whole biology has changed\nso i think people can be very empowered\nby\nby making those kinds of changes and and\ndoes it\njust just to dive into that slightly a\ntiny bit more does should that change\nfor people be\nextreme or is it incremental so it's\nlike let's say someone's listening they\ngot it they they\nare consuming too much sugar or they're\nhaving too many sodas or whatever is it\nlike they should go the next\nno sodas what's that almost that 10-day\nprogram what\nyeah so do you have like one ounce less\nof soda a day or\n12 sodas is 11 okay you know i\ni think as a doctor um you know i want\npeople to be able to have the experience\nof health\nyou know it's like an awakening i want\nthem to actually quickly be able to\nexperience that so i\nusually convince people to do a dramatic\nchange for a short time\nyou know like a week or ten days and\nthen their bodies tell them\nhow they feel like oh my god my\nmigraines are gone my digestion is\nbetter i'm sleeping better\nmy sinus drip is gone you know my skin's\nclearing up my acne is gone i feel\nbetter i don't cravings\nmy energy is good and they go well wow\ni'm getting the connection between what\ni eat\nand how i feel so i always like to give\npeople that experience and i i\ncreated a program called the 10 day\nreset uh and it's essentially\ngiving them that opportunity you can\ndownload it free at getpharmacy.com it's\njust a simple way of eating\nin a specific time frame in a specific\nway that's going to really regulate your\nyour biology\nbecause every bite of food you take\nregulates\nyour entire biology it changes your gene\nexpression it changes your hormones your\nbrain chemistry your immune system your\nmicrobiome\neverything literally with every bite and\nwhen you understand that\nyou can upgrade or downgrade your\nbiology literally with every bite\nyour biological software can change you\ncan really see\nrapid changes and we've seen incredible\nthings from people you know getting off\ninsulin in three days\nfor example so it's really powerful and\npeople make the choice to try this and i\nthink\nyou know tiny steps and tiny habit\nchanges are good\nand vijay fog talks about this for some\nthings but i think\nif you really want to see the power of\nthis you know a short-term\ndramatic change can give you enormous\nbenefit\ni'm completely with you on that i i\nthink that\nwhen you experience something\nimmersively in an extreme way\nyou're more likely to quickly feel the\nbenefits of it\nand to recognize it's powerful now that\nmay mean you may go back to your old\nhabit quicker\nbut you now know what you're trying to\nmove towards as opposed to not having a\ntangible experience so\ni'm perfectly with you i wanted to check\nthat with it with an expert\nthat definitely i i can totally relate\nuh relate to that\ntell me about you talk a lot about in\nthe book and and what i'm really trying\nto do for anyone who's listening or\nwatching right now is\nthe book is just fun and you can already\ntell dr mark hyman is a phenomenal\nstoryteller he's got\na ton of great studies that you know i\ni'm a i'm massively into studies and so\nthat is i'm like i i get really\nfascinated and intrigued the book is\nfull of the the insights\nthe the tools and the actions that you\ncan take in each of these areas\nbut i do believe that the first step is\neducation and awareness so i'm hoping\nthat as you're listening to this\nthe podcast is going to give you the\ninsight\nabout each of these areas of our life\nthat food impacts\nbut when you read the book that's going\nto give you the full set of\nyou know what part of it you need to\nchange and where the action is so\nwhat i'm fascinated by the book is you\ntalk a lot about how there's\nfood racism and i think that this\nis so obviously uh\nrelevant right now yeah and it's so\nimportant for people to understand\nbecause\ni think either we don't believe it\nexists or we're so consumed by it that\nwe we're not going to\nexplain that concept to us well i mean i\nthink you know we\nwe have certain populations in this\ncountry that are so disproportionately\naffected\nby chronic disease uh and by poor health\nuh the african-american community\nhispanic community native american\ncommunities\nand when you look at covet 19 it is\nfar and away hurting these populations\nmore than anybody else you know for\nexample in louisiana and chicago\nafrican americans are 30 of the\npopulation but 70\nof the deaths you know native americans\nare experiencing the same thing\nand and they if you're african-american\nin america you have twice the rate of\ngetting diabetes you have\nprobably four times the rate of getting\nkidney failure and three and a half\ntimes\nuh likely uh to get amputations because\nof diabetes\nuh you're uh and you're targeted more\nthan the\nthe rest of the population then food\nmarketing is often more directed to\nminorities uh and and we see this this\nis from yale's\nstudies that have shown that we actually\nare targeting these populations more so\nthere\nthese health disparities are huge and\nthere are a lot of reasons for it i mean\nthere's\ncalled structural violence you know we\ntalk about structural racism\nbut there's a bigger concept which is\nwhat are the structural violence the\nsocial economic political\nconditions environmental conditions that\nare driving disease\nright we see this with other infectious\ndisease or chronic disease\nand and this is what we have in america\nwe have this structural violence that\nhas led to\nincredible amounts of disease in these\npopulations it's it's\nleading to these health disparities and\nwe we have to understand why\nand the reasons are complex right\nthere's the racism issues and the\nsegregation we had and the lack of\naccess to education\nhousing and opportunity and funding and\nthere's a lot of issues but\nthe problem with food is that is it it\ndrives these populations to be\nmore sick less able to learn in school\nless able to succeed in life and more\nlikely to get disability in chronic\ndisease as they get older so\nwe see this sort of just dismantling of\nthese populations and scale in ways that\nwe don't see\nin other populations and it's it's uh\nit's really heartbreaking because it's\nit's so fixable and i've seen this\nhappen you know i\nit went down and it's even if you're\npoor and you're white a lot of these\nthings are still evident and\nit's part of that movie fed up i went\ndown to this little town in easley south\ncarolina\nthere was a family of five living in a\ntrailer food stamps and disability the\nfather was 42 already on dialysis from\nkidney failure from diabetes\nthe mother was like overweight two plus\n100 pounds\nthe son was practically diabetic at 16.\nand i said listen\ni'm not going to lecture you let's just\ncook a meal together here's what's in\nyour kitchen\nlike here's all the junk and i showed\nthem everything that they were eating\nthey thought was fine\na cool whip which said zero trans fat\nbut was all trans fat because\nthe fda left a loophole that said if you\nhave less than half a gram per serving\nyou can say no trans fat but it's all\nair so it's just like it's just\nall the food industry influence and they\nwere like horrified and then i said\nlet's cook a meal of turkey chili let's\ncreate\na nice salad with olive oil and vinegar\ndressing and salt and pepper let's\nstir fry some asparagus let's roast some\nsweet potatoes\nsimple simple meal it wasn't expensive\nuh\nand they they actually loved it they\nnever cooked in their kitchen before\nand i just get a little bit education i\nsaid here's a guide\non on how to eat well for less good food\non a tight budget from the environmental\nworking group\nand uh where i'm on the board and i and\ni gave them a cookbook i said you can do\nthis and they did it and within a year\nthey lost 200 pounds together the father\nwas able to lose enough to get\na new kidney the son lost 50 but then\nwent to work at bojangles which is a\nfast food restaurant down in the south\nand still facing a job for these kids\nthere and he gained 50 pounds it's like\nit's playing an alcoholic to work in a\nbar\nand and then he figured it out and he\nlost 138 pounds and he got into medical\nschool he asked me to write a letter\nrecommendation so\npeople can can actually come out of this\nif they're given the right education\ntools but i've worked in these\ncommunities and populations\nand they just don't know they just are\nunaware of this sort of level of food\nracism and food\nuh and food um even apartheid is\nhappening in these communities where you\nsee\nthe lack of ability to access food and\nlack of ability to find\nyou know quality ingredients because\nthey're buying food at the gas station\nthat's where they get their food\nyeah thank you so much for raising\nawareness about this super important\nissue because i feel like\nit's it's just not talked about no\nno yeah no it's internalized you know\nlike i i went on a rafting trip and i\nwrite a story in the book uh\nwith a hopi chief was a native american\nchief and they he lives in one of the\noldest\nuh inhabited cities in america robbie\nwhich has been somebody's lived in there\nfor over a thousand years\nand he was very very overweight and he\nwas just struggling to get down to the\nraft and threw up because he just was so\nout of shape and we got on the raft and\nwe kind of got to know each other i said\nyou know\nyou can actually fix this you can get\nrid of your diabetes\nand so what do i have to do he said well\num i i said well you have to get rid of\nthe starch and sugar in your diet the\nsodas and sweets and all that\nhe's like wow well okay but what are we\ngonna do for our traditional hopi\nceremonial foods we have these\ntraditional hopey ceremonial foods and\ni'm like\nwhat foods it's like cookies cakes\npies i'm like thinking to myself those\nare not your traditional ceremonial\nfoods and what's happened was that the\ngovernment\nput everybody on renovations they cut\noff their food supply and their\ntraditional\nways of hunting or fishing or even\ngrowing food they diverted and hopefully\nas they diverted their water so they had\nno access to\nrivers anymore and then they piled in\nthese commodity foods\nflour sugar and shortening right\nand that became their diet and they\nthese government commodities were the\nstaples so they made\nindian fried bread and indian tacos\nthere was nothing indian about that\nand and and these foods are so so\ntoxic and now that's why we see 80 of\nthem have diabetes by the time they're\n30 and life expectancy in some of these\ncommunities\nis is 46. and it's terrible and\nit's not just the native american\ncommunities but he's internalized this\nthis\nfood concepts that he thinks are his\ntraditional foods and this is in\ntrue in the african american communities\nlatino communities uh and\nyou know i think in chicago um there's\nsomething called the chicago loop if you\nlive outside the loop\nyour life expectancy is 16 years less if\nyou take a subway from midtown manhattan\nto the bronx which is a very poor\nafrican-american communities\nyour life expectancies goes down six\nmonths for every subway stop\nyou know to harlem and then to the bronx\nso these things are\nare really not talked about much and i\ngave a lecture\na few years ago was on the 50th\nanniversary of martin luther king\njunior's\nassassination at the harlem riverside\nchurch and it was really about food\noppression and\nyou know it was a little intimidating\nfor me because mostly african-american\ncommunity i'm a white jewish guy\nfrom new york and what do i know about\nit\nbut uh it was it was you know governor\ncuomo spoke there i spoke and\nand i i just was able to share what i\nwas seeing\nfrom the science and from the data about\nhow these communities were being\naffected\nand it was it was an incredible response\nand people really resonating with a very\nshort ten minute talk you can find it\nonline\njust do hymen food impression you'll\nfind it but it's it\nsort of is really catapulted me into\nreally trying to raise these issues\nbecause\nwe can't we can't resurrect our\ncommunities unless we have resurrect our\nhealth\nand and we can't resurrect our health\nunless we resurrect our food and we\ncan't\nresurrect our food until we fix the food\nsystem and fix the agriculture\nand sort of pull that thread that\nconnects everything together\nyeah absolutely and what i'm trying to\ndo in our interview today is\nis really understand that the the role\nof the individual and educating the\nindividual because i feel like if the\nindividual is educated\nthen we'll start to see this real change\ntell me about we've talked\nwe've definitely tapped into this but we\ntalked a lot about how it impacts our\nphysical health\nbut i know in the book you also talk\nabout how nutrition\nand food can actually be medicine for\nour mental health yeah\nand and i think that this is this link\nagain i i feel like\nwhat you're doing in the book is just\ntopics that i at least at least i can be\nhonest and say\ni'm not hearing about in a\nnon-conspiracy theory\nif i hear about some of this stuff it's\nalways who loves conspiracy theories\ni don't love conspiracy theories i i\nlike uh i like\ndata and and fact and discussion and\nchange yeah\nnation and so that's what i think you do\nso well in this book but let's\ntalk to me about the connection between\nmental health\nand and our diets yeah you know uh jay\nit was it was\na surprise to me i i was practicing\nfunctional medicine\nworking with patients they come up with\nthese physical complaints they'd have an\nautoimmune disease or they would have\nsome digestive issues or whatever was\ngoing on\nor they'd have add whatever and i and i\nwould i would\ntreat them and restore their health by\ndealing with\nrestoring these basic biological systems\nyour gut your immune system your\ndetoxification system your hormones\nall the things that we we do in\nfunctional medicine\nand and a lot of it's using food as\nmedicine\nand then they would report back dr hyman\ni don't know what happened but my\ndepression is gone\nmy panic attacks are gone my aed is\nbetter\nmy memory is better my brain fog's gone\ni'm like\nwhat's going on here and i began to\nreally investigate what was happening\nand i sort of jokingly call myself the\naccidental psychiatrist because\ni was treating people's body and their\nbrain was getting better\nand i began to realize that you know\nlet's just take depression for example\nyou know depression turns out is an\ninflammatory disease\nwhich we don't think of it's like you\nknow it's like a sore throat but it's in\nyour brain\nand your brain you know doesn't hurt but\nit can be depressed or feel sad or be\nanxious or\nhave ocd or atd or whatever and\nand so it has different ways of\nexpressing that inflammation whether\nit's alzheimer's even as an inflammatory\ndisease autism is inflammatory\nand the question is what's driving the\ninflammation and it's our primarily our\ninflammatory process\nnutrient poor diet that's this\nindustrial diet it's lacking the\nnutrients that our bodies and our brains\nneed to function\nand i i just saw case after case after i\nstarted people on a whole foods diet\ntook off the processed food got rid of\ninflammatory foods like gluten dairy got\nrid of sugar\ngave them give them a moment to sort of\nheal and then put in the nutrients that\ntheir bodies needed\nmiracles were happening and i and i\nbegan to sort of go wow you know the\nbody is so connected to the brain\nand so yes there's a mind-body effect\nbut there's also a body\nmind effect and that body mind effect is\nworth\nfixing because you can do something\nabout it you know\nif you want to deal with your mental\nhealth issues if you want to become\nenlightened\nit's a lot easier to do it if you deal\nwith the problems first you know if\nyou're if your gut is healthy\nif you are not low thyroid functioning\nif your\nnutrition levels are vitamin d is good\nor your b12 level is good it's much\neasier\nto actually get to what you want to do\nin terms of your spiritual\ngoals or your personal goals if you are\nfeeling good\nright it's a lot harder to get\nenlightened if you're mercury poisoning\nor you have you know some nasty thing\ngoing on in your body\nand so so this really was the the\ngenesis of this book the ultramine\nsolution about how we\nfix our minds and our bodies by fixing\nour body first\nsomething we don't have to work on our\nminds as well because that's that's\nthat's your lane\nbut but it's uh it's it's it was it was\nsuch an insight for me to go wow there's\nso many people suffering\nfrom mental health issues that are\ndriven by physical issues\nno it's it's 1 000 it's all\ninterconnected and even i find like\nsometimes people need their minds help\nto change their body and they need their\nbodies help to change their mind it's\nit's you know it's\nand i think the the fixation over either\nor or where do i start it's almost like\nwe need to be absorbed in all of it like\ni found that and i i can identify with\nwhat you're saying\nthat i was someone who focused a lot on\nmy mind and was able to find a lot of\npeace and calm in my mind but then i\nfound that i'd neglected my body\nand it's almost like real alignment in\nyour life is felt when your body and\nmind are\naligned right you can't have a advanced\nmind and a\nneglected body that's not alignment\nthat's going to constantly cause\nfriction in your life\nand it's the same with what you're\nsaying where if people are feeling mind\nfog\nor uh struggling with a mental health\nillness\nand they're not taking care of their\nbody and like you said their brain\nyeah then then again you can't switch\nthat so i\ni totally see the interconnectedness and\ni hope more and more people listening\nwill realize that when you read the book\nfood fix\nthat you'll be able to start making\nthose tweaks that you need to in your\nlifestyle\nyeah even education you know we talk\nabout in the book and how\nour kids are so impaired i mean you know\none in 10 kids has\nadd kids have learning difficulties\ndyslexia\nchallenges with you know academic\nperformance and the cdc put out a report\nthat i talked about in the book on\nthe influence of nutrition on academic\nperformance and it's massive you know\nhow do kids\nlearn when they're eating junk food and\ngoing to\nschool in the morning with flaming hot\nchips and a coke\nthey can't function and they crash and\nso\nproviding good nutrition can have\nradical effects on kids academic\nperformance and close what we call an\nachievement gap\nand i think it also affects behavior and\nyou know we think about mood\nbut one of the things i was shocked to\ndiscover is that is it violence and\nviolent behavior and aggression\nare also connected to our diet and in\nprison studies that i talk about in the\nbook\nprisoners who are fed who are violent\nwho are fed a whole foods healthy diet\nin prison\ncan you reduce violent crime by 56 and\nif you add a multivitamin it goes down\nby 80 percent\nif you do it in kids in juvenile\ndetention centers these kids 91\nreduction in bad behavior and violence\n100 reduction in suicides\ni mean it's so staggering and if there\nwas a pill that could do that\neverybody'd be taking it there'd be a\ngiant pharmaceutical company marketing\nand\nwe don't hear about these issues because\nthey're they're not something that's\ngoing to create billions of dollars in\nprofit but\nunfortunately it's where the it's\nwhether\nwhere the real effect can be yeah\nabsolutely\nabsolutely everyone i want to recommend\nthat you uh not only go listen to the\ndoctor's pharmacy podcast but you also\ncheck out the book\nfood fix that i have next to me right\nnow again huge recommended\nrecommendation\nfor the book a to get educated become\naware of\nwhat's really happening what's working\nin the background that's going to give\nyou enough\nconfidence and enough of a reason\nand a why to go and actually make the\nchanges in your life it's really\neasy to live in ignorance and in the\npain and just allow for it to continue\nand feel like\nit's only because something outside's\nimpacting you but actually take\nresponsibility for our health and our\nfutures\nis huge and if not for yourself then at\nleast your children yeah and the future\ngenerations and and dr mark hyman\ni believe you're doing such a a great uh\nservice honestly you really are in\nin raising all of these issues in all\nareas in the depth of the research and\nthe lens you've gone through to share\nthis with us uh i'm\nsuper super grateful thank you we we end\nevery interview with something called\nthe final five which are your\nuh fast five round which is answers in\none word to one sentence maximum okay\nall right\nand uh dr ivan these are your final\nfives so question number one\nuh what's the best change you've made in\nyour diet\nthe best change i made was to\ndramatically cut out starch and sugar i\ndon't\neliminate it but i really don't eat any\nflour products and if i eat sugar it's\nusually part of\nsome whole food right maybe i'll have a\nyou know whole huge chocolate which i\nlove\nwhich is you know very low glycemic um\nand i think that and getting rid of\nindustrial food is has been the best\nthings i've done i love that of course\nyou know adding in all the good stuff\nof course super practical okay great uh\nsecond question\nwhat do you know to be absolutely true\nabout health\nthat a lot of people would disagree with\nyou\nwow that's a good question no one's ever\nasked me that jay\ni think that the biggest thing that\npeople don't understand is that\nuh you know the way we define disease\nis completely wrong so our normal\nconception of disease is completely\nflawed because it's not based on causes\nit's based on symptoms\nso i think people just don't understand\nthat and so if you focus on causes\nnot symptoms and treat that the root\ncause people get better\ni love that great answer all right third\nquestion uh what gives you the biggest\nhope for the food industry\ni see i see hope because i see these\nfood companies waking up i see companies\nlike general mills\nand danone and other companies and\nnestle really understanding that\nthis can't go on that their their\nsurvival depends on\ntransforming our food system so i i see\nthe\nthey see the culture shifting and people\ndemanding more\nconsciousness about their food so i'm\nexcited about that\nawesome question number four what's the\nbiggest lesson you've learned in the\nlast 12 months\nwow well i've been traveling for 25\nyears and on the road and covet has\nhas locked me down and i've realized\nthat\nuh having a rhythm and stability\nand quiet and time to think is actually\na good thing\nand i and i think i've i've really\nlearned that it's time in my life to\nto shift how i'm doing things so i can\nactually cultivate more of that\nthat's brilliant and your fifth and\nfinal question is if you could create a\nlaw\nthat everyone in the world would have to\nfollow what would it be\noh a law that everyone have to follow um\nwell i think it would be it would be a\nlaw that would be\nthat all governments would implement\nthat that would influence every single\npolicy\naround food which would be quality is\nking\nso no food policy can be made unless\nit's putting\nthe quality of nutrition and nutritional\ndensity first in every single\nthing we do whether it's dietary\nguidelines or what food we grow or what\nfood we market or whatever it is\nit's going to transform everything if we\ncan do that\ni love that that's beautiful i'm\nactually going to ask you one more\nquestion does this come to my mind\ndo you think that it's possible to\ncreate healthy food that's affordable\nabsolutely i mean the studies are really\nclear that it may cost 50 cents more a\nday to eat healthier and\nlike i said there are guys like good\nfood on a tight budget that are\nare actually incredibly effective in\nhelping people eat well for less it's\ngood for them good for the\nplanet and good for their wallet and i i\nthink we get caught up in you know sort\nof elitism about eating healthy but it\nreally\nthis family in south carolina they lived\non food stamps and disability\nfor a family of five and they were able\nto do it in one of the worst food\ndeserts in america\nso it's really more about education and\nawareness than it is about money\nthat's great to hear awesome dr mark\nhyman thank you so much\nuh for being a guest on on purpose what\ni'd love for everyone to do is tag\nme and dr mark hyman on instagram with\nyour favorite insights your favorite\nuh thought or idea or concept or fact\nthat mark hyman stated today that\nstayed with you and how you're going to\nexperiment with your diet i'd love for\nyou all to think about\nwhat is that deep dive experiment you\ncan do for the next seven days\nwhat could you remove from your diet or\nadd to your diet\nuh based on the insights in the book\nbased on the guidance in the book that\nyou think is gonna make a massive change\ntry and experiment\nfor just seven days for one week and see\nhow your life changes\nand as i said go out and grab a copy of\nthe book we'll put the links\nin the podcast description so you can go\nstraight to amazon and grab your copy uh\ndr mark hyman is there anything that i\nhaven't asked you that you'd love to\nshare\nnot nothing other than i think you know\nwe're in this moment where everybody\nuh it can focus in on their own health\nand by doing that they will literally\nhelp us get through this cobit epidemic\nand help solve so many of our global\nproblems because what we do to ourselves\nwe do to our communities and our\nfamilies and what we do to ourselves we\ndo to the planet\nand so understanding that is a circle\nand that we can actually impact that by\nmaking those small changes in ourselves\nuh i think is very a very powerful\nmessage people understand\nthank you so much this is great thank\nyou everyone for listening and i'll see\nyou again next week\nhey everyone my name is jay shetty and\nwelcome to my youtube channel\nevery
