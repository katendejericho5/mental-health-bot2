    "transcript": "i was a junior in high school and\ncouldn't read that well a fourth grade\nreading level\nbecause i would i would cheat on\neverything and i learned how to read i\nlearned how to write\ni taught myself all these things all\nthese disciplines but whenever\nthe first real big challenge would come\nthat little windstorm pushing\nback in the hole and i realized man i'm\nnot i'm fixing stuff\non a surface level i'm all surface man\ni'm not going deep into the cellar of my\nmind\nand fixing the foundation of my soul my\nsoul is broken\nand but you know i knew i could fix it\nbut i was afraid to go\nback i was afraid to face the demons of\nmy life\nyou know because you start lying you\nwant anybody knowing this [ __ ] about you\nso so you start lying about\nwho you're not and start creating a\nperson about who you want to be but it's\nnot who you are\nso that's when i started realizing man\ni'm never going to get over the hurdle\ni'm always live on a surface level until\ni go\ndeep deep into the sewer of my mind to\nfigure out and face\nall of these different demons that's\nhard\nit's hard we all like social media we\nall like everybody to see us\nfor who we want to be that's why we post\nbeautiful things about us\nthat's not that's not gonna fix you so i\nrealized that and that's when i started\ngoing back so i was about um\ni was about 24 years old and i went from\n175\nto almost 300 pounds and\nthat's when i sat down on my couch and\nrealized\nwe got to go back and it started with me\ngoing back to my father\nso we we left when i was eight years old\nwe went to a small town in brazil\nindiana\nthere's about five to ten black families\nin a town of eight thousand to ten\nthousand people\nand um there was a big hub of klansmen\nthat lived in center point indiana and i\ntalked about that in the book\nso the clan marched the 4th of july\nparade in 1995\nin indiana so when you come from a\nmessed up foundation like i did in\nbuffalo new york\nwhere my dad beat me senseless and now i\nhave that messed up foundation and now\ni'm here being the only black person i\ncall it the only\nin my book being the only black person\nmy mom's working three jobs\nwe're living in a seven dollar a month\nplace she's never at home\nso it's not like i had some mentors\ncoming in\nto help me you know they're trying to\nput me in these different group places\nfor like\nhaving some shrink talk to me and these\neight nine kids and\none kid sitting this house on fire\nanother kid's peening in the trash can\nanother kid had a helmet on banging his\nhead up against the wall\nand i'm looking at this at eight years\nold you know\nand i'm gonna get back to your question\nthat you asked me but\nthese are the things i had to go back\nand relive you know i'm 24 years old now\nand i have to go back to all these\nthings that no one knew about me in this\ngroup place where\ni'm in this place where these people are\ncrazy and they think i'm crazy\nand i'm looking at i'm thinking i'm not\ncrazy you just don't know where i come\nfrom\ni came from a place that truly damaged\nmy mind damaged my soul\nand now i have to go back on my own to\nface this [ __ ]\nso you know at 24 years old i sat there\na lot of time\nlike one day i woke up and said i gotta\nface this\nthis haunting [ __ ] voice in my head\nkept on saying man\nwe gotta go back the only way we can go\nforward\nis to go all the way back and that's\nvery scary to do for everybody\nthe only way you're gonna fix yourself\nis to go all the way back to the\nbeginning\nto your childhood because that's where\neverything starts and that's what's\nblocking most of us\nall of us yeah all of us everybody\nthinks it's my god like my marriage is\nmessed up this is messed up\nyou have to go back to fix all your\nproblems\nit all starts from the root man the root\nyeah it's the roots that's about to say\nwe have to go back to the root because\notherwise\nwe're just dealing with the symptoms\nthat's it yeah yeah and and and you\ncannot fix anything\nby giving it mulching you got you have a\njacked up knee\nthe swelling may go down but it's still\njacked up in there you got to get it\nfixed\nyou got to fix the knee all those pills\ndo\nso you know pretty much is just let the\nswelling go down\nand you can live a little longer but\nyou're not fixing the problem\nyou're not fixing the problem and i\nguess the most people don't go back or\nall of us like you said we don't go back\nbecause we don't know how\nright like right like right we don't\nknow how like how do you start how do\nyou go back and like use and i love that\nexample that\nwe start thinking the issue is our\nmarriage or our relationship right now\nor our\njob or a career and i i totally agree\nwith you that we need to go back but we\ndon't know how\nright now you start talking about in the\nbook some ways in which we can start\nhow right can you tell us about some of\nthat so one big thing is accountability\nmirror\nyou have to start with yourself so what\nhappened\nin my life was we start to get i call it\nlike the rucksack\na rucksack is a pack that you carry in\nthe military\nand you put all your stuff in it your\nradios your food your water\nall that stuff you have to carry the\nmilitary that's your rucksack it's the\nbackpack pretty much\nas you're growing up we all have a\nbackpack most of\nours hopefully is empty you know and\nwhat we put in it\nis all the crap we go through in life\nthat's what is in the backpack for the\ncivilians\nand we carry it around with us so what\nyou have to start doing is realizing\nthat no matter where you're at in life\ni got called [ __ ] a lot my dad abused\nme\nyou know learning disability stutters\nimmaturity insecurities\nself-doubt so much crap on top of me so\nmuch stuff i\nlied a lot to create friends so people\nso much stuff was in my backpack no\none's coming back to help me\nso it starts with that person in that\nmirror you have to realize you are\non your own now and whatever else you\nbelieve in i don't care what you believe\nin but\non earth it's a very lonely journey\nit starts with the accountability mirror\nof looking at saying hey\nmy dad would beat the hell he's not\ncoming back all these things are coming\nback\ni have to face myself and you have to\nown\nall those things that people may have\ndone to you now it's yours\nyou got to own it it's yours now to fix\nthe problems that people did to you\nit makes no sense it's not fair i get it\nbut if you live in that what was me\nmentality of guess what\nmy dad did this to me my mom just did to\nme people who bullied\ndid this to me you're gonna always live\nright there\nyou have to figure out ways to move\nforward because you're not coming back\nit starts with the mirror i call it the\naccountability mirror in the book yeah i\nknow i love that i love that i'm glad\ni'm glad you brought it up\nand anyone who's watching listening to\nthis right now\ni really want you to take this seriously\nbecause this is like\nwhat what you're talking about what\ndavid's talking about here is\nexactly why all of our suffering and\npain\nthat we're currently experiencing feel\nso tough and hard because\nunknowingly or knowingly we are choosing\nto be stuck here right\nright exactly unknowingly unknowingly\nwhatever situation you're in you're\nchoosing\nto stay stuck because we don't want to\ngo and unpeel and uncover\nthat's right you don't want to break\nopen that that callus\nthat that scar in your mind you want to\nbreak you know you have to break it open\nlet that blood flow\nyou let blood flow in your brain you\nhave to let all that stuff flow out\nall that toxic stuff that you have\ntrapped in there has to start flowing\nout now so\nlike you said you you are you are doing\nthis to yourself\nyes people may have helped you get there\nbut it's now on you that's a painful\ntruth though it's a painful truth\npainful truth like all those people in\nhigh school and everything else\nthey all know how you're going to end up\nso you got to make sure that you\nconstantly are rewriting your book\nyou have to constantly rewrite your book\nevery day of your life\nyou know and that these aren't just\nwords i say this is how i have to live\nlike\nthese are conversations i have with\nmyself and i say it everywhere i go\nthe most important conversation when you\nhave it yourself yes\nyou live with it every single day but\nmost of our conversations\nare not the right ones they're not the\nones that are going to push us to the\nplace we need to go\nthey're the ones that are going to keep\nus sitting in that toxic environment\nthat you've helped create\nand everybody else helped create and you\njust live in it you live in that muck\nand that conversation just plays in your\nhead and that becomes you\ndecode some of that conversation that\nyou started with yourself like how do\nhow does someone listening start that\nconversation with themself\nand and what are the general transitions\nthat you need to start seeing\nso my first conversation when i was\nabsolutely nobody\nand that's one thing you have to say we\nlive in a world now\nthat's so kind we we find the kind way\naround everything like if you don't look\ngood\ni have to find a kind way of saying i\ndon't like your shirt\nright that's not the approach if that's\nthe approach you're looking for\nthat book is not for you can't hurt me\nis not for you the approach you have to\ntake\nat least i took you take whatever\napproach you want the conversation had\nto be a real\nhonest conversation in the\naccountability mirror guess what\ni was fat don't find a kind word to say\nthat you know what\ni've gained some weight no you're fat\nwhen i couldn't read not like hey you\nknow even learn disability\nno i cannot read of a fourth grade\nreading level i'm struggling\nand sometimes i call myself stupid not\nin a way to put myself down\nso don't take it like my god those are\nso horrific yeah the hurtful\ndishonest the conversation has to become\nan\nhonest conversation of where you're at\nmentally where am i\nmentally i look like [ __ ] i feel like\n[ __ ]\ni'm not this i'm i'm falling behind in\nschool i'm lazy\nmy house is a mess you have to look at\nwhat it is and call\nit what it is don't find words to make\nyourself feel\nbetter because that's what so we hang\naround people\nthat make us feel better that tell us\nwhat we\nwant to hear not what we need to hear\nand so we stay away from those people\nand we stay away from those people\nlike our internal dialogue becomes that\nkind\nit's okay it's not okay so that's where\nit starts it starts with that\naccountability of\nit's not okay anymore this can no longer\nbe okay\nand calling yourself out for exactly\nwhat you are and exactly how you need to\nfix it\nthat's where it starts i love that i\nlove that i think that's awesome i i\nthink you're so\nright that so many of our conversations\nwith others are\npolitically correct exactly our\nconversations with ourselves\nare politically correct and then we\ncontinue to feed the illusion\nthat's right right we continue to feed\nit nothing gets solved by that man\nnothing and if you look at america right\nnow and i won't get off on this\nnothing is getting solved because we\nhave\nthere's so much racism there's so many\nthere's so many things and that's just\none of them\nwe can't talk about anything we are\nskirting\nall these conversations because if i say\nthis i don't offend a black person or a\nwhite person or a jewish person or\nor a gay or lesbian person we skirt\naround\nthe daggone problem so we can't fix\n[ __ ] everything is like well if i say\nthis on tv i'm gonna lose my damn job\nwe have to say it we have to break the\nbarriers within our minds\nwithin the world it starts with yourself\nit starts with yourself you gotta break\nthe barriers down within yourself in\nand just go there get a good of yourself\nabsolutely that was the honest\nconversation you had then what's an\nhonest conversation you've been having\nwith yourself this year\nlike what's because like you said and i\ncompletely agree with you it's a\nconstant cycle\nrepetition we have to keep doing it so i\ntalk about the repetition in my book a\nlot yeah gotta get the reps in\nso now my conversation is this i never\nset out to write a book when i was in\nthe dungeon and no one was coming back\nto help me\ni just wanted that reflection in that\naccountability mirror that i hated so\nbadly\nto be something that gave me pride to be\nsomething that made me feel it wasn't\nit's not about money it's not about\nsuccess it's not about people oh my god\nthat's david goggins\nsign my book no when i started this\njourney out years ago\nit's about i just want to learn to read\nso now i'm at a place now where i see\nthe possibilities\nof the human of human potential\nwhat are we capable of is the\nconversation now\nthe conversation now is how can i now\ntalk to people\nin a way they can understand the message\nthat i have for so many people for so\nmany people\nso that's the that's the new\nconversation now is that i you are\nconstantly evolving\nyou never stay either you're getting\nbetter you're getting worse not staying\nthe same\nso for me i have to constantly be\ngetting better i could constantly be\nevolving my message so\ni'm constantly thinking in the quietness\nof my mind that's that's the key point\ntoo\nthe world is so fast-paced the world is\nso noisy\nso my conversation now a lot of times is\nmy god\nslow down the world can take you\nhere here be here be there be everywhere\nand i lose myself sometimes so i catch\nmyself in the airport i catch myself in\nthe plane when i'm writing stuff down\nokay\nremember this remember that like hey\nhang on a second what got you\nhere this isn't what got you here\nslow the [ __ ] down\ngo back to the quiet place of that dirty\nmirror\nin that seven dollar a month place you\nused to live in\nthat's where you grew you so i so that's\nwhat i'm constantly reminding myself\ngo back to your roots now i'm not saying\ngo back to hell\nbut i'm saying don't forget where you\ncome from as you start to\nexplode out of the gate when you become\nsomeone\nmy conversation is do not forget\nyour roots do not forget your roots\ndon't let this become so big that you\nlose yourself amongst the noise\ngo back to the quietness of what made\nyou successful\nthat's the conversation now it's a\nconstant reminder of that i love that\nman that's the mantra do not forget your\nroots repeat that repeat that again and\nagain and\ni have a meditation that i develop for\nmyself to do that for me\nthat i want to share with everyone\nbecause it aligns so closely in\nin what you're sharing so every morning\ni sit and i look at my intentions\nto do anything so whether there's a new\ndeal on the table\nor there's a speaking gig that i've\ninvited to do or whatever it may be\nand in your life it can be anything\nwhether you're starting a new business\nyou're writing a book it may even just\nbe\nan instagram post for whatever it is and\ni look at whatever\nmy options are and i ask myself which\nones of these\nis a seed and which ones of these is a\nweed\nbecause the incredible thing in our\ngarden is that weeds end up looking like\nseeds and can confuse you 100 so\nso often that thing that's giving you\nego and pride and fame and control and\npower\nlooks like it's amazing right but\nactually it's just strangling you 100\nso so every day what i'll do is i'll\nlook at the garden of my life and i will\ntry and\nunweed my garden so i'll look at\neveryone be like why am i doing that and\nask me that why am i doing that if the\nanswer is not\nlove compassion empathy growth right\npersonal push sacrifice service if the\nanswer is the opposite greed\nmoney power fame if those are my reasons\nthen i have to take that weed out\ni have to pull it out because if i don't\npull it out that weed's gonna keep\ngrowing\nright and one day it's gonna be so big\nright that i wouldn't have never seen it\nexactly and so i'm with you man and\nthat's why i walked in here\nthe first thing i do is i is i want to\nknow the person\nbecause there's so many people right now\ndoing exactly what we're doing\nwhat turns me off so badly i see so many\npeople out there trying to\nmotivate people inspire people help\npeople\nfind what's going to drive you i see all\nthis [ __ ]\nit's all [ __ ] a bunch of [ __ ] and i\nwalk in i see it everywhere everybody's\ngot\nthis going everybody's got a new podcast\nthis about i'm going to help you\nfind yourself they're not living it\nthey're not living it which is why i\nlook at people i'm like\nwhat are you about are you are are you\nactually\ndoing what you say you're doing which is\nwhy when i heard some of your story\ni realized that you have substance to\nwhat you're saying\nwhich is why now i can speak to you a\nlot of times i go on these podcasts i\nain't gonna [ __ ] be there\nyou know because i start realizing this\nperson is just talking he's not living\nand we share this with people and we\nexpect them to change\nthey can see right through you they can\nsee you're not doing this\nthat's what think about it don't do\neverything in your life for money\ndon't do everything yes we need it to\nsurvive\nthere's a great drive and passion behind\ndoing things\nfor the mind and the soul there's a\ngreat drive in that everyone's married\nyou you talk with such passion\nthis is a life this is my life\nso that's so that's what i want people\nto get from all this stuff man like\nthere's something inside you the the\nbrain is the most powerful thing the\nmind's most powerful thing that we have\nit's not your phone it's not the\ncomputer it's not anything it's your\nmind\nand if you can tap into that you can\ncome from the from the\ndaggone roots of hell and become such a\ngreat\nseed a powerful seat that can grow into\nsome great daggone garden\nand people don't get that it's all up\nhere the power and the magic is up here\nyeah no i really appreciate that man and\nthank you for saying that because\nfor me too that was you know my desire\nwhat i was sharing with you earlier is\nchanging people's relationship with\nperception right and when i started i\nwould become louise when i started\nmaking videos\nor any of this and i've been talking\nabout these things and studying them for\nthe past 13 years\nand when i started making videos which\nwas only two years ago i had no idea\nthat anyone would care\nright i made it because i wanted to\nshare what i'd learned\nright and i put it up and i genuinely\nthought my life was gonna be i was gonna\ngo to my nine-to-five job my\nnine-to-nine job i used to work 12 hours\na day\nin the corporate world i thought that's\nwhat i'm going to do i'm going to make\nvideos on the weekends\nright and hopefully they'll help someone\nexactly like there was never a desire to\nfor this to be anything more than a\nservice\nright and so when you when i hear you\nsay that and also just about how much we\nperceive each other and i mean how we\nperceive other people etc\nright it's it's so important for all of\nus to give each other the benefit of the\ndoubt that's right\nand hear from each other right to\nconnect exactly to see like i said that\nto you earlier i already knew i was\ngonna like you\nright i was hoping you're gonna like i\ndidn't know that about you so you know i\nuh i make sure i and that's something\nthat\nthat's very powerful a lot of times we\nhear about someone else\nthrough the grapevine and they don't and\nthen i won't like you because i heard\nfrom somebody\nelse that they don't like you always do\nyour own judging\nalways meet the person look at the\nperson in the eyes before you say you\ndon't like that person\nlisten to their story listen to who they\nare listen to where they come from\nhow they lived get your own opinion\nabout people\nit's very huge a lot of people didn't\nlike me coming up because they they\nthey see this hardness this crust break\naway at the crust and see what's inside\nthat person\nabsolutely man don't judge a tweet no\njudge one post\nno don't judge one message and don't\njudge somebody from 30 freaking years\nago\nor i say 30 [ __ ] years ago you know\nthere's so much stuff going on right now\nin the world people\nare trying to evolve let them evolve\nyes let them evolve don't bring them\nback into the\ndon't bring them back where they came\nfrom yes don't don't bring\nif someone wants to get better don't\nbring them back to where you knew them\nwhen they were\na piece of [ __ ] let them fly and if you\nfeel like hell because they went away\nand they escaped the hell that you all\nonce lived in\nfix yourself fix yourself\ndon't hold them accountable because they\ngot away don't don't constantly remind\nthem\nthat they were once here fix yourself\nbecause a lot of people feel like crap\nonce people start to leave their little\nnest like like if you're an alcoholic\nand this guy says i'm gonna stop\ndrinking you wanna bring him right back\nin\nlook at yourself in the mirror and say\nwow this guy's doing better\ntake that feeling of feeling like [ __ ]\nand do something about it\nchange your own life absolutely well\nsaid man well said do you think we\ndo you think we do that subconsciously\nwe don't want to see other people grow\nand fly because we're not growing in\nflight as a hundred percent\nit makes us feel like [ __ ] it's a\nconstant reminder of\nwhere where we're at in life if you want\neven more videos just like this one
