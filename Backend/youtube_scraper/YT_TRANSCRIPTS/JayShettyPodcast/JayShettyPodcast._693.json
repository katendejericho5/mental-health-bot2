the other day\nwe're talking about uh albert einstein\nhave the ability to take something\nthat's\nvery complex and there's a lot of sides\nand edges to it and make it to where\nit's digestible and understandable by\num you know by the majority of people\nand i think that's a that's a\npowerful asset that you have um and uh\none that i\nyou know that i try to remember as well\nto try to make things a little bit\neasier for people to understand and\ntherefore you know get you know get\nthrough with the points you're trying to\nmake you do it well\nvery well thank you so much that means\nso much to me coming from you and we're\nso\nhappy and grateful to be in this\nincredible ranch this week\nuh your space here in montana we have\nthis incredible view and\neven more amazing is the people that\nyou've gathered and your team has\ngathered for this\nsuch an important conversation and cause\nyeah could you tell us about\nwhere this idea for this week came for\nyou and what the purpose was from your\nperspective well i think it\nwas it was we were born out of a lot of\nyears of my\nmy journey in terms of wellness and\nwell-being and\nand i was a very competitive runner for\nmany years of my life and\nand that you know that was great but you\nknow he transitioned out of that and i\ndo a variety of other things to keep\nmyself physically and mentally\nin shape now but um you know we're\nliving\nin very troubled times and um uh and i'm\ntalking about really on a global basis\nnationally as well as globally and\ndespite um\nour gdp which you know we discussed the\nother day\nis not being the real measure of\nhappiness in a country\num despite the growth of that we've got\na lot of a lot of issues that young\npeople\nand older people are all struggling with\nthe fact that you met laurie santos from\nyour university in the corner quarter of\nthe student body of yale\nthree or eight to 18 years old has has\nnow taken was taking this course every\nyear and had a\nhad to deal with you know positive\ngrowth how to deal with the stress in\nyour life etc\nuh at harvard they have over a thousand\nstudents every semester to do a similar\nso the the the reality is it's not only\nwith\nfolks my age that are you know wiser\nsuicide rate double\nsince in 1996 or 30 i should say\num but the young people today thank\nheavens\nare questioning themselves you know what\nis my purpose\nuh what's my purpose myself what's my\npurpose in serving humanity\nwhat's my purpose and what i'm doing how\ndo i connect all these\ndots in my life journey together and so\ni\ni think the the idea was to bring\ntogether uh\nyou know the best the brightest and the\nsmartest we have them all\nstarting with you and many others that\nhave\nincredible backgrounds and histories\nand bring such knowledge and wisdom to\nthe room\nand the idea was to bring together for\nus as a funder and other funders as well\nare there ways that we can help move the\nball down the field to use you know\neither of my football teams american\nfootball soccer as an\nanalogy but is there ways that we can\nput our shuttle to the wheel\nand do more than what is currently being\ndone is there ways we can assist\num and we do that within our own\nbusinesses and we can talk about that\nlater if you'd like but um\nbut beyond that you know what's the\nscale what's the impact we've talked\nabout that\nlord knows that if we make a difference\nin one person's life\nthat's a huge journey by itself but\nreality is that these issues are of such\nscale not only nationally but\ninternationally\nas we've heard from uh dan buettner blue\nzones and uh\nyou know and um ben lido\nfrom harvard i mean these issues are\nbeing questioned you know throughout the\nworld so they're\nthey're um they're big-time concerns\nthat we have to face\nyeah absolutely and when i first\nreceived the invite\nand saw what the conversation was i was\njust so happy and in awe that this was\ntaking place\ni just thought wow there's someone out\nthere who is so deeply invested and\nseems so\ngenuinely caring about what the\nchallenges of the world are\nand then when i looked at the list of\npeople coming i was just like wow this\ncan be so exciting for me\nbecause i'll have my notebook out right\nand i've learned so much this week\nso thank you again and i want to help my\naudience\nunderstand your backstory because i\nthink\nthat's what really shows where people's\npurpose comes from right it's very easy\nto look at you we're sitting in this\nbeautiful\nwest creek grants today it's you know\nthis beautiful property here but you\nactually grew up in a one-bedroom\napartment i did queens right\nright and you didn't move out until you\nwent to college and didn't live in a\nhome till age 32.\nright that's correct yeah and so tell us\nabout how formative that experience was\nand how what you learned from well i\nthink\ni think it was very important uh in my\nown life\num my father was a pharmacist but i i\nlost him when i was uh 15 he was 44 at\nthe time very young age\nmy mother was 37 she took over my dad's\nbusiness and\nran it but you know we always uh we\nalways we didn't have very much i mean\nas i said it was a one-bedroom apartment\nshared by all four of us we had a single\nbathroom i mean we're living in a very\nvery\nmodest way and um but the one thing i\nremember clearly about my mother is that\nshe was never about money it was always\nabout making a difference and trying to\nuh\ngive back and trying to be involved in\nthe community etc i mean i wear this\nbracelet that she that that i had made\nfrom our book it\ndidn't subscribe you can't see it on\nhere but i wear one every day it matches\nthe color of what i'm wearing i try to\nwatch but it says\nyou you uh you only pass through once\nmake a difference\nso and that was the title of the book\nthat she wrote so i think that that\nbecame ingrained in me\nthe notion of trying to make a\ndifference giving back being connected\nto others in the community\nand what have you and we we're not in a\nposition to write checks then but\nyou know writing checks is great but\ndoing the work itself and getting\nconnected\nto the individuals that that you're\ntrying to serve um\nis is really the most rewarding part of\nphilanthropy in my in my view it makes\nit all come to life makes it all real\ngives it more purpose than just sitting\nand writing checks checks are important\nresources are important to make things\nhappen and bring scale\nbut i think it's uh it's important to\nhave that background that i would say\npart of it\nand my faith uh i'm jewish and uh\nyou know one of the expressions in uh\njudaism is uh to conan alum\nwhich means to repair the world uh or\nsadaka i mean\ngiving and and participating uh so\nthose who are ingrained in me even\nthough when i went to the services\num you know you don't think you absorb\nall that you know you obviously did\nbecame a monk at 18 but but you know a\nlot of\num the the you know congregational\nmeetings i went to et cetera i wasn't\nsure exactly what but i was absorbing\nmore so than i even really thought so i\nthink those things are very important in\nterms of my childhood\nyeah that's incredible and like\nregardless of how little you had\nyour mom was your mother was always\ntrying to find time and energy to get\nright to the community right\nin different ways i think that was a\nreally powerful message you know i think\nwhen i bought my first home it was you\nknow\n32 thousand dollars i was 30 32 years\nold\ni remember telling my wife then i said\nlook i'm not gonna embarrass\nuh i'll pay off the mortgage i mean i'll\nkeep us current don't worry about that\ni'll pay the bills\nbut we're never gonna pay this mortgage\noff completely i just you know there's\nno way you know so\nobviously that part of my life has\nchanged but remembering that and\nremembering that experience and what it\nmeant to\nnot have the kind of financial success\nthat we have today\nuh going back to those days i think was\nvery important part of my own molding if\nyou will\nabsolutely i think perspective's so\nimportant i remember\nwhen i was nine years old i visited\nindia for the first time\nand my father took me to the home that\nhe grew up in and he grew up in an area\nwhere they shared a bathroom with\n30 other families his home was as big as\nthis room\nand that had seven people living in this\nmuch space\nand when i went outside there were like\nbats and cockroaches and all this kind\nof stuff and i was just like\ni couldn't believe that that's where my\ndad grew up yeah\nand compared to you know we didn't grow\nup in a huge house in england right but\ncompared to his home right yeah my home\nwas\nhuge yeah and so for me it was so\nimportant i feel like nine years old to\nsee that\nright because it start made it started\nmaking me feel grateful for what i did\nhave rather than\nbeing ungrateful for what i did yeah and\ni think you know just as your your\njourney\nbrought you at some point at age 18 i\nthink it was when you decided to\num you know go on the journey of\nbecoming a monk\nyou know you're affected by your\nbackground your history\nuh all the connecting points in your\nlife and sometimes they don't\nall seem to add up right at the moment\nbut there's a big puzzle going on in\nyour head\nand in your heart and your spirit that\nactually brings those things together\nand it's you know that moment of saying\naha\nthis is my purpose this is really what i\nwant to do i feel\nat peace with this i want to you know i\nwant to go as far as i can down this\nroad\ntake others with me travel with others\netc so i think it's been beautiful from\nmy standpoint yeah and tell us how\nthen five years later at 37 you go from\nfeeling\ntired of working at a regional hardware\nstore\nyeah then going on to build well the\nbiggest\nwhat is that processor thinking about it\nmaking it happen pushing forward looked\nlike well it was it wasn't\nwe weren't tired of of doing it it was\nthe company was called handy-dan home\nimprovement centers which was then the\nmost\nsuccessful home improvement center\ncompany chain in the united states but\nit was\nwas owned by a larger company that was\nin financial difficulty\nso when bernie and i my partner who\nco-founded home depot\num we uh we got fired actually so it\nwasn't like well let's you know it was\na lot of political reasons and that's a\nwhole other story but\nuh beyond that it was our chance really\nto live our lives over again\nuh from a business standpoint and\nalthough those stores were the best run\nin the united states we felt if we ever\nhad to compete with a\nlarge no-frills down market warehouse\nstore we really couldn't\ncouldn't do it so we said if we couldn't\ndo that we were owning the best company\nin that\nsector that time let's try to develop\nthat and go with that and that was the\nbirth of home depot and\nstarted in 78 first stores were in 79 uh\nit's a long story when i left 23 years\nlater it was the second lightest retail\nin the world\nsecond only to walmart which is a great\ncompany and\nthey have one of their senior executives\nhere this week as well and trying to\nunderstand\nwell-being and wellness and how that\nrelates to the the um\nassociates that they have and uh i don't\neven know what their number is today\nit's probably about a million and a half\nmaybe more than that it's\nmind-boggling that's insane yeah what\nwhat gave you what i'm really interested\nin\narthur is that what gave you the courage\nand risk-taking after being fired at the\nage of 37 to do that because i think\ntoday\nand it's interesting because i was\nsitting yesterday at a table\nwith laurie with robert and we were\ndiscussing this and what they were\nsharing with me\nis that so many students today at some\nof the best institutions in the world\nright\nand all institutions in the world right\nare so scared\nof doing anything that isn't the path\nand what i mean by the path is\nthey believe that they go to yale or\nharvard right they continue and they\nhave to get a job in what they're\nstudying right now\nand that they have to live that very\nnarrow line\nand they said in their words they said\nthey know some of their students are\ndoing things they hate\njust because it's the path yeah where\ndid you feel the confidence\nand the risk-taking approach to try\nsomething new and how can our audience\nand listeners today\nfeel that they're not old because today\npeople think they're old at 25.\nwe think we're older than 28 do you i\ngot married at 23\nthe first time and i uh said oh god this\nis 20 years old i need to get married\ntoday the kids are getting my heart much\nlater but in any event uh\ni think in my own case uh probably came\nfrom the experience that my\nuh that my father passing away at an\nearly age in being an entrepreneur he\nwas\nhe was um working as a pharmacist he\nleft several years before\nhe passed away started his own uh\nwholesale drug company across america\nstores hospitals nursing homes etc and\nthen when he passed away my mother took\nthat business over so i had all these\nrole models\nin my family of you know not giving up\nof trying\ntrying something new extending yourself\nyou know going on that\non that journey i've been connected with\noutward bound for\nprobably 40 years now and their slogan\nis to serve to strive and not to yield\nand so i very much believe in that and\nuh the notion\nthat we all can do more than what we\nthought we're capable of doing\nuh and doesn't mean you do it without\nyou know uh you know\nsafety nets around you but uh but you\ncan do more than what you thought so i\nwould encourage and i do encourage\npeople to\nas dr dwyer would say uh to find the\nmusic within you\nand make sure it gets played uh so i\nthink\nyou know a lot of us have to find that\nyou know that music if you will that\npassion\nthat that point of physical mental\nspiritual connection that makes us feel\nwe're you know we're not getting up to\nwork today we're getting up to\nto uh have not have fun but to do god's\nwork do our work uh to work with purpose\nuh service to others etc so i think um\nyou know you try to find and i encourage\nyoung people today to try to find\num don't worry about making money if\nyou're good at what you're doing you're\ngoing to be fine\nand money really is really not the main\nattribute to happiness\nas you well know but i think doing what\nwhat you\nfind a passion for serving others in\nsome capacity\nand being part of the greater community\nnot just of your family which is\nobviously critical but of humanity\nuh you know brings you the joy and peace\nand i think if you can find a business\nthat in one form another provides that\nservice i think you\nyou uh you create a company expression i\nuse to our managers that you want our\nassociates to feel this company is\nreally worthy of your life\num i don't mean that in disrespect to\nreligion or whatever else it may be but\nthey're giving you 8 10 12 hours a day\nwhatever it may be but you want them to\ncome to work\nand not ever think of it as work think\nof it as you know this is part of my\nmission\ni love the values of this organization\ni believe in them i want to stand for\nthem i want to participate in them i\nwant to help\narticulate them i want to help share\nthem with others as they join our\nbusinesses\nand i think that that passion i think\nand that commitment\nis what will bring bring a greater sense\nof joy\nand hopefully you know i'm i'm thrilled\nreally with uh you know bob walden here\nand lori santos here as best examples\nand\nmany other universities but there's\ntremendous thirst\nthat our young people have who at the\nend of the day really are our future\num the young people have to find a\ngreater purpose\nfind themselves personally and then find\na greater connection to\nothers in their community and humanity\nis uh is something that i applaud\nand that's why your work is so important\nbecause you know you're part of\nyou know the voices that young people\neverybody's listening to\ni'm 76 so i'm not young but but i mean\nbut everybody is listening to\ntoday and trying to get uh some\num better guidance broader guidance\nuh more spiritual guidance uh connecting\nguidance to\neverything inside of themselves than\nthey would have had otherwise so\nyou know i'm very optimistic about you\nknow the direction\nthat we're going in but it's not going\nto happen by itself it's not going to\nchange by itself\nwe need people like yourself jay and all\nthe people in the other\nother rooms that are doing incredible\nwork\nand uh making sure that those messages\nget expanded and we're touching more and\nmore people\nand uh find ways to bring uh bring that\nmessage of scale\nand i think it's one that that people\num you know when somebody has that\nfeeling\nthat i'm not really i mean this is\nthis is a purpose to me uh and\nthe in the true sense the word what i'm\ndoing every day has purpose\nit's like these you know young men you\nhave here you know we're recording this\ni mean i assume i mean they love working\nwith you but they probably love you know\nhearing some of these stories and every\nday they\nexposed to you know some other thoughts\nthat help them enrich their\nown mind and their own own thoughts yeah\nabsolutely and when i hear you speak\nfrom\nfor the first day when you led the\nintroduction to even now\nthe words like purpose and values and\nspirit they're so\ndeeply embedded in who you are\nand and one of the things i loved and\nwe'll try and get a slide to put it onto\nthe video version but\nwhen you first started speaking you\nshowed us the two value diagrams that\nyou have\nand one thing i loved is that there was\nan upside down pyramid right\nand on the upside down pyramid the\nperson at the bottom of the pyramid was\narthur it was me\nand i loved that beca and at the top was\ncustomers right\nand then you had the other circular one\nwith innovation and all these other\naspects of values\ni'd love for you to talk through some of\nthose sure because i believe that\nwe hear a lot of people say this stuff\nright i know\nand and you've probably heard it more\nthan i have but\nfrom spending a bit of time with you and\nand seeing the success of what you've\ndone\nit seems like you've actually been able\nto to really do it right\nyeah please share with us some of those\nvalues and how you constructed them\nspecifically\nand and where that upside down pyramid\nand you at the bottom idea came from\nyeah so i i think jay all of our\nbusinesses\num regardless of their\nexactly what they're doing you described\nthem more well earlier all that\nincredibly high\nvery high success portfolio\nand results um they're all based on the\nsame set of values and the same set of\nvalues as the wheel of six if you will\nbut they all have to do with\nrelationships all i have to do with\ncommunity all to do with respect\nalso do with giving back uh none of\nthose\nkey values have anything to do with you\nknow what's our maximum revenue what's\nour rate of profitability what's our\nreturn on sales etc\nit's it's all has to do with behavior\nand how we treat\nthe people that we're serving so whether\nwe're serving guests here at mountain\nsky or west creek or whether we're\nserving customers in our pga business or\nwhether we're\nserving fans in our atlanta falcons\natlanta united in our\nstadium which has been voted number one\nstate in the country last two years\na little plug but um\nyou know everything we do is all about\nservice to others so you know\nwe know if we do the right things for\nthe right reasons uh in terms of the\nthe tactical decisions uh but if we have\nthis\nwelcoming home this welcoming feeling\nwhere we're\nmore concerned about who was serving\nthan about ourselves\nthat comes across with a sense of trust\nand and caring so\nan example would be uh just to\ndemonstrate that\nin the national football league 32 teams\num\nthe last two years the atlanta falcons\nwere voted number one in the nfl for fan\nexperience\nuh major league soccer or 24 teams were\nranked number one in major league soccer\nin terms of fan experience but\nand it may have a lot of has to do a lot\nof different things in the food and\nbeverage and our unique\nthe strategy in that regard but in the\nsetting in the stadium but beyond that\nit has to do with the fact that every\nsingle person\nin any of these venues that we're\ntalking about\nfeels like they're an honored guest\nfeels like they are\nthe reason we're there is to serve them\nand i would say to you\ni mean our associates are compensated\nwell\nbut having said that their greatest\ncompensation\nin my view is that you know they're\nseeing people smile every day they're\nmaking people's dreams come true they're\nmaking\npeople's uh problems go away the sense\nof community\nall of these things that we share and\ntalk about i mean they they love all\nthat so\nour associates feel like you know i may\nhave a tough day at home or a tough day\nsome\nit may be when they come into work\nthough and they're and they're confusing\nwork with play\nand they're making uh the opportunity to\nserve\nright there is is very powerful in terms\nof enriching their own experience\nuh so you know that that's a key driver\nin\neverything that we do we also feel\nstrongly in community and giving back\nand\nand uh you know we do that with the\nservice and the businesses themselves\nuh but we do it in a broader sense in\nterms of our own philanthropy our family\nfoundations\nyou know 400 million dollars since 1995\nand that'll probably you know double and\ntriple in the next\nnext 10 years and then each of our\nbusinesses have has an associate\nled fund to themselves which is very\nvery significant in dollars but the\nbeauty of that is that\nthese are not trained uh philanthropists\nthey're just associates they're not\nexecutives necessarily\nthey're trained you know you know to how\nto go through evaluations etc they make\nthe decisions\nthey're closest to the people they're\nserving they understand the communities\nthey're living in\nthey understand their industries and\nincredibly well and so they make\ndecisions about you know\nhow much we're going to allocate in\ncertain areas and they they do do that\nwork\nand we support them we don't guide them\nwe just you know we give them x amount\nof dollars and they take care of it\num the beauty of that is that the\nassociates feel the tremendous sense of\npride then\nnot just in their work quote unquote\nwhich is having purpose in terms of\nserving others\nbut also their part they're physically\npart of going out and doing site visits\nin a variety of settings and making\ndecisions about you know well you know\nwe've been blessed here and\nhow do we help others you know how do we\num\nhow do we do this work and expand it so\num\nto have that pride that gives the\nassociates even more purpose\nand more sense of that you know what\ni've publicly said from my standpoint\nlook whatever's left over\n98 of my state is going to be going back\nthrough\nphilanthropy family foundation my kids\nfoundations these associate-led\nfoundations\num because i you know i've i don't need\nany more clothing i don't need any more\nof anything\ni need more you know growth myself but\num but i want to see you know i want to\nsee the world a better place than it is\ncurrently today and be part of that and\nour associates feel that way\nso the upside down pyramid if you will\nwith um yes customers fans on top and\nme on the bottom it reinforces the\nmessage that\num the people that are most important\nare the people that we're serving\ni mean it's not you know it's not a\nbunch of words exactly and\nwe embody that we tell stories around\nthat etc\nand then we have our frontline\nassociates who are the next ones that\nare touching and feeling all of our\num all of our guests or our fans\ncustomers and then\nyou know it's my job and other\nassociates the leadership level\nto provide the environment to make sure\nthey have the resources to make sure\nthey have the strategy to make sure that\nwe\nwe create goals for them that are\nreasonable etc and give them support\nso um and your your question which is\nprobably the best question uh that as a\nbusiness person you ask\nis that you know often an entrepreneur\nhas a vision um\nand it's successful but once they try to\nexpand it it\nbecomes not successful so you know at\nhome depot we um\nwe struggled with that as well and we\nhad four stores i remember meeting with\nthe\ngentleman from goldman sachs who was the\nmost highly regarded uh\nbanker on wall street in the retail\nspace and uh\num and he uh he sat down with me at\nlunch and said well you have these four\nstores you know in atlanta they're very\nsuccessful and you have uni culture but\nyou know\nyou didn't ask me a question i was only\n37 so i was like ooh meeting with guys a\nreally big deal\nso i you know he said as you expand\nyou're not gonna be able to\nmaintain this culture you're just not\ngonna be able to do it he said because\nyou guys are so physically involved the\nlevel of training the level of\ncommitment the level of their\nsocial understanding your viewpoints and\nall this\num so i it was troubling coming from\nhere and because we had aspirations to\nbecome a national company which\nobviously with\n2 200 stores now and stores in mexico\ncanada and u.s it's\nyou know um it's you know amazing story\nbut\nthe key to that was not what's on a\npiece of paper\nnot the six core values that we live it\nwas not really the inverted triangle but\nit's the ability\nto make sure that what we would term in\ncase of home depot was the orange apron\nso it was orange\na lot of orange in our business that our\nassociates you know\nbled orange uh if you will and what that\nmeans is that\nthey understood the values we didn't\nmake them write them down we didn't make\nthem they weren't they're not the same\nexactly in this order but\ndid they live them uh could they\narticulate them in whatever words they\nwanted to but most importantly could\nthey live them\nand um and so we became very paranoid\nabout uh succession planning making sure\nthat\nwhen people got promoted that is not the\nfirst question was not\nare they technically really good at what\nthey're doing whether it be in a store\nor a store support center\neven our headquarters if you will we\nalways call them store support centers\nbecause they were there\nto support the stores that were\nsupporting our customers\nbut uh the the key was you know do they\nunderstand it and so understand our\nvalue set and they live it if they live\nit they had a chance to move ahead\nbecome a store manager become a district\nmanager whatever it may be\nif they didn't it didn't mean they were\na bad person but we put them in\nanother another area where their ability\nto affect\nyou know large numbers of people was not\ngoing to be as great so that ability to\nunderstand\nand live our values and become a role\nmodel\nand lead by examples one of our core\nvalues lead by example so\nyou saw last night that i served pi so i\nmean i'm you know this is\nmaybe off the subject a little bit but i\nmean the example is it's important\nit's not just important i do it at\nmountain sky as well our guest ranch\nopens to the public\nbecause you know i want the guests to\nreally see me in a\nposition of service to others i want our\nassociates to see that it's not just a\nbunch of words actually leading by\nexample is nothing that i\nwouldn't do to help uh last year at\nmountain sky i was sitting in the\nin the bar area and having a drink and i\nheard somebody say well you know our\nbathroom is not working and you know\nit's over there\nyes so i went and i fixed it myself and\nit was another one it wasn't working i\nfixed it myself\nso you know i came back i i just you\nknow that's kind of my nature you know\nit's not working go fix it\nit's not a matter of title of who i am i\ndidn't ask anybody else to do it i did\nit myself so\nthe associates the next day i had a\ncouple say to me we heard that you\nactually were fixing toilets yesterday i\nsaid well yeah i mean it wasn't you know\ni mean\nit's part of what we do is that we we\nhave to lead by example and those\nstorytelling\nthose examples uh and picking the right\npeople behind\nthat that understand those things and\nlive those things\num are are the way you expand a an\norganization\nuh over a broader scale if you have\nreally bright people\nthey don't get what you're doing they\ndon't get your purpose and your vision\nthen\nit's not going to work doesn't mean\nthey're not bright doesn't mean they're\nnot good doesn't mean\nthey don't have a different purpose in\nlife but they're not going to be able to\nsupport your organization\nyeah so um you know much of what you're\ndoing and expanding it so\nincredibly in the last three years um\nyou know you have to have the right\npeople around you people who want to\nstand j\nshetty people understand your value set\ni mean they can have their own but it\nhas to be\nin a certain sense has to have sense of\nservice and sense of purpose\nuh deeply ingrained as well absolutely\nabsolutely and thank you so much that\nwas a beautiful answer by the way and\namazing to hear that you were fixing\ntoilets and definitely saw you said pie\nyesterday yeah yeah but no i i think\nit's i think it's amazing and i've\ndefinitely felt that with you personally\nthis week just how personal you are with\neveryone and\nhow much you make sure and check in with\neveryone and making sure we're all okay\nwhich is\nwhich has really been beautiful and very\nvery amazing to see that as well\nand and that answer was amazing because\nfor me\nthat is what defines leadership when i\nmeet someone i'm most endeared\nby their humility and by their character\nmore than\nhow much money they've made or how\nsuccessful they are and i think that's\nall of us\nwe we remember people based on how they\nmake us feel\nright as opposed to what they have or\nwhat they say right and i think the fact\nthat you've been able to do that in an\norganization tell me about a time after\nwhere\nactually you may have made a mistake or\na failure in the organization and i'm\nsure there were many but any of that\nstand out to you where\nyou really learned an important lesson\nyeah that stayed with you that\nmade you change something i hope there\nweren't too many but but there were some\ni'll give you an example and this was\none\nat home depot as an example we the only\nacquisition we made when um\nwhen i was there and bernie was there\nwas a group of uh\nnine uh stores that were in our industry\nuh they had stores in dallas and\nelsewhere in louisiana and\nmobile and baton rouge etc and as we\nacquired the stores\nand then what our decision was that we\ndidn't want to lose the volume\nthat they had it was a fraction of the\nvolume that we had but we didn't want to\nlose it i'm very paranoid about losing\nvolume focused always on revenue and um\nso we decided to keep them open and\nchange the stores so it really was kind\nof like changing\ntires on a car that's going you know\neven 30 miles an hour\nit gets very ugly very difficult to do\net cetera et cetera so when we opened\nthe stores we realized we had\num physically we had changed the stores\nthey looked like traditional home depot\nstores great stores\nbut the the associates didn't really get\nus because we hadn't really\nput them through the kind of training\nand exposure and understanding\nuh that was critical to all of our\nassociates so there's a\nseparation there from you know our value\nset which drives everything\nto the people that were serving the\ncustomers who you know were well\nintended but they didn't understand\nour priorities he understood the\ntraditional priorities which was not\nas rigorous about customer service as\nours was\nso uh we end up closing those stores uh\nfor a short while\nand you know putting everything on pause\ntaking all the associates training them\ndoing everything we had to do etcetera\netcetera when they reopened they\nreopened as as\nour home depot store so i wow i think\nthat was an example of where\nwe got a little ahead of ourselves and\nprobably um\nyou know forgot to check certain boxes\nthat we needed to check\nanother example and uh both in our pga\nbusiness today is a good example\nwe're we're expanding at about a million\nsquare feet in golf retail in the next\nnext five years which is there's nobody\nin golf retail expanding anywhere and\npeople you talk to saying but\nit's been extraordinarily successful but\nthe point is that\nthose stores require a high level of\nservice and\npeople understanding the industry club\nfitting ball fitting\nyou know etc etc and and relationships\nto customers etc so\nuh to our guests in the store so you\nknow we take a lot of time now in moving\na large group of people to the new store\nto make sure that we don't make that\nmistake again so\nthose number of people can train the\nadditional 40 50\n60 people that we're hiring and making\nsure that they get our culture\nuh so you know culture really drives\neverything that we do\ni mean everything we do those value sets\nthey dry every everything that we do\nand you know the body can only absorb\nchange at a certain rate\num and um pace at a certain rate so i\nthink it's\nit's important to be able to acknowledge\nthat and make sure that\nyou know whatever your culture is it\ndoesn't get diluted as you expand\nmore often than not it does happen um\ni've had some experiences and\nyou know one other example of that when\nwe went\nat home depot we started to expand into\nthe middle west\num we went to detroit with a group of\nstores and\nwe realized then we were opening up\nstores we had a store and a half\nstore every day and a half and that uh\nwe couldn't really\nsustain that rate of of growth so we\nwe went to the board bernie and i who\nsaid look at we decided we're going to\nmaintain a growth rate of no more than\n25 percent a year\nhad nothing to do with financial\nmodeling and everything it had to do\nwith\nhow many associates could we impact you\nknow higher impact train making sure\nthey understood\nour orientation became home depot\nfanatics\nblood orange you know all those things\nwe asked them to do\nwe said that's the most that we can\npossibly do so we we kept our growth\ndown to a point that we can um that we\ncan still produce the kind of success\num and deliver the kind of experiences\nin all of our businesses\nyeah but same thing happens out here at\nthe ranch is that we've made some\nadjustments over the years\nwe do it very slowly very modestly\nbecause we don't want the experience to\nchange and we want to make sure that\neverybody's ready for the change\nabsolutely absolutely and that's amazing\nadvice for all of us\nanyone who's listening or watching right\nnow and is growing a small team into a\nlarger one an entrepreneur that's\nexpanding their business\nculture is that thing that's gonna make\nsure that you succeed in the long run\nand it's so easy to hire fast and hire\nquickly and i know alex and i and\nand with the businesses that i work with\nright now we're actually some of the\nslowest hiring people in the world\nwell and it's it's it's you know it's\nit's terribly important i mean i\ni had a ceo of a major competitor of\nours um\nmeet with me once i was i'm actually\nplaying golf over to guster as a guest\nand he was there\nand he said to me well you know if you\nhear around lunchtime i'm out on the\nputting green and you know come over say\nhi and i\ni knew him so i did so and he had left\nhe had left the company at that point\nand he said you know\nwe sent we probably visited 200 euro\nstores a year and that\nat that point in time we had stores in\nchile as well he said\nand we could copy everything we copy the\nsize the pricing the assortment the\nsigning\ni mean everything he said he said we'd\ngo around and ask people you know\nthis culture thing value thing and no\nmatter where we went\nno matter who we spoke to they all said\nthe same thing\nin their own words but they all were\ndoing the same thing and we were not\nable to do that in our company\nand um but that's because you know we\nrecognized\nthe importance in that it was not a new\nmessage every single day it was the same\nmessages over and over and over and over\nagain to the point people said oh boy\nhere we go again listen to customer\nservice\nand every example that we could find of\ngreat customer service we celebrated\nthat um\ni mean we had issues with you know that\nwe had to struggle with as well as a\ncompany but we celebrated\nuh the successes and particularly it\nweren't successes and how many stores\nyou opened up\nthe fact that our earnings per share\nagree with 49 a year for 23 years or\nstock were that quickly\nwe didn't talk about the stock market\nand how wealthy we were making people\nthough we had a lot of pride in that\nbecause then we gave other people the\nfinancial capacity to make a difference\nin their own lives and have\na financial purpose in their lives and\ntaking care of their family extended\nfamily community giving back\nbut uh so it was it's a you know it was\na it's a beautiful model\nbecause it's um it's one where\nassociates and who you're serving um all\nappreciate\nuh the investment you've made in doing\nthe right\nthings for the right reasons absolutely\nyeah absolutely and like you said\nearlier\nthe arthur and blank family foundation\nhas given 400 million dollars\nover since 1995 there's so many\nincredible\nventures and many of them have been in\nthe space of childhood development\neducation and the arts and parks and\ngreen space and i wanted to know\nwhy you specifically selected each of\nthose three\ni mean they're so beautiful in their own\nright but i'd love to know from your own\nperspective as to why you believe\nthose three areas are so important well\ni think you know\nanything and doesn't have to be in\nmontana obviously because most people\ndon't live here but you know anything\nconnected to green space to parks\nto nature to getting outside to find\nthat solitude that quietness that\nplace where you can uh reflect and a\nplace where you actually you can\nuh you know go with family and friends\nand experience things that\nthat aren't driven by you know on my\nphone every\nevery three and a half minutes or less\nso i think that you know that's an area\nthat we've always felt very very\nstrongly about\nuh obviously we're involved in\nconservation here in montana as well\nand elsewhere in the west so it wasn't\nit's not just these two ranches which\nwe think are models in terms of ranches\nshould operate not just from a guest\nstandpoint but from you know in terms of\nthe\nthe uh the actual ag process that we\nhave going on\num so we've always felt strong about\nthat being outside\nbeing connected to nature being\nconnected to people that you're outside\nwith\nit opens up a different perspective on\nviewing the world and viewing each other\nand having that sense of community a\nsense of community is so important i was\nraised in an apartment house\nand um and as with the rest of my family\nbut\nyou know what's interesting is that you\nknow those apartment houses when it was\nduring the summer it was warm or even\nin the fall spring was in new york city\npeople would bring their little chairs\ndownstairs and everybody would sit\nlike outside the apartment because they\nhad that\nyou know that need desire for connection\nto others\nand i think that's true whether you're\nliving in an apartment or whether you're\nliving in a home or whether you're\nliving so we\nat our ranches we don't promote the use\nof technology i'm sorry jay\ni apologize for that but i but i mean\nyou know there are places where people\ncan use technology because of\nconferences and other work but but we\ndon't actively promote it\nwe want people to get outside we want\npeople to experience nature we want\npeople to touch and feel things and that\nsilence that solitude and that you know\nfinding a quietness within themselves\nthat intercom\nwhich they can do so beautifully in\nnature public education has always been\na big issue for me i went through\na public school my whole life didn't i\nwent to a\ndidn't go to private schools i went to\ncollege i went to small business school\nbabson college out of boston\nand so i feel like you know\nyou know the more we can do in terms of\npublic education at a higher level\ncreates you know really unlocks minds of\nall of our young people\nthat exposure thomas friedman was right\nmany years ago he wrote his book the\nworld is flat\num and i think we're realizing that more\nand more and more over time the book's\n25 years old but reality is that we're\nseeing that every day it's\nbecoming less curved and more flat and\neverybody is connected\nand i think you know that's a wonderful\nthing um\nso i think you know public education uh\nbecause not everybody or very few people\nuh can afford you know private schools\nand you know a\nkind of an answer that's that's just\nworks for a handful of people relatively\num so that's always been very important\nto my family and uh\nand my children as well and they're very\nactively involved in that\nright arena um so those are some of the\nthings we do a lot of work um\nin areas of culture because we think\nculture is another way\nthere's a lot of times it's too much of\nan emphasis in my opinion on\non book learning and what have you and\nsome people learn differently they learn\nby\nexpressing themselves through yoga\nthrough arts through athletics to\nwhatever it may be\nmusic drama um and so i think you\nhave to let people kind of find\nthemselves in that in those ways as well\nsadly in the public education area a lot\nof those\nuh opportunities for expression\nhave been cut back and eliminated uh so\nwe'd like to see more of that expanded\nover time because i think it's very\nhealthy for everybody\nyeah i love that how you've chosen three\nthings that encourage so much internal\ngrowth\nright like i feel like your investment\nin parks and green spaces is about\npeople finding internal cars and even\nthis week we've had all these incredible\noutdoor activities\nthat you've arranged and the team's\narranged here for everyone to partake in\nand we've seen how\npeople are bonding closer when they're\nout and about in green spaces and\noutdoors and\ngoing on these beautiful walks and\nriding or whatever else it may be\nright and and especially what you're\nspeaking about the education system of\ncourse and then\ni i think you're spot on when you talk\nabout how arts\nand the arts allow us to express\nourselves more effectively\nand how that's never always encouraged\nright and so your investment in that\nspace i'm sure has made it well i think\nyou know as you know and many of our\nguests know that you know\nthat education you know the book\neducation is very important\nthe life education is in many cases even\nmore important than\nexposure and what have you it's one of\nthe reasons we our foundation has just\njust started to invest on an\ninternational basis we're doing work and\na half ago doing work in the caribbean\net cetera but one of the reasons is is\nnot because\nyou know i mean we don't have enough\nopportunities within the united states\nwe do and much needs we do but\ni wanted to send an important message\nyou know to our family\nand to our associates is that you know\nnot just talking about\nyou know humankind being uh being\nconnected but actually\ndemonstrate that so and you know the\ncase of nigeria where 60 of the\npopulation lives on less than a dollar a\nday\nyou know we want people to be aware of\nthat and you know how do we participate\nand support uh answers in those areas of\nthe world so\num i think that the notion that we are\nbrothers keepers uh which is an integral\npart of our faith and the faith of you\nknow\npart of everybody's faith i believe uh\nis very important and it's not just\nit starts maybe with your family your\nextended family your community but it\nreally\nhas to include everybody on the face of\nthe earth that's why the earth is\nimportant uh\nyou know the earth is important because\nwe all live here uh because we've got to\ntake care of it a little better than we\nhave been\nabsolutely that that resonates so\nstrongly with me because one of the\nreasons why i became a monk and\none of our teachings was that you became\na monk and you were free\nfrom your basic family responsibilities\nso that you could see the whole world as\nyour family right right and so that you\ncould go and extend yourself even\nfurther\nand i think it's beautiful to see you do\nthat i mean you have six children and\nsix grandchildren six grandchildren six\nand six right yeah six and six and what\nis your\nwhat is that several dogs dogs as well\namazing and horses and horses\nwhat are the what is the legacy that\nyou're hoping that they're going to\ncarry forward to the future generations\nas\nthe foundation grows well i don't you\nknow i think it's important\nfor them to to find themselves um you\nknow they need to climb their own\nmountains they need to\nexplore themselves they need to you know\nfall down and pick themselves up or to\nneed to learn\ndeal with adversity and growth both\nphysically and\npersonally so our older children\nare all involved our family foundation\nand all actively involved in a variety\nof areas that we've\ntalked about many we haven't but they're\ninvolved in all of them\nuh in addition to that they're each one\nis starting their own\nfoundation now much smaller but i want\nto see\nmake sure they know how to evaluate make\nsure they know how to do their work etc\nbecause\nuh when you're giving you're giving\nyou're always getting more i mean it\nmakes no difference\nwhether it's physical work or financial\nwhatever it may be the more we give the\nmore we get\nback that's just kind of the way the\nmath of the world works the universe and\nour\nand our soul uh works so uh the younger\nchildren\nhave um uh age age-appropriate exposure\nto philanthropy\none's 22 2 or 18. so they're younger but\nthey're getting exposed to it\nmostly by doing uh not by writing checks\nbut by doing things and being connected\nin service in a variety of ways\num and they're interested in all of our\nbusinesses as well but\nyou know bringing them along very slowly\nand making sure they understand our\nvalues that nothing\nis going to be given to them whatever\nthey get has to be earned\nand earned primarily through\nunderstanding these values\nliving these values being a great role\nmodel caring about community\ncaring about others caring about service\ncaring about purpose\nand um you know my my hope my desire as\na parent\nuh is that you know the children will\ngrow when i'm\nlong gone and they will have their own\nyou know their own set of values the\nguys hopefully they've learned from\ntheir mother\ntheir mothers and their father and\nthey'll continue to do\nyou know the work that we're doing today\nand expand it i mean i\ni don't uh i don't have a written set of\nof uh things these are the seven things\nwe're going to do after i'm gone so i'm\nnot going to manage my foundation for my\ngrave\ni have enough faith in my children and\nthey'll make the right decisions based\non the passions they know the father has\ntheir own passions which are critical so\nthey're they're really feeling they're\ndoing the work that's important to them\nand that they uh are doing work that's\nimportant in terms of the times that\nwe're facing so\nthere's well-being you know wellness\nwell-being notion is at a critical mass\nyou know today in our in our country uh\nif not the world but certainly in our\ncountry\nuh whether it be the rate of suicides\nwhich continue to climb with dramatic\nrates which affect you know the veteran\npopulation\na very young population 10 to 14\nand uh is double what it is on a\nnational basis so\nthere are you know those serious issues\nwe're facing today\nthey'll have other maybe issues in the\nin the future and so\nwhatever they are you know they should\nfeel you know the passion the drive to\nwant to make a difference in those areas\nand put themselves and resources in\nplace to help\nothers you know come to a better\nconclusion that whatever it may be\nabsolutely and i've read that your\nfavorite\nquote on a t-shirt is that there is no\nfinish line the wi-fi\nis called no finish line what does that\nmean to you and also\nwhat is the personal work you're doing\nright now in that regard what are the\ninternal things\nthat you're working on at this stage in\nyour life um\nwell i think you know it came came to me\nuh\nprimarily for my my running initially i\nran competitively and\num nike had this t-shirt so there was no\nfinish line there was a guy running the\nwoods and\ncouldn't find another one of them i saw\nit someplace i phil knight was kind\nenough for nike\nwas kind enough to get me one of the\nshirts and you know i think uh in\nvirtually all areas of my life um i\nunderstand that\nyou know um you know the next day isn't\nnecessarily the end there's always\nmore to do and etc etc and i think you\nhave to have\nthe ability to deal with uh adversity\ngrit bounce back you know\nand uh continues putting one step in\nfront of the other i got that from my\nlong distance running\nyou probably got that from your monkhood\nand maybe athletics as well in other\nother areas of your life but um\nyou know the ability to understand that\nthese problems that we're facing\nare not you know you're not in and out\nin 5 or 10 15 minutes it's not a\ntransaction it's about relationships all\nof our businesses are that way\nit's never about the transaction it's\nalways about the relationship so these\ncauses\nthese issues that we have today in our\ncountry and worldwide\nare not going to go away tomorrow so we\nhave to have\nthe wisdom to understand that we also\nhave to have the\ntenacity to say we're going to make a\ndent and we're going to make a\ndifference just as my mother said and\nthe bracelet i'm wearing\nbut we're going to make a difference and\nevery day we're going to continue to\nstrive to move forward and to make a\ndifference in that area so\ni think um you know it's important i\nthink my oldest thought would say dad\nthat you know i love the expression i\nlove the feeling but you know\num which brings me back to myself a\nlittle bit she said but at some point\nyou know in your life you need to you\nknow uh you need to be able to say that\ni'm kind of out of\nyou need to be at peace with where you\nare and that's where i think\nuh my version of wellness\nand well-being has changed because it\nused to be running seven days a week if\ni didn't do that\nyou know that was that was my design\naround fitness and well-being\nin many ways you know physical fitness\nis important\nbut i think the whole notion of uh\ntrying to dig deeper\nand uh really understand myself\nand my real purpose and uh\nyou know are we connecting the dots as\nwell as we can\nuh taking time for myself to every day\nuh\ndo meditation i need to get back on that\nhorse again\ni did it for a number of months with the\nuh you know i got encouraged invited by\ndeepak chopra but i\nneed to get back on and do it again\nbecause i saw the value of that you know\nfor a very long period of time\nthe work i do in terms of yoga and just\nthe quietness\nliving in a quiet space and taking time\nto reflect and it's one of the reasons i\nlove montana we come out here and we\nwalk we hike or whatever it may be\nhorseback riding and\nand see this beautiful scenery but it's\nquiet time so the ability to be calm the\nability to reflect the ability to build\nit into my life every day\nwhere i'm not kind of a gerbil on the\nwheel which is constantly running\nthe ability to get off that off that you\nknow that cycle\nand uh pause reflect you know understand\nbuild back my strength\nmy my vision i think that's been an\nimportant part of my own personal growth\nthat part of it didn't take place\nuntil you know probably just maybe four\nor five years ago i think when i\ni began to think more about you know in\na broader sense a deeper sense\npurpose and and and service to others a\ngood example of\nhow we can connect you know great\nbusiness to doing the right things for\nthe right reasons\nwe built a new stadium in atlanta\ngeorgia the mercedes-benz stadium\nvoted the best sports facility united\nstates in the last two years and\nmaybe in the world but it's built in\ndowntown atlanta which is magnificent\ntoday but it's a part of downtown\natlanta the west side of atlanta which\nis the birthplace of dr king birthplace\nof many civil rights leaders\num that has gone you know downhill for\nthe last 30 years\nunlike most of the years in atlanta when\ni moved there there were a million\npeople\nnow there are over seven million people\nliving in atlanta and so\nwe set out from the very beginning with\nsaying look we're going to build\nthe best stadium in the world that's\ndesigned around the people that we're\nserving the guests that are in the\nstadium\nthere's no question we're going to be\n100 successful that\nand i met with a lot of people uh from\nthe religious community\nwho said you know i said well how do we\nhelp\nhow does this create a situation where\nwe can create a rising tide we'll float\nall boats all these communities that are\nconnected to our stadium\nbut have fallen falling backwards uh\nslid backwards\num and they said it's not about\nbuildings it's about you know human\ncapital\nso we spent three years uh actually\nbecause one of our\nkey components or values is to listen\nyou know to listen and respond listen\nand respond\nwhether it be people were serving our\nbusinesses or people that were serving\nwith through the foundation\nso we walked the streets of the of the\nwest side\nuh met with neighborhood groups\nand you know basically didn't say very\nmuch we just said look we're going to\nbuild this magnificent stadium\nwe want it to be a positive force in\nyour lives we're done talking\nnow you tell us what is it that's\nimportant to you what's important to\nyour community what's important to your\nfamily et cetera et cetera\nand you know it's it it wasn't a list of\n100 things it was a list of four five\nsix things that were really critical to\nthem\nand so we made it clear from the very\nbeginning that you know\nwe'll the stadium project will take us\nseven years from design\nyou know the uh thinking about the\nstructure et cetera building it\nbut this is going to be a 20 30 year\nprocess that's where there is no finish\nline\nkind of filled in as well fits in as\nwell\num and so we uh we spent\na great deal of time listening and then\nresponding and uh one good example is a\nprogram called\nwhat west side works one of the things\nthat everybody said in the community we\nneed jobs\nwe don't have jobs uh and that affects\nus in a whole variety of ways\nuh so we uh we trained uh we had\nover half the people living in those zip\ncodes\napplied for this program called west\nside works\nwe've um we've taken in uh probably\nclose to a thousand have been trained\num and the training really is to give\nthem\nthe life skills and the work skills so\nthey can be successful\nnot just on one project so whether it be\nin construction or\nfood or baking or nursing or\ni.t whatever whatever it may be whatever\ntheir interest was\nwe did all that training and then we put\nthem to work\nso a lot of these training programs\nwhere they fall down is that\nthey train them but they don't don't\nmake the connection to it they need a\njob you know\ni really need a job so our our notion\nwas every single person who graduated\nthis program was going to actually have\na paying job\nand what have you so you know when\nwhoever it may be went back in their\nhouse and it was one individual i\nremember his name was lloyd\nit was a great story about he was a he\nwas a tattoo artist\nand um he had three children\na single father and uh you know because\nof the\nnature of what he was doing he wouldn't\nbe home in the evenings his kids would\ngo to school\ncome home he was not home he was out you\nknow doing his\ndoing his trade and so he went through\nthis\nbecame part of the construction crew\nthat helped build the stadium and now\nwas working\nwith construction in a variety of other\nareas but he had a regular job\ncame to work at eight in the morning\nworked until four or three five in the\nafternoon whatever maybe\nthen he was home in the evening so he\nwas making money\nhe was walking in the door his chest was\nyou know out his shoulders were back\nsmile on his face his kid said you know\nit's not just financially but his\nability self-confidence and his ability\nto say you know i can make a difference\nnot only in my life but now in their\nlives that story was told probably a\nthousand times over on the west side\num and that's you know we understand\nit's a longer journey we understand\nhuman capital in human capacity takes\ntime to nurture and to help grow\nbut we're equally committed to that and\nthat's true with all this community work\nthat we that we do we try to identify\nnot what we see you know as needs is\nreally what the needs are by the people\nthat are living these communities yes\nsometimes foundations make a mistake and\nthey you know they operate let's say\nfrom atlanta and they throw scud\nmissiles\nhere there and elsewhere good works i\nshould say here there and elsewhere but\nthey don't really understand the pulse\non the ground\nwhat's actually happening what does it\nmean to live that way\num and so we spent a lot of time most of\nour time\nin uh starting our evaluation work by\nunderstanding what is it that the people\nthat we're serving what is it that\nthey're saying now what we're saying\nwhat are they sir\nsaying where do they feel that they need\nhelp and support\nand obviously we're trying to you know\nteach people to fish\nversus you know giving them fish and and\nuh so\nthat's one example of a a beautiful\nstory that\nfound a business model that was\nfabulously successful\nbut a community involvement that's been\nyou know incredibly successful as well\num so we make emphasis there on\neducation on health and their financial\nservices to understand\nyou know what loans mean how do you pay\nthem off how do you\ndo a variety of things financial\nplanning etc so um that's\njust one example but there are many many\nother examples of that but uh\nand it's this connection between uh it's\nit's and that those kind of things give\nour associates\na tremendous sense of fulfillment and\npurpose in their own lives because they\nsee\ni'm part of an organization it's not\njust about how many medals how many\nawards how many wins how many this can\nwhatever it may be it's about how how do\nwe\nwin the super bowl of life every year\nwhich i tell our football players\nsaid you have 11 guys the other side of\nthe line you may not win the super bowl\nevery year or the mls cup every year\nbut we can win the super bowl of life\nevery year because nobody\nother side of the line you know\ndefending us from doing that so we see\nthe opportunities\nour players coaches staff organization\nand they have a tremendous sense of\npride in that yes\nthe whole issue of social justice in the\nnfl\ntoday which uh has been incredibly\nimportant uh\nwe've been very heavily engaged at both\nat the league level but at the club\nlevel so\nat the club level we have 12 15 players\nwho\nwe spent you know three months with them\nlistening to them\ntelling us look this is what's going on\nin my communities this is what i had to\nlive with as a child this is what i had\nto overcome this is what my parents\nstill live with my\nsiblings whatever it may be and so then\nwe responded\nyou know in terms of our engagement with\nthem\nso it's not like us doing for them it's\nus doing alongside them\nconnected to them shoulder to shoulder\nwhere they feel like you know we're in\nthis together\num and that's a beautiful thing to\nhappen and i think\nyou know we want our associates to feel\nthat sense of pride\nand feel that sense of this organization\nreally has a\nheart and a soul and a purpose to it and\nthe beauty is\nyou do all these wonderful things\nbehaviorally\nand you're going to produce the right\nfinancial results i mean it's\nyou know it's important to do that\nbecause in my case because we want to\ncontinue to\nfund things that we see opportunities\nfor them so\nthat's phenomenal thank you for sharing\nthat well thank you for asking that\nthank you for listening you know of\ncourse yeah absolutely i wish i could\nget more to the point as as you do so\nbeautifully a lot of your messages no\nbut it's yeah it's powerful work you're\ndoing the work i i think detail is great\nwhen\npeople are able to see how deeply\nintense how deep the intention is\nright in the sense that i feel like when\nyou're explaining something\nyou're not just explaining what you're\ndoing you're explaining why you're doing\nit and how you're doing it right it's\ngoing to take longer so\ni mean the the what is is you know is\nthe\neasiest part it's the why i mean that's\nwhat's sustainable in the heart and the\nspirit\nand souls that when we understand it our\nfoundation\nour associates some of our businesses\nunderstand why we're doing the things\nwe're doing\nit makes a difference in their lives as\nwell and and they feel like because this\nwhole state's being recycled back\nthey're working not only to\nhave purpose in terms of who we're\nserving but they're working in terms of\nhaving purpose in building\nthe foundation which has to be you know\nrecycled\nin a positive way so absolutely it's a\nbeautiful circle\nuh that's very very tight and there\nreally no really no breaks in it\nyeah um so it's um it's a beautiful\nthing to be part of\namazing arthur you've been incredible we\nend every interview with what we call\nthe\nfinal five quickfire rapid fire round so\nyou can only answer the questions with\none word\nokay or maximum one sentence i need a\nglass of water for that yeah\nyeah absolutely yeah and so what i've\ndone is we've created considering your\nname\nis arthur blank we've we've done this\nfinal five is fill in the blanks\nso i'm gonna ask you\nso i can ask you i'm gonna ask you to\nfill in the blank at the end of the\nsentence the hardest thing for me is the\none word\nif you know now yes i tend to give a\nlong list that's right so that's why\nthis\nthis section is for that so the first\nquestion is the best advice\ni've ever received is blank so what\nwould it be\nfinish the sentence the best of advice\nbe true to my values okay wonderful the\nsecond question is\nthe worst advice i've ever received is\nblank\ni would say you know focus uh the focus\non\num you know productivity the focus\non financial metrics you know as being\nthe goal uh versus you know all the\nother things in terms of behavior\nuh and uh and changing people's lives in\na positive way\nand seeing the joy in that you know\nthat's been great\ngreat answer okay question number three\nthree things i'm grateful for\nuh blink well i have to start my family\nyou know um you know six sixth grade\nchildren six great grandchildren and\nand uh great you know i've been married\nmultiple times\nuh unfortunately but i have a great\nrelationship with all of my\nex-wives and they're all wonderful\npeople and uh\nso i'd say my you know my my family and\nmy relationships i think\nmy um ability as a result of\nour business success to try to have\nan opportunity to expand you know what\nservice means of others\ncreate that with our associates and who\nwe're serving in all of our different\nbusinesses\nyeah do this one blank\nthing and it will change your life what\nwould you put into that blank\nwhat would that one thing be\nfind your passion because i think when\nsomebody\nkind of add on another word or two yeah\nyeah yeah\ni'm gonna say absolutely you know\nbecause i think\nwhen people find their passion and their\npurpose\num you know financially they're going to\ndo as\nwell if not better than they ever would\nhave done doing anything else\nand you know their years\nhere which are you know limited they're\nmeasured if you will\num are going to be much more enriched\nbecause they're going to feel like what\ni'm doing\nwhat i'm really doing has purpose for me\nand purpose for others that i'm trying\nto serve\nand uh so i think finding purpose\nuh which is not always easy i mean\nsometimes people wander around a bit you\nyou did you describe your journey um and\nmyself as well i had my own\nyou know journeys there um but when you\nfind it\nuh you need to you know stop and honor\nit and to move with it and\nand uh all good things come as a result\nof that you know\nin terms of quality of life absolutely\nand the fifth and final question\nis the one thing that you're hoping\nthis beautiful four or five days we'd\nhad here in montana will result in\nwell i think there are two there are two\nthings that expand the question a little\nbit one\nis that you know the great connections\nthat you have made with so many other\npeople here\nuh and they've made with you and with\neach other i think so i think those\nphysical connections emotions it's one\nthing to know somebody but when you\nspend\nfour days together uh in this setting\nyou\nget a deeper deeper understanding of\npeople's perspectives and their views\nand how can we work together two and two\nequals\neight and ten instead of just four or\nfive for myself\nso i think that has been very invaluable\nthe other thing is that i think we'll be\nable to focus for\nour foundation and and you know jorah\nand other foundations and other\ninstitutions that care about these\nthings\num you know some really good ideas to\nhelp support\nthe expansion of the notion of\nwell-being and wellness and give\nexposure to that to other populations\nthat don't necessarily have that or see\nthat uh and to uh\nuh you know to not you know have this\nthis widen\nthis gap that we have in america today\nis just too extreme in my in my\nviewpoint\nand i think you know we need to do more\nof this and bring people together not\nnecessarily\nyou know economically as equals because\nthat's not reality in a capitalistic\nworld but you know to bring people\ntogether in terms of their well-being\nand their happiness and their\nability to feel fulfilled in life so we\nwant to you know\nget in the canoe and paddle along with\neverybody else and paddle as hard as\neverybody else and know\nwe can make a difference uh and uh\nand try to earn you know the respect and\nthe opportunity it's an honor really\nhaving everybody here from\nmy standpoint it's an overwhelming honor\nto have\num not just the intelligence in the room\nbut the\nthe commitment and the sense of purpose\nin the sense of\ntrying to reach out make a difference in\nthe world\nis incredible to me so anything we can\ndo\nsupporting the collaborations supporting\nthe partnerships\nnew ideas expanding ideas scaling up\nventures etc which is much of what i\nknow your your\nuh concern is going forward how do i\nimpact more people\nwhich is great uh we want to be part of\nthat so it's been an honor for me\ntruly an honor for me to be here this\nweek and to just be part of this it's um\nexperience in my lifetime i'll never\nforget i've gotten a great deal out of\nit\nmuch more than you know i've gotten much\nmore out of it than we put into it\nand that's the beauty of when you do\nthings with service and purpose you\nreally do get more out of it than what\nyou give\nyeah well i want to thank you on behalf\nof me and all the other participants\nbecause i think\nyou've allowed us to form such deep\namazing relationships\nthere's many people in this room that i\nwould have loved to connect with or\nmeet and you're so right that when you\ngo away with people for three four days\nyou go so much deeper so much quicker\nthan you would if you met at a\nconference or a one day event or\nwhatever it may be so i just want to say\nthank you from you're welcome from me\nthank you for your kindness thank you\nfor your encouragement\nuh you've given me so many wonderful\nvotes of confidence this week and\njust sharing so much support and\nencouragement for the work i do which\nhas given me so much conviction\nand i'm very grateful for that thank you\nall the work that you do is is\nincredible and it's it really has\nyou know tremendous purpose to it and\nand uh and\nhigh degree of success so i i want to do\neverything we can do\num to help support you and support you\nknow uh\nthe people you're touching and trying to\nuh help with their life journeys\nso um i think you know this is a great\nplace to do it because when you spend\ntime outdoors you\nrealize you know you're kind of dwarfed\nby nature\nby things that have been here for\nthousands and thousands of years and\nalso everybody puts on their pants the\nsame way it's a level playing field\nnobody's wearing suits nobody's wearing\nties everybody's just\nyou know being themselves and they're\nopening themselves up and in this kind\nof environment\nuh it's easier to do that and so\nthat's the reason we wanted to continue\nto do this work here absolutely thank\nyou again arthur\nthank you everyone
