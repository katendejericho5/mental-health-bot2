    "transcript": "designing a life uh in such a way that\neverything that you do and every\ndecision you make\nis either leading towards uh your legacy\nuh your lifestyle or or your happiness\nand then making sure that you don't\never do anything other than what\nsupports that\nhey everyone thank you so much for\ncoming back to\nthe show today's guest is a school\ndropout\nturned pro skateboarder turned tv host\nturned entrepreneur whose incredible\nbusinesses span\neverything from food to shoes to real\nestate and entertainment\nyou'll know him as the host of mtv's\nridiculousness and also the founder of\ndear deck machine\ni'm so excited to introduce you to rob\ndiadek rob thank you so much for coming\non to the show thank you\nthank you i mean when we run through it\nin that order you know what i mean it's\nlike\ni i just he dropped out professional\nskateboard tv\nlike it always when i'm always reminded\nof the path\nthrough sort of those big buckets it's\nalways so funny to me to\nthink of like where i've arrived you\nknow yeah you've\nreinvented and recreated yourself so\nmany times in a positive sense yeah or\njust relentlessly evolved right it's\nalmost like\nyou uh you constantly evolve at such a\npace i'd even say even when i look at\ninterviews if i do an interview every\nsix to eight months like i just you know\ni think back to our buddy louis howe's\nschool of greatness that i did to really\nkind of set off doing podcast interviews\nand i\nthink about how much i grew in the two\nyears in between that\nis so remarkable someone was using these\ntype of interviews\nas uh these sort of markers of the\nelevation that i'm doing every six to\neight months you know i love that man\nthat's such a beautiful way of looking\nat podcasts yeah bit of self-reflection\nbecause it's also the only place you can\nhave like a real conversation you know\nyeah that's that's a little bit deeper\nrather than when\ni do a tv interview or something to\npromote one of the shows it's like\ntell us about the funniest video you got\non there oh wow\nit's a guy that slides underneath a semi\ntruck and gets ran over but pops up and\nsays oh my god i didn't die\nyou know it's like something like that\nyeah absolutely well here that was the\nwhole purpose of this podcast my whole\ngoal was\nhow can i let incredible people like you\nhave open conversations allow you to\nshare from a different side of yourself\nthat you don't always get to share\ngive people a moment a space to\nbring themselves from a more belief\npoint of view philosophies views\nideas things that drive you motivate you\nbut i remember the first time we met\nwhich funnily enough we were both saying\nis the only time we've met yeah even\nthough i feel like i've been watching\nyou as well i consume your content all\nthe time which is which is awesome but\nthe first time we met we were together\nbecause of pig out chips\nand pig out bacon and i found out that\nyou're not vegan but you love pigs\nwhich i thought was pretty cool i love\nthat but yeah\nexplain explain to me how you got\ninvolved in picking out chips let's\nstart there you know you know i think\nit was really sort of my evolved sort of\nway of creating\ninvesting in businesses uh i think one\nof the big things that i really look at\nis that sort of do or dier\nuh as i describe it entrepreneur\nfounder right and that was bill glazer\nand like what\nuh he really had is a very unique skill\nset\nand then when i run through my\nprinciples when i look at opportunity\nit's\ndo or dire founder leadership team it's\nwhite space\nclear path to to liquidity and unfair\nadvantages\nright is sort of what i try to run\nthrough the filter and\num the thing about the product itself we\nalready know that sort of the\nvegan market and plant-based products\nare really sort of evolving\nbut it was like when i tasted it for the\nfirst time i was like oh my god this is\nlike a revolution this is bigger than\nlike this is bigger than just like you\nknow and it was called fresh soul at the\ntime\nand i was like man like this is like an\nentire category this is like meat chips\nyou know what i mean like this is\nsomething so much\nuh more unique and and\nit's entirely owned vertical right and\nas i decided to invest with them\nuh we went through sort of this unusual\nprocess right like where for me\neverything is validated through a\nfinancial model right and\nand he had created one of the most\nbeautiful tactical models on how he\nwould grow the business\ndoor for door skew for skew margin for\nmarch like just\nthe beauty of who you want to be in\nbusiness with right and\nit's very rare that you have a creative\nmind an operational mind and a financial\nmind that's running a business\nbut was missing was it was called fresh\nsoul\nright and i'm like man it's like i'm\nlike you have this super unique product\nand and this entire space is like\nhampton creek beyond me it's like it's\nall this soft like\nlike that's what you you expect there's\nan opportunity to be\nlouder and more aggressive in this space\nand\nyou know i was you know texting him and\nhitting him with like vigilante\nand like trying to think of like all\nthese different sort of\nnames or ideas and\nhe called me and said i think i got an\nidea man\nwhat do you think about pig out and i\nwas like oh whoa\nthat's aggressive that's a little too\naggressive i think you know and\nuh as i really started thinking about it\nand then as he was like you know like no\npig and it's all baking products i'm\nlike oh god it's\nsticky man it's sticky and and then\nyou know because what we're struggling\nwith is like are you like an honest co\nare you a craft like do you have\nmultiple verticals of products like\nand the beauty of it is it landed on\nthis\nuh sort of idea of pig out and then\noutstanding\nfoods because taste will always be at\nthe top of the pyramid right and\num i think it at that point\nthat creative process together and that\nsort of evolution of\nideation to go along with how smart he\nwas and how clear he understood the\nbusiness and the authenticity\nof chef dave and the creation of the\nproduct and both\n25-year vegans um\ndespite not being a vegan i was like man\nthis is this is just an absolute home\nrun you know and\nand and i came on in a very significant\nlevel right\nso that we would really become uh true\npartners almost co-founders if you will\nin this completely\nevolved version of the business um\nand you know i i think even a testimony\nto even bill is finding someone like you\nright of just like hey like you you\ncreate this deeply viral content of like\nuh he's just constantly evolving and\ngetting in front of so many different\nlayers of people from manufacturing\nto financial support to to creative\nsupport to\nuh different ways to continue to evolve\nand\num push the brand uh\npre-revenue to such a high level\nabsolutely so\nit's it's the shining star if i have 20\ndifferent portfolio companies right now\nthat i've all\n17 of which i've built over the last two\nyears\nit's the shining star of\nof what the archetype is especially when\nyou\nlayered against the principles right and\nthe unfair advantages\ndistribution relationships ton of\ninfluencer investors like\num you know great clear path to\nacquisition long-term or going public\nbased off of sort of the growth of the\nmarket it really not only meets\nmy four core principles but um\nat the top of the pyramid he is uh who i\nhope to be in business with\nin every single venture that i do going\nforward that's beautiful man i love bill\nbill big shout out to you we love you\nyeah\nbill you got look yeah you've heard it\nbefore but now you've got it on jay's\npocket yeah exactly and i love pick out\nchips too man it's\na great product for sure and i love the\nname i didn't know that story yeah i\nlove that story that's such a great\nstory\nand i think even like i texted him like\nthe pig face and the out symbol yeah\nwhich led to like man we should make\nwhen we were branding it it was like nah\nlike we should like\nunderline the output the line to the out\nand we need to make\nour uh tony the tiger like make like a\nstreet wear\nsort of like cause like pig character\nwhich even led to creating even uh\nthe actual uh pig character and and one\nof the early\nthings that i loved was it was\nthis joke that bill had of the\npig character being like finally bacon i\ncan eat\nright and i just thought ah that pigs\nlove mushrooms and\nthis is i just love this it's super edgy\npeople\nit'll be super controversial and\nyou know we wrote on it wrote on it\nright it says it on the package\nthe little pig has a little bubble it\nsays finally bacon i can eat\nand we took it so far that we posted a a\nvideo of a pig eating it\nand i posted it this is great and people\njust annihilated me\nand like i was like man like\ni i fundamentally\nlike was so wrapped up in how funny and\ngreat the idea was it was like would you\neat human\ntasting chips right like it just\nand it was like a last second change\nwhere\nyou know it affected me enough where i\ndidn't really tell him we talked about\nit a little bit\nbut weeks went by and then right as we\nwere about to go into production i just\nhad a panic call i said look\nwe got to take it off the bag we got to\ntake it off the bag like i\ni just it's it's gonna be permanent now\nit's gonna be on every single shelf it's\none thing to\nto like delete a social media post but\nif it's like finely baking i can eat on\na bag it\nit could be a lot more problematic than\nit is\nuh good for us and changed it at the\nlast second\nand i know we weren't going business\nthat's good i was gonna share it another\ninsight for you\ndo it i love it and i'm not against the\nbusiness i i wanna i wanna talk about\nbusiness from you because i\nsee the way you talk about business is\nphilosophical yeah\nlike the way you see businesses\nphilosophy because it's like an\nabsolute deep life passion and life\nmastery\nso you love it so much and it's someone\nthat just\nengages with people's passions here\nregardless of whatever it is\num i i think it's contagious for anybody\nthat's from that sort of mindset\nabsolutely man and it is it's like even\nfor me it's the\nlike it's the creation of it\nis what i love so much you know and even\nto the point where i just no longer even\ninvest in people's ideas like if\ni can't help shape it if i can't push\nyou and then you hit me with pig out\nit's like\nif i can't go through that crazy process\nand then\nyou then it's like here's the the bad\ncolor like well here's the bag it's like\nwhat\nlike every time the greatest thrill in\nthe world\nis a conversation about an idea to where\nit's\nfinally in market and sold to someone\nright in the entire process of that\nright\nand i don't like to operate businesses\nright\ni don't like to run them i like to be in\nthe creation side and build my\nsystem to make sure that i live in that\nstage that's the birthing stage and the\nshaping\nand then i create systems to ensure that\nit goes on\nand finds success because\nit's only fun when it works right\nbecause it's a you're so excited in that\nearly stage and you get it to market and\nyou can't find the consumer\nnobody wants it like now you're trying\nto mess with pricing strategy was our\nmessaging wrong like\nlike that that they call it the valley\nof death in business\nand i like to refer to myself as a\nsherpa through the valley of death\nuh and it is such a\nthem it's so fun until you get to market\nand then now you have to fight for your\nlife\nto become a real business right and it's\nalso\nthrilling from afar that's why i love to\nhelp\ncreate finance and then advise\nuh because being in the trenches uh\ncan takes a lot of like heart blood\nsweat and tears to actually\nuh make something come alive and really\nwork and and so i\nlove advising that to 20\ndifferent people and then if you can\nimagine you have all this incredible\nexperience that you can help share and\nall these different\nunique things that can support each of\nthem that you learn from other ones and\nand\nwhich allows you to be an even better\nsherpa if you will\nuh in those more critical times of what\nit takes to find growth you know\nand rob dropped out of school at 16\nright now\nthat is crazy man like when you dropped\nout like now when i hear you speak\nit's like you got an mba like you know\nit's\nyour understanding of business is even\ndeeper than that because it's practical\nit's tested it's\nexperimented but when you dropped out at\n16 yeah\nsee now it's become somewhat of a trend\nto talk about dropping out being an\nentrepreneur\nyeah not having to go to college when\nyou did it it wasn't cool like it wasn't\nthe in thing to do i'm sure yeah were\nyou scared\ni look i i were you excited it was\ndifferent\ncircumstances because\ni've never i was gifted with deep belief\nright so it wasn't like it was going to\nschool was just problematic for my path\nright so i didn't look at it like am i\ntaking some sort of risk i was also\nraised by entrepreneurs like everyone\naround me\nstarted companies every single person\nit's why i\nuh quit school at 16 and started my\nfirst company\nbuilt it soup to nuts conceptualized the\nentire concept\nput together the entire uh product line\nthe\nthe entire team it was a skateboard\ntruck team and\nbuilt the hand drew the logo as reading\nthis book the orion prophecies\nuh and and created the orion trucks\nyou know this part of the skateboard and\nlaunched out of 18.\nright so that was the the beginning of\nthe process so i never looked at it as\nuh am i taking a leap of faith and\ntaking some big risk i looked at it as\nev\ni grew up with entrepreneurs everyone\naround me started companies\ni'm gonna quit school and start a\ncompany didn't even like uh\noccur to me any other way and and i also\nwas offered to become a professional\nskateboarder at the time despite the\nfact\nthat you didn't make any money doing it\nright it was still like\num after my after six months\nthey guaranteed me one thousand dollars\na month\nuh if i moved to california and i was\nlike okay i'm moving it\nlet's go like to me it's like because i\nwould get 200\ncheck a 300 check 600 i only get paid\noff board sales\nand you know and that that year in\ndecember before i moved to california\ni sold one board and got a two dollar\ncheck right so you\num getting guaranteed one thousand\ndollars\nwas just like you might as well have hit\nthe lottery\nback then you know so life-changing and\nagain\nblessed with belief just blessed with a\nself-belief\nand very little doubt and everything you\nset up\nchased you achieved which then built the\nfoundation even further\nwhich has always been you know\nsomething that is a the gift that i know\nis the greatest gift that i actually\nhave\nbecause it really uh is like being an\nathlete or any other\nsort of uh mastery or experiencing your\ndevelop but it's the most powerful\nbecause it's the core of\neverything that you ultimately choose to\ndo in your life\nyou know uh and and that to me is is\nwhat i'm most thankful for\nuh from that era unfortunately\nyou jumped off did a bunch of things and\nthey worked\nand all it does is reinforce that right\nlike\nvery few times have i been faced with\nlike a deep\nfailure that wasn't a deeply clear\nlesson\nthat was a part of growth right there's\nno missing elements inside and none\ndevastating enough\nthat made me question\nmy abilities or whether or not i would\neventually\nfind the success that i sought inside\nyou know that's a huge blessing man how\ndoes everyone get that blessing can they\ni i would say in self-reflection\nit's a very unusual point of view\nto have introspect about growth\nright and how can i uh share and\nand how can you learn from from someone\nwho has the hardest thing to actually\nuh evolve within yourself that most\npeople have to create it\nuh over time rather than refine it over\ntime\nand and it it kind of puts me in this\nthis place of where a lot of times when\ni do\num you know podcasts or conversations or\nuh interviews um for events or whatnot i\ni always feel somewhat unrelatable\nbecause of that sort of chord nature is\nalready a great advantage\nin chasing dreams in the first place you\nknow and\nand i can't tell you through experience\nhow\nuh to build it i can just tell you\nwhat i've done with it to optimize it\nyeah\nyeah which is much different thank you\nfor the honesty man yeah it's good to\nhear that honesty\nit's good it's a weird like i get it i\nalmost feel guilty at times yeah like\nwhen you're like\nyou're so happy i'm like look man i'm\ni'm so lucky\nyeah like yeah i get to now try to be\nthis\nlike extraordinary version of myself\nbecause i'm not trying to like rebuild\nthen build right like\nit's a it's it's a you know i'm a little\nsheepish\nabout it but it's oh it's true\nit's awesome i love it i love it i can i\nin my teens i felt i uncovered\nthe ability to follow my intuition very\nclosely yeah so\nwhen i probably around the same time\nthat you're speaking about when i'm 16 i\nfelt like i\nreally started listening to my inner\nvoice and now my inner voice is\nso loud that i don't know what else to\nfollow\nyeah and so all the decisions i've made\nwhether they've been big risks\nexternally\nor big risks how other people see them\nfor me it's been easy\nbecause that voice has just been so loud\nyeah\nand the the other voice which is trying\nto block me or stop me or fearful\ni can barely hear it and it's only got\nlouder and louder and louder yeah and\nyou're right it's an unfair advantage\nand look and i would argue\ni i walk that same side too\nright where where the intuition\num consistency\nright where you uh your gut tells you a\ncertain way\nyou're patient then it happens there's\nanother\nmassive massive cornerstone to\nthis level that i've reached because now\nyou believe so much in your ability\nto manage what's happening inside the\nuniverse that you don't\ncontrol uh but having clarity on\non what you want the outcome to be and\nthen\nbeing patient as you're kicked around\neach thing\nuh that gets you there uh which is also\nanother\nmassive uh skill set that's hard to\nteach that\nlike you're saying when you're gifted\nwith it is a great advantage\non on pursuing dreams\nbut also pursuing happiness right and\nand\nbeing able to navigate uh\nthrough the unknown with just feeling\nis incredibly difficult as well but i\nlike what you said you grounded it\nin self-reflection and self-observation\nis a great place to start\nyeah like that's a great place to start\njust building that yeah\nit's a part of it right because at the\nend of the day you're just mastering\nyourself\nyes you know you're just trying to\nmaster yourself your world everything\nthat actually means the most to you and\nwhat you need for energy and\nwhat takes energy from you it's just\ndifferent for everybody right\nand people that listen to podcasts or\ninto personal development or growth\nyou're really just\ntrying to take little nuggets that you\ncan apply to mastering yourself\nand your own world that ultimately leads\nto\nfulfillment purpose and happiness yeah\nabsolutely tell us about some of your\ncore principles and cornerstones and and\nmore importantly\nhow did you create those like where did\nthey evolve yeah\nand look to me it's it's it's being\ntuned in with\nenergy right and and it's and it's very\nmuch more to do\nwith feeling light right there's just\nthat\nwhen your existence is really based\naround\nuh you get up every day and you're just\nlike a fire's\nlit based off of all you get to do yeah\nright\nand and there's uh no\naspect of your existence that pulls\nagainst you but all of it\ni would even argue rather than pushes\nyou just lightened you right and i think\nfor me\nit was the discovery of that in my late\n30s and the pursuit of getting as light\nas possible and\nand really going deep into\nuh having a greater understanding of\nwhat are the things that\nthat are are missing from really\nuh getting you to this this deeper place\nof lightness if you will to where\neverything around you is\nis energy and i went through a process\nright of of i found that it became\nincredibly binary right it was\neither you looked at something in a\nnegative way or a positive way\nso i would just track all aspects of my\nlife\nevery single day uh 0-10 how i felt\nabout my life health and work\nand by doing it every day like you just\nend up like just having a data point\nthat\npoint you just begin to see all the\nthings that are so clear that are\ntaking away from you and then i just\nbegan to clear\nall of them and it probably took three\nyears to really do\nin and then now\ni don't compromise them right i recently\nuh\nspent some time with the great clinton\nsparks uh\nwho has this incredible concept of\ndefending happy right where he's like\nman i've just never heard anybody\nwho's so committed defending happy the\nway you are\nand i never really like uh quite looked\nat it like that but that's\nactually the clear perspective and sort\nof what i've evolved into\nwhere designing a life uh\nin such a way that everything that you\ndo and every decision you make\nis either leading towards your legacy\nuh your lifestyle or or your happiness\nand then making sure that you don't\never do anything uh other than what\nsupports that\nright and as you described it you're\ndefending happiness and it's like man\nman that's that's what really is what\ni'm doing right and that's uh\nlife systems and and the people that i\nallow into my life how\nand what i do every single day the type\nof businesses that i do the type of\npeople that i'm in business with how i\nlive in those businesses\nthe structure i need with those\nbusinesses how i look at my finances how\ni look at\nmoney how i look at where i want to live\nhow many kids i want to have my\nrelationship with my wife like\nevery single aspect of all of it\nuh into one uh holistic system that\nultimately is built\nto just be happy you know and defend\nhappiness i love you said that so\nit it's a beautiful principle and\nactually\nit's parallel to when i studied again\nwhen i was mentioning the vedic\nphilosophy earlier\nthere's a beautiful statement that says\nthat when you protect your dharma your\ndharma is like\nyour duty what you were born to do your\ncalling your\npassion purpose when you protect your\ndharma your dharma protects you\nyeah and so when you're talking about\ndefending happiness it's like protecting\nand defending and\nwhen you protect your intentions when\nyou define them when you\ndefend them as you said yeah then and i\nwould say you protected back in the\nhardest part\nand especially hearing it and it's\nbecause like at the end of the day\nthese deep principles of happiness are\ntried and true\nhow you design them for yourself is the\ndifficult part\nright because like your your wants and\nneeds\nare so complex that it's not a\none-size-fits-all\nto to design it and then defend it right\nand and i think\nuh for me i\nrefer to it as lifestyle and legacy like\nwhat life\nwhat how do you want to live like i like\nfancy things like i\ni want to live in a giant beautiful\nhouse that i hit a button and all the\ndoors go away\non with giant land and like you know i\nwant\ncrazy cars and uh\nexplore the world the smoothest and\neasiest way\nright like i love the conveniences um\nin my legacy i want to be\nall of the ideas that i sat in room with\nentrepreneurs and created and shape and\nbuild and\nand and 20 years from now the 100 plus\nbusinesses that that i helped uh develop\nin and define and and then\nthe life that i led doing it right of\nshowing that like man you can actually\nbe incredibly successful work incredibly\nhard and be\nsuper balanced and super happy right and\nit's only comes from when you've\nmastered yourself\ndesigned a life plan that has scale so\nthat it can evolve with you and it's\nit's built within sort of these core\nideas\nthat can evolve and grow with you over\ntime you know\nis super hard to do yeah\nyeah yeah for sure you're making it\nsound easier yeah i'm listening to you\nand it sounds like music\nright but i know everyone else listening\nis going\nyeah yeah you do yeah you're like you're\nlike you're like\nof course i gotta do that i gotta do i\nget a plan then you go to like build the\nplants like\ni want to buy a house okay i want to\nwear it you know it's like it gets\nincredibly difficult\nuh at those layers then watching it\ncome alive once you've decided now\nyou're living it\nit becomes this remarkably thrilling\nthing to where like now you're\noptimizing these already deeply\noptimized\nplans even further right which makes\nit really begin to feel like you are\ncontrolling reality because you keep uh\nspecifically laying out how you're going\nto do stuff and you keep doing it over\nand over\nwhich really then begins to feel like\nyou have control of the uncontrollable\nyou know what i mean is\nis the beauty of it but i love how you\nembrace the paradox\nright because in one side you're like\nhosting ridiculousness you're like all\nthese silly videos they're funny\nyeah they're meaningless in one sense\nyou know but they're fun\nthey're fun they're entertaining and\nthen on the other end we're sitting here\ntalking about\nyeah meaningful depth and intention and\nclarity like you literally um\nyou embody the paradox right but keep in\nmind\nit's part of the transition\nyou know what i mean where it's like uh\ni would never do ridiculousness today\nright like it was i looked at it as this\nbusiness opportunity when i created it\nread an article with vinnie debona did\n500 million in\nglobal syndication with america's\nfunniest home videos i was like man\nit's so slow if i made like a cool\nfast-paced one i could put it in the\nsegment like\nhad a vision for for um\nwhat it could be but could have never\npredicted it to this level right\nnow it's this unique art form right\nbecause i\nuh you know put together these episodes\nthen i just\nbasically freestyle comedy\nfor 45 minutes straight that gets\ntouched cut down into a\na television show but\nit was also sort of the world of like\ni got cartoons on nickelodeons i own\nprofessional skateboarding leagues i got\nfantasy factory where i'm\ngetting attacked by sharks and flipping\ncars and i own race horses and\nyou know i got all this different stuff\ni have all these different businesses i\ngot ridiculousness like\nyou know it became this sort of the\nthe way that i always describe it is\nwhen you have the ability\nuh to do anything and you do everything\nyou stand for\nnothing right and it was that sort of\nroute that was like nope you've got to\ndefine what you want\nuh your legacy to be and then go build\nthat\nnow the difference is is i'm afforded a\ntransition uh of\nof having deep notoriety\nfor being a clip show host and it's like\nit's not the it's\npowerful in the sense that it's like man\nyou cr\nanother thing you just created out of\nnowhere like name\nand idea and went and found the\nresources and did it like\nyou know from you know riding a skit for\na skateboard\nvideo uh that turned into robin big the\ntelevision show\nthat turned into like i know how to\nwrite show i'm gonna write a show that\nthat\nallows me to showcase my businesses and\nmyself and then it was like man i don't\nwant to be shooting this real i'm gonna\nwrite a show that i can shoot in a\nstudio\nuh you know where it would take me six\nmonths to shoot 10 episodes of\nfantasy factory and i could shoot 10\nepisodes\nand three days of ridiculousness right\nit's like even sort of the evolution\nand all of it and the fact that you were\nuh this pro skateboarder and all these\nsort of different things\nit's it's a remarkable\nhistory to go along with the foundation\nthat built you\nuh but the the drive\nand the desire and the passion\num is to be known uh for something\ncompletely different\nand it you look back on and say hey oh\nyeah annie used i used to love his shows\ntype of thing you know what i mean\nis is and right now we're in the\ntransition and i would almost\nargue the transition is probably about\nyou know five\nsix years long and it started with\nsort of the evolved thinking that led to\neven doing lewis's\npodcast the first time i've done any\npress and years\ni've had any conversations about it and\nif i've only done\npodcasts basically over these last\ncouple years\nthere's they're again those cornerstones\nof\nthe transition uh that will eventually\nget there but look\nit's also a lot of fun to do yeah mean\nit's still like\nalways amazing funny guests you know\nfrom kevin hart\nto mike tyson to so many different\ninteresting\nindividuals and then you just get on\nstage and\nand you know you feel like you know\nyou're like a rapper or something well\nyou're like controlling free flow\nand moving it you know what i mean like\nit's a it's a really\nremarkable thing to have\nlearned to master\nthat ultimately was something you\ncreated that ends up being a massive\nbusiness because you've built everything\nas a business\nthat also supports even your evolved\nbusiness mind\nand will be another great business story\nas it's related to my production company\nthat produces all the shows and the\nvalue that it's created for me\nabsolutely and it's it's fascinating\nhearing it from me\nbecause i love how much emphasis you\nplace on the transition\nand evolution yeah because often people\nwe're either focused on the end\nor the beginning yeah but the transition\nand the evolution is like the in-between\npiece which is\noften forgotten or we don't want to be\nin yeah because it's harder\nit's harder to be in the transition yeah\nno it's easy to be in the transition\nit's hard to have a conversation about\nthe transition\nright you don't mind right right like\nyou know where it's like\nyou it's one of those things where you\nknow what you're doing\nright you you know how much you're\nevolving and what you're actually\ncreating and what it's going to be it's\nas clear as day\nbut the public still sees you so much\ndifferently\nright and really uh why i really don't\ndo anything but a long-form conversation\nwith\nindividuals that are interested\nin in the depth and willing to to engage\nand want to understand it\nmore because then it's it's laying the\nfoundation of\nlike um articulating\nwhere it's headed the right way yeah you\nknow what i mean yeah yeah because it's\nnot\nit's the which avoids doing like\ntraditional press\nyou know what i mean and for me that's\nreally like\nyou know as uh when it\nwhen probably two years from now then\nuh i'll start uh turning the content\ntowards\nall business creation content\nand evol eventually like showcasing my\ntrue way of thinking\nin real time with every single one of\nthese\nuh ideas and entrepreneurs that i'm\ncreating with\nso then it's like a creates the gravity\nof other great entrepreneurs and minds\nthat are like i want to\nbuild a business with him right because\ni look at it as\nart and science right i don't i put my\nentire system for the world to see on\nhow i build because\ni'm still an architect right it's still\nme\nshaping and and looking at the data and\nusing my system to like\nthink like who the target audience is\nand how can the product line scale and\nwhat's the real messaging and what does\nit stand for where's the real\nopportunity\nlike it's all of that is the art side um\nand it will eventually be\nuh what the loudest version of my voice\nis\nonce the uh this side of it is done but\nit'll still be done in that same\nsensibility\nthat was a pro skateboarder that wrote a\nskit that led to a television show that\nled to five television shows\nand you know hundreds of of episodes and\nyou know 10 plus year run on on mtv\nyou know that same sensibility will now\nbe\nmuch more evolved and and\nthe principles and the sound will be\nmore about living an extraordinary life\nand all the things that i've created\nwere with purpose\nthat all ultimately just level back to\nhappiness\nyeah as opposed to seeking to achieve\nany material or financial\nrecord mark but i still judge myself by\nthat\nbecause it's still uh the ultimate score\ncard as it relates to building a\nbusiness\nif you're listening closely guys rob\nkeeps saying the words\nclear and clarity clear and clarity like\nyou've been repeating them over and over\nagain whichever question we've been into\nyou're obsessed with clarity yeah but\nbut most people struggle with clarity\nbecause we live in an\nunclear world yeah an uncertain world\nhow are you\nso fixated on finding it and how are you\nfinding it i you know i\ni'm again i think it's the most\ndifficult thing to do\nyou know i go back to that another best\nyeah i mean you go back to that design\nbut\ni put an anchor in the ground\nof like like i'm not stopping\ntill it all makes sense and it all\nconnects and\nand the question it was uh\nstop looking at everything separately\nright stop looking at\nhow you want like uh your relationships\nto be how you want\nbusiness to be how you want your free\ntime stop looking at any of it\nseparately and what\nwhat type of life do you want now start\nlooking at\nall the things that are making that life\nproblematic\nand now start learning all the things\nthat you need to learn\nin order to achieve that and then\nover time it refines into this\nit just keeps getting more granular and\nmore granular it starts as a\na messy solar system starts as a\nmessy galaxy and turns into a star into\na solar system\ndown into a molecule down into an atom\ntype of thing you know what i mean it's\nlike\nall the way down to string theory right\nit's like you just keep getting\nmore clarity in all of those defined\naspects but the hardest part is defining\nthose buckets first\nand going through the first couple\nlayers that get you to that point\num to do it and i don't know right\nit's how i think right so it's how my\nmind thinks of everything of like\nlike big picture break it down to here\nand then as you're breaking it down you\nyou break it down even further every\nstep of the way and and you're learning\nmore\nand evolving the path never changes but\nthe strategies and how you actually get\nthere continue to evolve and\nit's i don't know if again that's even\nfully teachable\nright it's it's principle based but\nthere is the art of it\nis the ability to see into those layers\nas they're happening\npause and rebuild when you see\na new layer to add to it right and that\nis a creative strategic right brain left\nbrain\nsort of thing right and and\nwhen i talk about it it some people\nconnect with it\nsome people are like man he's just\ntalking gibberish right because it's so\nhard to like\nfully understand um what it is and i i\nreflect on like my wife's friend went\nand saw me\nlike do an interview at this event and\nshe was like i mean i just don't think\nanybody understood what you were saying\nright and it was like and it was like\nman it's like man she's like\nin like feedback you know and it's it's\nit's because like it's it's an\nevolved way of thinking for an evolved\nperson\nright so it's it's like even a couple\nsteps removed from just like\nyou're 23 years old and you're trying to\nlike figure out like what it's gonna\ntake for you\nuh to to find motivation how am i gonna\nfind my passion these\nbig like these big anchors that without\nyour like\nliterally you have no sail no rudder\nyou're just a no man's land without\nthose right and\nyou know and my way of thinking and\ntalking just\nis never going to support uh helping\nsomebody\nfind motivation or passion right like\nit's only for those that have that have\nthat eternal fire that will never stop\nlike evolving and and and growing and\nand then ultimately\nthese are the tactics that i've uh put\nin place to try to keep\nevolving that to an even higher level\nyeah the reason why i'm loving this\nconversation is because so many people\ntoday uh\nare fixated on for good reason not in a\nbad way fixated on demystifying\neverything\nand as i'm like you know we're always\ntrying to break things down we're trying\nto come up with three steps to this and\nseven steps to this and\nand that's useful like anyone who's\nlistening i come up with\ncontent like that to help you find your\npassion and purpose i get the need for\nit but\nwhat i also loved about this is that\nyou're remystifying it\nright right like like the whole world's\non a demystifier\nand rob's trying to re-mystify it\nbecause there is\na beauty and mysticism there is a beauty\nin\nexploration there is a beauty and\nintellectual curiosity\nyeah and not having everything laid out\nin diagrams like as much as you love\ndata\nyeah which you do like you said right at\nthe beginning you said bill performed a\nbusiness plan with clarity and broke it\ndown like you loved that\nloved it but at the same time you also\nlike experiencing\nthe process of figuring things out yeah\nand and and not having everything as\ntactical yeah and\nlook and i'm i also look at my path\num also it\ni didn't this didn't happen to my late\n30s you know i mean you're talking about\nsomeone that had\ngreat success and done all these\ndifferent things and and\nand still couldn't even though you were\nalways about growth and always tried\nunique things to\nto kind of help evolve your mindset and\nalways get better you know and\nfundamentally i always made this\ncommitment to myself that i'd always be\nbetter\nthe the each following year more than\nthe previous year right\nit still wasn't until there was this\ndeep\ncommitment to mastering life\nright and it's it's the one thing\nthat needn't be mystified because it's a\nit's really what you're hunting and the\nincredible joy of it is i think\nit's going to be in a place that then i\nget to live out\nthe next half of my life in this\nlike life mastery of just\ncomplete bliss uh because it took me\nyou know five to ten years of fully\ncommitting to living the\nthe life that i want to actually go and\ndo it right\nand i think it has a lot to do with my\nage too you know of\nof getting older and and and not just\nwanting success but wanting clarity\nand and seeking uh seeking it on my own\nterms\nright of not letting somebody say hey\nthis is how you should look at life\nreally like what type of life do you\nwant and\nlet's start building it right and and i\nthink anybody can do that at any time\nit's just based off of circumstances\nright it's like i'd already reached a\ncertain level of success that allowed me\nto do that\nright without the the the pain and\nstress of\nof of financial burdens or\nuh some sort of complexities of the\nrelationships in people my life someone\nbeing sick or something you know there's\nall these different factors\nthat could affect the ability to ever\nget there\nthat i was also fortunate enough to\nnever\never come across right which always\nequated it to\nwhen i was younger to having an old soul\nand\ngreat guardian angels right and i just\nbe like man i just\nlike like something is looking over me\nthat keeps allowing me\nto like not catch a an l here\nbecause i'm putting myself in some bad\npositions you know and\nand i i'm\nas i've evolved i simplified it back\nthen and now i just\ni look at it as it's more like you\nactually just have this ability to\nmanage\nuh the world and your universe and your\nintuition to guide you the way like you\nsaid\num and as you've gotten older\nnow you've learned to like ma use it\nuh rather than before it just sort of\nhelped you now you can use it as like a\ntool type\nyeah yeah that that unconscious ability\nbecomes conscious\nright and you're able to say okay before\ni could sense stuff\nbut now i'm gonna actively put into\npractice and action\nright so that i can guide myself and\nnavigate how many people can relate to\nthat\nyeah you know what i'm saying yeah it's\nlike unless it's very hard to\ntry to get somebody to believe in their\nability to manage\ntheir own intuition and and control the\nuncontrollable\nif they've never experienced it it's\nlike my mom's certainly like\ni pray the lord does that for me you\nknow what i mean like\nit's like there's no chance like you\nknow that even\nidea of an evolved way or mastering life\nit doesn't even not even in her mind a\nway of thinking no part of the system no\nanything she's still\ncut from the world of like this is what\nyou're this is how you're supposed to\nlive and i'm gonna live it out\nright like and and that\ni think it this particular era\nthat we're in um what i like to call the\nwellness squad era\nuh where there's so many platforms and\nthis deep\nevolved in especially in this younger\nmillennial world this evolved way of\nthinking of\nlike you can better yourself and\nevolve uh and create your own life\non your terms is a bigger movement\nwe're so close to it that it feels like\nlike\nwe connected with so many people that\nare a part of it but i think we'll look\nback\n10 15 years from now as like the\nbeginning of this much\ndeeper wave and that's a\na part of evolving like even just\nour entire species long term you know\nwhat i mean\nyeah a little bit far but in in that\ndegree of how important this sort of\nzone is of\nwhere it's now normal for everybody\nuh to talk about how they can improve\nthemselves yeah\nwhere before it was like what can i\nlearn\nto get me a job to pay for a life\nthat i can have fun on the weekends\nright like is is\nwhat we're breaking out of you know yeah\nyeah the seeds are being planted right\nnow yeah like you're saying like this\nwave\nit's interesting when you think about it\nhow we'll look back at this wave yeah\nbecause even in the wave there's so many\ndifferent movements but but the point\nyou're making still stands that\nthis is the seeds are being planted yeah\nand i think\nthere's i think all the different\nstyles in the wave are just the\nbeginning\nyeah i think you know 20 30 years from\nnow\nlike it will just be a part of it you\nknow\nthis what you connect with and who you\nconnect with and how\nthey're growing and evolving and you\nbasically piggyback on growing and\nevolving with them yeah\num is is going to be a a major sort of\nthing man\nand i i think everybody that's doing it\nnow\num it will be much bigger on a much\nhigher level\non and be way more mainstream and normal\nlike to me it's almost like underground\nlike hip hop\nyeah and like it's going to be like this\nmuch bigger sort of thing like\nbecause there's real uh effect\nthere's really when you are growing and\nevolving and learning and just\nbeing a better version of yourself it's\nundeniable\nright yeah and and i think uh in this\nin the previous generation you went to\nchurch for that sort of\nuh i idea of where you're going to\nfind a more traditional spirituality if\nyou will and\nand then the other side of it\nuh you know becoming a monk for three\nyears doing all these\nit's too far over here but dead in the\nmiddle there's like now it's just about\nyour own journey and what you actually\nneed to evolve and become a better\nversion\nand then when you start seeing that\noutput\nuh in your relationships and your energy\nin your happiness and all these things\nit's so much more\nquantifiable than\nputting putting small practice into\nsomething that doesn't have an actual\noutput is just my broader theory\ni love it\ni love it man i love hearing it from\nyour perspective because i feel like\nyou've lived through cycles like you\nalready have like just\ni mean you still are you're defining\ncycles too but you live through cycles\nso\ni always get fascinated listening to\nsomeone who's lived through cycles\nand then knows how to look back yeah\nlike i'm still living through\na cycle and then i'll be able to look\nback but you know you've done that\nmultiple times\nand then the hard part is\nlearning looking back being part of it\nand it's like\nman like especially like i almost feel\nlike you\nyou're you're you only have so much\nenergy\nright so sometimes you dedicate a ton of\nenergy to growth\nand make a make like a deep run right\nsometimes\nuh you're in sort of cruise control\nbecause you're you're\nworking on stuff you grew to and then\nyou don't it's like even\neven the pace of it is is super unique\nand i i would almost\nsay that i'm in this like weird sprint\ncycle\nyou know almost like the ray dalio like\nhe does this like sort of\nlike big idea failure big bro it's just\nthese sort of loops that keep going up\nand i can just feel those and\nand again while i go back to like these\npodcasts become these marks\nof like how much different same sort of\nideology\ncore principles but how how they're\nevolving because i\nam in this like just hyper\nuh evolving space where you pick\nsomething you want to involve in and\nthen you\ngo so deep to take a leap forward and\nand now you know imagine then you just\nkeep\nsurrounding yourself even further and\ndeeper with other people that are part\nof that\nthat evolution and that growth and you\njust keep like\ncompounding almost uh your knowledge\nand and the evolution of of the growth\nof um that i think will eventually\nsettle out right because at some point\nyou won't\ni don't think i'll want to commit the\nsame energy to the evolution\nas much as i will want to be able to\nmaximize and enjoy what i would consider\nthe peak of myself but i don't know that\nyeah you know what i mean i don't even i\ncouldn't\nlike wouldn't even imagine you wouldn't\narticulate it at this point so\nyou know who knows what uh 10 years from\nnow will be like\nyeah yeah i've noticed those cycles as\nwell and people have the five that i've\nbroken it down to that i've experienced\nand seen is\nis learn cycles like when you're in a\ncycle way it's all about learning\nit's all about growth it's just\nobserving reflecting and then\nmoving on from that is experimenting and\ntesting it's a cycle that you're in\nwhere you're just\nyou're trying out loads of things\npersonally professionally whatever it is\nyou're just figuring it out you don't\nknow what's going to work\nand then the third one's like performing\nyou get into a bit of a groove and\nyou're like okay\nthis is moving this is happening this is\nyou know you you start seeing patterns\nand you start seeing formulas and you\nstart seeing things add up and then the\nfourth one which we all know which is\nlike\nstruggle yeah like you're in a cycle\nyou're just like you're trying you're\nperforming but\nyou're just you know knocking on a door\nit's not knocking and the fifth one is\nthriving\nlike sometimes you're in a cycle where\nthings are just in flow\nand you're thriving and everyone always\nwants to be and thrive yeah but the\nchallenge is you've got to do\nthe four before and it's continuous yeah\num so\nthose are the ones i've observed no i\nthink i would argue that that's probably\nit to\nto uh to the t okay and then i would say\nit almost like to go back to what i'm\nmy overarching principle there uh or\nstatement is i think my journey\nis to thriving all the time\nright like at some point um\nyou have fully optimized something right\nnow there might be little things that\ncome along that allow it to be better\nbut at certain points you have fully\nuh created something for yourself in my\nsense it would be\na life system and the way of living\nthat now has you at such a level that\neven this\nincoming unpredictable chaos\nis there's a system for how that even\nworks in there to to manage it and how\nit even\nit fully works and and nothing\ncan break through your defense of your\nhappiness\nuh would be living in at a thriving\nlevel right\nand i would almost you know you know we\nthey call it the flow state of when that\nenergy is like yes\nwhen life is effortless yeah right and\nthe only way to stay\neffortless is to make sure so many\naspects of it are under control and\nprotected\nso that nothing can come in and and\ncause the problems that force you\nto get out of that state in order to\ncorrect or\nuh put energy into to fixing\nuh something that you should have been\nable to see coming\nmore or less right like but that's i\nwould say that's the the great goal is\nto like\none day just be in thrive mode yeah and\njust live and thriving forever\nyeah and i can see it i can see it like\neven look i\nknow you probably meditate for like 10\nhours at a time\nyou know and i couldn't even like quiet\nmy mind for a second\nand even since i used like a dome that i\nget in\nand and and meditate in i only listen to\none meditation right and it's a\nthe manifestation uh meditation it's a\nguided 20-minute thing and\ni just think about every\nbit of life of what i want to happen and\nand\nvisualizing it playing it out and it it\nalways\nleads to this incredible happy feeling\nuh in the house that i build and my\nwhole family there and all together\njust having like a super simple moment\nwhether it's watching tv or having\ndinner like it always\nleads to that sort of\nmoment and the feeling in it is the\nfeeling of thriving at a high level\nwhere there's just\nthere's there's very little worry and\nyou are as\nlight as a feather uh living in true\nuh earthly happiness you know man\nyeah you mentioned the earthly happiness\ndo you see a difference in\nin realms and i yeah i look i can't i\ni'm\ni'm i can't call it other than i just\nthink\nthis is when you look at how we've\nevolved and what we understand of\nthe universe as a whole um\nwhere these fleshy sketchy objects that\ncould you know\ni could trip and hit my head and that's\nit this whole thing's like where\nit's you're gone right like and uh so to\nme i i\njust don't even think we have the\nability to even\nuh wrap our heads around how this\nentire system is actually connected and\nfundamentally\nthe the closer we get to it the further\nit gets away because it's not like\nall it is is that much more insane you\nknow i\ni find it you know you know every single\nnight i watch something to do with the\nuniverse before i go to bed\num as i'm falling asleep right just the\nthe scale and what the universe is so\nfascinating to me right and\nand you know this this idea\nthat 100 years ago we\nyou know 500 years ago was like oh shoot\nwe're not the center of the universe the\nsun is right then\n100 years ago i was like man we're not\nin\na galaxy we're in one of billions of\ngalaxies and guess what they're all like\ngoing away from each other like um\nthat means uh you know and we can look\nback and see that oh my gosh this whole\nthing started 14 billion years ago now\nwe know how long and what this entire\ntrip like\nlike we are never\ngoing to ever get to a place that can\nanswer any fundamental\nquestion through science that will ever\nequate to our consciousness right we\njust won't there's no\ndad nothing's ever going to happen and\nthen we'll never\nwe can land on the big bang but all we\nland on is\nwell what happened before that yeah\nright like you got nowhere to go like\nwe that's the only that's our only\nquestion\nour question is oh is it real like oh\nwe're not real then none of this is real\nlike there's there's no way you could\npossibly put any level of\ninto intellect and self-conversation and\nfigure anything out\nbut what is fundamentally true\nis you're it's all you know at the\nbottom that we're just\nbits of energy that are fully connected\nthrough this giant wave of energy right\nand\nwhat what the what does that ultimately\nmean\nuh from a long-term spiritual aspect i'm\nit's it's hard to lock in\nnecessarily on on something for me\npersonally\nbut but i certainly connect with the\nidea that\nit's part of what allows you\nto use your intuition and deep clarity\nand all these different aspects\nto attract and have things that actually\nevolve in the real world that you get to\nexperience and actually live\nyou know what i mean i think beyond that\nit's it's just\nuh i don't have an answer or even\ndon't have the time for the question\nyeah that would ultimately\num benefit me because i would keep\nhitting the same roadblock on the\nfundamentals\nyou know no it's great in your thoughts\nman i'm really glad when you talked\nabout your meditation your visualization\nyou talked about seeing your family i\nwanted to talk to you a bit about your\nfamily we were talking about your\nson earlier uh and i thought i what i\nadmire about you is when i look at your\nlife from the outside\nin because i'm looking at it from the\noutside uh\nit's it's beautiful that your family has\nbeen such a great focus for you\nyeah and and is so meaningful to you and\nyou know i i read this i picked this out\nfrom\ni went into your your wife's instagram\nprofile\nyeah i was looking at some of her long\ncaptions she writes great captions\nyour wife writes awesome captions but in\none of them she wrote this she said\nshe said that you started talking about\nmarriage and kids on your first date\nwith your now wife right i wanted to ask\nyou how did that strategy pan out and do\nyou recommend it\nlook i'm i\nknew i was gonna marry her from the\ninstant right\nand i felt my whole life\ni would know instantly as well that's\nhow much\na deep believer in true\nlove uh that i i just never wavered on\nright and there were times where i\nthought like ah\nlike like am i being unrealistic\nbut i i steadfast to it and\num not i would\ngo back to that uh unrelatable\nstory again right where it's like when i\ntell the love story with my wife\nand how insane it is that like i always\nfelt like i was connected to hawaii and\nthen\nher and families from the same small\ntown in ohio i'm from and it's like what\nand then like\nlike then to find out that she swam with\ndolphins from uh because she was a\nmake-a-wish\nchild and had six months to live in\nhawaii and then decided she was\ngoing to let herself live like it was\nlike the moment she told that story i\nwas like instantaneously this is my wife\nand then the actual path to marriage\nto children and the actual relationship\nthat we have\ni couldn't even fathom that a\nrelationship like this\nwas possible that it\n[Music]\nultimately is the cornerstone of what\nshifted my mind\nfrom looking at all these different\nthings and know what does forever look\nlike this is\nthis is now us and our universe forever\nand um it's the purest\nrealest love like this deeply\nlike unwavering zero\nquestion zero doubt zero like\nit's so deeply meant to be\nand pure\nit feels unrealistic to sharing it with\npeople\nyou know i mean i go back to that like\noh of course you do you know\nof course you like that unrelatable\nright like\nre-mystifying wrong like this is not\nlike here's rob like with this\nanother thing of just like oh you know\nit's i love it\nwhen it piles up in again\nit's why it puts me in this like weird\nway when\nwhen i talk about a net level but it it\nit is this deep unknown\nright that is the only reason i was\nable to evolve to this to this place you\nknow and\nand that um you know even to her she\njust will never fully like you know i\ntell her all the time would never like\nyou know i\ni live in a world where i get\noverwhelmed with happiness\ni'm like in the kitchen i'll be like i'm\nso happy\nright like i get like why like i just i\njust\nlove my life like i get over what deeply\noverwhelmed with it\nand i always tell her it's like i would\ni would never have\nhad the ability to get here without you\nand ah that's not true\nthat's not true you know what i mean\nlike no it really\nis would be impossible because i do\nbelieve\nto to to get to that level that you do\nneed\na a partner and need to be connected at\na deep\nlevel uh to create your own universe\ntogether i think it's just essential you\nknow and\nand um\nbut not necessarily i guess i think\nin experience of so many people i know\ni don't hear very many people talk the\nway that i talk\nuh uh about their wife uh\nthat they've been together for for years\nand have children with\nyou know what i mean so and and look and\nthe beauty of it is i'm\nthankful you know i mean like like what\na what a\nwhat an incredible thing but then\nbest believe our children feel that\nenergy\nin the realist way right it's like\nthere's\nno you can just see in how they're\nevolving and what they are that they are\nfrom this\ndeeply happy home of love and like there\nis\nno the confidence in the way that they\ntalk and think and who\nthey are already at at one and two\nand and how happy they are um\nis because they don't know an\nenvironment that's\nthat's any other way right and it's\nnever wavered you know it's like i have\nvery rarely never\nbeen singing my son awake and my\ndaughter awake\nfirst thing when they get up you know\nwhat i mean and very rarely do i not\nput them to bed you know and and i think\nthat that\nsort of aspect is going to create\nlong-term stability for\nthem just finding their own happiness\nright because i don't ever want to like\nfor like make your own decision if you\nend up being like\nunmotivated because we live in this\ncastle and like\ndad's super cool and he's like whatever\nif you don't want to go to school let's\nlet's let's go to hawaii like you know i\ndon't um have any preconceived\nlike thoughts on on how they'll evolve\nit's really like\nfunny to see my one-year-old daughter\nhow she has this raspy laugh\nand just laughs non-stop at everything\nand how\nhappy she is like how cool my\ntwo-year-old is who was born cool\nwho just never wanted to be held like\nwho even this morning\ndon't kiss his dad i'm gonna kiss you\nlike and like how you're\nlike seeing um them\nalready shaping into who they're there\nand and who they're going to be and i\nwant to be\nresponsible for it but i just know i'm\nnot\nright like i you just don't have like\nlike i know\nwe're giving you a great base and this\nsolid foundation but\nthat you the soul that's in you is\nthe person that is in you uh is not\nbeing created day to day here that that\nis\nyou were born this way you know what i\nmean and it's a it's\nan incredible um process to\nto watch come alive and i think even\ngoing back to where we were speaking\nearlier and you're like when does a kid\nwalk like at five\nyeah right like was it like two three\nand i'm like no\none it's like i i had so many like\nmisconceptions about children and i'm\nlike what like the whole process has\nbeen like i feel like i've known so many\npeople\ni've never heard this like this is how\nthis stuff works\nlike it is truly one of those things\nthat\nthat you just never fully understand\nuntil you start living it and and really\ni think it\nit really evolves when\nyou the personality evolves and now\nyou're communicating and\ntwo-year-olds telling you jokes and\ntrying to manipulate you\nand like you know uh\nsaying let's watch football you want to\nwatch football and i'm like okay\nand we sit down on the couch and he's\nlike toy story and i'm like what like he\njust tricked me\nbecause like he knows that i love to\nwatch football and got me on the couch\nwatch football and then like then then\nwhen i'm like we're watching football\nthen he cries\nand the toys and it's like okay god you\ngot me\nyou know what i mean you're sitting in\nthe original you know we're watching toy\nstory right like\nbut i'm just so impressed that how can\nyou be this young and trick me like that\nyou know what i mean like it's it's your\nson yeah it's like it gets it from you\nor the mug\nand it's like the beauty of like\nas he's evolving and it's like man you\nreally are like\nit's that much more endearing and so\nsweet when\nlike it feels like a little version of\nyou you know being funny being a smart\nass\nlike acting all cool like it's like it\nit's uh incredibly endearing\nand again you know for me\nyou know part of our plan is five\nchildren and\nand and i want to evolve\nyou know i explained to my main\nexecutive like look my long-term goal\nhere is not to work more\nlike it's why i'm i'm very careful with\nhow we set up all of these businesses\nand how\nuh what my responsibilities are uh\nat all stages and long term i wanted to\nhave the ability to\nto peel that back and including working\na lot more from home long term\nin order to be around my children as\nthey get older as\ni get older\nand want to spend more time with them\nand again designing that out\nahead of time you know\nso that that's not something i've got to\ngo and do one day\nit's part of like what what the current\npathway is\nnow and everybody's expectations are\nmanaged against that including my own\ndecision making\nso that i don't ever end up committing\nto something that might disrupt that or\never\ntake away from me because the beauty of\nthe setup now is since i don't operate\nanything\ni go to the thrill of creation and\nadvise\ni could literally not talk to one anyone\never again\nand however it plays out it plays out\nlike it's not\nit i'm not an essential moving piece in\nany of them\nwhich gives me then again that ultimate\nfreedom right and then even how i\ntreat and what how i run money and look\nat money based off of the life that i\nwant to live is then\nbuilt into this entire system so then i\ndon't even ever have to even think about\nthat again like\nall of it is is built\naround you making the decisions\nat at all times on on where\nyou want to put your energy and why you\nwant to put it there\nnever being dragged into something or\nbeing forced to do something which i\nwould\nto me is ultimately what you work so\nhard for\nand and adds to success happiness in the\nbalance\nof what i think leads to an\nextraordinary life mm-hmm\nthat's beautiful man yeah it's so good\nhearing that yeah i\ni can definitely say that my wife and i\nwere pretty much the same where we\ndecided we practically like\nwent from date one to saying i like you\nto saying i love you on date two and\nwhen\nwe were going to get married yeah it was\nit was an incredible\nconnection that we felt immediately and\nand we were just certain we were sure\nthat we were going to get married it was\njust going to happen\nand we've been you know we've been\ntogether for like just over five years\nnow\nor total married for two years we\nhaven't got kids yet so excited about\nthat as well\nand when do you what what what's your uh\nuh what's that like five years from now\nlike what's your\nfor kids yeah um no in the next couple\nof years yeah\nyeah sooner rather than later sooner\nrather than later\nthat that's a wild ride yeah i'm excited\nfor it i can come\nthere's nothing as it's nothing quite as\nbeautiful as\nbeing deeply in love with someone and\nwhat's the ultimate thing\nthat you can can do is create a life\ntogether\nthat's like god it's like it's both of\nus yeah and it's\nremarkable you know when they don't want\nto talk to either of you it's like\nit's so cute it's just like you this is\nhow you are yeah\nlike it's that like yeah it's a\nbeautiful thing yeah\nno we're excited we're excited we'll\nhave to come take uh classes from you\nand\nyeah get a night nurse\nyeah no i love that man that's awesome\nbro it's been incredible talking to you\ni end every interview with\nmy final five questions five rapid fires\nuh final five minutes so these are yours\nrob my first question for you\nis you said that you have an\nunquenchable desire to live life\nto the fullest yeah how is that\nhappening today\nlook i i think to today when i say it\nuh it has a lot more to do with with\nthe passions that i have for creating\nand\nand designing and living out this\nextraordinary life\nyou know i think it's uh affords me\nto to continue to go on incredible\nadventures\nuh while uh still being married and\nhaving children and\nand still working\nso hard every single day and achieving\nstuff i never thought was possible\nuh inside the the framework of\nof balance and and happiness right so\num to me that is the fullest\nright where where you get uh\nyou're maximizing the output that you're\ngetting that\nleads to again the life you want to lead\nand and the legacy you want to leave\nleave behind you know and\nand built on a foundation of\nof doing incredible stunts and multiple\ntelevision shows and all these bigger\nthan life things that\none would have been a dream to have let\nalone uh so many different ones you know\nyeah\nthat's beautiful man second one pro you\nsay progression is the key\nto happiness yeah define that for us\nlook i think it's it's pretty binary man\nlike\nit's it's you're either\ndead stopped and you're fully depressed\nor you're\nmoving forward and you're hopeful right\nand if you're moving backwards\nyou're in you're in no man's land right\ni think it is\nyou got two directions to go right and\nand to me as long as you\nare consistently moving forward and\nevolving on\non and that's all aspects that's\nrelationships that's business\nthat's uh health that's wealth that's\nliterally all of the core\nprinciples that you need to be fulfilled\nthey have to constantly be evolving and\ngrowing in\nin order to for you to feel the\nfulfillment that you\nthat you're achieving right because\nwithout it\nyou you question everything like the if\nyou start to roll back\nyou now you spend all your energy not\nnot pushing things forward and using\nthat momentum you spend all your energy\non questioning and doubting and like\ngetting into no man's land and\nand i just think if if people just\nfocused on that um that it would\neliminate\nso many different things that are play a\npart in\ndragging them down and forcing them into\ndoubt\nyou know absolutely great answer man\nnumber three\nuh what do you do when life doesn't go\nyour way or not as you planned\nyou know i i think it's a\nyou know like a pizza bender you know\nwhat i mean maybe like\nmaybe i'll go get chick-fil-a man like\nuh you know i'll binge eat some sweet\ntarts\nuh you know but i i think it's\ninevitable that you get hammered by\nstuff\nit's why um\nit's it's so important for me to build a\nworld that's built to withstand it\nand i think for me at this point um\nit's the deep faith uh of your\nyou gotta weather it right it's that\ndeep faith of like\nand and knowing that like this is a\nmoment in time\nuh and and you know one of the beauties\nof having so many different things\nuh going on that give you energy\neven one big one that rips you apart you\ncan get pulled out of it real quick by\nhaving other ones\nthat are moving at another speed i think\nthat's a\nanother piece of my\nsystem that really avoids ever getting\ngetting torn down there but ultimately\nit is you know it's cliche but it is\nit's a moment in time and as long as you\none foot in front of the other\nis going to get you out of it and past\nit and and wherever you're headed you\nknow\nnice man you told us fourth one one away\nyou told us what you do just before you\ngo to bed what do you do when you wake\nup\nfirst thing you do i mean i i went to\nthis\num the great doctor george pratt who\nhypnotized me for success when i was 25\nyears old he wrote a book called hyper\nsuccess but\nhe he taught me this breathing technique\nright that's just crossing your legs and\narm and\nand rolling up like this and doing this\nbreathing stuff but i\njust for some reason i just\nroll into it alarm goes off at\nfive in the morning i roll into it and\nthen just immediately give thanks\nright like just like and and it always\nand it's not practice it's pure it's\nlike your wife\nyou're chilling the healthy children the\nlife like this morning i just said\nyou know just had some extraordinary\nuncontrollable unexplainable\nexplosions of success that i could have\nnever like even imagined over the last\nlast week and i just said i'm like\nthrough all the healthy\nfamily a beautiful wife and family and\nand their health\nand just this position that i've put\nmyself\nin for these incredible things to happen\nright and\nit's it's\nit starts my day but but keep in mind\nlike that's a\nbible one and then i brush my teeth and\ni get in that dome\nevery single day unwavering and\nit is that even if you got because\nsometimes you'll have\nlayers of things on you like but you\npractice gratitude and then get in a\nmanifestation\nuh egg you start every day like\nas crystal clear like and\nfilled with almost no doubt on anything\nthat you're\nuh doing on it on a daily basis right\nit's in\nin a practice that i don't know is\nrealistic for most people most people\nare like man five in the morning\nyeah like i can't do it you know and\nit's like um\nespecially going straight into\nmeditation straight up at five in the\nmorning but again that's what you know\nit's an a\nwith like lights and like sounds so it's\nlike you feel like you're like floating\nin space\nbut um it's it's been the most\nsignificant thing i've done over the\nlast year\nthat has just put me in this much deeper\nelevated\nmindset that allows there\nto be very little days that um\nyou're even like bothered by anything\nright it's it's pretty\npretty remarkable now again that's just\noptimizing what's already a a\nsignificantly\noptimized system right i mean like if\nyou have like a crazy chaotic life\nand you get up and say so grateful for\neverything you jump in the dome like\nyou get out and yeah it's chaos right\nlike\nit's not going to uh save your life it\nis the\nhigher level for an already deeply\noptimized individual but\nat that stage you begin to see you can\nfeel changes or nuance right and you\nsee uh how things evolve and really even\nyou know the joke at my office is like\nsomething crazy will\nhappen it'll be like did you did you\nthink about that in the dome today yeah\nlike it will be\non that level i need to check out this\ndough man\nand fifth and final question what's your\nwords of wisdom for me\nas someone who's a member of the\nwellness squad\nwords of wisdom guidance yeah for me uh\nlook i i i think as someone who i think\nis deeply passionate\nabout um ultimately\nhelping others\nthat it's defining\nwhat your personal value proposition\nwill be\ninside this world long term that has the\nability\nuh to serve a purpose uh\nthat can be shared by many people that\nsay hey you need to\nif this is where you're at you need to\nlisten to jay for this the more defined\nand clear\nyour personal value proposition is uh\nover time um and what you ultimately\nbecome specifically known for\nuh will turn into the mastery and\ngreatness that i think you ultimately\nseek\nyou know what i mean i love that man\nthank you so much look i mean there's a\nlittle\ngetting a little taken trying to build\nsome brands out here trying to build\nsome brands out here\nthank you man i'm so grateful rob for\nyou coming on i think we learned so much\nabout you i love the fact that you were\nopen enough to admit that actually some\nthings are just mystical they are\nblessed\nto be that way and it's beautiful to\ndiscuss it in that way i think it's\nwe live in such a world that always\nwants to break things down sometimes\nit's nice to just see them as they are\nso\nthank you for opening up about your\nphilosophies your beliefs a bit on\nbusiness we snuck that in there too\nand your relationship thank you so much\nfor sharing yourself man i really really\nappreciate it\nlove it so great really enjoyed it thank\nyou awesome thank you\nif you want even more videos just like\nthis one make sure you subscribe
