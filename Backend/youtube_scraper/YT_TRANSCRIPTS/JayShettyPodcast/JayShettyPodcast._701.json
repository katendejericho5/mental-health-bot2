    "transcript": "because yeah usually when we're\nlistening we're\nactually talking in our head about what\nthe other person is saying\nand we're listening to our voice that\ncommentary as opposed to their voice\nso when you can really listen in that\ndeep way it's\nit's a real gift to give to someone else\ni believe the world needs a new set of\nreal\nmodels people who live with deep\nintentions behind their actions\nand this is the podcast where you get to\nmeet them hear from them\nand hear me ask them questions about\nlife the universe\nthen you work and everything in between\ntoday i'm super excited to have with me\nmike posner\nan american grammy-nominated singer\nsongwriter\npoet producer and podcaster\nmike it's great to have you here thanks\nfor having me man thanks for being here\nand i'm really grateful i want you to\nknow that i really am grateful that we\nconnected recently\nand i really appreciate you being here\nman you got it i'm grateful we connected\nalso\nyeah yeah i've seen your videos before\nsomebody there's the guy\nman i was listening to your music for a\nlong time before too so\nyeah that's kind of cool man that's cool\nand and it was nice because i remember\ntom who connected us\nhe he was he was like you guys are both\nyou both have three billion views you\nshould connect\nand i was just like i think there's a\nlot of other reasons we should connect\nto but uh\nyeah yeah man i wanted to start off by\njust saying you've been a longtime fan\nof your work and your music\nso the fact that you let me listen to\nyour album before this\ni really appreciate it and so thank you\nso much for doing that\nbut i want to start off by we were on a\ncall i think about two three weeks ago\nand you were in a bookstore which books\ndid you end up buying\nare any of the money good i ended up\nbuying\na gentleman in moscow okay i just\nfinished that\nyeah it was really good okay what was\nthat about it's a novel about\nuh it's fiction about a guy in um\nthe ussr in like the 20s and 30s and\nhe basically is sentenced to live the\nrest of his life in this one hotel\nand it's a nice hotel but he's not\nallowed to leave it ever again\nand he gets into all these different\nthings and looks and\nyou know story takes turns and people\ncome and leave and\nuh it was really fun it was really good\nreally good book and then i bought\nuh the stranger by camu\nthat i started yesterday because i just\nfinished the gentleman in moscow\nand i haven't been like i'm not all the\nway in yet\nokay but we'll see okay yeah so i just\nstarted that\nand then i bought um brian wilson from\nthe beach boys\nhe has a autobiography i bought that\nand then i think i bought some that's\nwhy i bought three\nyou read a lot yeah i have been this\nyear\nthis year this is probably the most i've\never maybe read like 20 books this year\nwow it's like the most for me but yeah\nmarine life that's a lot in a yeah yeah\nwhat's been the best one what's been the\nhighlight standout one\nhonestly uh i read the uh the power now\nby eckhart tolle which was a book i\navoided for a long time because it's\nit's popular you know everyone's oprah\neckhart the power of now\nand i thought if it's popular it's not\ncool that's why i\nyou know foolishly out i always wanted\nto be like find some like\nsecret exactly so i never read it for\nyears and years and years\nand i finally read it i was like oh it's\npopular for a reason it's good man\ni read that book like four or five times\nthis year\nyeah and we were just looking through my\nshelf and you said you'd read the\nbhagavad-gita\nyes yes when did you read that what do\nyou think of it i read that\nactually when i was visiting india for\nthe first time\nuh the only time so far that was\na year and a half ago i remember just\ngetting like\nhigh reading that book you know was like\na like a physical experience reading it\nwas really\nsomething else yeah was the first time\nyou read it\nthe first time i read it i was 16 years\nold so\ni read it that time and at that time it\nwas very philosophical for me\nreally powerful for getting through some\nthings i got through at 16.\nthen i read it again at 18 then i read\nit again at 21\nand then when i became a monk i studied\nand taught that book for three years\nfull time\nso it became a huge part of my life and\neven now when i'm working on writing my\nown book\ni'm taking a lot of principles from the\nbhagavad-gita and making them relevant\nand accessible\nactually the power of now has so many\nroots in chapter 14 of the bhagavad-gita\nit's chapter 14. chapter 14 is all about\nthe modes\nof material nature a mode that makes you\nfocus on the past a mode that makes you\nfocus on the future and the mode that\nbrings you in the present\nand so chapter 14 of the bhagavad-gita\nreally goes deeply\ninto the different modes that we operate\nin i mean we do two hours just on the\ngita man\nyou tell me stuff like that we could\nthat's what we're going to say for our\ntime\nyeah did you ever have this experience\nlike i remember being\ni don't what city i was going to but i\nwas in india on a plane i was reading it\ni remember just feeling like the the\nveil had been lifted like all this\nweight came off and i was like goofy\nsmile i'm like i feel like i took drugs\njust from this book man\ndid you ever have something like yeah\nfor sure for sure that that\nspiritual knowledge can be intoxicating\nin a good way in a good way it's almost\nlike\ndetoxifying but in the process of that\nit feels like you get intoxicated first\nand then it's ripped away\nright yeah spiritual knowledge does\nspiritual knowledge is described a\nfeeling like a consciousness shower\nlike bathing the consciousness cleansing\nand healing and letting go of\nall of the other things all the toxins\nall the negative beliefs all of the\nthings that we've been\nholding on to for so long all the false\nidentities are\nstripped away we almost get to see\nourselves face to face after\nsuch a long time when we strip away and\nlet go of all our false designations and\nroles that we've been playing and what\ndo you do like\nwait who's podcast i know i know i just\ngot a question for you though i got a\nquestion for you\nit's like i don't know if it's like this\nfor you but for me\ni will have the like that was one of\nthem on the plane i'll have these like\nflashes of very high moments\nhigh is like the best way i can explain\nwhere it feels like\ni've heard the word satori is this do\nyou know this words like\na flash of enlightenment yeah and\nwhat do you do with that after is like\nis that am i supposed to always feel\nlike that because it's almost like\nit ends yeah right it's like i had that\nmoment on the plane but at some point\nthat moment ended\nyeah and i went back to a more\nnormal or default state and then you\nkind of like like the default state less\nbecause you experience this other thing\nthat's beautifully explained man\nyeah it's true it's true so what it's\nexplained as\nin the vedic literatures is shadow\nexperiences\nso a good example is when you're touring\nlet's say i came with you\ni would get to experience everything\nlike i was mike i'd get to be in your\nvip space if you took me as a friend i'd\nget to be\nin your zone i'd get to see things from\nyour perspective\nbut i'm not mike i'm just experiencing\nthe shadow\nof experiencing it through you and in\nspiritual\ntraditions whether we're with an\nincredible teacher or a guru or\nwith a book that energy kind of is\ninfectious and spills over onto us\nand we get that high and then what we\nneed to do is unpack it so that we can\nlive that high continuously every single\nday\nand what often happens with epiphanies\nor these moments is that we don't\nunpack them we just let them be one-off\nexperiences but you can\nfeel like that every single day if we\nchoose to unpack\nand learn through that process of almost\nreverse engineering like\nwhat was that moment trying to teach me\nwhat did i really gain from it\nlike why did that happen at that state\nwhat was i doing right\nand then you can feel that way again but\nit's also scary though\ngo on this is this is the reason it's\nscary it's because\nif you're right this is a\nwhat you should spend your life doing\nbut if you're wrong if\nif you can't feel that every day if\nthat's not possible\nthis is a good way to waste your life\nand\nnot only that you'd like um could very\neasily slip into\nhating normalcy because you've\nexperienced this flash and you think\nsomething's wrong with not being there\nall the time\nand this is i struggle with this because\ni go oh yeah well let me unpack it and\ndo this work to get there and i can feel\nlike that every day\nbut then part of me is like what what if\nthey're what if you can't really feel\nlike that\nwhat if this is what it's supposed to be\nlike now\nyou know or just make peace with this\nyeah\nwell what yeah and i think it's both i\nthink it is both\ni think having that flash the fact that\nyou've had that experience\nis proof to you that there is more\nyes it's proof to you that there is a\ngreater purpose beyond our existence\nthere is greater meaning\nthere is greater fulfillment and right\nnow you're totally right our current\nstate is this\nso if we don't make peace with this if\nwe don't accept this if we don't learn\nto\nnavigate this and constantly live in the\nchasing mindset\nthen yeah we're gonna we're gonna feel\ndepressed every single day\nso that's what i was just saying earlier\nthat the\nprocess and the destination are the same\nit shouldn't be seen as separate we see\nthe epiphany as the destination or a\nmilestone when actually\nthe process on a daily basis itself can\nbe rewarding\nyou know yeah it's like the creation of\nthe song and the song\nyou can't really strip them away from\neach other right correct\ncorrect we went right for it huh yeah\nwe're like five minutes in\ni know i love it it's great it's great\nman this is what makes\nthis hit the ground it's so beautiful\nyeah i love it you start interviewing me\nthough\nyou're you're the one with all the\ninsights this is a\nyeah this is a because i struggle with\nthis yes\nthis up and down you know and\nyou know i'll go on retreat or something\nor spend some time like\nless this summer i spent some time in\nsolitude at\nthe monastery for like 12 days and it go\nreally high\nand you come back in life and i get\ntripped up you know\na fight with my sister or something you\nknow and\nand it's like party wants to go back to\nthe\nmonastery where you could like control\neverything but this is in life\nyou know always and and and that's the\nbiggest thing\nyeah dealing and that's the beauty of it\nthat when you come back\ninto reality you get an opportunity to\nlearn how to navigate it taking that\ninformation taking that insight\ntaking those experiences from the\nmonastery wherever you're taking them\nfrom\nand then getting them to play out in\nlife that's part of the\nthat's part of the experience i know\nthat when i left being a monk\ni actually feel i've had more\nreflections in realization since\nleaving because i've had to put into\npractice everything i learned\nthan when i was a monk because when i\nwas a monk it was protected it was\nit was harder after i presume it was\nharder initially\nit was harder initially yes it was\nharder but then it became\nmore fulfilling because i\nreally had to dig deep i really had to\nrethink\nand i had to approach everything with\nthe new fresh set of eyes and\nexperiences\nso it's actually become more meaningful\nyeah i could\ni'm not there no no no it's a daily\nprocess i'm not there either man this is\nlike so\nwhere i was on right i told you i was on\nthis retreat spent like\n12 days alone i was like all the way\nalone in this little cabin on this\nmonastery\nyou know they drop the food off once a\nweek in like a box you know and you pick\nso you don't see anyone for a whole week\nyou know i'm like meditating five to\nseven hours a day and\nafter like a week or so\ni got to like i'll get to this point\nwhere\ni would my mind got quiet\nquiet her you know where you know\nusually i look at a flower and my brain\ngoes so this is a rose is the last time\ni saw a rose\nthis one isn't quite as pretty talking\ntalking talking and\na few times on this retreat i got to a\npoint where i would hear\na bird song like a quiet mind\nand it's just like cripplingly beautiful\nlike i would start crying you know or\nsee the moon without my mind saying\nanything and like\nit just you can't even explain how\nbeautiful it is\nso then it's like okay i want to go home\nand like\ndo that with people too it's like\nlistening but i i can't do it\ni like it when i talk with someone my\nbrain is going all the time so it's like\nyes like this\nintegration yeah you know and it's\nnatural because that\nspace is carrying that energy\nbecause people for decades i don't know\nabout the particular monastery you went\nto but\npeople for decades have been practicing\nhigher levels of consciousness\nalternate levels of consciousness in\nthat space\nso that's carried i always say that\nlocation has\nenergy and time has memory so the\nlocation has energy and time has memory\nso that location is carrying that energy\nand the time that you spend there is\ncarrying that memory with you so now\nwhat it's about is\nbeing able to recreate that outside of\nthat physical space because if it is an\naltered state of consciousness you can\ncarry it with you\nand create that state in your space\nbecause it's not bound by physical\nboundaries correct so correct so it\ntakes time and i'm practicing a daily\ntoo like don't don't get me wrong i'm\nnot coming it\nas a point of being an expert at all i'm\ncoming from uh\nalways trying to create the state i want\nto be in\nyeah not accepting the state that is\ngiven to me\nyeah yeah it's a it's a real gift if you\ncan listen to someone that way\nwith a quiet mind because yeah usually\nwhen\nwe're listening we're actually talking\nin our head about\nwhat the other person is saying and\nwe're listening to our voice\nthat commentary as opposed to their\nvoice so\nwhen you can really listen in that deep\nway it's\nit's a real gift to give to someone else\nit's difficult to do\nthat's why it's such a gift because it's\nrare you know yeah\ni did it once with my mom i was like\nmeditating and she walked in and i was\nlike\nit felt so good because i could\nrecognize the things that like\nusually would trip me up and i would get\nupset\nor judge her about and was just really\nlistening to what she was trying to say\nbehind the words even you know it's like\nthis beautiful moment\nyou know did she feel different as well\ni don't know okay\nit's so hard to tell i've had both these\nexperiences where\ni've like been in one of these like\nflashes\nthere was once in hawaii i was just i\nwas with a friend of mine and\nwe were it was like it was one of those\nmoments\nyou know we weren't even talking and\njust looking out over like this cliff\nis beautiful and i remember i was like\nthis and we gave each other a hug\nand then later the day he was like man\nsomething crazy happened when we\nwe hugged right there i felt this he\nfelt something\nand i thought oh when i feel something\nmaybe other people are too\nanother time i was with the i was with\nmy\nuh my girlfriend at the time\nand i just meditated one day and i'm\nlike feeling like\nhigh i'm like loopy at all riding in the\ncar\nand and i was being quite i was very\nquiet because i was like having this\nexperience\ninternally and then later i talked to\nher by like two days later\nshe was like yeah i i thought you were\nreally mad at me and i was like\nshe was in a different place she wasn't\nhigh with me so i never know\nexactly what other people are feeling i\nused to think i could\ni used to think oh they're feeling what\ni'm feeling always but\ni don't think so no not all the time\nit's harder yeah yeah\nit's hard is hard and i think that's the\nchallenge that we have that\nwhen we've had a moment and experience\nour mind forces us to want to relive\nthat experience\nrather than have a powerful new one and\nthe pain actually comes from always\ngoing to go\nback to where we were forward to where\nwe can\nyeah yeah yeah absolutely and that's\nthat's actually where the pain comes\nfrom\nthe pain comes from wanting to have the\nsame experience not believing that there\nis one that can\nsupersede that again in the future\nand also it it's impossible to have an\nexperience twice\ntotally 100 just you can't even do it\nyeah and it's just the trick of the mind\nyeah my mind's always doing this\nit's the trick of the mind that's\nconstantly trying to yeah whatever it is\nnot just spiritual experiences any\nexperience\neven if it's a material experience your\nmind is tricking you to want to recreate\nit again and again and again\nso we keep coming up with new ways of\nhaving the same experience\nso here's a here's a good question for\nyou\ni'm sorry i just care i'm just so\ncurious i know you're supposed to ask me\nquestions i've got so many good\nquestions anyway god this is fun\nthis seems to me to be like two kinds of\nteachers nowadays when i think of like\ncontemporary spiritual teachers\nthere's one school that says you can\ntrain your mind to think\nbetter thoughts think more positively\nget rid of like negative\nstories or limiting beliefs etc can\njournal and meditate these things and\ncleanse the mind make the mind more\nhealthy\nthat's what school won and then there's\nanother school\ni feel like that says nope\nthe mind is inherently dirty and what\nyou need to do is recognize that you're\nnot your mind\nand maybe it's both of those things i\ndon't know together but they seem to\ni i have trouble because i\ni feel like i have a toe here and a toe\nthere\nyou know what i mean it's tough because\none day i'll be like\ni'll notice myself thinking negative\nthoughts and i think oh i need to stop\ndoing that\nor do i just need to recognize that's\nwhat minds do\nyeah i don't know that's great that's an\nawesome question man i'm so glad\nthis is a brilliant question so i look\nat it from the point of the vedas or the\nbhagavad-gita and that tradition that\nschool of thought because\nthat school of thought has given me in\nmy research of stoicism\nand my research of all alternative ways\nof thinking i found a lot of good\nanswers there\nso the principle is suggested is this\nthat\nthe mind its function is to desire\nand want and and and will\nright that's the that's the function of\nthe mind what's often missed out in any\nof these schools of thought\nis the position of the intelligence so\nthe mind is compared to a child\nand the intelligence is compared to an\nadult and so we are not the mind\ndefinitely that's for sure we are not\nthe mind we are consciousness beyond the\nmind\nbut there is an interaction with every\nthought between the mind and the\nintelligence\nso for example i'll paint a paint a\npicture because it's easier\nlet's say you've decided that you want\nto go on a diet right let's say you've\ndecided you want to go on a diet you\nwant to eat healthy stuff\nthe mind sees a chocolate fudge cake i'm\npicking that because i love chocolate\nfudge cakes so the mind sees a chocolate\nfudge cake and the mind goes i want that\nright now\ni need to have that like i need that\nchocolate fudge cake\nand and you think the chocolate fudge\ncake is looking at you saying eat me\nright like you think that and so the\nmind's having this whole conversation\nthe mind thinks back to every time it's\nhad chocolate fudge cake and how happy\nit feels when it has that\nand you're thinking i need to have this\nfudge cake i need it then\nit's the role of the intelligence based\non how much you've strengthened your\nintelligence\nyour intelligence will say to the mind\nno we want to eat healthy\nwe want to be healthy we're going to\nsave that for cheat day\nbut if your intelligence is weak your\nintelligence just falls over and goes\nokay let's just have the\nyou know and so that's actually the\ninteraction that's happening daily in\nour minds when we wake up in the morning\nyour mind says i want to go to sleep\nyour intelligence says i want to wake\nup.\ndepending on how much whichever one\nyou've been feeding whichever one you've\nbeen strengthening that's the one that\nwins inside of you every single day\nso that's one other school of thought to\nadd how would you\nhow would you one part of me goes well\nis intelligence just another part of the\nmind\nyeah it's it's it's the more mature\nadult functioning part\nbut even that is not really us it's not\nit's it's our ability to be able to use\nit to\nsteer our life in a certain way so the\nthe analogy that's given is of the\ndriver in a car\nlike when you have a car accident\nsometimes we're like oh that car hit me\nthe car didn't hit you it hit the car so\nthe car's like the body\nright the intelligence is like the\nengine and the the system that you're\nusing\nthe steering wheel is like the\nintelligence and then you\nthe driver of the consciousness so each\npart of it is separate\nbut you're using a different element of\nit to control the other part\nand where and and how do you think of\npersonality in this\nyeah personality is a mix of the mind\nand intelligence\nbut do you think in like who we are at\nour deepest level is\nis our personality part of that it's\nlike the personality part of the car is\na mess\nyeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely i think\nso too yeah i think so too i think that\nand i don't know but i think that\nwhen i die\noh obviously my body will expire but i\nthink my personality will expire\ncorrectly but i will some essence\ni'm with you i'm going i'm with you but\ni i remember saying to someone i was\nlike man i'll feel pretty\nbummed like if when i die i'm still\nmy personality like i don't want to be\nmike posner anymore\nlike with the same neuroses and this\nlike i want to leave\nyeah yeah yeah absolutely yes\nno for sure man i get you we went\nstraight in\nall the way we went all the way i love\nit\ni'll let you ask a question yeah if\nyou're still listening\ni hope you're not scared no joking it's\ngreat awesome so\nyeah anyway i've yeah i love this this\nis great\nwe have to have this conversation\noffline too so it's awesome i love it\nand we should do this\nme too but uh i really wanted to talk\nabout your new album\ni genuinely did i listened to it the\nother day thank you for listening\nand i have so many questions based on it\nand they're great because they are all\nabout life\ndeath and the world that we live in\nwhich i love like that's\nmy fascination and fixation too is\nfiguring out our existence\nand i feel like so many of your lyrics\nthat i've picked out that i want to\nshare with the audience listening and\nwatching today\ni want to share so i'm going to pick out\na few things here\nso here i want to dive straight in i\npicked out a few lyrics and i want to\ndissect them with you\nso one of your lyrics says my heroes\nall die young they hung themselves with\nfame\nright i want to know who are some of\nyour heroes and how did they hang\nthemselves with fame what does that mean\nthis is like\nuh my hairs have kind of changed\nyou know as i've gotten older but the\nheroes i'm talking about then you know\nit's like\ngrowing up like the kurt cobain uh tupac\nshakur\nyou know um not really jay dilla but\nhe he died young as well not necessarily\nfrom being famous but\nyou know these kind of guys you know\nthat\num they're just incredible they seem to\nburn really brightly\nfor a short period of time\nthey don't fade out they explode\nyou know those are the kind of guys i\nwas referring to\nbut as i've gotten older i thought\nwhy am i idolizing them\ni should probably idolize even if\neven if they're like myths or it's not\nreal it's like\ni thought it'd probably be better to\nidolize like jesus or like the buddha\nright even if they're like stories are\nfake or\nor myths or not entirely factual like\nthere's no like flaws there like that's\na good nor better north star\nyou know what i mean than like but there\nis something just really\nreally intriguing about this kind of\nlike um\nlike you know\ngenius talent that self-destructs at\ntimes you know\nwhen did you first start learning about\nlike jesus and buddha and\nwhen did they start becoming your role\nmodels and why or your heroes\nlater in my life i mean the last like\nfour three four or five years yeah\nwhy was that why did that shift happen i\ni\nactually was i met um this teacher named\nram das you know rom does\num i had a friend\nwhose mom was sick\nand she was friends with ramdas\nand they were gonna go visit him in\nhawaii\nbut she died my friend my friend's mom\ndied and he called me say hey look i\nstill want to go on this trip\ni want you to come with me though so i\nsaid okay i'm gonna come\nand i went and uh we went to ramdas's\nhouse\nand you know he's had like a stroke so\nhe has like a\nmotorized chair he came in the room and\ni\ni had read some of his stuff and\nlistened to some of his lectures\nand he said a bunch of words i'd heard\nhim say already\nyou know like because i i knew his stuff\nand uh he said one thing that stuck out\nhe said you know he could say\nall day long your your\nyou're categorizing you say i i love\nthis and i hate this\nyou're doing that all day he goes it's\nmuch easier if you just love everything\nyou don't have to then you don't have to\ncategorize anymore it's just easier\nit takes less energy and he sort of just\nlike\nhe held this space it was less about\nwhat he's saying\nand more about like he'd look at us\nthese big eyes\nand it felt like we could have been\nserial killers or whatever he just would\nhave loved us\nthis way and i remember we walked out of\nhis house\nand this was one of those high moments\nand maybe one of the\nfirst ones i had where i was like\ni almost like keeled over and start\ncrying i was just like\nlooking around i felt like i was in a\nnew world and i felt like i was in love\nwith all the stuff\nlike like the rusty gate and the dirt on\nthe ground i just loved it all\nand it ended you know a lot i felt like\nthat the rest of the night and it\nended and i didn't feel like you know\ni didn't feel like oh i should pray to\nramdas now\nno i felt like oh this is a guy who's\nbeen doing the work for\nthe however many years he's been doing\nthe work and\ni thought i wanted i\nwant to be that for other people this\nwould be a\ngood way to spend my life as if i could\nhold that kind of space\nso it was one of these moments where i\nthought oh that is\npossible you know to\nto to be in a space like that a mindset\nlike that that\npeople can feel like you could feel it\nyou know\nand um so after that i started listening\nmore his lectures\nand i think he made a point like this in\none of his lectures\nwhich was you know if you read someone\nelse's\nlike if you read my book on spirituality\nyou're gonna get\nall of the reasons that i am not\nenlightened does that make sense\nbut if you read that something from an\nenlightened being like that guitar or\nsomething like this\nyou get you just get that you know\nswitch i you know\ni don't i read everything you know but\nbut this is what he said\nand it kind of makes sense to me you\nknow yeah\nit's beautiful man yeah i remember that\nmoment when i was 18 and i met\nthe first monk i ever met i had a very\nsimilar experience where\nmy role model switched it was the first\ntime where\ni'd always looked up to celebrities and\nentrepreneurs and ceos\nand influencers of any kind at that time\nwhen i was 18 years old\nand when i met a monk that really\nshifted my journey\nand and shifted how i was aspiring to be\nand to do because\nsimilarly to what you said it kind of\nopened me up to a whole alternative path\nthat i didn't know existed so\ni can identify with that and then and\nthen the end of that lyric you say\nthey hung themselves with fame tell me\nhow you came to write that\nthis fame thing is funny i'm sure you\ndeal with it too\nmaybe better than me but uh\nit's just so easy to get addicted to it\nyou know i mean still like to this day\nyou know i went to the monastery grew my\nbeer whatever but\ni like when people like me you know\nand uh you can you can just totally\nself-destruct\nit's like a real addiction you know um\nyou get it's like you people would do\nanything\nespecially when you get a taste of it\nyou do anything to get more of it\nyou know and can kill yourself this way\npeople do you know yeah you know the the\ncause might be a\noverdose something like this but it's\nit's that you know it's\nyou know like my friend avicii died this\nyear you know\nthis kind of thing is it's it's it's a\nit's a\nweird vortex the fame thing to be in\nyou know and i'm not like really famous\ni have like some friends that are like\nsuper\nlike like like i walked in here you know\nlike no\nif someone recognized me it's like one\nperson i can like talk to him for a\nsecond and i could go on with my day\nyou know i have friends you know like\nthey can't go in public they get like\nmod it's not like that for me\nwhich i like um\n[Music]\nit's just a weird you get into a weird i\nfeel it on tour\non tour because each night i'm playing\nthe show\npeople are there for me you know\nso in that building i'm like super\nfamous you know\nand and then when i go on\nback on the tour bus\neveryone that i'm living with works for\nme\nwhich is a weird it's just weird\nit's not real life and then i i get used\nto it\nand i'll go out of that vortex and\nexpect everyone to like be waiting on me\nand this kind of thing and it's like\nwell no no that's not reality you know\nyeah i want to dive into that thought\nthat you were saying about\nliking being liked yeah like we all like\nbeing liked\nyeah is that a bad thing is it a good\nthing how do you how and this whole\nprocess you're talking about of\nof fame how have you worked through it\nhow have you seen your friends\nwork through it successfully like what\nhave you found what have you learned\ni know there's no perfect antidote sure\nthe first thing pops up is i think it's\nprobably a survival thing\nright you know if you're liked by the\npeople around you\nless likely to be killed by them you\nknow like yeah\nit makes sense that we have that we like\nbeing liked\num if it indeed is a universal thing\nwhich i think it pretty much is\nand i'll tell you the wrong way\nthat i've tried dealing with it and\ni see other people doing this all the\ntime\nfrom afar and from close which is\ni will try to prove my autonomy\nby doing the opposite of what i know you\nlike so there was a point in my\ncareer like two three years ago where i\nthought everyone knows me it's one way\ni'm gonna do the opposite\nso i feel like i can i'm still my own\nguy i'm making my own decisions i'm not\npandering to other people so\ni remember i stopped i\nlike i was eating every other day and i\nlost\n30 pounds and i was already a healthy\nweight when i started so i was really\nskinny\nand i dyed my hair green i had a green\nmullet\nand i was doing photo shoots where i was\nwearing like makeup and women's clothes\nand there's nothing wrong with that they\nactually look pretty cool\nbut it wasn't the reason was messed up\nthat i was doing it not the\nnot the actual thing some of the photos\nare very beautiful and this kind of\nthing\nand the reason\nwas\ni was doing the opposite\nto prove to myself\nhey i'm i'm not i'm not attached to your\nopinion\nbut if you really think about it i'm\nstill very much attached to your opinion\nyour opinion is still dictating what i'm\ndoing even though it's the opposite of\nit\ninstead of just me just being me\nso i don't know if i explained that very\nwell but i did really well\ni i see that all the time with musicians\nartists and you know just people in\ngeneral where they'll be going one way\nand they want to they don't like\nthey feel the they feel themselves\nbecoming attached\nto other people's approval and so they\nflip 180\nto prove themselves that they're\nunattached but this this is actually\nstill\njust another form of attachment yeah the\ngita says attachment and aversion are\ntwo sides of the same coin\nso that's totally right when you're\ntrying to be a verse you're trying to be\nopposite all of a sudden\nright but it's still an attachment\ncorrect yeah\nthe gita says it in one line you explain\nit\nno no but you explained it beautifully\nit's a great it's a great point i\ni never even thought of it like that i\nnever realized that that's how\na lot of people try and deal with it\nthat's an interesting observation i\ndidn't know that\nyeah um\nso i think i'm still figuring it out\none way i think that really helps is\njust the way i spend my time\nin a day make sure i'm not\nyou know take time to meditate each day\nexercise just like with a couple of\nfriends\nyou know play basketball or go to the\ngym\nand then you just get this time away\nfrom where you're not even thinking\nabout any of these things and you can\nkind of revisit them with a little more\nperspective yeah um\nand you know the other thing is i take\nlike tons of time off between\nalbums two years yeah where i'm\nwhere i you know i'm writing but i'm\nalso like\nexperimenting exploring going to the\nmonastery or\nyou know like you did like a vipassana\nretreat this summer\nand just just playing around with\ndifferent\ndifferent modes of consciousness and\ntrying to tap into these different\nthings reading different books and\nyou know hopefully give a little more\nperspective i know that's not a super\nsexy answer but i don't know if there is\noh that was a great answer yeah i just\nlove your uh\nit's not for me i'm not looking for uh\nwhen i'm doing these podcasts if\neveryone listening i'm not looking for\nthe right answer or a perfect answer or\na sexy answer\ni'm looking for original\nunique you answers like observing\nanswers and your observations are\nvaluable to me\nyour observations of your fame the fame\nof others\nis interesting to me and i think it's\ninteresting to everyone listening\nbecause\nthat's how we start learning about how\ndifferent observations can help us as\nopposed to you saying\nhere's my three-step formula for how to\ndeal with fame yes\nyou know some people have that that's\ncool but i get more fascinated by\nobservations\nyeah so i i love it it was sexy to me\nthank you\nsexy to me i'm gonna move on to the next\nsong that i put out lyric on because i\nthink there's just so many and i\nand i want to i have to say that the\nmusic on this album\nis you being the same like when i listen\nto it\nit it made me want to focus and be\ncurious and be an\nexplorer of the music it wasn't just\nenjoyable i had to\nbe more curious as a listener and i\nenjoyed that process\nbecause it required more from me and and\nthat's powerful\nthat's powerful when you feel like\nintrigued to listen more\nso when i was doing that i picked out\nthis line another lyric\ni worked the last 10 years i'm a\nmulti-millionaire\nand it's supposed to all be good and\nit's not all good\nright i think you took out an\nexplanation i think i did\ni think i did i haven't sworn since i\nwas 16 years old\nis that right yeah sounds beautiful man\nyeah for a while i had a rubber band on\nmy wrist\nand i st and it worked every time i\ncursed i'd snap\nmyself and then\nand then i started cursing sorry i took\nit off i took it out no no it's great\nit's great but here you say that so the\nquestion i have here is where do you\nthink that picture of success comes from\nbecause you're saying that you've you've\nachieved everything that the world would\nhave deemed like if you were 10 years\nold\nand someone told you you'd have all of\nthis now that you're 30 right\nyou'd think that that would be yeah\nexactly right we both\ni'm done yeah you're done but it's not\nso where did that\nweird and i really want to talk about\nthat where do we think the ideas come\nfrom like where was that put into our\npsychology i don't know\nbecause i remember my parents saying\nthings like money doesn't buy you\nhappiness\nyou know which is a cliche for a reason\nthat most cliches are cliche because\nthey're\nprobably in some way true and i remember\nhearing people tell me this and i'm\nthinking\nnodding my head and putting my head\ngoing you just didn't make enough\nyeah i'm gonna make more than you i'm\ngonna be i'm gonna\ntake it to another level\nand it's just a never-ending chase\nyou know and and actually when you\nachieve your goals\ncan be in some ways\ncan be more depressing than not\nachieving them because you can achieve\nthem and realize\nhey i thought this was actually going to\nsolve like all the problems in my life i\nthought my insecurities would disappear\nand and in my case like you know i got\nthe record deal\ni had like the sports car and the house\nin the hollywood hills and\nthe whole thing yeah the\nthe whole thing you know and so i'm\nsitting there\nand i realized that my experience of\nlife\nmoment to moment is the same i have all\nthe same insecurities\ni'm not like a different person i'm not\nany happier i'm not\nactually i don't think sadder either\nbut it's the same and it's the\ndisillusionment that came with\nthinking there was this magic bullet\nfinding the magic bullet\nand then it not working and going oh\nshoot\nnow what\nand that i think is is what the next\nchapter's\nmy life has been about is the now what\nyou know\nand it there seemed to be some pro\npromising leads on this\nyeah you know like we were talking about\nearlier yeah yeah\nbut yeah yeah that's one of the reasons\nwhy i've loved missions more than\ngoals for so long explaining\nto you yeah so the difference to me is\ngoals are\ntemporary milestones a mission is a\nlifelong project a mission is eternal\na goal is temporary so a goal is i want\nto be a multi-millionaire\nreached next goal i want to be a\nbillionaire reached\nnow we have trillionaires right jeff\nbezos is going to be the first\ntrillionaire so\ntrillionaire right whatever it is like\nthat's a goal it's temporary\nit it moves it's ephemeral whereas\na mission is something you're committed\nto on a day to day\na goal is something you experience every\nso often\nas a milestone a mission is something\nthat you can experience every single day\nbecause it's a path it's a lifestyle\nit's a cause\nyou're committed to something that\nyou've\nyou feel responsible for something that\nyou feel like you're trying to drive a\nchange or a cultural shift\nwhich takes longer what's the example of\na mission\nso let me\nuh i guess even if we take let's take\nmartin luther king right so his mission\nof wanting everyone to be treated by the\ncontent of the character and not the\ncolor of their skin\nlike that's a mission like you don't\njust solve that overnight like that's\nsomething that he wanted to\nimplant into humanity and that can go\nbeyond color that can go\nbeyond gender it needs to it needs to\nthat kind of thought process of\nloving and trusting and being\ncompassionate and empathetic to all\npeople is something that goes way beyond\ndo we have independence or do we have a\ngoal or did we get the right policy in\nplace\nwhich is so temporary and doesn't\nnecessarily\npush a shift even for myself like my\nmission that i've always stated very\nclearly\nclearly is making wisdom go viral it's\nlike how do i make wisdom\nthat has been very hidden away or has\nonly been accessible\nto people who have gone to monasteries\netc how do i make that really accessible\nto everyone in the world\nthat's a mission i i've got to do that\nevery day there's no goal there's no\nlike\ni'm never gonna have a button that says\noh eight billion people now have wisdom\nlike\nyou know it's not a it's not a number\nyeah uh so anyway that's how i see the\ndifference\nbut but i love what you're saying and i\nagree with you that\nthat's why i'm i think shifting to a\nmission versus a goal life\nstill keeps you motivated it still keeps\nyou meaningful and it moves away from\nnumbers to emotions\nyou know but anyway that's just my\nthoughts yeah good thoughts man\nsome of my thoughts you asked the\nquestion\nin one of the songs do you ever get\ntired being perfect\nright and my big question around this is\nwhat is perfection does it exist and how\ndo you define perfect like how do you\nsee perfection\nthe meaning of perfection having changed\nin the world that we live in today\ni think what i was yeah what were you\nhinting at i think\ni don't always know what i'm hinting at\nsure it's kind of like sometimes the\nthing\npops in the head and i just put it down\nyeah yeah and almost like it's not\nme you know oh really that's how\nsometimes the songs come out\nit doesn't feel like i'm possessed or\nanything but it's like\nlook you know you have an inspired\nthought or a good thought\ndo you really get credit for that\nbecause it's not like you'd you design\nthe thought that's the whole point\nof inspiration is like it came to you it\ncame\nand so you know when i write a song it's\nlike\ni don't know if i really get credit for\nthat it just popped in my head and i\nbasically repeated what i heard\nyou know well if i write a crappy song\nsame thing i don't\ni don't have to i don't get blamed for\nit\nbut um yeah so that's right but\nso yeah it's it's not always cerebral\nbut what i\nwhen i hear that back or you know what i\nthink\nis\npeople that are trying to have the veil\nof perfection\nwhich i you know i've been one of those\npeople and i am at times still\nwhat about you know yeah it's it's do\nyou ever get\ntired of doing that you ever get tired\nof like trying to convince everyone that\nyou can have it all figured out\nyou know that's what i meant yeah i\nthink and i think we do get tired\nit's exhausting it's exhaust i had a\nfriend\nactually we have a friend comment in\nqueue oh yeah we're talking to him\nbecause we do him and i do this\nwhere we we go out in social situation\nand there's some\nthere's a little bit of a persona i'll\ntake on\nyou know even i'm just at a party or\nsomething i'm do i'm doing something i'm\nlike\ntrying to be and it's very close to me\nbut it's not quite me and it's not\nalways detectable\neven to me at the time but the\ndifference is\nit's exhausting and i'll leave a social\ninteraction like\nah yeah whereas i\nbelieve if you're being authentic and\nyou're\nthere like in the ramadas interaction\nlike that\nthat was rejuvenating as opposed to\nexhausting\nyeah absolutely you ever felt that\nexhaustion 100\nyeah i compare it to i compare it to\nmethod acting\nit's like being a method actor where\nyou've so engrossed in a role that\nyou're trying to play\nthat you forget who you are and and\nyou're just playing that role the whole\ntime\nyou're basically acting yes acting just\nactors\nyeah no absolutely no i've done that\nbefore tons and and it's been the same\nfor me i think that's a great way you've\nput it it's exhausting\nthat's number one and the second thing\nis you start playing it so well that you\nforget who you are\nright so you think it's your reality\nright and this i think is compounded\ngoing back to by fame because with fame\nlike i think that's a pretty universal\nthing right what we just talked about\nit gets compounded by fame because not\nonly\nare you doing uh an act that you think\nis you\nother people now have an expectation\nof an act and you don't want to\ndisappoint them so this\npressures is um\nexacerbated yeah yeah yeah you're\nspot-on it's compounded by\nthe fact that all these people are\nexpecting you to show up\nas that person correct and now you have\nto show up as that person even if you\ndon't feel like that person today\ncorrect yeah it's like having to put on\na\nhalloween suit every day yeah doesn't\nlike having to put on it it's so funny\nlike\nit's i go through so many ebbs and flows\nevery day and i don't know if this is\nlike normal other people but like\nlook every afternoon i get kind of\ndepressed every single one like\nyou like i feel it already like i'll get\na little tired you know it's like\nyou know it's like in the mornings like\nwhen i first wake up i'm like kind of\nsluggish then i'll like meditate\nexercise then i'm up you know and i feel\nlike kind of high\nin the more and it's like this all the\ntime\nand there's all these colors and\nemotions and\nand shades of colors of of how i feel\neach day and then\ni'll put them i have like one song of\nthe thousands of songs i write that\nbecomes super famous that's\na glimpse you know just like a snapshot\nof one of those moments\nand then there's expectation that that's\nyou\nyou know it's like 11 13 three years ago\non a tuesday that's you it's like no\nthat\nthat's that's me at 11 13\nthree years ago that's who i was right\nthen well\nbut this is me you know\nyeah i love that i think it's great\nand i think you just repeating that and\nsaying that it's putting that message\nmore out\ninto the world for everyone else who's\nlistening to actually get that message\ntoo\nthat let's not be defined by just that\none glimpse of our life whether it's\ngood or bad even\nright because we just let ourselves be\nyeah a human being isn't\nimpossibly\nthis is it's just impossibly complex\nand beautiful at the same you know this\nmoment this summer i was thinking about\nhow\nlike the difference between what's real\nand what's not\nyou know like the microphone here this\nis real\ni would say for just our sega discussion\nlet's say this is real like it exists in\nreality i can touch it it's there\nand i was on retreat and i was thinking\ni have this mat like\nmap of in my head like where what i've\naccomplished what i want to accomplish\nit's like a trajectory\nbut then i thought that map is not real\nbecause it doesn't exist anywhere but in\nmy thoughts like i just\nmade it up\nin the same way that that is not real\nwho i think i am which to me was like\nmy facts of my personal history my name\nmy occupation\nmy age mixed with\nlike memories of emotions that i have\nlike emotional reactions mixed with like\nhonestly archetype characters from\nmovies or books\nall that mashed up that's like that's\nwho i am it's like my personality that's\nwho i\nam in my head i thought\nthat's not real either it literally does\nnot exist\nand other people have an idea of who i\nam but it's not even the\nsame one that i have in my head and it's\njust\nlike i was spending so much energy like\ncurating this\nthing in my head and like making it look\nperfect\nbut a no one else sees it\nb is not there it's not a real\nthing you know it's just so silly\nwe do that like all day long like i have\nto\ndo this or accomplish this or act in a\ncertain way in order to\num keep this idea\nof myself this picture of myself that i\nhave looking\nbeautiful or add some stroke to it but\nit's not\nit's not there\nno yeah no it's true that you've\nreminded me of\nliterally my favorite quote i say this\neverywhere because it's\nit's such an inspiration for so much of\nmy work\nin 1902 a sociologist named cooley\nsaid that today i'm not what i think i\nam i'm not what you think i\nam i am what i think you think i am\nright so right we live in a perception\nof a perception of ourselves meaning\nif i think mike thinks\ni'm happy then i feel happy and if i\nthink\nmike thinks i'm weak then i'll feel weak\nso we're\nbasing how we feel about ourselves on\nhow we think others feel about us\nand that's that picture you're\nconstantly trying to mold in your mind\nconstantly like what does this person\nthink okay\nwhat do they think what do i think how\ndo i what do i add to this\nand then we get lost trying to build\nthis\nand it wasn't even real in the first\nplace right it was just a perception of\na position yeah a funny flip on this\nis our audition perhaps is\nwhat i believe is going on in your head\nis a function of what's going on in my\nhead\ndoes that make sense so\nwhat i what i suspect you're thinking\nabout is really just\nthe crap i think about because that's\nall i have\ni've never been in anyone else's head\ni've only been in my head and i know my\nthoughts\nso i assume you're having some these\nkind of thoughts\num i use the example of of weight\nlike because i when i stopped eating i\nhad this thing\ni would get hung up on weight i was\nalways looking at people's weight\nall the time obsessing over it and\ni thought oh people people think i look\nfat or\nthis way and i realize they're not\nthinking that's what i think they're\nthinking\nand what i think they're thinking is\nbased on what i think\nyeah and so it's like just to simplify\nit it's like\nin order to not feel judged\njudge less because then\nyou know if you're not walking around\njudging people you'll assume you won't\nassume they're judging you\nthat makes sense i love that that's\nbeautiful\nin order to not feel judged judge less\nyeah\nyeah it's nice it's great advice\nthat's great advice that's yeah that's a\ngreat flip i like it that's awesome man\nthat's awesome now you\ni want to talk about this because i\nthink it's important for the album that\nwe're talking about right now like\nyou lost someone really important to you\nlast year your father there's you know\nsomeone obviously extremely special to\nyou how's that\naffected built created this album how's\nthat how have you been processing that\na lot of different ways in in some ways\nreal explicit in other ways\nvery ambiguous and i'm sure in some ways\ni don't even see or understand yet\nbut\nlook i e you know i had an amazing\nfather for\n29 years so the first thing is like when\nyou\nwhen you have loss you had to have\nat first had in order to even feel lost\nso vary this like gently and subtly you\ncan\ngo from this like feeling of being\ncheated or something like this to just\nhaving gratitude for\nthe thing being there in the first place\nand be\nyou know look i'm sure you do and i i\ncertainly do\nyou know have a lot of friends i grew up\nwith in detroit and southfield that\neither never knew their dad or dad was\nin their life\nthe way mine was and\nit almost feels like silly to me\nto\nbe too sad because i had this amazing\ngift\nand how could i complain about having\nsomething awesome for\n29 years and say hey i should have had\nit 30 or i should have 31. like\nnah man you don't get to decide that you\nknow\nthat's not for you to decide um\nso i deal with it in different ways this\nis how i feel on this couch\nthere are other times where i'll be\nplaying my guitar alone\nin the hotel and i'll start crying and i\nmiss him and i'll go dang he's really\ngone\nand there are other times where i'll be\nmeditating\nor i'll be performing\nand i feel i swear i can like feel them\naround\nit feels like an inner like a energy\nsuch like a buzzword but it feels like\nit's not like he's standing there in his\nbody it just feels like his and\nit's weird thing to talk about no good\nway to talk about it but it's not weird\nat home\nyeah i feel like i could i could feel\nhim around his energy\nand uh\nyeah the second part like there's\nanother part of death\nwhich is it's\nit's quite a beautiful reminder\nfor you to get your life together\nbecause the real thing about death that\npeople get tripped up on is it reminds\nyou you're gonna die this\ncan be a really good thing to get that\nreminder\nbecause it puts in perspective what\nreally matters\nhey am i doing you know a lot of us have\na list of things that we\nwe want to do when we're done doing what\nwe think we have to do\nand you know my dad died i was like\ni'm next like i look just like that guy\nyou know when i look at a picture of him\nhe's 30 it's like it's me\nyou know so the next guy you know\nis me and\ni started looking back at this list of\nstuff that i actually want to do and\nstart doing it you know start doing it\nand obviously you know my album is a lot\nhe's on my album you know recordings of\nus talking\nso he influenced my music this way in a\nbig way\nwith this record and um\nso yeah it's just a lot it's a lot you\nknow\nimplicit and explicit ways um\nhe's a he's a great guy great man\nyou know and i i the older i get\nthe more i understand how beautiful of a\nman he was\nyou know when i think about where i see\nfriends that like\nhave families or or kids and really\nseeing what that actually entails\nit's a lot you know and i think about\nyou know when i was on the basketball\nteam\nin high school i never played i was\nreally short\nand i just sat on the bench and he would\nbe at every single game\nhe'd be the first parent there i\nremember one time he said mike\ni'm really sorry he was an attorney he\nsaid i have a case i can't move it\ni'm gonna miss the game i remember\nthinking like\nall good man i don't play anyways i\ndon't know if you notice\nbut i just sit there\nand uh i remember our it was an away\ngame this was like in pontiac which is\nyou know\n34 minutes right our bus pulled up\nand we get off the bus like we're there\nlike an hour too early to warm up\nand there's one guy in the stands it's\nmy dad\nhe's like i moved the case you know i\ngot in he was always there he always\nshowed up\nyou know one perfect man no one is\nbut yeah i love that i love that guy man\nforever\nhe was funny too man he was a goofball\nman\nsilly guy and beautiful i just this is\nloving loving you know\nthat's beautiful man thank you so much\nfor sharing so openly and\nthat's you know for anyone who's ever\nlost anyone i'm sure\n[Music]\nsomething that you've said here today is\ngoing to help them too\nyeah you know and another thing i i've\ni've spoken\nthere's a guy i know he's become a\nfriend he's a\nhospice chaplain so he helps people die\nand helps families and people he says\nthe one thing you can count on grief\nto do is to surprise you\nso often we we feel something you know\nwhen we have this loss\nand and the next or the biggest question\nis like is this right\nshould i be feeling this way and the\nanswer is\nthere's no right grief is surprising\nit's gonna hit you when you're not\nsuspecting it\nsometimes longer you know people expect\noh\nit's been a year yeah why am i you're\ngood you know\nthat's not how it works it's not how it\nworks and for me\ni actually wasn't even sad when my dad\ndied i thought man\ni had my dad it was beautiful he wasn't\nin pain\nall my family's here we're having this\nbeautiful funeral\ncelebrating his life i didn't cry was\nsmiling\nthat's hard that's it's not wrong right\nor wrong it's just how i felt\nyou know later my mom was playing eight\nmonths later she's playing like i'm\nchecking her voicemail you know and\nshe's going through and what\nshe gets to want my dad when he's alive\nand he was sick\ni lost it i was weeping like a baby i\nstarted weeping\nit's not right or wrong it's just we\neach have our own path\nwith grief you know yeah yeah i think\nit's so\nit's so easy that with a physical scar\nyou like watch it heal\nyou can see it you know that you're\napplying something on it that's\nletting it heal that's getting a scar on\nit etc you can see the wound getting\ncovered and then it disappears but\nemotionally it's almost like oh yeah\nit's been a month you must be better now\nbut it's\nyou know you can't see it and so the\nonly person who's experiencing it in\ndifferent ways all the time\nis you yourself and that healing process\nis totally unique totally different\nfor each person and you can't put a time\nlimit on it or you can't put a\nexpectation on it but because we can't\nsee it we kind of just pretend like it's\nnot there\nyeah yeah we make up a schedule hey it's\nbeen a year i should be over this yeah\nyeah\nyeah not based on anything yeah yeah\nthank you for sharing that man i really\nappreciate it no problem your dad sounds\namazing\nhe's a good guy yeah i'm so happy to\nhear you celebrate his incredibleness\nyou know for the time that you had and\nit's so beautiful to hear that man\nit's so beautiful to hear that thank you\nthank you\nyeah and and now you're at this place\nwhere you're\n30 and you talk about being stuck in the\nmiddle\non your album that's how i feel right\nand and i feel like we've talked a lot\nabout\ngetting to 30 and what's happened before\nand the songs and the\nthe fame and the money and all of this\nlike where\nwhen you're saying you're stuck in the\nmiddle how is your perspective currently\non the next not i'm not even going to go\ntoo far but on the next like 12 months\nthe next\nyou know how what is your perspective\nwhat's changed where is that stuck in\nthe middle\nsong inspired by it's it's you know it\nwas a funny thing it's like a lot of\ntimes\nsongs they'll come before i actually\nlive them\nthe song come first and then i'll live\nthe live\nout the song after sometimes this is how\nit is we're stuck in the middle\nthe last verse of this song is um\npeople love the old me i don't know\nwhere he's gone\ntoo too tired to be famous\ntoo vain to be unknown this is how i\nfeel like i have a toe in both\nlike like i know that i know becoming\nmore famous or more successful is not\nreally going to change my life\nbut there's part of me still that like i\nreally want like\nhave more hit songs and this this kind\nof thing it's like\nthe grip has been loosened but my hand's\nstill on it\nand then there's this other part of me\nthat like doesn't care\nit's like you know off at the monastery\nor in\nlike i ca you know what i mean it's like\nit's the polar opposites\nit's like pop star\nlike monastery like like\none day i'm like at the grounds the\nother day i'm like there you know it's\nlike\nthat's for like in stuck in the middle\nyeah but maybe my friend said maybe\nyou're not stuck\nmaybe just in the middle yeah that's\nwhere you're supposed to be\nyou know yeah i can relate to that i\nlove paradoxes\ni i myself feel like a paradox i felt\nlike a paradox my whole life\nand i i i'm right in the middle too i\nlived as a monk and i do media and\ni feel so much but what i do know is\nthat\nin my own way i'm refining my intentions\non a daily basis\naspiring to use any platform i have for\nsomething higher than myself\nbecause i know myself that after having\nbeen a monk for three years and\nlived in a monastery in ashram for three\nyears\ni didn't feel like i was fulfilling my\npurpose either because i wanted to\nreally\ngive what i learned and i had this\ndesire to share it\nbecause i can't get away with who i am\nas a person i've always been driven\ni've always been motivated i've always\nbeen someone who wants to share etc so i\ncan't get away from that artificially\nand if i do i'll only end up feeling\nuseless and then at the other end i\nalso know that i have to be wary that i\ndon't get too caught up\nin the world because then i can lose\nthat monk\nand so for me i couldn't agree with you\nmore i think being in the middle is such\na beautiful place to be\nit requires a ton more work and that's\nour challenge like that's how i see it\nlike\nyou're reminding me of my own challenge\nto myself that\nwhen you want to operate at either end\nignorance is bliss\nor wisdom is bliss and then you're\ntrying to be in both you're like in the\nmiddle yeah you're having to\nyou know make sense yeah does that make\nany sense yes it does\nignorance is bliss and you're like full\nin the world like full hedonistic\nyeah wisdom's bliss you're full in the\nmonastery yeah\nand like having both those in your life\nintegrated is\nyeah that's the real small task yeah\nyeah we're like setting ourselves up for\nthe hardest thing\ni'm gonna have to learn from you i'm\ngonna have to no bro\nno bro i'm here learning from you that's\nwhy i was trying to hijack your\ninterview and ask you all the questions\nman\nno it's all man you've given like what\ni'm listening to you like this\nby the way for everyone who's listening\nwhen you listen to this album which i\nreally really recommend that you do\nbecause when i was listening to her i\nwas exploring like if you're fascinated\nby\nwhat mike's saying on the podcast right\nnow if you're watching this hearing this\nwhen you listen to the album you'll be\nable to see a mirror across it's\nsuch a profound piece of work it's\nprofound like that's that's the right\nway to put it\nand and yeah if you're a fan of mike or\nif you've\ni'm sure you've heard some of this stuff\nif you haven't this is\nthis is the stuff that you know i want\nyou to listen to\nthank you but yeah we spent a lot of\ntime yeah it's\nweird making these albums like\nperhaps like a dying form of\nart the album because people as\ndon't as much listen to them through\num but i sort of don't care because i do\nlisten albums through and i\ni love albums and so we spend like\nmonths on transitions in song order\nand transitions like a lot of my songs\nwill connect you know the\nyou'll see the the the marker go from\nlike track four to track five but\nthe music doesn't there's no change you\nknow there's no like break\nand so yeah we spent like a lot of time\non that you know it's like i don't know\nif anyone's gonna listen\nyeah we did yeah no i i still remember\nthe feeling of looking forward to an\nalbum coming out\nand like going to buy this the cd and\nlike opening up the pack\nand like i i still love listening to\nalbums because\nthe songs that you hear on the radio are\nnever anyone's best songs in my opinion\nlike they're a good starting point but\nthey're like the taster\nright you know they're like the free\nfree meal but it's like you want you\nwant the\nyou want the full experience and with\nyour process is different right like you\ndon't\nyou don't put a single output a single\noutput a single out and test you kind of\nbuild the whole thing\nbecause you don't want to be affected by\nthat's what i read from your work when i\nwas doing my research yeah\nyeah i don't think it's wrong to do it\nthis is have a friends you\nknow they they will they'll make you\nknow\nhalf the album they'll put a single out\nand if\nand they'll they'll see what people say\nabout it and then they'll finish the\nalbum\nget with that information i don't like\nthis way i like to do the whole thing\njust and i don't let anyone hear it\nexcept for my friends that are working\non it\nbut manager doesn't hear it no one at\nthe record label hears it\nno one until i make this thing\nhow i want how i i think is great\nand then i'll play it for a few friends\ni trust\nget feedback i'll go from there if the\nfeedback\nhits me in that tender place where i\nknow that it's right\ni'll address it and if enough i think\nthey're wrong\nin my heart i don't address it\nand then i go to record label and say\nhere's my album\nit's done yeah and\nthat's it it's done it's awesome man\ni've got the five big questions for you\nthat i always\ntalk about i want to hear you play as\nwell but these are five big questions so\nthe first big\nquestion is what's the best thing you've\never let go of\nbest thing i've ever let go of that\nyou're happiest about letting go\nbecause you've really cleansed you've\nhealed your work you're doing the work\nso\ni would say\nthere's been a few times where i\ni've moved into my van not because i\ni had fallen on hard times because i\nfelt like my possessions were weighing\nme down\nso like yeah i i had this i owned a\nhouse in the hollywood hills and\ni had a porsche sports car and i had\nlike more\nsneakers than i even knew i had\nand everything i was moving to my van i\nbought this like a little conversion van\nand i put this stuff like some clothes\nin it that i needed\nin there in my guitar and\nit doesn't fit very much and the rest i\njust i donated\nso i would say all that stuff\nwell let go of it man and i just felt\nlighter\nnice yeah it's awesome\nquestion number two i saw that on your\nwebsite you have a hate mail section\nyeah tell me how that all came about and\nhow you deal with criticism\ni copied this from my friend amanda\npalmer\nokay who's an amazing artist and writer\nand\num for me it's just a good way to like\nprop\nwhen i was on social media now i have\nsomeone\npost for me right i'll write the post\nand they do it\nbecause i try not to read the comments\nbut before i used to be on there and i\nprobably will have to go back to\njust because i like having dialogue with\nmy\nlisteners um but\ninvolved with that is reading some\npretty negative things about yourself\nand before they just really hurt my\nfeelings but then i started amassing\nthem and i made this section my website\ncalled hate mail and i would repost\nand suddenly the same message that\nseemed really\nmean and hurtful it\nbecame funny yeah they ever just became\nfun and i'd like read them out loud with\nmy mom and we'd both\njust be cracking up you know it reminds\nme of the last scene of eight mile when\neminem goes and\nshares all the bad stuff he already\nknows about himself\nyeah he said tell these people something\nthey don't know about me\nthey don't already know about me right\nyeah yeah and it's like when you've done\nthat\nit's like no one else has got anything\nleft to say exactly because you've\nalready said it exactly\ni love that man okay question number\nthree the worst\nyou know the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nthe first one that comes to mind\nprobably that romdos advice i like to\njust love everything\nit's way easier it's way easier\ndon't don't i'm repeating it but\nthe you know all day long it's just it's\nlike i\nlike this i don't like this i love this\ni hate that\njust love everything it's easier it's\nless exhausting\ni love it i love that too thanks for\nrepeating it\nwhat's the where do you feel\nchange in the world is going to come\nfrom individually collectively\npositive change where is it going to\ncome from\nthere has to be i believe\nan internal shift in everyone\nindividually i mean look all of us know\nlike war is bad and we know like we need\nto\ndo more for the environment and we know\nthe planet's getting warmer\nbut\nour action is not lined up with\nour knowledge right it's the same things\nlike everyone knows how to lose weight\neveryone knows like they know everyone\nknows what\nfoods are unhealthy exercise more but\nstill\nmany people with that knowledge do not\nlose weight even though they want to\nso what so people have\nthere has to be a shift in the i think\nlike when we talk opened up about you\nknow that we are not our minds\nyou know we are more than our minds and\nhow to deal with\nhow to deal with minds that have crazy\nthoughts\nand have thoughts that\ndon't serve us and don't serve us as\nas a species either and\num there's to be a shift\nto where we actually see\nour species as a collective\nwe don't really you don't really you\nknow it's like\nyou know i see the thing about someone\nstarving in africa and it's like\ni understand it's bad but people don't\npeople don't stop what they're doing\nthere's still a degree of apathy there\nso and i think this is moving in the\nright direction i think we're getting\nthere\nbut not yet it's great answer man\nfinal question would you like to play us\nsomething yeah\nhave a yeah request have a special no\nyou no\nyour inspiration i always go with your\ninspiration i don't want to think about\nwhat i think you're thinking about\nplaying so\ni'm gonna let you go with your\ninspiration\nuh your answers are inspirational so i'm\nexcited for
