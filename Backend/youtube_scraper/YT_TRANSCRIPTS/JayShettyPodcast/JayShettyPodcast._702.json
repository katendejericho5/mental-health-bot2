    "transcript": "i just think optimism is great because i\nthink you know\npositivity is better than negativity and\noptimism and visualization of positive\nthings\nworks i mean like it's just about like\nwhich direction do you want to go in you\nknow which road do you want to go down\ni'd rather be happy hello everyone\nwelcome back to\non purpose the number one health podcast\nin the world thank you so much\nfor being here i'm so excited to\nintroduce you to our next\nguest she's one of the leading figures\nin entertainment today\nshe's a talk show host an activist a\ncomedian and a best-selling\nauthor and i'm so excited to introduce\nyou and the podcast\nchelsea handler chelsea thank you so\nmuch for being here thank you\nthank you for having me it's such a\npleasure to have you here i know we just\nconnected\ni think literally like 10 days ago so\nyou were speaking at this conference\ncalled wisdom 2.0 you were also speaking\nand i was there to do a bit of speaking\ntoo\nand i remember this moment when i was\nbeing interviewed on stage and then i\nsaw you in the front row and i was like\noh my god it's chelsea like\ni had a moment where i where i fan gold\non stage i'm not sure if it was obvious\nat all\nand then i was really happy that i\nbumped into you later on at dinner time\nand so when we spoke and we connected i\ni felt your energy was awesome and\ni'm so glad you came out here thank you\nthat's very nice thanks yeah\ni went with my sister with my because my\npsychiatrist\nwhich i have to say all the time now my\npsychiatrist uh\nhad uh referred me to that or asked me\nif i had any interest in speaking at the\nwisdom 2.0 conference in san francisco\nis what we're talking about\nand i was like well not really but sure\nthat sounds interesting\nand he's like well we could talk about\nus or you don't have to you know i it's\nyou know i can't talk about us i'm like\nwell then let me\nbecause my entire book is about my\nrelationship with my psychiatrist\nand my kind of i for lack of i hate the\nword journey because the bachelor ruined\nthat around 10 years ago but\nbut like for lack of a better term my\nexperience with therapy\nand what it did you know i didn't think\ni needed it i didn't think i needed to\ncalm down or slow down and then\ni did so it's all about that so he said\nhey why don't you come and talk about at\nwisdom 2.0 and i was like all right well\ni may as well start\npromoting the book since you know what i\nmean that's what you do\nthat's what the book is about so sure\nlet me get out there yeah and i found\nthat really refreshing and the book's\ncalled\nlife will be the death of me it's out\napril 9th so for anyone who's listening\nor watching right now it's probably past\napril 9th now so you can go ahead and\nget the book it's probably out by now\nbut that's what i love about the book\nand when i saw you there and i saw you\nwhen wisdom 2.0 was sharing that you\nwere going to be\nthere i was just like wow i'm really\nfascinated by your story and journey\nlack of a better word to mindfulness to\nmeditation to personal growth and\nself-awareness so\nwe're going to dive into that today my\naudience is in love with this theme\nand i think they're going to gain so\nmuch from hearing about it from your\nperspective\nwhich i think is going to be really\nunique for them so one of the first\nthings i wanted to ask you about\nwas around the quote that you start the\nbook with from gloria steinem and you\ntalk about this quote\naround how everyone's looking to find\nthe right person\nrather than trying to be the right\nperson and i wanted to ask you why did\nyou start the book with that quote and\nwhy was that so important to you\nat setting the tone because i think a\nlot of like\nyou know from from my experience a lot\nof my life has been about the end result\nrather than the being it's about the\ndoing and like the walking off the stage\nnot being on the stage\nand i think that kind of transfers to\npeople too a lot of us are looking for\nsomeone to complete our lives\nor somebody to like you know be the lid\nfor our pot\nso to speak so for that theme is very\nimportant to me because i've always been\nvery like fiercely independent almost to\nthe point where it's like\nno one i'm gonna reject everyone so\nnobody gets to reject me\nyou know and and then so i have that\nkind of\nopposite like i can do everything i can\nhandle this i don't need help from\nanyone\nso i i relate to that theme because it's\nthe opposite of what i feel\nyou know i have it in the opposite\ndirection i just you know it's too\npowerful too strong\ntwo like you know i can fix everything\nand i don't need a man i don't need you\ni don't need a family i don't need\nanything\nso uh i mean i think those are themes\nthat we all have it's one or the other\nfor most people i think yeah and that\nwhen\nwhen i was reading through your book one\nthing i found is that it's so open\nand vulnerable and honest and one of the\nthings that that reminds me of is this\nbeautiful banksy\npainting i'm not sure if you've seen it\nand it says be with someone who makes\nyou happy and this little girl has\ncrossed off the width\nand then it tends to be someone who\nmakes you happy and\nand it's it's a beautiful principle and\ni think starting with that\nis such a powerful point and powerful\nmessage to everyone reading the book\nbecause\nyou're so right that we've just never\nbeen taught to get to know ourselves\nlike one of the things i always talk\nabout is how we've never had a moment to\ntake a meeting with ourselves even\nthough\nwe have meetings with everyone\nthroughout the day yeah i think that's\nimportant i think you know you can kind\nof\nyou can lose the plot a little bit you\nknow we're always into doing and what\nwe're achieving instead of figuring out\nwhat kind of person we're behaving like\nwhile we're on that road you know or to\nactually take the time and look outside\nyour lane and look at\nother people's experiences and how\nthey're unlike your own like not\nnot many of us have the luxury to even\ndo that people are just trying to scrape\nby\nand you know and so if i have the luxury\nto do it i better do it\ni better do that work if i can afford to\ngo see a psychiatrist for a year then\nyeah i'm going to be a better human\nbeing at the end of it\nwhich is what i kept telling myself even\nthough it was painful and you know i\ndidn't want to talk about all these\nthings that i didn't think had a real\nimpact on my life\ni thought it was the past and i'm strong\nand i'm successful so it doesn't matter\nit doesn't you know\nif i'm in pain from a nine-year-old\ninjury of my brother dying if i'm in\npain from\nyou know my father's reaction and my\nbrother dying all of these things that\nbuild up and you kind of have like you\nknow i know i've had the veneer like it\ndoesn't\nmatter i'm i'm cool with it it does it\ndoes matter and it is a deep injury and\nuntil you really\nrepair your own injuries you're not very\nuseful to other people\nso if you want to have a meaningful\nexistence or life and i want to do\nthings that are impactful and make\nchange then i need to be get real about\nit\nyou know and so i had to get real with\nmyself which i thought i had been being\nreal forever\nand then i was like ugh gross i have to\nunpeel this\nlike it was so it's such a cliche\nalso like me and you know turning at 40\nand having going my midlife crisis\nand all of this kind of identity uh you\nknow\num kind of discovery what my identity is\nand my identity crisis\nso it's all like blah blah blah blah\nblah but i figure you know what i've\nmade a career out of over sharing this\nis something worthwhile\nbecause not everybody can afford it so\nwe all are recovering from some injury\nwe had you know as a child\num but you know i have there's a part of\nme that's very cynical and that's very\nmuch a realist\nso i have a hard time with a lot of this\nla mumbo jumbo\nand spirituality can can ha can stink of\nmumbo jumbo a lot of the time\nso you know it's you don't\nthat's why i had a hard time with\ntherapy because i thought it represented\nthat like oh me navel gazing after i\nhave a show and books about me i'm gonna\ngo talk about myself for two hours like\nwhat kind of loser am i\nso that's you know it was all about ego\nlike i can't it's too much you know what\ni mean i'm a narcissist\nyeah and we all have different excuses\nlike you're sharing some of the ones you\nhave\nand i think we all have excuses whether\nit's to see a therapist a psychiatrist\nspiritually whatever it is and i want to\ndive into everything you just said but i\nwant to\ngo back to what even opened you up\nto the fact that like you're saying you\nhad all these excuses in your head you\nhad the ego the narcissism all of these\nthings that you talk about\ndeeply in the book what allowed you to\ngo beyond that and say okay no i\nreally need to do this and then stay\ncommitted because you say when you first\nstarted meeting\ntherapists and psychiatrists you were\njust sitting there lying to people and\ni'm not sure how many people actually go\nout there and are\npaying people to lie to them which seems\nlike a crazy thing to do\nbut how did you get beyond that last one\nthen find someone that you could\nwell i interviewed him on my netflix\nshow my last show on netflix i\ninterviewed him about brain\nadolescent brain development and i and\nhe was very smart and literal and he\nspoke in ways that i could talk about\nthe brain in a non-emotional way\nso i took that as my like you know\ninvitation to kind of\ndiscuss the brain with him so when i\nrealized i had to go see somebody\nit was after the election and i just had\nsuch outrage and my anger was out of 10\nall the time and i couldn't work i\ncouldn't\nfocus on anything but the news and this\n24-hour spin cycle that it created\nand i just was like oh my god i have to\nharness this anger into something\npowerful and good not this i can't be\nthis way\nall the time and they were like robbing\nme of my life this administration\nand i allowed them to and i was like no\nno no i'm not doing this so i went\nyou know there for that and what it\nrealized what i uncovered with through\nseeing the psychiatrist because for the\nfirst three sessions all i did was\nand moan about donald trump\nlike i was paying somebody you know this\nmoney to listen to me complain about him\nand i got a lot out of it i mean i would\nhave paid him more\nbut after three sessions like we started\nto get real and started talking about\nwhat donald trump's\nlike presidency represented to me which\nwas an unhinged childhood when things\nwere completely out of control\nso for the first time in my adult life\nthings felt completely out of control\nand it like\nreminded me of my brother going off and\nsaying he was going to be right back and\ndying\nlike that was the other time my life was\nout of control so that's why it\ntriggered all this stuff on me\nand so talking to somebody and having\nsomebody who has a degree in you know\npsychiatry and\nand and other things telling you hey\nthis is don't minimize an incident just\nbecause you weren't raped or sexually\nassaulted you have a right to be in pain\nyou lost your brother\nthat's painful you probably haven't\nmatured much beyond that emotionally\nwhen it comes to men\nat nine years from nine years old and i\nwas like no\nthat's exactly what's happening i'm a\nnine-year-old when it comes to romance\nbecause my brother was like my crush you\nknow i mean he was the oldest i was the\nyoungest\nand once somebody said that to me i'm\nlike oh my god is it that obvious like\nthat's how basic this all is\ni answer yes it is and if you don't\nyou know ask questions like that or\nadmit it to yourself then you're just\nkind of masking pain so so i i loved\nwhat you said there because it's almost\nlike giving yourself\npermission to feel pain mm-hmm like a\nlot of us are masking ourselves from it\nor we're like oh\nthat didn't matter like and for you it's\nlosing your brother which you talk a lot\nabout how it actually defined\nyou and your family for a period of time\nbefore you went through this process\nwhere you were able to actually say i'm\nnot gonna let that define me and\nright i mean i think that i was being\ndefined by loss i was being defined by\noh you know as a nine-year-old i didn't\nhave the ability to understand that my\nbrother didn't have a choice he didn't\ngo\nkill himself or to me it felt like he\nleft our family to go live with another\nfamily because he found somebody he\nliked better with a cooler\nlittle sister or whatever i was you know\ni didn't understand that it was an\naccident\nso i was mad at him and i was i\ncontinued to be mad at people you know\nfor any sort of\nvibe like that which is you know what\nleads to not ever trusting men\nor being in a relationship and why i\nfeel so\nlike strongly about providing for myself\nso that i don't have to rely on another\nperson\nhow did you start revisiting these\nmoments in a constructive way when i\nhear you speak it's like\nyou're able to find the patterns you're\nseeing the parallels\nobviously thanks to a psychiatrist\nyou're able to see that this event\ncould have sparked this how does someone\nre-look at their life constructively\nas opposed to destructively because it\ncould feel like if you\ni think the reason why we shun away from\nthese things is because we're scared of\ndiving back into a past experience and\nhaving to make sense of it\nyeah i think i mean if it's really\npainful you obviously like need a\nprofessional because a lot of people\naren't willing to\nor capable i think or have the\nvocabulary to access your pain you know\nwhat i mean at nine\nsomething happened to you that was\ntraumatic when you were a child you\ndon't have the vocabulary to articulate\nthat pain so that carries with you to\nadulthood\nand as an adult you still don't have the\nvocabulary even though you do\nso i think that like you just have to\nreally\nknow that like unwelcome thoughts are\ngreat things to explore\nyou know everyone talks about that with\nmeditation to like don't\ntry and shut up a negative thought or a\ndoubtful thought but\nactually welcome it and consider it and\ngo oh okay this is here\ngive it the airtime it needs so that\nmaybe when it leaves it's gone for\nlonger\nrather than trying to tamp something\naway so i think all of those things with\nregard to like memories\nwhen you're growing up it's just you\nhave to you have to believe in science\nand data\nand understand that going through these\nconversations with someone\nis going to be a helpful event for you\nmost often\nunless you have some quack that doesn't\ngive a about you know helping you\num so i think most people are in this\nbusiness because they want to help other\npeople\nso uh yeah i think it's important to\nthink about your\nthe memories you don't love don't obsess\nabout them but give them like\nthe respect that they deserve so that\nmaybe you can sort them out\nyeah i i think i learned a year ago i i\ncompletely agree with you i made a video\ncalled how meditation made me a bad\nperson\nand it was because when i first started\nto meditate it made me more aware of all\nthe stuff i needed to deal with\nand so all of this negativity was there\nall of this other stuff was surfacing\nfrom my childhood from my background\nand so the video was all around that\nprinciple around like it's not like you\nmeditate and you feel great straight\naway no i totally can relate to what\nyou're saying because like\ni said this to my doctor i said hey\nlisten now that i'm meditating like 15\nminutes a day i mean and this is hard\nfor me like i'm not\ninto meditation the way i want to be i\nwant to get it because i know it's right\nand it's going to help\nand i've already seen small signs of it\nhelping with my patients and you know\nsetting an intention for the day and you\nknow yadda yadda but\ni think like when you do you know\ni think sometimes when you're addressing\nthe very issues you have\nthe opposite side of those things\nbecomes louder than normal because\nyou're now more aware of your behavior\nso that gets that din gets a little bit\nlouder and you're like wait i'm become\ni'm doing all the right things why am i\nhaving doubtful thoughts why am i having\nnegative thoughts\nand you're like because you're more\naware and those pass\ntoo yeah so i can relate to that oh good\ni'm glad\ni'm glad i thought it was just me but it\nwas that yeah the\nthe the tradition that i studied as a\nmonkey would describe it as when you try\nand clean a room\na dusty room the first thing to happen\nis the dust comes up in your face\nand if it was clouding it doesn't feel\ncomfortable it's uncomfortable\nbecause you're trying to clean a place\nthat hasn't been cleaned for a long time\nright or hasn't even been seen for a\nlong time yeah\nbut i love what you talk about in the\nbook you talk about us building bubbles\nand and i like the way you described\nthat because i do think and you you've\nmentioned the la bubble a bit already\nbut it's like we live inside a bubble\nand then we all think we don't but\neveryone has their own bubble and then\nwe're living inside multiple bubbles\ntell me about\nyour experience when you started to\nrecognize you're like oh wow i'm in a\nbubble\nand then how do i break this bubble i\nthink you know again with the election\nit was like when\nall of this like this racist stuff was\nlike coming to a head\nyou know for me i really thought like\nthat we had\ngotten somewhere like i was naive and it\nwas uh\nthat just was another example of the\nbubble i live in\nyou know um is that i i like i couldn't\nbelieve it and when you all black people\nare like it happens all the time like\nwhy are you guys surprised now\nlike why are white people not better\nallies and advocates to people of color\nand\nthat's what i spent my time doing last\nyear reading books you know like\njames baldwin and tony see coates and or\nhowever you say his name i always screw\nit up but\nyou know like really just thinking\noutside of my own experience because\nclearly i'm part of\nsome lucky club because i don't\nhave to you know worry about what\nwhat i'm going to do next even though i\ndo you know i could pretty much do\nwhatever i want and\nand you have to realize that's a\nrarified experience to have\nand i i just thought i deserved it for a\nreally long time\nuntil i really started to be like okay\nyou know scared about what was happening\nin the world and looking around\nand i'm embarrassed that it took that\nlong i have so much\nrespect and admiration for you for\nhaving to do that at that stage\nlike right now in your life because i\nthink it's it's wonderful that\ni when i hear you speak it's like i\nrecognize the judgment you have on\nyourself and just like\nyou know i know how much you want to\nchange and at the same time i'm just\nlike chelsea no thank you like thank you\nfor doing this because\ni think that what it's showing is that\nit's never too late or too early\nit's never like oh you're too far gone\nor you're not it's not this process of\nlike i wish i learned this when i was a\nkid it's like no i'm going to take\nresponsibility\nnow and i'm going to change it now and i\nthink that's so refreshing i think it's\ngoing to help so many people\nthank you so from my side i'm genuinely\njust excited to see your journey\nbe a catalyst for so many people to just\npush out of their own complaints and see\nme included\nand and all of us to look beyond that\nwell that would be great i mean can you\nimagine\ni start a movement i i think you can i\nbelieve embracing your grief\ni believe is that what we're going to\ncall it i don't know can we come up with\na shorter title\nor embracing your grief it doesn't sound\nlike an upper no\ni'll think of something yeah we need\nsome good marketing yeah no i i mean it\nlike i'm and i'm not just saying it like\nwhen i see you talk about this story\nwhen i see you share this message i get\nso excited and activated\nbecause because there's so many people\nwatching you they admire you for so many\ndifferent talents that you have\nand then when you say actually all of\nthis like this is giving its meaning\nright like this is now giving it meaning\nyeah yeah i suppose so yeah it's hard\nyou know like to think of\nyourself in that way so you know you\njust i'm doing it for you yeah thank you\ngreat i'm glad you did thank you yeah\nand you talk about this book\nman says for meaning which i had on my\nwhich i had on my bookshelf so i picked\nit up for this session\nyou talk about this book changing your\nlife how did you even come across it and\nhow do i\ni don't know you know i read a lot of\nreally hard books when i was\nin my 20s because i skipped college so i\nwas overcompensating in a major way\nbecause my family is\nuh you know they all did go to college\nso i didn't want to be like the one that\ndidn't go and not have my\nwits about me so i read a ton and that\nwas just one of the books i mean that's\na book that so many people have read and\npeople quote from all the time but it\nreally just\nit was an aha moment reading that line\nout of a book which is something my dad\ntold me to do at a very young age like\ntake one line out of every book even if\nyou don't like it\nand that that that you take with you in\nlife that you think about you know what\nyou mean and contemplate\nand you know when i was a kid i was like\nplease just shut up like i would just\nmake up lines you know out of anna karen\nand i'm like here this line right here\nbut that book was the first book that i\nsaw the line and it was\nyou know stop asking what life expects\nout of you and start asking\nuh oh no stop asking what you expect out\nof life and start asking what life\nexpects out of you something along yes\nyes yes that's it yeah\nand i was like wait what i was like wait\nwhat's life expecting for me\nit's like you grow up and you think you\nwant and you're greedy\nand you want this and you want success\nand you want money and you want\nhappiness and all of whatever you want\nand you're never i never thought what is\nlife expecting from me\ni'm just like they're lucky to have me\nthat's my attitude\ni'm a blessing to the world right yeah\nand then no that's\nabout yeah no i love that and that is a\nbeautiful piece of advice from your\nfather like i i think everyone is\nlistening or watching the podcast right\nnow\nmake sure you do that because i think so\noften we feel like oh i have to finish a\nbook to understand it\nand you know we we play so much emphasis\nlike what you said at the beginning of\nthe show uh beginning of the\nepisode you were talking about it's\nalways about results i'm always like oh\nhow many books have you read\ndid you get to the end of that book and\nactually you could just take one line\nout of every book\nand it could be transformed there was\nthe one book that i've never finished\nwith salman rushdie midnight's children\nbecause i couldn't i didn't understand\nwhere the hell the man was or the boat\nor\ni didn't know what continent we were on\ni was reading that and i'm like i can't\nfinish and i had such like ocd about\nfinishing books as a child growing up\nyeah um that i i always did finish\nit was the first book i did not finish\nwith simon rushdie i was like i can't\ni don't know what this is about and i\ncannot finish it i mean kierkegaard was\neasier to get through\noh wow yeah yeah no and i i've had\nplenty of books that i've never read\nfront of uh back to front but i found so\nmuch value in like it's not about that\nright it's about taking like i always\nthink now oh if something's in front of\nme like an article or somebody forwarded\nme something like there's something in\nthere for me so just read it\nor watch the video for as long as you\ncan and try and just grab something from\nit you know absolutely so\nsometimes it's like really kind of\npeople are putting stuff in front of you\nit feels like oh wait\nyou're supposed to see it you know and\ni'm not into that\nall of that stuff but i definitely think\nthat their energy makes a big difference\nin this world\nit does and i'm really glad you said\nthat because i love how in the book\nand i share this with you because i'm\nborn and raised in london i grew up as a\ncomplete rebel until the time i was\n18 most of it still lasted till 22 when\ni became a monk finally\nbut i i started off in a very\nunspiritual environment\nwas never fascinated by spirituality or\nanything of that sort i studied\nbehavioral science at business school so\nthe brain and the mind for me is where i\ncome alive and love talking about\nresearch and all the rest of it\nbut i love how you call out the\nsuperficial use of the word gratitude\nuniverse crystals for the sake of it not\nnot offending anyone but i like the\npoint that you make very strongly that\nthat's not really it and i kind of feel\nlike what service\nwhat disservice do you think that does\nto this wisdom that you've now opened up\nyourself because i guess\nyou and others may have been pushed back\nby that kind of yeah i definitely have\nbeen yeah\nbut i mean that's la i think la is very\nspecific to you know it's not like\nyou know you people think that yeah it\nis a turn off in a way for me it\ncertainly was it was a turn off for like\ntherapy i just group it all together you\nknow therapy crystals colonics like no\nthanks before you came in today\nso like i just don't but i'm sure watch\ncatch me in two years i'll be like you\nknow\nshoving crystals up my ass this is\namazing i love it i mean\ni've definitely gone down the road of\nevery trend and fad in la i mean\nsome a lot less than others you know\nwhat i mean which ones have you gotten\nlike you know uh i've tried i mean\ni haven't gone off the deep end in the\nway that my like you know girlfriends\nhave but like i've\nyou know cleansed for five days or you\nknow fasted for five days i've done\nyou know diets and all sorts of things i\nmean i guess i don't have the\nstick-to-itiveness that i\nthat my friends do with this stuff but\nyeah i usually lose interest like two to\nthree days in when it's like something\nsilly or i'm drinking charcoal or you\nknow what i mean\nlike yeah that's for white and teeth is\nthat what it is no it's not sure\noh right i think it's for a colonoscopy\nso i have no idea why i would be\ndrinking it at home\num but there's just a lot of things in\nthis you know like healers\nyou know that's a great thing\nbut it's not as big of a community as\npeople make it out to be you know what i\nmean there are real healers and then\nthere are not real healers\nand there are you know all sorts of\nvarying degrees of in this town\nso it's just important to make sure you\nknow like you're not\na and how have you separated that\nlike how\nhave you gone through it because i think\nthat's useful i like what you're saying\nright now\ni think so many people will agree with\nthat especially people who've come\nacross\nthe community the tribe the space\nwhatever it may be what's been your way\nof just calling out stuff and saying\nthat's not real that doesn't work well i\ndon't really call it out i just like\nwhether it works or not for you is up to\nyou so like if i had a better attitude\nand a less cynical attitude and i went\nto a psychic and i wanted to believe all\nof it then great i could live in that\nhubris for the next five days and maybe\nit's real or not\nbut like i don't want to do that anymore\nlike that's not a good use of my time i\ndon't\nthink that i need you know what i mean\nlike i can\ni there are things that i find\ninteresting i don't call it out i don't\nwant to put people down for what they\nbelieve in\ni mean unless they're you know\nridiculous friends and i could just say\nit to them which\nusually i try to do but i try to do less\nup now\nbut i think that you just say no you're\nnot into it you know what i mean like\nmy friend just opened a korean spot and\ni was like you got to come you got to\ncome and i go buddy i'm just not into\ngetting my face and my body scrubbed by\na bunch of\nwomen like it's not my thing i like\nmassages\nopen up as a massage spa and i'll come\nlike you just kind of say no and it's\nnot personal it's just my preference\nyeah now i'm really happy you came on\nthis podcast because you could have just\nbeen like to me no i'm not coming on\npodcast yeah i couldn't i don't like i\ndon't like spiritual podcasts yeah\nright right but here i am well here you\nare so i feel better than your friend\nwith the korean spa\nhow did tell me about some of you\nalluded to it then what are some of the\nthings that have changed habits wise\nlifestyle wise you just said that i try\nand do it less like being less reactive\nmy thing is i was always telling\neverybody the truth ad nauseam like\nwhether they wanted it or not\nyou know it didn't have to be like\nsolicited and i just\nwas like this loudmouth and i finally i\nwas just like\nwho do i think i am like cool it why am\ni inserting myself and having like these\nstrong opinions based on very little\nknowledge\nyou know and so i think after a while\nplus i just got burned out you know with\neverything\nand working so hard and so fast without\ntaking a look around and missing kind of\nthose integral moments that you want to\nremember and have valuable time with so\nthe thing sorry\ni'm rambling no no no answer your\nquestion the things that have changed\nwell i meditate now\nmy doctors say commit to three months\nand so i've i've done\nit and i'm like now into it like i do 15\nminutes a day\nyeah 15 minutes a day which is big for\nme it's amazing um\ni am less reactive i don't say what's\noff the top of my\nyou know my i don't know how have you\nstopped that one because that sounds\nhard i just it's so much cooler to just\nsit back and not say anything when\nsomebody\nyou know you don't have to like correct\npeople or tell them what's right it\ndoesn't matter\nlike just chill out i mean i take a lot\nof cannabis\nalso just so you know like this is part\nof my program because it\nbecause it cut my drinking in half\nmostly and\nthen i realized like the great benefits\nof that so then i got all passionate\nabout that and how it makes you more\npresent and more mellow and like for me\nespecially it's a great ameliorant\num so that's changed a lot i you know\ni'm just more present and i also don't\nyou know when someone sends me a text or\nan email that annoys me or i don't like\ni don't ever respond now like i used to\njust be like\nyou know sitting there typing angrily on\nmy phone and it's like it's not a hot\nlook\nso just cool and like you know cool\nit and relax\nand that's my attitude towards\neverything now yeah so\nbetween the meditation the cannabis the\ntherapy\ni mean i'm killing it i love it i love\nit\nyou're killing life i love it no that's\ngreat it's it's awesome we all know that\nlife is made up of habits and what we\nbreak it down into and\nyou're only going to let go of bad ones\nwhen you take on new good ones so yeah\nit's nice to see that yes 15 minutes\nis huge and it's also it's great to\nrecognize when you feel like you know if\ni feel like i'm losing my patience i\nknow myself now and i'm like\nokay either remove yourself from the\nsituation\nor get your together like you're\nnot going to snap at a person\nyou're not doing any of that you know\nyeah um so that's good\nit makes you feel like an adult more\nwhich is\ni feel like i've never had in my life i\nlove that yeah no i completely agree\nwith you and we still all have our\nmoments where\nwe we do snap or we don't react the way\nwe want to etcetera but it's it's\nit's a marathon right or you leave your\ntherapist and get down and you know to\nthe parking lot and get into an argument\nwith the guy who's parking your car yeah\ni mean that's happened to me where i've\nbeen like\nyou are such a meanwhile\ntwo seconds ago i'm like you know\nmeditating with my psychiatrist and he's\nwatching from the window and shaking his\nhead\nyeah but i said that i remember telling\nhim i go oh my god you should have seen\nme i go i left there and just got in a\nfight with this guy in the parking lot\nand he's like well at least you know you\nlike at least you're identifying it now\nbecause you two years ago you would have\ndone that without thinking twice about\nit like\nnext time don't do it yeah yeah yeah we\nundervalue just identifying\nright we undervalue that we undervalue\nthat because we want to skip from\ndoing something bad to never doing it\nagain and the point in the middle is\nidentification and recognition and\nacknowledgement of a mistake we're\nmaking\nyeah and that's like such an important\nstep yeah i agree with that for sure i\nthink identification\nawareness and modification is an acronym\nthat my guide dan taught me\nwhich is you know identifying the issue\nis half the battle and then you know\nyou're aware of it and then just modify\nit just don't\nreact don't do the thing that you do\nevery single time do something different\nand then before you know it\nthat's your habit yeah and that's\nrehabituating yourself to like all the\npositive things\nfor sure yeah identification\nmodification\nno come on keep up identification\nawareness awareness i am okay\nmodification oh i\nam i like that i'm not ready i'm not\nready\noh no this is good look you're sounding\nlike a psychiatrist now but you just\ntold me you're not ready then what a\nnice\nquestion what a pivot for my career i\nknow now i'll be giving\ngrief counseling therapy sessions with\nabsolutely no degree but on tv\nright on tv to reach more people exactly\nit may work you may know what a\ntelevangelist\ni love it i love it and and with this\nbook i mean\nwriting it must not have been easy i\nfeel uh it wasn't hard it was\ni welcome that kind of like i like a\nchannel you like challenging yourself\nbut yeah i was definitely in a lot of\ndifferent parts of the world crying in\nairports or on planes writing it and\neven rereading it it still was like hard\neven when i did the audio recording it\nwas hard and so\ni'm doing this tour and i'm going around\nthe country uh\nto different uh cities and i'm doing\ninstead of doing stand-up i'm having a\ndifferent celebrity in each part of the\nuh the country\ninterview me somebody who's like sean\nhayes is doing chicago natasha leon is\ndoing new york city and\nso on and so forth so yeah and if you\ncome to that\nyou get a book oh so it's livenation.com\nyou can buy tickets for that it starts\napril 11th in boston oh i love that that\nsounds fun how many cities are you doing\n20. oh wow yeah okay brilliant that's\ngonna be a lot of fun so yeah wherever\nyou are\nin the us you can head over are you\ndoing anything in the uk as well\nno not the uk yeah not yet right you\nhave to you know already\nyeah already everyone in london england\nyeah that would be a real wake-up call\nin london\nno can you imagine that you think you're\ncynical the cynicism in england is\nhuge having grown up in london my whole\nlife like\nthe the amount of cynicism around\nself-growth personal growth personal\ndevelopment\nis huge like one of the things i found\nrefreshing when i moved to new york\ntwo and a half years ago now and then\nwhen i moved to l.a where so many people\nwould say i was just with my therapist\nthe other day\ni've never heard that in my life living\nin england like that's a big cultural\ndifference yeah for sure\ni have a british friend who lives here\nand she's like oh my god you know\nshe's like everybody's all therapied out\nhere\nyeah yeah meanwhile cut two she'll be in\ntherapy and with that oh she's not yet\nat two weeks\nshe's not you oh no she is oh she is\nokay okay she is she is yeah it seems to\nbe positive and it's\nit's about finding that right person\nthat's how i've always felt about it\nthat it's\nit's finding that right person and then\nit just it's just waiting\ni guess until you feel you can be honest\nwith someone yeah right until you keep\nlying\nokay so one of the things i want to talk\nto you about that you bring up a lot in\nthe book is this feeling of what empathy\nreally is\nand how so often we\nwe think we're showing ourselves crying\nfor other people or feeling for other\npeople but really we're just doing it so\nthat we can be seen that way\nwell some people no i mean i don't speak\nfor everybody but for me\ni was i was sympathetic but i lacked\nempathy\nlike i was explain the difference for us\nsympathy is like if you see somebody a\nhomeless person who needs money you give\nit to them but\nempathy is actually thinking about about\nwhat it is like to be a homeless person\nasking for money like putting yourself\nin that person's shoes\nso i'm great at showing up in a crisis\nand being like an\nyou know a fixer and doing all of that\nstuff but i was never really\ncon considering what that person was\ngoing through you know i want to do the\nband-aid and fix them up and patch them\nup and i want everything to be back to\nnormal because\ni you know know how to fix a bad\nsituation because of my brother dying so\nlike\nthat led to me to kind of never think of\nempathy like i had to ask\nwhat the distinction was as well and um\nso it's it's eye-opening and once you\nidentify again that you\ndon't have something or you're that's\nnot your like you know\nmuscle that you've been using and you\nlook out for it\nthen you're already in you know what i\nmean you're already so much better off\nyou just have somebody tell you i was so\nexcited when he told me like\nthese things that i was missing i'm like\nokay great where do i get it yeah\nlike do i buy it or like what you know\nand or do i\nyou know build it and so that\nis great what's great the powerful like\nyou know the power of the human mind and\nhow you can create stuff that you have a\ndeficit in so to speak\nyeah i love how the book oscillates\nbetween playful and profound\nand i was wondering how your the\ncomedian in you has transformed through\nthis journey\nbecause i guess that's been such a\nstrong part of your identity for so long\nyeah but yeah yeah i don't know i mean\ni think it's very funny yeah no it has\nto be for my readers i wouldn't want\nthem to read to something and expect\nsomething from me that doesn't deliver\non that front i mean it's going to be\nmuch deeper than people had uh probably\nexpected\ni think that too playful but it's yeah i\nthink it's a for me i can't digest\nanything too serious i need funny like a\nlittle bit you know what i mean and\nthere's already been too much\nseriousness with this\nwith the election and politics it's too\nmuch like i needed to get away from all\nof that and\nfocus on something that i'm gonna do\nwith my life and\nother people that you know what i mean\nlike i want to really\ndo something and make a difference in a\nway so it's about that\nand yeah yeah it is a challenge that we\nfill our lives\nspeaking about thinking about and\ngossiping or talking about something\nthat we don't like\nit is funny how that just evolves so\nquickly we like the negatives\nyeah we just find that every one of our\nconversations everyone on our meetings\nends up being about what we don't like\nand hence we're not building or putting\nenergy into anything practical\nlike you're saying you need to get away\nfrom it i mean that's one of the things\nso\na lot of people say to me like with the\nvideos i make online like why do you\nthink that's working or whatever in the\nlast couple of years that i started\nmaking content\nand a lot of the feedback i think is\nbecause people want to move away from\neverything else that they see on social\nand everything that they\nsee on the news yeah they're looking for\nright yeah yeah people want alternatives\ni mean there was just a stat that came\nout about alexandria ocasio-ortez\ngetting more twitter and all of her\nbench tweets are positive\nand they did some you know saying that\nshe's getting as much\nmore attention than donald trump for all\nthe positivity she's creating versus his\nnegativity which is good\ngreat let's go with that yeah yeah let's\ngo with that absolutely that was the\narticle i was sharing as well\nthat ink did that piece on the 777\nmillion facebook posts\nof 2018 and the most popular ones were\nall positive they were all uplifting\nyeah\n500 were not full of the negativity so\nit shows that there is a shift in\nhumanity like we are changing\nas a whole not just you but your change\nis very well it's i don't think it's\nwe're changing i think people are\ninherently good or inherently bad and i\nthink there's more good than there is\nbad\ni mean i'd like to think that but i also\nthink that it's just more exposed now\nbecause we have the capacity to make\nthese videos\nthat you make you know so well like\npeople have\nthey can spread the love and share the\nlove and they can spread the hate and\nthey can share that too\nso it's just a matter of which one has\nmore people so like\nlet's get everybody on the right side\nlet's shift so this book's gonna do it\nno yeah make more videos yeah this\nshould change everything they should\nchange everything this book is gonna\ndefine now\nbut but it is it is hopeful it is\nhopeful like i\ni don't know how you see it now like\nhaving gone through the process i've got\nwhere are you at with how\nthings are now and how's your viewpoint\nchanged well i think things are moving\nin the past\nwith regard to with regard to the state\nof politics\ni just think optimism is great because i\nthink you know\npositivity is better than negativity and\noptimism and visualization of positive\nthings\nworks i mean like it's just about like\nwhich direction do you want to go in you\nknow which road do you want to go down\ni'd rather be happy you know than than\npissed\nyeah absolutely yeah i think for me it's\nthat feeling of being activated and\nenergized to be a part of that change to\ntry and push forward do something\ndifferent which i see\nyou know and i know we're joking two\nseconds ago about this book changing the\nworld but it's\nit's still someone like yourself taking\na stance\nto say i'm choosing this side i'm going\nthis way and i think that's important i\nthink the more people that\nchoose to do that with their platforms\nand everything will will help people\nmove that way because it's you\nverbalizing your choice\nright to everyone which you could have\njust made to yourself\nwhat made you want to do it for everyone\nelse like what made you want to\narticulate this to other people\ni think my just experience with my\ntherapist i thought you know i was\ntaking time the year off and all i was\ndoing was like campaigning for people or\nthrowing fundraisers at my house to try\nand you know flip\nthe house in 2018 so\nduring that time i was like all right\ni'll go to therapy while i'm doing it\nand then after like a couple of months i\nstarted writing stuff down i'm like wait\na second\nthis could help people that can't afford\nto do this this could help people who\nhave that childhood pain that they can't\nunlock and they don't know why\nthey're failing at things in their life\nas a result of it\num or why how it's in fact you know\nimpeding themselves you know their\ngrowth so then i started writing it and\ni was like oh this is\nreally personal like no one's going to\nwant to read this it's too personal it's\nlike\nyou know it's a bummer it's like you\nknow some there's a lot of death in the\nbook\nand and then i my editor just kept\npushing me she's like i think you need\nto just write what's happening with you\nright now like write it all\nlike i don't care if it's i'm like this\nis gonna be a death book like this is no\none wants this\nand she just kind of pushed me to do it\nand then through it i was like this is\nexactly what i should be writing about\noh my god and then i was like oh wow\nthis is gonna be\nsome something people can look to who\ndon't\nyou know who have the same feelings\nsince i wrote it\nand since i recorded the audiobook i've\nheard like two\nother people just in passing people i\ndidn't know\nwith the same identical stories as me\nso i can't even imagine how many people\nare out there 100\nand i think that's so true that when we\nput out a story it attracts that\ncommunity together\nyeah you have that same story and\nexperience which we think\noften that we're the only ones who are\nhaving that experience but it is shared\nit is a shared experience yeah it's\nshared and that's where the strength\ncomes in you know what i mean that's\nsuch an energy attraction because people\nare so\ninto you know commiserating with other\npeople and finding out\nthat they're not alone like no one is\nalone\nwhat you've experienced someone else has\nexperienced such a powerful point yeah\nso true never feel alone yeah\nthere are so many people going through\nthe same thing and i mean the book does\nfocus on\nhave a lot of death in it but also you\nyou dedicate two chapters to your dogs\noh yeah uh and i thought that three i\nhave three dog chapters three dog\nchapters okay three times two\nthe brother and sister only deserve one\nchapter plus they're so they\ndon't get their own chapters\nbut the other two yes god rest their\nsouls\nthey deserved it chuck for sure deserves\nhis own chapter\nyeah tell us about how much joy they've\nbrought into your lives how long have\nthey been around\noh i have these two idiot dogs now\nthey're like a bro\nbrother and sister named bernice and\nbertrand i did not name them so\nobviously i went to i like chow chow\nmixes so i went to a shelter\nnorth of la like two hours north and she\nhad a bunch of\nchild mixes and then she's like but i\nhave a brother and sister named burt and\nbernice and i was like i don't even need\nto see them\nlike those are my dogs bring them to me\nand then she's like oh we have to do a\nhome inspection\nand i thought what oh my god you don't\nreally but\ni thought you know i would let you go\nthrough my taxes with a friend's\naccountant if it meant i could have\nthese two\ndogs named bernice living at my house\nthey're like little lions\nand i can't wait to see them yeah he's a\nbig fat baby and she's a big fat\nshe's a big fat so i'm happy yeah\nthey're very challenging they love my\ncleaning lady they don't\nwant to be alone with me oh wow unless\ni'm in a car and then they'll go\nanywhere with me so that's how i have to\nlure them it's been a real\nbait and switch operation at my house oh\namazing and my brother or my nephew\nmoved in and he's got an australian\nshepherd so we have three dogs now wow\nyeah wow do you think that they're there\nany do do you have any thoughts on like\ndogs positivity yeah well they are\npositive\nfor sure good friends and yeah i mean i\nlike people that like dogs\nright nice nice i like little dogs\nit took me a while because growing up in\nan indian household the closest thing\nyou have to a pet is a fish which i\ndon't think really counts\nand then when i moved to the u.s and i\nhad so many friends who had dogs i was\nlike oh okay now i'm going to figure out\nwhich types of dogs i like i like small\ndogs yeah that's kind of where that's\ngood that you know that\nyeah i know that i'm self-aware i'm\nidentifying\nyeah awareness and then modification i'm\ngoing to remember that now i\nam i
