    "transcript": "what i want to get into now is that\nreally practical aspect of like\nbreaking that pattern right because\nthat's where most of us\nare we have that negative self-talk we\nhave the victim mindset\nwe have the i'm busy i've got too much\ngoing on\ni am overwhelmed i'm experiencing\nanxiety it's that person at work\nit's my partner like we have that that's\nreality\nof where we are today yeah how do we\nbreak that pattern\nin a way that actually makes a\ndifference and is easy enough as a\nstarting point\nyeah it's been said that you should\nmeditate for 20 minutes a day\nunless you're really busy then you\nshould meditate for an hour a day yeah i\nlove that\nthat's why by the way that's why i\nmeditate for two hours a day yeah\nso look i mean um information is what\nopens that door i mean\n[Music]\nif you think that your thoughts have\nsomething to do with your future\njust from a theoretical standpoint that\nyour thoughts\ncreate your destiny and you think 60 to\n70 000\nthoughts in one day and 90 of those\nthoughts are the same thoughts as the\nday before\nwell then your life isn't going to\nchange very much as long as you're\nthinking the same way\nand those those same thoughts lead to\nthe same choices the same choices lead\nto the same behaviors\nthe same behaviors create the exact same\nexperiences\nand we anticipate the same feelings or\nemotions\nfrom those experiences and those\nemotions are the payoff that drive our\nvery same thoughts well our biology our\nneurocircuitry\nneurochemistry our hormones and even our\ngene expression\nwill be equal to how we think how we act\nand how we feel\nand how we think how we act and how we\nfeel is called our personality\nand our personality creates our personal\nreality that's it\nso the present personality who's\nlistening to this show\nhas created the present personal reality\ncalled their life\nso if you can latch on to this idea if\nyou want to create a new life\na new personal reality you got to change\nyour personality which means you better\nstart\nthinking about what you've been thinking\nabout and changing it you begin to\nbecome conscious of your unconscious\nactions or habits or behaviors and\nmodify them\nand then we have to begin to look at the\nemotions that we live by every single\nday\nthat are keep us connected to the past\nand decide do these emotions belong\nin our future so most people are trying\nto create a new personal reality\nas the same personality and it doesn't\nwork you literally have to become\nsomeone else so the principal\nneuroscience says that nerve cells that\nfire together wire together\nyou keep thinking the same way making\nthe same choices demonstrating the same\nhabits creating the same experiences\nthat stamp the same networks of neurons\ninto the same patterns\nall for the familiar feeling called you\nand you do that for 10 years on end\nyou're gonna begin to hardwire certain\npatterns in your brain that becomes your\nidentity\nand by the time we're 35 years old it\nkind of becomes\nfixed right then psychology used to say\nthat you can't change that but\nwe now know that you can so then that\nkind of\nbox in the brain that is the habit of\nourselves it's a\nuh we're 95 of the time running a series\nof programs so then\nsitting and doing the work we have to\nbecome\ndisentangled from those programs and so\nthe moment you decide to do something\ndifferently or make a new choice\nwhat most people don't want to face is\nthat discomfort\nand that that discomfort that that\nuncertainty that\nlack of predictability the that that\nthat unknown is what people are afraid\nof because they'd rather\nlive in guilt at least they can predict\nwho they're going to be then take a\nchance in possibility\nso when a person begins to understand\nthis and you say well\nhow long have you been this way and they\nsay i've been like this for 35 years and\nyou say\nwhy 35 years because 35 years ago i had\nthis one event\nwell the stronger the emotion you feel\nfrom reaction from that event the more\naltered you feel inside of you\nthe more the brain narrows its focus and\nfreezes the image\nand takes a snapshot and that's called\nthe memory right so then\nforget the memory just overcome the\nemotion because it's the emotion that\nkeeps you anchored to the past so\nthat sounds really good theoretically\nbut when you step out into that unknown\ninto that void\nthe body really is in a habit and what\nhabit is when the body becomes the mind\nor if you're thinking about that past\nevent\nand it's producing an emotion well you\nneed an\nimage and a feeling to start the\nconditioning process so the body's\neither conditioned into the\nfamiliar past or it's hardwired in the\npredictable future because it wakes up\nevery single day and runs through the\nsame series of routine actions\nso the present moment then becomes the\nunknown\nwhen people start feeling that\ndiscomfort jay they'd rather get on\ntheir cell phone and call someone or\nget up and say i can't meditate or you\nknow i have too much to do they excuse\nthemselves they return back into that\nfamiliar feeling because\nthe bodies actually telling the brain\nthe\nhabit is when the body becomes the mind\nso the body stepping out into the\nunknown and says ooh\ni'd rather feel guilty i'd rather feel\nunhappy\nthan be in this discomfort so then at\nleast then when they return back to that\nfamiliar feeling then they feel safe so\nthey step out in the unknown and the\nbody starts influencing the mind saying\nyou can start tomorrow\nyou're too busy it's your mother's fault\nyou know it's your culture's fault\ni don't have enough money this isn't\ngoing to work\nthose are the programs in there that are\nstanding in the way between you\nand your future so then nerve cells that\nno longer fire together\nno longer wire together so the act of\nobserving those states of mind and body\nmeans you're no longer the program\nyou're the consciousness\nobserving that program so so then\nto meditate it means to become familiar\nwith so as you become familiar with\nthose thoughts you become conscious of\nhow you speak\nyou become aware of how you act you\nnotice how you're feeling\nthe more conscious you become of those\nunconscious programs\nthe less unconscious you'll go in your\nwaking day why\nbecause it's not enough to just have a\ngreat meditation and get up and get on\nthe freeway and get in traffic and\ngetting stressed\nyou just return back to the old self\nagain our job then\nis to sustain that modified state of\nmind and body the entire day\nand if you can get ready because\nsomething\ndifferent or unusual is going to begin\nto happen in your life and it will come\nas a coincidence or a synchronicity\nand that's breadcrumbs from the divine\nsaying you're on the path just keep\ndoing it\nthere'll be another one just keep\nstaying in that energy\nand so teaching people then\nto understand that there's a formula\nthat we now\nknow that if you apply that formula\nyou'll begin to see those changes and\nnow as people are doing it\nmore and more effectively\nthe results are going up as well we just\nhad bond university they just took a\nwhole bunch\nof my brain scans from 10 years ago\nhuge clinical study a lot of analysis\nand\nand they're blown away by\nthe speed in which the community can\nchange\nbrain or heart coherence they they know\nhow to do it it's not\nuh something that's that's separate from\nthem they've practiced it enough times\nthat\nthey they now know how to do it so\nwhat's the significance of that\nwell really simple in your life\nif you start returning back to the same\nreactions to the same people and\ncircumstances you're returning back to\nthe old self so\nyou got to stay conscious in your life\nand\nand if you're not being defined by a\nvision of the future\nthen you're left with the memories of\nthe past and you will be predictable in\nyour life so\ncrossing that river of change from the\nold self to the new self\nthere's a neurological a biological\nchemical hormonal a genetic\ndeath of the old self but if you teach\npeople there's something on the other\nside\nthey won't give up on themselves they'll\nkeep going so there's enough evidence\nto encourage people and you can't tell\nme you're too old to do this work\nyou can't tell me you're too sick to do\nthis work you can't tell me you had a\nturbulent past or or that you're too\noverweight or too underweight or too out\nof shape or\nyou can't even tell me that you've never\nmeditated before in fact some of our\ngreatest\nscans or people who just have never\nmeditated before that are not trying to\ndo anything they just follow\ninstructions\nso our community now is beginning to\nunderstand that it is possible\nand they go all in not 50 and not\nsixty percent and we do a week-long\nevent we got a thousand people or\nfifteen hundred people and they are\nall in and that when they start getting\nbeyond themselves that first day or\nsecond day\nonce they start getting beyond\nthemselves and that\nmagic starts to happen then i have no\nidea i can't predict\nwhat's going to happen next and it's\nusually pretty pretty exciting it's been\nsaid that\nwhen the pain of staying the same\noutweighs\nthe pain of change then we will change\nyes exactly right how bad does it have\nto get\nyeah exactly and it's like why why is it\nthat we get so\nattached to that old self like what is\nit about is it security is it safety is\nit\nfamiliarity as you said is it what is\nthat that keeps us\nso attached and so focused on something\nthat we don't even like that much i\nthink uh i think we've been\nhypnotized and conditioned into becoming\nmaterialists\ni think um that we define reality with\nour senses and i think that\nis one of the biggest delusions so the\nfundamental question is can you believe\nin a future\nthat you can't see or experience with\nyour senses yet but you've thought about\nenough times in your mind\nthat your brain is literally changed to\nlook like the event has already occurred\nnow the latest research in plasticity\nsays that's absolutely possible\nand can you select a new possibility in\nthe quantum field\nand begin to emotionally embrace that\nfuture every single day\nto such a degree that your body as the\nunconscious mind\nthe objective mind does not know the\ndifference between the experience\nin your life that's creating the emotion\nand the emotion that you're fabricating\nby thought alone to the degree\nthat you begin to signal new genes and\nnew ways\nto change your body to look like the\nexperience has already happened now yes\nthe latest research in epigenetics says\nit's absolutely possible now think about\nthis\nevery day installing the circuitry\nevery day conditioning the body into the\nemotion of the future\nthat your body begins to change to look\nlike it's already happened now this is\nwhere it gets\nfun because now you no longer have to go\nanywhere to get it now it begins to come\nto you you become the vortex or the\nmagnet to your destiny\nso then people who come out of their\nmeditation and they say well i just\nfocused on my wealth why isn't it there\nwell you're not that good if you're\nasking why isn't it there you're back to\nthe old person again\nstay in that state for an extended\nperiod of time\nas an experiment as the scientist in\nyour life\nto keep your energy connected to the to\nthe dream of your future\nand then see what kind of effects begin\nto take place\nwithout moving into impatience\nwithout moving into frustration without\nstarting to analyze why it hasn't\nhappened or when\nthat is the trap of defining reality\nwith your senses so you have the thought\nof your future and you don't see it then\nyou experience separation\nbut people who are practicing this work\nthey have the thought of their future\nand they feel the emotion of their\nfuture\nthey're still connected to it right so\nthat takes practice\nand it's just learning like hitting a\ngolf ball hitting a tennis ball\ndancing the salsa you know crocheting\nwhatever it is\nyou gotta you gotta start out staying\nreal conscious and learning then you get\ngood at it and it gets to be\ninstrumental it gets to be fun and\nthat's\nthat's what i want for everybody that\nthe act of creation\nshould be of blissful playful ecstatic\nloose\nfree process and um and so\ni love the idea of people taking time\nout of their lives\nto prove to themselves that if they're\ndefined by the vision of the future\nthen they're not living by the memories\nof the past and that's where the unknown\nexists so\nmany people the unknown is a scary place\nso they don't see that future\nbecause they're used to seeing that\nfuture with evidence with their senses\nand you have to be able to get beyond\nthat and stay in the unknown\nstay in that discomfort and then in that\nmoment\nto be begin to self-regulate like oh i'm\nstarting to feel a little anxiety ooh\ni'm starting to feel a little\nfrustration that's the defining moment\nwhere your body's going back to the past\nbecause emotions are a record of the\npast\nor you go into routine again so you\ncatch yourself\nit's a victory and if you keep catching\nyourself\nthose victories add up and it's not so\nmuch\nabout your wealth or your health or your\nfreedom or your new relationship\nit's actually about who you become and\nso overcoming the old self\nallows us to become somebody else and\nthere is that\nperiod of transition yeah i call it the\nvoid where there's just not a lot\nhappening\nand you just got to be able to keep\ngoing\nand continuously get to the end of your\nbelief\nwhere most people stop i just had a\nfabulous conversation with someone\nthis weekend broke\nthrough to the other side and now\nthere's so much magic happening around\nthis person\nbut she's worthy now to receive it and\nthat's\nthat that is the key because the\nuniverse only gives us what we think\nwe're worthy of receiving so\nwe got to become initiated into this and\nunderstand it\nthousands of years of programming that\nsays that\nwe have to change things matter to\nmatter you know in three-dimensional\nreality and\nit will take time but to begin to\nconnect to that resource called the\nquantum field and create from the field\ninstead of from matter\nthere's a lot of unlearning that has to\ngo on absolutely and when you're\ncatching yourself\nwhat are you doing are you writing that\ndown are you noting that down are you\nmaking a mental note like\npractically what is someone having to do\nto once they catch it then how do you\ndeal with that\nemotion and anxiety in the moment that\nfeels so heavy that\nfeels so real real and trapping and like\nyou said i was just uh\ni was uh the facebook headquarter\nquarters in menlo park a couple of weeks\nago\ni was testing out their new oculus range\nof virtual reality\nand all the studies by virtual reality\nshow now that you feel the same\nexperience of hanging off the edge of a\ncliff in virtual reality\nand your body displays the same symptoms\nas they would if you were actually\nhanging off clinton yeah\nso just showing how imagination does\nmirror the other way too through virtual\nreality but\nhow that feels so real like our body\ngets when you're stepping out off the\nledge you're doing it as if it's reality\nand so that anxiety feels so real what\ndo you do after catching it what happens\nto that emotion\nwell you know just like anything else\njay i mean it's just like\nin the golf ball you get back into a bad\nhabit again you know\nyou have to really begin to\nmentally rehearse like so you ask\nyourself at the end of your day\ni do this every day how'd i do how'd i\ndo today bro how'd you do\ndid you do good where'd you fall from\ngrace what what what\nwas it that caused you to go unconscious\nfor the rest of the day like what was\nthat moment\nnow if you're a student of life\nyou'll begin to contemplate well it was\nthat person that said that thing then i\nreacted or\nthis i got this email or things didn't\ngo my way and i started feeling angry or\nfrustrated or fearful\nthe next time that happens how could i\nevolve my experience now\nyou may have to search for some answers\nof the best model to build or you may\nactually have a long contemplation and\nstart to go\ngod the next time that happens i think\ni'm going to do this or i'm going to do\nthat or i'm going to plan my behaviors\nand the act of closing your eyes\nand rehearsing what you're going to do\nbegins to install the neurological\nhardware in your brain to look like you\nalready did it\nnow the brain is no longer a record of\nthe past now it's a map to the future\nand if you\nkeep installing that hardware the\nhardware will become a software program\nwhich means\nyou'll just start acting like a happy\nperson why there's no magic there\nyou install the circuitry so that's\nmore important than the news right\nit's more important than answering any\nemail or any text\nit's more important than talking about\nyour past\nor some dinner if you can begin to just\nthink about how you're going to do it\ndifferently that's the building process\nneurologically already so\nnow you have to get conscious in order\nto do that and it takes some time it\nmeans\nyou got to shut your cell phone off you\ngot to close your door you got to take a\nbreak from everything out there\nand begin to practice and so by\nexperience then\nyou start noticing oh here it comes here\ncomes the frustration\nhere comes the fear and now we've given\npeople the tools to be able to\nself-regulate\nto create brain and heart coherence and\nso you see people say\nexcuse me one minute i'm just gonna need\na minute it takes some breaths they get\nback in they connect to the energy of\ntheir future this\nis incidental compared to where they're\ngoing\nso they don't fall from grace they don't\nallow their energy to drop and so yeah\nin the beginning\nit takes a lot because it takes a lot of\nenergy and awareness\nto stay conscious and not go unconscious\nbut if you're persistent\nand you're determined and you're sincere\nyou begin to figure it out\nyou begin to say i am not going to give\nmy power away to that person or that\ncircumstance when i can use it to heal\nor to create a new future\nand so people then won't excuse\nthemselves and say on a hard day\nyesterday i had a fight with my\nco-worker or my ex or\nand i don't feel like doing the work\nwell that's the time to get back on the\nhorse\nyeah because because it's the it's all\nof those times that we\nself-correct those are the most valuable\nmoments to us people\nwho've had profoundly transcendental\nexperiences where they\nwe say got lit up they connected and\ntheir brain goes into\nvery very high coherent states and super\ngamma patterns that are\nway outside of normal and they have a\ntranscendental download or\nconnection that's mystical they look\nback at\ntheir entire life they don't want to\nchange\none thing in their past because it got\nthem to that moment\nthat's the moment the past no longer\nexists now by the same means\nthey look back at their past and they\nsee\nall those tough moments where they\novercame themselves and they fall in\nlove with that person\nthey don't look at the good meditations\nor the things that went well\nthey look they know that it was those\nmoments that got them to this moment\nand i think then that's when they begin\nto understand that\nthat all of the hard work all the effort\nin who we become makes no one can take\nthat away from us so then\nonce we arrive at that level and we\nexperience whatever the dream is or\nwhatever we create\nthe next thing is do it until you fully\nenjoy it and then when it gets boring or\npredictable\nlet's go again let's do something else\nyeah and i think that's evolution\nif you want even more videos just like\nthis one\nclick on
