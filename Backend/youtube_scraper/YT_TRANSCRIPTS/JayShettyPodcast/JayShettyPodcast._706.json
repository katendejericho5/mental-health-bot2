    "transcript": "the biggest thing is if you're trying to\nmarch down a path of self-improvement\nwithout clarity without a terrifying\nlevel of clarity you're never going to\nmake it\nand when people say that your network is\nyour net worth that's partly what they\nmean\nis like oh who you know it's not what\nyou know it's who you know that's part\nof it for sure and that's valuable\nbut the other part is like well if you\nhave people in your network\nthat know something you don't and can\ntell you\nand you can hear it that would be\nlife-changing\nthe timing is everything absolutely and\nliterally we were at a conference what\ntwo weeks ago now i think yeah yeah yeah\nand\ntom talks about hard work and if you\nlisten to tom he'll talk about how if\nyou want to stand out in the noise you\nhave to put in the work\nyou have to be working harder than\neveryone else around you tom\nworked harder than every speaker there i\nthought i was going to work hard that\nweekend i think i came second\nbut but tom literally worked harder than\nevery single person there he was in all\nthe meet and greets he spent time with\neveryone he answered everyone's\nquestions your work ethic man\nit's admirable but but more importantly\nit's real because you've got to love it\nto do that much\nyeah that well said you've got to love\nit to do it that much or\nhere's the bad news you actually don't\nhave to love it to do that much but you\nwill burn out\nand so one thing that i worry and\nactually worry about this is my message\nso i used to post a lot about what time\ni was waking up i'd show myself in the\ngym sometimes at like 2 a.m\nand so people started setting an alarm\nand i'm like\nwhoa whoa whoa like that's not what this\nis like i sleep as much as i need to i\nprioritize sleep so\ni stopped doing that because i didn't\nwant people to lose sight of what i'm\nreally saying which is that fulfillment\nis the punch line\nso if we can just literally skip to the\nend of like the whole thing that we're\ngoing to talk about like\nall of life the success that people are\nchasing they think they want money and\nfame and all of that\nand those things can be very valuable in\na way but they\nthey aren't the punch line of life so\nthe punch line of life is how you feel\nabout yourself when you're by yourself\nthat's it like that's all any of us\nhave and the only thing any of us are\never haunted by are when we feel like\nwe've let ourselves down or not lived up\nto who we wanted to be\nand so i have chosen to value\nhard work and discipline and so because\nof that\nit's like i've cultivated cultivated\nthat around myself and you know is\nsomething that i really want to give\nbut what i want people to hear in my\nmessage about like working hard and\ndiscipline\nand all of that is the only reason that\ni put as much time and energy into it is\nbecause i love it\nso me trying this method\nin something i don't love i've lived\nthat i know where that ends and it ends\nwith me quitting\num and you know that's something that\ni'm sure we'll get into later but it was\nlike i did that the first six and a half\nyears of my journey as an entrepreneur\nwere\nabout the typical grinded out stuff and\nlook man it it was an important phase of\nmy life but it ended up\nreally chipping away at my soul and\ni flirted with depression just enough in\nmy life\nto know how dangerous it is and\ndangerous because it will literally lead\nto somebody killing themselves\nor just dangerous in that yeah sure you\nlive a normal lifespan but you hate\nevery minute of it and so\njust really understanding how you get\nout from under that\nand like lesson number one love what you\ndo\nabsolutely man and you've said it before\nthat when you started out there was a\ntime when it was just about money\none was just about getting rich that's\nit i used to repeat that over and over\nand over\nwhat i just want to get rid of i just\nwant to get rich that's what this is i\nkept saying to my wife i'm going to make\nyou rich i'm going to make you rich i'm\ngoing to make you rich like\nit was it was the core of my identity\nfrom the time i was probably pre-teen\nbecause this was tied to my desire to be\na filmmaker\nwas film was i knew like inside i\nidentify as an artist far more than i do\nas an entrepreneur\nand i was looking at okay i love poetry\nand i love filmmaking\nwell there's no money to be made in\npoetry but i could become truly wealthy\nin filmmaking so that for me was a\ncreative endeavor that i could also\ngenerate tremendous wealth and so that\nput me on a path\nwhich of course was part of the reason\nthat i went into being an entrepreneur\nin the first place was\ni needed to control the art i needed to\ncontrol the resources so\ni had to like learn business and so\ngoing down that path and really\nrealizing what it took to\nbuild a business and all of that which\nis a whole universe unto itself\nto have the will to push through all of\nthat difficulty it was i'm going to get\nrich i'm going to get rich i'm going to\nget rich\nand then just realize that maybe for\nscrooge mcduck\nwho wants to swim in his money that\nwould be like a self-sustaining\nmotivation\nbut somebody even like a warren buffett\nat the end of the day it\nmoney means something to him and it's\nthe thing that it\nmeans that drives him it isn't the money\nin and of itself and the problem was i\nwas\nliterally chasing money in and of itself\nyeah and it's fascinating to see someone\nand this i know about you to be\nreflective enough and aware enough to be\nokay to switch\nbecause i think the sunk cost bias in us\nthe part of us that's just so invested\nand has built success with that mindset\nto some degree\nbut actually your success didn't come\nfrom that mindset it came from switching\naway from it\nit came from yeah a willingness always\nto switch so\ni heard a quote one time and it so\nterrifies me this in fact\nover a long enough time period people\nare going to hear this quote from me so\nmany times because seriously man i'm not\njoking\nthis scares me and it scares me enough\nthat it\nit has a daily place in my life and that\nis\ngenius is a young man's game\nand when i heard that quote i thought\nwhoa the one thing that all of us touch\nfor the briefest of moments is youth and\nif you're lucky\nwhat you'll get is a whole lot of middle\nage and then some old age but you don't\nget a lot of youth\nand so i just thought oh that's really\nscary and they were basing it on the\nnumber of people that win nobel prizes\nit's almost always for work they did in\ntheir 20s and 30s almost always\nand i thought i don't like that and so\nlooking at why that and the reason i\nguess this is important to say the\nreason that i didn't like it was i felt\nthat my youth was really\nwhipping by and i hadn't accomplished\nthe things that i wanted to accomplish\nso if i'm you know my youth is wishing\nby me\nhow do i make sure that i can access\ngenius\nat any time that an on a genius\nshorthand for like\nplaying at the absolute best of your\ngame and really changing things like\nreally having an impact and this is one\nthing i think you and i share\nlike no [ __ ] i want to have impact\nin the world so\nif i just wanted to be rich lisa and i\nwould have bought an island and retired\nyou know years ago um so clearly\nthere's something more that's motivating\nme and that thing is impact and really\ntouching lives\nso it's like wanting to be able to do\nthat i don't want to say well i had this\nbrief window\nin my youth and either did or didn't\nmake use of it but even if i did i don't\nwant the rest of my life to be looking\nback\non that so another quote that drives me\nyour future should always be bigger than\nyour past\nso all right you've got genius as a\nyoung man's game and\na personal belief of mine that you you\nshould always be looking towards doing\nsomething more than you've ever done\nand so you put those two together and i\njust knew i had to\nsolve for that problem and the only\nsolution that i have for it is switching\nthings up like you said\nto live at the edges and the same book\nwas talking about the people that do\nend up getting either multiple nobel\nprizes or prizes for work they did later\nis it's people that would routinely\nchange so that they would have these two\noverlapping\nareas so like chemistry and physics and\nlike where those two meet like there's\nnew discoveries and new ways to\nchallenge your own thinking\nand so always staying fresh always\nchallenging my own thinking\nalways looking at how am i wrong most\npeople go into\nan endeavor with the confirmation bias\nin fact you just brought that up so it's\nlike i'm so aware that by nature\nlike everybody i just want to be told\nhow right i am\nhow amazing the way that i'm thinking is\nand because it feels good right that\nfeels\nawesome totally but that's how i'm going\nto calcify into dogma that's how i'm\ngoing to be another statistic\nin the genius is a young man's game\nthing so\ni'm just always looking for disc\nconfirming evidence i'm always\nencouraging people in fact there's a\npart of every monday team meeting at\nimpact theory\nwhere it's take a minute and not just me\nbut take a minute and point out anything\nin the company that's going\nwrong so we can address it we call it\nprinciples from ray dalio's book\nand that is so instructive to get that\nlike raw\nfeedback and quite frankly sometimes\njust naked criticism about where you are\nso that you can get rid of a blind spot\nwell i like that\ni'm gonna have to ask you to do that for\nme oh man it's it's super important\nso this is really interesting and um i\ndon't know the structures of your\ninterviews well enough to know if this\ntangent will pay off\nbut like just talking to you now as a\nfriend if we can\nget to that place where um because you\nand i share a very similar vision of who\nwe want to be and i don't know if you're\ntalking publicly about what you told me\nbefore we started rolling so i won't say\nit\nbut your vision of where you want to go\nand the type of person you want to\nbecome is so extraordinary and i promise\nnobody gets it\ni have the chills so like that's gonna\nbe really cool\nand i have a similar sort of big vision\nof who i'm trying to become and i don't\nthink anybody really understands about\nme either\nand so if you can find somebody high\nlevel who has that desire to push and\nprogress themselves\nthat you can get to really know [ __ ]\ngive you that kind of feedback\nis so powerful and when people say that\nyour network is your net worth\nthat's partly what they mean is like oh\nwho you know it's not what you know it's\nwho you know that's part of it for sure\nand that's valuable\nbut the other part is like well if you\nhave people in your network\nthat know something you don't and can\ntell you\nand you can hear it that would be\nlife-changing yeah so\nman i'll i'll take that like if if\nyou're sincere\nyou can you can sign me up i'm being\nserious man i think i think we all need\nit and like you're saying it just gets\nharder and harder and harder as you go\non i was just saying the other day to\nsomeone\nand my structure with these podcasts for\nme\nreally is to have a conversation beyond\nan interview yeah\nbecause i learn so much more when i'm\njust hanging and actually that's when i\nhave the best conversations\nand i have a format i have my questions\ni know you well enough of research but\ni'm like\ni want to go beyond structure i love\nflow state my videos are created in flow\nstate i'm\nfascinated by when i go beyond checking\nand filtering\neverything that i'm saying and hearing\nand trying to match everything you say\nwith what i've read a million times\nbecause that again is giving me\nconfirmation bias right\nhow am i able to can i take all that\naway\nand and hear from you differently yeah\nand and not judge or filter everything\nyou say and box everything you say\nand and learn more from it so i mean\nthat that leads me on a quote when\nyou've been\nsharing two quotes the first quote that\ndid come to my mind\nwhich i've never said to myself so i'm\ngonna share it is\nyou know youth is wasted on the young\nlike we hear that too\nwe hear that too at the same time which\ntotally goes against the genius one you\nspoke about\nyeah well that one is coming from a very\nspecific place as somebody who's older\nright\nit is the the exact parallel\nto somebody um saying i've got all this\nwisdom now but i've lost the benefits of\nyouth\nyou know not exactly a catchy quote but\nlike that's that's the sentiment that\nit's coming from you know what i mean\nit's like\nand i do feel that way like you know i'm\nlooking at johnny here johnny's 20 years\nold and i think\noh my god if i had\nand and really what i mean there is\nthere there are not only\nphysical things that you can get away\nwith when you're younger look i'm young\nenough and i've\nreally focused on staying in shape so i\ndon't have a lot of deleterious effects\nof getting older\nbut if i had that period of my life\nwhere\nbeing poor doesn't matter and nobody is\nlike holding it against you like he can\nwalk into a meeting and what people are\ngoing to be thinking about is\noh is this the next young turk right\nthey forgive everything else\nbut if i walk in you know at 42\nwith like the same level of\naccomplishment or whatever they think\nokay well\nif he's not married now there's\nsomething wrong with him right the old\nadage so\nit's like there's just the world\nperceives you very differently and so\ni think it's a it's a fair comment like\nhe he honestly like he's in a better\nposition because he's that impact theory\nso i'm hoping it helps\nbut like he doesn't have the context you\nknow what i mean to really know\nwhere he's at in his life what to do\nlike the fact that he and i both dyed\nour hair\nridiculous colors at almost exactly the\nsame age it's like there's just this\npredictable\nin that experimentation phase where he's\ntrying to figure out who he is and make\nsome noise and like establish that\nso now imagine you're already done with\nall that now you're deep wisdom now\nyou're like\nmaking impact how do i make this change\ni've spent decades of my life\nworking on myself and i'm still 20. like\nthat would just be an intense game\nit would that i would love to play it\nwould but i feel like you're still\nplaying it now\ni am in some in some instances and this\nis interesting so\nhere's anybody that knows me that's\nfollowed my content knows i plan\nto live forever and so i emphasize the\nword plan because\none i know that it's not going to happen\nby accident i'm not doing anything to\nmake the medical breakthroughs that are\ngoing to be necessary so right now i am\nwithout question on a collision course\nwith death\nand i know that i'm aware of that but\nalso at the same time i'm structuring my\nlife so that i'm never thinking oh i\nonly have so many years left\ni always think about what's the like\nbiggest impact that i could have\non others and myself i want to for sure\nhave impact\npositive impact on myself as well and so\ni'm looking at it through that lens and\nnot through the lens of my age which is\nvery tempting\nand so i'm you know i constantly issue\nthat but\nthe thing that's conflicting is everyone\nis delusional about death\nand we either obsess over it too much\nand it feels too eminent or you get\npeople like me who\ndeny it so completely that it doesn't at\nall influence\ntheir day-to-day and i do worry\nsometimes that i have so\npushed death off as a reality that\ni may be blind in the moment to\na truth that could be useful and so i'm\nconstantly again looking for\nyou know disconfirming evidence i'm\nconstantly checking that to see like how\nmuch of this is fear of death and just\npure delusion\nand how much of this is really useful\nand i try to stay\ndeep into useful territory by reminding\nmyself i could have an aneurysm before\nthe end of this podcast and be dead and\nthat's real\nwith but don't think short-sighted you\nknow otherwise i would just go\nyou know eat some ice cream and call it\na day\nbut you know to really invest yeah\nabsolutely and anyone who's listening to\nthis podcast right now i hope you're\nenjoying it because\nif you want to know about tom being an\nentrepreneur\nyou can go and find that online if you\nwant to hear about tom\nlearning about how he got funding and\nhow he built a business\nand how he built a strategy you can go\nfind that online\nmy role here is to be the monk that i am\nand speak to tom beyond all of that\nbeing a friend of toms i hope i could\nsay that\noh yeah aggressively being a friend of\ntom's\ni my time with tom has shown me that he\nis an entrepreneur extremely successful\nentrepreneur more than\nmillions of people will ever be but\nbeyond that he has so much more to offer\nyou're a real visionary\nyou really push the boundaries you your\nself-study is\non an insane level and and i want that\nto come out like that's what i want\npeople to hear about and i can hear it\nalready\nand that's what i'm excited for people\nto know you as because to me that's that\nwhy\nthat's that pillar that's what's built\neverything else that's coming from you\nso for sure so far it's so good and i\nreally want to be the poster child\nfor changeability and\na large part of that is because i\ni really just assorted like the raw\nmaterials\num i was not voted most likely to\nsucceed my own mother quietly assumed i\nwas going to fail when i went to college\nshe later confessed that\nuh when i finally asked her you know you\nall but kicked me out of the nest when i\nwas 18 and have spent every day since\ntrying to claw me back like why did you\nencourage me to leave\nand she was like oh i just assumed you\nwere gonna fail and the way she said it\nwas like totally devoid of malice\nit was literally just like i didn't want\nyou to wonder what if\nit was self-evident to me that you were\ngoing to fail and it was that like this\nnotion that it was just self-evident\nand it was self-evident because i was so\nlazy and so\neverybody looks at me and i'm sort of\nthe walking after picture from an\nentrepreneur's standpoint\nand there's no way to show a compelling\nbefore picture\nand so everyone so i was on um\non a podcast not too long ago james\naltucher\nand it was really fun by the way i\nreally enjoyed my time with him\nbut his conclusion was tom you're just\nsmarter\nthan you think you are or smarter than\nyou're willing to admit or whatever\nand i had to laugh because i'm like this\nis where everybody goes they try to make\nme\nspecial instead of going oh that's how\nmuch humans can change\nand when it when it comes to muscle\npeople get it right\nwhen you can show somebody they have no\nmuscle one year\nand then you know 10 years later they\ndon't look like the same\nspecies they put on so much muscle and\nall i'm saying is\nthe same thing is true of the brain and\nyou can make the same kind of\nradical transformations and still be the\nsame underlying person and this all\ncomes back to epigenetic change\nthe reason that humans are the apex\npredator is because of our ability to\nadapt that's it like our\ndna when they first sequenced human um\nthe human genome\nthey thought they'd find some\nextraordinary amount of gene encoding\nor trait in coding genes and what they\nfound was there were only twenty\nthousand\nand so they're like okay we have onions\nthat have forty thousand so are we\nreally supposed to believe that an onion\nis twice as biologically complicated as\na human it just doesn't make sense\nthey were like well there is all this\njunk dna but it doesn't seem to do\nanything and of course\nwhenever scientists say that flash\nforward five or ten years and suddenly\nthey figure out what it actually does\nand that's epigenetic signaling so we\nhave all these genes all they do is tell\nour other\ngenes how much to express based on\nwhat's happening\nin our environment and so the brain is\nas prone to those\nradical changes as is the body and so\nto avoid falling into a depression after\na failure i'll just\nshorthand all of you know a very long\nstory but in film school\nmy final senior thesis which was like a\nmiracle that i got chosen to do it it\nwas like i beat all these odds and i\nthought i was the [ __ ] and i just\nthought i was winning and better than\neverybody\nand then i failed and realized oh\nactually the reason i failed was because\ni don't have talent\nnow for most people and myself included\nat the moment that i had that\nrealization that was for me a permanent\nstate\ni have no talent because i am talent\nless i will always be without talent\nand so i started sliding towards\ndepression because i had no idea where\nmy life was going to go i had this\nvision of me as a filmmaker and now it\nwas just dead\nand so i was like whoa what do i do with\nthat and as a part of this i don't even\nremember how i stumbled upon it but i\nstarted reading about the brain\nand in reading about the brain i\nrealized oh there's this hotly debated\nthis is late 90s there's this hotly\ndebated notion of brain plasticity can\nthe brain change the way the body does\nand i was like i choose to believe it\ncan\nand i don't know that i'm right but it\njust\nthinking that i could get better lifted\nthat dark cloud that had set up\nover my life and at the time i was\nteaching\nand so as i'm teaching i realized well i\ncan help the students make better films\nand if i can help them why can't i help\nmyself\nand so that is the seed that gets\nplanted that turns into\nme going into entrepreneurship and\nself-development and all of that stuff\nand really making just massive radical\nchanges in my life\nabsolutely yeah we start making\npermanent decisions based on temporary\nfeelings\nyeah and we we slot it in and we think\nhe won't change and this one\ni'm so glad you went there because i\ndon't think people know this because\nyou're always interviewing everyone\nthe thing is that you have so much\nstudied and read\nneuroscience and about the brain and you\ncan talk about it\nfrom a really educated standpoint which\nwasn't always the case obviously as\nwe've just found out\nwhat what's the latest thing that you've\nbeen reading or heard or something\nthat's kind of stuck with you from that\nbackground where you've just been like\nthis is what i'm testing right now this\none i'm experimenting with yeah so\nthe the thing that i recently came\nacross that is\num shocking is not gonna be news to a\nlot of people\nbut um have you read jordan peterson's\n12 rules for life okay\nabsolutely extraordinary book his book\nmaps of meaning is actually\neven more impactful but it's dense\nbut when he talked about lobsters and\nhow the serotonin system is present in\nlobsters it's like\ngetting people to understand because\nhere's the other thing that\npeople will mistake in my belief system\nthey think what i'm saying is humans are\njust blank slates we're not\ni wish we were that would be so much\nmore interesting to me that we're\nliterally blank and you can just paint\nanything you want on that canvas\nit's not like that but it is like using\nthe body\nas a metaphor it is like the person who\nweighs you know 135 pounds soaking wet\nand then they\nyou know become a 250 pound just muscled\nout\nstrong as an ox beast like that level of\ntransformation is very real\nand so getting into that and realizing\nhow innate some of these things\nare and so some things aren't about\nchanging or overcoming it's about\nleveraging\nand so once you realize some things are\na game of change some things are a game\nof leverage\nand so leveraging the serotonin system\nfor instance or\nhere's one of my favorite things about\nneuroscience this literally changed my\nlife\nthis affected my marriage and when i\ngive people the answer jay they're gonna\nthink this is so dumb\nbut i'm talking to the six of you out\nthere right now who are actually gonna\ndo this\nthat are watching it it will change\ntheir life dude\nyou ready i'm ready when you\ntake on a facial expression you will\nfeel the emotion no matter what\nwhether you want to or not you will and\nwhen i realize\nthat the brain and the body or any\nfeedback loop\nmeaning that the brain gets as much\ninformation so the vagus nerve i think\n82 percent of the signals running on the\nvagus nerve which is the biggest nerve\nin your body\neighty-two percent is your body speaking\nto your brain\nnot your brain telling your body to do\nsomething your body telling your brain\nwhat's up\nhow to feel sending um signals that end\nup influencing massive amounts of both\nconscious and subconscious behavior\nso it is truly a loop so i used to i\ndon't get angry easily and this actually\nused to really wind my wife up\nand or i should say but\nwhen i did get angry i would stay angry\nso it'd be like\nnothing nothing nothing nothing nothing\nnothing nothing boom now i'm pissed\nand now i'm gonna be pissed for the next\neight hours or a day or two days or\ngod there were times i'd be mad for like\nthree days oh wow\nand i thought it's funny i've\nnever once come out of one of those\nperiods and thought you know what i'm\nglad i was mad that long\nthat was a great use of a saturday with\nmy wife this is really just a smart way\nof living\nevery time i came out and thought this\nwas moronic i don't know what you're\ndoing you're wasting your time\nso i had read this study that said if\nyou hold a pencil in your mouth\nand then have somebody which sort of\nforces you into almost a smile\nand then have people rate their levels\nof happiness they'll rate it higher and\ni thought that can't\nbe true and so the study goes on to talk\nabout getting people to laugh out loud\nand all the stuff\nand i thought okay i'm gonna try it so i\nwould force myself to laugh\nout loud and it would change my mood now\ni felt\nstupid doing it for sure and then but\nabout\nlike six seconds in it's so dumb and so\nridiculous\nand now you're getting that feedback\nloop that it actually becomes real and\nyour mood lightens\nand so i wrote this letter to myself and\ni gave it to my wife to read to me if\never\ni was in a bad mood and she only had to\nread it to me once\nand it worked so profoundly that i\nrealized\ni don't need somebody to read the letter\nbecause the notion of\nand the letter was basically because\nwhenever you're in a fight with somebody\nand they try to soothe you\nyou reject that because you think well\nthey're just doing that because\nthey've done something to wrong me i'm\nlegitimate i have a legitimate reason to\nbe upset\nthey have an incentive a perverse\nincentive to see me\nforgive it so i'm not going to forgive\nit this is real and\nsome deep recess of your brain you feel\nit needs to be punished\nand so in that mode you won't believe\nwhat they say because they have motive\nso i had to read this letter and it was\nlike hey me it's me you know i have no\nmotive in this\ni want nothing other than when you're\nlooking back on this for you to feel\nlike you made the right decision\nand so what i want you to do right now\nis laugh out loud that's it\njust take 10 seconds laugh out loud\nand at the end of that you know it's\ngoing to change your brain chemistry and\ni remember citing the study and i was\nlike you know it'll work\nso just do it and so she read it to me i\nlaughed out loud it felt ridiculous i\ndidn't want to do it by the way i did\nnot want to laugh out loud\nbut the code that i live by is man you\nalways do that which moves you towards\nyour goals\ni want to have an amazing marriage so i\ndid it i laughed out loud and it changed\nmy mood on a dime and i was like i can't\nbelieve this is real\nso that like and it goes on and on if\nyou've read\nyes ramachandran yeah and also oh my god\ncarrie or no karen\njust yeah there's so many cool studies\nlike that there was no punchline to that\njust that\nif people haven't read him he is\nextraordinary\nyeah and i think it was only last year\nthat or a couple of years ago now where\nharvard did their study on power poses\nyeah and they talked about if you stand\nlike superwoman or if you stand like\nwonder woman\nor if you stand like superman then all\nof those things are going to boost your\nmood before an interview or before\nspeaking to a stage of a thousand people\nor whatever it is\ndo you want to get into the like the\nweeds of this let's do it purely\nlet's do it experientially let's do it i\nfind if i'm feeling anxious\nand i try to do power posing it makes me\nfeel exposed\nthere's a reason when you have deep\nlevels of anxiety that you close in\nthere's a protective mechanism but the\nemotional rewards you get is that you\nare\nsafer and i find in moments of like\noverwhelm or\nhigh stress i want to be in small spaces\num\nnothing is more pleasant than sleep like\ni sleep under a blanket fully under a\nblanket blanket wrapped up over my head\nthere is nothing more comforting than\nthat so\nnow what you have to do is train people\nto do that\nnot right at the height of their\nvulnerability this is me speculating by\nthe way just like\nmy gut instinct about having used some\nof this because i have suffered from\nmassive anxiety for years and\nthat one didn't serve me but what\ndid was to use that prior to remind\nmyself to stand up straight or to remind\nmyself to do those poses so that i don't\nfeel\nexposed when i'm in that posture so that\nwhen i'm anxious that becomes something\nthat soothes me\nrather than just makes me feel super\nvulnerable but i find that\nthat stuff and certainly n of one\nexperimentation where you're just\nrunning this stuff on yourself to see\nyou know where are you um is it working\nfor you or not like it may work for one\nperson but not for you\nbut yeah there's really extraordinary\nstuff coming out on the brain\npretty gnarly i love that and i love\nthat you studied that i read one\nrecently that that literally changed\nthe way i work through everything and\nluckily i've read it\ni read it after i came on the show i\nprobably read it in march or april of\nthis year and then started really\nputting it into practice especially\nseeing as\nmy content this year became so much more\nof a commitment than it's ever been\nit was the first time in my life we\nstarted making three videos a week and\n12 videos a month\nand i read a study that said your brain\nyou can't physically be\ncreative and logical at the same time\nthat's interesting right you can't be\ncreative and logical at the same time so\nyou can't really\nbe authentically influenced and creative\nand at the same time\nhave a business meeting and conversation\ntalk about your accounts or taxes or\nnumbers or sales or whatever it is and i\nwas like that's really interesting\nbecause i felt that any time i had done\nthat in the same day so sometimes i'd go\nand i'm sure people listening\ngo from being in a business meeting to\nthen trying to write a script\nto then running back to another business\nmeeting to then trying to have like\na creative time with their wife or\npartner or whatever it is or maybe play\nan instrument\nand i used to find that i could do it\nfor some time but then you start seeing\nburnout\nand what's basically happening is you're\njust stretching your ability\nand you're stressing yourself out and\nyou're just getting tired\nif you are pulling it off right now and\nyou're going jay you're talking nonsense\nbasically you're just getting tired\nand eventually you'll run out so what i\nstarted to do is i started to have\ncreative weeks\nwhere i would be creative for a whole\nseven days\nand that would allow me to go so deep\ninto my creativity i wrote some of my\nbest video scripts at that time\ni got immersed in my creativity and how\ni could really deliver the message\nbetter\nand i was able to accelerate my\ncreativity and then for the rest of the\nmonth\ni'd just be in networking events i'd\njust be in business meetings\ni'd just be connecting with people and\nit just lifted me it just completely\ntook off the\nthe creativity ever feeling like a\nburden or a weight\nand let me just be creative and i was\nsharing that with a lot of creators\nrecently we've been going through mental\nhealth or\nburdens or whatever it may be anyone\nwho's doing something creative on a\nregular basis\ni highly recommend testing it that's\nreally interesting so\nright now obviously there are two sides\nto my life there's the\npublic side that people see me on camera\nall that stuff and then there's that\nwe're building a\nstudio so we're writing comic books\nwe're prepping screenplays and movie\npitches\nand um so that is\nlike there's those two you almost could\ngroup together but then there's the\nother side of\ni have whatever 21 employees and so it's\nlike the\nday-to-day of dealing with hr and you\nknow what are we\ndoing with people's health insurance i\nmean it's just like a thousand things\nlike that right so\nand bouncing back and forth between the\ntwo is\nis very stressful and i'm not deeply\nefficient at switching gears so some\npeople are i'm\nlike whatever the spectrum is i'm like\nway low on the spectrum so going back\nand forth for me is a nightmare\num it's interesting though i've never\nthought to like really chunk it out like\nthat in terms of weeks i've thought\nabout this half day\nor something like that but and i always\nthink of it as project specific versus\nbeing\nproject type which may be even better\nthat's really really interesting i will\nhave to try that out yeah try it out let\nme know let me know what you find from\nit\nit definitely has been working for me\nand i've been trying to hold true to it\nand trying to stop myself from i've been\nhaving two creative days a week for the\nlast\ntwo months wow so i don't do anything i\njust pick up random books write notes\nthink read and it's just it allows me to\nreally get into a zone\nthat's yeah yeah that's sexy\nlike the thought like hearing you\ndescribe it like that like makes me want\nto do it\nimmediately because when you can get\ninto the zone so i think it was einstein\nthat said\num a lot of working hard looks like\nstaring out the window\nand there is some truth to that it's\nlike sometimes you\nyou need to let go like your mind has to\nrelax it's part of the reason that i\nlike meditating so much is you go into\nan alpha wave state so you're calm and\ncreative\nyou're making these far-flung\nconnections in the mind they seem to\ncough up into your consciousness like\nyou're not working for them you're not\nchasing them\nand so like there was something that you\nreally captured when you said you know i\nmight just walk over and pick up a book\nit's like yeah man like you chase that\nthread you pull at that and then some\nidea comes out of it like\ni was talking with my writers the other\nday and we were talking about something\nelse and they said something and i felt\nbad\nthey said something but it clicked an\nidea so hard for me\nthat i didn't hear them lit probably for\n90 seconds\nwhere my mind was just like i was off\nlike chasing that idea\nand like you know that story and what\nthat story would look like and all that\nand then finally\nat about 90 seconds of like being down\nthat rabbit hole i was like guys guys\ni'm so sorry i'm gonna stop because i am\nnot hearing you at\nall like you triggered this hard idea\nbut when you're\nin that mode you're in creativity you're\nsitting with writers you're all talking\nor you can just pick up a book or you\ncan watch a\nmovie or something and just get inspired\nand you're drawing all these\ninspirations in\nit's crazy like where your mind will go\nlike one thing i like doing is going to\nlike a comic-con have you ever been to a\ncomic con i've never been i really want\nto i've been watching i've been\nfollowing you i've been living\nhere's the thing if you're not into\ncomic-cons it'd be a total waste i'm in\nto comics but\nyeah when i go it's like\nit is the the thing that i like about\nthe art form of comics\neven though it has they have\ncatastrophic drawbacks but the reason\nthat it is an art form that has survived\nas long as it has\nis because there's no medium that can\ngive you like\nbig ideas really fast like comics\nlike they've just really figured it out\nan economy of language\num just everything is ultra high concept\nit's\nit's utterly fascinating so when i'm\nwalking a con\nit's like i get into a meditative state\ni will literally walk with my hands\nclasp behind my back\nthere's and i don't know why just\nintuitively i always do that where i'm\nlike almost shutting my body down\ni walk really slowly and i just let\nthe bombardment of ideas hit me and it\nputs me into like the super creative\nspace where\nideas start sparking for me right you go\nlook at a piece of art or you see\na headline on a comic or something it's\ncrazy man\nso yeah getting into that that realm\nwhere you're\nyou know essentially staring out the\nwindow but that's where\nthe work gets done the mental work\nanyway yeah because otherwise we're so\non autopilot\nwe all have morning routines we know\nwhat we're doing\neveryone's running on default and then\neverything kind of just adds up and\nstacks up and yes we're effective and\nproductive\nbut i found that in the focus of being\neffective and productive\ni was losing that raw creativity which i\ncrave and love and\nenjoy so yeah no good i'm glad i'm i'm\ninterested to try\ntry yours too and i i definitely have\nbeen doing that more so the physical to\nthe mental because\ni spent so much of my life mastering the\nmind\nthat i often neglected the body and it's\nfunny because i've kind of come back the\nother way and been like okay no i want\nto i want to bring my body on the\njourney now\nlike i don't want to just let it kind of\nfade away and die\nyou know just in the expense of the mind\nbut okay let's one thing i wanted to go\nwith you\nwas around your self-awareness\nyou're so self-aware you're always\ntrying to be more self-aware\nwhen i see relationship theory with you\nand lisa by the way if you don't know\nlisa biliu\ntom's wife incredible absolutely amazing\nwoman\nlove her instagram stories go follow her\nshe's she's incredible the way she's\ntrying i told her she's one of my\nfavorite instagram storytellers like\nhands down can we for a second dive into\nthat so\nyes she is my wife what i'm about to say\nis not because she's my wife she's my\nwife because i think she's cool\nnot the other way around so she\nis in our company she is the best social\ncontent creator we have\nlike oh for sure i'm including myself in\nthat i don't know what it is\nshe's just got a knack for like\nunderstanding how to be raw and\nvulnerable but in a way that you can\npackage\nyeah which is hard man as soon as you\nstart trying to package it\nyou somehow lose something in it she\nknows how to keep it dude\nso literally i was watching her ig feed\nand i was like damn\nlike it's so much better than mine what\nthe [ __ ] so\ni pinned her down and i was like you\ngotta help me man what you're doing over\nhere is amazing\nand so she was like all right post this\npicture and then just whatever comes to\nyour mind talk about it\nand so she would like start feeding me\nall my throwbacks and my transformation\ntuesdays and all that and she was like\nyou know whatever comes to mind just go\non it yeah\nand so doing that picking like you know\nthe\nthe weird photos of me the ugly office\ninstead of like anything cool that i'm\ndoing like just\nall raw vulnerable like all of it and\nthen just riffing off of it\nit's amazing that's all her man she's\njust crushed it love it i love that you\nguys have documented everything\nit's insane like when i see your\npictures happen even the you know\nphysical changes\njob changes home changes everything it's\nunbelievable to see it all documented\nall of our lives are worse because you\ndidn't take pictures of yourself when\nyou're a mom\ni'm just gonna i'm gonna put that out\nthere i've got two i've got two pictures\nmilk those forever i wish i could having\nthat before to show people even\nand maybe you don't need this but this\nhas been very valuable for me\nis one of uh one of the biggest benefits\nthat i have is i don't live in the past\nso my past sort of um fades\nwhich is wonderful and i read this book\none time i can see by for people not\nwatching this just listening jay is\nagreeing vehemently and i used to be\nreally bothered by this and then i\nrealized oh my god this is why i don't\nhave hang-ups because things just like\ndrift away from me\nand i read this book and it was talking\nabout this character who was immortal\nbut he only had a 10-year memory so 10\nyears is enough to\nform really deep connections so he\nwasn't lacking that in his life\nbut it also has these weird consequences\nof there's no sort of grounded you\nyou were just this ten-year window and i\nthought that's actually really\ninteresting and that feels very much\nlike my life and if we hadn't been\ndocumenting this stuff i've already been\nwith lisa for almost two of these\n10-year cycles\nso when i think back even now to just\nwhen we first got together it's like\nit's fading\nand so having the photos having\ndocumented it having\nvideo where you can really see your\nattitude right where it's not like\nlike when i look back on that and i can\nsee yeah\nthat mopey side that i work to get rid\nof like that was there\nand you see it in the videos and it's\nembarrassing and it reminds you yeah\ni don't want to be like that and so\nhaving that being able to see and be\nreminded or to recapture like whoa we\nreally did start\nwith nothing you know and to to just\nyeah see something that sparks it off\nthat i wouldn't be holding on to anymore\nbut is very valuable for somebody to\nunderstand like no no\nthis is where i started you're seeing me\ntoday 20 years\ninto a journey but this this is what i\nlook like 20 years ago yeah the message\nis even if you have nothing take\npictures\nyeah usually especially especially\nbecause then when you build something\nyou're going to be like i wish we had\ntaken photos at the beginning\ntotally totally i can so identify with\nthat my life's not very well documented\nin pictures or video at all\ni don't know why it just never was a\nconscious decision i\ni never thought i'd be anywhere so i was\nkind of like what am i going to take\npictures for\nbut it's but but now i value and when i\nsee your both your feeds\ni really value it i learn so much by\nreading about both the throwbacks\nthe work the energy the effort and you\nboth live it beautifully but the reason\ni was bringing up lisa\napart from that was i also feel that\nyou are constantly working on yourself\nwhether it's health\nrelationships impact you're constantly\nworking off yourself\nwhat i want to know is how did not did\nhow did you build that mindset but\nwhat is that mindset of constantly\nworking on yourself\nwithout judging yourself to a deeper\nlevel without doing in a way that\nalways pulling you down but always\npushing you up\nand you're doing that in your\nrelationship whenever i watch\nrelationship theory i think the\nconversations you and lisa have\nincredible so it seems like you're doing\nin all areas of your life\nwhich era did it start in which areas\ndid it evolve to let's just break that\nhole\nyeah so let's answer that question so\nwhere did it start and where did it go\nso the honest answer is\nthat like many of the most amazing\nthings in my life they were born of\nmisery\nand i was deeply and profoundly unhappy\ndissatisfied with who i was what i was\ncapable of where i was in life all of it\ni was just\nreally unhappy about it now the one good\nthing\nis i've always met things like that with\nand what can i do\nand i have a bias towards action\nand then i've cultivated that bias\ntowards action which is how it's gotten\nextreme and has permeated into every\narea of my life okay so it starts with\nit's this dark place this\num like i said i failed in film school i\ndidn't fail in film school i graduated\nsecond in my class but there was a\nfailure that was so emotionally\ncatastrophic\nthat everybody else would have been like\noh you got to be like what's the problem\nsure i got to be in the class but i\ndidn't walk away with a\nthesis film that i could use to get a\njob as a filmmaker so\nfor me it was like whoa i just lost\nmassively so\ni'm you know in this very dark place i'm\nbroke as the day is long i can't afford\nfurniture i literally\nsit on the floor in my unfurnished\napartment like that you know just\nit's a normal phase that people go\nthrough but then\nput on top of that that i'm feeling down\nand stuck like i don't know where i'm\ngonna go\npropensity towards action kicks in i\nstart reading i'm learning about the\nbrain figuring out how much of this can\ni change\ni realize i can change it and then that\nchange felt\nso good and even let's do a thought\nexercise\nthis is for people listening because\nyou're already there but for anybody\nlistening\nand you're listening to jay because you\nwant to get there you see something\nwhich by the way you feel when you're\nwith him it is real and i love that\nabout you\nbut like this sense of peace like the\nnormal slings and arrows of life he's\nfound a way to deal with i won't say\nthat he doesn't have them but he's found\na way to deal with it and that's what\nyou're looking for\nso going into that it's like\nif you are in a dark place\nand you hear change is real change is\npossible\ndoesn't that lift your mood don't you\nwant that to be true\nand once you allow it because you have\nto allow it once you allow that to lift\nyour mood and you're like i feel better\njust by thinking i can change that was\nhuge for me that was like\nmoment one was when i realized i\nactually can change\nso this thing that feels like a death\nthreat this like smothering cloud of\njust like despair\nit can clear away and it immediately and\nit's not like oh it went from gray skies\nto blue skies it wasn't that immediate\nbut it was\nit literally immediately a lighter load\njust because i realized i can change so\ni was like whoa\ni can change none of this is a death\nsentence that's\nso like just amazing that was enough\nto get me going and people are always\nlooking for how do i have that energy\ni'm depressed\ni'm down on myself how do i get the\nenergy to push through man you've got to\nfind a way to find energy in that you\ncan change so whatever\nposition you're in right now you can\nchange no matter what it is no matter\nhow horrific no matter what you've been\nthrough no matter what you've done\nlike there is a way out from under it\nbut part of it is\nallowing that sense of lightness to be\nthere so i allowed it and so\nit began to lift off my shoulders which\nthen encouraged me to take more action\nto read more to get better\ni started my obsession with gaining\nskills that reading isn't about checking\na box\nit's about actually getting better at\nsomething that lets you do something and\ni need a better way to explain this\nthis is one of those things like if\npeople really understood what i'm\ntalking about right now\nthis one fact would change their life\nforever you don't get skills because it\nlooks good on the resume\nyou get skills because it lets you do\nthe thing you want to do\nso let's uh let's use sports as an\nexample it's just all too easy not to\nuse it so\nif you want you're in poverty and you're\num lionel messi and you realize actually\ni think\num who's the other one christian\ncristiano ronaldo thank you he was in\nthe grips of poverty\nand nice that's perfect so cristiano\nronaldo in the grips of poverty\nrealizes that playing soccer is a way\nout for him\nand so he goes and gets the skills why\nbecause if he can win\non the soccer field then he can actually\nelevate his family out of poverty\nlike when you see that trail it goes\nback to the nietzsche quote\nif you have a y you can survive almost\nany how\nso how am i gonna get there the the\namount of work that cristiano ronaldo\nhas put in to become\none of the greatest if not the greatest\nthe greatest football player of all time\nis it's inhuman anybody else would look\nat it and say nope not willing to do\nthat and\nfair enough but it was somebody who said\nif i gain these skills\nit will let me dribble around people\nscore when other people can't score\ngalvanize a team around me\nleverage it to be wanted by teams to\nturn into financial resources to make me\nfamous so that i can get brand deals and\nthings like that all the things that he\nwould need to do to\npull himself out of poverty like this\nstuff isn't an accident it's about skill\nacquisition\nso there's another kid that had the same\ndream i'm gonna use soccer to get me out\nof poverty\nand did nothing about it therefore did\nnot have the skills therefore could not\nelevate their family out of poverty\nand looks at it like well this is all\ncircumstance it's not circumstance\nit's cause and effect it's how much\nenergy do you put into\nactually gaining the skills and did you\ngain them or did you just put in the\nenergy and the effort thinking that\nshould be enough to gain it but you\ndidn't actually gain them\nso this is what it's it's like the gift\ni want everybody to receive is\nyou can get good at anything you set\nyour mind to um\nbut do you actually set your mind to it\ndo you have that inhuman level of\nfollow-through do you keep pushing and\nfighting long after it stopped being fun\ndeep into boredom because you have a why\nyou know why you're doing what you're\ndoing and you're just\ndriving towards that and when you have\nthat you can accomplish\nthis extraordinary stuff but i really\nthink people now are doing it for the\ngram\nyou're doing it for the gram you want to\ngo to that thing and do it because it's\nlike oh this is going to look good on my\ngrandma and look i've done that a\nhundred times i get it but at the core\nof my existence is not that\nat the core of my existence is i'm going\nto in the amount of time that i have i'm\ngoing to be acquiring skills\nnow to acquire those skills going back\nto what you were asking me\nit's like you have to be self-aware so\nas a part of the formula\nof knowing that skills have utility that\ni can put that utility to the test in\nservice of something bigger than myself\nthat helps other people\nmakes me have meaning and purpose also\nhelps me generate finances do the things\nthat i want in my life all of that but\nit comes down to that\nacquiring those skills so going\ninto something knowing that like oh my\ngod\nokay first it lightens my load a little\nbit because i realize i can change\nthen i realize these skills actually\nhave utility they're going to let me do\nstuff so now i really want to go\nhardcore into that\nand so i poured my attention and energy\ninto making\nthat emotionally rewarding we all get to\ndecide\nin fact i will be writing a book about\nthis we all get to decide what our\nvalues are what our belief system is\nwhat our rules in life are the code of\nethics that we live by\nthose are all decisions that people\nmistake for empirical truth\nbut if you want to know how just\nunempirically true it is look across all\nsocieties they don't share it\nso we just decide that stuff it's\nusually handed to us by our parents\nwhich is what makes us confuse it with\njust being true\nbut the reality is that we're all\nconstructing this belief system value\nsystem\nhonor code all of it and it's going to\ndetermine what we do and how we do it\nnow if you choose to breathe life into\nfrom a value and belief standpoint\nputting in that work to get those skills\nthen suddenly that energy of like whoa\nthis is going to let me do something\nthat lets me serve\nall of a sudden like wow that's\nuplifting in and of itself so you feel\ngood\nas you're doing it now as you're feeling\nbetter about it you're going to want to\ndo it\nmore and so that became that\nself-reinforcing loop of\ni want to do this more but to do it more\ni have to become aware of my blind spots\nand that's where self-awareness comes in\nbut just like any other skill\nlike you have to cultivate you have to\nget better at it you have to see\ndisconfirming evidence you have to\ncome to realize where you have been\nblind now often those moments where we\nrealize we've been blind they're\nemotionally devastating\nso the one going back to film school in\ncreating that final thesis film\nthe realization that the removal of the\nscales from my eyes\nwas to realize i did not yet have talent\nas a filmmaker now i didn't know the\nword yet at the time so i just\nyou know felt like it forever but it was\nlike that's the truth i did not yet have\ntalent\nokay well at least now i know now i can\naddress it had i known that on an\nearlier film\ni wouldn't have made the mistakes on my\nthesis film because i would have known\ni'm not john wu i'm alfred hitchcock\nand the night and day difference with\nwhich they approached films\nand so what i had to learn as a creator\nwas oh i'm alfred hitchcock i have to\nplan everything to the nth detail\nbecause i can't think fast enough to do\nit on the fly\ni have horrible spatial relations film\noddly enough is\nmassively about spatial relations so\nlike being able to hold that in my head\ni can't\nso i have to get a computer program i\nhave to literally do what are called\nanimatics\nif i want to shoot a film so the next\nfilm that i directed i animated the\nwhole thing out a lot\nliterally every shot camera angle lens\nchoice everything was made\nin like two months leading up to the\nshoot and then on the shoot it was just\nlike what does my animatic say oh it\nsays the camera's going to move from\nhere to here\nwe're going to be on a 35 millimeter\nlens it's gonna be at four foot seven\ninches it was all mapped out so i could\nwatch it and say is it working or not\nbecause i can't hold that in my head\nthat's a limitation of me\nokay fair enough but like that\nself-awareness allowed me to address it\nwith a set of skills which was animatics\nso that's my like whole obsession i\ndon't know if i got every nuance of what\nyou were asking\nin self-awareness but it's like you can\ntrain even self-awareness\nyeah it's often going to come from pain\nbut you can and we can get into it i\ndon't know if it's of interest but\nthere there are ways to train yourself\nto be more self-aware yeah let's do it i\nlove\nthe reason why i love this one is\nbecause i believe that this is the root\nof\neveryone's biggest challenges all right\nthen let's get into that so\nthe the biggest thing is if you're\ntrying to march down a path of\nself-improvement without clarity without\na terrifying level of clarity you're\nnever going to make it\nso start there what do you want exactly\nwhat skill what trait what ability what\nbelief what what are you trying to make\nyours so once you identify that notice\nhe did not say a thing there\nlike you said right like you said what\nwhat ability what trait\nwhat quality you didn't you didn't ever\nsay what house what\nclub yeah right it's important\nit because i think that's too much i\nmean when i remember first getting\nyourself\nsorry to cut you off please i'm saying\nthis because i think it's such an\nimportant point that you made that you\ndid not let that\nword even come into a list and you named\nlike seven things and it didn't come in\nbecause when i started self-improvement\nso much of what i heard in the west\nwas always about a vision board of\nhaving stuff\nand it was like put a picture of that\nideal house put a picture of that car\nand i've always struggled with that\nalways struggled with that being\nthe object of obsession so i'm glad you\ndidn't bring it up and you can\ncarry on or go on that or whatever yeah\nso well part of it is because i\ncertainly don't want to be disingenuous\nlike\nthere are also material things that i\nchase and i'm inspired by and all that\nfor sure come at it from\nlike what's the skill that i'm going to\nneed even if that\nultimately is where i want to get it's\nlike all of that stuff people will find\nand god i hope people have heard this a\nthousand times\nit's so transient it is never going to\nfulfill you right\nbut it's still fun go ahead chase it\nhave fun like i get it\num but you will ultimately come back to\nsomething more meaningful for sure\nso the once you know what you want you\nhave that level of clarity\nnow it's about okay where am i in that\nand that's where\nit requires that you have self-awareness\nto know where you are in developing that\nskill\nso if you one are willing to be honest\nwith yourself\nyou you've already won the single most\nimportant part in learning to be honest\nwith yourself is to accept\nthat you must have self-esteem and the\nproblem is\nmost people build their self-esteem\naround something stupid\nso most people build their self-esteem\naround being right\nbeing good being smart being worthy and\nthey see all of those as permanent\ntraits and so anything that\nchallenges them being smart which is my\nbig one oh god even to this day\nif i really want to get into a bad place\ni'll just go hang around people that are\njust legitimately smarter than me\nand then focus on how cool being smart\nis now i can be around them when i value\nmyself for being the learner\nbut the second i let myself slip into\njust wanting to be cool for being smart\nthen being around those people is like\ngetting kicked in the face it sucks man\nand so i had this i went through this\nphase in my life that i call the king of\nremedial jobs phase\nand i wanted so this is post film school\npost like\nrealizing that i don't have talent i\njust need to be smart man i just need to\nbuild myself back up by being smart\nand so i would apply for jobs like i\nworked i sold video games retail\num and i sold insurance door-to-door i\ndid anything that i could where\ni knew that the person interviewing me\nat some point during the interview was\ngonna say\nwhy are you applying for this job like\nyou're too smart for this and be like\ni'm right where i need to be which is\ncrazy and sad\nbut absolutely true and so i did that\nfor a couple years\nand in that phase it was i just didn't\nwant my intelligence to be challenged so\nflash forward now i'm working with these\ntwo entrepreneurs they hire me as a\ncopywriter\ni'm in an entrepreneurial environment\nfor the first time and\nthey're clearly smarter than me that\nthat isn't even up for debate and i'm\narguing with them for this idea because\ni needed to win i just i couldn't take\nanother time where it's like they're\nsmarter than me they're smarter than me\nso i was like all right i'm gonna win on\nthis idea and somewhere in the argument\ni realized i was wrong\nand there was a voice in my head\nscreaming you're wrong dude you are\nwrong you know you're wrong\nshut up like stop pushing for this what\nare you doing and i kept going and i\nfinally like whittled them down and they\nfinally just gave up\nand so they said yep we'll do it your\nway fine whatever and\nright then and there's the one time in\nmy life that was truly a lightning rod\nmoment where my life can be divided\nbefore and after and that moment was\nrealizing\nthat i was telling everybody that i\nwanted to get rich\nbut the way i was acting was like i just\nwanted to feel smart\nand i thought hey no judgment i'm\ntotally cool\nwhichever it is like we can craft a life\nwhere that will be wonderful\nso if what you really want is to just be\nsmart\nand to feel smart all the time you have\nto quit\nyou've got to get out of this\nenvironment because they make you feel\nstupid all the time\nand that's not a great place to be\nfeeling badly about yourself all the\ntime\nfor any reason even if it's\nself-inflicted\nit's not a bad scenario or it's not a\ngood scenario you've got to get out of\nit\nso i was like okay so that's option one\nget out of this scenario go back to\nbeing the king of remedial jobs\nor if you actually want to get rich\nstart acting in accordance with it start\nmaking decisions based on that and so i\nwas like okay well i'm gonna have to\ngive up my self-esteem\ni'm gonna have to like stop worrying\nabout feeling good about myself\nand i was like ooh that is clearly a\nlosing proposition there is no way to\ncome in and feel horrible every day and\nthink that i will have the energy to see\nthis through\nso i was like god what else could i do i\nwas like well i guess i could build my\nself-esteem around something\nthat is sort of impervious to being\naround people that are smarter than me\nand what would that be being the learner\nand i thought okay well\ni could choose to do that i could choose\nto build my self-esteem\naround being not\nright but finding the right answer not\nbeing smart\nbut working hard to learn and so that\nbecame just like the core of my\nexistence i decided in that moment i'm\ngoing to start valuing myself\nfor how rapidly i can admit when i'm\nwrong how much i learn how much time and\nenergy i put into learning\nand once i switch that and i switch my\nidentity and my behaviors around to\nbeing the learner then all of a sudden\neverything changed and that's when i\nwent on hockey stick growth\nbecause all of a sudden if we were\narguing and i realized you were right\ni'd be like\ndude he's right you're totally right i\nsee it oh my god thank you so much\nand so i started earning a reputation i\nnever just backed into a corner i never\nargued for something just because it was\nmy idea\ni was legitimately on the hunt to find\nthe right answer\nand so now i'm getting the internal\nfeedback of hey you said that you were\ngoing to always focus on being\nthe learner you're doing it you said\nyou'd always admit when you're wrong and\ni would try to shorten that timeline\ndown so i wasn't like taking an\nhour to finally admit it or even three\nminutes that i was trying to get to it\nlike\ndude if i realized i was wrong three\nseconds 30 seconds max like i'm\nyou know just finally saying it look\nyou're totally right i'm with you\nyep i see it and then the world was like\nwhoa\nworking with this guy is awesome he's\nnot trying to take credit for other\npeople's ideas\nhe will change on what he was saying in\na heartbeat when he you know he fights\nfor what he believes in\nbut the second you can convince him he's\nconvinced and then he moves on and it\njust became a really awesome environment\nso that was\nhugely transformative but it forces you\nto constantly be on the lookout for\nwhere am i wrong\nright\nanyone who's listening i'm taking a\nmoment to take it all in\nbecause that's the reason why i find\nthat fascinating is because\nmost of the time we always hear just\nlike you know\nself-awareness starts to just just\nobserve yourself do what you're good at\nyou know that kind of stuff which\nwhich i think is not bad advice i think\nit's on there but you're actually\nflipping it totally\nwhen i'm listening to you what i'm\nhearing is that\nyou literally had to shift the way you\nsaw yourself and what you felt was\nmaking you feel\nsignificant because you were getting so\nmuch significance\nfrom being the smartest and you had to\ntake that away and find a new\nsignificance it was still significant\nit wasn't like being a learner was\ninsignificant or subordinate or\ninadequate\nyou saw it with the same level of\nsignificance i i had to and that's the\nthing you can decide what to value\nand so this is another part of it's not\nreally self-awareness but this is\nanother part of the\nthe rebuilding process of somebody that\nwants to completely transform who they\nare\num you have to change your identity so\nwho am\ni i'm i'm the smart guy and that's how i\nthought of myself like i\nthought of myself as being smart and\nthen the life slapped me around and i\nrealized oh wow i'm really actually not\nthat smart i just grew up in a small\ntown\nand so in my small town i was smart\nenough i was still never the smartest\nbut then i moved to la and all of a\nsudden [ __ ] people smarter than me\nwere just like growing on trees\nso i was like wow i really don't feel\nsmart anymore so that was like a hard\nadjustment and so then putting myself\ninto smaller and smaller rooms was the\nsolution but\ni realized that i had been sort of taken\nas a default value\nintelligence maybe it was the family i\ngrew up in or the movies i watched i\ndon't know\nbut i just had this default that being\nsmart was the thing everyone should\nchase\nand then i realized oh i can actually\nchange that\nnot everybody values themselves for that\nand so i could swap that out with\nsomething else\nand i want people to understand that\nthose things that are just deeply within\nyou that seem\nas if they are innate human qualities\nchallenge them all some things you won't\nbe able to change\nbut some things are far more malleable\nthan you thought\nand a lot of what you value comes down\nto what you repeat\nand so just repeating myself i'm the\nlearner i'm the learner i'm the learner\nit began to be\nmy identity and then rewarding myself\nemotionally when i did that\nrepeating it rewarding repeating\nrewarding then it's like through that\nrepetition cycle it actually starts to\nbe meaningful that you're the learner\nand by the way i was telling everybody\ni'm the learner i see myself as a\nlearner i'm no longer i'm the learner\nand because i was telling people then i\nreally felt the sense of congruence with\nwanting to act like the learner and so\nwhen you say you're going to do\nsomething and you do it you earn\nself-credibility so now i've got this\nloop going i said i was the learner here\ni am reading this book here i am being\nwilling to admit when i'm wrong\nseeking out knowledge looking for disc\nconfirming evidence like i get to feel\ngood about myself for that\nand that cycle of getting good at\nemotionally rewarding and\nif your audience is ready for this\nemotionally punishing yourself\nand knowing that it's got to be never\nmore than an 80 20 split you can never\nbe like a 70 30\nand spending 30 of your time in the\nnegative you just can't it's just\nsomething about the human being and is\nit\nactually 20 it's it feels ballpark there\nbut like if you think about you should\nbe spending at least\nfour more times thinking about all the\nthings you're doing well\nall the good things you're bringing into\nthis world things you're grateful for\nspending at least four more times\namount of your time there than you do\nthe negative stuff the things you're\ndoing wrong the things you can improve\nand just the easy barometer is even if\nyou have to take it down to\na point of you know point one percent of\num time in the negative it's the the way\nto know\nif you're spending too much or too\nlittle is the second something begins to\nchip away at who you are and what you\nthink about yourself stop\nbecause all of this should be building\nyou up even the things that i'm saying\nto myself i'm not doing well at that i'm\ni have like protection from and that's\nokay because you're the learner\ni'm not good at that yet like i'm so\nhardcore about\nthings like that that i make sure that\ni'm i always remind myself\nthat just because i'm not good at it yet\ndoesn't mean that i'm not going to get\ngood at it so you start reinforcing that\nand you really can begin to build\nyourself up\nthese beliefs and habits and routines\nand core values\nidentity it's all malleable and if it's\nall valuable that's that's where i'm\ngoing back to that question that i asked\ninitially and you like did you answer\nall and\nyou literally answered 99.9 of it apart\nfrom this one was\nwhen you're building that how do you\nbuild it\nwithout letting that then become\nnegative judgment on yourself\nor every time you're questioning\nyourself or you're okay with being wrong\nhow are you stopping that from being so\nheavy\nyeah that this is where rules come in\nright yeah so you haven't done this in\nthe event\ni loved that point you made at the event\nyeah and so you talked about rules and\nbarriers and boundaries i think i\nanswered the question and you\nyou were like because you're a monk\nyou're allowed to say that and then you\nwent and gave the practical answer i was\nlike that's a great answer so yeah\nso the way that i view myself is like\nvoltron i'm all these like\nrandom bits and pieces that come\ntogether to make a whole but the\nthe reality when people look at me or\nthey look at my success what you're\nseeing is\nmy identity my values my beliefs\nmy rules my habits and my routines\nthey've all come together and they form\na set of behavior a set of seeking\nskills and working hard\nand wanting to impact and touch lives\nand to be\na good partner to my wife and all of\nthat that that's what you see but it's\nall things that i very consciously and\nvery routinely\ncome over prune what's not working add\nsomething new as i learn it\nand that is at the end of the day\nyou have to have a rule that you don't\ndo anything that diminishes yourself\nso for instance if i'm in a dark place\ni'm gonna spend zero zero percent of my\ntime\npunishing myself right because it\ndoesn't make sense\nso one of my like guiding principles is\nnever do anything that diminishes you\nand then never do anything that moves\nyou away from your goal\nso again goal you have to have that\nclarity so i know what i'm trying to do\nokay\nwell if i know what i'm trying to do\ndoes beating me beating myself up over\nthis is that going to help me or hurt me\noh it's going to hurt me because i'm\ngoing to\nbe more likely to slide toward\ndepression to think less of myself to be\nless bold to take less action okay well\nthen we're not going to do that\nand i don't think people have researched\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nnearly enough pattern interrupting is\nlike everything\nget better at pattern interrupting than\nlebron is at shooting like you\njust have to be a ninja like you've got\nto be so hardcore you've got to know\nabout\nhow to do that with yourself so if i\nhave a negative thought that's recurring\ni just tell myself nope you can't think\nthis anymore so\nand every time it will come up because i\ncan't stop myself from it popping up\ninto my conscious mind\nbut you absolutely can control how the\nnext thought goes\nthe next thought can be oh i'm here's\nwhat i'll do with a negative thought\nthat's so rad i'm so glad this negative\nthought appeared in my mind\nbecause that reminds me to be grateful\nfor the fact that i'm friends with jay\nshetty or\nthat reminds me to be grateful the fact\ni have a marriage that is so insanely\ncool\nthat like i legitimately some days have\nto stop myself from just curling up in a\nball with her and just chilling all\n[ __ ] day\nlike that is i'm super stoked even now\njay it's so funny\ni had to stop and think wait i'm going\nthrough this list of things that i'm\ngrateful for what started this\nand i'm like oh yeah the negative\nthought like that actually just happened\nto me right now\nso you can imagine in real life when\nlike you train yourself ah every time\nthe negative thought kicks up\ndon't don't sit in the emotion of the\nnegativity that it will\nbring instead use it as a habit loop\ntrigger\nto think about something you're grateful\nfor and at first it feels\nso awkward and it's like the negative\nthought just keeps coming back but if\nyou're diligent and suddenly negative\nthoughts become a habit loop trigger to\ngratitude\nto positivity to repeating your rules\nabout i don't allow myself to think\nthings that tear me down so i'm not\ngoing to think about that\neven just saying that crowds out that\nthought and telling other people that\nhey this is what you're doing\nit is unbelievable but this is why i'm\nsaying i'm literally just a patchwork\nof all these like tools and techniques\nthat allow me to protect myself from\nnegative self-talk from anxiety from\ndepression i don't think i've ever\nofficially been in depression\nbut i've been super [ __ ] close enough\nto know the feeling of staring into the\nvoid which i don't think is\naccurate it feels like the void is\ncollapsing in around you\nand just everything is meaningless and\nit is all utterly hopeless\nand i've had just enough of a glimpse of\nhow\nhopeless that is to to get where people\nare in those moments but anxiety\nthat i've been in the thick of\nso that one i know and i've used cbt uh\ncognitive behavioral therapy to do\ninterrupts on that\num i have a very well developed negative\nvoice so\ni have had to use tools and techniques\nto stop that\ni never would have become a successful\nentrepreneur if i couldn't\nlearn to self-soothe and at one point\nthat was what i would have said was my\nsecret power\nthat my secret power in business was i\ncan self-soothe faster than anybody else\nyou're like you can self-heal yeah like\nwolverine yes yeah\nwell said yeah i had to start bringing\nout the comic book\ni loved it no it's true yeah and that is\nsuch a beautiful quality because\nit's so funny you said that because we\nused to do exactly the same thing with\nsex as monks that's interesting because\nevery time you have the thought of sex\nwhich was\nopposing to the celibate lifestyle that\nwe've chosen to think of\nthe natural thing would be obviously to\nentertain it right\nthat's very natural thought to go down\nbecause everyone's had experiences\nbefore\nthe other thought that you can go down\nis no that's bad don't think about that\noh my god and you start criticizing\nyourself\nyou start beating yourself up you start\nfeeling guilty but you're surrounded by\nmonks and like oh my god everyone's so\npure and i'm so\nimpure and then that's another rabbit\nhole that you can go down which i've\ndone too\nand and then and then third one you go\ndown is just\njust the feeling of oh no actually let\nme use this as a springboard as a\nlaunchpad\nto find the next thing i need to find\norder switch that though into something\npositive\nor to switch that to and we were always\ntaught about how sexual energy could be\nused as enthusiasm for service\nand the more that it was transferred and\ntransformed the more it could be\nused for that like because i mean that\nenergy is what creates\nright creates the planet right so it's\nlike the amount of creativity that sits\nin that energy is so high\nthat you can kind of inject that into a\nbaby a project you can do so many things\nwith it\nyeah so yeah so no it's it's fascinating\nthat you said that and i\ni think everyone who's listening tom's\njust shared some like\nsuper practical advice like that is so\nwhere i actually hearing that i so\nbelieve that's where everyone should\nstart\nbecause that is a skill even though it's\nnot your superpower right now\nthat is a skill that's going to last you\nforever for sure and it will apply to\neverything whether you do business or\nrelationships or\nwhatever you're going to end up doing\nthat's like the one skill that's just\nself-healing self-soothing\ni love that thank you man that was\namazing absolutely as brilliant as best\ni've ever heard it explained\ngenuinely it's just it was so clear and\ni really feel i really hope that\neveryone's going to go and do a bit of\ncbt take a break like go and learn the\nskill\nand we take it for granted i was like\nyeah i meditated for 10 minutes a day\nnow and\nit's cool i'm i'm not i'm not\ncriticizing anyone who does 10 minutes a\nday but i'm like if you\nreally want that benefit that tom's\ntalking about it's going to take a bit\nmore effort\noh yes a bit more wow and constantly and\nit never goes away it does get easier\nfor sure\nbut um because it becomes your default\nreaction\nbut it's never going to go away and\npeople used to ask me like oh how do you\nget rid of the negative voice i'm like i\ndon't\nknow that you want to like the negative\nvoice is a powerful reminder to practice\ngratitude it's\nit's also a good reminder that maybe\nsomething is wrong maybe you are doing\nsomething wrong and you should adjust\nand you should rethink\ni was just about to say that sometimes\nyour negative voice is what protects you\nsometimes\nvery not all the time but there can be\ntimes when it's protected in fact i'll\nsay it like this it\nit probably does protect you all of the\ntime but\nit's so repetitive that\nyou touched this issue and now we're\ninto the 9 000th\nreplay of this that's where it becomes\nstupid and so the one thing yep cool\ngot it i do need to work on that you're\nabsolutely right um\nand then just letting it go right and\nnot clinging on to it not beating\nyourself\nup over it and all that stuff but yeah\nit has a use which is why it's so\npowerfully with us i always get more\nfascinated by how much we\nare aligned on so many things because\nwhen we first met i remember\nit it could have been opposite because\nsame with that with the thought i was\ntalking about like you'll never get rid\nof the negative thought you'd only think\nabout it for less time\nright and it's like the roger bannister\nfour minute mile\ni always use that in line energy because\nit's everyone always believed that\nit took over four minutes to run a mile\nright and then one person breaks and\nthen from then\neveryone breaks it so crazy and so all\nthat changed was\nwhen you run a mile maybe someone's\ngoing to do it in a second one day maybe\ni don't know it could be possible\nbut the point is that it will always be\nfor some time you can just make it less\ntime\nright right you can't get rid of it and\ni think that's the problem we're trying\nto get rid of stuff\nso don't be worried if you have negative\nthoughts with these tools that tom's\nbeen sharing just find a way to\nlet it sit in your brain for less time\nawesome i love that\nand you brought up this and i'm glad you\ndid about you being insanely grateful\nfor your relationship\ni want to dive into a relationship\nbecause i don't think you get to talk\nmuch about\non interviews about relationships no\nhowever yeah and my audience loves\nrelationships so i really want to get\ninto it for the last kind of the last\nmile of our interview is really going to\nyour advice on relationships\ni've seen you and lisa together i i love\nthe relationship that you have\nwhenever i watch you both on\nrelationship theory i learn a lot from\nit personally\nwhich i find fascinating like i really\nlove hearing you guys talk about\nrelation because you've been together\nfor so long how long's it been now\n18 years 18 years congratulations thank\nyou man it's incredible you both look so\nyoung so it's\nit's kind of hard for me to really get\ntogether early i know yeah\nyeah it's a thing but 18 years it's\nincredible it's beautiful and it's real\ni can\ni can say that because i've seen you\nguys together let's start\nwith people who are in relationships\nstruggling with what actually let's\nstart there\nwhat do you think of the top three\nthings that people in relationships\nstruggle with\ncommunication yes communication\ncommunication i mean that it that really\nis what it comes down to it's\nit's things though that um to to not\ncheat you out of some more answers\nit's communication in ways that they're\nnot really thinking about so\none defining terms so we all come to\na relationship with like expectations\nabout how we think people should act\nand unfortunately we don't recognize our\nexpectations as\nexpectations we recognize them as truth\nthis is how the world\nis it is how the world should be and\nwhen somebody we think that they have\nthose same\nbeliefs and values and rules and all\nthat and so\ngiven this scenario there's only one way\nto act that is certainly obvious\nand so when the person doesn't act like\nthat we take it personally like\nwhoa do you not respect me do you not\nlove me do you not care about me\nand it just isn't that they have a\ndifferent set of beliefs and rules\nthere's enough nuance difference that\nthey're not\nif they're intending to hurt you you\nhave a whole different set of problems\nbut assuming that they're not intending\nto hurt you then you have a\ncommunication problem so lisa and i\nactually define\nour terms so we have a few words in\nour marriage that they mean something\nso if i say hey baby it's important to\nme that you leave that you know glass of\nwater on the table\nthen there she just wouldn't move it\nperiod simple as\nlike the the word important like comes\nin all caps with exclamation points\nglowing red\nlike that's like when we say it like\nit's a drop whatever you're doing like\nit's important that you\ndo x y z now the big thing is when you\ndefine a word like that you can't ever\nabuse it\nso like i would never say it's important\nto me that you leave it you know it's\ngot to be it's just extraordinary\nlike how many times do i tell her\nsomething's important in a year\ni don't know six seven times in a year\nso it's like it's\nreally got to be limited and then\nanother one is promise\nif i say i promise i'm gonna do that\ndude\ni'm going to do that like there's no two\nways about it so you\nnever throw around promise ever under\nany circumstance\nand so dude it's like you really really\nhave to be hardcore and so\nand the other way that we use promise is\num if\nif uh she says you know how does this\ndress look on me\ni'm like yeah it looks great and she's\nlike you promise\nthen it's like all right all right it\nmakes you look fat what can i say you\nknow what i mean it's like\nbut then you you cut to like the chase\non something\nnow the thing is you can't say that all\nthe time you can't be like\nhow does this dress make me look fine\npromise uh what do you think of this\ndinner you like it yeah i love it\npromise like if you're doing that it\nloses everything\nbut if you're saving it for like in fact\ngod i almost don't remember the last\ntime i asked lisa\nto promise something like that um but\nyou know that you haven't we certainly\nuse it more in the early days of our\nmarriage\nbut even then like how many times a year\nthree or four i mean it's like\nbut it really forces you to respect\nthese things\nyou make sacred in your relationship and\nthen just being\nhonest even when it sucks because let me\ntell you how many times\nit's gonna be where if you just lied\noh god it would be so much easier and\nyou would probably get away with it\nand but it the way that i explain lying\nto people is\nyou get away with it 50 of the time and\nso it tempts you to think it's a good\nstrategy\nbut the other 50 of the time it is\ncratering trust\nand once you can't trust the person all\nhope is lost\nand there's nothing more beautiful than\nbeing in a relationship with somebody\nwho makes you feel like they're your\nnumber\nthey're number one and that you totally\ntrust them\nand lisa wrote this um instagram post\nabout how\nshe could see a photo of me with my arm\naround a woman or resting my head on a\nwoman or hugging her or whatever\nand she it wouldn't even make her radar\nto question it\nso that's the fun for us\nis having that level of trust now it's\nlike i think it's buffett that said you\nspend your entire life building your\nreputation only takes five seconds to\nlose it\nso it's like we're so careful we for\n18 years we've been earning trust with\neach other\nso like dude so especially when i was\nback at quest\nand it was women would come and flirt\nand hit on me because they\nwanted something wanted to be sponsored\nby the company or whatever and i was\naround bikini\nliteral bikini models like all the time\nand so\nif ever there was going to be a moment\nof insecurity for my wife\nit would have been that period a she\nwasn't insecure and b\ni the thought of throwing away 18 years\nof shared experience\nof all that trust and everything it's\nsex is like\nrad and super exciting and i love it the\nmost but like\ncompared to what i would have to give up\nfor something like that it just doesn't\nrate on the radar so and by the way\nthink something like i'm saying now\nwhich most people would hide from their\nspouse\noh that yeah of course i find other\npeople attracted what are you talking\nabout like we just\nopenly talk about that like she'll nudge\nme and be like oh my god don't you think\nshe's hot\nit's like that's just we set up early on\nin the relationship to be aggressively\nourselves and one thing that we both\nwere really honest about was i was like\nlook it is human nature you are going to\nfind other guys attractive\nand i will actually trust you more if\nyou admit when you find somebody\nattractive than if you say something\nstupid like\ni only have eyes for you oh really\nyou're the only human in all of history\nto like uh you know\ntranscend their human nature like it\ndoesn't make sense yeah and then that's\na super fragile place to be because what\nhappens if i get older what happens if i\nget injured or scarred\nlike then i'm really supposed to believe\nthat suddenly you're more attracted to\nsomebody with a scar than somebody\nwithout like it doesn't make sense so we\nall live in this fragile bubble of well\nas long as they lie to me it's okay and\nas long as i'm willing to believe and\neven though secretly i know it's a lie\nand then it's the more pious than now\nlike oh my god she's thinking all these\nnice things about me but i'm actually\nfinding other people attractive and i'm\njust lying about it\nand so then you're like wait if i'm\nlying about it is she lying about it and\nso\nit just it erodes all that trust so\nfrom the jump we were like look you're\ngoing to find other people attractive\ni'm going to find other people\nattractive but let me introduce you to\nthis magical word called commitment\nnow i'm with you because i love you\nbecause i respect you\nbut i'm also with you because i'm\ncommitted to you and so you don't have\nto worry that i'm going to be looking\nover my shoulder for a more attractive\nwoman there are going to be more\nattractive women than you\nfor sure especially as you age who the\n[ __ ] cares\nyou're my wife we have shared an\nexperience we've shared a life we've\nbuilt this around each other\nand commitment means something to me\ngoing back to having that code that you\nlive by\nand the rules and the code that i live\nby i'm never going to betray that yeah\nso it's like we've always said i may\nbreak up with you one day\nbecause i'm not saying that like oh\nthere's nothing you could do that would\nmake me\nbreak up with you for sure there is but\ni'm never going to cheat on you\ni may come and say i'm breaking up with\nyou because i'm going to go have sex\nwith somebody else\nbut i'm absolutely not going to go have\nsex with somebody behind your back never\ngoing to happen\nso like having that trust and knowing\nwho the other person is like all that\nstuff is\nis super meaningful and look there's\njust more and more and more stuff but\nthose are some big ones yeah i love\nthose and and it's nice to see that\nit's true i think when i hear you say it\nand i'm hoping that everyone who's\nlistening when they hear you say it\nthey're just like\nyeah i want that and i get why it works\nas opposed to the\nhiding lies you know white lies whatever\nit is that we cover everything up with\ni'm hoping everyone's like yeah that's\nwhat i want and i think one of the\nreasons why i think people\nfumble and i want to get your thoughts\non this is compatibility and what that\nmeans\nlike there's so many studies about\nliking the same stuff not liking the\nsame stuff having the same goals not\nhaving the same goals\nis it even about compatibility or is it\nsomething completely different\nit is very much about compatibility but\ni think people fundamentally\nmisunderstand compatibility so you're\nnever going to get one simple thing that\nsays\noh either opposites attract or they\ndon't the reason that this stuff is\ncontinuously debated is because there's\nsome truth to both sides\non certain metrics opposites do attract\nlike my wife and i in conscientiousness\ni have i'm like i think literally a two\npercent on the big five for\nconscientiousness\ni do not think through things so i am\nvery open\ni'm high on openness i'm high in\naggressiveness so i'm always just out\nthere trying\ntrying trying and if things fail and i\nleave chaos in my wake\nso be it my wife on the other hand\nreally thinks through things\nso we work perfectly when it's something\nthat\nneeds to be fresh spontaneous like a\nbusiness where you have to have somebody\nthinking of new stuff and pushing\nboundaries\nthen we need to lean on me but when it's\nthe finance side or it's planning a trip\nwe need somebody who's thinking through\neverything and can see the consequences\nnow here's where people get in trouble\none person who let's say like me not\nbeing conscientious\nthey don't value the conscientious\nperson\nthat's the problem it's not\ncompatibility it's valuing it\nso she and i are not compatible on it at\nall which is a good thing in this\nparticular instance\nbut i value her she values\nme and we talk openly about it and we'll\nsay this is where you shine i don't\nshine here\nand that by the way took me a long time\nso for any guys out there who want to be\nbetter than their wife at everything\nbecause you think\nthat's the only way she's going to find\nyou attractive i can help you with that\none that's just not true\nand think about anybody that one there's\ntwo things all of us humans like we like\nto be better than the people closest to\nus\nat things it's fun to win and then two\nwe\nreally truly want to have our areas\nof just like shining that we know in\nthis relationship that\nyou're going to want me to do and that's\namazing\nand in that moment where you reveal\nvulnerability in yourself i find you\nmore attractive\nso you've got we want to win and we also\nlove when people are vulnerable\nso you put those two together and as\nlong as both people have both the person\nwho wants to win then can also be\nvulnerable at times\nthen you can have a really powerful\nmarriage in the beginning i would really\nfrustrate her and it really made me feel\ninsecure because my wife was better at\ntraditionally male things than i am\nso she's better at spatial relationships\nshe's better at organization she's\nbetter at systems\nand finally i was just like do you ever\nsee the movie daryl\nno no oh god it's so good it's about\nthis kid he's an android\nand his mom is heartbroken because he's\nperfect because he's programmed to be\nperfect\nand the father pulls him aside and is\nlook sometimes people just need to be\nneeded\nand i thought i saw that probably when i\nwas eight and i was like\nthat's so powerful and so with my wife i\nhad my daryl moment where i realized oh\nmy god\nwhat am i thinking she needs to be\nneeded like which means i can't try to\nbe better than her at everything like\nlet her shine man who doesn't want to\nshine\nso finding that was real but then there\nare things that i think from a deep\nvalue system if you have a true\ncollision of values\nyou're going to fight over it every time\nuntil you figure out how to deal with it\nso like take and this goes back to\nconscientiousness\num i don't value cleanliness and my wife\ndoes\ntremendously and so it's like i see it\nas this just catastrophic waste of time\nand i'm like oh my god when i think\nabout what we're trying to build like\nthis is crazy you're really gonna make\nme\nlike go pick up a dish this is madness\nand so\nwe collide over that over and over and\nover because no matter how much i look\nat her point of view\nfrom knowing that i'm all about do what\nmoves you towards your goals\nit it doesn't make sense and so\nbecause we collide over that we've just\nhad to find a way to say how do we deal\nwith this because this is\ni'm not going to convince her she's not\ngoing to convince me so knowing if you\nhave a true collision of value so you're\ngoing to have to address it in behavior\nand then if you have a true collision of\nvalues at something deep and fundamental\nthat's where relationships fall apart um\nand then there's a whole lot of other\nthings and this is one thing for\ngreat relationships have sex have sex\nand i like the weird thing is in my\npersonal life i am not bashful about\ntalking about sex\nin the slightest i will make your\neyelashes curl back\nbut for some reason in my public persona\ni'm really like um\nlike a bit standoffish it started\nbecause i was at quest and i represented\na brand and i really felt like i had to\nto be super professional respectful and\nit's continued to carry on\num but having a hot sex life is so\nimportant like people do not let\nyourself become your partner's roommate\nlike you have to spice it up yeah that\none is super important and because\nespecially males crave novelty like you\nhave to find a way to keep the\nrelationship novel and exciting\nand then you have to know how to keep a\nfire burning it's funny we actually used\nto teach\npeople how to keep literal fires burning\nwhere it's like okay\nyou stack the wood in such a way that\noxygen can get in and you put the easier\nto burn stuff in the middle it's called\nkindling and then you use something\nreally flammable to light it\nand like we knew how to do it and then\nyou feed the fire and this is how you\nkeep the oxygen going\nbut we don't think of relationships the\nsame way but they take the same amount\nof constant care and attention but if\nyou give them the same constant care and\nattention\nit will stay that same raging inferno\nbut you have to\nto do it you have to put the energy in i\nlove it man if anyone wants more advice\nfrom tom\non relationships hang out in\nrelationship theory check it out it's\ndefinitely\nit's great to see you guys talk about it\ntogether i think it's really powerful\nand i think especially with the busy\nlives we lead the amount you travel the\nman your wife travels around me and my\nwife travel\nit's so important to talk about these\nthings because in this entrepreneur\nhustle grind culture being married men\nand for them being you know married\nwomen it's so often just like\nkind of shoved to the side and and we\nfind that so often that so many\nsuccessful entrepreneurs end up having\nreally\nbroken marriages at home on broken lives\nand hence broken children and then just\nperpetuating the cycle\nall over again so thank you man thank\nyou for being a great example and thanks\nfor sharing it\nall right final five always a final five\nquestions all right i love these kind of\nthings these are yeah i love them too\ni you can try and be quick but the ones\ni've chosen for you uh\nthey're deep too so you can try and be\nquick so i'll give you a quick and even\nyeah quick and if you're gonna be quick\nand deep that's it okay so the first one\nis\nyou say you want to break people out of\nthe matrix yes what is the matrix and\nhow do you do it\nthe matrix is the limiting beliefs that\neverybody has that they mistake for the\nreal world\nnot realizing that their assumptions and\nbeliefs and rules and everything pass\non mostly by your parents but also by\nthe society around you\nso i want to pull people out by giving\nthem an empowering mindset that lets\nthem realize they can do anything they\nset their mind to\nyou're doing it human potential you say\nis nearly limitless\nevery time you say that on one of your\nvideos or the introductions and when i\nsee that i'm just like\nwhat does he mean like nearly limitless\nand why nearly\nhere's the thing i i've actually moved\nmore towards just saying it's limitless\nthe reason i said nearly which is more\ntrue by the way\nwe actually are limited um it doesn't do\ngood to focus on our limitations most\npeople gravitate towards their\nlimitations\nand i say nearly just because i don't\nwant to get into stupid internet debates\nabout you know what\nyeah walk off your roof and see if you\ncan fly mr limitless\nright so you'll get dumb stuff like that\nand i just don't want to deal with that\nso my thing is you can do anything you\nset your mind to without limitation\nthat's a lie but we do it anyway right\nso like my belief system\nliterally i wrote it out it's called the\nimpact theory belief system you can\ndownload it at impacttheory.com\nand it actually has a call and answer so\nit's like you can do anything you set\nyour mind to\nnumber four number five number four is a\nlie but we do and believe that which\nmoves us towards our goals\nso it's like you're you're going to\nmake more of the right decisions if you\nbelieve that you're limitless then you\nwill\nif you're just a glasses half empty\nalways seeing the way things can't be\ndone\nnice what's the best advice you've ever\ngiven\nthat i've ever given yeah to read the\nbook mindset oh\nnice that will change your life if you\nread it and do it and live accordingly\ntruly\nit's the most important book in the\nenglish language nice\nbeautiful what's the worst advice you've\never given i've ever given\nyeah um\nwow i've given my share\nwhat is bad advice um i said something\nrecently this probably isn't the worst\nbut\njust thinking of it fast um it was an\ninstagram post that said something like\num don't point out a flaw unless you\nhave the answer that's pretty bad advice\nyou should speak up i just what i meant\nwas don't just\n[ __ ] which is what most people do be\nsolution oriented but the way i said it\nwould lead to\nbad behavior and one superpower you're\ntrying to get right now\noh that i'm trying to get yeah i know\nyou've got\nthat what superpower am i trying to\ndevelop right now i am so focused on\nleadership but that's like the when i\nsay terrifying clarity when people say\noh leadership's like which aspect um\nso i will say that i'm trying to\nunderstand people's\nfundamental personality in real time and\nlet that actually influence the way that\ni communicate with them instead of just\ncommunicating at a high level\nusing my normal what would work on me\nand oddly enough i think i'm actually\npretty bad at that so this is something\nthat i'm really trying to\nget great at nice that was the final\nfive you were quick candy that was\nimpressive man i was impressive let's\nlet's talk just to before we finish off\ni just want to talk about\nneon future yeah everything else that\nyou've got coming up just because i\nthink\njust the fact that you're you inspire me\nbecause\nyou literally lead every life you want\nwow thank you\nand and i think that's a beautiful thing\nthat inspires me too like when people\nare like\nwhere do you want to go now i'm kind of\nlike i don't want to do this and that\nand this and that not that i'm going to\ndo all at the same time but\nthere i i do believe that we live in\nthis beautiful world where you don't\nhave to choose\nyour title anymore like you don't have\nto if you don't want to\nright it's crazy yeah it's beautiful\nthis world is changing so fast\nyeah people like what do it is to me and\ni don't know what to say like i don't\neven know how to describe it in a good\nway yeah as in i\ni'm glad that i can't put a title on it\nso\nlet's talk about a bit about neon future\nbecause i'm excited by it\nit looks awesome you've been talking\nabout it a lot you've been showing it\neverywhere sharing it everywhere\nlet's let's talk about it so neon future\nis a comic book that we plan to turn\ninto\nfilm or tv and this started with me\nasking the no [ __ ] question\nwhat would it take to give somebody an\nempowering mindset that is actively\nantagonistic to it\ni thought god how would you do that and\nthe reality is that\nthe way that humans formulate their\nbeliefs\nthat lead them to act in a certain way\nis always through narrative\nthe story they tell themselves the\nstories that they incorporate from where\nthey grow up and again this is one of\nthose things we mistake it for\ntruth we just think i'm not telling\nmyself a story\nmoney is money no money is a story and\nthe second we all stop believing in that\nstory it will fall apart and be totally\nmeaningless\nand once you understand that you're\ntelling yourself stories on that same\nkind of like\nit seems self-evidently true level but\nit's really a made-up story that you\ncould shift and change at any time\nso i thought okay well if the way that\nhumans assimilate truly disruptive\ninformation is through narrative\nthen i'm going to be playing the game of\nnarrative and\ngetting in and looking at mythology\nwhich is why earlier i said jordan\npeterson's book the maps of meaning\nis just extraordinary he talks about\nhe's basically picking up where joseph\ncampbell left off who wrote the power of\nmyth which is what star wars that was\nwasn't based on but it was like\nthe george lucas went to yeah exactly\nwent to\njoseph campbell and said help me tell\nthe ultimate hero's journey\nnow the hero's journey is the story that\nacross cultures even before they met\nthey were all telling the same story in\ndifferent guises\nwhy how is that possible for every\nculture to tell the same\nmythology it's just bizarre but it's\nbecause it's a fundamental thing in the\nhuman condition it\nit is the life that we were meant to\nlive right the resistance of the call\nfinally hearing the call and going out\nand being in way over your head having\nto go through some sort of pain and\nsuffering to learn a lesson\nyou finally learn the lesson that lets\nyou defeat the great enemy you come back\nwith the spoils of that and you teach to\nthe rest of your tribe\nthat is life my friends that whole cycle\nof first you have to learn\ngo on a journey of self-discovery do\nsomething hard go through pain and\nsuffering\ncome out the other side with some\nknowledge that's allowed you to like\nchange your life and now as the true act\nof the hero's journey you teach\nand so i want to tell stories that do\nthat that is very much neon future is\nour first thing now why neon future it's\nbased on\na steve aoki the the dj um based on an\nalbum series that he did\nand i just knew that comic books come\nout\nlike one every 30 seconds or something i\nmean it's just bananas\ninsane how many comics come out so i\nthought all right to break through the\nnoise\ni need a partner on this celebrity and\nhe is just an amazing collaborator\nand love his ideas about the future and\nso um\nthat's why that particular project which\nis set 30 years in the future in a world\nwhere advanced technology has been made\nillegal\nand our hero goes on the classic heroes\njourney so\ni love it man what else can you talk\nabout what else is coming up um what do\nyou want to talk about\non that side we have other projects in\ndevelopment this one your audience may\nreally like i am\njust beyond obsessed with this idea um\nand\nit's about these two identical twins and\none of the identical twins they're\n12 years old one of the identical twins\nis visited by an alien who gives him\nsuperpowers\nand instantly overnight he becomes one\nof the most famous people on the planet\nand he's incredible and is able to do\nall this amazing stuff\nbut our story centers around the brother\nwho didn't get the superpowers who is\ngenetically identical to\nthis now super brother and he feels\nworthless and he feels\num completely depressed yeah it'll start\nas a comment\nand what he has to realize is that\nhe can develop what will seem like\nsuperpowers to other people\nbut he's just gonna have to do it\nthrough hard-ass work so it becomes a\nsort of superman batman parable\nof one guy's given everything and how\ndoes that affect his life and the other\nguys to work for everything and how does\nthat impact his life\nand also i think it's really important\nright now given where we are\nto show somebody walk out of depression\nand what that looks like\ni love how you're using entertainment\nman thank you it's so awesome\ni love that i love the creativity where\nare these ideas coming from from sitting\ntogether and\nwell those two in particular um the\nfirst one came from uh\nan idea i had off of steve aoki saying\nthat he wants to be cryogenically frozen\nwhen he dies and i thought\nall right what if steve aoki actually\nhad the power\nto um use technology to save lives yeah\nand so\nthat was the beginning of it ends up not\nbeing him he's not actually a character\nin the book although one of our\ncharacters looks exactly like him yeah\nbut that's a whole long story and then\nthe code name\npowerless uh because his name is lester\nwhat i did there so that one was\nliterally just me\nobsessing over this idea of you know\nbatman and superman and what they\nrepresent and how could we tackle that\nin a modern context\nbecause the problem is people always\nthink oh somebody's better than me\nand i thought well what if they were\nidentical twins yeah and one of them i\nlove that\nsomehow just became convinced that he\nwasn't as good as his brother\nand i thought how interesting it would\nbe if like let's say\nthey were either of equal\nself-confidence when this happens or\nmaybe even the brother who falls into\nworthlessness\nis is more confident than his brother\nfor whatever reason\nand then the brother you know rockets by\nhim and we see\njust because he compares himself to one\nperson in the world\nhis self-esteem falls to nothing and i\nsee this all the time with people yeah\ni love the way you're tackling\ncomparison mental health\nit's genius man thank you that concept\nis awesome i absolutely love that\nyeah i'm excited about that yeah i'm so\nexcited for you man i'm so so excited\nfor you it's amazing i'm so\nexcited for the world i'm excited for\neveryone listening and watching right\nnow because\ni just feel like we're in this time\nwhere and the fact that we're all\nfriends which is beautiful but\neveryone's committed to trying to change\nthe stories the world's telling\nthemselves\nand that is exciting because this is\nmedia it's mainstream it's scale\nso it's gonna affect a lot of people\nyeah it's it we are living through\na crazy time yeah super special and we\nkeep hearing that\nand i want people to just i've heard\nthat so many times\nevery time i go to a conference or\nanything everyone's like we're living in\na really impactful time right now like\nwe're really\namazing but i'm like literally take a\nmoment to recognize that\nlike we really are yeah it's it's yeah\nit's it's perfect for whatever we want\nto do but thank you\ntom thank you so much man you're\nabsolutely
