    "transcript": "starting before you're ready doesn't\nmean that you're going to throw your\nlife into chaos\nbut i think for anyone listening who\nfeels stuck and you we all have felt\nthat right we're just like\noh like i really want to do it start\nbefore you're ready we'll kick-start you\ninto action and action really is the\nantidote to fear\nand today's guest is going to help you\ndo just that now i've been following her\nwork\nfor a long long time so for me this is a\nhuge privilege i'm so happy\nto be sitting in front of her and you're\nabout to see who that is\nand i just feel so happy because i've\nseen her interview some incredible minds\nof seeing her just\nbuild this beautiful show and to be able\nto interview her today about how that\nall came about\nand all the other stories around it is a\nhuge honor for me she's a new york times\nbest-selling author\nshe's the founder of the b-school and\nthe host of marietv\nand today's guest is none other than\nmarie folio marie thank you for being\nhere oh i'm so excited jay i feel like\nthis has been like\nin the cosmic making for a very long\ntime it definitely has and the reason\nwhy i wanted to reach out to marie to do\nthis is her new book\nis out on september 10th it's called\neverything is figure outable right i\nlove\nthat title i was just telling her\noutside a moment ago i was like i\nabsolutely love that thai tour it's out\nseptember 10th hopefully if you're\nlistening or watching this\nit's around that sort of time that's the\nhope right now so you can go and get the\nbook right now if you're listening\nand marie the first thing i want to ask\nyou about because i\nlove the title so much is what is the\nhardest thing you've ever had to figure\nout\nand what gave you this confidence in\nthis bold beautiful title\nto literally say everything is figure\noutable yes\nso i think the way to answer that\nquestion is there's been\nhard things at different stages of my\nlife which i feel like is true for most\nof us you know there was actually a time\nwhen i was um a young child i was about\n13 years old and i didn't live with my\nparents so i was estranged from them\ni was kind of kicked out of my house and\nthere were a few years that things were\nreally difficult\num i was in an abusive relationship like\njust everything felt like it was\ncrashing in around me\nand so i think at that stage in my life\nthat was probably one of the hardest\nthings to overcome\num and then you know fast forwarding a\nlittle bit\ni think most of us sometimes we find\nourselves in college or university\ntrying to figure out\nwho we're supposed to be in this world\nright how can we\nmake a living and make a difference how\nare we supposed to fit into society\ni struggled with that for years and i\nfailed so much\nbefore i finally found my calling which\nis an extension of what i do now\nand then i think even moving on further\nyou know there's been times with my\nrelationship with josh we've been\ntogether 16 years and\nyou know no relationship is easy and\nit's not all unicorns and rainbows and\nyou know smiley faces\nand there's been times where we were on\nthe brink of losing each other\nand that was devastating to me because\nhe's the love of my life\nand this idea has helped me help us\nget ourselves back on track and so you\nknow i've had other challenges with my\nfamily i've had challenges with the\nbusiness i've you know\nself-confidence challenges so i know\nthat's kind of a broad poo-pourri\nof of things to go through but those are\nsome of the kind of things at different\nstages of my life\nthat this one idea this simple little\nphrase has always helped me\nwhen i feel like nothing is working\nyeah and i feel a bit helpless\nit picks me back up and i'm like nah\ni'm gonna do this i'm gonna figure this\nout no matter how long it takes or no\nmatter how many\ndifferent areas i need to explore learn\nabout\ntest try until i can overcome absolutely\nand that's what i love about it so much\nis because we're going to need that\nthought in our lives again and again and\nagain and again it's never going to be a\ntime when\nyou won't need that yes and that\nstatement and you it is a simple idea\nbut\nit's not it's deep it's it's like\nthere's so much to unpack and that's\nwhat you do so beautifully in the book\nwhen i was reading it\ni was just like it's a simple idea but\ngiving someone the confidence that it\nworks\nyes is effort and that's why you've\nwritten this book because it's not\neasy enough for us to just keep saying\noh everything's figurable and we can say\nthat to ourselves as much as we want\nbut it needs to be unpacked and that's\nwhat you do in the book so if one of the\nthings for me\nwhen i'm reading it is when i'm thinking\nabout my life and thinking about\nthose times when i've needed this yes\nand\ni know for me it's always been like\ndon't judge the moment like i've always\nsaid that to myself i've been like don't\njudge this moment like don't label this\nmoment don't give it a bad name\nand one of the things you talk about in\nthis book is that beliefs are sticky\nyeah right you talk about these beliefs\nbeing sticky talk me through some of the\ntoughest beliefs that you think you\ndeveloped at those times and how you\nstop them from being so sticky and why\nbeliefs are so sticky too\ni think you know beliefs really are like\nthe train tracks\nthat underpin our lives that really\ndecide\nwhere we're gonna go and how we're going\nto get there but so many times we don't\nunderstand that that's really what's\nrunning the show right some of our kind\nof deepest most kind of subconscious\nbeliefs about who we are as human beings\nwhat we're capable of what we're not\ncapable of how we\nfeel about society men women marriage\nmoney business you know all of these\nthings we don't often recognize\nthat it's these deep-rooted beliefs\noftentimes that we didn't\nchoose for ourselves i think one of the\nmost interesting aspects of beliefs\nis you think about us as babies you know\nwe kind of pop out and we're pretty\nfresh and we're happy\nand as we grow up we're like little\nsponges\nabsorbing the beliefs of our family\nour caretakers the media society you\nknow\nwomen are allowed to do x or if i look\nlike this i can only reach that or\nyou know money is bad and evil or\nsuccess means\nx y or c and so i think beliefs are\nsometimes\nso hidden to us that we don't recognize\nthat they could be the thing that are\nholding us back\nand you know working and coaching people\nover the last two decades now i can't\neven believe i've been doing this for\ntwo decades which is amazing\num here's what's something that's\ninteresting many times in personal\ndevelopment people feel like you have to\nkind of\nunearth all of your negative and\nlimiting beliefs and we all have them\nbut here's what's awesome about the\nnotion that everything is\nfigure-out-able\ni like to describe it almost as the\nmaster key\nright it's like you don't have to go\nsearching around the corners of your\nconsciousness to find all those negative\nbeliefs and fix yourself and change them\nif you\nabsolutely adopt this notion that\neverything is figureoutable and i would\nencourage people to try it before you\ndeny it we'll kind of\nwalk down how we can do that but it's as\nthough it's the first\ndomino that you push and everything else\nbecomes possible\nso you know for example for me early on\nin my career i had some really\nnegative limiting beliefs around money\nand a lot of my beliefs around money\nwere formed\nas a child you know my parents were\ngoing through a divorce\ni was about seven or eight years old and\ni remember\njust standing in my kitchen and my mom\nand dad had just signed the divorce\npapers and so the scene was this\nmy mom was bawling her eyes out crying\nher face was red her eyes were bloodshot\nshe was talking to her mom who was in\nflorida at that time\nand she was saying i can't believe i've\nbeen this dumb i have\nnothing i have nothing and so the thing\nabout my parents\nyou know all their fights it wasn't\nabout infidelity it wasn't about\nnecessarily like substance abuse or\nanything like that it was always\nabout money my mom feeling like there\nwasn't enough she had no control over it\nuh she you know didn't have the kind of\npower to direct where it was going\nand so when they got divorced i was\nclears around money so my mom hung up\nthat phone\nwith her mom she actually turned to me\nand she bent down so she was my height\nshe took me by the shoulders\nand she shook me and she said marie\ndon't\never be stupid like i was don't ever\ngive\nanyone control over your money don't\never give everything away to a man i\nneed you to grow up and be independent\nand take care of yourself look at me i\nhave nothing right now\ndon't be stupid like i was and i gotta\ntell you jay like as an eight-year-old\nright you get\nimprinted and i just stood there and i\nwas like\nso i formed these beliefs as a young\nchild that\nyou know giving anyone control over your\nmoney was like a really bad idea\ni also form the belief that giving a man\ncontrol of your money\nnot a good thing to do and those beliefs\ni had to wrestle with them\nearly on in my adult life i remember\nbeing deep in debt i just had all of\nthese kind of twisted conflicted notions\naround myself and money and worth\nand so the process of using this idea\neverything is figureoutable i used it\nthen to go you know what i can figure\nmoney out\ni can use this as a tool to heal myself\nand to heal other people and to help\nothers not have suffering in their lives\nso you know everything is figure out\nabout really can be that master key\nthat helps people wipe through anything\nthat holds him back\nyeah absolutely thank you for sharing\nthat as well so openly i think so many\nof us when i was listening to you and\ni'm hoping everyone who's\nlistening or watching right now was\ndoing the same when you're\nhearing marie describe what she was\ngoing through as a child put yourself\nback in that position too like go\nthrough that visualization with her\nbecause for me i was sitting back and\nthinking oh yeah what was i going\nthrough at 8 years old that has\ncreated a belief in my mind and it's so\nfunny you brought up the money one\nbecause\ni can definitely identify with that and\ni grew up in a home where we always said\nwe just have enough like we always have\njust enough\nso my whole adult life i grew up\nbelieving that i only needed\nto have just enough which always meant\nthat we were always like\njust above having nothing yeah so we\nnever had a lot\nand we never had nothing but we had just\nabove nothing and that became my\ntalking point so when everyone would say\nto me like how much money do you want to\nmake up like yeah just enough like that\nwould literally be like\nhow i'd speak about it and then when i\ngrew up and started to reflect on\nwanting to have a family and wanting to\nserve the world and\neven wanting to create content that i\nreally believed in\nand wanting to serve the world in ways\nthat i really valued\nand i started to think i was like wow if\ni have just enough\nthen i can't i can only help the world\njust enough that's right\nright that's right and so getting back\nto your point about\nour beliefs that sometimes we don't even\nunderstand or realize how much they're\ndriving us until you kind of pause\nand and recognize that they are running\nthe show right so\nwe have a simple formula in the book our\nbeliefs\ncreate our thoughts and our thoughts\ncreate our feelings and our feelings\ncreate our behavior and our behavior\ncreates our results\nand so if you want anything to change on\nthe results level\ndon't just go to the behaviors or the\nfeelings or even the thoughts we need to\ngo\ndeeper to our beliefs because if we can\nhandle that\neverything changes absolutely and so\nwell i couldn't agree with you more\nbecause we're always messing around that\nstuff at the end yeah like i want to\nchange my results or i want to change\nhow i feel\nyes but then we never talk about the\nbeliefs the beliefs\nunderpin them all absolutely and now so\nthis is also a belief like everything is\nfigure out about yes\nis like you're saying the master key\nbelief in one sense of like believing\nthat everything's figurable\nyou you alluded to it earlier when\nsomeone hears that and go\nmarie it's easy for some to say come on\nit's easy for you to say now that things\nhave worked out or\nwait a minute you know i was at a\nconference recently\nand someone stood up and asked me a\nquestion they were just like how does\nthis apply to the kid\nstarving in africa right like they they\nsaid that to me and my response to them\nactually was like well if i was speaking\nto kids who are starving in africa i\nwouldn't be saying what i'm saying to\nyou\ni was like this is to you this is\naudience specific\nyes right my advice that i was giving i\nwas like i know who's in my audience if\ni was\nspeaking to kids starving in africa i'd\nbe giving them something else\nthat was appropriate appropriate and\nrelevant and accessible to them at that\npoint so\nbut for us for everyone who's listening\nand watching right now\ntell us if someone's doubting you if\nsomeone and i know you know this but\nsomeone's doubting you someone's looking\nat you going marie that's\neasy for you to say easy to say oh\nthat's a nice thought\nyeah but my position right now like the\nsituation i'm in it's so bad like you\nhave no idea\nthat's right right okay so i want to\ndive into this and peel it back in a\ncouple of layers because it's so\nimportant\nso number one i am very clear that i\nhave won\nwhat warren buffett has coined this\nphrase as the ovarian lottery\nright i'm a white woman in the united\nstates by no effort of my own i was born\ninto a family that\ngave me an education put a roof over my\nhead i had running water i had\nelectricity\nall of those things there are millions\nif not up to a billion people that don't\nhave those same privileges or access to\nsome of those resources so i absolutely\nget that\nthat's why it was imperative for me\nthroughout the book to weave in\nstories far diverse from my own so folks\nfrom the developing world folks\nthroughout history\nthat don't look like me that did not\ngrow up where i grew up\nwith the same types of resources and\nprivileges and advantages\nand they embody this spirit this notion\nthat all of us have this innate power\nand wisdom within ourselves and when\nthat awakens\nwhat we are capable of as humans is\nextraordinary so we have that\nall over the book we also have dozens\nand dozens and dozens of reader stories\nright so folks that\nhaven't won nobel peace prizes or that\nhaven't done these extraordinary things\ni've been talking about this idea\nfor two decades you know here's a story\nyeah i was gonna ask you to tell me a\ncouple because then absolutely and then\ni want to go to the rules because\nan eight-year-old actually challenged me\nwhen i was first writing this book and\nit\ncame up with something brilliant so let\nme tell the story of jen you know a lot\nof folks\nare like well yeah everything is\nfiguratible if you want to build a\nbusiness or\nget your health back online or perhaps\nsave a relationship but what if i'm\nfacing\nsomething difficult and hard that isn't\nso a woman named jen wrote to us and i\nhad first\nshared this idea with the world in a\nreally public way um\non oprah's stage she was doing a super\nsoul\none day event she had asked me to speak\nin it and the title of my talk was\neverything is figurative so oprah then\nput that talk\nonline it's on her podcast and so folks\nheard it that i had never met before\nso a woman named jen wrote to us and\nsaid hey marie thank you so much for\nyour talk\nthis lesson that everything is\nfigureoutable is something my mom who i\nlove so much had been trying to teach me\nforever but i kind of really heard it\nfrom you\nand then i shared the talk with my mom\nand she loved it too\nbut then everything changed my mom\nwho is the most important person in my\nlife was diagnosed with pancreatic\ncancer and suddenly nothing\nseemed figure-out-able and she said but\nthen\ni actually took a walk and i looked at\nit from a different perspective\nand realized it was for example\ni could find my mom nursing care that\ncould go and attend to her\neven though she lived in this rural area\nnumber two\ni could figure out how to get my mom\nfoods that she could actually\ntolerate number three i got\nmedical equipment so that my mom could\nspend her last days and in fact\nher last five weeks on this planet\nwhere she wanted to be which is in her\nhome\nand she said i can tell you without\nreservation\nthat yes everything is figureoutable and\nthank you so much for sharing this idea\nbecause it made a difference to two\nwomen on the other side of the world\nand so we have other stories of\nfolks who have used this idea of facing\naddiction facing\nloss death grief diagnosis that\nare life-changing in terms of how long\nthey will be on this planet and how they\nwill exist on this planet so\nthose are all embedded in there so i\njust want to share that another frame\ni invite people to try it before you\ndeny it i\ndo not claim to have all the answers nor\ndo i think this book has all the answers\nbut within it you will find a set of\ntools\nand practices and frameworks to find or\ncreate your own\nyes and finally i'll share the story\nabout the eight-year-old so i was\ntelling a friend when i was first\nwriting this book we were like all\nhaving a brunch on a sunday\nand my friend's son asked me well what's\nyour book about\nand i said everything is figuratible and\nhe's like no it's not\nand i was like awesome tell me more and\nhe said well\nyou know i can't grow working human\nwings out of my back\nand i was like that's very true you\ncan't do that yet i said but we humans\ncan indeed fly\nand he was like oh yeah that's right\nhe's like well you know i can't\nget my dog who died when i was two we\ncan't get him to\nyou know be back alive and has like some\npet cemetery right there but\num i said you know what that's true i\nsaid but scientists are working on\ncryogenics and there's people who have\ncloned dogs and he was like oh yeah\nthat's right i said look just because\nsomething scientifically hasn't been\ndone\nyet doesn't mean it's impossible there's\nan amazing book called the beginning of\ninfinity\nby a quantum theorist named david\ndeutsch and he has this incredible quote\nwhich says\neverything that is not forbidden by the\nlaws of nature\nis achievable given the right knowledge\nso i would invite\neveryone listening you know you don't\nhave to take a quantum theorist\nword for it or my word just experiment\nwith this live this idea and see if it\ndoesn't\nhelp you become more capable\nand courageous and resilient and\npersistent\nin the face of whatever problem you're\nlooking to unpack or whatever\ndream you're working to achieve yeah i\nlove that and and try it before you deny\nit sure like with\neverything right like even if i told you\nwhen you came in they're like oh we have\nthis juice and it's the best juice in\nthe world\nyes and you could just deny it be like\nno i have the best juice in the world at\nhome\nand it's something as basic as that like\nwe can't even do it\nto do with food and juice what to speak\nof wisdom and knowledge and\nand ideas so yeah anyone who's listening\nand watching i highly recommend\nthat you try this out the way marie is\nsaying it and and what marie's done and\nwhat she's so beautifully articulating\nis\nshe's done the research to prove to us\nthat this works\nand she's giving you the process to\npractice it that's right that's what the\nbook's doing it's proving to you all you\nthrough these stories and it's giving\nyou the practice gone\nand i you know i'm definitely not\nsitting here going like i have\neverything figured out and i'm just\nyou know what i mean hanging out going\nlike it's all done no i use this\nevery single day i use this when like i\nrun a company and there's 30 people\nand you know things crash someone quit\nsomeone gets sick\ni am using this actively every single\nday of my life and it's what\nhelps me continue to engage with a sense\nof curiosity\nand courage and a fearlessness\nto walk into the inherent groundlessness\nof reality like let's just be real about\nthis there's so much in our lives that\nwe cannot control\nright and for someone who will raise her\nhand to being like i like to be in\ncontrol\ni like to have those plans i like to\nknow what's coming up\nthe nature of reality is chaos yes\nand the nature of reality is\ngroundlessness which\ncould evoke a lot of fear or it could\nevoke\na lot of curiosity and so what i also\nlike about\nthis notion if everything is figure out\nable you don't\nhave to grasp onto anything\nbut your own innate wisdom and\ncapability to show up and dynamically be\nappropriate to what occurs in\nthis moment yeah absolutely one of the\nthings i really wanted to ask you\nbecause this is something i'm fascinated\nby is when\nsomeone's living through that process of\nthe belief that my life and everything\nthat happens to me is the worst\nyeah right and i hear that a lot you see\nit a lot on social media you see it a\nlot on people's profiles where\npeople are just like i'm going through\nthe worst day my life and we have this\nbelief that\nwe're victims and we have this belief so\nstrongly that\ni'm going through the word how do you\nstart rewiring that from your\nperspective like how do you start the\nprocess of getting out\nyeah you know it's interesting and i\nthink all of us have to you know we need\nto give ourselves permission\nto have those bad days because we all\nhave them you know people often ask me\nthey're like you know you\nseem so confident all the time you seem\nlike you have everything together and\ni'm like well you don't see me when i'm\nstruggling like you know i'm like on the\nphone with a friend going like i don't\nknow if this is any good\nor i don't know if x y and z is working\nor you know kind of those things that we\njust do in in private quite frankly\nso i think knowing that all of us have\nbad days and you can be like oh this is\nthe worst but to answer your question\ni think it's understanding that we have\nthe power to assign\nany situation either an empowering\nmeaning\nor a disempowering meaning so let's take\na really\nsimple example right so we're not going\nto get too heavy we're going to do it\njust right on the surface because\nsometimes that's easier to see like the\njuice example\ntotally so let's say i am a first-time\nwriter\nand i've sent out my manuscript and i\ngot rejected\nagain i can take that very neutral fact\nand assign a meaning or a story to it\nthat says well\ni'm a failure no one likes my and i\nshould just give up\nand i should stop being a writer clearly\nbecause here's another rejection letter\nso that is what i would categorize as a\ndisempowering meaning you're not going\nto feel good\nyou're probably not going to take a\nproductive effective action from that\nstate of mind\nand you may not ever reach your ultimate\ndream of being perhaps a published\nwriter\nyou could choose to assign that same\nneutral fact\nan empowering meaning which could be and\nwe can come up with tons of them maybe\nit's like you know what\nevery rejection means i'm one step\ncloser to success because i'm actually\ngetting my work\nout there and if i'm getting my work out\nthere that means that i could\npossibly be published you could assign\nan empowering meaning like this\nthat particular article or story wasn't\nright for that\npublisher they're not rejecting me\nthey're rejecting the work let me go\nfind another\npublisher that might be aligned with\nthis particular story you could also\nmake it mean\nsomething like this you could say you\nknow what i\nremember that jk rowling got rejected 12\ntimes and i think stephen king\ncarrie got rejected like 30 times i just\nneed to keep going and build up even\nmore rejections and this isn't about\nbeing pollyanna it's understanding the\npower that we have of perception\nand our ability to assign a meaning to\nany fact\nthat presents itself to us and i think\nthere's something interesting there's\nthis great quote\nlife is ten percent what happens to me\nand ninety percent how i react to it\nchuck swindle right\npastor i love that because there are\ngoing to be hard truths in all of our\nlives and i feel like\nthe only thing that we can control is\nhow we contextualize what happens\nand therefore how we respond to what\nhappens does that answer that question\ndefinitely answers that question i love\nthe multiple ways in which you gave of\nrewiring that same thought with\ndifferent meaning and stories well\ni think that's it forces us to be\ncreative right\nso it's like we have to challenge\nourselves to see\nthe same exact thing from multiple\npoints of view\none of the things we'll talk about this\na little later but i also love\nshowing people optical illusions where\nyou can see multiple things\nin the same exact lines or drawings\nbecause it proves that we can all look\nat the same facts and have a completely\ndifferent interpretation\nwhich therefore proves that the\nsituation is not\nwhat is bad or good but the labels and\nthe context and the stories that we lay\non top of it totally\ntotally i couldn't agree more i think\nthat's a great answer because what\nyou've triggered for me is that\nwe used to make when we don't find a\ncreative\nunderstanding of what's just happened\nand we don't think\nmore objectively about why this has\nhappened what's the reason behind it\nwe're basically good at making broad\ngeneralizations based on very specific\nsituations yes\nright we make this broad generalization\nbased of a very specific situation\nlike when you said it could have been\nbecause you applied to the wrong job\nwith the wrong type of work with the\nwrong experience right which is a very\nspecific situation\nyes and you make this broad\ngeneralization like i'm not meant to\nmake it\nthat's right like i'm done i mean you\ncan look at the same kind of thing let's\nsay two people lose their job\nwhich is absolutely not a good thing for\nmost of us right we want to have a\nliving\nwe need to have the income we have the\nresponsibility to our families one\nperson says that's it\ni'm washed up i'm never going to work\nagain i'm irrelevant\nthat and just starts being and feeling\ndown about themselves sitting on the\ncouch sleeping in late not doing\nanything productive to change the\nsituation\nsame person loses the job says you know\nwhat this is awful\nand this really hurts and maybe this is\nthe opportunity that i've been looking\nfor to start my own business\nor maybe this is an opportunity to find\na job that's going to value me more and\nthat i'm actually going to like\ndifferent context create different\nactions create different outcomes 100\ni love that great answer there's a\nthere's a part in this book that i\nreally loved and it's you talking about\nthe difference between fear and\nintuition\nyeah and how we tell the difference oh i\ncan't wait to talk about it and i love\nthat section because i think that's\nsomething\nthat people struggle with so much like\nbeing able\nso it's so funny we talk about when we\nlabel things wrong and one of the\nbiggest things we label\nwrong is the voices in our head like\ngetting to be able to be aware of\nwait what who's saying that in my head\nand where is that coming from talk me\nthrough that because i\ni love that but so fear versus intuition\nso many of the times what stops us all\nfrom figuring something out is we're\nafraid right we're afraid maybe we won't\nbe able to do it or we're just afraid of\nthe\narea that we need to walk into in order\nto figure it out\nand then people often have asked me you\nknow how do i know the difference\nbetween\nhealthy fear that would be very good for\nme to move through\nversus my intuition or a gut instinct or\na hunch going\nno no no no no that's actually going to\nbe a show right like what that's\njust going to be it's it's something you\nshould not do and that's a really\nimportant question\nhere's what's awesome you don't need to\ngo asking other people for the answer\nyou have all of the wisdom you need\ninside of you\nand just to step back and to create a\ncontext for why what i'm about to share\nis so important for all of us to\npractice and i still practice it to this\nday\nwe live in such a sedentary culture\nright we're spending 8 10 sometimes 12\nhours a day\nsitting staring at our screens so we're\nliving from the neck up and many of us\nhave lost touch with the wisdom and the\nintelligence that exists in our physical\nbodies because simply we're not moving\nenough\nand as someone who's been a nike athlete\nfitness is a big part of my life\nmovement is a huge part of my life\ni see very clearly when i am moving\nconsistently\ni have access it's like a channel opens\nup where there is so much intelligence\nand\nand so much insight that is\nhas not to do with my logical reasonable\nbrain it has to do with another plane\nand when i don't i get up here and it\nall gets twisted and then i'm unclear\nso if you are facing an opportunity\na possibility to say yes to a job a\nspeaking engagement a date\nwho knows it could be any realm of life\nand you're not sure whether you should\nmove ahead with it here's what you need\nto do\nget to a place where you're quiet\nnothing's around make sure that there's\nno technology\nand i would invite people to close their\neyes while they do this so ask yourself\ndoes the idea of moving ahead with this\nof saying\nyes to this make me feel expansive\nor contracted in the nanosecond after\nyou ask yourself that question\nyour body will have a physical response\nso let's walk through what expands\neveryone who's listening and watching\nright now do this with us\nyes so expansive and i'll just give some\npossibilities but yours might show up\ndifferently so expansive may actually be\nas though your shoulders are relaxing\nand your chest is opening up\nexpansive may feel like even your\nphysical body is moving ahead in space\nexpansive may feel like a twinge or a\ntingle of excitement or\njoy or anticipation even if the notion\nof this feels intimidating to you\nor like something you've never done\nbefore there is a lightness a moving\nforward a ever so subtle visceral\nyes whether it shows up in word form or\nmerely through the movement of your body\nthat's expansive now let's look at the\nflip side\nif you ask yourself this question does\nthe idea of saying yes to this make me\nfeel expansive or contracted and in the\nnanosecond after you ask that question\nyou find a pit in your stomach\nor a sense of dread or your shoulders\nkind of\nhunching forward or even your body just\nshaking\nback in space or your head saying no\nthat's your intuition\ntrying to save your butt and tell you\ndon't move ahead with this and here's\nwhy this is so important jay\nbecause often when we're faced with an\nopportunity\nthat our ego thinks we should move ahead\nwith right\num either there's a significant amount\nof money on the line\nor some type of opportunity that we feel\nwill give us\nan edge something beyond the competition\nor put us on a level\nthat we're playing in a field that we're\nlike yeah now we've really made it\nand it looks good on paper but something\ninside\nis like not right that's when we need to\nlisten to this most and use this test\nbecause i don't know if you've\nexperienced this when you override\nthose little feelings of dread even\nthough everything looks so cool on paper\nthat's when we get ourselves into\ntrouble and get off track that's\ncompletely\ncompletely i've experienced that in the\nsame way right i can completely\neverything you just said i was just like\nand and it's often the\nway i describe it is i say to people\nlike stop trying because people always\nask me do i listen to my head with my\nheart\nand i'm like listen to your gut like\nlisten to the physical\nyeah the physical indicator there are\nneurons in there which you\nknow that are that have so much\nintelligence and i think that all of us\nhave\naccess to this innate wisdom this inner\nknowing\nif we have the courage to be still and\nto listen to it and again that takes\nsome practice in a culture that is\nconstantly like this and this\nand that's always like well what do you\nthink i should do or you know what's the\nmoney or what's the opportunity or what\nam i going to get from this\nrather than trusting that you have this\ninnate\ntool inside that is designed\nto guide you to your highest and best\neverything absolutely that's such a\nbeautiful onset i'm so thank you for\nguiding us through that too like i just\neveryone who's listening and watching\nmake sure you do that again and again\nand expansive or contracted\nexactly anytime and you can just you\nknow it straight away that's the most\nbeautiful thing about it and no one has\nto\ntell you you know and you'll feel it and\nthen you'll be able to see\npatterns in that feeling right you'll be\nable to be like i felt that when i dared\nthat guy that i wasn't sure about and\nthen i felt it again when i hired that\nperson that wasn't meant to be in my\ncompany\nright like oh my goodness that's you\njust you laid up perfectly\nsome people often say well i don't know\nhow to hear my intuition i'm like oh but\nyou do\nif we go excavating through your past\njust a little bit and we start surfacing\nup times\nwhen you said yes to something but you\nkind of felt a little\noff about it and then afterwards you're\nlike\nwhat did i say yes to that for look at\nall of those times\nthat was your intuition trying to save\nyour butt absolutely\nabsolutely i love that no and i love\nthat and thank you for sharing that and\nthank you for making it so\npractical and and physical and real\nbecause i think\nwe get like you said we just get lost up\nin here and i would say in addition to\nthat too if someone still\nif they do that exercise and they're not\nquite clear on you know expansive or\ncontracted\ndo something physical that has an\nintensity to it so i often go to a spin\nclass\nif because i it's dark and i can really\nsweat and i can challenge myself in a\nsafe environment or dance or run or walk\naround the block\ni find that when i engage my physical\nbody\nthe interior channels open up that tap\nme into a higher source of intelligence\nthat otherwise i can't access\ni think learning to trust and hear your\nintuition quicker\nand earlier in your life and being able\nto spot the patterns of good and bad\nyes and i started to do that very early\non i started to notice that\nmy intuition was always guiding me right\nwhen i was going against the grain\ndoing things that no one else thought\nwere a good idea and\ni was fully sold and confident about it\nso i remember\ni took a gap year before i went to\nuniversity and that was all my friends\nwent straight to university and\ni was like what are you doing wasting\ntime and this is gonna be and it was one\nof the best years of my life and then i\nchose to become a monk when all my\nfriends went and\nworked at big companies and again it was\nagainst the grain and it was\nand these were patterns i started to\nnotice in my life so now when i come to\nmake a decision and i'm\ngoing against the grain no one agrees\nwith me and i'm really confident about\nit i'm like oh yeah that's my intuition\nlike\nthat's okay exactly instead of\nsecond-guessing every time and going oh\nwell shouldn't everyone agree with me if\nthis is a good idea and so and i've\nnoticed that even now and i make that\nmistake now\nthere are times with certain things\nwhere i think i have less knowledge\nyes external knowledge yes and i'll go\nagainst my intuition because i'll have\nless external knowledge\nabsolutely because you assume and i went\nthrough this even with the process of\nwriting the book you're like oh well\nso-and-so knows better because this is\ntheir business and it's almost like you\ngive yourself a back seat and you\nabdicate responsibility\ni've done that where you assume i've\ndone that so many times where i've\nyou know wasted money like really good\nmoney and really good time and you know\ncreative resources same thing\nthinking that someone else knows better\nbecause i'm less experienced i love that\nyou brought that up\nand of course we're all open to feedback\nand of course we're all open to learning\nbut i think when you have those inner\nlittle red signals and flags going off\nyou\ntrust yourself yeah exactly trust\nyourself and and\nand otherwise if you made the mistake\nmake sure you note that down\nyeah like write that down somewhere like\ni remember even something as basic as\nif i do well in my exams at school i\nwould never write down why i did well\nand then the next year i'd be wondering\nhow did i revise last year that made me\ndo well\nyes right and if you've done badly and\nyou write down why you did badly the\nnext year when it comes around to doing\nsomething again you can avoid that same\nthing\nso i just think it's so important i'm so\nglad that you wrote about that in the\nbook\nand for anyone who loves this theme that\nme and me and maria both fall in love\nwith talking about\nit's better in the book there's so much\nmore in the book\nso much more in the book yeah i mean\nyeah we have so many exercises and\nthings for\npeople to do to dive even deeper yeah\nwhichever which i'm really excited for\npeople to check out\none of the things that i love that you\nhave a chapter on this book is that it's\ncalled start before you're ready\nyes and when i read that and i was just\nlike yes\nthis is exactly the advice like this is\nwhat people need to hear\nyes because i think because of school\nand because of our education system\nand because of even when we used to go\nto school we'd be like are you ready to\ngo to school\nit was always about being ready right it\nwas like do you have your uniform on\nhave you packed your bag have you got\nyour pencil case like first day of\nschool syndrome\nand it's like are you ready to go to\nschool and it's almost like we're always\nin this mode of like i'm not ready\nyet yes right whether it's educationally\nwhether it's emotionally whether it's\nmentally\nand that kind of becomes one of our\nbiggest excuses to ourselves of\ni'm not ready and i feel i was\nreflecting on where did this come from\nwhen i was reading the book and\nfor me i think it came from the\neducation system of always being ready\nbefore an exam being ready before a test\neveryone\nso tell me a bit about how you came to\nthis place in your life\nyeah and how you saw people at other\npeople and their stories of starting\nbefore they were ready actually be the\ntool\nabsolutely in my own life you know when\ni was first\ntraining in terms of wanting to be a\ncoach and becoming a coach\nit was so much in terms of personal\ndevelopment work and it was awesome i\nloved working with clients i was like 23\n24 years old and not only was i helping\nfolks\ntry and get results in their own life i\nwas also doing this work on myself and\none of the things i realized was that\ndefining myself\nas a coach for straw it never really\nquite felt right to me it felt very\nlimiting and narrow and not quite on\nbut i admitted that i had this dream\nto dance now let's set some background\nno dance training whatsoever never taken\na formal dance class in my life and\nit was like i was around 24 25 which\nsadly in the professional dance world\nit's a little over the hill to start\nright that's a very very late start\nand anyway i finally got real with\nmyself that i wanted to do this\nand so i started taking professional\ndance classes in\nnew york city and it was amazing i found\nmyself\ncoming alive and coming alive and this\nwas great and so i um\nwas taking class at crunch fitness\nand my teachers were like you're\nactually really good and i remember jay\ni was literally like are you talking\nabout me\ni was like like i don't have any\ntechnique they're like no no you should\nreally consider\nstart teaching and i was like yeah which\ngiven the fact that\nprevious to that i had you know failed\non wall street i had failed in the\nmagazine industry i had\nall these failures and i was keeping\nmyself alive quite frankly because i\nwasn't earning a lot of money as a coach\nby bartending and waiting tables so the\nfact that someone thought i was good at\nsomething\nwas that just little grain of like oh\nyou are kind of good at something it was\ngreat\ncut two i said all right i'm gonna try\nout and become\na substitute teacher at crunch i'm going\nto teach these hip-hop classes i had no\nidea what the hell i was doing oh you're\nso cool\nso i love that it was just sheer passion\nright and i was just doing everything i\ncould just trying to make it through\none of my first classes ever that i\ntaught on my own\nsomeone came up to me after class and\nshe said you're really good and i was\nlike thank you that\nmeans the world to me she's like you\nknow i work for mtv and we're working on\na new show\nand we are looking for a choreographer\nslash producer you should come in\nand jay it was a moment like this was my\nfirst real class\never again so like nervous and awkward\nand unsure of myself\nso what came through my head you're not\nready yet\nthat it was like i was even praying i\nwas like universe why did this have to\nhappen\ni am certainly not ready i'm not good i\ndon't know what the hell is going on but\nthis is amazing opportunity because i\ngrew up on mtv\nso i couldn't say no right because again\ni could hear my inner clock going like\ngirl you're not getting any younger so\nyou might as well say yes\nso i said yes to this opportunity and i\nremember standing outside of the viacom\nbuilding in new york city\nthe day before i was like when i was\nabout to go up for this interview that\nafternoon\nand jay i wanted to throw up like i was\nso\nnauseous i was so not ready like i was\nactually thinking should i throw up in\nthis like\nmetal trash can or should i like go\ninside and go to the bathroom so that i\ncan clean myself up before i actually\nwent to the interview\nso i went to the building and i stood in\nfront of the boss's door the\nthe person who i was going to interview\nwith and i like shook myself out and i\njust said\nyou are not ready but you're going to\nstart before you're ready because it's\nan incredible opportunity and no matter\nwhat happens\nyou're going to feel good about yourself\nthat you just went for it\nand i went in for that interview and i\nbooked the job\nwow and so it was this experience\nof me putting myself into kind of this\nwhole world that i was in over my head\nso let's be clear\ni was working with dancers that had\ndecades more experience than i did\nthey were talking about dance terms that\nnot only could i not perform\ni didn't know what the hell they were\nbut i made my way through by showing up\nas professionally as i could by being\nhonest\nabout my inexperience but also by\nbringing my gifts that i did have\nto the table and that one opportunity\ndancing and choreographing and producing\nfor mtv that led to\nfitness videos that led to this\nincreased learning curve where i got to\nlearn basically three to four years\nworth of experience\nin like three months which eventually\nled to me\nchoreographing commercials for reebok\nand then eventually becoming\none of the world's first nike elite\ndance athletes\nall because i was willing to start\nbefore i was ready\nand every single area of my life i still\ndo it in business to this day there's so\nmany things i say yes to that i'm like\nsomewhere in the back of my mind is like\nyou're not ready yet and i'm like that\nmeans i gotta go\nthat means i gotta strap myself in and\ngo like we're doing this\ni will learn as i go so this idea of\nstarting before we're ready it doesn't\nmean\nthat we're irresponsible doesn't mean\nthat we don't do our research and it\ndoesn't mean that we override our\nintuition\nthat if perhaps you know there was years\nago and i'll say this\nthat people approach me to write a book\nyes and i legitimately wasn't ready yet\nbut it was because my focus was in other\nareas\ni had other priorities i knew from a\ndeeper level it wasn't about the fear\nit was about trusting my own timing yes\nbut\nwhen you know you want to do something\nand you're clear that this is your path\nusing the mantra start before you're\nready is an amazing way to beat\nprocrastination\nto leapfrog over your fear and to get\ngoing yeah and to push out of that\ndesire of\nperfection yes and planning and what was\ngoing on earlier of like just having\nthis addiction like perfection addiction\nof like yes\neverything's gonna be perfect before i\nstart yes everything's gonna be in right\nin place and and i can so so agree with\nyou i\nremember getting my first book offer to\nme after my first ever video and\none of my first viral videos and i was\napproached by an amazing publisher that\ni would have dreamt\nof being published by before and they\nwere like we'd love you to do a book and\nwhen i sat there and and it wasn't that\nagain same as what you're\nsaying i just knew at that time that my\nfocus had to be something else\nyeah it wasn't and and it was that i\nwouldn't i didn't really know what i'd\nwant to write a book about in full like\nthat's how unready i was like it wasn't\nlike i had no idea\nyeah i was like but i want to focus on\nthis i want to build this and then i\nwill come to that\nrather than like actually i'm not going\nto do anything right now because i'm not\nready yet\nthat's right and i think that that\ndiscernment and and\ndigging into this nuance is so important\nfor people to hear\nbecause yeah you know starting before\nyou're ready doesn't mean that you're\ngoing to throw your life into chaos\nbut i think for anyone listening who\nfeels stuck and you we all have felt\nthat right we're just like\noh like i really want to do it start\nbefore you're ready we'll\nkick-start you into action yes and\naction really is the antidote to fear\n100 100 and you have this graph in your\nbook as well you this little squiggle\noh yeah exactly and it's true like when\nyou start before you're ready\nyes you are going to have a lot more of\nthis yes a lot more of this\nyes but if you don't start you're not\ngoing to have anything right like you're\njust there like you're this dot\ni think people have this mistaken notion\nthat if you're making\nreal progress legitimate progress\ntowards a particular goal\npeople see it as a line that goes\nstraight up on a graph so like you start\nat the bottom\nstart up from the bottom and now we're\nhere right but it's like\nall neat and tied together in my\nexperience and what i've seen\njust working with so many people is\nprogress actually goes\nup and then it reverses and then it goes\ndown and then it goes in some circles\nand then it reverses and then it goes up\nand then it goes down again\nso progress is this squiggly line and so\nmany of us feel that if we fall on our\nfaces\nwhich i've done so many times we feel\nthat if we hit a wall which i've done\nso many times that we're not making\nprogress but that's untrue\ncan i tell a quick story yeah please i'd\nlove to see so um\none of our b-schoolers so so b-school is\na program that i've been doing for a\ndecade it's it's online business school\nfor modern entrepreneurs we've had over\n55\n000 people go through the program so\nit's about thank you\namazing thank you for that i want to\ntell a story about one of our be\nschoolers because she's so perfectly\nillustrates what we're talking about so\na woman named molly\nshe had seen a video i did with another\ngrad where this grad was going like i\nhad my first thirty thousand dollar a\nmonth and so molly saw that she was like\nwait what like i had never even knew\nthat\nwas possible so it opened up a\npossibility for her that she had never\nrecognized before i think that's why\nit's so important for us to\nwitness each other and what's possible\nbecause sometimes you can't see what you\ndon't you know you can't become what you\ndon't see\nso molly said i would love to have my\nown business\nshe didn't have an idea for business she\nhad no business experience it was just\nthis little seed of a dream like many of\nus have\naround a relationship or our health or a\ncreative project we don't know how\nwe're going gonna do it we have no\nexperience doing it but we want that\nthing like dance for me\nso molly did the program fine fine fine\nshe worked for two years jay\nand she kept failing business wasn't\nworking she was do she showed up in the\nprogram she's\ntrying everything not working not\nworking not working\nand she wrote to us and she was so\ndisappointed in herself\nand we said hey don't be like you're\nyou're actually making progress hang out\nlike we gave her some coaching we\nadvised her to go into our member area\nand talk with the community\nshe actually took the feedback from\neveryone she retooled\nand then we didn't hear from her from a\nlittle while cut two\nyear three be an email for molly\nyou are not going to believe this and\nwe're just like okay what's happening\ngirl\nin one month she had more than doubled\nthat\nshe's like i just brought in 66 000 she\nactually had a real working business she\nhad completely surpassed what her\noriginal inspiration was that was so far\nbeyond anything that she could have\ncomprehended at that point\nbut it didn't happen until well into\nyear three and the reason i want to tell\nthis story is this\nso many of us have this mistaken idea\nthat in that year or that two years that\nwe're not actually making progress but\nwe\nare yeah right yes and if she hadn't\nkept going\nshe would have never realized that\nlittle seed of a dream that was\noriginally there that was\nreal but she had to go through the\nsquiggles like we all\ndo before we keep getting to that next\nlevel so i just want to tell that\nprogress not perfection\nif you are making progress in any regard\nif you are learning something\neven if it's a tough lesson if you are\nmoving forward\nif you are making adjustments and\nevolving or iterating guess what you're\nmaking\nprogress yeah keep going absolutely\nabsolutely this is one of the things\nwhen when we were monks the way we were\nit was we were trying to rewire our\nbrain this way was planting seeds\nand so when you actually plant a\nseedling and then you water every day\nand you make sure it gets sun\nyou realize that thing doesn't grow no\nthe days\nit's under the surface it's under the\nsurface because the roots having a spray\nyes\ntrying to grow underneath the foundation\nand you're going god when is this thing\ngonna\ngrow and then you finally see it grow\nyes and then it looks like this\nlittle weak thing and you're like oh god\nlike that's never gonna grow into\nanything\nsignificant and then it grows and grows\nand grows and finally\nit grows and then you see flowers and\nthen you see fruits and it's almost like\nthat fruit\nyou're never gonna get that fruit if you\ngave up\nwatering it on day two or you picked out\nthat little seedling\non week three because you're like man\nit's not working it's not going fast\njust neglect it yeah yeah you just\nignore it\nand it's just like you have to rewire\nyour brain for that patience and\npersistence and what you're saying\nprogress not perfection\nthat's right because you're not gonna\nget that fruit that flower that paycheck\nthat sixty six thousand dollar whatever\nyou know reward whatever it is\nyes if if you're impatient and\nforcing it you can't force it to grow i\ncould actually i could even\nover water it for one day and that would\nactually destroy its growth you'll kill\nit\nyeah yeah and and that's and and so\nthat's where i always wonder\nwhen and how do we figure out if we've\npushed too much spent too much money and\nnow it's like\nmaybe this isn't for you or is the goal\nwrong or is the process wrong or tell me\nabout that other\nstream i love this so this is kind of\ngetting into the nitty-gritty so i would\nsay\num the conversation that we had a little\nbit ago about intuition is really\nimportant here because it's going to be\ndifferent\nand i think it's also important to make\nthe distinction that\ngiving up isn't the same thing as moving\non\nthere is something known as the power of\npositive quitting\nso another quick story so i remember\nearlier on in my career before i had\na team and had resources and again i've\nbeen doing this for 20 years so we're\ntalking like\nback in the early days when i was still\ndoing all my own customer service it was\nbasically me and like a virtual\nassistant that was it\ni had this idea to build a custom\nmembership site and this is\nway back in the day when that's like\nunheard of and\ni think the thing cost me like five\nthousand dollars which was\nlike five thousand dollars that i did\nnot have at that time so that was an\nenormous first of all that's still a lot\nof money\nand it was an enormous scary investment\nfor me at that time\nit was a new coaching program and um i\nhad\nwas so excited that a bunch of people\nsaid yes to this coaching program\nand they were starting to log in and jay\nthe thing\nmelted down it crashed it was such\na hot mess and i was just not only was i\nmortified but customer experience and\ncustomer service and taking care of\npeople\nis everything to me like that's my heart\nand soul\nand i just remember going like you know\nthis is not gonna work this is it like i\ni'm going to quit not as a coach but i'm\ngoing to get people off of this\nreally shitty platform i'm going to put\nthem on a hosted platform i'm going to\nover deliver and take care of them but\ni'm not going to keep pouring money into\nthis or beating myself up because\nyou know this thing crashed and burned\ni'm going to take the lessons from it\nand i'm going to pivot and move on\nso i think when it comes to\nunderstanding\nwhether or not you're kind of done with\nsomething and you're ready to move on i\nthink people have to get honest with\nthemselves about their motivation\nso one of the things that i've seen\nespecially as it relates to career\nand especially business when folks start\na business\npurely to make money that's when it\nnever works\nso i always like to invite people never\nstart a business to make money start a\nbusiness to make a difference\nand all of us as entrepreneurs and\ncreatives and multi-passionate creatives\nwe need to stay nimble and evolve\nbecause the market's evolving\ntechnology's evolving we're evolving as\nhumans and as\nis the market but if you're trying to\npush something\nthat in your heart of heart you're not\ntruly committed to\nand you're just trying to get some\nexternal reward like fame\nrecognition the dollar bills whatever it\ncould be\nit's not going to work definitely i'm so\nglad that you spoke about that because\ni couldn't agree more i always say to\npeople like if you're pushing to make\nsomething happen\nand you're doing it to make a difference\nor an impact or a service that actually\nkeeps driving you\nyes and if you've lost that drive for\nsomething\nit's probably because that's not the\nreason why you were doing it right\nbecause otherwise you wouldn't lose the\ndrive for it if it was that meaningful\nto you\nand so i've always said to people i have\nright now i probably have and i'll be\ni'll give a genuine honest number i\nwon't\ngive an amplified number i probably have\nideas for three other things i could be\ndoing yeah that i think could be\nhuge financially yeah like i'm convinced\nthat i have three ideas that have been\nverified by venture capitalists and all\nthe rest of it that i know would be\nfinancially very successful\nbut i couldn't die for any of them like\ni don't really care if\ni did them yeah like someone else could\ntake them and make money from they'll be\nokay\nlike yeah but what i'm doing right now\nwhat we're doing right now that's\nsomething i'm willing to die for like\nthat's something that i'm committed to\nit's something that\ni've worked very hard to do and i've\nbeen driven by that service\nyes would that impact that difference\ncompletely and i think that for all of\nus\nyou know if someone's thinking about you\nknow oh god have i hit the ceiling on it\nthat's the really good litmus test\nbetween you and you\nyou know again i had side jobs\nfor seven years as i was starting this\nbusiness i mean everything from\nbartending waiting tables cleaning\npeople's toilets i taught a lot i did\nanything i possibly could because the\ncoaching and the creating\nand the writing and the connecting with\nothers like that was my dream\nand no matter how long it was going to\ntake i didn't even know if it would\neventually work that's the truth of it i\nhad\nno idea but i was fine eating my mac and\ncheese\nand my peanut butter and jelly because i\nwas really doing the thing that i felt\nlike i was meant to do in the world\nyeah i love that i'm so glad you did\nthat i'm so glad you pushed through and\ni'm so glad and this is what i said to\neveryone it's like\nwhen i'm hearing you say all of that i'm\njust like i'm so glad because\nit just makes the story better right\nlike all those situations and what i\nmean by that is not from a marketing\npoint of view not from a sales point of\nview\nbut that's what we can all connect with\nyes there are multiple jobs at the same\ntime like the multiple rejections\nyes and the downs that's what everyone's\nstory is but for some reason we look at\nall these posters\nand we think oh yeah but they didn't\nhave that and that's just because we\ndon't do enough research i feel like we\ndon't actually\ndive so deeply into the people we admire\nand\nreally look at their back stories and\nreally look at their failures and\nrejections\nbecause otherwise then we'd see that\nwe're on the same path the same exact\npath and i think one of the things\nyou've probably noticed this too because\nyou've had\nsuch incredibly rich conversations with\njust so many incredible people\nyou know is every person on the planet\nhas their own struggles even right now\nno matter\nwhat you're seeing like people are\nbattling things privately\nand that's their right to you know not\neveryone has to share everything\nbut you know no matter how much\nperceived power or fame\nor money someone has it's like they're\nhaving hard times too\nand they have the self-doubt and they\nhave the fear and they have\ntheir own versions of of struggles and i\nthink when we realize that we stop\nputting people on pedestals\nand start recognizing that we have so\nmuch more in common than we do\nin terms of our differences absolutely\nthank you maurice so i've end\nevery interview with final five\nquestions these are\na final five rapid fire round quick fire\nrounds so you have to answer\nwith either one word or one sentence\nmaximum\nokay i'm up for the chat and and and\ni'll go off tangent\nif i feel if you say something and i'm\nlike oh it's usually me who ruins it for\nthe guest but\nhere we go so the first thing is first\nthing you say to yourself when you wake\nup in the morning\ngood morning i like in that voice kind\nof like in my own head i don't say it\nout loud and i'm like all right good\nmorning girl\ni love that uh the last thing you say to\nyourself before you go to bed\nso tired i like it thank you for the\nhonesty\nyeah third question the best advice\nyou've ever received\nthat your heart is the strongest part of\nyou\nnice uh fourth question the worst advice\nyou've ever received\nhmm i've the sentence i'm gonna say\ni feel like my brain must have deleted\nit because i\nliterally have nothing right now oh yeah\nthat's\nyeah i like it that's awesome and the\nfifth and final question is what are\nyour\nwhat are three truths that you live by\nso one is obviously everything is\nfigurative everything is figure-out-able\num the next truth is there is nothing\nmore important\nuh in this world for any of us than the\nquality of our relationships and our\nconnections\nthat and i think that um the third thing\nclarity comes from engagement not\nthought\nexplain that i want to hear more of that\nso so many times for many of us we\nhave these notions of what could be\npossible or what we might want to do or\nwhat something could feel like but we\nspend so much time in our minds\nrather than actively engaging to\ndiscover it\nso rather than pro con lists or rather\nthan you know sitting on the couch kind\nof going oh i don't know if i should\ni think living by this idea that clarity\ncomes from engagement not thought gets\nus\nout into the world gets us physically\nengaged and\nactivates this open channel within to\nfeel our way into our truth rather than\nthink our way\ninto what we you know have a notion is\nthis going to make me happy or not and i\nfeel like when we lead from this when we\nlead from our heart and we\ntell our truth from engagement it's\nwhere the magic is that's great advice i\nlove that thank you so much\nmarie was telling me and this is\ninteresting to me because i'm working on\nmy book right now marie was telling me\nthat there was\na ton of stuff that actually didn't make\nit into her book\nnow whenever i hear stuff like that i'm\nlike that's the stuff i really want to\nknow about because if an\nauthor creates something and it doesn't\nget in there not because it's not good\nenough but because\nit's context space whatever it is tell\nme tell us about why\nyeah so it was this amazing chapter that\ni had worked for weeks on and my\npublisher who i really trust in my\neditor they're like oh\nwe felt the natural ending was here and\nno no and i was like\nat first i was crestfallen it felt like\na punch in the gut and then when i\nre-looked at the material i was like oh\nno\ni think i could actually teach this\nbetter if i had the benefit of my voice\nand i had videos and i actually had\nworksheets and could actually coach\npeople through it\nso it was this acronym this little\nformula i created to help people\nembed the belief everything is figurable\ninto their consciousness into their mind\ninto their soul in a really organic way\nso i said to myself okay i actually\nstill want to give this to folks but i\nwant to do it for free and just teach\neveryone there's no upsells there's no\nanything it's just\nanother part of the book that just\ndidn't make it into the pages\nthat i actually feel will be more\neffective if done collectively\nand done online
