is to\ngo all the way back\nto the beginning to your childhood\nbecause that's where\neverything starts and that's what's\nblocking moisture all of us\nyeah all of us everybody thinks my god\nlike my marriage is messed up this is\nmessed up\nyou have to go back to fix all your\nproblems\nit all starts from the root hey everyone\nthank you so much for coming back\ni've just spent about an under an hour\nwith our next guest\nand i'm so excited to introduce you to\nhim he's been called the world's\nstrongest man the world's toughest man\nthe world's fittest man he's\nconsistently\ninvited suffering and discomfort into\nhis life\nto grow further he's someone with a\nphenomenal\nbackground he's a former navy seal an\nultra marathon runner a triathlete\nand today we're going to dive into his\nnew book which is called can't hurt me\nabout mastering your mind and defying\nthe odds\nhis name is david goggins david thank\nyou so much for being here i appreciate\nit man thanks for having me no i'm so\ngrateful honestly and i'm so glad\nwe were just talking about it i'm so\nglad that we got a moment to connect\nbefore because i think this conversation\nwould have been very different\nit would have it would have i i\nimmediately walked in and um\nyou know i sometimes look at people and\nwhat they have and you know i'm like oh\nhere we go here we go again\nbut you know i got a chance to know you\nknow know a little bit about your\nbackstory where you come from and know\nthat uh\nwe have some similar you know you know\njust like a mentality of of how to come\nup\nso it was nice absolutely man i think\nwhat you put yourself through\nand i don't say this anyway i'm not i'm\nnot saying that i can say i've had the\nsame experience at all\nright but i feel we've been wanting to\nchallenge our minds\nright in the same ways 100 and and that\nexcites me that that desire that hunger\neven though we chose different paths\nright i don't think i could have ever\nchosen your part\nbut that we chose different paths but we\nwere testing the same parts of ourselves\nright the mind is the one thing that we\ndon't test enough\na lot of us are so afraid of that of\nthat test and that's the real test\nthat's where the real growth comes from\nis is the mind so\nabsolutely man absolutely so i've had a\nbeautiful fortune of actually diving\ninto this book this weekend great\nand i have to say and i'm saying this\nhonestly so i was just telling you this\nearlier 2017 to 2018 i read a book a day\ni read 365 books in a year i made a\nvideo about the books i read and how i\ndid that\nand then 2018 to 2019 this year i read\na book a week right and one of the\nthings i've struggled with recently\nand i'm saying this as a compliment to\nyou right right is that it is so\nhard to read a book that isn't an\narticle\nor isn't an instagram caption or isn't a\nshort video\nbecause we live in a world where\nconstantly consuming content\nright when i picked up your book the\nthing i loved about it\nis the amount of effort that you've been\nthrough to give us\ni'm sure this was suffering too like\nwriting this book the amount of effort\nthat you've been through to actually\ngive us\ndetail right on your life and\nand i just want to start there about the\nprocess of writing the book because i\nfeel what you've done what a lot of\nauthors have missed out on recently\nis you've gone a step further right to\nreally do self-work\nto write the book so in that book it's\nit's a raw very um humbling version of\ndavid goggins you know i went down to\nthe\nto the grassroots to the soil to the\nsewer of my life\nit's the it's the stuff that we want to\ntalk about so stuff that we don't want\nthat person next to you\nin line knowing and i had to have the\ncourage\nto uh say it out loud to people\nand so i was able to really go back and\nand put so much detail\ninto my story was we all have different\nthings in our life that have scarred us\nwe want to act like those scars don't\nexist little scars like you know if you\ngo out\nand you get cut that scar is going to be\nthere on your arm you can go down and\nlook at that cut and say\noh or or that scar and say oh that\nhappened from\nyou know i was in the kitchen or what\nhappened we have the same thing in our\nbrain\ni have all these scars on my brain from\ngrowing up\nfrom you know being abused from\nsuffering through life from having a\nlearning disability from stuttering from\nhaving just a really bad childhood and\nso all those memories i had to cut open\nthat scar\nand go into it and that was a hard\nprocess for me to do\nnot only was that a hard process for me\nto do for me to have the current race to\nshare that with people\nyou know because i'm the so-called\ntoughest man on the planet\nso they think so for me to break open\nthat shell and tell people hey\nthat wasn't always me you know it's it's\nhard to do you know\nit's hard to do so it was a tough\nprocess yeah absolutely man i'm so glad\nyou did peel that back\nyeah because it's so easy to live that\ntitle oh yeah but when you break\nthe fact that you had the courage to\nbreak down that title right to actually\nlay it out it just it's going to open up\nthe door for so many more people\nwell i had to do it because you know\nthroughout this journey i started\nbecoming this new person\ni started creating this new person\npeople started seeing me\nas this amazing superhero\nin the back of my mind i knew the real\nstory and i was like man one day you\nhave to really share it i'm like man but\ndo you have the courage\nyou know like it's great to live right\nhere i've established this people think\nyou're great\njust stay here don't go back let's not\ngo back\nbut the only way you can help people out\nis let them know that this is possible\nso i had to go back and say this is\nwhere i come from yeah and where i come\nfrom as hell\nabsolutely and now when you go back you\ntalk about how your childhood was a\nnightmare\nright tell us about some of the defining\nmoments in your childhood\nthat actually framed that experience to\nbeing a nightmare\nwell my dad was a person that um he was\nan alcoholic\nhe was really big on being a powerful\nman\nand he had two different sides of him he\nhad a side that\nonce you left our house so our house was\nthe dungeon\nno one knew what no one knew anything\nabout what you know about the inside of\nthat house\nthe inside of that house was was\nhorrible it was evil\nyou know like the evil monster came out\nto play but once\nleft that house he was the nicest\nperson on the planet so no one knew you\nknow who this guy was\nso um the scarring started happening\ninside the dungeon\nand my dad didn't really believe in us\ngoing to school he had a family business\nand the family business was a stadium\nrink and also a bar\nso my dad owned the it was called the\nvermillion room was the bar\nand the skating rink was called skate\nland so from the time i was able to walk\ni was working that that that that that\ni'm skating rink\nand i worked it from like nine o'clock\nat night until like 12 o'clock\nin you know in the morning pretty much\nthat's what we did you know i'm three i\nknow i'm four years old\nscraping gum off the off the skating\nrink floor doing stuff like that me and\nmy brother and my mom\nonce the skating rink was shut down the\nbar would open up\nthe bar will be open from like midnight\nit's like four o'clock in the morning\nthree o'clock in the morning\nonce that closed down we go upstairs and\nclean the bar\nso by time you work like this you know\ni'm a young kid it's time to go to\nschool\nso most time we didn't go to school so\nwe missed school a lot\nbut thank god for me i didn't like\nschool anyway with learning disability\nwith a stutter you know i had white\nsplotches all over my skin\nfrom being stressed out um hair you know\npassive hair falling out at a young age\nand once my dad got drunk that's when\nthe nightmare began\nand you know he'd get drunk he'd get\nviolent and\nwe got beatings quite regularly you know\nprobably\nat least once or twice a week and and\nthe beatings weren't like hey\ni'm gonna give you a weapon because you\ndid something wrong\nit was like hey i don't feel good today\nand you get beat for that and my mom got\na lot of the beatings\nand it just trickled down to me my\nbrother so that\nthat foundation of life that i didn't\nhave that's how it started off for me\nand this progressively got worse so when\nyou have a horrible foundation it's like\nbuilding a house on a\n[ __ ] up foundation this is what you're\ngonna get you know any kind of uh\nearthquake or something happen\nthe house is gonna go down sometimes you\nknow don't even take an earthquake\ntakes a little windstorm so that was me\ni was just a little windstorm away from\nbreaking\nyeah all the time a windstorm away from\nbreaking but no one knew it\ni walked around like i was a pillar of\nstrength\nat a young age but that internal\nconversation you're having back here is\nthis weak little kid\nvery afraid and i think that's what\nmakes the book very powerful\nbecause i take you there yes i take you\nto that spot\nof you know i'm super human now so you\nthink\nbut a lot of people have a lot of\nproblems that they can't overcome\nabsolutely man and that's i definitely\nfelt when you were diving into that that\ni was reliving it with you\nright and i think you do that so\npowerfully in the book because\nit's hard for people who haven't had the\nsame experience to envision it\nright but you made that possible but the\nother thing that you do is i think\nyou're highlighting something\nthat is so huge for us that i genuinely\nfeel that so many\nof today's challenges that we all face\nas adults\nright are because of our childhood when\ndid you realize\nthat your childhood was something that\nneeded healing that needed transforming\nas an adult when did that come when you\nwere like i need to go back there\nto transform to to change my experience\nit happened when i could never\nget over the hump i kept on feeling like\ni was getting over the hump\nand then one little windstorm small\nlittle windstorm would come by and\npushed me back to scratch\ni was like why why am i not you know i'm\nyou know\ni'm learning how to read now you know i\nwas a junior in high school and couldn't\nread that well\na fourth grade reading level because i\nwould i would cheat on everything and i\nlearned how to read i learned how to\nwrite\ni taught myself all these things all\nthese disciplines but whenever\nthe first real big challenge would come\nthat little windstorm of pushing\nback in the hole and i realized man i'm\nnot\ni'm fixing stuff on a surface level i'm\nall surface man i'm not going deep into\nthe cellar of my mind\nand fixing the foundation of my soul my\nsoul is broken\nand but you know i knew i could fix it\nbut i was afraid to go\nback i was afraid to face the demons of\nmy life\nyou know because you start lying you\nwant anybody knowing this [ __ ] about you\nso so you start lying about\nwho you're not and start creating a\nperson about who you want to be but it's\nnot who you are\nso that's when i started realizing man\ni'm never going to get over the hurdle\ni'm always live on a surface level until\ni go\ndeep deep into the sewer of my mind to\nfigure out and face\nall of these different demons that's\nhard\nit's hard we all like social media we\nall like everybody to see us\nfor who we want to be that's why we post\nbeautiful things about us\nthat's not that's not going to fix you\nso i realized that and that's when i\nstarted going back so i was about um\ni was about 24 years old and i went from\n175 to almost 300 pounds\nand um that's when i sat down on my\ncouch and realized\nwe got to go back and it started with me\ngoing back to my father\nso we we left when i was eight years old\nwe went to a small town in brazil\nindiana\nthere's about five to ten black families\nin a town of eight thousand to ten\nthousand people\nand um there was a big hub of klansmen\nthat lived in center point indiana and i\ntalked about that in the book\nso the clan marched in the fourth of\njuly parade in 1995\nin indiana so when you come from a\nmessed up foundation like i did in\nbuffalo new york\nwhere my dad beat me senseless and now i\nhave that messed up foundation and now\ni'm here being the only black person i\ncall it the only\nin my book being the only black person\nmy mom's working three jobs\nwe're living in a seven dollar a month\nplace she's never at home\nso it's not like i had some mentors\ncoming in\nto help me you know they're trying to\nput me in these different group\nplaces for like having some shrink talk\nto me and these eight nine kids and\none kid sitting this house on fire\nanother kid's peening in the trash can\nanother kid had a helmet on banging his\nhead up against the wall and i'm looking\nat this at eight years old\nyou know and i'm gonna get back to your\nquestion that you asked me but\nthese are things i had to go back and\nrelive you know i'm 24 years old now\nand i have to go back to all these\nthings that no one knew\nabout me in this group place where i'm\nin this place where these people are\ncrazy\nand they think i'm crazy and i'm looking\nat i'm thinking i'm not crazy\nyou just don't know where i come from i\ncame from a place that truly damaged my\nmind\ndamaged my soul and now i have to go\nback on my own\nto face this [ __ ] so you know\nat 24 years old i sat there a lot of\ntime like one day\ni woke up and said i gotta face this\nthis haunting [ __ ] voice in my head\nkept on saying man\nwe gotta go back the only way we can go\nforward\nis to go all the way back and that's\nvery scary to do for everybody\nthe only way you're gonna fix yourself\nis to go all the way back to the\nbeginning\nto your childhood because that's where\neverything starts\nand that's what's blocking most of us\nall of us yeah all of us everybody\nthinks it's\nmy god like my marriage is messed up\nthis is messed up you have to go\nback to fix all your problems it all\nstarts from the root man the root yeah\nthe roots but i say we have to go back\nto the root because otherwise we're just\ndealing with the symptoms that's it\nyeah yeah and and and you cannot fix\nanything\nby giving it mulching you got you have a\njacked up knee the swelling may go down\nbut it's still jacked up in there you\ngot to get it fixed you got to fix the\nknee\nall those pills do so you know pretty\nmuch\nis just let the swelling go down and you\ncan live a little longer\nbut you're not fixing the problem you're\nnot fixing the problem and i guess the\nmost people don't go back or all of us\nlike you said we don't go back because\nwe don't know how\nright like right like right we don't\nknow how like how do you start how do\nyou go back and like you and i love that\nexample that\nwe start thinking the issue is our\nmarriage or our relationship right now\nor our\njob or our career and i i totally agree\nwith you that we need to go back but we\ndon't know how right now you start\ntalking about in the book\nsome ways in which we can start how\nright can you tell us about some of that\nso one big thing is the accountability\nmirror\nyou have to start with yourself so what\nhappened\nin my life was we start to get i call it\nlike the rucksack\na rucksack is a pack that you carry in\nthe military and you put all your stuff\nin it your radios your food your water\nall that stuff you have to carry the\nmilitary\nthat's your rucksack it's a backpack\npretty much\nas you're growing up we all have a\nbackpack most of ours\nhopefully is empty you know and what we\nput in it\nis all the crap we go through in life\nthat's what is in the backpack for the\ncivilians\nand we carry it around with us so what\nyou have to start doing is realizing\nthat no matter where you're at in life\ni got called [ __ ] a lot my dad abused\nme\nyou know learning disability stutters\nimmaturity insecurities\nself-doubt so much crap on top of me so\nmuch stuff i lied a lot to create\nfriends so people so much stuff was in\nmy backpack\nno one's coming back to help me so\nit starts with that person in that\nmirror you have to realize you are on\nyour own now\nand whatever else you believe in i don't\ncare what you believe in but\non earth it's a very lonely journey\nit starts with the accountability mirror\nof looking at saying hey my dad who beat\nthe helmet's not coming back\nall these things are coming back i have\nto face myself\nand you have to own all those things\nthat people may have done to you now\nit's yours\nyou got to own it it's yours now to fix\nthe problems that people did to you\nit makes no sense it's not fair i get it\nbut if you live in that what was me\nmentality of guess what\nmy dad did this to me my mom just did to\nme people who bullied\ndid this to me you're going to always\nlive right\nthere you have to figure out ways to\nmove forward\nbecause you're not coming back it starts\nwith the mirror i call it the\naccountability mirror in the book\nyeah i know i love that i love that i'm\nglad i'm glad you brought it up\nand anyone who's watching listening to\nthis right now\ni really want you to take this seriously\nbecause this is like\nwhat what you're talking about what\ndavid's talking about here is\nexactly why all of our suffering and\npain\nthat we're currently experiencing feel\nso tough and hard because\nunknowingly or knowingly we are choosing\nto be stuck here\nright right exactly unknowingly or\nknowingly whatever situation you're in\nyou're choosing\nto stay stuck because we don't want to\ngo and unpeel and uncover that's right\nyou don't want to break open that that\ncallous\nthat that scar in your mind you're going\nto break you know you have to break it\nopen let that blood flow\nyou let blood flow in your brain you\nhave to let all that stuff flow out\nall that toxic stuff that you have\ntrapped in there has to start flowing\nout now so\nlike you said you you are you are doing\nthis to yourself\nyes people may have helped you get there\nbut it's now on you that's a painful\ntruth though it's a painful truth\npainful truth like all those people in\nhigh school and everything else\nthey don't know how you're going to end\nup so you got to make sure that you\nconstantly are rewriting your book\nyou have to constantly rewrite your book\nevery day of your life\nyou know and that these aren't just\nwords i say this is how i have to live\nlike\nthese are conversations i have with\nmyself and i say it everywhere i go\nthe most important conversation when you\nhave it yourself yes\nyou live with it every single day but\nmost of our conversations\nare not the right ones they're not the\nones that are gonna push us to the place\nwe need to go\nthey're the ones that are going to keep\nus sitting in that toxic\nenvironment that you've helped create\nand everybody else helped to create\nand you just live in it you live in that\nmuck and that conversation just plays in\nyour head and that becomes you\ndecode some of that conversation that\nyou started with yourself like how do\nyou how does someone listening start\nthat conversation with themself\nand and what are the general transitions\nthat you need to start seeing\nso my first conversation when i was\nabsolutely nobody\nand that's one thing you have to say we\nlive in a world now\nthat's so kind we we find the kind way\naround everything like if you don't look\ngood\ni have to find a kind way of saying i\ndon't like your shirt\nright that's not the approach if that's\nthe approach you're looking for\nthat book is not for you can't hurt me\nis not for you the approach you have to\ntake\nat least i took you take whatever\napproach you want the conversation had\nto be a real\nhonest conversation in the\naccountability mirror guess what\ni was fat don't find a kind word to say\nthat you know what\ni've gained some weight no you're fat\nwhen i couldn't read not like hey you\nknow even learn disability\nno i cannot read i have a fourth grade\nreading level i'm struggling\nand sometimes i call myself stupid not\nin a way to put myself down\nso don't take it like my god those are\nso horrific yeah the hurtful\ndishonest the conversation has to become\nan\nhonest conversation of where you're at\nmentally where am i mentally\ni look like [ __ ] i feel like [ __ ] i'm\nnot this i'm\ni'm falling behind in school i'm lazy\nmy house is a mess you have to look at\nwhat it is and call it what it is\ndon't find words to make yourself feel\nbetter because\nthat's what so we hang around people\nthat make us feel better\nthat tell us what we want to hear not\nwhat we need to hear\nand so we stay away from those people\nand we stay away from those people\nlike our internal dialogue becomes that\nkind\nit's okay it's not okay so that's where\nit starts it starts with that\naccountability of\nit's not okay anymore this can no longer\nbe okay\nand calling yourself out for exactly\nwhat you are and exactly how you need to\nfix it\nthat's where it starts i love that i\nlove that i i think that's awesome i i\nthink you're so right that\nso many of our conversations with others\nare politically correct\nexactly our conversations with ourselves\nare politically correct and then we\ncontinue to feed the illusion that's\nright\nright we continue to feed it nothing\ngets solved by that man\nnothing and if you look at america right\nnow and i won't get off on this\nnothing is getting solved because we\nhave\nthere's so much racism there's so many\nthere's so many things and that's just\none of them\nwe can't talk about anything we are\nskirting\nall these conversations because if i say\nthis i'm going to offend a black person\na white person or a jewish person or\nor a gay or lesbian person we skirt\naround\nthe daggone problem so we can't fix\n[ __ ] everything is like well if i say\nthis on tv i'm gonna lose my damn job\nwe have to say it we have to break the\nbarriers within our minds\nwithin the world it starts with yourself\nit starts with yourself you gotta break\nthe barriers down within yourself and\nand just go there get a good of yourself\nabsolutely that was the honest\nconversation you had then what's an\nhonest conversation you've been having\nwith yourself this year\nlike what's because like you said and i\ncompletely agree with you it's a\nconstant cycle\nrepetition we have to keep doing it so i\ntalk about the repetition in my book a\nlot yeah\ngotta get the reps in so now my\nconversation is this\ni never set out to write a book\nwhen i was in the dungeon and no one was\ncoming back to help me\ni just wanted that reflection in that\naccountability mirror that i hated so\nbadly\nto be something that gave me pride to be\nsomething that made me feel it wasn't\nit's not about money\nit's not about success it's not about\npeople oh my god that's david goggins\nsign my book no when i started this\njourney out years ago\nit's about i just want to learn to read\nso now i'm at a place now\nwhere i see the possibilities of the\nhuman of human potential what are we\ncapable of\nis the conversation now the conversation\nnow is how can i now\ntalk to people in a way they can\nunderstand\nthe message that i have for so many\npeople for so many people\nso that's the that's the new\nconversation now is that i you are\nconstantly evolving\nyou never say you're getting better\nyou're getting worse not staying the\nsame\nso for me i have to constantly be\ngetting better i have to constantly be\nevolving my message so\ni'm constantly thinking in the quietness\nof my mind that's that's the key point\ntoo\nthe world is so fast-paced the world is\nso noisy\nso my conversation now a lot of times is\nmy god\nslow down the world can take you\nhere here be here be there be everywhere\nand i lose myself sometimes so i catch\nmyself in the airport i catch myself in\nthe plane when i'm writing stuff down\nokay\nremember this remember that i'm like hey\nhang on a second goggles what got you\nhere this isn't what got you here\nslow the [ __ ] down\ngo back to the quiet place of that dirty\nmirror\nin that seven dollar a month place you\nused to live in\nthat's where you grew you so i so that's\nwhat i'm constantly reminding myself\ngo back to your roots now i'm not saying\ngo back to hell\nbut i'm saying don't forget where you\ncome from as you start to\nexplode out of the gate when you become\nsomeone\nmy conversation is do not forget\nyour roots do not forget your roots\ndon't let this become so big that you\nlose yourself\namongst the noise go back to the\nquietness\nof what made you successful that's the\nconversation now it's a constant\nreminder of that\ni love that man that's the mantra do not\nforget your roots repeat that repeat\nthat again and again and\ni have a meditation that i develop for\nmyself to to do that for me\nthat i want to share with everyone\nbecause it aligns so closely in\nin what you're sharing so every morning\ni sit and i look at my intentions\nto do anything so whether there's a new\ndeal on the table\nor there's a speaking gig that i've been\ninvited to do or whatever it may be\nand in your life it can be anything\nwhether you're starting a new business\nyou're writing a book it may even just\nbe\nan instagram post for whatever it is and\ni look at whatever my options are\nand i ask myself which ones of these is\na seed\nand which ones of these is a weed\nbecause the incredible thing in our\ngarden is that weeds end up looking like\nseeds and can confuse you 100\nso so often that thing that's giving you\nego and pride and fame and control\nand power looks like it's amazing right\nbut actually it's just strangling you\n100 so so every day what i'll do is i'll\nlook at the garden of my life and i will\ntry and\nunweed my garden so i'll look at\neveryone be like why am i doing that and\nask me\nwhy am i doing that if the answer is not\nlove compassion\nempathy growth right personal push\nsacrifice service if the answer is the\nopposite greed\nmoney power fame if those are my reasons\nthen i have to take that weed out 100 i\nhave to pull it out because if i don't\npull it out that weed's going to keep\ngrowing\nright and one day it's going to be so\nbig right that i wouldn't have never\nseen it\nexactly and so i'm with you man and\nthat's why i walked in here\nthe first thing i do is i is i want to\nknow the person\nbecause there's so many people right now\ndoing exactly what we're doing\nwhat turns me off so badly i see so many\npeople out there trying to\nmotivate people inspire people help\npeople find\nwhat's going to drive you i see all this\n[ __ ]\nit's all [ __ ] a bunch of [ __ ] and i\nwalk in i see it everywhere everybody's\ngot this going everybody's got a new\npodcast this about i'm gonna help you\nfind yourself they're not living it\nthey're not living it which is why i\nlook at people i'm like\nwhat are you about are you are are you\nactually\ndoing what you say you're doing which is\nwhy when i heard some of your story\ni realized that you have substance to\nwhat you're saying\nwhich is why now i can speak to you a\nlot of times i go on this podcast i want\nto [ __ ] be there\nyou know because i start realizing this\nperson is just talking he's not living\nand we share this with people and we\nexpect them to change\nthey can see right through you they can\nsee you not doing this\nthat's one thing about it don't do\neverything in your life for money\ndon't do everything yes we need it to\nsurvive\nthere's a great drive and passion behind\ndoing things\nfor the mind and the soul there's a\ngreat drive in that everybody's married\nyou talk with such passion this is a\nlife\nthis is my life so that's so that's what\ni want people to get from\nall this stuff man like there's\nsomething inside you the the brain is\nthe most powerful thing the mind's most\npowerful thing that we have\nit's not your phone it's not the\ncomputer it's not anything it's your\nmind\nand if you can tap into that you can\ncome from the\nfrom the daggone roots of hell\nand become such a great seed\na powerful seed that can grow into some\ngreat daggone garden\nand people don't get that it's all up\nhere the power and the magics up here\nyeah no i really appreciate that man and\nthank you for saying that because\nfor me too that was you know my desire\nwhat i was sharing with you earlier is\nchanging people's relationship with\nperception right and when i started\ni would complain when i started making\nvideos or any of this and i've been\ntalking about these things and studying\nthem for the past 13 years\nand when i started making videos which\nwas only two years ago i had no idea\nthat anyone would care\nright i made it because i wanted to\nshare what i'd learned\nright and i put it up and i genuinely\nthought my life was going to be i was\ngoing to go to my 9 to 5 job my\nnine-to-nine job i used to work 12 hours\na day\nin the corporate world and i thought\nthat's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna make\nvideos on the weekends right and\nhopefully they'll help someone exactly\nlike there was never a desire to\nfor this to be anything more than a\nservice\nright and so when you when i hear you\nsay that and and also just about how\nmuch we perceive each other and\ni mean how we perceive other people etc\nright it's it's so important for all of\nus to give each other the benefit of the\ndoubt that's right\nand hear from each other right to\nconnect exactly to see like i i said\nthat to you earlier i already knew i was\ngonna like you right\ni was hoping you're gonna like i didn't\nknow that about you so you know i uh i\ni make sure i and that's something that\nthat's very powerful a lot of times we\nhear\nabout someone else through the grapevine\nand they don't and then i won't like you\nbecause i heard from somebody else that\nthey don't like you\nalways do your own judging always\nmeet the person look at the person in\nthe eyes before you say you don't like\nthat person\nlisten to their story listen to who they\nare listen to where they come from\nhow they lived get your own opinion\nabout people\nit's very huge a lot of people didn't\nlike me coming up because they they\nthey see this hardness this crust break\naway at the crust and see what's inside\nthat person\nabsolutely man don't judge a tweet don't\njudge one post\nno don't judge one message and don't\njudge somebody from 30 freaking years\nago\nor i say 30 [ __ ] years ago you know\nthere's so much stuff going on right now\nin the world people are trying to evolve\nlet them evolve yes let them evolve\ndon't\nbring them back into the don't bring\nthem back where they came from\nyes don't don't bring if someone wants\nto get better\ndon't bring them back to where you knew\nthem when they were a piece of [ __ ]\nlet them fly and if you feel like hell\nbecause they went away and they escaped\nthe hell that you all once lived in fix\nyourself\nfix yourself don't hold them accountable\nbecause they got away\ndon't don't constantly remind them that\nthey were once here\nfix yourself because a lot of people\nfeel like crap\nonce people start to leave their little\nnest like like if you're an alcoholic\nand this guy said i'm gonna stop\ndrinking you wanna bring him right back\nin\nno look at yourself in the mirror and\nsay wow this guy's doing better\ntake that feeling of feeling like [ __ ]\nand do something about it\nchange your own life absolutely well\nsaid man well said do you think we\ndo you think we do that subconsciously\nwe don't want to see other people grow\nand fly\nbecause we're not growing and flying\nthat's 100 it makes us feel like [ __ ]\nit's a constant reminder of where where\nwe're at in life\nwhen you see people start to even this\none person let's say you have a group of\n10 friends\nbest friends you guys party smoke weed\ndrink you guys are just nine to fivers\nmaking minimum wage\nwe're just getting by like good will\nhunting\nyou watch that movie yeah absolutely\nlove it\nthat guy wanted to stay there matt damon\nwanted to stay there\nyou know been out ben affleck was like\nno man get the [ __ ] out of here man\nthat's the kind of people you want to be\naround\nand those people very few people like\nthat exist in those crowds\nbecause you are a constant reminder of\nwho they are now\nthis guy got out now every day i wake up\nthinking god i'm a piece of [ __ ]\ni'm a piece of [ __ ] but i don't have the\ncourage and the strength and the\nself-discipline\nto do what he did so it's a constant\nreminder i don't have the courage but\nyou do\nyou do have the courage you just gotta\nfind it absolutely you gotta find it\nthat's the hard part yeah and where did\nyeah so where\nlet's talk about suffering a bit because\ni think what we're talking a lot about\nright now is\nthat journey for it to begin for anyone\nright it start it's painful\nyes it's an inconvenient truth it starts\nwith suffering it starts with pain\nthere's no other way you're saying\nyou've got to go back to your demons got\nto go back to their stories\nit's suffering how have you changed your\nrelationship with suffering because i\nthink everything's a relationship\nand your relationship with suffering\nfascinates me right so i want to know\nhow have you\nevolved in your relationship with\nsuffering and discomfort so think about\nwhen i say suffering\npeople cringe people that's the that's\nthe one word whenever i post about it\npeople cringe it's not about\nsuffering how people may look at\nsuffering like you have to just\ngo to a place that just every day of\nyour life is suffering\nyou have to tap into suffering every day\nof your life because we have so\nmuch scarring that we have to clean up\nyou have to look at suffering as almost\nlike i look at failure\nto succeed you must fail\nin failure and in suffering all the\nanswers\nare in there all the answers to all the\ntest questions the test is your life\nall the answers are in there you have to\nlive in suffering and pain and failure\nall the time\nyou have to learn i need to visit it\nlike people hate working out\nyou're only going to visit working out\nmaybe an hour a day\n23 other hours of the day you're not in\nit\nbut how you become in shape is you must\nvisit\nsuffering visit working out one hour a\nday\nvisit suffering one hour a day visit\nyour past failures\none hour a day the relationship with it\nis the answers are in there\nthey they are in there within the\nsuffering go in there\nand i call it the live autopsy the live\nautopsy how you find out someone died\nthey crack you open after you're dead\nhow you can live\nis do it while you're alive go back in\nyour brain crack it open\nwhile you're alive don't wait until\nyou're [ __ ] dead\nto figure out why you died do it while\nyou are living\ngo in there go into the suffering go\ninto the pain of your life and say why\ndoes this suck for me so bad\nwhy am i afraid of all this stuff why\nhave i shut down the whole\nworld i guarantee i'll tell you why you\nshut down the whole world\nit's in these nooks of the suffering\nwithin your brain\nin the scarring are all the answers\nto why you are on the couch feeling\nsorry for yourself\nthey lie within the scars visit them\nfor at least an hour a day study them\nand then you'll find out more about\nyourself you will then grow\nso don't look at us every day i suffer\ngo into it an hour a day\nlearn from yourself learn from life\nlearn from your failures learn from your\ninsecurities\nlearn from your self-doubt don't just\nsay i'm afraid to jump off an airplane\nwhat makes you afraid of it study it\nthat's why i studied my mind why i\nbecame so powerful in the mind\nbecause i realized i was weak so instead\nof running away from the mind\ni dove into and said what is making me\nweak oh\nthis makes sense i came from hell\ni came from a place that beat me down to\nnothing\nwhich is why i'm afraid all this makes\nsense\nso systematically one by one i went back\nand met every single person in my mind\nevery situation i went one-on-one with\nthem again\nin my mind it's okay let's\nnow revisit this and that's how you do\nit that's how it works\nabsolutely man that is i love that\nthat's brilliant advice\nbrilliant advice because it's ultimately\nit's observing\nand self-study that's it like observing\nand self-study becoming an expert in\nobservation\nright of oneself and\nthe reason why that that process\ncan be so challenging or that process is\nbecause like you said and i love that\nyou literally went through and re-met\nevery person that caused you pain\neverybody loved that and guess what\npeople say how'd you do that\nyou know every painful moment\nyeah you remember you remember it we try\nto put it under a rug\nlift the rug up you'll find them yeah\nthe dust will come up yeah they'll come\nup quick\nyeah so yeah that's how that's how i was\nable to write that book yeah\nyou don't forget that [ __ ] you want to\nyeah and that's where you fail\nby trying to forget it that's what you\nfeel that's where there's no growth\nlet's just move forward from all this\nyeah there's no growth there there's no\ngrowth there no\nyou just wanna you just wanna forget\nabout it yeah you will continue making\nthe same [ __ ] up mistake\nyeah you will continue doing the same\nthings wrong if you don't go back\nyeah and the challenge we have is when\nwe do revisit it when someone tries or\nstarts they end up revisiting it but\nthen we end up\nand we me too all of us like i'm not\nsaying when i'm whenever i'm referring\nit's me too\nit's it's also we become complaining or\ncriticizing or preparing so\nwe do start like i know a lot of people\nand myself too\ni sometimes start revisiting something\nright but then i just use it as a crutch\nor an excuse then i'm still not getting\nthere that's right i do the same thing\nyeah right i'll do the same thing how\nhave you broke through that times when\nthat's happened sometimes and\nso as i'm talking and as i'm going back\ni'm very aware that i'm going to do that\nyes\nand i may do it for 45 minutes\nand then i'm like you knew you're going\nto do this\nyou have to be very aware of the\nconversation you're having while you're\ndoing it\nbecause your mind chooses the path of\nleast resistance\nyour mind has the ultimate tactical\nadvantage over you\nit knows what scars you it it knows your\nfears\nit knows your insecurities and it\nprotects you which i talked about the 40\nrule in my book the 40 rules all about\nthe brain\nhas the tactical advantage over you it\nknows and it keeps you away from all\nthat\nthat's why it says don't jump out of\nairplane don't go in the ocean where\nthere's sharks\nit's a protective mechanism don't go\nback to the place where your dad beat\nthe [ __ ] out of you in your mind\ndon't go back the brain protects you\nbut protects you so much it doesn't\nallow growth\nso the brain is an amazing thing but the\nbrain controls you\nyou must control it you must take power\nover your own mind\nor your mind will guide you into all the\nsoft spites\nsoft places that your brain wants to\nlive in\nyour brain has enough information it\ndoesn't want to go through that process\nof of mind hardening doesn't want to do\nthat\ni gotta remember what time i gotta be\nhere what time i gotta be there\nthis is where i wanna stay i'm peaceful\nit wants to stay very peaceful away from\nscarring\nso that's that's what it is man yeah\nthat's what it is it's as simple as that\nand we just\nnever touch it like a like a box that\nyou look inside you just leave\nit there you just mark it scar yeah put\nit up in the attic yeah\nnever touch again let it get dusty yeah\nnow i wanted to talk to you about this\nbecause when i was reading about it\nin the book it fascinated me because it\nreminded me of my my three-month boot\ncamp as a monk\nthe first the first three months i'm\nsharing with you earlier the first three\nmonths of\nof monk training is super intense like\nreally really tough because\nthe whole point of it is to figure out\nwho's in and who's not right like they\ndon't want people to just be\nbe passengers on this side it's not a\nit's not a place you come to just have\nquiet\nand and don't do anything so that three\nmonth boot camp something that taught me\nso much i'd love to hear about\nhell week and specific programs you\nbuilt in your life that you went on\nand what did you learn from that what\ndid you take away but tell us first a\nbit about\nthe program and then tell us about what\nyou learned so what i liked about your\nthree-month hell week yeah you know was\nthe fact that\nthat's where you find yourself you find\nyourself when you were\nthe at when you're not comfortable\nyou're not comfortable on a\ndaily basis and that's how i started to\ngrow\nlike i said about the mind it wants to\nput you in that nice 72 degree\ntemperature\nwith with everything right there it\nwants to be in that nice with a little\nmassage therapist\nthat's where your mind wants to be it\ndoesn't want to be\nand we're going to talk about hell week\nso he doesn't want to be in hell week\nin hell week i i was in three of them i\nfinished two of them\nin one year only person never do that in\nstill history there's been people who\nwho have gone through a couple of hell\nweeks but in like five years\nsix years seven years eight years i did\ni was in three in one year\nthey say it takes off three to five\nyears of your life\nso hell week is 130 hours of continuous\ntraining\nyou might get two hours of sleep and\nwhat it does is\nit's designed to break a man to breaking\nman down to the parts\nwhere like i talk about the surface how\nit's fixing the surface\nif you only fix the surface you will\nnever get through hell week\nbecause what it does it starts to bring\nout these demons because even though\nthere's a lot of yelling\nand stuff like that there's times where\nit's very peaceful\nin a very eerie way so the first hour of\nthe 130\nis breakout they're shooting guns it's\nloud it's noisy your mind is\nin chaos when your mind's in chaos\nyou can't think so you're having fun\nyeah this is great yeah we're in hell\nwe're navy or trying to be navy seals or\nbad asses\nthen what they do and i don't even think\nthat they understand what they're doing\nbut i studied the mind it's perfect it's\npsychological warfare they go from an\nhour the first hour when you're going\ncrazy\nthe second hour of the 130 they put you\nin the cold water\nit's called surf torture now they don't\ncall it sir of torture because it's a\nkind of gentler word it's called\nsurf acclimation or something like that\nwhatever\neverybody's getting soft so they call\nserve torture\nfor a good reason they put you out there\nno one's quit yeah it's only been an\nhour\nmaybe a couple of guys have and you're\nin the pacific ocean which is never warm\nyou're all linked arms you're sitting\nthere and the waves are crashing over\nyou\ni went through winter hell weeks which\nis cold the pacific ocean is like 50\ndegrees it was 49\nthis particular night in my third hell\nweek\nand what it does is\nit makes your mind flip out we've been\ndoing this now for three weeks being in\nthis water\nbut for some reason now the water is\ncolder than it's ever been it's not\nour minds are fragile we can process\na day it's hard to process 130 hours\nthere's no end there's no end so the\nmind starts to ramp\nup so you're sitting there it's quiet no\none's yelling at you hear the ocean\nand you're freezing and your mind goes\n[ __ ]\nstarts to think i have another 129\nhours you're not going home you're\ngetting yelled at\nyou can be frozen so you panic you freak\nout\nand you want to quit what i realized\nabout the mind is those people who can\nbe in that time\nand embrace that time and be in that\nmoment and not allow the mind\nto go to 129 hours on hour one\nit's the control that we don't have in\nour minds it's a control that you had to\nhave for three months\nwhen you're miserable when you're\nsuffering when you're laying on the\nfloor when you're doing all the\ndisciplines it takes to be a monk\nyou cannot think about the whole process\nit will make you it will it will make\nyou so\ninsanely crazy it's impossible it's\ninhumane what i'm about to do to myself\nyou have to be able to break all these\nbig humongous painful things in life\ndown to the smallest molecule because\nthat's all the brain can handle\nthe brain can't handle hours and hours\nand hours of suffering\nbut it can handle right now i'm in the\npacific ocean\nand it's very cold and this is what i'm\ndoing\ndon't think about the rest of it so\nthat's what i learned from hell week\nthat's what i learned from being in\nthree hell weeks\nthat's what i learned from all the\nmilitary i went to ranger school i went\nto all these different schools\nto learn all of that to learn\nhow the mind process so i talk about\ntheorists\ni talk about practitioners a theorist is\na person who reads a book\ndoesn't do it reads a book learns about\nsomething\nand then talks about it a practitioner\nis myself\na practitioner is a person like me i\nwanted to be an expert in the mind\na mental toughness guy beyond mental\ntoughness the only way to do that in my\neyes\nis to put yourself in hell put in hell\nrepeatedly\nrepeatedly put yourself in hell and\nstudy how you\nprocess it and that's how i was able to\ncome up with all these different ways\nall these different tools to to slow the\nmind down\nin hell because the mind just speeds up\nthe mind wants to get out of the painful\nsituation the suffering it can't\nit can't process it so that's what i\nrealized by going through all these\ndifferent processes of\nbeing in hell weeks you know it's just i\nlove them\nhow the mind process is in hell were you\never scared that you would lose\nthe processing ability to be able to\ncoach yourself through it were you ever\nscared when you're there\ni was uh there's some times where the\nmind gets overwhelmed\nand you cannot slow it down but by\nthese these certain tools are developed\nby not allowing your mind to get away\nfrom the moment\nyou cannot you have to think about the\nexact moment that you're in\nbut i saw when i was younger the moment\nbecame too big\nwhen it became too big i spazzed out and\ni would quit\nbut now i don't think about even like an\nhour from now i'll be eating\ni don't even go there uh because then\nyour mind\ngoes oh no we must embrace this because\nnow\nthere's you have to be a leader in this\nmoment it's not about you just getting\nthrough it\ni had six guys i had five guys and six\nincluding me in my boat crew\nnow is the boat crew leader so now\nanother trick is this\nif you don't think about yourself\nthere's no pain\nwhich can also lead to pain later on in\nyour life but in these moments when\nyou're struggling if you are a true\nleader\nand you're worried about your men or\nwomen besides you\nyour mind doesn't care how cold you are\nanymore your mind's only worried about\ntaking care of the men and women besides\nyou\nso i started realizing man if i take\ncare of these cats to my left and my\nright\nin the worst moments my mind is no\nlonger thinking about you're\nmiserable david goggins get the hell out\nof here you think about how is john how\nis andy how was sam how was pete\nhey how are you guys doing you're not\nthinking about me so there's so many\nthings you can do to get outside your\nown head\nto then allow your body to be like hey\nwe're just a machine\nbut you have to let your mind be able to\nprocess all these different tactics\nto do that take a different vantage\npoint in life when you are\nin the hell you can't see the beauty of\nbeing in it when you're in it\nget on top of that mountain top in your\nmind get on top of that mountaintop and\nlook down in what you're doing\nyou can see a whole different world that\nworld is beautiful but you got to get a\ndifferent vantage point\nin this in the suck don't be in it\nspiritually get out of it get that soul\nlook down on what you're doing be amazed\nby the process of where you're at now\nand where you came from wow i've got\ni've got so many questions from that\ni've got so many questions for that okay\nlet's let's start with\nyou and i love that so you said one of\nthe tricks is when you stop thinking\nabout yourself because when there's no\nself there's no pain\nno pain and you start living for your\nteam the people the other people\nsuffering\ni love that totally understand that\nservant leadership wanting to go beyond\noneself\nbut you pointed out something really\nfascinating you said it can lead to pain\nlater that's right\nexplain that because i i get that so\ni've had this mentality for years\nit got me through a lot of hard times\nyou cannot use it\nevery day of your life that's yeah\nthat's what i was thinking you cannot\nuse it\ni use it as like my god this is the\nperfect\ni found it this is the trick you just\ntotally you don't even matter\nyou're just a machine you are a machine\nlike just just like a lever that's all\nyou are man\nyou're not you're not and\nin my book i talk about what that lever\nstarts to get rusty\nstarts to get crusty it starts to like i\ncan't even think about anybody but\nmyself so through the process what i\nstarted to learn\nwas that helps a lot and you can tap\ninto that all the time\nbut you have to be able to heal yourself\nyou have to be able to recover yourself\nit can't be something that you continue\nto do and do\nand do there has to be a recovery\nprocess for your mind your body your\nsoul your spirit\nencompasses your whole body so those are\ntactics\nbut those tactics must be oiled up that\nlever has to be oiled again\nto go back in it absolutely yeah it's\nit's it's not\nit's not an emergency use but it's used\nin specific moments\nknowing you can go back and it's so true\nthat for so many people who want to\nserve\nit becomes the default and i made that\nmistake myself when i became a monk it\nwas because\ni wanted to wake up every day and serve\nthat was my goal i was like i want to\nwake up every day\ni want to use everything i've been given\nto serve humanity i just want to serve\npeople i just want to give\nand i was just being that right and so i\nwould go through sleepless nights i\nwould push myself for weeks on end to go\nfurther for other people and it was\namazing because it felt fulfilling\nand it and it helped them too but after\na while i was broken i i\nlost my voice for six months i was\neating out of tubes\nfor six months i was writing on a\nwhiteboard you know it was just my whole\nlife kind of\ncrumbled i was sleeping 14 hours a day\nthen because my life kind of went to the\nother side\nyeah because i'd worked so hard to just\ngive give give give and i loved it\nbut in the process i broke myself\nbecause i wasn't refueling i wasn't\nthat's right renewing that's right even\nthough i was still taking i was still\nmeditating i'm still doing everything\nyup i talked about that big time in my\nlast chapter how it just\ntakes me to nothing how i'm where you\nwere at\nyou know it's taken me five years of\ndoing my\nmeditation my stretching my eating right\nmy sleeping right\nand you have to be on a constant\nreminder\nalmost like how you put a reminder on\nyour phone 15 minutes you got this\nthat has to be in your brain you've done\ntoo much\nstop and what happens in life is that we\nstart to see our lives become so\nsuccessful\nwe're making money we're doing this\nwe're doing that\ni went more i went more i push harder\ni'm all about pushing hard don't get me\nwrong obviously i'm\nall about it but to push as hard as you\ncan\nyou have to be mindful of the machine\nthat's pushing\nit is going to end up dying and then it\ntakes years to get it back so you lose\nthat time\ntotally that time is gone you know i\nlost five years\nof i could be crushing it where now i'm\njust now back to crushing it realizing\ngod man\ni learned the hard way that's really\nsometimes one way to learn\nyeah sometimes yeah sometimes one way to\nlearn that's how i've learned the best\nyeah how do you know those indicators so\nwhat are those indicators to know\ni'm pushing too hard or i'm i'm\nsuffering too much\nbecause it's hard to know right everyone\ngets in the gym even once a week or\nwhatever and it's like\nif you don't go off then you can feel\nlike you're falling apart after 10\nminutes do me a favor go to the first\ngo to the first page of the of of not no\nno\ngo to like the first three pages of that\nbook you see one one sentence\nokay to the unrelenting voice in my head\nthat will never\nallow me to stop okay the unrelenting\nvoice that we all have\nwhat happens to that voice i'm gonna\nanswer your question we all have a voice\nin our head\nsome of us are very spiritual some of us\nare not but we all have this voice and\nyou're doing [ __ ] up [ __ ] this is\nwrong don't do that\nthe more you don't listen to that voice\nthe further that voice gets away from\nyour head some people call it the holy\nspirit some people call it god some\nmonks whatever whatever you call it it's\nthere we all have it\nit's the right or wrong voice but the\nmore we don't listen to it the more that\nvoice\ngoes away the only voice you hear is\nyourself\nwe all when the only voice hears\nyourself you're wrong\nthere's a voice that guides you through\nlife when sometimes this guy in your\ndirection that you don't want to go\nthat's usually the right place to go\nit's that uncomfortable place\nso that voice is always talking to me\nbut we don't listen to\nit i listen to it and when i start\ngetting\nanxious nervous like i've done\nwe all know we've done too much because\nit's telling us i'm getting tired i'm\nwearing down\nbut we we go we go we go i started\ntalking to my fiancee hey\ni'm doing too much you start now like\nlike i did in hell week like i do all\nthe time the one second decision\nit's that decision when your mind starts\nto get so amped up whenever you can't\nhear yourself think\nyou got to slow down whenever you're\nliving off a schedule every day is a\nschedule every day's a schedule you have\nno time for yourself\nwhen you start and we all know it i\ndon't have time for this anymore i have\ntime for that anymore\nthat's when your mind and your body are\nsaying think about that\ni'm neglecting my fiance i'm neglecting\nmy disciplines of life\ni'm neglecting my reading my learning my\nmy workouts my\nmy my diet when you start neglecting all\nof that\nyou neglect one of them you can you can\nneglect all of them\na long time it's going to haunt you\nwhen you start seeing that my god i\nhaven't eaten right in a long time\nhaven't been sleeping right a long time\nit's going to be one of those things to\ntake you off\nso i'm i'm very aware of\nmy eating my sleeping my my my\ndisciplines\nof life and i started to get too far\naway from them\nit's a hard stop because what made me\nme are the self not just disciplines\nthe self disciplines of life\nand those are always in front of you if\nyou have any they're always in front of\nyou\nso that's so that's my hard stop yeah i\nlove that man that's great advice and\ni guess a simple example is is of like\nsleep like when you wake up in the\nmorning\nthat's right there's a party that's\ngoing i just go back to sleep exactly\nright\nwhen we used to wake up at 4am as monks\nsometimes three\nit's like there's the part and then\nthat's what you're saying and then all\nyou hear is\nyourself saying ah it's all right just\ngo sleep it's okay that's right but then\nthat voice has got quieter that says no\nyou need to get up that's right you need\nto get up\nand you've just pushed it away you just\npushed it away and that's the\ndiscomfort that you need to that's right\nembrace exactly\nso those voices are very important they\nthey can guide you let's think about\nlike i said\nthe mind's the most powerful weapon in\nthe world yeah\nit can guide you to being very\ncomfortable also yeah so you give you\nyou got to be careful the\nthe mind will trick you yeah and they're\nsaying this sleep in the day you deserve\nit yeah\nsometimes you don't deserve it so\nthere's that there's that fine line\nof of the mind getting the tactical\nadvantage over you to where you're like\ni've worked too hard yeah you really\nhaven't worked hard enough\nso yeah absolutely yeah in in when we\nwere trained as monks in the vedic\nphilosophy\nit talks about the difference between\nthe mind and the intelligence the mind\nis compared to a child\nand the intelligence is compared to a\nparent and so when the child goes\nloose when the mind goes loose when it's\nnot trained\ncontrolled disciplined self-disciplined\netc it can have tantrums it can throw\nthings out the pram right\nit demands more like a child always\nwants to sleep in right all right\nalways even if the child knows that it's\nbetter to wake up to go to school\nright a child doesn't want to a child\ndoesn't want to study for exams\nright because it's hard it's painful and\nthe adults role which is the\nintelligence which is often we forget\nthat it exists\nthe intelligence is that voice coaching\nthe mind that's right\nbut what often happens is the\nintelligence just tries to shout at the\nmind like a bad parent\nexactly the parent just shouts that's a\nhundred percent no teaching no education\nno\nno knowledge just shout that is 100 the\nway you explain that about the child's\nmind\nis 100 the truth i just want to sleep\nin always throwing tantrums never\ngetting what they want\nwhenever they don't get what they want\nthey throw attention but what happens is\nwe never grow\nwe we are 40 50 60\nstill throwing that tantrum we once did\nat seven and eight years old so people\nthink with age is growth\nno it's not you have to go back into the\nscarring to get the growth\nabsolutely because if if with age you\njust repeated what you did when you were\nyounger exactly\nstronger that's it right you've just\nstrengthened a bad muscle i'm throwing a\nbigger tantrum\nat 43. yeah that did it eight yeah so\ntrue\nyeah you just strengthen a bad muscle\nstronger stronger stronger stronger\nand then that can break you 100 that's\nwhy i love the monk mentality yeah\nand that's why i talk about my book a\nlot too is that mentality\ni'm not one but i've taken a lot of the\ndisciplines the self-disciplines\nfrom that mentality yeah to grow yeah i\nlove that man that's that's what\nfascinates you so much and i'm excited\nfor us to\nthis conversation's phenomenal and i'm\nloving it about your book and i'm\nexcited to have more offline\nconversations\ntoo because that's that's literally why\ni did it when i met monks who were\nliving\nextreme scenarios and when i look at you\ni i think about it too you're\nyou're an extremist right in a good way\ni'm saying in a good way like\nand when i became a monkey it was the\nsame thing i i had to go to the edge of\nmyself\nthat's right like i had to go to the\nextreme of myself 100\nto then realize where i could be placed\nand what's funny about that i often say\nit\non the other side of that extreme place\nthat i call\nsuffering call whatever you want there's\na whole nother world\nthat people have not even examined but\nyou have to go to that extreme place to\nexamine it\nwe want to stay here in this comfortable\nplace once you're willing to push\nyourself to that extreme place\nit's like a whole other universe it's\nalmost like like you're an astronaut and\nyou've examined something like up in\nouter space\nno it's always been there but you have\nto be going through all the muck and all\nthe [ __ ]\nto examine and realize why god do all\nthis crap there's a whole other\nwhole universe over here in my mind yeah\nyeah hold that universe\nabsolutely i want you to take on\ncapacity in the sense of\nso if someone's listening right now\nsomeone's watching or listening to us\nand they're just like\nyou guys are crazy right yeah i'm sure\nyou i'm sure you hear it all the time\ni haven't i haven't actually the reason\nwhy this is so exciting for me and i'm\nsure you can\nguide me a lot is i haven't shared as\nmany moments in my story even the ones\ni've shared with you today i'm not\ni've not really shared them because i'm\nwriting them right now right but\ni'm sure you hear all the time that\nyou're crazy what's your take on\ncapacity if someone's listening they're\ngoing\ndavid right you can stand in the middle\nof the ocean and it's 49 degrees\nand you can do that but for me that\nsuffering is me\njust starting something new is that true\nor\ncan they also achieve that capacity they\ncan also achieve that capacity which is\nwhy i wrote the book\nso raw because what we do so well in\nthis world is we see\nsuper human people and we title them the\nsecond we title them\nwhat that does that gives us a get out\nof jail free card\nis that they're the one percenters i'm\nnot even gonna try to do that because\nthat's not even in me\ngod made them special they're special\npeople there are no special people are\nspecial minds and the mind can be\ncreated\non your own you can do that yourself so\nthat's why i write the book like i write\nit so people can look at me and say my\ngod he came from this\nhe had to overcome all of this so\ni take away all the titles even crazy\neven the fact that he's super human all\nthose titles are now stripped away\nbut what's funny about that you will\nhave my book in your hand you will read\nit\nin its entirety you hear the audio book\nwhatever you get\nand by time you get to chapter 9 or 10\nyou already forgot chapter one two and\nthree of the hell i came through\nthat's a fast the mind wants to soften\nyou up and say\nthis guy's just nuts he's super human\nthat's how fast the mind you\nalready forgot what you read you and\nyou're and\nand you love the book you're loving the\nbook\nand you already forgot the first three\nchapters because your mind is saying\nthis is impossible\nit's already guiding you down that path\nof least resistance\nas you're reading the book it's how\npowerful it is so we gotta constantly\nremind ourselves of\ngo back to chapter one two and three\nalways remind yourself of those chapters\nof that you can also do this but you\nhave to first\nself-examine or live autopsy your own\npersonal life\nthe tricks of the mind man i said that\nis such a great\nexplanation of how fast the mind can\nfool you\ninto something someone has just\nexplained i do it all the time when i\nspeak to people i\ntons of speaking gigs now and i break my\nlife down\nand by the time i leave my god i'm like\nyou didn't hear\nthe first 30 minutes of my story did you\nyeah no i heard it man i'm like but you\nforgot it already\nthe mind's already tricking you yeah i\nlove that man\nthank you so much david man listening to\nyou today honestly like i was reading\nand then listening to you and\ni've seen you on interviews as well but\njust having the honor of being able to\nsit down with you\nand and talk to you about it has\nactually like been\none of my one of the most meaningful\nconversations in my life not just on the\npodcast\ni'm just in this conversation like\nlistening to you some of the things\nyou've said and the alignment we have\ngenuinely it's been it's been a powerful\nconversation the one we had before the\npodcast and the one we've done now\nthank you it's it's been really\nmeaningful to me man so i've definitely\nlike\nit's done a lot of work for me like just\nlistening to you i've been doing the\nwork sitting here\nso it's been meaningful i'm gonna listen\nback for myself so i\ni always end each podcast with five\nquestions it's called my final five\nokay final five minutes this is easy for\nyou because you're used to drills\nright uh it's it's the rapid fire i like\ndoing this because\ni mean i don't know if anyone can catch\nyou off guard because you're you but\nuh but these are questions that we just\nwant instant quick answers to the first\nthing that comes to your mind right so\nthe first question i have for you is\nwhat's the best advice you've ever\nreceived\ni didn't receive any advice and that's\nthe thing about it when i grew up i just\ndidn't receive any advice\nmy my family was in such turmoil that\nthe best advice i received is for myself\nand that has to be to study yourself all\nthe bad\nbecause the good's already there you'll\nneed to study that study the best stuff\nabout yourself\nand learn from that and grow i love that\nman that's that's such a beautiful way\nof looking at it and that's true because\ni think\nwe live in a culture where we're waiting\nfor someone else to come solve our\nproblems yeah right we're living in that\nculture i was very blessed\nto not have that and you know and that's\nhow i looked at my life too not to get\noff the five questions but\ni looked at my life in a way that i was\nable to find so much strength and\nnegativity\ni was able to flip it upside down versus\nme thinking my what was me\nmy life sucks i was able to say my god\ngod put me in the most\nin the perfect training ground to study\nmyself\nto become a straight-up you know\nscientist in my mind yeah so absolutely\nyeah don't worry about going away from\nthe five questions i did it\ni was i was getting into your answers\nyeah uh a second question can't hurt me\nif there's anything that can hurt you\nwhat is it oh there's tons of things\nyeah you know everything i talked about\ni'm i was afraid of my airplanes afraid\nof cold water\nafraid of afraid of myself so there's so\nmany things that can't hurt me but the\nbiggest thing that can hurt me is myself\nis allowing my mind to get away from the\nreality\nwe do we we build a false\nreality in our minds the real reality is\nthe one thing that can\nthe the false reality is the one thing\nthat can't hurt you\nyeah the real reality is the one thing\nyou can help and fix yourself\nabsolutely third question uh what's the\nthe third question that i wanted to ask\nyou is all around\nwhat's the uh one thing that you're\ntrying to learn this year what's the one\nthing you've been kind of like tackling\nthis year\ni'm a tacky i'm a big introvert so\nthis is very uncomfortable for me even\nthough i'm comfortable with you\ni know there's a lot of eyeballs on me\nright now so it's very uncomfortable for\nme i used to stutter real bad\nso it's trying to be in a spot where\ni am in that month like mentality\neverywhere i go and not allow the past\ndemons of even i'm successful now\nbut you still have those moments where\nyou go back and your mind's like\nremember when you were six years old\nand you started profusely at this play\nand you were so\nyou know it's those things that come\nback to you all the time so that's what\nit is\nawesome what's your daily meditational\nmantra or\nrepetition to yourself every day i tell\nmyself\ni used to believe i was the weakest man\nthat god ever created so now i believe\nthat i'm the hardest human being that\ngod ever made\ni don't care if it's true or not it's\nthe most important conversation to me\nit's the thing that drives me every day\nit it's the one thing that keeps me\ngoing every day is that\nyou must constantly be that man that you\nwant to be awesome man\nand fifth and final question what's your\npurpose right now\nmy purpose right now is to continue\ni used to have a wash rag when i did\nthis and you know how to take a shower\nyou have a wash rag and a cloth and you\nuh\nyou're sitting there and you're just\nlathering up and before you hang your\nrag\nup you want to get all the water to come\non it and you know get it all\nall that all you know all the suds out\nof it you want to wring it out\nand you want to hang it up so my big\nthing is when i live my life\ni want to make sure that when i'm dead\nand gone that i ring that wash rag out\nand that rashback is my soul\nand i also believe that we're going to\nend up one day meeting a maker\nif you believe in one and i believe that\nmaker knows everything about you\neverything about you knows i was going\nto be here and talking to you knows\neverything\nbut you also have a choice to make you\nhave a choice to make we have choices\nand the one thing that scares me to\ndeath in my life\nis getting to heaven and not being what\ni'm supposed to be\nand i believe that god has a chart and\nhe looks at the chart\nand he puts it in front of you and you\nget to heaven he says hey that's what\nyou're supposed to be\nand one of my biggest fears in life was\nto\nsee that chart and not have every block\nchecked off\nyou know i want to make sure that i'm\nconstantly pursuing\nwhatever it is i'm pursuing just to be\nthe best i can just constantly grinding\nmyself into a fine powder you know\nbut doing it in a smart way like i\ntalked about you can constantly grind\nyourself into a point where you're just\nsick\nthere's a there's a happy medium of\ngrinding so that's that's that's my\npurpose now to continue to push myself\nso others can see what is possible\nthat's beautiful man\neveryone that is david goggins new book\nit is out can't hurt me\nmaster your mind and defy the odds go\nget it if you love this conversation it\nwas literally\njust the tip of the iceberg we just got\ninto like\ni'm gonna say one percent of the book\nthere's so much more\nin here personal stories accounts and\nthe best thing is that there's\nchallenges\nat the end of every chapter where there\nare practical tools and tips that you\ncan actually do at home\nwith your friends people that you're\nreading the book with i think it's such\na\npowerful book in the way that it's\nwritten in the way that david is so\nvulnerable so open hoping that you're\ngoing to go there yourself as well i\nhope you're going to go there david\nthank you so much\nappreciate you so grateful man to meet\nyou thank you and and the fact that you\nturned up on this podcast and shared\nin an incredible way man thank you so\nmuch appreciate
