    "transcript": "to say okay it's okay to fail because\nyou're gonna be loved no matter what\ni had to look at it from a long term\nbecause i wasn't gonna give up on the\ngame\nright so i had to say okay this year i'm\ngonna get better at that\nnext year this and so forth and so on\nand then\npatiently i was able to catch them\nthe first question i want to ask you\nbecause so much of your content right\nnow that you're creating here at granity\nis aimed at helping young people aimed\nat helping children\nand as a father of four girls i wanted\nto ask you what's the biggest thing\nyou've learned about yourself\nby being a father uh you know it's\namazing like when you become a parent\nthings become much more you know life\nbecomes\nyou know yeah it lines things up for you\na little differently\nright like before you have kids me and\nmy wife we can travel anytime\nyou know there's work and you know you\nbecome very uh\nyou have a very clear focus when you\nhave children it becomes about them it's\nnot about you guys anymore\nright and so that shift it's a big one\nyou know it's one of\nkind of a selfishness together\nand then to being absolutely selfless\nand doing anything you can for your kids\nand so what i'm trying to do is create\ncontent to teach them\nfirst and foremost that's why i started\nthis whole thing it's just reading\nstories to them that i felt like didn't\nexist\nyou know our kids are athletes and\nthey love reading about princesses and\nall these fairy tales and\nyou know they get a little sick and\ntired about the man saving the princess\nevery time and\nyou know the same old stuff magical\nwines and all that my kids are athletes\nman\nthey want to learn about soccer balls\nand basketballs and volleyballs and\nyou know magic that comes from that yeah\nand i love that you're encouraging young\npeople to think more imaginatively about\nsports yeah\nand i think that's where you go a step\ndeeper you know for me\nobserving you and learning about you and\nhearing you speak in other interviews\nand everything what i'm fascinated by is\nthat\nyou've dealt with things in life pretty\nhead-on right you've always gone at it\nwhat took you a while what was something\nin your life that you were shy about\noriginally or\nthat took you a while to go head-on with\nbut then finally you got there and you\nfigured it out\nuh writing dear basketball that was a\nhard jump\nyou know because i had written before i\nmean i started writing\nprobably about 17 years ago so\npracticing every day\na lot of things that i wrote were were\nads and so\nyou write an ad nobody looks up at who\nwrote the ad right you can kind of\nthere's a certain\nuh anonymity that comes along with that\nright\nbut right there basketball was different\nyou know it's putting it out there for\nthe world to see it's trying to create a\nshort film\nand i didn't know if i could do it man\nand uh\nyou know it was my daughter who kind of\nput things in perspective for me gianna\nshe's now\n13 and she was like well you always tell\nus to go for it\nso\nyeah she put me on the spot she was like\nyou're gonna talk about it you're gonna\nbe about it basically and you know and\nthat that gave me the final push\ni love that when you started writing 17\nyears ago did you envision that one day\nyou would move into this storytelling no\nwas it just something you enjoyed\nno man it was something i enjoyed and i\nenjoyed writing ads it was something\nfunny about trying to\ndistill a message down into 30 seconds\nor a minute depending on the budget you\nknow what i mean\ntrying to say something important um\ntrying to speak to the you know brand\nattributes but also speak to something\nthat's greater and\nthat has a stronger message stronger\nphilosophical message and how do you\nconnect those dots\nso putting that puzzle together was\nsomething that was really intriguing\nyeah but like\nyou know i never thought i'd be writing\nnovels or movies and\nthat sort of stuff never man i love that\nman i love it how everything evolves\nnaturally and actually hearing you say\nthat\nit reminds me so my vision when i was\nsharing earlier became very clearly\nmaking wisdom go viral\nand i was like how do i take these\nteachings\nthat are like so sacred they're hidden\naway in these books\nand how do i make them really relevant\nand accessible and practical to the\nwhole world\nbecause i know that anyone can access\nthem they're universal right these\nthese teachers can apply to anyone but\nsometimes they're just hidden away sure\nand a young person doesn't know how to\nfind them so that inspires me hearing\nthem that's beautiful too because\nespecially in today's um in today's\nworld there's so much clutter\nyou know it becomes harder for kids to\ntry to weave through\na lot of the crap that's out there to\nfind uh stuff that's actually beneficial\nto them\nyeah it was i think you reminded me i\nthink eo wilson said\nwe're drowning in information starving\nfor wisdom\nfor sure especially that's why i think\nyour work is cutting through because i\nthink what you've managed to do with\nyour new work is that\nyou're finding ways to connect with what\npeople care about but you're taking it a\nstep deeper\nyeah right you're not you're not just\nsettling for like let's talk about\nsports it's not just about sports\nfor life right it's about the metaphor\nthat sports has for life i mean you know\nsports is the greatest greatest metaphor\nwe have\nin terms of dealing with life because\nyou know even if you listen to music\nmusic will give you guidance right that\nyou can then\nmeditate on and think about how you\nwould apply it in sports you have to\napply it\nin the here and now i mean you're faced\nwith challenges moment to moment you're\nfaced with pressures and anxiety and\ncommunication or the lack thereof and\nalso their stuff like it's in the moment\nso you have to live it\nand when you practice those things you\nbecome better at it but i just feel like\nin this day and age\nour children have become less\nimaginative\nabout how to problem solve and parents\nand coaches have become more directive\nin trying to mandate or give orders or\nteach kids how to think and teach kids\nhow to behave versus\nand tell them how they behave versus\nteaching them how to behave and so\nthat's why i'm creating these stories\nand creating this content yeah i love\nthat i think it's so true when you treat\npeople as\nkids then they always be kids right even\nwhen they grow up\nand for you it was really powerful\nbecause you've talked about this before\nwhere your father said to you like\nwhether you scored zero or 60 yeah like\ni love you\nyeah tell me what that statement meant\nto you at that time and and how did it\nactually motivate you to continue\nscoring 60\nrather than go oh i'm all right it's\nzero well it did more than that\nright so like the basketball stuff\nspeaks for itself\nin terms of what that comment made you\nknow did for me\nin terms of giving me stability and\ngiving me\nconfidence to say okay it's okay to fail\nbecause you're going to be loved no\nmatter what and that\nthat doesn't just mean basketball that\nmeans anything in life\nthat means writing that means being an\nentrepreneur\nthat means um having the confidence to\ngo for it\nand um i've seen too many parents do the\nexact opposite\nand it terrifies children and children\nbecome paralyzed by their own fear\nbecause they don't have that security\nblanket of love and comfort\nyeah absolutely how have you been able\nto in your life\nsee past the cloud of emotion\nto actually execute on things because i\nthink what we were speaking about\nearlier this\nchallenge that young people have today\neveryone has today of just so much\ninformation\nso much cloud of emotion so many\nfeelings so much childhood baggage that\nyou're bringing like how have you always\ncut through that\nand execute them you know i what i try\nto do is just try to be still\nand understand that things come and go\nemotions come and go the important thing\nis to\naccept them all to embrace them all\nand then you can choose to do with them\nwhich you want\nversus being controlled by emotion\nyou know a lot of times i've seen\nplayers even myself you know when i was\nyounger\nbeing consumed by a particular fear um\nand to the point where you're saying\nokay nah it's not good to feel fear\ni shouldn't be nervous in a situation\nlike not and it does nothing but grow\nversus stepping back and saying yeah i\nam nervous about the situation\nyeah i am fearful about the situation\nwell what am i afraid of and then you\nkind of\nunpack it and then it gives you the\nability to look at it for really what it\nis which is\nnothing more than your imagination\nrunning its course you know\nyeah absolutely yeah i love that because\nwhat you're saying is that when you're\ndealing with something it's almost like\nhow can i get to the root of it\nyeah because sometimes what we're\ndealing with like you're saying it's an\nimagination an illusion it's not really\nit's not it's not really a thing you\nknow like you think about game-winning\nshots and\nor game-winning free throws and people\ngo to the free-throw line and you're\nnervous about it well what are you\nreally nervous about if you unpack that\nokay\nyou're nervous that you're gonna miss\nthe shot all right so you missed the\nshot then what happens people are gonna\nbe\nembarrassed you're going to be\nembarrassed because thousands of people\nmillions people see you missed a shot\nall right and then what people are going\nto talk bad about you okay\nright and so you're looking at you go\nare those things even important\nyou know what i mean if that that is my\nfear like what is you worried about\nletting your teammates down\nokay have you let them down before well\ni'm sure and practice and things of that\nnature right they're still there\nyeah you know and so when you're able to\nunpack it you kind of look at it for\nwhat it is which is really nothing\nyeah i love that breaking it down i\nthink that's so important i think\neveryone who's listening and watching\nright\nnow next time you're facing a fear next\ntime you're going against something do\nthat like literally\nunpack it don't just settle for your\nfirst answer because\nthe first answer is really the right one\ndon't hide from it you know you got to\nbe able to look at it\nand you know and and and deal with it\nhead-on\nyeah i love that man and and you talk\nabout that because you talk about\nyou know when you talk about missing uh\nfive throws and you talk about\nuh getting over yourself yeah right like\ngetting over yourself how did you get\nthat mentality of just being like\ni need to get over this like i need to\nget over myself you know trial and error\nyou know you grow up and you make game\nwinning shots and it's awesome you come\nback the next day and miss a game when\nit's shot and it's misery\nand then the next day comes and you're\nback playing again and you understand\nthat life has this cyclical nature where\nit's\nyou know what you do on monday it's\nfantastic but then tuesday's a bad day\nbut guess what there's wednesday\nso we just supposed to live our lives\nlike this the whole time you know\nversus just staying like this and\nunderstanding that it's really just a\njourney of\nevolution every day it's just constant\nimprovement constant curiosity\nconstantly getting better\nthe results don't really matter uh it's\nthe\nfiguring out that matters yeah and we\nall get obsessed about the results\nyeah like we get obsessed about like the\noutput yeah not the input of not\nfiguring it out and not like changing\nthings what you said trial and error\nlike the experimenting\nyeah we forget to do that it's\nunfortunate man like i've seen a lot of\nplayers\num especially now you know in youth\nbasketball dealing with that\num you have players that are like bigger\nand faster and stronger\nand you know their coaches are just\ncoaching them for results\nyou know we're just going to use your\nsize that because you're bigger than\nevery other 12 year old out there\nto dominate today and but they're not\ngrowing\nright so they're just based on that\nresult but they're not focused on\ngrowing\nthis young child yeah into becoming a\nbetter athlete and through that\nteaching them how to become a more\nwell-rounded person\nand we're missing that yeah see what\nyou've said there just\ni want to ask you this and i'm not\nsaying because i you know like you know\nyourself best and you know how you've\ngot there so i'm asking it from a place\nof humility of\nlearning when i look at you i'm like you\nknow your superpower isn't just your\nwork ethic\nyour superpower isn't just like figuring\nthings out your superpowers like you\nthink strategically like that's a very\nstrategic\nthought of saying this person\ncould be this in the future if they were\ndeveloped as a whole individual\nright rather than just like let's use\nthem for the short term right and\nwhere did you develop that from that\nability to see beyond to think deeper to\nto reflect deeper where did that come\nfrom well i had to do that because\nyou know i grew up growing up in italy\nwhen i first moved over there it was\nyou know i didn't speak italian i didn't\nhave any friends\nyou know i had the game of basketball\nand through sport and playing soccer i\nwas able to make friends and build\nconnections\nbut it was a lot of time spent alone and\nand when i came back to the states i\nwasn't the most athletic kid\nyou know i was really scrawny like\nreally really skinny and had\nlike major knee issues because i was\ngrowing so i was the dorky kid with hot\nsocks and\nbig old knee pads it's fashionable now\nit's fashionable now it wasn't then\nand so um i had to look long term\nbecause in the here and now i couldn't\ncompete with these kids i mean there was\nkids that were like\n12 years old with beards like i can't i\ncan't\nwhat am i supposed to do with that like\nthey're doing windmills and dunking\nbackwards and i'm happy to like tap the\nbackboard you know so\ni had to look at it from a long term\nbecause i wasn't going to give up on the\ngame\nright so i had to say okay this year i'm\ngoing to get better at that\nnext year this and then so forth and so\non and then\npatiently i was able to catch him yeah\nthat's i love hearing that\nbecause i think so many of us kind of\nyou believe like when when you see\npeople like yourself it's like\nit's so easy as an excuse to ourselves\noh you're destined\nfor it right you were made for me it's\nkind of like that kind of you know like\noh yeah you know but but when you talk\nabout saying oh actually when i started\ni didn't have the\nphysicality that meant that i was gonna\nmake it like you had to figure it out\nand i love it figure it out man it's\njust piece by piece and it's the\nconsistency of the work which\ni feel like a lot of parents are missing\ntoday because we're not teaching that to\nour kids we tend to say like kids don't\nwant to do the work but in reality it's\nwhen we're failing them because we're\nnot leading them\nthe right way and teaching them yeah you\nknow how to fish you know what i mean\nand so like the consistency of work\nmonday\nget better tuesday get better wednesday\nget better right and you do that over a\nperiod of\ntime you know not like one month or two\nmonths i mean it's\nthree four five six seven eight nine ten\nyears\nand then you you know you can get to\nwhere you want to go yeah i think it was\nbill gates who's talking about that he\ntalks about how like we\nwe overestimate what we can do in one\nyear and underestimate what we can do in\nten years no doubt\nright like it's like that yeah like i\nthink everyone thinks about like what\ncan i do right now like how can i make\nit happen but like\nwith you i think people always ask you\nalso like you know how do you deal with\nlosing or failure what i'm intrigued by\nis how someone like you deals with\nwinning because you've won\nagain and again and like i was saying\nearlier you you know you want obviously\nwe know\nyou won in basketball big as an athlete\nbut you you're winning now even in the\nwork you're doing here as a storyteller\nas a producer right it's amazing to see\nso many incredible awards coming through\nhow have you dealt with\nwinning like when you win what goes\nthrough your mind\nto help you to continue well it's a\nlittle different like in basketball it\nwas different because\ni expected to win you know like i\nexpected us to win championships i\nexpected us to win five quite honestly i\nexpected us to win eight\num and so when you have that vision in\nsports it's a direct competition like i\nknow how hard they're working i know how\nhard we're working i know what\ntheir strategy is i know what r is it\nyou know so it's a little different so\nwe went in the nba it was like\nyeah we expected to do that but now we\nwe're going to come back and\nwe're going to do it again you know and\nso it's that constant like all right\nyou're churning you win one championship\ni'm back in the gym the next day working\ngetting ready for the next one\nnow uh it's different because it's not\nabout the awards you know you just wind\nup trying to create something that's\nthat's going to inspire someone that\nhopefully\nyou know through that inspiration they\ncan inspire somebody else and what i've\ncome to learn as my career went on is\nthat's more significant than any\nchampionship\nis how do you connect with somebody that\ncan then connect with another\nand then with whether the awards come or\nnot you know that's\nfor you know um you know\nthe academy of the word uh um\nbody to decide but you know like for us\nit's just to try to create things\nyeah well i guess now that's what\nshifted that now the intention isn't\neven expecting to win it's expecting to\nchange lives\nright right like your content is really\nabout making a difference and an impact\non young people sure\ni'm sure which i which i think is like\nthe biggest way of winning\ni think so i mean you know we're looking\nat 62 percent of young children are\ndropping out of sports\n62 and they cite the fact that it's not\nfun anymore\nwell what does that tell them i mean\nthat's telling us us as grownups are\ngetting in the way\nget out the way let these kids be\nimaginative which you know like in our\nstories it's important that yeah there's\na fantasy\nnature to it right but it's rooted in\nreality\nright when we have uh fire-breathing\nwinged horses and things of that nature\nthose are actual drills that are taking\nplace right now we don't have fire drink\nyou know\nfire breathing winged horses actually\nperforming that but we do have ball\nmachines\nthat are spitting balls at tennis\nplayers right and so\nall of our all of our stories are all\nanchored\nin an element of truth so that children\nfeel like when they are\ndoing these drills with these bald\nmachines they can envision maybe it's a\nfire breathing winged horse\nyeah to keep them excited yeah yeah they\ncan envision gus throwing fireballs at\nthem\nyeah yeah and uh even the plays like\nwhen the you know\nin the wizard art series when the basket\nis opening up and shrinking\nthese are things that we experience as\nathletes like some days i feel like i\ncan't make a\nshot man in the basket feels like the\nsize of a keyhole yeah\nyou know and other days it looks like a\nswimming pool\nyeah you know yeah that's magic and so\nwe we\nroot our magic in reality so that when\nkids experience these things\nparticularly the failure side of it they\ncan connect it to one of our stories and\nsay okay\ni've seen this before i know how to deal\nwith this yeah that's beautiful man i\nlove that that analogy of like\nfeeling the basket bigger or smaller and\nthen be able to vision that i can vision\nit right now\nlike yeah it's all right like some days\nit looks huge and i love that that's\nsuch a great way of thinking about it\nand i guess so much of this is from your\nreal life\nvision oh yeah yeah this is like some\ndays i've experienced this yeah\nbut i love that because it's also giving\nthem the permission to say like be\nimaginative about this right yes and and\nthat obviously gives so much\ni think when we imagine it changes the\nreality of oh i'm just sitting out here\ntaking shots\nyes right which can get boring and\ntiring comes mechanical\nmechanical that's the only way to get\nkind of cool like our job is to try to\ninspire the creativity inside of our\nchildren\nso that they can think through how to\nproblem-solve situations so like\nyou know when i coach my daughter's team\nit's not about giving them answers\nit's about asking them questions and\ngetting them to process things\nright when the game is being played i'm\nnot sitting there giving them answers or\nbarking out things on the sideline i sit\ndown and i'm quiet\nmy assistant coach sits there and she's\nquiet and the kids figure things out for\nthemselves or they don't\nand then they come back and there's\nalways questions and then you kind of\nask them more questions and you help\nthem figure it out\nbut then you see their level of\nexcitement the practice every day\nincrease\nbecause it's something it's a process\nthat they are owning right they're not\ncoming to get orders barked at them\nevery day they're coming\nfor for for kind of their personal quest\nto get better yeah and how did you how\ndo you\nfeel about you coaching i guess that\nstyle makes them feel comfortable but\nhow have you been able to\nmanage that with the pressure of you\nbeing there no it's no pressure because\nyou know it's their process to own like\ni i have knowledge information that i've\ngained\nyou know through playing so like the\nlittle details of things i can teach at\na high level\nuh but ultimately it's it's it's them\nyeah you seem you seem very still and\ndetached about it\nyeah yeah i mean it's it's you know the\nkids love playing basketball so that's\nthe anchor of it all\nthey come and they play and they learn\nand they have fun and you know and they\ncompete\nand you know they challenge themselves\nand one another and\num you know they just get better every\nday\nyeah how have you seen that with\nobviously with legacy and the queen you\nyou chose tennis yeah like what was the\nwhat was the choice of sports about i'm\nintrigued by the\nwhy tennis yeah so like the first novel\nwe did was the wizard series it was\nimportant that for that to be basketball\nbecause i wanted the first story to be\none of empathy and compassion\nand in team sports if you don't have\nthat you can't win\nright and so it was important to tell\nthe tale of a basketball team\nuh dealing with their own personal fears\nand have those fears and insecurities\nlead to empathy and compassion for\nothers right with the second story i\nwanted to look more\ninternal individually and and look at\nhow do you deal with the inner\nchallenges the kind of the self\nnegotiation that takes place inside of\nour own heads\nand there was no sport better than that\nthan tennis there's golf\nuh but tennis you have more movement\nwhich to me\nsymbolizes life in general because life\nis there's a lot going on\nright there's the elements in tennis\nthat you have to deal with as you deal\nwith in golf maybe not to the same\nextent but they're still there\nand then there's the confrontation with\nthe person across the net from you\nyes right as well as the strengths and\nweaknesses in your own movements\nand how you feel in your own body and\nbecause of that it was important for\nthis story to be a tennis story um i\nlove that that that makes complete sense\nand\ngive me an example of that self\nnegotiation i love that word and\nyeah i get that can you expand on that a\nbit yeah like you know\nyou're you're you're out running on the\ntrack\nworking out and you start talking to\nyourself saying man\nmy knee is really sore right now maybe\ni'm\nmaybe i'm doing too much sounds like me\nmaybe i need to back off\nyou know man my lungs are burning am i\nmaybe\ni can just slow down here i'll do like\nan extra two sets tomorrow\nyou know it'll be okay yeah right that\nsort of stuff yes\nlike that stuff's dangerous yes and\nthat's you just gotta say you know what\ni'm not negotiating with myself yeah the\ndeal was already made the deal was made\nwhen i set out at the beginning of the\nsummer and said this is the\ntraining plan i'm doing i sign that\ncontract with myself\ni'm doing it you know throughout the\nthat process you'll start talking to\nyourself like man i gotta\ni think i need to maybe if we nope\nno it's non-negotiable negotiable\nyeah yeah i love that and for you\nempathy and compassion were things that\nyou'd been through like that was that\nwas personally inspired work\nyeah when did it come to your awareness\nthat\nempathy was something missing for you\nand that you wanted to develop it\num i had a teammate that that\nspoke to me and said hey cole you know i\njust want to feel like as a teammate\nyou need me i was like\nwell duh i can't i can't you know\nlike that was my immediate reaction like\ndude yeah of course\nbut i had to kind of think about really\nwhat he was saying and where that was\ncoming from\nfor him and his story and his journey\nand what that meant to him\nand that opened my eyes that there's a\nbigger game being played it's not just\nbasketball but it's the emotions of each\nindividual\nand the backstory that they're carrying\nwith them the baggage that they're\ncarrying with them and if i really want\nto be a champion and be a great teammate\ni have to understand what those mean to\nhelp them become better\nand in turn help me yeah and do\ndo you think this content is going to\nhelp all the content you're creating\nhere at granity is that for you to help\nbuild better bonds between parents and\nkids\nlike are you hoping that the podcast for\nexample like kids are going to listen to\non the way to school or on the way back\nor like how are you imagining\npeople consuming the work yeah i mean i\nimagine it in\nin different ways you know but like\nultimately people always figure out a\nway to do it that's comfortable for them\nbut like\nyou know which is why um in everything\nthat we do we try to create the highest\nquality of product\nright like you know people will sit down\nand tell me they'll say okay well audio\nbooks\nvery small percentage of people listen\nto audio books we don't really have to\ninvest too much in doing audio books and\nwhat excuse me no because that one\nperson just listens to audio books that\none family enjoys audiobooks they have\nto get the best experience that i could\npossibly give them so that means\nusing a london orchestra that means\ndoing full symphonies that means having\nfelicia rashad read the stories like\nit means everything the books themselves\ni got this all the time there's no money\nin making books man nobody makes money\nin books and\ni'm sorry you want to make a book with\nusing what material\nyou want you know you know i'm like uh\nyeah because\nchildren matter so like i don't know how\nthey're going i i\nimagine how they're going to be\nconsuming content um\nbut ultimately it's my responsibility\nand our responsibility studio to make\nevery single thing that we put out\nthe highest quality possible yeah yeah\nno i can imagine i can imagine\nparents listening to it on the way to\nschool yeah i can imagine listening on\nthe way back or on the way to practice\nsure sure things like that like i think\nit's cool i think it's well the puny's\nfor sure like the puny's i was like you\nknow\nwhen i first made the puny's we're going\nto release it in the summer i think we\nreleased it in august\num and uh i think i think it was august\naround the same time\nbut my mind i was saying okay parents\nare going to listen to this every\nsaturday morning\nbecause i know i'm in the car driving my\nkids to soccer games and like\nyou know volleyball games and stuff so\nparents can listen to this with their\nkids in the cars they're driving the\nsporting events like that was kind of\nwhat i had in my mind\nand then when it came out it's like you\nknow teachers were using it\nmore so than anybody in classrooms and\ndoing like classroom reports on the\npunys and\nand all sorts of stuff so yeah never\nknow\nit's it seems that you study life a lot\nright like when you're talking about all\nof this imagination which stems from\nyour own\nwork like for example like when you're\ndealing with empathy and compassion it's\nreflected in the content when you're\ngoing through these visualizations of\nwhat could this look like it goes on the\ncontent\nyou study life a lot what currently are\nyou studying\nand what kind of gets your imagination\nreally growing right now like what keeps\nthat moving for you\nuh you know certain there's a certain\nelement of truth\nand everything you know and um you know\nthe creativity\ngenerally comes from personal\nexperiences first\nand then you kind of look on a broad\nkind of on a broader scope of okay how\ndo you take something extremely personal\nand then channel it in a way for\nmasses to understand and get their arms\naround sort of thing\nbut it always starts in the element of\ntruth and then you start unpacking that\nby sitting in thought and figuring out\nlike\ncharacter and you know who is this\nperson\nand you know who's his family and then\nthat's when i start getting in trouble\nyou know because it's like the questions\ndon't end yeah you know so i have like\nbooks and books and books and books and\nbooks and books and books and books and\nbooks of backstory\nbecause it's not good enough just to say\nthe characters this way yeah\nwhy are they that way yes for the\nparents well where do their parents come\nfrom\nyou know where's the dad come from why\nare they raising a kid this way and then\nyou know what does it have to do with\nthe economy that's around them and then\nand just one thing leads to the next and\nthen you're just writing all kinds of\nstuff\nit's crazy yeah that's awesome because i\nthink so many of us get you know in our\nlives we get stuck with imagination\nbecause you kind of get into that\nautopilot mode yeah doing the same thing\nevery day same routine same drive to\nwork\nyeah and it's like i feel that what\nyou're sharing is\nthat's easy for anyone to do it's not\nlike oh because you could be brian you\ndon't feel that everyone gets into that\ntrue\nyou're able to find these creative\noutlets yeah well you know like\ncreativity\nis in everything you know like even in\nconsistent like what i found is\nis creativity a lot of time comes from\nstructure\ni agree i'm just saying you said that\nwhen you have those parameters and the\nstructure then within that you can be\ncreative but like if you don't have the\nstructure you're just aimlessly doing\nstuff\nyes you know where are you going you\nknow so like having a clear structure of\nunderstanding okay\nthis morning i'm gonna like when i was\nwriting a wizard series and outlining\nlegacy\ni come in in the morning 7 a.m and i'm\nthere\ni'm writing backstory from seven to 12\nthen go pick up my kids and then i come\nright back and i'm writing again so like\nwithin that structure\nyou know my mind when i go to sleep is\nalready like\nplanning of what the next day is going\nto be because i know\nyou know what it is i have to do it's\nthat consistency and structure\nyeah i can agree with you more i'm\nwriting my first book right now oh wow\nand a lot of people have been asking me\nlike jay and and i'm like that i have a\nvery scheduled\nfocus on writing and they'll be like how\ndo you find inspiration at that time\nwhat if you're not inspired at that time\nand i'm like no the structure helps\nspontaneity yeah\nright it's that consistency that breeds\ncreativity well that's the thing too is\nlike\nyou know people think like it's you're\njust kind of just kind of\nyou know mulling along and all of a\nsudden aha\nyou know like the show that we have on\nespn now called detail yeah uh\nbasketball\nyou know sports breakdown show um\nthat came to me when i was walking\naround with my wife\nshopping yeah and i look at a piece of\nfabric and i'm like wow this is really\nthe detail\nand this thing is oh my detail this name\nof the show\nand then everything came from there but\ni had been thinking about\na show like that for like a year yeah\nyou know and\ni couldn't i couldn't shake it loose i'm\nlike what i got\ni gotta find a sports show that i'm\ngonna do but it needs to can't just be\nbasketball focus has to be broader\nand i want to hear from the best minds\nin the world hear from peyton manning i\nwant to hear from\nwhat is it what is it for like a year\nand then all of a sudden boom\nyou know and so people think it just\ncomes out of nowhere yeah you gotta like\nobsess over for a while and then it kind\nof pops loose\nabsolutely you had to plant the seed\nwell before yeah\nto see the fruit yeah and you gotta\nwater it all the time man like you gotta\nsit down and watch and watch other shows\nthat are out there and like\nyou know and then ultimately you just\nfind you know like\nwhen the answer comes to you it's like\nmy god i could have thought it on the\nfirst\nday i remember john williams told me\nthat he said he said he'll sit\nfor like two months to try to figure out\nwhat the melody is\nyeah and he'll just be playing he'll\nhe'll be at his piano all day he'll say\nthe only day he'll take off at sunday\nbecause his wife forces him to take\nsundays off\nand he'll just be sitting there riding\nright right and then it just comes\nyeah and he's like i seriously could\nhave thought of that on the first day\nlike why\nit's just so simple yeah absolutely and\nthat's what people don't realize is well\nlike when you go out then you're\nshopping with your wife and you see\nthe detail and you're like okay that's\nthe show and then you go back into\nconsistency to create it\nyeah it's like you know it wasn't just\nlike oh now i thought of i'm just gonna\nthrow that idea\nlike now i'm going back to the drawing\nboard have the name now\ndo it around i try to what i try to do\nis shoot the idea down\nand figure out everything that's wrong\nwith the idea ooh okay\nright this show won't work because like\ndetail for example like this show won't\nwork because it's not for\nfans it's for the one percent athlete\nyeah\nall right well will would it be\nsuccessful people connect to it like you\nknow you start\nunpacking every little thing how would\nwe shoot it can i even get peyton\nmanning to do it could i get\nyou know and uh you start shooting them\ndown same thing with the novels like\ncharacters and plots and stories\ndoes this make any sense no here's why\ni felt like that really helps me yeah i\nlike that approach a lot actually\nbecause i think sometimes especially\nright now in the world we go to the\nwishful thinking side like you have the\npositive vision and you're like oh this\nis how it's going to turn out right\nand then you ignore the bad stuff yeah\nor you ignore the kind of like the\npotholes or the loopholes because you're\njust like\noh no i don't want to focus on the\nnegativity yeah but actually what you're\nsaying is\nif you're aware of it of those known\nunknowns then you can actually break\nthem down yourself well yeah\nit's just like the same thing for any\ngreat movie you have to have\nthe antagonist yes you know a strong\nvillainous character will really drive\nthe narrative along if you don't have\nthat you have nothing from which your\nhero has to bounce off of\nyou know that that villain could be you\nknow maleficent\nit could be something inside of you it\ncould be whatever but you have to have\nthat clear antagonist that's driving a\nnarrative forward and\nso in this sense it's the same thing you\npick apart the negative and from that\nyou can then move yes move forward\nabsolutely what i'm loving here right\nnow is that\nall i'm hearing is like kobe the\nstoryteller like i'm loving it like\nwhat i feel is like what i'm hearing\nabout is your obsession and\nobsessiveness\nyeah with stories and it's not just\nlike you know i i'm saying this it's\nlike you've really studied stories like\nyou've really broken them down and\nunderstood it where tell me about where\nthat obsession comes from in general how\nyou find obsessiveness and how you've\napplied that to story\nyeah obsessiveness just comes from\nsomething that you love like you really\nlove it you'll go through fire for it\nyou know you'll go through the ups and\ndowns with it and you'll just keep at it\nbecause you love it so much you know\num and story for me started a long time\nago i had a great english teacher at\nlower marion high school\nuh named jay mastriano and she explained\nto me the art of story telling my\nsophomore year\nand that's where i started falling in\nlove with it and understanding story\nstructure\nyou know how to develop compelling\ncharacters and how this thing how\nstories\num are the driving force whether they're\ninspirational informational\nthat really change society yeah\nabsolutely yeah we're defined by the\nstories we tell ourselves\nwhether personally or or outside\nabsolutely absolutely\nand and it seems like you just mentioned\nthat it just shows the role of teachers\nand now when you find that teachers are\nusing the work you're creating to teach\nthat must be amazing comes full circle\nyeah you know and\nuh you know it's a it's a it's a\npretty cool feeling man like i like\ngrowing up when i was in high school man\ni didn't read much at all\nyeah you know because basketball was my\nthing now if you give me a basketball\nbook\nor like a sports book or like a sports\npsych book or i'm devouring that\nyou know what i mean because it was a\nclear focus for me which kind of gets me\ninto this market a little bit too\nbecause like for our active\nchildren that love being outdoors and\nplaying all the time they're not reading\nno but they're missing out on so much by\nnot reading\nbut they will read if there's something\nthat they feel like\nspeaks to them so true you know and so\nnow i think we get\nmore readers in the world because of it\nhopefully so true no i think so i agree\nwith you like for me and and this is why\neveryone's different and i think there's\nsuch a need for what you're doing\nbecause\nwhen i was growing up i never enjoyed\nfiction\nand so i thought i didn't like reading\nbecause all the books that the school\nsuggested were fiction books right\nand then when i was 14 my dad handed me\nan autobiography and a biography\nand i devoured it and then i started\nreading because i want to hear about\nreal people right\nwho break and who develop and who learn\nand grow and like have been through\nfailure and like i want to hear about\nrags to riches and i want to hear about\nlike i want to hear about real people\nwho went through real pain that's right\nbut i grew up believing that i didn't\nlike reading right and i think that's\nyou're so right i think there's a lot of\nkids out there who think they don't like\nreading\nor they think reading is boring it's a\nproblem because like what i found in the\nindustry which is why we self\num publish because a lot of publishers\nwant to publish the same type of story\nyou know the same type of uh plots\nuh same looking characters\nnot a lot of diverse characters out\nthere at all and\nuh so we said you know what we're gonna\nhave to do this on our own this way we\ndon't have anybody in our way telling\nus what the market wants to hear i don't\ncare about that we write stories that\ncome from the heart\nand our characters are going to look\nlike my daughters because my daughters\ndon't have characters out there that\nlook like them it's a great book so\nyeah they're going to look like my kids\nand uh and we're gonna go from there\nyeah i think i think what you've just\nraised there about diversity and\nrepresentation is huge\nit's huge man huge because i don't see\nit man and like you know it\nso books is just the first thing\npublishing is the first thing now if we\nlook at animation\nis even worse it's even worse you know\nin terms of developing characters\num diverse characters but even beyond\nthat the animators themselves\nthere's no diversity in that industry\nright\nnone and i'm talking not just racial\ndiversity but gender diversity as well\nand so there's there are a lot of things\nthat we need to take on that we are\ntaking on\nand uh hope to make the world and the\nindustry a better place because of it\nyeah no i i fully agree with that i'm a\nbritish indian right born and raised in\nlondon in it never seen any character\nanywhere right because they think you\nknow the mass market\nthey're not going to it's not going to\nappeal to the mass market so we're not\ngoing to do that yeah exactly\nwait what what yeah and\nand everything's spreading so fast now\nand everything's global now yeah right\nnearly all content is is global now and\nmost global markets are growing\neverywhere so the need\nfor people especially young people being\nable to see themselves in characters\nand and even and it's it's not and i\nthink it's a deeper point that you're\nmaking is you want to be able to see\nyour story in someone right\nright even just beyond like color and\nbackground it's like your story your\nexperience of life when we made your\nbasketball\nwe got a lot of pushback from people\nlike i i took it to\nsome very prominent studios at first and\nthey all said\nyeah no um because you said basketball\nis too sport specific\nnobody's gonna connect with this sort of\nthing because you know there's a lot of\npeople out there who don't watch\nbasketball\nand i'm like well that's not the point\nyeah that's not yet it's not the point\nand so it was really a case study even\nwith our novels everybody was like\nsports novels nobody's going to read\nthat it's too too much of a niche market\nin each market\ni'm like sports is bigger than that man\nand so we made their basketball to\nreally prove a point\nthat you don't have to watch basketball\nat all\nto connect to the journey of a dream\nyes you know and uh once we saw that\nconnection was kind of\nkind of validated our point of view i\nthink that's a massive point of view and\nfor anyone who's listening or watching\nright now who thinks\nbecause kobe bryant wants to do\nsomething it just happens it just shows\nyou have to do it yourself sometimes\nbecause not everyone's gonna believe in\nyou certainly not right\ncertainly not and what you'll see is you\nknow once you start doing it\nand now people want to come and jump in\nbut i'm like you know\nyou kind of forced us to go about this\nourselves so\ni think we're just going to build it\nfrom the ground up ourselves but yeah\nthank you\nexactly they saved you yeah right thank\nyou appreciate it because if you guys\nsigned on you know we just\nget kind of going with the flow totally\nyeah you can be grateful to this yeah\nyeah yeah absolutely no i agree it was\nthe same with this podcast funny enough\nwhen we launched\na lot of people were a lot of people\nwere considering whether it was\nyou know gonna like you know you do\nsocial videos like is it gonna work on a\npodcast and there were a lot of people\nthat were not sure\nand then like we launched some of the\nbiggest podcasts in the world in in the\nhealth category which is which is my\nworld and i was just like everyone's\njust like oh interesting but i'm like\nthank you\nyeah like thank you so much for saying\nno and you didn't think it was going to\nwork\nbecause now i figured out myself yes and\nwhat you said it actually builds\nconfidence\nand validation yeah oprah told me this\nwhen i\nfirst decided to uh build the studio and\ni was asking how harpo came to be\nand she said well when she was doing her\nher deal\nfor the oprah winfrey show she was\nreupping her deal\nand uh actually the first contract she\nmade she uh she said well\ndon't pay me up front just i want to own\na percentage of the show\nand so they gave it to her now at the\ntime there weren't any black women\nhosting a daytime talk show no right so\nit was really new\nand uh and she said you know kobe if\nthey believed that the show was going to\nbe successful\nthey wouldn't have given me giving me\nthat\nthey wouldn't they win them in their\nmind they're thinking oh we gotta steal\nwe don't have to pay her we can take\nthis money and move it over here\nthis is great you know it's going to be\na flop or we succeed i don't know at\nleast we get diversity on tv\nit's fine and all of a sudden it's oh oh\noh\noh oh trouble we shouldn't have given it\naway\nopened up pandora's box right so now you\ncome back for the next deal and it's\nlike\nyou gotta have to give me some more\nownership yeah like dang it\nhere and then ultimately she you know\ncame to only 100 of her show yeah\nwhich is amazing wow that's a great\nstory yeah that's fascinating i think\nbecause sometimes when you think that\nyou're like oh they like me that's what\nthey're giving it no\nyeah no don't like me please here's an\nidea it's terrible yeah i just need you\nto buy in just a little bit\nyeah i love that that is awesome how are\nyou encouraging\nyou've shared so many stories of like\nyour teacher who taught you about\nstorytelling and writing early on you\njust shared\noprah's example like you've had so many\nincredible mentors in your life we all\nknow about that\nhow are you encouraging young people to\nfind the right mentors\nand how can they find the right mentors\neven through your work i guess your work\nis somewhat mentorship\nyeah we try to be you know and i think\nthe important thing is research\nyou know in the hall here in the office\ni have a hall that i call muse hall\nwe have all the portraits of some of our\nmuses here from\njk rowling to you know steve jobs and so\nforth and so on\ni think it's important to research them\nand it's like putting\nyou know fuel in the fire every day you\nknow there's constant inspiration when\nyou read about them what they were able\nto accomplish how they went about\naccomplishing it\nit's just constantly you know feeding\nthat flame\nand learning and the best way to do that\nis to learn from the people who have\ndone it\nyes yeah that just made me so happy i\nhave a gallery wall in my home\nif we were recording this at my place in\nhollywood like i have a gallery award\nsteve jobs is right there yeah yeah\nright and\nand and einstein's there martin luther\nking's there and there's a few other\npeople and it's\nfor me it's the same thing it's like\nsometimes i'm sitting there and i'll be\nlike what would that person do like how\nwould they have dealt with this\nchallenge\nright and you're so right i think you\ncan be mentored by people who aren't\nalive\n100 because their stories still live\nwhich brings us to the importance of\nstorytelling yeah\ntheir stories still live these muses are\nhere it's important to learn from them\nand uh and if anything it helps you\nremember that they are human just like\nus yeah these great things that get\naccomplished can be accomplished yeah by\nothers\nand beyond you know building walt disney\ncompany is not something that you know\npeople look at and scoff at and go oh it\ncan't be done\nwell why not why not yeah and the more\naction you take the more you think is\npossible\nyeah because you realize there are\npeople just like us they make mistakes\njust like us\nand they kept going and uh we can do the\nsame\nabsolutely man well i could talk to you\nfor hours but you're a busy man and\nyou've got loads of things to do so we\nend\nevery interview with what we call the\nfinal five
