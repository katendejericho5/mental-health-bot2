we're\ngetting to learn about them behind the\nscenes and today's guest is someone who\nI met just a few moments ago I've been\nlooking forward to this interview for a\nlong long time I'm so glad to

being\nhere well thank you for having me it's a\npleasure to finally meet you in person\nand and to be here when I was\nresearching as I do for all my guests\nI can listen to interviews I'll read\narticles you haven't done a lot of\ninterviews you don't talk so much about\nthings publicly I was wondering why did\nyou feel now was the right time and this\nwas the right platform you you've got\nsomething special in all the in all the\ndifferent interviews you do I think you\nget out the best out of the of the\npeople and it's something very special\nof course we do lots of interviews but\nthey are mostly based on our racing\ncareer of course which I'm very happy to\nspeak of uh and about all the time but\nit's good also to get to know the the\nperson behind the the steering wheel in\nour case we always have a helmet as well\nso it's difficult to put a face on the\nname sometimes and I think it's a great\nway to uh maybe show a bit of myself\nyeah definitely and I want to thank you\nfor that I want to thank you for\ntrusting me and I want to say how\ngrateful I am that you allowed us to\nhave this conversation because it's not\nalways comfortable to take the helmet\noff and do this and so I appreciate it\nbut let's let's dive straight in I want\nto ask you what would you have\nbeen if you weren't a race car driver oh\ngood question to with uh probably an\narchitect I love design in general I\nwouldn't have been good enough to be an\nartist but uh but definitely an\narchitect I love architecture in general\nit's uh another passion of mine so yeah\nprobably an architect nice and do you\nthink that some of that passion is\nhelped with being a Formula 1 racer with\nthe engineering the understanding of the\nC the design do you think that's\ntransferred or not really not really\nbecause uh obviously with my I had to\nstop quite early School uh to um put\nmyself into and and having the best\nchances in order to succeed in that\nsport you need to very early on taking\ncrucial decisions and uh my parents were\nalways very supportive of of that which\nobviously helped me as well but so I I\ndidn't do the study to get to uh being\nan architect or or close of being an\narchitect uh but it's always something\nthat interested me so no it did not help\nmy racing career but it's definitely\nsomething that I would like to look at\nonce my career is done uh to maybe um\nyeah be able to do something there don't\nspeak too soon we don't need your we\nwe've got you've got many many years\nahead of you so we we'll put that out\ninto the Far Far Future when you first\nhad the experience of driving your first\never race Cary as a young boy I believe\nyou were like four years old yes three\nand a half three and a half walk us\nthrough what you remember what was the\nfirst time you remember driving a car\nand you remember how you felt and what\nwas that feeling like well first of all\nI started by total coincidence I was a\nkid three and a half years old I didn't\nwant to go to school that day and uh I\nsaid my father I was ill and he believed\nme by coincidence he had to go and see\nhis best friend which owned a counting\ntruck so I uh got in the car with him\nwent there and then I was seeing the\ncarting going around the truck and I was\nasking can I try but obviously at 3 and\na half years old there are not really\nany cards uh made for a 3 and a half\nyears old kid uh but luckily for me the\nowner um which was Jules bian's father\nPhilip bian uh had a cting made uh for\nhis son when he was three and a half so\nthere was everything ready and uh I\ntried for the first time there and I\nremember uh the first lap they attached\na rope to my carting and there was an\nadult driving in front of me just to\nmake sure that I will be able to turn\nEtc and after the first lap we took off\nthe rope and I went on until there was\nno fuel left um so it was an amazing\nfeeling straight away I I enjoyed the\nfeeling of being in control of uh\naccounting at such a young age was\nsomething very very um amazing to\nexperience and I like I love the\nadrenaline that it gave me so it was a\ndefinitely a very special moment I\ncannot remember it because I was too\nyoung but at the same time I've got\nimages that my uh father had done of\nthis day which uh yeah gives you back a\nbit the feeling of the day yeah that's\nbeautiful to be able to look back yeah I\nwas thinking if you remember that from\nthree and a half that's impressive I\ncan't remember anything from when I was\n3 and a half years old but pictures do\nsuch a wonderful job of of doing that\nwalk us through the level of discipline\nand rigor and training that you've had\nto adopt I feel like the Formula 1\nseason is like Relentless it's long it's\ntiring it's exhausting when I look at\nthe amount of races there are when I've\nspoken to other drivers it's just it's\nall encompassing like your whole life is\nabsorbed into this of course how have\nyou allowed yourself and we're getting\nto the end of the season right now as\nwe're taping how have you developed the\nstamina like what does it take to see\nyourself through to the end when it's so\ngrueling and so demanding it changes a\nlot in in your career because you start\nin in cting where there you are spending\na lot of days on track but it's always a\ntrack that is very close to your house\nso even though you travel or you spend a\nlot of time in the car to get to the\ntrack you are racing all day you come\nback at home the evening it's still\nquite easy in a way because it's all\nvery very close then you get to uh\nsingle seaters formula 4 Formula 3\nFormula 2 where you've got to travel a\nbit more all around Europe I'll say uh\nbut you've only got like 12 13 races to\ndo in a year so it's still not too much\nit takes a lot of time of course but\nit's still not too much and then you get\nto Formula 1 and it's 24 races now all\nover the world and in between the races\nyou also got to do a lot of events\nsponsorship events for the preparation\nof the races I'm going in the simulator\nin maranelo so lots of things are adding\nup which uh makes it a season that is\nextremely tiring and especially when we\nget to the end of the season like it is\nnow uh it is more and more difficult but\nthen it's all\nabout trying to um uh plan the things\nbetter I arrived the first year in\nFormula 1 and to be honest I was a mess\nI I arrived and I was doing the flight\nmyself I will get to the track uh the\nday just before uh the practice will\nstart and I will be super tired and\nespecially the end of the season then\nyou don't manage to stay at your 100%\nall the time and then of course with\nexperience you learn now there are uh a\nwhole team of people helping me in all\nof this because it's super important to\nbe 100% at the end of the season and now\nyeah you you you plan the things better\nin order to uh uh to keep a good quality\nof life training diet that uh sleeping\nis super important the different time\nzones uh all over the world is very\ndifficult to manage as well but now I am\nup to speed with that yeah I love\nhearing that I remember I've interviewed\ndifferent athletes in different sports\nand I remember speaking to one athlete\nwho at the time was at the cusp of I\nthink potentially going to One Day\nbecome one of the one of the best and I\nremember asking him like what his\nroutine was and how he prepared and he\ndidn't have one and and it didn't get\nbetter like it didn't improve from there\nand then you see that it's hard to\nsustain a career like that walk us\nthrough because I think people are\nfascinated because I think anyone who's\nnot a fan of F1 or hasn't watched drive\nto survive as we were talking about\nearlier or doesn't understand it they\ndon't recognize how physically demanding\nit is to sit in a car I'll just give an\nexample to everyone I went go-karting\nlike two weeks ago and I was nowhere\nnear going as fast as you go obviously\nin an electric go-kart and I came back\nwith like the ribs yeah with completely\nbruised and like and that's just from\nlike a little kids go-karting thing it's\nso demanding in so many ways walk us\nthrough first of all walk us through\nyour like your diet your sleep what what\nis that routine like for you personally\nwhat do you eat what what do you need to\nbuild in terms of working out Etc and\nthen talk to me about what actually\nhappens during a race to you like what's\ngoing through your body and mind the\nsleep for me is the number one priority\nit is so incredibly important is where\nobviously you uh you rest and uh recover\nall the energy in the body that you need\nand it's something super important so on\nthat I'm I'm I'm super strict I'm a good\nsleeper I probably sleep around 10 11\nhours a night so really really a long\nlong long time wow do you have any\ntricks for that or you're just a good\nsleeper no I'm a good sleeper the only\nbig problem I have is that I don't sleep\nin Planes for some reason I I struggle\nto sleep in Planes um which I spend a\nlot of time so I need to uh take the\nplanes by day so I can stay awake and\nall of these kind of things but uh but\nagain that is part of of planning diet\nI've got a dietitian in Milan that is\nfollowing me and sending me all the um\ndiet requirements I used to have\nsomething very repetitive which then you\nget bored of um now it's a lot more\ndiverse so it's very difficult to to get\ninto the details of what I say but it's\nmore carbohydrates especially when raise\nday are coming our weight fluctuates a\nlot throughout uh throughout a week of\nracing because uh you get the Friday\nbefore train before the practice uh\ndriving practice and you're quite heavy\nbecause there you ate a lot of\ncarbohydrates that takes the water you\ndrink a lot of water you need to be well\nhydrated but then we go through extreme\nheat inside the cockpit so you lose so\nmuch water and in some races you can\nlose up to three and a half 4 kilos of\nof water which um is very difficult then\nin the one or two days days after to\nrecover from that yeah this is super\nimportant the hydratation plan and uh\nand and and the dietition plan in order\nto be fully on it throughout throughout\nthe weekend and then physically it is a\nvery strange sport in a way because\nthere are muscles that no the sports\nreally use which especially the neck by\nexample the neck is probably the the the\nhardest part to train properly because\nit's full of little muscles that you\ndon't use and that is very difficult to\nreproduce in a gym so driving is\nbasically the only training you can get\nfor that as much as you are trying with\nelastics to try and reproduce that but\nit's very difficult whenever we get to\nthe first day of practice in February\nafter the winter break you speak to all\ndrivers and uh at the end of the first\nday they are all so tired so tired just\nbecause the neck is a very difficult one\nto uh to use but to train but then lots\nof cardio training uh it's super\nimportant\nand another thing that is also difficult\nto to train is the breathing techniques\nbecause with the g-forces sometimes it's\nvery difficult to to breathe normally so\nwe do a lot of apnea in the corners but\nthis is something that you get used\nyears after years driving Formula One CS\nyeah wow no really great really great\nbreakdown there because I think you\nnever think about for most people you\nnever think about the neck you're never\nthinking about obviously the breath the\nlosing of weight is is incredible you've\ntalked about before that in your your\ncarting days your mental health or your\nlike your resilience your mindset was a\nlot weaker how did you experience that\nwhat did that look like back in the day\nwhat do you mean by your mindset was\nweaker then I was extremely harsh on\nmyself which I think now is a strength\nbecause I'm I'm super honest with myself\nand I I don't like to be nice to myself\nwhenever I do a mistake I'm I'm very\nharsh and I'm I'm very honest with\nmyself but at the same time I think the\nreaction from that is extremely\nimportant the way you react to mistakes\nyou've done inside the car this is where\nyou manag to transform a mistake into\nsomething positive from from learning\nfrom it and when I was younger I I\ndidn't have the right reaction I would\nput myself so much down it will also\nhurt my my self-confidence now it's very\ndifferent I I know that I got to a\ncertain level because I worked hard of\ncourse because there's also a part of of\ntalent that you have when you are young\nit's super important to keep the\nself-confidence super high in those\ndifficult moments otherwise you can lose\na little bit the way the direction uh in\nwhich you need to work and uh it can\nmake things a bit more complicated so\nthat's where I was struggling when I was\nwhen I was younger yeah I I love that\nyou brought that out because I feel like\neveryone can relate to that like whether\nyou drive cars or you don't everyone can\nrelate to the idea that we can be harsh\non ourselves we can be heavy on\nourselves we can be self-critical and\njudgmental how do you or how did you\nlearn to like let's say you've just done\nthe first lap and you made a ton of\nmistakes or you feel like you're behind\nI can imagine that it's so easy for the\nnext two laps to just be lost in\ncriticizing yourself and the thought in\nyour head just being should have taken\nthat better should have done this should\nhave done that how did you grow to have\na more positive relationship with that\nhonesty and that self-criticism as\nopposed to that thought repeating in\nyour head has that happened before have\nyou ever felt that where you're\ncriticizing yourself during a race or\nthere's no time for that actually no I\nthink I think adrenaline helps us in our\nsport to not think too much because you\nhaven't you haven't got the time to\nthink you go from one corner to the\nother if you're already thinking about\nyour last Corner you're going to do a\nmistake at the next corner so you've got\nto mentally reset at every corners and\nif you did a mistake you need to reset\nfor the next Corner which is in one\nsecond so it's super quick but I think\nadrenaline helps you I think where I\nstruggle more is when you finish a\nrace on multiple laps and you are\nlooking back at it and you're like okay\nthis this I shouldn't I shouldn't have\ndone that mistake I should have known\nthat I should have prepared for that and\nthen I was putting myself down and that\nhad a a much longer effect as well\nbecause then for you need to wait for\nthe next race in order to move on and uh\nthat's in one or two weeks time and for\none or two weeks you're like okay I just\ncan't wait to be back in the in the\nstarting to show what I can do uh but in\nthose last two weeks you need to accept\nobviously the the view of others which\nwas also something that was hurting me\nback in the past and it's it's just not\nnot good for for for learning from your\nmistakes are you excited for the next\nrace to prove yourself that's what it\nsounds like like there's that feeling of\nadrenaline of like okay I can't wait to\nbe back on the track have you ever had a\nmoment where you're like I don't want to\ngo back on the track because I'm scared\nor I'm I'm fearing losing or failing\nnever never because I love so much what\nI do and in every tough times I think I\nalways like to remember myself when\neverything started when I was three and\na half but I I don't remember that time\nso around seven or eight years old the\nway I looked up to Formula 1 the way I\ndream dreamed of being in a position I\nam today a Ferrari Formula 1 driver\nthat's all I dreamed for I still want to\nwin a world championship which is\nanother dream of mine and I'm working\nfor that but in all of the difficult\nmoments I\nalways remember myself how lucky I am to\nbe in that position and living off what\nI love most which is driving so that\nremind me how much I love this the sport\nthat I'm doing and how much I love what\nI do no matter the situation I'm in yeah\nthat's a beautiful mindset to have and\nhow have you kept that gratitude like\nI'm listening to you right now and I\njust feel you sound so grateful and so\nHavey to be here it's not an egotistic\narrogance but it's a sense of like joy\nand excitement like you still have that\nfreshness with it even though you've\ndone it for 20 years now yeah like how\nhave you kept that freshness like what\nis it that makes you fall back in love\nwith it um because you're so young but\nat the same time you've done it for so\nlong exactly yeah it's been 23 years\nthat I'm in the sport now so a very very\nlong time but um I don't know just the\nadrenaline that it gives me being luy\nenough to work with so many incredibly\ntalented people because all the\nengineers all the mechanics all the\npeople around the team are people that\nhave um focused their own life in order\nto arrive to the position they are in\nnow and to be able with to work with so\nmany incredible people is uh is a big\nchance so uh whenever I work with them\nit's always super interesting you learn\nevery day in this port because it's a\nvery complex Port there's the driving\npart of course but then there's all the\ntechnical part of the of the Cs and yeah\njust being able to stay with those\npeople speak with those super\ninteresting people and also do the\ndriving which is what I love the most\nwhich is uh yeah whenever I put the\nhelmet on I've got a smile on my face\nbecause the the adrenaline that I get\nwhen uh I get on the throttle getting\nout the pits is something super special\nso um yeah I love what I do yeah it\nsounds like you're so Fearless on the\ntrack and you've built that mindset as\ntime has gone on what about off the\ntrack is there anything that scares you\nany fears that exist Does does that\nfearlessness on the track help you off\nthe track or is it just two different\nworlds and two different things no no no\ntrust me I'm I'm scared of of uh of\ndifferent things snakes I hate I hate\nsnakes I tried Benji jumping and I\ncouldn't jump you didn't do it no but\nit's weird because at the same time I\ndid parachute uh skydiving skydiving and\nI loved it but uh but yeah you know\nBenji jumping I couldn't jump so I was\nsuper scared at the same time as you\nsaid whenever I'm in a race car there's\nnot 1% of me that is that he's scared\njust because being in control helps a\nlot I think and um yeah no I'm I'm never\nscared there's naturally those external\nthings that scare you as well and I\nwonder you know you've been through when\nI was when I was looking back at your\njourney and listening you've been\nthrough so much loss in your journey and\nI think for you to continue to show up\nin the way you are right now with love\nand gratitude and joy that takes even\nmore courage than sitting in a car and\nand and driving at that speed because\nit's almost sometimes like\nemotional emotional transformation is\nsometimes harder than physical and and\nmind mental transformation like walk us\nthrough the losses that you've endured\nand and how you've been able to kind of\nchannel that grief into growth I think\nit's made me grow faster I lost my\nfather in 2017 so I was obviously very\nyoung and at this time of your career or\nyour life you need that person that\nhelps you grow as a man and also as a\ndriver because he was basically my uh\nbest Mentor he was also a driver himself\nback in the day so obviously he was\nhelping me with all his um experience\nthroughout the years that he've learned\ninto into racing um and to lose him at\nthat age made me um yeah an adult much\nmuch uh faster because you get to U\nmanage your own things much early year\nuh before that I was just a kid he will\njust bring me to the races I will do\nwhat I love the most which is driving\nthen flights organization planning that\nwas all on my father and he was doing\nthat perfectly and uh he sacrificed a\nlot for for me to get here but then at\none point from one day to the other\nthere's not your father anymore and you\nneed to take all of these things in\nhands I've got my younger brother also\nmy older brother was uh he's 10 years\nolder than me so he was already an adult\nin a way but but my younger brother was\n3 years younger than me I had to take\ncare of my mother as well so all of\nthese things is it's not something that\ncomes natural when you are 17 or 18\nyears old it took some time to get used\nto it but I think it we all got much\ncloser in the family after after that it\nwas a difficult moment as well to lose\nmy father because I think I was in the\nage of around 14 to 19 where you are\nalways clashing a little bit with your\nparents after that I think it got puts\nus all together much much closer than\nbefore yeah what was what was it like\nracing that year like you know having to\nshow up again now where you don't have\nyour mentor and you don't have the\nperson who believes in you and loves you\nand TR you like what was that like\nbecause I think that that is that's so\nbrave and and it requires an inner\nstrength like what was that for you how\nwhat was it like I don't know it was on\nthe on the Tuesday of Baku I had a\nFormula 2 race I was in Formula 2 not\nyet in Formula 1 and uh he passed away I\nthink on the on the Tuesday and I had\nthe flight on the Wednesday to get to\nthe race as soon as he passed away I\nasked myself what would he want me to\ndo and I had no doubt I mean there was\nonly one answer um he was leaving for\nracing he loved so much racing and he\nloved seeing me\nracing and especially when I won so I\nknew I had to go there and uh do\nabsolutely everything to try and win the\nrace and that gave me an extra\nmotivation as well to make him proud\nfrom from up there so uh it was uh super\nimportant for me to do that what was his\nreaction when you won and what was his\nreaction when you didn't win I think the\nhonesty to to myself always came from my\nfather he was always super honest with\nmyself um with me he was um obviously\nharsh whenever things weren't going uh\nthe way he wanted or whenever he thought\nthat there was a mistake that was to be\nmade at that at that time of of my\ncareer but at the same time incredibly\nhappy whenever I won uh you could really\nsee how much it meant to him um so he\nwas coming to every races absolutely\nevery races but I will say he was a bit\nof a different father on Races because\nthe father tends to be always with the\nkids on races and always be there and\npushing them and he was always doing a\nstep back on that trying to Le let me\ngrow in my own environments with my\nEngineers me with my mechanics and get\nthere at the end of the weekend and then\nhave the discussion at the end of the\nweekend okay I saw that this you should\nhave done better but this was amazing\nand he was always super\nsupportive and also in difficult moments\nI think that's all you need sometimes\nthe good person a person that is\nobviously close to you that only wants\ngood from you uh for you and and that\ntells you supportive words and I knew\nthat this was a a huge help that then I\nlost when I lost my father obviously\nthere was still my mom but my mom\ndoesn't have the technical knowledge\nthat my my father had on on race\nbut it's super important to have close\npeople that then also along your career\nwhatever level you are at can tell you\nthe right things at the right moment for\nyou and uh yeah this was super important\nto me yeah he sounds like an amazing man\nit sounds like such a wonderful\nwonderful mentor to have in life and is\nthere any words of advice that he said\nto you or something he shared with you\nthat you feel you always kind of carry\nwith you whether it's on race day or in\nlife is there something that he left you\nthat you feel you always turn towards to\nalways stay humble and grateful I think\nthese are the two words that he always\nsaid because even when I was six or\nseven years old I've had years where\nyears that were extremely good for me at\nthat age where I used maybe doing 24\nraces and I would win 18 other 24 races\nand at that age you get carried away\nlike I'm the best and this is uh yeah\nthis is for me I'll get to formul one\nand he was always there child you're\nonly six years old Formula One is a very\nlong way uh so you need to keep working\nstay uh stay humble it was always always\nin a funny way that I was doing that\nI've I've never been arrogant in a way\nbecause I think it's a trait of our\nfamily we we are all all like this but\num but yeah I think these are the two\nwords that I always keep and remind um\nme of it and especially the Grateful\npart yeah how how do you stay humble\nwhen like you said you're you're racing\nthe dream you're you're driving Ferrari\nlike you know life's great like things\nare awesome opportunities are everywhere\nlike how and I can feel it from you by\nthe way I I believe it and and anyone\nwho's listening or watching I'm sure you\ncan feel it I can sense it just from\nfrom sitting with you that that it's\ntrue how have you how have you remained\nthat way and how do you train yourself\nto remain that way obviously comes\nnaturally in your family which is\nbeautiful but but is there a practice of\ntempering with your ego in a way that's\nhelped you not really yeah not really no\nno the the I mean to be humble I\nthink yeah I've never really worked for\nfor that it's just words that my father\ntold me and I always remind myself\nbecause as I said sometimes you can have\nfour really really good races and you\nfeel like okay I I found the Rhythm and\nit's very easy in those very very good\nmoments to maybe work a little bit less\nthan in the very difficult moments and\nthis is maybe where sometimes I remind\nmyself Charles yes you are in a very\ngood moment of your career but that you\nstill need to work as hard as in a very\ndifficult moments because all the people\nthat are now struggling are going to\nwork and going to catch up at one point\nso you need to keep working as hard as\npossible where I have to do a bit no not\na bit more work but where I I have to\nthink a bit more it's in the difficult\nmoment be to be still grateful to be um\nin the position that I am because when\nyou leave the moment and that you\nstruggle with uh a race or two three\nraces in a row lots of critics are\ncoming to you obviously it's a sport\nthat is quite it's getting bigger and\nbigger especially in the US now it's is\ngetting huge in Europe it's all it's\nalways been huge but there's a lot of\npressure when you are a Ferrari driver\nas well even more so uh because it means\na lot to to people all around the world\nand you need to manage those pressures\nin the difficult moments and it might be\ndifficult also to manage the opinion of\nothers in those very difficult moments\nand it might hurt you personally as well\nthat's where I always try and work on\nremembering how grateful I am and how\nlucky I am to be in that in that\nposition yeah definitely was there a\ncriticism or that kind of feedback that\nlike hurt you the most where you like oh\nthat was hard to deal with that was\ndifficult what what would that be if\nthere was one the critics that hurts me\nthe\nmost are are the ones that doesn't\nDefine me uh as a person um I think in\nthe world we are living now with social\nmedia everybody can give their opinion\nsuper easily and also people that don't\nknow you personally yeah I remember like\ntwo or three years ago someone was say\noh look how arrogant he is and these are\ncritics that really hurts me because I\nknow I'm not I'm not like this and um\nit's difficult to accept them when you\nare not when you are not really like\nthat and uh I remember that hurting me\npersonally then you always get Critics\non your driving or if you do a mistake\nin a race or whatsoever but this is part\nof the sport this\nused to hurt me back especially the\nfirst year in Formula 1 because you get\nfrom a Formula 2 driver where there are\nno media nobody talks about you you do a\nmistake and only my mom or my dad will\nsay Okay Charles you you did a mistake\nthat it's not good where you get to\nformula one and then you are in the\nspotlight of absolutely everything you\ndo a mistake and hundreds or thousands\nof people are speaking about it on\nsocial media which it takes a bit of\ntime to get used to um I remember the\nfirst year in formul one I\nI got into form one I was watching\nabsolutely everything that people will\nsay about me because it was it was new\nfor me and then you get to learn to just\nmake sure that you only value what\npeople you love most think about about\nme and and that is only what matters to\nme yeah and that's and that's hard to do\nlike you said like you go from being in\nFormula 2 where no one's talking about\nyou to Formula 1 where everyone's\ntalking about you and I think people in\nthe world have that experience as as\nwell that we're now living at a time\nwhere everyone can comment everyone can\nshare everyone can say something I know\nI struggle to deal with it as well like\nI find it really difficult and I love\nwhat you said that it's always when it's\nabout your character that it hurts more\nif someone says like oh you didn't get\nthat technical thing right whatever I\ncan live with that but it's really hard\nwhen it's about you as a a human yeah in\nin your truth when you're like well no\nno I'm not like that like I wish I've\nsaid this before I wish that I if\neveryone who felt that way about me I\nwish I could meet them personally\nexactly and hold their hands and just\ntalk to them for a second and say look\nthis is who I truly am am and I'm so\nsorry that somehow you felt that I was\nthat way and whatever it was I'm I'm\nsorry that it made you feel that way but\nI promise you this is who I truly am but\nyou exactly that exactly that no no you\ncan't too many people um I always try\nalso to use the social media in order to\nreflect my true self MH then if someone\ndoesn't like my true self and then it's\nlike this I I won't be liked by\neverybody else in the by everybody in\nthe world this is uh this is normal so I\njust need to be my true self but as you\nsaid it's just difficult when someone\nunderstand a trait of your personality\nwrong and then criticize it and you're\nlike that's that's not me and I wish I\ncould prove you but it's it's life yeah\ndefinitely you were saying earlier that\nyou know fear and what you're scared of\nand I've I've read before that you've\nsaid that you're scared of when your\nbrother's driving like that that is\nsomething that you get scared about so\nyou're not scared when you are driving\nand you're in control when you're not in\ncontrol walk me through what goes\nthrough your mind like what is that what\nis that fear what's that experience\nbecause as much as I'm not scared for me\nat all I'm still completely aware that\nit is such an incredibly dangerous sport\nas much as there's been so much safety\nimprovements over the years it is and\nwill always be a dangerous spot because\nwe go at crazy speeds and anything can\nhappen whenever I'm in control and I'm\nracing not one part of me thinks about\nthe potential risk I'm occurring doing\nthat however when I see someone I love a\nlot doing exactly the same thing then\nyou see the things very differently of\ncourse I'm always looking at the\nperformance but for me what is the most\nimportant thing of all is his security\nhim making it safe to the end of the\nrace and then whatever else comes\nsecondary it's not as as enjoyable to\nwatch racing when my brother is racing\nbecause it's just super scary and I get\nsuper super stressed what's the fastest\nyou've ever been and when you've watched\nyour brother what's what's the fastest\nSE ever been where you've been worried\nor was there a race where you felt like\nH that was the one every single one it\ndoesn't matter every races is a torture\num so do you even watch no I do you do\nyou still watch because of the\nperformance and you want to help him out\nbut it's difficult because also we are\non the same race weekends and most of\nthe times I've got meetings preparing my\nrace at the same time of his race right\nand so I need to look at the race but at\nthe same time same time be focused on my\nmeeting and this is the hardest task\never but fastest speed probably 370 kph\nwhich is around 230 miles per hour I\nthink something like this I don't think\nthat is the impressive part of Formula 1\nthe straight line speed is fast but you\ndon't really feel it in a car like like\na Formula 1 car it's mostly the braking\nthe speed in the corners is something\ncrazy and and very difficult to um to\nput into words and to make it understand\nin a way no I know I I only know how\nhard it is just from playing the video\ngame yeah like that's that's already you\ntry play F1 video games like it is one\nof the hardest things do you play on the\ncontroller or do you have a simulator oh\nno I on the controller I haven't got the\nwheel yeah get the wheel\nyeah even that you just recognize just\nhow challenging it is like it's when\nwhen you're training did you ever have\nyou seen obviously I'm sure you've seen\nbut when you're training I'm sure\nthere's accidents I'm sure you see\nthings that are that are painful to\nwatch either with yourself or with\nothers you love like how is that like\nwhen you're training because obviously\nin F1 they've made it safer and\neverything but training is like training\nright it's not the same standards well\nfirst of all it's a very different sport\nto others uh football or whatever other\nsports in the world you can train as\nmuch as you want in form one you can't I\nonly have three days in the Formula 1\ncar over the year and then it's the\nfirst race that is the only practice I\nget is three days in the new car you\nneed to understand what's the behavior\nof the car that's not long at all that\nis nothing that is nothing and then all\nthe rest is done virtually so you race\nyou practice on simulators without the\ncontroller with the wheel this time but\nbut you practice on simulators in order\nto get ready for the real thing and then\nyou've got three days in order to get to\nget up to speed um to understand tons of\ninformations from the car that is mostly\nuh on the engineers to do that and then\nyou need to be ready at the first\nqualifying session a week later this is\nvery very very difficult then as you\nwere\nsaying we all know it's a dangerous\nsport um I've unfortunately lost my\nsporting Godfather in 2014\nbiank who was an incredible driver and\nhe had a fatal Crush in in Japan and\nlost his life there and also another\nfriend antoan in 2019 in in Belgium and\nthese are very very difficult moments\nbecause then you are racing on this\nexact same track you are going through\nthe exact same corner where a person\nthat you were closed with lost his life\nand this is the two moments in my entire\ncareer where you have a bit of negative\nthoughts going into that corner and you\nneed to battle a bit through them in\norder to think about something else and\nand get on with it as much as it's it's\ndifficult because a part of me was like\nI cannot get on with it like nothing\nhappened but at the same time you've got\nto do that at least as soon as you get\ninside the car until you get out of the\ncar you need to do that you need to\nfocus fully on driving otherwise you are\nnever able to extract the maximum out of\nthe car yeah that balance between\nacceptance we often think like it's\nacceptance or action and actually you're\nsaying it's both together there's an\nacceptance of the truth of what happened\nand then at the same time you have to\ndrive and it's not either Raw it's not\nlike okay I'm going to get over this and\nthen we're going to drive because that\ncould take forever yeah and you can't\njust drive and ignore it because it will\ncome up and I remember I mean I remember\none of my favorite movies is Rush uh\nwith Nikki louder and James Hunt like\nthat's probably one of my favorite\nmovies and it's you see so much of the\nworld of like the ego the the fame the\nsuccess the the focus the amount of\neffort the competition like you you see\nthe dangerous side of it like there's\nit's it's so well done the movie I've\nalways been a fan I wonder whether\nyou're a fan of that movie or whether\nyou're like ah it's not like that at all\nno I I love it I love it I mean I think\nit's um a really good representation of\nwhat the sport was back then yes yes yes\nnot now yeah and it was amazing to see\nhow it was back then and how it is now\nand how much everything has changed and\nI also think that as much as today when\nI say that I'm getting into the car and\nthere's not one part of me that think\nabout the danger I really believe that\n30 40 years ago that was completely\ndifferent for the drivers back then and\nthey\nprobably I think it was the driver that\nwas willing to get the closest to\ndeath that was the fastest because they\nwere so brave the cars I've driven all\ncars\nnow and there was no safety like the\nwhere they had the legs is just\nsomething like this of metal and if you\ntake if you take if you take a wall\nthat's that's it and obviously I'm sure\nthey had that in mind somewhere which\nnow everything is so much safer that you\ndon't you don't think about it anymore\nso I think the the sport has evolved\nlike crazy since then but it's a great\nmovie yeah yeah no and I love hearing\nthat like it's so interesting obviously\nwe know it's changed but to hear about\nhow much the cars have changed how much\nsafer they are like the the level of\nrisk that a driver was taking back then\nis is insane it's unfathomable to even\nrecognize like you're saying it's\ninteresting for someone from the outside\nto even look at that what was your\nfavorite car that you've gone back and\ndriven is there like a favorite era or\nlike a a favorite year that you you've\nseen or exposed to and why why is it\nspecial I've actually driven the nikila\ncar um that was very very special\nunfortunately I had a problem on the car\nwhile driving on the brakes uh which was\npretty scary but um I really enjoyed\ndriving that car but it was completely\ndifferent I think also in terms of\ndriving it was super different you had\nthe the gearbox you you had the shifter\nso you had to press the the clutch every\ntime you w pass the gears like in a\nnormal car today but now in a Formula 1\ncar everything is electronic so you pass\nthe gears you only press a button you\ndon't have to press the clutch you don't\nhave to press anything and you your\nbrain can focus on many many other\nthings we've got hundred thousands of\nthings going on on the steering whe that\nwe need to touch while driving but you\nhaven't got to think about the gears\nanymore back then I think the gears was\na super important part of of of driving\nbut I really enjoyed driving this uh\nthis La old cars this was very special\nyeah it's amazing I can imagine the\namount of attention this takes like like\nwe said you're on the road for a long\ntime you're doing so many races a year\nyou've got so many things happening in\nfront of you while you're on the race\nit's natural to experience burnout like\nit's natural to become exhausted do you\nfind that your what do you do as\nrecovery like you were saying like and\nyou just came from the Brazil race like\njust now like what a couple of days two\ndays ago yeah two two days ago yeah two\ndays ago like what did you have to do in\nthose two days to just feel normal again\nif normal is even a reality I love music\nI play piano and I've seen videos of it\nyou're pretty good yeah kind of but good\nenough to uh um to enjoy it and to\ndisconnect from everything and uh For Me\npiano and and music in general is an an\namazing way of disconnecting myself from\nthe pressure of of Formula 1 from for\nFormula 1 as a whole you don't sing\nthough I don't no no better better I\ndon't think just just playing the piano\nbut uh yeah playing the piano is\ndefinitely one of uh the thing I love\nmost disconnect and and recharge my\nbatteries and has that been a part of\nyour life for a long long time through\nthe whole journey actually not at all I\nuh I started doing uh Co lots of time at\nhome I had a simulator so I was driving\na lot virtually every day but uh yeah\nwith twitch actually but after two weeks\ntwo weeks and a half doing that all day\nwas getting quite iring so I I bought a\npiano I started um then and and I I\nloved it wow yeah and what what is it\nthat like how do you how have you taught\nhave you simply taught yourself to play\nlike is that how it's worked or yes I\nalways um when we were younger um my\nyounger brother used to have a piano so\nI sometimes was playing on it but not I\nnever took like courses or whatsoever\nand uh I thought Co was a great time to\ntry and learn it a bit more pushing a\nbit more and trying to understand a bit\nmore how everything works so I took some\nlessons like five or six but very\nquickly I realized that I wasn't done\nfor lessons so I just uh told myself the\nthe piano and try to came up with\nMelodies and musics that I enjoyed yeah\nsometimes I thought I will be on the\npiano since an hour and I will look the\ntime and it will be four or five hours\npast I I just really really liked it\nyeah it it's nice to hear that you've\nhad and I guess Co was a surprising time\nwhere people had a bit more time or to\ntake up hobbies and try new things but\nI've always found that especially\nFormula 1 like it's so grueling there's\nso much attention required there's so\nmuch Focus\nrequired how has your and we were just\ntalking about it when you when you came\nin today like you don't have that much\ntime for a personal life you've got the\nevents in between you've got like how\nhave you made sense of that what does\nyour personal life look like when you do\nhave time how much time do you get a\nyear actually let's start there like how\nmuch time do you get a year where you\nactually got time for your family or\nfriends and yourself I will\nsay maybe 40 days 40 days yeah like 30\n40 days a year we've got two weeks two\nweeks and a half in August and then two\nweeks two weeks and a half in um in\nDecember so for Christmas and and\neverything but then also with Formula 1\nthe good thing is that we travel all\nover the world but years after years you\nalso go to always the same places um\nwhich then you meet new people in the\ncity\nand then you've got group of friends a\nlittle bit everywhere around the world\nwhich is also super nice so whenever I\ngo to Brazil here in Los Angeles um\nMiami I've I've got my group of friends\nthere so it's um always great to come\nback to a race obviously you want to\ndrive as much as possible and be in the\ncar again as soon as possible but at the\nsame time you've got your friends there\nso it's not like my private life is\nsuffering a lot from it my mom also now\ncan follow me on on races is I think\nit's more when I was a kid there it was\na bit more difficult in a way that you\nare sometimes you are leaving school for\ntwo or three weeks for different races\nand there you don't spend as much time\nwith uh your home friends I used to not\nspeak Italian and English when I was a\nkid so you get to the counting tracks\nand you cannot really speak with anybody\nso that is a bit more the difficult part\nbut at the same time I was so incredibly\nhappy to go to the racetrack to drive\ncting that that was making it all all up\nfor it yeah are there any other athletes\nor any other sports or even musicians\nmaybe even because of or Architects\nEngineers that you've kind of like\nlooked to and been inspired by and and\npulled from have you studied people that\nyou find fascinating or that kind of\nbecome your guidance and mentors even if\nyou don't know them personally or or has\nit or is it very much a personal love\nand a personal inspiration thing I I\nreally try to be the best version of my\nmyself uh having said that there was one\ndriver that for me was the best of all\ntime was Elon Senna I've never had the\nchance because I'm too young to have\nwitnessed him in in real life but\nobviously through movies some books I\ncould learn more about his person and\nand what he's done in Formula 1 and he's\nalways been a person that I've admired\nand he was also the idol of my father so\nI think that played a part into it as\nwell what was it specifically about the\nway he raced that from what you've seen\nin footage and books what was it about\nhim just the Precision that he had uh at\nthat time it was also in the time where\nwe were mentioning before in a much more\ndangerous time of of Formula One sadly\nhe lost his life on the track but he was\nso precise and he was extremely special\nin Monaco he was special everywhere but\nin Monaco even more so and being in\nMonaco watching the videos of his\nonboard camera uh of his qualifying laps\naround Monaco was it's just crazy have\nany simulators ever done this where you\ncould race alongside legendary races\ndoes that exist like have you like if\nyou wanted to race him maybe maybe like\ngames yeah but not like proper for one\nsimulators no no our simulator is crazy\nit's in a room that is maybe this five\nor six times bigger than this one and\nit's like a huge simulator moving\neverywhere to try and reproduce the\ng-forces so now they are really pushed\nbut you're only racing on your own so\nyou cannot reproduce a a race or\nwhatsoever you're just doing laps on\nyour own that simulator where is that\nstation like where do you go in\nMarinello okay yeah and you that's that\nsimulator you're in all year round the\nthree days are in the real car yes so\nyou do three days in the real car and\nthen everything else is on the simulator\nwalk us through what that simulator\nfeels like like what you described it\nbriefly there but like walk us through\nlike how what does it give you and what\ndoes it not give you so what it gives\nyou extremely well is that the engineers\nhave managed to produce extremely close\nto the real car the feeling that you get\nin the real car the thing that it\ndoesn't give you and will I think never\never give you is obviously the\nadrenaline first because you know you're\non a simulator you crash you press the\nre restart button and you go again which\nin reality is a bit more difficult and\nalso the g-forces because we've got a\nhuge platform which reproduces the the\ng-forces but you're only going from\nright to left and then it stops in a\nFormula One car when you turn right then\nthen the gfor are always there until you\nstop turning right which um yeah makes a\nbig differen because to be precise on a\nplatform that is quite stable is one\nthing to be precise in a Formula One car\nwith all the vibrations with all the\ng-forces um that your body go through is\na complete other so um it makes things a\nbit more complicated it's fascinating to\neven think that you have to do something\nfor work that you don't actually get to\ndo and and it's it's phenomenal how\nsmart and astute and intense you have to\nbe in order to make it all come together\nI wanted to ask you I was thinking about\nthis before and I'm I'm bringing it back\nbecause I wanted to ask you if if your\nfather was here now and he was getting\nto watch you now like what do you think\nhe'd say to you like how do you think\nhe'd respond to the journey that you're\non I think he will be extremely proud\nbecause he passed away a year before I\ngot into Formula 1 it was very difficult\nbecause un Ely did not I I hadn't signed\nmy Formula One contract which was the\nultimate goal for our family I mean\nformula one is really where you want to\nget once you start a racing career\nthat's that's where you want to be one\nday but I had lied to him uh two days\nbefore he passed away and I told him\nlisten I I I signed my Formula One\ncontract the year was going well I was\nquite confident that this will happen\nbut I also knew it was a matter of days\nbefore he will pass away and I remember\nthat that night that I said it to my mom\nand my mom was pretty angry with me\ntelling me you shouldn't lie to your\nfather and that stayed in me for months\nand luckily I signed my contract a month\nlater he was he wasn't here anymore and\nthen I found much more peace within\nmyself because I told myself okay I\ndidn't lie in my father and I and I told\nhim the truth I anticipated things but\neverything is is is okay and that was a\nreally good moment because as I said\nFormula 1 is really the goal for every\ndriver and it was difficult to yeah\naccept that he will go away without\nknowing what was the rest but I think he\nwill be really proud as much as on track\nat the moment this year not going too\nmuch into the specific but it's not the\nbest year ever we are struggling a\nlittle bit with our car performance but\nyeah I'm still driving for Ferrari and\ninformal one so he will be happy yeah\nthat's beautiful yeah you shared that\nwith um Cristiano Ronaldo has a similar\nstory with his father like his father\nnever really got to see him become\ncrisano Ronaldo and the idea of like how\nhow hard it is when like you know you\nhave a father who believes in you and\nloves you and wants you to become\nphenomenal and I don't I I can't\nremember the exact year that he lost his\nfather but his father never got to see\nhim reach the heights that he did but of\ncourse it's beautiful to hear that I'm\nso glad you could share it with him\nthat's such a special I'm so glad you\ngot to tell him that and I'm so glad it\nbecame true me too I think I will have I\nwill have lived uh so badly with with a\nlie like this for the rest of my life so\nI'm I'm happy I did everything for it to\nhappen it happened and and he also\nsacrificed a lot for me I never like to\nsay that I sacrificed anything in my\nlife because I didn't I I just did\neverything that I wanted to do which was\nracing as much as yes I wasn't a lot of\ntime at home when I was a kid but I was\nspending my time on track which was what\nwhat I love doing the most he on the\nother hand sacrificed a lot because\nMotorsport is unfortunately a very\nexpensive sport um he had to do saving\nfor me to uh be able to do what I love\nmost which was driving and I was aware\nof that and also the fact that obviously\nmy mom he couldn't see my mom that much\nbecause he was always with me on Races\nso I think he made many more sacrifices\nthan than I did because for me it was\nalways Pure Pleasure is is driving a\nlonely sport I imagine that everyone's\nquite competitive like I you I can't\nimagine drivers being friends and\nhanging out afterwards because I don't\nknow I mean you tell me you tell me\nactually I've got a a really good friend\non the grid uh Pierre gastley we grew up\ntogether we started in couting we did\nour first race together in 2005 so we\nwere um yeah like seven eight years old\nwe did the French Championship together\nand we became super good friends our\nfamily are super close as well so we\nused to get going on holidays together\nand then we found ourselves in form one\nnow so but trust me as soon as I close\nthe VIS and I'm with a helmet he's\nnobody anymore and that's the same for\nhim and we know that but whenever we are\noutside the car we have a really really\nstrong friendship so uh you can have\nfriends but it's very difficult to\ncreate friendships if you didn't know\nthat person before getting into formula\none because it's such a competitive\nworld everybody wants to have the upper\nhand everybody wants to do everything in\nhis own benefit because at the end we\nwant to win we want to be the best on\ntrack so there's a lot of respect but we\nare not giving anything away to uh to\nthe others and as much as I'm with\nfriend with PR Pierre I'm not giving him\nany advices or\nwhatsoever I just want to beat him as\nmuch as I want to beat everybody else on\ntrack but um lonely sport I don't think\nit is because at the end it's a it's a\nteam sport the only thing is that the\nteam is a bit in the is working a bit in\nthe shadow because when you watch\nFormula 1 you see mostly the driver\ndriving the car but behind that the\nmechanics are making sure that they\nmount everything perfectly the engineers\nare working in trying to optimize the\ncar in the best possible way then\nthere's a lot of strategy during the\nrace so there are there are many many\nmany people in the background speaking\nand connected to me through the radio so\nI need to speak with the guys on um in\nthe pits while I'm driving uh and it's a\nbig part of of racing what are your\ndreams in visions of you know wanting to\nbe one of the best and winning a world\nchampionship what would that mean to you\nlike how important is that what does\nthat mean to you what would it feel like\nlike what what fuels you and drives you\nto go in that direction just to be the\nnumber one just the feeling of the\nvictory obviously I mean I won few races\nin Formula One and the feeling that you\nget once you get that win is incredible\nbecause you know you've done the best on\ntrack but it depends on so many other\npeople doing the right thing is that\nwhenever you do it it's such an\nincredible Joy not only for you but for\nmore than 1,500 people that are back at\nthe factory in maranelo working for the\nFormula 1 program so it's uh it's it's\ncrazy uh there are so many people\ninvolved and whenever you achieve that\nas a team it's such an incredible\nfeeling yeah Victory the the taste of\nVictory is what motivates me every\nmorning I wake up and I think about that\nevery day that is a bit more difficult\nto wake up and go in training I think\nabout winning a world championship one\nday and the feeling that it gives me and\nso yeah this is what motivates me yeah\nlet let's manifest it right now like you\ndid with with what you said to your\nfather like let's let's fast forward and\nit's manifested the World Championships\nhere what would you what would you say\nto that self from here what would you\nsay to your future self well done first\nthat is a pretty easy easy one um to\nremember the all your career and all\nyeah yeah your journey uh and to\nremember every single difficult moments\nwhere you thought you wouldn't make it\nthese difficult moments that I went\nthrough my\ncareer sometimes you tend to think I'm\nnot going to make it to Formula 1 I'm\nnot going to make it to become a world\nchampion so yeah if I become world\nchampion I will tell that to my to\nmyself to think about every single\nmoments where I thought this wouldn't be\npossible and this is also something that\nI tell myself today to the younger\nperson I was sometimes thinking I will\nnever make it to form one there are only\n20 drivers in the world why me and yeah\nto remember those moments and tell\nyourself that it's possible with hard\nwork with motivation it's possible to do\nanything Charles well you're definitely\nwinning at the race of life for sure I\ncan tell it's wonderful to engage with\nyou and connect with you and just we're\ndefinitely manifesting it right now want\nwant to see it happen and uh you know\ncan't wait for it because you deserve it\nI can tell that the grace with which you\ncarry yourself and the humility and the\nGratitude is really beautiful and I\nthink that those are the kind of winners\nwe need in the world as well I think I\nthink the world is starving for winners\nthat have great character and have great\nmorals and you know have their values in\nthe right place like I I look at that I\nalways think that if the most successful\nand the most talented and most impactful\npeople in the world are walking in that\ngraceful way then that's going to impact\nso many younger generations and and so\nmany others do you how often do you get\nto work with younger drivers and people\nare up and coming and like do you enjoy\nthat do you I love it I love it I had\nactually an incredible experience I went\nto a to a counting race I think it was a\nfew months ago like three four months\nago and it had been a long time I didn't\ngo into a counting race watching kids I\nhave my younger cousin actually that is\nstarting Counting wow that I went to I\nwent to see him and I got there and I\nmean I I didn't have any expectations I\narrived to the track and all the kids\nwere around me and looking with the eyes\nfull of of joy and admiration and that\nmade me uh come back a little bit when I\nwas a kid and and a formul one driver\nwill get to the track and you will see\nhim like God uh and uh and to see that\nin kids's eyes was something super super\nspecial because at the end I live my my\nown life but sometime I don't really\nrealize that I I am now a Formula 1\nFerrari driver which is something very\nspecial and something as I've always\ndreamed of as I've been saying many many\ntimes but I for me I'm still me for my\nmom I'm still her son so I'm I'm staying\nwith people that it's normal to be\naround me but then once I get to the\nkids and to the couting races that don't\nsee formul one drivers every day you can\nunderstand how special it is and the\nsmallest gesture and this I remember\nfrom being a kid the smallest gesture\nthat the formul one driver will have\ntowards me it will change my life for\nmonths I'll think about about that I met\nMichael chaca when I was seven or six\nyears old and I remember that day still\nas it was yesterday so yeah I I really\nspend time with the kids and and trying\nto make them the happiest possible and\nit was amazing to see the impact that it\nhard for for them and and how happy they\nleft from just meeting me for me it's\nnothing I spent what an hour with them\nbut for them I'm sure it meant a lot and\nthat was very special to to see that\nyeah that's beautiful do you believe\nthat the life you're living is that it's\nbeen created from your mind or a vision\nor training like how do you think about\nhow what has happened is it hard work is\nit effort is it attitude is it all of\nthose things is it something bigger than\nyou is there a higher power like what is\nit for you how do you describe the\njourney so far I think Clear Vision is\nwhat helps me uh since a very very young\nage because even though I started at\nthree and a half maybe from three and a\nhalf to 5 it was only for fun but\nalready from 5 every time I was getting\nto the track yes I love what I do but I\nwant to be the best this was super\nimportant for me to get away of the\ntrack the evening and to have learned\nsomething new and to have done a step in\nterms of driving and understanding of\nthe carting and all of these kind of\nthings and and this I've always kept it\nI was very clear in setting my goals\nrealistic goals and in where I want it\nto be not in 10 15 years time because\nthis was way too far but in one or two\nmonths time which were small steps but\nsmall steps always in the right\ndirection and I think that definitely\nhelped me in achieving small goals after\nsmall goals to get to the bigger goal\nwhich was obviously to become a Formula\nOne driver and even more so with Ferrari\nbut it's with the different small steps\nthat I've uh and the different targets\nthat I've uh fixed myself throughout my\nmy career absolutely Charles we uh end\nevery episode of on purpose with a final\nfive so these final five questions have\nto be answered in one word or one\nsentence maximum all right so tight so\nthese are your Fast Five drive fast and\nso now now you got to talk fast you\ndon't have to answer them fast they're\njust shorter answers uh question number\none Charles what is the best advice\nyou've ever heard or received I'll use\nthe one of my father stay humble be\ngrateful and work hard that is one\nsentence yeah that's perfect yeah yeah\nno that's perfect that's perfect all\nright second question what is the worst\nadvice you've ever heard or received on\nyour journey don't do this\nmistake I think you've got to do\nmistakes in order to learn from them and\nto become the person that you are then\n20 20 years after otherwise you yeah so\nso yeah I think every mistakes as I said\nearlier I think I always tend to think\nthat it's a positive thing because you\ngrow from them absolutely uh question\nnumber three how do you\nprepare on a big day for a race on the\nday and how do you end the day after the\nrace cold\nbaths I start it and I end it uh that\nway both sides yeah yeah it's a I I love\nit it's great for the body especially\nfor our sport inside the cockpit we are\ngoing through extremely high\ntemperatures so to put the body as low\nas possible uh before the race is super\nimportant and then I do the cold bath\nagain for recovery after that uh and\nthat also wakes me up if I'm a bit tired\nin the morning so uh yes cold bass nice\nyeah and I've seen you do cryotherapy as\nwell exactly I love it yeah I do a lot\nof uh infrared saers and coold plunges\nand\nyeah it's fantastic uh question number\nfour what is something you've learned\nabout yourself through your Formula 1\nJourney something you've learned about\nyourself personally that I'm much\nstronger than what I initially thought\nyou get into Formula 1 and I was still a\nkid so uh you get into a team with 1,500\npeople with media with a lot of pressure\nand straight away you you ask a bit\nyourself sometimes am I ready for this I\nused to do counting on my own with my my\nfather as a mechanic and now I'm in\nformul one with 1,500 people working in\norder to make the best car for me lots\nof media attention lots of pressure am I\nready for this I am so uh so yeah maybe\nthat I am stronger than what I initially\nthought I love that uh Fifth and final\nquestion we ask this to every guest uh\nif you could create one law or rule in\nthe world that everyone had to follow\nwhat would it be I mean it's a very\nsimple one but I think be nice and\nrespectful to everybody I think is\nextremely important and sometimes the\nworld lacks lacks that this is something\nthat I always remind myself in a way it\ncomes natural but I think it's super\nimportant to just be nice genuine with\npeople around you whoever this person is\nand um if everybody in the world will be\nuh like that I think the world will be a\nmuch better place absolutely Charles is\nthere anything I haven't asked you that\nyou wanted to share today that that's on\nyour heart that's in your mind that\nyou're like Jay I really wanted to talk\nabout this and maybe we haven't touched\non it I want to give you the the floor\nto share anything I think uh it's been a\nreally good talk so no I think you've\ntouched uh you've touched everything\nokay good yeah no I wanted to give you\nthe opportunity because I'm I'm so\ngrateful that we got to have this time\nand definitely the words I'm going to\nRemember You by is uh is grateful and\nhumble I I love those words I love that\nthat's how your family raised you I love\nthat theme coming out in our\nconversation today I felt I could feel\nyour genuine you still have a childlike\nlove for what you do oh this for sure\nand and I think that that is so rare uh\nit can you know we all get tired jaded\nstressed whatever and that's natural but\nit's amazing that you've held on to that\nand uh I think it's credit to your\nbeautiful parents and family that have\nthank so thank you man thank you so much\nthank you if you love this episode\nyou'll love my interview with Kobe\nBryant on how to be iic and obsessive to\nfind your purpose our children have\nbecome less imaginative about how to\nproblem solve and parents and coaches\nhave become more directive and trying to\ntell them how to behave versus teaching\nthem how to behave"
