turning my offline relationships\npeople I'm a fan of bringing them on to\nthe show and having the conversations\nwhere I'm speaking to a trusted expert\ntoday's guest is someone that I've\nfollowed

wants to work on your health\nif you're someone who wants to get more\nconnected with your body and if you're\nsomeone who wants to know how to cleanse\nand detox this episode is for you\nwelcome to the show Alyssa Goodman thank\nyou what an introduction that was so\nbeautiful oh well I have so much more I\ncould say but I stuck to the\nprofessional introduction but we\nobviously have a wonderful personal\nconnection too I know and I just I love\nwhat I do so it comes easy as you can\nimagine you know I just I absolutely am\nobsessed with helping people get better\nI can see that I mean anyone who follows\nyou on social media will see it\nimmediately like it's so radiant so\nvibrant so true to who you are and I\nthink our audience is really going to\nfind this fascinating because I don't\nthink we've ever had a cleanse expert on\nthe show before and I wanted to start\nthere like what is a cleanse expert I\nknow that's a great question because\ncleansing gets a bad connotation I mean\ndetox cleanse is all about deprivation\nstarvation and I would say that you know\nafter I went to school integrative\nholistic school I became a cleanse\nperson for Cafe Gratitude M Cafe aroan\nand I didn't know what it was but I\nactually created these cleanses for\nthese restaurants and handheld the\ncleansers throughout the 5 days or 3\ndays however long they were doing it and\nfound out their ailments what worked for\nthem what didn't work for them one was\nvegan and one was you know macrobiotic\nfrom M Cafe and it was a beautiful thing\nbecause I saw in five days people can\nrestore their body reset their body get\nbetter brain you know retention better\ndigestion just weight loss in 5 days\nlike crazy so feel better energy mood\nall of it so it was really fascinating\nI'm like hm there's something to this\ncleansing and so I decided that it was\nthose were a little bit more deprivation\nstarvation so I created a cleanse 9\nyears ago that wasn't about that it's\nall it's there's a lot of food on it\nit's very\nanti-inflammatory and it's giving you a\nlot of like 50 different vegetables in\nover five days so it's super nurturing\nnourishing and that's what I'm trying to\ndo for people is really introduce them\nto vegetables and plants and foods that\nare grown from the earth and taking away\nthe inflammation so that's what my\ncleanse is all about why why do people\nneed to go on a cleanse it's because\nmost people eat unhealthy you know they\neat way too much processed food they eat\nbad seed oils that are out there we're\neating out a lot you know we're stressed\nso we're not even thinking about what\nwe're eating we're eating on the Run\nthere's just like a lot there's just the\nfoods out there are have chemicals in\nthem and are toxic so I think that you\nknow everybody's like not feeling well\nthey're not energized brain fog is huge\ndigestive issues are on the rise\nautoimmune issues like we talked about\ncancer you know all of it diabetes um\nand so they need to be reset they need\nto have you know someone kind of help\nguide them and when you can deliver it\nto them so they don't have to cook it\nand don't have to meal prep it it's the\nultimate M how often do we need to go on\na cleanse and how long does it need to\nbe how does that impact it's that's also\ngreat question because you can do my\ncleans weekly so so because if you're\nit's mostly plant-based there is a bone\nbroth but if you're vegan you can do a\nvegan broth but people have had a client\non there for a year and a half and\ncouldn't get off of it loved it until\nshe moved to London so she just like\nit's just really healthy food so it's\nreally cleansing is it's not about you\nknow the detox and like like deprivation\nit's about just feeding the body and\nnourishing it and giving your microbiome\nwhat it needs the prebiotics the\nprobiotics you know giving the cells\nwhat it needs plant-based food is as you\nknow being what you know how you eat it\nlike it it really absorbs quickly into\nthe system animal protein takes a long\ntime to digest and I do eat some animal\nprotein but plant-based food goes\nthrough the system absorbs really\nquickly um and can give you energy\nreally fast it's fascinating to me isn't\nit because I think a lot of us are\nwalking around you said not feeling well\nnot feeling good and we start to think\nthat's normal and I remember feeling\nthat way where I just thought it was\nnormal to get a headache or I thought it\nwas normal to have have cough pain or I\nthought it was normal that my gut wasn't\nhealthy like I was just like oh that's\nnormal I'm getting older and I'm not\neven that old and it's like you just\nkeep thinking oh this is normal it's\nokay yeah and you almost don't realize\nhow good you can feel and over the last\ncouple of years I've changed a lot about\nmy diet about my sleep about my\nwell-being routine and I feel better\nthan I've ever felt even better than\nfive six years ago when I was younger\nand you're someone that I think inspires\nso many of us in seeing how uh and I\nknow you're working on a new book too\ncalled pro-aging hacks and the ability\nto stay healthy for longer talk to us\nabout the moments in your life as I was\ntalking about in the introduction you've\ngone through so much personal struggle\nand pain which has shifted you in this\ndirection so does that mean before that\nyou didn't eat healthy and that you\ndidn't care walk us through that Alissa\nGoodman that we don't know yeah it was\nyou know when I was born I was born with\nthis low white blood cell count so that\nwas I'm going to be 64 in two weeks so\ncongratulations that's amazing that was\n60 years ago and no one knew about how\nto build the immune system so like Fast\nForward I was sick all the time you know\nI had two parents that were really type\nA and as a teenager and a young\n20-year-old adult they were running\ncircles around me so not only not only\ndid I physically feel bad so I was\neating a lot of sugar caffeine you know\njust trying to keep my energy up but\nalso emotionally I was a little\ndistraught because I'm like how are\nthese older you know parents running\ncircles around me and I can't even keep\nup with them mentally it did a number on\nme and so I kind of just like you know\ntried to keep up with everyone and I was\nliving the fast track I was you know I\nthat's what I grew up with making money\nyou know being successful move from\nArizona to New York you know worked in\nthe advertising business was just\nworking around the clock no sleep and\nreally eating really poor um alcohol\nentertaining all of that and I just felt\ncrappy all the time and at one point\nwhen I met my husband and we got married\nI said to him we're moving West and\nbasically he was like New Jersey like no\nI go no we're going to California I need\nsunshine I need a slower way of life cuz\nI grew up in Arizona and thank God for\nthat cuz when I landed in California and\nI got this fantastic job with Vogue\nmagazine I was diagnosed with hodkin\nlymphoma so I got all the accumulation\nof all my stress and not feeling well\nand eating really poorly was the cancer\nand how old were you I was 32 wow I know\nso I was I was getting a massage I like\nyou were saying I felt crappy all the\ntime so I didn't know what you know\nfeeling good felt like and I'm sitting\nthere getting a massage with like\nsitting upright the masseuse felt a\nlymph node on my collar bone and she's\nlike that's not okay you're not supposed\nto have a swollen lymph node there and\nso basically next thing I knew it was\ncancer and I got really lucky the\nmasseuse was fantastic to find it early\nand then I found this doctor who I went\nto a radiologist who said sat me down\nand was staged by that time and he said\nyou know are you happy do you love what\nyou do for a living do you love your\nlife do you love yourself you know\nwhat's your stress like what's your\nsleep like that was 30 years ago doctors\nstill don't say that today which blows\nmy mind cuz cancer is on the rise and\nall of these things so like he he made\nme feel at peace like he goes we got to\nget your emotional well-being back in\ncontrol and like get you to a better\nplace which I did I dove into all of\nthat and then I dove I became a vegan\nand I was really lucky I was in\nCalifornia and there was Mrs gc's before\nwhole food so the food you know there\nwas a grocery store that was beautiful\nand organic organic Meats everything was\nlike healthy farmed to table and then I\nwent and Juiced all the time I Juiced\nevery single day and did all the\nmodalities here yoga you know self-help\num went to see a therapist and I got my\n[ __ ] together thank god um and then I\nwent on to have you know two really\nhealthy girls and but after I did do\nsome radiation I chose not to do the\nchemo because of my immune system and I\nknew my instincts told me that that was\ngoing to take me down so I did half of\nthe\nradiation my oncologist fired me because\nhe said you're not doing what I'm\nsupposed to what what I'm trying to tell\nyou to do and so I found someone to do\nhalf the radiation and the radiation\ngave me hyptis gave me Hashimoto Celiac\nall these other illnesses anxiety things\nthat I hadn't had before um insomnia uh\nso I basically like the radiation was\nawful but but I Bas went on to have the\ngirls and then 11 and 1 half years later\nI my husband was diagnosed with cancer\nso it's a crazy time I mean I got really\nhealthy for that period after the cancer\nand for a while and then I kind of went\nback into the unhealthy World a bit more\nI didn't stay on that track and so when\nhe got cancer you know I realized oh my\nGod two parents who have cancer and\nwatching him pass away in a year and a\nhalf that's when I like really took it\nseriously after he passed away at 45 I'm\nlike this has to be serious and that's\nlike basically when I realized you know\nI have to really get healthy because I\ndidn't have any energy I was like my\nstamina was low because life with him\nwas really crazy for a year and a half\nin and out of the hospital so and I\nwatched him go from a healthy man to a\nvery unhealthy you know and pass away a\nfungal pneumonia so it the cancer didn't\nget him it was his immune system\nand I followed the protocols of like\nhealthier eating and all those\nmodalities when I was sick but he didn't\ndo that as much he really was scared and\nthat he just did what other what the\ndoctor said so it was like a very\ndifferent story um so thank God like\nthen that's when I took it a step\nfurther and I really started getting\nhealthy and so ever since now you know\nyears later almost 18 years later um I\nfeel better than I did when I was in my\n20s wow all the modalities yeah thank\nyou thank you for sharing that because I\nI can't even begin to imagine what a\nchallenging Journey that is personally\nand then in a relationship as\nwell what what have you found and what\nhave you discovered as you've been\nstudying because I think you know a lot\nof people will say well no I need to get\nthe radiation I need to do what my\ndoctors are saying you obviously had a\ndifferent confidence and an intuition\naround how you wanted to heal yourself\nand I think ultimately it comes down to\nhow people want heal themselves what\nhave you found works at different\nstages what have you seen across other\npatients uh who are struggling with\ncancer like what what have you seen what\nhave you witnessed and observed it's\nbeen fascinating Jay because I have seen\nstage four heal can cancer heal without\nusing Western modalities and it really\nis a mindset as you tuned into you know\nit's de-stressing it's like releasing\ntrauma it's really getting in into your\nsubconscious and rewiring it is\nbelieving in yourself and having the\nconfidence that you can heal from\nanything I do believe you can heal from\nanything almost so I feel like you we\ngot to believe it and most people don't\nbelieve they can and most people don't\nbelieve that they love themselves they\ndon't admire who they are they don't\nlove themselves their self-esteem is low\nso I would say that is the biggest thing\nwhen I ask clients all the time you you\nknow when they have cancer do you love\nthe yourself and they're like o no one's\nasked me that question and I'm like you\nknow that's something we really got to\nwork on you know do you have peace in\nyour life those are the things that\ntotally changed my life all of those\nthings finding love finding peace you\nknow you not labeling myself a sick kid\nbecause I had labeled myself and all the\npeople around me as a you know young\nadult I was a sick kid because I was\nalways getting sick so we label\nourselves you know when we have trauma\nin those early years or we're just not\nin a good place you know growing up we\ndo label ourselves and those are the\nthings we've got to rewire I have found\nthat to be number one you know one of my\nfavorite books radical remission radical\nhope um by Kelly Turner you know the\nheel documentary all those things are\nbeautiful in terms of like talking about\nthat and also just then I would say it\ncomes to the food food is medicine as we\nknow so people you know eating\nnourishing you know vegetables plants\nyou know foods that are grown from the\nearth that's where you know from the\nsunshine like energy wise that's a\nbeautiful thing um I've always been a\nbig juicer for 30 years and I've been\njuicing ever since I've taken some\nbreaks but I almost can't live without\nit and so juicing greens has been like I\nthink a lifesaver for me you know cuz I\nfeel like that's my\nmultivitamin so let's break this down\nfor people now so that they can practice\nit so you've been a juicer for so long\nwalk us through how to juice what to\njuice why to juice and what the benefits\nare I know forner I know cuz there's a\nlot of like controversy about juicing\nit's like all the nutrients are taken\nout of it you know corre I'm hearing\nthat a lot yeah and the fiber and all of\nthat but you know I was a purist so I\nwould juice and drink it right away so I\nfeel like you know I was able and I\nwould do a cold pressed juice I wouldn't\ndo heat so that's also it the nutrients\nstay intact with the cold press so I\nlove that nowadays I'm just throwing\nthem in a blender cuz I do love the\nfiber um so that you know doesn't take\nout that also the nutrients as fast and\nI love having all that fiber so I think\npeople just don't eat enough vegetables\nI'm trying to get clients to eat 10 to\ncup 10 to8 to 10 cups of vegetables a\nday and that is they their eyes glaze\nover like how the hell do I do that and\nyouen you can get four to five easily\nthrowing them in and I do cucumber\ncelery lemon ginger spinach super easy\nthings and sometimes not so expensive\nyou know people think it's like very\narduous and got to have all those\nvegetables and you know it could be easy\ncelery is huge in terms of the minerals\ncucumbers super hydrating cleansing for\nthe kidneys celery cleanses your gut\ncleanses your liver I mean you know\nspinach is full of iron so ginger is you\nknow antibacterial lemon I mean they're\njust beautiful things and I think it\njust wakes me up every day and like\ngives and also helps skin and digestion\nand all of that so I think it's a\nbeautiful way to start the day and\nyou're having that first in the morning\nthat's that's what you have on an empty\nstomach right and you've just done that\nfor years and found years yeah I found\nthat too I remember when celery juice\nbecame you know it had its wave which\nwas a few years ago now I feel and I\nremember trying it out and I've still\nnot found something better than celery\njuice so you just do Straight celery\njuice still generally well I'll probably\ndo like celery with a bit of Apple in it\njust to give it a bit of sweetness just\nto make it like easy to do yes exactly\nfor me to enjoy it usually I would just\nstick to celery in the beginning but\nthen I was like okay I need to enjoy\nthis a little bit and so a little bit of\nApple in it would be perfect but just\nenough just enough not too much and and\nto me that's been one of my favorite\nthings that has helped my gut heal so\nmuch and and I find it to be such a\npowerful practice so it resonates well\nwho brought the celery juice craze on\nwas the medical medium right we've had\nhim on the show yes yes and years ago I\nwas working with with him as well and he\nwas the one who really did help me get\npast my autoimmune issues so I started\nthe celery juice like four or five years\nago when it all just started and you\nknow I was wondering like why is this\ncelery juice so powerful and I started\nclients on it as well and I realized\nthere was a like a like a little bit of\na trick to it in terms of it's super\nhydrating and I find that hydration is\nlike really an epidemic right now\ndehydration is crazy and celery has is\nfull of minerals you know and also like\nis great with prebiotics and things like\nthat but the mineral content in celery\nis huge so people are drinking the\ncelery juice wondering like how am I\nfeeling so good but it's hydrating them\nso people just don't get up in the\nmorning and I always say it kind of\nblows my mind I say people like have to\nhave a mandatory of two cups of water\njust 16 ounces of water before their\ncoffee or their tea or anything Cafe\ncaffeinated and they're like well that\nthat's easy but I don't do it and then\nthey call me back and go well that was\nlife-changing just two cups of water I'm\nlike you paid me to tell you to drink\ntwo cups of water that's crazy but the\ncelery juice is the same thing it's\nsuper hydrating when you're dehydrated\nnothing works right you know your\nadrenals aren't working your cortisol\nand your adrenaline are rising you know\nyou're not going to the bathroom\nregularly your brain can't work you\nthink you're hungry like it really is\nlike an epidemic and we have all this\nbeautiful water at our fingertips but we\njust don't have minerals you know what I\nhave not actually thought about that I\ndon't think we've ever heard anyone say\nthat so clearly because it again like\nyou said it sounds so obvious right but\nmost of us are not drinking close to\nenough water no and like you're saying\nthe V the minerals that actually come\nfrom the earth grown vegetables that\nnaturally are filled with it and packed\nwith it yeah the plants and like gos\ncomplex carbs too people are kind of\nanti- carbs when they want to lose\nweight but they're full of minerals\nso and they also calm the central\nnervous system down what what are some\nexamples of those those are legumes and\nbeans you know and also like I'd say\nsome really good Rices quinoa sweet\npotatoes squash all of those things you\nknow wild rice black rice I mean those\nare beautiful complex carbs also great\nfor the gut as well so yeah yeah yeah\nwhat have you seen about because what\nwe're really talking about here like you\nsaid the client that calls you up after\ndoing it and says I can't believe it\nworks and I I can't believe I paid you\nfor that Etc that that\nidea it seems like and even for you like\nyou know you went through this terrible\nexperience yourself you know the\nradiation caused more challenges you\nknow you go through the the tragic loss\nof a partner like who's you know also\nsuffering from this and and you say\nthat's what wake woke you up and I think\na lot of\nus it's it's hard to think that a lot of\nus and I guess that's why you do what\nyou do is you don't want people wait for\npersonal loss in order to get serious\nabout their health and well-being but it\nI find that as humans we're\nso bad at changing our habits and we're\nso quick to forget even pain and I\nremember this like not in an not in an\nclose to the extremes that you have had\nbut I've had different reminders in my\nhealth where my body's slowed down or\nFallen apart or I've needed a surgery or\nwhatever it may be and it's so quick\nlike you know a couple of months later\nyou're eating all the stuff again and\nyou're just happy that you're back to\nbeing normal and you just let yourself\ngo again and then again you get another\nwakeup call and for me I think what was\nreally got me serious was last year I\nsat down with my doctor who I've had on\nthe show Daran sha and when we looked at\nall my Bloods and everything he said to\nme Jay this is not your fault because\nyour diet seems to be good but because\nof your genetic makeup you're\npredisposed diabetes and cholesterol and\nso even though you don't eat fried food\nand oily food and you don't eat uh that\nmuch sugar comparatively you're just\nmore predisposed to it and when I heard\nthat I was like all right got it like I\nneed to now be serious about my health\nand I feel like that was towards the end\nof last year where I just really got\ndialed in but it's almost like a lot of\nus wait for pain in order to get\nproactive and I guess the reason you do\nwhat you do is to not let people wait\nfor pain because that's just so painful\nand challenging yeah what have you\nlearned about habit change when you're\nworking with your clients what is it\nthat really helps people change what are\nsome of the hacks what are some of the\nhabits that have transformed people's\nlives I that's so good I know because I\nthink since covid people are now\nstarting to take their health more\nserious AG thank God for that and also\nyou're right like the diabetes is on the\nrise like blood sugar issues are crazy\nout of control so like when I work with\nmy clients I would say like you what you\nwere saying earlier you know with NEX\nhealth and all of that is like I'm now\ndoing blood work with my every client I\ndo blood work on I'm doing really\nthorough blood work I'm even doing heavy\nmetals all the metabolic you know\nthyroid all the hormones even if they're\nyoung and I'm seeing such fascinating\nthings everybody's blood sugar is too\nhigh it's not PRI pre-diabetic yet but\nit's very close their thyroids out of\nwhack their insulin levels are too high\ntheir cortisol is too high you know it's\nwild they got heavy metals so um they're\nheading towards health issues and I feel\nlike that has been the coolest thing\nlately for me to be in the last year\ndoing that because I'm catching these\nthings before they get unhealthy I know\nthey don't feel good and they're\nlethargic and they're not sleeping well\nand they have hormone issues but there's\nsomething behind it if they are eating\nhealthy you know like there is something\nphysical like you found um and that has\nbeen gamechanging like to be able to you\nknow get their blood sugar under control\nto get their thyroid working again to\nalso get their hormones working better\nbefore they even go into menopause has\nbeen huge so I feel like those you know\nthose things have been life-changing the\nblood work stuff and doing it once a\nyear amazing um and and great for the\nclients like it's not expensive to do\nwith me um also then it's about you know\nreally one thing at a time so like we\ntalked about like maybe getting them\nhydrated the first week secondly you\nknow maybe getting them eating more\nplant-based Foods\num of course the sleep is crucial like\npeople aren't sleeping enough um and\nalso getting them sleeping better and\nhelping them sleep better you know\nthere's a lot of modalities you know in\nterms of getting healthy but I don't\nwant to overwhelm them so I try\ndesperately not to overwhelm them you\nknow with giving them too much off the\nbat I mean I am a supplement junkie I've\nbeen like dabbling with supplements\nsince I had cancer um now it's a billion\ndollar business and there's too many out\nthere and there's a lot of crappy\nsupplements out there so I do feel\nreally lucky that I've dabbled in it a\nlong time so I know what's good and what\nisn't and I had to also deal with it\nmyself so I take a lot of supplements\nand I figure out what works for me and\nwhat doesn't and I muscle test them on\nmyself and all of that um and I try to\nteach my clients to muscle test the\nsupplements on them what's a muscle test\nokay so this is fascinating you have\nnever heard of this I don't know I'm not\nsure maybe it's called something else I\nfeel like I thought at next they do that\nmaybe not but you actually stick a\nsupplement like on your gut or you can\nhold it um and actually it's kind of\nlike Eastern medicine you know either\nyou hold your hand out and somebody\npushes your hand down if you're with\nsomebody okay that's muscle testing how\nyou do it on yourself is you put it on\nyour gut and you stand like kind of like\ntry to balance yourself and stand\nupright and then you say hey is this B\ncomplex right for me and then your body\nmoves forward if yes and back if no and\nthen you say should I take one should I\ntake two and your body tells you\neverything it's so in tune you know we\nwere born with these incredible\ninstincts and we lose touch with them\nright like we lose touch all like along\nthe way with all the things that have\ngone on in our life and it's the same\nthing with food with supplements with\nwhat we need to do to heal ourselves and\nwhere we want to be in our lives is all\ninstinctual so the instincts are huge so\nI try to teach them that as well\nit's so interesting isn't it because I\nfeel like we've become so distrusting of\nour bodies yeah because we've been told\nto trust someone or something else and\nof course we do need guides we need\nexperts we need doctors you know and I'm\nnot discouraging anyone from any of\nthose things I'm just saying that I\nthink claiming back some of that in the\nsame way as when you eat something you\nknow whether your body is accepting or\nrejecting it based on how it's feeling\nand of course if your digestion is\nstrong then it gives you the best sense\nsometimes of your digestion is weak it\nmay not give you the best marker but\nwhen you're talking about vitamins and\nsupplements walk us through in a\npractical sense how does someone make a\nchoice what do they need to read on the\nback of a a box or a bottle with\nvitamins and supplements like what\nshould they be looking for and what\nshould they be looking at to make sense\nof it from a technical standpoint not\njust the intuition standpoint yeah\nthat's a great question um because you\nwant to have as least fillers and attit\nin that supplement is possible and\nwhat's a filler and an so filler is like\nsomething that just fills up the\nsupplement you know it's like a you know\ncrystalline cellulose is a is a filler\num not all the supplement is going to be\nthe B complex but they need other things\nyou know to bind the bees you know for\nthe for you to be able to digest them so\na lot of times you know or like it's\nexpensive to have the supplement be all\nyou know liposomal C or B or whatever or\nvitamin D so a lot of times they add the\nthe additives so that it isn't as costly\nso it really is a struggle because a lot\nof people don't do well with these\nadditives and they don't know that so\nmicrocrystalline cellulose is one that's\nin a lot of supplements and it gives you\ndigestive issues if you're taking too\nmany so you could see a lot of people's\nsupplements and they can all have Micro\nmicrocrystalline cellulose I mean it's\nwild so it or soy lesian you know or\njust these attit just like Foods you\nknow it kind of maintains the shelf life\nof the supplement as well so it's hard\nto find supplements without that cuz\nthey're costly and a lot of people can't\nafford that right so that's why you know\nI try to go more like with the food and\nthat you know lead with the food and\nthen supplements come second right but\nthere are some supplements out there\nthat we absolutely do need you know\nvitamin D is one of them I mean since Co\nthe studies that have been done on\nvitamin D and especially liposomal\nbecause liposomal is a phospholipid\noutside of a you know supplement and\nbasically is better to absorb easier to\nabsorb like liposomal C and liposomal\nglutathion and all those things and so\nbasically you know D when you raise your\nD levels you can lower your cholesterol\nactually you raise your D levels it's\nbetter for immune system it's better for\ncognitive function people don't realize\nthat there's a vitamin D cell receptor\nin every cell in your body so you know\nthere's that it's Omega-3\nit's you know it's\nmagnesium like there's certain things\nout there be be complex for stress yeah\nI don't one thing I definitely didn't\nrealize until I really got on a good\nregime of supplements and vitamins was\njust how much harder I was working to\nfeel good right like it was I I just\nthought it was a mental battle and so I\nwas fighting the mental battle every day\nwith meditation and mindfulness and\neverything else and then I realized I\nwas like actually I would have been a\nmuch better meditator if I just took\nsupplements and vitamins early on\nbecause then your body's actually\nhelping you with that focus and with the\nphysical activity or movement and\nexercise right whether it's hiking or\nsport or whatever it may be and it's so\nfunny now that you're naming all these\nthings I'm like I've seen all these\nthings on the backs and never known what\nthat means and it's so easy to just feel\nso uneducated and I've definitely felt\nthat way in this space you know without\nhaving good people around you it's so\nhard to really know whether what you're\ndoing is good for you or not walk us\nthrough like if we took a random stack\nof snacks right now and I don't want to\npick on any brands or anything like that\nin any way but if you were to teach\nsomeone how to read the back of a snack\npack what should they be looking out for\nbecause this is something that I believe\nhas changed the way I snack and I\ngenerally I'd say my diet\nis like maybe I don't know at this point\nlike 5% Pro or packaged Foods in any if\nif that probably when I'm traveling I'll\nhave like a protein bar that I travel\nwith or something like that but\ngenerally it's it's not I'm I'm on the\nWhole Foods diet and everything else but\nit wasn't that way before I used to\nthink that if I ate healthy snacks then\nthat was okay so I would eat packaged\ngoods and then 50% of my diet was\npackaged Goods or or maybe 30% walk us\nthrough what we should be looking out\nfor because I think so much is hidden on\nthese well it's the same thing as the\nsupplements know there's a laundry list\nof things on the back of the snack you\nknow box or bag or whatever that you\ndon't even recognize right like it's\njust I mean there are like you know\ncertain dyes that are bad for us and\nlike again going back to the soy leian\nlike soy Le is really bad for us see\nthat everywhere it's so funny I've\npronounced that wrong for my whole life\nnow that you've told me I mean I love\nsoy whole soy products but you know when\nit's processed down to that it's bad\nit's like the bad seed oil oils that's\nOmega sixes and nines and like really\ncausing inflammation so again if it's a\nlaundry list of things that you don't\nrecognize like that kind of is a no-go I\nmean you know we let's talk about some\nof the things we know like plant milks\nyou know they're they've been huge for\nyears right um now there's thank God\nthere's better healthier plant milks out\nthere they're just almonds and sea salt\num and water like those are the things\nto look for something that's just simple\nthe cheeses you know I I do love some of\nthe plant-based foods and cheeses and\nsome of the fake Meats but again they\ncould have a lot of bad stuff in them so\nit's like you know I sometime you just\ngot to go for the less is more even the\nprotein bars too you know every so often\nit's not bad to have some of these\nthings that do have these you know all\nthese things and them because you're\nkind not going to be perfect but I would\nsay 75% of the time 80% of the time to\ntry to look for you know those things on\nthe back and just try to do things with\nless additives because your system\ndoesn't know how to process it doesn't\nknow how to digest it and the more you\nadd these additives into your body I\nthink more toxic you\nbecome and also the digestive system\nlike the digestive issues are crazy out\nof control like I created a digestive\ncleanse because it's been like everybody\nhas digestive issues everybody calls me\nlike my D every time I eat I get bloated\nI you know I can't eat anything now or I\ncan't go to the bathroom like the\nconstipation for days on end like it's\nreally crazy or the other side of it\nwhere they're going in the bathroom too\nmuch um that's an epidemic like the\nhydration yeah so you're saying when\nyou're looking at if you're outside\nyou're looking for snacks and products\nit's like less ingredients simple\ningredients and real ingredients\nbasically things that you actually know\nwhat they are if you don't know what\nthey are right that's probably assigned\nthat and the problem is it doesn't taste\nas good though no it doesn't like I had\na protein bar the other day cuz I was at\nExpo and I had a protein bar and I was\nlike oh great like this literally had\nthree ingredients on it I was so excited\nto eat it and I tried it and it was so\nbad compared to the one that I've been\nprogrammed to love which has all the\nother 30 things that you'd say I\nshouldn't eat and are not good for me\nand it's so frustrating because I'm like\nI wish I was trained to believe that\nwhole natural food Foods were tasty and\nhealthy whereas because I've been so\nspoiled by my taste buds have been\nruined by all of this other stuff that\nnow feels captivating and exciting and\ntasty yeah most of America has you know\nright I mean the sugar in these things\nlike you know there's a lot of Sugar In\nThese Bars and in these milks and\ncheeses or whatever it is because things\ndon't taste so great when they are on\nthat simple side you know there's a lot\nof salt there's a lot of sodium so to\nmake them taste better walk us through\nso walk us through the core needs that\npeople come to you with so that you said\nthey do there's a gut cleanse walk us\nthrough the different cleanses that\npeople need in their life um so the\nregular cleanse is really I'll tell you\na little bit about what's on it um\nthere's a detox tonic on it with coconut\ncafir which is a probiotic drink I love\ncoconut good a big fan of probiotics and\nI love coconut cfir cocoyo and there's a\nlot of great products out there on the\nmarket then it has chlorophyll apple\ncider vinegar lemon ginger and there and\nthen there's my homemade super seed bar\num then you basically get a bone broth\nor vegan broth um our bone broth is\nreally gelatinous and so there's a lot\nof collagen which I love and then we get\nyou get different salads for the week\ndifferent salad dressings fermented\nvegetables you get different soups for\nthe for the nighttime and then you get\nlattes for the evening then you also get\ndigestive enzymes and you get magnesium\nso to make sure that everything's\nworking properly cuz people going from\nan animal protein diet into a\nplant-based legumes and beans can\ndisrupt their stomach and also a lot of\nvegetables can as well so there's that\none there's a three-day so with that one\nhow walk us through so are you\nencouraging people to not have dinners\nin that is that like soup is dinner or\nthey could have soup for lunch and do\nthe salad for dinner so it's not super\nstrict um a lot of people who exercise a\nton will add a little bit of an animal\nprotein you know to the meal potentially\nand it doesn't take you away from the\ncleanse so again you're just getting\ntons of vegetables you're getting\nanti-inflammatory you know nourishing\nnurturing Foods so um that you know that\none is like my regular one that has been\ngoing on for nine years sometimes it\nblows my mind because the tonic's been\non there for nine years the bar's been\non there like it's crazy that things are\nstill popular um people buy the tonics\nand the bars separately and then the gut\ncleanse has um activated charcoal on\nthere so w c through that what activated\ncharcoal so I love activated charcoal\nbecause it lowers bacteria loads in your\ngut wait how do you eat activated\ncharcoal you take a pill right you can\nyou can put it in a drink and you know\nyou can to put it in the detox tonic um\nor in water or whatever but you take\nit's a pill it's a very strong pill um\nand I have found when I had insulin\nresistant clients who couldn't lose\nweight you know weight resistant clients\ntheir insulin was high their gut\nbacteria was too high so I would put\nthem on 5 days of activated charcoal and\nlower their insulin levels which was\nlike fantastic so that's how the gut\ncleanse came about so they get activated\ncharcoal they still get the enzymes they\nget the Magnesium um but they get chia\npudding they get sauerkraut they still\nget the um detox tonic they don't get\nthe bar cuz a little too much sugar um I\ndon't want sugar for them because of the\nbacteria and then they get everything\nelse that's pretty similar and the\nnighttime is a tulsy tea um you know\nthat holy basil is one of my favorites\nit's anti-inflammatory and great for the\ngut great for Sleep um so that's my\nthat's the other cleanse that I love and\nso what I'm trying to do for people is\nreally clean them out um my those\nclients are the ones that have a little\nbit of constipation issues like aren't\ngoing to the bathroom regularly um and\nthey're by the end of the week they're\ngoing two and three times a day wow like\nit that's another crazy thing cuz people\ngo yeah once a day they that's consider\nconstipated these days it's crazy so\nwalk us through that because that's\nalways like an uncomfortable topic for\npeople it's something that people don't\ntalk about but I mean I don't think\nwe've even we're getting to the point of\nunderstanding how important the the\ndigestive system is yeah and how often\nshould be people going to the restroom\nwhat what what should be the healthy way\nof um going about that area of their\nlife well you know once a day is good\ntwice is great three is perfect so we\nreally because we don't get enough fiber\nbecause we don't get enough hydration\nbecause we're stressed because when\nwe're stressed our digestive system\ncompletely shuts down um we are not\nbeing able to digest our food so Al and\nalso we're eating a lot of animal\nprotein so it takes you know 14 hours to\nget through the small intestine cow and\nand animal protein and 90 minutes for\nplant-based food which is crazy so we're\nsay that difference again so for\nplant-based food it takes 90 minutes to\nget through the small intestine for cow\nand animal protein it takes 14\nhours so we're you know we're eating\neggs for breakfast and chicken for lunch\nand salmon for dinner like so we're just\nlike not that it's bad for you but we're\njust we're not getting hydration we're\nnot getting fiber you know we're\nstressed all the other we're not doing\nthe other things we're not sleeping\nsleeping is very detoxifying and helping\nus with our digestive system so um yeah\nso we're we're supposed to be kind of\nlike an animal and going after every\nmeal and people are a little bit like oh\nplease don't tell me that yeah wow wow I\nknow it's it's interesting how\ninterconnected it all is though like you\ntalked about hydration earlier we're\ntalking about the gut now like it's it's\nfascinating because it's almost\nlike even for me I was talking to a\nfriend about it this morning and we were\njust talking about how like we're like\nokay we want to get proteins but then if\nI'm eating this cuz as a plant-based\nperson to get proteins harder it's also\nthat way around right so you're trying\nto get enough protein in your Di\nbut then it's like well maybe that\nparticular item doesn't sit well with my\ngut and doesn't make me feel good and so\nyou're also finding that as well right\nlike it's it's not as simple as like\nwell this is really great for everyone\nright it's so individual it's not a one\nsiiz fits all right and I do believe in\nyou know if you're vegan I can help\nsomeone get enough protein or vegetarian\nor you know animal protein for me I grew\nup eating animal protein so I you know I\nfeel like I need that and I feel like as\nI've aged I feel like I need more amino\nacids um but sometimes it certain animal\nproteins don't agree with me so I do\ntake digestive enzymes before I eat\nanimal protein so I can digest it so I\nmean what form do you take your\ndigestive I love this enzymatica digest\ngold at Pro is one of my favorites it's\non the cleanse um but you can also get\nit from apple cider vinegar you could\nalso get it from bitter greens like\ndanine greens arugula um Andi Rico so\nsometimes I'll just take a handful of\narugula before I eat a meal it's really\ncrazy and it'll wake up your enzymes\nreally yeah that's incredible I didn't\nknow that or after a meal if you kind of\nhave a digestive issue you could take\nsome arugula and eat it I know it sounds\nvery strange but or have some apple\ncider vinegar or take an enzyme after\nthe meal it doesn't have to be before\nthe meal so there are a lot of tricks\nthat people sometimes don't know because\ndigestion can be an issue um and I also\ndon't overdo the animal protein like I'm\nnot having like 8 to 10 to 12 ounces of\nsomething you know I'm having like 3 to\n4 ounces so that's like you know 30 40\ngram of protein so I feel like um\nnowadays protein is the Hot Topic like\nyou know some people feel like you need\nto get a gram per body weight but I'm\nreally someone who feels like you know\n70 75 grams for women is great so that's\nkind of easy to do of course it impacts\nbased on your workouts exactly and\neverything else that are going on yeah\nand hoping that you do Digest\nyou know what you're eating that's\nimportant i' I've found that adding in\nthe beginning adding protein to my diet\nfelt heavy on my digestion but actually\nit's now led to better digestion but it\ntook it took this like transition point\nwhere I was like God that's really heavy\nlike it's harder to digest in the\nbeginning yeah even though it should be\nhelping me but then I feel like it's\nit's just staying committed to it my\ndigestions got used to it is that\nnatural do you find that or that's the\nsame with legumes and beans cuz people\nwill go on the cleanse and be like I\ncan't eat legumes and beans they're not\nused to that cuz they're animal protein\neaters and most of us have been animal\nprotein eaters I feel like most people I\ntalk to they just don't they feel like B\nbeans and legumes are gassy and are hard\nto digest but the more you eat them the\neasier they are in the system right yeah\nyour digestive system gets you know used\nto it right it is kind of wild what what\nare some of the biggest mistakes you see\npeople making when it comes to their\nhealth and wellbeing that you've kind of\nnoticed as Trends over the years that\nthese seem to just be the things that\ntrip people up that's such a great\nquestion because there's so many um but\nI would say you know a lot of people are\novers supplementing oh interesting yeah\nthey are like on social media Tik Tok or\nInstagram and they're seeing all these\ninfluencers who are great at what they\ndo but they're promoting all these\ndifferent products and they have no idea\nif that product is right for them so\nthey're buying it so I'll I'll like see\ncupboards and like suitcases of people\nwho have all these supplements and\nthey're taking them and they don't feel\ngood they're not really making them feel\nbetter um so but the but the person\nwho's promoting and said this is going\nto this is going to change your life\nright so that's huge also like what's\nalso hard is um basically like following\nthe protot like gluten-free you know or\num not everybody needs to be gluten-free\nor like dairyfree or all of those things\nso you know or they're not gluten-free\nthe other side of it you know they're\njust not like eating like they're not\ntaking gluten out of the diet because\nit's inflammatory or dairy um or sugar\nsugar is a huge one so um people really\nfeel that um sugar you know they can\nhave a little sugar some people can't so\nI think foodwise it's like there's so\nmany\nmisconceptions of what they should or\nshouldn't be doing and they should be\ngluten-free or not or dairy free or\nmaybe like you know should they be could\nthey have some sugar or not just it\ndepends on like what their blood sugar\nis what their gut is happening I'm\nseeing a lot of that the supplements I\nalso see that um people are over\nexercising wow too like they're like\ndoing Barry's boot camp and spin classes\nand their cortisol and adrenaline is so\nhigh and they're so stressed and their\nadrenals are fatigued and it's just\nmaking them more tired that's why you\nhave to be observing the 360 and that's\nwhat's so hard about it because you\ncould look great right and then still\nfeel terrible and be super stressed out\nbecause you it's kind of like I mean we\nwere having this conversation offline\nwhich you know last night I played\npickleball for two hours it was super\nphysical I think everyone's uh you know\neveryone's fitness trackers said that we\nburnt like 1,100 calories last night\nplaying for 2 hours but I came back and\nmy body temperature was really high and\nso when I got into bed and as I was\ntelling you my AC unit wasn't working so\nI couldn't lower the temperature in the\nbedroom and my house gets quite hot so I\nhad a high body temperature and the\ntemperature of the room was probably\nlike 78 which is super high and so then\nnow it was so hard for me to sleep and I\nremember while I was struggling to sleep\nI just started researching body\ntemperature and why it was hard to sleep\nand all the rest of it and and that's\nall it was saying and I was thinking\nthis is so interesting because I could\nbe thinking oh it's because I'm stressed\nabout something or I've got loads on and\nit's like well no it's just body\ntemperature and the temperature of my\nroom right and and it's it's challenging\nbecause I think that you know food is\nsuch a source of Joy it's such a source\nof excitement for so many people and yet\nnow when you start really getting into\nit it can become such a source of stress\nand such a source of pressure like oh my\nGod I'm eating too much this I'm eating\ntoo little this like oh no I didn't meal\nprep this week and oh no now like I\ndidn't get it oh I forgot to take my\nvitamin it's like I think we're so\nstressed about being healthy how have\nyou made sense of that because I can\nfind when I'm you know when I'm having\nthis conversation there's a part of me\nI've been through the ups and downs of\nthat where I've been like God I hate\ndealing with my health right because\nit's so stressful and now I'm in a\nbetter place with it but that's taken a\nlong long long long long time to even\nrecognize that healing journey of\nrealizing I'm doing this because I love\nmyself I'm doing this because I in\nmyself I'm doing this because I love my\nbody I love my heart I love myself which\nis why I get to do this but that has\ntaken a long time even for me so walk us\nthrough how people can balance that\nstress to be healthy when it should be\nmaking us less stressed I no that's\nanother good one it's just like this\nover supplementing and like you know you\nwalk into Awan and you like talk about\nstress there's all this you know healthy\nbeautiful food and you don't know what\nto choose right it's like oh my God like\nthere's so much out there it's just\noverwhelm and I feel like you know\nyou've just got to get back in tune with\nyourself and you've you know you can't\noverdo anything I think you got to go\nback to the basics you know you just got\nto go back to eating real food try to do\nthat you've got to you know if the\nsupplements are disturbing you just do\nless just do the basics of what you need\nyou know multivitamin vitamin D\nmagnesium just simple things you've got\nto hydrate you know you got to sleep\nlike um just like you can't like get all\nworked up over these things because\nyou're right you're not going to do them\nyou're just like not going to do them\nlike I find people just being like this\nis way too much you want it to be simple\nyou want them to feel better you want\nthem to see results so less is more and\nI feel like you know we have become a\nsociety where we're doing way too much\nand we just we got to pull back we got\nto just we got to believe in ourselves I\nthink you know with the meditation like\nI'm a huge meditator and that's so\nhelpful for me because I'm a type A\npersonality and I'm always like go go go\nand I got to get [ __ ] done um but when I\npull back and I meditate and I do yoga\nand I chill out like then every my my\nmind tells me what I need you know cuz I\ncould do that too I can overs supplement\nI can you know be really like tight\nabout wow I went to this restaurant and\nthey didn't have gluten-free pizza or\nyou know or wild salmon I remember\nordering that stuff and my whole family\nbe like oh my God we can't eat with you\nbecause you're such a pain in the ass\nbut now I'm just like okay who cares you\nknow but I do you do have to kind of\nlike get back in touch with and\nreconnect your mind with your body and\nbe like okay what works for me you know\nI can't like you can't you can't go\ncrazy about this stuff how have you\nallowed yourself to fall in love with\nyourself and your body and your heart\nand your mind again and again and again\nwhen the body gets older it changes it\ntransitions it shifts like what what\nhave what has been like\nyour what has been your your inner\npractice to to keep that do you really\nit's I'm asking really\ndeep I'm ask deep question yeah yeah\nthis is um this is fascinating um but uh\nyou know when I did figure it out like\nat 58 years old um I did plant medicine\nso I did psilocybon and a journey and I\nreally did see what my subconscious was\ndoing to me my subconscious was you know\nstill labeling me as sick kid always\nfearful I was looking over my shoulder\nthat another illness was going to come\nalong the way I was never going to be\nhealthy I didn't even know what calm or\nself-love felt like you know so that\nreally I saw what I was doing to myself\nand I also felt a sense of peace and\ncalm with that so once I was able to\nrelease all of those you know\nsubconscious feelings that weren't\nworking for me anymore I grabbed on to\nthe ones that I was like okay I want\nthat calm I want that self-love more and\num that's what really got me in touch\nwith it and then that's when when I\nmeditate I can go back to that place\nwhere I was when I did some plant\nmedicine to get me past that hump I had\ndone a lot of therapy I had done a lot\nof raiki a lot of meditation a lot of\nenergy healing crystals all this stuff\nbut uh that was really the the place\nthat put me over the edge to really get\nme to a place where I could recapture\nyou know and really find that calmness\nand happiness and like that felt so\nincredible that feeling so I journal A\nyou know I do have to journal and and\ntalk about what frustrates me during the\nday to let go of it and then I talk\nabout what I'm gra grateful for that's\nhuge the meditation is huge the yoga is\nhuge just like also getting out in\nnature is absolutely huge I mean we\nhaven't talked about this at all but you\nknow and you probably do this you know\ngetting out in Morning Sun is a practice\nthat is just incredible like it boosts\nyour mood it actually helps with\ndepression you know it helps with the\nimmune system it helps lower blood sugar\nand blood pressure and it's like a\nbeautiful way to start your day the sun\nis so incredible so that those are and\nthen I just feel like so hopeful because\nthe sun comes up every day right you\nknow it goes down it comes up it's like\nokay everything's going to be okay I\nwant to go back to the prom medicine\npoint because I I love hearing that and\nand I want to dive into that with you I\ndidn't know if that was something I\ncould talk about 100% 100% of course it\nis uh for someone who doesn't know what\na plant medicine Journey looks like like\nwalk us through what that Journey looks\nlike so um it is psilocybon mushrooms\nand I've done iasa psilocybon bunch of\nplant medicine um and I did it with a\nshaman a one-on-one which was beautiful\nbecause I recommend that um because\nthere's a lot of things you want to\nmanifest and like let go of um where did\nyou go to do this I did it at home\nactually the shaman came to me and um\nand sah was a friend of mine and there\nwas just a lot of stuff I was dealing\nwith and some insomnia at the time and\nso he came and we kind of manifested\nwhat I wanted to release and when I was\non the journey with the with the\nmushrooms um he would talk to me and say\nhey how are you feeling you know what do\nyou think of this you know when you were\nsick or when you had cancer or your\nhusband died I mean and I was like you\nknow wow that was a really difficult\ntime that I haven't let go of those\nthought patterns and the fear I haven't\nlet go of that so it was so he was like\nokay what does it feel like if you were\nto let go of that and I'm like can I let\ngo of that is that like possible and\nhe's like absolutely you can get to the\nother side of this because you know the\nfirst seven years of our life our\nsubconscious is fully downloaded and\nthen you know those thought patterns\nkeep repeating themselves in our in our\nsubconscious and we operate 95% out of\nour subc conscious which always blows my\nmind Jay Cuz 5% conscious that's crazy\nso I mean that's that's what it did he\nwould write down you know things I said\nand just how I was able to release them\num and once I was able to release them\nJay they didn't come back like it was\nlike the the things that came back was\nthe feeling of the peace and the love\nand like not wanting to beat myself up\nand like be hard on myself and be I was\na perfectionist too that was part of the\nprotocol I think that got me sick and so\nthat perfectionism you know F somewhat\nleft me probably not 100% but a lot of\nit did you're taking the plot medicine\nsomeone's guiding you almost like in a\ntherapy session a coaching s guiding you\nthrough questions and helping you become\naware of where some of these blocks may\nbe where some of these challenges may be\nI'm breaking it down for everyone who\nmay may be unaware and then\nwhat does releasing in that session look\nlike like what what is that is that a\nfeeling is it a visualization is it is\nit you trying to let go like what does\nthat what does that look like in the\nsession and then we'll talk about after\nyeah that's a good question too because\num it it could be a like it could be\nit's a purging it's you know you could\nhysterically cry um because it's like\nit's an emotion that you've hung on to\nfor many many years and you know\nrepeated these thought patterns so it\ncould be crying it could be screaming it\ncould be you know just like this feeling\nof wow I can't believe I've done this to\nmyself and I would say that you know\nit's more like the just the feeling of\nsadness and and the crying and the like\nsome maybe yelling like God damn I can't\nbelieve like how was I so hard on myself\nlike I don't need to be that hard on\nmyself myself you know I didn't need to\ndo that to myself so it was like you\nknow and then he was he's amazing he was\nthere to like hold me and support me and\njust really like you know add just love\nand help me breathe through it and once\nyou kind of like are able to be like\nokay I don't want that anymore in my\nlife and then you breathe through it and\nyou're able to breath work is like you\nknow I'm sure you've done breath work is\nincredible you can actually\nin breath work you can feel like you're\non plant medicine a lot of times so you\nknow breathing through it and releasing\nit through breath work is a beautiful\nthing so that's kind of how it goes yeah\nand are you feeling or seeing both you\ncould see yourself in a distance like\nwhat you do you know it's almost like an\nall you know another you're looking at\nyourself yeah you're feeling it and\nyou're seeing yourself in a distance you\nknow how you're reacting and interacting\nand even if you're interacting with\nother people you know even people in\nyour family or things that have gone on\nyou can actually see it it's kind of\nwild I know it's not for everybody no no\nno no for sure I've I've known many\nclients who've worked with it and and\nfound it to be useful as well I think\nit's important to share\nbecause I want to ask when you come out\nof it like when when the when the when\nthe session is is over how much have you\nfound that you're able to what are you\nholding on to what do you take with you\nand what still stays the same because as\nwe know it's you know no change is ever\nmiraculous or immediate so so what do\nyou take with you and what still exists\nand is a process that that's beautiful\ntoo because what I took with me was that\nsense of calm and like selflove and what\nI wanted to have more in my life but I\ndid also take away you know the part of\nhow much I was beating myself up and you\nknow how hard I was on myself and what I\nhad and why I think I had gotten all\nthese illnesses and why I had gotten the\ncancer and just why I was at the place I\nwas in my life where I wasn't getting\nwhat I really wanted ultimately whether\nit also was with relationships or you\nknow intimately like all those things\nwere really important to me to find and\nyou know there was blockages so I\nrealized like it was really cool to be\nable to journal about those blockages\nlater like oh my God I want to release\nthat and I kind of had to do that and I\nstill have to do that it's not a miracle\ncure I still in my life have to be like\nokay I need to release you know that\nthought pattern I still kind of walk\naround a little bit with it but not to\nthe same extent when I did the journey I\nwas unconscious about it now I'm\nconscious that's a beautiful thing\nabsolutely it's that awareness of yeah\nyou know where something came from what\nwas it for you don't mind sharing what\nwas it that you found when you asked\nlike that's why I believe I'm going to\nget sick again or that's why I got sick\nin the first place where was that coming\nfrom that was coming from like growing\nup because when I was I was sick all the\ntime and my mom you know labeled me a\nsick kid and she would always be like H\nThere She is again sick you know like\nwell we got to be really sensitive with\nher cuz you know she might get sick um\nand so I kind of just you know followed\nthat you know what she said and\ni b that's where that's really where it\ncame from it was those years those early\nyears of always being you know not\nfeeling\nwell and then and you're saying that\nalso helps you then deal with challenges\nthat come today yeah like that awareness\nhelps you make sense of different things\nthat come up now and also with my\nclients um not only for myself it's\nchanged my life completely but my\nclients I can see that happening for\nthem you know because because I've been\nthrough all these health issues and\nbecause I was you know in the\nsubconscious thoughts of these repeated\nmessages that weren't working for me we\ntalk about that you know I'm like okay\nwhat is going on with you that's\nblocking you because there's something\nblocking you from getting healthy or\nwanting to heal or a lot of the cancer\nones you know we talk about those things\nand also they're also like no one's\nasked me that you know no one's asked me\nwhat my blockages are or you know what's\ngoing on with me like did any anything\nhappened in those first seven early\nyears of your life that maybe was\ntraumatic Jay all of them had like death\ndivorce you know or someone was mean to\nthem you know they didn't and then they\nlost trust and faith in the universe\nsort of you know I know it's a little\nwoo woo but they did they lost faith in\nlike you know that they didn't have\nwhat's in them to be able to overcome it\nand I think like that has been like a\nbeautiful thing for me working with\nclients and helping them heal I can't\nI'm not trained to get them past it you\nknow someone like you can get them past\nit to some degree um but you know it's\nlike that work of you know diving into\nthe subconscious and I also I work with\na hypnotist that's beautiful and some\nenergy healers that are wonderful too\nand I'll send them to them as well if\nthey need to like do the extra work and\nmost of them do what do you find those\nmodalities support and and by the way I\nagree I think I mean you know what we're\nreally talking about today and I\nencourage people to follow their own\nintuition and guide as to what speaks to\nthem\nbecause as it's almost like as you grow\nand learn more you realize how much\nthere is still to explore and how\neveryone's so different and you know\neveryone needs a different way to become\naware and a different way to become\nconscious like I found a lot of my\npersonal Awakening in Consciousness in\nmeditation and being with my teachers\nand listening for hours and study and\npractice and then I meet people who\nneeded a you know moment of Revelation\nthrough plot medicine or I meet people\nwho found it another way and I just\nrealized everyone is so different and\neveryone's trauma is so different and\neveryone's healing Journey looks so\ndifferent that we can't close the door\non any of these modalities because and\nand I always say that like sometimes\npeople ask me like would you be open to\nthis and I like if I needed something if\nI was trying to unblock something I'd be\nopen to anything because I should be\nlike why should I close off from any\nopportunity for healing that I need just\nbecause it may not be as common or or is\nuh or is marketed or whatever whatever\nthe right word is but but for you I\nguess the question I was asking\nis when you're we we're talking about\nthis like 360 degree approach when you\ntalked about hypnotism and what was the\nother modality you just mentioned Just\nEnergy healing energy healing so\nspecifically with hypnotism like where\ndoes that modality play into everything\nwe've talked about today like what is\nbecause again I think it sounds so\nmysterious and maybe like you said Woo\nWoo but like what is the point of that\nmodality is I guess the question I'm\nasking so I feel like some hypnotists\nthat are really good are able to tap\ninto your subconscious as well so a\nlittle bit like therapy but you know it\ngoes much deeper than talk therapy um\nthe hypnotist that I work with she's\nable like I'll talk to her about\nsomething that is bothering me or I\ncan't sleep about out and she's like oh\nthis is what's like at the root of your\nissue and I'm like how did you know that\nshe can like dive in and see like this\nis what's bothering you um so that's\nwhat I find is really helpful and then\nshe'll do a meditation specifically for\nme so I've had tremendous amount of\nclients go to her or to a hypnotist\nthat's really good who don't eat healthy\nwho don't exercise who don't sleep well\nso then they go and she's able to get\nthem to sleep well with you know she's\nable to find out what is causing them\nnot to sleep well and she's able to get\nthem to eat healthy like it's kind of\ncrazy they'll wake up the next day and\nautomatically start thinking about\neating healthy now I have to tell you\nthat this doesn't last so you have to\nlisten to her meditations again or see\nher again or you know again it's like a\npractice well because basically what\nyou're saying here is that we're re\nevery decision thought choice we make is\nsimply a programming of our\nsubconscious and we've created a\nsubconscious pattern since we were born\nthat has led us to where we are now and\nif we don't like where we are and we\nwant to shift it we have to reprogram\nour subconscious mind and that\nrequires understanding your thoughts\nself-awareness journaling meditating\nreflection and then if you need it plant\nmedicine hypnotism what you know just\njust the plethora of of options there\nbecause I think what we get stuck with\nis we believe that our current set of\nhabits are who we are right we think\nthat the way we eat now is who we are\nand what we need and what it needs to be\nnot realizing that it is simply a\nprogrammed pattern that you adopted at\none point in your life and you started\nto believe it was you oh right yeah\nabsolutely absolutely like that's what\nthat's what's so fascinating I think\nabout what I get to do cuz I do find\nthat you know people do feel like you\nknow this is where I'm going to be this\nis what I know this is you know I'm not\ngoing to ever get past here um I might\nget a little better but I might not get\ngreat yes and I'm like what's with this\nlittle better you need to be great like\nI feel that way with my life like at 64\nI feel great I feel better than I did\nwhen I was in my 20s um so I want people\nto like know that you know when I say\nhow are you I want them to say great not\nI'm just okay so yeah that you know all\nof those patterns that they learn some\nare luckier than others that have better\npatterning and you know better\nupbringings in terms of just like\nhealthier Lifestyles um and maybe not so\nyou know they were more secure and you\nknow self-awareness earlier on in their\nlife which is lucky for them but a lot\nof people that I work with weren't and\nlike you it's never too late to change\nyou know I feel like you know we're\nthere's a lot of years to live right I\nmean my mom is 94 I know so like she's\ngoing strong and I'm like I hope I'm 94\nand going strong like that you know but\nit takes work to get there and to do\nthat and I Fe that's really just all of\nthis I want you know the modalities are\nendless out there as you know you know\nlike anti-aging and just all of the new\nstuff in the stem cells and the you know\nNAD and just everything cunge and just\nall of it is a beautiful thing infrared\njust getting us healthier and healthier\nso I mean it's a lot to like learn but\nit's kind of cool that you know we're on\nthe precipice of all these beautiful\nthings that can really turn back the\nclck absolutely have you ever talked to\nyour mother about the sick kid label yes\nyes yeah and you know it was beautiful\nbecause she did apologize she's like you\nknow um I didn't know any different and\nwhich she didn't you know she didn't\nknow and I think that um you know a lot\nof us like taking care of people too and\nshe loved being able to take care of me\nwhen I was sick too and I felt I felt\nnurtured in those times as well so I got\na little something out of it wasn't all\nbad yeah yeah yeah absolutely Alissa it\nhas been such a joy to talk to you today\nand honestly your personal Journey\nthat's led to so much Professional\nService and love and support for so many\npeople and the amount of insight that\nyou've given today I think everyone's\ngoing to be able to take away and this\nis what I would encourage everyone to do\nis Alyssa shared so much great advice\ntoday find just one thing that you want\nto practice for the next seven days it\nmay be to eat more Whole Foods it may be\nto cut out sugar it may be to research a\nbit more about information and learn\nabout like I think just pick one thing\nthat resonates with you that you want to\ntry and uplevel your life with it could\nbe getting your vitamin D right it could\nbe sun exposure whatever else it may be\nand start there and just feel the\nconfidence shift from doing one thing\nper week and then keep adding more uh\nand a lot can happen Alyssa we end every\nepisode of the podcast with a final five\nthese Fast Five have to be answered in\none word to one sentence maximum oh God\nand so they C that way so Alysa Goodman\nthese are your final five the first\nquestion is what is the best advice\nyou've ever heard or received To Love\nYourself to Learn To Love Yourself\nbeautiful uh second question what is the\nworst advice you've ever had or received\nthat you're never going to get\nbetter you're not going to\nheal uh question number three what's\nsomething that you used to believe was\ntrue about good health but you don't\nthink so anymore I used to believe that\njust sleeping was going to get me\nhealthy you know good sleep was going to\nget me healthy talk to me a bit better\nand it's not just that anything right\nit's not just one thing it's a\ncombination of things yeah and we're\nalways looking for that one thing like\nwe all want that one miracle drug like\nwhat's that one thing I need to do\nthat's going to change my life and yeah\nit's 360 there is no one yeah that makes\nsense question number four what's the\nfirst thing you do every morning and the\nlast thing you do every night the first\nthing I do every morning is probably\njournal and uh Journal about how I want\nmy day to look like and the same thing\nat night beautiful to release the stress\nwonderful and Fifth and final question\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be I would\nsay just be kind kind to yourself and\nothers you know um really understand try\nto understand that people are going\nthrough a lot in their life and to not\njudge right\naway you know to have some\nself-compassion for yourself and the\nothers you're with yeah I I mean I\ncouldn't agree with you I really be I\nreally believe that the reason we judge\nothers so harshly is because we're so\nharsh on ourselves and we have haven't\nfound the ability to show ourselves that\nselflove that compassion that empathy\nand so it's so difficult to show it\nexternally to people we've never met or\ndon't know and yeah I love that Alysa is\nthere anything that I haven't asked you\nthat was on your heart and mind that you\nreally want to share that you really\nfeel like is your called to right now or\nfeel intuitively is is\nimportant um and you don't have to have\nanything yeah I mean I think we did\ntouch on you know just ending with the\nfact you know that you you know life can\nget better in every way emotionally\nphysically spiritually you know don't\ngive up on yourself is probably my\nbiggest you know don't ever ever give up\non yourself I love that I mean you're a\ngreat you're a great spokesperson for\nthat for sure and I I love that energy I\nthink it's so easy to be like oh my best\ndays are behind me it's all going in the\nwrong direction now or you know whatever\nit may be and I mean just sitting with\nyou and hearing from you today I can\ntell just how real the opposite of that\nis for you and it's aspirational\ninspiring for me for sure because yeah\nyou you continue to live an exciting\nlife and know that there's so much more\nlife to live as opposed to accepting\nthat this is the end or or this may not\nbe and I think it's really interesting I\nwas talking to a friend about this this\nidea of how we often think we manifest\nbad things kind of like your sick kid\napproach like we often think like oh my\nGod I did this to myself and I was\ntalking to a friend about this and this\nidea of like well if we can do that to\nourself then we surely can do the\nopposite what I just want to get your\nsense on that absolutely I know that\nthat's a big that's a big thing\nhappening out there I mean you know um\nI'll just I can I need to plug my two\ngirls who are my inspiration in my life\nand um you know I feel like man I like\nmanifested the relationship with them\nlike I can't live without them and I\nlook up to them and I admire them and\nyou know I want to uh be here to be a\nspokesperson for them so that when they\nhave bad days and they say maybe\nsomething like that hey I think I\nmanifested this bad stuff to happen I'm\nlike no you can change that you know you\ncan manifest the good stuff in your life\nand that's really drives me every day is\nto be able to like hopefully be there\nfor them to help them manifest the good\nstuff yes I know that a lot of people\nfeel like they manifest the bad things\nbut you're right you can totally change\nit around and you know I and they're\nyoung and I definitely didn't have the\nawareness they have in their 20s I wish\nI did I'm really bummed about that um\nbecause I am really in awe of how they\nfunction and operate and you know how\nquickly they can turn things around for\nthemselves um and I think they've been\nthrough a lot probably that's why but um\nyeah the manifesting the good stuff I\nwant them and you know when I'm not here\nlater in my life you know I want them to\nbe able to be able to do that\neasily I love that well I think you set\nthem up for amazing success uh and they\nset me up yeah and I and I didn't start\ntalking about them because I could have\nspend the whole epis talking about\nJordan so I don't know know true but\nyeah but thank you so much Alysa for\ncoming on to on purpose everyone who's\nbeen listening and watching make sure\nyou share your favorite insights moments\nI mean today was a full 360 degree\nconversation we went from gut health to\ndetoxing to Cleansing to plant medicine\nI mean it's it's beautiful when this\nhappens and I hope that you're\nintroduced to new modalities I hope that\nyou allow yourself to be open to new\napproaches again we're not recommending\nthat there's one right approach or a\nwrong approach or however the point is\nto give you a menu of options and ideas\nand opportunities because the biggest\nloss in life is feeling like you only\nhave one way to do something and when\nthat way doesn't work or you've tried it\na lot and it still doesn't benefit you\nthat's when we mostly give up and I\nthink recognizing that there's a whole\nvariety of options ideas insights\nexpertise out there actually fills you\nwith more confidence that you'll find\nyour way exactly thank you so much for\nhaving me what an honor such a joy thank\nyou if you love this episode you will\nenjoy my interview with Dr Daniel aan on\nhow to change your life by changing your\nbrain if we want a healthy mind it\nactually starts with a healthy brain you\nknow I've had the blessing or the curse\nto scan over a thousand convicted felons\nand over a 100 murderers and their\nbrains are very damaged"
