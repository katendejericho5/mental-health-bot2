please\nwelcome to on purpose Johan hurry Johan\nthank you for being here oh I'm\nridiculously happy to be here thank you\nso much honestly I mean it I was saying\nthis to you offline but I I'd like to\nrepeat it for my audience you're one of\nthe most gripping and captivating\nauthors that I've read in a long time in\nthe non-fiction space I enjoy your work\nso deeply I feel completely enthralled\nwhen I'm reading your work I love the\nway you tell stories and you\neffortlessly with so much grace and\nkindness bring people into a universe\nthat they can understand very complex\nthings and make sense of how to apply\nthem in their life which is so hard hard\nto do so thank you so much for all the\nwork that you do and the experiments you\ndo on yourself oh cheers thanks J yeah\nand and the fact that we're from very\nsimilar places World we're basically\nneighbors neighbors yeah exactly we\nmight go a little bit too British in\nthis podcast I've going to try and\nremember we are talking to mostly\nAmerican audience I was saying to I once\nI was once in a diner in fact in an IHOP\nin a place called Cactus Arizona and I\nwas trying to order pancakes I kept\nsaying can I have some pancakes please\nand she kept going what what and after a\nwhile she said to me do you speak\nEnglish I was like my people invented it\nwhat do you mean right so I'm very\nconscious that you know we sound like\nweird refugees from Downtown Abbey I'm\ngoing to try and americanize slightly\nwell it's funny because every time I'm\nin when I'm in I live in the United\nStates but everyone in the United St\nalways tells me that they find the\nBritish accent quite authoritative and\nthey see it as a sign of education and\nknowledge and for me when I hear a TED\nTalk in the American accent from a\nprofessor or or a researcher that's when\nI find that it's authoritative do you\nfeel that way or what's your dat oh\nthat's so interesting I think because I\nspend I live here half the year I I\nthink I'm kind of torn between our the\nvalue of our accents but I'm conscious\nthat we get given like we we basically\ngo in with the Assumption of 10 added IQ\npoints in any situation right so yeah\nand I'm like if you knew me I'm not from\na posh part of England like I'm not\nanyway we sound like hilariously part\nlike I was rally raised by my\ngrandmother whose job was to clean\ntoilets but we sound basically like the\nQueen the which we're not but uh Yan so\nI want to dive straight into this and I\nwant to start off by saying what are\nsome of the biggest misconceptions\nyou've heard about OIC almost things\nthat people may even be thinking as\nthey're tuning into this or watching\nthis right now what are some of the\nthings people already think they know\nbut you actually believe a m conceptions\nI think the biggest\nmisconception is that we should either\nbe yay these drugs are amazing or boo\nthese drugs evil the biggest\nmisconception is that we can be certain\nor confident about these drugs at the\nmoment I never\nforget from the moment I learned about\nthese drugs existence I felt so\nconflicted it's why I wrote the book\nright I remember the moment so vividly\nit was the winter of 2022 and it was\nthat moment when the world was opening\nup again and I got invited to a party\nfor the first time in God knows how long\nand I decided to go and I was in an Uber\non the way there and the party was\nthrown by an Oscar winning actor I think\nsomeone you know actually and I'm not\nsaying that just a name drop it's\nrelevant to what happened next and um on\nthe way there I was feeling kind of\ngained quite a lot of weight during\nlockdown was feeling kind of schlubby I\nwas quite fat at the start of lockdown I\nwas fatter then and I and I was thinking\noh this is going to be awkward and then\nI suddenly realized that kind of\neveryone I knew had gained some weight\nduring lockdown and I thought oh this is\ngoing to be fascinating to see all these\nHollywood stars with a bit of chub on\nthem right\nand I arrived and I started walking\naround and it wasn't just that no one\nhad gained weight everyone was gone\nright everyone looked like their own\nSnapchat filter right they were like\nclearer and cleaner and sharper and I\nwas kind of wandering around a bit of a\ndays and I bumped into a friend of mine\non the dance\nfloor and I said to her whoa looks like\neveryone really did take up Pates during\nlockdown and she laughed like you just\ndidn't I must have looked puzzled and\nshe said well you know it's not Pilates\nright and I had had no idea what she was\ntalking about and she pulled up on her\nphone and her zic pen and that was when\nI learned I guess in the next couple of\ndays that we now have a new form of\nweight loss drug that works in a\ncompletely new way that causes the\naverage person who uses it to lose 15%\nof their body weight in fact with\nmojarro the next in this class of drugs\nyou lose 21% of your body weight and for\nthe next which will be available next\nyear Triple G you lose 24% of your body\nweight on average and I remember as soon\nas I heard\nthat just feeling this tremendous\ndivision in my mind between on the one\nhand I could obviously see the benefits\nI'm older now than my grandfather ever\ngot to be he died when he was 44 of a\nheart attack loads of the men in my\nfamily get heart problems my dad had\nterrible heart problems my uncle died of\na heart attack my other uncle had a\nheart attack but survived it and I knew\nthat sadly the EV scientific evidence is\nvery clear that obesity makes it much\nmore likely you'll have heart problems\nalong with many other medical problems\nso I thought okay if there's a drug that\ncan reverse or really reduce obes\nthat could have really big health\nbenefits but I also thought wait a\nminute wait a minute I've seen this\nstory before right every 20 years or so\na new Miracle weight loss drug is\nannounced we're told it's going to save\nus all uh loads people take it they\nalways Discover it has some horrendous\nside effect that you know means it has\nto be pulled from the market leaving a\nwave of terribly damaged people in its\nway so I thought are we going to see\nthat again I also thought what about the\nprogress we've made with body posit it\nwhat about the you what about people\nwith eating disorders there was just so\nmany doubts that came into my mind so to\nreally get to the bottom of this I ended\nup going on this big Journey all over\nthe world from Iceland to Minneapolis to\nokanawa in the south of Japan to\ninterview the leading experts in the\nworld on it the biggest Defenders of the\ndrugs the people who made the\nbreakthroughs that made them possible\nthe biggest critics of the drugs and I\nlearned a huge amount about the\nextraordinary benefits of these drugs\nthe disturbing risks of these drugs\nthere's 12 quite disturbing risks how\nit's going to transform the culture in\nall sorts of ways that even people who\ndon't want to take these drugs it's\ngoing to change the world around you in\nreally fascinating ways but at the end\nof all that it's a slightly weird\nfeeling I still feel quite conflicted\nabout it so I guess my the misconception\nis that we should be so sure right this\nis complicated and we have to think\nthrough the complexity so and this idea\nthat we have of or this misconception\nthat you just mentioned that we have of\nthis idea of that it's all good or all\nbad I wondered through your research\nkind of how you felt about that type of\nthinking I feel like as humans we have\nthis very binary thinking about anything\nand everything right that's a good\nperson they're a mean person they're a\nhealthy person they're an unhealthy\nperson when it comes to drugs oh this\none's perfect this one's going to ruin\nyour life what did you discover about\npeople's binary types of thinking\nthrough the research of this drug I\nguess because there's if you think about\nthis this drug and the book is called\nMagic Pilker there's three ways we could\nthink about this is Magic and the first\ntwo are the kind of binary ways right\nthe first way is these drugs could be\nmagic in the sense that they could just\nsolve the problem of obesity and I've\ngot to tell you there are days it feels\nlike that my whole life I've hugely\novereaten because I was screwed up by\nthe food industry and various other\nthings and now you know to do the book\nI've been taking OIC for a year there's\nbeen lots of ups and downs but you know\nnow that problem has largely gone away\nI've lost an enormous amount of weight\n42s also I've lost these a lot of these\ndestructive\nhabits so you know it could be magic in\nthe sense of just like whoa the\nproblem's solved the second way it could\nbe magic and I think this is a real\npossibility is it could be like a magic\ntrick it could be like you know The\nConjurer who shows you a card trick\nwhile secretly picking your pocket it\ncould be that in addition to giving you\nthese benefits the risks and there are\nreally significant risks here are so\nsubstantial that they undo the good a\ndon't rule that out in fact I think it's\na significant\npossibility but the Third Way is\nactually the the most likely and I think\nit's the one that gets us out of that\nkind of binary thinking and it's that\nthink about the stories of magic that we\ngrew up with as kids right think about I\ndon't know Aladdin right you find the\nlamp you rub it the genie appears and he\ngrants your wishes and your wish comes\ntrue but never quite in the way you\nexpected right you get what you wanted\nbut always at some weird right angle\nthat you never anticipated and we're\nalready seeing that with these drugs you\ngot to get out the binary good or bad to\nthink about that but you know Barkley's\nBank uh commissioned a really\ninteresting sober-minded financial\nanalyst called Emily field to just look\nat these drugs to figure out okay what's\nthis going to mean for our investment\ndecisions going forward what should be\ninvesting in what should we not\ninvesting in and she came back and said\nif you if you want a comparison for the\neffect of these drugs you've got to look\nat the invention of the smartphone right\nso if you and me had been speaking in\nwhatever it was 2007 when Steve Jobs\nunveiled the iPhone we would not have\nbeen able to game out you know door Dash\nand Tick Tock and all these things that\nhave transformed our lives that flowed\nfrom that I think we're already\nbeginning to see outside that kind of\nnarrow\nbinary such an array of things that are\nhappening as a result of these 47% of\nAmericans want to take these drugs they\nare going to change all our lives for\nbetter and for worse in a way that I\nthink we need to take a moment as this\nextraordinary transformation happens all\naround us to really think through the\nbenefits the risk\nand what it's going to mean for all of\nus and what we should do about it now\nyeah let's talk about how we got here\nyou mentioned there that the food\nindustry is screwed us up screwed you up\nyou mentioned just there let's talk\nabout how we got here how we even needed\nto turn towards these drugs starting\nwith some of the issues that you think\nthe food industry has caused and how\nwe've been trained to almost eat more\neat worse eat unhealthier for ourselves\nfor a long time uh I thought when I was\nresearching the book that I was looking\nat two separate topics CU I thought at\nfirst so I was looking at why did\nobesity explode in our lifetimes\nmassively explode and how do the drugs\nwork but actually I discovered these are\nnot separate topics the same thing\nexplains both it's core so I would just\nurge everyone watching listening to just\nstop for a moment and Google photographs\nof beaches in the United States or\nBritain in the year I was born 1979 just\ntake a look at them right if you look at\nthem they seem really weird to us\nbecause almost everyone is what we would\ncall skinny or jacked right you look at\nit you think that's really weird where's\neveryone else was it like a skinny\nperson convention in Atlantic City that\nday and then you look at the population\nfigures no that's what people look like\nin the year I was born we basically\nhumans have bit more than 300,000 years\nin which obesity is extremely rare and\nthen essentially in your lifetime and\nmine it absolutely blows up between the\nyear I was born and year I turned 21\nobesity doubled in the United States and\nthen in the next 20 years severe obesity\ndoubled again and it seems really weird\nwhat's going on what would what could\npossibly explain this unprecedented\ntransformation in our bodies where we\ngot to the point where now 42% of\nAmericans are obes right seems really\nweird what happened we know what\nhappened this change takes place\neverywhere where one thing happens it's\nnot where people become weak willed or\nlack willpower or become lazy or all the\nother cruel stigmatizing things we say\nabout overweight people it always\nhappens where people move from Mostly\neating fresh Whole Foods that they\nprepared on the day to mostly eating\nprocessed and ultr processed foods which\nare constructed in factories out of\nchemicals in a process that actually\nisn't even called cooking it's called\nmanufacturing food and it turns out this\nnew kind of food which never existed\nbefore in human history affects our\nbodies in a completely different way to\nthe old kind of food that All Humans\nbefore as eight and there's loads of\nways that's true I go through seven\nreasons in the book but there's an\nexperiment that was actually done here\nin New York that to me just totally\ndistills what happened to us right so\nit's done by a brilliant Irish scientist\ncalled Professor Paul Kenny not just out\nthe road from where we are uh so he's\nthe head of neuroscience at Mount Si\nhere in New York and he grew up in\nDublin in Ireland and when he was in his\n20s he moved to San Diego in California\nto continue his scientific research and\nhe quickly clocked whoa Americans don't\neat like Irish people did at the time\nmuch more processed and Ultra processed\nfood much more sugary salty food right\nand like many a good immigrant he\nquickly assimilated within a year he'd\ngained like 30 pounds and he was like\nwhoa what's going on and he felt like\nthis new kind of food he was eating\nwasn't just affecting his gut it was\naffecting his brain it was changing what\nhe wanted so he designed this experiment\nto test it which I have nicknamed\ncheesecake Park it's not the official\nname of it it's very simple he got a\nload of rats and he raised them in a\ncage and they had nothing to eat but but\nthe kind of healthy food that rats\nevolved to eat over thousands of years\nright in pellet form so when the rats\nhave got the kind of natural food they\nused to they would eat when they were\nhungry and they would stop when they\nwere full and they never became\noverweight or obese given their kind of\nnatural food they had a kind of innate\nnutritional wisdom that meant they were\nG I've had enough now then Professor\nKenny introduced them to the American\ndiet he fried up some bacon he bought a\nload of Snickers bars crucially he\nbought a load of cheesecake and he put\nit in the cage alongside the option the\nhealthy food and the Rats went crazy for\nthe American diet they would literally\nHur themselves into the cheesecake and\neat their way out just completely\nslicked with cheesecake right and they\nate and ate and ate and ate and all that\nnutritional wisdom they'd had before\ndisappeared they they just rapidly\nbecame obese in fact the way Professor\nKenny put it to me was within a couple\nof days they were different animals and\nso this this nutritional wisdom that\nthey'd had before with their natural\nfood just disappeared the brakes were\noff right then Professor Kenny tweeted\nthe experiment in a again in a way that\nto a lifelong junk food addict seems to\nme a bit cruel he took away the American\ndiet and left them with nothing but the\nhealthy food they'd grown up with and he\nwas pretty sure he knew what would\nhappen that they would you know eat more\nof the healthy food than they had before\nand this would prove that junk food\nexpands the number of calories you eat\nin a day that is not what happened\nsomething much weirder happened once\nthey'd had the American diet and it was\ntaken away they refused to eat anything\nat all it was like they no longer\nrecognized the healthy food as food it\nwas only when they were really starving\nthat they finally went back and ate it\nnow what this tells us and there's loads\nof evidence in humans is the diet we're\neating is profoundly undermining our\nability to ever feel full and to in fact\nthe key word here both in explaining the\nrise of obesity and how these drugs work\nis satiety it's not a word we use that\noften in everyday English but it's the\nfeeling of being sated the feeling of\nhaving had enough and not want anymore\nand this kind of food we eat profoundly\nsteals our satiety right and what these\ndrugs do is they give you back your\nsense of satiety they give you back your\nsense of being full but with a potential\ncost right yeah and that's it's so\nfascinating to hear how so much of it\nhas become stigmatized you don't have\nenough self-control you don't have\nenough willpower you're not disciplined\nenough and that's why it's leading to\nthese things and as you're saying I mean\nI've also read different work that talks\nabout how our portion sizes have\nincreased and I remember the first time\nI came to the United States I think I\nwas 9 years old with my family we were\ncoming to Orlando to go to Disney World\nOrlando yeah yeah I was going to get you\nto sing the OIC song in a second uh but\nwe come to Orlando and I remember like\ngetting one of those you could get like\nthis jumbo size Coke like which was\nrefillable at the gas station and then\nif you wanted you could get the double\njumbo size Coke which was refill every\ngas station and I couldn't believe in\nthat's all I wanted as a kid right I was\nlike that's the coolest thing ever my\nparents got it for me and then I was\ndrinking refillable Cokes the whole time\nthat's when you got diabetes the first\ntime right yeah and I'm predisposed to\ndiabetes because my genetic so it's so\ninteresting and and similarly for me I\ngrew up as a chocolate addict so I ate a\nchocolate bar a chocolate yogurt a\nchocolate biscuit and a chocolate ice\ncream every day growing up and I was\nvery overweight growing up I lost a lot\nof weight were you really you don't look\nlike you've ever been up until age 14 15\nand then at 15 I started playing a lot\nof sports I soon after became vegetarian\nand I and I lost a ton of weight and for\nme what happened though was I still had\nbad habits so I got through University\nhaving a Sprite and a chocolate bar\nevery single day and it wouldn't show up\nas fat physically but it would show up\nas you know now I see it as glucose\nspikes now I see it as an increase in\nthe chances of having diabetes and and\nheading in that direction and my wife\nhas been the one to coach me more on the\nside of self-control and discipline and\nfinding Alternatives and I've seen a\nhuge shift in my life ever since I've\nstopped refined sugars ever since I've\nuh switched my diet to Whole Foods less\nprocessed foods and I've done it in a\nvery self-controlled way I know how hard\nthat is I know how prone I still am to\nhaving craving sometimes and at the same\ntime I've lost taste for certain and\nthings anyway I'm saying all of that to\nask you the question of portion sizes\nhave increased we're eating fake foods\nthat are making us want them more we\ndon't feel satiated when we're\nconsuming how does the drug actually\nmake you feel satiated because I think\nit's important for people to understand\nthat what is happening in order for you\nto feel satiated it's the weirdest thing\nI'll tell you the how it feels as an\nindividual and then the science of\nit I'll never forget the second day I\ntook a zenic I woke up and I was lying\nin bed and I thought oh I feel something\nreally weird what is it and I couldn't\nlocate in my body what it was and it\ntook me about five minutes and I\nsuddenly\nrealized I'd woken up and I wasn't\nhungry I don't remember that ever\nhappening before right from when I was\nvery young you know grew up in a\nworkingclass family we ate constant\nprocessing junk\nfood and I I was in a bit of a days and\nI went to there's a cafe just around the\ncorner from where I live and I went in\nand I ordered what I used to order every\nmorning for breakfast when I'm in London\nit was um a big brown roll with loads of\nchicken and loads of mayo in it and\nI I had like three or four\nmouthfuls and I just didn't want anymore\nI was full I was full in a way that I\nnever normally felt full I thought\nthat's really weird and I went for lunch\nthat day I went to there a Turkish cafe\nnext to my office and I went\nin and I ordered what I used to order\nevery day when I went there there which\nwas a Mediterranean land and again I had\nthree or four mouthfuls and I was just\nfull it was it was so strange it was\nlike kind of shutters had come down on\nmy appetite I can't think of another way\nto describe it or it was more like when\nI ate so imagine you had just have had\nThanksgiving dinner or Christmas dinner\nand you were stuffed and then I came\nalong and said hey Jay great news I got\nyou a KFC bucket right you'd just be\nlike oh no but you get to that level\nreally really quickly so obviously I\ninterviewed the people who made the\nbreakthroughs for these drug scientists\nwho worked on\nkey stages of developing the\ndrug one of the weird things about this\ndrug is we don't actually know how it\nworks but there's some things we know\nfor sure there's a big amount of\nindeterminacy but there's some things we\nknow for sure if you ate something now\nit doesn't matter what it is something\nhealthy unhealthy after a little while\nyour pancreas would produce a hormone\ncalled glp1 and gp1 we now know is just\npart of like the natural signaling in\nyour body saying hey Jay you had enough\nstop it's like the breakes right but\nthat natural glp1 only stays around in\nyour system for a couple of minutes and\nthen it's just washed away so what these\ndrugs do is they inject you with an\nartificial copy of gp1 that instead of\nbeing washed away in a few minutes stays\naround your system for a whole week it's\nwhy when I go to the cafe I only want\nthree or four mouthfuls because I'm\nalready so close to full my gp1 or this\nartificial boosting of gp1 makes me feel\nfull so quickly so initially it was\nthought when they were developing these\ndrugs that because this hormone is made\nin the gut it has an effect primarily on\nthe gut this must be a drug that's you\nknow changing your gut in some way and\nit clearly is right and there's all\nsorts of ways we know that but from\ninterviewing The Cutting Edge scientists\nworking on this particular\nneuroscientist it's increasingly clear\nthat in fact these drugs work primarily\non your brain you don't just have gp1\nreceptors in your gut you've got them in\nyour thyroid which is important for\nsomething else and your brain and and\nthese drugs are profoundly changing your\nbrain we know that if you give these\ndrugs to rats and then you kill them and\ncut their brain saon which obviously\nyou're not allowed to do with humans for\nvery good reasons what you see is the\ndrug goes everywhere in the rat's brain\neverywhere right so I remember when I\nlearned that and I learned it quite a\nwhile into you know a few months into\ntaking the drugs it's disconcerting\nthing to learn you realize how would I\nput it it's a much more intimate\ntransformation right something that\nchanges your gut you feel like oh okay\nthat's fine something that's changing\nyour brain and profoundly changing your\nbrain um partly explains why the effect\nis so powerful why these are so much\nmore effective than all previous diet\ndrugs it also potentially raises some\nother benefits in terms of benefits for\naddiction it also raises some other\nrisks around whether it may cause\ndepression because there's a debate\nabout what what it's actually doing in\nyour brain but for me it just sort of\nmade me realize oh this is a like I say\na much more intimate change than than\nthan a lot of people realize I think\nwhen they start taking it yeah was it\nwho was it was it your nephew who said\nuh where is Yan Harry and what have you\ndone with him it was nephew my little\ngodson I God a to take it I took them to\nMcDonald's so I have a long my\nrelationship with um junk food is\nprobably best typified by one of the low\npoints in my life I was um I can tell\nyou exactly when it happened it was 1\np.m. on Christmas Eve 2009 and I went to\nmy local branch of KFC in East London\nand I went in I said my standard order\nwhich is so disgusting I'm not going to\nrepeat it in front of some healthy glow\nit was literally a bucket of fried\nchicken and the trust me I love a bucket\nof fried chicken you look like you were\nsuch a healthy GL you you've never eaten\na chicken drumstick I'm BL based now but\nback in the day like that popcorn\nchicken would have been my jam yeah the\nguy behind the counter said to me oh Yan\nI'm really glad you're here I was like\nall right and he went off behind when\nthey frow the chicken and\neverything and he came back with a\nmassive Christmas card in which they'd\nwritten to our best customer and\neveryone had written like personal\nmessages to me and one of the reasons my\nheart sank is I thought this isn't even\nthe Fried Chicken shop I come to the\nmost how can this be happening to me it\nwas the second lowest moment in my uh my\nlife as an overweight person that the\nworst was the time that I was fat shamed\nby the Dal L but um but no there was\nthis moment where it's not even a joke\nby the way um you need to tell us tell\nthe horror of the D another time but the\nso I'd had this very intimate\nrelationship with this\nfood\nall all my life and to have\nit one of the there were many good\nthings that flowed from Teo zic for me\nand there are many benefits to it as\nwell as some significant risks but the\nweirdest moment for me actually was\nanother moment that happened in KFC in\nfact one of my nephew said to me a lot\nof the key moments in your life seem to\nhappen in bres of KFC I heard that's a\ngood point um but the I had a real\nEpiphany about this because what these\ndrugs do is they profoundly interrupt\nyour underlying eating patterns right\nyou you can't eat the way you did before\nand this is something I think people are\nnot being warned about and I tried to\ntake people through in a lot of detail\nin the book is you need to be\nprepared that because of that a lot of\nthe underlying emotional issues that\ndrive your eating May well come to the\nsurface so I had this moment for\nme I was in Vegas I was um as you know\nI'm writing a book about a series of\ncrimes that have been happening in Vegas\nthat I've been researching for a long\ntime and I was researching the murder of\nsomeone that I knew and loved and it was\nobviously very painful as you can\nimagine he was an he was an incredible\nperson I was working on this and I just\nyou know felt bad and um I went to this\nbranch of KFC on West Sahara which is\none of the grimmest KFCs in the world\nand believe me I could write a book\nabout all of them and I went in and\nreally on autopilot this was like seven\neight months into taking the\ndrugs\nI I went in and I ordered what I would\nhave ordered a year before right I\nordered a bucket of fried chicken and I\nhad a chicken and I wasn't even really\nthinking about the eating or anything I\nwas and I had a a a chicken drumstick\nand I looked at this bucket and I\nthought I can't eat this right like I I\nwould throw up if I tried to eat this\nand I remember Colonel Sanders was on\nthe wall and it was like he was looking\nat me going hey what happened to my best\ncustomer and I thinking oh you're just\ngoing to have to feel your feelings\nright and it's interesting if you look\nat the scientific evidence there's\nscientific evidence for five reasons why\nwe eat one of them is the obvious one to\nsustain our bodies and I would have told\nyou before I started taking this drug\nthat was why I ate right but here I am\nthen I ate maybe 3,200 calories a day\nnow I around 1,800\nso all that other eating was doing\nsomething else right and I go through\nthe the the the the four psychological\nreasons uh why we eat they don't\nobviously applies differently to\ndifferent people and those things kind\nof get surfaced and I remember going to\none of my closest friends when I got\nback from\nVegas and saying to her I've got to stop\ntaking this I can't take it this is too\nupsetting and she said to me yoan stop\ntaking it if you want to that's fine but\nyou need to know these drugs are not\ncausing this issue this issue was there\nalong in this case what they're doing is\ngiving you an opportunity to deal with\nthose issues in a better way than\ndrowning your feelings in saturated fats\nright and that's been a\nbumpy uh transition although I'm glad I\nI'm glad I stuck with it although lots\nof people I respect uh I respect the\nfact they don't walk me through why\npeople don't like what what was what was\ntheir reasoning what what were they\nstruggling with so much I think there's\na lot of things people struggle with\nwith the drugs but in relation to that\nI'm sure we get into lots of them but if\nwe think about this specific specific\none if you want to think about the\nbenefits and risks of these drugs when\nit comes to\nobesity I actually think it's quite\nhelpful to look at a parallel area of\nscience we've only been giving these\ndrugs to people for obesity for a couple\nof years but there's a parallel area of\nscience that can help us to think about\nthe benefits and I think some of the\nanswer to your\nquestion so and it's bariatric surgery\nright up to now it's been very hard\nwithout some kind of external\nintervention to lose huge amounts of\nweight and keep it off clearly you did\nit there are lots of people who do it\nbut it's\na surprisingly small percentage of the\npeople who try it succeed I go through\nwhy in the book and that reasons are\nreally important so actually the most\neffective way up to now has been\nbariatric surgery things like you know\nstomach stapling gastric\nsleeves bariatric surgery is a horrific\noperation it's really grueling you know\none in a thousand people die during the\noperation it's no joke right but the\nreason people put themselves through\nthat is because of the extraordinary\nbenefits to their health afterwards if\nyou have now bear in mind they were\nseverely obese the start otherwise you\nwouldn't qualify for the surgery but if\nyou if you have this surgery in the\nseven years that follow you are 56% less\nlikely to die of a heart attack you are\n60% less likely to die of cancer you are\n92% less likely to die of diabetes\nrelated causes in fact it's so good for\nyour health that you're 40% less likely\nto die at all in that 7-year period\nright and we know similarly that these\ndrugs are moving us in a similar\nDirection so if you take these drugs and\nyour BMI is higher than 27 at the start\nyou are 20% less likely to have a heart\nattack or stroke right in the years that\nfollow that's a very that's I was going\nto say it's close to my heart it is\nliterally close to my heart right but\nyou also when you look at bariatric\nsurgery begin to see some of the\ndrawbacks and I think the key to what\nyou're asking might be\nthere so one of the things that I think\nis really shocking is if you have\nbariatric surgery your suicide rate\nquadruples in the years that follow\nright it's still quite a low risk most\npeople have barric surgery glad they did\nit but quadrupling that's that's that's\na big effect right I think why would\nthat be what's going on I think there's\nlots of things going on there some of it\nis actually the after effects of the\nsurgery are pretty honorous some of it\nis you can't Comfort it anymore so that\npain comes to the surface um some of it\nis a lot of people who are overweight\nkind of think well if only I was thin my\nlife would be really great it's that\nmagic pill yeah exactly and they lose\nthe weight and you know your husband's\nstill an [ __ ] and you still hate your\njob and I think there's also some I give\nan example of a really deep\npsychological issue that I think is\nsurfaced in some cases by these drugs\nand batric surgery something I learned\nabout from a a wonderful man who you\nshould have on actually um called Dr\nVincent\nfelitti it was really hard for me to\nlearn about this so Dr felitti was a\ndoctor in San Diego in the early\n1980s and he was approached by kaisa\nPermanente the big not for-profit\nMediCal provider in California\nand they said look we got a problem we\ndon't know what to do please help us the\nproblem they had was that obesity was\nhugely rising in fact it was very low by\nour standards but it was rising and they\nsaid look nothing we do works we give\npeople you know diet plans we give them\npersonal trainers it's not working can\nwe give you a load of money and just do\nblue skies research figure out what the\nhell we should do so Dr Fel took the\nmoney and was like oh what can I do so\nhe started working with 200 severely\nobese people people who weigh more than\n£300 and had for a long time and it's\nlike what could I do and he had an idea\nthat sounds and in fact is kind of dumb\nhe said what would happen if really\nobese people literally stopped eating\nand we gave them like you know vitamin C\nshots so they didn't get scurvy or\nwhatever would they just burn through\nthe fat supplies in their body and get\ndown to a healthy weight so with a ton\nof medical supervision they did it and\nIncredibly at first it worked there was\na woman corsan not her real name who\nwent down from being more than 400 lb to\n138 lb staggering\ntransformation and you know her family\nare calling the doctor and saying you\nsaved her life she's\nthrilled and then one day um she cracked\nshe went to KFC or I think that's\nprojection she went somewhere and you\nknow started hugely overeating again and\nquite quickly got back to a a dangerous\nway and Dr futi called her in he said\nSusan what happened what happened and\nshe looked down she was really ashamed\nshe said I don't know I don't know he\nsaid well\nwell tell me about the day you cracked\ndid anything in particular happen that\nday that didn't happen some other day it\nturned out something had happened that\nday that had never happened to Susan she\nwas in a bar and a man hit on her not in\na nasty way in a nice way and she felt\ncompletely freaked out and went and\nstarted eating that's when Dr feli asked\nher something he'd never thought to ask\nher before he said Susan when did you\ngain your weight and her case it was\nwhen she was 11 he said well did\nanything happen when you were 11 that\ndidn't happen when you were nine or when\nyou were 14 anything in particular\nhappened that that\nyear and she looked down and she said\nwell that's where my grandfather started\nraping\nme Dr feli interviewed everyone in the\nprogram he discovered that 60% of the\nwomen had made their extreme weight gain\nin the aftermath of being sexually\nabused or assaulted and at first he was\nlike what's going on it doesn't make any\nsense and Susan explained it to him\nreally well she said overweight is\noverlooked and that's what I need to be\nright clearly obesity for\nwomen has a protective sexual function\nyou are somewhat it can still happen of\ncourse but you are less likely to be\nsexually assaulted if you gain a lot of\nweight and so for Susan losing a huge\namount of weight made her really\nfrightened and feel really vulnerable\nand brought her back to that terrified\nplace of abuse now there's lots of\npsychological things that go on that's\nonly one of many but I think and of\ncourse it can give you an opportunity to\ndeal with those feelings\nright but again it gives you a sense of\nlike the the the incredible\npsychological complexity of what's\nreally going on here can kind of come to\nthe surface in complicated ways yeah and\nwhat's interesting about that is no\nmatter what the\npsychological reason may be you're\nalmost dealing with that feeling for the\nfirst time in three or four decades so\nit almost feels like a new feeling would\nthat be fair enough to say it almost\nfeels like what I mean by that is there\nare certain feelings and thoughts that\nwe've had since we were young and we\nfound ways to cope with them but if this\nis something that you've been able to\nkind of put aside for 10 20 30 years and\nall of a sudden now that this is\nblocking something which is giving rise\nto that it almost feels like wow I\nhaven't learned how to deal with this\nfor a long time I think that's really\nright I think it's I think you're right\nit's even worse than a new feeling it's\na buried feeling right and obesity is so\nLaden\nwith shame\nand the cruelty in this culture towards\nyou know which I've experienced to some\ndegree but women get it much much worse\nif you have a BMI higher than 35 and\nyou're a woman 42% of those women get\ninsulted literally every day right and I\nreally wanted to think this through\nbecause I was very conscious that we've\nmade so much progress in this\nculture I mean we were nowhere near\nwhere we need to be but we've made some\nprogress I think about this and one of\nthe things I really worry about in\nrelation to these\ndrugs I think it's really distilled in a\nmoment probably the worst moment in the\nwhole writing of the book for me so I've\ngot a niece called Erin who's 19 now but\nin my head she's fixed as a six-year-old\nlike uh she's the baby of my family\nshe's the only girl she's the youngest\nof my brothers and sisters children but\none day I was um FaceTiming with her\nafter been taking the drug for a while\nand she was sort of praising me in a\nteasing way she was like oh I never knew\nyou had a jaw yo I never knew you had a\nneck and I was kind of preining and then\nshe looked down and she said will you\nbuy me some oen\npiic and I laughed because I thought she\nwas kidding\nand I realized she wasn't and she's like\na perfectly healthy weight she always\nhas\nbeen and I\nthought I've undone all the messages\nI've ever tried to give her\nright about valuing yourself about and I\nthought you know she's grown up seeing a\nbroader range of body types and female\ncelebrities than we ever grew up with of\ncourse you and now all of those women\npretty much are bone thin right and I\nreally wanted to think this through\nbecause I think this there's of two\ncategories here which are quite\ndifferent there's overweight and obese\npeople who are taking these drugs to get\ndown to a healthy weight right now\nthey're still incurring the 12 big risks\nthat I write about in Magic pill there's\nstill a lot to discuss there but I think\nthere's a a lot to defend there then\nyou've got people who were already a\nhealthy weight or indeed skinny who are\ntaking them to be super skinny now I\ndon't judge those people we live in a\nculture that makes women feel [ __ ] about\ntheir bodies whatever they do and there\nare tremendous pressures on them and I I\ndon't judge where those women are coming\nfrom at\nall but they're incurring all the physic\nall the 12 risks for none of the\nbenefits right I mean well rather for\naesthetic benefits but not health\nbenefits and in fact they're endangering\ntheir own health um in all sorts of\ncomplicated ways to give an obvious\nexample as you age you naturally lose\nmuscle mass muscle mass is the total\namount of soft tissue in your body that\nyou need to like get out of a chair walk\nthe walk up the stairs whatever it might\nbe so as you age you naturally lose\nmuscle mass from the age 30 depressingly\num so if you're going into the aging\nprocess already with quite low muscle\nmass which people have taken the drugs\nto be super skinny likely will be it\ncould cause you real problems when\nyou're older you know you'll be much\nless mobile you'll find it harder to\nwalk up the stairs you're at risk of a\ncondition called sarcopenia which means\nPoverty of the flesh it's where\nbasically you just can't do much because\nyou're quite physically weak so I think\nwe've got to distinguish between those\ntwo things and then we've got to think\nabout also what this means for body\npositivity and how we think about in\nrelation that was a particular person\nwho helped me to think about that I\ncould tell her tell you a bit about her\nif you like yeah please please please so\nthis woman you probably remember her Jay\nbecause we're from the same place um so\nwhen we were kids you only ever saw fat\npeople on television as the butt of a\njoke right particularly overweight women\nright it was vicious and the first\nperson I ever saw challenge that I\nremember it blew my mind it was on\nkillroy which people don't know it's\nlike a if you imagine a kind of Dollar\nStore version of Ricky Lake right the\nfirst person I ever saw challeng it was\nthis woman called Shelley bovie who\nbasically introduced body positivity to\nBritain she was the first person to ever\ntalk about this and write about it in\nBritain in a on a big public stage so I\nwent and track her down because I really\nwant to think this through with her\nshe's 76 now and her story I think\nreally helps us to Think Through the\ncomplexity of this so she grew up in a\num a kind of Big workingclass Town in\nBritain called Port talber I guess the\nequivalent in the US would be like\nScranton she was as she would put it the\nonly fat girl at her school this was the\n1960s and one day after class her\nteacher said to her bie stay behind I\nneed to talk to you so she's sort of\nsitting there thinking hey what did I do\nand she goes up to the teacher and the\nteacher said you're much too fat it's\ndisgusting go see the school nurse\nshe'll sort you out so completely thrown\nshe goes to see the school nurse and the\nnurse says why are you here she said\nwell the teacher says I'm too fat and\nthe nurse said take off your clothes I'm\ngoing to look at you and the nurse\nlooked at her and said ah disgusting too\nfat and just berated her said you're\ngreedy you're a pig eat less and shell\ncompletely thrown kind of leaves she was\nget soaking up this kind of abuse the\nwhole time right girls were constantly\nsaying to her thank God I don't look\nlike\nyou and really her whole life she psych\nthis abuse when she got pregnant she\nwent to the doctor first thing the\ndoctor said was shouldn't be pregnant\nwhen you're as fat as you are uh when\nshe gave birth she had a very painful\nbirth difficult birth she's lying there\ncovered in blood and the Midwife said to\nher you know you really need to lose\nsome weight um when her her baby\nwouldn't attach he wasn't feeding\nproperly she went to the doctor the\ndoctor said what are you trying to do\nmake the baby as fat as you\nare overweight and obese people are\nsoaking this up all the time and most of\nthem just internalize it shell told me\nshe had never looked at her body naked\neven in the shower she would sort of\nwash herself but not look because she\nfelt such hatred for her own body and\none day she learned in the US there was\nthis movement which at the time called\nitself fat Pride there's still some\npeople who use that term now we would\nprobably call it more body\npositivity who just said why are we\ntaking it this is like this is just\ncruelty this is like racism or\nhomophobia or sexism just no we're not\ngoing to be talk treated like this\nyou're not going to get to talk to us\nlike that and so she wrote the first\never book advocating for body positivity\nstill stands up now brilliant book\ncalled The Forbidden\nbody in which she argued against this\nstigma and when I track Shelly down she\nstressed to me she's really proud of\neverything she said about stigma and I\nthink she's 100% right B stigma a is\njust a form of bullying and B makes the\nproblem much worse right um Lindy West\nis a brilliant body positivity Advocate\nsaid people don't take good care of a\nthing they hate if you make people hate\ntheir bodies it doesn't make them take\nbetter care of\nthem but something happened to Shell\nnext I think if we're going to\nbe truthful and compassionate we have to\ntalk about shell was very overweight she\nwas not yet 50 and she was losing the\nability to walk\nand so she had to be in a wheelchair and\nshe went to a doctor and her doctor said\nwell because of your weight because of\nthe strain that's putting you you've got\nproblems with your\nheart and Shel felt this profound\ndilemma because she was so proud of\neverything she said about stigma At\nfirst she thought well I want to talk\nabout these health challenges but is\nthis contradictory there was at the time\na a newsletter in Britain called fat\nnews which is like a body positivity\nnewsletter and she wanted to write about\nthis and they said no no that's not what\nwe want we we're here to tell the\npositive news and he said but don't if\nwe love ourselves don't we want to tell\nthe whole\ntruth and she felt really conflicted\nabout this and for a long time she felt\nlike it was either or either you're\nagainst stigma or you're in favor of\nreducing obesity where you can but you\nknow she then and she's the first to\nacknowledge this is extremely hard to do\nbut she lost a lot of weight through\ndieting she went from being unable to\nwalk to being able to run um her health\nmassively improved her heart problems\nwent away which tends to happen when you\nreverse obesity like when we talked\nabout with the bariatric surgery\nand shell I thought put it to me in a\nreally wise way she said it's not either\nor it's both and if you love someone\nwho's obese as everyone watching will\nI'm pretty sure you want to protect them\nfrom two things you want to protect them\nfrom cruelty and\nbullying and you want to protect them if\nyou possibly can from the more than 200\ndiseases and health complications that\nare made much more likely by being\noverweight or obese and I was kind of\nshocked when I you know I looked at at\nthe science of this with an open mind\nI'm very happy to challenge scientific\nconsensus I've done it before in my\nprevious books but when you look at the\nscientific evidence and I was trained to\nassess scientific evidence at Cambridge\nUniversity I was kind of taken back by\nhow bad obesity is for your health on\naverage of course there are exceptions\nmy mother smokes 70 cigarettes a day\nshe's alive and well at the age of 78\nbut she's an outlier I mean even think\nabout something as simple as diabetes\nright I'm really embarrassed to say this\nbut I thought if you'd ask me a couple\nof years ago\nokay I knew that obesity makes diabetes\nmuch more likely if you're obese when\nyou're 18 you have a 70% chance of\nbecoming diabetic in your life but I\nthought okay that's not good but as long\nas you've got good health insurance and\nyou get di insulin you're basically like\neveryone else a diabetic with insulin is\nlike me or you that's not true at all\nwhen I interviewed the leading you know\ndoctors who are leading people who treat\ndiabetics when you look at the\nscientific evidence you know diabetes\nknocks 15 years off your life on average\nit's the biggest preventable cause of\nblindness in this country\nmore people have to have a limb or\nextremity amputated because of diabetes\nin the US than because they got shot and\nyou will have noticed a lot of us get\nshot right um in fact it's the effects\nare so bad that one of the leading\ndoctors in Britain who treats diabetics\nDr Max pton said to me if you gave me a\nchoice between becoming diabetic or\nbecoming HIV positive I would choose to\nbecome HIV positive because if you're\nHIV positive and you get treatment you\nlive as long as everyone else that is\nnot true of diabetics type two diabetics\nyou you you you have a shorter life and\nyou're much more likely to have a\nterrible last few years where you're\nblind or you horribly you know your body\nis mutilated um and I found that so\nfrightening to take on and I'm conscious\nthat loads of people hearing that will\nexperience that and is very painful it\nis extremely painful to hear and it's an\nextremely painful\ntruth and we have to communicate it with\ngreat compassion and love and not as\nconcern trolling or and I hate even\nsaying it because you can see how it\ngives\num ammunition to the bullies in a way\nbecause they use that as like oh babe\nI'm just worried about your health I get\nthat but shell really taught\nme yeah she put it we have to live in\nreality and we have to be as\ncompassionate as we can within that\nreality we have to do both right and I'm\nconscious this is a long answer but I'll\njust give an example one other person\nhelped me to think about this there's a\nbrilliant guy interview called Jeff\nParker he's a 67-year-old retired\nlighting engineer in San\nFrancisco and Jeff a couple of years ago\nwas very severely\noverweight he was finding it painful to\nwalk he had gout he had liver problems\nkidney problems he was taking fistfuls\nof pills every day and he started to\ntake munaro which is one of the new\nweight loss drugs and he lost a lot of\nweight all his health problems went into\nremission he was Doctor almost took him\noff the pills now he walks his dog over\nthe Golden Gate Bridge every day he said\nyou know I feel like I'm going to enjoy\nmy retirement now I don't think we can\nsay to someone like Jeff that that\nImprovement is not meaningful right\nthere are many maybe the risks of the\ndrugs will outweigh that benefit to him\nand for others that's a real possibility\nit's why I put a lot of weight on the 12\nwrists on of these drugs in the\nbook but I do think we have to\nacknowledge that a lot of people who do\nsuccessfully reverse their obesity which\nis much easier to do now than it's been\nbefore do experience a massive\nImprovement in the quality of their life\nI do think we're not being honest with\npeople if we don't explain that as well\nthank you for going into that actually\nit wasn't a it wasn't it was a very\nthoughtful answer and those\nstories give us an entryway into the\npsychology and the mind of so many of us\nand what we're all struggling with with\nShelly I'm intrigued how is she now\nperceived by her community that she was\nthe face for having now dieted lost\nweight it sounds like and may appear\ndifferent visually how is she now\nperceived and how does she feel about\nreconnecting with that community and\ntalking about it with them so as she\nwould say there's a and she speaks for\nherself much better than I can I don't\nwant to too much trilo quiser but uh\nshe's a very articulate person I think\nit's really complicated and I understand\nwhy it's\ncomplicated some people saw her as a\nsellout and I think Shell's attitude was\nwhat kind of body positivity would it be\nthat would shame me for keeping my body\nalive and there's a big division going\non now my body positivity\nAdvocates where they have many good\narguments and it's worth stressing so if\nwe we think about the history of diet\ndrugs think about the 70s right one of\nthe things that one of the first things\nthe fat Pride movement did was point out\nso there were diet drugs in the 70s that\nwere amphetamines right they hugely\npopular there were staggering figures\nlike more than 10 million amphetamin\nprescriptions were written in 1970 in\nthis country for weight loss right um\nand it turns out taking LS of speed to\nlose weight not a good idea who knew but\nuh and they had to be taken off the\nmarket because it it screws you up right\npartly because you develop tolerance to\nthe drugs you have to take higher and\nhigher doses to get the same effect and\nif you're taking really high doses of\nspeed as anyone who knows any\nrecreational drug users will know don't\nend so well for you um uh you know\nskinny but psychotic is not a great\ntrade-off maybe for some people it is\nbut uh not for me and so a lot of the\nfat Pride movement very preent warned at\nthe time you know this is really going\nto screw people up don't do it right and\nthey've been entirely Vindicated by that\nand it may be and I I think there's a\nsignificant chance of this I don't think\nit's\nthe most likely option but I do think\nit's a significant chance that they'll\nbe Vindicated on these drugs as well\ngoing look this is a big risk right for\nme especially with the history of my own\nfamily what I felt I had to do was weigh\ntwo\nrisks and I think that's what most\npeople watching and listening will will\nthis will be the position they're\nin realistically I was going to remain\nobese I tried dieting many times I\nalways ended up fatter than I was at at\nthe start I tried insane and intense\ndiets I'd gone to diet camps in Austria\nwhere they give you tea for a week i'\ndone i' done it all right realistically\nI was going to carry on being obese to\nsome\nlevel so for me the choice\nwas what are the risks of continuing to\nbe obese versus what are the risks of\nthese drugs that is not an easy\ncalculation there's a lot we don't know\nuh there's we're learning more and more\nthere's a lot of detail in the book that\nI think people don't know\nabout it's a hard calculation and I\ndon't know if I've made the right choice\nfor myself so it may well be there's a\nsignificant chance that they will that\ntheir caution about this will be\nVindicated and they're right that\nthey're also right to say it's clearly\nnot the case that we're only taking this\nto deal with health problems right and\nthat's true to me as well there's a\nsignificant amount of just relief from\nthe stigma of being fat vanity I like\nbeing thinner right because of the\nculture we live in some of that is the\nhealth benefits and the risk to my heart\nof course but some of that isn't a big\npart of it isn't we've got a level with\npeople about that so it's possible that\nthey'll they'll be Vindicated and even\nif they\naren't we've really got to understand\nwhere it comes from if you are soaking\nup abuse your whole life that cruelty\nthat\nbullying I totally get you know that's\nan analogy I always think of which is\nI'm gay the height of the age crisis\nwhen doctors explain to gay\nmen\nlook because of the nature of anal sex\nand because gay men tend to have a lot\nmore sexual partners than other sexual\ncombinations this is going to affect gay\nmen much worse than other communities so\nthey wanted to you know shut down the\nbath houses in San Francisco really warn\npeople say while we don't know you\nshouldn't have sex right and a lot of\ngay men were like our whole lives we've\nbeen told our sexuality is disgusting\nwe're diseased we're evil and now you\ncome along and tell us this as well\nwe're going to carry on going to the\nbath houses we're going to carry on and\nI get where they're coming from I might\nwell have been like that myself at the\ntime but now we realize looking back\nwell you have to separate the stigma\nfrom the scientific advice right there\nwas I'm sure there were lots of\nhomophobes picking up those arguments\nand bullying gay people exactly but\nequally there was the scientific reality\nwhich is it was much more likely to\naffect gay people and lots of those\npeople who refus that advice tragically\nare not here now because they refused it\nso I think and that doesn't mean I stand\nover those people and go what fools I I\ntotally get it but I do think we have to\nas shell says we have to separate out\ntwo things we have to separate out the\nstigmatizing cruel things that are said\nfrom things that are just physical think\nabout think about cancer right the\nleading cancer group in Europe cancer\nresearch UK explain if you carry excess\nweight in your body it doesn't just sit\nthere it's not iner it's active right it\nsends signals through your body\nand one of those signals is for your\ncells to divide more rapidly which can\ncause cancer this is why obesity is one\nof the biggest causes of cancer in in\nthe developed world right that's true\neven if we got rid of all the stigma in\nthe world which we passionately should\nfight to do it's still going to make you\nmore likely to get cancer right we\ncan't that's not something we can undo\nwith an argument and therefore we do\nneed to think about this also though I'm\nvery conscious the most important thing\nwe got to do so people like me are in a\nshitty trap right you got to choose\nrisky medical condition risky\ndrug but that is not inevitable and we\nshould not tolerate that being the\nchoice for our children right Japan for\nexample right um I can explain how they\ndid it but the key thing to understand\nis the way one expert put it for me a\nbrilliant man named Professor Michael\nlow at Drexel University in Philly is\nprocessed and ultr processed feeds dug\nthis hole they stole our sociiety and\nthe drugs fill it in the way he put it\nwas so you got to see that these drugs\nare an artificial solution to an\nartificial problem right so we've got to\npull back in addition to the Dilemma\nabout the drugs for people like me we've\ngot to pull back and go how did we get\nhere and how do we make sure the next\ngeneration of kids are not in that\nposition and absolutely we this is the\nDilemma a lot of us but it doesn't have\nto be the Dilemma for our children and\ngrandchildren and I went to places that\nhave solved this dilemma that show us\nthe way out so that's the kind of\nbroader argument which I think is so\nimportant to stress as well yeah\nabsolutely before we get to Japan and\nbefore we get to those\nso the barley Bank produced a report to\nguide investors and it told them to get\nout of investing in fast food and ice\ncream because those markets are going to\ntank financial advisers are also\nexpecting a decline in the demand for\nneon hip replacement but when you look\nat investment I found that\nfascinating I'm like do I believe that\nfast food is growing or is shrinking and\nwhile I see the rise of organic\nvegetables while I see but still\nexpensive while I see the rise in people\nproposing a largely plant-based diet if\nnot not not full but a larger\nplant-based diet again more expensive\nharder to access maybe maybe difficult\nto know what to do I I don't see fast\nfood shrinking as an industry is did you\nsee that are you seeing that through\nyour research were you seeing investment\nshift and redirect or is that a myth as\nwell crispy K cream stock is down the\nhead of nestle Mark Schneider has been\nmaking very nervous noises about their\nice scam and confectionary market so we\ngot to look at the the longer term Trend\n47% of Americans say they want to take\nthese drugs and the there's a big access\nquestion at the moment but eight years\nfrom now OIC goes out of patent at that\npoint it will be a daily pill and it\nwill cost about a dollar a day I would\nanticipate 47% is an underestimate for\nhow how how many people will take it\nprovided some of the 12 big risks that I\nwrite about in the book don't blow up\nwhich is a real problem think about Jeff\nParker the guy I just talked about in\nSan Francisco\neveryone like Jeff becomes a walking\nadvertisement for the drug every goes\nwhat happened to Jeff he looks\ncompletely different my God he's so much\nhealthier so you can see how it creates\na huge growth growth effect so you're\nright at the moment we've got two Trends\nwe've got the ongoing explosion of fast\nfood which is you know blowing up and\nblowing up and is implanted in us from\nthe moment we're born more\nthree-year-old children in this country\nknow what the McDonald's m means they\nknow their own last name more people\nyeah more people in the world recognize\nthe McDonald's M as a symbol of\nMcDonald's then recognize the cross as a\nsymbol of Christianity right so this is\nreally deep in our Consciousness so\nyou've got that huge explosion in fast\nfood which is growing and growing and\ngrowing and you've got huge numbers of\npeople who want to take these drugs now\none of those Trends is going to win\nright so as more and more people take\nthe drugs we''re already seeing the\neffects and I think in a way the best\nsome of the best predictors are the\nfinancial markets jeffre Financial just\ndid a big report for the US Airlines\nsaying you're going to have to spend a\nlot less money on jet fuel pretty soon\nbecause a lighter population takes less\njet fuel to fly there's um even just\nlike crazy little things there's been a\nhuge run on Jewelers in Los Angeles um\nbecause people's fingers have shrunk so\nmuch that they need their wedding bands\nrefitted or think about you mentioned\nthe hip and knee Replacements companies\nthat manufacture KNE and hip\nreplacements the joints for them their\nstock is going down because the main\ndriver of KNE and hip replacements is\nobesity and if there's a lot less\nobesity there's going to be a lot fewer\nKN and HIIT replacement operations so do\nthink we're we're you're right that the\ntrend you're seeing which is the growth\nof fast food which earning more and more\nI mean thank God when I was a child you\ncouldn't just push a button on a device\nand theyd bring McDonald's to you right\nyou have to actually leave your house at\nleast um imagine how overw that would\nhave become if that been the case that\ntrend is is driving the other Trend as\nwell right so they're they're they're\ndensely interconnected it's also a big\nquestion comes out as and like you kept\nsaying like you keep saying we don't\nknow enough and I want to talk about the\nrisks now because we've talked about\nsome of how we've got here the\nchallenges that we're facing mentally\npsychologically societally into why\nwe're in this situation in the first\nplace but what's fascinating to me\nis are a lot of the 12 Big 12 which we I\nwant to dive into the Big 12 risks and\nthe issues with the drugs are a lot of\nthem more long-term than shortterm and\nbased on your own personal experience\nare the short-term ones tolerable in the\nlongterm ones the ones that we would\nconsider intolerable and complicated so\nI would distinguish between the\nwell-known side effects and these 12 big\nrisks things like nausea almost everyone\nwho takes these drugs feels nauseous at\nfirst throughout the day no different\npeople have different experiences so\nsome people have horrible experiences I\ninterviewed someone called Sunny Newton\nin Vermont who um you know she had like\nshe said it was like there was an alien\nliving inside her and it was like\nthrashing about and she just wanted to\nvomit the whole time that's rare but not\nunheard of I mean in the clinical trial\nit's about 5% of people did just stop\nbecause the nausea was so bad for\nme it was like um it was mild it was\nlike when I would get on the bus or\nsomething I would get a little bit of\nexaggerated travel sickness um but like\nif I'd got that feeling just randomly on\na normal day it wouldn't have stopped me\ngoing about my day it just would have\nbeen a bit\nunpleasant and after a few months um you\ngenerally you get it worse the day you\ntake it or the day after and then you're\nokay for the rest of the week and then\nagain you inject yourself and it gets\nand and the\nregularity of injecting yourself is it\nthe same for everyone or can you\naccelerate the dose is there a slower\nversion I mean I should just say because\na lot of people get horrified by\ninjection and I am a complete wor I'm\nthe kind of person who when you give me\na blood test I like I don't want to look\nat it I literally look away and sing\nlike you know do Casey Perry songs to\npretend it's not happening but um and my\nsinging is not pleasant um but this it's\nan EpiPen it's the tiny and I wish\nsomeone had told me at the start I\ndidn't know this at first you can inject\nyourself in the leg or the stomach and\nfor some reason the idea of injecting in\nyour stomach seems to be so horrifying\nfor the first month I was injecting in\nmy stomach I was like a and actually the\nleg is just the same no I mean it's you\nit's literally like the tiniest scratch\nit's like a mosquito bite it's but are\nthere different doses in terms so\neveryone starts at 0.25 milligrams is to\nget you used to the nausea and the\neffect is quite mild and most people go\nup and up and up so generally you go up\nto 1 milligram you can go as high as 2.4\nmilligrams it would depend on your level\nof obesity I think a lot of people are\non too higher dose and who's advising\nyou on that dose I mean the official\nguidance from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lily\nthe companies that own it is is you know\nbuild up to one milligram and then you\ncan go higher if you need greater\neffects but because you're\nself-medicating you're not\nself-medicating you I mean part of the\nproblem is people are buying it online\nand not actually getting it from a\ndoctor and that's a really big problem\nthat particularly relates to probably my\nsingle biggest worry about these drugs\nthere's a lot but the thing I'm most\nconcerned about\nnot for myself but for the society is\neating disorders we went into the\npandemic with an unprecedentedly high\nlevel of Eating Disorders probably\nbecause of social media and what it's\ndoing to young girls you'll interview my\nfriend Jonathan he high he can tell you\nmuch more about that and everyone should\nread His Brilliant amazing work then\nduring the pandemic eating sers went up\neven further which is\nmind-blowing and what these drugs do is\nthey give you an unprecedented tool to\namputate your appetite right and anyone\nwho knows anyone who's got Eating\nDisorders imagine I'm sure do pretty\nmuch everyone\ndoes they're in a conflict there's the\npsychological part of them that wants to\nstarve themselves for complex\nreasons created by the Sick culture we\nhave\nmostly and then there's the biological\npart of them that wants to live and\nwants to eat and what these drugs do is\nthey you know if you take them and\nyou're you're in that position they\nmassively empower the part of you that\nwants to starve yourself so I am and\npeople like Dr kimbery Dennis who's one\nof the leading Eating Disorders experts\nin Britain another person you should\ninterview very WID and Brilliant\nperson are really worried about this\nright my my biggest fear is that we\ncould have an opioid like death toll of\nhuge numbers of young girls and\nunfortunately these disorders do mostly\naffect young girls there are of course\nsome young men and\nboys I mean I'm really really worried\nabout that now there are things we could\ndo right now as Dr Dennis says we need\nto I I got them on Zoom you know when I\nwhen I got them in Britain initially in\nin Vegas I had to go in person they're\nmeant to check your BMI on Zoom I mean\ngood luck with that you basically you\nare very visibly not eligible for these\ndrugs right you clearly have a BMI lower\nthan 27 and yet I have no doubt you\ncould go on Zoom literally your lovely\nteam here could arrange in half an hour\nwe get a zoom call and you would get it\ndelivered in the you know biked over to\nyou today right we need to stop that as\nDr Dennis says we should only have\nin-person\nprescription and the inperson\nprescription should be done by doctors\nwho are given clear guidance about how\nto spot eating disorders and how to\nprevent uh the prescription of these\nthings to eating disorders it's not\nperfect people might still buy it online\nbut it would it would put at least some\nbarrier that between these drugs and\npeople who should not be getting them at\nthe moment there is basically no barrier\nis that one of the big risks yeah\nmassive I mean if you said to me what\nare the risks that most that's the risk\nthat most worries me for the society the\none that most worries me for myself is\nquite different\nso how would I put it it's weird I feel\na away of anxiety as I said\nit we don't know the long-term effects\nof these drugs at all no one knows we\nknow they're chronically activating key\nparts of your brain so a brilliant\nexpert called Dr Greg Stanwood who works\non these drugs at uh Florida State\nUniversity said to me now he stressed to\nme he's broadly in favor of these\ndrugs he's considering taking them\nhimself but as a responsible scientist\nhe has to warn people so he gave an\nanalogy I want to be clear he's not\nsuggesting these drugs will have this\neffect but it's an analogy that helps us\nto think about it if you look at\nantipsychotic drugs if you go back to\nwhen they were first given to people in\nthe late\n1950s at the time doctors judged that\nthe benefits outweigh the risk it's\nalways been controversial but they judge\nthat so loads of people were given antic\npsychotics for really long periods of\ntime and it was only what 40 50 years\nlater that they discovered if you take\nthese drugs for decade after decade you\nare much more likely to get dementia\nAlzheimer's in fact all forms of\ndementia are much more likely it's not\nthat the doctors were being neglen in\nthe 1950s you how you couldn't know that\nright you had to have people take it for\na really long time to know\nthat what could these drugs do over the\nlong term we don't know right um now\nagainst that Dr sha aliv a brilliant\nobesity specialist at tillan school\ntillan University School of Medicine in\nNew Orleans said to me me well look we\ndon't know the long-term effects of\nthese drugs we do know the long-term\neffects of obesity and they are very\nserious but you know I'm 45 right if you\nstop taking the drugs for almost\neveryone they stop you just go back to\nwhere you were before and there's big\ndebate about that but for most people\nthat seems to be\nhappening so I'm assuming I'm going to\nbe taking these drugs for 40\nyears that's anxiety provoking I asked\nDr clemon blue who's a one of the\nleading obesity specialists at Cambridge\nUniversity so what brain areas do these\ndrugs activate and she T me through it\nthe H brain and so on I saidwell what\nelse do those areas of the brain do she\nsaid oh are they memory processing taste\nprocessing gut motility like not this me\nspeaking now but not trivial things\nright so for me that was of the 12 that\nwas the one where I\nthought\n[ __ ] trying to more eloquent way to say\n[ __ ] but that was yeah yeah what's the\ndebate you were saying there about the\nidea of if you stop taking these drugs\nyou go back to the same way you were\nwhat's the debate so we don't have that\nmuch research on it what the drug\ncompanies say is these drugs are like uh\nstatins you take statins it lowers your\ncholesterol if you stop taking statins\nyour cholesterol goes back to what it\nwas so the drugs are not a cure they're\na treatment an ongoing treatment right\nso they say these drugs are like that\nnow they have a vested interest in\nsaying that they want you to carry on\nbuying the drugs forever it would not be\ngood news for them if they discovered\nthat actually you can take the drugs for\na short time stop and then you'd stay at\nthe lower weight some people this is\nanecdotal because we don't have any\nresearch on it yet other people are\nstudying it so we'll know in a\nwhile like I give an example someone I\nknow took manaro lost Lo of weight\ninterrupted their relationship with junk\nfood started exercising a lot in a way\nthey felt too embarrassed to do when\nthey were obese and has now stopped and\nseems to be maintaining that lower\nweight\nso how many people will there be like\nthat we don't know I mean the early\nstudies we have we're just looking at if\nyou take and then stop but what about\nmotivated people who change use it as a\ntool to promote change we just don't\nknow how long will it how long does it\ntake to measure for us to realize how\nlong do you need to be on it for to have\nthose long-term implications like how\nlong will we have to study research and\nmeasure I mean when you talk about the\nthe the medium term\neffects and I gu it's important to be\nbalanced about this because it's a\ncomplicated truth so a lot of people a\nlot of the experts will say and these\nare really good scientists and it's a\ngood point actually we know loads about\nthe medium-term effects of these drugs\nbecause diabetics have been taking them\nfor 18 nearly 19 years right so for\npeople who don't\nknow these drugs in addition to having\nthis effect on your appetite also\nstimulate the creation of insulin which\nis what diabetics both type 1 and type\ntwo diabetics are lacking is why it's a\ndiabetes\ntreatment and so actually we've got 18\nyears of data on diabetics so there I\nmean this I'm putting it more crudely\nthan they would but if the drugs made\nyou grow horns the diabetics would have\ngrown horns by now right\nand that's a good and important point\nand it should give people some degree of\nsecurity but some other people say some\nother leading experts\nsay well hang\non if we're going to base a lot of our\nconfidence on these drugs on the\ndiabetics let's dig a bit deeper into\nthe diabetics so give an example there's\na brilliant scientist called Professor\nJean Luke F who's at the University\nHospital in melier in France and he was\ncommissioned by the French medicines\nagency to look at the safety of these\ndrugs for the French market\nand so he started looking at What's\ncalled the preclinical research which is\non\nanimals and something really took him AB\nwhich is if you give these drugs to rats\nthey're much more likely to get thyroid\ncancer and it's like huh okay let's do\nsome digging so what he did is they have\nvery very good medical databases in\nFrance he compared a large number of\ndiabetics who've been taking these drugs\nbetween I think 2006 and 2012 with a\nlarge number of diabetics who were\nsimilar in every other way but hadn't\ntaken these drugs and what he calculated\nwith his colleagues was if he's right\nand it's highly contested these drugs\nincrease your thyroid cancer risk by\nbetween 50 to 75% and he said to me well\nyou got to understand what it doesn't\nmean doesn't mean if you take the drugs\nyou have a 50 to 75% chance of getting\nthyroid cancer if that was the case we'd\nbe having bonfires of OIC all over the\nworld what it means is if he's right\nwhatever your thyroid cancer risk was at\nthe start these drugs increase it by 50\nto 75%\nnow thyroid cancer is an overall low\nrisk 1.2% of people get it in their\nlives 82% of them survive so it's a\nrelative but it's a big increase in a\nsmall risk right and I'm very\nconscious a that you got to weigh that\nagainst just the cancer risk of\ncontinuing to be obese but also one of\nthe things that really worries me about\nthat is if you think about the history\nof diet\ndrugs very often they began to unravel\nbased on small warnings so if you think\nabout there was a diet drug in the '90s\ncalled fenfen the most popular diet drug\never before asmic so if you look at how\nit was a combination of two drugs it was\nan appetite suppressant called flex\nfomine and um an amphetamine called\nphentramine and it really worked people\nwho took it got the same level of weight\nloss as people get on his zic and people\ntalked about it in a very similar way\nfront page of Time Magazine was the new\nMiracle weight loss drug right very\nsimilar in 1995 there were million\nfenfen prescriptions in this country it\nwas\nhuge and then it was\ndiscovered a a small group of doctors in\na in a practice in Fargo in North Dakota\nnoticed hauh um a lot of people using\nthis drug in our practice seem to be uh\nhaving trouble breathing wow and so they\nraised what's called a safety signal it\nwas then investigated it turned out\nthese drugs caused in a lot of people\nsomething called primary pulmonary\nhypertension a horrific condition where\nthe blood vessels in your lungs contract\nand you can't breathe it it kills you or\nit can kill you if if not you're on\noxygen the rest of your life it's\nhorrendous so it obviously got withdrawn\nfrom the market led to the biggest um\npayout in the history of the\npharmaceutical industry 122 billion\nactually emerged the drug companies had\nknown about this risk all along you look\nat the stuff the drug companies you know\none of the leak doc one of the documents\nthat was presented at the civil case was\njust um someone saying\none of the people at the drug company\nsaying oh I'm I going to have to spend\nmy retirement writing check compensation\nchecks for silly fat women with lung who\ncan't breathe I mean horrendous right\nnow I want to stress Eli Lily and noo\nNordisk I'm very happy to criticize drug\ncompanies I do it a lot but they are not\nshyers like those people were they are\nreputable drug companies there's no\nreason to believe that they're like that\nbut I'm conscious that small things\ncould lead to the whole thing\nunraveling we need to be vigilant I'm\nalert to that um is why if you have\nthyroid cancer in your family I mean I\ngoing to say I recommend it don't really\nmatter why I recommend the FDA\nrecommends don't take the drugs it's not\na good idea um are there any others in\nthat line any oh loads yeah I mean yeah\nI mean I would there's all sorts of\nthings all sorts of categories of people\nI would say shouldn't take it um if your\nBMI is lower than 27 don't take it\nyou're incurring all the risks for none\nof the benefits if you have thyroid\ncancer in your family if you have\nhistory of eating\ndisorders you there's a whole array of\npeople who who should not be taking it\nwho who currently are taking it another\nbig one which obviously doesn't apply to\nme is if you think you might get\npregnant so one of the things that\nreally worries\nme is we have really no data on what it\ndoes to um people who are pregnant\nobviously you're told to not take it if\nyou think you might get pregnant but\npeople get pregnant and all sorts of\nways you know you don't that you don't\nexpect so we know rats when they're\ngiven sagte the active component are\nmuch more likely to have children with\nbirth deformities fetuses with birth\ndeformities Dr stanard Who I mentioned\nbefore at Florida State said to me again\nstressed he's broadly confident but has\nto alert people to potential concerns\nbecause he's a very responsible\nscientist he said to think about this\nyou might want to look\nat um the long-term research on mothers\nwho are exposed to contaminants when\nthey're pregnant so think about for\nexample mothers who are exposed to lead\nthis happens scandalously frequently in\nthis country because a lot of poor\npeople still live in housing that still\nhas lead in it and um still get water\nfrom we know about Flint Michigan but\nactually in lots of places get water\nfrom uh pipes that are made of lead it's\ninsane that in the richest country in\nthe world we allow that the poisoning of\nchildren but anyway if you look at the\nif you look at mothers who are pregnant\nand get exposed to lead during pregnancy\nactually their babies look like all the\nother babies there's no you it seems\nlike there's no difference but when\nthose kids get get to be 12 13 we know\nthat they have less impulse control\nthey're more likely to have attention\nproblem so it seems to have affected\ntheir developmental trajectory even\nthough that wasn't immediately obvious\nat first right could that happen with\nthese drugs yes I mean it might not it\nmight affect the trajectory in a\npositive way we don't know maybe they'll\nbe less likely to become obese it could\nhave a protective effect on that but\nit's just disturbing when you when you\nlook when you it's a really weird\nfeeling to go all around the world inter\nthese leading experts sit with them and\nto realize oh this is an experiment on\nmillions of people\nand I'm one of the guinea pigs [ __ ]\nright it's a weird feeling right and it\nmakes me angry that we've been put in\nthe position where we have to make these\nchoices like I say there are countries\nthat don't have to make these choices\nbecause they didn't allow their\npopulation to Beed up with process and\nUltra processed food in the first place\nand\nthat pissed me off yeah yeah what what\nhas been the most horrific asmic Story\nSo Far most horrific OIC story but I\ninterview people who' gone through rough\nexperiences there's a I'm going to this\nis very rare but there's a condition\ncalled pancreatitis which is\nexcruciatingly painful it's basically\nwhere your pancreas doesn't work\nproperly doctors compare the pain of\npancreatitis to being stabbed and it\nmakes you nine times more likely to get\npancreatitis these when you take these\ndrugs so pancreatitis is very rare but\nit's obviously a huge increase in this\nvery rare thing I interviewed a woman\ncalled Michelle Stak who uh lives in\nmytle Beach in South Carolina which is a\nplace I only thought existed in country\nsongs until I interviewed her and um\nMichelle said to me you know she went\nfor a zenic for weight loss the doctor\nsaid well this is rare side effects one\nof those pancreatitis she said no my Lu\nI'll probably get it and she started\ntaking it lost Lo away six weeks later\nshe went to visit her daughter in\nPittsburgh and um she woke up she said\nin the most excruciating Agony she'd\never been in she felt like she like she\nwas being stabbed all over her body and\nshe was rushed to hospital and they\nidentified pancreatitis and the first\nthing they said was are you an alcoholic\nshe said no then they said are you\ntaking a zic she was like yes um so that\nwas probably the P Michelle said to me\nyou know I've had children it was much\nworse than the pain of childbirth right\nso which thank God you and I will never\nhave to go through but um unless you got\nsomething you want to announce Jay but\nthe\num there's some real horror stories and\nmost people are not having these horror\nstories most people are having I want to\nbe responsible most people's experience\nis more like Jeff Parker or Oprah than\nit is\nlike you know Michelle yeah but that's\nnow mhm 20 years from now 30 years from\nnow 40 years from\nnow we don't know what the picture will\nbe which which puts us in this difficult\nposition so we've got some questions\nfrom the team that I wanted to refer to\nso team this is the team so what is your\nview on when AIC should be used for kids\nif at all for me the debate about AIC\nfor kids threw open the whole thing for\nme because for so many reasons because\nit's when you look at kids that you\nrealize how this is a crisis created by\nthe fast food industry right and by\nprocessed food industry and by the fact\nthat we as a society have allowed that\nindustry to poison our kids right think\nabout where we are in Brooklyn try\nwalking around Brooklyn with a kid and\nthem not seeing ads the whole time\nsaying you don't feel good hey stuff\nyour face with that [ __ ] right the first\nthing I want to say is this is a crisis\ncreated by them and we need to stop them\ndoing that and we can do that and I went\nto places that have done it but given\nthat's where we are I think people are\nin a really tough position because\nthere's so I'm very sympathetic to both\nsides of that debate so for example I\ninterviewed A really lovely woman called\nDeborah Tyler who's a nurse in\nConnecticut um her\ndaughter was very severely obese for\nwhen she was very\nyoung and um she took her daughter to\nthe doctor when I think she was eight\nand the doctor to said she had liver\nproblems and just like can you imagine\nwhen you you've been told your child has\nliver problems at the age of\neight and she faced this agonizing\ndecision about whether to put her\ndaughter on o\nzenic and in the end she decided to do\nit um and her daughter's liver problems\nhave gone away so I have a and and she's\nstill very agonized about it all the\nproblems are accentuated when it comes\nto children I mean there are benefits Dr\njles yo who's one of the leading experts\nat Cambridge University on Obesity\nexplained to me if you are obese when\nyou're a child it is very hard to become\nun obese I mean you're unusual\nright it happens you're proof of that\nthere are other people proof of it but\nmost people don't right it's really\npartly because as you become obese all\nsorts of changes happen in your brain\nthat make it very hard to go back that I\ngo through in the book so there's a case\nfor dealing with it early right and we\nknow childhood obesity I mean has really\ndevastating impacts on your health\nthroughout your life and radically\nshorten your life on average there are\nother people who have a lot of sympathy\nfor like Professor Dan Cooper who's at\nUC Irvine who say well a and I can't\nbelieve anyone would disagree with this\nwe need to deal with the underlying\ncauses but the environmental factors but\nB children are not miniature adults\nright this could affect children in\ndifferent ways for example one of one of\nthe things children use calories for is\nbone mineralization and if you don't\nhave enough calories maybe your bones\ndon't form properly maybe they'll get\nbecome osteoporotic as they get\nolder so it's really complicated Novo\nNordisk is currently doing a trial on\ngiving these drugs to children as young\nas six years old it turns my stomach\nit's a sign of a sick\nsociety that we've reached this point we\nneed to fix the society but if you're\ntrapped in the choice that Deborah Tyler\nis trapped\nin honestly I think I would probably do\nwhat she's done and I would feel as\nanguished as she does about it so this\ncame up with what you just mentioning\nnow like what is your view on uh Oprah\nasmic speci and what were the benefits\nand some of the challenges that came\nfrom it on people's perspectives so I\ncan't think dispassionately about Oprah\nright like I know everyone loves Oprah\nand a kind of oh we love Oprah Oprah is\none of the two or three humans alive who\nhas most influenced me like when I was a\nkid you remember this when we were kids\nremember it so vividly the Oprah show\nwould be on at 5:00 pm on Channel 4\nright and no one in Britain when we were\nkids spoke like Oprah right no one spoke\nabout them no one spoke about their\nemotions no one spoke about in this\nextraordinary and profound way that\nOprah does and I really think one of the\nreasons I get on well with Oprah I think\nis because I've I've so inter\ninternalized her voice that I sort of I\nmean clearly as a British person you\ncan't talk like Oprah but like well\nclearly no one can talk like Oprah but\nyou know what I mean like so I can't\nthink dispassionately about it because I\nlove her so much and I'm weirdly friends\nwith her um which is like still to me\nthe most surreal whenever she emails me\nor texts me and my friend I was like\nshut up everyone o needs us be quiet\nright but um I thought her special was\nincredible\num I cried a lot my for the minute it\nstarted I cried and my friend said Thank\nGod Oprah has not brought her show back\nbecause if you had this emotional\nreaction every day you'd be in a\npsychiatric hospital because just seeing\nOprah in front of an audience may be\nemotional but um I thought it was\namazing and I think part of it made me\nreally sad because you think about how\nmuch Oprah has given us right how much\nshe's given to the culture people forget\nyou\nknow I mean even just think about the\nincredible work she did on Breaking the\ntaboos around sexual abuse right where\nwhat she's done is incredible and I\ncould list like 15 things like that that\nOprah's done that have transformed the\nculture and you think all that time she\nwas doing that and Rising she was being\nbullied in the most hateful ways I\nreally recommend people watch and this\nis someone else who I admire and was a\ndamaged person so I don't want to say\nthis in a spirit of judgment but the you\ncan watch it on YouTube there's an\ninterview between Oprah and Joan Rivers\nfrom I think 1985\nand I'll preface this by saying a Joan\nRivers was the funniest comedian I've\never seen and B um Joan Rivers was\nsomeone who hated her own body and was\nat war with her own body so she's\nexternalizing something that's an\ninternal horrifying battle but it's\nviscerally shocking when you watch it\nnow she says to Oprah something like I\nhaven't watched it in a long time so I'm\ngoing to get the exact wording wrong but\nshe says something like you can't be\nthis fat you need to lose\nweight and and it's not said as a joke\nit's not framed as like I mean it' be be\nacceptable as a joke but it's not even\nframed as a\njoke and you can see Oprah just gets\nlooks really thrown and makes some joke\nabout herself because what else could\nshe do you think God that's the\ntonight's show she's they're on the\ntonight's show right that's because Jord\nwas the guest\nhost what how many people watch that 25\nmillion people that's being brutally\nshamed in front of 25 million people you\nthink Oprah's carrying that the whole\ntime she's torturing herself you know\nthat famous the famous image of her with\nthe you know the thing that represents\nas much f as she's lost and you think\nGod I feel so sad if you even if you're\nOprah you get tortured about it right it\njust you just realize so to see her\novercome that and see her looking so\nwell and to see her given a space beyond\nthat stigma I found incredibly moving\nbut that's tied up for me with so many\nother feelings about oo that I can't\nreally yeah you know no for sure and do\ndo you feel like some of that stigma is\nnow going the other way too right oh you\nlost weight because of OIC so then that\nstigma creeping in have you I think I\nthink what's happening is a complicated\nthing just like the drugs interrupt the\nway we eat and bring to the surface\nthese emotional feelings we didn't know\nwere\nthere I think culturally OIC is leeching\nout some deep underlying ideas about\nobesity so for example I'm I'm a feeling\nexperiencing them to myself when I was\ntaking the drug I kept thinking I'm\ncheating I'm doing something wrong think\nthat's really weird one of my best\nfriends tell statins right to lower his\ncholesterol I've never once thought\ncheating to get lower cholesterol than\nme you'd think I was crazy if I said\nthat right that's really weird what's\ngoing on here and I think it lies with\nlooked a lot into the history of obesity\nand how we talk and think about it so if\nyou look back in the sixth Century the\npope Pope Gregory the first was the\nfirst one to lay out the seven deadly\nsins and one of them is gluttony and\nit's always depicted with like some\nhugely fat person pigging out it's very\ndeep in our kind of psyches to think of\nobesity as a sin right and one of the\nways you know that is what are the forms\nof weight loss we admire there's\nbasically only one form it's and it\nfollows the classic Catholic pattern of\nlike the\nsinner you're a sinner you've got to be\ntormented you've got to go to through\nhell and purgatory and then we'll\nforgive you so think about that game\nshow the world uh is it called The\nBiggest Loser repulsive and wicked show\nin my view um but it's where people\nhaven't seen it people are very unwell\nvery seriously overweight are humiliated\nmade to take part in very extreme and in\nfact dangerous forms of exercise and\nstarve themselves and whoever loses the\nmost weight is the biggest loser and\ntherefore\nwins it's like oh yeah if you torture\nyourself and go through Agony then we'll\nforgive you for your sin then we'll go\nwell done good job Joe right but I think\none of the things that's weird with\nthose EMP is it's so easy right so it's\nlike I think a lot of people look at it\nand go well you haven't paid for your\nsin right you haven't suffered if you\nsuffer we might forgive you suffer with\nbariatric surgery just I also think it\nunderlies you think about cheating right\nin this culture which D which makes it\nso easy to be to overeat and be obese\nand so hard to be healthy lots of people\nare making daily sacrifices to not gain\nweight particularly women they're\nstarving themselves they're denying\nthemselves they're going hungry they're\ndoing extreme forms of exercise and I\nthink to them people like me must look a\nbit like Lance Armstrong looks to a\ncyclist it's what you you bastard I work\nso hard for this and you just inject\nyourself once in the Lego week and you\nget the same benefit as me screw you I\ncan see where that impulse comes from\nand I think we have to re I think we\nhave to acknowledge those feelings are\nthere they were there in me they there\nin everyone I think it's you can't live\nin this culture and not absorb those\nideas at some\nlevel but then we have to say well a I\ndon't think obese people are sinners I\nthink we're typical products of this\nenvironment\nand I'd hope we can move beyond the\nideas of a sixth century\npope but also in terms of being in a\nrace and competing against each other\nwell we are competing but it's not me\nagainst you it's all of us against the\nforces driving up obesity which are the\nprocessed food industry if we reframe it\nthat way we can get out look we live in\na as you know very well a toxic age\nwhere you know every conversation turns\ntoxic very quickly partly because of\nsocial media algorithms which prioritize\nnegativity all sorts of fact that are\ngoing\non if we want to have a non-toxic\nconversation about obesity and about\nasmic I think we've got to acknowledge\nthose ideas about Sin and cheating are\nthere and then we got to move Beyond\nthem well said well said yeah I wonder\nwhether you saw did you dive into any\nresearch on investors in fast foods and\nweight loss drugs did you find any\npatterns between I didn't but I'd be\nsurprised if and there was some\nreporting in the Washington Post which I\nonly read brief so I don't want to get\nit wrong but if I remember rightly I\nsuspect I don't know this but I suspect\nthe fast food industry will soon be\nfunding anti asmic propaganda just like\nthe um tobacco industry used to fund you\nknow claims that smoking isn't bad for\nyou did for years and years or like the\noil industry still funds claims that\nglobal warming isn't happening or is\nactually a good thing or you know I I\nwould be amazed if that isn't I mean\nthey're going to lose a lot of money and\nthey are some of the most profitable\ncompanies in the whole world so I'd be\nsuspect they're already doing it but I\ndon't know yeah yeah no it's an\ninteresting to think about because I\nfeel like we part of our part of the\nenvironment we all live in is somewhat\nof an illusion and ignorance of not\nunderstanding who's behind the narrative\nstorytelling you know when fast food\nfirst came around how did everyone not\ngo wait a minute this is going to ruin\nthe world like how did we not do that or\nwhen as you said we're trying to find\nartificial solutions to artificial\nproblems and now that we're living in an\nartificial world it's like well where\ndid we allow that to happen and I want\nto talk about Japan in that vein because\nthat was a place where you found that at\nleast tried to deal with this in a much\nhealthier smarter way this completely\nblew up have you been to Japan by way I\nso that's number one on my list right\nnow okay if there's one thing you take\naway from this conversation go to Japan\ngo to Japan it I expected it to be great\nand it massively exceeded my\nexpectations but it's completely amazing\nI'll give you a list of things to do but\nthe um so Japan is really important\nbecause some people say about these\ndrugs\nlook if a country gets to be rich people\nare going to have more food than they\ncan eat obesity is just inevitable right\nand therefore these drugs become\ninevitable but actually Japan is the\nthird richest country in the world in\nthe history of the world and now is the\nthird rich country in the world and they\nhave almost no obesity at all 42.5% of\nAmericans are obese it is 4% of people\nin Japan right there's almost no\nchildhood obesity in Japan I went to a\nschool in Tokyo typical middle class\nschool went several\nschools it's the weirdest thing walking\naround a school with a thousand children\nand they're being not one overweight\nchild anywhere it's it it's it's weird\nif you're used to going to British and\nAmerican schools so I wanted to\nunderstand how did Japan do it because I\nremember at first I read about you know\nAIC has been approved in Japan and there\nain't any sales because there's no one\nto take it right almost nobody it's a\ntiny tiny market for it and it's kind of\nweird that we expect Japanese people to\nlook like sumo wrestlers it would be\nlike expecting an American to look like\na bald eagle and at first I thought it\nmust just be that Japanese people won\nthe genetic Lottery right but that's not\ntrue we know that because um in the late\n19th century lots of Japanese people\nmoved to Hawaii I was just there and\nthey've been there ever since and\nJapanese Hawaiians are almost as\noverweight as other Hawaiians so and\nit's not that their genes suddenly\nmutated in 120 years since so something\nelse is going on right there's something\nin the environment that's that's driving\nup\nobesity in in our societies and hasn't\nin\nJapan and there's so many fascinating\nthings about this I went to a the most\nimportant to understand is Japan\ndeliberately created an environment in\nwhich it is hard to get fat and hard to\neat badly if you go back to the 1920s\nJapanese people had one of the worst\ndiets in the world they only ate protein\non average once a week right they they\nwere quite unwell they had poor life\nexpectancy and the Japanese government\nat the time deliberately transformed the\nsociet not for a good reason it's\nbecause they were they wanted to have an\narmy to go and invade the rest of Asia\nso we all got our motives for weight\nloss not the best one uh but you know\nwhatever it it worked right and they and\nand they deliberately created this new\nnew diet and this new way of being which\nis now continued in policy in Japan um\nso I went to a\nschool like I say in Tokyo to see how\nhow does it begin there's lots of layers\nat which they do this and uh I was\ngreeted at the door by a woman called\nharumi tati who's um the nutritionist at\nthis School COI school every school by\nlaw in Japan has to employ a\nprofessional nutritionist it's a\ndifficult qualification to get it's\nthree years on top of your teaching\nqualification your job is to design the\nfood that the kids eat by law the kids\ncan't bring pack lunches they have to\neat what's prepared there and they can\nonly that food has to be fresh prepared\non the day and have no processed\ningredients at all and then they use\nthis healthy food which has to contain\nall the food groups every day to educate\nthe kids about how to make their bodies\nhealthy so you know they're eating this\nfood and Japanese people love food it's\nnot a place where people will deny\nthemselves food they love it right so\nI'm with this group of kids they're\neating the school lunch which literally\nis more like something from noou than\nlike anything we ever ate at school\nright and um they're eating it and I say\nto these kids through my translator CH I\nsaid to these kids and never forget it\nthis the class I think of in particular\nthere were nine 10 year\nolds I said what's your favorite food\nthe first kid said broccoli I love\nbroccoli I was like okay little freak\nsaid to the next kid um what's your\nfavorite food she said white fish I said\nto the next kit and she said um oh\nboiled white rice and I turned to cheer\nand I said are these kids trolling me\nright their favorite foods are broccoli\nor what at CH like all Japanese people\ncould not understand why I was puzzled\nand said what do you mean we we teach\nour kids to eat healthy food don't you\ndo that and every food group they have\nthey have a rope a colored rope so they\nlike uh when they're eating the uh\ncalcium she holds up the white rope she\ngoes this is calcium what does it do and\nsomeone yells at it makes your bone\nstrong and she goes the red rope this is\ncarbs what do they do give you energy\nand she ties the ropes together in every\nlesson and that surrounded meal that you\nshould have in every meal right so they\nteach kids from a very young age how to\nnurture their bodies and I was with\nthese kids and I couldn't help res I\ncouldn't resist the temptation I pulled\nup on my phone videos of British and\nAmerican School meals and these kids\nreacted like I had shown them an Isis\nbeheading video they like screamed they\nwere like what have they said to me\nwhere are the vegetables I said there\nare no vegetables they where's the salad\nI said there is no salad they were just\ncomplet and one it was very touching one\nlittle girl put her hand on my shoulder\nand said I'm worried about you thought\nit was completely adorable right it\nbegins there and then all through the\nsociety there are measures taken to make\nprocessed food you can buy it if you\nwant to but it's very much a minority\nPursuit um it exists but it's a tiny\npart of the Japanese diet overwhelmingly\nthey eat fish fresh food vegetables most\npeople eat fresh food that's prepared on\nthe day and I think probably the most\nmoving conversation I had for the whole\nbook was in okanawa which is an\narchipelago of islands in the south of\nJapan where I really saw what you win if\nyou get this right so Japan has the\nlongest life expectancy in the world\nwomen live to be 88 men I think it's 82\nbut not just that they have the\nhealthiest lifespan in the world so the\naverage British person is in poor health\nI think it's 16 years before they die in\nJapan it's like a few years so it's a\nvery different relationship and so I\nwent to this place that sounds almost\nmythical it's called ogimi it's the\noldest village in the whole world it has\n215 houses and 192 have someone older\nthe age of older than the age of 90\nliving\nthere and I went there and I went to\nthey got this little Community\nCenter and the the first person I met\nthe first woman who walked through the\ndoor was a 102y old woman called Matsu\nfuchi who walked there on her own from\nher home down the hill and she said I\ncan't stay long because I'm looking\nafter my son who fell off the roof\nfixing it the other day I was like Jesus\nhow old is your son but okay um and we\nsat down and we\ntalked and she talked about how much she\nloved life it was volleyball season she'\nbeen watching her great grandchildren\nplay volleyball actually loved\nvolleyball you could see how much joy\nshe took in life talk to all the women\nand then someone put on some old um\nokanawa music and she put on a kimono\nand she started dancing and so I start\ndancing with this 102y old woman and I\nthought wow you were born before they\nstarted doing radio broadcasts in Japan\nand here I am dancing with you and\nrecording it on my iPhone that's what\nyou get if you solve obesity you don't\nget destroyed clearly not everyone will\nlive to be 102 but you you don't get\nyour knees destroyed and your heart\ndestroyed and your you know you get to\nlive and you get more years of joy and\nmore years of laughter and more years of\ndancing that's what we get if we solve\nthis this crisis and it is within our\ngrasp to solve it these drugs are one\ntool they are a difficult and\ncontroversial tool and I'm not sure I've\nmade the right decision to carry on\ntaking them it was the heart benefits\nthat did it for\nme but we absolutely can deal with this\nwider crisis they've done it in Japan\nthink about smoking right when we were\nkids people smoked everywhere people\nsmoked on the subway people smoked on\nthe bus people smoked on the plane\ndoctors used to smoke while they\nexamined you I remember it happening\nthere's a photo of me and my mother\nwhere she's breastfeeding me when I'm a\nbaby obviously uh smoking and resting\nthe ashtray on my stomach and when I\nfound this photo a few years ago I\nthought she'd feel guilty I showed it to\nher she said you were a difficult baby I\nneeded that cigarette right but you\nthink about how normal that was then\nright now if you saw that you'd call the\npolice right we've gone from you know\nmore than 50% of people were smokers\nwhen we were kids it's now 12% you very\nrarely see a young person smoking\ncigarettes now okay we've got an issue\nwith vaping but you know that's an\nenormous transformation that's happened\nin our lifetimes through concerted\naction right we can do the same with\nfood we can free future Generations from\nthis shitty Choice Japan showed me you\ncan do it with joy right Japanese people\naren't sitting there being miserable\nthey love food their food is great I've\nnever eaten better than in the two and a\nhalf weeks I was in Japan right\nliterally never right it's not about\ndepriving yourself it's about making\nbetter choices and empowering everyone\nto be in an environment where we can\nmake better choices do they still have a\nstigma around uh body shape size weight\nand all of that as well yeah this is one\nof the complexities\nso I don't want to shy away from it\nJapanese people are horrifically\nstigmatizing towards overweight\npeople and that informs some of their\npolicies which are just so strange to us\nthat they sound like a kind of just\nbizarre parallel universe give you an\nexample so in 2008 they had their\nobesity level went up by like 0.4% and\nthey had a massive like National freak\nout and it was like this huge debate in\nJapan what it it was from like you know\nI can't remember literally for something\nlike 3% to 3.4% or something like say\nthat like we wouldn't even notice in in\nthe US if that happened right um and\nthere this huge debate and they\nintroduced something that I frankly just\nwhen I read about it thought this can't\nbe true it's something called the Metabo\nlaw it's B named after metabolic\nsyndrome which is a kind of combination\nof problems you can get when you're\nobese this has very bad Health\neffect so they introduced this rule\nactually can't even say it without like\nit deciding\ninsane in\nJapan every single employee once a year\nhas to be weighed by their\nemployer if your weight has gone up you\nhave to by law drop a plan with your\nemployer to bring your weight down and a\ncompany overall has to report its weight\nlevels to the government wow and if\nyou're overall Workforce got fatter you\ncan be fined by the government right so\nI like how can this work so I went to\nthis company that does it uh I mean\nevery company does it but this is a\ncompany that agreed to show me part\nbecause they manufacture uh products to\nkeep you healthy so they they can't want\npeople to know about it and they're\nsuper nice people but it was freaky so\nyou arrive the first thing you see when\nyou arrive at work is a face recognition\nthing it says hi Jay you walked 1,300\nsteps yesterday or whatever because you\nhave to wear a Fitbit equivalent of a\nFitbit bit and then it says you were\nnumber 121 in the company by the way\nSusie who sits two desks away from you\nhasn't weighed herself this week oh my\ngosh tell her to weigh herself you're\nlike go and then so every you're\nencouraged it's not required but you're\nencouraged um to take a photograph of\nevery meal you take and post it so you\ncan literally go H I wonder what bar\nsits next to me ate yesterday and you\ncan look at it all it's just bizarre and\nI was interviewing people there so I\ninterviewed the the boss who's this 58\nOld Man Inc I have to say incredibly hot\nboss um and he was like talking about\nyeah this is you know this great it's\nreally good for everyone and I was\ninterviewing the\nemployees and they would go yeah this\nreally helps me be healthy and I would\nkind of go right so if you did this in\nthe US or Britain we would burn the\noffice building down and they genuinely\ndidn't understand what saying they would\nkind of go but why I they just it was it\nreally was a moment I thought a profound\ncultural Chasm right I thought this is\nyou're not like\nus we're not like we can't yeah just as\nthey can't understand us we can't\nunderstand that exactly so there are\nlots of things about the Japanese model\nI definitely would not I mean we\ncouldn't integrate that even if we\nwanted to but I if we could I wouldn't\nwant to so there's lots of things about\nthe Japanese model we can't integrate\nincluding just shame right it's a very\nparticularly to women who are overweight\nit's really brutal the shaming there so\nyeah there's lots of things we wouldn't\nwant to integrate and and lots of things\nwe would yeah yeah it's one thing that\nhas stayed with me as we've been on this\nbeautiful journey together today I feel\nlike we've you know I've learned so much\nfrom you I learned so much from the book\nI I really want people to read the book\nto dive into it we've kind of nicely\nkind of visited different chapters and\nand different sections inside of the\nbook but there's one thing that stayed\nwith me is this idea of even after being\non OIC if people are unable to change\ntheir eating\nhabits even though they're satiated\nquicker\ndoes that not necessarily double up on\nthe health problems too so it inevitably\nchanges your eating patterns in one key\nway you eat much less right but the an\nissue and this was definitely true of me\nfor the first six months is to put it\ncrudely I was eating smaller portions of\nthe same o that's what I mean yeah how\ndoes yeah yes I was going to McDonald's\nbut instead of getting like a large Big\nMac meal and nine nuggets I was getting\na hamburger right and that's a moveing\nthe right direction but still very\nimperfect as um Robert Kushner one of\nthe scientists who was involved in the\nstudies about these drugs explain to me\nlook there's an issue about nutrition\njust separate to weight if you're eating\nfood that doesn't give your body what it\nneeds even if you're not obese that's\nstill really bad for you right so for me\nI it made me realize I had to do I'm\nsuper embarrassed to say it but I didn't\nknow how to cook I didn't know how to do\nreally basic things I learned that\npartly because I realized I had to make\nthat change but you could I could have\njust carried on eating smaller portions\nand frankly I'm on the road at the\nmoment I am eating smaller portions of\nthe same [ __ ] I this morning I had a\ntravel is imposs travel is really tough\nor even try living in Las Vegas not\nideal um but the if you worried about\nportion size in this country generally\nyou want to try Vegas but um yeah so\nyeah the issue you're pointed to is real\nI mean you're still moving in a positive\ndirection but it can leave you yeah far\nfrom from the ideal position yeah yeah\nabsolutely yeah and it's been such a joy\ntalking to you today deeply insightful I\nappreciate the honesty of just what a\nchallenging nuanced layered subject\nmatter this is and I feel your analysis\nresearch and thought through it is\nactually so so so helpful in that if\npeople are confused in their decision-\nmaking for themselves their family I\nthink you've at least given them every\nangle possible to think about which is I\nthink somewhat sometimes what's missing\nright sometimes we are just presented a\nbinary angle which is where we started\nand now we're ending today feeling like\nwe can look at this from 12 different\nangles and 12 different points of view\nwe end every episode of on purpose with\na fast five or a final five these have\nto be answered in one word to one\nsentence maximum okay this is very hard\nfor me as you can tell do my brutal\nright okay these are your final F you\nshould have someone to your colleague\nshould taser me if I go beyond a\nsentence right we should we should wire\nyou up yeah exactly uh the first\nquestion is what is the best health\nadvice you've ever heard or received\nit's what Lindy West said that I quoted\nbefore you can't it's hard to treat well\nan object you hate you've got to learn\nto love your body that's great advice I\nlove that one uh second question what is\nthe worst advice Health advice you've\never heard or received I went to an\nAustrian diet clinic in Claren Fort\nwhere they made me eat nothing but tea\nfor like days and days and\ndays yeah not good advice yeah just tea\nhow did that end up tell us I want to\nknow well I was surrounded by people I\nwould go like so there were people there\nwho'd he'd been there for like three\nweeks and they were on the tea diet and\nI said how do you feel and they said\nterrible I was like yeah you're going to\ndie get out of here I felt like Jack\nNicholson want Flew Over The Cook n get\nout of here that's amazing got to buy a\nbrat first up the\nroad uh question number\nthree what's something that surprised\nyou about this journey that you went on\nwith the magic\npill how hard it is how complicated it's\nnot I'm not normally such an even-handed\nperson it's really\ncomplicated and that surprised you you\nthought it would be a lot more clearcut\nI thought every other book I've ever\nwritten I've come to a more firm\nconclusion at the end than this you know\nwith this it's sort of like you've\nreally got to go down the list of the\nrisks and benefits for yourself and it\nwill really help you to know all these\nrisks and benefits\nbut I I can't tell you at the end and\nnow dear reader do it or don't do it or\ndo these things you know I'm completely\nfailing at these one sentence\nunconscious that's great I'm asking you\ntoo permissive Jay give angry face when\nI go one sentence uh question number\nfour if you had to ask people to reflect\non three things while they're making\ntheir decision there are many things in\nthe book that they need to read and\nstudy but three things while they're\nreading the book that you'd like them to\nreflect on as they're making their own\ndecision what would they be that are not\nrelated to BMI or some of those more\ntactical ele not tactical those U\ntangible elements you shared with us\nearlier think about what your\nrelationship with food was in your\nfamily when you were a child because all\nsorts of issues around that will come to\nthe surface which we haven't touched on\nbut it's really important number two is\nthink about how important pleasure in\nfood is for you because a lot of people\nexperience huge reduction in it although\nI didn't a lot of people do number three\nis these drugs might be significantly\nreducing addiction this is hugely\ncontested but there are serious\nscientists who think they are and that's\na whole dimension we need to think about\nnot just food addiction but actually\nlike cocaine addiction venal addiction\nacross the board those would I guess be\nthe three things that we haven't covered\nthat would be the things I there's about\n100 things from the book we haven't\ncover yeah exactly yeah okay great uh\nFifth and final question if you could\ncreate one law that everyone in the\nworld had to follow what would be\noh one\n[Music]\nlaw can I get rid of a law oh you be the\nfirst person to do it I love it the law\nI would get rid of would be the\ncriminalization of addiction you know\nhad a lot of addiction in my family\num punishing people who got addiction\nproblems makes the problem worse most of\nthe money we spend on drug policy in\nthis\ncountry\nis shaming humiliating and literally\ncaging people with addiction problems in\nPortugal when they took all that money\nthey spent on putting people in prison\nshaming them and humiliating them and\nspent it instead on like helping them\naddiction massively fell overos deaths\nmassively fell we could do the same and\nwe'd get the same results so it would be\nI guess take the current law
