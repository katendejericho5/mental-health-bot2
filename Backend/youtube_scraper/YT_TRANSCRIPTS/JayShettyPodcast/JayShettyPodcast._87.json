    "transcript": "I want to wake up more happy than\ndepressed I want to enjoy life I'm not\nthe final form of myself I don't know\nwhat that's going to be he's one of the\nmost influential voices in morning radio\nyep it's the world most dangerous\nMorning Show to Breakfast Club\nCharlamagne the god I had no idea who I\nwas there was this character that had\nbeen created named Charlamagne I'm like\nI don't know who this person is some\npoint I remember saying to myself well\nwhat's wrong with me it I thought it was\nokay\nhey everyone I've got some huge news to\nshare with you in the last 90 days\n79.4% of our audience came from viewers\nand listeners that are not subscribed to\nthis channel there's research that shows\nthat if you want to create a habit make\nit easy to access by hitting the\nSubscribe button you're creating a habit\nof learning how to be happier healthier\nand more healed this would also mean the\nabsolute world to me and help us make\nbetter better bigger brighter content\nfor you in the world subscribe right now\nthe number one Health and Wellness\npodcast Jett J shett the one the only\nJett why have you built up such an\nanimosity towards Small Talk where does\nthat come from well number one I hate\nsmall talk you know just on the literal\nlevel right when somebody sees you and\nthey try to you know make conversation\nand they're not really talking about\nanything and it just it's like yo you\nand this person are in this unique\nmoment in time where y'all get to share\nspace and nobody is saying anything that\nis annoying to me and it's annoying to\nthe point where I'm like I would rather\njust tell the person like we don't have\nto do this we can be on our phones we\ncan be reading the book we can sit here\nin silence like you don't have to try\nyou know to make conversation but then\non a a more macro level I feel like\nwe're having too much Small Talk meeting\nwe're having too many micro\nconversations we're taking these micros\nand making them macros like the things\nthat people you know get online and\ndiscuss and debate about and argue about\nover and over and over and over and the\nbigger scheme of things mean nothing and\nthat's why things just come and go in\nthis era every day you get online and\nyou know it looks like there's a\nconversation that's the biggest thing in\nthe world wait three hours wait four\nhours wait 12 hours it'll be completely\ngone and it'll be like well damn I\nthought everybody was so concerned about\nthis you know two two days ago so I just\nhave a a a problem with everything being\nso macro that shouldn't be nowadays and\nand the things that we should be\ndiscussing like the big macro\nconversations we have a way of making\nthose so micro and that's the background\nnoise that's why even like you know on\nBreakfast Club or on my podcast\nbrilliant idiots when we do discuss\nthings right that might be rooted in pop\nculture I'm always trying to see like\nwhat's the bigger conversation that we\ncan be having behind this can't just be\nthat y'all think this person is a\nterrible person or that was a bad tweet\nlike what's the psychology or what's the\nthing that we can you know discuss that\npeople going to actually learn from yeah\nthat's what I want to I want to do and\nhow do you break that cycle let's say\nyou bump into someone that you haven't\nseen for a bit and I think a lot of\npeople struggle with this you see them\nat a party an event in the corridor and\nyou go hey how's it going oh yeah good\nyeah cool and you know you're not\nlistening you know there's no real thing\nhow do you break that if you can so one\nexample is you say look we don't have to\ndo this how do you break it in a\npositive sense like how even people with\ntheir friends with their family you're\nat family dinner and everyone's talking\nabout whatever how do you actually break\nthat and Elevate that like what's a\nhealthy way tell them be honest about\nwhat you're feeling in that moment be\nlike yo we ain't talking about nothing\nright now I'll be like yo well who's\ngoing to start the conversation throw\nsomething on the table like literally\nthat's what this book is this book is\nliterally just a series of topics that I\nfeel like you know you could just throw\nin at a lunch throwing in at a dinner\ntable you know throw in if you're just\nsitting around on a plane with somebody\nand you want to have a conversation but\nyou can't like we make this a lot more\ndifficult than we need to and all and\nall it takes is for somebody to break\nthe ice that's all you're literally\nwaiting for and you're sitting at a you\nknow you're sitting around with somebody\nyou just like I want to talk but I just\ndon't know what to say and you're\nthinking should I bother this person\nshould I not bother this person does\nthis person want to be bothered does\nthis person want to talk maybe they do\nmaybe they don't maybe that's a question\nright you can ask them like you feel\nlike having a conversation if that\nperson says no respect that yes don't\nask them that hoping that they say yes\nbut if they say no you're still going to\nforce them to have the the conversation\nlike sometimes you should just ask a\nperson like yo do you got time to talk\nyeah like how often do you get that Jay\nexactly people just run up to you and\nthey just throw their stuff on you all\nthe time instead of saying yo Jay you\ngot time to speak right now and if you\nsay not at the moment they're offended\nyou may not want to offend them so you\ntake time to have this meaningless\nconversation this small talk you're just\ntelling them yeah just because you don't\nwant to offend them but then you're not\neven really paying attention you know\ntoo well so nobody's doing we're not\ndoing each other any favors about doing\nthat so just be honest about what you're\nfeeling in that moment and yeah and I\nfeel like the reason you pointed out\nthere the reason why so many of us are\nstruggling to be honest with people is\nbecause people are offended by honesty\neven if it's genuine and even if it's\nthoughtful like you just said like if I\nasked you I was like hey shoman can you\ntalk about and you were like Jay I don't\nhave time right now because of this this\nand this or whatever I'm in between\nsomething as a respectful person back\nI'm going like I understand that I\nactually had someone on message this\nmorning I'd messaged someone inviting\nthem to an event and they didn't get\nback to me and they messaged me this\nmorning and were just like Jay I'm so\nsorry I was like getting ready for the\nmet and my outfit went wrong and then\nlike I had to figure this out and it's\nbeen crazy and it all worked out but I\nwanted you to know you know I always\nrespond to you and I was like yeah I\nwasn't offended at all I respect that\nand thank you for for explaining and it\nturned out but a lot of the times I feel\nwe're scared of being honest because\nwe're scared the other person's going to\nturn around and go oh you never get back\nto me oh you think you're too important\nfor me we are scared of offending people\nhow can we all stop being so offended\nbecause I feel like anything offends\nanyone these days that's that's a\nmulti-layer answer right because number\none I think we have to stop being people\nPleasers and I think that you know if\nyou grow up in a certain environment\nyou've had certain things you know\nhappen to you like my therapist always\ntold me like I know exactly why I'm a\npeople pleaser right and I and I talk\nabout it in the book I'm a people\npleaser because you know abused our at\nat the age of eight right so me not\nwanting that young lady to touch me\nanymore turned into her calling me uh\nugly and saying I had a big nose so in\norder for her to stop doing that I would\ncontinue to let her you know touch on me\nso it's like you don't realize how that\ncarries on into adulthood to where you\njust become this people pleaser you\ndon't want to let anybody down because\nif you feel like you let them down then\nthey're going to start speaking ill\nabout you and doing things that hurt\nyour feeling so you just continue to do\nwhat's best for them sacrificing your\nown peace and we can't do that you just\ngot to set boundaries for yourself and\nbe like yo I'm not going to be a people\npleaser in any way shape or form and man\nhonestly if my\nboundaries you know cause somebody to\nfeel offended then that's the whole\npoint of having the boundary in the\nfirst place I got to have a boundary\nfrom this person to be with cuz you're\nupset with me because I'm placing a\nboundary for my peace of mind N I don't\nneed you on my life to begin with yeah\nhow how early well when were you ready\nto revisit that 8-year-old self like\nwhen did you feel comfortable to even\nreflect back on that in therapy because\nI imagine that well you can tell me when\nyou were eight did you just block it out\nin the next few years and then when did\nyou go back to it and say oh actually\nthat's where a lot of it started uh I\nwas watching episode over winfy and\nTyler Perry was on there and Tyler Perry\nwas you know crying about the abuse that\nhe experienced from a woman in his\nfamily and I think I was in my 20s and I\nremember saying to myself like what's\nwrong with him like why is he you know\nupset about that and then when at some\npoint I remember saying to myself well\nwhat's wrong me it I thought it was okay\nbut then you kind of suppress it again\nbecause I wasn't going to therapy in my\n20s but then when I started going to\ntherapy in like my late like mid-30s\nthat's when I started the unpack a whole\nlot of that stuff cuz you know you go to\ntherapy for one thing you go to therapy\ncuz you dealing with you think you're\ndealing with anxiety and depression then\nyou start peeling back all of these\ndifferent layers and you start realizing\nall of this other trauma you know that\nyou've experienced and you know that was\nthat was one of those things like you\nknow being a people pleaser not setting\nproper boundaries because of that moment\nthat happened to me you know when I was\neight years old and carried on\nthroughout my whole whole adult life\nuntil I finally realized like\noh this is why I don't like letting\npeople down this is why I do things you\nknow for people even when I don't want\nto this is why even if I'm not happy\nnecessarily about doing something I just\ngo along to do it because I don't want\nto upset or offend that person to cause\nthat person to be you know looking at me\nin in in in a in a negative way so I\nwould say like mid-30s is when I really\nstarted un unpacking it so it's probably\nbeen like the last 10 years of really\nunpacking it and when you ate how long\ndid that abuse loss like how how\nrecurring was it and I don't know man\nbecause and I I even mentioned it in the\nbook it what it I I suppressed so much\nabuse that I experienced when I was\nyoung that it wasn't even that one\nperson you know but you just you\nsuppress it because in a a lot of ways\nit becomes the norm like I remember\nbeing young like 9 10 11 years old\nhaving conversations with other young\nmen I grew up around and we were all\ntalking about older women we was dealing\nwith and we thought we was lying to each\nother but now when you look back on it\nit was just all a bunch of young kids\ngetting abused but when you a young man\nyou don't look at it like that when\nyou're a young man you just like oh I'm\ngetting action early you know I'm\ngetting action early and I'm getting\naction with older women early so you\ndon't look at it like that until you get\nolder and realize how man how a lot of\nthat impacts you you know uh like\nmentally and emotionally yeah what were\nsome of the ways that you think that\nimpacted you and it's interesting I love\nwhat you said there like when you're\nyoung you actually see that as like ego\nbravado arrogance like it's cool what\nwere the things that you started to\nextrapolate through therapy and the work\nyou did where you were like oh that's\nthe kind of impact that it's had in my\nreal life in my real adult life the the\nbiggest one for me is is the people\npleasing aspect that's literally the\nbiggest one like not having no\nboundaries and when I did try to set\nboundaries with with with with one of\nthe women in particular her you know\ngetting in my head Psych ially calling\nme ugly and saying I got a big nose and\nall of this other stuff so for me the\nbiggest you know issue was the fact that\nI just did not know how to set proper\nboundaries and when I did set them it\nwas like uh it wasn't the brick house it\nwas the straw house you know you could\njust blow it you could just blow it away\nso I never really set any proper\nboundaries it wasn't until I started\nunpacking a lot of that stuff that I\nrealized like no I'm going to set my\nboundary and I'm not going to be upset\nat you know any bad big bad wolf that's\nthat's mad that they can't blow my blow\nmy house down yeah what I find\ninteresting especially is I think we all\ndeveloped a peacemaker people pleaser\npersonality type through different\nreasons how have you found yourself not\nbeing a people pleaser with your\ntherapist because I find a lot of people\nend up playing that role where they\ncan't be honest with their therapist\nbecause we want our therapist to like us\nand say Well done like good work you\nknow like oh you really so how how did\nyou find yourself getting that ability\nbecause I think a lot of people\nlistening and watching may be going to\ntherapy they may be trying to turn to\nhelp but actually they find themselves\nplaying that same role with that\ntherapist man I got a new therapist you\nknow uh this past year\nand my first therapist I might have been\nlying to her\nprobably 50 60% of the time just because\nthere was so many things that I thought\nI wanted to share but I wasn't and it\nwasn't until earlier this year you know\nhaving a uh I me and my wife went away\non this nice little spiritual Retreat\nfor a weekend and you know we was in\nindulging in plant-based medicines you\nknow um I iasa in particular and um one\nof the things that came forth for me was\nliterally stop lying to yourself and\nstop volunteering those lies to other\npeople and so much came up in that\nmoment you know so much you know like I\nsaid abuse that I experienc as a child\nall of that type of stuff and that's\nwhen I was like oh I've been I've been\ntelling half truths I haven't been being\ncompletely honest like I've been telling\nyou know just enough of a of of a story\nto get just enough back but that's not\nhow you you know properly heal anything\nlike you got to deal with it all or you\nknow don't even don't even don't even\ntry and so for me I feel like you know I\nprobably was lying to like my first\ntherapist for like I would literally\nprobably say half of the time and do you\nthink we do that because we're actually\nscared of having to address is that the\nreason 100% like it's still fear it's\nstill insecurity that we're not willing\nto share with anyone like even that\nnight that I was you know that that that\nthat first well that was the second\nnight of the journey on Iowaska like me\nand my wife been together 26 years and I\nwas sharing things with her that I never\nhad shared\nwith anybody and that felt so so so so\nfreeing and even in that moment I'm like\nI don't think there's anybody else I\ntrust to share these things with not\neven a a therapist no matter how good\nthe therapist is no matter how you know\ngreat the therapist is like this\nindividual that I've shared majority of\nmy life with is the only person I feel\ncomfortable you know putting all that on\nthe table for yeah I think that's a\nreally interesting point because I think\nthe words honesty and vulnerability have\nsomewhat been exploited in and of\nthemselves in this idea that if you're\nhonest everyone has to know everything\nlike you have to just put it all out\nthere what you just said is actually\neven with my therapist they're not going\nto get the 100% version of me because my\nwife my partner who's been with me for\nover 20 years now it's like that person\nnot only deserves it but we've built up\nenough trust and there's earned respect\nwhere we both can share that what's been\nyour take on on the internet like\noversharing unders sharing overt telling\nundertal you better say everything to\neveryone right like that's what\nvulnerability is and I think there was\nlike this false pressure that you had to\nshare all your business with everyone\nyeah I think on the Internet it's uh a\nlot of people crying out for help who\nprobably not probably who need to be in\ntherapy actually talking to somebody and\nit's a whole lot of people just lying\nbut that's what I mean when I say you\nknow stop lying to yourself and stop\nvolunteering those lies to other people\nevery single day people wake up and just\nvolunteer lies for no reason and I'm not\nsaying lies have to be negative like\nthey just lie about their life they lie\nabout who they are they lie about what\nthey do and it's like nobody asked you\nfor that right like nobody so you're\ninviting all of this negative energy\ninto your life you're inviting all of\nthis opinion and all of this critique\nthat's literally going to have real\nworld consequences because that's the\nstuff that's going to give you anxiety\nthat's the stuff that's going to you\nknow cause you to have bout of\ndepression and you're you're going to be\nsitting there dealing with all of this\nstuff for a a farce you created like\nwhat is the the point of that so it's\nlike for me man we really all just have\nto stop\nvolunteering you know the The Lies We\nTell ourselves to others yeah what led\nyou towards plant medicine as a method\nof healing as a method of reflection\nlike what what made you go down that\nroute cuz you've done therapy for years\nyou've talked about it you're a big\nAmbassador for me mental health what was\nthe opening there I mean it was just\nsomething I wanted to try and then they\nalways say you know you don't you don't\ndo it unless it it's calling you and so\nyou know just reading about it and you\nknow seeing you know what other people's\ntake on it was like two things that\nreally attracted me was everybody that\ndid it was telling me like yo I saw God\nlike I knew people who were atheists\nlike like Neil Brennan was an atheist\nand he did it and now he's like a\nBeliever and you know and I was like\nwhoa and I've always had faith and I've\nalways been a Believer so I just wanted\nto kind of see like I want to see you\nknow see see more of that and I think um\npeople saying how it detaches you from\nyour ego like I thought that was very\npowerful because that's something that\nwe all try to do every day but they was\nlike no it feels like somebody literally\ntakes your ego and just rips it away\nfrom you and I wanted to know what that\nfelt like and man I\nabsolutely Absol over\nunderstand what it what it felt like um\nespecially that that that second night\nyeah Y where did you go for it where\nwhere did you try it out I was in I was\nin California okay okay in okay great\ngreat so you didn't go too far no\nbecause I've heard of I've had friends\ngo out to like Costa Rica and then you\nwent low Co it easy yeah Shaman I talked\nto was like why even I think it I don't\nknow if it was Peru or Costa Rica was\nsomewhere I forgot where it was but he\nwas just like that's a jungle he was\nlike you don't want to have that kind of\nexperience in a jungle I mean he wasn't\nknocking anybody who did he just like\nfor you on your first time I just don't\nyou know recommend that so it was just\nkind of like Divine Alignment like it\nwas one of those things like it had been\ncalling me for the past I would say five\nor six years and then like the\nopportunity just presented itself yeah\nyou know with some with some some people\nwith some really great energy yeah and I\nwas like yeah why not and it just all\nlined up it was one of those things was\nlike oh I I'm actually free this weekend\nyeah the wife wanted to do it we went to\ndo it oh it's beautiful what did you\nwhat have you found has been the hardest\nthing for you to be honest with yourself\nabout everything everything yo it's so\neasy for us to get caught up in line\nourselves because we do it to protect\nourselves in a lot of way right so like\nit might be a person that you genuinely\nhave love for like genuinely just as a\non a human level like you love this\nperson and like you know this person\nmight have a talent or a skill set that\nyou know you want to help amplify like\nprovide a opportunity for but you know\nas well as I do that you know character\nTalent sometimes will take people where\ncharacter can't sustain them so even\nthough this you see this person's Talent\nyou know once they get in a certain\nposition you realize their character\nisn't going to be able you know to keep\nthem there but you will constantly lie\nto yourself about this person's\ncharacter over and over and over and\nover and then you wonder why things\naren't working out and literally it will\naffect everything that you're doing like\nlet's just say it's a team and you put\nthis person as part of the team this\nperson is causing problems with the rest\nof the team and you see it but you're\nmaking excuses for it you know and it's\nlike or even a friend that's you might\nhave been friends with a person for a\nlong long long time and you know y'all\nhave very deep intimate conversations so\nyou know this person different ly than a\nlot of other people know them so you get\na soft spot you know in your heart for\nset individuals so when you're hearing\neverybody else talk about how terrible\nthis person is you're lying to yourself\nabout it like no y'all just don't\nunderstand this person like it's like no\nthe reality is they are a terrible\nperson and they need to do more work and\nthey need to really you know figure\nthemselves out so you know the biggest\nthing um yeah it's\njust we we constantly lie ourselves\nabout everything you might you might\nlook in the mirror and know you need to\nlose 20 lbs like you might put a shirt\non and know it don't quite fit right but\nyou'll pull on it and tug it and you\nknow how does this look you know\nsomebody like oh it looks all right\nlooks good and you're like hey it does\nand then you get on Instagram and then\nyou get humbled there a bunch of people\nthat don't know you at all who are\nwilling to tell you the truth about how\nyou look then you lie to yourself again\nand you say to yourself oh they just\nhating you knew that was whack when you\nput it on you knew you had no right\nputting that shirt on before you put it\non but you decided to do it anyway so I\njust feel like we I think every single\nmoment of Our Lives is an exercise in\nbeing honest with ourselves first and\nforemost and then then the rest of the\nworld and then choosing who to share\nthat Honesty with because sometimes\npeople aren't lying it's just none of\nyour business yeah and I think that's\nsomething that people forget too\nespecially in this world of oversharing\nI have to constantly remind people that\nespecially in this era of the internet\nI'm like when you talking about\ncelebrities you don't know any of these\npeople I don't care what they post on\nsocial I don't care what you hear in\ntheir music you genuinely do not know\nany of these\nindividuals stop lying to yourself like\nyou do and and in what sense because I'm\nI'm thinking of something but in what\nsense do you mean like we don't know\nthem or how how that applies to us you\nthink we're commentating on a life that\nwe don't know about is that yeah people\npeople pass these judgments like y you\nyou'll see whole psycho\nanalysts about people right and it's\nlike how did you come to that\nconclusion like literally you're\nbreaking down a person's whole P oh\nthey're a narcissist and they're\negotistical and they're out for this and\nthey I'm like how do you know based off\na tweet yeah how do you know based off\none conversation that they had you don't\nknow this person this person has lived\nyou know 30 plus years 40 plus years\nwhatever it is you you you do not spend\nevery waking moment with this individual\nhow do we come come to these fullblown\nconclusions about people that we don't\nknow I had somebody get mad at me the\nother day cuz I told them I don't know\nthis person personally yeah we were\ntalking about a a artist and I was like\nI don't know that person personally that\nnow that the person I was talking to did\nyeah but I so I understand how they felt\nyeah but I don't have that same personal\nconnection or feelings towards this\nindividual because I don't have a\npersonal connection with them and I and\nwhen it comes to public figures a lot of\ntimes it it makes you more objective\nbecause you don't have any bias because\nanybody that you actually have a\nconnection with you're going to have a\nnatural bias towards them that's another\nthing we lie to each other about we lie\nto each other like we're so honest and\nso objective when we all have our biases\nfor people we all have our biases for\nplaces we all have our biases for things\nand that's okay yeah if you can address\nthat and and and say yeah I know I got a\nbias then you could actually have an\nhonest conversation about whatever it\nyou're talking about are look at things\nyou know from a honest perspective if\nyou can't even be honest about your\nbiases then you starting off from from\nfrom a lie yeah I often find it's this\nObserver mindset that we're missing\nwhere it's like okay we're having a\nconversation right now but can I\nactually allow myself to look at it from\nthis perspective if I can't do that like\nif I can't see oh I'm currently\ndisplaying ego and the other person is\ncurrently displaying defensiveness if I\ncan't see what I'm displaying and what\nsomeone else is and I'm only seeing what\nthey're displaying then I'm not really\nobserving I can't be objective\nabsolutely and and I find that that's\nexactly what's missing where and I I can\ntestify to what you just said whether\nit's inaccurate guest lists at people's\nwedding that are printed in the papers\nor whether it's inaccurate oh I know the\nnews saying oh they're going to get a\ndivorce or their kids hate them or\nwhatever else it is how you yeah I can\ntestify to having no knowing people\ngoing none of that's true and and it's\nand it goes back to the point you\nstarted with which is this idea of we\nget so lost commentating on everything\nand everyone else that we know nothing\nabout that we don't have time and energy\nto work on what's going on inside here\nabsolutely and and I find it remarkable\nthat we spend our lives trying to solve\npsychoanalyze entertain ourselves by\nsomeone else's problems rather than\nfixing our own well we do that on\npurpose yeah because if we can talk\nabout everybody else then we can avoid\nthat hard painful excruciating work it\ntakes to deal with our own BS if I if\nI'm if I can look at everyone else I can\navoid looking in that mirror all day\nlong I'm I'm too busy sightseeing other\npeople and commentating on other people\nso I never have to look in the mirror\nyou know at at at what it is that I need\nto fix yeah yeah you said something\nthat's interesting too man and that's\nwhy that's why this era we in is is so\ndifficult and I think even you know our\npositions as as media personalities\nbecause you know I remember when I used\nto work for Wendy Williams she used to\nalways say to me you either going to be\nof the people or of the industry but\nit's almost impossible when you're in\nthe business because you're going to\nactually meet people and you're going to\ndevelop relationships and I think a lot\nof times we have a a a different\nperspective of things because we're kind\nof in it like I've literally been with\nindividuals couples watching them love\non each other watching them kiss on each\nother and then it'll be like breaking\nnews they're getting a divorce they hate\neach\nother they're apart and I'm like this is\na mind [ __ ] like yeah cuz I'm I'm I'm\nlike whoa like and it puts so much in\nperspective and not even just that like\nus as individuals you'll see things\nabout yourself and you're like that's\nnot remotely true like that's not even\naccurate at all everybody around you\nwill be mad and everybody around you be\nupset and you'll be pissed off too but\nthen you had to really say to yourself\nwhat are you going to do yeah I'm not go\nI refuse to go on the defensive and\nstart explaining to myself to a bunch of\npeople who never even took the time to\nlearn the truth anyway yeah if you if\nyou didn't you never took the time to\nlearn the truth so you would rather just\nput this out there you know print this\nsay these things not care if you're\naccurate you know not not care if\nthere's any falsehoods you just whatever\nso why would I take the time to explain\nthe truth to you yeah now I'm get now\nnow not now not only am I validating\nwhat You' said to a certain extent or\nnot not what you said but validating you\nand your platform now I'm actually\ngiving you more content yeah I'm not\ndoing that yeah at all yeah for sure for\nsure I was going to go back to the\npersonal again with you because I feel\nlike a big turning point in your book\nthat you talk about that I can't wait\nfor people to dive into is this moment\nwhere you realize that your father was\nChe on your mom yeah and like that is\nlike a really big moment for you at that\npoint because you're like I think 17\nyears old and and you're learning about\nthis and naturally you feel like tell me\nhow you felt like in that moment because\nit almost feels like the first time you\ndiscovered that something's a lie like\nin a big way I mean yeah that was a very\nmacro conversation you know because I\nhad made up my mind in that moment that\nme and my pops couldn't have no small\ntalk about\nthis situation because you know we live\nin a small town so you're hearing it\nconstantly right and you're you're\ndriving by you know this house and\nyou're seeing his his truck out there\nand you know you're fully aware of all\nof the different lies that he's that my\nthat he's told my mom like oh I'm just\nI'm over there doing work or oh that's\nmy secretary all this other stuff right\nso finally you know just deciding to\nhave the macro conversation and say yo I\nyou you out here cheating on Mom what\nyou doing is fou and my dad was like\nyo you only got one girlfriend you know\none day you going to understand like he\nthat's what that was his reped to me and\nthat that messed me up for a while\nbecause that's my hero like still to\nthis day I love my dad like my dad I\nfully understand you know the totality\nof my father as a man and as I've become\na man myself at 45 years old I overstand\nyou know everything that you know he he\nhe went through and so when he said that\nto me I felt like I had to uh um live up\nto his expectations so that's when it\nbecame a thing of oh let me show him\nthat I I can get a roster I don't have\nto be you know committed to to one\nperson and yo that lasted for a while\nnot not a while but but too long for my\nmy liking right and so I remember later\non years down the line my dad saying to\nme you know the worst thing that he ever\ndid was caused my mother to leave him\nand telling me that I always had it\nright cuz he you know I'm with the same\nwoman right for 26 years so he was like\ntelling me I always had it right and I'm\nlike damn this why you shouldn't always\nlisten to adults\nbro like just because you love a person\nand they're older than you and they got\nmore experiences than you don't mean\nthat they're always right but I give my\nfather so much grace because you know\none of the first break the first\nbreakthrough I ever had in therapy I\nmean the thing that led me to tears was\njust realizing that my father used to\ndiscipline me for things that he never\ntaught me me and now I even take it a\nstep further and say my father used to\ndiscipline me for things that he never\ntaught me but also for things that he\nnever learned himself so a lot of his\nhis his his uh his his his raising of me\nwas he was Raising Me Through fear and\nnot love yeah right so because he just\ndidn't want me to make the same mistakes\nthat he made he was terrified of me\ngoing down you know the same path that\nhe went down and I ended up going down\nthat path anyway like even down to you\nknow the mental health Journey like when\nI wrote my second book you know shook\none anxiety playing tricks on me when I\nwrote that I was all the way\ndiscombobulated I had no idea whether I\nwas coming or going cuz I had just\nstarted going to therapy and I had just\nstarted peeling back a lot of those\nlayers so I was just raw like I had I\nhad no idea who I was there was this\ncharacter that had been created named\nCharlamagne I'm like I don't know who\nthis person is then I'm dealing with\nLenard myself I don't know who this\nperson is so I was just all over the\nplace and I literally just put it all in\nthat book and had uh Dr is Major do\nclinical correlations to the things that\nI was talking about but he my father had\nread that book and I talk about this\nstory in the book but he he had read\nthat book and then that same week I had\na cousin who had completed suicide and\nhe had attempted to complete suicide\nlike four other times and the fourth\ntime he completed it I think he was like\n25 years old so my dad was triggered by\na lot of that stuff he was triggered by\na lot of the stuff I wrote in my book\nand he was definitely triggered by my\ncousin completing suicide so my father\ncalls me and he tells me um you know he\nread the book talking about my cousin a\nlittle bit and he goes man you know I I\ntried to commit suicide 30 plus years\nago but I didn't because of you know\nyour your older sister and you and he\nwas like you know I was on two to three\nmedications no no he was actually on 10\n10 to 12 medications and he was going to\ntherapy two and three times a week\ndealing with his own mental health\nissues and so much so that the state of\nSouth Carolina just started giving him a\ncheck and that's what they used to call\nit a crazy check so I remember asking my\nmom like yo you know you know dad was\ngoing through all of this and she was\nlike I just thought he was playing crazy\nto get a check so just think about that\nlike think about if he was able to just\nExpress himself and have those\nconversations with us as a family back\nthen how that would have saved me you\nknow so much grief when I was dealing\nwith panic attacks and stuff as a child\nand thinking something was you know you\nknow wrong with me and um I all of that\nmakes me give my father a whole lot of\nGrace he's just a man who was just\ntrying to do his best you know with with\nwhat he had and the the the knowledge he\nhad at the time so I don't I don't hold\nI I held a lot of that against him for a\nlong long long long time but it was in\nthat moment in 2018 when he told me\neverything he was dealing with I don't\nknow why it just clicked like my dad\njust a man yeah like he just a man just\nlike I'm a man like who am I to not give\nhim the same Grace I want totally what's\nallowed you to have that shoman to be\nable to zoom out and have that context\nand that Grace because I think when\nwe're analyzing these things and you\nkind of connect the dots you're like oh\nyeah my dad treated me like that that's\nwhy I became like that that's why I made\nthat mistake and you can spend so much\ntime in this very linear back and forth\njourney of that was the past that's how\nit connects to the present that's how it\nimpacted my life but you're almost\nlooking at it from a bird's eye view\nlooking down going oh oh that makes\nsense and my dad went through and then\nyou can like give Grace you can have\nwhat was the key in therapy and in your\npersonal work that shifted it from being\nthis linear thing to being a bird's eye\nview of this situation I honestly think\nI've always had that as a child like\nalways like I've always had a bird's eye\nview with things like I've always felt\nin tune to something to something else\nlike there there was always like this\nvoice in my head or this spirit that was\nyou know moving me in certain directions\nor causing me to see certain things\nsometimes I will see things I wasn't\nsupposed to see you know um literally\nand figuratively right and I I've always\nhad these visions\nand I just I remember my dad always\ntelling me when I was a child if you\ndon't change your your ways you going to\nend up in jail dead or broke under the\ntree and a lot of people hear that but\ndon't actually learn that and apply that\nfor some reason I was able at a young\nage to actually start seeing people that\nI love go to jail like for prison\nsentences and I was going to jail and\nyou know I saw people around me that\nwere actually getting killed and I saw\nolder cousins who I used to look up to\nthey they are sitting under the tree\nkind of like not doing much with\nthemselves and I'm like oh that's not\ngoing to be me and I I literally could\nsee all right everything I do today\ndirectly is going to impact what happens\nto me tomorrow so I need to start doing\nwhat I need to do today it's like yo if\nI you know continue to eat like this I'm\ngoing to be fat the future right like if\nI don't read this book you know my my my\nknowledge is going to be limited in the\nfuture so I've always you know by the\ngrace of God just tended to have like a\na bird's eye view of things like my\nthird eye is has been open for quite a\nlong time like to the point even when I\nthink about like me and my wife had a a\nnonprofit back in the day well we\nthought it was a nonprofit when we set\nit up it was a n we set it up as a\nnonprofit but we never went through the\nchannels to making the nonprofit it just\nsound like oh we go set this you know\nit's one of those things and so we had a\nit was called third eye awareness like\nliterally that's what it was called even\nwhen like the first tattoo I ever got\nwas Wolverine from the X-Men CU I love\nWolverine right like I love the X-Men\nI'm a big Comic Book Guy but back then I\ngot the tattoo when I was like 17 years\nold this when tattoos were illegal in\nSouth Carolina I got the tattoo because\nthe thing that attracted me towards\nWolverine was his healing powers and so\nthe tattoo I got on my arm is wolver\nholding a microphone in his hand because\nI thought rap was going to be what\nchanged my life but lo and behold it was\nthese type of microphones that changed\nmy life and you know now my I feel like\nmy my purpose in life is to not only\ncontinue to to heal myself but to\ncontinue to help as many other people\nyou know get on their get on their\nhealing Journey so I was 16 17 years old\nthinking about stuff like this and you\nat the 16 17 you get a tattoo like that\nand in your mind you're explaining it\nperfectly I'm like yo I'm attracted to\nWolverine cuz of his healing powers and\nthen and then WAP the microphone but now\nyou I'm 45 about to be 46 I'm looking at\nit like oh I understand what that was\nnow and that was another Revelation that\ncame to me um you know when I when I\nwent on my waska journey was like yo\nnothing have been wasted literally\nnothing there is absolutely nothing that\nhas happened to me in my life whether\nyou want to label it good bad you know\nugly pretty whatever it was nothing has\ngone to waste in my life every single\nthing has a purpose and had a purpose\nand has gotten me to this point and I\nthink man when you look at things\nthrough that lens it just kind of like\nshapes it shapes your understanding of\nof trauma and you know why so-called bad\nthings happen in a in a different way I\ndon't look at it as good or bad it was\njust like one process of life that gets\nyou to this point I think you just\nnailed something so powerful then I I I\nwant to emphasize it for people because\nI think we go through this Loop where we\nsay oh now I get it everything else I\nwas wrong I wasted time now I get it and\nthen a few years later we go oh no no no\nno I just wasted the last few years now\nI get it and we constantly have this\nbelief that we have to neglect and\nreject our past in order to establish\nour present m we feel like we have to\nconstantly say our past was a waste of\ntime in order to establish that our\npresent is now us doing the right thing\nand I actually fully agree with you and\ncompletely disagree with that because\nwhat you're doing is you're negating all\nof the lessons all of the wisdom all of\nthe learning all of the growth that\nactually got you to that point\nabsolutely and then you're also negating\nthe fact that all the skills you learn\nduring that time all the habits they\ncould still be useful but because you're\nwriting off that time you're writing off\nall of that growth and and I've been\nsaying that to so many people lately\neven when people are like do I think I'm\nwasting my time I'm trying to find a new\njob I want to do something I'm\npassionate about oh Jay like the last\nfew years I just wasted them being\nanxious now I'm confident it's like no\nno no no no like you need to remember\nthat because that's how you got here and\nby the way life is going to give you\nthose scenarios again and you're going\nto need to remember this because next\ntime it will be a familiar right it will\nbe like a familiar feeling of oh I've\nbeen there I know how to deal with this\nthat's why when you even when you\ntalking to you know young people in the\nfield and they'll say things to you like\nwell what if I you know leave New York\nand go to Atlanta and things don't work\nin Atlanta I'm like\nokay like and like yeah what do you mean\nif things don't work because what you're\ngoing to realize later on in life is\nregardless of what happened when you was\nthere it worked I don't care if you went\ndown there and you worked there for six\nmonths and got fired there's going to be\nsomething something you pick up in those\n6 months there's going to be somebody\nyou meet in those 6 months it might just\nbe a time in your life that you actually\nenjoy and you need that you might just\nneed to be in a different environment\nyou know for a little while but there's\ngoing to be something you pick up within\nthose six months that's going to make\nyou realize like it worked I think you\nknow we have these extremes when it\ncomes to where I I could easily look\nback in my radio career and be like I\ngot fired four times so those was four\ntimes things didn't work that is a\ncomplete lie every single one of those\nsituations I got fired from I had the\ntime of my life and I learned so much\nfrom and I met people that are still you\nknow my friends to this day so I\nwouldn't trade any of that for the world\nlike like for for all I know how do we\nknow what we're doing now is working\nyeah we don't this just this is just\nwhat we're doing in the moment I know\nit's working for now but who who's to\nsay this is what we're going to be doing\nwhen we're 50 years old who to say this\nwhat we're going to be doing when we're\n60 we might be still trying to hold on\nto Breakfast Club and on purpose and God\nis like I need you to move and he might\neven still let you keep it but you'll be\nsitting here unhappy yeah depressed\nangry like oh why isn't things moving\nthe way I want them to move it's because\nhe God asked you to move a long time ago\nbut you didn't want to because you're\nstill trying to make this work and it's\nnot working no more just because\nsomething is successful doesn't mean\nthat it's working totally you know\ntotally that's such a good point that's\nsuch a good point and that it reminds me\nthere's this beautiful story that the\nBuddha used to tell about a person who's\non a journey and they're on this journey\nand they come across an obstacle and the\nfirst obstacle is this fast flowing\nriver so they realize I need to build a\nraft so they get the bamboo they get the\nRope they tie it up they build thems an\nor and then they paddle with all their\nstrength and they get to the other side\nand then they think this raft saved my\nlife I'm going to take it wherever I go\nso they strap it to their back and they\ncarry on walking and then the Buddha\nsays that just like F this person gets\nto another challenge and the challenge\nis not a fast flowing river this time\nit's a tall wooded forest with trees\ndotted at every other step so now the\nperson's trying to walk through and the\nraft keep getting stuck wow and they're\ntrying to maneuver and they're trying to\nget through and the raft is getting\nchipped the raft is blocking them from\nwalking through and the Buddha says the\nperson has two choices they either hold\non to the raft and they struggle to get\nthrough or they put it down and they\nwalk on freely and it's the same thing\npoint that you're making right now this\nidea of like what are you holding on to\nthat you believe made you successful but\nis actually stopping you from breaking\nthrough the next challenge and if you\nkeep holding on to it you're just going\nto hurt your hands going to hurt your\nback you're never going to walk through\nand I agree success is probably the\ngreatest prison because the feeling of\nsuccess is so intoxicating that you\nthink I'm just going to keep doing this\nlike a drug because it makes me feel\ngood but actually I may not be actually\nfeeling healthy well feeling like I'm\nmoving in my best self and I've seen\nthat even in my in my career I remember\nwhen I first started my work we grew\nbased on videos I made on Facebook and\ntoday eight years on I don't make those\nvideos anymore Facebook is not our core\nplatform anymore we had to move on and\nevolve and I've seen that time and time\nagain whether it's been a YouTube\nplatform or whatever it is and I think\nwe get tied to platforms we get tied to\nalgorithms we get tied to patterns we\nget tied to all these things and then\neventually become a prisoner of the\npattern and get a become a prisoner of\nthe algorithm and and letting it go is\nhard and and what you're saying right\nnow like recognizing that what you're\ndoing right now may be something you\nhave to let go of is a healthy thought\nman I'm living proof I talk about that\nin the book you know get honest to die\nline um why Small Talk sucks Shameless\nplug but I talk about that in the book\nbecause\n20 16 that's where I was at with it you\nknow I'm I'm six years in on The\nBreakfast Club\nI'm having more success than I ever\nimagined I'm making more money than I\never imagined like you know I I put out\nmy first book Black privilege it's an\ninstant New York Times bestseller like\nwe we we moving like things are great\nthings are fantastic but I'm not happy\nand the reason I'm not happy because I'm\nstill dealing with this anxiety I'm\nstill dealing with you know this\ndepression and I'm starting to feel like\nyou know I'm becoming a\ncharacter of of of of myself to a to to\na certain extent and it was like when I\nI made the decision to start going to\ntherapy number one but then you start\ngoing to therapy and you start saying to\nyourself like all right this has gotten\nme to this\npoint what is going to get me to that\nnext level of life I wasn't thinking\nabout career or anything like that I\nsaid what's going to get me to that next\nlevel of life because I want to\nenjoy life I want to wake up\nmore happy than depressed you know I\nwant to you know wake up feeling you\nknow more secure about myself than\nimposta syndrome like what's going to\nget me to that and what got me to that\nwas letting go of just what I felt like\npeople wanted from me and that's another\nreason the comments and stuff are so\ndangerous because you can put things out\nthere and immediately get real time\nfeedback and you know this is this is\n2018 right or 2016 2017 you know or\nprior to that it was 2010 and 2016\nthings weren't as weren't that toxic on\nsocial media so you could kind of get\nlike some real world criticism and you\nwould see these things that you know I\nguess people like about you so you would\nconstantly feed them more of that or you\ngot Publications saying oh Charlamagne\nis the Hip Hop high with Stern you like\nwhat is that mean so you start giving\nthem more of the wild you know crazy\nAntics but for all I know they could\nhave meant that because of you know uh\nthe introspective interviews that that\nthat that get done on Breakfast Club as\nwell but I wasn't seeing that aspect of\nit I was just seeing the raah the\nwildness and so for me just personally\nand professionally I just was not happy\nand I had to you know let that go so\nyeah that was the most freeing thing for\nme because when I did that I\nexperienced way more I wouldn't be here\nsitting with you you know having the\nsuccess that I've had if I hadn't to let\nlet that wrath go oh yeah and there was\nalso a period where you know because of\nthis cancer culture era you live in You'\nbe definitely ashamed to see some of the\nstuff that you you know used to do\nyou're not you're not necessarily\nashamed of it you're more so afraid of\noh they're going to use this against me\nwhatever whatever but guess what you\ncan't care about that yeah and the\nreason you can't care about that because\nif you really have faith in a higher\npower if you really trust you know God\nto God you you have to know that every\nsingle moment that you were in you were\nthe person you needed to be for that\nmoment yeah because it's just a journey\nand it's a process and eventually you\nbecome who you're supposed to be and\neven the version you're looking at me\nright now I'm not the final form of\nmyself I don't know what that's gonna be\nnobody does but I know that I'm on the\njourney and I'm GNA keep walking yeah\none thing I wanted to pick your brain\nabout was this idea you kind of alluded\nto it there it's\nthis we have this rhetoric on social\nmedia which is like we want people to be\nmore empathetic and compassionate and\nkind we want people to when they share\ntheir vulnerable mental health Journey\nthat we all got to listen and be\nattentive but then when sometimes we see\nsomeone with a mental health challenge\nmake them act different we're the first\nones to point out that they're an idiot\nthey're a loser there's something wrong\nwith them those I'll give you an example\nof what I mean by this like uh Tom\nHolland talked about this when he came\non the show he was talking about how\nyou know he's always been seen as\nSpider-Man and this cool kid and all the\nrest of it and then when he started\ntalking about his mental health or\nactually no when he just announced that\nhe'd given up alcohol and he was sober\nall the news was like he was saying this\nhe was saying all the news was like oh\nTom Holland the Happy go-lucky Kid\nwasn't actually he was depressed and it\nwas like and they they made it a whole\nthing and he was like no I just gave up\nalcohol I wasn't like an alcoholic I\njust didn't want to drink anymore and so\nall of a sudden it was like Twisted the\nother way where it was like oh the kid\nthat you think is happy isn't he's\ndepressed or the kid he's got mental\nhealth or whatever it may be and it\nwasn't in the kind compassionate way it\nwas more like a well look you didn't see\nthis so I find it like the way we react\nto certain things it's almost like we're\nbeing Hypocrites in and of ourself\nbecause at one point we're saying we\nshould care for people who have this but\nthen we're willing to point it out how\nhave you kind of seen that navigate when\nyou see the worst forms of what mental\nhealth can do to people versus someone\nmaybe not displaying the worst mental\nexternally but it's just talking about\nit does that make sense yeah I don't\nknow how anybody can diagnose someone\njust by watching them through the media\nyeah like you know if that's the case\nwe're all dealing with mental health\nissues 100% some people just shitty\npeople and that's the other thing like\nand and by the way we say two things can\nbe true no multiple things can be true\nat one time like you use the example of\nTom\nHolland why can't he be the happy gold\nlucky kid who said he's not but that's\nthe only version of him you had in your\nmind so now when you see another version\nthat doesn't fit your expectation you're\nupset with him the happy go-lucky kid is\nnot so happy anymore that's life you n\nyou show me a human that's one emotion\nall the time it's just that when you're\na public figure we get these uh it's\nlike these these freeze frames so Tom\nHolland happy you know this person crazy\nlike it's just free like literally free\nfrom this person always mad angry it's\njust freeze frames of people that's not\nthe whole totality of a person like\nthat's actually kind of insane for us to\neven think about it like that like like\nlike like if even if you watch J shett\non purpose you have a a thought a\nperception of Jay shett in your head you\ngot a perception of shamain in your head\nbased off something you may have seen\nthat's your fault yeah if that's the one\nthing you saw and you came to a whole\ndiagnosis about an individual so you\nknow even when you talk about\npeople having\nempathy that goes into what I'm saying\nnow we might want to every all everybody\nall of these humans might wake up every\nday saying to themselves we're going to\nbe empathetic today and we're going to\nbe caring and all of that stuff until\nsomething happens to somebody that you\ndon't like and then that all that goes\nout the window I tend to see that people\nhave more empathy and sympathy and\nthey're more caring towards people they\nactually like it's really a popularity\ncontest but nobody wants to admit that\nyeah we're not looking we're not being\nconsistent about any of these things and\nwe're not being consistent with how we\ndeal with people there can be two people\nthat come out in the news today with the\nsame situation and and based off if we\nlike the individual or not we'll give\nthat person a whole lot of Grace and\ncome to that person's defense but if\nit's somebody that we don't like or\nsomebody social media tells us we\nshouldn't like oh we GNA bury them we\nwant them out of here we want them gone\nthat's not consistent and that means\nyou're lying to yourself and that means\nthat you're not the person you say that\nyou are because you should be giving\nboth those individuals the same amount\nof Grace but you not because we're all\nHypocrites and that's fine we're we're\nall we're everything like everything\nthat we pin on other people we are all\nthose things and more we just got to\nmake sure that we're not um projecting\nyeah wow that's powerful man yeah that's\nand I and it's true all of us are right\nwe all have bias we all have the natural\nhuman tendency to be empathetic to\npeople we like and and and we're all\nthat way and but we've got to be able to\nsee that because if we can see that then\nit's something that we can like you said\nwe don't project otherwise we live in\nour tiny we were talking about this\nearlier like we live in this Righteous\nMind as Jonathan height calls it like\nthis idea of like my way is righteous\nand I believe the way I live and the way\nI think is the only way and the right\nway and that's where it goes wrong\nbecause the truth is if everyone thinks\nlike that now you've just got to you\nknow eight billion righteous ways we\neven have to watch how we uh Express\nthat language right because we all do it\nwe'll say things like man the way you're\nseeing that is\nstrange like are the way I can't believe\nyou're seeing things that way why\nbecause they're not seeing it the way\nyou are like there's there there's\nprobably nothing wrong with the way that\nindividual is seeing it but the but\nbecause you think they should see it the\nWay You Are seeing it you're upset with\nthat person or you might have had the\nexpectation I know I can call this\nperson cuz we love we love confirmation\nby right so I know that I can call this\nperson because this person is going to\nagree with me and then when you pick up\nthe phone and call that person or text\nthat person and realize that person has\na different opinion now you arguing back\nand forth with that person trying to get\nthem to see things the way you see\nthings it's like no let them see it the\nway they want to see it like one of the\nhardest things to do is to get is to\nstep into somebody else's shoes one of\nthe hardest things to do is to see\nthings from the perspective of other\npeople I literally fight myself to do\nthat and some people might say oh he's\nbeing a contrarian no I'm just literally\nI've literally taken the time to step\nout of myself step into that person shes\nsee how they see it and I can understand\nwhere they coming from what's wrong with\nthat yeah I don't see any I don't see\nanything wrong with that I'm not saying\nthat person is right or that person is\nwrong I'm just simply saying I can see\nwhere that person is coming from like I\nsaid multiple things can be true at once\nI can think a person's wrong and still\nsee where they're coming from I can\nthink a person's right but still see\nwhere they're wrong at in their argument\nas well I think that's very hard for\nhumans to do and I don't know why yeah\nyeah you I mean talking about calls you\ntalk about in the book The call that you\nget from Kanye yeah yeah and that call\nlike I walk us through how that applies\nto what you're saying here where you're\ntrying to see things through his\nperspective but then you're also like\nbut I know Pete and we're friends yeah\nyeah his perspective was I'm black he's\nblack we both from hip-hop culture he's\nfrom hip-hop culture Pete Davidson is\nthis white kid from Staten Island who\ndoes comedy he's younger than us because\nwe are we're in our 40s he's younger\nthan us you know his uh ex-wife is now\nout here dating Pete I'm gonna call\nCharlamagne because I need Charlamagne\nto start you know siding with me against\nPete Davidson and he should because he's\nblack and the culture as as Kanye says\nand it's like no Pete Davidson is my\nfriend I can care if he's black I can\ncare if he's white I can care what race\nis I don't care what age he is that's\nsomebody that I met when he was 16 years\nold when we was all doing you know guide\ncode together and we developed a real\nfriendship and a a real Bond I know his\nmother like I mean me and his mom talk\nwe check on each other I've been in his\nmom's house you don't sit in somebody's\nmom's house and eat food with eat food\nwith them and and and call that person a\nfriend and then turn around and do snake\n[ __ ] like that Pete's been to my house\nhe's been around my kids he's been\naround my wife I know him you're not\ngoing to call me and get me to turn on\nmy friend and try to you know say\nbecause we're black and we're of the\nculture it's like no right is right\nwrong is wrong and as I told him you\nknow and had to quote Snoop Dogg from\nfrom the\n1990s you mad don't be mad at the don't\ndon't be mad at the uh the player hate\nthe game because your girl chose him you\nknow I didn't say girl I use some other\nlanguage I use the language Snoop used\nbut your girl chose him and she's a\ngrown woman making her own decisions\ny'all not together no more so for me\nit's like you're not going to call me\nand and and try to Guilt Trip me you\nknow using using Blackness and and Hip\nHop to go against somebody I consider a\nfriend because if I considered you a\nfriend like that Kanye nobody could make\nme do that to you as well you know so so\nso it's really that that simple with me\nI don't have you know I don't have\nflexible morals and values when it comes\nto people that I love and and when it\ncomes to people that I consider actual\nfriends and consider actual family\nthat's why you know betrayal hurts so\nmuch that's why when you realize that\nyou know certain people's character gets\nrevealed when they don't get what they\nwant from you like that's something\nthat's another realization that I've\nbeen you know having a lot lately it's\njust like I don't know that person\nwasn't necessarily my friend like I\nthought they were yeah they were my\nfriend based on what opportunity was\nbeing provided yes at the time yes right\nand so it's like it's sad but you do\nrealize some of that stuff is\ntransactional that's why I said I'm not\nmad at being used just don't just don't\nmisuse me and when things don't go your\nway don't all of a sudden start you know\nkicking my back in just because things\ndon't go your way cuz I'm not going to\ndo that to you other than you know I'm\nlying I would do that to you meaning\nthat when I'm around my people I'm\ndefinitely going to be like that person\nis so [ __ ] up that person is such a\nlike I cannot believe that that\nindividual did such and such but guess\nwhat I can believe it because I\nunderstand humans yeah so I give that I\ngive all of those type of uh you know\nhuman Grace but you know it does it's\nvery disappointing when you're more\nsolid to a person than they would be\nwith you cuz if I embrace you and I say\nyou my friend if I say I rock with you\nI'm I'm I'm we going to ride to the\nwheels fall off yeah yeah totally and\nand I find it's an interesting one\nbecause it's like it's it's almost like\nalso it's it's only the people the only\npeople that attacked you are the people\nwho you know wanted to do something with\nyou but it didn't happen yes right what\nyou're saying about changing morals like\nI find like people attack you and\nthey're like oh I want to do a podcast\nwith you but you didn't want to make it\nhappen so now I'm going to find a way to\nattack you it didn't work out and and\nit's interesting because you go oh well\nthen it wasn't ever a collaboration and\nit wasn't of High character it was an\nopportunity now that the is lost now you\nhave a different view of the situation\nand and I love that point you made about\nhow that's why I think opportunities\ngoing well or not going well shows how\nsomeone responds to it absolutely right\nlike when there's a yes or a no someone\nwho actually responds well to a no and a\nhealthy no again obviously in a in a way\nthat is communicated effectively someone\nwho responds in a positive way to a\nrejection or a no or a closed door that\nperson person you should keep them\naround\nforever man Jay you hitting it on the\nhead so crazy pause it's like do you rem\nlike you know you ever met somebody\nwho's so talented and you say to\nyourself why isn't this person here yeah\nlike why isn't this person\ndoing X Y and Z cuz they're so talented\nyeah and then when you start to like get\nin business with them and you go down\nthe path with them and you start to you\nknow be around them you realize exactly\nwhy they haven't gotten where they need\nto be cuz once again my my my good\nfriend marvette brle always says this\nTalent will take you where character\ncan't sustain you so you start to see\nlike this person is not really a hard\nworker or this person really is is is a\ngossip like this person just likes to\ntalk about everybody else instead of\nfocusing on what they should be focusing\non they're so worried about what\neverybody else is doing and trying to\nshoot down what everybody else is doing\nand you're trying to tell them like\ndon't wor worry about that cuz you know\nlisten sometimes jealousy and envy it's\nnatural right but don't focus on what's\ngoing right for everybody else because\nyou don't know what's going on in their\nlives they might be looking like on on\nthe on on on the surface like they're\nwinning and things are great but they\nmight be going home crying every night\nlike don't worry about that you focus on\nyou but you see that they can't do that\nand when things don't go their way oh\nthey become the most they become the\nworst people everybody's the enemy\neverybody's a terrible person all of\nthese people are out to get me nobody's\nlooking out for me and you realize like\nthat's exactly why you're not where\nyou're supposed to be I've had so many\ndoors closed on me I've heard so I've\nI've gotten way more NOS you know than\nyeses in my life I never was bitter\nabout any of those NOS cuz I truly\nbelieve in God yeah and so whatever God\nhas for me will absolutely positively be\nfor me we love saying that but we don't\nmean it you don't mean it CU when things\ndon't go right for you guess what you\nsay why God why is this thing not\nhappening for me cuz I don't want it to\nat the moment do you trust me or not if\nyou don't trust me I'll be sitting here\nwaiting until you do and guess what if\nyou never do God Bless yeah literally\nstraight up God will be sitting right\nthere I can bless you at any moment but\nnot until you ready you don't trust me\nanyway yeah so until you find that trust\nin\nme good good luck yeah yeah I respect\nyou for that in this I mean you always\nlike this off uh online and offline but\nin the book I really feel like you get\nhonest with us but you're about your own\npain and trauma but you also get honest\nwith us about just you know you're just\nright now you're just spitting facts\nlike it's just reality it's just the way\nit is and I think one of the things you\ntalk about is this desire to like you\nwant to also make a joke when you can\nlike you want to make it funny you want\nto be able to let it you know let it\nkind of live in that world when have you\nfound it that it works and when have you\nfound that that doesn't work like like\nwhen you're trying to make something\ninto being funny or silly or kind of\nlightening the mood when have you seen\nthat be effective and\nineffective probably quite often like\nwhich one which way ineffective\neffective I mean I think it works both\nways both times right CZ cuz cuz like\nsay you do if you're in a room full of\npeople somebody's GNA laugh but then the\nperson you might be trying to make laugh\ndoes not want to laugh in that moment so\nthey're the one that's upset now you're\nreally in your head like I was just\ntrying to make this person laugh I was\njust trying to something good so now you\nreally like trying to get this person to\njust have you know you're trying to put\nbetter energy on this person reality is\nyou just leave that person alone in that\nmoment everything does not require a\njoke I have not learned that I may not\never I may not ever you know learn that\nI really may not like I just feel like I\nlike to be around people who don't take\nthings too serious even when things are\nserious cuz I don't feel like you can\nyou know make really good sound\ndecisions when things are too serious\nbecause emotions are too high like\nsometimes you got to like let's laugh\nabout it let's joke about it let's\nreally really really light in the room\nand then let's like sit down and try to\nlike figure it out like if you are\nsitting around a whole bunch of people\nand everybody's angry and everybody's\nupset everybody's mad you just got a\nteam that's about to make a poor\ndecision wow somebody on the team got to\njust be like whoa yo everybody relax\nhere somebody got to be the r one in the\nroom and most of the time the rational\none in the room is the person\nthat's not they're taking it serious but\nthey're just not taking it serious in\nthe way that you want to take it serious\nbecause I'm the type person I'm like\nwhat can I do yeah like there's certain\nsituations that you hear about certain\nsituations you you are confronted with\nin the moment and you realize like\nthere's really nothing we can do about\nthis except for let it play out yeah so\nwhile we letting it play out let's let's\nlaugh yeah what I'm saying let's crack\nsome jokes you ever seen that movie\num uh don't look up yeah of course yeah\nyeah yeah yeah exactly you see how they\nhandled the end of the world yeah that's\nhow like I'm talking about the Leonard\ncharacter when they were all at dinner\nthey were still pouring drinks and they\nwere eating they knew the inevitable was\nhappening they knew there was nothing\nthey could do to stop it they spent the\nwhole beginning of the movie trying to\nstop trying to stop it and they real\nthey they accepted fate in that moment\nand they decided I'm going out like this\ncuz they knew there was nothing they\ncould do about it and I know that that's\na movie and it it it's probably easier\nsaid than done but that's what I that's\nwhat I strive for yeah like even in the\nface of adversity even when it seems\nlike you know Chicken Little the sky is\nfalling everything's burning down around\nyou you're like exhibit in that video\nhe's just walking and everything's\nburning down and all this bad stuff is\nhappening behind him but he's just\nrapping and moving rapping and moving\nit's just like yo that's how I feel like\nI want to you know constantly live my\nlife and that's the kind of people I\nwant to you know be around people that\nkeep me in that space yeah for sure last\nquestion I want to ask you Shaman before\nwe wrap up is and it's interesting\nbecause it relates to where you just\nsaid if you want to be around those\npeople how do we find belonging in a\nworld we don't agree with but stop\nourselves from only being friends with\npeople we agree with right it's like\nbecause right now we look at belonging\nas like if we age then I find\nbelonging but we both know from what\nyou're saying in the book from what\nyou're saying right now from what you\nsay on your podcast from what you say on\nyour show is like but you are very\ncomfortable sitting down having\nuncomfortable awkward conversations with\npeople who people wouldn't place you\nwith that's right from completely\ndifferent backgrounds different walks of\nlife different schools of thought and\nyou find that to be a very important\nthing to do absolutely so how do we find\nbelonging in a way that we're not just\ncreating little Echo Chambers and\nconfirmation bias schools where we just\nall just say what we think and we all\ndouble click on and go yeah yeah yeah\nthat thing that thing how how do we\ncreate a culture where which you're\ndoing through your work through your\nbook how do you actually do that in your\nlife because I think we all like to be\naround people who agree with us I don't\neven know if you realize it but as you\nwas talking you referred to you refer to\nthat stuff as little yeah and that's\nexactly what it is it's small that's why\nthat's why it's literally called why\nSmall Talk sucks you you macro\nconversations are big conversations that\nyou can have with anybody like when you\nput yourself in those small boxes right\nwhen you confine yourself to\njust speaking with the people that you\nagree with when you confine yourself to\njust being in those Echo Chambers those\nrooms are so small they just seem big\nbecause of social media but that's not\nhow the world Works yo there's really\nthere's really not too many people that\nare going to see the world EX exactly\nthe way you see it so that can't be true\nall of y'all are lying to each other\nbecause y'all just love the community of\neach other y'all are really a bunch of\npeople who need you know support from\neach other and y'all want to have a\nfriend group just like all humans do so\ny'all are all just going along to get\nalong with each other so y'all make this\nimaginary role book this imaginary\nPlaybook and y'all have this imaginary\nrhetoric that everybody has to say and\nif you don't see things like this if you\ndon't say things like this then you\ncan't be in this club no more this club\nis this big like this that club is so so\nso so small so in order to just like\nunderstand that you live in a world that\nyou are going to disagree with people\nlike I said earlier I can think you're\nright but still not\nnecessarily agree with you I can\nunderstand where you're coming from but\nstill think you're you're wrong like I\ndon't understand why we just can't sit\ndown and have more conversations with\npeople and realize this surface that I\nsaw of this individual or this\nperception of this individual that I had\nin my head if you sit down and actually\nhave a conversation with them and like\nlisten to the whole totality of\neverything that they may be saying or\nexperience you'll never be able to\nexperience the whole totality of a\nperson but you'll get closer to what you\nthought if you just sit down and have a\nconversation with them you'll realize\nlike oh what they're saying isn't\nnecessarily that bad or\noh I understand why they see things that\nway I disagree with them but I\nunderstand it and I respect their right\nto think that we spend so much time\ntrying to change people's minds because\nwe're trying to make ourselves\ncomfortable so true we talk about all of\nthis growth that we want to have as\nhumans and we talk about how you know\nand and we like being uncomfortable\nbecause when we're uncomfortable it it\nit's making us grow we know that we're\nevolving we really don't like growing\nand we really don't like being\nuncomfortable we get to a certain point\nand we all need to admit this we get to\na certain point where we're very\ncomfortable and we don't want anything\ndisrupting this comfort so to have new\nconversations and to talk to people that\nwe may not necessarily agree with oh man\nthat scares us to death that scares us\nto death but I would say you should be\nmore afraid of not growing you should be\nmore afraid of thinking that I've gotten\nto a certain point and I'm fine and cool\nhere the world is a beautiful place Jay\nhumans are beautiful people like why\nwould you not want to experience\neverything that God created because a\nlot of these things that we've learned\nthat's not necessarily of God it's just\nthe things that we've picked up in this\nworld some people have picked up things\nthat are different from us but sometimes\nwhen you sit down and you listen to that\nperson and that person shares their\nexperiences or that person you know\ntells you what they've been through\nthat's gotten them to that you know\npoint in life it can be eye openening\nand it's been very eye opening for me\nthroughout my life like my best\nrelationships in life have come through\nme having conversations with people that\nI necessar that I that I didn't have\nanything in common with one of the\ngreatest you know gifts my mother ever\ngave me she was she was an English\nteacher growing up in South Carolina\nlike when I was going up in South Carina\nshe told me read things that don't\npertain to you great so I'm in the\nlibrary I'm reading and everything from\nUFOs you know sasquash to Judy Bloom and\nBeverly clearly to the point where I'm\nlike this woman Judy Bloom is a\nphenomenal Storyteller so I love Judy\nBloom the same way I love Scarface the\nsame way I love Jay-Z the same way I\nlove Ghostface she's that level of\nStoryteller to me and now because of\nthat love of somebody like Judy Bloom\nand me expressing that she's somebody I\nactually call a friend she's actually\nsomebody that I you know have gone down\nto Florida and you know kicked it with\nher and her husband George me and my\nwife like I've been to her bookstore and\nher movie theater like we was just in\ntogether in New York a couple weeks ago\nlike that that comes from being open to\nother people other experiences and just\nlistening to each other and that's\nreally what you know get H us s die line\nwhy Small Talk sucks is really all about\nit's really about us you know getting to\nlisten to each other that's why I end\nevery chapter by saying let's discuss CU\nI want us to have conversation\nI'm opening up conversation I don't want\nyou just to talk to the people that you\nagree with every day Tear Down the Walls\nof that Echo chamber and realize how big\nthe world is the world is infinite\nthat's what I want people to get you\nknow you know from this from this book\nyeah and just the way you reacted to\nthat I could tell how deep the topic is\nfor you it took me a second but when you\nsaid oh the way I said it was little and\nthen you were like oh it's actually\nsmall talk like it applies that showed\nme just how deep this is running for\nyour veins abely you picked up on that\nand it's like yeah I was saying yeah SE\nlittle groups and these little Echo\nChambers and these little kind of like\nyou know text threads or message threads\nwhatever we have that langage is\nimportant J gets smaller and smaller and\nsmaller what's last question what's the\nhardest hardest conversation you've had\nto have with your kid so far so far or\nthe most honest conversation i' say not\nhardest the most honest conversation oh\nman that's listen I got a 15year old a\neight-year-old a 5-year-old and a\n2-year-old all\ngirls so I haven't had it yet they're\nall\nhard they're all difficult okay every\nsingle one especially you know the my my\n15-year-old cuz she's a sophomore in\nhigh school now and you know they're\ndealing with things that we never even\nthought of dealing with like literally\nlike you know and we're dealing with\nadults that we never thought of dealing\nwith and these kids are smart like why\nyou know I I remember during covid my\ndaughter came to me and she came to me\nand my wife and she was like she was in\ntears and she was just like y I'm\noverwhelmed like I'm overwhelmed like\nthis is driving me crazy you know my\ngrades are slipping I'm like I gave her\na hug I'm like we are in a unprecedented\ntime right now like we're literally at\nhome I'm at home doing work you're doing\npottery class on the kitchen floor do\nyou think I give a damn if your grades\nslip at A Moment Like This like I don't\ncare about any of that but when made me\nproud in that moment was she had the\nlanguage because you know she she's\nshe's been to therapy not cuz anything's\nnecessarily wrong I'm just I'm just\nrealizing that we're in an unprecedented\ntime like they these kids deal with\nthings that we don't have to deal with\nso I want them I want her to have the\ntools and the language early because I'm\njust the person still going through it\nmyself her mom is the person still going\nthrough it herself so I want her to sit\ndown and you know talk to experts so but\njust the fact she had the language So\nwhen you say difficult conversations\nhonestly the difficult conversations\ncome\nfrom me having to check my ego as a\nparent because I'm 45 and I believe this\nlittle 15year old doesn't know anything\nyet yeah she knows a whole lot and she\ncan she's teaching me you know a whole\nlot right there's some things that\nchange there's some things that stay the\nsame in this world but there's a whole\nlot that has changed and I think that\nyou know we um we we sometimes are too\nstubborn to to to realize that and so\nyeah I guess to answer your question\nevery day is a difficult conversation I\ngot four I got four girls every day is a\ndifficult conversation like I'm dealing\nwith a different set of emotions every\nsingle day the biggest thing for me is\nto stay centered insane and you know not\nlet my emotions get the best of me like\nthat's one of the biggest conversations\nme and my wife constantly have like we\nget together in our little prayer\ncircles and huddle together like we are\ndoing the best we can I I literally it's\nso funny I told her this yesterday I was\nlike yo you know we've been together 26\nyears and we've experienced so many\ndifferent levels of life together and so\nwhat I said to her I was like the other\nwe've we've re we also realized 26 years\ngo by\nfast so regardless of how stressed out\nwe get because of these children let's\nenjoy the moment like literally let's\njust enjoy the moment we are doing the\nbest we can there is no manual that\ncomes with this you don't want to take\neverything you learn from your parents\nbecause you realize they didn't have all\nof the proper tools and they didn't\nnecessarily you know instill the right\nthings in us at least from a man's\nperspective my mom I felt was phenomenal\nbut my at least from a man's perspective\nyou know I didn't have that so we're\njust all doing the best we can so let's\njust give each other some Grace man and\nlike and and enjoy this ride called\ncalled adulthood absolutely everyone the\nbook is called get honest or D line you\ncan get it right now why Small Talk\nsucks Shalom the god this is the book\nthat I want you to get discuss it with\nyour friends dissect it allow it to\ninfuse into reality I've been really\nreally happy that this book's out\nbecause I spent last Christmas in London\nwhich is what I usually do and I started\nto find that even friends I've had for a\ncouple of decades I found that we were\nbecoming less and less honest with each\nother and I was feeling really\ndisconnected when I was back at\nChristmas and I was trying to figure out\nwhat it was I was like wait a minute is\nit cuz I left eight years ago and I've\nbeen living in the states is it because\nof this is it this and I realized it was\nhonesty and so I started to create\nconversations in my friends group that\nwere\nuncomfortable and when I saw that you'd\nwritten this book I was so moved by it\nbecause I was like that was the exact\nissue that I felt I was moving further\naway from the people I was closest to\nbecause we were all now just playing a\nrole and everyone was playing their part\nbut there was no longer a get honest\nconversation it was all small talk and\nso I really hope that this conversation\ninspires people to get closer to the\npeople you already think you're close to\nthat's right and understand the people\nthat you're far away from that's right\nand so the book is called get honest or\nd Ling why Small Talk sucks that's right\nyou can grab it right now we'll put it\nin the comments in the link in the\ncaption sh man thank you so much again\nman as always I appreciate these\nconversations I appreciate any man we\nalways have conversations on air off air\nand I mean just what you built with this\nplatform on purpose it is so necessary\nman like you know everybody's having\nthese conversations about mindfulness\nand you know wellness and we're all just\ntrying to be the best versions of\nourselves something like this didn't\nexist five years ago just like those\nconversations that people are having now\nweren't necessarily as loud as they were\nyou know as as loud five years ago as\nthey are now and your platform on\npurpose is a big big big huge part that\nso thank you for your service brother\nthank you I appreciate you absolutely\nthank you if this is the year that\nyou're trying to get creative you're\ntrying to build more I need you to\nlisten to this episode with Rick Rubin\non how to break into your most creative\nself how to use unconventional methods\nthat lead to success and the secret to\ngenuinely loving what you do if you're\ntrying to find your passion and your\nlane Rick rubin's episode is the one for\nyou just because I like it that doesn't\ngive it any value like as an artist if\nyou like it that's all of the value\nthat's the success comes when you say I\nlike this enough for other people to see\nit"
