    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Stacy Sims\nDr Stacy Sims is an exercise\nphysiologist and a nutrition scientist\nand a world expert in all things\ntraining and nutrition specifically for\nwomen in addition to working at Stanford\nand with numerous professional a letic\nteams Dr Sims has authored more than 100\npeer-reviewed studies on exercise\nphysiology she has not only evaluated\nexisting protocols for nutrition and\nfitness that are specific to women\nversus men but she has also developed\nmany new protocols that are now in\npractice with professional sports teams\nbut that can also serve people who are\ngenerally interested in Fitness and\nLongevity and in doing so the general\npublic the tools that Dr Sims shares\nwith us today are applicable to Fitness\nto to changing your body composition and\nto overall health today we discuss how\nhormones and hormone Cycles impact\nnutrition and fitness needs specifically\nin women of different ages we of course\ndiscuss the menstrual cycle\nperimenopause and menopause but also\nfemale specific nutrition and training\nas it relates to things independent of\nhormones for instance we evaluate the\nevidence that women may not want to\ntrain fasted and the reasons for that we\ntalk about how training might vary\naccording to different phases of the\nmenstrual cycle and we discuss how women\ncan design nutrition and training\nprograms that are optimized for their\nspecific needs not just because they are\nwomen but because they are women of a\nparticular stage of life and women with\nparticular goals as you'll soon see Dr\nSims is exquisitly skilled at explaining\nthe human universals of nutrition and\ntraining that is the things that do not\ndiffer between men and women and their\nneeds in terms of nutrition and training\nbut she is also exquisitly skilled at\nhighlighting the data showing that there\nare specific areas of nutrition and\nfitness for which women and men differ\nand women have specific needs so today\nyou will learn what those are and you\nwill learn how to apply those specific\nprotocols such that by the end of\ntoday's episode You Will Be armed with a\ntremendous amount of new knowledge about\nthe biological mechanisms and the\nspecific dos and do Nots that can guide\nyou towards your female specific health\nand fitness goals before you begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei\nvenison Maui Nei venison is the most\nnutrient dense and delicious red meat\navailable I've spoken many times before\non this and other podcast and with\nseveral expert guests on this podcast\nabout the fact that most of us should be\nseeking to get about one gram of\nhighquality protein per pound of body\nweight every day not only does that\nprotein provide critical building blocks\nfor things like muscle repair and\nsynthesis but also for overall\nmetabolism and health Maui Nei venison\nhas an extremely high quality protein\nper calorie ratio so that you can get\nthat one gram of protein per pound of\nbody weight easily and without ingesting\nin excess of calories also mauii venison\nis absolutely delicious I love their\nvenison steaks their ground venison I\nlove their bone broth and I love their\njerky which is extremely convenient when\nyou're traveling those mauii venison\nturkey sticks have 10 g of highquality\nprotein per stick at just 55 calories\nwhile Maui Nei offers the highest\nquality meat available their supplies\nare limited responsible management of\nthe access deer population on the island\nof Maui means that they will not go\nbeyond Harvest capacity so signing up\nfor a membership is the best way to\nensure access to their highquality meat\nif you'd like to try Maui Nei venison\nyou can go to Maui NE venison\ndocomond to get 20% off your membership\nor first order again that's m new\nvenison\ndocomo today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes\nSmart mattress covers with cooling\nHeating and sleep tracking capacity now\nI've spoken many times before in this\npodcast about the critical need for us\nto get adequate amounts of quality sleep\neach night one of the best ways to\nensure a great night's sleep is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's because in order\nto fall and stay deeply asleep your body\ntemperature actually has to drop by\nabout 1 to 3° and in order to wake up\nfeeling refreshed and energized your\nbody temperature actually has to\nincrease by about 1 to 3° eight sleep\nmakes it incredibly easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nby allowing you to program the\ntemperature of your mattress cover at\nthe beginning middle and end of the\nnight I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep\nmattress cover for well over 3 years now\nand it has completely transformed my\nsleep for the better eight sleep\nrecently launched their newest\ngeneration pod cover the Pod 4 ultra the\nPod 4 ultra has improved cooling and\nheating capacity higher fidelity sleep\ntracking technology and it also has\nsnoring detection that remarkably will\nautomatically lift your head a few\ndegrees to improve your air flow and\nstop your snoring if you'd like to try\nan eights Sleep

eights\nsleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by waking up waking up is\nmeditation app that offers hundreds of\nguided meditation programs mindfulness\ntrainings yoga NRA sessions and more I\nstarted practicing meditation when I was\nabout 15 years old and it made a\nprofound impact on my life and by now\nthere are thousands of quality\npeer-reviewed studies that emphasize how\nuseful mindfulness meditation can be for\nimproving our Focus managing stress and\nanxiety improving our mood and much more\nin recent years I started using the\nwaking up app for my meditations because\nI find it to be a terrific resource for\nallowing me to to really be consistent\nwith my meditation practice many people\nstart a meditation practice and\nexperience some benefits but many people\nalso have challenges keeping up with\nthat practice what I and so many other\npeople love about the waking up app is\nthat it has a lot of different\nmeditations to choose from and those\nmeditations are of different durations\nso it makes it very easy to keep up with\nyour meditation practice both from the\nperspective of novelty you never get\ntired of those meditations there's\nalways something new to explore and to\nlearn about yourself and about the\neffectiveness of meditation and you can\nalways fit meditation into your schedule\neven if you only have two or three\nminutes per day in which to meditate I\nalso really like doing Yoga Nidra or\nwhat is sometimes called non-sleep deep\nrest for about 10 or 20 minutes because\nit is a great way to restore mental and\nphysical Vigor without the tiredness\nthat some people experience when they\nwake up from a conventional nap if you'd\nlike to try the waking up app please go\nto waking up.com huberman where you can\naccess a free 30-day trial again that's\nwaking up.com huberman to access a free\n30-day trial and now for my discussion\nwith Dr Stacy Sims Dr Stacy Sims welcome\nthanks our podcast and I put out a lot\nof content about Nutrition\nFitness cold exposure heat exposure\nhydration topics that are very near and\ndear to your heart and for which you\nhave a ton of expertise but for which\nyou have an extra degree of expertise as\nit relates to females specific\nyeah so I'm excited to talk to you today\nbecause very often I will get questions\nin the comment section on social media\nor on\nYouTube was this study done in both men\nand women how does it differ for men\nversus women and on and on and I rarely\nif ever have answers but you have\nanswers I have answers for you great so\njust to kick things off because this is\na question I get really\noften fasting oh yeah inter ment fasting\ny we need to distinguish between the two\nof\ncourse perhaps the most common question\nI get as it relates to males versus\nfemales\nis is intermittent fasting or\ntime-restricted feeding as it's\nsometimes called an 8 Hour feeding\nwindow a six-hour feeding window a\n10-hour feeding window is that something\nthat perhaps differs in terms of its\nimpact and how well it works for men\nversus women yeah that's a short answer\ngreat yeah yeah um so I'll put some\nparameters around it right so if we talk\nabout intermittent fasting that's where\nyou have like the 20-hour non-feeding\nwindow or you're holding a fast until\nnoon or\nafter um and then we have\ntime-restricted eating and that's the\nfancy way of saying normal eating where\nyou're having breakfast and then you\nstop eating after or you don't have\nanything after dinner right so you're\neating with your circadian rhythm during\nthe day if we look at intermittent\nfasting where you're holding the fast up\ntill noon or you're having days of\nreally low calorie restriction we see in\nactive women it's very detrimental\nunless you have PCOS or you have some\nother\nsubclinical issue and the reason for\nthat is we as women have more oxida\nfibers so we hear about all the things\nabout fasting to be to improve our\nmetabolic flexibility to improve telal\nlength to improve parasympathetic\nactivation but by the nature of women\nhaving more oxidated fibers we are\nalready metabolically more flexible than\nmen interesting yeah didn't know that um\ncould you elaborate on more oxidative\nfibers what that is and how how it\nrelates to metabolic flexibility sure\nsure so oxidated fibers are are muscle\nfibers that are more aerobic capacity so\nthose are the ones that you you can go\nlong and slow for a very long period of\ntime because it uses a lot of free fatty\nacids you need a little bit of glucose\nin order to activate those free fatty\nacids so we look when a woman starts to\nexercise she goes through blood glucose\nfirst and then gets into free fatty acid\nuse she doesn't tap so much into liver\nmuscle glycogen which is I think another\nmisconception that happens so when we're\ntalking about fasting or fasted workouts\ntrying to improve that metabolic\nflexibility it increases stress on the\nwoman and so when we're talking about\noverall stress we're talking about\ncortisol increase and they can't hit\nintens high enough with no fuel to be\nable to invoke the post exercise\nresponses of growth hormone and\ntestosterone which then drop cortisol so\nfrom an overall stress perspective that\nfast did work out and holding that fast\nfor a long period of time increases\ncortisol but then when we look from like\na hypothalamic point of view and we're\nlooking at how the brain reads it we\nknow that there's one area of kisspeptin\nneurons in the brain for men but there\nare two for women so the two areas are\ndistinct where One controls appetite and\nluteinizing hormone and the other one is\nlooking at estrogen and thyroid so if\nyou start having an exercise stress or a\ndaily stress of getting up and going on\nwith your day without fuel you perturb\nthose kisspeptin neurons and\ndownregulate them and so when you start\ndownregulating them we see that after\nfour days you have a a disregulation of\nthyroid we have a change in our\nluteinizing hormone pulse which is\nreally important to maintain endocrine\nfunction and we'll hear this oh I've\nbeen fasting for so many years and it\ndoes great for me but the other side of\nthe question is well how much better\nwould you be if you were to actually pay\nattention to your circadian rhythm and\nfuel according to the stress at hand and\nknowing that you're going to Garner less\nstress that way and if we're really\ntying in nutrition according to that\nprofile instead of following a fast we\nsee better brain Improvement ments as\nwell we see more cognitive function we\nsee less thyroid\ndysfunction and overall a woman does\nmuch better when we're not in that\nfasted State then when you look at\npopulation research that's coming out\nnow they're showing in both men and\nwomen who hold their Fest till noon and\nthen have an eating window from noon to\nmaybe 6: p.m. have more obesogenic\noutcomes than people who break their\nfast at 8 and finished their eating\nwindow by 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. so it's\ncoming back to the chronobiology of we\nneed to eat when our body is under\nstress and needs it unless we have a\nspecific issue like obesity inactivity\nPCOS or other metabolic conditions then\nwe can look at using fasting as a\nstrategic intervention to help with\nthose modalities super interesting two\nquestions is there a protective effect\nof starting the eating window and here\nI'm asking for both men and women\nstarting the eating window at say 11:00\na.m. or noon and ending it a little bit\nlater so not a 6our eating window or 7h\nhour eating window but extending that to\n8 or 900 p.m. under those conditions do\nyou still see the obesogenic effect yes\nbecause we're looking at the way\ncortisol responds we know cortisol has\nlots of fluctuations throughout the day\nand it Peaks about half an hour after\nyou wake up right so if you're having\nthat quol Peak half an hour after you\nwake up but you're not eating\nthen that is that higher Baseline\nsympathetic drive for women for men it's\nnot the same so when we're looking at\nthat obesogenic outcome the actual\ntiming hasn't been tested yet to see how\ncan we ex expand or contract that eating\nwindow for men but for women because of\nthat cortisol\nPeak that right after waking up women\ntend to be already sympathetically\ndriven so then they walk around more\ntired but wired and have a really really\ndifficult time ACC accessing any kind of\nparasympathetic responses down the way\nwhere if you have something really small\nwhere you're bringing blood sugar up\nthen it's signaling to the hypothalamus\nhey yeah there's some nutrition on board\nthen we can start our day so again it\nhas to look at that circadian rhythm and\nthose hormone fluxes which people don't\nreally either understand or talk about\nbecause all of our hormones flux through\nthe day and so you have to look at\nwhere's the peak of cortisol how does\nestrogen flux how does lutenizing\nhormone flux progesterone all these\nthings that have this tight interplay\nand the more we're doing the hormone\nresearch and the more we're\nunderstanding these perturbations and\nhow important it is to fuel for it to\nstay out of any kind of low energy\navailability\nstance regular listeners of this podcast\nwill know this but just to remind\neverybody a sympathetic state has\nnothing to do with emotional sympathy\nit's the sympathetic arm of the\nautonomic nervous system which drives\nmore arousal and alertness and at higher\nlevels stress sometimes called the fight\nORF flight response parasympathetic\nbeing the other arm of the autonomic\nnervous system sometimes called the rest\nand digest arm of the autonomic nervous\nsystem they work sort of like a seesaw\nor a push pull pick your analogy in any\ncase it sounds like intermittent fasting\nor time-restricted feeding unless it's\nvery well aligned to the Circadian\nrhythm is not going to be advantageous\nfor women that's what I'm hearing I'm\nalso hearing that if a woman trains\nwhile fasted so in the non-feeding\nwindow so wakes up maybe has some uh\nhydration and trains that's going to\nfurther exacerbate the stress response\nin a way that's not going to be good\nexactly\nand I have to imagine that if she also\nis drinking caffeine in order to do that\ntraining because caffeine is a stimulant\nof the sympathetic arm of the autonomic\nnervous system that it will further\nexacerbate all these issues so this is a\nopener for me because I've had female\ntraining partners for years I don't eat\nuntil 11:00 a.m. I like to hydrate and\ncinate before I train in the morning and\nthen I like to eat starting around\nnoon several of them have hopped on that\nschedule with me some of them eat\nbreakfast first some of them don't they\ndo as they choose of course but now I'm\nthinking that's probably the worst way\nto go and it gets worse as you get older\nbecause if we're seeing as women are\ngetting into par menopause which is in\ntheir 40s and we have more fluctuation\nof those hormones and an increase in\nBaseline cortisol anyway then when you\nlook at fasted training it increases\nthat cortisol drive and that sympathetic\ndrive and because it's a point where you\nreally need to polarize your training to\nget any kind of body composition change\nnot having any fuel before a\nhigh-intensity workout puts them in\nmoderate intensity they just can't hit\nthe intensities they need to same with\nresistance training like you go in and a\nlot of women are now working on\nsessional rpe or rating perceived\nexertion where you go in and say okay we\nneed you to hit an eight on this squat\nso you have two reps in reserve and a\nsessional RP of an eight well if they're\nnot fueled then we are seeing trends\nthat they're missing around two to 5% of\nthat top load so they're not really\nlifting in that zone that they need to\nbe in let's get um people sorry to\ninterrupt let's get people up to speed\non rpe because this is a term that's\nstarting to um circulate more outside\nthe physical um training community and\nto the broader kind of you know\nrecreational exerciser Community which I\nconsider myself part of UMO I mean I\ntrain regularly and half for years but\nI'm not an I'm not an athlete I don't\nget paid to train and I you know and so\nforth so rep repsen Reserve perceived\neffort maybe just um explain this I\nthink probably 95% of our listenership\nhas never heard these terms okay so if\nwe're talking about about reps in\nreserve this is when you go in and if\nyou say eight it means you have two reps\nin reserve so you finish your eight and\nyou should be able to complete two more\nwith a really good form and then you hit\nfailure\nso eight repetitions in good form and\nthe person doing the exercise could in\ntheory if they really dug in there grit\ntheir teeth could complete two more\nrepetitions in good form before hitting\nfailure the inab ility to move the\nweight anymore in good form exactly okay\nbut they're stopping at eight so they\nhave two reps in reserve exactly and so\nwe can correspond that with your rating\nperceived exertion so if we're saying we\nneed you to hit an eight on our scale of\n1 to 10 of rating perceived exertion we\nsee it correlates with um that eight\nwith two reps in reserve so it's a way\nof quantifying what you're doing in the\nmoment for a squat or a deadlift or some\nother really heavy lift that you're\ntrying to accomplish as opposed to\nlooking at um say percentage of one\nrepetition maximum yeah saying you're\ngoing to move 70% of your one repetition\nmaximum for six repetitions seems like\nthat's a great thing as well but it's a\nlittle bit more complicated because you\nneed to know your one repetition maximum\ndoing one repetition maximums can be\ndangerous if you're not skilled in that\nespecially with compound movements like\nsquats and deadlifts okay so is there an\nacross theboard recommendation for most\npeople that they should generally train\ntheir sets in good form to failure to\nleave a couple reps in reserve what do\nyou suggest for let's say women but this\ncould also pertain to men uh and then\nthat also depends on the age of the\nwoman so if we're looking at the\nreproductive year so you know 20 to 40\nthen it doesn't matter so much you can\nperiodize pretty much how normal\nperiodization works with your mesocycles\nand your micro Cycles so you're looking\nat what you're doing across the few\nmonths what are you doing in the week\nare you lifting heavy power Based\ntraining but when we start to get to per\nmenopause and we're losing all the flux\nof estrogen and estrogen is woman's\ntestosterone the key driver for strength\nand power we have to look at lifting\nheavy so this is where we really turn\nwomen on to we want you to do something\nthat is two reps in reserve three reps\nin reserve because your one rep max also\nchanges depending on what kind of\ntraining block you're doing so you're\nfinding that when you're talking about\nreps in reserve then it allows people to\nlift more on the day so we can get women\nto get into that strength and\npower-based type training rather than\ngoing let's lift to fatigue because then\nit might be 20 reps and that 20 reps\ndoesn't invoke a big central nervous\nsystem response which is what we want\nit's more of that hypertrophy and muscle\ntearing you will gain some lean mass but\nnot as much strength as if you were to\ninvoke That central nervous system\nresponse and that becomes really\ncritical as women get older because we\nneed to def find that external response\nthat's going to cause the same kind of\nstrength and power adaptation that\nestrogen used to support\ninteresting lots to talk about in terms\nof exercise but before we move on if the\nbad situation is a woman\nfasting drinking caffeine and training\nintensely but as you told us not as\nintensely as she would be able to\notherwise what's the solution I imagine\nthat solution involves ingesting some\nfuel m what is a good example of a you\nknow a\npre-training um meal if you will and we\ncould put some variation on that for\npeople with different you know\nTendencies towards omnivore or vegan or\nwhatever uh but what is the timing of\nthat meal relative to training that\nworks best or and and I'm assuming\nthere's some flexibility there yeah I\nmean like I'm the kind of person that\ngets up and is out the door within a\nhalf an hour to go do whatever I'm going\nto do so it's not like I'm going to have\na full meal I've heard of people like\nyou yeah mean meaning I tend to move\nslowly in the morning so I wish I could\nbut the way my life is it doesn't work\nthat way um so but I'm also one of the\npeople that never really has an appetite\ntill 11 o'clock okay so we're similar in\nthat way yeah so how do you how do you\nsquare that so I make a double espresso\nat night and I put some almond milk and\na scoop of protein powder in there so\nthe almond milk is sweetened and usually\nit's unsweetened but sweetened for the\ncarb and then the protein powder for the\nprotein because because if I'm going to\ngo do an ocean swim then I need some\ncarbohydrate and protein on board if I'm\ngoing to just go to the gym then I'll\nprobably just have the protein powder in\nthe coffee yes I'm caffeinating but I'm\nalso getting the calories for the\nhypothalamus and getting more\ncirculating amino acids Abby Smith Ryan\nout of UNCC did some specific work\nlooking at carbohydrate protein before\nand you know strength or cardio and\nfound that if you're going to do a true\nstrength training session you only need\naround 15 grams of protein before before\nyou go to really help you get into the\nidea that yes you have some fuel on\nboard and also increases your post\nexercise oxygen consumption or your\nEpoch so your resting metabolism stays\nelevated um giving you a better chance\nfor Recovery post exercise as well if\nyou're going to do any kind of\ncardiovascular type work up to an hour\nthen you're adding 30 grams of carp to\nthat so it's not a lot of food and it's\nnot a full meal um other people are like\nI'm starving right before I go training\nthen yes you can have your meal giving\nyourself about a half an hour before um\nbut it doesn't have to be major food\nthat we're talking about um but that's\njust enough to bring blood sugar up and\nand stimulate the hypothalamus to say\nyeah there's some nutrition coming in\nand then you have your real food\nafterwards you have your breakfast\nafterwards within 45 minutes as a\nneuroscientist I find it so interesting\nthat at least some of what you're\ntalking about with this pre-workout meal\nand perhaps most of it relates to how\ningesting those\ncalories impacts the brain protects\nthose\nkisspeptin neurons we'll talk more about\nkisspeptin very interesting\npeptide as opposed to saying okay you\nneed X number of calories because you're\ngoing to burn X number of calories I\nhate that conversation right which is a\nvery different conversation um here what\nwe're talking about is the neural\naspects of being able to generate\nintensity also blunt cortisol and get\nthe most out of training without putting\nthe body into kind of a an Emergency\nState yeah yeah and the longer someone\nwithholds food after exercise and the\ngreater they stay in that catabolic or\nbreakdown State the more the brain\nperceives it as being in a low energy\nstate so the first thing to go is lean\nmass when you start telling a woman that\nyou know if you're going to do fasted\ntraining and and or you're going to\ndelay food intake afterwards while\nyou're training because the first thing\nthat goes is lean mass and it's really\nreally hard for women to put on lean m M\nso once you start really nailing that\nand then saying look you just need 15\ngram of protein to really help and be\nable to conserve that lean mess it's a\nsmall simple fix people try it and\nthey're like oh my gosh I feel amazing\nso it's small little things when you're\nworking with the whole system because I\nget tired especially around Christmas\ntime when you're reading all the\nmagazines it's like two cookies means\nyou have to walk for 30 minutes on the\ntreadmill it's like it doesn't it\ndoesn't correlate like that at all um so\nthat's why I was like like I hate the\ncalorie conversation because it's just\nnot applicable right and it has its own\nkind of um elements of being laced with\nneuroticism about calorie counting and\nthen that can drift easily into the\nrealm of Eating Disorders I did an\nepisode about eating disorders some\nyears ago and as I was researching that\nepisode um I learned that people with\neating disorders women and men um\nespecially anorexia become like calorie\ncalculators their eyes in their brain\njust are constantly evaluating the\ncaloric load of food and it can be um\nobviously very intrusive it's also the\nmost deadly of all the psychiatric\nconditions so it's um that's a long way\nfrom hopefully what we're talking about\nhere but but there's the opportunity for\ndrift whenever we talking about calorie\ncounting in and out we of course believe\nin the laws of thermodynamics and\ncalories in calories out but I love what\nyou're describing here as getting the\nbrain in a mode that the brain and body\nare protected so that one can invest in\nthat high-intensity exercise and get the\nadaptations that one wants but not send\neverything down this pathway of um kind\njust becoming a computer of you know how\nmuch am I exercising what did I burn\nwhat did I earn it's it's crazy it's\ncrazy um as long as we're talking about\nfood and food intake relative to\ntraining what is the suggested\nposttraining\num window um in which one should either\navoid or make sure they get nutrition um\nmeaning how long does one have after\nlet's say a resistance training session\nof about an hour seems to me that's what\nmost people are doing if they're\ninvesting in resistance training maybe\nplus or minus a what 20 minutes yeah um\nand they're hitting those um\nhigh-intensity sets where they have\nmaybe just one or two repetitions in\nreserve maybe going to failure on a few\nof those SES what do you recommend women\neat after they train so we know that\nwomen who are in their reproductive\nyears need around 35 grams of good\nprotein high quality Lucine oriented\nprotein within 45 minutes and we see\nthat women who are per menopausal\nonwards are 40 to 60 grams because we\nbecome more anabolically resistant to\nfood and exercise as we get older um\nwhen we look at like the recovery window\nfor food there are definitely sex\ndifferences because we hear all the\nconversation of there's no recovery\nwindow it's you know it's old science\nbut we look at the research of when\nwomen's metabolisms come back down to\nBaseline meaning that they have constant\nstraight blood sugar levels versus men\nwomen it's within UH 60 minutes and for\nmen it's up to 3 hours so when we're\nlooking at the data that says there's no\nwindow per se for getting food in it's\nbased on male data so when we're looking\nat women women we have this tighter\nwindow to stop that breakdown effect and\nstart the\nreparation um so yeah it's like when\nwe're talking about the protein intake\nit's really important not only to get\nthat Lucine content up in the muscle to\nstart the reparation and repair but also\nagain to signal that yeah we're in a\nbuilding State we're not holding that\ncatabolic State and increasing all the\nrepercussions that come with it so women\nshould try and get 30 or as M much as 40\nmaybe 50 grams of protein depending on\ntheir age m post training within an hour\nof training yep men seem to have a\nlonger window they could wait an hour\ntwo hours maybe even three hours yeah\nbefore ingesting protein what about\ncarbohydrate we look at mixed but for\nmen it's more important because they go\nthrough their liver and muscle glycogen\nso much faster than women so when we\nlook at women we want to get around3\ngrams per kilo um of carbohydrate within\n2 hours of finishing so we look at prot\nand people like well that's a big dose\nof protein how do I get it all in it's\nlike yeah well you can look at how we\nmix all of these things you're also\ngetting carbohydrate in with that so\nthat's why I say you could have your\nnext meal after your training session um\nyeah there's a time and a place for\nprotein supplementation but if you're\ngetting that real food in then you're\nalso getting you know your magnesium and\nyour potassium and your sodium and all\nthe things that people supposedly lose\nand you're able to also repair a lot\nbetter\nas many of you know I've been taking ag1\nfor more than 10 years now so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring this\npodcast to be clear I don't take ag1\nbecause they're a sponsor rather they\nare a sponsor because I take ag1 in fact\nI take ag1 once and often twice every\nsingle day and I've done that since\nstarting way back in 2012 there is so\nmuch conflicting information out there\nnowadays about what proper nutrition is\nbut here's what there seems to be a\ngeneral consensus on whether you're an\nomnivore a carnivore or a vegetarian or\na vegan I think it's generally agreed\nthat you should get most of your food\nfrom unprocessed or minimally processed\nsources which allows you to eat enough\nbut not overeat get plenty of vitamins\nand minerals probiotics and\nmicronutrients that we all need for\nphysical and mental health now I\npersonally am an omnivore and I strive\nto get most of my food from unprocessed\nor minimally processed sources but the\nreason I still take ag1 once and often\ntwice every day is that it ensures I get\nall of those vitamins minerals\nprobiotics Etc but it also has\nadaptogens to help me cope with stress\nit's basically a nutritional insurance\npolicy meant to augment not replace\nquality food so by drinking a serving of\nag1 in the morning and again in the\nafternoon or evening I cover all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nreport feeling much better in a number\nof important ways such as energy levels\ndigestion sleep and more so while many\nsupplements out there are really\ndirected towards obtaining one specific\noutcome ag1 is found ational nutrition\ndesigned to support all aspects of\nwell-being related to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink a1.com huberman to\nclaim a special offer they'll give you\nfive free travel packs with your order\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman at some point there was a lot\nof discussion about training fasted\nburns more body fat uh I think now most\npeople accept that that's not the case\nthat perhaps the percentage of fat as\nfuel is increased when one trains fasted\nbut that overall in terms of loss of\nbody fat it doesn't matter if you train\nfasted or you train fed correct okay I\nthink um that can't be stated Enough by\nexperts like you um that doesn't mean\nthat if one prefers to train fasted or\nwith a minimum of food in their gut that\nthey can't do that I like to train\nfasted but I what I'm hearing is that\nwomen should probably ingest at least\nsome protein high quality protein and\nmaybe drink the protein in a protein\nshake yeah um form if they don't want to\ningest solid food yeah I think the\neasiest way for people to understand the\nbasic idea of what low energy is and how\nthis affects men and women is when we're\nlooking at um a Tipping Point for\nendocrine dysfunction for men we're\nseeing that Tipping Point at 15 calories\nper kilogram of fat-free mass for women\nit's 30 so when we're looking at\nBaseline calorie needs before you really\nget into that endocrine dysfunction when\nyou're looking at those parameters you\ncan see why men do better in a fasted\nstate or a low calorie state but for\nwomen our intake and especially our\ncarbohydrate needs are so much higher\nbecause we have so many other functions\nthat are reliant on that kisspeptin up\nregulation or down regulation preferably\nup regulation um so when we're just\ntalking the basic calorie needs and what\nwe're seeing it's that dichotomy right\nthere of 15 to 30 and when you start\ntelling people that they're like oh okay\nI get it is that a biological aspect\nit's like well you could trace it all\nthe way back where you know men went out\nto get the calories in most tribes and\nthe women were home and it wasn't\nadvantageous to be pregnant under low\ncalorie intake that's why you have\ndysfunction when the calories are too\nlow but you know you can also feed\nforward to modern day now and you're\nseeing that all this perturbance of\nhormone and the way we regulate hormone\nacross the Circadian rhythm requires\nmore calories for women than it does for\nmen I know some men that basically don't\neat all day and then eat one meal in the\nevening and they'll train in the morning\nthat's inconceivable to me because\nwithin an hour or so of training I'm\nhungry uh which brings to mind what we\nmean when we say training uh I'm a big\nbeliever in people everybody getting\nideally two or three resistance training\nsessions in per week and two maybe three\ncardiovascular training sessions per\nweek that would be ideal yep um one\ncould potentially do more probably not a\nwhole lot less before you run into\nlong-term health issues that you could\noffset but I think most people can fit\nthose in and I'm very frankly delighted\nthat nowadays there's such a push for\nwomen and men to resistance train that\nwasn't the case when I was growing up\nfor you know I recall taking my sister\nto the gym for the first time and was\nlike I think she was the only woman in\nthe gym when we were in high school yeah\nexcept for a few female bodybuilders and\nshe said well I don't want to look like\nthat and I said well don't worry you're\nnot going to look like that um but now\nyou go to a gym and women are lifting\nweights men are lifting weights it's\ngreat it's terrific I've seen the\nevolution right when I was 16 one of my\nfriends Brothers was a bodybuilder and\nhe took us to the gym of like what you\ndid with your sister and so both of us\nwere like well we want to beat those\nguys so we got into weight training with\nthem not to be bodybuilder but it's been\nlike the Paramount throughout all of my\nathletic career used to be I'd be the\nonly woman on the lifting platform and\nnow it's like you have to wait because\nthere's so many women on the lifting\nplatforms I love it it's great yeah it's\nawesome as I mentioned before I've had\nfemale training partners and they they\nkill it yeah they um it's a lot of fun\nto have a um female training partner\nalso because\num not only is it cool to see the\nprogress they can make really quickly\nwhich surprises them often you know I\nthink a lot of women think that okay\nit's going to require external androgens\nor it's going you know and and what you\npointed out that there are some barriers\nto women putting on mass quickly I think\nI've noticed that strength increases can\ncome really quickly why is that it's a\ncentral nervous system aspect there's a\nlot of like if we look at the culture of\nhow a lot of us grew up and I'm saying\nus like 45 plus right the women were all\nthe 90s supermodels don't show muscle\nthat kind of stuff so always been\ngravitated to cardio even now if you go\nto a gym and you're a new member you're\nsigning up for a new member and you're a\nwoman they'll say hey great here's all\nof our spin classes and our box fit\nclasses they're still doing that yeah\nand there's a cardiovascular machines a\nguy comes in like all right how much do\nyou want to put on here are the lifting\nplatforms all the you know the weight\ntrainings at the back starting to see a\nshift with Boutique type gems but that's\nstill the commonality there so it's\nstill that little bit of taboo so when\nwomen start strength training they\nhaven't been exposed to that kind of\ncentral nervous system stress before and\nthe whole aspect of getting the nerve\nand the acetylcholine which are are\nlittle vesicles that you know hold the\nability for the nerve to actually\nstimulate the muscle fiber all that gets\ntrained really quickly so the more that\nyou train it and the more muscle fibers\nthat are recruited for contraction you\nsee an increase in strength really\nrapidly and slowly building on that for\nincreased muscle bulk because it takes a\nlong time for women to put bulk on uh\nbecause the driver for strength training\nis that Central Nervous System um so\nit's great when we see higher doses more\nvolume we aren't seeing huge hypertrophy\nwe're just seeing really good increases\nin strength whenever somebody male or\nfemale is concerned about growing too\nbig too fast um I always remind them\nthat resistance training is unique among\ndifferent types of exercise in that\nbecause of the blood flow to the muscle\nduring the exercise session the soc\ncalled pump yeah you get a window a\ntransient window but a window\nnonetheless of what the hyper could look\nlike if you do everything else correctly\nin terms of recovery so provided that\nthe um the size of the muscle during the\ntraining session is not aversive to you\nyeah you're okay you're good yeah um\nwhich is unique among you know training\nit's not like when you go running you\nget a sense of being much faster you\nactually get the opposite effect you you\nfeel the burn in your lungs and and the\npain of of hitting the wall of your\nlimits and then hopefully if the\nadaptation takes place then you can push\npast that next time but with resistance\ntrain you get a liter Lally a physical\npicture and a and a sematic feeling for\nwhat that hypertrophy could look like\nyeah that's why on your physique\ncompetitions and bodybuilding\ncompetitions they're out the back\npumping before they go on stage so we've\nbeen talking about training but we\nhaven't really spelled out what you\nwould suggest a\nnovice perhaps an intermediate um\nresistance training cardiovascular\ntraining um program would look like in\nin Broad terms I realize we don't have\ntime here to get into all the DET you WR\nthis elere and refer people to those\nteric resources and the show note\ncaptions but um what would you like to\nsee women doing and maybe we can break\nup the the age brackets because it\nsounds like this is something that um is\nresurfacing again and again here um\nwomen let's say 30 and younger women 31\nto let's say 40 and then let's say 41 to\n60 and then maybe 61 and on in terms of\nhow many sessions of resistance training\nper week is it whole body training how\nmany sessions of cardiovascular training\nand what sorts of examples could could\nyou give yeah so if we're looking at\nthat 20 20 to 30 year old a lot of times\nI really try to get them to focus on the\nwhole movement aspect first so we phase\nthem in same with older women phase them\nin learn how to move learn complex\nmovements so that when you are going in\nto do resistance training preferably\nthree to four times a week you can look\nat moving well and it doesn't have to be\na long period of time if you're doing to\nfailure which works really well when\nyou're younger to increase strength and\na little bit of hypertrophy you're going\nto have to spend a little bit more time\nin the gym so it might be 45 to 60\nminutes when we're looking at doing that\nfour times a week you can add in a\nSprint interval training at the end of\none of those to get that super high\nintensity or you can look at putting in\nat the most two hit sessions from on\nseparate days if you're training\nspecifically for something so if I work\nwith a lot of endurance athletes still\nand they're like well how do I fit it in\nit's like okay well we look at the\nQuality and how that fits into your\ntraining so if you're training for a\nmarathon you're training for a triathlon\nor other endurance stuff you can take\nthat high-intensity work and put it into\nyour training program so ideally we look\nat three to four resistance training\nwith really good movement when we're in\nthe younger set with two high\nintensities when we start getting into\nour 30s we start having an eye to how\nare we actually doing that resistance\ntraining instead of just going and doing\na circuit we're really focusing on let's\ndo some compound movements let's look at\ndoing some heavier work let's look at\nhow we are periodizing so we're having\nyou know six we blocks and we're\nbuilding on those blocks because we want\nthat base foundation so when we get to\nbe 40 plus we can actually go and do our\npowerbase training if you're in your 40s\nyou've never done resistance training at\nall then we take\nbetween two weeks to four months to\nreally learn how to move well because\nthere's a higher incidence of soft\ntissue injury and overall injury as we\nget into our 40s because of\nperturbations of estrogen and ideally\nwhen we get there we're looking at that\naround three minimum three resistance\ntraining with compound movement\nand either one Sprint interval or two\nSprint intervals and one hit in a week\nand just to remind people compound\nmovements multi-joint movements squats\ndeadlifts uh chin-ups rows overhead\npresses bench presses Etc as opposed to\nisolation movements where only one joint\nis is moving yeah yeah and for everybody\nin all those age ranges that you\ndescribe are you suggesting they train\nthe same muscle groups three or four\ntimes per week or do some sort of split\nwhere it's upper body lower body take a\nday off or upper body take a day off\nlower body take a day off whatever that\nwhat might work for them yeah what works\nfor them if you're looking for short\namount of time in the gym because of\nbusy lives then you can split it if\nyou're looking at okay well I can\nallocate an hour to an hour and a half\nin the gym then you can do total body\nwith adequate rest um the key when\nyou're younger is working to failure the\nkey when you're older is working heavy\ninteresting yeah so when we're looking\nat working to failure we're trying to\nget more of that lean mass growth with\nstrength when we get older because it's\nso difficult to put on lean mass we\nreally want to focus on the strength\ncomponent because that becomes more\nimportant when we're talking about\nlongevity because if you're looking at\nthe strength component from a central\nnervous system standpoint we see it\nfeeds forward into better appropriate\nreception attenuation of cognitive\ndecline and this is the other thing that\nyou in Neuroscience would understand the\nsex differences in things like dementia\nand Alzheimer's there's some really\ninteresting research looking at strength\ntraining and that power-based stuff when\nwe're getting into our older ages\nbecause we get more neural growth\npatterns and more neural Pathways even\nsome interesting literature about\nemphasizing some unilateral movements as\npeople get older not just um dual limb\nmovements or dual limb simultaneous\nmovements you always want to train both\nsides of your body folks but um so if I\nunderstand correctly younger women\nshould train to failure try and generate\nstrength and hypertrophy as women get\nolder they should emphasize more\nstrength training leave some repetitions\nin reserve but train heavier yes it\nmakes so much sense what you're saying\nyeah um because what we know about the\nnervous system as we age is that there's\nsome atrophy or at least some weakening\nof neuromuscular connections and the\nupper motor neurons in the brain that\ncontrol the neuromuscular Connections in\nthe spinal cord out to the muscle yeah\num there's something really sticky about\nthis idea in terms of longevity that I\ndon't think anyone else has ever said no\nthe thing about it is men age more in a\nlinear\nfashion whereas women we have a\ndefinitive point in our late 40s early\n50s where all of a sudden things go to\n where it's that per menopausal\nState and I can't tell you how many\nemails and DMs I get in a day from women\nwho are like I'm 46 or I'm 47 I'm\nputting on body fat I don't know what's\ngoing on I can't sleep and then when we\nsay it's per menopause they like what is\nthat and so when we're looking at per\nmenopause it is a\nhuge change in the body because you're\nhaving less and less of your sex hormone\ncirculating more and more an ovulatory\nCycles means no progesterone or very low\nprogesterone you're having a difference\nin the pulse of your estrad to those\nFlatline aspect effects and because\nevery system in the body is affected by\nit this is why you see more soft tissue\ninjuries like two of the biggest things\nthat women who are in their 40s are\ngoing to ptas about her frozen shoulder\nand pler fascia those are two really\nindicative issues that are happening in\nParry menopause so that whole section of\nmid to mid 40s to early 50s is a\ndefinitive aging point where I really\ntried to get women to get into the heavy\nlifting and get into the patterns of\npolarizing their training not putting an\nemphasis on zone two just really looking\nat how am I polarizing how am I\naffecting my central nervous system so\nthat when they get into that one point\nin time of that per menopause their body\nis already conditioned for the stress\nthat's coming whereas men we see that\nkind of stuff happens in their late 50s\nearly 60s so the soft tissue injuries\nthe change in body comp comes at a later\ntime so yes looking at how we're scoping\nour strength\ntraining definitely something to think\nabout in a longevity Factor but for\nwomen it's a there's a better indication\nof the timing across the ages of when\nyou should start implementing for men I\nthink you have a better bandwidth of\nwhen you should start\nimplementing for women who are not on\nhormone replacement therapy and we did a\nprevious episode about per menopause\nmenopause and hormone replacement\ntherapy but if it comes up again and\nagain today that would be wonderful\nbecause these are important underd\ndiscussed topics\nabsolutely for women that are not on\nhormone replacement therapy who decide\nto train heavier maybe do a bit more\ntraining volume not train to failure\nthey're making sure to not let their\ncortisol Spike too much by making sure\nthey have some pre-workout nutrition\nsome post-workout\nnutrition would they be wise\nto be very careful in how much\ncardiovascular exercise they add to that\nmeaning\nthere seems to always be this risk of\novertraining and as you pointed out for\nvarious reasons cultural reasons\nhistorical reasons um around\nexercise I my observation is that most\nwomen sort of unless they know better\ndefault to cardiovascular exercise as\nopposed to resistance training so if a\nwoman in her 40s late 30s to let's say\n50 is doing two to four sessions of\nresistance training workouts per week\nand they also really like cardio or they\nfeel they want to or should do\ncardio should they be careful about how\nmuch cardio they're doing and is there a\nbest form of cardio should they really\nemphasize the high-intensity interval\ntraining should they avoid zone two we\nshould probably also Divine for people\nwhat zone two is if they if they don't\nalready know um so I am notorious for\nslamming things like orange theory and\nf45 because they mark it specifically to\nthat age group of women and it's not\nappropriate because it's not true\nhigh-intensity work when we're looking\nat women who are really trying to\nmaximize body composition change and\nLongevity and unfortunately default to\ncardio because they think oh that's\ngoing to help change my body composition\nis going to help me lose body fat it\ndoesn't is this things like Soul cycle\nas well okay I've never done any of\nthese yeah um but I imagine there's a\nlot of spinning a lot of moving a lot of\nsweating and a lot of quote unquote\ncalories burned emphasis yes there is\nbut it's it puts women squarely in\nmoderate intensity where they're so used\nto leaving one of those classes feeling\nabsolutely smashed that when you tell\nthem actually that training doesn't work\nfor you because it's putting you in a\nstate of intensity that drives cortisol\nup but it's not a strong enough stress\nto invoke the post exercise growth\nhormone and testosterone responses that\nwe want to dampen that cortisol so this\nis why we have that hyperbole of women\nwho are in their 40s plus shouldn't do\nhigh intensity work it's like well\nactually they shouldn't do moderate\nintensity they need to avoid that\npolarizing absolutely that's what we\nwant we want true high-intensity work\nwhich is 1 to four minutes of 80% or\nmore or if you're doing Sprint interval\nit's full gas for 30 seconds or less and\nyou're doing that a couple of times a\nweek you're not doing it every day\nbecause you need to have enough recovery\nto hit those intensities trly\nbecause those are the intensities that\nare going to give you those post\nexercise hormonal responses to drop\ncortisol when we're looking at women who\nare like oh well I love going out for\nhours and hours on my bike and I love\nyou know doing my spin classes it's like\nokay but we need to look at the big rock\nhere if you are looking for longevity\nand body composition change and\ncognition and all those things you have\nto polarize your training and that has\nto be the focus but soul food like I\ncome from a long background of endurance\nI now love riding my gravel bike on the\nweekends for long periods of time which\nis not optimal for me my age that kind\nof stuff for all the things that I want\nto see improvements in but mentally it's\ngreat so we talk about going out for\nthat long stuff zone two is at low\nconversation and that's fine for mental\nhealth and being out in nature but for\nOptimal Health and well-being we don't\nwant to do that we want to look at\nresistance training as a bedrock and\ntrue high-intensity work to help with\nbody composition change metabolic\ncontrol insulin sensitivity brain health\nand dropping that\ncortisol I have family members who are\nwomen who are thin because they love to\nwalk and they just walk a ton um and\nthey eat well um and enough\nbut they are resistant to resistance\ntraining and if they do pick up a weight\nit's usually some very light dumbbells\ndo a few curls a couple tricep\nextensions and aren't really um leaning\ninto the higher intensity work yeah I\nthink this is pretty common and my\nobservation is that it's common not\nbecause they couldn't be incentivized to\ndo the higher intensity work but that\nlearning the complex compound movement\nlike how to squat properly or even leg\npress properly y um deadlift properly\ncan be a bit overwhelming especially\nwhen one walks into a gym this is true\nfor men too like all this stuff all this\nequipment all these bodies and these\npeople look like they know what they're\ndoing it's like if I were to go into an\nadvanced like kitchen or or um Symphony\nand you know all these instruments I\ndon't know how to play yeah so what's\nthe best line of attack for somebody who\nreally wants to overcome this uh\nlongevity barrier because clearly\nresistance training proper nutrition\nwork yeah and the cardiovascular\nexercise piece is a little bit more\nintuitive walking you do it faster\nyou're jogging you do it faster you're\nrunning yeah yeah um the bike the soul\ncycle class Etc it's just it's easier in\nterms of the mechanics one can still get\nhurt but it's just more straightforward\nis there a way that in the absence of a\nbudget for a personal trainer that\nsomebody can learn how to do these\nmovements and as you said ease into them\nover the course of even up to four\nmonths in a way that they can be\nconfident that they're unlikely to get\nhurt yeah and really build up their\ncapacity to do real work that can\nbenefit them yeah this is where I love\ntechnology for one thing but if we're\nstaying really basic I look at some of\nmy family members and I've gotten them\nstarted with just body weight stuff or\nloading a backpack with cans to add a\nlittle bit of resistance so they feel\ncomfortable in their own house and they\nmight be doing lunges or squats um just\nkeying them up of like where foot\nplacement and knee and that kind of\nstuff so they're getting used to that\nkind of movement um I love Kelly\nstarett's stuff with Mobility so show\nthem like here's how we do some of the\nmobility to find where the sticking\npoints are and then you can either\ndirect them to some of the programs that\nare out there that um like Haley happens\nhas some really good ones for women or\n40 plus so does\num uh Brie and then Sunny Webster down\nin Australia\nyou can send in a video of what you're\ndoing and he can critique you and tell\nyou things to do there are other\nprograms like that too um so there's\nlots of ways of getting help if you seek\nit the personal trainer is very much a\nstumbling block for a lot of people and\nas much as I am not a fan of Planet\nFitness I am a fan of the fact that\nthey've made it really easy for someone\nto walk in who's interested in\nresistance training and they can go to a\ncircuit one of the circuit things that\nthey have at the back and they can start\nresistance training on machines which is\nanother level up to learning compound\nmovements so there's lots of ways of\nbreaking that barrier to entry you just\nhave to find the motivation factor of\nwhat's going to incentivize the person\nto give up their time walking every day\nand taking time to go to the gym or\ntaking time to do garage based stuff\nthat's going to improve their lean\nmass I'm a big fan of machines\nespecially plate loaded machines but\nmachines just create the close to\ncorrect or correct Arc of movement yeah\nthat um so for your size yeah yeah yeah\nexactly and to really spend the time\nadjusting the seat height adjusting the\nvarious um pins on the machine not just\nthe weight in order to make sure that\none gets the best range of motion I\nthink this is something small but that\nis significant in terms of its impact\npeople just pop down in a machine\nespecially if you're working in with\nsomebody and feel um especially\nbeginners will feel pressured to move\nquickly and they won't adjust the seat\nheight and so it's just all wrong for\nthem and all it takes is a little bit of\ntime to you know and ask people you know\nhow to adjust the machines I'm also a\nfan of kettle bells in in the garage or\nlight lighter dumbbells that you can do\nlike thrusters or hang cleans or\nsomething like that to get the the\nmomentum and movement feeling um because\nthat's another good learning curve for\npeople um so like I said there's lots of\nways that you can Implement Things based\non someone's intuitive like or dislike\nof resistance training so you've\nmentioned polarized training if I\nunderstand correctly this would be a\nwoman doing three or four days of\nhigh-intensity resistance training for\n45 to 60 or 45 to 75 minutes per session\nand then at the opposite\nextreme maybe just walking a lot or\njogging a lot so is that what you're\ntalking about polarized training as\nopposed to um these other forms of\ntraining where it's designed to get\npeople sweating like crazy breathing\nhard for long periods of time but\nneither putting them at the in the\nlandscape of inducing muscle strength\nadaptations and hypertrophy adaptations\nnor really taxing the cardiovascular\nsystem enough to create you know an\nincrease in longevity for instance when\nI talk about polarizing I look at the\nhigh-intensity strength like that's\nreally hard on the central nervous\nsystem and then we look from a\ncardiovascular standpoint of doing true\nhigh-intensity work so the walking is\nmore of the recovery so if you're going\nto go out and do something long it has\nto be very very easy if you are looking\nat cardiovascular and you want that big\nsweat then we are talking true Sprint\ninterval training so what I have a lot\nof women do is a 20 minute lower body\nheavy set and then they'll go on the\nassault but and do as hard as they can\nfor 30 seconds and then recover as much\nas they need to to go then do another 30\nseconds as hard as they can most people\ngo oh I can do four or five of those\nafter two they're completely gassed\nbecause it's that hard of work and\nthat's what I mean by polarizing you\nhave very very low intensity for\nrecovery and super super high intensity\nfor metabolic and cardiovascular changes\nis what we're after I'd like to take a\nquick break to let you know that the\nhuberman lab team has launched a new\npodcast with host Dr Andy Galpin Andy is\nan expert in exercise science and Human\nPerformance and has Longman a fan\nfavorite on the huberman Lab podcast\nthis new podcast is called perform with\nDr Andy Galpin and it dives into topics\nsuch as how to build muscle and strength\nhow to improve your cardiovascular\nhealth and how to optimize recovery and\nsleep for performance and much more Andy\nis an absolutely fantastic educator and\ntrue expert on all things human\nperformance I know you'll thoroughly\nenjoy his new podcast and learn a ton of\nuseful Knowledge from it so please check\nit out and give it a subscribe wherever\nyou're watching or listening to podcast\nnow again the podcast is called perform\nwith Dr Andy Galpin let's talk about the\nmenstrual cycle yeah and how that\nimpacts training at the level of\nPsychology and Physiology meaning Mo and\nof course the two are linked they're\ninextricably\nlinked for instance is there a\nparticular phase of the m cycle where a\nwoman should expect that motivation\nAndor recovery would be more\nchallenging so this is the sticky point\nof recent science because we see all\nthese research studies and met analyses\nthat are coming out of the sports\nscience literature saying that there is\nno effect of the menstrual cycle on\nanything when you look at that\npopulation it is specifically you menic\nwomen might have an a subject pool of 10\nif you're lucky 12 so this is women who\nhave quote unquote normal menstrual\ncycles humanic supposedly ovulating so\nthey have a definitive low hormone and\nhigh hormone phase and this is probably\nbecause these studies are being done on\nUniversity campuses with with college\nundergraduate women yes exactly yeah\nwhich is a typically is in a given age\nrange right okay and they look at\nperformance meaning that one point in\ntime and we know that psychologically\nyou can perform at any point in the\nmenstrual cycle unless you have\nsomething like heavy menstrual belief\num when we're looking at a higher touch\nand looking not only from a molecular\naspect but also pulling in mixed methods\nand looking at the qualitative we need\nwomen to track their own cycle and find\ntheir own patterns because we know that\nthere are times where you feel like crap\nand you can't push intensity but that\nmight be on day eight for one woman it\nmight be day 18 for another from a\nmolecular standpoint we know that theow\nhormone phase being day one is the first\nday of bleeding up through ovulation\nwhich is Midway through your\ncycle you have a greater capacity for\npulling in and accommodating stress\nphysical and mental stress so if we're\nlooking at doing heavier loads we're\nlooking at doing high intensity work\nwe're looking at\nmotivation then that low hormone phase\nis really optimal for trying to hit a PR\ntrying to hit a new speed because you\ncan take on that stress and you're\nimmune system handles it your muscles\nhandle it your core temperature\neverything handles it so for most women\nin the weeks before their period they're\ngoing to feel more robust except right\nup until the point of um of menstration\nor the inverse it is day one a bleeding\nup through midcycle that feel great yep\nthe sticky Point comes not every woman\novulates and this is a thing when we're\nlooking at will pop we have lifestyle\nstress we have nutrition stress we know\nthat women for the most part have four\nto five an ovulatory Cycles a year so\nthis is where when you're looking at\nthat high hormone phase we can't say\nyou're definitively in the high hormone\nphase so this is where we need women to\ntrack their own cycles and understand\ntheir own patterns because in an Ideal\nWorld we know that in the ludal phase\nthis is where where we have the most\nchange where we have a pro-inflammatory\nresponse from the immune system we have\nuh inability to access carbohydrate as\nwell we have a higher sympathetic drive\nso there's lots of things in there that\naren't so fantastic for accommodating\nstress so broadly speaking the ludal\nphase is associated with more\ncortisol more kind of Baseline levels of\nstress would it makes sense for a woman\nto try and offset some of that with a\nbit more nutrition during that phase a\nbit more perhaps complex carbohydrate we\nknow that some complex carbohydrate can\nblunt some of the cortisol response\nmaybe just even a little bit more\nattention to eating yeah absolutely I\nmean core temperature goes up but the\nwhole goal of the ludal phase is to\nbuild tissue so this is where we're\nseeing a lot of shuttling of\ncarbohydrate and amino acids to go to\nbuild that endometrial lining and that's\nthe whole goal so yes you need to eat\nmore protein you need to eat more\ncarbohydrate but again the sticking\npoint is did you ovulate or not so if\nyou aren't aware of if you ovulate it or\nnot you're tracking your own patterns\nthen just be acutely aware that in about\nthe week before your next period comes\nyou really need to be amping up\ncarbohydrate and protein um because\nthat's going to help you hit intensities\nit's going to kind of level that playing\nfield especially on days where you feel\nlike you can really hit those\nintensities you feel great but then you\ngo to do something and your heart rate's\nhigher than it should be you don't feel\nthat that you can hit those if you're\noffsetting it with some increased\ncarbohydrate beforehand and you're going\nto hit it so it's again it's really\ndialing it back down to the individual\nnow because we don't have enough robust\nresearch to make generalized ideas\nbecause of the Nuance of have you\novulated or not what are your ratios of\nestrogen progesterone in that ludal\nphase so when we bring it back down to\nthe general pop it's like the best thing\nto do is to track your menstrual cycle\nover sleep over how you're feeling find\nyour own pattern patterns and dial in\nyour training in your days according to\nwhat your pattern\nis how hard should a woman push through\nthe mental and maybe even physical\nresistance to train less or not train\nduring a given phase of the cycle\ngetting depends on how she feels what we\ncan't rely on are things like heart rate\nvariability because we know that changes\nwith the autonomic nervous system change\nprogesterone it's a good indication that\nyou've ovulated because your heart rate\nvariability tanks but it's not a good\nindication of what your body can do if\nyou wake up I always say it's the\n10-minute rule you wake up and you feel\nawful and you're like uh I really want\nto do this workout but I don't know how\nit's going to go give yourself 10\nminutes if after 10 minutes you can't\nhit those intensities or you just feel\nhorrible change it drop it down do\nsomething that's more recovery do\nsomething that's not going to be so\ntaxing because we do have a limited\namount of that stress Acumen of how much\nstress we can handle so if you're going\nto try to exert it all in a high\nintensity work out what do you have left\nover for the rest of the day and then\nthat compounds because if you're always\nfighting it then you're going to\nincrease this Baseline sympathetic drive\nbecause you're fighting the training\nyou're fighting life so give yourself\nthat 10-minute roll if it happens three\ndays in a row that's okay because it's a\nvery short period of time it's not going\nto last forever so a lot of women have\nthis internal conversation of I have to\ndo this and it's really based on some\nkind of external they think everyone's\nwatching them but internally you don't\nhave to if you give yourself permission\nyou end up training better recovering\nbetter and getting better gains on the\nflip side if a woman is feeling\nspectacularly\ngood should she just really push it as\nhard as she can or is there anything\nabout the relationship between the\nhormone fluctuations of the menstrual\ncycle and feeling really really great\nthat training hard can somehow disrupt\nthe cycle and this is actually kind of\nthe uh the old lore um probably myth I\nwould imagine that high intensity\nresistance training is somehow\ndetrimental to female hormone Cycles I\ndon't think there's any evidence for\nthat but I hear that from time to time\num why do you think that myth came to be\nwhy do you think it propagates and what\ncan we do to extinguish it if in fact\nit's not true it's not true we see it\ncomes from a misstep and food intake and\nwe also see that it's a cultural\ninfluence because if we think about how\nsport started it started as a way for\nmen to demonstrate how powerful and\naggressive they are and this is the\noriginal Olympics right there are no\nwomen allowed and as we feed forward\ninto Sport and how it became okay for\nwomen to be\ninvolved at the high performance level\nif a woman walks in and shows any\nfallibility then she's immediately put\non a lower stool right no you can't you\ncan't play with the boys because you\nhave a menstrual cycle you're bleeding\nyou're a woman you're a delicate flower\nso women would walk into that\nprofessional sports space and be excited\nif they were a menic or didn't have\nperiods or they trained hard enough and\ntheir period went away because then they\nwere more like men and they could play\nwith the boys if you start bringing up\nmenstrual cycle in professional sport\nnow as of the past about four or five\nyears it's okay to talk about which is\nyou know what\n2020 so that myth of high-intensity\nresistance training causing issues with\nthe menstrual cycle one it's a cultural\nNuance for push back against women being\nin that space But then the reality is\nwomen weren't eating enough to\naccommodate for that stress which then\nfeeds forward to low energy availability\nmaybe relative energy deficiency in\nsport perturbations in all of our\nmenstrual cycle hormones so it's not the\nact of the high-intensity resistance\ntraining it's the act of not fueling\nappropriately for it and then getting\nthe okay to not have your period because\nyeah now you're you're in with you're\ntraining hard enough you've lost it\nyou're more like a\nman wow um very interesting history\nthere is it true then that if a woman\nmaintains either um caloric balance with\nher basically eating enough to support\nher energy output or even a slight\ncaloric Surplus that it's unlikely that\num her periods will cease even if she's\ntraining very hard very often correct so\nit basically boils down to calories in\ncalories out fuel for the task at hand\nbecause some people want to have a\nslight calorie deficit even in high\ntraining and if that deficit is at night\naway from training maybe 150 to 200\ncalories then it's going to help\nperpetuate body fat loss not lean mass\nloss and it's not going to interfere\nwith recovery it's the fueling in around\nthe stress\nmeaning they exercise stress it's really\nimportant but women have been so\nconditioned to not eat and not take up\nspace to be small you know all of these\nsociocultural things that women are\nafraid to admit the fact that they want\nto eat and they should be eating so this\nis a a a Nuance within the fitness\ncommunity that we're really trying to\nchange and get the mindset around you\ntrain hard you eat well and your body\nresponds in kind app tight body\ntemperature and hormones are very\ntightly linked yes they are um far too\ntightly for us to uh disentangle all of\nthose in a single conversation here but\nas you're describing the urgent need for\nwomen to fuel enough with the proper\nfuels to train hard enough to stimulate\nthe correct adaptations that they\nneed I imagine that the shift in\nappetite and body temperature that\noccurs across the menstrual cycle is\nalso going to play into this meaning\nthere will be phases of the menstrual\ncycle where women will be just naturally\nless motivated to eat enough\ncarbohydrate enough protein in order to\nget the most out of their training what\nphases of the menstrual cycle are those\num so that women can pay particular\nattention to make sure that they're\nfueling enough yeah um as estrogen\nstarts to come up right before ovulation\nthat estrogen surge really dampens\nappetite uh it also has a an interplay\nwith our appetite hormones which is part\nof the reason why we don't have that\ngreat of an appetite it holds after\novulation estrogen dips you get hungry\nit comes up and people are like I have\nsome Cravings which are driven by\nprogesterone because your body needs\nmore calories but at the same time with\nthe elevation of estrogen you're not\nhungry you have cravings but you're not\nhungry interesting yeah so it's trying\nto disconnect those it's like your\nappetite is something that will come\nback of course once you eat but Cravings\nare more of a of that psychological\ncapacity of yeah I my body needs more\nbut I'm not quite sure what so to get\nwomen to understand what's happening\nacross the board it's always coming back\nto Let's fuel appropriately for the\nexercise and even if you're not hungry\nif you are fueling appropriate\nappropriately at that point in time if\nyou end up with less at least you've\nstopped that breakdown State the\ncatabolic state so we don't get those\nperturbations in the hypothalamus that's\nmy biggest concern for women is really\ntaking care of that signaling from the\nbrain to the rest of the body and if we\nhave fuel on board even though we have\nappetite perturbations and if you go do\na really hard workout in the heat you're\nnot going to be hungry either but if\nyou're having a cold protein drink after\nthat hot workout you're taking care of\nthat immediate need to shut down the\nsignals that we need to break down\nthings let's talk about one of the many\nthird rails of um discussions online\nwhich is birth control yeah and we need\nto Define exactly what type of birth\ncontrol we're talking about because\nthere are so many different forms yes\nthere are iuds there are the copper iuds\nthere's the ring there's the you know\nlet's talk about oral contraceptives\nthat are designed to prevent ovulation\nso this is quote unquote the pill y so\nwe're being let's for now limit the\nconversation to that so that there isn't\nconfusion um share with us if you will\nyour thoughts on these how they impact\nany of the things that we're talking\nabout or anything else from that for\nthat matter can we have another history\nlesson please all right um I just gave a\ntalk at home to some young athletes on\ncontraception because someone might be\non the depot and if they're on it for\nmore than two years they get bone\nmineral density loss so then the\nquestion of okay how does the oral\ncontraceptive pill come up how does that\naffect things it's like well let's look\nat the history of it\ninitially came from Stanford was funded\nby um Katherine McCormick from McCormack\nfamily and a feminist activist Margaret\nSinger but because they were women they\ncouldn't get in the lab so they got a\nguy from Stanford to develop the pill\nand he's like you know what we need to\nput in a placebo week so that women feel\nlike they're having a bleed so if we're\nlooking at the three active pills and\nthen the one sugar pill week it was by\nDesign to make women feel like they are\nhaving control over their menstrual\ncycle and they would still have a bleed\nbut it's not a true bleed it's a\nwithdrawal bleed so this becomes the\nconfusing point for people who are on an\noral contraceptive pill they're like I\nget my period it's like no you don't\nbecause the idea of the hormones that\nare in an oral contraceptive pill is to\ndownregulate your ovarian function so\nthat you don't ovulate so you have a\nwhole different hormone profile from\nsomeone who naturally Cycles so this\ndepends on\nthe type of oral contraceptive pill you\nare using for the most part monophasic\nis the one that's most prescribed so\nthat means the three weeks of the active\npill is the same dose of estrogen\nprogesterone and then you have your\nsugar pill week or your withdrawal week\nand then you start again when we look at\nthe repercussions of using oral\ncontraceptive pill in active women\nthere's a higher amount of inflammatory\nresponses and oxidative responses so\nfrom a training standpoint no one's done\nthe study yet but I would be interested\nin doing this of looking at how that\nimpacts adaptation you do end up with a\nnew Baseline of this when you start\ntaking the pill but we're not really\nsure how that impacts adaptation we also\nlook at the progestin component of the\noral contraceptive pill because we have\nfour generations of\nprogesterone first generation was really\nhigh dose and has a lot of risk factors\nnot really prescribed that much second\ngeneration is the most prescribed and\nthis is the one that people just take\nit's in your IUD it's in your OC uh has\nthe least amount of side effects and\nthen we have a third and a fourth\ngeneration the fourth generation is\nprimarily used for women who have really\nbad PMS or pmdd which is your um\npremenstrual dysphoria Disorder so\nsignificant mood issues because that\nprogestin has a direct effect on a lot\nof the dopamine receptors in the brain\nas well the third generation is very\nandrogenic so we see that in in some\npreliminary research that improves speed\nand Power by the second week of intake\nbecause it's accumulated so when we're\nlooking directly at an oral\ncontraceptive pill we can't make\ngeneralizations because you have lowd\ndose high dose estrogen we see that a 30\nmicrogram dose increases hypertrophy but\nnot strength because estrogen increases\nthe satellite cell aspect ECT um so for\nmy power in Olympic athletes Olympic\nlifting athletes that's a detriment\nbecause they'll put on muscle mass but\nno strength so we've had to look at\nchanging their OC or getting them off\nfor women who have breakthrough bleeding\nthat higher incidence of or that higher\nintake of estrogen is is really\nbeneficial so we look overall at how it\nimpacts women from an athletic\nstandpoint it's so variable in the\nhormone profile that we can't make\ngeneralizations we only look at the very\nhigh performance athletes and what's\nhappening up there because that can make\nor break an athlete so from the general\ntouch point we don't know enough like\nthe beginning of this year 2024 there\nwas a study that came out looking at\nchanges in the amydala that happens with\noral contraceptive use it's reversible\nin adults but for young girls we don't\nknow because their brain is developing\nand unfortunately Physicians will pass\nout OC's as if it's candy OC's or a\ncontracep contraceptives and do you\nrecall what the direction of the effect\nwas on the amydala for those that don't\nrecall the amydala bilateral brain\nstructure meaning one on each side of\nyour brain uh literally means almond in\nLatin it's almond shaped and it's part\nof a larger Network associated with\nthreat detection um sometimes it's\ndescribed the locus of fear in the brain\nbut it's involved in a lot of other\nthings too both positive veilance and\nnegative alance but nonetheless is part\nof the um threat detection system\nelevated levels of\narousal which is why it's often\ndiscussed in the context of fear anxiety\nEtc it increased fear in women who were\non the OC oral contraceptive pill made\nthem less um willing to take\nchances and when they went off it\nthey're like why couldn't I do that\nbefore so that's why they started\nlooking at the Amala and when I say\nwe're looking at young girls and again\nwe don't know what's happening is it\nreversible in young girls that are put\non it or not because of the brain\nstructure changes that are happening um\nso when we talk about an oral\ncontraceptive pill I want people to\nunderstand that it has a significant\neffect on the body not just reproductive\nwe don't know enough about all the other\neffects so I have parents who say my\ndaughter wants to go on the oral\ncontraceptive pill she's having\nirregular periods she's a athlete we\nwant to be able to control it and it's\nlike if there's a issue with your\nmenstrual cycle now it's still going to\nbe there when you get off it so we have\nto look and see what what's going on\nhere if you're looking to get on it to\ncontrol your menstrual cycle why because\nwe know that you can have an increase in\nyour V2 Max and other an anerobic\ncapacity when you are not on it so you\nhave a better top end capacity when\nyou're not being blunted by these\nhormones and then the other conversation\nis oh my skin it's like well they have\nreally good Dermatology that can help\nyou with that you don't have to go on an\noral contraceptive pill but\nunfortunately GPS don't understand all\nof that and if a girl comes in and says\nI'm having irregular Cycles heavy\nmenstrual bleeding I want to go on the\nOC here you go so it is a huge\nconversation still we had um I put it in\nthe same category as menopause hormone\ntherapy because there isn't enough\nresearch to address all the population\nneeds and we see these big pendulum\nswitches so before it was like everyone\nbe on the OC and now it's like maybe not\nand then it was no one be on menopause\nhormone therapy everyone should be on it\nbut we need to land in the middle and\nunderstand more of what's happening with\nthese exogenous hormones is there any\nevidence that other forms of female\ncontraception can be let's just say\nproblematic for the types of things\nwe're discussing today like the implant\nin the Depot or IUD copper IUD copper I\nand the Marino or you know your\nprogestin laced IUD those are what a lot\nof my tactical athletes will use\nbecause it doesn't have a systemic\neffect on adaptation or inflammation\nmood any of those things um and it's a\nfit and forget so you can put it in for\nup to 3 to five years if you have a\nreally heavy bleeding it really\ndissipates because the whole idea of an\nIUD is to thin the endometrial lining\nand so then you have autophagy that\ntakes care of the endometrial lining so\nyou don't necessarily have a bleed the\ncopper IED is different because you do\nhave really heavy bleeding for the first\nthree cycles and then it attenuates\nbefore we got started today you\nmentioned some very\ninteresting pioneering studies on\nevaluating menstrual blood itself as a\nwindow into some larger themes about\nwhat's going on physiologically maybe\neven psychologically um now might be a\ngood time seg to uh just touch into that\nwe can always return to it again later\nbut let me just ask it um more directly\nwhat are some things that can be\nmeasured directly from menstrual\nblood that are informative for women and\nit sounds like there's a new generation\nof at home tests that might be\ninteresting and informative for them to\nthink about yeah well if you think about\nmenstrual fluid everyone thinks about it\nas a discard product but it's a very\ngood indicator of what's Happening from\nan endocrine standpoint gives a really\ngood indication of what's Happening from\nan endometrial standpoint so if you're\nlooking at all the pyocin and the\nproteins and the tissue that comes from\nit it's a huge indicator that's\nnaturally discharged that we're now\nlooking at for\ndetermining HPV do you have it or not\nwhat about proteins for PCOS can we\nreally identify PCOS or endometriosis\ncan we talk about PCOS for a moment most\npeople have heard of it by now but\npolycystic ovarian syndrome It's\nassociated with typically elevated\nandrogens um it's becoming more and more\ncommon or perhaps detected more based on\nbetter detection methods I don't know\nwhich um the prevalence of PCOS seems to\nbe very very high it does and I think\nit's a combination of both uh we also\nsee some rebound PCOS that happens when\nsomeone gets off the oral contraceptive\npill it's not necessarily true pcus\nbecause what's happening now your\novaries are producing eggs m that have\nbeen downregulated for so long so under\nultrasound it might look like PCOS but\nit's not necessarily true indication the\nother is more and more women are\nstarting to eat more and so they're\ncoming out of low energy availability if\nyou have more carbohydrate you end up\nwith greater folicular stimulation which\nalso shows up as PCOS so the true PCOS\nyes there is a high incidence from a\nreporting standpoint but is it that\nrebound where it's not having all the\nandrogenetic changes that's still kind\nof up in the air at the moment um but it\nis a big concern for women because it is\nan indication that something's going on\nand they might have some fertility\nissues uh we see a really high incidence\nof PCOS in Olympic level athletes\nbecause of the higher androgenic aspect\nof PCOS so better recovery time a little\nbit higher Baseline\ntestosterone um so yeah it's a\npopulation spec specificity as well in\nthe 80s and 90s there was a lot of\nexcitement in the kind of\nneurobehavioral Endocrinology Fields\nlargely based on animal literature but\nthen expanding into human literature\nthat certain forms of activities could\nchange hormone patterns and maybe even\npsychology and that makes sense on the\nsurface of it but is there evidence that\num if somebody engages in say\nhigh-intensity training or competitive\nscenarios this has been explored a lot\nin men but I'm wondering if it's also\nbeen explored now in women\nthat androgens go up you know I mean\nthere's been these studies I don't know\nhow good they are of you know um people\non the stock exchange you know watching\ntheir stress fluctuations measuring\ntestosterone I think most of those\nstudies were done in men um but other\ncompetitive scenarios even showing for\ninstance that exogenous testosterone can\nincrease altruism in men if men are\ncompeting for who's like donating the\nmost money at a Phil philanthropic event\nbut you put them in a different scenario\nwhere it's far less benevolent in in\ngoal and then they'll uh exogenous\ntestosterone drives competitiveness\ntowards um things that are more\ntraditionally thought of as male male\ncompetition uh in other words it's all\ncontext dependent um is there anything\nthat kind of Springs to mind of\ninteresting studies as it relates to\nandrogens or uh estrogens in women\nathletes and as it relates to\nexercise they haven't done any specific\nstudies like that in women we do see\nthat under stress the cortisol increases\nand if you have an adequate uh response\nto it and your body can overcome it then\nyes you get a boost in testosterone for\nwomen um we see this in a lot of the\nnight Mission shift changes in tactical\nathletes there is also uh I guess a\nlessening of circulating estrogen so the\npulse changes when we start getting to\nthe end of a really strong training\nblock because we're starting to have a\nlittle bit of a down regulation of our\nleutinizing hormone pulse and estrogen\num but it shouldn't be severe enough to\ncause menstrual cycle dysfunction what\nwe want people to do is look at the\nratio of their estrogen progesterone and\nkeeping track of luteinizing hormone if\nthey are at that point where they are\ngoing to have a really big training\nblock so we look at pre-season during\nseason end of season and people who\nmight be at a higher risk factor for\nbecoming a menic then we keep track that\nway um because it is the stress\ncomponent that can downregulate not\nactually causing a permanent change as\nwe talk about menstration we should\nprobably talk about iron stores and um\nIron yeah um do women need to supplement\niron given that they lose iron during\nmenstration it's interesting because we\nhave a change in heepen or hepsin\ndepending on which part of the world you\ncome from uh because it is increased\nunder times of inflammation and\ndecreased under times of iron loss so we\nsee a a significant change across the\nmenstrual cycle so I tell women if you\nare concerned with low fertin then we\nwant you to take an iron supplement\nevery other day starting in the first\nday of your bleed for 10 days because\nthat's going to really allow your body\nto absorb it and stay on top of it um\nafter that every other day yeah but\nyou're not going to be absorbing as much\nof it because hepsin starts to come up\nafter ovulation again you have a\npro-inflammatory response so you have\ngreater inflammation do women blanket\nneed a supplement no because we see\nfatigue isn't necessarily just iron\nrelated there's so many other reasons\nwhy women are fatigued the one problem\nis the Baseline levels for like fertin\nfor active women if you go in and you\nhave a ferien level of 20 to 25 they're\ngoing to say it's normal\nbut we'd rather see you up around 50 so\nif you are in that low end of normal\nthen supplementing will help you get up\ninto that 50 and see if it makes a\ndifference if a woman is going to get a\nblood test to evaluate testosterone\nestrogen lipids metabolic factors Etc\nand she can only afford to do that at\none point during her cycle and compare\nat various times maybe every six months\nor once a year even at that spefic\nspecific time of her cycle is there a\nBest time in cycle to do that blood\ntest uh if I'm limited to say that then\nI would say 5 to seven days before her\nnext period starts so mid ludal because\nthen you get a good indication of\nestrogen progesterone Peak testosterone\ndoesn't fluctuate as much as those two\nso you're going to get a good idea what\nBaseline testosterone is and we know\nthat there's a greater inflammatory\nresponse so anything that's outside of\nthe norm of that upper elevation of\ninflammation you're going to be able to\nto pick out um so yeah I would say if\nyou could only do it at one point in\ntime that would be the time to do it and\nif she can add a second blood test at a\ndifferent phase of the menstrual cycle\nwhere would you place that second test\nday two of the menstrual cycle second\nday of bleeding to get a really good\nindication of what your true estrogen\nlevel is at Baseline and if she measures\nher hormones at those two times within\nthe cycle do you think that's sufficient\nto um get 75% plus of the relevant data\nyeah definitely\nterrific caffeine yes in the old days\nyeah meaning when I was a kid and not\nlong ago 10 years three weeks ago um we\nwould hear these crazy statements about\ncaffeine it pulls calcium out of the\nbones it's you know you'd hear this\nstuff I did a whole episode on caffeine\nI'm a big fan of caffeine but I do warn\npeople that if they suffer from anxiety\nor they're going through a particularly\nstressful life event it can raise the\nactivity of the sympathetic arm of the\nautonomic nervous system you'll feel\nmore nervous you're more prone to panic\nyeah when you're drinking caffeine but\num many people love caffeine I think 90%\nof the adult population of the world\ningests some form of caffeine every\nsingle day I'm in that 90% yeah likewise\nmaking it the most consumed drug\nworldwide is caffeine safe for women I\nsuspect based on what you just said that\nthe answer will be yes but are there um\ncase conditions where women should be\ncautious about their intake of caffeine\nindependent of this anxiety thing I mean\npeople probably shouldn't uh drink more\ncaffeine than they can uh tolerate\npsychologically no one male female young\nor old yeah yeah it's more of a genetic\nFactor than it is a sex Factor uh so I\nmean both men and women will be fast\nmetabolizers slow metabolizers or not\nhave an effect that becomes the bigger\nRock of them what we do find is in that\nper menopausal State women will become\nmore sensitive to the blood sugar\nfluctuations that happen with caffeine\nso they're used to having coffee in the\nmorning and with something then halfway\nthrough their workout they become a\nlittle bit\nhypoglycemic because there's changes in\num insulin sensitivity insulin responses\nso there's changes also in blood sugar\ncontrol\nand caffeine can exacerbate that so if\nyou are someone who's like oh I always\nhave a double espresso before I go\nworkout and then halfway through I'm\nreally hypoglycemic I'm really dizzy and\nlightheaded I don't know what to do feel\nsick or nauseous yeah yeah eat some food\neat some food with it what about sipping\ncaffeine through the workout um you know\ntaking that coffee in and just having a\nSit between sets can that offset some of\nthat uh I don't think so okay I hear a\nlot that people who drink caffeine\nbefore a workout you know Midway through\nthey're like I don't feel good yeah yeah\ncuz they don't eat that for me that just\nstimulates the desire for more caffeine\nbut um or even how dare I say a half\npiece of nicotine gum which I\nexperimented with but I was told and\nthis is why I'm not going to continue to\ndo it not only is it very habit forming\nit actually is such a Vaso constrictor\nthat uh I was told by a dermatologist\nthat it's terrible for skin even if\nyou're not getting your nicotine by\nsmoking vaping dipping or snuffing so\nthis this big Trend now toward ingesting\nnicotine as a stimulant and cognitive\nenhancer and performance enhancer I\nthink people should at least be aware of\nthe negative effects on skin never would\nhave known because I'm not a nicotine\nperson I'll tell you that half piece of\nnicotine gum is um the first time you do\nit it's a it's an unbelievable\nexperience it's the it's like your first\nreal cup of coffee oh really wakes you\nup yeah and dials you in I I recommend\nnobody do it because it's it feels that\nPleasant if you like caffeine I like\nShandra for that reason Shandra yeah\nwhat's Shandra it's an adaptogen I me I\nshould know what this is you you should\nknow what this is I should know well I'm\nhere to learn okay um Shandra Shandra uh\nyeah so it is an adaptogenic plant so\nyou know like jining siberian jining\nmaah asaga all those buzzword out there\nShandra is another really well-studied\nadaptogen and I have friends who say\nit's like Aderall where you take it and\nit's immediate fun focus and function\nbecause its main goal is to regulate\ndopamine serotonin and cortisol so it\ngives you gets women and men out of that\nbrain fog gives them incredible Focus do\nyou use it yep are you on it now I put\nit in my morning coffee okay uh you just\nsent people down the uh the rabbit hole\nof the internet of the internet all\nright yeah yeah you heard it here first\nfrom Dr Stacy Sims I'm going to give it\na try because the nicotine thing is an\ninteresting one and there are some\ncognitive enhancing effects of nicotine\nthat perhaps in um people 65 and older\nmight actually be beneficial for\noffsetting some forms of neurod\ndegeneration but that needs to still be\nexplored and researched don't cut that\nand clip it and put it out there like so\nthat's happened already um very\ninteresting all right caffeine we both\nagree is great Shandra you got to try it\ncheck it out let me know all right we'll\ndo\ncold yeah for reasons I still don't\nunderstand people have Associated me or\nthis podcast with deliberate cold\nexposure I like deliberate cold exposure\nin the form of a cold shower or a cold\nplunge or an ice bath mostly for the\neffects that occur\nafterward meaning more alertness a kind\nof semi- euphoric Buzz that goes on a\nlong long time no I don't think it\nincreases metabolism significantly\nenough to have a meaningful difference\nbut the long long lasting increases in\nthe so-called catac colines dopamine or\nepinephrine and epinephrine to me are\npretty impressive and I just like the\nway it makes me feel so that's the main\nreason I believe why people do\ndeliberate cold exposure and every time\nI do a post about deliberate cold\nexposure I get asked understandably so\nhow does it affect women differently\nthan men and then I usually get\nquestions about rod syndrome oh yeah\nyeah so is there a difference in terms\nof how Del cold exposure impacts women I\nhave to imagine the answer is yes given\nwhat you said earlier about Vaso\nconstriction versus Vaso dilation but\ndeliberate cold exposure like it hate it\nwhat do you think do you recommend it\nfor women I recommend it for Open Water\nswimmers who might experience that vagal\nresponse when they first dive into the\ncold I prefer heat for women everyone's\na responder to the heat you get better\nadaptations so sauna yep sauna hot tub\nyep preferably a true finish sauna\ninfrared doesn't it warms the skin but\nnot the core we want thank you for\nsaying that I'm not a big fan of\ninfrared sauna cuz it doesn't get hot\nenough no yeah you can bring an infrared\nlight into a traditional sauna if it can\ntolerate the heat yeah but finished\nsauna would be what something between\n185 degrees Fahrenheit and maybe 210 if\nyou're really heat\nadapted yeah I'm still working on Metric\nlet me do the conversion oh sorry yeah\nyou're living down in New Zealand now\nyeah so 60 to 80 degrees C I need to\nlook every time I've tried to do math on\nthe fly on this podcast in my head it's\nlike okay * 9 different processing mode\nyeah but people can look it up yeah okay\nlook it up um so the thing with cold\nwater exposure is the whole conversation\nabout ice cold ice baths and how cold it\nis it's too cold for women because when\nwe're looking at that severe immediate\njump into that icy cold it causes such\nsevere constriction and shutdown so\nwomen do really well and get that whole\ndopamine response and everything if the\nwater is around 16° C which is 55 to 56\ndegrees Fahrenheit which is chilly it's\nchilly it's not warm no it's go dive in\nSan Francisco Bay right and that is\nenough to offset that severe\nconstriction survival but it is cold\nenough to invoke all the changes that we\nwant with cold water\nexposure so it's a temperature Nuance\nthat's that sex difference and like I\nsaid when I have Open Water swimmers who\nare going to do a long swim or they're\ngoing to do a triathlon and the water is\ncolder I have them do cold water\nexposure especially face exposure into\nthe cold water um to get them habituated\nto that initial severe constriction and\nsympathetic activity that we don't want\nto happen before a\nrice with heat being the true like true\nheat that we're talking about with sauna\nwe see a lot of metabolic changes for\nwomen so we're having better insulin and\nglucose control we're seeing uh a better\num expression of our heat shock proteins\nand the uncoupling and and the\nrebuilding of those proteins that are\ncardiovascular responses and then for\nwomen as we get older and have the\noffshoot of hot flashes night sweats\nthat kind of stuff if you're doing heat\nexposure you're sending a stronger\nstimulus to the\nhypothalamus and you're also getting a\nbetter serotonin production from the gut\nbecause we have 95% of our serotonin\nproduced from the gut which lends to\nbetter temperature control and shuts\ndown hot flashes I think some people\nmight be confused by the idea of using\nsauna in order to reduce the hot flashes\num so I'll just remind people that your\nbrain has a set of neurons in the medial\npreoptic area that's sort of a\nthermostat if you will controlling core\nbody temperature and if you heat the\nsurface of your body your medial\npreoptic neurons say oh let's cool down\nthe core of the body now if you stay in\nthat heat too long you'll cook your your\nbody core body temperature will go up\nbut conversely if the surface of your\nbody is made cold the internal milu of\nyour body will heat up because those\nmedial preoptic neurons will say oh\nyou know this this is like putting an\nice pack on the uh thermostat which is\nwhat um graduate students and post talks\nused to do in the labs side working\nbecause it was a battle over the the\nheater right some people were in hot\nsome people were in cold so there was\nalways this this business in any event\num so it's not that you disapprove of\nthe of using deliberate cold exposure\nyou just recommend that women do\ndeliberate cold exposure with\ntemperatures that are maybe in the um\nlow 50° Fahrenheit um Range as opposed\nto the really H frankly just painfully\ncold for anybody um you know 38 to you\nknow 50 degree temperatures right we did\na pilot study looking because Wim Hoff\nhas been down to New Zealand quite a bit\nand so you know his breathing and ice\nbath stuff has been making the rounds\nand working in the high performance\npeople wanted to do that but we have few\nathletes that have really severe\nendometriosis it's like well we could\nlook at using cold exposure to help\ncontrol that and what we found over the\ncourse of this study was that if we were\nto do deliberate cold\nexposure around ovulation and then hold\nit for 10 days over the course of three\nmenstrual cycles it attenuated the\nendometriosis because endometriosis is\nan inflammatory disease right so if\nwe're looking at inflammation process\nand growing the tissue if we can dampen\nthat inflammation and create a response\nthat learns that inflammation and\ndampens it then it helps with\nendometriosis interes that's another\nAvenue that we really want to take when\nwe're looking at Cold deliberate cold\nexposure wow\nfascinating as a cautionary note if\nanyone is going to explore Wim Hoff type\nmethods um please please please do not\ncombine cyclic\nhyperventilation um or hyperventilation\nof any kind with breath holds and water\nexposure not even in the depth of a\npuddle um there have been drownings\nassociated with people doing cyclic\nhyperventilation in various contexts not\njust related to Hof breathing but um\nbasically people who are not skilled um\nand even some who are skilled combining\ncyclic hyperventilation breath holds and\nwater in any form cold or warm water\nidea just don't if you're going to do\nany kind of cyclic hyperventilation\nbreathing my labs actually published on\nthis in a clinical trial do it on dry\nland or don't do it at all and if you're\ngoing to do deliberate cold exposure um\nlimit your breathing to slow deep\nbreaths make sure that you're um well\nsupervised and um just stay alive please\nyeah so we didn't incorporate any of the\nWim Hof breathing we just Incorporated\nthe deliberate water cold water\nexposures cold and temperature generally\nis such a potent stimulus and it's\nexciting that people are starting to\nexplore this especially the in my\nopinion the the sauna work uh one thing\nI suppose that we should um discuss very\nbriefly before we move on since we've\nbeen talking about resistance\ntraining we've been talking about\ndeliberate cold exposure there is\nevidence that doing deliberate cold\nexposure not so much in the form of a\ncold shower but in the form of a um\nsubmersion up to the neck post strength\nor resistance training say in the four\nbut probably the eight hours after\nresistance training because of the\nattenuation of the inflammatory response\nwhich sounds like a great thing it\nactually can inhibit some of the\nstrength and hypertrophy gains that one\nwould otherwise experience so if you're\ngoing to do deliberate cold exposure\nbest to not do it in the eight hours or\neven on the same day after resistance\ntraining geared towards developing\nstrength and hypertrophy increases no\nproblem to do it first in fact maybe\neven some performance-enhancing effects\nof doing it first there's some athletes\nthat stand for doing that but just want\nto throw that out there is there\nanything else you want to add to that um\nwhich is different from heat exposure\nbecause heat exposure you want to do\nafterwards the phas of dilation yeah\nbecause it extends that training\nstimulus\nand also the passive\ndehydration from training will stimulate\ngreater blood volume improvements oh\ninteresting so after a good weight\ntraining session if one has the luxury\nof doing it get into the sauna for up to\n30 minutes make sure you're hydrating\nyou want slow rehydration because part\nof it is that dehydration and the\ndecrease of oxygen at the level of the\nkidney to stimulate more EPO so with\nmore red cell production you have\nnatural increase in plasma volume so\nit's a blood volume expander o so now\nwe're getting into Real Performance\nenhancement is this true for men and for\nwomen yep yeah uh let's walk through\nthis protocol I like I like this this is\nuh this has not been discussed on this\npodcast so um somebody does their\nresistance training M finishes up drinks\neight or 16 ounces of water with a\nlittle salt in it maybe and then hops in\nthe sauna yep for how long up to 30\nminutes okay no longer no longer no\nlonger yeah they'll probably be a little\nbit thirsty in there you're looking for\na little lowlevel dehydration is that\nright yep okay um the ranges that I've\nseen published in the finished studies\nare as I recall and I'll double check\nthese numbers 186 degrees Fahrenheit up\nto about 210\nFahrenheit um and the higher end only\nbeing for those that are heat adapted\nyeah one can cover their head with a\ntowel and actually feel more comfortable\nbecause the brain is insulated the\nsurprises people they think putting a\nyou know something on their head would\nmake it excessively warm but you\nactually protecting your brain from some\nof the Heat and people will put a towel\nover so that they when they breathe it\ndoesn't burn the inside of their nose\nand their mouth either um I'm always\nlike if you're going to be in and it's\nthat hot just move down a level so on\nthe floor y yep um and this stimulates\nthe production of more red blood cells\nMH okay which then translates to what in\nterms of athletic performance you have\nan increase in your\ncardiovascular effort and because you\nhave greater amount of blood volumes you\nyou have greater amount of pretty much\nblood circulating so you have more\navailable for um muscle metabolism heat\nloss um so it's akin to going to\naltitude so people will go to altitude\nto get that blood volume boost but not\neveryone responds to altitude you have\nresponders non-responders over\nresponders okay this is why when I go to\nColorado I'm gasping for air while I do\na walk but then I come back to C Level\nand I feel better my endurance is better\nbut some people might not experience\nthat effect true this is I was telling\nthe guys before we started that I've\nbeen in ARA at home in preparation for\ngoing to Park City because I live at a\nbeach town and going to Park City I am a\nsignificant responder to altitude and I\nwon't be able to have coherent meetings\nat altitude if I am not adapted so okay\nyeah so this explains why when I've gone\nto meetings in Colorado at altitude some\npeople can have a drink that first night\nand they're perfectly fine even though\nthey normally live at sea level and I'm\ntrying to trying to see the stairs\ncorrectly even though I don't drink y\nthat would be it very interesting so you\ncan use post resistance training sauna\nexposure to\nimprove performance yeah you can use it\num post cardio as well so anything that\nis giving you that passive dehydration\nfrom training because you're not because\nyou will become passively dehydrated\nwhen you're training right you can't\nkeep in as much fluid so I'm saying\npassive as in you're not able to stop\nthat dehydration and then you go into to\nthe sauna and you are extending that\ntraining stimulus because your heart\nrate is elevated you're putting your\nbody under stress from\ndehydration and the body responds in\nkind of we need more blood volume so\nlet's let's jump start that I love it\nlogically watertight and um I'm going to\ngive it a try yeah what other training T\ntricks tips do you have up your sleeve\nDr Sims what you want to talk about um\ndo you have any favorites besides that I\nI Delight in these and I know other\npeople will as well um do any come to\nmind I mean you've T us about\nShandra um about posttraining sauna\nexposure to improve performance by\nincreasing red blood cell count yeah\nthere is there anything else that\nSprings to mind no no no\npressure uh I'm a fan of what I call the\ntrack stack that we used to use for\ntrack athletes but then for really\nsignificant high intensity work so track\nstack is kind of the idea from the old\nbodybuilding set where you're taking 200\nmilligrams of\ncaffeine uh lowd dose baby aspirin mhm\nbut then I add beta alanine used to be a\nfedrin I know so I'm I'm old enough to\nremember when they would sell it as the\ntriple stack with a fedrin but some\npeople dropped dead and they took it off\nthe market y hey it came back on the\nmarket in New Zealand last week did it\nreally yeah it gets you going yes it\ndoes it's um it's Speedy y um it's\ndangerous yeah but the track stack which\nhas beta alanine and not\nephedrine is really good at encouraging\nan extra top end effect because you're\nhaving the caffeine you're having a\nlittle bit of the blun blood thin from\nthe aspirin and then the vasodilatory\nproperties and the carnosine aspect for\nmuscle contraction from the beta alanine\nand so like training for gravel races in\nthe top end Sprint you do a couple of\nSprint sessions with that and it's\nincreasing your training stress during\nthe training so your adaptation is to\nthat higher stress should anything be\ndone in terms of recovery to make sure\nthat you offset that additional stress\nthat's achieved with this track stack\nyeah um just making sure that you're not\nstacking two days in a row of high\nintensity work like really making sure\nthat you're recovering well because it\nis a significant stress on the body what\nabout sleep we hear so much these days\nabout the importance of sleep for mental\nhealth physical health performance I\nthink this is a great thing a great\nTrend are there female specific\nrequirements for sleep that vary across\nthe menstrual cycle Andor by age or just\ngenerally you know do men and women need\nto think about the need for Sleep\ndifferently yeah um part of it is the\nobvious like when you're talking about\nsleep temperature right women and men\nhave variations in their sleep\ntemperature and what's optimal so\nlooking at that like you need to create\nan environment for you that is cool\ncomfortable which is probably going to\nbe different from your partner who might\nbe sharing your bed so that becomes a\nsticky point we talk about the menstrual\ncycle there are definitive changes in\nsleep architecture we're seeing that in\naround the mid ludal to the premenstrual\nso you know that about 10 days before\nyour period starts significant change in\nyour slow wave sleep there's less of it\nlatency is increased so you have a\nlonger time to get to sleep and you have\nmore light sleep so overall you know\nless of that deep recovery sleep and\nthis is where women tend to have more of\ntheir mood issues too because of\nestrogen's play with serotonin in the\nbrain so we really need to nail down our\nsleep hygiene in that time period um so\nlooking at things like eleanine and\nappenine and looking at your room\ntemperature and the screens and all the\nthings that you've talked about for the\nmost part about sleep and sleep hygiene\nsuper important and then of course as\nyou get older in both men and women\nbecomes more difficult to sleep but we\nsee significant issue with insomnia in\nwomen who have really bad hot fleshes\nand significant uh menopausal symptoms\nand again this has to do with lots of\nthe perturbations from temperatures of\nnight sweats increased sympathetic load\num not being able to get into a\nparasympathetic state so this is where\nworking with a specific sleep specialist\nmight come into play we can also look at\nusing some adaptogens the Rola stacked\nwith\ntheanine um and looking at the cold\ntemperature getting people to use the\nnon-sleep deep rest or Yoga Nidra or\nsome other kind of meditative property\nthat they can then access when they're\nin bed so there's a lot of different\nthings that we have to be aware of um\nand again in that par menopausal State\nwe see that significant change in sleep\nand sleep architecture and quality of\nthe sleep but men don't have the same\nthing so women have to be a little bit\nmore aligned with what's happening from\na hormonal profile standpoint because it\ndoes definitively affect serotonin\nmelatonin and sleep architecture because\nof the interplay that estrogen has on\nthe brain and The receptors makes very\ngood sense we'll put a link in the show\nnot captions to some zeroc cost um\nnon-sleep deep breast yogan nras we've\nput out a couple with my voice if you\nprefer another voice I a big fan of the\nones by Kelly boy who's contributed to\num The Waking Up app it also has\nterrific um non-sleep deep breast yoga\nnras out there and there are S as well\num you mentioned a few supplements\ntheanine um appenine which is chamomile\nextract um maybe let's just have a\ngeneral conversation about supplements\nwhat's your thought on supplements um\nhow do you place them into the landscape\nof nutrition they are after all\nsupplements not Replacements but um the\nword supplements I I believe is a little\nbit misleading um because there are\nfood-based supplements you know like a\nprotein powder um there are supplements\ndesigned to achieve a specific Al come\nand then there are supplements that are\nkind of a um designed to be a more you\nknow support for a bunch of things you\nknow kind of insurance policy um what\nare some of your favorite supplements in\nany of those categories specifically for\nwomen and perhaps even specifically\nDuring certain phases of the menstrual\ncycle Andor per menopause menopause I\njust threw about nine questions at you\nokay the number one is creatine creatine\nfor women doesn't matter what age it's\nreally important we're seeing a lot for\nbrain mood um and actually gut health so\nfive grams of monohydrate per day\nsort of to five three to five yep um\npreferably of course Crea pure because\nthe way it's produced so if you're\nlooking at Crea pure it's the German\ncompany that produces it uses a\nwater-based wash to produce the creatine\ninteresting whereas others use an\nacid-based wash and we see a lot of side\neffects with the acid base wash like\ngastric distress yeah so people are like\nI'm really bloated and I have nausea and\nstuff from taking creatine I'm like is\nit Crea pure actually no it's like\nswitch to creapure and so they switch\nand they're like oh my gosh I feel so\nmuch better noted yeah um and then\nvitamin\nD3 really important especially um when\nwe're looking at all the information\nthat's coming out from cardiovascular\nmuscle brain everything that goes with\nvitamin D also with iron so vitamin D is\nreally important for absorbing and\nmaintaining iron\nstores uh so those are the two big ones\nand then sorry I just wanted to stop you\nfor a moment um as it relates to\ncreatine I hear two general lines of\nconcern one I hear more often from women\nmy understanding is that because\ncreatine brings water into the muscle as\nwell as supporting the phosphor creatine\nsystem of the\nbrain the water into the muscle\ncomponent means yes people who take\ncreatine 3 to 5 grams per day will gain\na few pounds of body weight that's solid\nbody weight in the form of water within\nthe muscle so solid in air quotes it's\nwater but it's within the muscle\num so they should know that um it's not\na given though interesting it's not a\ngiven there are some women on the lower\ndose of three that don't experience the\nwater gain okay and this is not bloat\nlike water subcutaneous water this is\nwater within the muscles correct so it\nwill be uh stored within lean tissue um\nand then I do hear concerns about\ncreatine uh causing hair loss I my\nunderstanding is there is zero evidence\nfor that no evidence there is a smidgen\nof evidence that it might increase\ndihydrotestosterone levels but it's like\none study marginal increase and then\npeople linked dihydrotestosterone to\nhair loss and so then the the conclusion\npeople drew was that somehow creatine\nincreases hair loss but you're saying\nzero evidence no evidence we see that\nwomen who start taking it midlife are\ncomplaining about it but it's actually a\nprogestin driven thing we see\nprogesterone and fluctuation\nprogesterone can exacerbate any hair\nloss so if women are experiencing that\nand they're saying oh it's creatine I've\nread all this stuff on Creatine no it's\nnot okay so we've got creatine D3 um\n1,000 IUS per day 5,000 IUS I guess it\ndepends a little bit yeah uh being very\nclose to Antarctica in the southern\nhemisphere in the\nwinter uh very low sunlight exposure\num looking around the 5,000 same with\nupper Northern Hemisphere UK that kind\nof stuff closer you get to the Equator\nthe less you need the one concern is\nlike a day here where it's foggy and\nit's supposed to be sunny and people are\nlike great I don't you know don't have\nto worry about going out in sun exposure\nbut then the next day it's bright and\nsunny and they're like ooh sunscreen so\nthey put sunscreen on and not getting\nthe right sun exposure so then again it\nis a lifestyle thing so basic is two to\n5,000 great Okay so we've got creatine\nvitamin D3 what are some of the other\nsupplements that you um that you take or\nthat you I don't know if we say suggest\nbut that you um perhaps suggest women\nconsider yeah so protein powder a really\ngood high quality uh because the amount\nof protein that women should be getting\nis often difficult to eat um so again\nsupplementing not using as the main\nstay uh that's one to consider and then\nagain I'm about adap\nso looking at the different adaptogens\nashanda is a good one holy basil or\nTulsi is another one Shandra and then\ngetting into some of your medicinal\nmushrooms Lions man Rishi those are the\ntwo big ones that I look to and often\nhave women\nuse if these\nadaptogens blunt cortisol because\ncertain ones do like ashwaganda which by\nthe way I do think people should cycle\nif they're going to take it high doses\nright cuz there are some ISS issues with\nliver and thyroid and thyroid problems\nif people take ashwaganda high doses for\ntoo long so that's um important to note\nbut assuming that the adaptogens are\nreducing cortisol levels um in addition\nto doing other things is there a\nparticular time of day or night that\npeople should consider taking them\nshould they avoid taking it early in the\nday my understanding was that you you\nwant a bit of that cortisol uh bump\nearly in the day but you certainly want\ncortisol lower later in the day yep and\nI think the problem is people think that\nthey don't want any cortisol and they\nthink that would be bad that would be\nbad they don't understand that the body\nhas fluctuations of cortisol throughout\nthe day and that's normal if we're\nlooking at having issues with sleeping\nand that anxiety provoked from that\nsympathetic drive and elevation to\ncortisol let it peak in the morning\nafter you're waking up and look late\nafternoon like 4:00 when it starts to\ndip to take your adaptogens then because\nthen it feeds forward to being able to\nrelax more which feeds forward to better\nsleep for something like Shandra where\nyou're looking for that brain Focus you\ncan have it in the morning it doesn't\nnecessarily have as big an impact on\ncortisol that you see with something\nlike Tulsi or ashanda because Shish is\nmore stimulatory the other two are more\ncalming um I put some in my morning\ncoffee and then in the afternoon when I\nneed to pick me up instead of more\ncaffeine I'll us Shandra because it\ngives you that boost without the effects\nof caffeine and it doesn't interfere\nwith sleep so there's a time and a place\nto take them and yes some need to be\ncycled on some need to be cycled off but\nI tell women what are your main symptoms\nwhat are the things you're looking to\ncontrol and we can look and see what\nkind of adaptogens we can use and how we\nplace them what's the story with\npregnancy and training yeah you um is\nthere an official word on this you know\nuh assuming a woman knows that she\npregnant from the very beginning of\nmissing a period where she's in a\nposition to make decisions about\ntraining or not training training at a\ngiven intensity or or not um what are\nyour\nrecommendations the human body is really\ninteresting and when you get pregnant\nyour body tells you what you can do so\nwe see that you have a reduction in your\nAnor robic capacity on purpose your\nbody's trying to be protective you do\nhave an expansion of your blood volume\nso endurance is really good but you\ncan't do\nhigh-intensity um when we're looking at\nthe general guidelines that are out\nthere they've gotten rid of the heart\nrate rule they are now telling women to\nbe as active as they can be without\ncreating injury and without trying to\nmake gains so that means if you're in\nthe weight room you're not looking to\nimprove you're looking to maintain if\nyou're doing cardiovascular work and you\nhave a specific class that you love to\ngo to yeah but don't beat yourself up\nthat you can't hit that high in\nintensity you're going for the social\naspect you're not trying to gain Fitness\nyou're trying to maintain I think the\nvery worst possible scenario is someone\nwho superactive and stops doing\neverything because they're afraid\nbecause then they get deconditioned and\nthen they end up in a worse State than\nsomeone who was sedentary who's now\nencouraged to walk during exercise um it\nhasn't been well researched because you\ncan't get ethics to study pregnant women\nvery well so we go on a lot on um case\nstudies and cas study notes and the\nbottom line of it all is you stay active\nand you can do resistance training you\ncan do all the cardiovascular work and\nyour body will tell you what you can and\ncan't do I've been asked whether or not\npregnant women can do deliberate cold\nexposure probably no fewer\nthan 2500 times on social media and I\nnever have an answer and but I always\ndefault to the cautious answer which is\nuh please don't until you talk to\nsomebody who actually has an answer yeah\njust because it sounds like a very\nprecarious situation but in all honesty\nI don't know I'm just biing time there\nand just saying please go ask somebody\nwho can give you a definitive answer yes\nso we see women who have a high risk for\nmiscarriage that anything that they do\nthat's incredibly stressful for the\nfirst 12 to 20\nweeks will put them at a higher risk for\nit so being very cautious especially\nwith cold because we know that there are\nso many different nuances doing\nsomething like hot yoga when you're\npregnant is not there is a research so\nit's not\ndetrimental yeah because when we're\nlooking at blood flow diversion that way\nwhen you have slight hypoxia to the\nplacenta and to the baby there is a\nrebound effect that increases the\nvascularization so that the baby has\nbetter nutrients we see this also with\nlike exercise and exercise intensities\nthis is why people people are now saying\nyou need to have some kind of blood flow\nchange and increase in core temperature\nto create these vascular effects within\nthe placenta to improve nutrient and\nnutrient delivery to the developing\nfetus so Heat's good cold I'm not so\nsure of but probably not extreme heat\nnot extreme heat so that's why I mean\nlike hot yoga is not going to the sauna\nHot Yoga sits around 40° Celsius so what\nis that just around 100 degrees\nFahrenheit\nand in that situation if you're feeling\ntoo hot you leave you lie down on the\nfloor don't try to stay for the whole\nclass um but it's not going to be\ndetrimental unless you're pushing\nyourself too much again everything in\nmoderation especially when you're\npregnant it's almost the inverse of what\nwe know for males which is if men want\nto conceive they should avoid the sauna\nbecause we know that heat is detrimental\nto sperm viability in a in a real way so\nmuch so that I tell guys if they are\ntrying to get their partner pregnant\nthat they should bring an ice pack into\nthe sauna they should insulate that ice\npack don't put it directly on the\nscrotum for for other reasons but that\nit's a you know that the effects of heat\nthe negative effects of heat on sperm\nare are real yeah but there's also an\ninteresting it's not just a trend\nthere's actually some research showing\nthat um cooling the testicles leads to\nincreases in testosterone which is on\nthe face of It kind of um\ncounterintuitive\nbecause turns out that it's about the\nVaso\nconstriction causing the subsequent\nincrease in blood flow increased Vaso\ndilation so the inverse of what you just\nsaid which is that during the heating\nprocess the hypoxia induces more\nvascularization of the of the placenta\nyeah so um when talking about\ntemperature one always has to think\nabout the surface of the body versus the\nbrain response as we talked about\nearlier and then what's happening during\nthe delate heat or deliberate Cold\nversus what's happening after the\ndeliberate heat or deliberate cold right\neverything in biology is a process not\nan event yeah and I should make full\ndisclosure I started as an environmental\nexercise physiologist and my PhD was all\nin heat and heat research so I'm a\nlittle bit biased towards heat but I've\ndone a significant amount of research in\nthe hot and cold thank you for the\ndisclosure uh I see it more as a uh as\nan indication of of real knowledge so\nthank you this is an aspect of your\ntraining I I knew a little bit about\nbased on your Publications but I didn't\nrealize the depth of knowledge so we're\nall benefiting here including this\nearlier protocol of sauna post training\nyou can bet a lot of people are going to\nstart incorporating that I think we\nmight need to name that I've done this\nfrom time to time named protocols um\nbecause people are reluctant to name\nthem after themselves maybe we call that\nthe um the uh The Sims protocol or\nsomething like that\nthe anyway your discomfort will be other\npeople's U\nbenefit now seems like a good time to\naddress some specific questions related\nto the age brackets that you mentioned\nearlier um in anticipation of sitting\ndown with you today I asked some\ndifferent women that I know you know if\nyou could ask the world expert in\nexercise physiology hormones and um and\nnutrition Etc as it relates to women one\nquestion what would it be and one of the\nmost common questions I got in the 50\nand up category was what is the most\nefficient way for a woman older than 50\nto train for the maximum health span and\nlifespan benefits I love this question\nbecause I get it all the time we have to\nturn our brains away from everything\nthat's been predicated before to this\npoint so if we're looking for longevity\nand we're looking at what we want to do\nwhen we're 80 or 90 we want to be\nindependently living we want to have\ngood propri reception balance we want to\nhave good bones and we want to be strong\nso this is where we look at 10 minutes\nthree times a week jump training so this\nisn't your Landing softly in our knees\nthis is like impact in the skeletal\nsystem uh a colleague in friend of mine\nTracy kle did a PhD and um post not a\npostto but post research on this and is\ndeveloping an app on it to show women\nhow to jump to improve bone mineral\ndensity over the course of four months\nof this type of training people have\ngone from being Osteo um pic to normal\nbone density so it's a different type of\nstress so if your concern is that which\na lot of women do have a concern because\nthey lose about onethird of their bone\nmass at the onet of\nmenopause wow yeah significant yeah\ngoodness gracious if you don't do\nsomething as an intervention so we see a\nlot of women are like oh I'm going to go\non menopause hormone therapy to stop um\nbone loss yeah it can be a treatment but\nI always look at an external stress that\nwe can put on the body that's going to\ninvoke a change without Pharmaceuticals\nso jump training heavy resistance\ntraining and Sprint interval training\nthose are the three key things and from\na training standpoint and then from a\nnutrition standpoint getting protein\nprotein is so important when you start\ntelling women they need to look at\naround 1 to\n1 one G per pound which is around that 2\nto 2.3 G per kilo per day they're like\nwhoo that's a lot of protein it is\nbecause we haven't been conditioned to\neat it few scrambled eggs it's a chicken\nrest at lunch it's a small steak at\ndinner plus other things right exactly\nand it doesn't all have to be animal\nproducts I mean you're looking at all\nthe different beans and things that you\ncan put together and that's the other\nbig thing that in order to build the\nmuscle and to keep the body composition\nin the state that we want it to keep\ngoing for longevity those are the big\nrocks the Sprint interval training the\nheavy resistance training the jump\ntraining and the protein I'm thinking\nabout this and I'm thinking about my my\nmother who's 79 years old she'll be 80\nat the end of June and is in good health\nwalks a lot Gardens does some yoga but\ndoes none of the things that you're\ndescribing so Mom please I'm gonna I'm\ngoing to um send her to listen to this s\nin the same vein yeah what about the\nwomen out there age 20 to maybe we make\nit the 20 to 40 bracket um and if we\nneed to divide that more finely we can\num um what is the most efficient way for\nthem to train for health Vigor and\nLongevity uh making things fun for the\nmost part I don't want people think that\nit's a chore so if you're someone who's\nbeen told you need to run and you hate\nrunning then don't run like that's\ncommon sense and I say that because I\nsee little kids in non- US countries\nthat have to run across country and you\nsee these kids when they're six years\nold and all running around the field and\nthey're the the kids that hate running\nthat aren't natural Runners and then\nthey hate physical activity for the rest\nof their life so I put that in like when\nyou are exercising you want to find\nsomething that you find fun when you're\nin your 20s to 40s you have more room to\nget away with things that might not be\noptimal for you when you start to get\nolder big rock again is resistance\ntraining it doesn't have to be heavy\nresistance training like I said earlier\nto failure you're periodizing if you\nwant to do a block of Olympic lifting go\nfor it if you're like I'm not\ncomfortable doing that kind of lifting I\nwant to do more machine stuff great but\nwe want to make sure you're changing it\nup all the time to keep things moving\nand shaking with regards to strength and\nhypertrophy and then it becomes more of\nare you training for something that's\nendurance are you looking for just\nlongevity for brain health we need to\nhave some lactate production because\nwomen as I said at the beginning of the\npodcast are more oxidative we don't have\nas many of those glycolytic fibers so\nwhat we're finding in older research is\nthat there's misstep in brain lactate\nmetabolism because the brain hasn't been\nexposed to it especially if we're\nlooking at women who are being studied\nnow it hasn't been in a societal context\nto do that kind of work the younger we\nare and the more that we can keep our\nour glycolytic fibers going by doing\nhigh-intensity work the more we're\nexposing our brain to lactate the better\nwe see fast forward to attenuating\ncognitive decline and reducing the\nplaque development of Alzheimer's this\nis why women who are in their 40s plus I\nwant them to do the Sprint and the high\nintensity work for that lactate\nproduction start early because then you\ncan take some of those type two B fibers\nthat could either go more aerobic or\nanerobic and make them more Anor robic\nso those are the two big things for\nwomen who are younger and then you can\nplay around with the other things if you\nwant to be an ultra endurance athlete\nyeah not really ideal but yeah you can\ndo that that's fine you'll recover well\nnow forgive me because you've said it\nseveral times throughout today's\ndiscussion but I really want to drive\nhome a key point that I think for most\npeople men and women is not obvious but\nis really important when you say high\nintensity you don't mean a class or a\nrun uh where you're drenched in sweat\nand gasping for air at the end\nnecessarily correct let's disambiguate\nhigh intensity from what most people\nthink of high intensity which is a\nreally hard workout a tough class where\nthey had me moving the whole time doing\na circuit Etc what does the appropriate\nhigh-intensity workout look like okay so\nuh if I talk about true high-intensity\ninterval training if you're a runner\nit's going to the track and doing sets\nof\n4800s okay so 400 a lap yep 800 two laps\nright so you're looking at between a\nminute and four minutes of of hard work\nat 80% or more with variable recovery so\nthat's why use a track as a as an\nexample so if you do one lap and you're\nlike uh I'm going to walk half a lap and\nthen do it again that's adequate\nrecovery tough yeah it's hard right but\nit's not like you're going to be there\nfor 90 minutes doing as many 400s as you\ncan because you have that variable\nrecovery it might take half an hour to\n40 minutes max and then you're gassed\nout can't do it anymore if you're\nlooking at a gym situation I look I I\nlike to look at something like every\nminute on the minute where you might be\ndoing uh 10 deadlifts at moderate\nintensity weight and it Tak 10\nrepetitions yeah so it takes you 50\nseconds to complete that then you have\n10 seconds to move to the next exercise\nthat might be thrusters so you know a\nsquat clean thrusters so it's a squat\npulling the weight up overhead so you're\ndoing maybe eight of those in that\nminute and you might have 10-second\nrecovery you go to the next exercise\nthat might be um kettle bell swings and\nyou're doing explosive kettle bell\nswings and you'll finish you know 10\nseconds to go you go to the fourth\nexercise I don't know toes to bar or\nsome other kind of vup some other high\nintensity and then you have one minute\ncompletely off so you've had four\nminutes of really heavy work with maybe\n10 seconds to move to the next exercise\none minute completely off and then you\nrepeat that three times and this is\nhigh-intensity interval training this is\nnot what you would consider resistance\ntraining for sake of building muscle or\nstrength correct you're using these\nloads these machines the the pike you\nknow hanging from the bar and bring your\nknees up or lsit or something as a tool\nto get the heart rate up continually y y\nvery different than resistance training\nthe mo the way most people think about\nit correct so this is the cardiovascular\nhigh-intensity interval training and the\nsubset of that is Sprint interval\ntraining and this is something that's\nreally really hard and people don't get\nit I don't necessarily mean running it\ncan be whatever mode of activity but\nit's 30 seconds or less as as you can go\nso this is your N9 or 10 on your rating\nand perceived exertion 110% it's Max\neffort on the rower on the airdine bike\nrunning if you like of those the skier\nthe battle ropes battle ropes are big so\n30 seconds all out then rest what 10 15\nseconds repeat no you want to because\nnow we're looking at that top end where\nwe\nwant uh regeneration of your ATP you\nknow all of that system and central\nnervous system recovery so this is 30\nseconds all out could be two or three\nminutes of recovery oh nice because I'm\nnot looking at Tata where you're 20\nseconds on 20 seconds off because that's\nnot the intensity we want we want you to\ngo all out and recover well enough to be\nable to go all all out again you're not\nleaving anything in the tank so those\nare what I mean by high-intensity\ninterval training or or when you're\nlooking at polarizing your\ncardiovascular work that's the top end\nthose are the two examples of your top\nend and then your recovery is that long\nslow walking on another day where you're\nnot going and doing a tempo run you're\nnot doing a 5k easy jog because that put\nyou in that moderate intensity and if I\nheard you correctly earlier you are\nsuggesting most women do one or two days\nof high-intensity interval training plus\n3 to four days of resistance training\nfor sake of building strength and muscle\nwhich looks very different it's more\nwarm up do\na couple work sets you know two to four\nwork sets of you know an overhead press\ntwo or four work sets of maybe a barbell\ncurl two or four sets of some dips or\nwhatever whatever um one's you know\npersonal choices yeah okay got it um\nvery different Far and Away different\nthan what most people men or women are\ndoing out there which is um a lot of\nStairMaster treadmill jogging maybe some\nLifting for hypertrophy because I look\nat the general consensus of what's out\nthere in the fitness world is all based\non Aesthetics and body composition and\nso people have this mentality of I need\nto be hypertrophy to Get Swole and I\nneed to do long slow stuff on the cardio\nmachine to lose body fat but that isn't\nwhat we're after we're after let's\ncreate really strong external stress to\ncreate adaptations not only from a\nneural and a brain standpoint that's\nunderstanding it but but also feeding\ndown to metabolic change because if you\nhave a really significant high stress we\nsee epigenetic changes within the muscle\nthat increase the amount of what we call\nthe glute four Gates so you know the\nproteins that open up that allow\ncarbohydrate to come in without insulin\nso we're expanding that acute um glucose\nuptake through an epigenetic change the\nother thing that it does is it causes a\nan acute inflammatory response that your\nbody learns to overcome and it's really\nimportant for women to do that because\nas we start to lose estrogen we lose a\nsignificant anti-inflammatory agent so\nthis is why we see that increase in the\nvisceral fat especially when we're\nhitting your your mid-40s onwards is\nbecause now you have this increase in\nfree fatty acids and the inability for\ninflammation to come down so the muscle\ncell is going I don't know what to do\nwith this so get circulated to the liver\nand the liver stores it as visero fat\nwhereas if you do that high intensity\nwork it creates that change within the\nmuscle to understand pull that in let's\nuse it let's also bring more\ncarbohydrate in and more glucose in use\nthat which helps use free fatty acids\nand it also creates a significant\nanti-inflammatory response at the level\nof of the mitochondria and within the\ncell itself which is what estrogen used\nto do so if we look at those external\nstresses it's not about body comp and\nAesthetics per se it's about the\nmolecular changes that we want to invoke\nto get that body composition and the\nbrain health that allow us to be 80 or\n90 and independently living and in terms\nof nutrition you mentioned women should\nshoot for 1.1 1.2 grams of quality\nprotein per pound of body\nweight what other types of foods do you\nlike to see women ingesting so um are\nyou a fan of fruit yeah great well these\ndays you sort of have to ask in these\ncircles uh vegetables y yeah fiber is\nimportant yeah absolutely and then in\nterms of starches to um to replace\nglycogen especially if people are doing\nthese high-intensity interval training\nsessions and the resistance training um\nwhat are your preferred sources it\ndepends on who I'm working with uh I\nhave some people who love cocoa pops and\nkids cereal o i cringe at that stuff um\nbut you know I prefer I prefer rice and\noatmeal and I like a really good\nsourdough bread with butter or olive oil\nyou know guilty of that yeah but there\nare some people who like the ultr\nprocessed stuff so I'm like okay if you\nreally really need it then you can put\nit on top of your yogurt after training\nas part of your carbohydrate uptake it's\nthe only time because glute four levels\nare so high you're basically pulling\neverything into glycogen at that point\nanyway um but\nideally carbs are all the different\ncolorful fruit in veg and if we're\nlooking at sweet potatoes or Kuma if\nyou're from other parts of the world\nyams all those kinds of things sprouted\nbread fantastic kenoa amorth all of\nthose different types of things it's\njust staying away from the ultra\nprocessed and when we look at women it's\nreally important to have a very\nsignificant diversity in the gut\nmicrobiome so we see there's a\ndefinitive decrease when we start to\nhave hormonal shifts because of the way\nthe gut bugs help deconjugate or unwrap\nsome of our hormones and shoot them back\nout in the circulation so as much fiber\ncolorful fruit and veg as you can but\nalso it's the 8020 rule right 80% of the\ntime you're spot on 20% is life because\notherwise where do we get our chocolate\nand our whiskey and there's some data\nthat chocolate is good for us especially\nthe the low sugar dark chocolates what I\nlook at is how it makes you feel makes\nyou feel good right yeah yeah we one has\nto live yeah um and fats um where do you\nlike to see women get their fats from\nagain I'll do a full disclosure I have\nbeen um vegan since I was in high school\nbecause of an incident of a field trip\nto a pig slaughter house and driving\ndown the five but that's my own\npreference so when we're looking at fats\num it can be from a lot of different\nsources I prefer women to have most\ntheir fats from plant-based stuff not\nbecause I am plant-based but because of\nthe effect it has on the body but there\nis a time and a place for animal fats\ntoo um um the whole fear mongering of\nsaturated fatty acids from dairy has\nbeen disproven so if we're looking at\nwhat kinds of fats you want a\nconglomerate but you want most of them\nto come from Whole Food plant-based not\nfrom Ultra processed um and then of\ncourse you're reaching for some real\nbutter you're reaching for some 4% fat\nyogurt or something like that to\ncomplement your avocados your nuts your\nseeds and your olive\noils that all sounds very r and\ndelicious in my opinion yeah it's it's\ntoo Common Sense people don't do it I\nthink if people hear it from you they'll\ndo it um I think people just need to\nhear it in the context of a\nnon-diet um context and you've done an\namazing job today of explaining how\nnutrition fuels training training fuels\nchanges at the level of the muscle the\nliver Etc that allow one to ingest more\nfuel in fact a lot of what I'm hearing\nis that women should probably ingest\nmore quality fuel\nto offset these cortisol spes and feel\nbetter while training and to train more\nwhich um everyone agrees provided it's\ndone properly is is great for\nus kind of a fun hopefully fun question\nfor you if you had a magic wand and you\ncould get all the women uh on earth now\nand going forward to make a change or\nchanges you don't have to pick just one\nin terms of nutrition how they think\nabout their hormone cycle exercise\nHealth span lifespan what would it\nbe I think I would have everyone\nunderstand their intrinsic selves\nbecause we have been inundated so much\nwith sociocultural rhetoric and so much\nexternal noise that women have forgotten\nwhat it means to listen to themselves\nand their bodies I mean that's the one\nthing that I have to retach women to do\nso often so if I could have a magic wand\nand have every woman understand what\ntheir bodies are saying and what their\nCycles are saying and per menopause is\nnormal it's everyone's going to go\nthrough it if you have had a menstrual\ncycle just to intrinsically understand\nwhat their body is so then they have the\ntool to be able to implement external\nstressors that's going to be beneficial\nfor\nthem well Dr Stacy Sims this has been\ntremendously educational for me and I\nknow for everybody listening and are\nwatching um you've taken us on an\namazing tour of the best ways to train\nwith cardiovascular training and\nresistance training those tailored\nspecifically for women as well as\ntouching into some protocols for both\nmen and women that are immensely\npowerful talked a lot about the\nmenstrual cycle I get asked about the\nmenstrual cycle and how it relates to\ntraining and vice versa so many times\nand um thank you for providing clear\nactionable answers and you've also\neducated us on caffeine supplements\nincluding um revealing some supplements\nthat I didn't know existed which is a\nwhich is a uh not a common occurrence\nfor me yeah I win and um many wins many\nmany wins thanks to you and on and on so\njust such a a rich data set here um\npresented with such Clarity and in an\nactionable way so on behalf of myself\nand everyone listening and watching I\njust want to say thank you I know I know\nyou've come a very long way from the\nother side of the Equator not just to\nsee us but given that your time is so\nprecious um that you've come to visit us\nand share with us your knowledge I just\nwant to say uh a really deep heartfelt\nthank you yeah thanks for having me it's\nbeen fun and we'll have to have you back\nagain maybe we'll come to New Zealand\nyou should come down yeah definitely\nthank you thank you for
