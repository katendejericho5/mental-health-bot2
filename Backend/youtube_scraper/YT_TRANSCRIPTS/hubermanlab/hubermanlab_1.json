    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Stuart\nMcGill Dr Stuart McGill is a\ndistinguished professor of spine\nbiomechanics at the University of waterl\nas a professor for more than three\ndecades Dr Mill has analyzed the spines\nof injured people as well as healthy\npeople and develop methods to treat\nspine injuries and pain as well as to\nimprove spine biomechanics in anybody he\nhas authored more than 250 peer-reviewed\nresearch articles on these topics making\nhim a true World expert during today's\nepisode we discuss spine Anatomy as well\nas the common sources of back pain and\nwe discuss some of the controversies as\nto the origins and different treatments\nfor back pain as you'll quickly learn\nthere is no one specific source of back\npain nor is there one specific solution\nto back pain but as Dr McGill spells out\nvery clearly there are things that\nanyone and everyone can do in order to\nstrengthen their back and to reduce the\namount of pain they may be experiencing\nhe explains some specific ways to self-\ndiagnose your back pain which of course\nis critical for understanding what\nspecific things to do as well as to\navoid in dealing with any pain and as it\nrelates to applying in sport and in\neveryday life Dr McGill and I also\ndiscuss several of the Avid\ncontroversies within the field of back\npain and the treatments for back pain we\ntalk about the so-called bioc\npsychosocial model of pain which points\nto the various sources that pain can\narise from everything from emotional to\nlack of sleep to specific locations in\nthe spine and brain and elsewhere in the\nbody and the ways those mesh together to\ngive us what we call pain as well as to\ndirect us towards specific treatments\nfor pain that tend to be especially\neffective Dr Mill is a true encyclopedia\non the topics of back physiology and\nAnatomy sources of back pain and\ntreatments for back pain so it's truly a\nspecial opportunity to be able to learn\nfrom him in such immense detail and in\nsuch a clear and actionable way by the\nend of today's episode you will have a\nquite thorough understanding about the\nanatomy and physiology of the back as it\nrelates to a healthy back to back pain\nand of course you'll have various\nremedies for dealing with back pain\npreventing back pain and for\nstrengthening your back for all sorts of\ndifferent kinds of movement not just for\nexercise and Sport but also to move\nthrough your daily activi pain-free and\nwith ease and Mobility at any age before\nwe begin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching\nresearch rols at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nHelix sleep Helix sleep makes mattresses\nand pillows that are customized to your\nunique sleep needs now I've spoken many\ntimes before on this and other podcast\nabout about the fact that getting a\ngreat night's sleep is the foundation of\nmental health physical health and\nperformance now one of the keys to\ngetting a great night's sleep is to make\nsure that your mattress is suited to\nyour unique sleep needs what does that\nmean well if you go to the Helix website\nyou can take a brief two-minute quiz and\nit asks you questions such as do you\nsleep on your back your side or your\nstomach do you tend to run hot or cold\nduring the night things of that sort\nmaybe you know the answers to those\nquestions maybe you don't either way\nHelix will match you to the ideal\nmattress for you for me that turned out\nto be the dusk mattress made by Helix I\nstarted sleeping on a dusk mattress\nabout 3 and 1/2 years ago and it's been\nFar and Away the best sleep that I've\never had so if you'd like to sleep\nbetter by sleeping on a mattress that's\ncustomized to your unique sleep needs go\nto helixsleep.com\nhuberman take that brief two-minute\nsleep quiz and Helix will match you to a\nmattress that's ideal for you right now\nHelix is giving up to 30% off mattresses\nand two free pillows again that's\nhelixsleep.com\nhuberman to get 30% off and two free\npillows today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by better help better help offers\nProfessional Therapy with a licensed\ntherapist carried out entirely online\nI've been doing weekly therapy for well\nover 30 years initially I didn't have a\nchoice it was a condition of being\nallowed to stay in school but pretty\nsoon I realized that therapy is an\nextremely important component to overall\nhealth there are essentially three\nthings that great therapy provides first\nof all great therapy consists of having\ngood rapport with somebody that you can\nreally trust and talk to about the\nissues that you're dealing with second\nof all that therapist should provide\nsupport in the form of emotional support\nor directed guidance and third expert\ntherapy should provide useful insights\ninsights that allow you to better\nunderstand not just your emotional life\nand your relationship life but of course\nalso your relationship to yourself and\nto career goals and school goals meaning\nexcellent therapy should also Inspire\npositive action better help makes it\nvery easy for you to find an expert\ntherapist with whom you really resonate\nwith and that can provide the benefits\nthat I just described if you'd like to\ntry betterhelp you can go

hundreds of\nguided meditation programs mindfulness\ntrainings yoga NRA sessions and more I\nstarted practicing meditation when I was\nabout 15 years old and it made a\nprofound impact on my life in recent\nyears I started using the waking up app\nfor my meditations because I find it to\nbe a terrific resource for allowing me\nto really be consistent with my\nmeditation practice what I and so many\nother people love about the waking up\napp is that it has a lot of different\nmeditations to choose from and those\nmeditations are of different durations\nso it makes it very easy to keep up with\nyour meditation practice both from the\nperspective of novelty you never get\ntired of those meditations there's\nalways something new to explore and to\nlearn about yourself and you can always\nfit meditation into your schedule even\nif you only have two or 3 minutes per\nday in which to meditate I also really\nlike doing Yoga Nidra or what is\nsometimes called non-sleep deep rest for\nabout 10 or 20 minutes because it is a\ngreat way to restore mental and physical\nVigor without the tiredness that some\npeople experience when they wake up from\na conventional nap if you'd like to try\nthe waking up app please go to waking\nup.com huberman where you can access a\nfree 30-day trial again that's waking\nup.com huberman to access a free 30-day\ntrial and now for my discussion with Dr\nStuart McGill Dr Stuart McGill welcome\nthank you sir great to have you here um\nI'm a big fan of your work I've watched\na lot of your other content read your\nbooks and I'm excited to discuss today\nwhat makes for a really strong resilient\nback what causes back pain and how to\nrelieve it and perhaps the bigger issue\nis what all of that allows for in terms\nof mobility and functionality not just\nin sport but in everyday life so to kick\nthings off I'd like to ask a question\nthat I think is on a lot of people's\nminds most people aren't thinking about\ntheir back unless they have pain so what\ncauses back pain you start with the easy\nquestions let me give context before I\nDefine it as tightly as I can for\nyou back pain is a symptom so let's just\nchange the topic for a moment and talk\nabout leg pain can you imagine asking\nsomeone well could you give me an\nexercise or a prevention strategy for\nleg\npain okay so that sets the stage a\nlittle bit we're talking about a symptom\nfor which there's a hundred or more\ndifferent Pathways and mechanisms there\nso we've got to have a fairly\ncomprehensive assessment now and\nunderstanding uh\nto focus on the type of back pain and\nthen matching an appropriate uh inter\nintervention I was listening to the your\nnew podcast uh with Andy Galpin this\nmorning the perform podcast the perform\npodcast yeah and he\nsaid uh I'm going to try and follow the\nthree eyes and it was I think gather\ninformation interpret the information\nand then intervene so it's the same kind\nof deal here and of course that's\npan medical condition shall we say so\nwith that cont text I'm going to answer\nit like this what causes back\npain genetics loads the\ngun exposure pulls the trigger and then\nthe psychosocial millu around the\nindividual influences how they respond\nto the pain so there's a start we can\nbreak it down in those three categories\nif you wish sure So when you say uh\ngenetics loads the gun uh what comes to\nmind mind because it's my experience is\nthat um I have a right shoulder that\nsits a little bit lower than my left\nshoulder unless I'm mindful of that uh\nmy dad has the same thing and I can you\nknow put an ankle on my other knee a bit\nmore easily on one side versus the other\nI tend to pronate one foot a little bit\nmore than the other when I run these are\nsubtle\nthings they don't necessarily result in\nback pain but I'm guessing that a lot of\nthat is either developmental overuse\nparticular sport I'm regular footed I\nskateboarded a bunch so I push with my\nright foot I kick a soccer ball with my\nright foot those sorts of things but\nlet's assume that genetics played some\nrole created some bias if I were to tell\nyou that which I just\ndid would then you immediately think to\na particular intervention if I told you\nokay you know I I have a little bit of\nlower right side pain which I\noccasionally do I know I've got this\nimbalance that was loaded by genetics\nand presumably experience as well and\nwould your mind immediately go to a\nparticular uh origin of that pain or\nperhaps even more importantly a\nparticular remedy to that pain or do we\nneed to drill a little bit deeper and\nreally understand um more about what I\ndo what I don't do if I'm more thin set\nor heavily set at the level of of bone\nstructure you know what are some of the\nother questions one would ask in the\ninvestigate category my thought would\nnot go to one or the other but it would\ngo to both and I'd start that\nconversation with this uh\nanalogy uh let's talk about breeds of\ndogs we both love\ndogs if I said to you we're going to\ntake two dogs and we're going to train\nthem for the Greyhound track one's a\ngreyhound and one's a St Bernard how do\nyou think you're going to make out the\nSt Bernard no matter how you train it or\ncondition it will never make it to the\nuh performing on a greyhound track\nyou're going to end up with a broken uh\nSt Bernard so there's a little bit of a\nstart from a big perspective but now\nlet's drill down and talk about\nspines uh it's interesting when you look\nat the basic anatomical structure of an\nindividual we just did that with dogs\nimagine if took a thin Willow Branch I\ncould bend that Willow Branch back and\nforth over and over and it wouldn't\naccumulate stress but if I took that\nsame Willow Branch and loaded it top to\nbottom like an ibeam it would just bend\nand break so it supports bending Cycles\nbut it doesn't support compression now\nI'm going to change that uh Willow\nBranch into a thicker stick and I bend\nthe stick once and it shatters in other\nwords the uh thickness and Radial\ndiameter being larger means the stress\nis bigger in bending however let's\ncompress the same stick it can bear\ntremendous compression so there's a very\nfast example on spines there's a a\nfellow who uh has the world record in\nconsecutive situps thousands of them\ngiven what I've just said what's your\nprediction do you think he has a big\nstrong fellow with a thick spine or do\nyou think he's a very Slender Man with a\nwillowy thin spine he's a willowy bendy\nguy who can just keep bending up and\ndown off the ground bingo bingo he has\nto be there's no option so there's a\nstart on the genetics not everybody can\nplay offensive tackle and not everybody\ncan be a gymnast or uh not everybody can\nsimply tolerate sitting in a chair being\na computer\noperator there's a very mundane example\nfor you could I ask you a question about\num the willow versus um thicker thicker\ntrunk um\nexample can we look to torso thickness\nor wrist thickness or ankle um\ncircumference as a way to of assess\nourselves uh as to whether or not we are\nlike likely to be more willowy or um\nRedwood like I mean I it should be\nobvious just by looking at ourselves\nknowing ourselves but for instance I\nhave a short torso I'm kind of thick\nthrough the Torso front to back I always\nhave been since I was a kid but and my\nwrist the wrist circumference isn't\nisn't small but isn't isn't huge I had a\na a Bulldog Mastiff um and he would\noften look at me and I knew in his mind\nhe was\nthinking my wrists are really thick\ncompared to yours Andrew I knew that's\nwhat he was thinking he had forearms he\nhad forearms like a like a long shoreman\nand of course he had never done any any\nwork whatsoever actually primary goal of\nthe Bulldog is to do as little work as\npossible in life um\nbut I have friends who you know have\nthick knees some have smaller joints\nsmaller ankles can we make some general\nassessment about our spine without\nImaging it by looking at some of these\nperipheral markers absolutely yeah so\nthe uh knee width the bi iloc Crystal\nwidth which is the width of your iliac\ncrests uh hip width uh are all\nsurrogates to indicate General heaviness\nof the\nskeleton um so yes that's that's one\ngood marker um but there's more to the\nstory for genetics and how bendy a spine\ncan be um the shape of the disc matters\nso if you take on average a group of top\ngolfers you'll notice that their spines\nuh that the disk shape if we were to cut\nthrough which is a transverse scan on an\nMRI the discs are more ovoid if you take\nsomeone who can bear a lot of\ncompressive load the discs look more\nlike a limma bean and that's called a\nlimacon shaped disc and of course the\ndiscs are in repeating fashion\nthroughout the spine top to bottom\ncorrect um and the discs are the soft\ntissue that allow for mobility of the\nvertebrae the uh the Bony segments\nexactly they are the joints but they're\nnot a ball and socket joint they're\nactually a fabric of layer upon layer of\ncollagen fibers and we can talk about\nthat as well what a beautiful adaptation\nright take a bunch of bony if you want\nto be able to bend a bone right you need\nto um break it up into segments kind\nlike beads on a necklace and um and then\nin between those beads you put some\npliable yet um uh it I guess a tissue\nthat you can still compress so it's both\npliable and it can it can squeeze down\nand become more narrow in the vertical\nDirection and it can also you know\nsqueeze down on one side uh or the other\nto to some\ndegree yeah we evolved discs and there\nreally is no other better architecture\npeople say well why don't we have ball\nand socket joints in our spine and the\nreason is this can you imagine uh\nstacking five oranges one on top of the\nother and then you could make them\nMobile by putting a ball and socket\njoint in between them the amount of\ncontrol that you would need on every\nsingle orange you move one orange you\nhave to control all the other\nit's Mission Impossible we would uh I\nwould do an experiment with students in\nmy lectures I would take four coffee\ncans and put a tennis ball between each\ncoffee can and then I would put a rope\nat the front and the back of each coffee\ncan and then one on the side and I had\nfour students take those four ropes and\nthen I took another four students who\nhad the ropes on the next coffee can and\nthen on the next coffee can and then I'd\nsay Okay group flex the spine forward so\nthe students on the front would pull a\nlittle bit but the guy on top had to\npull more than the uh next coffee can\nand then the next coffee can a little\nbit less vice versa the people on the\nother side had to pay out the rope in\nsequence and and then I would say okay\nnow let's twist a little bit anyway you\ncould imagine it was impossible to\ncontrol and then I took out the uh uh\ntennis balls and I put in what was a\ndisc a big round cylindrical piece of\nfoam rubber all of a sudden that added\nstiffness so now because the body uses\nstiffness as the control\nparameter now we've added control in\nthat the foam rubber would create a\nbuffer and as the deviation in motion\noccurred the foam rubber would add more\nresistance so it was an automatic\ncontrol and it that that's what a shock\nabsorber does on a car it has an elastic\nelement plus the damper but it's the\nelastic element and we're going to talk\nabout stiffness and stability I\nhope uh that that really creates the\ncontrol so that's why we have evolved\ndiscs it's highly efficient I can bend\nthe spine to tie my shoe but if I have\nto uh carry home uh these days heavy\nshopping bags I need stiffness of that\nflexible Rod so it doesn't collapse or\nuh years ago I might have been carrying\nhome an animal for dinner and uh I\nneeded those discs to provide the\nstiffness in a very economical way and\nin a way that didn't create stress\ncontribution uh concentrations the way\nball and socket joints would so that\nthat's an evolutionary necessity um also\nwhen we look at spines there are the\ncolumn vertebrae with the intervening\ndiscs but behind them there's two more\njoints and those are called facet joints\nand they guide motion those facet joints\nhave a variety of angles they can have\nopen angles which allow you to twist so\nif you took a group of golfers could you\nimagine uh if they had facet angles like\nthis you can't twist so facet angles\nthat are too close together basically a\nsmall angle if the angle is orientated\nfor and a you can't twist and you won't\nfind if if if you're dealing with a\ngroup of professional golfers you'll\nfind that they all have open facet\njoints is that genetic it's absolutely\n100% genetic now interestingly enough\nwhen you Arch back when the facet joints\nare orientated open as I'm describing\nwhen you Arch Back one pushes hard on\nthe other like shingles on a\nroof that stresses a bone called the\npars bone and uh gymnasts for example\nget a very uh typical fracture pattern\ncalled a spond alol lth thesis which is\na fracture of that bone and then the\nspine shifts a little bit at that joint\nuh I'm just finishing rehabbing a pro\ntennis player who had the same thing\nafter they tried to have too much range\nof motion in their serve the coach gave\nthem excessive extension to try and put\nmore miles an hour on the ball but it\ndidn't suit the spine and they ended up\nhaving a stress fracture I mean is it\nfair to say that um if we can um if we\nare naturally flexible uh for instance\nlike my sister can you know like her\nfingers can bend back really easily her\nshoulder extension which I guess for\npeople that aren't familiar with\nshoulder extension you know she can um\nlike let's say you're you're leaning up\nagainst a railing with your back to the\nrailing the railing is just uh let's\njust say is um just above lower back\nheight and you can put both hands on it\nparallel so your arms are are close\ntogether like very close to the Torso\nand then and people don't don't do this\nquickly because because you can tear you\ncan tear something or injure something\nbut then with feet about I don't know a\nfoot or two away from from that uh bar\num you can do a knee Bend and and\nbasically the arms go back behind you\nlike I happen to have a fair degree of\nshoulder just natural shoulder extension\nability I'm not particularly flexible\nquote unquote but that's just how I'm\nstructured I have some friends that\ncan't do that to save their life right\num but I wouldn't consider myself hyper\nflexible my sister is a bit more\nflexible we're related obviously um so\nwould people like her or people that\ntend to be pretty flexible naturally um\nwould they be wise to avoid certain\nactivities if their goal is to remain\npainfree I mean you talk about the St\nBernard running um on the Greyhound\ntrack you know we all can enjoy things\nrecreationally but of course we don't\nwant to injure ourselves so is somebody\nwho's naturally flexible should they\navoid certain Sports and activities\nconversely if somebody is naturally\nstiffer thicker spine thicker joints\nshould they avoid certain activities\nthat's a huge question and there's many\nmore variables to uh consider um but I\nwill say that when we are rehabilitating\na uh athlete or just a person to get\nback to work they're an occupational\nathlete we take all of this into\nconsideration so as you were describing\nyour sister arching back um a I know she\nhas plump discs discs that are full of\nfluid uh to allow the mobility to take\nplace in the diss I also know that if we\nlooked at an x-ray from the side you\nknow the posterior spinus processes if\nyou run your thumb down the midline of a\nperson's back you will feel the bumps of\nbone up the middle of the spine those\nare the posterior\nspines\nuh she will have a large space between\neach one when she's standing upright so\nwhen she extends back those spaces will\ncome together and eventually the spines\nwhat we call it kissing spines and it\ntakes me back to some of the old Russian\ntechniques for bench press they would\nbench press with a huge arch in their\nback and then other people would say oh\nI'm going to try and mimic that\nparticular bench breast technique\nbecause it allows you to get much more\nForce so to latissimus dorsy a stiffer\nback and you get a different Force\nvector and and actually more effective\nuh force on the\nbar they didn't realize that when we\nwork with a person who has a huge Arch\nthey have big spaces between those\nspinus processes and if you don't have\nthose big spaces you are going to crush\nthe interspinous ligaments which\nnaturally are between those spaces and\nuh you will now fire off a whole set of\nuh uh new problems so what is a\nmechanical advantage for one person is a\nmechanical disadvantage for another do\nyou follow so it's it all of this uh\nmatters going back to the disc being a\nfabric of layer upon layer of collagen\nstrands\ntypically uh the dis is about 80% type 1\ncollagen that is the stiff strength\ncollagen about another 20% is elastic\ncollagen type two but there's types\nthree through 10 that bind those\ncollagen fibers together that's where\nthere's a much greater degree of genetic\nvariability so there are some people who\nuh can get away with doing many sit-ups\nthey have a slender spine and they have\nthe type of binding collagen that holds\nall those fibers together but if I\nwanted to work these fibers of my shirt\napart get them to delaminate I would\ncreate repeated stress strain\nreversals the resistance of that fabric\ndepends on the stuff holding the fibers\ntogether so there will be binding fibers\nthere that's where the genetic uh\nvariance lies in many people so even\nthere the person's resilience to\nrepeatedly doing a bending\ndrill is determined by your parents to\nsome degree both in the size the\ncollagen type three through uh 10\nmakeups as many of you know I've been\ntaking ag1 for more than 10 years now so\nI'm delighted that they're sponsoring\nthis podcast to be clear I don't take\nag1 because they're a sponsor rather\nthey are a sponsor because I take ag1 in\nfact I take ag1 once and often twice\nevery every single day and I've done\nthat since starting way back in 2012\nthere is so much conflicting information\nout there nowadays about what proper\nnutrition is but here's what there seems\nto be a general consensus on whether\nyou're an omnivore a carnivore a\nvegetarian or a vegan I think it's\ngenerally agreed that you should get\nmost of your food from unprocessed or\nminimally processed sources which allows\nyou to eat enough but not overeat get\nplenty of vitamins and minerals\nprobiotics and micronutrients that we\nall need for physical and mental health\nnow I personally am an omnivore and I\nstrive to get most of my food from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources but the reason I still take ag1\nonce and often twice every day is that\nit ensures I get all of those vitamins\nminerals probiotics Etc but it also has\nadaptogens to help me cope with stress\nit's basically a nutritional insurance\npolicy meant to augment not replace\nquality food so by drinking a serving of\nag1 in the morning and again in the\nafternoon or evening I cover all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nreport feeling much better in a number\nof important ways such as energy levels\ndigestion sleep and more so while many\nsupplements out there are really\ndirected towards obtaining one specific\noutcome ag1 is foundational nutrition\ndesigned to support all aspects of\nwell-being related to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink a1.com huberman to\nclaim a special offer they'll give you\nfive free travel packs with your order\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 k to\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman unless somebody is seeking to\nbe a worldclass athlete in something in\nwhich case they should probably pay\nattention to their genetics and see\nwhether or not it lines up well with a\ngiven sport although there have been you\nknow exceptions where people who were\nincredibly um genetically um uh let's\njust say biased toward um not being able\nto perform well in a sport have\nnonetheless succeeded in performing at a\nworld-class level the but those are\nexceedingly rare exceptions\num for most people who want to do things\nrecreationally like the heavier set\nperson with a thicker spine who wants to\ngolf or um do a um you know or do ballet\nperhaps um or the thinner willowy person\nwho wants to get into powerlifting for\ninstance um are there certain things\nthat they should each consider and\nembrace as activities in order to make\nthem themselves more resilient more pain\nresilient and more um apt to have higher\nperformance for instance would the\nwillow person so to speak do well to\nbuild up some of the musculature around\nthe spine to compensate for the thinness\nof that spine and would the person with\nthe heavier uh or thicker spine uh do\nwell to um try and encourage more\npliability of their discs somehow the\nanswer is yes but it's a very limited\nyes so if I can set the stage and and\ngive some context\nhere every system in the body requires\nstress for Optimal\nHealth think of the cardiovascular\nsystem the muscular sceletal system the\nendocrine system even the psychological\nsystem it needs stress to create\nadaptation for\nrobustness but you cannot cross what's\nknown as The Tipping point because if\nyou do you start building cumulative\ntrauma of some form whether it's\nemotional trauma psychologically or it's\ncumulative stress at the tissue level at\nthe level of the\ncell uh\nso we have to talk about those tipping\npoints we've got to Define where they\nare try and expand them adapt them but\ndon't cross them so with that context\nnow we can talk about\nuh a person's suitability for the\nstresses on different parts of their\nbody associated with different sports we\ncan talk about the rate at which the\nadaptation occurs the amount of Del\nloads and rest that are required all of\nthese things are genetically\ninfluenced um the way that they perform\nthe movement is going to move the stress\nconcentration here's an interesting uh\ndemonstration for you if you go to the\nOlympics and look at the podium winners\nof a javelin thrower they look identical\ndo you think the swimmers look like the\njavelin throwers no they don't but they\nlook like each other but they look like\neach other the people on the podium look\nvery similar in structure yeah let me\njust give another very poignant example\nof that consider a sport that has three\nvery separate demands of the athlete\nconsider a triathlete the triathlete has\nto swim a certain distance then they\nbike a certain distance and then they\nrun a certain\ndistance have you ever known a person\nwho comes out of the lake or the pool\nwhatever it is first winning the\ntriathlon it doesn't work that way what\nsuited them to be a fish fast in water\nuh they have to be somewhat floppy in\nthe ankles because they're creating a\nfish's fin longer in the\nTorso uh uh consider uh a uh a power\nlifter performing a butterfly stroke it\nwouldn't look very\npretty then they get on the bike where\nthey have to stiffen to stiffen the core\nI I don't know if you know bike design\nwell I'm sure you do you're paying for\nstiffness of the frame that's what a\nreally Elite not know that yeah so when\na person pushes on the pedal the frame\ndoesn't Flex because that would be an\nenergy leak you pay for a very stiff\nframe so every ounce of force that you\napply to the crank handle to propel you\nforward propels you forward instead of\nbeing wasted and bending the frame the\nsame way uh the the cyclist will lock in\non the bike they'll squeeze the saddle\nbetween their their their legs uh lock\ninto the bars lock their core down so\nthat when they uh create power power\nthrough the hips and through the legs\nit's transferred to the power it isn't\ntransferred to bending their willowy\nbody that is very different from the\nneurology and the mechanics of a swimmer\nnow let's run to\nrun uh the most efficient\nRunners store and recover elastic energy\nin tune\nSprings uh a wonderful book to read is\nthe the Lost Art of running but by Shane\nbenzy who studied the Kenyon Runners and\nhow they store and recover elastic\nenergy with each stride almost the same\nway as a kangaroo w a kangaroo is more\nefficient when it hops versus plotting\nalong using Ecentric concentric muscle\ncontraction\nso uh again the polar opposite of a\nswimmer it's a very tuned stiffness the\nmost efficient Runners for the Third Leg\nof the\ntriathlon pre- stiffen they have a\npre-contraction of the muscle so when\nthe foot hits the ground they're already\nstoring the elastic elements and they\nget that back for free but if the\nSprings were not tuned and they\nstretched away their muscles just to be\npassive Elements which serves them very\nwell in the swimming uh\nelement think of doing a pogo jump so\nyou're just pogoing through the ankles\nnow if you had no tone in the leg\nyou just flop into the ground and you\nwould have to use concentric Ecentric\nmuscle contraction but if you stiffened\ntoo much you're now a piece of iron and\nyou won't be able to jump either but\nyou'll get a beautiful resonance a\nbeautiful Pogo when you have the tuning\njust right so when a muscle contracts it\ncreates Force we all know this but\npeople don't appreciate you're also\ntuning the stiffness if I maximally\ncontract my muscles I can't move so\nathletes have to tune muscle if they're\nimpacting athletes but they also have to\npulse and relax pulse we're talking\nabout Mike Tyson before the uh podcast\ntoday and the mechanics of how he pulses\nand then he's got to relax to get\nclosing velocity of the Fist to the\nopponent and then when his fist hits the\nopponent he turns to Granite and it is\njust such an awesome experience to to\nfeel that a little bit it's one of the\njoys of my life working with Elite\nathletes to feel their athleticism but\nthen dissect it down as to how they do\nit so there's a lot in that but that\nlesson from the triathlete really shows\nus\nhow you can't be good at everything\nthere's always a trade-off with\nathleticism and the genetic part and\nthen of course in the appropriate\ntraining to\noptimize and express that\ngenetic gift through technique through\ntechnique so some athletes are very\nloose some athletes are very tight some\nare very elastic you won't hit a golf\nball 330 uh yards if you're not an\nelastic athlete you'll notice if you\nmeasure a golfer who can hit 330 yards\nthey don't test very strong they have a\nbeautiful\ntuned elastic\nbody uh you can almost see it if you've\nworked worked with enough of them\nthere's a smoothness to the muscle so\nunderneath the skin is a fascial\nnet someone who can throw a baseball 110\n115 120 mil an hour will be the same but\nnow you have a very asymmetric\nelastic effect so um I know that you\nloath and avoid\ngeneralizations um with good reason but\ngiven that most people people listening\nto watching this um are probably not\naiming to become Elite athletes I know\nI'm certainly not\num can we safely make at least one or\ntwo generalizations about what we each\nand all can do to try and avoid um let's\nsay back pain and\ninjury um it by either\ndiversifying our training or avoiding\ncertain types of training for instance\nlet's take the three major phenotypes um\nand and this is obviously not how the\nworld works but the classic you know\nectomorphic phenotype very thin very\nwillowy small joints long and live you\nknow um or\nlive the mesomorph thicker more muscular\num uh and then the so-called endomorph\nthe more heavier set maybe even carrying\nsome extra body fat Etc don't really\nknow what's under there they could fall\ninto either of the other two phenotypes\nI could imagine based on everything that\nyou're saying that A good rule of thumb\nwould be avoid the types of\nactivities that are outside of your\nnatural genetic\npropensity um based on body type at\nleast in the extremes like if you're not\nvery bendy don't do seven days a week of\nyoga okay but I could also Imagine the\nopposite which is if you're not very\nbendy do seven days of yoga because\nthat's going to allow you to become more\nbendy or the person that is naturally\nshaped more like a shot putter let's say\nthe myomorph or uh\nendomorph and you could say well um\nthere'd be great powerlifter I mean I\nknew kids like this in high school you\nknow PE class they're like okay weight\ntraining today none of us have done\nweight training and then the kid you\nknow lies down and you know and pushes\nyou know 3:15 you're like oh goodness\nyou know like that's that's wild\num but maybe they shouldn't be weight\ntraining if their goal is to be all\naround fit to be a which I think is the\ngoal of most people to be able to you\nknow carry some luggage at the airport\nwithout you know having to stop every\nonce in a while and suck for air to be\nable to you know lean down and grab\nsomething out of a cabinet you know you\nknow pick up a kid you know you know do\nsome hard uh labor in the yard you know\nmove some logs and things like that just\nbe able to do stuff without getting\ninjured without being so sore in the\nfollowing days that that you feel like\nyou need um extensive rehabil itation so\nagain I know you like to avoid\ngeneralizations but should\nwe make it a point to train against our\npredisposition in order to offset the\nimbalances that would otherwise occur or\nwould we be wise to lean into our\nstrengths and just not touch stuff that\nTaps into our\nweaknesses I understand the\nquestion the answer is I don't know but\nbut I know people will say oh this\nprofessor he he's avoiding the the\nquestion and I'm not going to do that so\nI'm going to tell you how I find the\nanswer and it's through assessment and\nI'm glad we're getting back to back pain\nby the way because it's my real uh the\nCornerstone of my\nexpertise our\nassessment is very\ncomprehensive it starts out by me simply\nasking the person tell me your story\nand some people never tell me about\ntheir pain when I ask them to tell me\ntheir story they will be telling me\nabout their family life and the\npressures that they have to still go to\nwork because they have two kids in\nschool or four kids in school\nor uh they might tell me about the\npassions that they have or they might\ntell me about their goals so the goals\nare the beginning of answer answering\nyour question\nAndrew we all know people who aren't\nsuited for a certain occupation or they\naren't suited or or they I'll take\nmyself for example I had a high school\ncareers counselor tell my father well\nMiguel he's not really suited\nacademically he should go to trade\nschool and so I I registered for for for\nplumbing school no I just R UBS cuz\nclearly that's not the way you went not\nthat going to Plumbing that going to\nPlumbing school would be a bad decision\nfor some but in your case you went a\nvery different direction I I think I\nwould have been okay as a plumber sure\nbut anyway uh my point in that is what\nare the\ngoals uh then the assessment I'm I'm\npaying attention to the person's\nlearning style how are we going to coach\nthem and then we get down to the details\nof their pain what's the nature of the\npain is it when they get out of bed in\nthe morning is it associated with a\ncertain activity is it associated with\ncertain motions postures or loads\nand uh hone does does the pain change\ndoes it start out on one side of the\nback and then later in the day it's in\nthe left glute or does it go down to\nyour right toes all of things these\nthings are telling me about the\nstability of the\npain uh it it's giving me Clues on what\nI'm going to assess then we go and\nassess them and it begins with what we\ncall provocative testing I'm\npurposefully provoking their pain if I\ncan provoke their pain I've nailed the\nmechanic if I can't provoke it it's not\nmechanical okay well that tells me\nsomething now so now I'm starting to see\num I know what their job is I know what\nsport it is they want to do I know\nenough about that job in sport that I\nknow the physical demands I know the\npsych uh the psychological demands do\nthey have what's required of the job or\nSport and then I test that if it\ntriggers their pain we have a problem so\nnow we have to focus the training very\nspecifically because people do not have\ninfinite training capacity they only\nhave so much and when you're hurt you\nhave even less so we try and focus on\nthings that are going to make a\ndifference to enable them to have the\nability to meet those specific demands\nthat we've identified so do you see how\nit's it's a long-winded answer but I I\nknow how to get there to know how to\ntrain them so now that we've recognized\nthe very specific nature of their pain\npathway and it may be something\nthat's going through the linkage in\nother words um when they uh run I I\ncould give you an example of if we put a\ngroup of Canadian hockey players on an\nelliptical trainer they don't do very\nwell because typical of the sport the\nhockey players tend to get stiffer in\nthe hips it's the way they are they\nskate a little bit flexed and they carry\nall Heavy skates and heavy equipment\ndown the legs they get stiffer in the\nhips when they go on the elliptical\ntheir hips don't have the range of\nmotion and their spine and pelvis\ngyrates with every rotation on the\nelliptical trainer the elliptical gives\nthem back pain if they already have\nmotion triggered back pain we take\nanother group who has mobile hips they\ndo very well on a tical\ntrainers the stress doesn't go into\ntheir backs so now do you see why I know\nwhy one group does well with elliptical\nthe other group does not I know why one\ngroup who they I'll give them uh a\nlateral sheer test which is basically a\nbear hug I pull their pelvis towards me\nas I hook down their shoulder in my\narmpit so I'm shearing their spine\nlaterally if that triggers their pain\nexactly I had a\npro hockey player the other day I gave\nhim the lateral Shear test and he had a\nright-sided flash of pain going around\nhis right flank it exactly replicated\nthe pain I just found with Precision the\nmechanism okay what's the antidote I put\nmy fingers into his oblique muscles and\nI said push my fingers out and he did it\ntoo hard he says oh no that that that\nhurts even more okay dial it back a bit\ntune what we're trying to achieve here\nhere fight me just a little bit I\nrepeated the formerly offensive test the\nsymptom was gone so now I'm getting more\nPrecision on knowing what I need to\ndo he was doing the Poff press the Poff\npress is a long lever exercise so you\ntake a load usually with a cable or a\nband that's held laterally and you\nincrease the length of the lever which\nyou have to resist because it's punch it\nout from the body yeah you try and it it\nit's causing you to twist but it also\ncreates a tremendous Shear load on your\nspine that was triggering his pain so we\ntook out the Poff press which for him\nright now is replicating his symptoms\nbut if you're playing in the NHL you\nshould be able to do a Poff press you\nfollow y yeah it it's it's a requirement\nof the rigors of professional hockey but\nhe can't do it now so this is informing\nthe programming that we're going to\ndo so if somebody has pain in a given\nmovement say standing up um after they\nsit for too long right um a particular\nstyle of hip hinge you know deadlift or\nor squat or when they run for\ninstance would it be wise for them to\nyou know think about the exact movement\nthat makes the pain the\nworst in the moment that they're doing\nthe movement or afterwards because often\ntimes pain will will arrive after we\nengage in a certain activity but during\nthe activity that pain is shut down\nwhich by the way is an interesting\nphenomenon on its own right and um you\nknow might be worth some uh mention as\nto like couple of the reasons why that\nthat occurs we always think oh blood\nflow it's warm but clearly it's it's\nmore it's much more than that more than\nthat yeah for sure um so let's say I've\nuh pain in a knee when I\nrun should I avoid running in that gate\nthat causes pain and work around it um\nseems to me that would be the The\nLogical choice right every person that\ncomes to us comes with back pain so\ninitially we avoid\nit we can have a neurological discussion\nif you like we can have a biomechanical\ndiscussion or we can have a\npsychological discussion we can take it\nin the framework of any of those if we\nlike if the pain is causing a\nsensitization I'm going to use the\nexample here of stubbing your toe you\nstub your toe once okay well it hurts a\nbit and the pain goes away fairly\nquickly but if every day you stubbed\nyour toe you would increase the\nsensitivity so that you don't have to\nstub it anymore all you have to do is\nlightly touch that sensitized toe and\nyou are going to have a\nmaladaptive heightened\nresponse so if we keep creating pain on\nthat toe it will never get better MH so\nwe have to start a desensitization wind\ndown which is tissue based but it's also\nneurologically based as\nwell and uh so so because everyone comes\nto us with\npain we work very hard to hack our way\naround it so let's say sitting uh causes\ntheir pain all right we'll find out that\nwhen uh we do a sitting test if they sit\nslouched that causes their pain when\nthey sit upright their pain goes away so\nI will give them a uh lumbar support\nwhich I'm just happening to use now I\nhad to sit on an airplane for 5 hours\nyesterday coming to see you and this\nallows me to not get back pain on the\nairplane while I'm sitting because if I\nsit flexed for 5 hours I will have a\ngrumpy back and I won't feel like when I\nget into the hotel to go for a walk\nwhich is uh and and train a bit because\nthat's what we have to do to create a\nstress below the Tipping Point to\noptimize\nhealth so it's it's the same thing in\nputting together the program first of\nall know the cause and try and eliminate\nit so we'll teach them uh you you know\nwe spend a lot of time with spine\nhygiene we teach them uh how to to hip\nhinge your squat we teach them how to\nLunge how to get to the floor we teach\nthem how to roll without twisting their\nspine into pain but using their ball and\nsocket joints uh we teach them how to do\na baby's\ncrawl uh which eliminates the Torso\ntwisting which in their current state\nwill offend the sensitized pain trigger\nthat must be humbling for adults to get\ndown and do a baby's crawl\nhey it's it's so humbling to take a\nworld record holding athlete and humble\nthem right back I as you know I've I've\nhad the current holder of the world's\nalltime record squat Brian Carroll and I\nBrian and I have written a book together\nso I can use his name what's the squat\nrecord\n1,36 PBS if you can believe that down to\nparallel down to parallel no no other\nhuman has has done that that was four\nyears ago now no one's replicated it\ndoes he wear a one of those elastic\nlifting suits when he does that he yeah\nso he's putting on an exoskeleton of\nstiffness but I want to come back yeah\nto how humbling it was to have someone\nwho already held World Records in\nsquatting in two different weight\ncategories and I had to show them how to\nget off the toilet but that's another\nstory and we both laugh at this now but\nthat was what pain had done pain had\ncorrupted his movement patterns and he\nforgot how to squat\nbut he held the world record that's how\ncorruptive pain is to the neurological\nengram and we can talk about inhibition\nand facilitation and all of the things\nuh I mean I'd love to have that\nconversation because I know who I'm\nsitting with the the neural aspects are\nfascinating when he does that um\nincredible squat poundage um does he\ntake the bar off a standard um squat\nrack and then walk it back or is he is\nit one of those ones where the bar is\nsuspended from two hooks and then he\ntakes it from there yeah so that\nparticular lift was lifted off a\nmonolith where he didn't have to walk it\nout so he takes it off so it's hanging\nfrom hooks then the hooks away the\nreason I ask is um it sounds like he's\noptimized for one very specific movement\nand a couple of you know uh couple of\nplanes and nothing else because walking\nwith a thousand plus pounds on one\nshoulders is also a feet and of itself\nokay shuffling backwards as it were all\nright you're not letting me off the hook\nwhich is fine so I've worked with\ncompetitors who compete in strong man\nand they can carry and walk with 1,000\nPBS on their shoulders it's called the\nsuper\nYol uh another client of of ours who uh\nheld the the world Wilks score in the\nipf international powerlifting\nFederation where they do not lift out of\na monolith they take the bar off a squat\nrack and they have to step back and that\nis uh if you don't have enough lateral\nAl strength and control in your torso\nthat's when you become hurt not during\nthe squat it's during the walk out so\nit's a trem it's a very different feat\nof strength so you're very astute to say\nlifting from a monolith is a different\nathleticism and strength distribution\nthen an ipf style where they lift off a\nrack and have to walk it out so you're\nstanding on one leg so can you imagine a\nth000 pounds coming down your axial\nSpine down your midline it hits your\npelvis and then it has to Shear across\nthe pelvis and go down the stance leg as\nyou're stepping back with the right so\nit requires tremendous strength to hold\nthe pelvic platform up on the swing leg\nside and uh so that that is a tremendous\ncore\nstrength component so best not be uh\ncarrying a willow spine for that one you\nwant to be like a like a a mirwoods\nredwood um well you want to be built\nlike Blaine Sumer who's another one of\nour\nuh clients I've worked with Blaine for\nquite a number of years I love the\nanalogy to dog breeds I love going to\ndog shows I've only done it a few times\nnot to actually see the Prancing around\nof the dogs that doesn't interest me at\nall best part about a a really excellent\ndog show as you go back behind the the\narena where all the different breeds um\nreside so you can see the lineup of the\nthe finest Irish wolf hounds the finest\num English bulldogs at Etc you hundreds\nof different breeds and you really get\nto see these genetic extremes not just\nof structure but of temperament and you\nget to see the similarity and\ntemperament of the Bulldogs and of\ncourse there's variation some of them\nare a bit more Jolly others more stoic\num you know the Terriers are magnificent\nin their own right um and as you pointed\nout earlier with respect to the podium\nmore similar to each other within breed\nthan across breeds in terms of\ntemperament but there's variation within\nbreed the reason I bring this up and the\nreason I bring this up now is that if\nyou look at the movement of those\nanimals even just the way they walk\nwhether or not they um enjoy a a flexion\nof the Paw as they stride or whether or\nnot they tend to stride differently I\ndon't have language for this I'm not an\nexpert in this but I have a visual\nsystem that works and I can see that\nthey may move differently they actually\nwalk differently even at the same Pace\num and then you look at human beings\nshorter taller medium more Li more heavy\nset um and it's amazing that we don't\ntake this into consideration that we all\nmove very differently even within\nspecies but that we we um B into these\ngroups so when someone walks into your\nlaboratory as it were your clinic SL\nlaboratory do you are you paying\nattention to how they move into the room\nirrespective of pain 100% I\nuh we we time the clients I see one in\nthe morning and 1 in the afternoon and\nthey're three-hour appointments so I\nknow when they're coming I watch them\nget out of the car if I can and that's\nwhen the assessment starts uh but just\nto go back to the dogs my sister is a\nvet her husband's a vet and her\ndaughters in vet training so we have\nthese conversations all the time do you\nknow she's already made an assessment of\nthat dog on how it's going to behave\nwhen she injects it or has to do a\nrectile exam or whatnot in what dog or\nbreed and even in cats which ones she's\ngoing to muzzle because she's usually\nright on on who's going to get bet H\nyeah and uh interestingly as well it's\nhow the uh dog feeds off the owner and\nshe can look at the owner and usually\ndetermine how the dog is going to behave\nso talk about the psychosocial millu\naround dog behavior\nabsolutely going back to your question\nwhen a person walks in so I've had gold\nuh have I had a gold medalist in Sprints\nyes I have from the\nOlympics uh I've had a silver medalist\nI've had just about every athlete that\nyou can and then a person walks in off\nthe street all with back\npain in your mind's\neye conjure up the image of a good\nSprinter do you think they have a flat\nlower back or do you think they have a\nlot of L dois which is an extend tension\nHollow in their low back a sprinter now\nwhat what will they have I recall seeing\nMichael Johnson sprinting very upright\nyes so when I think upright I think\neither you know flat lower back or a\nlittle bit of a of a of an arch in the\nlower back you know this kind of yeah he\nwas 200 meters wasn't he 2 and4 well I\nthink he was a 200 and 400 he was um\nwhich is unusual someone could win\ngolden both well I'll I'll think of some\nof the sprinters now the 100 meter men\nand women they you will find they have a\nlot more\nlordosis than the runners yeah they have\na and what that\ndoes uh I'll just explain the running\nmechanics here for a minute so if you're\nrunning along you have a center of mass\nyou have to bias the force under your\nfeet behind the center of Mass to propel\nyou forward because if it's in front of\nthe center of mass you're actually\nbreaking which wouldn't win you a gold\nmedal so footfall has to occur behind\nthe center of mass and then you get a\nvery brief period of time to create an\nextensor pulse and then recover the leg\nif you can pre-t turn the pelvis with a\nlot of lordosis in the spine you get\nmuch more power development behind the\ncenter of mass through the extensor\nrange if you have a flatback it's\ndifficult now you've just shortened up\nthe range that you can pulse into\npropulsive forces a Sprinter B the body\nyeah but you'll notice it's very\ndifficult for a sprinter to kick high so\nyou'll you know I I look at these\ndifferent forms in the combat athletes\nif you look at someone who can kick high\nin a round house they will tend to have\na flatter back so combat athletes tend\nto have a flatter back going back to the\nrunners you'll notice that the Michael\nJohnson's and the\nmore the runners with more distance have\na flatter spine they're more upright and\nthey're tuning that uh uh ability to\nstore and recover elastic energy where\nwhere the Sprinter out of the blocks\nit's horsepower it's concentric and\nEcentric muscle\npulsing but uh anyway there there there\nwould be uh an example since you you\nmentioned it with running uh the the\nstyle of running the event they're not\nrunning isn't running running is very\ndifferent and again look at the podium\nwinners of the sprinters versus the\n10,000 meters very different\narchitecture I'd like to take a brief\nbreak to thank one of our sponsors\nelement element is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need and nothing\nyou don't that means the electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium in the\ncorrect ratios but no sugar now I and\nothers on the podcast have talked a lot\nabout the critical importance of\nhydration for proper brain and bodily\nfunction research shows that even a\nslight degree of dehydration can really\ndiminish cognitive itive and physical\nperformance it's also important that you\nget adequate electrolytes in order for\nyour body and brain to function at their\nbest the electrolytes sodium magnesium\nand potassium are critical for the\nfunctioning of all the cells in your\nbody especially your neurons or nerve\ncells to make sure that I'm getting\nproper amounts of hydration and\nelectrolytes I dissolve one packet of\nelement in about 16 to 32 ounces of\nwater when I wake up in the morning and\nI drink that basically first thing in\nthe morning I also drink element\ndissolved in water during any kind of\nphysical exercise I'm doing especially\non hot days if I'm sweating a lot and\nlosing water and electrolytes if you'd\nlike to try element you can go to drink\nelement.com huberman spelled drink LM\nnt.com huberman to claim a free element\nsample pack with the purchase of any\nelement drink mix again that's drink\nelement.com huberman to claim a free\nsample pack I love where this\nconversation is going because there's\ntremendous variation in body shape and\nform out there and I'm certain that by\nnow everybody listening is starting to\nthink about oh am I more uh likely to\nhave a willowy spine a thinner spine or\na thicker\nspine the kind of pliability or um what\nyou call vertical stacking resilience\nthat a uh one spine or the other would\nhave um and it brings me back to this\nquestion of what can we each and all do\nto try and create the\nstrongest\nback as well as limit the propensity for\npain assuming we don't don't have it yet\nokay so um I would say I'm kind of in\nthe middle I'm neither extremely live\nnor am I shaped like a you know like a\nkettle bell kind somewhere in between um\nso for me I make it a point across my\ntraining week to include three\nresistance training\nsessions three quote unquote\ncardiovascular training sessions one\nlong one medium one short cardiovascular\nsession the lifting sessions are geared\ntoward building or maintaining strength\nin a balanced way for me everyone is\ngoing to have different requirements in\nother words nothing is skewed toward one\nparticular outcome like endurance or\nstrength or power and I think most\npeople probably want something similar\nbecause they'd like to be able to meet\nthe various demands of life so I frame\nthe question I'm about to ask that way\nbecause as people start to assess\nthemselves the question arises\nagain should we try and compensate for\nour weaknesses by emphasizing a certain\nstyle of training a little bit more and\nif so what does that look like for the\nspine you said earlier and I love this\nquote and I want to make sure I\nattribute it to you now and going\nforward that all systems in the body\nrequire Stress For Better Health Optimal\nHealth for op thank you for Optimal\nHealth so assuming that somebody has a a\na thinner stature they're more bendy\nwould they be wise to build up the\nmuscles of the core um not just the\nabdominals but the obliques and the\nlower back muscles you know all around\nthe spine in order to give it more\nstability and would the person who has a\nthicker torso thicker spine thicker\njoints do well to emphasize some\nadditional yoga training um some\nadditional um anything that allows them\nto be more bendy I'm going to go back to\nthe fact that they're coming to me with\npain we are going to figure out through\nthe thorough assessment what triggers\ntheir pain\nmost people it's true are don't want\nultimate performance they're not being\npaid $10 million to be able to throw a\nfast ball or something like that they\nwant to enjoy life let's say they love\ngolf my job is to get them sufficiently\nrobust and out of pain to go and play\nrecreational golf so it becomes a moot\npoint now whether they have a willowy\nspine or not I will look at their their\nbasic golf swing uh if I can divide that\nup just just binary uh some people are\nwhat we call Twisters they don't have a\nlot of hip mobility and they twist their\nspine so it's called The X Factor engulf\nand they store and recover elastic\nenergy again it it is an elastic\nathleticism but the next person isn't so\nmuch a twister they're a Turner they\nhave what we call Quick hips so their\nhips turn and their spines don't sustain\nas much twist and then we measure well\nwhen they impact the ball if they have a\n100% violent lateral Crunch and then we\nmeasure them and assess them and that\nturns out to be their pain trigger what\nwe do is we don't allow them to go to\n100% in lateral Crunch at impact they go\nto\n95% and that just moved them off the\nTipping Point so they're not stubbing\ntheir toe or slamming into the pain\nsensitizer just stay off the D\nsensitizer now so backtracking a little\nbit but making sure that I'm doing that\nwith purpose you need to know what\ngenerates the pain in order to try and\nlocalize the pain it all comes back to\nthe assessment but then the goal is not\nto repeat whatever creates the pain\ncorrect perhaps what I'm hearing the\ngoal is to get near the proximity of the\npain but not go there not generate the\nmovement that that recreates the pain\nbut you know take the movement as far as\none can without creating the pain and\nthen think about where the instability\nor weakness or biomechanical failure is\ncontributing to the\npain okay so now I understand why if I\ncan just add one I don't want to\ninterrupt but this is a good juncture\nAndrew then we get into the volume of\nexposure so remember the Tipping Point\nwe can have somewhat of an offense to\ntheir former pain but if we do it\nsparingly that's another key so it isn't\na matter of selecting the exercise\nsometimes as much as it is controlling\nthe volume and then having a period of\ntime off or a d load or whatnot so it\nmay simply be um I've I've got a an\nathlete that that comes to mind right\nnow in fact I I got a an email it wasn't\nan email it was a WhatsApp message oh I\njust won so she said an international\ntournament today and they play every day\nbut in getting her back it was a matter\nof we have to do these things that were\nformer pain triggers but control the\nvolume uh you can think of again combat\nathletes jiujitsu requires a lot of\nspine mobility and typically Jiu-Jitsu\nathletes get pain when they use too much\nspine\nMobility what we do is we limit their\ntraining in other words they have the\nskill of\njiujitsu but they don't need to push the\nend range every day because if they do\nthey're in so much pain they can't train\nso we back off the volume and I could\ntell you stories about professional\nfootball players they were their\nstrongest when they were in college\ntheir bodies can't take the heavy\nstrength training once they get into the\nNFL\nthey don't Squat and deadlift what they\nused to they're they're they're they're\nthey're they're they're limiting the\ndepth they're pulling off\nblocks it the game changes and it's not\nwhat people think and well and there's\nsome wisdom to to not pushing into pain\nand extremes all the time if the goal is\nto have a long Arc of Fitness or\nathletic career a good friend of mine\nwho's very accomplished in the fitness\nCommunity he says one of the best ways\nto get and stay in excellent shape your\nentire life is to train consistently\ntrain reasonably hard and we can talk\nabout what his recommendation is I'd\nlove your your thoughts but as best as\none can to not get hurt you know we\nforget about this we hear so much about\ntraining consistently and pushing hard\nbut the not getting hurt part is is key\nas well um here's his recommendation on\nintensity can I share it with you and\njust get your thoughts yeah okay I have\na short attention span can I just\nput add added value to that don't get\nhurt getting hurt is tremendously\nasymmetric let me uh do you know the\nbook by TB Nasim oh Nim TB Nim an\nantifragile yeah oh an antifragile he\nquotes our work he quotes my low back\ndisorders book as an example of\nantifragile\nmedicine interesting anyway um when when\nyou talk to uh\nuh uh\nTB in an economic sense if I gave you\n$100 to invest if you had a 50% gain\nyou'd end up with 150 bucks if you had a\n50% loss you'd end up with\n50 it's much more hurtful to lose 50\nthan the relative Jolly you would get of\ngaining 50 yeah there's some\nNeuroscience certainly some psychology\ncertainly some Neuroscience to support\nthat right in terms of how we reset our\num kind of uh reinforcement threshold\nright and so it is so asymmetric with\ninjury training if you push is taking a\nrisk you might gain a little bit in\nshort-term resilience or short-term\nperformance but you have a chance of\nreally screwing things up and an injury\nis really asymmetrically harmful MH so\nwhen we work with people and athletes we\nreally try and avoid injury because of\nthe asymmetry of the consequence injury\nis bad that's the first part that I I\nwanted to say the second part is people\ntrain hard and they feel a muscle burn\nand and they talk about muscle but they\ndon't talk about their joints and the\nkey to long life is don't mess up your\njoints you can train hard and build\nmuscle but muscle is adaptive and\nresilient\njoints are not so much and if you start\nmessing those up when you're younger by\ntraining too hard you'll find that oh I\nwas training at this intensity because I\nwanted to be strong when I'm 70 and 80\nthey'll find that no their knees ache\nthey can't get down on their knees\nanymore they have to crawl up a chair or\na wall very sad picture it it is don't\nmess up your joints so that's an\noverarching principle to of which the\nspine is one obviously\nbut uh that that's some wisdom with uh\ntraining intensely when you're young\ndon't base the outcome on\nmuscle think about the joints no it's ex\nexcellent recommendations for everyone\num his suggestion and by the way this is\nnot for competitive athletes this is\njust for\nexercisers uh if you will is to make 85%\nof one's workouts across the year at\nabout 85% of\nmaximal intensity and output so still\nconstraining the total length of a\nsession to whatever the goal of that\nsession is whether it's resistance\ntraining or cardiovascular training but\nto not go all out to go at 85% of one's\nsubjective understanding of what all out\non that day would be on that\nday to make 10% of one's workouts across\nthe year at somewhere between 90 to 95%\nintensity of what one could gener that\nday again 100% all out being subjective\nfor that day and then 5% or even less of\ntheir workouts all out everything you\ncould possibly give quote unquote\nleaving it all on the mat um whatever\nphrase one prefers and I like that\nrecommendation because it keeps things\nin check and it also creates an\nawareness of how intense one is training\nand it allows us to not um let the great\nnight sleep or the extra cup of coffee\nthat we had or the great song that\nhappens to be playing or the competitive\nof spirit that's arising because someone\njoined you that day or asked you to join\na workout to take you into the domain of\nharming yourself in fact I I can look to\nthe times when I've been injured\ntraining and almost always it's because\nsomebody invited me to join their\nworkout and we got into a little bit of\na competitive spirit and I'm not an\nultra competitive person but you know\nyou you push yourself to 100% on that\nday um and two weeks later you've got\nsomething you're dealing with or two\ndays later you've got got something and\nyou go God was that really worth it and\nI think unless one is a competitive\nathlete and that's competition day it's\nprobably not worth it right well I'm\nvery sympathetic to the overall\nsentiment of what you just\ndescribed but I think it's it's much\nmore individual than that you can take a\nyounger person and drive them quite hard\nas some trainers do and they have\nsuccess a young person responds they\nrecover faster Etc you try doing that to\na\n65-year-old and you'll find that they\ndon't recover as quickly they need many\nmore D Lo and rest days so if you go to\n85% you just committed to a 5day rest\nwell maybe that's not wise if you went\nto 50% you only need one day of rest\nbetween so do you see how you play and\nyou optimize this and it's like taper\nwhat we call tapering down an athlete or\nyou know in my life uh I have\nseasons uh up until two years ago I rode\nsnowmobiles hard in the winter two years\nago I hit a rock at 100 miles an hour on\na lake I fractured my spine you can spot\nthe professor so that was my passion I I\nI had to so my training would start in\nAugust every year I'd get into shape to\nride sleds fairly uh\naggressively I couldn't do it all year\nAndrew i' I'd become injured so I I\nwould have a cycle of three months\ngetting ready and then really have some\nfun um but obviously I I I don't do that\nanymore but my my point in telling that\nstory is uh I need much more information\nthan just okay\n85% you may get away with that when\nyou're 20 to 25 I don't think you're\ngoing to get away with that when you're\n50 as an\nexample as we optimize performance in\nour\nclients uh sometimes you got to leave a\nlot of gas in the\ntank because you want to train every\nother day\nuh certainly if you do two days in a row\n85% there's no way so do you see what I\nmean it depends on their age their\ninjury history their genetics and their\nbody type and all the rest of it what\nare we actually pushing to 85% is it a\ndistance on a run is it a deadlift\nweight uh that's pretty heavy yeah here\nI'm thinking about intensity meaning um\nwell for resistance training let's say\nthat one could uh complete six\nrepetitions at a given weight um but if\nthey had a gun to their head they could\ncomplete nine right um well then you're\ndoing six again this is crude crude\ncalculations right but six maybe seven\nmaybe cheating a little bit on that\nseventh repetition if it's a run and\nlike for me on Sundays typically there's\na long slow jog um but the slow in that\ncomponent is a little bit subjective so\nam I pushing a little bit harder than\nI'm comfortable or am I hitting kind of\na cruising Pace right okay so 85% of Max\nintensity for me would be staying at\ncruising pace and occasionally bumping\nup the the speed a little bit um but\non allout day if it happens to be one\nthen it's long quote unquote slow\ndistance but I'm trying to increase the\nspeed of what I'm referring to as slow\nso again this is all very objective but\nwe know on a given day whether or not\nwe're pushing past our comfort zone or\nnot um and I'm not somebody who relies\nheavily on heart rate monitors and\nthings like that um what I rely on is my\nconsistency this is the way that I've\ndecide to stay in allaround shape for\nyou\nknow more than three decades I feel like\nI'm in decent shape I'm not a great\nathlete I'll never be the strongest\nperson in the room or have the best\nendurance or the most speed or\nexplosiveness but I'm pretty sure I can\nkeep up with most things pretty well and\nI don't have pain and I feel very\ngrateful to not have pain and I think\nit's because I've adopted a a stance of\num I don't want to call it moderation\nbut of modulation well uh I I appreciate\nall what you've said in my world\neveryone has a back pain history so it's\nalways I just let the guy it's it's the\ninformation that we gather from the\nassessment that guides our decision on\nhow we're going to a get the mo of pain\nbuild some base resilience which is\ntuning their body strategic Mobility\nstrategic stability now if if one thing\nwe haven't talked about is is various\ntypes of pain and how yet that impacts\non how we're going to approach their\nprogramming for life you did a podcast\nwith somebody I I can't remember what it\nwhat their name was but it was a pain\npodcast\nand you were developing this idea that\nif\nthe mechanism of their pain was\nreally part of the changed engram they\nwere\ntraumatized at at the time of the event\nor maybe it was a history of sexual\nabuse or\nwhatever but I can detect that person\nalmost always I'll start to put my hands\non them to feel oh is there any\nintelligy here and they\nrecoil that's an abused person\nthat's a that's a very characteristic\nresponse so you start putting together\nsome of these reactions and and you and\nyou note that there's something deeper\nthan an injury to a part of their spine\nyeah we had um Dr sha Mackey that was it\nyeah Dr Shawn Macky is our um head of\nthe essentially the pain division at\nStanford School of Medicine um he's an\nMDM PhD and he's a big proponent of the\nbioc psychos social model of pain which\nprobably makes sense for us to discuss\nnow as the name suggests it incorporates\npsychological elements it incorporates\nof course physiological elements and it\npoints to as I recall seven or more sort\nof paths to dealing with pain some of\nwhich include um thoughts about one's\nemotional state stress level um sleep um\nI mean all of these things clearly play\na role in pain and Rehabilitation from\npain\nright I love that uh podcast by the way\nbecause it's so consistent with what\nwe've found and what we\ndo if a person\nhas it was just a\nmechanical exceeding of their Tipping\nPoint and they now have some tissue\ndamage we address that by creating a\nstrategy that they don't move or load in\na way to stress that and we allow the\ninjury to heal if we can and and we\nshould talk about whether the the the\ndisc adapts or you have to manage it but\nbut that's another very interesting\ntopic to get into but\nnonetheless we are tuning their body\nwith strategic mobility and\nstability uh giving them core exercise\nunleashing their hips and shoulders\nEtc and we will have a reasonable level\nof success and We Know by the way what\nour success is because uniquely we\nfollow up with every patient we see to\nknow if we were successful or\nnot but now we have that person and I\ncan think of many examples just to give\na spectrum perhaps the person was in a\ncar accident they survived but the\nperson beside them who might have been\ntheir mother died so now they're\ncarrying a hell of a lot of emotional\ntrauma guilt\ntrauma maybe they knotted off at the\ntime of the accident they were driving\ntremendous psychological stress maybe\nthey were sexually abused or\nwhatever that rewires their brain so now\nthey come in and the pain pattern\ndoesn't fit we do\nphysical stressing of their various\ntissues and the reactions they change\ntheir very they're they're they're not\nwhat they should\nbe the way that their brain perceives\nthe pain has been\nrewired if we give them the traditional\napproach of giving them more Fitness and\nability it won't work we can't break\nthrough that maladaptive\nresponse we completely change now it\nmight be just to desensitize and you'll\nlaugh at this we might get a feather and\nbrush it over further back and they say\noh yeah that that triggers my pain\nreally yes oh now I'm getting a\nheadache okay so we have to come up with\nwhat can they do without triggering that\nmaladaptive response and it might be\nthat simply the most simple of movements\nwhere the affrant and Ence all the\ninformation going into that\nengram which is forly triggering pain we\nnow figure out what it is that doesn't\ntrigger pain and then slowly desensitize\nit with repetition never triggering pain\nand then we expand that repertoire so\nyou've heard of\nfibromyalgia which is a little bit of a\ncatchall term\nbut a flashing\nlight uh surprising someone they're\nwalking down the street and someone\ncomes out of a shop and and surprises\nthem somehow and that triggers off this\nmassive pain\nresponse uh we do that with very gentle\nlove doing the things that doesn't cause\npain and and try and slowly expand that\nengram into a pain-free\none there are those in uh what's called\nwork hardening it's usually funded by\ninsurance companies so if you have\nintransigent back pain we are now going\nto get you to do your job we start out\nwith an hour a day you're a brick layer\nyou're going to lay bricks for an hour\ntomorrow you're going to lay for an hour\nand a half and occasionally they have\nsome\nsuccess or they have some really\nmiserable failures and the person says I\ncannot do another day of brick laying\nfor four hours even though it's only a\nportion of my job and so now they get\nkicked out of the program because\nthey're called a non-compliant in other\nwords there's something psychological\nwrong with\nthem and they're shattered those are the\npeople we\nsee so these These are you know talk\nabout the bioc psychosocial\napproach I I know I get labeled\nsometimes as the biomechanist and I\nignore all the psychosocial but these\nare people who've never read our work\nand they don't know it so I really\nappreciate you bringing this because I'm\nnot a often asked uh this perspective\nbut again I know with your background\nyou'll appreciate all of this yeah\nsurely the you know the nervous system\nis involved in generating movement and\nfeedback from the muscles and propri\nreception and uh as you're describing\nthe nervous system uh creates our sense\nof pain there's an emotional component\nto it as Dr Macky pointed out and as\nyou're reinforcing and the neural\ncircuits that control quote unquote pain\nor give rise to pain um involve the\nConfluence of all of these things at\nsome level and I I appreciate that\nyou're willing to go into this\nbiopsychosocial model of pain and and\nacknowledge it um because I think all\ntoo often in this space of biomechanics\nand and pain and back pain in particular\num people you in some cases get labeled\nas only subscribing to one particular\npattern of Remedy or one particular\nframework and that's simply not true\nit's just not true um in fact I'll go so\nfar as to say that that's actually a\nreflection of other people placing a\nsingular lens on you and your work as\nopposed to your work having a singular\nlens I know that you look at things\nthrough the um rather complex prism that\nis back pain and back\nRehabilitation um so thank you for\ntouching into the biopsychosocial model\nand we'll put a link uh in the show note\ncaptions to that episode with Dr Macky\nbecause he went into this in some some\ndepth and so it it is the case that\nwe've covered uh that model in um in\npretty extensive detail there's\nsomething that uh you said to me once\nthat I really want to make sure we\nhighlight which is that people who\nembark on a particular style of training\nnot just sport selection but style of\ntraining like resistance training with\nheavier weights versus endurance\ntraining running longer distances or\nswimming longer distances will sometimes\ncultivate a certain should we call it\npersonality style or reactivity style\nthat is probably independent of who they\nstarted off as I mean you can never\nseparate these things completely I mean\nwe we could argue um people who have a\nlot of mental endurance pick endurance\nsports or people that are rather\nballistic in their personality here I'm\nplaying psychologist um pick sports with\na lot of speed and Ballistic uh motion\ninvolved but perhaps the reverse is also\ntrue that the more we engage in\nactivities for which the nervous system\nis required to generate a particular\npattern of movement like ballistic\nmovement or endurance or strength that\nwe exacerbate certain aspects of our\nmental self our emotional self as well I\nrealize this is not the stuff of um\ndetailed peer-reviewed studies\nnecessarily or at least I'm not aware of\nthem but in your experience working with\na variety of different people from the\ngeneral population who engage in\ndifferent activities as well as athletes\nwho engage in very different activities\nand let's keep in mind the discussion we\nhad earlier about dog breeds they are\nselected for not just based on physical\nfena type and movement but also\npersonality type right temperament\nwhat sort of broad correlations have you\nobserved in say endurance Runners do\nthey have more mental endurance for\nother activities versus say strength\nathletes or sprinters do they tend to\nhave less but tend to excel in other\ndomains of their mental life you're\nright in that I haven't seen good\nscience to back up this whole\nissue but after working with people for\n40 years\nyears and seeing the extremes of the\nphenotype I I do have some opinions on\nthis and it comes from coaching so if\nyou take an athlete who has by Nature\nthey're very explosive neurologically\nthey're quick they're explosive but they\ncan't do it for very\nlong it's almost and I I hate using this\nlabel but it's it's just a way to\ndescribe it they have a tension deficit\nnow I've been told I have this every\nHigh School teacher would have told you\nyeah Miguel he's attention deficit is\nnow maybe it was just I wasn't\ninterested in what they were talking\nabout my brain was thinking about\nsomething else but I I I think I do have\na certain degree of attention deficits\nif someone's not holding my attention\nI'm thinking of something that's more\nimportant the more explosive the athlete\nis the shorter the time you have to\ncoach them that they're present with\nyou the less explosive they are the more\ntime you have to coach them so I will\nsay that I find that really interesting\num and I can think of a number of self-\nexperiments uh that I'd like to embark\non of you know including more endurance\ntraining at particular times of year and\nseeing how that correlates with um\nmental focus and endurance for say\nwriting or preparing podcasts things of\nthat sort um but of course now that I\nhave some sense of what the answer could\nbe I'd be biasing the the outcomes but\nif it's a self- experiment and the goal\nis simply to to shift one's um uh mental\nlife or or behavior then I don't know\nthat it matters that much C can I go\nwith a little anecdote there that you\nmay appreciate I'll get a call from a uh\na coach say an MBA coach and it'll be uh\nwith their medical staff and they'll say\nwe have this\nplayer they play 18 minutes a game can\nyou help and they have a back pain\nhistory could you help us to get them to\nplay 27 minutes a game and then I'll\ninvestigate and understand the player\nand then I I may ask a question to the\nuh coach what\nputs paying bums in the seats in the\nstadium and they'll say well what do you\nmean and I said well it's that player\nthat we're talking about that player is\nmagical for the 18 minutes that they\nplay because they're Sparky they're\nexplosive if we train them and they have\na plastic physiology and neurology that\nwe can train so that they can last 27\nminutes you realize that you're trading\noff the\nexplosiveness you cannot have a really\nhigh V2 Max and be maximally explosive\nthey're competing mechanisms one's a\nfast twitch mechanism for Speed and\nexplosiveness and the other one one is\nan endurable\nphysiology and you trade one for the\nother so do you really want\nto compromise that\nexplosiveness and and you see this when\nyou're uh uh on a team getting a uh\ncombat athlete ready if they are\nneurologically explosive you design the\nfight and the training that they pretty\nmuch have to win in the first round and\nif they don't win in the first round\nthey're going to gas out and uh the\nperson who is uh preparing to compete\nagainst them is training to survive the\nfirst round and then come on in the\nsecond so they're training\nendurance to compare those two different\nathletes from a psychological point of\nview uh and if you do it enough I I\nthink you'll come to agree with me and\nyou will notice that there is how you\ncoach them uh it it has to be short\nconsumable\nbites and and it's not that they're any\nmore or less\nintelligent they get it but but you have\nto be on Q and choose your words be\nefficient do you see what I mean the\ncoaching style changes quite a bit do\nyou think that if somebody has\npain that they should have the capacity\nboth to like lean into and push into the\npain not exacerbate it but to you know\nsit with with it and and feel it as\nopposed to just avoiding it how should\npeople think about their own pain and\nhow to work with it that's the reason\nI'm asking right it depends and it's a\ndance so I can give you some examples\none one chapter in my back mechanic book\nit's called well it's about surgery and\nshould you have\nsurgery we did this uh because as you\nknow in our experimental clinic at the\nUniversity we followed up with every\npatient we ever\nsaw we would assess them and then we\nwould subcategorize them into different\nbins if a person was told you've tried\neverything you've been to the\nchiropractor you've been to the physical\ntherapist the osteopath you've had a\nsurgical consult uh you've been to the\npsychologist Etc and you failed every\nsingle one of them so basically you've\nbeen conditioned to fail\nwe tried a process called virtual\nsurgery so I'm defining the group now\nyou've tried everything and you've been\ntold the last thing for you is surgery\nthat's the subcategory of people that\nwe're now going to talk about and I'll\nsay fine you can go and roll a dice and\nhave surgery most of them don't want it\nobviously and I'll say but what we're\ngoing to do is try virtual surgery and I\nmake a bit of a a production out of it I\nanoint them like a knight I touch them\non the shoulder and I say that's your\nsurgery and I'm looking into their eyes\nand now I give them one of\nthese we're looking into each other's\nSoul now you've had surgery you're going\nto behave like you've had surgery\ntomorrow your first posts surgical\nrecovery day you're going to lay in bed\nrelax get up for a pee every 2 or three\nhours have short little shuffles the\nnext day we'll add a little bit more Etc\nwe give you a posts surgical recovery\nprogram a really good one and then we\nstart tuning the body strategically\nstability Mobility eventually adding a\nlittle bit of endurance long before\nstrength and then getting the movement\npatterns\nEtc if the person was an exercise addict\nas well so you can imagine the person\nwho has the personality that you're\ndescribing\nthey tell me in the interview you know I\nhave to ride the elliptical for 40\nminutes every day because if I don't I'm\ngoing to murder my kids and my husband\nbecause that's my stress relief oh my\ngoodness not not literally but that's\nwhat they'll say as a as painting the\npicture that person a treadmill right or\nexercise okay so they've won that\nnegotiation with every previous\nclinician well they're not going to win\nit with me because all I care about is\noutcome my job is to get them\nbetter by whatever means\nso uh I have to tame that surgery Works\nin a lot of cases because it's forced\nrest surgery for that exercise addict\nforced them to have rest and allowed\nthem to desensitize so we fake it and we\ndo it now for the evidence we followed\nup with every patient and in a 2-year\nfollow up 95% of those people who\navoided surgery but did the virtual\nsurgery\nwe're glad that they did yeah that\nanswers the question it's uh follow the\nadvice of the\nclinician and it gets back to this issue\nof of predisposition to move a certain\nway to therefore avoid other forms of\nmovement to engage in certain activities\nbut not other activities I I realize\nthat I'll get in trouble if I say you\nknow 70% of the training that we do\nshould be in line with our\npredisposition and 30% should be uh\ncountercurrent to that but I'm kind of\nveering towards numbers more or less\nlike that right I mean we know for\ninstance in the um machine learning\nalgorithms that relate to learning in\nthe nervous system that a rough this is\na rough estimate of difficulty should be\nabout uh 15% of questions or challenges\nso these could be cognitive challenges\nor physical challenges should lead to\nfailures noninjurious failures getting\nthe answer wrong about 15 % of the time\ntends to optimize learning across a\nnumber of different domains okay like is\nthat true for everything is it true for\nlanguage math dance is no but it's true\nfor a lot of things that's an argument\nthat's used a lot and I I\nuh however as I said I've I've done the\nwork and I've done the followup and I\nhave an opinion for a\nreason we start out by giving them the\ntools to not have pain from a physical\npoint of view uh that's really important\nfrom a psychological point of view we've\njust empowered that person they are now\nin control because they never had the\ntools a they didn't understand what the\nreal mechanism of pain was so they had\nno strategy to downregulate it if I'm a\nneuroscientist or to desensitize it but\nnow they know with some Precision what\nthe moves the loads the activities are\nthat cause their pain they know the\nCounterpoint points what actually are\nbeneficial for their pain and they begin\nthis life of having as little pain as\npossible now I go back\nto uh the Tipping Point and all systems\nneed stress but in the beginning we\ncannot cross the Tipping Point and\nthat's really the essence of your\nquestion when do we start pushing them\nnow to allow a little bit of pain some\npeople start it way too early we do not\nwe know where that Tipping Point is and\nwe keep building the training capacity\nof being pain-free until we have a\nmargin of safety now it's that margin of\nsafety that we start to play with can we\nexpand the volume of\ntraining and get them ready to go back\nto work or to go back to their sport or\nmaybe they just want to play\nrecreational golf we've talked about\nthat eventually we're going to go to the\npoint where they're we're butting up\nagainst The Tipping Point now now we\nhave another conversation remember what\nthe goal\nis how important is it for you to set a\npersonal past and deadlift or to play 18\nholes of golf 5 days a\nweek would you settle for three and and\nnow they they've had a year of no pain\ntheir life has changed they're they're\nthey're they're mentally in a different\nplace uh they have their answer and they\nthey converged on it themselves I'm not\n18 I'm 55 years of age I've got two\nyoung grandkids I'm looking forward to\nplaying golf with them when I'm\n75 so do you see how when we bring them\nthrough that\nway accepting a certain amount of pain\nthat's that's more of a younger person's\nOutlook there's still some Warriors left\na lot of us soften up as we when as we\nget older but you know I just think of\nmy own journey I trained heavy as a kid\nand I remember remember my dad saying\nwhy are you doing this you're you're you\nknow you're really shortening your\nathletic career not that I had one but\nuh you know and uh he was right and now\nmy my training has totally changed but I\nas you know I I have no pain I I uh I'm\nI'm still fairly physical yeah you're in\ngreat shape at 67 yeah just just remark\nremarkable shape for those listening and\nnot watching I encourage you to take a\nlook at the top card or the YouTube\nvideo I mean stew is moves around great\nand um and you're I mean well your your\nposture is great and you're you're an\nawesome shape for any age um much less\n67 um so that's a testament to your\nmethods well the the point\nwas it's okay to push when you're\nyounger you don't have the capacity to\npush now if I go into pain I'm in pain\nfor a few days not an hour so you're\ncautious yeah and older people will will\nget to that point\nI'd like to ask you about Mill's big\nthree I know that again you loath to um\nimpart generalizations on people but at\nsome point you realized that people need\nsomething to do to work with in order to\ntry and quote unquote pain prooof their\nback or reinforce their back so um we\ndid a video that um included the big\nthree we'll provide a link to those in\nthe show note captions where I perform\nthe big three probably not perfectly\nadmittedly um I I should have invited\nyou to critique my form and we can\nalways shoot another another one of\nthose but I think it captures the big\nthree well enough um the bird dog the\nroll up and the side plank right um\ndesigned to build strength and stability\naround the spine and to Stave off back\npain or some cases rehabilitate back\npain an enormous number of people wrote\nto us and commented how much the big\nthree have helped them so I just want to\nmake sure that it's clear that despite\nthe fact that you are appropriately\nreluctant to say that the big three is\nthe solution to everything in terms of\nback pain for everyone they have helped\na a large large number of people um\navoid and in some cases rehabilitate\nback pain if you were to add a\nfourth exercise to the big\nthree what would it be depends on the\nassessment\nlet's say somebody has a willowy spine\nand they want more spine stability they\nwant to be able to generate more spine\nrigidity for whatever purpose what are\ntheir pain triggers uh they have a lower\nback pain on one that's unilateral um\nand when they sit too long and then\nstand up it feels like that that side is\nlocked up and there's some pain shooting\ndown the leg okay so they've got\nmechanical back pain they've got\nneurological involvement if it's\nshooting down the leg how old are they\nearly 50s maybe in their 40s or older a\nbig range so they will have some\ndiscogenic disorder there's there's a\ndisorder of the\njoint and uh it will be causing the\nnerve to react uh in such a way and when\nthey walk a bit 10 15 minutes they tend\nto feel better ah okay so they have a\nyounger spine because uh discogenic\ndisorders are more common among younger\npeople and sitting is the causitive\npathway going for a walk is the\nrelieving pathway but that will switch\nover when they get uh older is that\nright yeah sitting becomes the relief\nand walking then becomes the uh\nexacerbator of their\npain well again I need to know with some\nPrecision what the uh pathway is but if\nthey have neurological uh Parts I need\nto know why what makes them worse so I\nmight have them sit upright in a chair\ngrab the seat pan of the chair and pull\nup I'm adding compression does that\ncause more nerve uh radiation if it does\nthey've got a little bit of compression\nintolerance okay so now I have to choose\nan exercise that is not compressive uh\nBy\nNature um if I move the nerve so if I\nextend their leg at the same time asks\nthem to look up it releases the\nwhole spinal cord and all the nerve\nroots from above and it pulls it from\nBelow in other words it flosses it\nthrough if that causes pain as they're\ndoing it they've got nerve friction if\nthey do it and it's tensile tension then\nit's it's nerve tension so these are\nthese are very different uh uh\nmechanisms of their pain and they\nrequire different approaches so do you\nsee why I'm still hedging on that that\nthat next exercise it might be\nmobilizing the nerve it might be giving\nthem more thoracic spine extension\nthrough a thoracic uh and now they've\ntaken the load off when they sit and uh\nstand so you can imagine standing you\ncan palpate your erector spine a muscles\nand they might be relaxed you poke your\nchin and those muscles come on and if\nthe but it the cramp was on one side and\nif it was muscular that's probably not\nrelated to this uh that's still a very\ndiscogenic sign there's a bulge or\nthere's something off that's mechanical\nthat we will determine I might just say\nwalk more but not in a single dose and\nand again I've described all of this in\nin back\nmechanic instead of walking an hour in\none dose have three 20 minute walks\nwalking for an\nhour increase the risk of getting pain\nwalking for 20 minutes guaranteed you\nhave no pain so do it in three doses\nyou've just guaranteed success so I\nmight add another exercise but I might\nprogram it very strategically as well\nwhat are your thoughts on um inversion\ntables and anti-gravity boots um and\nthings to deload the spine right well uh\nagain if you you follow our work we do\nuh do uh D loading of the spine through\ntraction uh it's usually applied by one\nof our trained\nclinicians and the reason for that is\nlet's take that younger person again as\nyou just described maybe laying on their\ntummy as they exhale they allow the low\nback to sink into the table increasing\nthe lordosis which is we measured this\nin the lab if they have a posterior disc\nbulge with an open Fisher which is\nprobably one of the more common ones the\nthat maneuver Vacuums in the disc Bulch\nif that immediately reduces the pain\ndown their leg I would say lay prone and\nhave someone pull on your legs along the\nplane of the table five or six pounds\nper leg now the next person comes in and\nsay oh that hurts well now we play what\nwe call Jazz this is the art of therapy\nI'm playing with how we're going to\napply a twisting torque to their feet M\nno no decompression table does all of\nthis it doesn't have the art it's it it\nit's more of a brutal hammer and to\nreally get difficult people because\nremember no one has back pain and says\noh I think I'll go see Miguel it doesn't\nwork that way we only get the ones\nwho've failed 10 previous\nattempts every other every other\ntreatment no we've got to know we've got\nto have some skills here well I started\ndoing the big three on the basis of your\nbook um and it certainly has help my\nlower right side back pain that\noccasionally flares up I also noticed\nI've gotten stronger in various lifts\nbut the most Salient consequence has\nbeen when I run I feel like my torso can\num uh stay more upright as I can kind of\ncycle my legs underneath me like I'm\npedaling on a bike and I feel like I\nhave endurance for days that's exactly\nwhat you should feel so you've improved\nthe cylinder\nso the diaphragm pumps up and down\ninside the cylinder to allow you to lung\nventilate if you don't have that\nathletic diaphragm you're entraining\nyour abdominal muscles the oblique\nmuscles to the breathing effort while\nyou're running it wears you out it also\ncompromises your spine so you need those\nmuscles to form a girdle and hold it all\ntogether now I know enough of your\nhistory that I suspect you will have a\nlittle bit of a disc bulge\nI do yeah I had a whole body um scan\nright um for just you know for fun I\nguess is the sort of thing I do for fun\nand indeed there's a I think it's like\nan L3 L4 bulge uh on one side which is\nfully consistent with the the pattern of\npain that I've had right um and I've\nmanaged to avoid for a number of years\nnow doing um Cobra type pose um these\nkinds of things the Cobra doesn't work\nfor everybody but it is a\npowerful vacuum in of certain types of\ndis bulges so I'm glad it works for you\nand you found it and it will work for\nsome others or it will make the pain\nworse than some others and there's tests\nfor figuring that out I notice if I\ntravel and it forces me to sit for long\nperiods of time and then the next day I\ntrain with any kind of hip hinge\nmovement it flares up again right don't\nforget to use your Lumar on the airplane\nright yes Dr Mill gave me this uh little\npillow they call it the Lumar that\ninflates you put in the lower back and\nit's um It's a Wonderful tool right um\nthat gives you\nresilience for travel if one didn't have\naccess to that um they could just roll\nup a towel and put in their lower back\nAB absolutely yeah or sitting in a\nlecture uh if they're a student travel\nwith it sitting in a restaurant people\nwho go and say oh my back's killing me\nafter sitting in that booth in the\nrestaurant you might get some funny\nlooks but you'll be the person still\nmobile and not complaining about your\npain uh when everyone else is is\ngrunting I'm past the funny looks I'm\nI'm okay with that that's that's a\nthat's an advanced neuroplasticity trick\nthat comes with age yeah I'm right there\nwith\nyou I have a a question about walking\nyeah um these days we're hearing more\nand more about benefits of walking after\nmeals walking several times per day\nblood sugar regulation I think it's all\nwonderful anything that gets people\nmoving in healthy ways um I think is\nterrific\nwhen it comes to walking uh none of us\nwant to be the person paying careful\nattention to our gate especially when\nwe're not in pain and things of that\nsort but if you were going to recommend\na daily walk is there a duration and\nspeed that you think you know could be\nbeneficial in terms of staving off back\npain um just you know General posture\nthings of that sort are we talking about\na Brisk 5 minute walk or a Brisk 20\nminute walk this kind of thing I'm with\nyou\n100% with the notion that walking is one\nof the most healthy things you can do I\nget stuck a little bit when you want me\nto give numbers in a generic broad\napplication ranges are fine if I saw the\nperson uh and they have a back pain\nhistory I would\nknow uh a should I just leave walking\nalone and tell them to walk it's quite\nfine that's not your problem but we\nstill want you to walk three or four\ntimes a day but I I I know what the\nquestion is and you want some general\nrules on all of this um don't walk to\npain so if your Tipping Point is 40\nminutes you can't go and for a 40 minute\nwalk you've just guaranteed that you\nwill be unsuccessful in having a\npain-free day but can you walk 20\nminutes\ngood walk 20 minutes three times a day\nnow you've got a full hour of pain-free\nwalking guaranteed so it was the\nexposure and how you dosed it throughout\nthe\nday um if the person has discogenic back\npain they will find that they don't like\nto stand in one position for very long\nsit in one position for very long or do\nany single activity for a long period of\ntime so the the key for their daily\nregimen is to keep changing posture so\nsomething like a sit stand desk desk at\nwork would be a really good idea but now\nthe magic comes if they could sit for 20\nminutes stand for 30 minutes and walk\nfor 10 now that was the magic that just\nof the dosing that uh allows them to do\ntheir job as a computer programmer or\nwhatever it is where they're a slave to\nthe computer there's no option so\nthere's an idea uh there um in my own\nlife it's a habit I walk after every\nmeal I walk before I go to bed and\nthat's my time with my wife and my dog\nand it's it's our\nroutine and it is uh even when we we we\ntravel in the winter we Drive South we\nbreak up the drive and we do our walks\nand uh it keeps us painfree if i s it\ndoesn't matter who you are if you sit\nall day uh chances are you will cause\npain I can talk about damage which is\ninteresting we've probably loaded more\nspines than any other laboratory in the\nworld I I think that's a fair thing to\nsay if we put a cadaveric spine that is\nwhat we call a virgin spine in other\nwords it came from a young donor it\nwasn't traumatized uh so there's no\npre-existing cumulative damage to it if\nyou put it in a sitting posture you\ncannot create new injury so if a person\nhas never had back pain and I can give\nyou an example you know that the person\nthat they're probably overweight and all\nthey do is sit it's so unfair they don't\nhave any back pain and then their\ncolleague is much more fit they go to\nthe gym every day they have back pain\nand and and they think this is so unfair\nbut what they didn't realize is they are\nnot training wisely at the gym they they\nare probably uh going far too hard in a\nshort period of time with too much\nintensity and they're creating a little\nbit of microt trauma so now they just\nmade sitting painful so so do you see\nwhat I mean you can't injure the spine\nsitting if if you have no pre-existing\ninjury but if you have pre-existing\ndelamination of the collagen an old disc\nbulge sitting for a long time will then\nmake it painful if ever there were two\nexercises that bring to mind Notions of\nback strengthening and potentially back\npain it's the deadlift and the\nsquat what are your thoughts on\ndeadlifts and squats as a function of\none 's age one's perhaps phenotype Ecto\nEndo or\nmyomorph or any other factors that would\nlead you to say yes deadlift Endor squat\nno don't deadlift Endor squat or maybe\nyou should deadlift Andor squat okay uh\nthose who know me know it could be any\nof those three\noptions at the highest level every\nexercise is a tool and it's a tool to\nreach a specific goal so in our world of\nlimited capacity when a person is fresh\ncoming out of back pain or they're\ntraining to really achieve something\nphysically have they defined the goal\nand have they chosen the best\ntool to keep as much capacity as they\ncan for training other things that\nreally\nmatter the deadlift is an an\nextraordinary exercise and and as you\nknow I I don't know of anyone who's been\ninvolved with\nmore world class deadlifters than myself\nthrough the back pain uh\nrelationship so you know on one hand I\ncan say well I love the deadlift and on\nanother hand I can say I hate the\ndeadlift I can tell you Andrew that if\nyou take the clients who ask for\nconsults now and they're under 30 years\nof age I will say half of them will say\nin their interview with me it started\nwith a deadlift so I would say that is\ngetting onto the category of an\nepidemic and yet I will still tell you I\nlove the deadlift so there's a lot of\nvariables here a lot of moving\nParts the deadlift is a tremendously\nneurologically dense exercise whether\nyou're lifting a light weight or a heavy\nweight I love these bodybuilding uh\ncharts that say oh well to do a deadlift\nit it it lights up the erector spine a\nthe glutes and the and the quads perhaps\nevery single muscle of the body should\nbe involved to a deadlift every single\nmuscle there are no agonists and\nantagonists every muscle the full fasal\ncomplex will be tightened up to take the\nslack out to pull a bar from the ground\nthat's a good deadlift\nuh that's what minimizes the risk of\ninjury and as you know competitive\ndeadlifters will actually put on a\nexoskeleton of even more fascial\nstiffness it's called a lifting suit but\nnot everybody obviously is uh in that\ncategory now I'm going to talk about one\nof the most potent Pathways to disc\nherniation so we have the disc from an\nanatomical point point of view it's a\ngel core wrapped with layer upon layer\nconcentric layers of collagen fibers\nthat in order to get a dis bulge or a\ndisc herniation they needed to\ndelaminate and the gel nucleus when it's\npressurized under a heavy Bend will seek\nthe weak spot between these fibers work\nthrough the delamination and create a\ndis bulge\nthere's been several recent studies now\nthat have done assays investigations of\nthe harvested nucleus in a in a disc\nsurgery more than half the time that\nharvested nucleus contain fragments of\nbroken end plate broken end plate comes\nfrom excessive compression and then you\ngo into the history of the person oh\nwell maybe they fell on ice and they\npile drived their back there's a\ncandidate mechanism to create small\nfractured bits of end plate but then\nthey will say no this whole discernation\nstory it started with a deadlift two\nyears ago my back got a bit Tweaky after\nthat I kept deadlifting and what not and\nthen they find the fragments of bone so\nmore than half of that harvested nucleus\nshows evidence of an overload and\ncompression when you put that together\nwith with with the history and again\nit's it's not the fault of the deadlift\nit's the fault of the\nprogression uh there are some trainers\nwho will take a person from an unfit\nState through to lifting in a deadlift\ntwice their body weight in half a year\nwhen you look at the stimulus to bone\ngrowth it takes a lot longer than half a\nyear and when you look at\nthe uh characteristics of really\nsuccessful deadlifters they're not Young\nmen and\nwomen they are people who've trained\ntheir body over many years to get that\ndensity of bone because that that really\nis the weakest link uh in a deadlift as\nfar as uh back injury goes so there's\nsomething to consider first of all\num let's go back to the back pained\nperson now and there are some people who\ndo not perform an assessment and they\nsay oh if you've got back pain the\nsymptom of back pain pain do deadlifts\nwell well hold on a\nsecond one of the first things we do\nafter we've assessed them is to try and\nget rid of the cause that almost always\ninvolves teaching them how to bend at\nthe hips and not stressing and creating\nconcentrations in the spine it's called\na hip\nhinge uh then we may put a load in their\nhands and then we have to assess their\nhips to determine whether the hips have\nshallow sockets or deep sockets in other\nwords what's the hip range of motion\nthat will allow you to pick a bar off\nthe ground there are many people who\nshouldn't be picking heavy bars off the\nground uh when you look at the size of\nan Olympic I call them cookies but a a\n45lb plate I suppose uh that was\narbitrarily chosen in fact it was\nactually chosen that if someone dropped\nthe bar uh on the ground your head could\nfit between the bar and the ground that\nwas where that original size of the came\nfrom is my understanding of it people\nlifting alone quite often is that why oh\nyeah well there's lots of YouTubes of\nthose injuries but anyway yeah that's uh\nthat's something that I both encourage\nand discourage people from searching for\nbecause it can scare you appropriately\nbut it's also can be traumatizing to see\nright so now we've put together the idea\nof uh what Anatomy do they have in the\nhips and where's the Tipping Point in\npicking something off the ground\nwe may start to progress the uh hip\nhinge into a loaded situation if the\nperson doesn't have compressive load\ntriggers to their back pain pattern uh I\ndoubt we'll be pulling a bar off the\nground though we will Elevate the bar\nand put it on blocks so if you come to\nbackfit Pro and you look at our our uh\nrack that has uh 1300 lb there available\nto lift if you wish they pull off pins\nin other words we're we're were matching\nthe height of the pole to their\nbiomechanical Optimum uh in the\nbeginning and then we have to\ndecide is the deadlift the best tool to\nget them to their goal you know I I did\nthe podcast with uh Peter AA and Peter\nhad a uh a little section on the\ndeadlift and he asked me the same\nquestion but he just told me his\npersonal story of conflict and whether\nhe should be deadlifting you know he's\nhad a couple of spine surgeries as a\nyounger man when you know none of us\nknew better in those days I suppose and\nmy answer was to him and a lot of people\ntook it and I we got a lot of blowback\non this that it was a generic answer for\ndeadlifts and it wasn't it was an answer\nfor him where I started to talk about\nwell maybe for yourself why don't we\nwalk backwards up a hill in a monster\nwalk style and you will feel the quads\nburning how many squats and deadlifts do\nyou really need to do and then neurology\ncomes into this you walk backwards up a\nhill say it's about 50 yards your quads\nare burning then walk down to the bottom\nof the hill and walk forwards up the\nhill the brain says I'm perceiving\nexhausted quads let's go get the next in\nthe hierarchy your glutes it's a\nfabulous stimulator to glutes so there\nyou go I've just found a better tool for\na person who has limited\ncapacity deadlift was not the way to go\nthey're going to walk backwards up hill\nand then they're going to walk forward\nand really uh feel tremendous exhaustion\nif that's how they get their jolies and\nif that's what we need in the\nathleticism to keep them going and\nbuilding robustness what are your\nthoughts on um glute ham raises I'm a\nbig fan of Nordic curls and glute ham\nraises for the posterior chain to me a\nglute ham raise folks can look it up is\nbasically a deadlift into a leg curl\ninto a hamstring leg curl except that\nyour feet are um instead of uh being on\nthe floor for the deadlift part you've\nrotated yourself uh 90° um so that the\nfeet are effectively at the wall right\nthat and from the bottom position up to\nthe parallel to Floor position that's\nmore or less a dead deadlift right\nstiff-legged or partially stiff legged\ndeadlift and then the rest of the way is\nthe Nordic curl or the leg curl to me\nthat seems like almost the perfect\nexercise for the posterior chain\nhamstrings and glutes which is why I do\nthem regularly what are your thoughts\nabout them for back strengthening and\nfor people that are trying to avoid back\npain both in the present and in the\nfuture it's exactly the same answer that\nI gave you for deadlifts a it depends\nand B is it the best tool to reach the\ngoal that is an auxiliary exercise it's\nnot a deadlift it's just challenging a\npart of the chain involved in the full\nchain that's required for a\ndeadlift if I go back to some of the\ncriticism after that original uh\ndeadlift statement there was a lot of\nolder fellas who were who were saying\nyou know I love the deadlift when I stop\ndeadlifting my back pain actually\nincreases and uh deadlifting keeps the\nbogey man away I get it okay that was\nthe right tool for them but I can tell\nyou about the characteristic of those\npeople they will be somewhat\nunidimensional in their athleticism I\nwill bet you dollars to Donuts actually\nDonuts are getting more expensive now so\nthat that's that's a poor analogy that\nworked when I was a kid but anyway ask\nthem to throw a football ask them to\nswing a golf club I'll bet you the ones\nwho say deadlifts are good for their\nback pain won't do well in either of\nthose activities so it's a it's a very\nunidimensional because they can't\ngenerate that kind of twist and snap\nwith the uh with the throwing a football\nfor instance like the the stiffening up\nof the body\nprecisely the right moment and the\nrelaxing of the the arm the flicking and\nand spiral a deadlift is not a pulsing\nstrength it's a grinding strength and\nagain if you want\nneurology to adapt to\ncreate you know when again I know people\ndon't like when I do this but when I I I\nlove uh athletic examples and I learn so\nmuch because it's like a car mechanic\nworking on a\nMcLaren uh and then a dump truck which\nwhich carries heavy load and then a Baja\neraser which is incredibly endurable\nbecause it shows you in terms of\nengineering and automotive technology\nwhat is possible so when you work with a\ngreat athlete you learn what is humanly\npossible so something like a deadlift it\nteaches the nerves to carry electricity\nwhen you measure a very good deadlift it\nis an\nexhausting but think of it what is\nstrength strength starts with this\nthought and now you have to densify that\nthought then you have to densify the\npulse train down through the nerves and\nyou've got to teach the nerves to carry\nthat amount of electrical pulse and\nyou've got to teach the muscles to\nutilize it so in terms of grinding\nstrength capacity a deadlift is pretty\ngood but does that have to do with most\npeople uh with back\npain a few years ago the professional\ngolf\nCommunity LED by a few personalities got\ninto heavier lifting now this was rather\nodd if you go back to the old days of\nJack Nicholas and Gary Player and Arnold\nPalmer do you think they lifted heavy\nweights and I think Arnold Palmer is\nstill playing I mean some of those guys\nback when were were known for having a\nfew alcohol sure drinks plus smoking\ncigarettes on yeah uh on the course but\nbut but my point is the more you\ndeadlift the less you will be able to\nthrow a football and play golf so if\nyour goal in life is to be generally\nable to enjoy a a a really diverse array\nof\nactivities be careful on the tools that\nyou\nchoose uh so going back to the the the\nthe pro golfers of say uh 15 years ago\nwhen a few of them got into Olympic\nlifting which is heavy hip mobility down\nto the Deep squat for the snatch and\ntremendous uh shoulder\nMobility uh and deadlifts not one of\nthem to my knowledge and I know some of\nthem intimately well hit the ball\nfurther but they ended up with sore\nknees and disc\nbulges essentially really heavily\ncompromising their careers and then a\nfew of them and I've worked with quite a\nnumber of them have now backed off that\nheavy lifting and they have less pain\nfar more resilience and I think they're\ngoing to be playing a lot longer for it\nso I know that's going to create uh some\ncontroversy but so be it well that's\nokay I mean I I've gone on record saying\nthat I'll do and and genuinely do heavy\nhack squats hack machine squats leg\nextensions those kinds of things\nAlternatives that for me have just led\nto you know progressively more of what\nI'm looking for when training legs um\nand and back of course lower back and I\ndo the glute ham raises and I can do all\nof those without pain um I don't know\nthe last time I ever did a deadlift I I\nwas never particularly strong in the\ndeadlift but if you're telling me that\navoiding deadlifts as I get older heavy\ndeadlifts that is is going to help me\navoid back and hip pain then you know\nI'm I'm all for avoiding heavy deadlift\nif you want first of all I don't put you\nin the category of high risk for\nosteoporosis which is mineral loss from\nyour bones through\ngenetics and uh way under the Tipping\nPoint in terms of load stimulation so\nI'm not worried about that for you so if\nI was that would justify a he heavier\nloading regimen for now but as\nAlternatives uh a rear leg elevated\nsplit squat you can do it just with body\nweight or consider this interlace your\nfingers put them behind your head become\na peacock lift your your your chest up\nnow do the split leg rear elevated uh\nsquats like lunge squats and and you're\npotentiating the erector spiny and the\nwhole stabilizing me mechanism by\npushing up and resisting do you see how\nI flare do I need to flare my elbows\nback uh you can do yeah okay now do you\nsee how that just stimulated your whole\nupper body and the more you push and\ntraps everything light up right you just\nlit up your whole erector spine a we did\nall of that without a heavy\nbar you could do a goblet squat hold it\nin front now the whole body takes a more\nupright attitude uh it's more knee load\nif you want more knee load and less back\nand hip load or you know a back squat\nyou add more hip and low backload and\nyou take some off the knees so you can\nband the knees we can really play jazz\non this to optimize the best variant to\nget optimal reward with with minimal\nrisk and that will change as you recover\nfrom the back injury it will change with\nage it will uh change with other\ncoorilos would be uh another example now\nyou've added a balance challenge as you\nget older your risk will not be\nmitigated by deadlifts because the\nbiggest risk as you get older is\nfalling that will really change your\nlife as it does in many people do you\nhave the agility and neural dexterity\nthat when you stumble can you get your\nfoot out ahead of the center of mass\nwhich is now ahead of the base of\nsupport so you're going to fall you got\nto get that quick so it's hip power\nquick restr the\nfall and really mitigate against\ncatastrophe which is that fall so do you\nsee how that changed but can I just\nfinish off with one thing and I want to\ntalk about deadlifts and capacity as\nwell and again it's it's a lesson that\nwe learn from Elite\nathletes when we have an athlete whose\ngoal it is to set a world record be it\nin deadlifting or squatting or whatever\nthey can't train maximum deadlifts and\nsquats two or three times a\nweek it is just to exhausting and the\nrecovery period required between\ntraining sessions becomes so long they\nactually lose the peak off the training\nprogress so we do it through auxiliary\nexercise so when I think of someone like\nBrian Carroll you know again this is all\nsort of content validity types of\narguments I get it but until someone\nproduces a few more winners I I'm I'm\ngoing to stick with the the way our\nscience has shown to\ngo if you train and really push you know\nyou're talking about training at 85%\nwell are you going to set the world\nrecord if you only train at 85% probably\nnot but if you go to 100% youve got to\ntake a couple of weeks\noff so instead you do some auxiliaries\nlike Brian used heavily the belt squat\nmachine which you can really train\nhips legs Etc tremendous power but it\ndoesn't take or exhaust the whole upper\nbody and back system where you're not\nloading the spine or compressing the\nspine that's right because it it you\njust can't do it so if do you see why\nyou know it's very difficult for me\nwithout knowing the person knowing what\nthe goals are knowing what their future\nrisks are is it a bone mineral density\nissue or is it their knees are getting a\nbit cranky now or whatever the I I have\nto choose the most efficient uh\ntools occasionally it's a deadlift but I\nalso told you that right now there's too\nmany young people influenced by social\nmedia who are trying to set oh I'm going\nto set personal the best in deadlift not\nreally knowing how to densify the neural\nDrive take out all the slack so when\nthey grip the bar the final squeeze of\nthe bar actually gets the the the bar\nmoving they're breaking it from the\nfloor with they're so stiff throughout\ntheir body and they don't know this\nyet um and they they end up with a a\nback injury and and those are\nlonglasting they're hard to recover from\nyou talked about the so-called biblical\ntraining week I love this uh it's\nsomething that I plan to adopt for\nmyself it's not too far off from what I\ndo now but it's distinctly different\nenough that I'm excited because it's\ngoing to require some psychological\nadaptation physical adaptation tell me\nwhat is the biblical training week and\nwhy is it so\nuseful it is the underlying philosophy\nof how I train now it wouldn't have\nappealed to me when I was in my 20s and\n30s in those days it was all about uh\nstrength power looking good impressive\nEtc but you know my joints aren't what\nthey used to\nbe uh my training has evolved with my\nage so the name training uh biblical\ntraining week came from the idea that\nevery major religion has a Sabbath day a\nday off and I I when I was a kid and\nworking with my dad you you didn't do\nany work on Sunday and that was his day\nof allowing all the cumulative work\nduring the week to adapt and settle out\nso it's a very wise thing to\ndo there's six days to\ntrain in its basic form two days a week\nI Strength\ntrain two days a week I work on the\nthings that are a bit sticky and not\nmoving moving very well because I'm\ngetting older and I have a few\ninjuries so those are the mobility days\ntwo days a week I work on my ticker\ncardiovascular system things to\nchallenge uh my heart Etc there's more\ncaveats to all of this so I live in a\nrural setting most of the\ntime uh we heat\nour cabin I live in most most of the\ndays the week by wood so I have to split\nfirewood if I split firewood I've\nchecked all the boxes it's\ncardiovascular training it's Mobility\ntraining and it's strength training so\nit's also a lot of power so I've done my\ntraining for that particular day but I\nwouldn't split wood two days in a row I\nwouldn't strength train two days in a\nrow I wouldn't Mobility train two days\nin a row so that's another caveat don't\ndo the same thing two days in a row and\nallow this soreness to really develop\ninto into\nsomething another thing that suits me\nwell is routine I try and go to bed at\nthe same time get up at the same\ntime so th th those are the basic\ntenants of the uh biblical training week\nthe components of each you know I've\nI've had some neck trauma some shoulder\ntrauma I broke my hip I'm hip\nreplaced uh these are the things that I\nfocus on for strategic uh\nMobility uh the strength training\nis a little bit of bodybuilding a little\nbit of strengthen patternings so uh\npatterns of a squat a lift a lunge a\npush a pull uh Etc so I don't run\nbecause of my hips but in the summertime\nI will swim\nkayak uh canoe but I'll I'll put a bit\nof beef into it a bit of effort I ride\nmy bike uh in the winter I cross country\nski uh shovel snow is a big part where I\nlive um\nEtc so those are the uh oh by the way I\ndo do the big three six days out of\nseven and I didn't really discuss that\nof why they're essential we didn't\ninvent those exercises but we measured\nwe were one of the few groups in the\nworld to actually measured spine\nstability in a quantitative way doing\nthe big three was the most efficient way\nto guarantee spine stability but spare\nthe spine while you're doing it well\nsome people will say well why are you\nsparing your spine it's allows me to\nhave capacity The Limited capacity to do\nother things so why why would I waste\nthem all on core\ntraining the other thing is we live in a\nlinkage so the spine is a flexible Rod\nthere's no coincidence that either end\nof your core is a ball and socket joint\nthe shoulder and the hips if I wanted to\nput P you or an object a heavy door\nperhaps at the University or at a\nshopping mall say I could bench press\n300 lb well I can't anymore but say I\ncould the bench press muscle is the PEC\nmajor let's look at the architecture of\nthe PEC major the PEC major crosses the\nshoulder joint distal to the shoulder\njoint to where it connects on the upper\narm bone the humorous the muscle\ncontracts and creates the desired push\nbut proximal it connects to my rib cage\nlook what it does it collapses my torso\ninto my shoulder which is an energy leak\nthat is anti- push but if I can use core\ncontrol and core stiffness and lock down\nproximately 100% of that muscle activity\nnow goes distally to the athleticism so\nyou may have heard the expression a\nstronger core makes you stronger\nthroughout your body well how does that\nwork I've just explained to you that\nwhen you create proximal control and\nstiffness it directs the athleticism\ndistally if you want to wiggle your\nfinger quickly you had to stiffen your\nwrist if you want to wiggle your arm\nquickly you had to stiffen your upper\narm Etc so the mother of all proximal\nstability is your core in exactly the\nsame way a heavy equipment operator\nusing a backo the first thing they do is\nthey put down the stabilizers which are\nposts that go into the ground and lift\nthe tires off the ground to stabilize\nthe tractor so that now the arm can be\nthe athlete pulling Earth failure to\nstabilize you're just pulling the\ntractor around so core stability is\nessential for ability and\nperformance\nit's arresting all little micro\nmovements I'm we're all shrinking you\nyou will notice this probably over the\nnext decade the dis heite is now shrink\nIng and there's going to be a little bit\nmore micro movement in the discs is\nthere anything that can be done to\noffset the shrinking not that I know of\nhey people will ask with an hanging or\nuh anti-gravity boots that oh well I've\nmeasured that yes it uh will it will\nincrease disc heite for 15\nminutes and then gravity and the\nhydrostatic\npressures will cause the fluid flow and\nthe fluid flow there's a little bit\nthrough\nuh laterally through the disc but most\nof it comes through the end plates so\nfrom the vertebral body into the nucleus\nof the disc and you can draw fluid in\nunder tension but the hydrostatic\npressure overrides the osmotic pressure\nin gravity and then the discs lose all\nthe fluid so it's a\n15minute uh effect I feel like every\ntissue in the body has been the uh\nTarget of an attempt to either restore\nits more youthful State um or somehow\naugment its um I don't know resilience\nover time so these days we hear a lot\nabout FDA approved treatments using\nso-called platelet rich plasma PRP\ninjected into the knee or PRP injected\ninto an ovary or PRP injected into\nwhatever tissue it is that people are\nattempting to restore uh youthful state\nto is there any evidence for any\ncompounds or injectable um drugs that\ncan restore the um tensile a strength\nand thickness to the discs I haven't\nseen any evidence of PRP doing so now I\ndidn't condemn PRP throughout the body I\nswear by it for uh stubborn muscle tears\ninteresting in in one example uh ball\nand socket articular joints uh they it\nthere's no\nquestion not all the time but uh it it\ncan make a a measurable difference but\nnot injected into the dis so uh I I just\nneed to give a little bit of a context\nto this now if we take someone's dis\nwho's never been\ntraumatized so they're a young person uh\nthey can expose their spine to Mobility\nbe it yoga or ballet or whatever and\nthey will probably increase the range of\nmotion and Mobility they can strength\nTrin and toughen the collagen in the Imp\nplate and build some bone and in other\nwords they can do both Andrew they can\nincrease the the the con constituent\nstrength of the various parts and they\ncan create Mobility but once you have an\ninjury to the disc and you lose a little\nbit of dis height the world changes it's\nnot so easy to adapt those full range of\nathletic abilities anymore so now you're\nforced to make a\ncompromise most people we can get them\nto do one or the other they can maintain\nMobility to play golf after a disc\ninjury or they want to pop up on a\nsurfboard that's their thing in life\nthey just want to be able to Surf I'll\nsay good we\ncan manage it's no longer adapting we\ncan manage you to to achieve that but\nyou're going to have to back off the\ndead lifts and uh some of the strength\nexposures because they will just further\ncompromise the dis heite of a damaged\ndisc and we can do the opposite if you\nwant to strength train and bear a load\nyou're going to have to give up the\nmobility so that game that Dance with\nthe Devil that comes after the after the\nback injury so I think the question was\na little bit about\nadaptation uh if you haven't experienced\ndis damage yet you have a lot more\nleeway to adapt your spine after that it\nbecomes a game of management and\nencouraging uh an athletic ability you\nbecome a little bit more uni-dimensional\nand if you want a little bit of\neverything okay but you have to be very\nmodest you just have to try and Achieve\nsufficient Mobility sufficient strength\nto do whatever to just to get through\nlife and it's and it's a bit of a dance\nso I don't know if that gives a bit of a\ncontext that's perfect yeah uh could you\nwalk us through your biblical week\ntraining with some examples of what one\ncould select from the buffet of training\noptions right um okay I I can so Le let\nlet's say to today I'm going into our\nClinic gym and I will start with uh\ndoing the big three so I will do uh bird\ndogs and I'm going to work on good form\nand then I'm going to put some d nism\ninto it uh I don't lift the leg so much\nI push the heel away and it really\ncauses you to lock the core to create\nthe proximal stability and then pushing\nthe heel Away really engages the glutes\nand hamstrings then I draw small squares\nI Square out with the hand and foot down\ntowards the midline and up so now I'm\ncreating a little bit of a\ndisassociation through the ball and\nsocket joints with I want which is what\nI want with the core\nor control so that is\ntranslatable we did an experiment with\nthe Pensacola fire department by the way\nwhere those firefighters who were\ntrained with a coach who explained why\nthey were insisting on certain exercise\nforms we measured them doing fire ground\ntasks before the training sessions in\nother words we measured them uh putting\nup a fire ladder advancing a loaded fire\nhose which is a tremendous reactive push\nas you know uh piking open an elevator\ndoor chopping a hole in a burning Roof\nthen half the group trained with this\nattention to exercise form and we\nexplained the principles to them and\nthen the other uh half of the\nfirefighters had trainers who were more\nlike\ncheerleaders trying to get them to do\nmore reps and encouraging them both\ngroups got fit and then we measured them\nall again out of on the fire ground\nremember now we never trained them how\nto do the fire ground tasks they went\nback to the fire ground those who\ntrained with the cheerleader types of oh\njust do more reps had more known injury\nmarkers do you know valgal collapse of\nthe knee is a very strong predictor of\nfuture risk of ACL injury being one of\nthem so there would be an example of\nthat\num sagittal plain spine motion under\nload I mean every study that surveils\ngroups who have to bend down through\ntheir spine and pick up more load has a\nmuch higher incidence a bill maris's\nstudy showed 10 times the risk factor to\nhaving a dis injury U if if if you do\nthat\nso uh I will then do side planks rolling\nside planks uh I will do a variety of uh\nabdominal exercises the modified\nabdominal curl that you're familiar with\nand I'll do some uh glute uh Bridges MH\nthen I'll do them one-legged and I'll\nget the arm involved and\ncrossbody um I may put a kettle bell on\nmy belly and do some hip thrusts uh that\nway but a very mindful way I'm focused\nmy brain on squeezing the glutes uh\npushing the feet away uh\nEtc then I will probably stand up and do\nthe strength patterns so I'll go over\nand do uh pushes now uh consider a\npush-up which rather than me load heavy\nwith with a with a bench press or\nsomething like that I'll do push-ups you\nknow the Clapping push-up where you\ndynamically explode up clap and go down\nI'll do a variety of those very Dynamic\npower generating pushes then I'll do\nsome\npulls uh I probably won't do a row with\na barbell but I'll do an inverted row\npulling on a TRX pronated grip pulling\ninto him grip power breathing and\nexploding really trying to get some\npower into\nit uh then I will go to um probably a\nsplit lunge rear elevated foot uh squat\nlunge squat with the techniques that I\nshowed you hands interlaced behind my\nhead peacocking high pushing back\npulling forward and now doing the the\nlunge squat so that's that's challenging\nmy balance uh the whole extensor chain\nuh strength uh Etc I might do some\nbilateral squats uh with my hips uh I've\nbroken my ankle I do heel elevated\nsquats usually with a banded knee and\nsometimes I just use my brain and try\nand spread the floor then I get into the\nauxillaries so I broke C4 um I have to\nuh yeah not not a good thing playing\nfootball\nuh hockey hockey head down into the\nboards classic anyway um I uh can't\nreally do shearing exercises where I\npush against resistance that will get my\nneck a bit cranky so I take out the\nshear I get tall I push my tongue hard\nto the roof of the mouth and I Grimace\nso now I've activated all the flexors\nand I put my hands underneath and I just\npush up\nisometrically and I control so there's\nno Shear anymore but I've really started\nto build the flexer uh family keep your\nneck strong it's important for me yep\nnow put your your chin poking retract\nnow push up you got it that's it push\nyour tongue yeah don't go crazy and add\nadd a little bit of endurance to that I\nappreciate the neck work that you do\nthough which I have a four-way neck\nmachine but I don't require one I've\nactually found that taking a plate lying\non and wrapping in a towel lying on one\nside making sure to hook my foot under\nthe wrench and stabilize with my other\nhand on the ground and then just gently\ndoing repetitions Jeff Cavalier from\nathl Nex has a great set of videos on\nthis where he really spells out the\ndangers of things like neck Bridges they\ncan be done but there's a risk there um\nthat probably outweighs the potential\nbenefits for most people right but every\nonce in a while I can't help myself and\nI do some bridges y i cuz I really enjoy\nthem if you're ler at University of Iowa\nyou're doing bridg for a good while\nyou're probably okay doing neck ridges\nyeah I get teased for saying this too\noften but the the value of having a\nstrong neck is just um hard to overstate\nyou don't have to have a big neck but a\nstrong neck for the sake of stabilizing\nthe whole shoulder G girdle excuse me\nduring um pressing and pulling lifts uh\nfor posture um for you know feeling like\nyour head is stably placed on your body\nthink of every pulling motion where does\nit start the\ntrapezius originates off the neck stack\nthat flag pole and really get those\nmuscles ready to\npull it it requires a a stiff strong\nneck absolutely so every strong puller\nyeah my Bulldog was alive um he had the\nlarger neck in the house um but it's\nagain it's not about um building size\ninto the neck it's really that strength\nand stability right that I just think\ntranslates to so many things that are\nvaluable anyway I'll finish out my\nstrength routine with some more\nauxiliaries uh people laugh at this I\ncall it sword play the amount of\nathletic gain that we've achieved with\nsword play I take an iron bar like a uh\nyou know the old uh weer dumbbell weight\nit'll be an iron bar about that long and\nI'll put maybe a two pound weight on the\nend and then I grab it and I do figure\neights over here over here over here\naround\nthere you wouldn't believe I have\nprofessional hockey players in the NHL\nwho say wow those figure eight sword\nplays my wrist shot my Slap Shot have\ntwo are tennis players I've never had\nsuch power and finesse off the racket\nbecause of that Sword Play exercise yeah\nthis is interesting um I love older\nexercise books and recently I came\nacross one called heavy hands this must\nbe from the 70s yeah and the the entire\nbook was centered around people being\nencouraged to carry some dumbbells\nduring exercise not all the time and\ndoing some lunges or walking uphill and\ngetting the weights out from their body\nand um and I was kind of chuckling about\nit on the one hand pun intended but at\nthe same time you know we know based on\na number of really good studies using\nneuroimaging and functional scoring of\nneural system function as one ages that\nthe ination of some of the distal\nmuscles and the fine control of the the\ndigits you know fingers and toes and\nfoot uh foot uh toe spreading and things\nlike that um even calf size and atrophy\num are Fairly reliable markers of the\nextent to which there's been\ndegeneration of the upper motor neuron\nPathways um other brain areas or not so\nthe idea of keeping the nervous system\nand\nneuromuscular connectivity\nyouthful by quote unquote heavy hands or\nmaybe ankle weights provided they're not\ngoing to induce injury makes a lot of\nsense waiting the most distal portion of\nour body um in order to generate\nadaptations I think is going to be\nsomething that returns to the uh kind of\nmodern uh sphere of of fitness and\nLongevity may I give you a couple of\ncomments please that was fabulous it's\nso much fun when I see someone getting\nout of their car and and walking up to\nthe clinic door and I can see the muscle\nwasting on their calf and they'll say oh\nI have to get out my\nEMG uh nerve conduction velocity scores\nhere I said are you kidding me you\ntelling me the doc needed to do an EMG\nconduction velocity and all they had to\ndo was look at your leg we know exactly\nthe nerve roots that are deficit because\nI know exactly what serves those muscles\nthat have wasted I\nmean it's it's crazy how technology has\nmade so many people oblivious to the\nsigns that we all show that was my first\ncomment but the second one was going\nback to the oldtime books I collect a\nlot of those actually uh I have quite a\nlibrary of the old time strength books\nfrom some from the 1800s the old inch\nbook of strength and oh they're\nfabulous uh Indian clubs are you\nfamiliar with Indian clubs so it's a\nwooden club that looks like a bowling\npin basically but some of the old style\nIndian clubs were this long well there's\nuh a great manual strength athlete that\nnot too many people have heard of uh\nJohn Brookfield he lives in North\nCarolina Pinehurst North Carolina in\nPinehurst there's a sculpture a very\nheavy steel that johon bent with his\nbare hands to make this sculpture with\nand yeah he'll he'll take heavy rebar\nand bend it and you know put on strength\nshows with his hands he's fabulous fell\ntoo by the way\nI uh he's he's got a set of Indian clubs\nI can hardly pick one up but he just\npicks up this Indian club and it was\nfrom some famous guy from the 1800s and\nsomehow he got the the Indian clubs and\nthey're about this long but he can just\nget them\nand play sword play with very heavy\nIndian clubs there's actually uh a good\nfriend of mine he's an Australian fellow\nAndrew Lock I don't know if you've ever\nheard of Andrew Lock and Andrew has\ncollected kettle bells and Indian clubs\nfrom the oldtimers he's got quite a a\nlovely collection in Melbourne where\nwhere he's from in\nAustralia but uh they're wonderful\nexercises and none of these things\nrequire fancy equipment one could\nimagine just grabbing a hold of some\neither well an iron bar an iron\nbar yeah I really think there's\nsomething to this loading of the distal\nlimbs um cautiously right properly but\nthere's something there in terms of\nkeeping the neural Pathways healthy and\nAlive because we know they atrophy with\nage and that explains in part the the\ncalf muscle atrophy which as you point\nout is a well-known clinical marker for\nneurod degeneration yeah um well simply\nthings and you can certainly comment\nabout this I try and do things with my\nopposite hand so today I'm just going to\nbrush my teeth comb my hair with my\nopposite hand now don't ask me to throw\na a ball because I'm a but you\nknow if I'm splitting firewood okay it's\n10 reps this way 10 reps that\nway uh and that that's all in an attempt\nto keep my brain as uh movement\ncompetent and dextrous as possible well\ncertainly when I resistance train if I'm\ndoing anything standing I make it a\npoint to um stagger my stance yes um and\nat the same time to make sure that my\nbelly button is pointing forward so that\nI generate some\nanti-rotation um effort uh so that most\nof my abdominal work can be um placed\nwithin the workout for other things I do\nsome Pikes and some direct abdominal\nwork as well in the roll up and and\nthings of that sort that you've\nrecommended but I find that um from a\ncoordination standpoint and especially\nfrom a balancing the musculature and the\nstrength on both sides of the body this\nis extremely important and I know this\nbecause after years of skateboarding\nwhere you push with one leg that was\nwhen I was younger um boxing I'm\ntraditional stance as opposed to\nSouthpaw you know you start getting into\nall these imbalances um that and it goes\nWay Beyond anything aesthetic I mean the\naesthetic stuff is might concern certain\npeople but it was more the feeling that\nI could turn to my right very easily\nwithout pain turning my left I felt\nstiff and it was just a imbalance in um\nsome of the muscles controlling uh anti-\nrotation so I think that weaving\nasymmetric stance weaving um the\nrequirement for symmetric balancing of\nthe musculature on both sides of the\nmidline just makes you know all the\nsense in the world to me uh especially\nif one is going to be a regular\nexerciser which hopefully people are\nwell if I can convince you to uh\nconsider the biblical training week all\nof that fits into your Mobility days\nyeah let's talk about those because you\ntalked about the strength days what\nabout the two days of Mobility well G\ngiven my history I do thoracic spine\nextension MH I do a little bit of neck\nwork uh hip mobility but again I have a\na certain capacity there that I can't uh\noverdrive and then uh once I've done the\ntargeted ones I just go through the\nmotion of of every joint and uh don't\nadd load and then I will do uh the\nfootwork so with my background I'll do a\nlittle bit of Shadow Boxing I'll play uh\nuh traditional\nSouthpaw um Etc if you could just repeat\nthe cardiovascular days since in depend\non the time of year of I I I really like\nto be outside so if it's winter time and\nuh I for some reason couldn't go for a\nCrossCountry ski that day or whatnot I\nwill ride a stationary bike in in the\nclinic I'd prefer not to but I will uh\nif it's summertime I'm riding\noutside and\nuh uh I could uh kayak swim\ncanoe um just go to the Hills and walk\nwith Tico my dog hard and that might be\nmy cardiovascular uh that day and uh\ngoing back to the genetics which is how\nwe started this uh uh\npodcast uh have you ever had your\nathletic panel done from a genetic base\nin other words they look at your genes\nand determine what you're genetically\ngood at and what you're genetically\nhorrible at do you know that I mean I\nknow a few things that I'm horrible at\nbut you haven't had it tested\ngenetically no okay I have and they gave\nme a panel of 10\nathleticism now interestingly enough if\nI didn't have my athletic panel and you\njust asked me to check am I good at this\nor am I bad at it and check somewhere in\nbetween I would have got every single\none 100% right interesting yeah so I\nknow my abilities and it aligns 100% and\nother words I'm ultra which is the\nhighest for grip strength I always knew\nthat you know they're a pair of hands\nbut if I got my hands on you in football\nyou weren't getting you know what I mean\nI I've always had a very good grip\nstrength so genetically that came\nthrough was Ultra and the other thing I\nwas Ultra at was I can be quick for the\nfirst 35 milliseconds boom if you want\nsomething done like that I I can usually\npop it you\nknow when I was playing hockey uh you\ntypically it's a\n45502 Anor robic blast and you sit down\nfor 3 minutes there's two more shifts\nand then the coach Taps you on the\nhelmet and I'm still breathing heavily\nand my two line mates they're they're\nready to go again I was terrible at\nrecovering from an from an athletic\nanerobic blast guess what I'm the worst\npossible genetic category for Recovery\nof uh uh heart rate and I you know i' i'\nI've worked with some of the best heart\nrate\nrecovery uh people and I'm hopeless at\nit I have a feeling I'm naturally\ninclined to do endurance work because\nonce I start running distance I can just\nrun and run and then eventually it just\nfeels like the um the stopping comes\nfrom you know I don't know some nagging\nlittle injury or something like that or\npain as opposed to anything stopping me\nfrom continuing to run which is\nunfortunate because I tend to like the\nthe shorter workout type stuff right it\nbrings us back to what we were talking\nabout earlier uh try and do a balance of\nof those um and everything in between I\nlove the biblical training week and\ngiven that currently I've been doing\nthree days of resistance training total\nper week and three days of\ncardiovascular training all it requires\nis Shifting one each of those days\ntoward Mobility training still taking\nthe full day off each week make sure you\ntake that day off you will\nbe less painful with your joints I\npredict when you're going into your 60s\nand 70s and knock on wood having a blast\nwhen you're 80 that's the plan and I've\ncertainly had a blast today Dr McGill\nthis has been amazing I mean you've\ngiven us such a wealth of knowledge\nabout the back it's Anatomy neurology\nthe sources of pain for those that have\nback pain Avenues to relieve back pain\navenues for people to Stave off back\npain including the big three but not\nlimited to the big three you also gave\nus a wonderful window into the Precision\nwith which you approach assessment and\nduring the introduction and also in the\nshow note captions um I mention and link\nto the many clinicians that you've\ntrained all over the world so that if\npeople want to try and access um direct\ncoaching and Rehabilitation they can do\nthat I also really appreciate the books\nyou've written and we linked to that as\nwell um back mechanic and I really just\nappreciate your Devotion to public\neducation through your own channels\nthrough your students the many many many\nmany peer-reviewed papers that you've\npublished I mean I can't overemphasize\nthis enough you have a you know vast\nnumber of highquality peer-reviewed\nPublications in these areas and um it's\njust wonderful to sit across from\nsomebody who's devoted their\nprofessional life to this really\nimportant area that so many people\nconfront whether or not they be athletes\nor conventional exercisers or just\npeople who are experiencing some pain or\nwant to get in shape or all of the above\nso on behalf of myself and everyone\nlistening and watching watching I just\nwant to extend a really deep heartfelt\nand genuine thank you thank you so much\nwell thank you Professor\nhuberman I you know you know this but\nI'm going to mention this for the\nlisteners you have done a great deed in\nchanging the behavior of many\npeople myself included and my\nfamily uh it's it's not the easiest\nthing to do because there's always the\ncritics but you uh have done a\ntremendous service and uh I thank you\nfor that as well and I thank you\npersonally because uh you've improved my\nlife and hopefully I'll have a few more\nyears to enjoy it but thank you well\nthank you for those words it's a labor\nof love for me and that's extremely\ngratifying to hear and um God willing\nI'll be in your kind of shape at your\nage let's do this again again I would\nlove it thanks thank you for joining me\nfor today's discussion with Dr Stuart\nMcGill to learn more about his work as\nwell as to find a link to his excellent\nbook back
