    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine recently the hubman Lab podcast\nhosted a live event at the Great Hall in\nBrisbane Australia the event was called\nthe brain body contract and featured a\nlecture followed by a question and\nanswer session with the audience we\nwanted to make the question and answer\nsession available to everyone regardless\nif you could attend I also would like to\nthank the sponsors for the event they\nare eight sleep and ag1 eight sleep\nmakes Smart mattress covers with cooling\nHeating and sleep tracking capacity now\nI've spoken many times before on this\npodcast about the fact that sleep is the\ncritical foundation for mental health\nphysical health and performance now one\nof the key things to getting the best\npossible night sleep is to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nand that's because in order to fall and\nstay deeply asleep your body temperature\nactually needs to drop by about 1 to 3°\nand in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and alert your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3° eight sleep mattress\ncovers make it extremely easy to control\nthe temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and thereby to control your\ncore body temperature so that you fall\nand stay deeply asleep and wake up\nfeeling your absolute best I've been\nsleeping on an eight Sleep mattress\ncover for about 3 years now and it has\ncompletely transformed the quality of my\nsleep for the better eights sleep\nrecently launched their newest\ngeneration of pod cover the Pod 4 ultra\nthe Pod 4 cover has improved cooling and\nheating capacity higher Fidelity sleep\ntracking technology and the Pod 4 cover\nhas snoring detection that will\nautomatically lift your head a few\ndegrees to improve air flow and stop\nyour snoring if you'd like to try an\neights Sleep mattress cover you can go\nto 8sleep.com\nhuberman to save $350 off their pod 4\nultra eight sleep currently ships to the\nUSA Canada UK select countries in the EU\nand Australia again that's eights\nsleep.com\nhuberman the other live event sponsor\nag1 is a vitamin mineral prob drink that\nalso contains adaptogens and other\ncritical micronutrients I've been taking\nag1 daily since 2012 so I'm delighted\nthat they decided to sponsor the live\nevent I started taking ag1 and I still\ntake ag1 once or twice a day because it\ngives me vitamins and minerals that I\nmight not be getting enough of from\nWhole Foods that I eat as well as\nadaptogens and micronutrients those\nadaptogens and micronutrients are really\ncritical because even though I strive to\neat most of my foods from unprocessed or\nminimally processed Whole Foods it's\noften hard to do so especially when I'm\ntraveling and especially when I'm busy\nso by drinking a packet of ag1 in the\nmorning and often times also again in\nthe afternoon or evening I'm ensuring\nthat I'm getting everything I need I'm\ncovering all of my foundational\nnutritional needs and I like so many\nother people that take ag1 regularly\njust report feeling better and that\nshouldn't be surprising because it\nsupports gut health and of course gut\nhealth supports immune system health and\nbrain health and it's supporting a ton\nof different cellular and organ\nprocesses that all interact with one\nanother so while certain supplements are\nreally directed towards one specific\noutcome like sleeping better or being\nmore alert ag1 really is foundational\nnutritional support it's really designed\nto support all of the systems of your\nbrain and body that relate to mental\nhealth and physical health if you'd like\nto try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim a special offer\nthey'll give you five free travel packs\nwith your order plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman and now for the live event at\nthe Great Hall in Brisbane\n[Music]\n[Applause]\n[Music]\nAustralia what are my thoughts on\nnicotine um nicotine causes cancer when\nit's consumed in the form of smoking\nvaping dipping or snuffing so don't do\nthat um there's a debate now about\nvaping is it bad is it good it's bad um\nis it is is it worse for you than\nsmoking probably not is it better\nprobably slightly um you know what's\nbetter just not doing it um but if you\nneed to do it and you have to pick you\nknow I suppose um you know I'm not going\nto tell you what to do but I think that\nvaping has allowed a good number of\npeople to smoke less I'll acknowledge\nthat um and it's also clear it's not\ngood for you so if you're going to going\nto do something that's bad for you do a\nbunch of things to offset the thing\nthat's bad for you that's always my\nadvice um but now in terms of nicotine\nitself nicotine doesn't cause cancer the\nmode of consumption causes cancer that's\nimportant\nnicotine um binds to so-called nicotinic\nacetycholine receptors so these exist\nnaturally in your body and on your\nmuscles they're the way that actually\nyour nerves control contraction of your\nmuscles um so the consumption of\nnicotine let's just say in um in I don't\nknow about down here but in Europe it's\nbecoming fairly common and in the Middle\nEast also for people that take little\npouches of nicotine can be absorbed um\nyou know sublingually or through the gum\ngets into the bloodstream and it is\ntruly a cognitive enhancer it's a\ncognitive enhancer not going to lie to\nyou it will raise attention focus\ncognitive performance this is\nwellestablished the problem is it also\nraises blood pressure and causes vasal\nconstriction this is well\nestablished so you know you have to ask\nyourself is it worth it do I do\nsometimes do I do it often do I choose\nto not do it at all I I don't think the\nyoung brain should be consuming nicotine\neven in these non-cancer uh causing uh\nforms like pouches um for a variety of\nreasons but mostly because the brain is\nso plastic at a young age anyway um but\nI actually am familiar with the use of\nnicotine for offsetting certain\nneurologic diseases when I was visiting\nColumbia Medical University in New York\nCity some years ago I was in the office\nof a no Prize winner um won't tell you\nuh who it was necessarily um and he\nproceeded to consume no fewer than six\npieces of Nicorette gum in our half hour\nmeeting I like whoa at the time he was\nin his late 70s he's now in his 80s and\nI was like Hey listen like what's the\ndeal with the nicotine and he said oh\nwell it offsets Parkinson and\nAlzheimer's I said really he said yeah\nyeah you can increase cognitive function\nI used to smoke but I don't want to get\ncancer so I just chew a lot and a lot of\nneck rat okay really he's like yeah yeah\nyeah la nicet you know it it it can\nincrease the amount of acetylcholine\nactivation Through The Binding of these\nnicotinic acetylcholine receptors might\neven maintain some um dopaminergic\nneurons which are the neurons that one\ntends to lose with age and uh is rampant\nin diseases like Parkinson's I thought\nwhoa okay so there's something there the\nfact of the matter is that nicotine can\nenhance focus alertness and learning but\nit does have those other issues so you\nwant to be considerate of those other\nother issues and not become dependent on\nit and my experience is that people who\ntaste the nicotine Focus From A Zin\npatch are those people who are buying\nthose things pretty regularly I know\nsomebody that went from one Zin patch\ntwice a week to a canister a morning in\nabout a month because the effect will\nwear off if you keep consuming it uh\nevery day um you have to consume more\nand more so take that into consideration\nprobably best to um avoid unless you\nneed really need the Boost and you can\nafford the increase in blood pressure\nthat would be my suggestion I've never\ntaken nicotine and I don't\nsmoke what's the best you can do for\nmanaging ADH if not taking medication\nokay so we did two episodes of The\nhubman L podcast on ADHD the first was\non behavioral nutritional and supplement\nbased tools 50% of the comments like\nthank you so much this is very helpful\num can't wait to try some of the stuff\nthe other will like get your evil um um\nyou are you're trying to persuade people\nto not take Pharmaceuticals which is not\ntrue I I I'm interested in all of it I\njust covered that stuff in the first\nepisode and then the second one we did\non H ADHD was about things like viance\nadderal rlin Etc most of which by the\nway are\namphetamines are we putting our kids on\nspeed yes yeah they're amphetamines but\nI don't think that we should walk away\nfrom those things in every case they do\nhave real clinical value in many cases\nand their clinical value comes from the\nfact that one not all but one of the\nmajor effects of amphetamines is that it\ncan increase dopaminergic and nergic\nmeaning dopamine and nephrine release in\nthe brain which can increase attention\nand focus which is actually beneficial\nin some cases for the brain to learn to\nfocus to get neuroplasticity of those\nvery circuits so it's a you know you\nknow consideration then 50% of the\ncomments of that second episode were why\ndon't you talk about the behavioral\ntools the suppl based tools and the\nnutrition tools and um and that everyone\nelse said thank you for talking about\nthe prescription drugs so the point\nbeing several fold one is that certainly\na combination of Behavioral nutritional\nsupplement based and prescription tools\nis viable for most every situation and\nit's worth thinking about all of those\nwhen considering a treatment for ADHD\nand think we really need to get out of\nthese silos of thinking you know like\nbig Pharma is evil listen there are\ndrugs that can help\npeople is it evil I don't know is it\ngoing away no okay is there value there\nsometimes is it overprescribed sometimes\nwhat about nutritional tools well in\nsome cases it can really help in other\ncases it one still needs prescription\ndrug Tools in some cases doing\nbehavioral nutritional or supplement\nbased tools can allow one to take lower\ndoses of pharmaceuticals if that's your\ngoal I think it really needs to be\ntailored to the individual what I would\nlike to see is more of a tailoring to\nthe individual than the simple write a\nscript send people off or tell people\nthat it's all bad if it comes out of a\nprescription uh drug label format now it\nis very clear that the original dosing\nschedule for things like Aderall viance\nEtc was during the week weekday but not\nthe weekends that somehow has moved to\nuh no weekends off so there's been a lot\nof changing in the the dosing schedules\num and the way these drugs are taken are\nwe creating a dependency on these drugs\nis always a big question and the answer\nseems to be a sort of very few people\nfor whom these drugs work decide to come\noff them there's nothing magical about\nturning 25 after which you don't need\nthese these enhancements but sometimes\npeople don't need them or need as much\nof them because the neural circuits can\nbe built up one thing that I would like\nto see more of is attention to the\nbehavioral tools for ADHD not the least\nof which is what's being carried out in\nmany schools and Clinics in China where\npeople are being encour children are\nbeing encouraged to teach themselves how\nto maintain visual focus on a Target\nsome distance away from them which then\nallows them to maintain cognitive focus\nwhen they move to their work the\nrelationship between visual Focus as\nwe've talked about a bunch of times\ntonight in the case of the cuddlefish\nETC and cognitive focus is a an intimate\none such that if you expect yourself to\nfocus you you can't really expect\nyourself to drop into Focus as an\nimmediate State you know so it's not a\nsquare wave function as you say you\ndon't just sit down and drop into a\nstate of Focus right we're so attracted\nto these Notions of of focus and we have\nthese Concepts like flow and by the way\nI'm I'm not disparaging of those\nConcepts I know stepen Cotler I have\nrespect for him and his books um about\nflow but from a neuros psychiatric\nneuros pychological\nstandpoint you know what we can really\nsay about flow is that backwards spells\nwolf we don't really know that much\nabout it um and so I think that if you\nexpect yourself to focus you need to\ngive yourself some warm-up time to focus\ndon't assume that you have attention\nissues if you sit down and it takes five\nor 10 minutes to drop into a state of\nfocus just like you wouldn't expect\nyourself to go out for a hard run\nwithout some sort of warm-up jog\nbeforehand so the behavioral tools such\nas focusing on a visual Target are\nunderexplored at least in most countries\nbut in and elsewhere they are being\nexplored pretty extensively so I would\nencourage a full exploration of all the\ntools in this case it says not taking\nmedication then obviously heavier\nReliance on the behavioral tools is\ngoing to be\nhelpful while I'm getting more sleep now\nI neglected sleep for many years me too\nand at least 15 years of getting just\nfive or so am I doomed or can I offset\nthis past damage you can offset the past\ndamage one of the things that's really\num wonderful about the brain and body is\nthat it can compensate you know there's\ncertain things that I get asked a lot I\ndon't know why I get this question a lot\nbut people say you know I smoked meth\nfor years and then um can I get my\nneurons back and I'm like well you know\nit's neurotoxic but the fact that you're\nasking the question is reassuring um you\nknow so don't start um but if you did\nyou know I mean you can always do better\nthan you're doing and you certainly can\ndo better than you did in your past or\nat least that's what they tell me um um\nso really when it comes to sleep\ndeprivation you know I spent many all\nnighters um I I wouldn't talk about\nsleep so much if I didn't have\nchallenges with sleep I mean for a long\ntime I slept like a bulldog I would\nsleep anywhere any time by the way folks\nif you ever walk down the street and you\nsee a bulldog and you stop you'll notice\nthey always stop they always seem so\nfriend they always stop they always stop\nand they look up at you and you pet them\nand like the reason they seem to like\nyou so much is because they love to\nstop I owned one they're all about the\nstopping it's all it's not you it's\nabout the\nstopping anyway\nthe the goal is not necessarily to sleep\nas much as a bulldog actually it's the\nonly animal see can't help myself it's\nthe only animal for which there's a\ngenetically induced apnea they're bracky\ncalic which means they have a short\nsnout they all those folds you know you\nknow when the folds are there the folds\nare there because they have a genetic\nmutation they bred out the pain\nreceptors in the face because they used\nto like have them like they would bull\nbait they bite on the face of the bull\nthey kill all the pain they bred out the\npain receptors gave them a floppy face\nshort\nsnout English Bulldog thank you for the\nspecificity a biologist loves the\nspecificity the Frenchies are pretty\ncool the Frenchies are pretty cool they\nhave a little more kicking them right\nthe Bulldogs little less and costell was\na bulldog master so he was s of more or\nless like a sea turtle you know just\nslow movement stopping and he's going\nforward and you can move aside or in\nfact Costello was so mellow that when he\nwould lie down on the floor had one of\nthose you know kind of robot vacuums\nthings we call a Roomba in our country\nit would come up to his face and he\nwould just and it would bounce off his\nnose and he wouldn't even take the\nopportunity to\nBlink it's the Bulldog is sort of the\nessence of a om of effort and actually\nif you look at people people resemble\ndifferent dog breeds I spent a lot of\ntime thinking about this some dogs and\nsome people have a bit more kind of\nreverberation in them they've got a\nhigher RPM all the time all the time all\nthe time and then they're the\nBulldogs right Rick Rubin right there\nare these people that are just more\nstill and we look at these people that\nare more still and think well there\nprobably isn't that much going on in\nthere but now we know from the Rick\nthing and the corl thing that they're\nthinking a lot but in the case of\nCostello they don't don't get much done\nyou know I maybe Costello wanted to get\nthings done but I he if he woke up on\nNew Year's Day and said all right 50\nrabbits this year he never actually\nachieved that but listen the point is\nsome of us sleep like Bulldogs some of\nus tend to go to sleep and wake up in\nthe middle of the\nnight I'm one of those people go to\nsleep four hours wake up I hate it it\nbut I figured out that non-sleep deep\nbreast or yoga needra has taught me how\nto fall back asleep really quickly and I\ncan recover some sleep I haven't gotten\nthrough non-sleep deep breast some\npeople are waking up in the middle of\nthe night because they don't have their\nsleep timing right we have a series on\nsleep coming out soon with the great\nMatt Walker we record a six episode\nseries with Matt and he talks about\nsomething I take no credit for this this\nis Matt's acronym qqr T quality quantity\nregularity and timing you want to pay\nattention to to the amount of sleep some\npeople need six some people need eight\nif you only got seven for years and\nyou're reading that you need eight or\nelse you'll get dementia please don't\nworry about it it is simply not the case\nsome people need less some people need\nmore this varies across the lifespan\nthen there's the quality how much of\nthat sleep is\ncontinuous did you drink caffeine in the\nafternoon or alcohol in the evening in\nwhich case the quality will be\ndiminished the regularity is very\ninteresting going to sleep more or less\nfive nights a week at least going to\nsleep more or less at the same time\nevery night plus or minus an hour it's\nfine on the weekends I'm not just saying\nthat so you don't all leave at once or a\nthird of you leave um some people do\nBest by going to bed at 800 or 900 p.m.\nand waking up at 3:00 or 4 in the\nmorning and that's where you would feel\nbest in fact if you're somebody that\nwakes up at 3:00 or 4 in the morning you\nmight be going to sleep too late and you\nhave this intrinsic chronotype as it's\ncalled and you can shift your clock a\nbit later but most people want to go to\nbed sometime between 10:00 p.m. and\nmidnight wake up sometime between 6:00\na.m. and 800 a.m. am and there's great\nvariation there too um but you know qqr\nT so think about the quality the\nquantity the regularity and the timing\nonce you dial those in everything is\nmuch much better so much so that even if\nyou're not getting enough sleep as long\nas you're going to bed more or less the\nsame time each night you'll you'll Faire\nbetter so if you didn't do any of this\nstuff for years like I didn't uh in when\nI was in graduate school Etc I don't\ndespair don't despair um it's very clear\nthat the brain can recover um and I\nwouldn't waste a single moment thinking\nabout what you didn't do um also my time\nmachine's broken your time machine's\nbroken I realize that doesn't create a\nlot of comfort but it's unlikely that\nyou did substantial damage unlikely you\ndid substantial damage unless you did\nthat your whole life and we're talking\nabout a conversation that's happening\nlate late in life but even then more\nsleep would be better do you believe in\nBurnout H if so what would be your\nrecommendation protocol relinquish\nburnout once it's already occurred this\nis a very interesting question you know\nwe don't quite know what burnout is and\nit can come from a combination of things\num and typically burnout comes not\nduring the stress period but several\nmonths afterwards you know that the\nadrenals you know these two little\nnuggets above our kidneys and our lower\nback are capable of driving so much\nneural energy in us that that we can do\nall sorts of things for a very long time\neven in the absence of food as long as\nwe have water and salt you know that the\nadrenals because they kick out\nadrenaline and cortisol and by the way\nare involved in salt appetite there's a\nreason for that because you need that\nthe adrenals can keep us going and there\nis no such thing as true adrenal burnout\nbecause the adrenals don't burn out\nyou've got enough adrenaline in your\nadrenals for two lifetimes but there is\nan adrenal insufficiency syndrome so\nthat's a real thing it's rare but it\nexists but burnout seems to be in my\nmind more related to psychological\nburnout and I'm not a psychologist but\nI'm a fan of the poet David White and he\nhas this beautiful poem that is either\nentitled or somehow\nincludes um the word\nwholeheartedness I think that where we\nrecover ourselves is by relating to and\nengaging with things and people that we\nwholeheartedly enjoy even if that is\nsimply relaxation or gardening or\ndrawing or maybe just doing nothing for\na bit I think burnout is very real and I\nthink burnout as pushed through the\nfilter of what we've been talking about\nearlier in the evening is when we are\nnot\ngetting\nperiodic experiences if you will of\ndelight or excitement or a sense of\nmeaning and and here we're starting to\ndrift into kind of abstract you know not\neveryone gets to do a job that they\nDelight in um certainly there were years\nwhere I didn't Delight in the sorts of\nthings I had to do for certain jobs but\nfinding some areas of life that create\nthose neural energy states that carry\nforward that Wick out into other aspects\nof what we're doing and I don't know if\nI made this point clear enough earlier\nbut those moments of you know really\nfeeling excited about something in a way\nthat really lights you up in\nparticular are not just about that\nmoment and seeking out more of those\nmoments but in the way that it lifts our\nnervous system the way it carries us\nforward and allows us to do the other\nthings that we have to do which frankly\nsometimes can be um not as exciting or\neven drudgery so if you've burnt out um\nI know the feeling I I have burnt out\nbefore and I encourage a combination of\nrest but also exploration of things that\ncan evoke that kind of internal\nexcitement or sense of meaning and one\nhas to be a bit of a forager in in order\nto do that try new things and that can\nbe difficult um but burnout is real and\nI encourage you to take it seriously\nbecause unfortunately typically what\nfollows burnout is depression and then\num things can really uh run ashore what\ntypes of food do you try to eat every\nday and why oh I love to eat um I do I\nlove to eat I even like the mere Act of\nchewing so much so um it just yeah um\nthat's why I buy those Persian cucumbers\nyou just munch on those things all the\ntime the um I I tend to eat according to\nhow alert or sleep I want to be it\nviolates a\nfew kind of popular thoughts about\nnutrition but that's what I do uh\ngenerally for me I like water caffeine\num in early in the day and eat sometime\naround 11:00 or noon I'm not really\nstrict about these things if I'm hungry\nI'll have a plate of eggs in the morning\nor something or a handful of macadamias\nby the way the macadamias down in\nAustralia are awesome on they're so good\nin the states they like Infuse them with\nall these Palm kernel oils and stuff and\nso when I first tasted the ones and they\nAl taste good but they're I'm not like\ngoing to get into the seed oil debate I\nthink a better ways to hang myself like\nwith this micro microphone cord it's l\nlike you know I don't I guess I do sort\nof avoid the seed oils but you know I\nfeel best um I love the oh the\nmacadamias see told you always find my\nway back the\nmacadamias down here tastes as if\nthey've been in infused with all sorts\nof stuff but then you look at the\npackaging it's just like macadamias and\nsalt I don't know what is so good the\ncoffee down here is amazing I know why\nit tastes so good it's so good the\nproduce I mean basically I eat like you\nguys gals I that's what I do that's what\nI do I basically eat meat and eggs and\nfruit and vegetables and I do like rice\nand oatmeal and like there are people on\nsocial media tell you like oatmeal is\ngoing to kill you and I'm like if\noatmeal were going to kill me I'd be\ndead like I eat so much oatmeal but\nthat's not to say that some people feel\nbetter if they don't eat oatmeal I kind\nof find the nutrition debates to be kind\nof like like funny they're so\nnon-scientific they're funny but I also\nknow that and here I have a theory that\nwhen you eat most of your foods from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources something magical happens not\nonly are\nyou let's say eating healthier foods\nquote unquote but we should Define\nhealthier foods that for which their\nmacronutrients proteins fats and\ncarbohydrates also and calories tend to\nbe matched pretty well with high\nmicronutrient content something that\ndoesn't exist in highly processed foods\nright but probably also better for the\nplanet but which is great I'm not being\nplanet's important we want to keep that\naround the um but the other thing is\nthat neurally when you eat Foods as\ntheir main ingredients which is not say\nyou can't have a soup or a stew or a\nsalad every once in a while but closer\nto their original form and I do cook my\nmeat unlike other people on the internet\nthe there's the guy eating chicken raw\nfor like 28 days I was in the barber\nshop the other day they're like what\nabout the raw chicken guy and I was like\nnot a good idea like the so when you eat\nFoods in their kind of basic\nstate the brain can associate The Taste\nwith the\nmacronutrient and amino acid cont\ncontent and micronutrient content and we\nknow that the gut is sensing a lot of\nthat unconsciously subconsciously we\nknow this through neural Pathways\nbeautiful work being done by people here\nin Australia and in the states and\nelsewhere about the signaling of for the\ngut is actually tasting the food or it's\nit's measuring the amount of amino acids\nfatty acids Etc and so when you eat\nFoods in their kind of more original\nform nonprocessed or minimally processed\nit's clear that the brain starts to\ndevelop a more specific Intuition or\nappetite for what you need you start to\nknow oh like I need some fat or I need\nsome protein or I'm crave you start to\nCrave the things according to what's\nactually in them and highly processed\nfoods and Rich combinations of foods\ndon't allow you to do that so and that\nhasn't really been explored there's a\nlittle bit of work that's coming out on\nthis by Dana small at Yale and um Kevin\nHall elsewhere you know but it's we sort\nof starting to get there so this is why\nI believe when people go on these\nelimination diets where they like I'm\nonly eating meat like the lion DED or\nwhatever like Costello meat only and\nlike that they many of those people\nquote unquote feel better I think\nbecause they're starting to form a\nrelationship with the nutrient content\nof the food the chloric content and the\ntaste in a way that after that they like\nsee a cracker and they're like no you\nknow they can kind of reset the neural\ncircuits around appetite and all of this\nstuff but for me because I'm an omore\nlike a normal person and sorry no\ndisrespect to the carnivores I just kind\nof like the blood drinking like liver\nchomping car like come on like the um\nI'm going to catch a bullet or like a\nyou know someone's going to thr a bone\nat me so I I I fear them more than I\nfear the vegans they'll just be like a\nbunch of you know the vegans will attack\nyou online but in person they'll just\nlike hit you with a parsley so it's not\nas you know the the um I'm going to get\nmyself in trouble the\num I'm an omav War like most people and\nthe and so for me between 11:00 a.m. and\n8:00 p.m. is typically when to eat but\nsometimes eat at 9: I didn't eat before\nthis cuz I don't like to eat right\nbefore I do this sort of thing so I'll\neat a meal before I go to sleep tonight\nI'm not super strict about this stuff\nI'm not super super strict but in\ngeneral it's some sort of intermittent\nis fasting thing and it tends to be Meat\nand Fish and eggs and love parmesan\ncheese and coffee and oranges and\ncucumbers and lettuce and and and food\nlike food and pasta and um and I I\nsuppose that having done that for so\nmany years I do you know adjust it like\nif I do a hard resistance training\nworkout I'll eat a few more starchy\ncarbohydrates to replenish glycogen but\nbut I tend to avoid extremes with all\nthat stuff and I love a great slice of\npizza and I've sort of lost my taste for\nsweets but occasionally I'll I'll do\nthat and I love vegetables like\ncroissants and things of that sort\nso but you know all kidding aside um you\nknow I do try and eat pretty healthy\nevery day with a ton of info out there\nabout health and wellness Andrew I love\nthe way uh nikil um what are your top\nhealth and fitness style recommendations\nfor someone who has a busy lifestyle\nthis is a great question and you know I\nget accused a lot I can accus a lot of a\nlot of things um but you know one of\nthem is well no one can do all this\nstuff but we talked about it earlier we\ndo the best with what we have and the\ntime we have try and get some bright\nsunlight even through cloud cover\nespecially through cloud cover every day\nI try and dim the lights or you know get\nunder red light not Red Light Panel\nnecessarily but just put in like red\nparty light I've done that this whole\ntrip when we traveled in the evening\njust it's just a red light bulb there\nit's not fancy just a red light bulb\nscrews in this little pedestal turn that\non all the other lights go off and then\nmakes for a nice easy taper into sleep\nbecause you know the the blue the blue\nand bright fluorescent lights those\nshort wavelength light really is\nactivating for the nervous system\nespecially late in the day so light is a\nbig one for me try and get a few walks\nin I think if you were going to exercise\njust two days a week it's very clear\nthat those two days per week should be\ninclude some resistance training\nexercise and then maybe follow up with\nsome easy cardiovascular training or\nsomething like that um hopefully one\ncould get out in about maybe three days\nor or exercise sometimes not outside one\ncan only exercise indoors maybe three\ndays per week so I don't think it takes\na ton of time necessarily but that might\neven be excessive so with busy lifestyle\nI think it's those little carve outs of\nfive or 10 minute walk um when we had\nAndy Galpin on the podcast and did a\nseries and by the way Andy's launching\nhis own podcast through our podcast um\nChannel um which is scom uh which Rob\nand I started um he's got the perform\npodcast with Andy Galpin he talked a\nlittle bit about these exercise snacks\nthese are actually pretty cool um in the\nsense that if you just take 60 seconds\nand do you know like an near allout you\nknow run up the stairs but be careful or\njumping jacks for a minute as fast as\nyou can that raises heart rate in a way\nand adjusts your physiology in a way\nthat really does carry over to better\nperformance including even things like\nV2 Max in other endeavors so it's\nprobably not the case that that's all\nyou should do but even small bouts of\nexercise can be very very valuable um so\nthat that's reassuring and then I am a\nhuge fan of non-sleep deep breast AKA\nYoga Nidra which means yoga sleep which\nis just lying there as uh we talked\nabout before but it's slightly different\nthan what we were talking about for\ncreativity lying there and deliberately\ninducing using your mind to deeply relax\nthe different muscles of your body stay\ncalm long exhale breathing this kind of\nthing there's a 10-minute nstr with my\nvoice on YouTube that you can simply\nfind and at zero cost there are many\nwith other voices female voices Etc that\nyou can find on YouTube as well\nand if you don't like those we're soon\nto release on our human lab Clips\nChannel a number of different\nmeditations and nsdr again all zero cost\nof 10 minute 20 minute 30 minute I would\nsay that for limiting stress improving\nsleep and restoring mental and physical\nVigor nsdr is perhaps the best tool out\nthere and again I didn't create it I\nsimply took yoga Nedra I started calling\nit nsdr and by the way I was aware that\nI was going to upset some people when I\ndid that I was not trying to appropriate\nanything I promise the problem was I\nwould talk about Yoga Nidra and studies\nof yoga\nshowing that it replenishes dopamine in\nthe basil ganglia can restore mental and\nphysical Vigor and then people would\nback away from me slowly like yoga I\ndon't want to do yoga I'm like no no\nthis is Yoga sleep you don't actually\nmove and they're like well that sounds\npretty different and I'm like I know it\nsounds different I'd go on and on and\nthen I just decide to call it non-sleep\ndeep rest and when you call something\nwhat it is or what it can accomplish you\nmove away from nomenclature and um I\nhave very mixed feelings about renaming\nthings but I figured as long as I don't\ncall it like the huberman protocol at\nleast I'm distancing myself from it and\nit's a zeroc cost protocol so non-sleep\ndeep rest is valuable for restoring\nmental and physical Vigor it can\npotentially help offset sleep that you\ndidn't get it can help you fall back\nasleep at night if you do in the middle\nof the night it can help you get better\nat falling asleep if you do do it during\nthe day I did it for 20 minutes just\nprior to coming out here I always do\nthat um prior to any event that or thing\nthat requires a lot of focus this kind\nof thing otherwise the jokes I tell are\nreally you know just not okay and um so\nI do think it's quite valuable and it's\nsomething to explore at what age would\nyou consider testosterone replacement\ntherapy wow and what are the risk versus\nbenefits of starting it sooner rather\nthan later we got shouts well so one of\nthe major effects of testosterone\nreplacement therapy is is spontaneous\nshouting out in crowds\num just kidding\num you know there've been number of\nstudies of testosterone in males and\nfemales by the way females have more\ntestosterone than they do estrogen you\nknow that right per deciliter of blood\nhigher testosterone than estrogen just\non average on average they tend to have\nlower testosterone than men per\ndeciliter of blood so it's important in\nboth males and females um I think you're\nreferring James to the use of so-called\ntrt in males but I'll touch on it in\nfemales as well because lowd dose trt\ntherapy\noop sorry I just did that I get in\ntrouble in in if you say like PCR\nreaction ATM machine is there a name for\nthat okay T the T at the end of trt is\ntherapy testosterone replacement therapy\ntestosterone replacement therapy\ntechnically means that someone's levels\nprior to that therapy fall outside the\nreference range so low lower than 300\nnanograms per deciliter typically or\nsome other array of symptoms at and they\nreplace it replacement therapy many many\npeople nowadays in my opin opinion for\nfar too many and Too Young take what I\ncall testosterone augmentation therapy\nwhere their levels are within normal\nrange and then they take it to get out\nof range and look there's nothing wrong\nwith that I'm not going to tell you what\nto do I'm not a cop you do what you want\nto do um there a couple things trt or\ntat augmentation and here we're just\nsetting aside high do steroid use um cuz\nthat's just a whole other Biz and and\nfrankly the bodybuilders will get upset\nbut um but I'll get away from you\nbecause you'll be waddling and I'll be\nrunning\num the that's just like a whole other\nbusiness so\num testosterone replacement therapy is\num widely used nowadays I think far too\nyoung basically it will lower your sperm\ncount dramatically if you're a male so\nso you'd have if you want children um\nyou want to conceive children you will\nneed to offset that by taking something\nlike human chonic gonadotrope and HCG um\nwhich is available synthetically they\nused to sell it in the form of pregnant\nwomen's urine um there was a black\nmarket for it we could really go off\ninto the sticks with this question um my\nin my opinion if you want\nto explore this I would say first get\nyour behaviors right sleep exercise\nnutrition stress control training get\nthat right don't train too hard or too\nlong get that right then there are\ncertain supplements and we've talked\nabout this on the podcast some are\ndebated a little bit more than others\nthings like zinc Tong Ali Etc that can\nprobably provide a boost Beyond normal\nwithout shutting down the gonads um and\nthen and only then if you feel you\nreally want to do this and it's in line\nwith your ethics or you know I don't\nknow if you're playing a drug tested\nsport Etc\num then just minimal effective dose and\nthen if you want to have kids someday or\nif you don't know if you want to have\nkids someday make sure you're taking the\nappropriate things to offset that that's\nbasically what I would say and the major\neffect of testosterone in men and women\nis not libido per se and it's not\naggression per se it tends to make\npeople more like them if you're a jerk\nyou're going become more of a jerk if\nyou're calm you're become more calm if\nyou're kind you're GNA I don't know if\nyou become Kinder but there actually\nbeen studies of altruistic behavior and\nadministration of testosterone by nasal\nspray or other means and frankly people\nwill become more they'll become\ncompetitively\naltruistic um I think the major effect\nalso could be described as it makes\neffort feel good so um we could go on\nand on about this I'll just toss in that\nnowadays there's a lot of excitement\nabout peptides I'm going to do an\nepisode about peptides a lot of the\nyoung people I run into um here and in\nthe states are like what are you what\nare your thoughts on bpc c57 what do you\nthink about this peptide or that peptide\npeptides are simply small proteins um\namino acid chains um so there are lots\nof things called peptides but typically\nthese are things that increase growth\nhormone that keep in mind that anything\nthat increases growth hormone will\nincrease the growth of any and all\ntissues so if you have a small tumor\nthat you're not aware of that will grow\nalso so just keep in mind if you're\ngoing to tickle these Pathways you're\nyou're playing some with some serious\nbiology but there are safe ways to do it\nsorry you said What are the benefits of\nstar it sooner rather than later uh\nstart it\nlater what are the physiological and\npractical differences between breathing\ntechniques can do Wim Hoff and the\nphysiological side relation stress Focus\nEtc okay we can make this pretty\nstraightforward first of all I know whim\nwe go way back to 2015 I went over to\nthe Pyrenees and visited him and hung\nout and then brought him to the states\nand you wiim Hof breathing is Tumo\nbreathing but in science speak we call\nit cyclic hyperventilation it's just\ncyclic hyperventilation\nso\num if you inhale vigorously and\nlong your heart rate goes up if you\nexhale vigorously and\nlong heart rate goes down through a\nprocess called respiratory sinus\narhythmia volume of the heart changes\nwhen you breathe in versus breathe out\nspeed at which blood moves through the\nheart changes as the blood gets bigger\nor smaller according to inhales exhales\nand basically the net effect is inhale\nheart speeds up a little bit exhale\nheart slows down a little bit so so if\nyou do Wim Hof AKA Tumo breathing and\nyou inhale\nvigorously and let it fall out of your\nmouth and\nthen you're going to increase heart rate\nincrease autonomic activation Etc if you\ndo a pattern of breathing like inhale\ninhale long exhale inhale inhale long\nexhale cyclic\nsighing over time you're going to slow\nthe heart rate down and you're going to\ncalm down that's just how it works so\nwhen I hear about box breathing or now\nyou hear about box breathing okay it's\nrelatively equal ratios of inhale exhale\nso a little bit of pause in there that's\nthe Box inhale hold exhale hold inhale\nhold exhale hold of varying durations\ndepending on your so-called carbon\ndioxide tolerance but at the end of the\nday you're maintaining kind of even\nheart rate when you do big cyclic\nhyperventilation AK Wim Hoff Tumo\nbreathing your increasing heart rate in\nautonomic arousal release of adrenaline\ndo cyclic sighing a lot of exhales the\nopposite is true okay so that should\ngive you a framework for thinking about\nbreathing and how to apply different\nbreathing techniques and get us away\nfrom some of the naming of things but\nI'm not trying to take anything away\nfrom so-called Wim Hoff breathing um by\nthe way if you're going to do Wim Hoff\nbreathing be very very careful to not do\ncyclic hyperventilation or whm Hoff\nbreathing and then do breath holds and\ndon't do it and anywhere don't do that\nanywhere near water there have been\ncases of people drowning dying from\ncombining cyclic hyperventilation and\nbreathholds with water because it\nchanges the threshold for shallow water\nblockout when you exhale a lot or when\nyou\nhyperventilate you remove a lot of\ncarbon dioxide and carbon dioxide is the\nstimulus to gasp so what will happen is\nindeed if you\ndo you're blowing off a lot of carbon\ndioxide and you go right that's a whim\nexhale and then you hold and you go\nunderwater yeah you'll hold your breath\nlonger than you normally would but\ninstead of feeling that impulse to\nbreathe like the that gas reflex and you\nshoot for the surface you'll just BL\ndone so it's a serious thing and you\nwant to be really careful to not combine\ncyclic hyperventilation and breath holds\nand especially both\nwith cold water frankly any water\nexposure I always say don't do Wim Hoff\nTumo or cyclic hyperventilation\nbreathing even standing or seated in a\npuddle okay so in response to stress\nit's really if you want to be more alert\nincrease the Vigor and duration of your\ninhales if you want to be more calm\nincrease the duration of your\nexhales would you recommend that\nchildren also get morning sunlight yes\nand your pets too unless they're\nnocturnal pets right for anyone that had\nthe not so smart idea of getting a\nhamster\nyou realize they're nocturnal right\nthey're going to run all night long on\nthe wheel in fact rodents like to run on\nWheels so much that hoppy Hofer at\nHarvard has shown that if you put a\nlittle running wheel like you know\nlittle wheels that the mice like to run\nin there in a field animals will run to\nthe wheel and run in the\nfield which tells you everything you\nneed to know about rodents but really um\nchildren need that but obviously babies\nhave sensitive eyes you you know we all\ncan potentially hurt ourselves with\nsunlight and down here the UV index is\nvery high when the sun is low in the Sky\nso-call low solar angle sunlight in the\nmorning and in the evening the UV index\nand be mostly because of atmospheric\ninterference but some other things as\nwell it does it's not as damaging to the\neyes that's why it's easier to watch a\nsunrise or a Sun closer to the Horizon\nit is to you know please don't stare at\nthe sun in any case but an overhead Sun\nso I I think it's really important for\ncircadian rhythms but of course kids\nneed their sleep so if they're going to\nsleep in a little bit that's fine just\nget them outside afterwards it's the\nstaying inside and staying on a phone\nthat's problematic and then leaving that\nroom at noon really shift your circadian\nrhythm in unhealthy ways and that's true\nfor children perhaps especially true for\nchildren as a father what can I be doing\nto give my children the best start in\nlife what a great question I hope my\nparents ask that um they abandoned me at\nthe pet store no I'm kidding they didn't\nthey didn't abandon me they didn't\nabandon me at the bed store um if they\ndid I didn't notice I was among my\nfriends the fishes and the birds um I\nthink this question probably should be\nI'm going to I'm going to edit just say\nwhat can we all be doing to give our\nchildren the best start in life and and\nwhat does that mean for those of us that\nhave already started in life um so first\nof all we have a episode of The hubman\nLab podcast with an absolutely\nmagnificent guest Dr Becky Kennedy\num coming out on I guess it' be Tuesday\ndown here so this coming week all about\nthis and you know we could talk about\nthings for learning encourage them to\nplay an instrument um I would think that\nwe perhaps should teach kids some tools\nto modulate their stress in real time\nlike physiological size I don't see why\nnot um I certainly wish I had tools to\nregulate my stress when I was younger\nnow they didn't teach us that stuff they\ndidn't know it where it the knowledge\nwas there but as I mentioned earlier\nthey didn't teach us that stuff they\ntaught us all sorts of stuff in high\nschool health and stuff I mean they they\ntaught us that you know drunk driving's\nbad um they taught us it just takes one\nsperm one time they um they taught us\nall sorts of stuff but they didn't teach\nus the uh this business of physiological\nsize or stress thresholds or about the\ninter mining L cortex because a lot of\nthat stuff wasn't known or just wasn't\ndiscussed so I think some tools to\ncontrol one 's inner landscape play\nmusic I certainly am going to encourage\nthe exploration of these energy states\nthat you know letting kids explore I\nmean they need rules and Regulation and\nboundaries of course but there's this\nconcept of impingement that I find very\ninteresting that the classic\npsychologists used to talk about you\nknow when we when a kid says they like\nsomething or don't like things like yes\nthey need to be doing certain things for\ntheir normal life progression but kids\nare very good sensors of what works for\nthem and what doesn't work for them we\ndon't want to impinge on certainly their\nhealthy loves and desires things that\ndon't endanger them right things that\nare really reflect their unique loves\nand desires don't force them to play\nSuzuki violin if they want to play the\ndrums right let let them bang on stuff\nand let the kids that want to play\nSuzuki violin do that don't make them\nplay the drums so these impingements\nactually I think are are problematic\nthey they lead to a lot of Confusion And\nif anything else they you know they they\ntake us away from that unique wiring to\nbe our own unique expression um Becky\nKennedy does describe a few key\nprinciples of parenting that I think are\nreally interesting that extend to all\nkinds of relationships she talks about\nthe main role of parenting and to some\nextent all\nrelationships is to create\nboundaries and to make kids feel safe\nseems pretty good to me um the other\nkind of\nshort list of two things and she\ndescribes how to do this in in ways that\num are highly actionable is that every\nchild I found this really interesting\nevery child wants to feel real like they\nwant to feel like they're real like\nthey're seen they exist and they want to\nfeel safe and so that one of the things\nthat really rung in my ears and still\ndoes from that episode recording again\nout this week is that when a kid or an\nadult says something about how they feel\nthat perhaps one of the best responses\nwe can give them is you know I believe\nyou like that it doesn't you're not\nsaying that like you don't want to go to\nschool don't go to school right we're\nnot saying you don't you don't enjoy\ndoing something don't do it or or you\nwant like a you know a fifth serving of\ncandy like you can say like I believe\nyou you know no um you know and so I\nthink that a lot of it is is is you know\nwe get confused with terms like\nvalidation and listening I mean what I\nlike so much about what Becky offers um\nand I'm I do hope to do a Child\nDevelopment series and the not too\ndistant future um what what I like so\nmuch about what Becky offers is that you\nknow it boils down to simple\nConcepts like we want to\nbe real which I guess is a kind of an\nanalog for scene and we want to feel\nsafe not unlike when we did the podcast\nseries on Mental Health with Dr Paul kti\nhe said you know it's really about\nmental health is really about agency and\ngratitude but there are a lot of things\nthat siphon up into those feelings or\nthose moments of or that state of agency\nand gratitude so I I would say that's\nperhaps the most important thing is you\nknow boundaries make kids feel safe and\nthen make them feel real like their\nfeelings and and what they're reporting\nmatters um and then of course the\nimpingement thing becomes a little bit\ncomplicated because they do need\nboundaries so we have to constrain their\nwishes sometimes and their behavior but\nwe don't want to do it in a way that\ntakes them away from that unique wiring\nthat makes them who they are so they can\nbecome you know the the characters and\npeople and professionals and creatives\nand scientists and Poets and just you\nknow good people right everyday good\npeople so that's the best answer I can\nprovide at this time\nthey're not going to give me another\nquestion but I can keep going just\nbriefly if I may um by just first of all\nsaying that um again I'm very very\ngrateful for the opportunity to convene\nwith all of you here tonight I realized\nit was me speaking and you listening\nexcept for the guy on testosterone and\num and I and I certainly um you know I I\ncan't really express it enough in words\nwhat um the podcast means to me you know\nit's uh it's a it's a bizarre uh it's a\nbizarre thing it's completely\ntransformed my life it's um made it you\nknow incredible um I never dreamed of\nanything like this but for me it's\nreally not about hearing my own voice\nit's it's this compulsion that came at\nan early age and and it's really my wish\nfrankly that um the tools the protocols\nthe knowledge whatever it inspires you\nto do or to think um you know we don't\nhave to agree on everything I would hope\nwe don't agree on everything the ways we\ndisagree um with me and with each other\nand with others that you know that we\nstart maybe thinking about ourselves as\nthrough a lens of science um and think\nabout health and and and really trying\nto meet those discussions with with the\nkind of benevolence and curiosity and\nyou know Vigor you know a good argument\nevery once in a while it's healthy too\num that it really deserves you know I\nthink we're we're in very interesting\nand kind of sometimes scary time um I\noften feel scared frankly um because of\nwhat I see and and even my own position\nin this whole landscape I sometimes\nthink like I feel like a lot of times\nthings are just kind of hanging on by a\nthread but I actually have a lot of\noptimism I think our species is very\nsmart I think that um we've managed to\nnavigate tricky places before and I\nthink that through the learning and\nteaching of things that work for us that\nwe learned from this these kinds of\nthings and from each other that pretty\nsoon we're going to start to fill in the\ngaps between the silos that are the yoga\nTraditions the chiropractic massage\nhealth and fitness traditional medicine\nnon-traditional medicine functional\nmedicine I mean I really encourage all\nof you to try and you know stand back\nfrom it all and try and identify the\ncommon themes that may exist across\nthese things and and really try and\nidentify some of the the links and\npoints of convergence more than the\ndifferences and and at the very least to\nexplore things if you don't like them\nyou know that's great and if you do to\npass them on to other people um\nespecially the behavioral tools that we\nall Harbor within us that I think can\nreally uh enhance our mental health and\nvigor um our physical health and\nhopefully our longevity too so I could\ngo on and on but I really just want to\nsay thank you so much for coming out\ntonight um this is our last night in\nAustralia and I'm certainly going to\nmiss being here and we intend to come\nback again soon thank you so much for\npaying tuning into\nthe podcast paying attention to and\ntuning into the podcast and for being\nwilling to learn you're all amazing\nstudents and you're also amazing\nteachers I learned from you all uh in\ncomments and feedback so um if you have\nthat please keep that coming and last\nbut certainly not least thank you for\nyour interest in\n[Applause]\nscience actually I've never done this\nbefore\nbut because it's my last night here I've\nI've always seen people do this and I've\nnever done it but I'm going to do it can\nwe get the house lights up I want to get\none of these like I'm going to do this\nas a video and you don't have to do it\nyour faces will show up but don't worry\nwe won't um it will go on the internet\nbut this is not for me I just want\nto I'm going to send my mother this okay\nthere we\ngo thank you that's on you\nthank you you made my mother very happy\n[Music]"
