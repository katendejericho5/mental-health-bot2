    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine\ntoday we are discussing MDMA sometimes\nreferred to as ecstasy or Mali MDMA\nstands for methylene dioxy\nmethamphetamine that's right you heard\nthe word methamphetamine in there and\nMDMA has properties similar to\nmethamphetamine but also properties that\nare very distinct from methamphetamine\njust as a side note methamphetamine is a\ncommonly used drug of abuse it is an\nillicit drug and it produces some of the\ngreatest and fastest increases in the\nneuromodulator dopamine of any available\ndrugs on the street or in the clinic and\nbelieve it or not methamphetamine is\nprescribed as a prescription drug in\nsome very limited clinical uses\nMDMA methylene dioxy methamphetamine has\nproperties similar to methamphetamine in\nthat it powerfully promotes the release\nof dopamine and it is a stimulant and\nyet it also powerfully controls the\nrelease of Serotonin and in doing so\nmakes MDMA a distinct category of\ncompound from either classic\npsychedelics like psilocybin or LSD\nwhich largely work on the serotonin\nsystem and tend to produce mystical\nexperiences and it's also distinct from\nPure stimulants such as methamphetamine\nbecause MDMA by producing big increases\nin both dopamine and serotonin acts as\nwhat's called an empathogen it actually\ncan increase one sense of Social\nconnectedness and empathy not just for\nother people but for oneself and in that\nway MDMA is commonly used as a\nrecreational drug but also is now being\ntested and is a achieving incredible\nearly results in clinical trials for its\nuse as an empathogen for the treatment\nof PTSD in clinical therapeutic settings\nI want to be very clear that at this\npoint in time June 2023 MDMA is still a\nschedule one drug that is it is highly\nillegal to possess or sell in the United\nStates and today we are going to talk\nabout some of the path to legality\nthat's underway we are also going to\ntalk about the history of MDMA and why\nit became illegal and we are going to\ntalk about the key difference between\nrecreational use and therapeutic use and\nthe important components of the studies\nexploring MDMA in the clinical setting\nfor the treatment of PTSD so during\ntoday's discussion we will talk about\nwhat MDMA really is how it works at the\nlevel of neurons which brain circuits it\nactivates and deactivates and in doing\nso you will come to understand why it is\nso exciting as a treatment for PTSD will\nyou will also of course talk about the\nresults of of these clinical trials\nusing MDMA for the treatment of PTSD\nthey are incredibly exciting in fact the\nfield of Psychiatry has never before\nseen the kind of success in treatment of\nPTSD with any other compound that they\nare seeing and achieving with the\nappropriate safe use of MDMA and when I\nsay appropriate that means in\nconjunction with nine therapy sessions\nso this is an area that really deserves\nsome time for us to discuss because\nagain there is a distinct difference\nbetween the recreational and the\ntherapeutic use of MDMA we will also\ntalk about the toxicity of MDMA this is\na very important issue because many of\nyou have perhaps heard that MDMA quote\nunquote puts holes in your brain or\nkills serotonin neurons or kills\ndopamine neurons and indeed MDMA because\nof its similarity to methamphetamine\nwhich is highly neurotoxic MDMA can be\nneurotoxic however there are ways to use\nMDMA therapeutically that avoid avoid\nits toxicity and yet there are still\nquestions about its toxicity and its\nlong-term effects both after acute use\nmeaning just one to three times as well\nas chronic use meaning people who have\ntaken it many many times we'll talk\nabout the spacing between sessions of\nMDMA we will talk about dosages we will\nalso talk about things that people do\nand that can be done to offset some of\nthe potential toxicity of MDMA so by the\nend of today's discussion you will have\na thorough understanding of what MDMA is\nwhat it isn't what is known about what\nit does\nwhat is known about what it doesn't do\nas well as some of the still outstanding\nquestions about MDMA that remain to be\nresolved before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Helix sleep\nHelix sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are the absolute highest quality I\nstarted sleeping on a helix mattress\nover two years ago and since starting to\nsleep on a helix mattress I've had the\nbest sleep of my life and that's because\nthe mattress is tailored to my unique\nsleep needs everybody has unique sleep\nneeds and if you go to the Helix website\nyou can take a very brief two minute\nquiz we'll ask you questions such as do\nyou tend to sleep on your back your side\nor your stomach are you somebody who\ntends to run warm or cold during the\nnight Etc perhaps you don't know the\nanswers to those questions that's fine\nyou can simply put that response and\nHelix will match you to a mattress\nthat's ideal for your sleep needs this\nis so critical because sleep is the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance and when we are\nsleeping well consistently everything in\nlife goes that much better and when we\nare not sleeping well consistently\neverything suffers there's a ton of\nscience to support those statements so\nif you're interested in upgrading your\nmattress go to helixsleep.com huberman\ntake their two-minute sleep quiz and\nthey'll match you to a customized\nmattress and you'll get up to 350 off\nall mattress orders and two free pillows\nagain if you're interested you can go to\nhelixsleep.com huberman for up to 350\noff and two free pillows today's episode\nis also brought To Us by Roca Roca\nMike's eyeglasses and sunglasses that\nare the absolute highest quality the\ncompany was founded by two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford and everything\nabout Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with performance in mind\nI've spent a lifetime working on the\nbiology the visual system and I can tell\nyou that your visual system has to\ncontend with an enormous number of\ndifferent Channel challenges in order\nfor you to be able to see clearly Roka\nunderstands those challenges and has\ndesigned their eyeglasses and sunglasses\naccordingly so that you always see with\nperfect clarity their eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were initially designed for\nsports performance and as a consequence\nthey are very lightweight which is great\nthey also won't slip off your face if\nyou get sweaty however even though they\nwere designed for sports performance\nthey now also include a lot of styles\nthat are designed to be worn to work out\nto dinner essentially recreationally so\nthat you could wear anywhere if you'd\nlike to try Roca eyeglasses or\nsunglasses go to Roka that's

is a\nketone supplement that increases blood\nketones I know most people are familiar\nwith or at least have heard of the\nso-called ketogenic diet it's used for\nweight loss it's used to control\nepilepsy it's used for mental health\nreasons however most people including\nmyself do not follow a ketogenic diet\nnonetheless increasing your blood\nketones can improve the function of your\nbrain and the function of your body and\nthat's because ketones are preferred use\nof fuel for the brain and body so even\nthough I follow an omnivore diet that is\nI'm not in a ketogenic State I use\nKetone IQ to increase my blood ketones\nprior to doing preparation for podcasts\nor writing grants or doing research as\nwell as prior to workouts especially if\nI want to work out fasted I'll take some\nKetone IQ to increase my blood ketones\nwhich gives me a lot of energy during\nworkouts or during bouts of cognitive\nwork even if I haven't eaten in the\npreceding hours it really increases my\nfocus and my energy levels if you'd like\nto try Ketone IQ you can go to hvmn.com\nhuberman to save 20 off again that's\nhvmn.com huberman to save 20 let's talk\nabout MDMA MDMA or ecstasy is a\nfascinating compound and I say\nfascinating from the perspective of its\nchemical structure which is highly\nunusual\nI say fascinating because it has an\nincredible set of subjective effects in\nterms of how it makes people feel and it\nhas a fascinating history so let's just\nbriefly start with the history of MDMA\nMDMA was synthesized by the drug company\nMerck in the early 1900s but it actually\nwas never applied to any particular\nclinical use and it wasn't really\nexplored much in any Laboratories at all\nand then it was later rediscovered by a\nguy named Alexander shulgin\nwho was a bit of a renegade drug chemist\nwho was designing different drugs for\nthe purpose of understanding their\nsubjective effects on humans so there's\na long history of Shogun designing drugs\nhe was after all a chemist and then\ntaking those drugs himself and then if\nhe liked the effects of a particular\ndrug or rather if he thought that it had\npotential clinical utility he would give\nit to his wife then she would give him\nher notes about those drugs and then\nthey would share them with their friends\nand it was a small group of friends who\nconsisted of therapists and Physicians\nso this was a really underground kind of\noperation it was technically not illegal\nwhen it started because MDMA wasn't\nillegal when it started but over the\nseveral decades that Shogun and his wife\nand this group were doing this kind of\nexploration MDMA did become illegal and\nhe fell under well let's just say\nscrutiny by the DEA\nnow here's the important thing to\nunderstand about MDMA and its history\nfirst of all\nMDMA is a synthetic compound as far as\nwe know it does not exist anywhere in\nnature so unlike similar compounds such\nas mescaline because MDMA and masculine\nare very similar in their chemical\nproperties and to some extent their\nsubjective properties\nunlike mescaline which can be found in\nthe plant kingdom or LSD which comes\nfrom ergot or psilocybin which of course\ncan be found in magic mushrooms MDMA is\na unique chemical in that again as far\nas We Know\nonly exists in its synthetic form it is\nhuman made and as we get into the\nchemical effects and the subjective\neffects of MDMA a little bit later in\nthe episode I think you'll understand\nwhy it is such a unique and to some\nextent exciting compound from the\nperspective of clinical treatment put\ndifferently there's really no other\ncompound that we know of in nature or in\nthe pharmaceutical industry shelf or\noptions of drugs that are prescription\ndrugs that produce the kinds of effects\nthat MDMA does and by the way if you're\ninterested in the story of Alexander\nShogun and the drugs he synthesized and\nthe group that he built up to take these\ndrugs and try them and actually had\nseveral members of this group using\nthese drugs in therapy with their\npatients\nfor a long period of time both before\nand after MDMA became illegal\nthere's a wonderful book called pikal\nthat stands for\np-i-k-h-a-l p call is the title of the\nbook which Shogun wrote which describes\nhis discovery of MDMA I confess it also\ndescribes the synthesis of MDMA and for\nthat reason was a book that for a long\ntime was not available but is now\navailable again in audible form and in\nprinted form pcall stands for\nphenylethylamines I have known and loved\nphenylethylamines is the category of\ndrug for which MDMA belongs to and it's\na long book but a very interesting one\nboth from the perspective of\nunderstanding the history of MDMA and\nwhat MDMA is and the effects that it\nproduces but it's also an interesting\nbook because it will teach you a lot\nabout the history of the pharmaceutical\nindustry the War on Drugs in the United\nStates and the interaction between\nillegal drug exploration and drugs for\nclinical treatment of psychiatric\nchallenges so right now this is a very\nimportant issue because MDMA is\ncurrently granted breakthrough status\nwhich means it's now something that\nscientists and clinicians can study if\nthey have authorization to do that it is\nas I mentioned earlier still a schedule\non drugs so it's illegal to possess\nunless you are one of these scientists\nwho has been granted permission to study\nit in the clinical setting or the\nlaboratory setting and right now we are\non the cusp of MDMA becoming legal but\nagain it is not yet legal and this is\nsomething I'm going to touch back on a\nfew times during today's episode\nlater for instance when we talk about\nthe potential toxicity of MDMA its\nability potentially to kill neurons\nthe neurons it has been hypothesized to\nkill are neurons of the serotonin and\ndopamine type so this is something you\nwould not want let's just recall that\nkilling off of or death of dopamine\nneurons is the underlying basis for\nParkinson's Disease which is a movement\ndisorder where people have difficulty\ngenerating smooth movements and in very\nsevere form they can't move at all they\nsort of become locked in to some extent\nand it also has cognitive effects so you\ndon't want to lose dopamine neurons and\nloss of serotonergic neurons is known to\nimpact mood negatively mood regulation\nnegatively Etc\nthe story of MDMA and its potential\nneurotoxicity comes slam right up\nagainst this issue of legality and what\nwe'll get into a little bit later is\nthat there has been a sort of race in\nthe scientific Community consisting of\ntwo groups one set of groups trying to\nestablish the toxicity of MDMA so that\nit does not become legal again and\nanother group trying to establish the\nutility and the lack of toxicity in MDMA\nso that it does become legal again for\nthe treatment of PTSD so even though the\nstory P call relates to events that took\nplace largely in the 1970s 80s and 90s\nright now MDMA and its toxicity or lack\nof toxicity its legality or lack of\nlegality are really key issues so as\nyou're listening to this I'm giving you\na real-time blow-by-blow of what led up\nto where we are now but we will also\nwant to think about how what's happening\nright now including the description of\nthese data on MDMA may or may not impact\nthe potential legal status of MDMA okay\nso what is MDMA MDMA is 3 4 methylene\ndioxy methamphetamine but unless you're\na chemist that's not going to mean much\nto you nor should it\nMDMA has some very interesting\nproperties the first of which is that\nmethamphetamine component which because\nit's a methamphetamine and acts like\nother amphetamines what it does is it\nblocks the reuptake of dopamine from\nneurons after dopamine is released so\nfor those of you that heard the episode\nthat I did on drugs to treat ADHD I\ndiscussed the biology and mechanisms of\ndrugs like Adderall and Vyvanse which\nbasically are either combinations of\namphetamines or single types of\namphetamines that have either a quick\nrelease or a long release\nnow MDMA because it has this\nmethamphetamine component prevents the\nreuptake of dopamine and in doing so\ncreates net increases in dopamine so for\nthose of you that don't have a\nbackground in neurobiology let me just\nbriefly explain I'll make this very\nsimple neurons or nerve cells release\nchemicals at their sites of\ncommunication which are called synapses\nsynapses are little gaps between neurons\nand what happens is the neurons spit out\nthese little spherical balls which we\ncall vesicles or vesicles depending on\nwhere in the world you live they'll\neither be called vesicles or vesicles\nand those little vesicles contain\nneurotransmitter or what's technically\nreferred to as a neuromodulator dopamine\nis a neuromodulator can modulate the\nactivity of other neurons it can either\nincrease or decrease the activity of\nother neurons now at the end of the\nneuron that what we call the axonal\nBouton okay axon is the wire component\nof the neuron that can reach to another\nside in the brain and then release the\nneurotransmitter or neuromodulator there\nat those axonal boutons which are the\nsites of release\nthe vesicles literally fuse with the\nedge of the neuron and vomit their\nneuromodulator out into the synapse and\nthen the neuromodulator in this case\ndopamine will bind to receptors on the\npostsynaptic side that means to another\nneuron and then depending on how much\nbinds and depending on what else is\ngoing on in that local neighborhood of\nneuronal connections the neuron will\neither increase its neural activity and\nitself release neuromodulator and\nneurotransmitter someplace else so sort\nof a chain reaction or else it will\nsuppress its activity and the flow of\ncommunication from one neuron to the\nnext will be stopped okay so MDMA\ndoesn't prevent the release of dopamine\nat the synapse it does quite the\nopposite it actually prevents the\nsucking up of the dopamine that's been\nreleased and that does not bind to The\nreceptors so basically what it does is\nit blocks these things called dopamine\nTransporters and the Transporters are\nthe things that suck back up the\ndopamine that's been released that has\nnot bound to receptors so because it\nblocks that sucking up process\nthere's more dopamine around in the\nsynapse to hang out and then bind to\nreceptors once some become available\nokay the other thing that the\nmethamphetamine component of MDMA does\njust like methamphetamine is that it\nactually gets into what we call the\npresynaptic neuron the neuron that\nreleases the dopamine and it interferes\nwith the repackaging of dopamine into\nthose vesicles now you might think oh it\ninterferes with the repackaging of\ndopamine into vesicles and therefore\nless will be released but actually what\nhappens is as a consequence of that\na bunch of dopamine builds up in the\npresynaptic neuron so that when an\nelectrical impulse comes down that\nneuron and dopamine is released a huge\namount of dopamine is released and this\nis one of the characteristic properties\nof methamphetamine end of MDMA which is\nthat it leads to enormous increases in\nthe amount of dopamine released and the\namount of dopamine that hangs around in\nthe synapse and therefore it increases\nwhat we call dopaminergic Tone or\ndopaminergic drive that's just a bunch\nof different ways to describe increases\nin dopamine okay so that's the main way\nthat MDMA and by extension\nmethamphetamine increase dopamine\nhowever MDMA is not just methamphetamine\nit's methylene dioxide methamphetamine\nand it has another incredible property\nwhich is that it doesn't just lead to\nhuge increases in dopamine it also leads\nto huge increases in serotonin and\nthat's because there are other neurons\nthat release serotonin and they have\nserotonin transporters which are\nsometimes called certs s-e-r-t-s's\nserotonin Transporters and they work\nvery much in the same way that dopamine\nTransporters do right they basically\ncontrol the sucking backup of Serotonin\nthat's been released into the synapse\nand that has not bound to serotonin\nreceptors on the other neurons yet and\nin doing so allow more serotonin to hang\nout and have its effects as those\nreceptors become available for serotonin\nto bind to them the other thing MDMA\ndoes is it also gets into the\npresynaptic neuron to impact the\npackaging of Serotonin into something\ncalled the vesicle monoamine transporter\nfor serotonin and in doing so it leads\nto a big buildup of serotonin in\npresynaptic Terminals and then massive\nincreases in serotonin release okay so\nwhat we've got with MDMA is a really\ninteresting compound unlike\nmethamphetamine or other amphetamines\nsuch as adderall Vyvanse Etc that cause\nincreases in dopamine by blocking\nreuptake and increasing release of\ndopamine MDMA does that but it also does\nthe same thing for serotonin and here's\na really key point\nthe increases in serotonin that MDMA\ncreates are at least three times and\nmaybe as much as eight times greater\nthan the amount of dopamine released\nthat MDMA causes but when you put those\ntwo things together what you basically\nhave is a drug that causes huge\nincreases in dopamine and even bigger\nincreases in serotonin\nand remember earlier when I said that\nMDMA is a purely synthetic compound as\nfar as we know it does not exist in any\nplants or fungus or anything else in\nnature well\nthis is a very unusual circumstance of\nhaving big increases in dopamine and big\nincreases in serotonin caused by the\nsame compound and that combination of\nbig increases in dopamine and big\nincreases in serotonin are what lead to\nthese highly unusual and yet what seem\nto be potentially clinically very\nbeneficial effects of having people feel\na lot of mood elevation and a lot of\nstimulation from the stimulant\nproperties of the methamphetamine\ncomponent and so that's the dopamine\neffect the dopaminergic tone goes way up\nso it's a stimulant people feel really\nalert they feel like talking a lot they\nfeel very excited they feel a lot of\npositive motivation these are classic\neffects of drugs that promote the\nrelease of dopamine including\namphetamine cocaine Etc but ordinarily\nthat's not such a good thing because\nwhat happens is there's then a crash in\nthe dopamine levels and then people feel\ndepressed they feel lethargic they they\ndon't feel good at all MDMA seems to\ncause these increases in dopamine and\nall the accompanying effects I just\ndescribed but by also causing big\nincreases in serotonin it activates\nneural networks that are associated with\nfeeling more socially connected in fact\nwe'll talk about data in a little bit\nwhere people have had their brains\nimaged while under the influence of MDMA\nand it's very clear that people who have\ntaken MDMA\nlook at faces that ordinarily they would\nrate as fearful and rate them as less\nfearful they see faces that are smiling\nand they rate those smiling happy faces\nas more positive than they would off the\ndrug the big increases in serotonin\ncreate what we call a pro-social effect\nand that combined with the dopaminergic\nincrease in mood and the stimulation\neffect creates this thing that we call\nan empathogen where and this is very\nimportant the empathy isn't just for\nother people it's also for oneself and\none's own experiences happening in the\nmoment as well as empathy for\nexperiences from the past which so you\ncan imagine could be very beneficial for\nthe treatment of PTSD Okay so\nhopefully the way I describe the biology\nof MDMA makes some sense if you didn't\nget anything out of the description I\nprovided except the understanding that\nMDMA is unusual in that it causes big\nincreases in dopamine and even bigger\nincreases in serotonin then you have\nmore in your knowledge base now about\nMDMA than you need in order to\nunderstand the rest of our discussion\nbefore we go any further I do want to\nseparate MDMA out from some other\ncompounds which are referred to as\npsychedelics and I recently did a\npodcast episode all about psilocybin and\nits therapeutic exploration and it's\nchemical basis Etc you can find that\nlike all episodes at hubermanlab.com I\nalso did an episode with expert guest Dr\nRobin Carhart Harris who's at University\nof California San Francisco who's\npioneering a lot of the studies on the\nclinical application of psilocybin\npsilocybin and LSD\nare mainly going to increase serotonin\nactivation in the brain in fact they\nvery closely resemble serotonin itself\nand they activate What's called the\n5ht2a or serotonin 5hd just stands for\nserotonin the 5ht 2A receptor to create\nvery mystical type experiences they are\nconsidered\nclassic psychedelics and are very\nintrospective\nand as I described in those episodes are\nbeing explored extensively now for the\ntreatment of major depression a\ndifferent compound that's being used for\nthe treatment of depression is ketamine\nI will do an entire episode all about\nketamine ketamine\nis actually a n methodaspartate receptor\nblocker nmda receptor blocker that\nshouldn't mean anything to most of you\nbut it is a dissociative anesthetic not\nunlike PCP what used to be called angel\ndust on the street ketamine is being\nused as a treatment for depression it is\ncurrently legal so unlike psilocybin and\nLSD which are granted breakthrough\nstatus for the study of depression but\nare not yet legal they are still illegal\nand of course as I mentioned earlier\nMDMA has breakthrough status but is\nstill illegal ketamine is being used for\nthe treatment of depression and it does\nso as its name suggests a dissociative\nanesthetic by creating a sense of\ndissociation from emotions okay now I\nraise this distinction between\npsilocybin and LSD which are mystical in\ntheir effects\nketamine which is dissociative in its\neffects with MDMA which is an empathogen\nor sometimes called an anactogen but as\nan empathogen or an enactogen it's\ncreating more affiliation it's\naffiliative okay so it's a very distinct\ncompound and I think this is important\nto understand because when we hear the\nword psychedelic a lot of people tend to\nlump together LSD psilocybin and MDMA if\nyou talk to researchers in these areas\nthey will tell you that MDMA really\nisn't that much of a psychedelic it's an\nempathogen with stimulant properties and\nit also has the serotonergic component\nthat makes it an empathogen or an\nactogen\nso MDMA is very different than the other\npsychedelics and my hunch is that over\nthe next few years we will stop talking\nabout MDMA as a psychedelic because it\ndoes not tend to produce visual\nhallucinations or auditory\nhallucinations of the sort that classic\npsychedelics do and in general it is\nmore of a mood impacting drug than it is\nMystical okay so we'll get into some of\nthe brain networks and which ones are\nactivated while under the influence of\nMDMA but I do think it's very important\nto segment out MDMA from the other\nso-called classic psychedelics and also\nsegment it out from ketamine thanks to\nsome really terrific studies both in\nanimal models and in humans We Now\nunderstand a lot of what makes MDMA\nproduce these incredibly unique effects\nand when I say unique I mean unique from\ndrugs like psilocybin and LSD and\nketamine and from methamphetamine for\nthat matter and it's really the\ncombination of big increases in dopamine\nand even bigger increases in serotonin\nthat create a situation where people\nhave more energy and yet\ndespite having more energy they don't\nfeel irritated\nthey feel a lot of pleasure they seem to\nwant to be in the state of having a lot\nof energy this will become important as\nwe talk about anxiety and the anxiety\nsymptoms of PTSD it also because of the\nbig increases in serotonin produces a\nsense of emotional warmth towards others\nand towards oneself that's the\nempathogen component and for reasons\nthat we still don't understand it seems\nto increase trust and the increases in\ntrust turn out to be vital because as\nyou will you will also learn later when\nwe look at the clinical trials exploring\nMDMA for the treatment of PTSD\nthe major effect of MDMA for the\ntreatment of PTSD is not to cure PTSD\nbut rather to make the therapy the talk\ntherapy for PTSD much more effective\nthis is a very important point in fact\nso important I'm going to repeat it at\nleast three times during today's episode\nMDMA taken on its own does not cure PTSD\nMDMA can augment or boost the effects of\ntalk therapy for PTSD and it does that\nthrough the engagement of specific\nneural circuits but before we talk about\nwhat those neural circuits are\nI want to emphasize that the increases\nin serotonin that MDMA produces\nseem to act on different receptors\nthen the big increases in serotonin the\nLSD and psilocybin produce so if you\nlisten to the episode that I did on\npsilocybin we haven't done yet one on\nLSD but the mechanisms are very similar\nfor psilocybin and LSD\nwhereby psilocybin and LSD\nvery closely mimic the molecule\nserotonin itself but seem to have a more\nselective activation of just the\nso-called serotonin 2A receptor\nabbreviated 5ht2a and that leads to\nmore interconnectedness between\ndifferent brain areas more consideration\nof new possibilities about events from\nthe past present and future and also the\nopening of so-called neuroplasticity of\nrewiring of neural connections that\npersist long after the psilocybin or LSD\neffects have worn off\nnow MDMA can activate the serotonin 2A\nreceptor but it seems that it largely\nactivates the serotonin 1B receptor now\nwhat does that mean activation of the\nserotonin 1B receptor seems to be what\ngives MDMA its very strong impact on the\nneural circuits of the brain that relate\nto trust and to social engagement not\njust the willingness to engage socially\nand to confide in a therapist or another\nperson but the intense desire to do so\nand when I say intense desire that takes\nus back to the dopamine system remember\ndopamine even though\nwhen increased in the brain can increase\nour mood\nit is largely responsible for increasing\nour sense of motivation and desire for\nsomething and to do something so the\nincrease in dopamine that's created by\nMDMA seems to make people\nwhat I call forward Center of mass you\nknow they want to do something they're\nvery motivated to do something and the\nincreases in serotonin acting on the\nserotonin 1B receptor\nseems to be what creates this desire to\nbond or create trust or to have a\ndiscussion of real things both things\nthat are positive but also to explore\nthings that are difficult and this I\nrealize is going to be a little bit of a\nmind Bend for people to to understand\nbut one of the key things that\nquality MDMA therapy consists of is not\njust having a very good rapport and\ncommunication with a therapist that's\nguiding the PTSD treatment\nbut also Rapport and a willingness to\nengage in conversations with oneself\nyeah I think that most of us can relate\nto the fact that we have experiences\nsome of which are hard some of which are\ngreat and everything in between trauma\nis I believe best defined by the words\nthat a former guest on this podcast\nwho's a world expert in trauma Paul\nConte explained as trauma is an event\nthat fundamentally changes the way that\nour brain works\nfor the worse okay so not every bad\nevent of our past is trauma\nbut events that change the way that we\nthink our emotional tone or our behavior\nin ways going forward that are not\nadaptive for us They don't serve us well\neither because they are highly\ndistracting or because\num they create anxiety or because they\ndisrupt sleep or any number of different\nthings that are maladaptive consequences\nthat's what really defines trauma and\nwhen under the influence of MDMA because\nof those parallel increases in dopamine\nand serotonin people seem far more\nwilling to both trust the therapists\nthat they're talking about that trauma\nwith but also to trust their own ability\nto quote unquote go internal and think\nabout the challenging thing or things\nbecause oftentimes trauma can consist of\nmany events not just one event and the\nthought patterns around that and the\ncontext around that and therein to be\nable to explore new possibilities to\nessentially rewire their relationship to\nthat trauma so I promise that a little\nbit later we'll talk about the the\ndirect application of MDMA for the\ntreatment of PTSD but now I'd like to\nshift off of the chemical changes that\nMDMA produces and some of the subjective\nchanges these increases in trust and\npleasure and energy and emotional warmth\nto some of the brain circuits that are\nactivated and Modified by MDMA use and\nthen we will explore the toxicity issue\nand then we will explore the clinical\nstudies of which I can promise you are\nextremely exciting but until we\nunderstand the neural circuit phenomena\nand of course until we consider the\nneurotoxicity issues I don't think those\nclinical findings can be appreciated in\ntheir full value but now I'd like to\ntalk about what MDMA really does in the\nbrain both in the short term while\nsomeone is under the influence of the\ndrug and in the long term what sorts of\nneuroplastic or rewiring changes does\nMDMA produce and how can those be\nbeneficial or perhaps not beneficial I'd\nlike to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag-1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your foundational\nnutritional needs I've been taking\nathletic green since 2012 so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be in the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 so in\norder to understand what MDMA does to\nthe human brain we need to take a step\nback and really Define the sorts of\nexperiments that one could do so for\ninstance you could take a person who's\nnever ingested MDMA and put them into an\nfmri machine which is functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging put them into\nthe fmri machine and just have them sit\nthere with their eyes closed what we\nwould call resting functional\nconnectivity\nor arresting State functional\nconnectivity and simply look at how\ninterconnected certain brain areas are\nwhich brain areas are active which brain\nareas are less active at rest this is an\nimportant thing to do not just to\nprovide a baseline for understanding\nwhat the drug MDMA will subsequently do\nbut also because it addresses What's\ncalled the default mode Network the\ndefault mode Network or dmn is the\nnetwork that is active in our brains\nwhen we aren't really attending to\nanything specific outside us and we're\nnot trying to think about anything\nspecific or accomplish anything specific\nit actually relates to our sense of\nimagination and daydreaming it has a lot\nto do with our self-referencing you know\nwhat we're thinking about ourselves this\nmay come as no surprise but if you're\njust sitting there on the bus or you\nknow around the dinner table and you're\nnot paying attention to what's going on\nin large part your brain is in this\ndefault mode Network and you're thinking\nabout yourself okay so we can get a\nsense of what the default mode Network\nactivation is we can get a sense of\nwhich brain areas are more or less\nactive simply by putting somebody into\nan fmri machine\nthen of course you could give somebody\nMDMA while they are in the fmri machine\nand see how the activation of different\nbrain networks changes and then of\ncourse you could analyze how the default\nmode networks and other brain networks\nchange in the days and weeks and even\nyears after the drug has worn off\nso-called neuroplasticity effects what\nchanged in a permanent or pervasive way\nokay so that's sort of one basic\nParadigm for exploring the effects of\ndrugs like MDMA on the brain the other\nway that you can explore the effects of\nMDMA on the brain is to ask people in\nthe general population hey who out there\nis taking MDMA how many times have you\ntaken it and come on into the laboratory\nand we will image your brain and compare\npeople who have for instance taken MDMA\nzero times to people who have taken MDMA\none time or five times or believe it or\nnot there's some studies sitting right\nhere in front of me on my desk of people\nwho have taken MDMA more than 200 times\nand ask the same sorts of questions\nwhich brain areas are more or less\nactive those Studies have been done as\nwell and of course one can do studies\nwhere you give people different dosages\nof MDMA as well as giving people MDMA\nand then giving them specific stimuli\nmeaning not just asking them to sit\nthere in the fmri scanner with eyes\nclosed looking at the resting state\nfunctional connectivity\nbut also how the brain responds to the\npresentation of happy faces or sad faces\nor images of oneself or even images that\nrecall memories of traumatic events and\nso on so fortunately all of those sorts\nof Studies have been done in humans and\nthere are also a large number of studies\nin animal models exploring how the\nsocial activity of laboratory mice\nchanges when they are under the effects\nof MDMA or even studies believe it or\nnot on the effects of MDMA encephalopods\ncephalopods include octopuses as well as\ncuttlefish and other Aquatic animals\nthat are known for having complex\nBehavior some people believe that the\ncephalopods are extremely intelligent\nyou know the obsession with cephalopods\nis something that really intrigues me I\nactually used to have cuttlefish in my\nlaboratory we did not put them on MDMA\nbut there is a study that's been\npublished in the journal current biology\nit's a cell Press Journal excellent\nJournal this is from Google Dolan's\nlaboratory at Johns Hopkins school of\nmedicine showing that if you give\noctopuses MDMA they like to spend more\ntime with other octopuses than they do\nif they are not on MDMA and that might\nsound like kind of a um kind of a\nplayful experiment just done uh in order\nto entertain oneself and the octopuses\nperhaps but actually in that study they\nidentified the serotonin transporter in\noctopuses and show that it has a lot of\nhomology similarity to human serotonin\ntransporter receptors and so what that\nreally speaks to is the fact that the\npro-social effects of MDMA that are\nobserved in mice and in humans and in\noctopuses all have a common basis which\nis the activation of more serotonin\nrelease in particular brain networks\nokay so that interesting study on\noctopuses aside I think what most of us\nare interested in is how MDMA impacts\nthe brain and so I'm going to spell out\nthe three major ways in which MDMA\nchanges the activation of the brain in\nthe short and long term and here I'm\npooling across a number of different\nstudies but one of the key sets of\nstudies in this area comes from the what\nI consider very beautiful work of\nHarriet DeWitt Harriet DeWitt runs the\nhuman behavioral pharmacology lab in the\ndepartment of Psychiatry and behavioral\nneuroscience at the University of\nChicago in her laboratory has a long\nhistory of giving people certain drugs\nin very specific dosages and then\nmeasuring their effects on the brain\nusing different types of Imaging\nincluding fmri\nand one particular study that I'll\nhighlight is entitled effects of MDMA on\nsociability and neural responses to\nsocial threat and social reward so what\nthe study looked at is how MDMA impacts\npeople's perceptions of others emotional\nExpressions on their face what they\nfound is that when people are on MDMA\ntheir response to threatening faces or\nother threatening stimuli is reduced and\nit's reduced in a very specific way\nwhich is reductions in activity of the\namygdala the amygdala is a structure\nthat some of you may be familiar with it\nis known to be involved in the threat\ndetection systems or networks of the\nbrain it is sometimes called the fear\narea of the brain although I want to\ncaution people against assigning any one\nparticular subjective experience to any\none particular brain area the amygdala\nis actually a complex it's actually\ncalled the amygdaloid complex and has a\nlot of different sub areas and it's\ninvolved in a lot of things besides fear\nand threat detection nonetheless when\npeople are under the influence of MDMA\nand you show them a face that is\ngrimacing or would otherwise be rated as\nquite threatening they tend to rate it\nas less threatening in addition they\ntend to respond to happy faces or even\nslightly happy faces as more\nkind or more generous or happier than\nthey would when they are not on MDMA\nagain the faces that are being shown are\nnot of people on MDMA that would be an\ninteresting experiment but that's not\nwhat they did here what's Happening Here\nis people are being given MDMA and then\nthey are raiding in a subjective way the\nfriendliness or the level of threat that\nthey detect in these facial expressions\nand of course they have extremes of\nfriendly and threatening but then they\nalso grade them right they titrate them\nso that they also have mildly\nthreatening and mildly happy faces Etc\nso everything from a grin to a smirk to\na giant smile everything from a from a\nsort of a you know somebody looking a\nlittle bit of scans at somebody to\nreally you know wide-eyed and looking\nangry like they're you know gonna attack\nyou and things of that sort so what's\ndiscovered in the study is that MDMA has\na bi-directional effect on our\nperception of others emotions making\npeople more likely to rate something as\npositive if it's initially positive or\neven a little bit positive and less\nlikely to rate a threatening face as\nmore threatening now one thing I have\nnot mentioned thus far are the dosages\nof MDMA used in this and in other\nstudies unfortunately despite the\nstudies that we're going to talk about\nusing a lot of different types of people\ndifferent ages different Sexes so male\nand female located in different parts of\nthe world even some with PTSD some not\nwith PTSD Etc there's been fairly tight\ndosage control of MDMA in these studies\nit's not perfectly matched from study to\nstudy but it's pretty darn close which\nmakes interpreting results across\nstudies a lot easier for me and\ntherefore for you\nthe typical dosages of MDMA used in\nthese neuroimaging studies and in the\nclinical studies of PTSD that we're\ngoing to talk about later\nrange anywhere from 0.75 milligrams per\nkilogram of body weight to 1.5\nmilligrams per kilogram of body weight\nso for somebody like me I weigh 220\npounds that's 100 milligrams\n1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body\nweight would therefore be 150 milligrams\nin a single dose okay\na dosage of one milligram per kilogram\nof body weight would mean 100 milligrams\nfor my 100 kilograms okay somebody\nlighter than 100 kilograms would\nobviously take less MDMA in one of these\nstudies but in general the range of MDMA\nthat's been explored is 0.75 to 1.5\nmilligrams per kilogram of body weight\nthe exception being in the clinical\nstudies that we'll talk about a little\nbit later there's a tendency to explore\nboth an initial dose of 1.5 milligrams\nper kilogram of body weight so again for\na hundred kilogram person that would be\n150 milligrams or so and then a\nso-called booster of half that amount\nabout 90 minutes to two and a half hours\ninto the session so another 75\nmilligrams later and I should point out\nthat there is not always the inclusion\nof the so-called booster and in some\ncases lower doses of MDMA such as the\n0.75 milligrams per kilogram dosages are\nused why am I getting so into the\ndetails of dosages well\nif we are going to talk about toxicity\nof MDMA we absolutely have to talk about\ndosages because\nlike any drug the toxicity of MDMA does\nscale with the dosage that's applied not\njust the frequency of MDMA use\nwe hear a lot about that you know\nsomeone has taken MDMA one time or four\ntimes or 200 times we hear about\nfrequency of use but rarely do we hear\nabout the specific dosages that are\ntaken in any one particular session so\nwhen we talk about the subjective\neffects or the brain networks that are\nactivated when people take MDMA in\ngeneral we're talking about\ndosages somewhere between 0.75\nmilligrams per kilogram of body weight\nand 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body\nweight although typically you're going\nto see studies both clinical and more\nresearch explorative using anywhere from\n1 to 1.5 milligrams of MDMA per kilogram\nof body weight so that's important to\nhighlight I told you about the\nsubjective effects of MDMA engaging the\nresponses of people's faces but I didn't\ntell you about the brain areas that are\nresponsible except for the reduction in\namygdala activity now one of the key\nfeatures of PTSD seems to be that there\nis a heightened connectivity between the\namygdala and a brain area called the\ninsula the insula is a brain area that's\nvery important for something that's\ncalled interoception\ninteroception is one's perception of our\nfeelings both pure Sensations but also\nour emotional states and our feelings of\nwell-being or lack of well-being for\neverything from our skin inward okay so\nthat's interoception you actually can\nintercept now even though you're always\nintercepting a little bit you can\nintercept now to a great degree if you\nwere to for instance close your eyes or\nsimply focus on the contact points\nbetween your body and any surface that\nyou happen to be contacting so maybe the\nbacks of your legs against a chair or\nyour feet against the floor or the\nbottoms of your shoes or sandals your\nnervous system is constantly sensing\nthose contact points but normally\nthey're not under your conscious\nawareness unless you direct Your\ninterceptive Capacity to them which is\njust fancy nerd speak for saying you\nnormally don't notice what's going on\nfrom your skin inward unless you focus\non it that focus is interception\nit can be about the fullness of your gut\nit can be about how happy or sad you are\nit can be about how tired or alert you\nhappen to feel but that's interception\nand it is distinctly different from\nexteriorception which is your ability\nand tendency to focus on things beyond\nthe confines of your skin so this could\nbe visual attention auditory attention\nit could be paying attention to events\nlike birds flying by whether or not your\nUber is showing up these kinds of things\nand we are always in a balance a\npush-pull of interoception and extra\nreception the insula is a brain area\nthat is absolutely critical for\ninterception so much so that it has a\nmap of the complete body surface\nincluding our internal organs\nin other words if you put somebody into\nan fmri machine or you were to record\nfrom the insula with electrodes as has\nbeen done in humans many times now\nduring the course of neurosurgery for\nother purposes what you would find is\nthat if you stimulate neurons in one end\nof the insula the person will say oh you\nknow I I feel something going on in my\ngut and on my left side and then as you\nwere to March that stimulation across\nthe insula you would find that they\nwould now be paying attention to their\nlegs or just to one leg or to their\nwhole body or to the sensations in their\nface or their head so there's a\nsystematic map of interoception in the\ninsula and there are direct connections\nbetween the amygdala and the insula and\nthe amygdala despite getting this\nreputation as just being a fear Center\nor a threat detection Center is actually\npart of a much larger set of networks\nthat include inputs from the hippocampus\nan area of the brain that's involved in\nmemory formation and Storage\nand what is observed is that people who\nhave PTSD tend to have greater or rather\nstronger connections between the\namygdala and the insula than is normally\nobserved in people who do not have PTSD\nokay so there seems to be heightened\ninput from the threat detection centers\nof the brain to this area of the brain\nthe insula that is responsible for our\nsense of interception which provides a\nlogical explanation for why people with\nPTSD often will feel the memory or sense\nthe discomfort or just feel agitation or\neven other types of bodily Sensations\nlike back pain or just perhaps just a\nsense within their body that's more\ngeneralized it doesn't even have to be\npain doesn't even have to be negative\nbut that's associated with the negative\nmemory of some traumatic event or series\nof events okay so this is a really\ninteresting brain Network that I should\nmention exists in everybody but that in\npeople with PTSD seems to have\nheightened connectivity and those brain\nnetworks can be revealed by putting\npeople with PTSD into functional Imaging\nmachines\ngetting them to recall a traumatic event\nor even looking at the resting state of\nconnectivity between the amygdala and\nthe insula so those experiments have\nbeen done and what's also been done is\nto give people 1.5 milligrams per\nkilogram of MDMA and to look at the\nconnectivity between the amygdala and\nthe insula and between the hippocampus\nthe amygdala and the insula and so\nwhat's observed over time in people that\nhave been given MDMA and this is a very\nimportant\nand and have done therapy for PTSD both\nbefore during and after\nthe drug there's a weakening of\nconnections between the amygdala and the\ninsula and that scales very directly\nwith the relief of symptoms from PTSD so\nthis is really exciting because it's one\nthing to see a brain Network get\nactivated or inactivated or you say okay\nin one person a certain connection\nbetween threat centers and the\ninterceptive centers of the brain was\nlet's say arbitrary units let's say it\nwas level eight out of ten for that\nperson right these things are normalized\nfor a particular person and then after\ntaking MDMA and doing PTSD therapy it\nwas five out of ten or four out of ten\nthat's a good experiment but what's far\nmore powerful is to observe that in that\npatient or that person and then to see a\nchange that's perhaps less dramatic so a\nshift from 8 out of 10 to 7 out of ten\nin another person and to see less shift\nin brain connectivity in the same\nnetwork and then perhaps in the person\nthat went from full-blown PT PSD to full\nremission of PTSD something that believe\nit or not has been observed in single\nsessions with MDMA\nif that person demonstrates an even\ngreater reduction in the connections\nbetween the amygdala and the incilla\nwell then that gives even more\nconfidence that this connection between\nthe amygdala and the insula is actually\nperhaps causally related to the\nreduction in symptoms of PTSD or even if\nit's just correlated with reduction in\nsymptoms of PTSD the fact that the\ndegree of reduction of connection of\nthis circuit scales with the reduction\nin clinically relevant symptoms that's a\nvery powerful finding because it moves\nthings away from Pure correlation\nalthough this brain area is active or\nless active over time and you know this\nperson has more or fewer symptoms of\nPTSD to something that starts to look\nlike a mechanistic and logical framework\nfor understanding\nPTSD as well as the effects of MDMA and\nfor understanding how changes in the\nbrain underlie relief from PTSD okay so\nagain even if you just could grasp the\nidea that you have a brain area the\namygdala that's involved in threat\ndetection and it provides inputs to\nanother brain area called the insula\nwhich is involved in this thing called\ninteroception and that reductions in\nthose connections between the amygdala\nand the insula scale with or correlate\nwith reductions in PTSD symptoms as a\nconsequence of people taking MDMA so if\nyou have that under your mental belt I\npromise you you understand far more\nabout how MDMA impacts the brain in the\nshort and long term the 99.9 percent of\npeople out there\nhowever it's also important you\nunderstand a few other things that MDMA\ndoes to the brain as well as what it\ndoesn't do to the brain first of all\nclassic psychedelics like psilocybin and\nLSD as I mentioned earlier are known to\ncreate more lateral connectivity between\ndifferent areas of the so-called\nneocortex and these are long-lasting\nchanges that are thought to underlie\nboth some of the relief from major\ndepression but also some of the enhanced\ncreativity and some of the other things\nthat have been observed with psilocybin\ntreatment and again if you're interested\nin psilocybin treatments and psilocybin\nitself please check out the episode that\nI did on psilocybin and the guest\nepisode with Dr Robin Carhartt Harris\nthose episodes like all other episodes\nof The huberman Lab podcast can be found\nat hubermanlab.com it's a fully\nsearchable site so you can put keywords\ninto the search function it will take\nyou to specific time stamps every\nepisode is time stamps you can navigate\nto topics of particular interest to you\nfeel free to go there and listen to\nthose episodes about psilocybin MDMA by\ncontrast does not seem to produce long\nlasting increases in lateral\nconnectivity between those same brain\nnetworks probably because it impacts a\ndifferent serotonin receptors it does\nhowever seem to change resting state\nfunctional connectivity Within These\nlimbic structures like the amygdala and\nrelated structures that are associated\nwith threat detection now this is\ninteresting and it actually was\nhighlighted very nicely in a study I'll\nprovide a link to in our show note\ncaption which actually has Dr Robin\nCarter Harris as the first author so not\nonly has he done incredible work on\npsilocybin and LSD and DMT in Ayahuasca\nin his laboratory but also on MDMA and\nthe particular study I have in mind here\nshowed that people who take MDMA\nat more or less the dosage that we\ntalked about earlier\nreport Mark increases in positive mood\nas well as decreased blood flow to the\namygdala and hippocampus so again these\nthreat detection centers of the brain\nand brain areas associated with\nmemory and those changes are seen both\nwhile under the influence of MDMA and\nafterwards when the brain is simply at\nrest so it really does appear that MDMA\ncreates neuroplasticity that changes the\noverall level of activation of these\nthreat detection networks and their\nconnections to memory systems in a way\nthat's pervasive over time and that\ndoesn't require any particular probe\nwith a negative\nstimulus I'll translate to English what\nthat means is that during the MDMA\nsession\npeople report feeling less threatened\nmore pro-social towards others more\nempathic towards others and themselves\nand then after the session they have\nless of a threat response to memories\nthat before the session were more\ntroubling and those changes in the brain\ndo seem to be pervasive so there are\nboth short-term and long-term effects of\nMDMA all of which point in the direction\nof lowered levels of threat detection\nheightened levels of positivity\npro-social components of the brain more\nactive threat detection centers of the\nbrain less active now earlier we talked\nabout MDMA as a drug that potently\nincreases dopamine and even more\npotently increases serotonin largely\nacting through this serotonin 1B\nreceptor now without getting into too\nmany more details before moving on to\nissues of toxicity around MDMA I do want\nto touch on what I think is perhaps the\nfinest of the animal model studies of\nMDMA that explored which brain networks\nand\nwhich chemical that is serotonin or\ndopamine is responsible for say the\nmotivational components of MDMA versus\nthe pro-social effects of MDMA and then\nit also raises a really important point\nwhich I haven't mentioned yet in this\nepisode which is the role of oxytocin\nsomething that many of you have perhaps\nheard of\nthe paper that I'm going to describe is\nfrom the laboratory of Dr Robert malenka\nhe's a colleague of mine at Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine Psychiatry\nand Behavioral Sciences\nhe is both a Pioneer and luminary in the\nfield of neuroplasticity of how the\nbrain wires and forms memories and can\nchange itself over time in response to\nexperience as well as the study of drugs\nof abuse as well as the study of drugs\nlike MDMA and now additional compounds\nthat can provide therapeutic support in\ncertain conditions the study which I\nwill provide a link to in the show note\ncaption is entitled distinct neural\nmechanisms for the pro-social and\nrewarding properties of MDMA and I'm\njust going to summarize the major\nresults of this study it's a study that\nwas done on mice and I realized that a\nlot of people will hear that and think\nah what relevance does that have to\nhumans but when thinking about the\neffects of dopamine and serotonin in the\ntypes of circuits that we've been\ntalking about thus far\nthese circuits that are subcortical as\nwe refer to them so these are limbic\ncircuits these are hypothalamic circuits\nthese are what are called mesolymbic\ncircuits these are all names for\ncircuits that are highly conserved\nbetween mice and humans\nand so results in mice really do\ntranslate quite well to results in\nhumans at least insofar as the effects\nof MDMA and which neurochemicals are\ninvolved is concerned so what they found\nin the study using a huge array of\nbeautiful techniques such as\ninactivation of specific brain areas\nactivation of specific brain areas drug\nantagonists to prevent oxytocin function\nor drug antagonist to prevent specific\nreceptors involved in the serotonin\npathway lots and lots of tools in their\ntoolkit what they found is that MDMA\ncausing the release of dopamine\nis what really establishes the rewarding\neffects of an experience this isn't\nreally a surprise\nwe've known that MDMA just like cocaine\nor Methamphetamine or Adderall for that\nmatter or Vyvanse for that matter\ncreates big increases in dopamine that\ntend to couple an experience with a\nsense of reward\nand lead to changes in the neural\ncircuitry that make the animal or human\nmore likely to seek out that same\nexperience again okay these are the\nrewarding or sometimes called\nreinforcing properties of dopamine that\ntake place in the so-called mesolimbic\nreward pathway if you want to learn\nabout mesolimic reward Pathways and\ndopamine and how they control everything\nfrom your level of motivation to your\ntendency to procrastinate or overcome\nprocrastination I've done two episodes\nabout dopamine you can simply go to\nhubermanlab.com put dopamine into the\nsearch function and you'll find at least\ntwo episodes on that topic and you'll\nalso find a number of different tools\nrelated to how one can better regulate\ntheir own patterns of dopamine release\nfor sake of motivation Etc\nso MDMA is increasing dopamine to\nincrease reward to a particular\nexperience what's the experience well\nthis paper beautifully parses\nthe fact that it is serotonin release\nwithin a structure called the nucleus\naccumbens which is part of the reward\npathway which is rewarding the\nexperience of social interaction now\nthey do this by putting mice in arenas\nwhere they have the option of either\nspending time with other mice or not\nspending time with other mice and\nblocking the activation of certain brain\nareas and again using drug antagonists\nEtc and what they find is that it really\nis the activation of the serotonin 1B\nreceptor\nin the nucleus of Commons by MDMA that\nleads to this pro-social effect of MDMA\nso that's really nice to know because\nthere's always been this conundrum of\nokay psilocybin and LSD are basically\nlike serotonin they activate the\nserotonin 2A receptor MDMA has this huge\nserotonergic component tons of Serotonin\nreleased when one takes MDMA but very\ndifferent effects in the short and long\nterm\nvery different subjective effects very\ndifferent patterns of change activity in\nthe brain in the short and long term\nwell that's because MDMA is activating\nthe serotonin-1b receptor not the\nserotonin 2A receptor and it's doing so\nin a completely different set of brain\nnetworks as is LSD and psilocybin so\nwhat happens when an animal or a person\ntakes MDMA is that social connection is\nstrongly rewarded and reinforced making\nsocial connection more likely after the\ndrug wears off\nnow that's one component of social\nconnection but in addition\npeople who take MDMA in the clinical\ntherapeutic setting for the treatment of\nPTSD often report feeling more empathy\nand compassion for themselves during the\nsession but also for long periods of\ntime maybe even indefinitely after the\nsession\nso it really seems that the addition of\nthis huge release of Serotonin by MDMA\non top of the release of dopamine sets\nin motion two parallel circuits one for\nrewarding something anything that's the\ndopamine component and then fortunately\nbecause the increase in serotonin caused\nby MDMA\nincreases empathy and sociability for\nand with others but also for oneself\nthe motivation that's reinforced that's\nwired into the brain seems to be a\nmotivation to perceive others as more\nkind but also to be kinder to oneself\nnow I realize that for some of you who\nare listening to this you're probably\nsaying well of course right you know\nserotonin is pro-social and dopamine is\nmotivation so you put the two together\nand people become more motivated to be\nsocial and kinder to themselves ah but\nit didn't necessarily have to be that\nway right it is very hard to go from a\nstatement like drug a produces effects b\nc and d to neurochemicals b c and d\ncause motivation and sociability and\ntherefore when you take that drug you're\ngoing to get all of that stuff in fact\nwe have to go back to our understanding\nthe MDMA despite causing a big increase\nin serotonin also causes huge increases\nin dopamine and it does so with this\nmolecule that is methamphetamine now\nmethamphetamine is not known to be a\npro-social drug in fact a study I just\nreferred to as well as some human\nStudies have explored how the\napplication of methamphetamine so not\nMDMA but pure methamphetamine impacts\nsocial interactions and what it does to\nsocial interactions it's very profound\nit dramatically reduces one's tendency\nto engage in social interaction so this\nreally speaks to the poly pharmacology\nas it's called of MDMA the fact that\nserotonin and dopamine are released\ntogether has distinctly different\neffects than if just dopamine or just\nserotonin is increased so much so that\nit's worth taking a step back and\ntalking about another class of drugs\nwhich dramatically increases serotonin\nwhich are the ssris The Selective\nserotonin reuptake Inhibitors ssris such\nas fluoxetine Prozac as well as Zoloft\nand of course there are many other\naccessories out there citalopram Etc\nthey block the reuptake of Serotonin and\nthereby lead to net increases in the\namount of Serotonin and yet those drugs\nare not known to create\neven close to the same sorts of effects\nas MDMA\nin fact there have been human and animal\nstudies showing that if you give\nsomebody an SSRI prior to them taking\nMDMA you actually block the pro-social\nand empathogenic effects of MDMA now you\nmight say why in the world would that be\naren't these drugs just increasing\nserotonin and the increase in serotonin\nis pro-social ETC ah well that speaks to\nthe complexity of all this poly\npharmacology and the fact that it's\nreally the activation of Serotonin at\nparticular receptors in this case the\nserotonin 1B receptor in particular\nbrain areas in this case the nucleus\naccumbens a brain area associated with\nmotivation and reward\nthat largely explains the effects of\nMDMA in making people and animals and\noctopuses included for that matter more\npro-social and more empathic towards\nthemselves\nit's not just an issue of raising the\nlevels of one neurochemical it's really\nabout raising levels of a particular\nneurochemical acting in particular\nreceptors in particular brain areas and\nin the case of MDMA the fact that\nthere's also dopamine increased in those\nvery same brain areas right I don't\nthink I mentioned this before but the\nnucleus accumbens is part of that\nmesolimbic reward pathway that is\nessentially establishing a reward for\nwhatever is happening at the moment\nso the way to conceptualize MDMA and its\neffects on the brain both subjectively\nand mechanistically is that it's an\nempathogen for which empathy and social\nconnection is very strongly reinforced\nwhile under the influence of the drug\nand in a way so intense and Powerful\nthat those neural networks get stronger\nand persist in being more active for\nlong periods of time after the drug has\nworn off I'd like to just take a brief\nbreak and thank one of our sponsors\nwhich is element element is an\nelectrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you

now one\nof the things that's been explored in\nboth the animal literature and the human\nliterature is that MDMA doesn't just\nincrease dopamine and doesn't just\nincrease serotonin but it also\nprofoundly increases levels of oxytocin\nrelease in the brain now oxytocin is\nconsidered what's called a neuro hormone\nbecause it acts as both a\nneurotransmitter or I guess if we were\ngoing to be really specific we'd say a\nneuromodulator because it tends to\nmodulate the activity of a bunch of\nother circuits and a hormone how can we\nsay it's a hormone or a modulator or\ntransmitter well hormonal effects tend\nto be effects that act not just locally\nbut on many sites within the brain and\nbody as well and oxytocin is known to do\nthat as well as to work locally so\nthat's why we call a neuro hormone it\nactivates neurons and is associated with\nneural networks related to pair bonding\nboth between parent and child both\nmother and child and father and child or\ncaretaker and child not just biological\nparent\nas well as bonding between friends\nbonding between lovers and it's thought\nto actually be involved in the process\nthat is the painful process of breaking\nof bonds when people are no longer\navailable to us as caretakers or as\npartners either by way of breakup death\ndeparture Etc in fact there are even\ndata suggesting that humans can have\nstrong oxytocin responses to their pets\nin particular dogs and their dogs can\nhave strong oxytocin\npatterns of release in response to their\nowners I think for any dog lovers or dog\nowners certainly includes me I'm raising\nmy hand\nthat comes as no surprise anyone that's\never had to put down a dog or has lost a\ndog and hear no disrespect to the cat\nowners but I'm just referring to the\nstudies that have been done on humans\nand dogs\nyou can certainly relate to the\nincredible pain of that loss oxytocin is\nthought to be involved in bonding\nbetween people and other creatures as\nwell as the breaking of those bonds\nMDMA is known to powerfully increase\noxytocin release in fact there's a\nreally nice study on this done in humans\nthis is a study I'll provide a link to\nin the show note captions entitled\nplasma oxytocin concentrations following\nMDMA or intranasal oxytocin in humans\nnowadays oxytocin is available by nasal\ninhaler\nto be honest I don't know the legality\naround it I don't know if it's a gray\nMarket or but what I'm about to tell you\nwill basically discourage you from\nwanting to take it because what they\nfound in the study was\npeople given either 0.75 or 1.5\nmilligrams per kilogram of body weight\nof MDMA experienced increases in\noxytocin however it was only the group\nthat took 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of\nbody weight of MDMA that experienced the\nreally big significant changes in\noxytocin and when I say really big\nreally highly statistically significant\nwhat they observed is that in the\nplacebo group\nbecause of course they include a placebo\ngroup the amount of circulating oxytocin\nwas 18.6 picograms per milliliter which\nto you probably means nothing and to me\nalso sort of means nothing because those\nunits of oxytocin can't be directly\nrelated to any kind of direct experience\nof feeling bonded or not bonded that's\njust a number but nonetheless it\nprovides a baseline to compare to the\naverage levels of oxytocin in the\nbloodstream of people that were given\n1.5 milligrams per kilogram of MDMA\nwhich is 83.7 picograms per milliliter\nthat equates to nearly a five-fold\nincrease in the amount of circulating\noxytocin when people are under the\ninfluence of MDMA\nnow this study had a bunch of different\nconditions not just MDMA of different\ndoses not just placebo\nthey also had people take oxytocin by\nnasal spray which we know can change\nlevels of circulating oxytocin and\nindeed when measured in the study it did\nchange levels of circulating oxytocin\nand the end point in the study was to\nhave people\ngive subjective ratings of their\nfeelings of\nconnectedness to one another as well as\nrate and here I'm just drawing directly\nfrom the paper of how much they like the\nfeeling how much they felt high they\nmeasure their heart rate their systolic\npressure their diastolic blood pressure\nEtc and they looked at how\nsocial people felt they looked at how\ninsightful people felt and the key\ntakeaway from the study for sake of our\ndiscussion here today is that it does\nnot again it does not appear that the\nincreases in oxytocin produced by taking\nMDMA\nare the source of the pro-social effects\nof MDMA\nand that's also what was found in the\nanimal studies of MDMA where in those\nstudies\nmice were given MDMA at comparable doses\nthe doses were a little bit higher than\nused in the human studies but at\ncomparable doses\nbig increases in oxytocin were observed\nincreases in sociability\nof those mice were observed just as they\nare in humans that take MDMA but in\nthose mice they were also given a drug\nto block the oxytocin receptor and lo\nand behold no changes in sociability\nwere observed\nin humans that take oxytocin by nasal\nspray\nyou can see big increases in oxytocin\nthat's not surprising gets across the\nblood-brain barrier oxytocin goes up\nand levels of sociability do not\nincrease\nso what this points to is a situation\nwhere MDMA is increasing dopamine to\nincrease motivation and to reward\nsomething what gets rewarded well what\ngets rewarded is the serotonin\nactivation of particular brain networks\nassociated with sociability and the\ndramatic increases in oxytocin that are\nvery very real when people take MDMA do\nnot appear to underlie any of the known\nshort or long-term subjective effects of\nMDMA now a conclusion like that needs to\nhave a caveat and the caveat is that as\nfar as we know the big increases in\noxytocin that are produced by MDMA\naren't doing anything for the sorts of\neffects that we've been talking about\nhere sociability empathy Etc but there\ncould be other effects of oxytocin that\nwe're just not aware of that said the\ndata from both animal models and in\nhumans really point to the fact that the\nincreases in oxytocin that are produced\nby MDMA are not directly related to any\nof the short and long-term effects of\nMDMA that we are most familiar with\nnamely motivation sociability increase\nempathy or the long-standing changes in\nneural circuitry that underlie for\ninstance reduce threat detection or\nreduce connectivity between threats\ndetection centers of the brain and in\nterreception so is the big increase in\noxytocin produced by MDMA completely\nirrelevant in the context of this\ndiscussion we don't know it appears that\nit's not very relevant is oxytocin a\nmeaningless molecule right after all\nthey gave these people nasal infusions\nof oxytocin oxytocin and went way up\nthey didn't observe anything very\ninteresting or significant in the\ncontext of sociability but we do know\nthat oxytocin can play a powerful role\nin pair bonding and in human human\nanimal bonding of various kinds from\nother experiments that have been done so\nI don't want to diminish the incredible\npower that oxytocin has in our brains\nand bodies but it doesn't appear that\nthe MDMA induced increases in oxytocin\nwhich are enormous have much to do with\nanything related to the value of MDMA as\na treatment for PTSD or for its\nsubjective effects on empathy\nsociability or any of those other\nfactors either now perhaps the one\ncaveat to that is that hair Harriet\nDewitt's laboratory which I referred to\nearlier has looked at how variations in\noxytocin receptor genes vary between\npeople so it turns out that some people\nhave an allele a basically a version of\nthe oxytocin receptor that is different\nfrom other people that makes oxytocin\nwork differently and actually less\neffectively in activating certain brain\nnetworks and it does appear that when\nthose people take MDMA they actually it\nexperience less of a pro-social effect\nof the drug now that spits in the face\nof everything I just said about oxytocin\nnot being involved in the effects of\nMDMA on pro-sociability and empathy\nI think the bulk of the data really\npoints to the fact that it's the\nserotonin increases combined with the\ndopamine increases caused by MDMA that\nlead to most of the understood effects\nand that oxytocin if it's playing a role\nis going to play a more minor role let's\ntalk about the safety and potential\nneurotoxicity of MDMA and here I really\nwant to highlight that our discussion\ntoday is couched in a discussion about\nthe application of pure MDMA to animals\nor humans in the context of laboratory\nor clinical studies this is really\nimportant to point out because I would\nbe remiss if I didn't note that\nthere is a lot of recreational use of\nMDMA in fact it was the recreational use\nof MDMA in the 1980s but really that\ntook off even exploded in the 1990s with\nso-called Rave culture that created the\nmassive attention on illegality of MDMA\nand put the drug enforcement agencies\nonto MDMA as a drug that they wanted to\nand indeed do restrict in fact just\ntoday in anticipation of this episode I\nput MDMA into the search function on\nGoogle and clicked news and there were\nat least two reports of major MDMA\nseizures and bus so again I want to\nhighlight the fact that MDMA is still\nillegal to possess or sell and certainly\nto traffic I also want to highlight the\nfact that nowadays all recreational\ndrugs but certainly MDMA included\nare often in fact very often\ncontaminated with fentanyl and while\nfentanyl has certain clinical uses\nfentanyl is highly deadly the current\nestimates are as much as 60 percent\nmaybe even 80 percent of drugs that are\nsold on the gray Market are being\nrepackaged or reformulated with fentanyl\nand there have been a lot of fentanyl\nrelated deaths both in kids and adults\nso the sourcing of MDMA is extremely\nimportant and the safety issues simply\ncannot be overlooked\nand I say that not to protect me I say\nthat to protect you right the last thing\nany of us want is for someone to take a\ncompound thinking it's one compound and\nit contains another compound and I'm\ngetting hurt or even dying and that is\nhappening a lot a lot and it is\ncertainly happening a lot for people\nthat think that they're buying MDMA\nthe use of MDMA in the laboratory or in\nthe clinical setting\nwith pure MDMA has also been explored\nfor the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA\nso how would methamphetamine and MDMA be\nneurotoxic well that's because they\nincrease dopamine in the case of\nmethamphetamine and dopamine and\nserotonin in the case of MDMA and they\ndo so to a very high degree\nthe big increases in dopamine and\nserotonin but in particular the big\nincreases in dopamine tend to promote\nelectrical activity of other neurons\nremember these are after all\nneuromodulators they modulate up or down\nthe activity of other neurons and\ndopamine tends to modulate the activity\nof other neurons up\nso dopamine itself is not neurotoxic but\nwhen a lot of dopamine is released it is\nneurotoxic and it's well known that even\na single dose of methamphetamine can be\nneurotoxic not just for dopamine neurons\nbut for other types of neurons as well\nincluding serotonergic neurons\nput differently we know that the brains\nof people that take methamphetamine\ndegenerate to a smaller or to a large\ndegree depending on how often they take\nthe drug how potent the drug is and\nwhether or not they combine it with\nother drugs and yes\nif you heard that combining caffeine\nwith amphetamines can increase the\nneurotoxicity of amphetamines such as\nmethamphetamine that is true if you've\nheard that taking caffeine within the\nhours or same day as MDMA can increase\nthe toxicity of MDMA that does appear to\nbe true based on animal studies now\nthere are not a lot of studies looking\nat the toxicity of MDMA in humans but\nthere are a few\nthere are also studies looking at the\ntoxicity of MDMA in animal models\nincluding non-human primate models now\nthis is a very complex literature a lot\nof results not all over the place but\nthey're scattered in a number of ways\nfirst of all some of the animal Studies\nhave used dosages of MDMA as high as two\nmilligrams per kilogram of body weight\nas high as three milligrams per kilogram\nof body weight and even in upwards of\nthat\nbut even for the animal studies that\nused a range of dosages from 0.75 to 1.5\nmilligrams per kilogram of body weight\nthere is some evidence that in\nlaboratory Miser rats there can be some\nloss of serotonergic tone in the brains\nof animals that have been administered\nMDMA now notice I said serotonergic tone\nI didn't say serotonin neurons\nbecause of the way that MDMA Works in\nencouraging or promoting big releases in\ndopamine big releases in serotonin it's\nnot surprising that if the animals that\nwere given MDMA are subsequently\nsacrificed say later that day or the\nnext day or maybe even a week or two\nweeks later and those brains are stained\nfor proteins that are related to the\nsynthesis or release of Serotonin it's\nnot surprising that there would be\nreductions in those sorts of proteins\nright after all a lot of dopamine and\nserotonin is released and it can be\ndepleted but I should point out\ndepletion of a neuromodulator in the\nshort term is not the same thing as\ndepletion of that neuromodulator in the\nlong term nor is it the same as loss of\nthe neurons that release dopamine and\nserotonin itself\nso there are data pointing to the fact\nthat repeated administration of MDMA\nat dosages that are very much within\nlines with what we're talking about\ntoday 1.5 milligrams per kilogram of\nbody weight\ncan lower total amounts of Serotonin or\nother proteins in the serotonin\nsynthesis pathway or dopamine or\nproteins that are in the dopamine\nsynthesis pathway in specific areas of\nthe brain related to reinforcement\nrelated to mood related to motivation\nEtc however\nthe primate studies or I should say the\nnon-human primate studies which are the\nsorts of animal studies that most\nclosely mimic what one expects to see in\nthe human brain because after all mice\nand the effects of these drugs and mice\ndo translate to humans but it's thought\nthat non-human primates provide a model\nthat's far more similar to humans\nthere the data start to get kind of\ncomplicated in a way that suggests that\nMDMA might not be as neurotoxic as is\nthought based on the rodent studies and\nthis gets into a whole history of back\nand forth between different Laboratories\nand governing bodies who are trying to\nkeep MDMA legal as well as people such\nas the Sasha Shoguns of the world and\npeople in the therapy community that are\nexcited about the potential for MDMA\nbecoming legal for the treatment of PTSD\nand it really centers around one or two\nstudies\nboth of which were published in very\nhigh profile journals and the one that\nI'll highlight because the results are\nnow very clear and conclusive is a study\nthat was published back in 2002 which\nwas entitled severe dopaminergic\nneurotoxicity in primates after a common\nrecreational dose regimen of MDMA\nor ecstasy\nthis paper was published in the journal\nscience which is one of the three Apex\njournals for publishing scientific\nresearch so there's science nature and\ncell those are the top top journals most\nstringent journals to get scientific\nmanuscripts into\nthe paper received a lot of attention\nbecause as you can imagine based on the\ntitle it suggested that even\nrecreational doses of ecstasy even if\nit's pure ecstasy and it doesn't have\ncontamination from additional\nmethamphetamine or other things in it is\nneurotoxic to serotonergic and or\ndopaminergic neurons this is largely\nwhere MDMA got the reputation for quote\nunquote putting holes in your brain\nhowever\nthis study came under a lot of scrutiny\nfor a couple of reasons first of all and\nI'm certainly not saying this but it was\nargued that the authors of the study\nwere perhaps trying to prevent the\nlegalization of MDMA for the treatment\nof PTSD as far as I know there's no\ndirect evidence that that statement is\ntrue but you will actually find that in\nsome of the scientific journals in fact\nI was able to find a an editorial that\nwas published in the biomedical journal\nin 2003 which argued\nsomehow that Dr riccarte was accused of\nquote rushing his results into print\nbecause of legislation designed to curb\necstasy use before U.S Congress so you\nknow there were some uh connotations or\nI'd rather there were some strong\nsuggestions that there was a political\nbacking to trying to get this study done\nquickly and into print and so forth I\ndon't think that ever really got\nresolved what did get resolved however\nis that\nthe very study in question was retracted\nokay so the authors themselves published\na letter of retraction\nthat unfortunately is not as well\nrecognized as the paper that stimulated\nthis idea that MDMA is neurotoxic in\nprimates and keep in mind that we are\nhuman primates non-human primates being\nthe closest model to human primates that\nwe are aware of but to make a long story\nshort\nthere were some issues of labeling of\nMDMA versus other drugs in the\nlaboratory there were some issues of\nmislabeling all of which were eventually\nacknowledged by the authors of the study\nand they concluded in fact they verified\nbased on some very detailed analysis\nthat what these monkeys were injected\nwith was not actually MDMA but rather\nwas methamphetamine itself\nso what's not often acknowledged is the\nretraction of the paper on neurotoxicity\nand unfortunately the neurotoxicity\nissue is often what's mentioned now keep\nin mind there are studies in rodents\nshowing neurotoxicity of MDMA perhaps\neven at recreational doses but to date\nat least to my knowledge\nthere don't seem to be any data in\neither non-human primates or in humans\nshowing toxicity of MDMA at clinically\nrelevant doses provided it is pure MDMA\nI want to be very clear I'm not saying\nthat if you can get pure MDMA that you\nshould take it or that it won't be\nneurotoxic certainly we can expect that\nbecause of the huge known variation in\ndopamine receptors in serotonin\nreceptors and of course because of the\nknown interactions between MDMA and\nother compounds in particular caffeine\nbut also drugs such as cocaine or other\nstimulants\nthat some people might experience more\ntoxicity to a given dose of MDMA\ncompared to somebody else and there's\nreally no way to detect that\nsusceptibility to neurotoxicity now what\nwe do know is that there are people in\nthe general population that have taken a\nlot of MDMA anywhere from 1 to 200 or\nsometimes even in excess of 400 doses of\nMDMA and they're now our studies that\nhave explored\nthe neurotoxicity and perhaps even more\nimportantly the neurocognitive and\nbehavioral effects of\ntaking MDMA either zero times one time\nfive times forty times 200 times etc etc\nand one of the what I would consider\nLandmark studies in this area is a study\nentitled residual neurocognitive\nfeatures of long-term ecstasy users with\nminimal exposure to other drugs and\nthose words with minimal exposure to\nother drugs is really key in the context\nof this conversation\nbecause as I mentioned before\ninteractions between drugs what's called\npolypharmacology can create\nneurotoxicity it's unclear if MDMA is\nneurotoxic but we know methamphetamine\non its own is neurotoxic we also know\nthat people often will combine MDMA and\nmethamphetamine we also know that a lot\nof so-called MDMA out there is mostly\nmethamphetamine with only a little bit\nof MDMA so a study of the sort that I'm\nabout to describe where it is\nessentially confirmed that people were\ntaking pure MDMA and not taking any\nother drugs is of immense value this\nstudy\nhas been a little bit controversial in\nfact I've talked about it before I\ntalked about the Joe Rogan podcast I've\ntalked about it briefly with a guest on\nthis podcast Dr Nolan Williams who's a\ntriple board certified physician\npsychiatrist and neurologist at Stanford\nSchool of Medicine\nand it's an interesting study and a\nlittle bit controversial because it\nrelied on a population of people who\nhave taken MDMA anywhere from one to two\nhundred times and who've not taken any\nother drugs including caffeine and the\npopulation in mind here is a population\nof people living in Utah who\nself-identify as members of the Church\nof Latter-day Saints sometimes referred\nto as Mormons sometimes referred to as\nLDS or of the Church of Latter-day\nSaints\nthe Church of Latter-day Saints as I\nunderstand does not allow for\ntaking of certain compound certain drugs\ncertain certainly most recreational\ndrugs alcohol even caffeine and I'm sure\nthere's some variation on some of those\nthemes depending on where people live\nand the certain communities that they\nhappen to be in I am in no way shape or\nform\num declaring that I'm an expert on\nLatter-Day Saints I have a couple of\nfriends who are LDS\nhappen to be very nice people as far as\nI know they were not the people in this\nstudy but this study really emphasized\necstasy users they're called who have\nnot taken other drugs who self-identify\nas LDS\nand the major takeaway of this study was\nthat for moderate meaning people who\nhave taken ecstasy anywhere from 22 to\n50 times\nin their lifetime as well as heavy users\nof MDMA so these are people who have\ntaken MDMA anywhere from 660 to 450\ntimes in their lifetime\nthere was little evidence of decreased\ncognitive performance in standard assays\nfor cognitive performance now there were\nsome effects showing poorer here I'm\nquoting from the findings poor strategic\nself-regulation\nquote possibly reflecting increased\nimpulsivity however when you see a\nconclusion like that you should\nimmediately be thinking chicken versus\negg right it could be that people that\nare more impulsive and that have\nless strategic self-regulation are more\nlikely to take ecstasy 450 times you\ncould conclude that or you could\nconclude that people who have taken\necstasy 75 times or 25 times Etc\nare degrading their levels of\nself-control and thereby increasing\nimpulsivity the direction of the effect\nis not known these are purely\ncorrelations nonetheless this study and\na few others like it really stand as our\nbest evidence believe it or not as to\nhow ecstasy taken many times because\nafter all these people are taken\nanywhere from 22 to 450 doses of ecstasy\nin their lifetime\nis producing severe detriments in\ncognitive performance and that simply\ndoes not appear to be the case now\nunfortunately there are no data looking\nat the brains of these individuals\nlooking at for instance which brain\nstructures are active or less active or\nperhaps even looking at levels of\nSerotonin or dopamine all things that\ncan be done with positron emission\ntomography Imaging functional MRI\nEtc hopefully those studies will be done\nin the not too distant future but if we\nwere to just take a step back from all\nthe data the data in mice in rats and\nnon-human primates the retraction of the\nstudy in non-human primates which showed\nthat\nthe primates that showed\nneurodegeneration were not given MDMA as\nit was thought by the researchers but\nrather as later was acknowledged we're\nactually given methamphetamine and we\ntake into account these moderate and\nheavy users of MDMA who as far as we\nknow are being honest and haven't taken\nany other drugs\nand we look at the clinical studies\nwhere people who have never taken MDMA\nare given one or two or three defined\ndoses of pure MDMA we'll talk about\nthose studies in a moment I think the\nGestalt the top Contour the overall view\nof those studies is that provided it as\npure MDMA\nand provided the individual is not\nconsuming other drugs which have the\npotential to be neurotoxic\nand provided that it's being done in a\ncontrolled clinical setting the risk for\ntoxicity seems quite a bit lower than\nthe popular press has promoted and yet\nthere is still the risk of neurotoxicity\nif people are taking high doses of MDMA\nor taking it very frequently or\ncertainly if they are taking it in\nconjunction with other drugs or or I\nshould say and or taking MDMA in\nsettings that can promote neurotoxicity\nand the settings I'm referring to are\nany settings in which blood pressure or\nbody temperature have the propensity to\nbe greatly increased every study in mice\nin non-human primates and in humans in\nwhich MDMA is administered has observed\nsignificant increases in blood pressure\nand heart rate MDMA is after all a\npsychostimulant it's a sympathomimetic\ntalked about sympathomimetics and what\nthat means in the episode on Adderall\nand Vyvanse and ADHD but basically it's\nramping up the activity of the\nsympathetic nervous system which is your\nfight or flight system okay this is why\npeople who take these drugs get big\npupils you know big pupils of the eyes\nthat's why they feel agitated they want\nto talk a lot they feel like they want\nto move a lot that's why people take it\nto dance at Raves Etc but when people\ntake sympathomimetics whether or not\nit's MDMA or amphetamine or cocaine or\neven caffeine there's an increase in\nblood pressure and heart rate but also\nbody temperature and if that's done in\nan environment in which there's very\nlittle temperature regulation so people\naren't for instance drinking enough\nfluids and electrolytes it's very hot in\nthe room\nyou can get neurotoxicity based on\ntemperature effects and that's because\nserotonin and dopamine also act on the\nso-called medial pre-optic area of the\nhypothalamus which is involved in\ntemperature regulation if you're curious\nabout temperature regulation I covered a\nlot of that in the episodes of the\nHebrew and Lab podcast on deliberate\ncoal exposure and deliberate heat\nexposure this is an area I used to work\non many years ago as a research\nscientist before moving on to other\ntopics to research in my laboratory\nbig increases in body temperature are\nnot good the body and in particular your\nbrain can tolerate\ndecreases in body temperature that are\npretty robust and you can still stay\nsafe\nyou're not going to kill neurons but\neven an increase of three or four\ndegrees in body temperature can start to\nkill off neurons so when thinking about\nthe potential neurotoxicity of MDMA the\nconditions that is the environmental\nconditions the behavioral conditions\nunder which somebody takes MDMA are\nvitally important at least important I\nwould argue as any other compounds they\nmight be ingesting with MDMA so that's\nsomething really serious to consider so\nif somebody says MDMA puts holes in your\nbrain you would be correct in being\nskeptical or at least giving them some\ncounter Arguments for that statement but\nif somebody says MDMA is not toxic well\nthen you would be equally valid in\nsaying ah wait but we need to think\nabout the conditions under which MDMA is\nbeing taken is it pure MDMA or is it\nmostly methamphetamine in which case it\nwould be very toxic is it MDMA alone or\nin conjunction with caffeine within that\nsame 24-hour period is it MDMA while\nmoving around a lot or being outdoors or\nbeing in an environment perhaps a rave\nor dance type environment where\ntemperature is going up well in that\ncase it could be very neurotoxic so\npharmacology of MDMA counts but so does\npoly pharmacology the ingestion of other\ncompounds\nnot just during the MDMA session but\nalso in the 24 hours before and after\nthat MDMA session and behaviors will\ncertainly impact temperature which will\nimpact whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic\nor not and despite my efforts I couldn't\nfind out whether or not the LDS\nCommunity has officially sanctioned the\nuse of MDMA certainly that's one\npossibility but I have no evidence for\nthat or rather whether or not certain\npeople within the LDS Community have\nallowed themselves given themselves\npermission to use MDMA and they are not\nusing other drugs what I do understand\nto be the case is that people within the\nLDS Community are discouraged from using\ndrugs like caffeine or cocaine or\nalcohol and this particular population\nof people that was explored in this\nstudy\nself-identify as LDS and self-identify\nas having taken MDMA anywhere from 22 to\n450 times but where they got permission\nfor that whether or not it was from\nsomeone else or from themselves I do not\nknow what I do know is that within the\nacknowledgments of the paper there's\nactually a thank you to the person that\nidentified this quote unique population\nfor our study\nso I welcome you to take a look at the\npaper and if any of you know more about\nif and how a particular subgroup within\nthe LDS Community is allowed to take\nMDMA perhaps you want to put those in\nthe comment section on YouTube before\nmoving to our discussion about what MDMA\nis doing and the effects that people are\nseeing in the clinical studies for the\ntreatment of PTSD which by the way are\nextremely exciting I can't wait to share\nthese data with you I do want to touch\non something that anyone who's heard\nabout MDMA or perhaps used MDMA\nis familiar with and that's the\nso-called crash that people experience\nafter MDMA there are a lot of myths\nabout the post-mdma crash and there's a\nlot of lore out there on the internet\nabout how to offset the crash and a lot\nof lore about how to prevent the\npotential neurotoxicity of MDMA earlier\nwe talked about some of the major points\naround offsetting neurotoxicity so\ncertainly making sure that any MDMA that\none takes is in the legal clinical\nsetting that it's therefore pure MDMA\nright that it's not cut with other\nthings which certainly can increase\ntoxicity controlling the temperature of\none's environment restricting caffeine\nintake\nat least on the day of MDMA ingestion\nbut certainly the day before and the day\nafter would be advantageous well simply\nbecause of the way that caffeine and\nactivation of the adenosine receptor as\nwell as caffeine's effects on dopamine\nreceptors can interact with the\npotential again potential neurotoxicity\nof MDMA but the crash that one\nexperiences after MDMA is actually a\nphenomenon very common to the crash that\none experiences after ingestion of any\ntype of stimulant cocaine amphetamine\nEtc\nand the crash that we're referring to is\na drop in mood increase in lethargy\nfeelings of lack of motivation many\npeople have wrongly assumed that the\ncrash was due to quote unquote depletion\nof Serotonin or depletion of dopamine or\nmaybe even death of serotonergic and\ndopaminergic neurons and while certainly\nthat could be the case it's very\nunlikely that that would be the case in\nthe immediate 24 or 48 hours after MDMA\ningestion\nthat said you will see protocols that\npeople put out on the internet such as\noh you know after taking MDMA you should\ntake a bunch of you know 5-HTP or other\nprecursors to serotonin or dopamine\nwhich come in amino acid forms so\nL-tryptophan for instance is the\namino acid precursor to serotonin it's\nin the serotonin synthesis pathway\nyou'll hear that people will take\nl-tyrosine which is the amino acid\nprecursor to dopamine as a way to try\nand buffer or increase dopamine during\nthe so-called period of the crash\nthere's really no evidence that any of\nthose things can be beneficial and there\nis actually some reason to believe that\nit might be detrimental because if\nanything taking L-tryptophan and taking\nl-tyrosine would actually further\ndeplete serotonin and dopamine so the\nlogic there is simply not very good what\nis clear however is that MDMA can cause\nnot just profound increases in dopamine\nserotonin and oxytocin but that anytime\nthere's a big increase in dopamine there\nis going to be a post-dopominergic\nincrease in prolactin release and\nprolactin is a hormone sometimes\nconsidered a neural hormone but it's\nreally a hormone that's involved in a\nlot of things milk let down in lactating\nwomen it's involved in setting the\nrefractory period to sexual arousal\nand erection and ejaculation in males\nafter ejaculation it's involved in lots\nof different functions in the brain and\nbody including the laying down of body\nfat stores and it's also associated with\nincreases in lethargy decreases in\ndopamine this is why drugs that increase\ndopamine are known to decrease prolactin\nat least in the short term this is wise\ndrugs like cabergoline for instance that\nincrease dopamine are used as ways to\nsuppress prolactin now MDMA ingestion is\nknown to dramatically increase prolactin\nand people are starting to realize that\nit perhaps is the increase in prolactin\nthat occurs both during and for some\nperiod of time probably hours or days\nafter ingestion of MDMA that leads to at\nleast some components of the so-called\ncrash that feeling of lethargy and lack\nof motivation maybe diminished mood Etc\nand for that reason some people have\nstarted to explore the use of things\nlike p5p which is essentially a\nmetabolite of vitamin B6 which is known\nto suppress prolactin\nas a way to try and buffer some of that\ncrash to my knowledge there are no human\ndata yet exploring the use of p5p or\nother vitamin B6 derivatives or\ncapergoline or things of that sort to\nreduce prolactin in a controlled\nstandardized clinical trial kind of\nmanner but I've spoken to some of the\nclinicians that are using MDMA legally\nwithin the context of the treatment of\nPTSD and this is an area that's starting\nto receive some additional attention so\nI just mentioned it briefly here because\nfor instance there's a lot of ideas out\nthere that people should be taking\nL-tryptophan they should be taking\nl-tyrosine they should be taking\nmagnesium other things Etc after taking\nMDMA in order to recover from the\npost-mdma crash more quickly\nbut it's really the increase in\nprolactin which speaks most directly to\nthe subjective effects of the so-called\ncrash so by my read of the mechanisms of\nMDMA the neurochemicals it releases the\nneural hormones that it promotes the\nrelease of prolactin in particular this\np5p suppression of prolactin is perhaps\nthe one that's most intriguing and that\nreally has any kind of mechanistic basis\nso I promise that going forward as the\nscientists and clinicians that are using\nMDMA for the treatment of PTSD and other\nconditions such as alcohol use disorder\nEtc\nstart to explore the use of post-mdma\nsession p5p and other modes of\nsuppressing prolactin for the hours and\ndays after MDMA promise to update you on\nthose findings throughout today's\nepisode I've been referring to clinical\nstudies that is clinical trials\nexploring the use of MDMA in order to\naugment treatment for PTSD\nso let's just take a moment and talk\nabout what PTSD is PTSD is\npost-traumatic stress disorder\ntrauma is anything that modifies the\nbrain to function less well going\nforward you know physical trauma you can\nhave emotional trauma typically PTSD is\nused to refer to emotional trauma caused\nby either single events so you can\nimagine you know car accident sexual\nassault\nthese could be first person experiences\nso things that happen to somebody that\nleads to trauma and then PTSD these can\nalso be third person events where\nsomeone observes something that is\ntraumatic to them\nmaybe somebody being killed dismembered\nany number of different things that\ncould be very traumatic in the immediate\nand long term and of course\nPTSD need not be caused only by single\nevent traumas but by multiple event\ntraumas entire relationships entire\nchildhoods wartime experiences\ncombinations of different traumas and on\nand on there are so many different forms\nof trauma if any of you are interested\nin trauma and its treatment I highly\nrecommend the book trauma by Dr Paul\nConte he's an MD medical doctor\npsychiatrist he was featured as a guest\non this podcast he's been on a number of\nother prominent podcasts we will provide\na link in our show note captions to the\nbook trauma I consider that book to be\nthe best book in terms of describing\nwhat trauma is and isn't and how it\nleads to PTSD it also describes some of\nDr Paul Conti's own experiences with\ntrauma and his own treatment of trauma\nin his patient population which is quite\nwide-ranging men women young people\nolder people and a variety of traumatic\nexperiences so excellent book for those\nof you interested in trauma\nnow the treatment of trauma has been met\nwith some degree of Success Through\nquality talk therapy\nlet's Define quality talk therapy in the\nway that Dr Paul Conti did on this\nepisode that's talk therapy for which\nthe patient sometimes referred to as the\nclient but more traditionally referred\nto as the patient and the therapist so a\npsychologist or psychiatrist has Good\nRapport and as a consequence of that\nRapport there is the feeling of support\nthat there is a safe place in which to\nexplore the trauma and what's happening\nin one's current life in order to\nunderstand how that trauma is fitting\ninto adaptive and maladaptive behaviors\nand emotional states\nnow in addition to Rapport and support\nbeing critical there's a third component\nof effective talk therapy for trauma\nwhich is Insight or one's ability to\ncome to an understanding of why one\nfeels the way they do\nand to link that to some larger context\nthat brings about some degree of relief\nand that's where things start to get a\nlittle bit abstract and that's also\nwhere we start to see that while trauma\ntherapy in the form of talk therapy can\nbe very effective about half of people\nthat undergo talk therapy and talk\ntherapy alone for the treatment of PTSD\nachieve no long-lasting relief of\nsymptoms and an even smaller number of\nthem undergo complete remittance of\ntheir PTSD okay so their symptoms can\nlessen they can get some improvement but\nthat Improvement is often slight or is\ntransient and for those that do achieve\nrelief it's often not complete remission\nof the PTSD itself\nnow in addition to talk therapy for PTSD\nthere is of course prescription drug\ntherapies and most often these fall\nunder the category of ssris selective\nserotonin reuptake Inhibitors and it's\nwell known that ssris can be in limited\ncircumstances effective for the\ntreatment of PTSD\nit has been shown for instance that as\nmany as 40 maybe as many as 60 of people\nthat take ssris for the treatment of\nPTSD get some symptom relief\nnow that is not to say that ssris don't\nhave side effects they can have side\neffects some of you are probably\nfamiliar with these side effects things\nlike blunting of libido blunting of\nappetite or increases in appetite in\nsome cases disruption of sleep wake\nrhythms motivation Etc so there's often\nan exploration for the so-called minimal\neffective dose that provides some\nsymptom relief to PTSD but that doesn't\nintroduce unwanted side effects and of\ncourse there's a third situation where\npeople are taking ssris and doing talk\ntherapy for PTSD and what's very clear\nis that anytime you add quality talk\ntherapy to a drug treatment you're going\nto improve the outcomes for that drug\ntreatment\nthe reverse is not always true it's not\nalways the case that adding prescription\ndrug treatment to talk therapy improves\noutcomes for talk therapy although that\nhas been observed in a number of studies\nnow the whole idea of exploring the use\nof MDMA for the treatment of PTSD stem\nfrom the fact that even in people who\nare getting quality talk therapy and\nagain we can Define quality talk therapy\nas\nGood Rapport between patient and\nclinician as well as feelings of support\nas well as potential insight\nand even when ssris are combined with\nthat quality talk therapy there's still\na large number of people who simply do\nnot achieve significant or long-lasting\nrelief from their PTSD and an even fewer\nnumber who go into full remittance of\ntheir PTSD that is despite being\ndiligent and hardworking in their talk\ntherapy despite the therapist being very\ncommitted despite the use of ssris in\nconjunction with a talk therapy those\npeople often still qualify as having\nPTSD and the goal of course is for\nsomebody to receive treatment that\nallows them to no longer meet the\ncriteria for having PTSD\nnot just in terms of a clinical\nevaluation but that they themselves\nreport feeling much better not feeling\noverwhelmed with the symptomology of\nPTSD now the symptomology for PTSD is\nvast and it's far too vast to go into\ninto a lot of detail right now I think\nmost people are familiar with a\nstereotyped example of PTSD this is the\nsoldier that comes back from overseas\nthat has been in gun fights or in\nbattles of different kinds has likely\nseen casualties and severe injuries and\nthat upon return to a safe environment\nis still experiencing a lot of anxiety\nand sometimes panic attacks that occur\nseemingly at random or they can be\nsparked by you know the classic\nstereotyped example is you know a car\nbackfires and then the person suddenly\nfeels as if they're back in battle that\nsort of thing does happen certainly but\nthere are a whole other category of\nsymptoms of PTSD which include\ndissociative symptoms of PTSD people who\nhave PTSD from very intensely traumatic\nexperiences that um are checked out they\ndon't feel like they can engage they\nhave brain fog they are distracted they\ngo from feeling anxious to feeling\nexhausted they have sleep issues not\nsurprisingly then people with PTSD of\neither the dissociative type or other\nsymptomology of PTSD and keep in mind\nthat one can have both dissociative and\nnon-dissociative symptoms of PTSD such\nas anxiety and panic\nare at a far greater risk of substance\nabuse so the current estimates are that\npeople with PTSD no matter what type of\nPTSD dissociative symptoms or or\notherwise you know panic attacks or both\nare at a much greater risk of having\naddictions to either illicit drugs or\nprescription drugs or both so things\nlike alcohol use disorder is very common\nin people with PTSD opioid use disorder\nis very common stimulant use disorder\nand on and on so people with PTSD suffer\nat a number of different levels and\nthere are all these what are called\ncomorbidities with PTSD including\naddiction but also depression anxiety\nand so you can start to see how ptst\nsets up a whole Cascade of things that\nmake living life extremely problematic\nat the level of basic relationships\nfunctioning in the workplace\nand even when mental health appears to\nbe in check oftentimes people are\nholding a lot in so they have\ncardiovascular and cerebral vascular\ndeficits that cause a lot of problems in\ntheir immediate and long-term physical\nhealth so PTSD is a very serious issue\nthe current estimates are that as many\nas eight percent of people in the United\nStates have PTSD and again the estimates\naround comorbidities range anywhere from\nyou know 17 to 46 or as high as 65\npercent of people with PTSD having\ncomorbidities for other mental health\nissues and addiction in particular\nso finding lasting relief to PTSD is\nextremely important and made even more\nimportant by the fact that many people\nwith PTSD sadly end up committing\nsuicide so suicide rates are far greater\nin people with PTSD the exact rates of\nincrease and suicidality in people with\nPTSD\nare a little bit hard to arrive at in\nthe statistics because of all the\ncomorbidities but suffice to say that\nsuicide is far more likely in people\nwith PTSD along with all the other\nissues that PTSD brings about now PTSD\ncreates all the problems that it does\nlargely through changes in brain\ncircuitry as well as neural\ncommunication between the brain and body\nmany people have perhaps heard of the\nbook the body keeps the score which is a\nvery successful and popular book about\nthe idea that trauma can be quote\nunquote stored in the body to be clear\ntraumas can't actually be stored in the\nbody you don't actually store memories\nin the body\nwhat you store are activation of neural\ncircuits that include brain and body and\nthey all seem to Center back into the\ninsula that structure that we talked\nabout earlier this structure in our\nbrain that has a map of our body's\nsurface so contrary to popular belief we\ndon't store memories in the body or\ntrauma in the body in a way that for\ninstance working out a knot or a pain in\none's lower back will relieve the trauma\nit sometimes can activate a memory of\nthe trauma but when one is doing that\nwhat you're really doing is activating\nneural circuits that reside within the\nbrain within the insula that correspond\nto Sensations within the body now I\ndon't want to diminish the role of the\nbody and the formation and the\nPersistence of PTSD and I certainly\nthink the book the body keeps the score\nis a pioneering book it's in fact an\nimportant book uh but I want to\nemphasize that the modern Neuroscience\nreally points to the fact that PTSD is\ncaused by the exact sorts of brain\nNetwork activations that we were\ndiscussing earlier things like\nheightened levels of activation in the\namygdala to insulate pathway which of\ncourse would exacerbate bodily\nSensations related to the trauma or\nheightened activation of the hippocampus\nthis memory Center in the brain too\namygdala to insula circuitry now\ntherefore it should come as no surprise\nthat if MDMA can reduce the levels of\nactivity in the hippocampal to amygdala\nto insula circuitry and can do so both\nwhile someone is under the effects of\nMDMA but then lead to persistent\nlong-lasting reductions in the\nactivation of those brain networks well\nthen it stands to reason that MDMA could\nbe a valid therapeutic for the treatment\nof PTSD and of course this has been\nexplored and here we can really give a\nnod and\nlarge debt of gratitude to the so-called\nmaps group the maps group is a group\nthat's operating mainly out of Santa\nCruz California but they have a number\nof different satellite Laboratories and\nclinical groups both in the US in Canada\nand abroad where they've worked with\ngovernment organizations to get legal\nauthorization\nto give MDMA to patients who have PTSD\nto also give them talk therapy and then\nto compare the effects of talk therapy\nwith MDMA to talk therapy with Placebo\nalone and there are about three to five\nstudies in this area now that stand as\nlarge-scale clinical trials that are\nshowing what can only be described as\nremarkable results for the treatment of\nPTSD so rather than going to any one of\nthose studies in immense detail I'm\ngoing to summarize across those studies\nI will provide links to those in the\nshow note captions\nthe two that I think are most\ninteresting are the study entitled MDMA\nassisted therapy for severe PTSD a\nrandomized double-blind\nplacebo-controlled phase three study as\nwell as the study entitled the effects\nof MDMA assisted therapy on alcohol and\nsubstance use in a phase 3 trial for the\ntreatment of severe TSD so as the title\nsuggests both clinical trials involve\ngiving people talk therapy and MDMA or\ntalk therapy and placebo\ntalk about exactly how that was done in\na moment and then to look at relief of\nPTSD symptoms but also relief of some of\nthe addictive symptoms that are commonly\nassociated with PTSD so just to give you\nan overview of what's happening with\nthese trials and why there's so much\nexcitement and why we really are on the\ncusp of legalization of MDMA for the\ntreatment of PTSD in the sorts of\nclinical context I described\nwhen people are given just talk therapy\nalone or talk therapy with ssris\nthey will often as I mentioned earlier\nexperience reductions in their severity\nof PTSD symptoms and rarely they will\nexperience complete remittance of their\nPTSD that is they will no longer qualify\nfor PTSD after receiving a number of\ntalk therapy sessions\nso let's compare that to what happens\nwhen people do talk therapy in\nconjunction with MDMA and I'll explain\nexactly what that means in a moment but\nit essentially means taking MDMA while\ndoing talk therapy however this is a\nvery important however the people who\nare taking MDMA in these trials have\nalready done talk therapy without MDMA\nthen they're doing talk therapy under\nthe influence of MDMA and then they are\ndoing sessions of talk therapy not under\nthe influence of MDMA and the entire\ntime they're doing that with the same\ntwo therapists okay in the placebo group\npeople are doing talk therapy with two\ntherapists\nbut they're not taking MDMA okay so\nthey're doing the same number of therapy\nsessions but they're not taking MDMA so\nto just get to the key numbers first\nthe overall rate for clinically\neffective response to MDMA assisted\ntherapy is 88 that's what's emerging\nfrom these trials versus 60 for the\nplacebo\nand therapy alone so on the face of it\nyou might say okay wow 88 of people who\ndo talk therapy and here I might as well\njust finally explain how this is done\npatients are selected because they have\nPTSD they meet the clinical criteria for\nPTSD\nthey do three 90-minute therapy sessions\nwith two therapists talking about their\nPTSD symptoms talking about to the\nextent that they can the incident that\nor incidents the life events that led to\nthat PTSD\nnone of that is done under the influence\nof any drug okay so everyone in the\nexperiment does that then\nthe group divides into two where half\nare taking MDMA\nthey take that\nthree times\nduring those three times they are also\nreceiving therapy sessions with the same\ntherapists that they were working with\nbefore they took MDMA\nthe first session they're taking 80\nmilligrams of MDMA and then a 40\nmilligram booster about an hour and a\nhalf to two hours in\nthe second session they are taking a\nhigher dose of MDMA it's 120 milligrams\nand then if they elect to they can take\na 60 milligram booster about an hour and\na half to two hours into the session\nand then there's a third session where\nthey take again 120 milligrams of MDMA\nand have the option to take a 60\nmilligram booster about an hour and a\nhalf to two hours into the session again\nanytime they're on MDMA they have\ntherapists there\nthat they're talking to about their\ntrauma they are either spending time\nwith their eyes closed lying down\nsometimes in an eye mask and thinking\nabout the trauma thinking about their\ncurrent state and experience\nalso thinking about what happened before\nthen they're exiting the eye mask or\ntalking to the therapist therapist is\ntaking notes asking questions remember\nthey've established a strong Rapport\nsupportive relationship with these\ntherapists prior to taking MDMA in the\ntherapy session\nand then they also undergo three\n90-minute therapy sessions with the two\ntherapists spaced one week apart after\nthe final MDMA session now those that\nwere placed into the placebo condition\ndo everything exactly the same as I just\ndescribed so three 90-minute sessions as\nprep then three\neight hour sessions with those two\ntherapists\nand then three 90-minute follow-up\nsessions one week apart but they take a\nplacebo\nnot MDMA so you can see that in these\nso-called Maps studies these clinical\ntrials for PTSD the conditions are very\nsimilar except for the inclusion of the\ndrug MDMA\nso those rates of success with talk\ntherapy and MDMA again overall rate for\nclinically effective response to MDMA\nassisted therapy was 88 compared to 60\npercent for therapy and placebo\nwhat's even more impressive however is\nthat 67 percent of the people in the\nMDMA plus therapy treatment group no\nlonger met the criteria for PTSD by the\nend of the treatment so in other words\ntheir PTSD went into remittance now we\ncould say they are quote unquote cured\nbut typically for things like PTSD\nthat's not the language that's used\nrather what's used is statistical\nevaluation of how the different symptoms\nlike dissociation or anxiety or Sleep\nDisorders are explored so while to some\nof you a difference between 60 percent\nsuccess with talk therapy and Placebo\nversus 88 success with talk therapy plus\nMDMA might not seem like that big of a\ndifference it is indeed quite an\nenormous difference in fact to my\nknowledge there is no other example of a\ntreatment for a psychiatric disorder\nthat is successful to the same magnitude\nI could be wrong about that I'm sure\nsome psychiatrists out there are going\nto jump on me about this and please do I\nwould encourage you if you are aware of\nany therapy plus drug treatment that is\neffective at rates of greater than 88\npercent for the treatment of a major\npsychiatric disorder please do put that\ninformation in the comments on YouTube\nand perhaps a reference to a study would\nbe even better but even if not just put\na reference to that that would be great\nfor sake of future episodes Etc but\nnonetheless an 88 percent\nsuccess rate and here I'm referring to\nsuccess rate as a significant reduction\nin clinical symptoms for PTSD and 67 of\nthose people going into full remittance\nfor PTSD by the end of the treatment is\npretty spectacular which is why you're\nhearing so much these days about the\npotential transition of MDMA from a\nschedule one drug for which there are\nquote unquote No clinical applications\nto potentially a legal within the\ncontext of clinical use application of\nMDMA which it does appear the\nlegislature is at least considering for\nas early as 2024 maybe even later in\n2023 it remains to be seen now a number\nof other important results have emerged\nfrom this and other clinical trials for\ninstance\nremember earlier I talked about how many\npeople with PTSD also suffer from\nalcohol use disorder what's interesting\nis that for people that were in the MDMA\nplus talk Therapy Group in this and\nother studies\nwho also had patterns of alcohol use\ndisorder and even some other substance\nuse disorders the MDMA plus talk therapy\ntreatment\nin many cases resolved their addiction\nto alcohol or other symptoms as well and\nperhaps that shouldn't be surprising if\nwe think about the addictions as\nstemming directly from their PTSD but it\nis surprising if you think about the\nfact that alcohol use disorder and some\nother addictive disorders\noftentimes will stem from disruptions in\nneural circuitry that\nare the same disruptions in neural\ncircuitry that occur in PTSD but often\nare the consequence of entirely other\nbrain wiring phenomenon what I'm saying\nhere is that just because addiction and\nPTSD are often co-morbid with one\nanother\nit was not necessarily the case that\ntreating and resolving PTSD would\nresolve the alcohol or substance abuse\ndisorder and yet that seems to be the\ncase often not always but often in these\nsuccessful treatments of PTSD so that's\nvery exciting some of the other\nparticularly exciting results from these\nclinical trials on MDMA plus talk\ntherapy is that the dissociative form of\nPTSD has traditionally proved to be\nespecially hard to treat and that's\nthought to stem from the fact that\nsuccessful treatment of PTSD whether or\nnot it's by talk therapy or talk therapy\ncombined with ssris or talk therapy\ncombined with any drug treatment or\nbehavioral treatment like EMDR eye\nmovement desensitization reprogramming\nor other forms of treatments that are\ndesigned to rewire neural circuitry\nalmost always involve the patient\ngetting very close to or at least\nreporting the traumatic experiences in a\nlot of detail and you can imagine why\nfor somebody who's dissociating from\nthat very experience who's quote unquote\nchecked out and can't really seem to\naccess the emotional states and the\nmemories\nbecause they're blocked off from them or\nbecause they're unwilling to access\nthose memories and really think about\nthe full emotional capacity of those\nmemories that it would be particularly\nhard to bring them through any kind of\ntreatment for PTSD so it appears that\nMDMA in providing this pro-social\nempathic again empathic for others and\nempathic for self chemical and kind of\nmental environment as well as the\npresence of two trusted therapists which\none has a really good rapport\nallows patients with PTSD to really get\nclose to those experiences that were\ntraumatic to talk about them and to\nthink about them and in many ways to\nreframe them in a context that often\ninvolves empathy for others and empathy\nfor self now here we're not necessarily\ntalking about forgiveness of\nperpetrators although that's sometimes\nthe case that people will forgive the\nperson that inflicted the trauma on them\nbut more often than not it's about tying\ntheir feelings of trauma and their\nfeelings of depression anxiety\ndissociation Etc to some sort of larger\ncontext that allows them to see\nthemselves in the role of agency to be\nin the role of knowing that yes these\nthings happened and yet by getting close\nto the emotional load of those things\nand really being in many ways unafraid\nto get close to the emotional load of\nthat and having support around that that\nthe emotional load seems diminished and\nthat they experience the emotional load\nof those experiences as diminished both\nwithin the MDMA treatment session and\nafterwards for long periods of time so\nessentially what happens is these people\nfeel that what once burdened them they\ncan still remember but it no longer\nburdens them it no longer feels like\nit's in their body and in their mind or\non Loop or on repeat in a way that's\ninvasive in a way that interferes with\nother aspects of normal functioning so\nwhen one hears about these kinds of\nresults and when you hear about some of\nthe patient reports and I invite you to\ndo that you can go to the map site which\nby the way is recruiting subjects for\nthese clinical trials and you'll also\nfind reports of individuals who\nparticipated in these clinical trials\nand of course we will provide links to\nthese incredible clinical trials that\nMaps has spearheaded what you find is\nthat\nthe combination of MDMA and talk therapy\nin many ways is not about the drug\nhaving a particular effect it's really\nabout the drug having a particular\neffect that allows the motivations and\nthe results of talk therapy to really be\nheightened and I think that's a really\nkey point to make because up until now\nwe've really been talking about the\nneurochemistry of MDMA the potential\ntoxicity or lack thereof of MDMA we've\nbeen talking about that brain networks\nEtc but when one thinks about the valid\nclinical use of MDMA for the treatment\nof PTSD and I should mention\nit also had some success in dealing with\nnot only alcohol use disorders and other\nuse disorders associated with PTSD but\nalso relieving the depression associated\nwith PTSD so now MDMA is being explored\nfor treatment of not just PTSD but also\nfor depression for alcohol use disorder\nand for eating disorders as well\nMDMA seems to be a compound that\nproduces the right kind of subjective\nand neurochemical milieu in the brain\nthat allows therapy to be that much more\npotent within a limited number of\nsessions and when one thinks about the\ncost of mental health care you know how\nexpensive it is to get therapy over and\nover and over again which in ideal\ncircumstances people are able to do that\neither by way of insurance or by their\nown finances or you know I I don't want\nto say that the cost of therapy should\nbe reduced because of course therapists\nhave to survive also but the idea here\nis that people who are suffering would\nbe able to achieve relief from their\nPTSD their depression their addiction\nand to be able to do so by hopefully\npersisting in their therapy over\nwhatever period of time is required but\nalso to assume a circumstance in which\nsomebody only has\n10 or 15 or maybe even just three\nopportunities to undergo treatment for\nPTSD and nonetheless is able to achieve\ntremendous relief during the session and\nafter the session and it really does\nseem to be the case that for reasons\nthat you now understand the activation\nof particular brain networks the\nsuppression of other brain networks in\nparticular this amygdala to\ninsulopathway that when people are under\nthe influence of MDMA in these very safe\nand therapeutic supportive settings they\nare able to look at traumatic events and\nthe ways that those traumatic events\nimpact them in ways that really allow\nthem to cognitively reframe those events\nand somatically reframe those events to\nreally change the way that it lives in\ntheir body and mind so that it's no\nlonger invasive and then they can go on\nand Lead productive adaptive lives and\nas a final Point related to these\nclinical studies I of course would be\nremiss if I didn't touch on some of the\nso-called adverse effects because\nanytime there's a drug or talk therapy\nfor a mental health issue Adverse Events\nhave to be considered and I think it's\nquite reassuring that in the case of\nMDMA therapy there were no increases in\nthe number of suicide attempts or\nsuicidality or obsession with suicide\ncontrast that with the group that\nreceived Placebo where there were a\ncertain number of Baseline and predicted\nobsessions with suicide fortunately at\nleast to my knowledge there was no\nactual suicide attempt or successful\nsuicide thankfully but the point being\nthat the addition of MDMA drug therapy\nto PTSD talk therapy does not seem to\nincrease the quote-unquote side effects\nthat are sometimes associated with PTSD\ntalk therapy because indeed there can be\nside effects to exploring PTSD and\nTrauma as one would expect\nso overall I would say it's very\nexciting times for the exploration of\nMDMA as an augmented talk therapy for\nthe treatment of PTSD and these other\nconditions again I think the maps group\nhas done a remarkable job of keeping\nthis within the realm of legal and\ntrying to move things forward in terms\nof legislation to make sure that MDMA\nisn't simply made legal and then abused\nrecreationally I know people out there\nhave different views on whether or not\ndrugs like MDMA should be legal or not\nthat's not what this episode is about\nwhat I am very excited about as you can\nprobably tell what I think a lot of\npeople in the psychology and Psychiatry\nCommunity are very excited about you say\nthe Mental Health Community at large is\nthat these compounds that for many years\nwe're only associated with their\nrecreational uses and therefore\nwere not well understood because they\nwere often contaminated or taken in\ncombination with other things or by\npeople that never\nshould have been taking them in the\nfirst place\ntaken by young kids which is a whole\nother matter you know a lot of issues\nand problems associated with these\ncompounds and yet\nwe're now seeing from these clinical\ntrials when used\nsay properly because really when safety\nProtocols are obeyed when there's\nclinical support it is very clear that\nwhen MDMA is combined with quality talk\ntherapy that the outcomes are looking\ntremendously positive it's by no means a\nmiracle cure it is by no means perfect\nand time will tell what problems if any\narise from the short or long-term use of\nmdama in this context but I think it's\nremarkable that anywhere from two to\nthree sessions with MDMA and talk\ntherapy have been shown to significantly\nreduce PTSD symptoms and in some cases\ncompletely eliminate PTSD symptoms in\nsuch a wide range of patients and in\npatients that have experienced both PTSD\nand these other comorbid disorders I\nthink it's really remarkable it's very\nexciting and I look forward to seeing\nwhat the next round of data produce so\nas is often the case on this podcast\ntoday we went into a lot of detail about\na subject MDMA is this incredible\ncompound synthesized as far as we know\nfirst by humans not by plants not by\naliens but by humans\nand that produces big increases in\ndopamine and serotonin to create these\nhighly motivated pro-social empathic\nStates\nmeaning both empathy for others and for\nself and that when applied in the\ncontext of psychiatric challenges like\nPTSD and addiction is proving to create\na lot of relief for a lot of people\nwhere other forms of drug therapy or\ncombination drug and talk therapy had\nfailed before\nwe talked about some of the potential\nneurotoxicity issues I don't think that\nis a resolved issue just yet although\nthe bulk of data in humans and non-human\nprimates point to the fact that at\nreasonable Doses and we talked earlier\nabout what those are at reasonable doses\nwhen not combined with other drugs it\ndoes not appear that MDMA is exceedingly\nneurotoxic and it may not be neurotoxic\nat all of course one needs to be\nexceedingly cautious when thinking about\nthe use of any sympathomimetic\nthey of course can be neurotoxic\nanything with methamphetamine in it has\na potential to be neurotoxic but of\ncourse dosage matters context matters we\ntalked about that and of course\nthe purity of drug matters and again I\njust want to re-emphasize the fentanyl\ncontamination of MDMA that sold on the\nstreet and that is being used\nrecreational is of very serious\npotentially lethal concern I also expect\nthat there will be a lot of interest in\nthese clinical trials that Maps is doing\nso again you can find links to that in\nthe show note captions and I think in\ngeneral\nwe should acknowledge that we are a very\ninteresting and important time in human\nhistory for the treatment of psychiatric\ndisorders and for Neuroscience generally\nbecause whether or not we're talking\nabout psilocybin or LSD or Ayahuasca or\nketamine or today's topic of MDMA\nregardless of what drug and\nneurotransmitter neuromodulator systems\nare involved what we're really talking\nabout are ways to access neuroplasticity\nthe nervous system's incredible ability\nto modify itself in response to\nexperience ideally to be modified in\nadaptive ways that make it function\nbetter so that's really the Crux of what\ntalk therapy and drug therapies are\nabout that's what the goal of using MDMA\nas a clinical tool is all about and in\nthat sense I find MDMA to be an\nincredibly interesting and important\ntopic and I hope you did as well if\nyou're learning from and or enjoying\nthis podcast please subscribe to our\nYouTube channel that's a terrific zero\ncost way to support us in
